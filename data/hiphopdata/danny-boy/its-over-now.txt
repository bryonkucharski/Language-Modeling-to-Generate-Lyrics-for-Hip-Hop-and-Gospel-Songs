I can tell that you're worried 
 It's written on your face 
 And it tells your story 
 Girl, I can feel your pain 
 It's unspeakable what he did to you 
 He don't deserve one bit of you 
 Girl, we're walking out, it's time we're through 
 He might as well get over you 
 It's over now, girl, you can stop your crying 
 It's over now, there won't be no denying 
 It's over now, I promise you he won't hurt you again 
 You can wipe your tears away, it's over now, yes it is, oh 
 Well, he can cry if he wants to 
 See, that won't change a thing 
 'Cause the things he did to hurt you 
 They'll just happen again 
 You can take your head and hold it up 
 And tell the man you've had enough 
 It's time he realize that things are through 
 It's time that he get over you 
 It's over now, girl, you can stop your crying 
 It's over now, there won't be no denying 
 It's over now, I promise you he won't hurt you again 
 You should wipe your tears away, it's over now, no 
 Some women don't recognize 
 They don't exist 
 They feel like that they can't survive 
 Without their man 
 It's time we all realize it's not worth it 
 If you treat it so bad 
 Lift up your head, show somebody 
 Get back the respect in your life 
 Over now, you stop, you can stop your crying 
 It's over now, there'll be no denying 
 It's over now, I promise you he won't hurt you again 
 You can wipe your tears away 
 It's over, it's over now
