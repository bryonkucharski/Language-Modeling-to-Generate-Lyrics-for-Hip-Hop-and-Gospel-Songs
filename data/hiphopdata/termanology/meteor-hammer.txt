I don't touch that swine 
 I want that unnecessary beef 
 You smoke garbage buds 
 We smoke tons of keef 
 Fishing, looking for that big-mouth bass 
 An' flashing, jack your whole stash 
 In fashion, keep my goons lined 
 In an orderly fashion 
 It's glossy with 500 horsies in the Benz 
 Tinted out to spend the night 
 You ain't got angel funds is low, stack 
 Your bitch been ho-jacked 
 Still scoop her up, bring her home 
 And blow that, 'cause Ghost be mostly 
 Looking pretty toasty 
 Front row at Mayweather verse Mosley 
 With a Bin Laden bottle 
 A Brazilian model 
 Got the paparazzi jumping 
 Like they hit the Lotto 
 I party hard, like I"m fresh out of the cages 
 I rages like Charlie Sheen, out in Vegas 
 You drop your pants at your ankles 
 At the urinal at a ballgame 
 I'm on the stool getting brain 
 From a tall dame, 'cause I'm 5'8" 
 Shorty like 6'2" 
 Feed her coke, locked jaw like a pitbull. 
 I was born to rep you fucking with a hornet's nest 
 Old shooters in the corner like Hornacek 
 Young boys that be handling the rock 
 Chris Paul dish off, hammer in the sock 
 Gold flakes in the Gold Schlager 
 The ammo green XJ12, you know the old Jaguar 
 Got the birch-wood lacing the interior 
 Poppy bagels getting flavored out in Syria 
 Only the Fonz, best laced plates 
 Cheese that reach maturity, 
 Dick sucks from Shannon Doherty 
 Take your temperature anally and orally 
 Make a batch of home drizzle royally with oil B 
 Hopping out the Rolly Royce 
 Rolls Gold nouveau 
 Diamond-studded shoes, so 
 Fliest nigga you know 
 Puerto Rican version of Scarface 
 Fuck with the God's say 
 Disrespect, piss in your broad's face 
 Chains stay chunky like Oprah's belly 
 Got the purple and the brown: 
 Peanut butter and jelly 
 When I step up in the spot with the rock 
 You'll see the popular poppin' rappers 
 Go in their pocket and pull out their wallet 
 When I click-clack, now get up on the ground 
 'Cause I Onyx, Pete Rock, Chuck D shut 'em down 
 You know Term, I'm the kid with the 'preme beats 
 Butter Pecan J Lo, kid with the mean cheeks 
 Boobies on my gold fronts, iced out notebook 
 Making volcanoes in the kitchen when the coke cook 
 I rode around with all kinds of thugs 
 High on drugs, pissing out tiger blood
