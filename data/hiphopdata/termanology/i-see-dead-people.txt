 I'm like the reper of death, taking steps through cemetery with my gold bottle of Hen. 
 This is jim he the toolman, he flipt his new van over like a rollercoaster got 'em on a new stand. 
 And this is little Jen her mama had her in the pen, so her future was bleek before it began. 
 And homie right here he was in the grims, till he cold ran the wrong colombian. 
 Politision, Collage prison, electrician, officetion, we all gone end up in this position, in the box with our body all stiffen. 
 This the homie Mark he got murdered by a cop infront of a NY barbershop. Where the kids starve allot, Og's spark allot, so the D's spark does not, right in the parking lot. 
 And this is little chris he went through some shit, he had scoliosis and roller coasted his wrist. But nothing close to this kid named rolen nahodacig put toasters up to his wig and roasted him like a pig.
