Gotta get up, book that flight 
 'Bout to hit that tour 
 Gotta get this money baby 
 Oh baby, please don't go, please 
 Baby please don't go, please don't go 
 Oh baby, please don't go, please 
 Baby please don't go 
 My Murder Mass chick tell me 'Term don't go' 
 I say, 'here's a little cash, go burn that dough' 
 We in the hood ma, but I'm tryna take you out of that 
 It's big bread in the game, and I'm the part of that 
 I'm tryna get this big money for shizee 
 I be gone till November on the tour and its legal 
 And I'm gone, gone, go smile, give me a toast 
 Put your glass in the air and shh?, I'm out of here 
 I know you love the way that I be breakin' your back 
 But when we in the sack I ain't makin' no stacks 
 And I ain't the type to sit around, broke for nothin' 
 My ma, I'd rather have you swingin' on the pole or somethin' 
 Can't you, see my vision, the cream, the winnin', the gleam, the leanin' 
 I had to make a mean decision 
 It's either, sit around the hood, broke with a hoe 
 Or bounce on the tour bus, mind focused on dough 
 I'm out 
 My VA chick tell 'me please don't leave' 
 She tryna hide my keys on me when I'm puttin' on my jeans 
 I told her 'chill ma, I promise I'ma keep it real ma' 
 You know I have my fingers crossed on a real yo 
 I can't see myself tied down yet 
 I want a Bentley and a Benz, and a fly Corvette 
 And there ain't no other way to get it, but on the road 
 When I come back from tour, hit you off with a rose 
 Maybe a ring, nah, never a ring 
 But when I pass through the hood you know I give you a ring 
 I ain't tryna be foul, just tryna be rich 
 Tryna be up in the six with the ST Click 
 Listen to this, you hear, I be right there 
 That's a million dollar sound, we tryna keep that there 
 What use in droppin' a single if it ain't number one 
 I got 99 problems but you just ain't one 
 Sorry ma 
 My NY chick tell me 'Term come back' 
 But she no speakin' English, she tryna learn all that 
 I told her yo me voy, mammy, I mean I'm leavin' 
 I be back in ATL by the end of the weekend 
 Back down in Miami by the first of the month 
 I bought you a phone so you ain't gotta curse at me once 
 Just hit me on the jack, shorty leave me a message 
 I promise that I holla at you before I hit Texas 
 You gotta understand the game I'm in 
 I'm tryna get this money, you tryna cage me in 
 I can't be locked, baby girl I can't be stopped 
 Being in the same hood for one day is a lot 
 It's different things seein' different area codes 
 Picture Term tryna settle down and marry a hoe 
 While I'm here, relax and just kick it 
 'Cause when I roll out, know it's a one way ticket 
 I'm gone
