For the world, world, world 
 My name is Common, No I.D 
 Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers 
 Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us 
 Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now 
 Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now 
 Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now 
 Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now 
 We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love 
 It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up 
 Known to tear the club and the block up 
 Going through the airport with more lye than an opera 
 Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter 
 Get cleaners to get it cleaner 
 A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer 
 Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger 
 Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer 
 A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima 
 Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina 
 Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina 
 I'm a dreamer 
 It's for the world, world, world, world, world 
 Dream on 
 We take, uh, we make, uh, paper 
 And build skyscrapers 
 Walking on water, building my faith up 
 Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker 
 Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi 
 Survival of the fit with hope in they eye 
 Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding 
 They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them 
 Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them 
 Rock roles like a phantom 
 Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums 
 I tell them I need space like Richard Branson 
 Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars 
 And then pass out like a pamphlet 
 Never taking Grants for granted 
 It's Common, I'm high above standard 
 Fly nigga, keep my feet planted 
 To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic 
 Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic 
 I'm a dreamer 
 He introduced me, I stepped to the podium 
 Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one 
 Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second 
 The youth, the living resurrection 
 Reflections of the sun glaring through the window 
 Now the audience staring at my mental 
 Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers 
 'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers 
 Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream 
 To be like the king that sang Billie Jean 
 Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens 
 At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream 
 To the dreamers 
 If I dream you're here 
 And you dream I'm there 
 We'll be nowhere near 
 You should just come here 
 If I wake you up 
 Only difference is 
 You can live the dream 
 Just believe in it 
 (Maya Angelou) 
 Once you find your shoulders dropping 
 And your speech gets slow and hazy 
 You better change your way of being 
 Before you found your brain got lazy 
 You can build a better future when you join the winning team 
 If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream 
 Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you 
 Know that history holds more than it seems 
 We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream 
 From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships 
 And stood half naked on auction blocks 
 From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants 
 And were mis-named on Ellis island 
 From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops 
 From all over the world, they came to America 
 Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream 
 Let us dream for today and for tomorrow 
 Let us dare to dream
