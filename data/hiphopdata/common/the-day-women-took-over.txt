There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me 
 When people I ain't like is showin' love to me 
 Good food and the mood and the hood is free 
 Peace and free is the frequency 
 This is the day women took over 
 No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over 
 Imagine, war is now over 
 Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers 
 On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa 
 The mayor, the shah is Liz Dozier 
 Hoods feel safer, families feel closer 
 We all drunk in love with no need to be sober 
 Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice 
 You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest 
 Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless 
 We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again 
 Things are merry, there's more marryin' 
 Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian 
 For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows 
 Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes 
 It's more love songs from the radio 
 Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow 
 Egos aside, for each other we rise 
 Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive 
 Oh, when women take over the world 
 Oh, every woman, boy and girl 
 Oh, maybe one day, we will see 
 Peace and unity the way it's meant to be 
 The day women took over, let it continue 
 Now women get paid as much as men do 
 Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window 
 Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you 
 Body is a temple, men don't pray 
 Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay 
 Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer 
 Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer 
 Harriet, a soldier of truth is marchin' on 
 Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm 
 Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins 
 Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin' 
 No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters 
 After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber 
 The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters 
 And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted 
 In court, kids can't be tried as adults 
 And women, they called B's because they a boss 
 In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized 
 Goddess and queens is what we use to describe 
 Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution 
 Beyoncé made the music for the revolution 
 Imagine it, a world more compassionate 
 The malice of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if 
 Oh, what if women took over the world 
 Oh, every woman, boy and girl 
 Oh, maybe one day, we will see 
 Peace and unity the way it's meant to be
