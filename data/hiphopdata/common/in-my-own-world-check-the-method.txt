Extra P: 
 Yeah yeah, now check the method 
 Yeah yeah, now check the method 
 Yeah yeah, now check the method 
 Yeah yeah, now check the method 
 No I.D.: 
 No time to get all excited, just write it 
 From the inside let the pen slide, and spread 
 The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (What?) 
 Paint the canvas, givin' you my vision 
 To mold you, compose you 
 Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure 
 Words out my cipher, the life of my circle 
 Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me 
 You want me in your needle 
 Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch 
 I excite your brain till I'm out of your system 
 Beat digger, not a nigger or a negro I figure you're the winner of the bread 
 Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head (Yo kid kinda nice) 
 From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise 
 Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight 
 And then fight the night 
 With a light to gain sight make your competition say, "Aight" 
 No I.D. from the city with a beach on thirty-first 
 Makin' all butt crews disperse, I'm in my own world 
 No I.D. and Extra P: 
 I'm in my own world (Yeah yeah, now check the method) 
 I'm in my own world (Yeah yeah, now check the method) 
 I'm in my own world (Yeah yeah, now check the method) 
 (Check the method) I'm in my own world 
 Common: 
 I say pay attention boy, I say UHH looka here 
 I want you to see me when you do you look and fear 
 I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina 
 My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture 
 When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me 
 I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me 
 Cheap-ass niggas, go and purchase it 
 I ain't do all this work for shit 
 My style's my child I gave birth to it 
 Like an immaculate conception, clean I came 
 Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name 
 I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes 
 It's a jungle out there but I'm never fevering for them white hoes 
 I love black thighs, you sisters better realize 
 The real hair and real eyes get real guys 
 So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind 
 I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like 
 "I can't believe it, I got shot" 
 Bo so I lick one, not for Riddick 
 But I got the Rid, for my dick 
 And the crab MCs that be all over it 
 Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb? 
 I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall 
 I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel 
 I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in 
 Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in 
 I be like, "You don't know me fool" 
 And color it purple, 'cause he ain't in my circle 
 Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out, I'm in my own world
