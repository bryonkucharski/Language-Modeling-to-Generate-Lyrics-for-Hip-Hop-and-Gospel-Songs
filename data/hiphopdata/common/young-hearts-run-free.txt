Common 
 : 
 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 I put the line down when I put the rhyme down 
 Lost on my own Stoney Island that I'm found 
 I ride around town like this is my town 
 Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound 
 Kinda arrogant 'cause I'm from Chi Town 
 East bound and down, that's how we get down 
 At the bar taking shots like they live rounds 
 My lifestyle is it's good to be alive now 
 Lot that surround me, places all cloudy 
 Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy 
 You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi 
 Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey 
 Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle 
 Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up 
 Think about the come up 
 That's why I'm always on edge when the fans seem to run up 
 Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together 
 But when the weather change, lady friend 
 You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur 
 Yeah I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh 
 I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga 
 Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor 
 The rich get richer, my dick get bigger 
 'Cause I'mma go hard, g-go g-go hard 
 The more I know self, the more I know God 
 Coppin' land from my bro Monar 
 Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate 
 Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit 
 In touch with the crib that's why you feel this shit 
 The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow 
 The willingness to know that I don't know shit 
 James Fauntleroy 
 : 
 But I still wanna know 
 What the fuck you on girl 
 Common 
 : 
 Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do 
 It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen 
 I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream 
 Now I'm a Champagne King like Evelyn 
 Young hearts run free and forever sing 
 Yeah 
 James Fauntleroy 
 : 
 Tell me what the fuck you on 
 Cause your heart is sayin' oh, oh, oh - run

 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the drill 
 State of the mind, state of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 State of the art, state of the mind 
 State of the city 
 I contemplate and rewind 
 It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed 
 Love shed, 'nough said 
 James Fauntleroy 
 : 
 But I still wanna know 
 What the fuck you're on 
 Cause your heart is sayin' oh, oh, oh - run 
 And I'm down to jump the gun with you 
 Tell me what the fuck you want 
 Cause your heart is sayin' oh, oh, oh - run 
 And I'm down to jump the gun with you 
 What the fuck I'm s'possed to do, you not around 
 I'm not talkin' 'bout when you're high I mean on the ground 
 Always hold you down in and outta town 
 Maybe I'm a clown got me crying out in front the crowd 
 On the inside but it feel like a fuckin' cloud 
 Out my fuckin' mind, I'mma fuckin' drown 
 Girl but I'm not gonna fuck around 
 I'mma fuckin' marry you and learn to swim 
 Let me carry you I need to hit the gym 
 Young hard jab but the difference is 
 Got young love but I'm not young 
 Faith in love but I'm not dumb 
 I don't need to give a fuck about the outcome 
 Niggas be scared but I'm not one (x5)
