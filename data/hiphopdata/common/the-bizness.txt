And and bass up the track a little bit 
 'Cause I I'm here I want to hear that boom bish boom knowhatI'msayin? 
 Yeah yeah you know the bizness 
 Common Sense soul with the De La 
 Get all them play ahs 
 We the rhyme sayers 
 Huh and that's the bizness hah 
 Gonna do it like this 
 Gettin' it that 
 Like the Chicago streets 
 I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high 
 Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale lye/lie 
 Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses 
 So I can earn the acres (uh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh) 
 Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex 
 The engine to my comprehension is just too complex 
 Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das 
 Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos 
 And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin 
 They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin 
 I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter 
 'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after 
 I haveta, send respects to real money makers 
 Do not connect us with those champaign sippin money fakers 
 Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town 
 Now what that prove, you're so full you can't even move 
 'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink 
 Do you want to be a MC? Or do you want to serve 
 Do you want to be dope? Or do you want to deal it 
 Fabricated acryllic, I feel it, I'm the style molester 
 I do a show get Extra P's like the Large Professor 
 In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a 
 Refa-ree in soul control of my 
 Desti-ny, in the best of, three out of five 
 Whip ANYBODY ass at NBA Live, rappers 
 Take a dive like Greg Lougainis with his bitch-ass 
 Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the click with gators 
 Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner 
 I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (ahuh-hah!) 
 At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection 
 But then I got it back with the Resurrection, blessings 
 Upon rhymes old man who called him traitor 
 Big Com Stradamus niggaz styles I predict 
 'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink 
 I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't no other brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-you, the-G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 I'm the most from the coast of the East, then flee 
 Droppin' more knowledge than litter, on the New York peeve 
 It's me, wonder why, in the place to be 
 Certified, as superior, MC 
 While others explore to make it hardcore 
 I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door 
 'Cause these kids is rhyming, sometiming 
 And when we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see 
 The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling 
 My rhymes escalates like black death rates 
 Over music plates, being played as the rule 
 Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools 
 Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching 
 I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth 
 You reside, you're not even a man 
 So I don't seem it mandatory taking your pride 
 But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
 You cried "Keepin' it real", yet you should try keepin' it right 
 That's understanding microphone mathematics 
 Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
 And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
 This one will make that one into none 
 Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero 
 If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from 
 'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink 
 Now I'm the P-L-U, the-G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Yeah, and I'm the-see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Ah that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing huh 
 Like triple it, all right 
 That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago 
 The type of freestyler flow 
 Yeah, it's fluent, and we don't need to flow no more

 Let me tell you a little something about Soul (tell 'em son) 
 I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
 Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
 So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it till December 
 I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
 Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
 More money than a pagan holiday 
 Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say
