(Chorus: John Legend) 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory) 
 (Verse 1: Common) 
 Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon 
 Formed against, yes glory is destined 
 Every day women and men become legends 
 Sins that go against our skin become blessings 
 The movement is a rhythm to us 
 Freedom is like religion to us 
 Justice is juxtapositionin' us 
 Justice for all just ain't specific enough 
 One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us 
 True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us 
 That's why Rosa sat on the bus 
 That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up 
 When it go down we woman and man up 
 They say, "Stay down", and we stand up 
 Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up 
 King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory) 
 (Bridge: John Legend) 
 Now the war is not over, victory isn't won 
 But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done 
 We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory) 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory) 
 (Verse 2: Common) 
 Selma is now for every man, woman and child 
 Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd 
 They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now 
 Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles 
 From dark roads he rose, to become a hero 
 Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people 
 Enemy is lethal, a king became regal 
 Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle 
 The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful 
 We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through 
 Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany 
 Now we right the wrongs in history 
 No one can win the war individually 
 It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy 
 Welcome to the story we call victory 
 The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory 
 One day when the glory comes 
 It will be ours, it will be ours 
 One day when the war is won 
 We will be sure, we will be sure 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory) 
 Oh glory 
 (Glory, glory) Yeah (Glory, glory) 
 (Outro: John Legend) 
 When the war is won, when it's all said and done 
 We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)
