Gluttony, baby 
 To me, it's what I see 
 Gluttony, baby 
 Is us, it's hard to see 
 It's knocking 
 Gluttony, baby 
 To me, it's what I see 
 Man, they gon', they gon' 
 Man they gon' knock this 
 And ride out to this 
 It sit deep in my chest, so let me express 
 Grew up on 868, oh, y'all don't need the address 
 It was 'round CVS, we were so devious 
 The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest 
 The streets was a mess, and they still are 
 Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed 
 But the game is the game, so let it begin 
 In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins 
 Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity 
 A hustler's insanity can break up the family 
 Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change 
 Knowing that he'll end up in a grave 
 It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans 
 Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting 
 Like the second is something we all have 
 Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath 
 I seen a boss take it out on his staff 
 Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath 
 Never seen a man making money while he mad 
 So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math 
 Now the third, you probably heard from MOP 
 They say use them rocks to make 'em envy 
 Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony 
 When niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity 
 They hate it, to see you celebrated 
 Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it 
 Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth 
 Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth 
 Want you to break 'em off, getting money it costs 
 For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off 
 Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat 
 It's gluttony, this is how it happens on the street 
 It's a dude that's getting paid in full, cars and jewels 
 So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move 
 He is never full and he gon' want your food 
 Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule 
 The sixth is a fix that's in all of us 
 When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust 
 When the drawers go down, the guards go down 
 Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now 
 Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe 
 Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed 
 Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of 'em ended up bustin' the other 
 Greed is a mother, it's greedy motherfuckers like Madoff 
 Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off 
 Before I sign off, in the sins we livin' 
 The good thing is we can be forgiven 
 Seven deadly sins
