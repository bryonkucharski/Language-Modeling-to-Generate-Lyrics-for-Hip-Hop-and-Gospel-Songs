Check it on the one, you Com is gonna come (X3) 
 And check it out, ha. 
 My raps do laps around tracks to the days 
 The idiot vibin', I'm the comma comma Chamelion 
 I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray 
 It had maxed, I was with bitches that had coochie 
 Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters, looking harder than niggas 
 Hoes wore clothes, that exposed their figures 
 Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come 
 Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one 
 We come to the get together with whatever 
 You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together 
 Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to 
 The next cue, let's do it again y'all 
 That was when mad was tall and phat was cold 
 The days of Old Chicage and Fun Town and shorties we run round 
 Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now 
 And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town 
 Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair 
 I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our 
 Liquior 
 (Who?) Our neighborhood father figure 
 I'm out with my crew, ain't nothin' to do but ah, 
 "Niggas be rollin'" - Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck 
 Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I 
 "Niggas be rollin'" 
 Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um 
 "Niggas be rollin'" 
 We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um 
 "Niggas be rollin'" 
 I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style 
 Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats 
 And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines 
 We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme 
 It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop 
 Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot 
 Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion 
 Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5 
 Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket 
 Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet 
 Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties 
 Would be hot as hell and house stud would get "Find a body!" 
 Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare 
 I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there 
 Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes 
 Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop 
 With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division 
 (I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work 
 Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt 
 I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tonemaster 
 I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster 
 Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap 
 You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act 
 What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit 
 Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full 
 My drink there was Boons and Red Bull 
 I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool 
 I thought I was cool, with my "members only" and a bold fade 
 Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade 
 And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags 
 Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas 
 And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call 
 When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie 
 Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot
