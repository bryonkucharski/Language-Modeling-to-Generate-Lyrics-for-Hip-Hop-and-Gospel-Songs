(Yeah, for your nation... 
 For your nation...) 
 A bitch Nigga wit an Attitude named Cube 
 Step to Com wit a feud 
 Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast 
 You ain't made shit dope since "AmeriKKKa's Most" 
 Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 
 On the dick of the East for your 1st release 
 Your lease is up at the crib, house niggaz get evicted 
 And videos wit white boys talking you get "Wicked" 
 "Natural Born Killa?" Nigga, you natural born God! 
 Read, "Lench", got the nerve to say you "Mob" 
 Hypocrite, I'm filling out your "Death Certificate" 
 Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
 Shoulda repented on the 16th of October 
 Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
 Rap career is over, better off acting 
 What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 
 You backed in to a four corner hustla 
 Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin' her 
 Use "Higher Learning", don't take my words out of text 
 Went from gangsta to Islam to the dicks of Das EFX 
 "It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back" From giving you mouth shots 
 Or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 
 Chris Tucker ain't around, it's your "Friday", it was "good" 
 "I wasn't salty, she was wit the 'Boyz N the Hood'" 
 I see the bitch in yoo when you don't speak your mind 
 The bitch in yoo is looking me in my eyes lyin' 
 I see the bitch in yoo is simply hard to find 
 The bitch in yoo is coming out 
 The ump of this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
 I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 
 This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 
 I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 
 There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
 Grafted ass nigga, I see through your "Glass Shield" 
 Had skills "once upon a time on this project", yo 
 I'm a have to wreck a Ho'shea 
 I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
 (So what) so I had to slap her 
 And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 
 Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
 I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit to ATL 
 Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 
 It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
 A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
 Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable 
 "Hoo Bangin'?" You ain't banging shit but the table 
 And the Circle Madd ain't got no choice but to fight 
 Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic 
 Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 
 Until you let "that bitch in yoo" walk up out yoo 
 Any last words before I hit the switch? 
 From the immortal words of one: "A Bitch iz a (Bitch)" 
 I see the bitch in yoo when you don't speak your mind 
 The bitch in yoo is looking me in my eyes lyin' 
 I see the bitch in yoo is simply hard to find 
 The bitch in yoo... but yo it's coming out
