Yeah, this for the people 
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin' in they regal, tryin' to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Premo 
 'Ye you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 And the struggles of the brothas and the folks 
 With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes 
 Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder 
 Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr 
 While white folk focus on dogs and yoga 
 My people on the low end tryin' to ball and get over 
 Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers 
 From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture 
 Everyday we hustlin, tryin' to get them custom rims 
 Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lustin them 
 Sick and tired of punchin it, I look on the bus at them 
 When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them 
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin' in they regal, tryin' to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 The people said that I was sharp on TV 
 At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me 
 Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie 
 He said no matter what, the people gonna see me 
 Can't leave rap alone the streets need me 
 Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me 
 Inside peace mixed with beef seem to breed me 
 Nobody believe, until I believe me 
 Now I'm on the rise doin' business with my guys 
 Visions realize, music affected lives 
 A gift from the skies, to be recognized 
 I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize 
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find 
 This is street radio, for unsung hero 
 Ridin' in they regal, tryin' to stay legal 
 My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo 
 Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people 
 From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana 
 I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama 
 Standin in front of the judge with no honor 
 My raps ignite the people like Obama 
 The karma of the streets is needs and takes 
 Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks 
 Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake 
 Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake 
 The People 
 The days, have come 
 Now we, are one 
 Just take, your time 
 And then, you'll find
