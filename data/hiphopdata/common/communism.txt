Yo Troy I'ma come on the rhythm 
 With a little bit of Communism 
 Yeah, hah 
 So check it out, yeah 
 Chick-a chick-a I'm 
 Chick-a chick-a on 
 Chick-a chick-a my 
 My, own shit 
 Like an entrepreneur, that stepped in maneur 
 Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill 
 And Jack chills big bootay 
 But then the booty up, I told the bitch she better have my money 
 Or step to the AMG 
 You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be 
 That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds 
 But since then, Common calm down! 
 I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated 
 Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated 
 Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain 
 On my brain no complain and so will my community 
 And I prefer compliments 
 So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees 
 It's the 1990s, and music got known for grease 
 I got a sense of direction and a compass 
 Come past MC's with compassion, though I heard the screams of 
 But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort 
 Commiserate at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill 
 But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals 
 Now Com can get the panty, but I want my own company 
 And Com is on a mission not to work for commission 
 It's a common market and it's so much competition 
 But to me, competition is none 
 To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot 
 My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it 
 Instead of competing with Pete 
 Com compromised, Com made a promise 
 Not to commercialize, but compound the soul 
 Without the elements, compelling sense into Communism
