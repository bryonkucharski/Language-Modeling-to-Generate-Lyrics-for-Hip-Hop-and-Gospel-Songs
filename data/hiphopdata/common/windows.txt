(Hook: James Fauntleroy) 
 If your eyes are the window to your soul 
 Open eyes bring the cold 
 If your dreams keep you warm in night 
 Baby just keep 'em closed 
 If your eyes are the window 
 I can sneak in at night 
 In your eyes I can see your soul 
 Staring back into mine 
 (Verse 1: Common) 
 She was a beautiful rose 
 From the concrete and heat she grows 
 In the dark room her life was exposed 
 Her picture of men, we walk on all fours 
 Heart opened and heart closed 
 Every now and then she sparkles 
 You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose 
 I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose 
 Even when the door close, there grows a new one 
 I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one 
 Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him 
 Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run 
 Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian 
 I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision 
 But not to be married with kids she was wishing 
 Shhh, till your soul just listen 
 (Verse 2: Common) 
 She said daddy take me ice-skating 
 Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her 
 Gotta be there to support her 
 Can't really wait for a court order 
 She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant 
 A lot of love inside, got to help guide it 
 Daddy will protect it, God will provide it 
 We all will be there so your soul ain't divided 
 Man, how quick she grows 
 Looking like her momma but she got my toes 
 I suppose it's the age that she really really need me 
 A lot of girls without, they become needy 
 "Como on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat 
 Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?" 
 As she begins the race of life and love I told her 
 "I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya"
