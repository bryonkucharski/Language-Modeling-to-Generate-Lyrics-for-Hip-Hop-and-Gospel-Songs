Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 Ghetto dreams 
 Ghetto niggas' dreams 
 From the hood 
 (Verse 1: Common) 
 I want a bitch that look good and cook good 
 Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood 
 Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes 
 Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes 
 We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake 
 Fucking in the car 'cause we just can't wait 
 To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned 
 Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible 
 The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for 
 Is the type that I ride to stay alive for 
 Tats on her back, looking all tribal 
 She know shoes like she know survival 
 Well put together, she weathers the storm 
 Seen her brother die so forever she's strong 
 Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform 
 Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on 
 (Verse 2: Common) 
 I don't even say shit, she can feel it 
 Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic 
 Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it 
 Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet 
 Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony 
 Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia 
 Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana 
 Reminded me a me of my, of my mama 
 Knowing the drama like she know when to joke 
 Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke 
 I poke my head out of Benzes 
 My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is 
 Endless love for the money, power and clothes 
 My ghetto housewife watch reality shows 
 She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed 
 When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose 
 (Verse 3: Nas) 
 I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes 
 Subject matter be changing too quickly at times 
 So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story 
 Call me a pro in the pussy category 
 Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention 
 For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction 
 Powerful women playing the roles of submission 
 Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin' 
 Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic 
 They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted 
 Till I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit 
 Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence 
 But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra 
 African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor 
 Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors 
 Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours 
 She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals 
 Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors 
 Half hood half class, photographers' cameras 
 Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this 
 She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit 
 Events having sponsored have some alcohol product 
 Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms 
 You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
