La, la, la, la, la â€" and e'rybody say 
 La, la, la, la, la â€" I know you, I know you... 
 I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be 
 Armorall flow 'cause he never get rusty 
 I ain't gotta say it, man dawg trust me 
 Bust somebody head, T.L.C. where was we? 
 Still rock the prada 'fore that, rock the Starter 
 Niggas out in Georgetown, the Magic way harder 
 Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up 
 Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up 
 We coming from the... 
 South (side), South (side) 
 South (side), South (side) 
 South (side), South (side) 
 South (side), Side of the Chi 
 The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars 
 I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars 
 Burn CD's with no regard for the stars 
 Come to the grip with conflict, diamonds and the arts 
 Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas 
 Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods 
 We even yo, you're still talking no cause 
 A conscious nigga with Mac like Steven Jobs 
 Your fly is open, McFly 
 The crowd is open I think I know why 
 I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes 
 And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi 
 Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon 
 I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons 
 Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes 
 People asking him, â€œDo you have any grey poupon?â€ 
 You in the building but the buildings falling 
 You wouldn't be ballin' if your name is Spalding 
 My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans 
 Back in school, y'all niggas you should call in August 
 Summer sun it goes down but I'm still revolving 
 Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling 
 If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin 
 With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling 
 With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera 
 Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas 
 Can't wait till they say, â€œYeah, he ran up at the Oscars.â€ 
 Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie 
 Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta 
 Mexican don't love it like it was for La Raza 
 But this is for the mobsters, Holla 
 We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters 
 Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel 
 Lean wit it, rock wit it, back like the disciples 
 Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle 
 You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle 
 Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael 
 Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku 
 I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do 
 Through conflict that's crucial and drama that's psycho 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la 
 La, la, la, la, la, la 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 We're coming from the... Hey! 
 *Scratches*.. spice it up (la, la, la..) 
 Ya might have to spice it up 
 Spice it up, spice it up, 
 Take your life and... 
 Yo, we're coming from the... Hey! 
 We're coming from the... Hey! 
 ...And this concludes our Chicago show
