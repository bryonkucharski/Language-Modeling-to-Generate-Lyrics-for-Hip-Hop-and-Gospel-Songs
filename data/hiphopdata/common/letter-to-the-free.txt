Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from 
 Barren souls, heroic songs unsung 
 Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone 
 Tied with the rope that my grandmother died 
 Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions 
 Since slave days separating, fathers from children 
 Institution ain't just a building 
 But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them 
 We ain't seen as human beings with feelings 
 Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing! 
 For now we know, the new Jim Crow 
 They stop, search and arrest our souls 
 Police and policies patrol philosophies of control 
 A cruel hand taking hold 
 We let go to free them so we can free us 
 America's moment to come to Jesus 
 Freedom (Freedom) 
 Freedom come (Freedom come) 
 Hold on (Hold on) 
 Won't be long (Won't be long) 
 Freedom (Freedom) 
 Freedom come (Freedom come) 
 Hold on (Hold on) 
 Won't be long (Won't be long) 
 The caged birds sings for freedom to bring 
 Black bodies being lost in the American dream 
 Blood of black being, a pastoral scene 
 Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13 
 Not whips and chains, all subliminal 
 Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal' 
 Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country 
 Shot me with your ray-gun 
 And now you want to trump me 
 Prison is a business, America's the company 
 Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering 
 We staring in the face of hate again 
 The same hate they say will make America great again 
 No consolation prize for the dehumanized 
 For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives 
 And we gonna free them, so we can free us 
 America's moment to come to Jesus
