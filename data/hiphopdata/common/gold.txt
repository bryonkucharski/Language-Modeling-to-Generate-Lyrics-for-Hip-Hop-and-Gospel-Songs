So we made it to this same end of the road 
 And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold 
 How I made it out with my soul 
 Ashtrays and cigarettes, last days, indigenous people 
 These are adventures of young black millionaires 
 I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged 
 The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this 
 On the move like black slaves through the wilderness 
 I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases 
 When I was born, three wise men came to visit us 
 One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner 
 They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts 
 You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this 
 Show the walking dead who the true and living is 
 Separate the fake from who the real reals is 
 Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris 
 Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis 
 Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings 
 I guess it's my addiction to women 
 I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending 
 Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams 
 Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian 
 On the mic, victorious, story is redemption 
 I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone 
 I'm standing here with my soul 
 Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves 
 Teach a man to cook it for survival 
 My dad said it rained on my arrival 
 Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow 
 Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo 
 On the rock and roll with the coldest live show 
 For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em 
 Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low 
 This is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow 
 It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics 
 Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival 
 Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido 
 Crash parties, any live yo 
 Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang 
 From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow 
 Ali MC, I fight for more than the title 
 Your idol
