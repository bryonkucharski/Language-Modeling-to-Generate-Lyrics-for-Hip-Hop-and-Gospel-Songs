 Yo, even if you don't dance, rock to this 
 Let your pants sag, stand up and block to this 
 Come on mami, relieve stress, you don't need rest 
 So while the niggers lay cash, you chicks shake ass 
 If you're floatin' real high 
 And you feelin' the vibe 
 Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me 
 If you're feeling the groove 
 It ain't knocking for you 
 So just get on the floor and just dance for me 
 And I know you been stressed 
 That's how we got you messed up 
 Get on the floor and just dance for me 
 Just be here and you'll jump 
 So stay here till it close 
 And stay up on the floor and just dance for me 
 Hey, I know it's been rough 
 But I'm tryin' to make it easy 
 For everybody to dance for me 
 So come one, come all, come everybody 
 Me and you, all of us 'bout to really party 
 And you know that we're gonna put it down 
 After two more drinks, we'll be feelin' the sound 
 Get off the wall 'cause I know that you can feel me 
 Stop the fronting and dance for me 
 So come one, come all, come everyone 
 And me and you, all of us, by the way we party 
 And you know that we're gonna put it down 
 After four more drinks we'll be fallin' down 
 Leave all your troubles and your cares behind 
 Don't you worry 'bout a thing, not tonight, no 
 Don't drink too much because we have all night 
 Don't you rush because it's all night long 
 (Ahkim) 
 Yeah, yeah, yo 
 Party time, pull the Linx out, get the minks out 
 Or come ghetto, but just dance to the music 
 Feel the vibe, I'll throw up your hands and loose it 
 You say you ball till you fall 
 Well it's your chance to prove it 
 You on hand till the sun up 
 And the pounds of smoke, bottles is empty 
 And I got them models in the Bentley 
 And six simply when I bounce in the club 
 Around thugs that smoke ounces of blunt 
 Cop cases of Cris', pop till they can't taste the shit 
 But hell, what's the major event 
 Real niggas, real broads, ill cars, hot rims 
 Sedan Coupes, SUV's, to the drop Benz 
 From the outside in, the party rock 
 We just started and we ain't tryin' to hardly stop 
 From the Bellvedere to the Bacardi shots 
 Just dance ma, 'cause you know the bar hot
