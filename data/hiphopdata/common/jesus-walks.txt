Order, Huh 
 Yo, We at war 
 We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves 
 (Jesus Walks) 
 God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down 
 (Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me) 
 You know what the Midwest is? 
 Young and Restless 
 Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace 
 And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus 
 Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is 
 I walk through the valley of Chi where death is 
 Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless, 
 Try to catch it, it's kinda hard 
 Getting choked by detectives- yeah, yeah- now check the method 
 They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us 
 Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!" 
 Huh?! y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis? 
 We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases 
 A trunk full of coke- rental car from Avis 
 My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us 
 Well Mama, I know I act a fool 
 But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope 
 (Jesus Walks) 
 God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down 
 (Jesus Walks with me) 
 The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus) 
 (Jesus Walks) 
 And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs 
 (Jesus Walks with me) 
 I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long 
 (I want Jesus) 
 God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down 
 The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now 
 And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs 
 I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long... so long 
 So long 
 (Jesus Walks with me) 
 To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers 
 (Jesus walks for them) 
 To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah 
 (Jesus walks for them) 
 Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly 
 I know He hear me when my feet get weary 
 'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct 
 We rappers are role models- we rap we don't think 
 I ain't here to argue about his facial features 
 Or here to convert atheists into believers 
 I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers 
 The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus 
 So here go my single dog radio needs this 
 They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus 
 That means guns, sex, lies, video tape 
 But if I talk about God my record won't get played 
 Huh? 
 Well let this take away from my spins 
 Which will probably take away from my ends 
 Then I hope this take away from my sins 
 And bring the day that I'm dreaming about 
 Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out 
 (Jesus Walks) 
 God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
 (Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me) fades) 
 The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
