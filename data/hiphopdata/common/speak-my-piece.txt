 I'm iller than most, sick with it, feeling the dose 
 In a butter soft leather but I'm still with the toast 
 Toast to bros, you know the millions is close 
 Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughtiest 
 She get live like an audience 
 I do what I do, no need to state the obvious 
 Poli' with girls with bodies, uh 
 Poli' in hotel lobbies 
 Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster 
 Do what I supposed to for the culture 
 Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy 
 My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoy 
 'Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day 
 All that whoop-de-wah-whoop, man fuck what they say 
 Played the lotto for my gram with a bottle in hand 
 Lay it down for the world, for Chicago I stand, and 
 I just, speak my piece, keep my peace

 Yeah, yeah, they like that, I write raps from on top of the world 
 Popular girls always wanna pop in my world 
 I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay 
 In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid 
 Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while 
 You know I won't front with the style 
 Bring life to the party like a woman and child 
 From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild 
 Ah! Made the unmade-able 
 Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go 
 Me and cuzzo talked the hustle 
 About doing good business like Rick and Russell 
 You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time 
 On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time 
 My time, the streets is watching like a Rollie 
 Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh 
 I just, speak my piece, keep my peace 
 Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
