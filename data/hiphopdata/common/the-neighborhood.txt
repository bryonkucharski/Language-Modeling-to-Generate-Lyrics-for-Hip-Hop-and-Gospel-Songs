James Fauntleroy 
 : 
 Thousand lives ago 
 We were young and we didn't know 
 We were trading our crowns for our souls 
 Made the sacrifice 
 Headed back to the light 
 But be careful don't drown in the gold 
 I know it glows but it's cold 
 I'm from the other side of town 
 Out of bounds 
 To anybody who don't live around 
 I never learned to share or how to care 
 I never had no teachings about being fair 
 Common 
 : 
 Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones? 
 And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces 
 The concrete matrix, street organizations 
 They gave violations, hood public relations 
 It was the basics to get big faces 
 Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces 
 The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters 
 They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us 
 The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush 
 Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush 
 I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci 
 A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey 
 Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope 
 Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope 
 Rare jewels of a generation 
 Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin' 
 Forties wasted on 'ceased, Dion makin' the beats 
 When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat 
 I could break it down like whatever you need 
 He squinted his face and rolled the weed 
 You know they don't see sometimes 
 That in the neighborhood 
 It's the exact same thing 
 It's the same thing over and over again 
 Feel me?

 : 
 Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred? 
 Folly boy, O block, eastside 
 Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride 
 Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'? 
 Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying 
 Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign 
 I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times 
 Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine 
 I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind 
 I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up 
 But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper 
 Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major 
 Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us 
 No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit 
 Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with 
 Better watch out for that jump shot 'cause they will hit 
 Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit 
 I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it 
 Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean 
 You ain't never seen the shit that I seen
