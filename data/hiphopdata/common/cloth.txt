We were from different cities on the same block 
 Grew up in different circles in the same spot 
 Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all 
 Showing her ring off like a player at the ball 
 I recall the walls that I had up 
 Attracted to women for things that didn't matter 
 Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop 
 The night that I met her, it might be forever 
 I hear people saying that they like us together 
 I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better 
 With you, I admit I had issues 
 Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence 
 It's more than clothes can say for you 
 When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you 
 I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust 
 And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust 
 From the cloth 
 Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare 
 That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear 
 Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear 
 But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh 
 La la la la, la la la la 
 This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug 
 Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs 
 You were there when my 'cause passed away 
 Not only does love, but life hatches day 
 I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you 
 Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you 
 Looking at things that we've been through 
 Things that seem simple 
 I know when to go hard and when to be gentle 
 Sentimental laughs and expressions 
 Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing 
 You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked 
 The truth we address it, that's so unexpected 
 Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead 
 Your hunger for affection will always be fed 
 Thank God we never sped and let love take its course 
 'Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource 
 The cloth 
 Hey lover we can cover each other 
 Through the coldest nights, tight never smother 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's two things that seems to hold us together 
 God is our tailor and forever 
 It's the cloth
