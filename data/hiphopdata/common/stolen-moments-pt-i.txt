Common: 
 Down da down da down down down what (x3) 
 Down da down check it check it 
 There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin' to solve 
 Can't understand who the fuck was involved 
 Back from a show I had came hopped off the plane 
 In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame 
 My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy 
 Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby 
 As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built 
 By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled 
 I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart nailed 
 In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt 
 My mind started swingin' and who I thought the glove fit 
 As usual, niggaz is suspects 
 Who did I tell I was going out of town 
 Not too many people, I guess the word got around 
 The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound 
 Must have came during the day when at work, they was found 
 At the mount I stand folded than tie 
 Askin who done it 
 Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked 
 About to go wild hunted 
 Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted 
 And left a roach in the ash tray, I had cleaned out the last day 
 Before I left, this thief decided to play chef 
 With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast 
 I'm kickin what shit was left all around the house 
 Thinkin' whoever came in on me is out 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, yes it is 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, hear me now 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, yes it is 
 (What can I do?) 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation, hear me y'all 
 (What can I do?)
