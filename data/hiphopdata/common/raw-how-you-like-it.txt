Bow! Bow! 
 I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela 
 Superstar status, everything stellar 
 With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers; niggas already jealous 
 We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers 
 She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous 
 Go to the bar to get around like a propeller 
 The barmaid's name is Stella 
 I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me 
 Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party 
 Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah 
 Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah 
 Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah 
 Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha 
 Hmmmm! Well let me take my time 
 She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight 
 Seen that ass 'cause I got hindsight 
 She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight 
 'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt 
 She said "You rap?" Yeah mummy 
 I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money 
 Feels so good 
 I wanna touch somebody 
 So let's go, go 
 Wanna feel you close, keep touching 
 La la la la la, how you like it 
 She was all couture, in a Tom Ford 
 Security guard let me in 'cause I'm lord 
 Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress 
 Code is to always stay fresh 
 Aware of a chest 'cause I stay abreast 
 She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest 
 This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess 
 Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled 
 I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove 
 I won't have to take it back to high school 
 Rewind! No need to take me back in time 
 Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline 
 'Cause what's in front of me is this behind 
 Up north she's thick, down south she's fine 
 Tuned in to what I'm doing 
 I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing 
 The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade 
 Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me 
 Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady 
 Dude got foul like crack in the 80s 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo 
 You never know who got a Tec up in the disco 
 "You Hollywood." Nah nigga, I'm Chicago 
 So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle
