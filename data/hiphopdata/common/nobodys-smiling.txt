I'm from Chicago, nobody's smiling 
 Niggaz wyling on Stoney Island 
 Where the chief and the president come from 
 Pop out, pop pills, pop guns 
 On the deck when the ops come 
 Pop some, ops run 
 This ain't a game nigga, ain't no options 
 Niggaz sellin' on the block like an auction 
 Dig into my pockets, see a profit 
 Where the money and the bitches is where the gods is 
 Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot 
 Holdin' money, like a hostage 
 She went ostrich... from the projects with posture 
 I draw with the goddess like an artist 
 Gettin' paper with no margins, money gods 
 I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin, yo 
 In the Chi, ain't a damn thing funny 
 Thinkin' of ways to get money 
 Drive down Lake Shore, schemin' how to make more 
 If we ain't eatin' together, what is this cake for? 
 Ain't nobody givin' it, that's what we take for 
 Niggaz is broke, what I need a break for? 
 Glaciers of ice, lasers and lice 
 Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice 
 Made for the life, ball out like we out of bounds 
 Bars and guns, niggaz got a lot of rounds 
 Trippin' like you from out of town 
 The fo'-pound'll leave you on the ground without a sound 
 Ain't no fathers 'round, +Sons of Anarchy+ 
 Fightin' attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny 
 At the party with the thots with the extra body 
 I'm in the inner city, it's an out-of-body... experience 
 Face on T-shirts with no #hashtags 
 Just big-ass trash bags tagged hash 
 Out here, shit been trill 
 Fake-ass gangster, quick to take a fag's cash 
 Five versus six, Star Wars 
 No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors 
 Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's 
 Two trey 8's, and one fo'-fives 
 Tryna get to two-threes, the numbers game 
 Then here come the fame, but they won't say no names 
 Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town? 
 I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around 
 Popes, bishops, disciples, stones 
 Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings 
 They drillin' on my land but ain't no oil to be found 
 I might be part of the problem 
 I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up 
 Most of them can't e'en moonwalk 
 My lil' cousin Bump J don't know what he did when he introduced that goon talk 
 Is there a Scarface castin' at the crib I don't know about? 
 So many Shortys have tried out for the role 
 That's why he slide out and ride out with the pole 
 Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered 
 That black power didn't keep the lights on 
 Right on, the dearly departed still rappin' to you 
 Lookin' for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on 
 How long will they mourn me after I'm out of mind, out of sight, gone 
 A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most 
 G.O.O.D. Music in the building 
 Yeah we got ghost writers, they just actually ghosts
