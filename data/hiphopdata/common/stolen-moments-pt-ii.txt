Black Thought: 
 It's a frantic situation (x7) 
 Common: 
 Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch 
 And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me 
 Out of snappin, my God tried to talk me 
 But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song 
 The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone 
 But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket 
 This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down 
 Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around 
 Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin' smoked out 
 No tellin' who had the place scoped out 
 Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know 
 I'm askin, who are you, they said I'm with the Mo 
 If it was them, soon I will collide with them 
 And they better not be rockin' no new Iversons 
 Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow 
 If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know 
 Now, it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party 
 Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body 
 What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib 
 To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin' to believe 
 But I could have put it past him or those other bastards 
 It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it 
 'Cause whoever did ain't gon admit it 
 The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit 
 Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface 
 'Cause tellin' Allah, Joe is worthless (uh) 
 Chorus (x2): Black Thought 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are (x3) 
 Wherever you are, whoever you are
