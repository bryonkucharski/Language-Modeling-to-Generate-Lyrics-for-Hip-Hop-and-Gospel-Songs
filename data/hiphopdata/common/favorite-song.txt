I wanna be your favorite song 
 You can turn it up, play me all night long 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 We on our way back, we on a play back 
 We want some new plus oh never change that 
 We on a new tip, good music 
 We see the pen and the paper, we gonna use it 
 It takes a late night, to get them bright lights 
 We keep writing them songs, to live that good life 
 I do it for you, I do it for me 
 We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story 
 Listen can you hear me 
 Am I coming in on your frequency 
 I got a story 
 Subject of the plot, you and me 
 And when you're sleeping, and when you're waking 
 And when you're feeling good 
 I'll be the thing that, you want to sing back 
 Stuck in your head like I knew you would 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 You can turn it up, play me all night long 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 I wanna be your melody 
 Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 You'll be singing like 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Baby can you feel me 
 I'm the kick drum that gets your heart to beat 
 I gotta have you near me 
 You can count me into every song I sing 
 When you're sleeping, and when you're waking 
 And when you're feeling good 
 I'll be the one that you want to comeback 
 Stuck in your head like I knew I would 
 We on our way back, we on a play back 
 We on some new plus oh never change that 
 We on our way back, we on a play back 
 Play back play back play back play back 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 You can turn it up, play me all night long 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 I wanna be your melody 
 Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 You'll be singing like 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Girl the songs you sing 
 They my favorite things 
 You stay in my dreams 
 Something supreme 
 Love is the key, and it's made your life see 
 Common and Colbie, I'm dusting off the old me 
 Like the OLB we call 'em oldies 
 In your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me 
 We stay in tune with each other, 
 In our room we'll discover new ways to do covers, 
 No matter how they dub us 
 We should stay true to the trust 
 And the winner of the best duo is us 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 You can turn it up, play me all night long 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 I wanna be your melody 
 Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
 I wanna be your favorite song 
 La la la la la 
 You'll be singing like 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is 
 I just wanna sing it to you everyday 
 All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is 
 La la la la la 
 All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is 
 I just wanna sing it to you everyday 
 All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is 
 La la la la la
