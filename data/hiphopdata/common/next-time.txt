I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close 
 Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you 
 I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart 
 And I hope I die 
 The next time that I see you 
 A cloudy day in the Chi 
 I was downtown getting my license 
 Money ain't a thang but hey, fame is priceless 
 Waiting in line, yeah that's one of my vices 
 This lady recognized me and moved me through the line quick 
 To number one, said sign this for her son 
 I drew my name with a Bible and a gun 
 One of her coworkers had a cousin in rap 
 Can't knock his hustle, but I be doing him like (?) 
 In the back, they was playin' light jazz 
 Spotted this woman with light plus she had a bright ass 
 I was checking her out trying to act like I ain't checking her out 
 She could see that I was checking her out 
 On some Roy Ayers, we was vibing a bit 
 Told her my next album gonna be live with the hits 
 She did a skit on how she don't be dating rappers 
 Said I got my SAG card baby I'm an actor 
 And after the laughter I said, "naw for real" 
 She said, "naw for real, forreal?" 
 Some days it's the sun, some days it's the rain 
 Some chicks you forget, some stay in your brain 
 Somehow in my mind this broad still remain 
 Three days later, I'm about to get on the plane 
 In the security lane, the thing kept beeping 
 It's probably these hard raps that I be keeping 
 Speaking of the goddess, I picked up my metal objects 
 You know how you can bring to life what's in your conscience 
 Slim with the pompous attitude from the DMV 
 Happened to have a beautiful ass in front of me 
 Yup, I'm looking and she sort of took it in 
 That awkward moment of "damn, damn, that's him again" 
 I start telling her how beautiful her thoughts are 
 A man walked up, she said "this is Walter" 
 I looked at a little Walter as he stuck out his hand 
 Said since Borrow a Dollar, he been a fan 
 Said he met me at a show about four years ago 
 I'm thinking Goof Troop, I don't remember that shit 
 I told him that I didn't so I ended that quick 
 On the Ice Cube tip, like stay off my dick 
 And tell your chick to come here 
 Yeah, I gotta word I want to give to her ear 
 And it goes like 
 I can't be lusting another man's woman too long 
 I picked up my pride to the gate, I moved on 
 With the nike airs on, stepping into first class 
 Wondering why these flight attendants don't be having no ass 
 One asked if I wanted a drink 
 I laid back and just said naw I wanted to think 
 About how and why old girl was affecting me 
 Opened my eyes her and dude was right next to me 
 Was this destiny like the Jackson Five? 
 I was shocked inside, but I reacted live 
 Told her every time I think of her she actualize 
 I said fate baby ain't something to rationalize 
 Seen passion in her eyes as my words hit her 
 She said Walter wasn't her nigga, he just work with her 
 We dipped to the bathroom so she could try my love 
 Now she's a member of the mile high club
