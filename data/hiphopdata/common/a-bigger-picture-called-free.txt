Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle 
 The masked struggle that I'm in 
 The same one that you in 
 I knew inside when I was outside on the south side 
 Had to take it a step further 
 The way that Ralph tried 
 Oh that's my stepfather 
 He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors 
 For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose 
 Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros 
 Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed 
 To a bigger picture called free 
 In the picture, it was me 
 Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali 
 A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000 
 Telling me what I can't be 
 But you can't paint me 
 Black is the color of my true love spirit 
 And I do love lyrics 
 And I used to love Harold's Chicken 
 And I dance pretty good 
 And I feel at home in the hood 
 And I get lit in the club 
 Still I love 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9 
 The toughest in Cook County 
 They count me out 'cause I did a crime 
 They say it's violent time in human beings 
 But being they ain't seeing me as human 
 In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming 
 Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me 
 Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones 
 I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones 
 My pops, y'all built and destroyed him 
 With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment 
 When will we see enjoyment? 
 I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes 
 But we ain't never spent Christmas together 
 Tryna get it together 
 What I'ma do when I get out? 
 I don't know what it is to live out 
 Just reminiscing of the big house 
 I'm the one justice chose to spit out 
 My life story is written in a prison sentence 
 Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness? 
 Still I love 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside 
 When I look in the sky, I see freedom 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free 
 Make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I 
 Is the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free 
 Make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I 
 Is the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free 
 Make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I 
 Is the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah 
 It's gonna be you and me 
 When you're feeling free 
 Make you feel alive 
 What you got inside make you go outside 
 The change in I 
 Is the realest high 
 It's the realest high 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
