Here we go, here, here we go again 
 Trayvon'll never get to be an older man 
 Black children, they childhood stole from them 
 Robbed of our names and our language, stole again 
 Who stole the soul from black folk? 
 Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke 
 And made the whip crackle on our back slow 
 And made us go through the back door 
 And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks 
 Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots 
 Leaving our own to lay in a box 
 Black mother's stomachs stay in a knot 
 We kill each other, it's part of the plot 
 I wish the hating will stop (war) 
 And the battle with us 
 I know that Black lives matter and they matter to us 
 These are the things we gotta discuss 
 The new plantation, mass incarceration 
 Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids 
 As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is 
 Is it a felony or a misdemeanor? 
 Maria Sharapova making more than Serena 
 It took Viola Davis to say this 
 The roles of the help and the gangsters is really all they gave us 
 We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers 
 The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar 
 And greasy foods 
 I don't believe the news or radio, stereotypes we refuse 
 Brainwashed in the cycle to spin 
 We write our own story, black America again 
 You know... 
 One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got 
 Is lettin' a person feel that they're important 
 And a man can't get himself together 
 Until he knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is, 
 And where he come from, and where he come from 
 Hot damn, black America again 
 Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind 
 The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin 
 The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been 
 The hate the hate made, I inherited from them 
 But I ain't gon' point the finger, we got anointed singers 
 Like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie 
 Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me 
 Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac? 
 Drinking or battle raps or is it Godspeed that we travel at? 
 Endangered in our own habitat 
 The guns and dope man y'all can have it back 
 As a matter of fact, we them lab rats 
 You build the projects for, now you want your hood back 
 I guess if you could rap you would express it too 
 That PTSD, we need professionals 
 You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust 
 From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us 
 Tell your political parties invite us 
 Instead of making voting laws to spite us 
 You know, you know we from a family of fighters 
 Fought in your wars and our wars 
 You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two 
 And then, maybe then we'll believe you 
 See black people in the future 
 We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya 
 We hold these truths to be self evident 
 All men and women are created equal, including black Americans 
 You know, you know, you know. 
 One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got 
 Is to let a person feel like somebody 
 And a man can't get himself together 
 Until he knows who he is 
 And be proud of what and who he is 
 And where he come from, and where he come from
