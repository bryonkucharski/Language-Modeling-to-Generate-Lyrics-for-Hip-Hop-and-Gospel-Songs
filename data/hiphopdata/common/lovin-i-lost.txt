I remember (REPEATS) 
 I remember she sit there with her thickness 
 Never played a game but I heard about them sisters 
 A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha" 
 But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us 
 It was hard for me to take down the pictures 
 I was tripping, I even called her sister 
 I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day 
 But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way 
 I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J 
 'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay 
 Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now 
 We fell in love huh just to fall apart now 
 I get your calls and I try to disregard now 
 What was easy for us now is hard now 
 Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together 
 Now we not together, is this our new forever? 
 Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call 
 Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls 
 Issues that I had 
 Some say it comes from not seeing my dad 
 Keep moving on 
 Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch 
 Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch 
 Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up 
 Ass got me laid up, girl I never gave up 
 On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough 
 I know your young and you gotta live your life ma 
 I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya 
 I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest 
 So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless 
 Who do it better, we used to move together 
 Now we not together, is this our new forever?
