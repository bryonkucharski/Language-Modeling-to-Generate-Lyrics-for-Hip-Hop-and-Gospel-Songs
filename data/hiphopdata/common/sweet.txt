(Intro: Common) 
 You know they be asking 'bout Common, where he at? 
 What that man doing now? 
 I'm doing what I do, hip-hop 
 That's what I do 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1: Common) 
 How can I say this, fuck it I'm the greatest 
 I am the A-list for all these great debaters 
 A lot of y'all nah nah, forgot now who I am 
 The '87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam 
 Aw yeah, we put them things in the air 
 When I drop a single, it's really like a pair 
 Of Air Jordans, important to the culture 
 If you ain't true to it, cállate la boca 
 Get my drink on like a coaster 
 Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off 
 Hip-hop Master Cleansin', I'mma get my shit off 
 Rollin' in a Maserati Gran with the lid off 
 I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore 
 Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners 
 My name synonymous with prominence 
 I'm to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics 
 Common is 
 Yeah, man 
 Y'all niggas man, you soft muthafuckers 
 Yeah my man, muthafucker 
 Then come around my crib 
 You know where I'm from 
 Some ho ass niggas 
 Singing all around me man, la la la 
 You ain't muthafucking Frank Sinatra 
 Uh, lil' bitch 
 Yeah, this the raw right here 
 This the raw right here nigga 
 Sweet muthafucka 
 Sweet ass bitch muthafucka 
 (Verse 2: Common) 
 Wa da da da, wa dada dada dang 
 The C-O double-M O-N, I'm not playin' 
 Da da man at work, I make my own lane 
 I'm the franchise so I rock my own chain 
 No I said give 'em that 80′s cocaine 
 Somethin' raw, something pure so I stayed in that vein 
 The hero that he know, that he cold 
 Like when it's below in the G.O., wipe ya feet off in the Regal 
 I'm king, observe the throne and the dream 
 I have it, supreme like mathematics 
 Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts 
 Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic 
 Rap we won't jam in traffic 
 The game need direction, I'm here to map it 
 Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity 
 But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me 
 Sweet 
 (Outro: Common) 
 You know man, you should know where I come from 
 You should know who I am nigga 
 You should never wanna go against me 
 You know man, you too soft for that man 
 I be seeing you man, I see it in your eyes man 
 You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me 
 You get in my presence you gon' feel like a little ho 
 You ain't a man yet, you tryna be somebody else 
 Man, be yourself man, you come around my crib, you get your shit took 
 Huh! Wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo shit took 
 You's a ho, you know you sweet 
 Ain't nothing you can do man, people see that man 
 Broads be seeing you sweet 
 Done wit' you muthafuckas, it's over for you 
 It's over for you 
 It's over, sweet muthafucka
