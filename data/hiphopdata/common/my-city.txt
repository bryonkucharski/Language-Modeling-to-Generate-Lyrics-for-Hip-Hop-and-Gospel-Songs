(Featuring Mylik Yusef) 
 This the city of Chicago 
 The state of confusion 
 The style I'm using is free 
 Or at least it would be if my mind was 
 Peep I'm behind cause 
 I didn't handle my function while in high school 
 Although I was cool 
 The hood I live in ain't that proper 
 Cause a cop a stop ya 
 And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty 
 I'm not filthy 
 Nor am I rich 
 Ain't that a bitch 
 Like life is 
 Not your wife is 
 See that your better halve 
 Do your math 
 And peep that two halves make a whole 
 And all I have to hold 
 Is my self pride 
 So these streets I strive 
 Like a Black Panther 
 Asking can the 
 Situation get much worst 
 All I do is try to appeal to the masses 
 As the phrase keep it real passes 
 The teeth of too many phoney individuals 
 Snakes, that smooth like criminals 
 They create chemicals 
 That the Earth hate 
 Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate 
 I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait 
 Or at least my weight in precious gems 
 So I'm steadily steadly steadly 
 Trying to lose my religion, like R E M 
 Created in His own image so are we him? 
 And through all this crises 
 Shid (Shit) I wonder where Christ is 
 Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds 
 Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up 
 And Stone run it 
 Hunted by police for display in state vile cages 
 Come out to make minimum wages 
 And with a desiese that are contagious 
 It is fucking outrages 
 The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up 
 But the Most High encourages me to put the glock up 
 And Stock up on do for self knowledge 
 A brother couldn't afford to go to collage 
 So I had to learn form the school of hard knock 
 On the hard blocks of the Chi 
 Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks 
 As my liver soaks 
 In mad Hennesy 
 'Cause I got a bad tendency 
 To do a lot of drinking 
 Now I do a lot of thinking 
 Blinking, was your third eye 
 When you heard I 
 Was one of the chosen one 
 Industry doors keep closing 
 (Sing) Watch the closing doors 
 Niggas want a record deal 
 But can they deal with a record? 
 Cause once they get rich 
 They tend to switch 
 Like a sissy 
 Please miss me 
 With all that bullshit you popping 
 This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping 
 Even if you had one of them red octagon 
 Motherfuckers say Mylik how you make your living? 
 I say by breathing oxygen
