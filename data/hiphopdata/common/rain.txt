The wind against my face, tells me that I must go 
 Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me 
 When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA 
 So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 The last note I sang was indeed a false (?) 
 At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name 
 But I knew I could and work that (?) all on my dreams 
 They tell me find that place, find that place 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination 
 With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today 
 Constantly it's on my mind 
 I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration 
 Oh, I've got to cross this nation 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 As the rain falls down from the heavens 
 Think of how far I came since '87 
 Took my hustle and made it a weapon 
 I was always told "in the pain there's a blessing" 
 Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons 
 Talking with God, I asked clearer questions 
 Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for? 
 If so? Then what am I stressing for? 
 We tight, then why can't I let it go? 
 Everything gon' be all right, it's more than a metaphor 
 Let it rain 'cause it's ancestral 
 Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you 
 Let it rain and come down visceral 
 For those no longer here in the physical 
 Let it rain 'cause it's like tears from you 
 Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do 
 Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful 
 So that it can service you and return to you 
 Let it rain, let the rain surround me 
 And never drown me, I was lost when it found me 
 Now in a dream is where I'll be 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Now in a dream is where I'll be 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Imperial reign came down to crown me 
 Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be 
 And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain
