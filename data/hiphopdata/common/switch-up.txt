Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it 
 I look up, I said I think it's time to kill it 
 Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me 
 I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly 
 Tell her make me a sandwich, no pb and jelly 
 She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?" 
 I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah whoa" 
 That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too 
 She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do 
 Power of the revenue got me up 2 to 10, and 10 to 2 
 I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor 
 So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR 
 Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR 
 Everyday the day date, gang bang major pain 
 D-Town I ride around, me and my dog like Charlie Brown 
 Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's 
 On a day to day to day base, then vacay for eight days, ooh 
 You know mutha fuck taking a vacation 
 Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation 
 Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation 
 Full glass of champagne, oh no, you can't taste it

 Seen Hoes (switch up)

 Bought a Cadillac, now I'm Cadillac Com

 Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean 
 Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom 
 Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down 
 South side my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around (Oww) 
 I'm in my mode today, sayin' what the fuck I'm 'posed to say 
 Moving making money, got them trash bags back 
 Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweeter and I'll eat her 
 Got strippers and Divas, Plus some Cougars and Cheetahs 
 Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Benita 
 I said ease up, ease up, ease up 
 Ain't anybody fucking with my clique 
 And all these bad bitches man, they want the 
 All I care bout's my crew, my family and women 
 Except these women that's hoeing, and these hoes that be stealing 
 Trying to get them a cut, that's how you end up with stitches 
 I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position 
 Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward 
 I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe 
 If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I don't 
 Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash, 
 Smile for the Polaroid, self-employed 
 Now you shelf employed, D-Boy 
 Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy 
 And I'm with the same crew until I'm a old man 
 'Cause there no such thing as new old friends 
 I seen cars (switch up) 
 Seen hoes (switch up) 
 Seen money all switch up 
 When the days get dimmer 
 Who gon' leave you there and who gon' leave with ya 
 This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
