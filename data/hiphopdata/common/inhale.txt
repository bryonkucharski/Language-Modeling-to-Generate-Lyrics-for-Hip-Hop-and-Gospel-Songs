[Scratches] Inhale 
 I breathe deep 
 Like an old man in a deep sleep 
 Or an Indian peace pipe 
 Identity be 
 The beginning, the end, the first, the last 
 Breathe into infinity 
 A verse that lasts 
 Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast 
 When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?) 
 The hunger of a homeless 
 Microphonus 
 Played the game - it got a bonus 
 Man is the plan 
 The master like Tiger 
 So much is the drive 
 I am the definition of a rider 
 Daughter's name means survivor 
 From a tribe-a 
 Colliders 
 Just one word can't describe her 
 A scribe of the streets 
 And a good life that we all wanna reach 
 I'm hotter than a beach 
 Flow is so deep 
 Even underwater 
 I can inhale to bring the world in order
