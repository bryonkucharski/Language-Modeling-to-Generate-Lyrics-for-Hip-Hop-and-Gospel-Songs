I'm the river that flow through the hood 
 Through the woods, through the birds, through the mud 
 Through the bricks over the curves, to the forest reserve 
 Got with four acres in the forest and worst 
 Planted [Incomprehensible] for the young seeds to know 
 Trees is blowin', we see change in the wind 
 This is new day and I gotta take it in 
 See a black man run, we need him to win 
 Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow 
 Let belief lead the way and the angels follow 
 Open doors for the hopeful to go through 
 'Cause I was chosen and I'm supposed to 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child 
 I always smile, let my mind float like a child 
 Wishin' I was smart as these kids are now 
 All grown up still wishin' I'm a child again 
 Church song reminded me to stay grateful 
 A [Incomprehensible] reminded me to stay playful 
 Day's go by, my life all high 
 I leave all my walks so the fight don't die 
 And me, I found a purpose why I MC 
 Inspire a young world to be greater than me 
 I fall awake and I dream a song 
 So the little shortys will sing along 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 Welcome children, welcome me 
 Your sentiments is felt in me 
 I see the future and the walking path 
 Don't let these fool take you off your path 
 Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to 
 Life is a trip ride long and proceed to 
 Try to believe to, do what you wanna do 
 Remember you're kings and queens and still humble to 
 Life isn't fun and you don't need to look back again 
 Victory can be claimed while you still battling 
 Travel on with the food I provide you 
 To awaken the voice that's inside you 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 I know a change gonna come 
 The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah 
 Change is inevitable, you can't stop it 
 Change is happening in everybody's life 
 Change is like the furious hurricane that you can't stop 
 What is change? Change is Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi 
 Shakespeare, Tupac Shakur, Barack Obama 
 And you can't forget Common 
 Change is gonna happen, change is hope
