You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 I'm on what? What you on to? 
 I'm the sun god, let me warm you 
 Out of my sides the Lord formed you 
 Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal 
 Our fragrance is patience 
 We can major in communication 
 Relatin' like cousins, though we kissin' though 
 Love can be sick or medicinal 
 A doctor of it, you gots to love it 
 God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin' 
 In your ear with somethin' it ain't clear 
 On your inside it appear, so somehow you're here 
 I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside 
 They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside 
 Of everything you are 
 Cause everything you are is my lovestar 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 I ain't the type to be all up on your social 
 I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to 
 A choosy lover, I chose you 
 God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you 
 You already in shape, that's more love to make 
 Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape 
 When we need a break 
 We take it 
 When two souls connect you can't fake it 
 TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite 
 Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it 
 This ain't about labels, this about fit 
 Since God designed, we can start our own line 
 Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined 
 We walk the runway like blaow 
 Bein' in love is never out of style 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here 
 Cause you make it all worth it 
 We do this on purpose 
 The love we make is certain 
 I'm so caught in your arm 
 If you're lost in your thoughts 
 I want to be your everything forever 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 You're my lovestar 
 What we gonna do, baby? 
 Forever, I wanna be forever 
 Forever, star 
 Lovestar, lovestar
