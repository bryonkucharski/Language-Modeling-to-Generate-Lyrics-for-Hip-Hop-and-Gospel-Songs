I do dirt, in search of a clear mind 
 Money talk, somebodies gonna hear mine 
 Grind early before 9: 30 
 Got the nine and the thirty 
 Kiss of death, you heard me? 
 My world ain't worldly, any time could be my time 
 I get high, but still ain't seen Chicago skyline 
 In my prime, stakes is high 'cause it's beef 
 Out here in these streets 
 Everybody tryna eat off the same plate 
 Dead presidents, we want the same face 
 And to think, me and the president, we from the same place 
 Four-hundred and twenty-one murders, ain't tryna be of the same fate 
 If I die and go to heaven, will I make it through the main gate? 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom 
 Ooh 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom 
 Ooh 
 Ah yes, my Lord, ah, oh 
 Ah yes, my Lord, ah, oh 
 Second row of the church with my hood on 
 My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on 
 At his funeral, listening to this church song 
 His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for 'em 
 A cold world that's why we pack heaters 
 Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us 
 I'm a need to go back, I gots to get 'em 
 Back and forth in these streets, that's the rhythm 
 Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord 
 When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can't afford not to hit him 
 Shots ripping through his True Religion denim 
 These streets was my religion 
 I stood over him, his life is over then 
 Now these keys got me locked up with older men 
 Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz 
 They ended up being the keys for my life to end 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh (sing) 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh 
 Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh 
 (And the streets say) 
 (And the people say) 
 (And we all say) 
 Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh 
 (And the streets say) 
 (And the people say) 
 (And we all say) 
 My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight 
 Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait 
 I was hurtin', couldn't get no work 
 You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt 
 You said that the last shall be first 
 Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth? 
 My whole life I had to worry about eatin' 
 I ain't have time to think about what I believe in 
 When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come? 
 I'm coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son 
 And I don't want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him 
 And I don't want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him 
 Hope it's the good things, till life was over is when I understood things 
 Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done 
 I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in? 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh (sing) 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh 
 Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh

 Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe 
 My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas 
 See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever's on your plate 
 Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet 
 Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key 
 But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own 
 Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free 
 We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water 
 Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father 
 Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver 
 Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler 
 Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar 
 So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though 
 Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low 
 Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used 
 See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news 
 Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues 
 Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew 
 If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here 
 Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys 
 To the kingdom 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh (sing) 
 Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah) 
 Ooh
