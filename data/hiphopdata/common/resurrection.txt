 Resurrection 
 Common: 
 I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin' 
 Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen 
 It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine 
 I grab the men, verbally badgering broads 
 I wish that Madeline was back on video LP 
 I went against all odds and got a even steven 
 Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin' 
 But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise 
 I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize 
 I analyze where I rest my eyes 
 And chastise the best of guys with punchlines 
 I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time 
 For your mind like one time 
 If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine 
 'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times 
 Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine 
 I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine 
 Eating beef sometimes, I try to cut back on that shit 
 This rap shit is truly outta control 
 My style is too developed to be arrested 
 It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole 
 They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell 
 I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail 
 A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury 
 I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me 
 Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints 
 They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense

 Common: 
 I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light 
 I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight 
 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight 
 I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright 
 Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights 
 Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes 
 In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades, I got it made 
 I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums 
 Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums 
 Had to halt with the malt liquor 
 'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker 
 Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker 
 UAC got my back and we don't, now check it 
 I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga 
 But it's my turn to go I gotta go and I'm gone with the storm
