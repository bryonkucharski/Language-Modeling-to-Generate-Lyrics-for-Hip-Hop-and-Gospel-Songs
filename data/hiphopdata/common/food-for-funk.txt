Common: 
 What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Check it, yo 
 You say a one for the trouble, two for the time 
 Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh 
 (I can feel the funk) (x4) 
 Check it 
 I come to grips with mics 
 I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes 
 I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton 
 Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight 
 When I got light like an intersection, you talk 
 But you came to my town with protection 
 Election year, had the block hot 
 I scream "fuck the world" for having a baby girl sorta cock block 
 I write rhymes like I come from the windy city 
 With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality 
 Casually, I walk through these war games 
 Some claim say but then they take on whore names 
 If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane 
 If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now 
 Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place 
 It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face 
 The music is thumpin and you're feelin' the bass 
 What you wanna do girl (wanna shout) 
 To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz 
 It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor 
 You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker 
 What you wanna do man?(let go) 
 Yo, check it 
 Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes 
 Allow me to get on and bust like Spike (uh) 
 Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation 
 Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager 
 In the age of Aquarius, various things 
 Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you 
 Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons 
 Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms 
 Every black moon, a rap tune move me 
 The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played 
 It don't stop 
 It's time to get it, get it made 
 I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face 
 I know how the underground tastes 
 I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace 
 Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers 
 Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin 
 Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years 
 Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now 
 I can feel the funk (x8) 
 Yo, check it, check it 
 I came through the corridor, with the aura 
 Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror 
 Read between the lines and know the border 
 Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water 
 Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib 
 We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is 
 Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather 
 The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather 
 I rap better than you, you, or maybe him 
 But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb 
 Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly 
 Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly 
 But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin' sawed off 
 They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off 
 I kick ass 
 (Scratching) 
 I can feel the funk (x16) (makes me wanna shout, wanna shout) (x4) 
 (Scratching) Wanna shout
