Common 
 : 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean 
 I'm a person that's making profit. see I pimp internationally 
 I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted 
 I pimp with the truth, that's the only method 
 Common 
 : 
 Seen her on madison where vice lords be travelin 
 And chevy windows be rattlin 
 And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts 
 Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched 
 Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig 
 Asked her the name, one way to approach her 
 See she had game, she needed me to coach her 
 Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture 
 The way a righteous pimp is supposed to 
 MC Lyte 
 : 
 As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune 
 I ain't having it like abortion 
 Walking with this stick holding his tip 
 Looked like a black panther that was trying to pimp 
 It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride 
 Act like I didn't see him I tried 
 Common 
 : 
 Motion denied (pause) 
 I felt the vibe like roy ayers 
 She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators 
 Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure 
 That's in tuned with nature, hold common's hand 
 I'm a take you to a pimps promise land 
 Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya 
 Bilal 
 : 
 Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god 
 Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god 
 Common 
 :

 MC Lyte 
 :

 With them shits on your wrist looking goofy 
 Common 
 : 
 (Yeah ok) 
 I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel 
 You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level 
 You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang

 MC Lyte 
 :

 You too slow for me 
 Common 
 : 
 You know why? 
 I'm thinking bigger than bagets 
 Birds in slick cars 
 Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars 
 If you become mine the world would be ours 
 Respect the game, and universal laws 
 MC Lyte 
 : 
 What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall 
 (Try it) 
 Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball 
 I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn you barely surviving 
 We can't ride together cause you ain't driving 
 (Oh it's like that) 
 Bilal 
 : 
 Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god 
 Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers 
 Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god 
 Common 
 : 
 (This, this, this really how I look at it check it) 
 You and I together is like ashford and simpson 
 Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention 
 MC Lyte 
 : 
 Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (yep) 
 That shit is the past

 I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track 
 Matter of fact I been looking for a hoe that's abstract 
 Common 
 : 
 Girl you getting beside yourself 
 I'm trying to guide you 
 Help you see inside yourself 
 I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light 
 Have you covering your body and have you eating right 
 MC Lyte 
 : 
 (Is that right) 
 I'm pimp hoes, pimp pens, (say what) 
 Pimp rhythms, pimp flows 
 Pimp men (and pimp what) 
 Pimp systems 
 Got stores called big pimpin' (where) 
 Down south 
 In Texas I ran the best hoe house 
 Common 
 : 
 (So)

 Have Japanese broads sayin' 'choushi wa dou' (yeah right) 
 Bring 'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe 
 Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer 
 MC Lyte 
 : 
 (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 
 (Why you laughin'?) 
 I'm laughin' 'cause you funny

 I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly 
 You'll get all the right tolls in that dashiki 
 Common 
 : 
 Yo, what ever happened to loyalty? 
 Don't you want to become royalty 
 On the streets selling ass and oils for me? 
 But you on this hoe's ass and really I can't reach you 
 Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher 
 Well there you have it y'all 
 The story of pimps and hoes y'all know how it goes 
 It's been the oldest profession 
 The whole thing is like a lesson 
 Ain't no second guessin' 
 Pimps y'all, hustlers 
 All that good shit 
 Yeah, yeah 2000 and forever 
 It'll be here 
 Uh, uh aight cool
