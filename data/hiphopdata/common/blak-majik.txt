 Who that boy he radical 
 Talk that money talk emphatical 
 Who in the game had the baddest hoes 
 Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "I seen what you was on" 
 Home grown with no home phone 
 From the city of wind nigga, win or go home 
 It's the Chi bullshit I'm on 
 Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones 
 Hit them cones, clips and crones 
 I don't play away games, I got hitters at home 
 I'm a dime like six in the morn' 
 Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones 
 Go hard like pyramid stones 
 Stand the test of time cross the burning sands 
 With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme 
 I invest in time 
 Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm

 Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical 
 I ride fun facts that's actual 
 Keep it one hunnid that's natural 
 To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow 
 Shout out to black and DC make it capital 
 I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more 
 Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo' 
 Got a whole lot so we can have some mo' 
 So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more 
 Clap clap, home of the original gang bangers, gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers 
 Movie, we are black actors 
 Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik 
 What I do, I own like magic 
 Status of the livest and established 
 Girl with the fattest, I'm givin' you the gladdest 
 Like you ever had this magic 
 Neewteb ni tsixe I ereh ton ma I 
 Maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma I 
 I am the matter that cannot be seen 
 I am the conscious you have in your dream 
 Do not be scared of my dark energy 
 I am not here I exist in between 
 Yeah that's me I'm magical 
 I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro 
 I'm nothing you have had before 
 I'm everything but nothing more
