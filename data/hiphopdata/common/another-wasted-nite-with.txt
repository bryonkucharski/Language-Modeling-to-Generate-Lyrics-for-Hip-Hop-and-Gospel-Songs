Say, brother 
 If you ever let me leave out a club with a big fat-ass, stove-like bitch like that without pointin' out the facts, I'mma kick your motherfuckin' ass 
 Man, that nerve of the ho not to give me no pussy 
 Come up in my house trying to watch movies and shit, this ain't no motherfuckin' cinema, bitch 
 Who the fuck she thought I 
 Say, brother, I wasted a evening, I shoulda went with you 
 But, oh, well, you know I gets my pussy anyway 
 You know that's how players do 
 But God-damnit, Rashid, that big-ass bitch, haha 
 If you'd have said to spread on that ho, man, I could kick my own ass 
 Well, should go to work, just another wasted night 
 And oh, oh 
 Hey, hey, what can you say?
