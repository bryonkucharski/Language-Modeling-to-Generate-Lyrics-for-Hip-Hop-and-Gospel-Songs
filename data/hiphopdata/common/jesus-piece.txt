Tell 'em pray for me 
 It was God that brought Dre to me 
 Even brought the nigga Kanye for me 
 Bless but them niggas shot Big 
 Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live 
 Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap 
 Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped 
 But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars 
 Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards 
 Not the deck though 
 Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco 
 Memoirs of the gold chain 
 It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane 
 Black Versaces with the gold frame 
 Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim 
 14 had a brain that could throw flames 
 So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah 
 Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah 
 Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah) 
 Lord willin', I see a billion 
 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Throw them suicide doors up 
 And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 That's the crack music, nigga 
 Never spit a verse 'cause I was making trap music, nigga 
 I'm not an army, I'm a movement 
 The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him 
 Ice Cubin', roof translucent 
 Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose 
 When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head 
 Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head 
 Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe? 
 Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water 
 Rocks in my ears something Titanic 
 This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it 
 God says everything happens for a reason 
 I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons 
 Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing 
 Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah 
 Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah 
 Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah) 
 Lord willin', I see a billion 
 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Throw them suicide doors up 
 And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Pieces on gold leashes 
 Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive 
 I'm the sun shining with God features 
 Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher 
 Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders 
 We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us 
 Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights 
 To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like 
 At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like 
 He paid for my sins, is it really priced right? 
 Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight 
 Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like 
 Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo' 
 A combo she end up at the condo 
 Another Jane Doe or a golden angel 
 Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah 
 Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah 
 Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah) 
 Lord willin', I see a billion 
 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Throw them suicide doors up 
 And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)
