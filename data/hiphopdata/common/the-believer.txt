(Hook: John Legend) 
 I believe in the light that shines and will never die 
 Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive 
 They will talk about us 
 Like they talked about the kings before us 
 They will talk about us 
 (Verse 1: Common) 
 These are the words of a believer 
 Achiever, leader of the globe 
 Feeding souls of those in need 
 I bleed the blood of the struggle 
 Walking over troubled puddles 
 Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress 
 Extremities of life and it's process 
 Birth of a son, death of another 
 With love I caress both mothers 
 And told 'em, who's in control is the one that's above us 
 I walk where money talks and love stutters 
 Body language of a nation going through changes 
 The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger 
 Anger gets sent through the chamber 
 It's tough when your own look like strangers 
 We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers 
 If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us? 
 Look at the picture, hard not to blame us 
 But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often 
 Do they end up in a coffin because we haven't taught them? 
 Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking? 
 Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em? 
 Find myself on the same corner that we lost 'em 
 Real talking, in they ear like a walkman 
 Thoughts spin around the corner to the world 
 When I see them, I see my baby girl 
 Believe! 
 (Verse 2: Common) 
 The lord lives among us, the younguns hunger 
 Become a means to get it by any ways nece- 
 -Ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser 
 With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors 
 Destiny's children survivors, soldiers 
 In front of buildings they eyes look older 
 Hard to see blessings in the violent culture 
 Face against weapons, sirens, holsters 
 That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us 
 Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah 
 We go from being Precious to Oprah 
 Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas 
 Today and the way that you can see we determined 
 Solar keeps burning, shawty's know to keep learning 
 Lesson's in our life are like stripes that we earning 
 Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning 
 Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light 
 For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys 
 Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest 
 That seems beyond us, even through the unseen 
 I know that God watches 
 From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us 
 The prophets, nothing can stop us 
 Believe!
