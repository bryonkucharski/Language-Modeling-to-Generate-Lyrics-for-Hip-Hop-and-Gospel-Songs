Everybody home, ain't nobody gone 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it 
 And I got all my niggas around 
 I got a couple minutes in town 
 A couple hundred bitches around 
 So baby go on and get us a round 
 'Cause I got all my niggas around 
 Celebrate 
 We partying, yeah got body and 
 Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian 
 Fly, we live it till we die 
 We living in the night looking in the eye 
 On our paper till we get it like Dubai 
 Chi niggas stand up, plastic cups 
 Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks 
 It don't stop here 
 Bottles of Veuve pop here 
 And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here 
 Celebrate like it's new year 
 Some bomb broads coming, type nuclear 
 Yeah, it's so ridiculo 
 Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go 
 Backwards liquor store 
 Celebrate 
 In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic 
 My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with 
 This raw bitch came in looking flawless 
 Tonight she'll be giving conscious, headlights! 
 Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her 
 I got to act right for her like I'm an author 
 Look where drama brought us, look where karma brought us 
 Married to the game, like Usher we was caught up 
 Now we got some R&B broads we can call up 
 You niggas come around keep the wall up 
 Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things 
 Hustlers from the go, how far we done came 
 Celebrate 
 Ah, another night, we love the night 
 For the life, getting bugged tonight 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 Told you it's gonna be on like the business that we lean on 
 Put my team on, get our heat on 
 Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay 
 My niggas move work even on a holiday 
 We come from porches and alleyways 
 I'm the big ticket, don't need no one to validate 
 You celebrate 
 We ain't gotta wait 
 It's a toast to you and me 
 Bills ain't so bad, celebrate that 
 Party in the yard till the lights come on 
 Ain't nobody crying 
 We've come so far, been climbing 
 Now the clouds they passed us by 
 C'mon and raise your glass up high
