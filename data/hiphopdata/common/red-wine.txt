Red wine time on the couch 
 Happy you agreed to hang out 
 Keep my head in the clouds 
 Keep them old names out your mouth 
 I can make you laugh out loud 
 We the only ones in the house 
 I can help you body wind down 
 Make this bottle disappear right now 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Let's stay in for the night 
 Maybe take a walk outside 
 Let's distance your pride 
 Me fall in love with your mind 
 If I look deep in your eyes 
 I can guess your zodiac sign 
 We ain't got nothing but time 
 We can just chill and unwind 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Get comfortable, comfortable 
 Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude 
 The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture 
 Where there's food there's vultures 
 More Tony now, back then I was Sosa 
 I was sent like a penny in a loafer 
 The 2Pac Deepak Chopra 
 On a plane drinking wine with Oprah 
 When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her 
 Black Caesar, ey o amo roma 
 Tuto biene vino rosa 
 My dominican girl she loves soca 
 Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA 
 Most of my friends at home that I'm close to 
 When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture 
 Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper 
 Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound 
 I'm bound to the underground 
 Breaking walls down for the black and brown 
 A activist is active now 
 How far will you go for exposure? 
 Little homie in the paint tryna post up 
 Don't make me have to put you on a poster 
 Posterized by what I vocalize 
 Weathered the storm like I know the skies 
 Yeah we wear the mask but I know no disguise 
 These signs of the times are notarized 
 Written by the lord of the skies mortalized 
 In us, I got cold through cruel winters 
 Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda 
 Never been good with pretenders 
 They lying on the king like Simba 
 Dinner, branzino and red wine 
 Quality shared time 
 Fucking and laughing till its bed time 
 Red like my lips 
 Blue like past thoughts 
 Brown like your eyes 
 Just enough time 
 I can't think now 
 You're too close and I... 
 Might be too nice 
 These New York nights 
 Got me taking chances 
 I think your hands 
 Might look just right 
 If they held mine 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Get two glasses 
 Now I'm swimming 
 Off the deep end 
 Heightened senses 
 No pretending 
 Make my head spin 
 I like dancing 
 In my bedroom 
 It's just me and you 
 Put that tape on 
 Tell me what you want 
 Let's just make time feel, long 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 You could just stay for the night 
 Here, let me turn down the lights 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 You can let go 
 Passion comes from down below 
 We go together like so 
 Get comfortable, get comfortable 
 Let's make a toast 
 That we both can make the most of this time 
 Red wine
