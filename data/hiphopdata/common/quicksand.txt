I always knew I'd touch the sky 
 With heart full of fire and third eye 
 Steady my vision, my climb 
 I, I knew with all my mind 
 The dream manifesto, to get it and don't let go 
 Praises to the most high, eyes are kinda set low 
 A man of many faces 
 I rock the crooked smile since they took off my braces 
 Back on Stony Isle we was on our own oasis 
 Mild sauce, hot tempers cold cases, huh 
 I ran the town not knowing it was races 
 Standing on the deck smokin' aces 
 Grace is the wonderland 
 I seek the face of the sunnah man 
 A fatherless child that made it to the motherland 
 I think how far these raps really took me 
 A veteran in the game I stay fresh like a rookie 
 When I was underground, they used to overlook me 
 Now flicks and book tours make it hard for them to book me 
 The presence of Rah, the essence of a star 
 Jewelry and a car, suggesting who we are 
 The blessings of Jah, that come through us all 
 I'm seasoned y'all, I never knew when to fall 
 In the quicksand 
 I always knew I'd touch the sky 
 With heart full of fire and third eye 
 Steady my vision, my climb 
 I, I knew with all my mind 
 The picture's been clear since this man's been a shorty 
 Consolidate the dollars go dumb E-40 
 No pimping in your poetry 
 No sleeping with your jewelry off 
 And when you get your chance slam dunk it, Ronny Turiaf 
 And I did that, me and my guys repping the city 
 And I hustle with no pity, they christen me Frank Nitty 
 And I took that and I ran with it, made a few stacks and some bands with it 
 But then I brought it home, a student must then teach his own 
 And I could never dream it could go from the Yancey's basement 
 To be standing up on stages in front of some foreign faces 
 Get love in those foreign places like we from there, and oh yeah 
 They like, "Where the dollars at?" 
 I'm like, "Imma call you back" 
 And please let me clarify 
 Playa, I'll be damned if I 
 Ever let the picture fade to black before I say goodbye 
 Spot you like you Spotify 
 Nitty make the song cry 
 Imma let Illa sing his lullaby 
 Quicksand 
 I always knew I'd touch the sky 
 With heart full of fire and third eye 
 Steady my vision, my climb 
 I, I knew with all my mind 
 I heard a hater say I never be more than J Dilla's little brother 
 I never be more than an insignificant other 
 I never be more than a video stand-in 
 But here I am still standing 
 When you haters try to leave me in the quicksand 
 Left me outside the club with no wristband 
 Now I'm pissed off like I'm repping the Pistons 
 And I came all the way from fuckin' Michigan 
 That's when the shit hit the fan then I moved back 
 Had to do my Stella still I had to get my groove back 
 Then I came up with a plan to put my shoes back on 
 I ran hella hella fast until I proved that 
 I could do it while I'm swimming in the pool of sweat, blood and tears 
 My career I had to keep pursuing that 
 And I could do that with my eyes closed 
 'Cause I know I'm fly, always knew I 
 I always knew I'd touch the sky 
 With heart full of fire and third eye 
 Steady my vision, my climb 
 I, I knew with all my mind
