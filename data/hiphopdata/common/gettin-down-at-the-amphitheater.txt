(Feat. de la Soul) 
 "Ga-ga-gangbusters!" 
 (Dove) 
 Hey give it Boogie like the BX, sex regular booger bitches 
 Get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes 
 Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde 
 And shit, wreckin we live and shit 
 This swamp water style'll keep 'em dirty and wet 
 I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set 
 Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency 
 Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce 
 Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce 
 Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+ 
 Study scrolls that includes the clause 
 Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal 
 With the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle 
 Get zapped and zipped in the duffle 
 Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist 
 To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this! 
 A two dollar somethin' got your eyes on him 
 But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb 
 Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight 
 So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one! 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
 (Common) 
 Underground under pressure, my style is the child 
 Of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad 
 Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge 
 Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj 
 I take over breaks and chop loops 
 Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops 
 Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose 
 Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus 
 Before you get a style, let's get a style 
 My style pans the crowd back and forth 
 You were soft as the tracks you rappin' off, I pop shit 
 You tried to laugh it off, actin' like you had to cough 
 And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern 
 Emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled 
 Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it 
 I drop science and experiment -- contractually 
 Came to terms of endearment with my label 
 Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz 
 Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows 
 Wipin your nose like you need blows 
 Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats 
 Or is it how they word it 
 If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with 
 Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted 
 Many lip profess, I'm verb centered 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
 (Pos) 
 It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip 
 Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength 
 I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid 
 Of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid' 
 Infinite landscaper, green paper maker 
 Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims 
 Man these people still takin' rappin' for a joke 
 The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent 
 Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide 
 On the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype 
 Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy 
 Walk around dead, like your physical's buried 
 Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's 
 Shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit 
 That yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless 
 My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless 
 Your crew couldn't even measure to mine 
 That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine 
 Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank 
 We bringin' this Big and Bad like Hank 
 Just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 "Just get on down.." 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down 
 And just dance, you know you gots the feelin' 
 Just dance, ah come on and get down! 
 "Just get on down.." 
 * Cut and scratch of "Just get on down.." to the song's end *
