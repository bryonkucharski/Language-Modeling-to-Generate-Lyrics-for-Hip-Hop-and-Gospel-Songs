I'm trying to catch the beat, uh 
 I'm trying to catch the beat 
 I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh 
 I'm trying to catch the beat 
 Now, throw your motherfucking hands 
 Get 'em high 
 All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man 
 Get 'em high 
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands 
 Keep 'em high 
 And if your losing your high then smoke again 
 Keep 'em high 
 Now, my flow 
 Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics 
 I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics 
 My freshman year I was going through hella problems 
 'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college 
 My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me 
 I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart, 
 And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks 
 You ain't gotta guess who's back 
 You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful 
 But this bastard's flow will bash a skull 
 And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy 
 And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro 
 And I won't give you that money that you asking for 
 Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes! 
 That's why we hear your music in fast forward 
 'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more 
 Now, throw your motherfucking hands 
 Get 'em high 
 All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man 
 Get 'em high 
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands 
 Keep 'em high 
 And if your losing your high then smoke again 
 Keep 'em high 
 Now who the hell is this? 
 E-mailing me at eleven twenty six, telling me that she thirty six-twenty six, plus double D 
 You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly 
 At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus 
 Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice 
 Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis 
 W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet 
 So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend 
 His name Kweli 
 (You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib) 
 I mean 
 (That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib) 
 I mean 
 (You don't really know him, why is you lying) 
 You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line 
 She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines 
 Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high 
 Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes 
 But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out 
 And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out 
 Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, ayo 
 Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom? 
 She's the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior 
 Always got something to say like an OK player hater 
 Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet 
 Or chicks on birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette 
 You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes 
 And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet 
 I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate 
 I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it 
 Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke 
 A high filled with dope 
 You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes 
 The real nigga quotes 
 Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control 
 Rap is not a used to but still got love 
 That's why I abuse you who are not thugs 
 Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show 
 Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you 
 You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you 
 How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead 
 I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these 
 That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys 
 Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular 
 Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her 
 Album, how come, you the hot garbage of 
 The year, It's clear your image is snooped up 
 Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick 
 Man you a dick with a loose nut 
 Video hard to watch like Medusa 
 Even your club record need a booster 
 Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga 
 Read the infra red across your head Imma bred King like Simba 
 Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper 
 You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way 
 So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye 
 Spitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring 
 Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then 
 Now, throw your motherfucking hands 
 Get 'em high 
 All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man 
 Get 'em high 
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands 
 Keep 'em high 
 And if your losing your high then smoke again 
 Keep 'em high
