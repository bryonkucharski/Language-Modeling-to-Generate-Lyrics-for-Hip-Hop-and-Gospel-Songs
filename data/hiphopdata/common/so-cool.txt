Y'all let um know 
 I'm the coldest MC Joe you dig 
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
 I was raise in city where the blood is cold 
 Big hats Cadillacs and we love some gold 
 Looking for something real something pretty to hold 
 I'm king so I wrote livid imperial souls 
 I can tell you one them undercover video hoes 
 The way you shake I might just give you a role 
 Radios TV stole the soul 
 Now these playa's in the game really don't know they role 
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
 You tryin' to look real sexy 
 You wanna get some lovers 
 You know your stomach's too big 
 For you to be wearing them hip hugger 
 You need to work it out work it off juke it out 
 And use your mind the way you use your mouth 
 I'm from a stripper hustler with names like Chip and Buster 
 Come to the crib with that bogus 
 Them boys will nip and tuck ya 
 Are you a righteous brother 
 Still I might just touch her, build her and destruct her 
 Come with heat that'll burn like Usher 
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool 
 So cool, so cool 
 I wanna move 
 So cool, so cool
