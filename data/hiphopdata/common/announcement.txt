(Feat. Pharrell) 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 Everybody I'd like to announce 
 Throw you hands up when we in the house 
 Yeah, this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 And tell your girl that the tickets is out 
 And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out 
 'Cause this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 Live from the South Side this one 
 Hide your gun, representing Chi-Town to the fullest 
 Raps or bullets, see them rappers, they be duckin' 
 When Com be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin' 
 On the sink, got my mama a mink 
 Think Common is the link, thought the game was extinct 
 Lay there, them jeans is as slim as Shady 
 Brought 'em back from the 80's, now let's make some babies 
 Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me 
 No we can push more whips than slavery 
 Alex Haley and this rap shit, my roots is deep 
 You heard the bitch is you, yeah I know what's beef 
 Let it cook and I pop like grease 
 You thirsty niggas can't stop my feast, uh 
 I still love her, she be needin' the dick 
 When it come to hip hop it's just me and my bitch, uh 
 Everybody I'd like to announce 
 Throw you hands up when we in the house 
 Yeah, this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 And tell your girl that the tickets is out 
 And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out 
 'Cause this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 Baby, you're like, what the fuck? There is no other 
 Valet crushed my Rolls so quickly I bought another 
 Sorry Mr. William moved out the building 
 Spot to the top, fifty feet with was the ceiling 
 Slow down son, you're killin' 'em, well funded it was not 
 Came to shitty deals, reminiscing give me chills 
 When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie 
 The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove to his city 
 Now all the little bitties from ugly to pretty 
 I was the magician mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen 
 My dick is like a Blow Pop baby 
 And it gets stiffer than some Botox baby 
 But show out baby and show me you ain't gon' act right 
 And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike 
 She ain't know the Casio cost a hundred 
 It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it, what? 
 Everybody I'd like to announce 
 Throw you hands up when we in the house 
 Yeah, this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 And tell your girl that the tickets is out 
 And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out 
 'Cause this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back 
 Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of Jack 
 I'll probably go to jail for, naw that ain't me 
 I style crazy and act like Jay-Z 
 The black Kojak, I get money and want mo' stacks 
 The rap photographer, the way the flow stop 
 Broads say, "Are you a philosopher?" 
 "Yeah yeah, I philosophize on top of ya" Uh! 
 Everybody I'd like to announce 
 Throw you hands up when we in the house 
 Yeah, this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby 
 And tell your girl that the tickets is out 
 And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out 
 'Cause this is hip hop baby 
 I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby
