How should I begin? 
 This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn 
 As I said it, the spirits enwhip me 
 He was raised in the belly of the city 
 Chicago 
 Discovered by du Sable 
 A Black Frenchman 
 That I had to mention 
 Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end 
 47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline 
 Grandma Mable did the best she could 
 You know how young brothers want a testy hood 
 There he stood, taller than most Black boys 
 One of the best ballers out of Illinois 
 Collagen, Ohio, this is like his bio 
 Talks that we had, man, they was never idle 
 He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible 
 He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival 
 He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital 
 He said y'all boys love the bang 'cause you tribal 
 Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver 
 Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center 
 6'9", big heart, big mind 
 He he spent his whole life tryin' to be big time 
 He did in a way, he made to the ABA 
 And the things he say on my record 
 When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message" 
 It was his messages in life I would step with 
 Didn't see him much, spirits are connected 
 Father creates it, the son can reflect it 
 His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy 
 His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant 
 His perspective: somehow it shaped me 
 His perspective: undoubted I feel it 
 He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him 
 I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em" 
 The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one 
 Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication 
 Breathing heavy, he talked reparations 
 He said, "Son, we live through our generations" 
 Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons was playing 
 In the background, he was talking, I was praying 
 Our Father, take care of my father 
 As far as he went, may I go farther 
 May our dreams and legacies live through our children 
 Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him 
 As Pops would always say, "Keep the peace"
