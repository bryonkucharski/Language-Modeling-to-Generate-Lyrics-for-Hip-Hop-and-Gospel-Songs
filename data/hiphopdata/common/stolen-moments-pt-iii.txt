(Feat. Q-Tip) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
 Hey, who dat? Hey, who dat? 
 Hey, who dat? Check it, what 
 Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are (x2) 
 Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga 
 Whoever you are, whoever you are 
 Common: 
 Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin 
 Somewhat like the girl X-ratin 
 It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation 
 Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin 
 Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation 
 Without somebody breakin in my demonstration 
 For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net 
 It certain things about this I ain't figure yet 
 Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys 
 Because his job had been stopped smokin' weed 
 Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed 
 For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need 
 The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it 
 Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with 
 She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken 
 I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin 
 The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype 
 Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike 
 Chances of him breakin in, chillin' and eatin 
 Are about as slim as he is though I knew where he lived 
 In his house with three kids, one I was cool with 
 As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music 
 Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect 
 The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck 
 (Excerpt from a movie) 
 Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why 
 It's the money, all right? 
 Just tell me why 
 It's the fuckin' money, all right? 
 (Fighting) 
 Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit 
 Q-Tip: 
 Know what I'm sayin'. Word up 
 It ain't sweet when you do that shit (x7)
