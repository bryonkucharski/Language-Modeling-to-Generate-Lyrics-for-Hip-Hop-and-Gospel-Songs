Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Should it be, can it be simple? 
 Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental 
 Things that we been through define who we are now 
 Since "Can I Borrow a Dollar?" 
 Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town 
 We was the first to do it 
 Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music 
 The city on our back, we was the opening act 
 Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back 
 But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks 
 I stayed on the raps till we made it on the map 
 By then, No I was my main guy 
 He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr 
 We had came far together, with a long way to go 
 Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles 
 Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game 
 Felt I had to leave home to be a household name 
 Show money low, needin' to stack fast 
 City did have my back, now it's a backlash 
 Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad? 
 I just became a dad, rap was all I had 
 So I moved to New York, to make it pop 
 Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot 
 But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it 
 And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it 
 Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song 
 It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone 
 Wishin' I could get that time back 
 Oh I care, yo man, rewind that 
 Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone 
 For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home 
 Rewind that and we could do it again 
 No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
 This one's for my man J Dilla 
 As I say these words, my eyes fill up 
 'Cause wasn't non' realer than James Dewitt Yancey 
 So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family 
 In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee 
 I still remember the first beat he played me 
 He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy 
 Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free 
 I got the the D, "peace yo, big love" 
 Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club 
 Then we made "The Light" and times got brighter 
 I said "turn it up" Jay'll take it higher 
 One day, I noticed he was tired quick 
 That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick 
 Things got worse before they got better 
 I said, "Come to L.A. for peace and good weather" 
 We got an apartment just so we could spark it 
 MP in the front room, records in the closet 
 The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there 
 I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair 
 It was hard for me to come home every day 
 And see my homie Jay's life fade away 
 I stayed away some times, in other words I ran 
 Till one day J brought me this TV stand 
 It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it 
 It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it 
 The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth 
 I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth 
 Wishing we could have that time back 
 Oh we can, yo man, rewind that 
 Rewind that one time please 
 Rewind that one time please 
 You never gone, you live forever through song 
 I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on 
 I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me 
 Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me 
 That's the infinite team right there, me and Jay Dee, I'mma work with him whenever I can, 'cause he's just like, constantly progressing and growing. He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that 
 Like, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, "Man, I'm blessed." I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say "I was blessed, I know I was blessed." But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music 
 Common, okay for me, okay it's definitely not a Common album 
 But, it's Common
