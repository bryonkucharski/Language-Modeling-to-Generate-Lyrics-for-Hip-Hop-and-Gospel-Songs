Sitting on stairs, in street affairs 
 Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs 
 His voice rare, talk with a mumble 
 Chicago Bearhead, caught up at the huddle 
 Call an audible of trouble came 
 His name Chris, black as his hustle name 
 Raction to his chains, it's like a basketball game 
 Watch him winning, hope your team do the same 
 A menace, he O-Dog, Caine 
 Wish a nigga would go against his grain 
 Used to staying but moved up in the game 
 Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame 
 The fortune of a caine, long live his reign 
 He do it for a son, he do it with a gun 
 Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done 
 A team full of hitters, so they hit and run 
 The prestone even want none 
 Walk with the G's cause the G's never run 
 Something to be from the slum and be the one 
 This is where he at, this is where he from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Living life with no fear 
 Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear 
 Told her that dudes gon' want some ass 
 And whatever you do, do it with class 
 She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it 
 You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it 
 It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning 
 Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning 
 With a tile around my neck, a style around respect 
 Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec 
 They fire, drill, stop dropping roll 
 I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold 
 The way of the road is our ode to the legacy 
 C'mon dog, you know my pedigree 
 Find it forever be, the sun never set on me 
 Many reign, but the game never weather me 
 If I'm in the building that mean I got equity 
 Where articles are black like Ebony 
 Since I was a shorty I was thinking long charity 
 No fear, I say that with levity 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from 
 Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
