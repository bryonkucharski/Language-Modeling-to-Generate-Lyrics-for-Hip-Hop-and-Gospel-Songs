Oh 
 Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin' 
 Champagne poppin', bad thang poppin' 
 Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' 
 No 
 Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin' 
 Campaign poppin', champagne poppin' 
 I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day 
 Niggas gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet 
 I'm hearing fuckin' voices, like when porn play 
 Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay 
 What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day 
 That means to shine, you find a way 
 Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways 
 Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley 
 Champagne ambitions 
 I pour it out for my man who made his transition 
 Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego 
 Born to fly, call me the bald eagle 
 Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though 
 Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin 
 The hero that came from zero 
 My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico 
 This bra from the DR said I was frío 
 That's Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo 
 Pinot noir style, better with time 
 I'm gambling with watches getting better with time 
 So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me 
 They say "time is money", forever is my salary 
 I shine tomorrow with what I do today 
 Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display 
 Oh 
 Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin' 
 Champagne poppin', bad thang poppin' 
 Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' 
 No 
 Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin' 
 Campaign poppin', champagne poppin' 
 Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin' 
 No 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Tryna get it every way, every day 
 Tryna get it every way, every day 
 Tryna get it every way, every day 
 Bars in alignment, stars in alignment 
 Raw off consignment, God's in the diamonds 
 Evolve from the science, power and refinement 
 Read between the lines, hard to define us 
 Niggas that's behind us, throwing up signs to signify us 
 In the Benz leaning like we biased 
 I've seen Len Bias, that shit scared me 
 You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash 
 The moment is to live it like your last 
 Moments that we have never living in the last 
 My time, man, precious like diamonds 
 Look through the glass, see what I magnify man 
 I'mma be shining till I die man 
 I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find man 
 Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day 
 To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K 
 47 to 87 to the hundreds 
 Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted 
 Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity 
 Between peace and prosperity, so marry me 
 Diamonds 
 Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway 
 I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day 
 Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days 
 I used to hit the barber chair and say "I need that fadeaway" 
 Had a crush on what's her name, the feelings never fade away 
 Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808 
 Said you can't take his chain away 
 Real player you can't take this game away 
 Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller 
 But you can't take my dame away, devil in a red dress 
 But she got that angel face 
 I could teach her how to get it day-today-today-today 
 The G code is my combination 
 Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces 
 Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases 
 Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that's my favorite compilation 
 Diamonds
