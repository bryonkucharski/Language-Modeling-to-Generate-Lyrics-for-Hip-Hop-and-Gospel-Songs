Black and blue outside, his soul carries a heart of gold 
 Misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on 
 The child she brings into the world doin' right from wrong 
 It's all it is, all it is, she deserves more 
 Red lipstick - bold, French press - cold 
 You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold 
 Honey gettin' money, the ass is stupid, she far from a dummy 
 Funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money 
 At the club, goin' hard like liquor 
 Shots of Ciroc, she can outdrink a nigga 
 Niggaz dig her, think they can take her to the crib and break her, 
 Move her, shake her, you can't fake her, she knows time is paper 
 Glaciers on her neck-ah! Glaciers on her finger 
 Gucci purse carry notes like a singer, ah-ah 
 Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer, Beamer Benz 
 She got friends in high ends, she know trend she know when 
 She go in like an investor... yessir! 
 Never gettin' gassed like a Tesla, ain't 'bout all that extra 
 Destiny brought her, to where niggaz bought her a lot of shit 
 She ain't caught up, bitches taught her to hustle 
 Hustle harder than a nigga

 She bad, uh uh, she bad 
 Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag 
 Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett 
 Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet 
 She fasted for a week, that's stronger than most 
 If she had kids she could mother/father them both 
 Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody 
 Devil in a tight dress something there that is godly 
 She know what niggaz want, she know how to make 'em hunt 
 Hotel suite at the Trump, the way she walk in them pumps 
 Talkin' 'bout, takin' over the world while holdin' a blunt 
 She hold her man down when her man get locked up 
 Prada keep movin', she movin' movin' and shake it like Parkinson's 
 Used to seal hot purses, and network marketing 
 Eye shadow darker than than them dudes she like 
 An actress her life is so movie like, she hustle harder than a nigga

 Uh, it's Dreezy 
 Look, I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini 
 I make it happen, I would never need a genie 
 Went and got zucchini, threw away that fettuccine 
 I been goin' to the gym, I'm tryna get in that bikini 
 I'm a, smart chick but I never wen to Harvard 
 I'm like a Nina got designer for my armour 
 Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara 
 I'm harder, at these niggaz heads like a barber 
 This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby 
 Who probably driving a Honda but savin' for that Mercedes 
 This is for my pretty women that know that they independent 
 You say that her shit is rented, she probably get offended, man 
 The new kid like a transfer 
 I'm known to set trends, let 'em copy like the answers 
 I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers 
 Shots fired, I go harder than a... nigga 
 Afternoon, breezy afternoon too 
 The winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare

 60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lake front at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 60
