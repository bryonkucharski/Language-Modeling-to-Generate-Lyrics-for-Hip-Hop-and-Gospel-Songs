A nigga told me he only rhyme for 19-year-olds 
 Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes 
 Here it goes, lyrical miracles 
 These are pyramids from the imperial 
 In theory, though, low end scenario 
 It's sound boy burial drove me to classic material 
 Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes 
 For ethereal heights, I write like Pritchard 
 Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable 
 Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go 
 Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door 
 I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though 
 This is a ritual for those depicted as low 
 Now I passed life like I've been here before 
 The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold 
 Us Back, coldest raps 
 For me the globe is like a culdesac 
 Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay 
 I'm from the weather where they spray 
 There's gotta be a better way, people dying everyday 
 Wonder what would heaven say? Devils need to get away 
 From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades 
 I kneel where the rebels pray 
 Seen fifty gray, but they need better shades 
 Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde 
 The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born 
 It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll be burning, burning hot 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll be burning, burning hot 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn 
 I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted 
 Smoke a little, keep a high standard 
 The Roots are my niggas so I gotta fly bandwidth 
 Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with 
 Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich 
 A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps 
 My bio is feedback from what we need rap 
 On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back 
 And come with that new black spiritual 
 Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical 
 Game lack lyrical, we need black generals 
 Holy war, tap into you like Savion 
 But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy 
 Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame 
 I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions 
 Envision a vision of what we wishing 
 I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind 
 Spit the wisdom of the one devine 
 Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line 
 Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes 
 Style Bonnie Caylor, in the sweep with Caroline 
 Getting dressed up under pressure, Alabama shakes on Incense rising from the dresser, child of a fresher god 
 Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard 
 Assata Shakur, I gotta do more 
 The light-skinned spook who got in the door 
 I gotta hit four, same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for 
 I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man 
 And where we land the pyramids stand 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll be burning, burning hot 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll be burning, burning hot 
 Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot 
 MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn
