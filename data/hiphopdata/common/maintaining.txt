Gotta watch out for them critters 
 I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live huh (x4) 
 I was born in Chicago raised on Planet Rock talking zsa zsa zsa zsa, 
 Catch knock my tape like beats (uh), I'm fresh as fruits, 
 You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent 
 You burn up you got me bit, I'm coming as ebit 
 Got on big hoes at Freaknit, frequently your telling me 
 Won and worn your rockets, so, he ain't put no scratch in my pocket 
 Yo heard, with my head I cock it, and rock it like that brother in 
 Colors 
 'Cause I want y'all to live, my crew is 2 Live, we sneakin' to the rear 
 But I can't get us all in free (what?) it's just another case of that 
 2 
 Dollar MC 
 I rock the same clothes 3 days straight to you they wrinkled but to my 
 They 
 Straight 
 Now I'm straight are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer 
 I thought about it jack, and now I'm out of here 
 "Maintain the rock" 
 I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh "Don't 
 Stop 
 The rock" (X4) 
 I need me some new socks, I need me some new drawers 
 I draws attention, like a letter to a sargent 
 There's A Few Good MC's the wack I'm giving code red 
 Slim say I got nobody but when they see me at the party they be like 
 "Go head, go head", 'cause I gots the cuts like Bobby, rappers are 
 Dickheads 
 Choppin' they demo, I do it like Big Red 
 My office hours are from 9 to 5, while you avoid the party I make it 
 Live 
 The fellas nod and the chicks dance 
 While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants 
 I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks 
 I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back 
 Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn 
 Charles Jug and Wesly Snipes, marks wanna test me because I test the 
 Mics 
 I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down 
 Plus I done got better since Soul By the Pound, I maintain 
 I fall fresh apon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming 
 And house more hoes then Spellman, worse unwelcome like James Johnston 
 My brains sponcering speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson 
 Rappers I'm fondaling, they try to settle out of court 
 But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork? 
 I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought 
 'Cause I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em 
 I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it 
 Regardless of the odds of how hard 
 It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them 
 I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes 
 But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin 
 And I got juice, and this niggas scared 
 I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for 
 Broke 
 Like Mel for Moore 
 Why should a male with a B8 get more then me? 
 When Rashid got an MC degree, and a doctorine in rockin' shit I go to 
 Docs 
 To get 
 A fishwish with cheese, I don't mix with MCs, 'cause I just don't like 
 The 
 Mother 
 But I'm still maintaining
