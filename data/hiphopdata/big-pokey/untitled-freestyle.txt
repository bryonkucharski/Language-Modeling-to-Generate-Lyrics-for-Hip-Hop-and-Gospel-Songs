 25 lighters on my dresser yessir I gots to get paid

 And I'm pimpin' like a mac wit bout 25 hoes

 Make moves to make a quick 25 mill 
 Come up so I can knock off big nine-nine Seville 
 Bout to take me bout 25 yellow bones home 
 Doin' bad to make them 25 phone home 
 Call daddy sayin' 25 got to go get 'em, get 'em

 Hittin the highway doin' 25 shows

 Representin fo' those holdin' 25 screws in they deck

 I jumps up early and I yawns and stretch 
 Anotha day another dolla, 'nother case to get 
 I take my time and realize that this game is real 
 I got my mind on firearms, but I'm swanging barbe grill 
 Gots to act real bad when I close red doors 
 I'm shootin spidas off my rims 'cause I'm ridin' on fours 
 And niggaz don't understand that we be drinkin' the norm 
 Never trust broads they're frauds 
 On the 'vard is where I sling when I claim my name 
 Back in the game Hershallwood, Texas regained 
 It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin' in the mix 
 Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list 
 How ya like me now 'cause I'm real 
 Comin' down piece and chain four shiny grills 
 Gots to bring havack where them boys at 
 Fixin to break the mic now is that Fat Pat? 
 25 lighters on my dressa yessir, I gots to get paid 
 We got 25 lighters on the dresser yessir gots to get paid 
 25 lighters on my dressa yessir, I gots to get paid 
 We got 25 lighters on the dresser yessir gots to get paid

 I'm so throwed in the game 
 Southside Playas, Skrewed Up click mayne 
 Wit the finest set you can bet them smoove ass event 
 Comin' through this motherfucker man, hold up and set 
 Some niggaz catch me high like dat 
 And some niggaz act like they want to pull a gat 
 But they betta watch out for the boy PAT 
 That's them motherfuckin haters can they handle me 
 'Cause I be so throwed in this game 
 Comin' down on the swing 
 Grip wood grain on the shirt I leave a stain 
 Cause you try to jack a real true G 
 Comin' down the boulevard 
 Can they see me swangin swangin swang till we live 
 Pop my trunk and give give give 
 Niggaz betta see a nigga roll 
 Starched down and I'm rollin' on eighty fours 
 If the nigga FAT represent the click 
 Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit 
 Betta look around 'cause they don't understand it 
 I'ma say, "Hold up!" and scream, "God dammit!" 
 'Cause I'ma let the cat gone grip and gone take a trip 
 And it's the empty clip just throw it off the ship 
 'Cause it's a throwaway gat 
 It's that Fat Pat, where them haters at where them haterss at 
 Man love it man
