 Niggas know me 'cause I hawg the track 
 Low vouges on Escalade's I bought me that 
 And everywhere I go I hall a gat 
 A platinum plus'll slash all of that 
 You know me I'm a balla black 
 I'm a ball till I fall have a ball attack 
 If I played for southern I'd hawg the swat 
 And I'm still a D dealer I hawg all the crack 
 Squash the chat I'm a C-E-O 
 Ask wodie for real y'all ask C he know 
 Peep my steelo I'm off the chain 
 4 days out the week I'm flossin grain 
 4 month's did shows sasa (?) 
 Got me a house built (that's awesome mayn) 
 Knocked off the studio house of pain 
 And I fly first class first off the plane 
 (Chris Ward) 
 I'm Chris Ward I'm off the stone Boulevard 
 I stay danked out and dranked out full of noise 
 If a hater got plex I'll pull his cards 
 Unplug ya lights and send you to the Lord 
 'Cause I heard threw the hate line you wanna take mine 
 Well pick a number nigga wait in line 
 Go threw jackas like these break 'em down 
 For I married the streets I went on dates wit crime 
 And I don't make club songs I make thug songs 
 Spitt verses and make niggas put they mugs on 
 You suckas can catch me in Guess jeans and Nugs on 
 Sellin on the same corner that you sell ya drugs on 
 Chris Ward is on the block and the street is mine 
 And you don't wanna get caught up when I sweep the dime 
 I might sweep it early I might sweep at nine 
 And I don't care if you sleep wit ya heaters 
 Because I creep with mine 
 (Big E) 
 When you talk behind my back you feel you lack 
 In 2000 Big E the real pitt on the track 
 Chitter chatter it don't matter me myself woman flatter 
 If you talk down you'll fuckin' get ya brain splatter 
 But we talkin' street sweeps and glocks 
 Some thugged out niggas that bring heat to blocks 
 We some swisha sweet smokers boys rich as Oprah 
 We in the club smokin' okra back of the strip like (?) 
 Party with gardies smoke trees like jet skies 
 Major playas who make goals like Gretsky 
 Why y'all mad talkin' like y'all turned fed 
 I know y'all the type of faker who likes bread 
 From the dead end section Houston, Texas 
 Get a new car every year don't need a (??) 
 I'm a C-E-O they wanna see me flow 
 Northside screwed up makin' music go slow
