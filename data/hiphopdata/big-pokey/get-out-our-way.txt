(*Talking*) 
 Uh, for the 2-theezie 'bout the cheezy 
 Know me, naw I mean, hey 
 Sensei, Mafia Mike, Whodi bout our paper 
 Mobstyle for life, uh 
 (Big Pokey) 
 For my cream, I'll take it to the extreme 
 A glock and a three beam, plus a million dolla team 
 Franchise like Ikeim, in these streets 
 In studios split beats, with this verbal heat 
 Dress code neat, from head to feet 
 Jumping out the Benzo Jeep, with a petite freak 
 Hit my point, sweep the flo' 
 Call my Cuban connect, cop the snow 
 I'm out the do' quick, with a block or mo' 
 With a glock on my hip, that'll stop the show 
 Bout my do', rolling I'm about my hoe 
 She disrespect my ways, then she got to go 
 When I'm paid it's on, if I'm broke they gone 
 Or I trick with a bitch, I choke my own 
 And I put that, on the Stone 
 When it come to my paper, nigga leave me alone 
 Please, get out of our way 
 We don't have time, to play 
 We're all about, our paper mayn 
 (Chris Ward) 
 I'm on a paper chase, gotta put it in these fakers face 
 And if I get locked up, I'ma escape the place 
 Cause there's no way, I'm doing time in jail 
 I'd rather be burning up, frying in hell 
 As I cry and yell, I keep my ear to the streets 
 Listen and learn to earn, I got peers to defeat 
 While these scandalous hoes bitching, and foes snitching 
 Friends turn into those wishing, my pockets on riches 
 And I ain't got time for chatting, cause niggas be ratting 
 Acting fly like Aladdin, they softer than satin 
 I'ma leave they ass flatting like a mat, with they blood splatting 
 For playing games with me, as if I'm Madden 
 From H-Town to Manhattan, my flows swarm like bees 
 I spit lyrical cheese, on CD's and LP's 
 And when it comes to stacking G's, I'm about my pay 
 But do like the song say, and get out the way 
 (Mafia Mike) 
 Went from broke to cash, then first from last 
 Or leave or now baby, no questions asked 
 Gas up the cat, cause the Gator's gon mash 
 Get out of my way, before I hit that ass 
 Don't cause a scene, that's gon make me slash 
 Then hit the beat so hard, it'll leave a gash 
 And haters fall off, when they touch my stash 
 My whole dress attire, is made with class 
 Those, and ain't trying to get us left in the past 
 I ain't trying to hot cap, or even flash 
 I keep a pound of cash, stashed in my dash 
 Full tank of gas, mean mug on my mask 
 And those are like potatoes, they all get mashed 
 Jackers irritate me, like a rash 
 I gash that ass, ooh you little bitch ass nigga 
 Come here hoe, I knock they chest in the grass 
 (*Talking*) 
 Uh man, too serious mean that 
 Mobstyle for life, Mobstyle for life 
 Ha what, 2000 Dope Game two-thee 
 In your face, 3D baby done one mo' 
 And another and another and another 
 We're dropping like bird shit 
 Ain't stopping, uh
