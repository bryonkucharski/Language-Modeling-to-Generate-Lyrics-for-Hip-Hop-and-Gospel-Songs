 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 South side of the map, we spectacular 
 Sensei and the Don right back at ya 
 It's going dooown, and you know it's goin' down 
 The roughest and toughest, representin H-town 
 Pound for pound, yo we can't be touched 
 When the mike get clutched, boys get a head rush 
 (Lil KeKe) 
 Here it is, plain and simple your nuts took 
 You fuckin' with a crook that really be off the hook 
 Check the books, we profitin six digits or better 
 It's the Houston trendsetter mixin chips with cheddar 
 Been the roughest on the scene since the year nine-three 
 Now I shake down and break down punk niggas for free 
 When I flip my currency, it's multiplied by three 
 One of a kind in 99 on a spendin spree 
 You better ask Big G, before fuckin' wit Ke 
 I crucify lyrically anyone steppin to me 
 And as for Big Pokey, he's one of the throwdest in the game 
 When he stretch out, catch out or feel his pain 
 You know my name, say what, the youngest Don of them all 
 Bentley sittin' tall, remote control screens fall 
 It's the way a playa ball, keep ice on his wrist 
 Like this and like that, like that and like this 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 South side of the map, we spectacular 
 Sensei and the Don right back at ya

 The roughest and toughest, representin H-town 
 Pound for pound, yo we can't be touched 
 When the mike get clutched, boys get a head rush 
 (Big Pokey) 
 It's that Ke-sta and that Big Po-deina 
 Certified tag teamers, we'll rock the arena 
 With the point of a finger we serve niggas subpoenas 
 Then rip up singles and split the money between us 
 I dip a six through my city when I'm bendin the corner 
 Presidential on my wrist bout to give me pneumonia 
 From H-town to Arizona we CD sellers 
 Got niggas chests itchin like they swallowed some Wellers 
 (Lil KeKe) 
 Lil Ke and Po-deine, we so crispy clean 
 Bubble eyed European, Jag lit with screen 
 Princess cut and pinky rings, I'm a lyrical King 
 You know the type of shit you only see in your dreams 
 I make 'em fiend, pull up on chrome 19s 
 I mash on gasoline for my bread and cream 
 The only color is green, I sip drank and lean 
 Big Poke and Lil Ke, we southside's best team 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 South side of the map, we spectacular

 The roughest and toughest, representin H-town 
 Pound for pound, yo we can't be touched 
 When the mike get clutched, boys get a head rush 
 (Big Pokey) 
 You know a pit off the chain like to bite the mike 
 When I'm on the pitchers mound, best to strap your Nikes 
 Throwin' strikes, mobbin over busters and parasites 
 Precise and on point, bout to light up your life 
 I'm in your chest G, and it's a fact you can't digest me 
 When niggas test me, I make it messy 
 And that's for real, I issue out blows you can't shield 
 Niggas wigs get peeled with these verses I spill 
 Best get up, I enter the door, wrist lit up 
 When I aim that ho at you, you get hit up (get up) (Bling) 
 So much ice on my arm, make my arm go numb 
 Charm like a light show, can't you see I'm the bomb 
 Knockin' heads with the Don, representin our turf 
 Got stripes on our shirt just for puttin' in work 
 Hittin it where it hurts, spectacular 
 Lil Ke and Po-yo, right back at ya 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 South side of the map, we spectacular 
 Sensei and the Don right back at ya
