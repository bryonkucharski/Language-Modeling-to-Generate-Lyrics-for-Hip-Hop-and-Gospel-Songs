(B.o.B) 
 Let 'em hate 
 'Cause I'm straight 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all 
 They gonna have to call a nigga MJ, MJ 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 (B.o.B) 
 Yeah, 
 I'm Hotter than a sauna 
 Hotter than a summer 
 Throwin' shit down, call me California 
 Kush is my cologne yeah you know the aroma 
 I make the whole club open like a soda 
 I got hella haters, haters on my boner 
 'Cause I'm ballin on these niggas quota after quota 
 Nowadays everybody got something to say 
 Like a fuckin' interviewer on the phoner 
 Where the girls with a good head on your shoulder 
 When I'm on campus show me your diploma 
 Good brains, good student 
 Go crazy, go stupid 
 It's me east side bachelor 
 Kicked back kush'ed out to the maximum 
 Fly like traveler, high like a passenger 
 On purp, on lavender 
 So I laugh as I pass you up 
 When you running down the sideline 
 Niggas on the bench trying to grab at ya 
 (B.o.B) 
 Let 'em hate 
 'Cause I'm straight 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 They gonna have to call a nigga MJ 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day 
 And you know don't even know what I got 
 And you don't even know when this dropped 
 And you don't even know what I'm about 
 You know you know you know it won't stop 
 (Nelly) 
 You talking about money than you calling my name 
 You talking about flipping money than you talking my game 
 You talk about gettin' money than we talking the same 
 You talk about small money than you talking it lame 
 I'm with that so mellow, whole other level 
 I'm gunna tell her to get in the trunk, heavy metal 
 5.0 yeah bag is little 
 (Guess whose back) 
 Uh huh, no riddle 
 Two bad bitches 
 Guess whose in the middle 
 315 yeah guess whose eating biddles? 
 Used to eat kibbles, but the dis wont get it 
 If it don't come fully equipped then don't get it 
 The seats ain't leather my man then don't sit it 
 If you ain't got no rubbers on hand then don't hit it 
 Here what I tell ya man? don't play with it, nope nope, don't play with it 
 I collect money like child support 
 I gotta get it 'cause I gotta pay child support 
 'Cause my baby momma think I'm at the slot machine 
 I like soccer moms I'm on the soccer team 
 From the block to the board room 
 We can do it in the streets or in the court room 
 I put a hoop in the house that's a court room 
 Now a nigga shootin jumpers from the fourth room 
 (B.o.B) 
 Let 'em hate 
 'Cause I'm straight 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 They gonna have to call a nigga MJ, MJ 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 And you know don't even know what I got 
 And you don't even know when this dropped 
 And you don't even know what I'm about 
 You know you know you know it won't stop 
 (B.o.B) 
 Drinks on us, freaks on dick, haters on hush 
 All eyes on us everything you see the Suvs pull up 
 Down like that whenever we creep up 
 And we slide to the back and we stay linked up 
 Why the hell they hating on us 
 I'm living my dream don't wake me up 
 Ballin so long It's boring 
 Ballin so long I'm yawning 
 Haulin so long that I gotta let the flow cool off 'cause my feet just scorching 
 Anybody trying to get up on my level better have to feel misfortune 
 And you ain't never seen this brooke 
 You like "can anybody tell me where the door is?" 
 I will never ever ever have a shortage 
 18 damn months been touring 
 And I don't ever see my house, my couch, or my bedroom set seems foreign 
 But I always knew there'd be bitterness 
 These niggas speak fluent, gibberish 
 Life can be ridiculous 
 So I ball like this on these hypocrites 
 (B.o.B) 
 Let 'em hate 
 'Cause I'm straight 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 They gonna have to call a nigga MJ, MJ 
 I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day 
 And you know don't even know what I got 
 And you don't even know when this dropped 
 And you don't even know what I'm about 
 You know you know you know it won't stop
