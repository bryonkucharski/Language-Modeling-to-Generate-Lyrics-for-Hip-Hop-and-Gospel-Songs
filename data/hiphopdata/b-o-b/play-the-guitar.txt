B.o.B, play the guitar! 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 (B.o.B) 
 Well it's B.o.B, flyer than a stewardess 
 Fresh to death like I'm dressed for a eulogy 
 My outfit's retarded, my flow is the stupidest, dumb 
 I'll probably need to after school tutor it 
 Ballin' on beats got hops like breweries 
 Sideline haters need to chill where the cooler is 
 Dr. J flow, you can call me Julius 
 Y'all take shots, I direct, movie shit 
 Grand Hustle champion, all I do is ball 'em up 
 Niggas startin' conversations just so they can talk us up 
 If you ain't runnin' shit you can't even walk with us 
 Still I'm chill blunt wider than a coffee cup 
 You know it's B.o, I do this for the people 
 Stackin' C-notes, pockets on Cee-Lo 
 Uhm, I'm killin' 'em mama, I'm talkin' hockey mask 
 I do it to death, swag on body bag 
 This beat is out of here, it's gone 
 Farewell, so long, so long 
 I'm sayonara, the way I'm gone 
 So far away there ain't no signal on my phone 
 'Cause I'm a star, so when I hit the bar it's like Cheers 
 Everybody knows who you are 
 Who would've thought I would've took it this far 
 Play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 Play the guitar, play the guitar, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 (3000) Play the guitar, (3000) play the guitar 
 (3000) Play the guitar

 Man, I keep havin' this re-occurring image where I'm 
 Standing on top of Church's Chicken playing guitar 
 Looked over and I see B.o.B with this strange cigar 
 He's standing on top of Dunkin' Donuts, it's like he own it 
 We at the corner of give it to 'em and they don't want it 
 We out somewhere and me in Europe, they out here yawnin' 
 My niggas threw out way too much jewelry, my chain lonely 
 But they don't know about black pearls, but I will show them 
 "Why the world sleepin' on black girls?" Hey I don't know, man 
 Silverback Stacks, jumpin' out the jungle 
 Blowin' tiger stripe bubbles with "Go to Hell" bubble gum 
 When I was younger space shuttle got hung in front of everyone 
 And grandmum tells me to stay humble but do not un-der-stand 
 When they leave mumbles to make 'em throw up they arms and hands 
 Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants 
 One leg at a time, like they do pay us no mind 
 But everybody look at why we do it, it takes us more time 
 Excuse me if I'm no exhibitionist accordin' to the internet 
 3000 got a big old dic-tionary full of words 
 He must know how to use 'em 
 It also says I play the violin and that ain't true but 
 You give me six strings and a pick 
 And I will make a guitar talk, why, I ain't gotta say shit 
 And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument 
 'Cause if you're mad at your dad or mum, you can grab it and strum 
 Eat your cabbage and corn, by the time you're done 
 You will finally realize that they meant you no harm 
 They was tryin' to save your crazy ass from what's to come 
 3000 muthafucka Mr. Tell-Me-Somethin' 
 My partner say I should practice more, I know 
 They be saying I sound like I'm out of tune 
 I ask them, do you cry in tune nigga? Do you laugh in tune? 
 (3000) Play the guitar, (3000) play the guitar, (3000) play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, play the guitar, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, play the guitar, (3000) play the guitar 
 B.o.B, play the guitar 
 B.o.B, B.o.B, B.o.B, play the guitar
