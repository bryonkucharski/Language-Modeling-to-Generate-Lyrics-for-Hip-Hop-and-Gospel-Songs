(Intro/Chorus: B.o.B) 
 Well she strike like a lightning bolt 
 She highly electric, a thousand volts yeah 
 She'll shock you up out your clothes 
 One strike then there she go 
 I'm talkin' 'bout her 
 Oh yeah! 
 I'm talkin' 'bout her 
 Oh yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout... 
 (Repeat 2X over end of Chorus) 
 (Talkin' 'bout her man) (Oh yeah) 
 (Playboy Tre) 
 Now baby girl's highly electric, cute but deceptive 
 Straight high voltage, fool with the poses 
 Will I smoke it? Ye ain't gotta ask me 
 I make her strip like Puff did Cassie 
 Frank White, Lil' Kim, lick her on her chest 
 Ain't nothin' like a tit with a lil' Henn' 
 Got her new, tryin' to get it in 
 Sayin' shit like "Girl just once let me put it in" 
 I'm talkin' 'bout her 
 Talkin' 'bout girl, you fine as fuck 
 So talk about me, up in that P 
 Leg to the West, one leg to the East (spread 'em) 
 And let me go deep, like Roddy White 
 Stood up in it and the girl got hype 
 But man I don't know, somethin' ain't right 
 Shawty got different niggaz callin all night 
 I'm talkin' 'bout her 
 (Mickey Factz) 
 Jack in, jack in 
 Givin' me a feeling like a Blackwood, Blackwood 
 Momma's so appealing and I got this, option 
 That we can get it poppin' 
 And right after I plug her 
 I can take her to an outlet for shopping, shopping 
 But I don't know if I trust her 
 So I gotta go, peace out, he's out 
 Like all up in my head tweaked out 
 Keep out, I don't know what to think, she's out 
 On the town gettin' frisky 
 Raising the hairs on my arm when she with me 
 Shorty got charm 
 Lucky just to be with her, breathe with her 
 But T-R-E's with her, and he did her 
 Deliver her to me, currently, it worries me 
 What her and he did vertically 
 If I see her with him I pass out 
 No bolts, no volts or pulse I black out 
 Ow! 
 (Over end of Chorus) 
 (I'm talkin' 'bout her bro) (You mean her?) 
 (Yeah her bro) (Hehehehe) 
 (B.o.B) 
 I'm talkin' 'bout she's so psychadelic 
 She's so cool you can tell she gellin (hehe!) 
 And Led Zeppelin sell it 
 If she were a statue, she'd be a relic 
 Strikin like venom, in all white denim 
 Sugar in the brain cells on my neurons 
 I'm on her like the Hamburgler on buns 
 Runnin' like the marathon you run 
 Someone gave her a medallion 
 Kickin like kung-fu from Shaolin 
 Which means how she looks is arousing 
 And so I'm thinkin' how lucky her blouse is, yeah 
 Built like brick houses 
 Appraised at about eight hundred thousand, heh 
 And so the whole place shoutin 
 So for her I gotta scream this ballad, like
