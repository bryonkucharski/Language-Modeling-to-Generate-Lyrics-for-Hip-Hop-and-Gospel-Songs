(B.o.B) 
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my fucking mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 Out of my, out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind (Mind, mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of my fucking mind 
 Out of my fucking mind (Mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of my fucking mind, g-g-golly, oh my 
 I was doing fine, once upon a time 
 Then my brain left and it didn't say bye 
 Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind 
 Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined 
 So paranoid of espionage 
 I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds 
 My brain is on vacation, they telling me 
 And I'm bi-polar to the severity 
 And I need medication, apparently 
 And some electrocompulsive therapy 
 I am a rebel but yes I'm so militant 
 Still I'm eligible for disabilities 
 I am psychotic but there is no remedy 
 This is not figurative, this is literally 
 If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility 
 See, man I'm so out there, I slap fives with E.T. 
 I don't need a feature, they don't wanna eat a la cart when I'm on this beat 
 If you feel the same as me, then you gotta agree 
 I'm out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my fucking mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 Out of my, out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind (Mind, mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of my fucking mind 
 Out of my fucking mind (Mind, mind, mind) 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 What's your name? B.o.B? 
 So, they callin' you Bob? 
 Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the Bob 
 Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a heartthrob 
 Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm) 
 You don't need a feature? 
 Nigga, I'm the feature 
 You gon' be the priest, and imma be the preacher 
 You can be the he-man, imma be the she-ra 
 You can be the Grim, imma be the Reaper 
 Now, now airplanes in the night skies 
 Are like shooting stars? 
 Well, you gon' really need a wish right now 
 When my goons come through and start shooting stars 
 You know, I'm all about shoes and cars 
 I'm kinda drunk off blue Bacardi 
 I told Baby when I get my new advance 
 Imma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti 
 You know, I graduated summa cum laude 
 That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati 
 And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up 
 I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati 
 Hallelujah! 
 (B.o.B) 
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my fucking mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 Out of my, out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind (Mind, mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of my fucking mind 
 Out of my fucking mind (Mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of it 
 I can't seem to come out of it 
 What's going on inside of my head? 
 It feels like I'm being John Malkovich 
 Ladies and gentlemen, please turn it down a bit 
 There's an announcement, I like to announce (It...) 
 Wait, how am I'm supposed to announce this shit? 
 I don't need this song, I don't need this nigga 
 'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia 
 Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas 
 Na na na na boo boo, wouldn't want to be ya 
 Never turnin' back, how you think I got here? 
 And I'm never slowing down, fuck was that a deer? 
 If you got a problem, step to the office 
 Matter of fact, nevermind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-otch 
 You have no idea 
 That's why they call me B dot been a maniac ever since I was knee-high 
 I'm gonna need help, someone call Charter, maybe call FEMA 
 'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many steps on my Visa 
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my fucking mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm 
 Out of my, out of my mind 
 I'm, I'm, I'm 
 I'm out of my, out of my mind (Mind, mind, mind, mind) 
 I'm out of my fucking mind 
 Out of my fucking mind (Mind, mind, mind) 
 Wait, if I'm here and you're there? 
 And if I'm here and you're there? 
 And if I'm here and you're there? 
 And if I'm here and you're there? 
 And if I'm here and you're there? 
 And if I'm here and you're there? 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Um, yeah, yeah 
 Nicki, B.o.B, hoe 
 (Shh... they might be listening)
