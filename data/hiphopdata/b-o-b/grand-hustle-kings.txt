[Intro] [T.I. talking]: 
 Uncle Quincy they gon dig this 
 Haha, hold up 
 Yeah! 
 All right people, I wanna see you dance if your type forever 
 Get your hands up, say hey 
 And shawty you're looking good 
 Come here, let me see you dance 
 Now get ya hands up 
 Your hearts 
 T.I.: 
 I got to the park, super cool, stupid hot 
 He the freshest from his fitted down to the shoes and socks 
 Can you wanna like it, couldn't care less if you do or not 
 A reminder for those of you who forget 
 Here's the king partna', ya ain't bout to say a big deal I'm not 
 Fifty mill I got, double down why not 
 177 Aston Martin cash and carry off the lot 
 They say money talk but listen Shorty 'cause I talk a lot 
 Incredible, my pockets and a cherry red drop 
 Your money funny, big diamonds in the words red boss 
 We're gonna be smoking the city when I come kicking come and witness 
 8 hundred young women all here for Young Fif 
 Listen, if I really dig her, let her meet my uncle Quincy 
 Catch up with me suckers gonna need a solid month of Wendy 
 Many moons will it take you buffoons and many goons 
 Presents fill up any room, King back gimme room 
 B.o.B: 
 I told the World what I'm gon do, check the charts if you want proof 
 Number 1 and number 2, I'll take the rest, don't mind if I do 
 Pull my seat up to this table in the game, where's my food 
 But frankly, I accomplished what they said I'll never do 
 Or maybe you've been sleeping or snoozing on me before 
 Or possibly, blocking me from opening doors 
 And everybody surprised now 
 3 years down the road 
 But where was everybody when albums wasn't in stores 
 Who cares if it ain't fair 
 'Cause I mean? 
 Bob on beast, Bob on blast, Bob is everything you say 
 It's finesse, an expression, an emphasis on my name 
 Talking record labels corporations this is entertainment 
 Here is what I meant 
 They be like "hey Bob try this 
 Put on this shirt, put on these jeans 
 Put on this hat, that'd be the shit 
 Rap it like that, sing it like this 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 That'll be a hit 
 What's his name?" 
 Well I'm in my own lane and that's why I ain't that" 
 Young Dro: 
 Hey look, came on so hard 
 You don't see the star in me 
 Dro, I can do anything, you don't see the heart in me 
 Pressure becomes combustible 
 Wheels squeezing the arteries of haters 
 Plus my uncle is Quincy Jones so pardon me 
 I like riding a may 
 (?) 
 When it come to money boy, we got that? 
 Looking bad as ever, mansion in the panamerica 
 Why sick, I'm extravagant and clever 
 Will damage you, it's whatever 
 Grand Hustle Kings 
 I won't get off the mic until that thing starts sizzling 
 Block you like a histamine 
 This is really history 
 Watch ya old lady 'fore I slip in with this hickory 
 Like Elmo y'all tickle me 
 Why I still be ripping beats 
 Backing fantastic, tell me that you've been listening 
 White on white, drop back joint 
 T.I in a ride out 
 2 of the best in the game, what you gotta decide about
