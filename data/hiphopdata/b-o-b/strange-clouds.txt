Yeah, ha ha 
 Oh you already know what we gon' do 
 Hey 
 Verse 1: B.o.B 
 Well if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly 
 I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian 
 And um, imma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan 
 Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians 
 You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally 
 I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is 
 The way I ride on the beat man 
 I beat every street, it's done so effortlessly 
 Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no 
 Inception 
 in this bitch 
 I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf 
 No last call, to the bartender, what you got left? 
 Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah 
 All night we celebrate, 'cause we everywhere and you not there 
 All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds 
 All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds 
 Verse 2: Lil Wayne 
 Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded, mindin' my own data 
 Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger 
 It's Tunechi Lee, you bitch you, you hot as an igloo 
 Kick back on that glock, call that Jiu Jitsu 
 Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number two pencil 
 These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you 
 My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe 
 I dive in that pussy, ya I belly flop, I jack knife 
 And shit, tell my homies that I say it's a party 
 Yeah, got that tech for technical difficulties 
 I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog 
 Piru, gangsters, outlaws! 
 All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds 
 All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds 
 Young Moola baby 
 B.o.B, fuck with me! 
 Verse 3: B.o.B 
 Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes definitely 
 Up in the studio, I got all my necessities 
 Look, if you want that real shit, you made the right selection 
 I'm Decatur till I die, yes I rep that definitely 
 They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity? 
 I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection 
 And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin' 
 To a nigga from the hood 
 Tryin' to aim for the top, I didn't even need no directions 
 I just wake up then I roll up the purp 
 But these niggas wake up on my dick, at least have some breakfast first 
 Nigga keep your nourishment first, and your mind on my lyrics 
 'Cause what you hopin' to accomplish, I already did it bitch! 
 All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds
