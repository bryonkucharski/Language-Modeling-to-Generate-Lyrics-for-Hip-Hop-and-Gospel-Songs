Fuck the whole world man, we are the freshest 
 I'm higher than a baby on a seesaw with Precious 
 Y'all just the messengers, we are the message 
 You bang on wax, I beef off the record 
 Back like I trap, you can't spit this flow 
 I slang water, slang flour, I'mma get this dough 
 Behind my zipper where her lipstick go 
 Like an embryo in a hooker, I'm in this ho 
 Nickel! 
 Right off the rip, nigga we are the dopest 
 Y'all in front of the camera, we are the focus 
 Y'all are the watered down, we are the potent 
 Y'all call y'all bosses, we call the GOAT then 
 We ball fo' sho' and, here we are fast cats, fly 
 Me and bombs over baghdad, B.o.B 
 The only thing I hate to see is hate 
 In the place to be 
 What an incredible place to be 
 Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly 
 Ain't no other place I'd rather be 
 Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money 
 What about nines and super freaks? 
 Bottle of patron, just roll that green 
 Put it down for the team 
 So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot 
 What an incredible place to be 
 I'm feeling like Cassius, at last it's the greatest 
 Angry intelligent rap, mad innovative 
 Y'all blast garbage shit, we blast the haters 
 Hip Hop's a community, we smack the neighbors 
 The last men standing when the shit get real 
 When the rest up we stepped up like a 6 inch heel 
 I'm getting used to how this rich shit feel 
 But don't judge me, I'm doing my best to make my dick sit still 
 Fresh in the strip club, he be the realest 
 Drugs got her number, she feel this 
 I said I need to love before I out her, not anything like a spouse 
 Told her the roof's missing, but everything's on the house 
 Got a table full of liquor, somethings gotta hit the spot 
 She might even put them on the glass if we mix a lot 
 Get her nice and buzzed 
 The night'll end when we decide it does 
 What an incredible place to be 
 Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly 
 Ain't no other place I'd rather be 
 Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money 
 What about nines and super freaks? 
 Bottle of patron, just roll that green 
 Put it down for the team 
 So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot 
 What an incredible place to be 
 You already know nigga, we be's the flyest 
 You might've seen high, but nigga we get the highest 
 Far as lighters, I need at least a 3 week supply with 
 Now all this pussy thrown at me, now I'm knee deep in 'gina 
 Bitch I'm bossin', fuck around and unleash Goliath 
 I go deep and get your poon all wet, call me Poseidon 
 I'm a giant, I eat beats and I burn good, that's my diet 
 B.o.B and Slaughterhouse 5 
 Nine, every time I scribble a rhyme down 
 Niggas be like (that's a riot) 
 Crooked, Ortiz, sick with the flow (that's a riot) 
 Or explosive, know it be like Floetry 
 So it's Ambrosis, I wrote it, know that it's cool to quote it 
 Joe! 
 L one hell of a relevant MC, felon ya melon is empty 
 So elementary, but Neverlands be residing in our pens, C 
 R, double O-K, E-D-I 
 Far up and away, 'cause we be high 
 What an incredible place to be 
 Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly 
 Ain't no other place I'd rather be 
 Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money 
 What about nines and super freaks? 
 Bottle of patron, just roll that green 
 Put it down for the team
