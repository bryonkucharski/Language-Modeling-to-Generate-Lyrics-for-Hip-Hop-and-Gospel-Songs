I guess I bit off more than I could chew 
 And nobody told me, nobody told me 
 Had it all and never knew 
 'Cause nobody told me 
 Nobody told me money don't make you rich 
 And if it did, I'm missing something 
 Nobody told me you can lose when you win 
 And if they did, I'd still be missing 
 Who knew that this much success will make it so hard 
 But that's to accept the fact that I can't go back where I left 
 And back track my steps, back track my steps 
 The records I dropped, so massive, so large 
 It makes it hard for hip-hop to digest 
 The things that I do, I guess if it's true 
 Well fuck it, a nigga too good to be the best 
 Too good to be the best, too good to be stressed 
 'Cause this the type of life, too good to regret 
 You know money don't buy you no respect 
 Nigga no respect, nigga no respect yeah 
 So what the hell is that? 
 I'm tryna recreate the past that I never had 
 And smash grills I could never smash 
 And live fantasies that'll never last 
 I guess I bit off more than I could chew 
 And nobody told me, nobody told me 
 Had it all and never knew 
 'Cause nobody told me 
 Nobody told me money don't make you rich 
 And if it did, I'm missing something 
 Nobody told me you can lose when you win 
 And if they did, I'd still be missing 
 I ran away from home just to try to make a million 
 Yeah, just to try to make a million 
 And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling 
 When you look around and what you really need is missing 
 It's like, it's like I'm suffering from a sickness 
 And can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription 
 Or diagnose the illness 
 Can't leave it in the book, can't buy from the dealer 
 And I find that ironic 
 Yeah, I find that ironic 
 How I can buy anything that I ever wanted 
 But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing 
 They always say that mo money, mo problems 
 I guess I, I guess I should've listened to the warning 
 I guess I, I guess I should anticipate the stormy weather 
 I guess I'd illustrate it if it's good but however 
 Well if it's clever 
 I couldn't find the words to say it better 
 I'm knee-deep within these endeavors 
 But all that glitters with gold is not treasure 
 I'm ready for whatever, I never let er 
 I work even better when I'm under pressure 
 They say money don't make you rich 
 'Cause you can't buy shit that can make you better, word 
 Nobody told me money don't make you rich 
 And if it did, I'm missing something 
 Nobody told me you can lose when you win 
 And if they did, I'd still be missing 
 I guess I bit off more than I could chew 
 And nobody told me, nobody told me 
 Had it all and never knew 
 'Cause nobody told me
