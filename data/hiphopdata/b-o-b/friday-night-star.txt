She was a Friday night star, 
 Everyone knew her name but the fame didn't take her far, 
 And she was in awe, 
 Trying to imitate the lifestyle that she saw, 
 And there was no cars, 
 Living illusions, 
 Dream illusive chasing cars, 
 A tongue so harsh, 
 She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark 
 So juat wait up a minute lady, 
 Pop them breaks for a minute you're so mistaken, 
 I say you look awfully shady, 
 Or maybe you're just contemplating a Friday night star, 
 (She's a superstar) 
 A Friday night star, 
 A Friday night star 
 (She's a superstar), 
 A Friday night star, 
 Jessica, I'm thinking I could probably take her home and marry her, 
 But eveything I keep on hearing makes me scared of her, 
 And now I know I probably should have never messed with her, 
 But she got me grabbing my coat and keys and I did I did, 
 I get on the express way and speed to her crib, her crib, 
 I just loose control every time I see all those hips and lips, 
 And it feels just like an evil deed, 
 But I slip, I slip, 
 So juat wait up a minute lady, 
 Pop them breaks for a minute you're so mistaken, 
 I say you look awfully shady, 
 Or maybe you're just contemplating a Friday night star, 
 (She's a superstar) 
 A Friday night star, 
 A Friday night star 
 (She's a superstar), 
 A Friday night star, 
 Yeah, yeah, 
 She's dressed for the Friday night lights, 
 With her boots zipped up, her jeans tight, 
 Wonderin, tryna find the right type, 
 But there's dogs round here and they might bite, 
 I sit back, then stare in amazement, 
 As these girls go awfully crazy, 
 They don't know me, 
 But they know that they play my song on the radio station, 
 And I climb on top of the stage, 
 Wait for the beat when it drop, then I sing, 
 Everybody get poured up, then drink, 
 Then by the end of the night they faint, 
 After the pause, I fade to the dark, 
 Everybody please give a round of applause, 
 I leave to the car, she waits for me patiently by the bar 
 So juat wait up a minute lady, 
 Pop them breaks for a minute you're so mistaken, 
 I say you look awfully shady, 
 Or maybe you're just contemplating a Friday night star, 
 (She's a superstar) 
 A Friday night star, 
 A Friday night star 
 (She's a superstar), 
 A Friday night star, 
 So juat wait up a minute lady, 
 Pop them breaks for a minute you're so mistaken, 
 I say you look awfully shady, 
 Or maybe you're just contemplating a Friday night star, 
 (She's a superstar) 
 A Friday night star, 
 A Friday night star 
 (She's a superstar),
