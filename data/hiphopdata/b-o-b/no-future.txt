Yeah, yeah, uhm, hey, I eat it like dinner 
 You see this shit I gotta deal with from these beginners? 
 I ain't circusin' around with these clown ass n-ggas 
 You snappin' at the heels of a world class sprinter 
 Some may call this bullyin', some may call this bossin' 
 Check the letter, man, you know I'm all city varsity 
 Walk up on my field, you will get carried off it 
 We gon' need a body bag and we gon' need a coffin 
 Who am I battling? I ain't even exhausted 
 You can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous 
 A sea of great whites, you are a dolphin 
 If I was you, I would be a little more cautious 
 I'm way too high for you to look at 
 The future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies 
 This is target practice but I don't even pull the f-cking trigger anymore 
 'Cause it's just a waste of bullets 
 Come and get these p-ssy's, wipe them off the floor 
 I'm guessing they was hoping for some different results 
 I'm guessing they was guessing 'cause they wasn't really sure 
 But f-ck it, I guess I'ma have to let these n-ggas know 
 So I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick 
 Got my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis 
 Eastside representer, reppin' with authority 
 And I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics 
 Lookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages 
 But we already know that, so that is all to get 
 Check the name tag, you know who the roster is 
 ATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch 
 Like I ain't never had a mic 
 Fresh to death, I see you in the afterlife 
 I eat bars, eat beasts for my appetite 
 You wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite 
 What I gotta do to get some solidarity? 
 Apparently, I need to speak with some more clarity 
 No luck needed, know no charity 
 And I'mma grown man, don't need p-ssy to take care of me 
 B to the O, I said it once befo' 
 If I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote 
 Already graduated, yeah, you see the cap 'n' robe 
 But now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope 
 I'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin 
 Call me Jack o' Lantern, I get head like pumpkins 
 It's nothin', roll up the stuffin' 
 Put it in the oven, gettin' baked like muffins 
 If you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya 
 To my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to 
 Body blow, uppercut, I do more than brusin' 
 Keep f-cking with me and you ain't gon' have no future
