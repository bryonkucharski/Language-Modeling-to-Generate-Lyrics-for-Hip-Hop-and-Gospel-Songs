[Verse One]: 
 I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits 
 Been through too many goodbyes 
 And I can't say that I been so innocent 
 'Cause I told my share of lies 
 But it seems like whenever I get closer 
 Love pushes me away 
 And just when I thought my chances were over 
 I stared my future in the face 
 I looked an angel in the eye 
 And since then I've been paralyzed 
 Something told me she'd be mine 
 And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi) 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi 
 [Verse Two]: 
 I made a lot of broken promises 
 I had no respect for words 
 And I thought that I'd gotten all that I'm against 
 Until I ran into her 
 She whispers to me and it pulls me closer 
 Now I can't stay away (no I can't stay away) 
 And now I feel like all my pain is over 
 I stared my future in the face 
 I looked an angel in the eye 
 And since then I've been paralyzed 
 Something told me she'd be mine 
 And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi) 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi 
 [Verse Three][B.O.B]: 
 Well, I used to be mellow 
 Until both her eyes connected like a metro 
 How you think you ain't special? 
 C'mon girl, you had me at, "Hello" 
 And so we started to kick it like a pedal 
 And in love we started to fall bel-low 
 I mean below 
 And as the story goes 
 I started doing shows 
 Eventually, I landed on the west coast 
 So I've been with the flow 
 And then I called your phone 
 So then we ended up runnin' around town like Goldy 
 Hypnotized with cinnamon eyes, I'm frozen 
 Back and forth we would go yo-yoing 
 And I'm hopin' 
 That you will see how I was feelin' wide open 
 And I'm not 
 And I'm not tryin' to be imposin' 
 But if it's you and me baby, I'm rollin' 
 Yeah! 
 I looked an angel in the eye 
 And since then I've been paralyzed 
 Something told me she'd be mine 
 And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi) 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi 
 Hi (hi)... hi (hi) 
 And I knew it before she said hi
