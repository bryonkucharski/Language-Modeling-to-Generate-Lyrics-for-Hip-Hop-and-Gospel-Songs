(Intro: Morgan Freeman) 
 As the war between light and darkness continues 
 Heroes and villains become harder to identify 
 Kindred spirits separated at birth 
 Fighting for their place in time to be solidified 
 The clock ticks faster and faster 
 While time runs a marathon in this babylon 
 But see, the end is only the beginning 
 The beginning of the calm before the storm 
 (Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate 
 It seems the bigger I get, it's the more they get mad at me 
 Cause it ain't no rules inside this fight that we battlin' 
 And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it 
 And I swear it's like a fucked up reality 
 But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate, I guess 
 And I ain't too big on duality, but 
 You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me 
 So fly, no gravity 
 So high, Mount Everest 
 And the show must go on, yes 
 But I don't have to act in it 
 And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies of my channel 
 And there ain't no computer that can hack it 
 It just don't have the capacity 
 Hell naw that ain't happenin' 
 You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga we mastered it 
 Y'all workin' on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes 
 Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we Catholics 
 And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador 
 Official, no artificial preservatives or additives 
 I love it all, but I ain't attached to it 
 They call this a game because it is exactly 
 (Hook x2: B.o.B) 
 Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling 
 That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking 
 Bombs away (Bombs away) 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 And it seems like, in the grand scheme of it all 
 The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all 
 How do they exist if we don't know who they are? 
 They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods 
 Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all 
 From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve 
 But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed 
 And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge 
 Fuck rules, fuck boss 
 You can be whatever you want 
 You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold 
 In the springs or the falls, you could never see it all 
 If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls? 
 Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far 
 Now I be beast mode up on these bars 
 Freak out a beat and then beat it up raw 
 Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety 
 I won't need viagra naw, even if I had a dog 
 I be the canine, I'd have a ball 
 Better watch out when you cross my yard 
 I am a flame, I am the spark 
 I am in drive, y'all are in park 
 Look at my shot, look at the arc 
 Look at the crowd as soon as I start 
 Look in they eyes and look in they hearts 
 Two middle fingers straight at the law 
 Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord 
 Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords 
 UFOs don't make any noise 
 When they're travelin' hyper speed, so welcome aboard 
 (Hook x2: B.o.B) 
 (Outro: Morgan Freeman) 
 As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity 
 Unveiling the grim reality of duality 
 In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt 
 Truth has many shades 
 It's not a matter of black and white, but gray 
 Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis 
 Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?
