(Hook: Chris Brown) 
 If anybody feeling fresh in the building 
 Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now 
 And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them 
 I know they feeling me now 
 And if you too fresh in the building 
 Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now 
 And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them 
 I know they feeling me now 
 (Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for 
 Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go 
 Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know 
 And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code 
 My back then couldn't get dro, cause back then I was this broke 
 That's why I got so many hustles, Bruh man from the fifth floor 
 What would you do in the middle of the winter 
 When the sun goes down and it gets cold? 
 Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows 
 And my brother was always fresher 
 I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go 
 So that's why now this the type of life that I live for 
 Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit 
 I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach 
 Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing 
 Feel with my y'all, I'm this close 
 Spent my whole life chasin' shit, where's Nabisco? 
 My past memories, I miss those 
 Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for 
 (Verse 2: T.I.) 
 I'm fresh off my pit-stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc 
 Get shit pop when my shit drop, no hip-hop, this Tip hop 
 I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long 
 Till you hear me on a B.o.B song, some chick gettin' my skeet on 
 To touch the sole of my feet, G you gon' have to get your reach on 
 I'm up all the way high, all the way fly on the ground and I'm off the radar 
 Bernie Madoff money, dawg got killers paid off with it all 
 I got the juice, could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call 
 Don't get your part and not too hard, I disregard what you say 
 Back up the trunk and pass the buck, here's where I'm stoppin' today 
 Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away we too ill, ill 
 That's how we got arenas, dumps, and stadiums feel 
 How you feel? 
 (Verse 3: B.o.B) 
 And I'm still here with a black whip from the strange clouds 
 And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down 
 Still here for the east side, ain't a thing change but the bank account 
 Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down 
 And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard 
 Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad 
 With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts 
 And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards 
 I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark 
 Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart 
 My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark 
 They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like "Oh God!" 
 From a poor child to on top like a mohawk 
 But I always knew I'd go far bike a gas truck with no park 
 So no applause, hold the applause 
 Just put your hand up if you know the song
