Ooh, unsuccessful people talk the most shit that's just what they do 
 No squares in my circle 'cause they don't fit we don't fuck with you 
 So that's why making money makes the most sense get your revenue 
 So all I do is work and get high so excuse me for my 
 Bloody red eyes [x4] 
 Ooh, niggas always talking cause it so cheap 
 Ooh, this is how it look when you don't sleep 
 Ooh, strangers always acting like they know me 
 Ooh, fresh up off work 'bout to roll tree 
 I roll a whole tree, this shit is so deep 
 I got the whole world, wishing for the old me 
 And I don't say shit, even if they owed me 
 All I remember is, what my momma told me, my momma told me

 Snakes, they always smiling in your faces 
 Fake friends, yeah they just fake it till they make it 
 Until they make it, that's when they act the fakest 
 Shit go from "You like family" to "Fuck no, we ain't related" 
 So fuck no, we ain't related there's no affiliation 
 Money always take a good thing and complicate shit 
 How you stop yourself from a mistake before you make it 
 If you never seen a problem can't solve for the equation 
 So niggas out here underestimating 
 Even a fuck you takes up too much time and energy to say it 
 And if time is money I won't mind in the AM 
 Don't wake me in the AM unless you talking 8 M's 
 Who really down? Who really gon hold you down? 
 Them niggas ain't really your dog, they be fucking your bitch when you out of town 
 You was blind till now 
 Every hand that come to the king to protect, they be close 'cause they want that crown 
 But soon as the shine wears off they're nowhere to be found 
 Down
