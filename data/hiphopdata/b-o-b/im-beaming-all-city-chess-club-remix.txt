I'm beamin' 
 Asher Roth: 
 My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis 
 Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad 
 The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction 
 Can't you see that I am beaming? I'll be leaving in a second 
 Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions 
 At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action 
 A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present 
 The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith 
 Yes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But) 
 Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause) 
 Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown 
 And even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But) 
 Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported 
 To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole) 
 This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic 
 As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow 
 Charles Hamilton: 
 Rey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear 
 Of makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual 
 Though a spirit you owe, church final 
 Your funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire 
 Or titles, or tidal waves 
 Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98 
 To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!) 
 Boa constrictor, chokin' (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!) 
 Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Nigga!) (Beam!) 
 Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Nigga!) (Beam!) 
 Love, I get none, like sayin' no to niggas 
 Hamiltonian's loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (Niggas!) 
 I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display 
 Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won't go away 
 I keep pressin' like my phone is afraid 
 To be the star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say 
 Lupe Fiasco: 
 Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together 
 Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather 
 Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap 
 You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme 
 You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris 
 Foolishness, Lu been doin' this since super letters 
 So I can't spell and can't mail it out 
 If you can't feel, it's too full, you can't peel it out 
 Showboatin' at the show, but you can't sell it out 
 I'm on the sea shepherd deck, helpin' the whales out 
 All my egos in the mirror, checkin' themselves out 
 Tweeters in the trunk, helpin' the twelves out 
 The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne 
 This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes 
 Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up 
 And went and took all the bitches of the athletes 
 Mikey Rocks: 
 Big up to what's been up, nigga 
 Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good 
 And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap 
 Hollerin', "Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app! " 
 Without fail, the best to ever do it just will 
 Haven't done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though 
 But it ain't no sweat, I got a whole outfit 
 And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet 
 (Check, check, check) And I'm beamin' 
 Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith 
 Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D 
 Now we NBA'd up from development leagues 
 Chuck English: 
 Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell 
 Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail 
 Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window 
 Of whatever 'Lac truck pick her up, retail 
 Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi 
 On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby 
 Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab 'em) 
 You want the truth? Well, the truth is 
 This is it, pointin' out the differences 
 This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn't it? 
 Lizard king loafers on swole when I'm kickin' it 
 Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole 
 You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold 
 Blu: 
 Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas' shoulder off 
 Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y'all's 
 Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all 
 Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God 
 Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw 
 Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on 
 So gone, strode strong through your lawn till the dawn 
 Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song 
 'Cause when you feel it, and it make yo' ass chill and calm 
 Payin' more than just attention for that glass I'm sippin' on 
 Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad 
 Kiddin', ma? Scratch backs, bringin' out them kitten paws 
 And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm 
 Back to attendin' business, do not lay them digits wrong 
 Dippin' all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John 
 This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period 
 Diggy Simmons: 
 I know what you're thinkin', thinkin' I do not belong 
 Tell me Diggy ain't beamin', 'course I should be on this song 
 Yeah, I'm a child of God, my reflection is on 
 Yeah, I'm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong 
 Didn't want me to shine, now we sharin' the stage 
 Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age 
 So the remains, and it ain't even how 
 That Verizon flow, are you hearin' me now? 
 Word to Wasalu, they was sayin' my future was dark 
 I had the fame, but my name was missin' the art 
 So I'm drawin' the line, and I'm crossin' the Ts 
 And I'm dottin' my Is, barely catchin' my Zs 
 But I'll be good by the mornin', on my global grind like JoJo 
 They be lookin' at what I'm puttin' on and, so fly, so fresh at the SoHo 
 Most niggas don't know though, they can catch me on the first flight 
 Been workin' on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe 
 But I did it for the love, no check, mate 
 Dosage: 
 When people said I couldn't, I wouldn't, I made 'em believers 
 I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers 
 From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin' we need you 
 To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil 
 Some people hate it, but I made it, so I'm never concerned 
 About what they be talkin' about, I've lived and I've learned 
 With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn 
 In this business, because I'm in control, meetin' adjourned 
 I said, "It's Third Degree, y'all heard of we? 
 I'm Dosage, have you heard of me? " 
 I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be 
 Where people say it doesn't matter to be much 
 I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up 
 That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up 
 If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!) 
 Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends 
 I just want to say I remember when 
 B.o.B: 
 Well, it's B to the O, O to the B 
 You know it's the flow, you know that it's me, I flow to this beat 
 As easy as goin' to the store and holdin' receipts 
 And foldin' 'em neat, I'm focused as focused can be 
 You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace 
 Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat 
 Speakin' of ferociously beat, you know that girl 'Nique? 
 You know she's a freak, but anyway, back to what I'm supposed to be 
 Sayin' all over this beat, you know that we Gs 
 You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings 
 Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah 
 And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam 
 It's the All City varsity, hard-headed squad 
 We played y'all spades, y'all handle y'all cards 
 But we ain't all odds, we just blaze, man 
 Y'all playin' checkers in this game, this is chess, y'all pawns
