Yes sir is Bobby Ray, aka A. B.O.B. (O) 
 I can't be eco conscious, I'm always burning trees 
 And is there fire, fire, call it that third degree, 
 And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya 
 Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency 
 The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah 
 Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you 
 They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up 
 But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas 
 And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me 
 That's not that serious, don't take it so personally 
 Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O. 
 C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo 
 I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload 
 And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal 
 I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal 
 Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, man 
 Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh 
 I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher 
 'Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir 
 Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors 
 And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over 
 Had the kind of... into her motor roller 
 This bout to get scary like the end of October 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I'm at the fryin pan, your shit is so cold 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold 
 So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes and it's snow globe when the temperature is below froze 
 I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league 
 My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep 
 If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink 
 If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink 
 I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see 
 I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be 
 I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me 
 But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry 
 So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority? 
 What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me? 
 Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie 
 Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious 
 Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius, 
 I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya, 
 So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang y'all out like portraits 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
 And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
 I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
