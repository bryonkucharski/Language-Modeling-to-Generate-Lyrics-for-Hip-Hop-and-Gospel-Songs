Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 And throw that back (throw that back) 
 Don't be scared, bitch throw back 
 This dick right here is cleaner than a hypochondriac 
 Po' that yack, po' that yack 
 This flow, you know that's crack 
 This beat, you know that track 
 I put my city on, you be on the map 
 Two hands when she on, like a scooter 
 She told me she wish she knew me sooner 
 If I hit her with' a new maneuver 
 What she gon' do? Scream hallelujah! 
 Her eyes rollin', she gone 
 She gettin' in her zone 
 And when she gimme dat look 
 Then I'm a do whatever I want 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 And throw that back, throw that back 
 Don't play bitch, throw that back 
 Don't play bitch, throw that back 
 Throw that back, throw that back 
 Ba-ba-ba throw that back 
 Throw that back, throw that back 
 Don't play girl, throw that back 
 Don't play with' it 
 I'm a lay in it 
 I'm a paint yo walls, I'm a spray in it 
 Never go licky licky with' my face in it 
 If it's country wood, then you takin' it 
 I said my chain so bright I'm a vacation in it 
 And you fake ass nigga ain't made of shit 
 I got a hundred fifty racks just to show up 
 You had to pay? Nigga I got paid to sit 
 I bet yo girl know me, a young nigga but I'm feelin' like a OG 
 Add a 'r' and a 'y', that's a orgy 
 I got her legs in the sky she gon' walk a bunch of life with no feet 
 She said her booty from the motherland 
 She started wobblin' and poppin' like a rubber band 
 I'm throwin' ten racks with my right 
 She told me grab her ass with' my other hand 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 I'm a pimp, did ya know that? 
 Bobby Ray finna throw that 
 And when I throw that, D I never hold back 
 Hoes lookin' for me like a Lo-Jack 
 'Ca-'Cause she wanna ride it like she stole it 
 That camel toe, I'm finna poke it 
 She got her best friend with' her and we playin' hokey-pokey 
 She jus' tryna focus on this wood in this pine 
 Bow down to the wood like a shrine 
 I be the 6, you be the 9 
 That's the only time you'll be less than a dime 
 Girl it's showin' time 
 Time to stretch, time to whine 
 I wanna see you wind 
 I wanna put it on your mind when I see you grind 
 Give life to the death, give site to the blind 
 I wanna hit it from the back like "Ah-ah-ah!" 
 Look 
 Go crazy to this, go crazy to this 
 Now I'm in the pipe cause you ain't fuckin' her right 
 A nigga lazy as shit 
 They go crazy to this, I could go crazy to this 
 Soon as that song drop, that thong drop 
 Just shake that! 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 Go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this 
 All my bitches get together, go crazy to this
