Well it was just a dream 
 Just a moment ago 
 I was up so high 
 Looking down at the sky 
 Don't let me fall 
 I was shooting for stars 
 On a Saturday night 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 'Cause I'm gliding up there oh so very high 
 That if the clouds were to drop me 
 Then I'd fall out the sky 
 I don't really know why I'm here 
 I guess I'm just here for the ride 
 I swear, it feels like I'm dreaming 
 It's vividly defined, yeah 
 So call me whatever you want 
 Tie me to whatever you like 
 But let's get one thing straight 
 You know my name, so I run this town 
 When I'm on this mic, yeah 
 So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray 
 I don't know, need I know 
 But I know, that I float 
 Rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes 
 Then I go, as my story goes 
 I don't mind, I've been down here before 
 Product of my East Decatur home 
 'Cause I was in the cold 
 Trying to keep my toes unfroze 
 Now I'm in your house 
 Now I'm in your stove 
 Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go 
 Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago 
 Well it was just a dream 
 Just a moment ago 
 I was up so high 
 Looking down at the sky 
 Don't let me fall 
 I was shooting for stars 
 On a Saturday night 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Yeah, by far much lower than where that pavement is 
 'Cause there ain't no parachute 
 That they can make for this 
 'Cause I put my pain, my heart 
 My soul, my faith in this 
 Does anyone feel like how I feel? 
 Then you can relate to this 
 I just blazed with this 
 Maybe roll one up then take a hit 
 Toast to the good life then take a sip 
 Vacay every day, yeah take a trip 
 It's easy to see I was made for this 
 From the womb all the way to the grave, I spit 
 Show y'all niggas what greatness is 
 Yeah, I'm talking very Lucy like making movies 
 To picture my life boy 
 You need a higher resolution 
 I used to cut class in day 
 Then runaway at night 
 But now I'm ruler of the upper class 
 I don't even write 
 Well it was just a dream 
 Just a moment ago 
 I was up so high 
 Looking down at the sky 
 Don't let me fall 
 I was shooting for stars 
 On a Saturday night 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 They say what goes up 
 Must come down 
 But don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall
