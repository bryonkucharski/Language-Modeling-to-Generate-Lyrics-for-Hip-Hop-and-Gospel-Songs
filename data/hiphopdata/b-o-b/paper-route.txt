You don't know who you fucking with 
 Ain't no democrat, and by far I'm no republican 
 This the type of talk that'll probably piss off my publicist 
 And I ain't even started, the water ain't even bubbling 
 The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law 
 Or make the government come after me in public 
 Won't hear this on the radio, this here ain't for publishing 
 This ain't that bubble gum shit, no, this ain't that double mint 
 Consider this a risk, I swear I see 'em building pyramids brick by brick 
 They'll aim at everyone going against this shit 
 You don't believe me? Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks 
 It's like nobody else complains 
 Till you tryna be more than a nigga with a chain 
 Cube already told you, they corrupted everything 
 And we these out here just tryna function, tryna maintain 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 Till then it's back to the paper route, the paper route 
 And of course it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans 
 Can we not afford them but got enough to get a Glock 40 
 Is our views on reality kinda distorted 
 But still, even though I understand the story 
 I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate 
 On the sexy short bitch, so what's the score? 
 Chilling with some red dogs, drinking white man's poison 
 Ah, now that's a forfeit 
 Selling what's for free for free, that's extortion 
 But still I'm wondering what family was present when history was recorded 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 Till then it's back to the paper route, the paper route 
 You think you really know what's going on? 
 They passing laws where they can run up in your own home 
 Cameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone 
 The battery don't come out, that means it's always on 
 Smile and say cheese, yeah niggas got you 
 I told you fuckers three years ago 'bout the watchers 
 If you won't take the microchip then you can't make no dollars 
 This ain't no lovely day for a neighbour, ain't no Mr Rodgers 
 Don't let these fuckers rob us for our freedom and your rights 
 And you be like: "it's on the news so it must be right" 
 Who's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice? 
 Who's calling the shots and who's starting the fight? 
 Think twice... 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed 
 A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground 
 Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound 
 I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud 
 Till then it's back to the paper route, the paper route
