(B.o.B) 
 If you asked me what's on my mind you probably won't believe it 
 'Cause if life was one big pool I'd be in the deep end 
 So I play my role and never ever speak it 
 Like a secret 
 And all the while you just just to figure me out 
 (Chorus - B.o.B) 
 But you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 (B.o.B) 
 Well ask me a question I tell you no lies 
 'Cause there's nothing to hide my souls in my eyes 
 And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind 
 The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom 
 People look and try to see a disguise 
 But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light 
 If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line 
 Then you understand in my mind 
 But you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 (Lupe Fiasco) 
 Uh, who else but Lu-else 
 You know I got two belts the black and the white one 
 I begin and I master 
 I see in my eye glasses 
 But they sayin' what I'm seeing through is false like Ross 
 I can hear him through the wall like walk 
 This way they tryin' to dissuade my thoughts 
 I'm a slave to myself and disobey my boss 
 It's all in disarray this parade I walk 
 They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss 
 Amidst disarray are different ways I talk 
 And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught 
 Like I cough without covering my mouth 
 I tip the scales like the King of the south 
 Forgot that I was fat I lost my way 
 But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought 
 And not wonders, the sky summers 
 So don't make me take off my stunners 
 Bobby Ray you know you got my numbers 
 And them there can't see us like hunters 
 But you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 La la la la la 
 Oh yeah 
 La la la la la 
 You can't see past my shades 
 La la la la la 
 You can't see past my shades 
 But you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 And you can't see past my shades 
 Past my shades 
 Past my shades
