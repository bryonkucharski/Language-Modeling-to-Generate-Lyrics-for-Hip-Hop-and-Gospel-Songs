(B.o.B (Young Thug):) 
 Feelin' xantastic 
 Weavin' through traffic (weave) 
 Girl, next to me nasty 
 Fine as all get out 
 I reckon she the baddest (bad) 
 She be too attached to me (attached) 
 Might pull out the Aston (Aston) 
 Make 'em all sit up (weave) 
 They say we too flashy (weave) 
 All designer fashion (weave) 
 We ain't never had shit (weave) 
 That's why we gotta put on (weave) 
 Diamonds on me spazzin' (weave) 
 Keepin' this passion (weave) 
 In case you was askin' (weave) 
 Get down for the get down 
 (Young Thug:) 
 Snortin' cocaine while you're yawning 
 Do everythin' under the sun (doin' everything) 
 Shootin' dice until the morning 
 Like a phone, if you not rock star, you boring (ring) 
 Piccadilly, wrists spilled me, Richard Mille 
 On they wish list, and they riches, really, really 
 Cocaine like a mob boss, taller than my ceiling 
 I can spark a world war, bring me back your kiddy 
 I can be your ring tone 
 I'm flyin' to the clouds, yeah 
 And no I ain't comin' down, yeah 
 My mama moved my round, yeah 
 Cloud 9, ninth round, yeah 
 Repeat my sound, yeah 
 Repeat my sound, yeah

 What, you don't want me to party? (What don't you want?) 
 What, you gon' want me to molly? 
 You want me stuck in apartment? 
 Family feud with Steve Harvey 
 C-I double A in Charlotte 
 They showin' ass and titties
