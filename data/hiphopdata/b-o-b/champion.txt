 (Intro] [Sportscaster talking) 
 Incredible! Incredible! Oh my God. Ladies and gentlemen, you have just witnessed world history being made. 
 Bobby Simmons, takes it to the hole, dunks it, overtime three seconds left, oh my God! Yeah! 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (okay) 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (did he just get serious in here?) 
 Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (I think it did) 
 Whenever I play 
 Now say. I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 (Verse One) 
 Okay Bob hit the stage now 
 Lights and cameras on 
 Yes I'm givin' them want they want 
 But no, I will not ever conform 
 'Cause I'm outside of the norm still 
 What a spectacular form 
 From the blood sweat and the tears shed 
 Every time I perform 
 And whenever your doin' your thang 
 Yep, people gonna hate on it usually (that's right) 
 But I'm just as human as you 
 I just look good while doin' it 
 And they telling me I have so much dope I won't know what to do with it 
 Well until then 
 I'm gonna continuin' maneuverin' 
 Because 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (What a spectacular athlete) 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (If I do say so myself) 
 Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (hahaha, seriously) 
 Whenever I play 
 I say. I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 (Verse Two) 
 I look in the mirror and laugh 
 Like look at what I've become 
 Everyone calls me Bob but I'm still my mother's son 
 And I'm low key when I'm out now, hell no, fame ain't fun 
 But I stay Live like NBA on yo' Playstation 
 And I entertain' 'cause I'm in the game 
 It's easy to see I ain't into fame 
 'Cause I ain't 
 And critics say that I imitate, but I really can't 
 Please allow me to demonstrate 
 But no matter what they say 
 I stay charged up like a triple A 
 Really maine? 
 Really maine 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (I wake up and piss excellence) 
 I am the champion (champion, champion) (All day) 
 Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (Please hold your applause) 
 Whenever I play (I'm kind of a big deal) 
 I say. I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion (I am the champion)
