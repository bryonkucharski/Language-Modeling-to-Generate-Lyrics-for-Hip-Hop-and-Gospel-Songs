Well as this cold world 
 Turns round and round 
 So much tragedy 
 Have I found 
 If I could take it away 
 I'd do that now 
 'Cause only in my dreams 
 Can I smile 
 So if I go to sleep 
 Don't wake me up 
 'Cause only in my dreams 
 Can I fly away! (x4) 
 Fly away 
 So god bless my soul 
 The pain I feel won't nobody know 
 'Cause this world is evil 
 And every time I wake up I wanna go home 
 So what am I to do 
 But sing a song for you 
 'Cause I feel you also 
 That's why I'll never let you go 
 They say I lost my mind 
 But I did that so long ago 
 So when I close my eyes 
 Leave me alone 
 So if I go to sleep 
 Don't wake me up 
 'Cause only in my dreams 
 Can I fly away (x4) 
 Fly away 
 Uh, somebody pray for me 
 I believe I can fly, ya, crazy me 
 But at night these angels be singing to me 
 Like lalalalalalalalala 
 So as I lay awake at night 
 I drift away into the sky 
 And that's where I reside 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 So pray that I'll be just fine 
 I see you when it's time 
 I'll see you when it's time
