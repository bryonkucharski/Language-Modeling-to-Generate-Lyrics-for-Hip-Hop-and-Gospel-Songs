(Hook: T.I.) 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 (Chorus: T.I.) 
 While these niggas run they mouth 
 I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now 
 I never will stand still 
 I still run this here 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 (Verse 1: T.I.) 
 It's the rap thespian, trap champion 
 Dude never lose even when you think he can't even win 
 Again, don't nobody do it like the kid do 
 Talkin' 'bout the greatest better throw him on the list too (who) 
 Way at the top even stopped dreamin' even in the offseason I'm steamin (hot) 
 Hurry up somebody better check our temperature 
 On the fire titan like the movie they remember us 
 Plus how can a nigga hate for real when resilience the only thing matchin' my brilliance 
 Hahaha lol niggas kill me 
 Look mama no guns and I'm still G 
 Whoda thought from baker rows center hill he get so much accomplished niggas plot to try to kill me 
 And keep it real we try yet and still we die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me 
 (Chorus: T.I.) 
 While these niggas run they mouth 
 I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now 
 I never will stand still 
 I still run this here 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 Yeah, sign yours sincerely 
 I been up on my game, really they just started listening 
 So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me 
 And if you're smellin' dro you know that I'm in the vicinity 
 Flawless with symmetry 
 Yeah, since elementary niggas bite the style like they tryna swap identities 
 Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory 
 Now I'm in the club with complimentary Hennessy 
 But this a jungle so you hear the snakes slitherin' 
 These niggas fake like a face with no blemishes 
 So I'm movin' with the force of an olympian 
 So cold with it you would think that I invented it 
 Yeah, I got a million ways to get it in 
 All day back and forth like tennis is 
 Another day at the office to handle business 
 From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is 
 (Chorus: T.I.) 
 While these niggas run they mouth 
 I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now 
 I never will stand still 
 I still run this here 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 (Verse 3: Spodee) 
 I heard the tip I won't and shame on they ass 
 Since the presence is a gift I won't refrain from the past 
 I'm a young stunner focused and ready to smash 
 Niggas on that sucka shit boy they really appeared sad 
 If my feet don't fail me I shall be crowned 
 But they never failed me before why would they fail now 
 I'm the one to call on look how they kept it down 
 Hopin they got the right number I hear the skeptical sounds 
 I made they ass I'm made to last 
 Niggas thinking that they on fire I blaze they ass (I mean it) 
 I'm hopin you see it comparing me to rappers is silly 
 Them boys stale packin up illys 
 And all my niggas packin the illy my fraction is gritty we large 
 The best kush the only reason I'm beggin' your pardon 
 Cats don't know how to act in the presence of don's 
 I'm just bein a playa while they bitches enjoyin' my charm 
 (Chorus: T.I.) 
 While these niggas run they mouth 
 I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now 
 I never will stand still 
 I still run this here 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now 
 I said feet don't fail me now
