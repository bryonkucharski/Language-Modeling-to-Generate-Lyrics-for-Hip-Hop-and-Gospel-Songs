You will be mine 
 Even if you're somebody else's 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 'Cause I'm your type 
 If you got the wrong impression 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow 
 Maybe at the club, maybe at the bar 
 I wanna show you off like a trophy car (whip it!) 
 Cause anything is better than nothing at all 
 Nothing at all, nothing on you 
 I just wanna show you a table for two 
 All you did was go on a date with a dude 
 You know him, he ain't tailored for you 
 You just on a n*gga dick 'cause he sold a brick 
 Has he ever wrote a hit or some poet shit 
 That's who you chillin' on the sofa with? 
 I ain't trippin' in a minute I'll be over wit, aye 
 You will be mine 
 Even if you're somebody else's 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 'Cause I'm your type 
 If you got the wrong impression 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 When they see us together 
 Hell no, they can't stand it 
 I wonder if you're matching your bras with them panties 
 A gorgeous skin tan 
 I hit the mall to do damage 
 They way she hit the high notes 
 We all gon' have Grammys 
 It's marble not granite 
 From the counter to the shower 
 For a hour super power, super power 
 That's that mojo, Austin Powers 
 Search real n*gga, I'mma pop up in your browser, aye 
 So go on get your body wet 
 Panties off 
 We ain't made it to the lobby yet 
 Put you on game girl so it's obvious 
 I give you the world if you ain't got it yet 
 You will be mine 
 Even if you're somebody else's 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 'Cause I'm your type 
 If you got the wrong impression 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 You might be with someone else 
 But I still see that you fiend a be with a G like me 
 You never need no one else 
 And I know, you know I 
 I'mma be like I told you so 
 You will be mine 
 Even if you're somebody else's 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 'Cause I'm your type 
 If you got the wrong impression 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 Girl not for long 
 But not for long 
 Girl not for long
