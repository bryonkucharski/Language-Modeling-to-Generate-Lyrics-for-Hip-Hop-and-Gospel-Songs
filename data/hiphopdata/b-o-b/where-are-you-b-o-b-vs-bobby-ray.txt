B.o.B 
 Whatever happened to Bobby Ray 
 He used to be here for us 
 Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust 
 We never hear from you 
 You're constantly changing 
 And your relatives always miss you 
 At family occasions 
 And your mother misses you too 
 Since all of the fortune 
 You've been too busy recording 
 Now she feels unimportant 
 And your daddy's been going through it 
 Since he lost his mother 
 The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him 
 I never thought you would sell out 
 You're becoming so cocky 
 I asked you for a picture after your show 
 You walked right by me, I'm like 
 Ain't this the dude that said it ain't about the price tag 
 Now on your records all that you do is brag 
 Bobby Ray 
 Come on Bob 
 I thought you were better than that dog 
 What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation lost 
 You were my Idol, just when I thought I give up on everything 
 I heard you play this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 I heard you play this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 Whatever happened to B.o.B 
 He once was my favourite 
 I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my player 
 He was the hood, but so different at the same time 
 It was like a breath of fresh air, every time he rhymed 
 And everybody was on him 
 And the world fell in love 
 The girls, The money, the lifestyle 
 All the above 
 I guess he stopped giving a fuck 
 For all of us little people 
 With your shades on, we can't even see you 
 Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping 
 They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic 
 Where's the integrity? You on that other shit 
 You don't even sound the same, I liked your other shit 
 But we'll stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you 
 There's more than what meets the eye 
 I swear on the Bible you were my idol 
 Just when I thought I give up on everything 
 I heard you play this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 I heard you play this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 I watched my whole life change in a couple of years 
 Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears 
 I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured 
 But if it wasn't meant to be this wouldn't be my career 
 It's like, people only see it, the way it appears 
 But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears 
 Blood sweat and tears, we cry but always swear there's tears 
 In the middle of this rap game on the battlefield 
 All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me 
 You never know who's gonna play you 
 And make you look phoney 
 I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies 
 We put it all on the line, 
 We gave up all our belongings for this rap shit 
 Cause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit 
 I call it making a way for survival 
 Just when I thought I give up on everything 
 I dreamed about this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 I dreamed about this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 (Melody, melody, melody) 
 I dreamed about this familiar melody 
 (Melody, melody, melody)
