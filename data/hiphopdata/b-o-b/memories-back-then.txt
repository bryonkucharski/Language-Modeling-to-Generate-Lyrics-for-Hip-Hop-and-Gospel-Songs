Ay, in my apartment a long time ago 
 I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow 
 Still gave it up when it's a few of us 
 She let me finger fuck her on the school bus 
 We used to cut school with her and run train 
 She want to hang with us, we want one thing 
 Just penetrating that throat dog 
 She choke on it like Smoke Dog 
 But whenever I fucked up my re-up 
 In a dice game I go see her 
 She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce 
 And then blow a blunt of that reefa' 
 She used to buy a nigga new sneakers 
 Pay the bill on my beeper 
 Just so she can pay to put a "69" 
 And I know what time to go freak her 
 Then one day I just asked her 
 "Why you always give your ass up? 
 I mean damn these hoes get paid 
 All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up." 
 She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love 
 Even if I know it ain't real love 
 Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it 
 Then never call back, I still fuck" 
 And that's fucked up, she's so trill 
 I need somethin', she go steal 
 When the trap hot and police ride 
 Nigga, guess where we go chill? 
 For 'bout four years she held dope 
 And my four pounds till it goes down 
 I remember shawty, she stayed down 
 I won't say her name because she married now 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 She would always turn heads when she'd fall through 
 She would always make moves how a boss do 
 And she never gave any nigga time of day 
 But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to 
 But when it came to me, she had a thing for me 
 When we kick it she roll up the weed for me 
 And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady 
 Watching just to see if the police coming 
 We got close over time, her and I 
 Right around the time that I first got signed 
 Come to think about it I was 'bout 17 
 I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive 
 I was going back and forth with these flights 
 Another show after show, each night 
 She became so suspicious of these other bitches 
 She'd go through my phone and we'd fight 
 Talk about torn between the two 
 Wasn't really much more that we could do 
 Wasn't really much space for us 
 But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do 
 But I guess one night I had a few 
 Huh, one night I had a few 
 Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye 
 I told her "hurry up, meet me at the room" 
 And no, I didn't have a contraceptive 
 And my common sense neglected 
 And two months later next thing I know 
 I got a text that said "I'm pregnant" 
 And you can almost bet she kept it 
 That's the reason why you left me 
 On top of all that, it wasn't even mine 
 I went and got paternity tested, damn! 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Wait, hold up, is that you? 
 With them big ol' thighs after school? 
 Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five 
 When I said I'm in hot pursuit 
 You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive 
 A new Monte Carlo that cruise 
 And that shot my pride, I tried to improv' 
 But no freestyle I never do 
 You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti 
 You overlooking every nigga that ain't quite ready 
 To make it rain on you like about to break a levee 
 Hold up, that pussy petty 
 Yeah, your nails did, your hair did 
 Your cell phone is selfish 
 It only got numbers that come with a Hummer 
 Her new prima donna I smelt it 
 Tried to make you mine, ho! 
 Tried to make some time, ho! 
 But I ain't got the time or the patience 
 To stop and wait in line, ho! 
 Her dreams holds Versace 
 She fall for Armani 
 Only deal with rich niggas 
 Fuck you and Mitt Romney 
 I'm grown now I'm on my own now 
 I'm po'ppin' 
 Change my phone now 
 When I get home now 
 I got o'ptions 
 Fast forward, wait is that you? 
 With them big old thighs after school? 
 And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies 
 And car note that's overdue? I know 
 When the lights go out and I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the madness in my head oh 
 All of the things that I did back then 
 Oh when I'm in my bed 
 I think of all the memories I've had oh 
 All of the things that I did back then
