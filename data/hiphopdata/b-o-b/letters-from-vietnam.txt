(Verse One) 
 Goodbye my love 
 The country is in need of me 
 And I heard there were signs for war 
 So I'm going overseas 
 So don't cry my love 
 The skies above will cry for you 
 And I'll be safe so hopefully 
 I'll come back home for you 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So please 
 Tell me it's not true 
 After all the love I've given 
 You found someone new 
 And oh, of all the things I've seen 
 This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy 
 Oh you, you let it all slip away 
 But soon you'll find 
 Soon you'll find (yeah) 
 What you can't replace 
 (Female Talking) 
 I gave away my love 
 That I promised you I would keep 
 A thousand deaths I died that day 
 When two became one 
 A greater force pulled you away 
 So I got on my knees and begged 
 The silence replaced my tears 
 So goodbye, my love 
 August 1,1965 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 So please 
 Tell me it's not true 
 After all the love I've given 
 You found someone new 
 And oh, of all the things I've seen 
 This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy 
 Oh you, you let it all slip away 
 But soon you'll find 
 Soon you'll find, yeah 
 What you can't replace 
 Yeah 
 (Verse Two) 
 Goodbye my love 
 As I bid farewell to thee 
 All is fair in love and war 
 So I'm going overseas
