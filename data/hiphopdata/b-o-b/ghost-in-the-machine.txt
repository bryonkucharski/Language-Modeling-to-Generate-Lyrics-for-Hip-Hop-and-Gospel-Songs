Tell me where am I supposed to go 
 And who am I supposed to believe? 
 If only you knew what I knew. 
 Then you could see just what I see. 
 So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
 'Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
 And I try to hide, but I just can't hide no more. 
 There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. 
 You say I look fine, if only you knew what's on my mind. 
 You'd see a whole different sign, I couldn't show you even if I tried. 
 I must have got lost in time when I found out I was only free to be, wherever I want to be. 
 Some say I'm out of sight, how I run and that we're all so blind. 
 If you could open up your eyes, you could see what I couldn't describe. 
 And then, you'd see the signs, and then your soul would be set free, and then you'd be released. 
 So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
 'Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
 And I try to hide, but I just can't hide no more. 
 There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. 
 Tell me where am I supposed to go. 
 And who am I supposed to believe. 
 If only you knew what I knew. 
 Then you could see. (Hey) 
 So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
 'Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
 And I try to hide, but I just can't hide no more. 
 There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. 
 And I'm terrified, like I've seen a UFO. 
 'Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
 And I try to hide, but I just can't hide no more. 
 There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. 
 (I go) 
 (A UFO) 
 (And I'm so tired of hiding, I've been running, I've been trying, to get away, to get away) 
 So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
 'Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
 And I try to hide, but I just can't hide no more. 
 There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
