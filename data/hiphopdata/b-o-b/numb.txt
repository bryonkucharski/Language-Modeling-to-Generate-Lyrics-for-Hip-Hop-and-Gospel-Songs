Gold all on my neck 
 Bathing ape on my back 
 Even though I'm looking from the front 
 I can still see that back 
 I got racks on racks 
 No I'm not white 
 See I'm hifey like keep the sneak 
 Please don't creep by me, don't try me 
 I be on freak, geeked off that brain I receive 
 All this fly shit, I bought came with receipts 
 This ain't no game, don't be playin' with me 
 All these bad bitches be stayin' with me 
 Beat the beat up like I'm Roy in that ring 
 Enough of me rapping, gon' let that boy sang 
 I had one, two, three too many 
 I'm fucked up, four chicks with me 
 I'm loud, took about five shots 
 Six bottles I just copped 
 Twisted, turnt up, twenty four 
 That's more bad bitches I'm getting 
 They know I hit 'em and quit em 
 And go past what they came here for 
 Baby can I see you make yo ass drop? 
 I'mma let the Rose bottles pop 
 I'mma sip this Roc, baby don't stop 
 'Cause yo body on fire, you too hot 
 I can't feel my face 
 I'm so numb 
 I'm so wasted 
 So dumb 
 I'm shit faced it 
 Just in case I don't make it 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home 
 That little red bone said she's taking me home 
 Fine ass friend said she coming along 
 Love in the morning, so I'm fuckin' 'em strong 
 I'mma beat 'em to sleep then I'm gone in the morning 
 Hold up! I tell a bitch roll up 
 Before I gotta roll out all I do is turn up 
 Turn down fuck what, need another drink 
 Baby go and pour up, money hungover 
 So you know I gotta throw up the fetti 
 So that they know that I'm ready 
 To get 'em poppin' and droppin' the party never be stopping 
 'Cause I be keeping 'em rocking, you all these bitches be choosin' 
 'Cause now they see that I'm winning like I'm allergic to losing and I 
 I can't feel my face 
 I'm so numb 
 I'm so wasted 
 I'm shit faced it 
 Just in case I don't make it 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home 
 Ro-Rolex shinin' call it perfect timing 
 Many is fresh, my baby's big timin' 
 Like a giant clock, club taking big shots 
 Like a giant Glock, bitch got high then she made her booty drop 
 While I'm watchin' like the cops 
 Do the niggas in the hood 
 Smell it fore I light it 
 So you know my weed good 
 Fly like a pilot from the same time it should 
 Concealing big D, she gon take it like a crook 
 Just make one thing understood 
 You nothing without paper like books 
 Word to my nigga double A, everybody's under may 
 Make bitches come, ada andale 
 When I'm digging in that skeezer, no soda, that squeezer 
 I'm cakin' no pam, bro's growin' up with Caesar 
 Crazy ass peep make these bitches go beezer 
 All my niggas makin' reserve, drop 
 I can't feel my face 
 I'm so numb 
 I'm so wasted 
 So dumb 
 I'm shit faced it 
 Just in case I don't make it 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home 
 Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin' 
 Take my trees, nigga I'm gone 
 Take my keys, nigga it's nothing 
 One of these chicks is taking me home
