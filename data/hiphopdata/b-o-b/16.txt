"She was only sixteen, only sixteen 
 I loved her so 
 But she was too young, to fall in love 
 And I was too young to know" - Sam Cooke '(She Was) Only Sixteen' 
 [Verse One]: 
 Well it started out in the club Jut 
 When I ordered a couple of Buds, yeah 
 And I broke up a couple of buds, yeah 
 And I rolled up a couple of Dutches, yeah 
 This thing turned into that, so, I 
 Ended up takin' her back home 
 And I ended up bendin' that girl back so 
 When I woke up I took that girl back home 
 But when I took her back to the crib, crib 
 She left her wallet in my whip, whip 
 So I opened it up, looked at her face, then looked in the sky like, "Shit, shit" 
 Then I thought to myself, "Is this her weight? And she born in '92?" 
 Then that must mean that I was too young to realize that I was a fool (damn) 
 She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah) 
 I loved her so (I loved her so) 
 But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love) 
 And I was too young to know (yeah) 
 [Sam Cooke sample][x2]: 
 She was only sixteen 
 I loved her so 
 I was too young to know 
 She was only sixteen 
 She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah) 
 I loved her so (I loved her so) 
 But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love) 
 And I was too young to know (yeah)
