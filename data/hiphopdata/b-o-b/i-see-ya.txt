I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya (I see ya) 
 (Verse One) 
 Yeah 
 It's B-O-B-O 
 No I don't need no lingo 
 'Cause I'm on this mic I chicka-pow-pow chicka-pow-pow to the beat though 
 Yeah shoot it up like a free throw 
 Where? 
 From the west to the east coast 
 Like Neo in a pea coat 
 Motherfuck like Danny DeVito 
 Lemme get a second just to reload 
 'Cause I'm cool in the pocket like Debo (yes!) 
 Cooler than the cheetahs on the Cheetos 
 Don't think that I lost my touch by much 
 I just been chillin' at the bank like aye! 
 Show me to the safe 
 Had to get my papers straight 
 Now I'm okay 
 Now it's back to the lab, yes back to the bank 
 Six 
 So don't think that I ain't sick 
 That I'm in places you can't get 
 When you're inside of the matrix 
 High is my vibration 
 High as levitation 
 High like every race in 
 In this generation 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya (I see ya) 
 (Verse Two) 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up 
 It's Bobby Ray 
 I mean my name B.o.B 
 When I'm on this mic I melt that fire 
 That's my job 
 I am a bomb 
 Try if ya want 
 Tick me off and I'm like lit up 
 So I wouldn't do that 
 I'd would sit back 
 Unless you got tricks, inside of a hat 
 Then I would eat 
 Still wouldn't defeat 
 The fact that I'm insane, yes literally 
 I spit on the beat 
 I shit on the beat 
 Then I wipe with an MC 
 Throw them in the trash 
 B.o.B stop 
 Wait a minute maybe just switch up the flow 
 I was on a whole different level but now I'm ready to level 
 With a hellfire venomous flow 
 Here's the thing 
 Clearly 
 I'm in a place you can't really be 
 I'm in a space 
 Called a zone 
 And when you inside you just kinda know 
 And you don't stop 
 Cause you just float 
 And if you will then I know you don't 
 And if you not then you go for broke 
 But this a jungle let me go for those 
 I see ya 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah (I see ya) 
 I see ya (I see ya) 
 (Scratching) 
 I spit on the beat, I shit on the beat, then I wipe with an MC
