I want everything I see 
 I wanna go in every mall in every state in every country and buy shit 
 Whether I can afford it or not, nigga 
 I want bitches, I want cars, I don't give a fuck, I want it all 
 That's what the fuck we're here for 
 Say enough about a dream nigga 
 I'm just tryna keep it real nigga 
 It's just so many woman 
 It's just so many chains 
 It's just so many watches 
 It's just too many things 
 I want! 
 It's just so many trips 
 It's just so many bottles 
 It's just too many whips 
 It's just too many models 
 I want! 
 All I want is money 
 Money, money, money 
 That's all I want 
 Big face hundred 
 Hundred, hundred, hundred 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 Not a day's goes by 
 It ain't on my mind 
 I ain't gon frunt 
 I ain't gon lie 
 I'd rather have an em 
 Than an empty pocket 
 If hundreds ain't in them 
 Them jeans ain't mine, I 
 I swear I won muthafucka 
 I'll never be a bum muthafucka 
 You talking about like it ain't about the money 
 You just sound like a dumb muthafucka 
 A house on the hill by the lake 
 All real niggas can relate 
 You tryna book me for free? 
 But my rent is due on today 
 A Better life is what we're after 
 Because every dream I gotta capture 
 I always knew that I would blow up one day 
 Like a nuclear reactor 
 All I want is money 
 Money, money, money 
 That's all I want 
 Big face hundred 
 Hundred, hundred, hundred 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 From the cradle to a label 
 From decatur to the majors to papers, no more neighbors 
 I used to say I never cared about the money until I put food on my momma's table 
 Follow the trail 
 Could've been in jail 
 The way that I live 
 Could have been fatal 
 Must have had an angel 
 It's funny how I'm always on the screen 
 But as a teen I never had cable 
 But now I won it all 
 The world, the ladies, the whips 
 I took a fantasy and made it exist 
 No one ever handed a shit 
 We took what we had and made it this shit 
 That's just from the dust to the luxury 
 Being off in the cut, the cutlery 
 That's the gist, that's the summary 
 So if you feel how I'm feeling then fuck with me! 
 All I want is money 
 Money, money, money 
 That's all I want 
 Big face hundred 
 Hundred, hundred, hundred 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 That's all I want, that's all I want 
 Say enough about a dream nigga 
 I'm just tryna keep it real nigga
