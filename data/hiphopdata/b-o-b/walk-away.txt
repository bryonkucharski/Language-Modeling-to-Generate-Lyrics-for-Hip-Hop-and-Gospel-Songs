I don't know why she's with me 
 I only brought her trouble since the day she met me 
 If I was her, by now I would have left me 
 I would have walked away 
 But now I've broken away 
 Somehow instead she forgave me 
 She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do 
 Even if it means she denied herself the truth 
 'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late, 
 You've fallen in love in the worst way 
 And if you don't go now then you'll stay 
 'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe 
 'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 But still she stays 
 She's standing in the heart of darkness 
 Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless 
 How could any woman in their right mind be so blind, 
 To find something this safe 
 Instead of walking with me she should have walked away 
 She finds color in the darkest places 
 She finds beauty in the saddest of faces 
 For such a groovy and headstrong city girl 
 Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way 
 And if you don't go now then you'll stay 
 'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe 
 'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 But still she stays 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 But still she stays 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 I don't know why she's with me 
 I only brought her trouble since the day she met me 
 If I was her, by now I would have left me 
 I would have walked away 
 But you've fallen in love in the worst way 
 And if you don't go now then you'll stay 
 'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe 
 'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 So walk away 
 (Walk away) 
 Walk away, oh 
 Save yourself from the heartache, oh 
 Go now before it's too late 
 But still she stays 
 (Yeah) 
 But still she stays, eh 
 I'm saying walk away 
 Yeah 
 I'm saying walk away 
 (Save yourself from the heartache, go now before it's too late) 
 But still she stays 
 Still she stays 
 Yeah, she stays 
 She stays
