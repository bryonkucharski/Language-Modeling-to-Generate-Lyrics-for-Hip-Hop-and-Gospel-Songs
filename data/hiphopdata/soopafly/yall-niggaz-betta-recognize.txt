 Spit you like Harold Nevitt from the Blue Notes 
 Smokin' on my blunts and my Newports

 Watch yo' ass

 Mission crush I'm first opponents'll stay plush 
 Get rushed quick when I inject illegal substance 
 What's this, off brand nigga you get chopped up 
 Tossed and turned, nigga burn you learn 
 That these suckers is get'n wound up like ultra perm 
 Spine crack through yo back now that's yo concern 
 Wit that 9 in my pocket and at least a Grand 
 You can't break territory, you can't stop the man 
 And order cup, beware the bite last shark it's the 
 Chef cookin' up yo death match pipe this up 
 Heavyweighted, keep baited, so you bite this up 
 Sockin nigga till he did it right tight this much game 
 Exchange leave 'em all ashamed 
 Who can stop the pain 
 Who can stop the reign 
 Fuck a mundane, you look around it's Da Pound 
 What ya found hundred of bodies all over the ground 
 From the touch, I squeezed it bring it into a clutch 
 Yo mouth shut, slap through a tension

 No class, you get suspicion 
 C-clap, tightin' that tension and not to mention
