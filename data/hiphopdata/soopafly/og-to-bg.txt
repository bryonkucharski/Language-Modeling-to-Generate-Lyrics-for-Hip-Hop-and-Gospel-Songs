 Alize 
 Hold on Nigga 
 No more gangsta shit 
 Nigga you know that gangsta shit put you on the map 
 So if you ain't gonna turn into somethin' new, 
 We gonna have to rewind the track 
 To way back 
 I was walkin' through the park one day 
 Puffin' on a bomb ass J (Come here with that weed Snoop) 
 See my Nigga suited blue-grey 
 This is what a Nigga had to say 
 Ohuuuuuuuh 
 (Soopafly) 
 I was about 16 years old 
 Runnin' the streets of Long Beach 
 Nigga, straight fuckin' up 
 Every party that I went to 
 I had to stuck a frame [Daz:] (Motherfucker) 
 For my name is Soopa, 
 What the fuck you say 
 I think he saw the handle on my .44 
 When he get seated, 
 22 I was reachin' fo' 
 I show you how you do when shit blow up 
 1, 2, 3 it's that 
 Your party over Nigga 
 Move on to the next one 
 You should've brought a few mo' Niggas, 
 For some protection 
 You fuckin' with notorious ass G's 
 You never get passed these 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 think is that we straight dumpin' 
 That's why I'm always into somethin' 
 I faded, faded till that Nigga broke 
 To show that I ain't no motherfuckin' joke 
 ? Somethin' thought he could check me 
 But the guard sent his ass directly 
 Yo, to his G-R-A-V-E 
 Bein' stupid try to P-L-A-Y me 
 Yo, listen well to me, 
 Spell it to the underground 
 Nobody playin' pussy 
 So I'm layin' it down 
 A little somethin' from the motherfuckin' DPG 
 Soopafly from O.G. 2 B.G. 
 (Snoop Sample) 
 A G is a overseer 
 A overseer sees 
 (Soopafly) 
 From O.G. 2 B.G. 
 (Kurupt Tha Kingpin) 
 The motherfuckin' game took a lot again 
 Aw shit, the streets is hot again 
 Protection down in 2 months 
 Rolled up with the homie Swoop a couple sluts 
 Let me call the homie now, Nigga 
 Phonecheck punk 
 I poke Niggas down 
 When I'm in the yard, the bar 
 The Niggas just angin' (Daz: Dogg Pound) 
 Pop when I get out I'm back bangin' 
 Rollin', I can't be helt no motherfuckin' mo' (Right) 
 As soon as I get out the motherfuckin' do' (Right) 
 Chevrolet, straight sittin' on low ? (Right) 
 Now it's on till it's on till the brake of dawn 
 Fuckin' with notorious ass G's 
 Nigga, punk, bitch please 
 >From gettin' quoted on the hood till packin' 
 Murders, slangin' and jackin' 
 I rather fuck you bitch 
 Now go tell your Nigga you made the right switch 
 My lesson is my ho, respect me 
 K-U-R-U-P-T from O.G. 2 B.G. 
 (Kurupt) 
 Daz Dilli is the gangsta, gangsta 
 Tell us about the days of way back 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Slangin' cars, hangin' hard 
 Upon the boulevard 
 Gettin' stars as a young Nigga behind bars 
 My willy's dead, I fuck you fresh out the gate 
 I can't wait, demonstrate 
 Thought I was gone for all my old weight 
 Now I'm back with a Tec-9 and a Strap 
 And with that in my hart Nigga, 
 You know ain't no turnin' back 
 Called up Kurupt and Dr. Dre to load up the AK 
 Let's put some work on these Niggas, 
 To let them know we don't play 
 Blew, Blew we scared around the corner 
 Creep on 'em, make a mil 
 To makin' all y'all goners 
 Ain't a rap from my shelf 
 It was no good times shit 
 A little Nigga puttin' dick 
 Niggas on their chest 
 All with a nitty 14 
 Was all what it seems 
 In cape of horrible dreams 
 Trapped, with a helluva machine 
 Quick to pistol till you tipple 
 Let you know, plan it simple 
 How back in my? 
 Bullets flyin' like missiles 
 So what's on and on 
 And as the way it should be 
 Motherfucker from O.G. 2 B.G. 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Yeah, 1999
