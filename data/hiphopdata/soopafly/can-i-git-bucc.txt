 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Yes, yes y'all, yes yes y'all, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all 
 Yes yes y'all, yes yes y'all, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all 
 We got some people on the microphone here tonight 
 They coming to give you to you rough, rugged, and raw 
 You know that westcoast feel, yeah (All that shit) 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Watch out its creep to, what the fuck can he do 
 Showing for showy death gun come with you 
 Fuck a posse homeboy, I run with a gang 
 Blasting niggaz for anything, looking sneaky, looking strange 
 Me and my couples from the pass kick gas 
 Smoke a pound of grass every doubt about cash 
 Glocks, ski mask, we bo on a match 
 Clush crash so don't even try to ask 
 I'm rough, roughed, and raw, and what you see you just saw 
 What happen when dat nigga daz, on the mic grab it 
 I take control and move you body and soul 
 One ho, I move the crowd with an flow 
 (Chorus x2: Daz Dillinger) 
 Can I get bucc, Can I get bucc 
 To all my homies and my ridaz who don't give a fuck 
 Who acting to tough, and acting to rough 
 Come around here nigga, get bucc 
 (Soopafly) 
 You mother fuckers in action 
 We blast niggaz for asking the ghetto fab satisfication 
 Barrel directed to bone marrow, hit cha 
 In traded to get cha, damage yo completed vanish that you can't mannish 
 It's the gangsta and pimps with heated clips 
 You can't hide during the day, we like Gladis Knight like plips 
 Mashing these niggaz for chips 
 If you wanna ride dip, like to fools in rip should 
 Throw up your hood, it's all good 
 Nigga what, gangsta anemic stripe 
 Super posting, with a thirty-eight heater with my hosting 
 Blasting who ever stop from rocking coast to coasting 
 I burn and roasting a nigga who figure that 
 When you pull out a strap we ain't right, where my gangstas at (Right Here) 
 Show up to blow up your block 
 Out for the cream like the crock 
 I tell these niggaz don't stop 
 (Chorus x2: Daz Dillinger and Soopafly) 
 Can I get bucc, Can I get bucc 
 To all my mother fucking ridaz who don't give a fuck 
 Who acting to tough, and acting to rough 
 Come around here nigga, get bucc 
 (Crooked I) 
 To all of my niggaz that couldn't crack britches 
 Staking riches, dipping something ficous 
 Tapping switches, macking and cracking bitches 
 This rapping business is phony as hell 
 I'm going to ride until they throw me an L 
 Like all my homies in jail 
 I'm gun cocking, con cock the shot the block, so I can clock a knot 
 Hit the spot with my trunk knocking 
 Drop tops is the what pops the pussies 
 Bury more arms than octopuses 
 Gages and blocks and bushes 
 Ready to start the conflict 
 You want chronic, I'm all for atomic, energy 
 Literally, thinking of the bomb shit 
 Mob wit me, don't mash alone 
 A chaperone, hoes who love to blow on bones like a saxophone 
 When niggaz think they Al Kapone 
 It only takes three steps, draw, squeeze, shoot, you gone 
 Who am I crooked i, who are they daz and soopafly 
 On the rooper high, stay true to my click 
 (Chorus x2: Daz Dillinger) 
 Can I get bucc, Can I get bucc 
 To all my mother fucking ridaz who don't give a fuck 
 Who acting to tough, and acting to rough 
 Come around here nigga, get bucc
