I see the sickness in the signs 
 The dead weight in line 
 Like the sickness in my mind 
 Homosexuals and liars 
 Fuck playing for reasons 
 Fuck playing for Jesus 
 Let me shine like a god, like a leader 
 I'll burn a hole through your cross 
 My souls already lost 
 And it's funny 'cause they're saying 'He's hott.' 
 But they don't see the fucking tears that I've cried 
 And they don't hear me when I scream when I die 
 I wanna live good, I wanna live right 
 My insecurities are eatin' me alive 
 I need a friend, someone close to my heart 
 That'll help me through my struggles 
 You can help me through my times 
 I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together 
 Weak or strong, not just a song 
 We sing along when things go wrong 
 You will need me when you fall 
 And I will need you when I'm wrong 
 Tears lead me on 
 They let me lead you so far 
 Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm 
 I already found the devil, he's my best friend 
 He taught me how to leave, but I don't wanna end 
 I want a pill for every bad thought 
 For every chick I fucked 
 For every time I lost 
 Don't think I'm broken, 'cause I'm not 
 Got milk? Got problems? 
 Problems is all that I got 
 You're looking down on a barrel of a bent pole 
 Take my hand, I promise that I'll go slow 
 When you looked too close you end up with a broke soul 
 'Cause in the end it's certain where all the souls go 
 Maybe you can show me how to live right 
 And come see how it all ends wrong 
 I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together 
 Weak or strong, not just a song 
 We sing along when things go wrong 
 You will need me when you fall 
 And I will need you when I'm wrong 
 Tears lead me on 
 They let me lead you so far 
 Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm 
 I'll take you to a place so warm 
 Like the insides of a baby unborn 
 The bible keeps telling me 'Don't go!' 
 They don't know what I know, what? 
 You won't reap what I sew, what? 
 You won't cease when I blow, yup! 
 I won't leave when you go, nope! 
 Come with me, let us go home 
 I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together 
 Weak or strong, not just a song 
 We sing along when things go wrong 
 You will need me when you fall 
 And I will need you when I'm wrong 
 Tears lead me on 
 They let me lead you so far 
 Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm
