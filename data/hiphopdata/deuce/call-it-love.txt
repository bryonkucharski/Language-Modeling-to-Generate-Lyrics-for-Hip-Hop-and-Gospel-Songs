You can say what you want 
 You've got it all wrong 
 You go on and on and on 
 I really don't mind 
 Cruel to be kind, someone like you so hard to find 
 The look on your face, full of disgrace 
 You've got to stop acting like a child 
 You surely must know your thoughts are on show 
 There's really no way its just too wild 
 Call It Love if you want 
 I can see does it have to be here and now 
 If you want can't you see 
 Why is it always here and now? 
 You can think what you like 
 It's the same every night 
 You go on and on and on 
 I really don't mind, cruel to be kind, 
 Someone like you so hard to find 
 The look on your face, full of disgrace 
 You've got to stop acting like a child 
 You surely must know your thoughts are on show 
 There's really no way its just too wild 
 Call It Love if you want 
 I can see does it have to be here and now? 
 If you want can't you see 
 Why is it always here and now?
