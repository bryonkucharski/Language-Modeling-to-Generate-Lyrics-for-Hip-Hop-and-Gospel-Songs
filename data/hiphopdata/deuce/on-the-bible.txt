Oh oh oh yeah 
 Because I need you there 
 I will swear on the bible 
 (I will swear) On the bible 
 I will swear on the bible 
 From the day I saw you 
 I just had to be with you 
 Only you, and only with you 
 From the moment you said yes 
 It was you and nothing less 
 Kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss 
 Oh oh oh yeah 
 On the bible I will swear 
 Swear to love you 
 And I will hope, cherish and obey 
 Because I need you there 
 I will swear on the bible 
 (I will swear) On the bible (I need you there) 
 I will swear on the bible 
 From the moment I saw you 
 I just knew that it was you 
 Only you, it had to be you 
 From the moment you said yes 
 It was you and nothing less 
 Kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss 
 Oh oh oh yeah 
 On the bible I will swear 
 Swear to love you 
 And I will hope, cherish and obey 
 Because I need you there 
 I will swear on the bible 
 (I will swear) On the bible (I need you there) 
 I will swear on the bible 
 I can make this promise 
 If I was really honest 
 I'd rather live for today 
 Come on girl, lets runaway 
 If you read my mind 
 I am your temptation 
 It's soft and sweet for you to be temptation 
 Throw caution to the wind 
 Lets dance, lets sing
