Comstock cell block shit, cops are minimal 
 Rock your snot box top notch, watch for sentinels 
 Hide like Sasquatch squat, the revenue drop 
 Pull out Glocks hot spot, pop your genitals - Pharoahe 
 Generally a general for generations of jams generated for criminals 
 Retractable claws cut country club cardigans 
 Both parties party with me, bipartisan 
 Kick start a starter kit, pull out dick on a charlatan 
 In Harlem when you're romancing these hoes like Harlequin 
 Listen, my cock'll leave 'em in a coma 
 But the Glock'll leave you messy like you play for Barcelona 
 You are now working with a renowned 
 Master with mastery over conjugated verbs and nouns 
 Yo, you are now working with a renowned 
 Master with mastery over conjugated verbs and nouns 
 Go! 
 Civilian sings, I drink, I lean 
 I see dead people when I dream 
 This war with self is so extreme 
 Sometimes I think I need to - scream 
 This war with self is so extreme 
 Sometimes I think I need to 
 Scream, scream, scream 
 Press your luck, fuck a press kit, press can't harm me 
 But chest presses a deadlift, bench press zombies 
 Hysteria rap burn the flag, fuck America 
 Start the revolution, poison the water with malaria 
 Fuck it, I came back from the war of scorn 
 Like Uncle Ruckus throwing bananas on the White House lawn 
 Cryptic anarchists spit that apocalyptic dark shit 
 Communists, radicals, racism, Marxist 
 You couldn't possibly wanna lock horns 
 Spit holy water on your throne wearing a crown made of thorns 
 *Ouy Kcuf!* - just thought I should say that 
 Every rhyme is like a time bomb strapped beneath your Maybach 
 Cop the range, stop the strange, lock the game, rock the chain 
 Stop the train, smoke a fag, pop your brain 
 Unless you can inject me in your arm like a narcotic and squeeze 
 Please never say my name in vain, let's go 
 Civilian sings, I drink, I lean 
 I see dead people when I dream 
 This war with self is so extreme 
 Sometimes I think I need to - scream 
 This war with self is so extreme 
 Sometimes I think I need to 
 Scream, scream, scream
