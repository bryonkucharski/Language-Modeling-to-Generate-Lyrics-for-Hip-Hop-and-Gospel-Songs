Totally intoxicated when he drove across the state line 
 Rapper gone insane, story on Dateline 
 Lost his wits, didn't take his meds 
 When they pulled him over, this is what he said 
 I'm a Bad MotherFucker man (shut your mouth) 
 Well we talking about Pharoahe 
 Mashing in that Aston Martin on the Verrazano Narrows 
 Greatest of all time in the latest apparel 
 80's baby, ladies crave me on some Mercedes shit 
 Go tell your favorite rapper eat a bag of baby dicks 
 They keep singing the same ol' song 
 I'm a bring 'em the pain for saying the name wrong 
 Got me going insane I'ma ask you again 
 Who put these pussies on top 
 Putting out that pussy music, call it pussy pop 
 Playing them pussy games, sucker shit 
 Fucking around but they don't know just who they fucking wit 
 (x2) 
 I'm a Bad Motherfucker man 
 Universal, worldwide, you know my circle 
 Renegade, on the mic I might just murk you 
 Putting in that work, 'cause I do work, every verse is a virtue 
 The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars 
 The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired 
 When the truth walked in the building every liar retired 
 Deception was defeated and deceit became deleted 
 Uh, they mad 'cause they can't stop me 
 'Cause I said fuck swag I got moxie 
 Lyrically ecstasy I got that oxy-contin poppin' 
 They can't carbon copy or mock me 
 Reign, independent off the books 
 Off the chain off the hinge off the hooks 
 It's not a game, I'm not a rook 
 "Y'all Know The Name", you love the look, listen 
 Who put these pussies on top 
 Putting out that pussy music, call it pussy pop 
 Playing them pussy games, sucker shit 
 Fucking around but they don't know just who they fucking wit 
 (x2) 
 I'm a Bad Motherfucker man 
 Universal, worldwide, you know my circle 
 Renegade, on the mic I might just murk you 
 Putting in that work, 'cause I do work, every verse is a virtue
