Fuck you know about struggle? The boy in the plastic bubble 
 When I drink away the pain I guzzle 
 My life is like a complicated mathematical puzzle, for real 
 Seen death twice, it's ugly motherfucker man 
 But you conversate with him when you suffering 
 He said, "Let go of the pain, you'll never rock the mic again 
 Your choice, slug to the brain or 20 Vicodin" 
 I kinda likened it to Ortho Tri-Cyclen 
 Disturbing the natural cycles of life and it's trifling 
 Fuck what you heard, less money more problems 
 4 years removed from the game with no album 
 I put the gun to my brain, but first I wrote a note to explain 
 Put the Luger in my head, and these are the words that I said 
 Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms will surely fall 
 And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all 
 Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind 
 Spring will come again... 
 Live... 
 Live... 
 Live... 
 Live 
 When your cerebral ceases to administer solace 
 And the only Faith you have left is a CD 
 From a singer who had a son with Christopher Wallace 
 Tomorrow is never 
 Hope is abolished 
 Mind and soul have little to no unity 
 Life threw a brick through my window of opportunity 
 My immune system lacked diplomatic immunity 
 When asthma attacks the black community 
 Where do you go from there? 
 Long walk, short pier 
 Thought I knew all it was just to know of the ledge 
 Till I glanced down at all ten toes on the ledge 
 Before I heard what sounded to me like a pledge 
 Emerged from the darkness, and this is what it said 
 "Do not despair, breathe, fight 
 For there is more life to live, believe 
 More insight to share, retrieve 
 Must dare to be illustrious 
 Exhale, hold, inhale, receive and live... 
 Live... 
 Live... 
 Live..." 
 Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms will surely fall 
 And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all 
 Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind 
 Spring will come again... 
 Live... 
 Live... 
 Live... 
 Live
