Please lord forgive me for my sins 
 My life is all I have to give 
 Please lord forgive me for my sins 
 My life is all I have to give 
 Damn you that lost the will to live 
 Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn 
 I threw a rock (Iraq), then I ran (Iran) 
 'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grips of the man 
 Y'all wanna ask me who's sane (Hussein) 
 These biological gasses are eating my brain 
 It's a political grab bag to rape mother earth 
 Thirty seconds after they bagged dad (Baghdad) for what he's worth 
 Thousands will die now so millions can smile later 
 This ain't the +Rockford Files+ nigga 
 They stockpile data for satellites 
 Where you discuss who's style is greater 
 In this killing pool you playing it cool like Cal Tjader 
 When y'all ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda 
 With weapons of mass destruction an hour later 
 What's your identidy today? 
 You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh? 
 This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray 
 For my identity your life is the penalty to pay 
 Motherfucker

 (Y'all ready to rock?) 
 {We ready to rock} 
 (Y'all ready to roll?) 
 {We ready to roll} 
 My life is all I have to give 
 Please lord forgive me for my sins 
 My life is all I have to give 
 Damn you that lost the will to live 
 Trapped in the game 
 Just tryin' to win (3x) 
 It's not a Vietnam song 
 I know women from desert storm who came back deformed 
 Missin' limbs and diseases in they legs and arms 
 Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange 
 Its messages in the bass drum 
 War goin' off in your mind 
 No man is safe from 
 It's not a Game Boy, Xbox, the PlayStation 
 Its +Resident Evil+ when every President's a mason 
 Robbin (Robin) y'all fools like Dick Grayson 
 And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them 
 Place them back 
 Face them facts 
 Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts 
 Pharoahe takes the authorities to court 
 Peep crime before it happens like +Minority Report+ 
 And I will never be mentally defenseless 
 Cats be on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin'

 (Monch) (2x) 
 Lock! Load! Into position 
 Rock! Roll! Its primitive coondition 
 (Monch) 
 Lock! Load! 
 Rock! Roll! 
 Into position 
 (Crowd) (2x) 
 We ready to rock 
 We ready to roll
