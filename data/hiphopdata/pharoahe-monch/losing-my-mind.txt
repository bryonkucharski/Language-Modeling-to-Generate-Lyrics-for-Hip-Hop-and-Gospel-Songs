(Mr. Porter) 
 A clock without a minute hand 
 An hourglass without sand 
 Suspended within space and time 
 I walk a thin line 
 Amongst the masses all alone 
 A furnished house with no one home 
 I see through walls that's hard to climb 
 I'm losing my mind 
 No Medicaid, no medication 
 Thinking you're better off dead 
 Instead should have been dedicated to education 
 I spin, the cylinder on my revolver 
 I spin, the cylinder 
 Would someone explain who'd leave a dick in charge of a bush 
 Of a colon I'm screwed, saw more war than Warsaw Poland, viewed 
 An infant's insides, outside of his body 
 Inside of a place of worship, ungodly 
 Out cries tears "Dear God, where are we?" 
 That's what I scream towards the skyline but probably 
 No one can hear a word of what I was saying 
 Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying 
 Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by 
 Lights flash, if I could only put the past on a flashdrive I'd 
 For peace of mind, install an external drive 
 So I'd be more driven internally to survive 
 I'm... 
 (Mr. Porter (Pharoahe Monch)) 
 A clock without a minute hand 
 An hourglass without sand 
 (So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver 
 I spin, the cylinder on my revolver) 
 Amongst the masses all alone 
 A furnished house with no one home 
 (So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver 
 I spin, the cylinder on my revolver) 
 My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health 
 It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth 
 Void, I defected, employed self annoyed 
 Went independent, enjoyed stealth 
 Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac 
 The rent's cheaper in the ghetto but you can't go back 
 So I, spin the cylinder on my revolver 
 Then, maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra 
 And dissolve into the abyss, without evolving 
 Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver 
 Research like, George Washington Carver 
 But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then 
 Part, instead of being incredibly defiant 
 Peddle through revenue issues I'll do it for medical science 
 It's better to be level-headed than to regret it and pious 
 Settling for life without sun-shine, never vibrant, I'm...

 A furnished house with no one home 
 I can see through walls it's hard to climb 
 I'm losing my- I'm losing my mind
