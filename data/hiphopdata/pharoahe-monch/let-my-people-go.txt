I'm too high to get over, too low to get under 
 (Let my people go) 
 I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder 
 (Let my people go) 
 I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder 
 (Let my people go) 
 (Yeah, somebody say) 
 (Let my people go) 
 (Huh, somebody say) 
 (Let my people go) 
 Spit miraculously, sip Dracula's blood, exist for centuries 
 The body chemistry mends wounds, heals injuries 
 My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin 
 Huh, I push the envelope like US mailmen 
 Huh, we need a leader who is not mischievous 
 Devious, from Satan's grip to lead us 
 Won't retract the facts then act facetious 
 In fact the racks are packed with facts that teach us 
 Reach us, easily leave MC's speechless 
 Read from the palm of the non-believers 
 Some of them wondering how they become underachievers 
 One of the best the perennial key note speaker 
 I got it, you want it, come get it so I'll flaunt it 
 And I will show you away 
 So let my people go today 
 There trying so sell lies to the people huh 
 Knowing it's hard times for the people huh 
 I'll knock your ass unconscious 
 Put it up on YouTube, then film the sequel so it's free for the people huh 
 Go on ahead and download it I'ma teach you how 
 P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher 
 With indisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now 
 I'm tying to learn your monk ass, I'm trying to reach you now 
 But still you're like who's this dude 
 Return to fix, shape the game like Rubik's cube 
 Chick seems brolic now ruthless too 
 Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do 
 DAMN! 
 Open your eyes man you've been bamboozled 
 By the usual plans hit up the middle like Stan Musial 
 If y'all are telling me today's music is suitable and appealing 
 Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual 
 Young children pull your pants on up 
 Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt 
 You need to let - all - the people - go 
 Pass the collection plates and give me all of my dough 
 And if your wondering what's under my robe 
 An old rusty ass .38 snub nose 
 And just because your thinking my shit don't work 
 That's a (*gunshot*) 
 Go on and try robbing my church!
