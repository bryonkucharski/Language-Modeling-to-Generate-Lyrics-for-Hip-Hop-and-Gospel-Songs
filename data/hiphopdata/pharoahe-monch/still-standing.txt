(Verse 1: Monch) 
 They said, please do not run too fast, stay off of the leaves 
 Do not play in the grass or climb the trees 
 You can't breathe, let alone you get stung by bees 
 Lord Jesus, your chest just might freeze up 
 13 months old with a lung disease 
 That almost took my life twice, brought me to my knees 
 A system not designed for you to achieve 
 Police squeeze, library lies, teacher deceives 
 But I rose to the top of my class like cream 
 Or the Lakers in the 80s, so worthy, I'm Kareem 
 Not MTV but my Sweet 16's 
 Married the mic, a love supreme 
 I'm clear it was a miracle with way I whetted the rhythm 
 Spiritual looking back at it, a lyrical exorcism 
 A half of the Afro-American dream; 
 To rap or quarterback for the professional team 
 I'm still standing, yeah, I'm still here, I'm still standing 
 Still standing, I'm still here 
 (Still standing, yeah, still standing) 
 Still standing, I'm still here 
 (Still Standing, yeah, still standing) 
 Still standing 
 (Verse 2: Monch) 
 I have no dead bodies to claim, never been a trigger man 
 Crack, never pedalled that, opposite of Jigga man 
 Doubled my expectancy, can you believe it? 
 Look, no bullet wounds, not paraplegic 
 Still standing like the pledge of allegiance 
 Moves made both emotional and strategic 
 My heart disintegrated into a million pieces 
 Listen, that's life, deal with it 
 Press reset, download pain, write a thesis 
 Performed for millions, Brazilian visas 
 (I got) Transcontinental indigenous divas 
 That speak multiple languages for unspeakable reasons 
 And still there are places that I never been 
 Like the Statue of Liberty, my knees will never bend 
 Except for when I'm speaking to God it feels like halftime 
 I'mma reach for the stars, I'm still standing 
 (Verse 3: Jill Scott) 
 Now I, I've seen some heartbreak in my life 
 And some burdens almost broke me down once or twice 
 But I held on, on to my faith 
 And I would never change a thing that brought me here today 
 'Cause it helped me grow and it helped me know 
 Which way to go, and which way to not go 
 And I'm so grateful, yeah I'm so grateful 
 'Cause I'm still, I'm still 
 Standing in the light 
 Standing in the light 
 Standing in the light
