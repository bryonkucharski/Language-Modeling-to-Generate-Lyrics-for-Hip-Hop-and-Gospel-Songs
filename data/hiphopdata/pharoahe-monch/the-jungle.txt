Southside, you know we living in the jungle 
 Brook'nam, you know we living in the jungle 
 See them gorillas over there in the park, them my niggas 
 After dark we get sparked up and pull triggers 
 You gotta speak orangutan slang or pull capers 
 The cops are the cheetahs and the trees are the skyscrapers 
 See in the jungle we often rumble for loot 
 Some of us just stumble around high off the booze, shoot 
 You get shot, shit 
 Play humble like last year when the cheetahs tried to catch my uncle 
 When you come through, you could get bumped too 
 If you don't got at least 4 to 5 gorillas amongst you 
 The bigger tree hit 'em shocked and amazed 
 41 shots hot, take you out in the blaze 
 And if not, they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage 
 Into the island where you spend your time counting the days 
 But still agriculturally, it's kind of ill, we blow mills 
 They make a killing and build new lands in the jungle 
 Shaolin, you know we living in the jungle 
 Chi-town, you know we living in the jungle 
 Westside, you know we living in the jungle 
 I tell these chimpanzees who be carrying tools 
 You don't wanna invest your life in a cesspool 
 Pharmaceutical distributin', breaking the rules 
 You need to take your monkey ass off to school 
 And learn about Botswana, Sudan and Ghana 
 Mozambique and speak of pride and honor 
 I understand sometimes we all feel fenced in 
 But utilize your mind to define dimensions 
 Just then I lost the little monkey's attention 
 As he stared into the distance focusing and squinting at a 
 Beautiful gazelle that was grazing in the grass with 
 Muscular legs and a rhinoceros ass 
 But in the least case scenario I did try to tell him 
 Hit him with some signs that was a little compelling 
 Little gibbon on a mission, not unlike Magellan 
 What you caught was some felons, crimes and drug selling in the jungle 
 Yo, Ghana, you know we living in the jungle 
 Cape Town, you know we living in the jungle 
 Jo-burg, you know we living in the jungle 
 I'm talking epileptic episodes off that Epinephrine 
 That Albuterol and them other prescribed medicines 
 A zombie in insomnia frecking the Amphetamines 
 My moms had me smoking weed from the Netherlands at age 13 
 Broke apart the scene, a lot of moist weed that was sticky and green 
 See in the 80's it was wine-coolers and woolies 
 The Facts of Life, crack, David Dinkins and toolies 
 Mike Jack said "kick me, kike me, Jew me" 
 Now all the white chicks in the world got booties 
 He rap by popular demand 
 And a nigga nosey on some Toucan Sam shit 
 You not Florida A&M, you not fam, dawg 
 That would be (Marco), that's my man 
 For biceps I isolate with one hand 
 For triceps I do reps with dip sets, but not Cam 
 Scandal, governors busted, got damn 
 Power to the people unite with one plan 
 I used to write about green eggs and ham 
 Till I found out the Food and Drug Administration was a scam 
 Now we steam vegetables, brown, forget the white rice 
 My life is all I have, studying zeitgeist 
 Lyrics bang now and again, sing like the Chi-Lites 
 It's my right to use my power to shine my light 
 To function, you know the function 
 Yo, Pharoahe Monch, what's your motherfucking function? 
 I go to Queens for queens, I eat organic in Brooklyn 
 Swing on a vine over the swine and keep 'em shook 
 And take the anaconda through the tunnels 
 Through the Mecca where the piranha try to ball and style on the persona 
 You know I keep it on the low like an iguana 
 When the monikers never leave the crib without the llama in the...
