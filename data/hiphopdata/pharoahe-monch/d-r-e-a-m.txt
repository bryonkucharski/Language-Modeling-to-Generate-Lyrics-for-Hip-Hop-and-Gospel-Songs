Pull myself together, put on a new face 
 Climb down up the hilltop, baby - ooh, I get back in the race 
 'Cause I've got dreams, yeah, dreams to remember 
 Yeah, yeah, I've got dreams, oh dreams to remember 
 Help me out 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 Yo, my destiny rules everything around me, dream, get the money 
 Dollar, dollar bill y'all 
 Everybody put their palms in the clouds, get your hands in the sky 
 So it's not a problem to feel, y'all 
 Even if I was broke as fuck I would lend you my last so you can holla at me still 
 PMC in the place to be on the M.I.C still spitting that real 
 Yo, you know the limericks are limitless, not limited in sentiment 
 But increments of infinite potental in the scenes 
 You could benefit from getting off of the internet 
 For just a minute, it's a simple song 
 You could sing or Memorex, I meant mimic it 
 When it hits the spirit it pulls the heartstrings 
 Infamous and kindred, it's intrinsic when it's still in us 
 From the genesis when we remember to dream, just... dream 
 (That means you) 
 I've got dreams to remember 
 I've got dreams, yeah dreams to remember 
 Help me out 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 Yo, my determination runs every aspect mentally, I'm no dummy 
 This scholar got skill, y'all 
 Can't take what I visualise from it, you pull the wool over my eyes 
 I swallowed the red pill 
 Even if I was broke as fuck I would lend you my last so you could holla at me still 
 Everybody put your palms to the clouds, get 'em up in the sky 
 So it's not a problem to feel 
 Welcome to the Age of Aquarius in the stages of various schemes 
 Precariously I escape when I dream 
 Each scene should win an Academy, put it up on the screen 
 My strategy: Pharoahe's the king of Queens 
 Who fiends for teens to view it as the new theme music 
 Use it to shape their futures when they daydream to it 
 Never elusive, never claim stupid 
 Lucid, boost your recruits when you sing to it and just... dream 
 (That means you) 
 I've got dreams 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 You know I'm down right excellent, about my scrilla, get the money 
 Dollar, dollar bill, y'all 
 I got you strung out on the music so I'm sort of like a dealer to a junkie 
 Swallow that pill, y'all 
 Sometimes it rains in Southern Cali and Philadelphia ain't always sunny 
 Just keeping it real, y'all 
 Talib Kweli in the place to be, yeah, you better believe 
 Come on, you know the deal, y'all 
 Five o'clock in the morning, just getting home from last night's performance 
 When I'm dead tired from touring I hit the coffin 
 I'm like a vampire required to stay dormant 
 Out of the range, the sunlight with a doubt it'd remain 
 I used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain 
 I took a break, had to find life's meaning again 
 Without the smoke in my lungs I started dreaming again 
 I dreamed of candy-coated cars and panties that go with bra's 
 Hurricanes named Sandy, I'm floating on Noah's ark, what? 
 Police'll bleed blue 'cause he staying true to the uniform 
 Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns (that's ridiculous) 
 The truth is I'm one of the best 
 And when you snooze that's when you meet the cousin of death 
 So when I say I never visited the cousin, I don't sleep 
 I stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep (dream) 
 I've got dreams to remember 
 I've got dreams, yeah dreams to remember 
 Help me out
