Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew 
 Damage, damage, damage, damage 
 They cock them hammers, wave them llamas 
 But that's that in front of the camera drama 
 So when the cameras are attached to dollys, I call them dali lama's 
 Mold me, loathe, hold me in the palm of your hand, load me 
 You know exactly what I am, murderer 
 When I'm inserted on to the top of fifteen family members 
 It's the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter, the martyr 
 This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity 
 Pro-fo-fo-fanity when they manually hammer me annually 
 You don't figitty faze me yo 
 I won't tigitty tase you bro 
 Figgity fucking cut you in half like it's nothing minus the laser scope 
 Then I will ring your bell like Avon 
 Before displaying some of my various tattoos (Trayvon) 
 The (Oscar) award winning (Aiyana Jones) hey (Sean) 
 Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters 
 Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm 
 Fuck a stray bullet, I take aim when the gun draws 
 For ever-lasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws 
 'Cause post traumatic stress disorder, ask any vet I've worked with 
 My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus 
 Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew 
 Damage, damage, damage, damage 
 Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver (TWIST) 
 Scratch your name off my calendar 
 See that was me through a silencer 
 What you just heard was a .44 caliber 
 Now you can fill in the blanks 
 I will pillage your town 
 Killing them with Dillinger rounds 
 Nigga fill in the clip 'cause I'm willing to flip 
 See I'm sort of certified, I'm fortified live 
 You would be mortified if I would put on screen what I've seen 
 Horrified holy Bibles, rivals, vital organs 
 Little bitty baby bodies, bridal gowns coffins 
 Morphine, gang bang, gangrene, slauson, swap meet 
 Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop 
 I love hate, hate cops 
 That's why I laugh when you pull it 
 I'm motivated and crass 
 I'm so elated when I see them on the news (you fuckin' pigs!) 
 They flying the flag half mass 
 See there's no need for conversation 
 When we're discussing the bullet's point of view 
 Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew 
 Damage, damage, damage, damage
