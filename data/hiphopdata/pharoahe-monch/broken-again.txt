Gotta move on 
 Gotta let go 
 Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known 
 After all of this time 
 Took my heart to mend 
 That I'd turn around, and be broken again 
 (2x) 
 They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty 
 I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be 
 Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen 
 On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin' 
 She rescued me, my heroine to the end 
 But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe 
 Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring 
 Tap! five times to find a vein in there 
 Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas 
 And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing 
 But what they saw was a despicable human being 
 So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing 
 Convert two into one, an indivisible plan 
 To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man 
 Sentimental education, beautiful weather 
 Dam was constantly catching fire 
 Richard Pryor 
 Her skin deteriorated 
 Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came 
 So humiliated, started begging for change 
 Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain 
 Nice clothes became frayed 
 So isolated and afraid 
 I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and 
 I'm relocated in Alabama now 
 That Maalox and Mylanta now 
 And it won't stop the burn 
 Constantly searching for the answers how 
 I could kiss the sky without enhancing 
 But, it's so hard to learn 
 Gotta move on 
 Gotta let go 
 Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known 
 After all of this time 
 Took my heart to mend 
 That I'd turn around, and be broken again 
 (2x)
