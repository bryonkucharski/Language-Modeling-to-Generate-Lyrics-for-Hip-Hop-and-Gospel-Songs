(Hook: Citizen Cope) 
 It doesn't take your eyes to see what the paint won't take away 
 When they take that veil away 
 You're just caught up in the mass confusion 
 Confused by the Grand Illusion 
 They're never gonna let you see it 
 'Cause if they did, we'd all be free, yeah 
 You're just caught up in the mass confusion 
 Confused by the Grand Illusion 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 We were told that the Hell below was a fiery inferno 
 I rediscovered my soul between the lines inside my journal 
 Trapped within a +Penn State+ of mind, Joe Paterno 
 External gratification is not happiness eternal 
 Interject, intellect, intercept, Internet 
 A slave majority where five percent benefit 
 Photoshopped images, re-touched photography 
 Pornography, sodomy, child labor economy 
 Put away your hope, same political policies 
 Two-thousand and ten, only minus the space odyssey 
 There's gotta be a better way, we pray to hit the lottery 
 We all need of the rapist... 
 For the robbery of our God, an official public apology 
 An angel plotted to have Organized Konfusion 
 You fell for the delusion, I'll expose the movement 
 Illusion... 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 Professional analysts, rhetoric, rambling 
 Symbicort, Advair, Albuterol, ambient 
 I change the channel on commercials when I'm channeling 
 Everybody's a star, lights, cameras 
 Seventeen-thousand times a day the human eye blinks 
 Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks 
 IPhone, iChat, who gives a fuck what I think? 
 One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank 
 There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow 
 We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show 
 Your leader is the host, the results are painful 
 The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled 
 Their only contribution to the world is a delusion 
 Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution 
 Pharoahe Monch, the antonym for translucent 
 Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement 
 Illusion...
