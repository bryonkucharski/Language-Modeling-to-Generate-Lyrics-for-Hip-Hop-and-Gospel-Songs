If speed is what you need 
 If progress what you want to possess 
 See, when the system get you down 
 You got to just stand 
 I am just one man but I know my power 
 It's the final call, we're in the final hour 
 And we must not divide as we march toward our future 
 Who are they to decide when they conspire to shoot yah 
 Ah, that could've been my mother 
 Oh, that could've been my brother 
 As sure as we circle the sun and the earth revolves 
 Get involved, get involved, get involved, get involved 
 Stand your ground 
 They'll say I've lost my mind, claim that I'm psychotic 
 He's a fucking traitor, he's unpatriotic 
 But I learned in life, truth, it must be slated 
 And I know my rights, they're un-alienated 
 Descendent of the blood of slaves 
 Used to be the one afraid 
 Until I learned my soul's divine 
 Amalgamate, let's combine, unify, get in line and 
 Stand your ground
