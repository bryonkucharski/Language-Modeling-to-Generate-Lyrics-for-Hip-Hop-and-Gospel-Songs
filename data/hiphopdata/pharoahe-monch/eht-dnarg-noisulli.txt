(The Stepkids) 
 It doesn't take your eyes to see what the paint won't take away 
 When they take that veil away 
 We're caught up in the mass confusion 
 Confused by the Grand Illusion 
 They're never gonna let you see it 
 'Cause if they did, we'd all be free 
 We're caught up in the mass confusion 
 Confused by the Grand Illusion 
 We were told that the Hell below was a fiery inferno 
 I rediscovered my soul between the lines inside my journal 
 Trapped within a Penn State of mind, Joe Paterno 
 External gratification is not happiness eternal 
 Interject, intellect, intercept, Internet 
 A slave majority with one percent benefit 
 Photoshopped images, re-touched photography 
 Pornography, sodomy, child labor economy 
 Put away your hope, same political policies 
 Two-thousand and ten, only minus the space odyssey 
 There's gotta be a better way, we pray to hit the lottery 
 We all need a the rapist... 
 For the robbery of our God, an official public apology 
 An angel plotted to have Organized Konfusion 
 You fell for the delusion, I'll expose the movement 
 Illusion...

 Political imcompetent, rhetoric, redundant 
 Pundit she was fear to control emotions so I'm done with 
 I reveal a force field for nonsense in my circumference 
 While we waste resources in abundance 
 Seventeen-thousand times a day the human eye blinks 
 Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks 
 Home alone in my iPad, iPhone, iThink 
 One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank 
 There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow 
 We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show 
 The president is the host, the results are painful 
 The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled 
 Their only contribution to the world is a delusion 
 Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution 
 Pharoahe Monch, the antonym for translucent 
 Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement 
 Illusion...
