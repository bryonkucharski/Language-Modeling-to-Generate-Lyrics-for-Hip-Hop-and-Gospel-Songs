Yuh, new Tigallo new tigallo new tigallo new tigallo, yo 
 We go off, say who go off? 
 Nigga we go off 
 Flow fitted to a tee dawg I might go golf 
 On stage in all black dawg I might go goth 
 Say I might go floss, 'cause we go hard 
 I mean macro-hard not microsoft 
 Party time excellent nigga I might go Garth 
 'Cause we go off I said we go-- 
 Yo, hold up 
 Niggas looking like fools punching out of their weight class 
 Looking like food under pressure they break-fast 
 It's looking like school and I'm the invincible principal 
 Joe Clark and you niggas sign in get a late pass 
 Yeah nigga, I go boss, 'cause once the buzzer go off 
 Don't nobody give a fuck what you ranked as 
 It's only wins and losses, Benz and Porsches 
 So pardon if I offend any friends or sources 
 That never seen the hunger, no meager portions 
 Starvation, bar none like Klondike 
 They saying Phonte's the incarnation of verbal murder 
 Pin it on me like prom night nigga 
 'Cause I go off, yeah I go off 
 Negro spiritual rap, slave to the rhythm looking like I might go North 
 'Cause I go off, yeah I go-- 
 Yo, hold up 
 Pharoahe the god strike the mic hard like Ty Cobb with a bat 
 Physicist the antithesis of Steve Jobs when he raps, mack 
 Sick gonorrhea clap! Onomatopoeia, smack the shit out you, you have no idea 
 Send a stranger to rearrange your Range Rover key your Kia 
 P'll see ya via satellite with money longer than Nia's 
 Fuck chivalry I will end a chick's career 
 And return to forever, I am Chick Corea 
 At O'Hare Air with surface to air missiles for your lair 
 (Missile sounds)-- What you will hear before I send you to visit Aaliyah 
 Proceed with caution, he strikes with force and of course 
 You need to borrow some sorcery with a cross to bear 
 And a culture enforcing the nuclear laws of North Korea 
 So awesome, when we morphing 
 Pharoahe, Tigallo 
 We go off, we throw off and 
 Yes yes y'all 
 We go off, say who go off? 
 Nigga we go off 
 Flow fitted to a tee dawg I might go golf 
 On stage in all black dawg I might go goth 
 Yeah we go floss, we go so hard 
 I mean macro-hard never Microsoft 
 Stomach and the titties out, baby girl go Ross 
 'Cause we go off yeah we go off, yeah
