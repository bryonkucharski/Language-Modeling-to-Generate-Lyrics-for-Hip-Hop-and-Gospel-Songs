They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
 Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
 He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go 
 I'd rather be at home with ray 
 I ain't got seventy days 
 'Cause there's nothing 
 There's nothing you can teach me 
 That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway 
 I didn't get a lot in class 
 But I know it don't come in a shot glass 
 They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
 Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
 (Now rocking with the best Amy baby) 
 The man said 'why do you think you here?' 
 I said 'I got no idea 
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby 
 So I always keep a bottle near' 
 He said 'I just think your depressed', 
 (The best Amy Amy) 
 Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest 
 They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' (Yes) 
 Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
 Young, uh 
 More money, more checks, I'm addicted to fresh 
 6 pair of kicks is my definition of 12 steps 
 Kick back in the back, get the phantom to drop 
 Bass blaring outta my system, that's how I detox 
 O when will he stop, he still pumping that real shit 
 My flow so dumb, my face is numb, nigga, I don't feel shit 
 Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control 
 They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no 
 And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby 
 Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me 
 Oh look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping 
 Every time I try to get out it pulls me back in 
 Amy should have rehabed him,'stead she doubled his ration 
 Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion? 
 My heroine flows more deeper than Marilyn's nose I'm an O.D. 
 Till I'm in peace like Anna Nicole, 
 Hov! 
 I don't ever wanna drink again 
 I just ooh I just need a friend 
 I'm not gonna spend ten weeks 
 Have everyone think I'm on the mend 
 It's not just my pride 
 It's just till these tears have dried 
 They tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go
