Uh-huh, all right, all right, all right, okay, uh-huh, a-yeah 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 It was like the earth twisted around her 
 She shifted the ground I was like, "Oh... SHIT!" 
 She's off the hook, I would dress her decently 
 But look her body is immaculate I'm attackin it from all positions 
 Of thinkin' inside my mind-ah 
 Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say, 
 "Excuse me, can I have your number please? 
 I'll get on my knees if I have to" 
 She'll laugh through, the whole episode 
 Just then I knew I had her locked (down) 
 No cock-blocking please this one's mine (uh) 
 Dimepiece and shit son, shorty was fine 
 Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear 
 Sparklin the whole time as I whispered in her ear 
 Chorus: repeat 2X
