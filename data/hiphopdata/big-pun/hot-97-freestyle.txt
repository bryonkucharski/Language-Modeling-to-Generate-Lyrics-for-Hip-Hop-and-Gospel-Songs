 Uh 
 Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact 
 Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats 
 Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap 
 That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you 
 That's... mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong 
 The marriage, a bond of havoc and song 
 This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you 
 There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked 
 In the closet of my castle of Grayskull 
 I'm possum at grade school, that's how I have to debate you 
 Raps are like cables, snatchin' you fatal 
 That's how master degrades you 
 I'm battlin' Jesus if he passes through my label 
 Snatchin' his halo 
 God I pray that you send my father back as an angel 
 Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin' 
 I'm only emphasizin', I'm still all about business and enterprisin' 
 I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals 
 That's used contenicals inside of my mental projectable 
 Just call me Baby Jesus 'cause lately niggaz is praisin' me 
 Just for the way I blaze to be crazily, tape to CD lasery 
 It pays to be amazingly flavery 
 Gaze Into my eyes that basically hypnotize you occasionally 
 Plus I'm hard to talk to, if you live I probably thought you stalked you 
 Where you walked to at night, caught you then tried to extort you 
 New York niggaz is trigger happy, Pataki scared 
 This town ain't big enough for both of us (And we ain't Goin' Nowhere) 
 There it is, plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental 
 While slow niggaz better know I blow their brains out they temples 
 I'm into black magical torture romantic dramatical author 
 Compatible with the average New Yorker 
 A fast talker, like Tony when gas whores I'm the masked enforcer 
 Out for the cash and the cho-cha 
 Smash the coca, bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up 
 If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff 
 I don't give a fuck any more, I'm only twenty-four years old 
 And I've already broken every law 
 I'm horrorcore, this is for the heads 
 Runnin' up in your crib, knot if you still hot in under the bed 
 (Yeah) yeah one more yo, I'm gonna give one more for Montana 
 Yo yo yo 
 Yo yo yo 
 Ay-yo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team 
 Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden 
 I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead 
 So every night before bed you see the "BP" shine off the (board head) 
 Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap 
 'Cause he ain't worth jack 
 Hit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap 
 Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack 
 Hand him his purse back 
 I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull 
 Master the flow, niggaz be swearin' I'm blacker than coal 
 Like Nat King, I be rapping and tongue's packing 
 The ones, magnums, cannons and gatling guns 
 It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony... Montana 
 You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana 
 C'mon-pana we need more rhymers 
 Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda 
 I'm in Ivana with wine-a, try to match my persona 
 Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana 
 Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna 
 Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma
