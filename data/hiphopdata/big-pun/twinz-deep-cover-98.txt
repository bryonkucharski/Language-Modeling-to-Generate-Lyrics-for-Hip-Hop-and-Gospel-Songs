Ready for war Joe, how you wanna blow they spot 
 I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop 
 Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready 
 Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti 
 Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor, Joey Crack, buck 'em all 
 If they move, Noodles shoot that fuckin' whore 
 Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know 
 That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly 
 It'll be a cold day in hell the day I'm taken out 
 Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill 
 I'm still the Fat One that you love to hate, catch you at your 
 Mother's wake 
 Smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight 
 I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children 
 Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity fillin' 
 Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian 
 The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing 
 A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss 
 Forever and take all the cheddar like child support 
 I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves 
 My brother from another mother sent from the above 
 A thug nigga just like me, one of the best - might be 
 Even better leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee 
 Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture 
 You small change, I'm blowin' out your brains gettin' richer 
 Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what? 
 You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck 
 Trunk jewels (jewels), cruisin' in the Land, pumpin' "Cash Rules" 
 Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryin' to pass through 
 That's true, so who the next to get it? 
 TS the best that did it (get it off your chest kid admit it) 
 And it's 
 Here, and you don't stop 
 Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killer filled up to the top 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop 
 Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt 
 Take 'em feet first through the morgue, then launch 'em in the T-bird 
 The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased 
 Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary 
 Tight as I can, I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl 
 Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real 
 You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it 
 Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it 
 Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer 
 All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena 
 Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and 
 You never see me talk to police, so 
 You should know that I really don't care 
 Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there 
 So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak 
 And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets 
 Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans 
 Known for slashin' catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin' 
 Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes 
 Three Tecses in the jeep Lexus just in case police test us 
 Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars 
 Full-A-Clips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers 
 Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down 
 Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down 
 We lock towns like rounds in the chamber 
 Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine 
 Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York 
 When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk 
 And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it 
 Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury ya 
 So remember the Squad that I'm reppin' 
 I fill a clip of my weapon and Punish niggas till it's Armageddon 
 And it's 
 Here, and you don't stop 
 Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killer filled up to the top 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop 
 And it's 
 Here, and you don't stop 
 Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killer filled up to the top 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop
