(Ashanti) 
 Something, I want to tell you 
 There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know 
 Big Pun be the largest thang 
 Straight out of the projects 
 And that's how we roll... roll... 
 (Big Pun) 
 You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana 
 In a zone, sittin' on chrome, stoned sippin on cham-pagna 
 Rollin' ganja up in bible papers, see how high the lye can take us 
 Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob 
 I make the kind of green a hustler dream 
 Bustin' out the custard cream Viper 
 Custom piped up with the mustard seams 
 Clustered green Fort Knox and hard (?) medallions 
 Mockin God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad 
 I got the +Squad+ over-qualified, pullin over Karl Kani 
 Range Rover tilted, three-wheelted hydraulic slide 
 Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin 
 Like the Wu do in Shaolin 
 (Chorus: Ashanti) 
 Ooohooo there's, something, I want to tell you 
 There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know 
 Big Pun be the largest thang 
 Straight out of the projects 
 And that's how we roll... roll... 
 (Big Pun) 
 I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat 
 What you broke motherfuckers know about that? 
 Lookin' fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli 
 Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli 
 On the celly (blown Benz, chrome rims) 
 Shinin like the (stone gems) on my (gold rings) 
 I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story 
 That soared me from livin' poorly to a modern day Cinderfella 
 I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga 
 But now I'm like Puffy cause money's thicker than blood player 
 I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip 
 Call my connects together 
 And figure which cleaner's the best for the hit 
 I get the job done, Pun's handlin business 
 Candlelight dinners, havin' a toast with the most glamorous bitches 
 My road to riches was no Christmas 
 Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses 
 So expensive my whole family's religious 
 (Big Pun) 
 Aiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial 
 Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle 
 I'm tryin' to triple a million and split it three ways 
 Joe the God, Full Eclipse, and myself - that'll be the day 
 I need a way to get it already got the ambition 
 Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition 
 I'm on a mission which requires a higher position 
 Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin 
 I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last 
 But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin' on your ass 
 I'm all about cash and the power 
 A stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour 
 Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks 
 So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops 
 Forget the cops, we got Deserts and glocks too 
 Ready to rock whoever tryin' to stop our cheddar from stockin forever 
 (Ashanti) 
 Big Pun is the largest thang 
 Joey Crack be stayin paid 
 Terror Squad from the projects man... {*fades*}
