Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck alot 
 Jump on top of my dick and work them hips 
 Until I bust a shot 
 It doesn't stop, I'm only beginning 
 I'm boning your women, while you home all alone 
 I'm going up in 'em 
 Sending them back to you, mad at you 
 Don't catch a motha' fuckin' attitude, I'm just showing you 
 How this rapper do 
 Capital Punishment, when I'm up in there 
 Suckin' it, bustin' it out, nice blouse 
 Let me unbutton it 
 You fuckin' wit King Papi Chulo 
 And knockin' culo, poppin' mooners out the socket 
 Tryin' to ride wit the sumo 
 You know my rhymes is high 
 Word I be thrillin' 'em bitch be tryin' to ride 
 But the curb be killin' 'em 
 Fillin' 'em with the gas 
 My G's premium unleaded, come get it, first work the tongue 
 Then let the Pun hit it 
 Split it in half 
 Watch the gatt, baby take a bath, be good, I might put away the wood 
 And give you the mustache 
 1 - I ain't a player, I just fuck alot 
 I'm not a player, I just fuck alot 
 I ain't a player, I just fuck alot 
 I'm not a player, I just fuck alot 
 I bang a stranger 
 In my torture chamber, feed the loca chocha pinga 
 While I force my finga whre my bolas lingah 
 I bring the pain like Method 
 When I flex I flip the coochie, Puerto Rican to the core 
 And no Boricuas eat the pussy 
 Excuse me for being blunt 
 But I been eating cunts, since pimps is pushing 
 Pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps 
 Bumpin' and grindin' 
 Simultaneously want it, climbing up the walls 
 With my balls bangin' off your hymen 
 I'm a diamond in the rough 
 Bustin' in your face, taste the sweetness of my dick 
 Rip your fetus out of place, yo 
 Bitches already know the repertoore 
 Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-trois 
 Like Escobar 
 By far, I'm the best at all sex positions 
 Forget the kissin', I'm skippin' the tongue twistin' 
 See, that's tradition 
 Some chick in back of me 
 Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's 
 'Cause she heard I was packin' meat 
 I bagged the freak 
 And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted the belly 
 And put it in her mouth like Akinyele 
 Far from ugly 
 But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money 
 The honies got nothin' but love for me 
 So rub my tummy and make a wish 
 I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks 
 Come back and fix your favorite dish 
 Crazy bitch 
 I ain't with that, I'mma hit that, split back to the shack 
 Where my other chick's at 
 Now can you dig that 
 I'm the Mack doin' my thing, pulling your strings 
 Making you feel like you in a dream 
 It's the king of the hip-hop quotables 
 Giving you multiples, just by the tone 
 Of my voice and the vocables 
 I notice you doin' your thing 
 With your crew, is it aight if I come down there 
 And sing to you
