(Big Pun) 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo... 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo... 
 Yo, yo... 
 It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain 
 Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane 
 Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets from Harlem to 
 Queens 
 Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream 
 Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team 
 Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack 
 That'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse 
 I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back 
 And start from scratch 
 I'm locked and I'm trapped in a giant cage 
 Tryin' to savior these few dyin' days 
 I have left, to the form of flesh... 
 Should I lie in my grave? 
 I'm tryin' to persuade, my matto is try to be brave 
 And not give death the satisfaction of seein me dyin' afraid 
 That why I rise from the grave singing church songs like 
 I was Je-sus Christ ba-rum-pum-pum-pum 
 [Big Pun] (Chorus) 
 Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes? 
 Knockin' at ya front door 
 And he wants waaaaaaaaaaar... yeah 
 He ain't a rapper he'll kill you 
 (Big Pun) 
 Till my last breath I'll have death before dishonor 
 (Come on) and welcome drama (yeah) 
 Wit open arms and a code of honor 
 My hole persona equals that of gods 
 Definin' matters hard all before you even had a job 
 I'll stab and rob if I have to 
 Fuck it I'll blast you, tell the devil it wuz Pun if he ask you 
 And let him know how we be deadin' um' 
 Show 'em my emblem, the tombstone, the throne, every millennium 
 A child is born that can preform at a level beyond the 
 Expected 4 minute 30 second song 
 We reign supreme, my team be all up in ya dream 
 Wit the "kill anything" grill, chillin' beside the guilotine 
 Executioner style, black suit and a smile 
 Who's next to get their neck hacked loose in the crowd, move from the aisle 
 Don't make me have to prove that I'm wild 
 Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggaz shoot in the clouds 
 (Who's in the house) 
 Punisher straight from hell. Who's in the house 
 (Terror Squad motherfucker we the real) 
 What the deal, now you know that's how we roll 
 Hard core like BO bring in the corns baby bow 
 (Chorus 2x's)
