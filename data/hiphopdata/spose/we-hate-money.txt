We hate money 
 Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
 We hate money 
 And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
 We hate money 
 Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
 We hate money 
 And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 
 If I ever had money, I would do some crazy shit 
 I'd probably hire Lady Gaga to babysit 
 So give me money, and I'll be like "Fuck it" 
 I'll drop a hundred grand to make a vegan man eat turducken 
 You know I wouldn't hold off, I would spend my figures 
 Get a nose job, make it even bigger 
 Set my Nissan on fire on the lawn 
 Then I buy my own plane, step on and yell "Bomb!" 
 And as my ego and my pockets swell 
 I'd fly to the next town to go to Taco Bell 
 Then I'd pay all the haters to become believers 
 I'd pay Kanye West to punch Justin Bieber 
 And then I'd buy a bunch of heroin and get really arrogant 
 And pay all the foreigners to become Americans 
 The possibilities are endless 
 I would even go to the dentist, but 
 We hate money 
 Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
 We hate money 
 And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
 We hate money 
 Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
 We hate money 
 And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 
 We got trash on the porch, we never owned a Porsche 
 We only wear our neckties to weddings and to court 
 Our pay gets docked like it's coming into port 
 So we keep cigars split up like they're getting a divorce 
 Employees all annoyed, checks all void 
 Eminem's the only one still employed in Detroit 
 Bobzins and jobs from Nevada to Dakotas 
 And we're not Japanese but we're broke as Toyotas 
 Broseph, I know you know this fired and demoted 
 They're drinking tapwater 'cause they can't afford sodas 
 Struggling, covering shifts just to buy Christmas gifts 
 Before Tiger had mistresses 
 We're at Wal-Mart, we hate Wall Street 
 As far as being in debt, we're balls deep 
 Collectors call me, fucking all week 
 But I send that shit straight to voicemail 
 We hate money 
 Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
 We hate money 
 And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
 We hate money 
 Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
 We hate money 
 And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 
 They told us "Go to college, expand our domes" 
 Now we're jobless, with sixty thousand dollars in loans 
 And the bank account's minus, surviving debt 
 While the CEOs fly by in private jets 
 So let me see your lighters, the funds couldn't be tighter 
 And you call orderves appetizers 
 If your whole predicament's vile, but you're still trying to smile 
 With the bills piled for miles 
 Problems, we've got ninety-eight plus one, no trust funds 
 If the cops come we must run 
 I do it for my belt buckle, black lung, 
 White knuckle, blue collar 
 Cold-hearted slaves to the dollar saying 
 We hate money 
 Broke people stand up, if you lack cash put a hand up 
 We hate money 
 And all the people getting paid, throw all your money on stage 
 We hate money 
 Dollars, cash, cheese, unless you're gonna give some to me 
 We hate money 
 And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine 
 We hate money 
 Broke people stand up, if you lack cash keep your hands up 
 We hate money 
 And all the people getting paid, you can all go away 
 We hate money 
 (And) dollars (and) cash (and) cheese (and) unless you're gonna give some to me 
 We hate money 
 And everyone who has it, we would do things that you couldn't imagine
