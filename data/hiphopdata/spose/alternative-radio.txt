 Haha, are we recording? 
 I was Six years old, in kindergarten 
 When my parents got divorced 
 It was the first time I heard the "C" word 
 Standing there on the porch 
 And then we all went back inside 
 We turned the radio way up high 
 We were hoping for some better times 
 Kurt Cobain said "Whatever, Nevermind" 
 We would listen to the... 
 I was Ten years old and I woke up for school and I made my bed 
 Around the time Billy Corgan wore silver pants and he shaved his head 
 Then, I heard them yell downstairs 
 Not another morning with a fight down there 
 I turned my radio up all the way

 That's when his mom walked in 
 I got grounded for quite a long time 
 I would do little, hung over, where is my mind?

 I was Twenty-Four years old when I had the offspring of my own 
 I miss her when I'm out on tour 
 Singing interstate love-songs 
 So I call home on the phone she says "I miss you too" 
 I said "Loving is what I got" I said "Remember that" 
 It's a Bittersweet Symphony When you think of me 
 But in a few days I will be back and we can listen to the... 
 (Verse 4][Played under the hook) 
 I never quit getting lit like my own worst enemy 
 Eddie Vedder-y flannels till I'm seventy
