Spose and Shane Reis: 
 I'm a work in progress 
 I might just work forever 
 I know the sun is shining behind this cloudy weather 
 And I, I'm not perfect 
 But I'm, I'm getting better 
 I'm a work in progress, I might just work forever 
 I don't know 
 Spose: 
 I can't help but feel like I'm destined to do this but I'm in my way 
 I'm working it, working it, working it, working it every day 
 I chiseled the sculpture, I take a look at it, that ain't how I planned it 
 I might need to switch my perspective and view from a whole 'nother vantage 
 Cause some of the things you could say about me would be true, and be disparaging 
 I hope I don't leave none of those traits to my daughters when I die in their inheritance 
 I'm a bright spark in a dark room, I'll persevere, that's how I'm built 
 I won't wait, I will work till I'm great, I made more mistakes than my grammy made quilts 
 I am part one, wait for part two 
 Got my leg in the door in '04 from my dreaming, was screaming "somebody record me" 
 I promise I will be dope when I'm forty 
 Now I got my whole body in the room, bitch 
 Sorry I called you a bitch 
 I get excited, I'm talking my shit 
 I feel like Kanye but white and not rich 
 I am a desk full of stuff, stacked 
 Aggressive, a muskrat 
 I will stretch, I will touch, tap 
 I'm a sketch, I'm a rough draft 
 But I'm wide awake, and I'm tossing and turning 
 And I can't sleep at times 
 Got my family on my mind 
 And I'm gon' work until they never have to work no more 
 Shane Reis: 
 I don't know what to think, they put out a tape every month 
 Maybe it's them, or maybe it's me, or maybe I don't write enough 
 But when you only write what you feel 
 Sometimes it kinda gets tough 
 Cause the world is moving so fast 
 And I'm not feeling so young 
 I was just a kid, say 17, and I entered in a new world, never had a plan 
 Face bare, so was the planner, saw my old man pimp himself out the truck for not enough bucks 
 He said, "Son, it's gonna be tough, at least I gave you a work ethic and some manners" 
 Maybe got the manners from my mother, now I gotta fill the cupboards when you hammer for the supper 
 They told me we work in the cold and the snow and the rain, welcome to Maine 
 Fresh out of grade twelve, not getting paid well, walking on eggshells 
 Eight years later, couple tapes and a record 
 Between being on the road and being up at the same time that I'm getting home 
 It feels like I work forever 
 Young, good, gotta do better 
 Two little dudes like a mirror made of pressure 
 I could never ever give the minimal of effort 
 I know she got me, rich, broke or whatever 
 I consider it never, I'd rather have less than a drip in the desert 
 (?) Stitch in the dresser, or listen to Ke$ha 
 I work when I'm sick and I'm hurt till I'm better 
 Cause money is money, you can't never make enough and can't pay attention to them, they saying nothing 
 If they not down unless something big comes around, then there's nothing up for discussion 
 That's everybody, me included, I'm turning up, like the heat's included 
 They're complaining about no savings to make these payments but still I'm changing
