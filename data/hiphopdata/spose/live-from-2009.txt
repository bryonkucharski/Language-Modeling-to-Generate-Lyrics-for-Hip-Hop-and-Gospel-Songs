Live from 2009 
 Got astounding thymes for your pals in line 
 You wanna blaze and freestyle? That sounds divine 
 Up in York County, Maine, you are bound to find 
 Spose, big-ass nose, not around dimes 
 I been to Bang Bros about a thousand times 
 I think all your songs sound asinine 
 Is this the rap scene I'm supposed to galvanize?? 
 Never done that but I'm down to try 
 My off-the-top shit left crowds surprised 
 To the big drug dealer with a pound to buy 
 I got an eighth of the mersh from my town supply 
 Most rap careers here get floundered down drains 
 Now found around fame, renowned around Maine 
 But me, I'm the show-stealing concert burglar 
 I'll make your head Bob like Discount Furniture 
 Ryan you will try to be, see me, you'll lie to me 
 You'll love me to my face, hate on me when you Bounce like dryer sheets 
 Unfulfilled dreams? They've got my self-esteem 
 Lower than my credit score, yet my metaphors gleam 
 Rap? I'm the Neosporin for it 
 Watch me kick it like Chuck Norris 
 With the brokest and the poorest 
 Never focused on a chorus 
 Living life boring? That's foreign to me 
 Who else was born in M-E with albums warmly received? 
 Riddle me that 
 In the Wells, M-E, S-P-O-S-E 
 We smoked it all, motherfucekr
