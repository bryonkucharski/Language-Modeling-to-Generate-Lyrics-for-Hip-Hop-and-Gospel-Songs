Yo, I wake up make a K-Cup then I blaze up, shave with a razorblade 
 My hat is still crooked 
 I'm reading a book and 
 My body was made in Maine 
 Man, I'm still deflecting all the bill collectors 
 And I hate when they say my name 
 My buzz would be massive 
 If I wasn't slacking and 
 Jerking to Jayden Jaymes 
 Celtics sticker 
 On the bumper 
 Of a clunker 
 But my vocals real 
 Fuck rap. I might sell my mic and buy a snowmobile 
 I can't relate to throwing money when she makes it clap 
 I can relate to doing dishes. We should take a nap: 
 Tired like Michelin of your wrists when they're glistening 
 We don't want no yacht to float but just a boat to go fishing in 
 Man my whole yard is a minor mess 
 Go hard till my dying breath 
 Owe bars to the IRS 
 We got no Rs in our dialect 
 Me and my peeps speak a different kind of speech 
 Where Verizon 4G don't reach 
 (Can you me now?) 
 Coming live from where mill towns are still towns 
 Even though they shut the mills down 
 But I'm feeling like the King of Maine 
 The King of Maine 
 Wear a seal-skin jersey to the Sea Dogs game 
 I'm the King of Maine 
 The King of Maine 
 Plow truck all gold never hydroplane 
 I tell em: Welcome to 207. 
 Welcome-Welcome to 207. 
 Welcome to 207. 
 Welcome-Welcome to 207. 
 It's the way life should be: everything's pleasant 
 Tell 'em: this-th-th-this is 207. 
 Hey, hey, I heard the news in the street 
 That we're the shit and you're the pubes on the seat 
 Even though I triple bogey that par 5 
 Rangoon with my mai tai 
 Steal another motherfucker's WiFi 
 Got Texas Pete on my Five Guys 
 I'm back 
 Facts: spit a little bit but I never made a gat go cap cap pap 
 But my backpack on and I'm smoking 
 Being homeless is bogus 
 So paying bills is my motive 
 Can't afford G4s I'm poor on tour in a worn '04 Ford Focus 
 Ayup 
 I know that this weed might be the death of me 
 But I got this "O" broke up like it's parentheses 
 I'm yellin' ayup 
 I weigh a buck forty still but when my finger tips touch the quill 
 I'll be feeling like I'm Paul Pierce and I'm Rondo 
 I'm John Deere and I'm John Doe 
 I'm the rap star from the back yard who never acts hard or went half-heart 
 I'm the Peoples Douche: 
 AKA The Truth 
 Everytime that I get in the booth I'll be feeling like 
 I'm from the 420 minus 213 
 I'm on the throne if you're looking for who to unseat 
 I got mooseblood in my goblet 
 Lobsters in my optics 
 I'm live on the map 
 Where the dudes don't rap 
 In the Altima black who I do go past 
 Come hop in 
 Find me chillin' in Rockland 
 Where the townies sell oxies 
 So the coroners got coffins 
 It's my fault my paid because of what I say 
 I rock it for a profit pockets fat as Paul Lepage 
 Got a tattoo on my arm that says "Don't Stop" 
 'Cause other guys told me otherwise when we talked 
 I told 'em Wells, Maine what the sign say 
 Where I go ape with my primates 
 Rhyme great 
 16s like 2 times 8 
 Wine grapes and prime steaks 
 Damn I'm feeling marvelous 
 Had a hand with no good cards in it that I parted with 
 I'm an artisan 
 I think you're an amateur 
 Kids, cops, janitors 
 All pull out their cameras 
 When I walk out of Hannaford
