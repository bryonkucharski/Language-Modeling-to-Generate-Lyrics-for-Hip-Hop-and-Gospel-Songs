Spose: 
 Came in the game with a brain, not a chain 
 Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane 
 Sunny days came and I made it through the rain 
 Proclaimed I would attain till the day they know my motherfucking- 
 Came in the game with a brain, not a chain 
 Sunny days came and I made it through the rain 
 Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane 
 Proclaimed I would attain till the day they know my motherfucking name! 
 Spose: 
 I was the broseph looking toasted like a pop-tart 
 Slumming in a Sox hat, who turned in a pop star 
 Whoops! Kept a couple thousand in the sock drawer 
 Lit up like a cop car, smoked it all, bought more 
 Look pal, I've been preposterously dank, ridiculously dope 
 Maybe monstrously lame but meticulously flow, come and get a whiff of Spose 
 Smells like Wells, Maine, nights up in the cove 
 I'm not a fighter, just a writer, put the lighter to the bowl! 
 Always knew that it was do or die 
 I'm doing work while you're hanging like a suicide 
 I just Googled the meaning of annuitize 
 Which stupid guys' rhymes you bumped in lieu of mine?! 
 Who am I? Spose, motherfucker! 
 P. Dank to the top like a fat kid to supper 
 So tell your brother's mother, "Ain't shit changed" 
 Same since the fame, still, sexy as John McCain 
 Since I-

 Spose: 
 Fuck your Beamer, Benz, or Bentley 
 We'll be smashing in the fender, take a blender to your Fendi 
 Yelling obscenities in the mezzanine, P. Dank 
 Defenders of the peasantry, who surprised pleasantly 
 Guys who thought rap was crack, gats and Hennessy 
 So yeah, Bethany, you can put your ass away 
 Quick like Nestle, I acquired accolades 
 Stripes like a referee, I earned 'em 'cause I had to say 
 What I really had instead of brags 
 They're yelling, "No you're not, dude don't lie!" when I pass 
 7 million YouTube views in the bag 
 Cop had me stopped just to get my autograph 
 But they still don't respect me, I'm as sexy as a scab 
 You could grovel for the models, you could wallow for the cash 
 Fuck that, learn facts till you need a bigger hat 
 So, yeah, mane, we're not the same 
 If you're unbejewled then tell your mom, "P. Dank" 
 So we-

 Cam Groves: 
 You know it's Groves, the flow's so tight 
 Shout-out to Spose, man, I owe him my life 
 And I remember back when he told me, "Keep rappin' " 
 Look at all that happened since "John Madden" 
 In Salt Lake when he signed the deal 
 Then I packed up my bags, got behind the wheel 
 Hear my tires squeal, away we go 
 And on the way home, who's on the radio? 
 (Motherfucker, I'm awesome) 
 Welcome to the music life 
 With the Jet Blue flights and on the news at night 
 When it comes to picking cards, gotta choose 'em right 
 Because this music life is an amusement ride 
 Ever since a kid, yo, the flows were mean 
 Big dreams, whenever me and Spose convened 
 We were plotting on our way to expose the scene 
 And now we on the road, two shows a week 
 I would sit in the studio and roll that weed 
 And write to a beat till I go to sleep 
 It's the M to the A to the I-N-E 
 More pine trees further than that I can see, yeah 
 I'm that rap guy coming through your Cat-5 
 P. Dank baby, triple clap when we slap five 
 Remember back when rap was a pass time? 
 Now we pack heads every time we rap live 
 Late night writing down a song 
 Got the proudest mom when the crowd respond 
 And we trying to make it large, coming from a small town 
 P. Dank in the building until it falls down 
 Bitch
