Chorus: Spose 
 I heard an emcee this morning that made me wanna get in the booth 
 And no offense to him or his crew but I know that I'm better than that dude 
 So what I gotta do to get his spot in hip-hop and my video on MTV2 
 I know it can't be the skills cause mine have been ill since 2002 
 Verse 1: Spose 
 Too many Facebook rappers to unlike 
 This blank sheet of paper is the shit they've done right 
 Whilst Peter been beating the beat up repeatedly leaving the body in Peabody seemingly nobody noticed 
 I figured I'd take it and make it the focus 
 I'm the lord grand chancellor 
 Backwoods ramble 
 Rap career canceler, bumping Fiona Apple 
 I'm the weird beard grower 
 A ghost, a feared flower 
 A myth, a gift shower 
 I been sipping on a Snapple in the cypher 
 You can find me I'm the wildest geek 
 My assignment has been rhyming been aligned to the beat 
 My bud kind but I'm violent when I'm rhyming delete 
 All pretenders who enter cause my potential's elite 
 He's always stressing excellent when blessing a show 
 My investments are destined to double bubble and grow 
 So, yes, in the flesh, the man, the mess, Spose 
 Who can still flow fresher than dressers of clean clothes 
 Oh, you getting to know the name I came to spell 
 I'm underground yeah I came from Wells 
 So watch me play the bass line on a belt your favorite rapper just used so he could hang himself 
 "But it's all good, Spose!" No it ain't so swell 
 'Cause I'm back down to Earth like some angels fell 
 'Cause I popped up on the chart with some stained lapels 
 And then I disappeared faster than Dave Chappelle 
 Poof 
 Verse 2: Spose 
 I been struggling rhyming like weed made of iron that's how hard I've been grinding 
 Been neglecting assignments, dreaming of islands 
 But not recouping, beat looping with the droopiest eye lids 
 My ups and downs have both been critical 
 My free time is infinitesimal 
 Inside my ride, driving to the gig, whipping it, kicking it, ducking the piglets, fine rhymes kid 
 There must be a connect I can't find him yet 
 Don't want a private jet just rhyming checks 
 Hey you'll never find Ryan crying with the blues like sirens 
 Bro this is no sob story 
 Even though they're hating in their verses, I don't want sympathy this is a statement of purpose: 
 I will out work every motherfucker alive and those who don't fuck their moms, too 
 Yo, I got callouses that will amount to palaces 
 Analysis is cats is on my phallace, put 'em up 
 I sip McCallan talented vow to you no medallions, challenge it till paralysis, dude: put 'em up 
 If you're playing Call of Duty chilling watching television and you wonder why you're going under, shut the fuck up 
 But, if you never relent like you only loan 
 Things out once, then guess what: your day gon come 
 Ryan Seacrest: 
 Some people are saying that this guy might be the next big rap star, and he's a white dude from Maine. His real name is Ryan Peters but he goes by "Spose." We need him to work some hip-hop into Bangor
