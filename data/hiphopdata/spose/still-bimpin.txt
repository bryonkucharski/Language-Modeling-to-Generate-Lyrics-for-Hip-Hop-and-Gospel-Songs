Shut your fat face 
 I gotta blurt it in a verse because the twerps is throwing dirt up on my name 
 It's Peter Sparker, known to grip it 
 Quick to skip a parking ticket, double digit, if I get it up in Maine 
 I got jokes, I'm never funny with the written 
 Maybe you heard about it 
 Sunny disposition, with the urine clouded 
 You're Derrick Rose on the toilet, making bull crap 
 Handing me the mic is like the ball to a fullback 
 Already busted in, too late to pull back 
 Still got the itch like I been wearing a wool mask 
 P. Dank's the symbol to know 
 I got the nimblest flow under the Timberland cloak 
 You wanna roll with the evergreens? Better be dope 
 Think you can Park and catch Rec? Ha, Leslie Knope 
 I wanna kill every rapper ending lines with "yo" 
 Quick to flick a Humpty-Dumpty, leave him dripping with the yolk 
 And same with these cats ending raps with letters, B 
 That's like admitting that you think I'm better, G 
 You'll never be as def as me, you wanna end my reverie 
 They wanna catch me separately and take all of my recipes 
 They're yearning for my expertise and burning all my effigies 
 And lying to the referees and crying to the deputies 
 I'm thinking, "slow down, lady" 
 My rhymes dirty as the floor at the ho down, baby 
 My circle never sounds square any go-round, Amy 
 Each LP, I got the speech healthy 
 I'm doing magic tricks with the hand they dealt me 
 'Cause I take fan bases, I don't take selfies, still bimpin' 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 Now I give it to you peeps to peep, so check it out 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 He probably made it on the 303 
 Being true when dispensing my vocals 
 Got me the dude who invented bifocals 
 All up in my wallet, bumpin' Illadelph, ill as Hell 
 Clean bill of health, gorilla smell, still in Wells 
 I'd rather be smart than cool 
 Sippin' screwdrivers hammered out in Sanford but I'm far from tool 
 I'd rather be a good dad, than in the manure 
 In the sewer, evildoers, cheese-chasing with the hoodrats 
 So I'm raising my daughter 
 Her toes pruny in the bath as the raisins I bought her 
 Mics torn like Achilles, to pay the bill-ies 
 I went from blazing Phillies to raising Lilys, for really 
 But you know my steez 
 Watching Jeopardy while I smoke my trees 
 I met Mike Be in the year '03 
 And if I ran for president I bet he'd vote for me, I'm still bimpin' 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 Now I give it to you freaks to peep, so check it out 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 I bet he made it on the 303 
 I was wannabe who turned to an anomaly, my policy is always state facts 
 Because I'm the only me 
 So if I tell it how I smell it, never embellish, I could make great tracks 
 Man, look I came from nothing 
 So it's somethin' when I'm bumpin' Smashing Pumpkins when I'm ridin' on a jet 
 My etymology is 
 Kept the mic close as Ghostface to Wallabees and always broke a sweat 
 I stay repping for the Jeff who got the new subs in the old whip 
 Bumpin' Spose shit on his way to the brew pub 
 Rappers say they scoop nugs like Snoop does 
 And they'll inflict harm 'cause they got more arms than a group hug 
 But fuck that, I don't want the cool points 
 I just rock the show, get the money, smoke dual joints 
 But thinking that my rhymes aren't awesome? 
 That shit's forbidden like items at an auction 
 Because I grinded form the ground up 
 Back when hashtags wouldn't pound us 
 In this spit shit, I met more dicks than the town slut 
 Back when my bank account was zero, even if you round up 
 But, I kept grinding like teeth while asleep 
 Skipped the beach for the beats, no belief in defeat 
 All my peeps wanna sneak, wanna see Pete deceased 
 'Cause I'm on the road more than I'm in the streets 
 I'm still learning, incomplete in my dome 
 Repeatedly honed by two women I greet at my home 
 When I'm reading my poems, that's me in my zone 
 I got bars on the tongue like I'm eating my phone, I'm still bimpin' 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 Now I give it to you freaks to peep, so check it out 
 Still bimpin' in the year one three 
 It's Peter Sparker in the place to be 
 I got this beat from my man up in Waterville, his name's Mike Be 
 I'm sure he made it on the 303, with an NPC 
 (M-M-Mike-Mike Be) 
 What's my man? Mike Be (Mike Be) 
 What's his name? (Mike Be) 
 (Mike Be the beatboxer) 
 (Mike-Mike-Mike-Mike-Mike Be, Mike Be, Mike Be) 
 Shout out to the whole P. Dank 
 EA, Cam Groves, Lady E, Shane Reis, Doc Astro 
 O-O-O-O-Ock Cousteau, let it go, let it flow 
 S to the P to the O, known to rock the show and then get the dough 
 Piece in the Nissan whip 
 You got chicken nuggets, I'ma need a piece of that shit 
 Break me off some barbeque sauce, hard to get lost 
 When you get this GPS all up on the iPhone 
 Dope rhymes off of my dome 
 They wanna steal all of my poems 
 Why's that? 'Cause their poems suck 
 Hope somebody shoots their dome up, bloaw 
 Leave 'em looking like a donut 
 I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, don't kill people
