(Intro: The Right Now) 
 Nobody, nobody 
 (Verse 1: Spose) 
 I was nobody (nobody), nobody believed 
 Pregnant women couldn't even conceive 
 Man your aunt used to hate on my steez 
 Then she heard it, fell in love, and now your aunt's sorry like Aziz 
 I'm at the jubilee, let me know if you believe 
 I've awoken, they thought I was joking, wouldn't humor me 
 Man they used to laugh at him, thought that I was ludicrous 
 I don't mean the rapper, just the adjective, man can you imagine it? 
 Cause now I'm shining luminous, just look at who I grew to be 
 Accomplishments are numerous, been reppin' my community 
 It's something (it's something), how you can start from nothing 
 Then rock it from microscopic to the topic of discussion from the bottom 
 And then you touch the roof, that's like a tongue ring 
 Could change my name, still would get the W like tungsten 
 That's a science joke, I'm the broke, tie a rope around the dying goat to pull it out the lion's throat 
 Man look at Ryan go 
 The way I carry a mic, I'm gonna end up with some flowers on my burial site 
 I'm still moving, ascending on my aerial flight 
 Breaking every radio, smashing stereotypes 
 (Pre-Hook: Spose) 
 But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down 
 I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background 
 I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something 
 I knew I could do it, I will make it through it 
 I'll prove it, I was just another human who was supposed to be 
 (Hook: The Right Now & (Spose)) 
 Nobody, nobody 
 Been acting like nobody 
 (But I don't wanna be) 
 Nobody 
 (Verse 2: Spose) 
 Ayup 
 I wasn't born in a nativity, just in anonymity 
 So all the props they've given me, I've risen to divinity 
 He felt like Chris, and 'Jimmy!' made him feel good 
 Her whole perspective changed when she heard 'Knocking On Wood' 
 He got arrested in college, that shit was not planned 
 He was scurred, then he heard 'God Damn' 
 And played it, and played it, 'cause what I say, he related 
 I became his favorite, he made it out to my tour date, elated 
 Now he's up in the front going crazy 
 Word for word in my cadence 
 I told him "I was nobody, now I'm sold out on stages" 
 And that got me feeling six feet, but I couldn't fathom 
 That my words could be the light that lead the weary out the cavern 
 I'm still better than your verbals, I'm eating rappers like hors d'oerves 
 I'm Biggie but more Urkel 
 (What you doing?) 
 I'm rocking mics until I'm sore, purple 
 (And then what?) 
 And then I'm outtie like four circles 
 Dreamt of the brighter days, stuck to the battle plan 
 Weathered all the tidal waves, climbed through the avalanche 
 Hop up out the back of bands and then I make them clap their hands 
 Boy I'm feeling like the man 
 (Pre-Hook: Spose) 
 But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down 
 I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background 
 I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something 
 I knew I could do it, I will make it through it 
 I'll prove it, I was just another human who was supposed to be 
 (Hook: The Right Now & (Spose)) 
 Nobody, nobody 
 Been acting like nobody 
 (But I don't wanna be) 
 Nobody 
 (Verse 3: Watsky) 
 It takes smart choices and dumb luck 
 That's why there's billionaire dumbfucks 
 Geniuses driving dump trucks 
 Suckers with Lexuses, experts who won't make one buck 
 I'm seen dreams die fast and wither slow 
 I've also seen 'em blooming where they're not supposed to grow 
 And I've seen the ones I've planned and watched 'em blossom in the snow 
 Ask me if I'm dank? (Are you dank?) Preposterously so 
 Another day, gotta get up and go 
 Keep on plotting even when my body be begging me no 
 Could be a regular Joe, but I gotta keep a promise 
 That I made to myself over a decade ago 
 Gotta shot and almost spoiled it, no one's gonna foil it 
 I know I can toil, or flush this down the toilet 
 And that's why I try like Macy Gray 
 So I'ma keep trying till I'm grey 
 And emaciated, say what you wanna say you may see 
 I'm more than where you placed me 
 Whatever the case be, I'm singing in the rain 
 So you can bring the lobster, me and Spose will bring the pain 
 It's Watsky and the fucking King of Maine 
 (Pre-Hook: Spose) 
 But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down 
 I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background 
 I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something 
 I knew I could do it, I will make it through it 
 I'll prove it, I was just another human who was supposed to be 
 (Hook: The Right Now & (Spose)) 
 Nobody, nobody 
 Been acting like nobody 
 (But I don't wanna be) 
 Nobody 
 (Post-hook: Spose & (The Right Now)) 
 They told me (no) 
 Yesterday they told me (no) 
 Ayup 
 (Been acting like no, nobody, nobody)
