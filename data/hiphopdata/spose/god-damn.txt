The first time I got arrested 
 I was higher than the gas price 
 Five-Zero rolled with some flashlights, that's life 
 I was in cuffs laughing, laughing 
 Like, "Whatever homie, you know bullshit happens" 
 And I swore, man, that would be the last time 
 Crime can't become a pastime of mine, nah 
 But a month later cops busted through the locked door 
 And found a QP up in the sock drawer 
 And now I'm four charges deep, can't sleep 
 And you know plus, I ain't got laid in 3 weeks 
 Straight depressed, no checks 
 Mic cable round my neck, like I'll chill with the devil 
 What the heck, no sweat 
 I'm going mental and I'm chattering my dentals 
 Cause these teachers used to tell me I had so much potential 
 But now 
 Shut down 
 Smoker, alcoholic 
 Life's rotten, got me plottin' on droppin' up out of college 
 Deuce court dates in late May 
 Just great 
 Can't wait to get substantially financially raped 
 Man, I used to be invincible 
 Like, "fuck you" to the principle 
 But now I'm not sensible 
 God damn 
 God damn 
 Right when they cuff my hands 
 God damn 
 When I testify or take the stand 
 God damn 
 I seriously can't afford this, man 
 God damn 
 It's got me scheming on a master plan 
 So, yo, I rolled into court (When?) 
 Rooster o'clock in two different socks 
 Mad bitches with speeding tickets was kicking it 
 The courtroom was crickets 
 My heart's pounding like the bass in your Civic 
 And I'm tripping like, "please have mercy on my soul 
 I mean I only had a weed-filled bowl 
 Oh no" 
 Misdemeanors got my mom reaching for Kleenex 
 And I don't want my dad to know 
 So yo, it's like 
 God damn as they call me to the stand 
 And I entered the chamber like the Wu-Tang Clan 
 I plead my case but the judge barely budge 
 I've been trudged through the mud since I met my boy Drugs 
 I realize I've gotta Nip/Tuck my ways 
 I ain't Dave Chapelle 
 Rick James, rich bitch, hey 
 I gotta rearrange priorities and even more importantly and horribly 
 Ease off the Heinekens and forestry 
 Cause back when I had lights up on my sneakers 
 I was eager to be a leader with my voice up on the speakers 
 But now I'm losing confidence 
 A life no longer positive 
 I mean I wasn't conscious of the consequence 
 Bumming, I was like off the wall like paint chips 
 Not thinking, drinking, banging, endangering, and feeling anguish 
 Slipping as a convict 
 Tripping taking bong rips 
 And doing all the wrong shit, God damn 
 God damn 
 Right when they cuff my hands 
 God damn 
 When I testify or take the stand 
 God damn 
 I seriously can't afford this man 
 God damn 
 It's got me scheming on a master plan 
 So yo it's been two years now 
 I ain't completely stop 
 Weed-stinking, beer-drinking 
 I don't fuck with the cops, nah 
 I mellowed out 
 I'm more intelligent now 
 As apposed to the old Spose up in the felony crowd 
 It's like, fuck that 
 I cut back a lot, for sure 
 I'm hanging in there like nutsacks in boxer shorts 
 I'm not going to court 
 I'm still repping F-4s 
 Still Spizzy Spizzy Spose 
 Baby, catch me on tour 
 God damn
