Yo, this is a fat white kid 
 Crip walking through a Walmart eating a Twix 
 This is, his mom in the next aisle, neglecting him while sending a text 
 This is, a mirror to society 
 I've already seen the truth so you don't got to lie to me 
 This is the scull behind a smiley face 
 The dark side that we all try to hide away! 
 Join me as we open on a heavy set bride 
 As she cries on her wedding dress 
 Cheeks getting wet cause there's something she would never guess 
 Better yet 
 Zoom in on the brides made 
 She fucked the groom five ways in the brides drive way (no way) 
 Fast forward to the bride's suicide 
 I know a lot of sad adjectives and all of them apply 
 It's fucked up 
 Because she suffered then she dies 
 But for this woman it was tougher to be alive 
 If you rewind 
 You'll see that there were other issues 
 In her bedroom clutching on a chunk of tissues 
 At nine got touched by her uncle Mitchel 
 It's a cold world, darker than some pumpernickel 
 And I'm not tryin' to bum you out or make you sad 
 I just think somebody ought to state the facts 
 It's cool, they don't even hear half the raps 
 Working on their swag 
 Let me tell you buddy: 
 Yo, this is a fat white kid 
 Crip walking through a Walmart eating a Twix 
 This is, his mom in the next aisle, neglecting him while sending a text 
 This is, a mirror to society 
 I've already seen the truth so you don't got to lie to me 
 This is the scull behind a smiley face 
 The dark side that we all try to hide away! 
 The next scene opens in a parking lot 
 Outside an old motel 
 With the neon glowing as the rain drops fell 
 Both from the sky and the eyes 
 Of the passengers 
 Inside a ride 
 That arrived 
 The inhabitants 
 A mother and her 3 kids running 
 From a new husband who seemed to scream more than love 'em 
 Tonight, he said he'd burn the house down 
 Kicked in the cupboard 
 They slipped out the back undiscovered 
 She said they'd get a hotel room and pizza 
 Watch TV and take a breather 
 She went into lobby and returned sick 
 She'd left her purse at the crib 
 Hair matted to her face as the rain poured 
 Her kids huddled with her slithered to the back door 
 And I'm not kidding he was sitting in the kitchen, waiting to start hitting 
 This is, what she won't say when you ask, how's it going, the very next day 
 This is, her kids doing well in school even though at home life was hell 
 This is a mirror to society 
 I've already seen the truth, you don't got the lie to me 
 This is, the scull behind a smiley face, the dark side, that we all try to hide away
