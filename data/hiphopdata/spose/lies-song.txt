(Verse 1: Spose) 
 I'd never lie to you, there's no drums in this song 
 I'll spit my verses all in Spanish, I was born in Kansas 
 I'm the richest person on the planet 
 I would never get a tattoo 
 I'd never feed my daughter fast food 
 ("Any sauces with that?" "Uh, can I get three barbecue?") 
 Bobby Flay never wrote a recipe 
 Michelle Obama won't stop sexting me 
 Fat people look awesome in Spandex 
 Nobody's ever got killed by Aaron Hernandez 
 2Pac's alive, Smurfs are black 
 Witches are real, the Earth is flat 
 X: that's the number five in Roman Numerals 
 I've never used Twitter at a relative's funeral 
 My car has a retracting top, I'm always wearing matching socks 
 Janet Jackson's dead, but Michael Jackson's not 
 To take it further, there has never been a rape or murder in the state of Florida 
 And my basement doesn't look like it's an episode of Hoarders 
 I have never seen Dora The Explorer 
 I got all the deaf people listening, Augusta is the capital of Michigan 
 But I would never lie to you 
 (Hook: Spose) 
 I would never lie, lie, lie 
 Betty White is not old, ice is not cold 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook) 
 I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I'd never lie to you 
 (Verse 2: Wax) 
 Your wildest dreams are all easily attainable 
 And oil based infrastructure's endlessly sustainable 
 The people in charge are all anti-war 
 The economy's run by the disenfranchised poor 
 In high school the pants I wore were skin tight 
 A Mogwai is unaffected if you feed it after midnight 
 The best way to reach me is to send a Facebook invite 
 Not a single rhyme that I've written's ever been tight 
 I'm not a know-it-all, I always follow protocol 
 Never broke a law, last night I fucked Oprah raw 
 I don't enjoy red wine or cold Stella 
 Next year, I'm booked to headline at Coachella 
 I just paid off all my credit cards and student loans 
 Atop the Hollywood Hills, I own two big homes 
 Voting is important 
 It's really hard to find a strip club in Portland 
 (Hook: Spose) 
 I would never lie, lie, lie 
 Betty White is not old, ice is not cold 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook) 
 I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I'd never lie to you 
 (Verse 3: Spose) 
 Bentley logos on my car's exterior 
 Honey Nut Cheerios, that is not a cereal 
 Unicorn skin is my coat's material 
 It's safe to be a gay Jew in Syria 
 My name is not Spose 
 I am not dope 
 My bedroom floor is not covered with clothes 
 Your YouTube comments might stop me 
 I don't like iced coffee 
 You know my abs are solid 
 I never skipped a class in college 
 I didn't drop out of college just to sign a record deal 
 Just to get dropped ten months later, I'm known for my sex appeal 
 I hate when they're paying me, I could never make a beat 
 Bill Cosby: he doesn't seem rapisty 
 I'm a six-foot-five girl clearly 
 The Cubs always win the World Series 
 I won't eat it if that's bacon, I'm into castration 
 I hate big titties and ass shakin' 
 And when I'm late for my meeting and I get a speeding ticket 
 I'm always pumped like a gas station 
 My fans have never helped me 
 I've never took a selfie 
 Cigarettes are healthy 
 And you don't look like a dick with your sunglasses on inside 
 I would never lie to you 
 (Hook: Spose) 
 I would never lie, lie, lie 
 Betty White is not old, ice is not cold 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook) 
 I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I'd never lie to you 
 Shane Reis doesn't rap on this song 
 (Verse 4: Shane Reis) 
 I give a fuck about a top ten, I'm not raw 
 These guys have a lot of fans and most of them are not friends 
 I'm public with my personal 
 It doesn't bother me when people rhyme "hearse" with "verse" and then act versatile 
 I don't like being topped off, I hate convertibles 
 I'm comfortable everywhere I go, I'm not nervous still 
 I hate painkillers, I buy 'em all the time 'cause I can afford 'em and take 'em daily 'cause I don't know what's important 
 I don't smoke too many cigarettes 
 I don't think about not smoking while smoking, and keep smoking 
 I don't love John Mayer 
 I care if you like what I like 
 And I know that life is beyond fair 
 Oh yeah 
 I don't feel like this is our year 
 I won't but they will like a [?] 
 I'm so lazy 
 I waited to grow up, I have zero babies 
 I took handouts all of my life, I'm so shady 
 I love drama 
 My in-laws aren't from Haiti 
 They aren't from Haiti 
 I never wanted it 
 I never believed that I was the best, even when all of these other people were flaunting it 
 I go to dog parks with the leash on a leopard 
 It's not a guarantee putting me on the record 
 I never sat at Whole Foods while Sarah ate a salad 
 And I believe being profitable equals talent 
 (Hook: Spose) 
 I would never lie, lie, lie 
 Betty White is not old, ice is not cold 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook) 
 I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm 
 And I would never lie, lie, lie 
 I'd never lie to you 
 (Interlude: Spose) 
 There's no guitar in this song 
 I've never put guitar in a song 
 Guitar's wack 
 (Bridge: KGFREEZE and Dave Gutter) 
 Could you even imagine if I told you the truth? 
 Reality is gone, I'm just gonna front, I'm just gonna lie, lie, lie 
 Could you even imagine if I told you the truth? 
 Reality is gone, I'm just gonna front, I'm just gonna lie, lie, lie 
 The truth hurts
