If there really is a big fluffy Jesus in the clouds let him know right now that I take it all back 
 If there really is a muscular, cackling, red devil in the ground, you should tell him save me a shack 
 But since I never saw either at my local Walmart shopping yelling at their kids in front of my optics 
 I've been operating under the premise that neither existed because I base my beliefs in logic 
 But if it's really true would you say when my body is in the ground 
 I'll either float on up or drop right down 
 Then I'm nervous for the verdict 
 As a person I'm imperfect 
 I've been doing dirt lurking in the gutter with the vermin 
 I don't deserve to go north when I'm gone glim finished rivers swan shaped bongs 
 Some big tittied angels floating over ponds 
 Singing songs more soothing than bed, bath, and beyond 
 No, I deserve my skin scorched, skies made of skulls 
 Sasquatch is made of fire as I fall into a gulch everything black 
 I'd give my left nut and my dick for the chance to go back 
 You and I both know I can't shut my mouth 
 But before you blow my candle out 
 Would you please just listen to me here right now? 
 Before you blow my candle out 
 'Cause if I had a second time around, I would turn it all around 
 Man that's what they all say, you're done 
 No, no, no, no, shut the fuck up and listen for once 'cause I've been sitting on your shoulder 
 As you've grown colder 
 All of these years yelling in your ear 
 But you wouldn't hear 
 You had another plan, too big for little me 
 Let me put it in a rap simile 
 You'll understand, I gave you a fair shake 
 Kind of like a ferris wheel, during a earthquake 
 Get it? like you did it when you had it couldn't get it locked down 
 No don't bother with a frown 
 You were healthy in the mental 
 Potential with the pencil 
 Could've just filled in the stencil 
 But you're tempted by the devil 
 Content to just to settle get a bronze medal 
 You laid your picnic in the wrong meadow 
 Cause now you're trembling and mumbling defending what you've done to him you took the low road, there's a toll booth coming! and guess whose in the booth? man, not I 
 It's the one that the burglars are meeting when they die 
 And the murders and neighborhood circlers guy 
 It's not a piece of cake if you want a piece of the pie 
 So I'll have dinner with the winners 
 While you simmer with the sinners 
 Turn your summers into winters 
 What a bummer you can whimper 
 You could've been a star just a glimmer 
 Now let me blow your candle out and make it dimmer 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation we are gathered here today to celebrate the loss of a demon, Peter Sparker 
 And may he never live again a scourge on this earth may our children never repeat his mistakes (hallelujah) 
 And may he burn eternally 
 What do you want me to do? you fucking sorry excuse you dug your own hole lying and dude 
 No, no, no, that apology is cute 
 But all will be through 
 I'll blow your candle like the chances you blew 
 Yeah, you had some moments in the ratings 
 But then you'd always go skulking in the shade again 
 You disappointed your family shamed friends 
 I got a list heres the order of my list that it's in, it goes your daughter, your mother, your girl, your brother, jeff, cam, matt, your father, sister, and some others 
 So while you wither like Bill your little life will be forgotten while you're rotting wikipedia pages 
 They will be fading 
 While you're waiting 
 For a pardon from this run-on sentence unpunctuated arson while you stand there 
 Bare your closet full of skeletons dancing like the flames on your hair 
 Hey don't be like 'em all spose you're your own foes make this bed of coals you can go to sleep there 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation we are gathered here today to celebrate the loss of a demon, Peter Sparker 
 And may he never live again a scourge on this earth may our children never repeat his mistakes (hallelujah) 
 And may he burn eternally
