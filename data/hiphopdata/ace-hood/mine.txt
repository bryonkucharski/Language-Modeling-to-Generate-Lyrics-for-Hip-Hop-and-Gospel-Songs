Hey Hey Hey 
 The-Dream: 
 All we do is get money 
 Gotta hit the bank 
 Man I'm running out of hundreds 
 (Hey shawty hey hey hey hey shawty) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 Mine mine mine mine 
 Oh! She wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 Man she wanna be mine (mine mine mine) 
 (All I do is get money) (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 Ace hooooood (mine mine) 
 Ace Hood: 
 Big money talking if you broke stay quiet 
 And watch how all my niggas in a club make a riot 
 Throwing honeys in the sky 
 And watch it all fall 
 I'm blopping on your lady cause' she love to watch me ball 
 She be giving me the eye 
 I'm giving her a call 
 Then it's back to the suites 
 Next week the Taj mahal 
 Every day is like a sweet stick 
 Pick out what you want 
 It ain't trickin' if you got it baby 
 Pick out what you want 
 Reclimb your seat back 
 And let yourself go 
 You ain't a Mr. Berrada 
 I spit that cash flow 
 Now let her hands go 
 Lil homie you lame 
 I have her back to you tomorrow 
 I let my niggas say 
 Homie 
 (Chorus: The-Dream) 
 But she wanna be mine 
 Mine mine mine mine 
 Oh! She wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 Man she wanna be mine (mine mine mine) 
 (All I do is get money) (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine (mine mine) 
 The-Dream: 
 I got money you should help me spend 
 Take you out of that domestic and put you in a Benz 
 Your old boyfriend don't wanna pay your rent 
 I put five stacks only that ain't **** (that ain't ****) 
 Take you out the hood 
 Put you in the heels 
 Put you in a crib 
 This is how you should live 
 A girl like you should be sitting on a yacht 
 Looking down at ya rock 
 I know she yours! 
 (Chorus: The-Dream) 
 But she wanna be mine 
 Mine mine mine mine 
 Oh! She wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 Man she wanna be mine (mine mine mine) 
 (All I do is get money) (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 I I I I get white boy money (mine mine mine) 
 I know she yours 
 But she wanna be mine 
 (Ace hooooood) 
 Ace Hood:

 I'll be ballin like the Pistons 
 Master P money I'll be ballin with no limit 
 See ya lady I'm me she comin' to her senses 
 She can smell her money plus don't stuntin' on the sixty 
 Kickin with her richie

 I'm just tryin' to take you places you gon' need your sandles 
 Seein' is believin' I just hope that you can handle 
 Girl I make it rain you can determine the weather

 (Chorus: The-Dream)
