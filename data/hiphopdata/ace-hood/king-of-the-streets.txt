Yeah! Ooh! 
 They done tried to defeat me 
 Staying on my feet 
 When they see me they salute me 
 I'm the king of these streets 
 Yeah! Oh! 
 I got 'em walking on (left, right, left, right) 
 We the best so we marching like (left, right, left, right) 
 Ooh! They follow me! 
 Okay, it's blood, sweat, and tears, that be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 Never stop or giving up, the realest shit I ever quote 
 Look into my eyes and you can see I hustle twenty-fo, twenty-fo, twenty-fo 
 Hours grinding, overdose, running, running in the studio: recording animal 
 People want that gutter back, that's just who I do it for 
 Giving 'em that manure flow, how would I know, I'm trained to go 
 Heard them niggas dropping meat so fuck it hears a dick to blow 
 Now I'm on the top of shit, now they're showing sportsmanship 
 What it do and what it be? Niggas on some other shit 
 Bitch I'm on my own lane, only God can judge me 
 All you rappers rapping is equivalent to rare meat 
 And I am on my lion shit, starving like a full feast 
 Pussy niggas count me out, man I love to in-convene 
 Teddy P and Mr. Hood, you can call it history 
 We the best and fuck 'em all, we winning like we Charlie Sheen! 
 Yeah! Ooh! 
 They done tried to defeat me 
 Staying on my feet 
 When they see me they salute me 
 I'm the king of these streets 
 Yeah! Oh! 
 I got 'em walking on (left, right, left, right) 
 We the best so we marching like (left, right, left, right) 
 Ooh! They follow me! 
 Well it's the highly underrated, album so anticipated 
 Mr. Not Intimidated by you suckers perpetrating 
 I been waiting, yeah boy I been waiting 
 Heavy, humble and patient, but still embedded with greatness 
 I'm a mother fucking problem, y'all still in pajamas 
 Sleeping on the hottest while I'm out here chasing commas 
 Put that on my momma, I'mma give 'em hell while they locked up in a cell 
 We the Best is gon' prevail, don't believe in seeing fail 
 I'm conceited, you can tell, look the devil in the eye, say I'm hotter than your hell 
 And I'm rocking with my chest out, head high, hello to the bad guy 
 Bitch it's my time, see the diamonds in the watch now 
 Don't want any handouts, fuck you niggas talking 'bout? 
 See me, you salute me like a mother fucking drill scout 
 Stunting on you niggas, watch the Beamer when it pulls out 
 King of these streets, come and see me when you travel south 
 Yeah! Ooh! 
 They done tried to defeat me 
 Staying on my feet 
 When they see me they salute me 
 I'm the king of these streets 
 Yeah! Oh! 
 I got 'em walking on (left, right, left, right) 
 We the best so we marching like (left, right, left, right) 
 Ooh! They follow me!
