(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Well all right now 
 Real niggas minimizing 
 Free Weezy 
 Free Boosie 
 Mister Hood 
 (Chorus - Tyga) 
 Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on 
 Counting cash every morning before I leave home 
 Family I love, don't want to leave this world alone 
 So before I leave home 
 I pray to God I won't, loyalty is all I know 
 Before I leave home 
 I pray to God I won't, loyalty is all I know 
 Before I leave home 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Real recognize, real every time 
 This what I emphasize, got to keep them type of guys 
 Working out the fake, this what I exercise 
 Exterminate the hate, got rid of them pesticides 
 Loyalty and pride, too many niggas died 
 Snitches still alive, so tell me what's the odds 
 See I'm a fucking rider, I'm telling the FEDS nada 
 Run in front of the judge I'ma, tell him I don't know your honor 
 Loyalty's a stain, tatted in my veins 
 Family and love, I hope you say the same 
 Pistol when I ride, only friend of mine 
 Money never sleeps, Michael Douglas, I'm 
 (Outro - Ace Hood) 
 Mister Hood 
 Salute you real niggas 
 Snitching is at it's all time high 
 Hold your head nigga! 
 Boosie hold your head nigga! 
 Weezy nigga 
 Much love my nigga
