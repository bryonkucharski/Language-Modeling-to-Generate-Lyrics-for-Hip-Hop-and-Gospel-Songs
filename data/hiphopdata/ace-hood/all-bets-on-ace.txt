As I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death 
 I tell 'em I should fear no man so where my enemy at? 
 I'm movin' dat Phantom wit' cannons 
 See the curtains is black 
 I murder you niggas for certain and I be in and be back 
 Like an Energizer bunny I keep it goin' in fact 
 Hop on any track and demolish 
 Don't you bother wit' that 
 'Cause that bitch who bother 
 Me them hollows out the Tahoe 
 We be poppin' like it's bottles 
 Chop you up like a sarodo in fact 
 I get on any shit and rip it peep my energy pack 
 Just name any nigga dat want wit' me riddle me that 
 Riddle me this, if I don't rip you consider me wack 
 I'm on top of the fuckin' game so y'all do better than dat 
 But I think dey runnin' late dey takin' breaks 
 Before you think or even blink I be off up in yo' place 
 Put dat heater to yo' face 
 And tell you lead me to the safe 
 Don't cooperate dat caution tape will cover up yo' place 
 This is All Bets nigga on that muthafuckin' Ace 
 That is I greedy guy, run up in and take yo' pies 
 If you niggas wonder why, look it's in my fuckin' eyes 
 Never wonder what's in mind, give you just a bit of time 
 I'm starvin' you fuck niggas out of yo' mind 
 Fuck yo' problems, fuck yo' momma 
 Fuck yo' baby momma drama, fuck yo' sista 
 Fuck yo' daughter, when you fuckin' wit' the Devil 
 We are rebels 
 Hear the tremble when you walk over them pebbles 
 Wear them guns like it's a medal bitch 
 I heavy metal handle grip, word shop like it's a sander 
 I'm 100 and loaded like a muthafuckin' Rambo 
 Make you scramble from this ammo 
 That I put off in this hammer, bitch it's hammer time 
 You asinine, I'm mastermind 
 And half the time I'm over time 
 And after mine there will be none 
 If there's some they runnin' from me half the time 
 Yes I am a problem I be wildin' 
 I be smilin' while I'm askin' for yo' wallet 
 What you drivin'? Give me diamonds 
 Ask yo' lady she desire me 'cause I'm fly as any pilot 
 Quitted college just to follow me the sight 
 See on an island, I am G-U-T-T-A put this bass up in yo' face 
 Until you feel the b-b-b-b-bass from this K-K-K-K-K 
 I am runnin' in yo' place it is I 
 Yes Ace Mister H-Double O-D 
 Mister get you when you sleep 
 Mister see me in the street 
 Bitch I'm a muthafuckin' beast, I never sleep 
 I just go eat 
 And if I hear of any beef, and then I want a lil' piece 
 Just let me get a lil' piece 
 I walk yo' block and hit yo' street like I'm a muthafuckin' G 
 A matter fact I am a G, and you a P-U-S-S-Y 
 All you niggas said I couldn't, and I told you to yo' eyes 
 And bitch I'm on some murder mind 
 And bitch I'm on some other grind 
 You can't compare me to yo' kind 
 Just listen up and wonder why 
 Yes I am blind to you niggas rappin' wit' no passion 
 Can't imagine, ever yappin' 
 I be rappin', spittin' magic, let you have it 
 Now let me breath and let me free you some satisfaction 
 October 14th, Gutta 
 Like I told you niggas befo' 
 See I be in and be back 
 I'm like an Energizer bunny wit' no energy pack 
 Fuck lettin' you niggas go breath, you can swallow the track 
 Or you can swallow all them hollows that insert to the gat 
 And see I gave, won't fold now I'm back in yo' chest 
 It's all bets on the next nigga show me yo' best 
 And next time I come around have that check and da cash 
 Just tell dem niggas Khaled they should put it all on yo' man 
 Yeah, put it all on yo' man 
 October 14th I'm takin' all bets in advance 
 Gutta
