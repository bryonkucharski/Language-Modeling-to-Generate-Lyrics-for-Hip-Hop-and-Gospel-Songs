(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Okay 
 Camera man we going to do like the thirty six frame, you heard me? 
 It's movie time homie 
 Mister Hood 
 (Chorus - Joe Boom) 
 I jump up out the Bent', I'm stepping outside 
 There's cameras everywhere 
 Yeah I'm about to go live 
 Louis V. shades, to cover my eyes 
 The paparazzi flashing, I'm about to go live 
 About to go live, live, live 
 About to go live, live, live 
 You want to be fly? I'm on a G5 
 And everybody broke, ask me worldwide 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay, hello to the money, good morning to the bread 
 What up to you bitches? Bring me breakfast in the bed 
 Hit a button on the blinds, watch the curtains roll back 
 Took a look into the mirror, they not fucking wore of that 
 Better cut it up a notch, put more diamonds on my chest 
 Bigger stones in my ears, hundred carats in the Lex' 
 Put more horses in the 'Rari, nasty as calamari 
 Rolling out with a Barbie, hiding from paparazzi 
 Tell them I'm going live, Mister Life-of-the-Party 
 Keep my jewels in the cooler, maybe I know the mula 
 Pull up in something European so they can flash 
 In three, two, one, I'm going live on that ass 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 Now tell them tune in, I'm back at it again 
 Want to be fly like I grew up in the wind 
 I'm a bad motherfucker, arrogant as I could be 
 Fresh up out of Louis, have them wishing they was me 
 I'm sorry that you not, I'm way too fucking hot 
 And everywhere I go you better know I'm showing out 
 Got my diamonds on check, carry cash no checks 
 Want that Beamer not the Lex', now you know I'm finna flex 
 It go three, two, one, you either ready or you not 
 Make it feel like Hollywood, every time I'm stepping out 
 Custom cameras over here, and you know they over there 
 Bad bitches in my bed, smell the money in the air
