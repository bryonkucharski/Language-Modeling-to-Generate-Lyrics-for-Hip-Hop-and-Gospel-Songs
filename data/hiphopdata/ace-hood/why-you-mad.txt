(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Mister Hood 
 Well all right 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Now little nigga I'm big shit 
 Big whips on two six 
 Fault niggas, I don't deal with them 
 Them real niggas going to feel this 
 Fuck niggas that talk a lot 
 Fuck niggas that talking back 
 Other niggas that ain't around 
 But they quick to jump on your jock 
 See Carter niggas I chill with 
 Known for toting them big clips 
 Run your mouth, you're too long around 
 These niggas hitting that kill switch 
 See money what I been about 
 Fuck bitches, no handouts 
 Do this shit with my pen down 
 Guarantee that I tear down 
 See that's all that they get from me 
 Bubble gum in this bag of lean 
 Bouncing up on that trampoline 
 Riding off in that tangerine 
 About the cost of my pinky ring 
 Feet draped in that Louis V. 
 Duffle bag when I'm over seas 
 Get a flick when you see a G 
 Nigga diamonds all on my neck and wrist 
 Fuck a nigga that's hating me 
 Hottest nigga you know about it 
 Never needed no gasoline 
 Nigga fly, nigga I been this 
 Swag off the hinges 
 Don't believe my word of mouth 
 Just go and ask them bitches 
 (Chorus - Ace Hood) 
 Now why you mad? 
 I'm getting bands 
 I got a chauffeur homie, you in the van 
 I hear them hating holmes, I understand 
 Now watch me ball, stay in the stands 
 Now why you mad? 
 Why you mad? 
 Why you mad? 
 Why you mad? 
 Now why you mad? 
 Why you mad? 
 They say I'm arrogant 
 That's why you mad? 
 (Verse 2 - Gucci Mane) 
 They hostile like a little child 
 They fragile, I'm agile 
 I'm too cold, let me tell you something 
 Nigga stop all because I'm iced out 
 Hold up, Chris find this 
 Your highness, I'm shining 
 Got a gold touch like Midas 
 My rock be the tightest 
 You want to bite me 
 Probably want to fight me 
 I woke up in an igloo 
 I'm always be icy 
 Strapped up like Birdman, and Lil Wayne, and Mack Maine 
 I'm Gucci Mane, I'm off the chain 
 I have no go license 
 Cigarette in my Lambo' 
 Man in my Ferrari 
 Call it Fast and Furious 
 They furious, I'm sorry 
 Curious, she choosing 
 Looking at my pockets 
 Mine full of them hundreds 
 Baby it's no problem 
 It's Gucci
