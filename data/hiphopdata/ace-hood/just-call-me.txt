Ace Hood: 
 So baby hollah at a G 
 I keep you away from prankstaz 
 You can be my mistress, I can be ya gangsta 
 Seen you on the money rockin' bring me back the paper 
 Give you back half just for doin' me dat favor 
 And yeah dats a thug's move 
 Show you what a thug do 
 Beat it while I feed it to you good like soulfood 
 Forget about old dude, call him Mr.used too 
 I can put it down like the top of my new Coop 
 Baby dats roofless 
 Tell ya what the truth is 
 Niggahz can't hit it right 
 Den baby he useless 
 I'm a yung thug, give it to you with my Chews on, 
 Shoes on, just incase a yungin gotta move on 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 When at home all alone at night 
 Cause dat otha niggah ain't lovin' you rite

 And no worries baby it's all good

 Ace Hood: 
 And though he bought you dat watch 
 Ya man ain't nothin' 
 So hollah at a G if you need some thug lovin' 
 Late nites on a call say she wanna feel sumum 
 She tell me put it down

 I give her refunds and her body keeps cummin 
 She know I put it down baby girl stop runnin' 
 So what you wanna do 'cause I'm yung and still thuggin' 
 Jus take this good while I'm headed to the money 
 Takin' shots of the goose just to mix with gettin' blunted 
 See I can brighten days keep ya wrists all studded 
 Ya boyfriends' lame tell'em Guttah get money

 Ace Hood: 
 And baby I can show you new things 
 Sumum you ain't used to 
 Kick it with the guttah none otha you need a thug dude 
 Type of niggah beat it in his jeanz and his Tim boots 
 Hit it from the back, see you feelin' like fruit juice 
 Fitted to the back, see he can eat what ya man do 
 Ain't doin' his job, you can hit me on the hip boo 
 Ace 
 You know the name 
 A real niggah 
 Heavy off in the streets, see ya man, I'm a deal with him 
 Baby he play it lock like the Tommy The Hilfiger 
 Call me ya boss boy or just call me ya deal giver 
 Heard you needed a thug so there go ya meal ticket 
 Baby girl don't worry I'm dat hurry and get it like

 You spendin money on dat buddy ain't hood 
 And no worries baby it's all good 
 Jus call me
