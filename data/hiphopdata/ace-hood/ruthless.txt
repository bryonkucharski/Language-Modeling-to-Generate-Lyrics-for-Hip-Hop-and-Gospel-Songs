(Kanye West (Ace Hood)) 
 In the night I hear him talk 
 The coldest story ever told 
 (I'm going all the way in on this one right here boy) 
 Somewhere far along this road 
 (Yeah, Gutta) 
 He lost his soul 
 (Ace Hood) 
 To a nigga so ruthless 
 How could you be so ruthless? 
 (What up Kanye?) 
 How could you be so ruthless? 
 Well in the mind of a gangster 
 Bitch nigga man up 
 You can play the pussy and get fucked up with this handgun 
 Laugh at a nigga ass, blast at his loved ones 
 Sister, brother, motherfuck them, even get his grandson 
 Bad talking real niggas, this is what can happen 
 B-b-blast at his ass, plexiglass smashing 
 Skully mags, body bag, after that trash them 
 Donald Duck sucker, Taz dragon a Magnum 
 Swag with a stallion 
 Puerto Rican, Italian 
 Love fly niggas so come kick it with the Jet Blue 
 First class ass beat it like an 808 do 
 Pussy whack in the trash like some paper plate food 
 Strictly on that Rosay, you can keep the Grey Goose 
 Steal it from me bitch, get cut hoe take two 
 Ha, and I'll be back with some great news 
 I'll send a jet to pick the best in a swim suit 
 And I'm the best but you never seen it in clear view 
 These hoes pay me they late when the rent due 
 I split them open like the cocktail shrimp food 
 Ace Hood, Mister-Buy-Never-Rental 
 I am the future so pussy nigga who you? 
 Sweetened ass niggas turn you into Froot Loops 
 Bleed motherfucker blood like suuwoo 
 Red pill or the blue nigga you choose 
 I'm the game eat you rappers like Seoul food 
 Making bad moves send your momma bad news 
 Grind hard everyday what a thug do 
 And I'm heartless, nigga, you knew 
 (Kanye West) 
 In the night I hear him talk 
 The coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road 
 He lost his soul 
 (Ace Hood) 
 To a nigga so ruthless 
 How could yoi be so ruthless? 
 How could you be so ruthless?
