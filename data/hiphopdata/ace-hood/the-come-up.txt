This is a come up 
 Grinding for the ones that I love 
 Fueled by the passion and pain 
 And all the bullshit I've been through 
 Still I hold my head up high 
 And all them roadblocks I walk right through 
 I do it for the ones like me 
 And all people who's just like you 
 No matter what they say about me 
 I'm a do whatever I gotta do 
 This is the come up 
 Where niggas hustle from night to sun up 
 The gutta, where niggas run up and they get done up 
 And mama tryna make a dollar for son and daughter 
 Where them times are even harder without a father 
 Want a job but never bother 
 All about them commas, bigger diamonds and high designer 
 With all the finest women, goddess 
 With perfect bodies that we admire 
 This is the come up where niggas do whatever for money 
 They'll murk a nigga now and got to church on a Sunday 
 Probably snitch on homeboys and take a flight out of country 
 It's fucked up, the motive is to get out the hood 
 Get your mama new crib, keep your family good 
 When that money is pouring and them jewels is shining 
 And them cars are foreigns, them haters praying it storm 
 It's no love, it ain't a place for the weak 
 Only strong survive, only hustlers ride 
 This is the come up 
 This is a come up 
 Grinding for the ones that I love 
 Where niggas hustle from night to sun up 
 And dreams are never seemed couldn't believe 
 And it seems you can achieve by any means go and get it 
 Anything you vision and anything you wishing you can live it 
 Just bare the witness they said I wouldn't and I did it 
 What God intended from being label as a menace 
 To counting millions my daughter smiling every minute 
 I'm an a attendance oh lord I got my deal in the field 
 Crying hundred of tears feeling like that doughboy hit a lick for a meal 
 Riding round with that work know them weapons concealed 
 If them feds ever catch 'em leave them for 200 hundred years for that dope 
 And I know money come money go in the fame in the game 
 All the hate that it brings many lost some gave never changed not me 
 Gotta survive everyday know every morning I wake 
 I'm tryna come up 
 This is a come up 
 Grinding for the ones that I love 
 This is the come up 
 So, don't you dare give up? 
 Keep your head above the clouds 
 And your eyes on the price 
 Don't you dare give up? 
 This is for the grind 
 This is a come up 
 Grinding for the ones that I love 
 This is the come up 
 One day you gon make it out struggle 
 Don't you worried now? 
 My brothers and my sisters, mama too 
 This is the come up
