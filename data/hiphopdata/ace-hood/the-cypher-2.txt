Part two! Ha-ha 
 Okay, no one on the corner have swagger like me 
 Because I'm so incredible, they not compatible to me 
 Used to hustle on the B, now I'm onto better things 
 Sitting closer to the ring, watch Mayweather swing 
 Nigga hold up, yeah I got my dough up 
 Thinking I'm the shit in the whip doing donuts 
 Yeah nigga sho nuff, put me in a jungle 
 Ball like a dog got them looking for a fumble 
 Cocky with the flow, more dough, still humble 
 Biting nigga's head in the middle of a scuffle 
 I ain't with the talking, tussle, homie get muscle 
 Fifteen shots in his leg and his upper 
 Body bag duffle, the wolves get a supper 
 Lord's my chef, but you roll with the leopards 
 Spot y'all fake in the dark of the shelter 
 Nigga I'm a tiger, rolling with the bears 
 My own, my where's Gunter with the heels? 
 Say you spent twenty on a watch? Who cares?! 
 Drop thirty more just to make a bitch stare 
 And added me the chain just to make her give brain 
 And all way high, but I'm going insane 
 Paid in full, only way to clear your name 
 And y'all know me, I ain't lying I'm fly 
 Twenty six inch on my rims and tires 
 Must be the shit, look at all these flies 
 Lord to the God, and I still pay ties 
 That's random, way too hot to handle 
 Catch me on a beach with my Louis V. sandals 
 Rocking me a chain, got to shine like a chandelier 
 I appear with them hoes by camera 
 Rolling with a bitch that's super thick up out Atlanta 
 Mister Do-It-Better-Than-You-Ever 
 While I'm sticking to the cheddar in a cashmere sweater 
 Looking fly as the propellers what you on 
 Tell them get they game up 
 Deuces up high, man I'm out for the change up 
 Nigga, nigga
