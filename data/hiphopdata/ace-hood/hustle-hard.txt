(Ace Hood) 
 (Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle) 
 Same old shit, just a different day 
 Out here tryna get it, each and every way 
 Momma need a house 
 Baby need some shoes 
 Times are getting hard 
 Guess what I'mma do 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard 
 Big bank in my pocket 
 Double up with my profit 
 See this shit than I cop it 
 Gimme that there and than drop it 
 Homie, hold up with my mojo 
 Peep the whip and the logo 
 24's and they low pro 
 I bet she fucking, I know so 
 Nigga ain't no doubt about it 
 Riding round with that rocket 
 Load it up and I cock it 
 Send 'bout a couple off in your nog 
 And hear them 808's and they knocking 
 Whole club and they rocking 
 Rose in them buckets 
 All my homies up in here vibing 
 Nigga big shit in my household 
 Real niggas I die for 
 Creeping off in that Tahoe 
 All about that? 
 Nigga don't stop the party 
 We be getting gnarley 
 Old kimosabe homie's chiefing 'cause I'm Marley 
 This is the same old shit 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 I think I'm from Kingston, Jamaica homes 
 'Cause I got 10 jah and 10 om's 
 I don't leave the crib without my chrome 
 I keep blowing up, like my mobile phone 
 Them L red bottoms, I designed 'em homes 
 I spiked them whole damn shoe for you assholes 
 I used to stunt my black card for my new broads 
 Now I just whip the four-door, oh my gosh 
 The ? Aston, I did that too 
 Wait till we come with Matt reds and Matt Blues 
 I'm an empire, you a little boy 
 Got a Lamborghini, that's my son's toy 
 Where the flip did I get that paper 
 Shades on I can't see you haters 
 Taking off when I see you later 
 I-I-I hustle paper 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Okay now, all I know is hustle 
 Get it off the muscle 
 Block is my attire 
 Keep them sticks off in that cupboard nigga 
 I be going hard, bitch I'm going hard 
 I just hit the mall 
 You just swipe the card 
 I'm with a couple latin broads 
 I just do menage 
 Fuck you other guys 
 Pussy telling lies 
 Homie, free my nigga AG 
 Fuck you niggas pay me 
 Swagging in my saline 
 Two door coupe Mercedes 
 I am too much for you buster's 
 Bitches I don't trust em 
 Fuck 'em once, I fuck em 
 Lust 'em never love em 
 They won't play me for no sucker, play me for no paper 
 Make my bitches stomp her 
 Alpha zeta mega, better no one really on it 
 Drive it, bet I own it 
 Money is involved, bet I know I'm on it 
 That's wording to my mother 
 Gotta get it one way or another 
 I put that on my brother 
 I'm out here on the come up
