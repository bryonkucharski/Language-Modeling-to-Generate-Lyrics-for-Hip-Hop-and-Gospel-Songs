Mister Hood 
 Real nigga shit, fuck niggas 
 Truth be told, I don't fuck with them 
 Money my concern 
 Hating is a germ 
 Say she never did, well she finna learn 
 I got plenty hoes, all of them dyke 
 Pick and choose nigga, all of them right 
 Never had shit, now my money burn 
 Ever made a mill'? Well you finna learn 
 Heard you niggas mad 
 Wish I'm doing bad 
 I just bought a Benz 
 Talking paper tags 
 Leave your girl around 
 I bet I'm fucking that 
 She coming with me 
 That's why you really mad 
 Get that ass into that Jeep 
 Bet all that she freaky 
 You must be crazy hoe 
 No money out of me 
 She give me pussy free 
 Proud to be fucking me 
 I slide that rubber on 
 Just know it's going deep 
 Beat that pussy down 
 Keep repeating sounds 
 I step on the mound 
 Knock that pussy out 
 That's just what I do 
 Bitch I'm on the loose 
 Coconuts a rock 
 Pineapple juice 
 Now that's coco low 
 I am no loco Joe 
 You niggas such a joke 
 See me I'm counting dough 
 That's all I fucking do, and all I fucking know 
 I hear them haters mad 
 One thing that you should know 
 So crank it up a notch 
 Booming out the box 
 Candy coated drop 
 Bouncing with my knots 
 Boy this nigga fly 
 Twenty six a tie 
 Broward County boy 
 Come and see me now 
 I might buy a house, with a fucking pool 
 Bring a bitch for fun 
 That's just what I do 
 Tell them bring the hate 
 I might buy a coupe 
 Now why you mad? Because I'm stunting and you never do 
 Get your money lame 
 I can show you things 
 Big shit nigga 
 Fifty carat rings 
 Holy molly flow 
 Catch the Holy Ghost 
 Mister Snatch-Them-All 
 Tell them it's time to go 
 Now that's some gutter shit 
 I'm on some other shit 
 Mister Hood boy 
 That's who you fucking with 
 So put your hate away 
 I'm about getting paid 
 And if he say he not 
 I bet that nigga gay
