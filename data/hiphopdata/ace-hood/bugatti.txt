We the motherfuckin' best 
 Ace Hood 
 Super, Future 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money, they started hating 
 (Turn up) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 Okay, niggas be hatin', I'm rich as a bitch 
 One hundred K, I spent that on my wrist 
 Two hundred dollars, spent that on your bitch 
 Do me a model, put that on my list 
 Oh, there he go in that foreign again 
 Killin' the scene, bring the coroner in 
 Murder she wrote, swallow or choke 
 Hit her and go home, won't call her again 
 Woke up early morning 
 Crib as big as a college 
 Smoke me a pound of the loudest 
 Whippin' some shit with no mileage 
 Diamonds cost me a fortune 
 Them horses all in them Porsches 
 You pussies can't hardly afford it 
 Forty-two hundred my mortgage 
 Ballin' on niggas like Kobe 
 Fuck all you haters, you bore me 
 Only the real get a piece of the plate 
 Reppin' my city, I'm runnin' my state 
 Give me a pistol then run with the K's 
 Niggas want beef then I visit ya place, bang 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating

 I woke up in a new Bugatti

 Yeah, and I'm at it again 
 There go that flow, bringin' tragedy in 
 Copped me a chain, your salary spent 
 Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in 
 Countin' money, hourly trend 
 Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins 
 Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz 
 Neck full of Gold Olympian shit 
 Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear 
 Fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear 
 Strapped with them choppers, back of the rear 
 Sak pasé, them killers is here 
 Woke up early this morning 
 Mind is tellin' me money 
 Paper, mula 
 Pockets is fat as a tumor 
 Millionaire nigga no rumor 
 Livin' my life off of tuna 
 Wanted with me I deliver the beef 
 Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast 
 Pull up a seat, bon appétit 
 No Louboutins put that red on your sneaks, bang 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating

 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 Photographs of dope boys is all they taking 
 Fingerprints on the Rolls Royce is why they hatin' 
 Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation 
 Walk the road to riches bare feet 
 I watch mama struggle, now she livin' carefree 
 That's why I hustle for that half a key, that's twelve G's 
 I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP 
 You gotta love me, I got shooters out the D-League 
 Signin' bonus hit that man, that's from thirty feet 
 Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill 
 And what it is? 
 Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella trill, yeah 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 (What you know about this?) 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican

 You get money they started hating
