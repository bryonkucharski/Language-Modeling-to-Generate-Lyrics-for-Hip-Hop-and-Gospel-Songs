I don't even care no more 
 That's my word, that's for sure 
 I don't even cry no more 
 That's absurd, I'm so cured 
 I'm so secure with who I is, oops, who I am 
 And I'm a champion for sure boy 
 I'm a champ, oh yes, I am 
 But what I thought about 
 When those people put me down 
 They can laugh for now 
 But watch it when I turn this thing around 
 I know, I believe 
 Ain't nobody gonna do it but me 
 I'm fly, no lie 
 I'm the truth baby, ask me why 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 A champion 
 What you say don't stick 
 I'm the best and I know it 
 I know you tried to bring me down 
 Look at me now, watch my smile 
 I'm so secure with who I am 
 And I'm a champion for sure 
 I'm a champ oh yes, I am 
 But what I thought about 
 When those people put me down 
 They can laugh for now 
 But watch it when I turn this thing around 
 I know, I believe 
 Ain't nobody gonna do it but me 
 I'm fly, no lie 
 I'm the truth baby, ask me why 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 A champion 
 Keep your head up 
 They hatin' cause you majored in minor 
 Gonna celebrate like you won the finals 
 Hold your trophy up in your parade in your honor 
 And pour some champagne and put your glass to the sky 
 'Cause you a champion, you're a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 A champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 I'm a champion, I'm a champion 
 Champion
