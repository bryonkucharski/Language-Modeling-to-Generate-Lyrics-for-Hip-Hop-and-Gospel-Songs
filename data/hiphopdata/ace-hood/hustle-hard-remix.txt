(Chorus - Ace Hood) 
 Same old shit, just a different day 
 Out here trying to get it, each and every way 
 Momma need a house 
 Baby need some shoes 
 Times are getting hard 
 Guess what I'ma do 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
 Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay, I'm booked out until August 
 Show money deposits 
 See the shit then I cop it 
 Got but a house note in my pocket 
 I'm on South Beach with that top off 
 Bad bitch and her ass soft 
 Something out of that catalogue 
 She introduced to that lock jaw 
 And I think her name was Lisa 
 Or maybe it was Sheila 
 My chevy sitting too high

 And I'm all about them Ben Franklins 
 Ain't talking Aretha

 And I'm still feeling my pockets 
 Big bass and it's knocking

 Got a bad bitch who be bartending 
 Couple homies that gang bang
