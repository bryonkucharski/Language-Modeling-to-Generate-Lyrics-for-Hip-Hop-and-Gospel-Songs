Ace Hood 
 Street certified 
 Let me tell you one thing 
 Don't get caught slipping out here on these streets homeboy 
 Keep your eyes and ears open, you understand? 
 Because it might go down 
 When the traps side up and the MAC slow down 
 You better hit the deck because it might go down 
 Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down 
 Don't get caught slipping, because it might go down 
 Keep an eye on your nigga, and running around town 
 Yeah this little boy telling so it might go down 
 Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down 
 Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down 
 Young nigga seventeen, trying to get money 
 Niggas laugh about the dough but really ain't shit funny 
 Just watch who you serve with them birds little buddy 
 Every fiend ain't a fiend if you see them look funny 
 You better tell your team, you don't need that money 
 That shit smell funny, you ain't getting shit from me 
 I stacked a couple hundred fiends on these something 
 That white keep coming, tell the boy to keep bumping 
 Well watch these folks keeping enemies close 
 And any nigga kin to me they better not fold 
 He say that he a friend to me but snitching to the po' 
 He pointing on the court, tell the judge what he know 
 Price on his head, he be dead by four, so homie don't slip 
 Or you could be him, no speaking on the phone 
 Because them FEDS get tips, don't get caught slipping 
 Because it might be them 
 And I won't be slipping, the boy's on a mission 
 Only vision of winning and my sight is on a million 
 Serving that white girl to any nigga want to get it 
 And fresh Louis linen dawg can call that pimping 
 That thing on my side, homeboy I ain't slipping 
 Your boy's off snitching, tell them niggas ain't with it 
 It might go down, so watch you do a round 
 Niggas creep in the town leave bodies left on the ground 
 (Don't get caught slipping) 
 Because the chopper get down 
 I stay in all black with a Florida Marlin crown 
 So keep away the faking ain't a real nigga around 
 If you ever go down stay loyal to your fam' 
 And you don't know shit, never snitching on the mound 
 And homie don't slip, because it might go down 
 Yeah homie don't slip, it might go down 
 And homie don't slip, because it might go down 
 And I run my city, I own my town 
 Can't another man come and disrespect my grounds 
 You eyeing my nigga, you want something with him? 
 You want to come get it, you'll be dodging my missiles 
 Yeah boy it went down, your homie done slipped 
 And now he in a coffin on a first class trip 
 Yeah boy it went down, your homie done slipped 
 And now he in a coffin on a first class trip
