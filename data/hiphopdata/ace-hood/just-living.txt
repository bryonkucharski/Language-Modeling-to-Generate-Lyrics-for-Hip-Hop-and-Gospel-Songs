Mr.Hooddd 
 (Ace Hood - Verse 1) 
 Okay 
 Keys to the benz 
 Breeze in the wind 
 Chicks get a tan 
 LV's in the lense 
 Fresh like some homemade drinks in the fridge 
 Gotta keep a bad chick, click and her friends 
 I'm just living my life, neck full of ice 
 See the rims roll like the game of the dice 
 Plus it came with the pipes, came with the top 
 Had to get it sliced, like a head full of lice 
 Nevermind was the price, cop it on site 
 Neck looking like a city fell full of lights 
 I'm a made ass nigga, bank and bigger 
 Only 19 when I seen 6 figures 
 Lord knows I'm a sinner, knows my dilemma 
 Keep a thick knott, in my hard blue denim 
 Let the hot water simmer, friends turn bitter 
 Hope a nigga fall when they scream out timber, 
 I be cool like the winter, no Decemeber 
 Two bad chicks, that's a two piece dinner 
 Ridin' in a benz, I'm a Rose sippa 
 Pour a little outt 
 R.I.P my niggasss 
 (Ace Hood - Verse 2) 
 Okay I came in the game, pray for the change 
 Click that I claim, put the name on the chain 
 Couple years of the fame, life ain't the same 
 Plenty champagne, first class on the planes 
 And it got a nigga laid, I just feel I'm in the daze 
 Music that I made, I just started gettin' praise 
 Everyday I pray, god keep me in the wave 
 Never let it phase, now I'm really gettin' paid 
 See a nigga swag, courtside Heat game 
 Probably routin on my nigga Lebron James 
 The homie Dwayne Wade, just lookin' out for the fay 
 Jay that's in your face, the champs is on the way 
 Swoosh I'm in the coupe, oops there goes the roof 
 True my bitch bad, and ass as thick as a nuis 
 My cash will introduce, my swagger in the room 
 Hit a couple of buttons, and the engine will vroom vroom 
 Shorty frontin to fuck, she'll kindly get the broom 
 And its facts so don't assume 
 Man you niggas are after, like noon 
 And tell my moms new crib, got plenty of rooms 
 Ye, Ey, Hahaha 
 We on our way to the good times baby
