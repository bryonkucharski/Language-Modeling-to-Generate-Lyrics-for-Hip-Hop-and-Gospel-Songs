 (Hey, where the cash?) 
 Aye knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cash? 
 Okay see, ain't nothing funny boy them dollars keep coming 
 Okay I got a lot of money 
 Ain't shit changed, big face hundreds 
 Pinky and the Brain, triple black cars 
 Bitch you know the name 
 Mister Hood lover, supermodel brains 
 Kicking down the door, give me what I came for 
 Checking with my shooters, blow a hole in your Kangol 
 They some barracudas, and I'm up with the cash flow 
 They some assholes 
 I think I'm Castro, I think I'm Scarface 
 Blowing money fast, Ricky Rose' 
 Big fire with me, up in the parleyed 
 Hey knock, knock, bang, bang, bitch I'm past that 
 Hey wait a minute, bitch I think I had a relapse 
 Don't jack my money I ain't asking where the cash at 
 Pull out that chopper, make you wonder where your legs at 
 Hold up wait doctor better ask him where your meds at 
 Where the cash at? Better have that 
 Super money shit, now can you smell that? 
 I'm on my grizzle, trying to make a milli' 
 Duffle full of money, more off in my denims 
 That's brown paper, only thing I'm chasing 
 Money over bitches, that's just in my nature 
 Coming for my moula, I'm sharp with that eraser
