Now that's some gangster shit 
 Don't know who you're fucking with 
 Listen 
 Now I've been known to kill them with the flow 
 The beats is back off to attack him, kicking down your door 
 You looking at a pro, smoking them like some indigo 
 See we are Seminoles, running right through your end zone 
 I'm coming as soon as they holler, I get them, I got them 
 They know it's on 
 No more of the games, you know what the name 
 I aim to bang the chrome 
 It's Mister Whatever, about my cheddar if you've never known 
 Money over bitches, now you can carry on 
 Some call me arrogant, I'm like a veteran 
 Big shit nigga, I ain't talking elephants 
 Now what you know about it? 
 My niggas they bothered about it 
 It's We the Best the mod, something like Illuminati 
 I'm taking the coupe to college, trying to find a model about it 
 Take them to the crib, now it's time to party 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 Not fucking with lames, or fucking with faith 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 You fucking with me, or fucking with you 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 All my niggas about it about 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 I'm fucking with real and never fake 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 I'm chasing that dough and never hoes 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 All my niggas about it about 
 Now that's some gangster shit 
 And now I'm back off in the place to be 
 Got rid of the nice in me, it's nice to meet my enemy 
 Don't run up on me though, I give you a overdose 
 I leave them on the stretcher, I ain't talking cardio 
 I'm sorry you didn't know, I'm dipping, I'm moving a '64 
 I'm fucking the baddest hoes, I'm beating the pussy like Baggio 
 Now cut the music up, and pour me up a cup 
 And roll you up a blunt, if you getting major bucks 
 Now welcome to gangster shit, I'm hopping up out of the fancy whip 
 Them chains around my neck, and every diamond costs a grip 
 See I'm a superstar, I'm never at the bar 
 I valet park the car, pockets on that salad bar 
 Nasty with the flow, you can call it caviar 
 Uh, now that's some gangster shit 
 I'm with a gangster clique 
 And all my niggas toting the clip
