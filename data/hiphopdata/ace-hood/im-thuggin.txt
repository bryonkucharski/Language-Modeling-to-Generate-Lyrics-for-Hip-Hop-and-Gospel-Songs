 This gon' fuck the streets up

 Police kick my door in shawty last night 
 I'll be damned if I don't go out with a fight 
 My girlfriend says she needs some new shoes and a bag 
 I told her shut the fuck up and get off your ass 
 I'm thuggin'

 Middle fingers to the cops and the judge 
 Raised by the O niggas just mean mug 
 I'm thuggin'

 Middle fingers to the cops and the judge 
 Raised by the O niggas just mean mug 
 God bless a nigga so bitch I'm out here 
 Wear the wrong color you can't come around here 
 So get your mind right and keep your pistol close 
 Hoppin' out that ride run into your place just like a seminal 
 All my niggas they thuggin' my lil' cousin got his chopper chrome 
 Any nigga want problems take your top off block the metrodome 
 It'll make a loud noise sound like it's world war 
 Never break a sweat that's what them killers for

 Deck of hundreds on me that's just what I deal with 
 Waka's thugged out and we the business 
 See me up to Ham I bet your niggas deal quick 
 Mama pray for me, commit a lot of sins 
 And it don't make it better consumin' a lot of gin 
 "Blood, Sweat and Tears" I pour my soul out 
 Smell the flowers bitch I might just pull a rose out 
 Police kick my door in shawty last night 
 I'll be damned if I don't go out with a fight 
 My girlfriend says she needs some new shoes and a bag 
 I told her shut the fuck up and get off your ass

 Middle finger all the fans 'cause I said to

 Now where my niggas who be thuggin' on the corner four 
 Hands in the air, throw your hood up 
 Hoppin' out that seven Tre, them six's when I pull up 
 Now where my bad bitches who keep their ass phat

 And I keep them real niggas, homie that's fact

 And homie that's word, my niggas gon' lurk 
 See that red and blue I'm runnin' out my converse 
 Police kick my door in shawty last night
