(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Well all right 
 (Statement) 
 There's only one way to go from here 
 And that's up 
 (Mister Hood) 
 Amen 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Okay, me and them schemes got my past life jealous 
 Niggas doing crime but I'm into making cheddar 
 Promise to my mama you will never send me letters 
 Or threw me through them bars with them murderers and killers 
 Addicted to the women, but she like to call them hoes 
 With them fine high heels and them super fitted clothes 
 Fascinated by the dough, I graduated on 
 Just my salary alone I can get a bank a loan 
 With them six figure checks that just pop up at my home 
 Got me flying around the world, Louis V. carry on 
 And what do I do? Blow a couple on a shone 
 Brag about it on the phone to my niggas back at home 
 Got my mama in my ear saying "Leave the women alone" 
 They don't mean you no good, they just know to buy your song 
 But that's another note, I just thought I'd let them know 
 Mister Chili-Pepper-Flow, sick as AIDS in the throat 
 Man you niggas for the show, call them Doctor Huxtable 
 This 'The Statement', I swear you rappers sign at the dope 
 Mister 9-5-4, blow a nigga team's smoke 
 Who going to kill them in the end before the credits even wrote? 
 This a movie, niggas playing groupies 
 Jumping on your dick when they see you in the two seat 
 Claiming that he hot, but you rappers never move me 
 Like them to the action not the motherfucking movie 
 Boo he, puue, nigga I'm the shit man 
 Bad bladder so I only wear shit bag 
 Yeah, so name another nigga this dope 
 If it is, probably turn him into white coke 
 Big money, bitch nigga I repute broke 
 Light slow and I swear I let them all know 
 I'm at your front door 
 Light it up if you know you got the good smoke 
 (Drake) 
 Who would have thought 
 I'd be caught, in this life? 
 Let's celebrate, with a toast 
 And get lost, in tonight 
 And make it all light up 
 Wait until the sun goes down 
 We going to make this bitch light up 
 Even when the sun goes down 
 I'm going to make this go
