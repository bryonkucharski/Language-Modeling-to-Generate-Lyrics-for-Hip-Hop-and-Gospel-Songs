I got my back against the wall 
 And it feels like all the times before 
 The pass till the fall 
 But today I stand and fight this war 
 I got my back against the wall 
 I won't break, I won't break, I won't break 
 No, no, I won't fall 
 With my back against the wall 
 Struggle in my eyes, guns in the stash 
 Heart full of pride, sunny days past 
 Monogram bags, Louis V. tags 
 Money rule the world, I swear this shit is sad 
 But I will get over that, and I will get over this 
 See they remain to hate, but they'll get over it 
 And my mama told me 
 Yes she told me watch them friends you with 
 Should of listened to her, they manure wasn't worth a shit 
 But I'm too legit to quit, understand my arrogance 
 Hit them where it hurts, I'm miss him for shit 
 Back against the wall, but still I manage to ball 
 Success is on my line, but still I manage to call 
 I will never fall, that's my reply to all 
 He gave me everything, that skies apply to all 
 Soul of a beast, I'ma get them all 
 Many days of pumps, but still I'm standing tall 
 Uh, and I'm sick of all you blood suckers 
 Feel like I'ma lose it in this motherfucker 
 Tell me where the booth at in this motherfucker 
 So I can burn this bitch down, fireman sucker 
 Too many days and sleepless nights 
 I toss and turn and wonder why 
 My money thoughts corrupted mind 
 But I guess that's just how I'm designed 
 Felt like I'm falling down, niggas timid to me all around 
 But I still remain a beast 
 Tell them come fuck with me now, I let you win the fight 
 While I'ma die for war, pride and my respect 
 I hope you die for yours, money then the power 
 Continue doing chores, a back against the wall 
 I penetrate a pause 
 I'm never looking back, because the destruction caused 
 Only know to win, you just check the score
