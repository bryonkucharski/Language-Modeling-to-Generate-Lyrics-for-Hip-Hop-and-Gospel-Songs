Struggling my past, pain in my expressions 
 Running on my last, avoid the deep depressions 
 Beefing with the bottom I'm so afraid to fall in 
 And all these fucking problems turning me into an alcoholic 
 Where did I go wrong, I swear this can't be life 
 17 and pregnant that just can't be right 
 In love with a man who fucking your friend depends on what you like 
 This bitter earth 
 Ah, this world is crazy, hate on my babies, gotta receive the sight 
 Just ask the lord to give me the strength so they believe was right 
 And 'smooth nigger who trying to get a home tonight 
 Infesting the gun ' the type 
 It's a cold world, keep your sweater close 
 Made it be but see ' family the ones who hate the most 
 That's the damn shame, how dare you doubt your blood 
 Don't know my real father, how come you drop my love 
 ' Alone, there's no one to hug 
 He left me all alone, how could you leave your cub 
 But fuck it I'm a man with or without your ass 
 They ask about my pain, some things I wish that I had 
 Just thank the man above, my mom considers my dad 
 She working spending her last, whatever we wanted we had 
 The struggle created a man, no longer your job demands 
 No thoughts of counter ' I've failed and let's ' 
 I've been through hell and back, but still I'm here to stand 
 Mama need a house, so fuck it I'll buy some land 
 Dying to be the greatest, but greater comes with patience 
 Got my bizness right, and trust my mama good 
 What more heart is just to say I made it out the hood 
 You fucking right, bitter world 
 Cried a hundred tears when I see my baby girls 
 When I see my baby girls, damn 
 ' Sweat and tears, this my testimony 
 Just know the world is yours, ain't that right, Tony? 
 Gas prices high, niggers die young 
 Bad role models, that's what that came from 
 That's what that came from 
 This bitter world, my god 
 Well, well, my god, well, 
 This bitter earth, well 
 Dear world, dear world, I need you undivided 
 And know some choices that we made were highly undecided 
 We keep it mind, we giving them signs, the time just disregard it 
 This bitter world, well 
 Ah, some live in the blind afraid of the light, 
 But pain just can't be departed 
 The things that I seen I wish it was dreams'sleeping hardly 
 Lost a lot of homies endured a lot of pain 
 Pray for better nights, slowly they became 
 I hear my phone ring, fuck who calling me 
 I just hope that it's success who trying to bother peace 
 Fuck this bitter world, with no apologies 
 Babies having babies, what could your father be 
 Sick of being tired, and tired of being broke 
 Mama worked too hard I pray ' of stroke 
 Microphone and words, clearly show me hope 
 Without it I'm alone, clearly you should know.
