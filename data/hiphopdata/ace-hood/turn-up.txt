(Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 They told me "Where you getting money? Boy them niggas hate" 
 Taught to trust nobody other than my .38 
 Fuck a nigga, petty weight 
 It's just me and all this money I'll be okay 
 Hustle hard, each and every day 
 Thinking of a master plan, accumulating cake 
 Very rapid pace, motherfucker bang 
 IRS be watching, stash it in the safe 
 Never trust a nigga, even in his face 
 Catch him stealing from me, that's another case 
 Prices on your head, show up to your weight 
 Cold blooded killer, one more to the face 
 Don't nobody side, fuck who got away 
 Happy Meal clips, have a nice day 
 Money is the motive, nothing mediocre 
 Keep that pussy popping, like a canned soda 
 Let her ride the dick, come and be my chauffeur 
 Heavy money piles, I need a bulldozer 
 So keep away the hate, I can't stand the odor 
 I'm just getting started, Indy try and told them 
 (Chorus - Ace Hood) 
 They told me "Were you getting money? Boy them niggas hate" 
 Me and Ballgreezy get this shit by any way 
 Real niggas, fuck with us 
 We'll be bucking in this bitch until they come get us 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 I wish a nigga would 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 Turn up 
 The whole hood want him 
 (Verse 2 - Ballgreezy) 
 Fuck the other side, bitch I'm going ham 
 Pocket full of bands, so rock your head, yeah! 
 Coconut, and it taste good, Ballgreezy and Ace Hood 
 Big pistols, and blowing reefer 
 Up in this bitch, because my face good 
 Me and my niggas make movies 
 Going down about my foolish 
 Hell naw, you can't hit the weed 
 Or make the drink, bitch keep it moving 
 Around here, it's G-code 
 Ask around, the streets know 
 Love fucking them freak hoes 
 With a fat ass and a deep throat 
 My outfit, is so shaw 
 My shoe game, is so hard 
 Stomp with the groupies 
 Sitting nigga that's your hoe job 
 The music all the way turned up 
 Rosay getting poured up 
 My cellphone keep blowing up 
 By the bad bitch that I'm going to fuck 
 My shades on, and they real dawg 
 My ice shining real hard 
 Niggas acting real hard, that beef shit, and we'll solve 
 Pop up with that loose shit, thinking that I ain't going to do shit 
 Thinking I ain't going to shoot shit 
 Won't give a fuck about who hit 
 (Verse 3 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay, I'm gone off of tequila 
 Hopping out of that Regal 
 24's on my whip 
 Toasting my neck colder than freezers 
 I'm turned up with my top down 
 Bad bitch and she turn around 
 Ass fat and I dick her down 
 Fuck her free like I'm sights or sounds 
 And bitch I'm heavy balling 
 Nicknamed Mister Spalding 
 Momma told me kill them, dead man walking 
 Riding with that reefer, rip through any carcass 
 It's We the Best forever, bitch I'm just now getting started 
 Hold up
