Yeah, Mister Hood 
 Ace 
 Ahem 
 Okay, everybody do it but it ain't like me 
 Check my swagger, they bite my steez 
 Flyest nigga seen, I'm doped in codeine 
 Got so much money I'm trying to O.D. 
 Do's what I does I love to be me 
 Middle finger haters and the police 
 Moving through your block and I drop the top V 
 My trunk is shaking Muhammad Ali 
 Broward County beast the beast when I feast 
 I rep my AC wherever that I be 
 Pretty boy never that, where my O.G.'s? 
 Fitted cap, dreadlocks tatted on the sleeve 
 Love me a chick, fit well in them jeans 
 Got to keep it wet right there in between 
 Whip that shit like a slave, alright? 
 I ain't with the godamned games, alright? 
 Sick with the flow, need a medicine dose 
 Ten grand each show, ask Tim they know 
 Hopping in and out of them whips with a fully load clip 
 Don't trip because the bitch my rip 
 Because the bitch might rip 
 Better watch the way you're running your lip 
 Because they already told you 
 My niggas they soldiers, you want to make over 
 You can get, this, whole, clip 
 Make, your, ass, flip 
 This right here (Here) here (Here) here (Here) here (Here) 
 Here (Here) 
 Is my, AK-47, AK-47, AK-47, AK-47 
 W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T my nigga 
 Mister Hood
