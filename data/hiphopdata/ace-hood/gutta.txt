(It's so incredible) 
 Ace... 
 You ain't comin' round here talkin' all dat shit 
 Talkin' 'bout you get all dem bricks 
 I'm a have to come round your way 
 Nigga I'm real you all too fake 
 And a pistol where ya mamma stay 
 Act like I don't know where you lay 
 Betta act right fo' I get uptight 
 Act up I'm a let da automatic spray 
 x2: 
 (Get em) boy there ya go 
 (Get em) boy there ya go 
 Blocka Blocka Blocka Blocka 
 Boy there you go 
 Hol' up with it, Khaled don't let me get em 
 Gun cocked, where his cheerin? 
 No talk, time to get him 
 Fake niggas gon' make me kill him 
 Make his body shiver like he naked in a river 
 Matter fact I'm a leave him in the river 
 Come and get him when it's winter 
 Nigga holla back 
 I'm gutta. I done told ya that 
 Rock boy bitch over bags 
 Say you movin them slabs of crack 
 See nigga you a lie like Pac is back 
 Man you niggas all crap 
 And you homies won't last 
 Till your somethin' like paper tags 
 Don't make me slide the mask 
 To save from blast 
 Get his ass 
 Now let me get em 
 When I walk up in the place 
 Put the pace in ya face 
 Tell 'em gimme dat K 
 Fuck niggas and they really don't think 
 That I know where they lay duct tape they face 
 Pop pop, unload dat K 
 Then we leave 'em and we find 'em in a couple of days 
 Pussy niggas know where you lay 
 Actin' like I don't know where you stay 
 Runnin' at ya mouth man ya niggas too fake 
 Tellin' all the niggas that you move them thangs 
 What? 
 Y'ain't bout dat lie 
 Y'ain't got no stride 
 Naww 
 You'nt really grind 
 Leave 'em in da streets till the D boys find em 
 Dumb niggas and they huggin on the grind 
 In the middle of this town 
 We gon' G-G-Get em 
 Now who am I? mothafuckas wanna know 
 When I pull up in that rover 
 They know that it's over 
 Big holes in ya body like coasters 
 Creep Creep we deep with soldiers 
 Black holster to carry that toaster 
 Hot head now they callin me folgers 
 But still creep in adidas with the heaters, millimeters 
 Wanna see where yo family at 
 Pop pop just call me ace 
 Slump niggas I'm a call you dead 
 Click clack now ya T-shirt red 
 Hand 'em an tampon 
 No batteries included know that the clip be hands on 
 It'll take yo man's on 
 Leave his body slumped in the damn yard 
 (Get em)
