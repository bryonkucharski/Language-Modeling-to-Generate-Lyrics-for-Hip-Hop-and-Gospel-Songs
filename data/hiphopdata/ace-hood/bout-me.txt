(Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Mister Hood 
 Nigga I'm good 
 Ace Hood 
 Face good 
 Wish a nigga would 
 Take this 
 Bake this 
 Feed it to the wolves 
 A motherfucker should 
 I'm beating like band wood 
 That black flag swag is part of my man hood 
 That pistol on that seat is just keeping your man good 
 I'll pop his top like drops and can goods 
 I'm gutter 
 Tell you one thing about me 
 I'm stuck to the green 
 Like the coke to the fiends 
 And if by all means 
 Just pay me in all green 
 Sprite chasing the promethezine, I'm on lean 
 Ball Greez my dude, we goon your whole team 
 I'm him them dangers ask your man mane 
 Fifteen bottles of Rose and champagne 
 Niggas they know the name and understand the game 
 I know you see the chain 
 It's We the Best the game 
 (Chorus - Ace Hood) 
 Bitch I'm ruthless 
 Boy I'm a G 
 And you don't know a motherfucking thing about me 
 One thing about me 
 I do it for the streets 
 I do it for the killers and them young O.G.s 
 Tell you this about me 
 (About me) 
 About me 
 (About me) 
 I'm a G I'ma rock with that beat 
 Tell you this about me 
 (About me) 
 About me, 
 (About me) 
 I'ma keep that black flag on me 
 Tell you that about me 
 (Verse 2 - Ballgreezy) 
 I'ma stack my bread and fuck nigga's hoes 
 Shoot dice, drink liquor, and sell dope 
 Tote fire, stay fresh everywhere I go 
 Pop pills and while I'm getting my goon on 
 Pack extra clips, and get my suit on 
 Ask bitch ass niggas who want to move wrong 
 So if you got it on your mind let a nigga know 
 So I could show you that the .9 send niggas home 
 Other then that, the street niggas love Greez 
 Even though they baby momma want to fuck me 
 I'm one hundred about everything the boy do 
 That's why the crowd behind me everywhere I move 
 And you can tell by the swag Greez about money 
 And I don't play no games when it's about money 
 I do it for them young niggas that pop beams 
 The hot boys with big stacks the cops see 
 (Verse 3 - Ace Hood) 
 Aye where my goons at? 
 Where my G's at? 
 Where them killers and them zoes staying so strapped? 
 Broward County on the map, that's a known fact 
 And when I talk back, people running four flat 
 And night see the light, you can follow that 
 I creep all black 
 So strapped 
 Fuck rap get your baby boy kidnapped 
 Black flag, my rag got the wrist wrap 
 Respecet G, when I walk not a pen tap 
 Because I'm me 
 Who's he? We could end that 
 Street nigga ain't no time for that chit chat 
 I'm cold like Coronas in a 6 pack 
 Ace Hood getting head like a ball cap 
 One thing about me I don't call back 
 Fall back, I'm addicted to the brown bag 
 MC Hammer swag 
 'Can't touch that'
