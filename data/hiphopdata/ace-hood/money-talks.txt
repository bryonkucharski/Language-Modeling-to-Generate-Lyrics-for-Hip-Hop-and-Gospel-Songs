(Intro - Ace Hood and Jay-Z) 
 (Ace Hood) 
 What? 
 (Jay-Z) 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 The whole world about to hear me out 
 (Ace Hood) 
 I'm laughing to the bank baby! 
 You follow me? 
 [Chorus - Jay-Z] X2 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 If money talks 
 The whole world about to hear me out 
 If money talks the whole world about to hear me out 
 If money talks the whole world about to hear me out 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 I'm Mister Hood! 
 Okay, money in the building, sanitize the room 
 You ain't talking paper nigga you can get the snooze 
 See I'm here for paying dues 
 Quarter million worth of jewels 
 See the shoes Louis V. plus my bitch in Jimmy Choo 
 Why you plotting all your moves, I be dipping in the cool 
 Got an educated top, but now he dropping out of school 
 Now my future looking bright, introduce you to the ice 
 VVS's so precise, not a flowering in your sight 
 Big money in the place, money in the safe 
 Got the type of money that'll ban you from the state 
 Nigga money what we talking, step into my office 
 Stacking dead presidents, that's way too many coffins 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay, money and the power, taking what is ours 
 Hoe niggas and bullshit, send his mother flowers 
 Dealing with them wolves, homie you can get devoured 
 We get bookoo dollars, see me bitches holler 
 Gucci, Louis, Prada, on my sneaker, belt, and collar 
 Fly as Delta Airlines, an Army Navy chopper 
 They say money rule the world, diamonds and the pearls 
 See I just think it's easy when it come to getting girls 
 So I just introduce them to the liquor not the Earl 
 And they must wear a sweater 
 Because my diamonds make the them burr 
 Like the Gucci Mane bitch, read the label on the kicks 
 See my foreign leather whip, FEDS think he moving bricks 
 But uh
