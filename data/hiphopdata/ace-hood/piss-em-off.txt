Fresh on the scene, I just let the swag talk 
 Watch, I pull up in that foreign just to piss 'em off 
 Had to whisper to my dog, I say we here to ball 
 Chain ring, wrist bling, I'm a piss 'em off 
 Okay, more bottles of Rosay 
 Ermaz on her waist, complimented by that oche 
 Looking kinda fly Mr. Hood what them hoes say 
 Pissing niggas off by the bezel on the watch face 
 On that nick Shorty, this just how the boss play 
 Phantom with the two tone, left it with the valet 
 You don't have a rank, catch me cooping on a Sunday 
 Bitch I am the shit. We clear? Blue Ray 
 Check the swag. Yea, it's on 
 Gettin' cash, the bank roll 
 I get it fast, never slow 
 Piss 'em off just to let them haters know 
 Let 'em know you will never meet a nigga this fly, I ain't lying 
 Got the top off the wip 
 You ain't ridin', you ain't ridin' 
 If the watch under 40 
 You ain't shinnin', you ain't shinnin' 
 Piss 'em off, you niggas all talk, ain't bide it 
 Old man, ten grand, bought the whole mall 
 Heard they hatin' so I did it just to piss 'em off 
 Chilling with a bad bitch Mrs. WhatchaCall 
 Put her in a red bottom just to piss 'em off 
 Good lord, you know what the wrist cost 
 Bid the pretty penny probably triple what your rent cost 
 Get a nigga shine it, like cutting on a chandelier 
 Hop in about that Porsche, why of course that be tha Panamere 
 Louie, Gucci, Fini or Versace be my day a pair 
 Oh that shit got you talkin' 
 It's nice, Christmas Carol I ain't with the bullshit 
 I do this for real though 
 Kick it with a player, talking gang when the field goal 
 Swimming in some money, fuck around and do a backstroke 
 You know how I like it baby, you just keep your bag low 
 Main I'm a dog, my whips are retarded 
 Swag out of space, you couldn't match it with a martian 
 Whatcha talin'? 
 Check the swag. Yea, it's on 
 Gettin' cash, the bank roll 
 I get it fast, never slow 
 Piss 'em off just to let them haters know 
 Let 'em know you will never meet a nigga this fly, ain't lying 
 Got the top off the wip 
 You ain't ridin', you ain't ridin' 
 If the watch under 40 
 You ain't shinnin', you ain't shinnin' 
 Piss 'em off, you niggas all talk, ain't bide it
