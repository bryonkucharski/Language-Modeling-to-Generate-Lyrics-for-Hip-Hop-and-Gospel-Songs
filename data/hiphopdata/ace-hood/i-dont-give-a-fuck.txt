I don't give a fuck 
 They done push me to the limit the more I live 
 I might blow up any minute, did it again 
 Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon 
 While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin 
 I see no justice 
 All I see is niggas dying fast 
 The sound of a gun blast 
 Then watch the hurst past 
 Just another day in the life 'G' 
 Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snippe me 
 The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man 
 But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man 
 I went to the bank to cash my cheque 
 I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man 
 The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes 
 They got dough but they hate us though 
 You better keep your mind on the real shit 
 And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites 
 They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down 
 Just can't understand why we getting respect now 
 Mama told me they're be days like this 
 But I'm pissed cause it stays like this 
 And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait 
 Gimme a break 
 How much shit can a nigga take 
 I ain't goin' nowhere no how 
 Better bring your guns pal 
 'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay 
 Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K 
 And even if they shoot me down 
 There'll be another nigga bigger 
 So step but you better step quick 
 From the mutha-fuckin' underground 
 Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit 
 You're watching the makings of a physco-path 
 The truth didn't last 
 Before the wrath and aftermath 
 Who's that behind the trigger? 
 Who'd do yah figure!? 
 A mutha-fuckin' night nigga 
 Ready to buck and rip shit up 
 I had enough and I don't give a fuck 
 Niggas!, isn't just the blacks 
 Also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks 
 They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty 
 Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city 
 They say niggas like to do niggas, 
 Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas 
 A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge 
 I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash 
 And that's just his luck 
 And bash his head in dump him at the dead in 
 Cause a nigga like me 
 Don't really give a fuck 
 Walked in the store what's everybody staring at 
 They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black 
 Following a nigga and shit 
 Ain't this a bitch 
 All I wanted was some chips 
 I wanna take my business else where 
 But where? 
 Cause who in the hell cares 
 About a black man with a black need 
 They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend 
 I wonder if knows that my income is more than 
 His pension, salary and then some 
 Your daughter is my number one fan 
 And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man 
 So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack 
 Sit back and get fat off the fat cat 
 While he thinks that he's getting over 
 I bust a move as smooth as casanova 
 And count another quick meal 
 I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real 
 And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme 
 AS strong as a fuckin' nine 
 Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up 
 Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up 
 But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot 
 Usta come but he's done, now we run the block 
 To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up 
 They know we fed up 
 But we they just don't give a fuck 
 They just don't give a fuck 
 I gotta give my fuck offs 
 Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department 
 Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department 
 Fuck you to the F.B.I 
 Fuck you to the C.I.A 
 Fuck you to the B-u-s-h 
 Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa 
 Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice mutha fuckas 
 And fuck yah 
 Fuck Y'all 
 Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards 
 2paclypse mutha fuckin' know 
 Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick 
 And my uncle Tommy's balls 
 Fuck Y'all 
 Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks
