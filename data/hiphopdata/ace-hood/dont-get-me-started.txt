You don't want to get me started ho 
 You don't want to get me started ho 
 Ace Hood 
 We the best, YMCMB 
 My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake 
 Was on the block every night, was on the block every day 
 I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame 
 I kept it real from the joint and that's just how I remain 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My nigga, my nigga don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded 
 Cause a nigga wanna think it's sweet then try me 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started 
 Ok now clique full of niggas with tempers 
 Clique full of niggas and killas 
 When they cut me I don't pay them 
 With the two them nigga eyes remember 
 I'm the same lil nigga from the block ho 
 And I drive still walk with the Glock on 
 I'm about that cream, guaplage on 
 Don't get me started up ho 
 I come to whip in the Phantom 
 Y'all niggas really can't stand it 
 Them hoes really be jocking 
 Diamonds that got them watching 
 Say Ace ain't getting' no money 
 Pussy, I beg your pardon 
 You don't wanna get me started 
 You don't wanna see how I'm ballin' 
 Ok ok, what it look like? 
 Well that good thing got and it's good night 
 With a bad bitch, she's so thick 
 She rolling, I know this 
 And her neck gon' froze, better know that 
 Act up, I smell like a Kodak 
 And these niggas these niggas 
 These niggas these niggas 
 These niggas these niggas won't hold back 
 My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake 
 Was on the block every night, was on the block every day 
 I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame 
 I kept it real from the joint and that's just how I remain 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My nigga, my nigga don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded 
 Cause a nigga wanna think it's sweet then try me 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started 
 Ok them pussy niggas be hating 
 Focus on what I'm making 
 Came through in tha Phantom 
 Them pussy niggas can't take it 
 Spit big bread on my chain 
 Still on stroke with your main 
 I'm rich nigga like yea nigga 
 They hoping I stay the same 
 They say I changed when I got fame 
 Bitch niggas, they complain 
 Flat black in that 2 door 
 Nigga must think he Bruce Wayne 
 I'm like damn hood what it be like? 
 Hold 'em down as your knee lights 
 New bitch like every day 
 Swear to God you won't see her twice 
 That purple that got me leaning 
 They don't wanna get me started 
 Come on this hook, no phonics 
 Introduce this shit and go retarded 
 Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing 
 Extended clips that's standing tall; two chain 
 My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake 
 Was on the block every night, was on the block every day 
 I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame 
 I kept it real from the joint and that's just how I remain 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My nigga, my nigga don't get me started, don't get me started 
 My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded 
 Cause a nigga wanna think it's sweet then try me 
 Don't get me started, don't get me started
