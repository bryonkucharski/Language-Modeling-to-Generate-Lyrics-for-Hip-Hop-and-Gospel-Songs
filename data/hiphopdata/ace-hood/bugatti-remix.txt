We the motherfuckin best nigga 
 Remix motherfucker! 
 Ace Hood! 
 This the remix! 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating 
 (Turn Up!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

 Tats all over my body 
 Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me 
 Man y'all need a new hobby 
 Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say? 
 I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher 
 On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes 
 I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's 
 Dam, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that? 
 Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back 
 Couple weeks old, "Bugatti" done went gold 
 You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque 
 We the best, runnin' every summer in fact 
 July 16th I'm bringin' the real back 
 Broward! Pussy 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 Hold up, double M back in this bitch 
 Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip 
 Diamonds look like niggas be snappin a flick 
 Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP 
 I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch 
 A new Mussolini in back of the six 
 I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick 
 Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get 
 'Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip 
 And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch 
 And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick 
 But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch 
 Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari 
 With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me 
 New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce 
 And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating 
 (Turn Up!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

 And it's paid for nigga 
 Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga 
 I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga 
 Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga 
 H-U-S-T-L-E gang 
 For that, in God we trust, we bang 
 I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti 
 I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin' 
 Right, put it in the light 
 Nigga got ice but it don't look right 
 If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right 
 I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight 
 I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move 
 And all I want is money, leave the fame to you 
 I graduated out of gladiator school 
 So all I know is go like I'm trained to do 
 Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm mashin out 
 I let the top down in my Phantom drop 
 Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut 
 When you see me, I'm cashin' out 
 Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot 
 You keep carrying on, you getting carried out 
 'Cause I don't take ass whoopins, just pass 'em out 
 Is this worth getting blasted about? 
 No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about? 
 Money conversation 
 Get so high, I be scrapin' 
 Got my eyes like a Asian 
 In my ride, like I'm racin' 
 In the sky, like a plane 
 It's Gang or die 
 Ain't no lames up in my circle 
 Ain't no ho shit in my eyes 
 Throwin' money in the air 
 Poppin' bands and let it fly 
 Where I'm from, you come up short 
 Pull that thing and let it fly 
 You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley 
 Got so much ink on my body 
 Brought so much drink to the party 
 I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating 
 (Turn Up!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!) 
 Fresh, whips 
 Candy on that money dip 
 Five hundred, I'm hood rich 
 Put in work, did a hundred flips 
 Been about them mansions 
 Stunna island, we packin' 
 Rich gang, we uptown 
 Nigga hardbody and mackin' 
 Tool on that back, nigga 
 Money and that power 
 Mansion on that beach, nigga 
 Blood red Bugatti 
 Versace on my bitch, nigga 
 Blow a mil' like it's a dollar 
 Stunt 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 Woke up with the crown nigga 
 Serving Bobby Brown nigga 
 Started from the bottom now it's caught up, Nino Brown nigga 
 Take my spot nigga never will 
 Now I know how 'melo feel 
 We both shooters from New York 
 But I shown nigga how the metal feel 
 Fidel Castro with them cuban links 
 With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link 
 Excuse My French nigga, no France 
 Hottest new niggas in ten years 
 Coke boy deal like ten M's 
 DJ Khaled up in there 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit 
 On my, give her some hundreds she did 
 Like this, I'mma say this 
 Fuck it, I'll say it 
 If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid 
 Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken 
 Add up my outfit, fashion statement 
 This the school of hard knocks, graduation 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti 
 I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy 
 Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it 
 I didn't really know 2Pac or Big 
 But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em 
 Fuck underrated, I'm constipated 
 I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper 
 You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest 
 Ace Hood, congratulations 
 Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him 
 Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga 
 Made a way out of the jungle 
 And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit 
 Recently flooded my neck and my wrist 
 Tell all them critics to suck on the dick 
 Nigga 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti
