Ace hood: 
 A say hello to mister cutthroat bodys on the damn flo 
 All about the cash flow like my money in bank rolls 
 These haters pissed they know I'm the shit like my asshole 
 And I'm from the city were fuckin' snitches don't last long 
 And I'm in the city were you keep it real or get mashed on 
 Yes that be broward county I love it it's still home 
 If they don't like it a say fuckem still they walls gone 
 And to my city got to meet up with yo man's homes 
 Fort Lauderdale, Pompano for browder be my damn zone 
 Feel that anyway with it you can get serviced like a cell phone 
 They got that coke it's brightest whitest like a snow cone 
 And I'm me give my all behind this microphone 
 I give my blood sweat in tears in till my casket closed 
 In tell then I'm a givem wat they askin for 
 Hope up out that newest shit louie kicks wavin makon six 
 See me with that square in I'll blow a kiss at yo ladys kid 
 Fuck the politics I am all the shit that I say I am 
 Yes I know I'm blessed am bonnies angel I'm heaven sent 
 That's word to mother mommy never see yo baby quit 
 And know matter how many blocks of haters yo youngin get 
 So f'em all I'm taking over let me in this bitch

 And now I'm back I signed my deala for a couple m's 
 And I am next to be the best up in this southern limit 
 And I'm from the city were ther is no mister millionaires 
 And now I'm back I signed my deala for a couple m's 
 And I'm next to be the best up in this southern limit 
 And I'm next to be the best up in the southern limit 
 I'm from the city were there ain't know mister millionaires 
 That's why today I got my deal I cried a hundred tears 
 Cause once I got it promised momma that we out of here 
 My swag changed in I lit up like the city fair 
 I started doing interviews and photo shoots to death 
 These niggas seen it and they hollin bout this shit ain't fair 
 Why he ain't chose me how come he chose him
