Hold up... 
 I'm just coming to blow ya mind with the flow 
 Know what? 
 Niggas is hatin' 'cause I signed with tha Row 
 So what? 
 Y'all been tryin' to stop mine on the low 
 I climb in the fo' 
 Let the glock pop... nine in a row 
 If I catch you after eleven 
 I'ma have to point an acurate weapon 
 At your acurate legend 
 And clap you with seven 
 I'm crazier than servin' crack to a reverend 
 Plus, I ruin your career 
 Like if the news camera catch you with Tevin 
 Ugh! Just gimme your rightful invision 
 I stiffle your mission 
 Swing and hit niggas hard as motorcycle collisions 
 Watch your ass, like you Michael in prison 
 There's so many weak wick-whack 
 Recycle-rap niggas 
 I'm liable to diss 'em 
 Even though, they scared of testin' me now 
 Quit playin' games, you "Got Beef?" 
 "Say My Name," like you Destiny's Child 
 First off all, let's get a few things straight: 
 This Death Row and I'm the new teammate 
 Nigga, your crew seen fate 
 We drop it fast 
 Watchin' bodies get carried like shoppin' bags 
 I ain't seen y'all up in the 'hood since niggas was rockin' Shaq's 
 Standin' by this hot nigga, your s'pose to burn 
 Lets make a toast to Death Row's return 
 Ya heard? 
 Act like you knizzo, nigga this Death Rizzo 
 Niggas throw ya hands up, bitches get on the flizzo 
 Bangin' on you bustas in the two-triple-izzo 
 Kickin' in the dizzo 
 And that's so for shizzo 
 (2 times) 
 (Verse 2: Crooked I) 
 Oh... you niggas thought it was over and done? 
 I told you a soldier would come 
 Run for both of your guns 
 While you got that chronic smoke in your lungs 
 Open your mail, there's a picture inside, of me... chokin' your son 
 You're broke than a bum 
 Need to rap over some fatter samples 
 You Roger Troutman... out-settin' a bad example 
 In fact, should of had you gaffled, in back of the tabernacle 
 When you was tryin' to have ??? sex from that tramp, 
 With the adam's apple 
 I never understood why they was hatin' on Crook' 
 It's all just good 'cause the whole 'hood was waitin' on Crook' 
 I don't battle rap groups 
 I put switches on Cadilac Coupes 
 Nigga, that's how the strap shoots 
 I still... beat the hell outta fat dukes 
 While you cowards act cute 
 I teach these rap, soup-eatin' niggas how to stack loot 
 Gats to tuck 
 Can't tell you cats enough 
 The first thug label in the world, that's wussup... 
 It's Death Rizzo 
 Yo... we still crackin' and smashin' for some real action 
 I'm still the best thing to happen to L.A. since Phil Jackson 
 So all of you marks tuck in your chain 
 Or on your next video shoot, you'll be be lookin' like you just got jumped 
 In the game 
 For the Row... it's nothin' to bang 
 Fuckin' ya game 
 Thuggin' the same 
 Lovin' the game 
 You catch a slug in your brain! 
 You'll be alive at 5:25 and dead by 5:30 
 Call me a trashman because I always ride dirty 
 We draw crews and clickin' them 
 It's all cool... 
 Cause y'all fools is all too soft 
 We harder than law school curriculums 
 Stickin' up 64 victims a minute 
 Twistin' ya minute 
 Balistic off the most viscious hylosingenics invented 
 I drop a line 
 Rock a rhyme 
 Shock ya mind 
 Cock a nine 
 Stop ya time 
 Rob ya blind... 
 Rhyme till the block is mine 
 You can't hit Crooked I; you sound dope 
 Cause them niggaz that wrote your shit... [bit Crooked I] 
 This Death Rizzo
