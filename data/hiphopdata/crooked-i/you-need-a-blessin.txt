(Feat. Jim Gittum) 
 (Intro: backgroung) 
 ...The will to cary on 
 On with the show 
 On with the show! 
 Oh Show Must Go On 
 (Crooked I: talking) 
 Yeah 
 The show must go on 
 We all been through up and dows in out lifes (yeah) 
 I've been through some, you been through some but we can't let it stop us 
 (Can't stop) 
 Life stumbling blocks can't do nothing with us man (nothing) 
 We gotta keep moving with an iron will (gotta keep moving) 
 Heart of a lion (yeah shit is real man) (this is real nigga) 
 I know you stressing (me too my nigga) 
 But we can make it (we got a problem) (gotta make it) 
 Chea! (Yeah) 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1: Crooked I) 
 Even as a youg kid I had a Boss demeanor 
 Problably see me in the drop givin' a cop the finger 
 My girlfriend is a rachet I cock the nina 
 She serving niggaz for the raquet but she's not Serena 
 Niggaz wanna run infront my car pop the beamer 
 Wet of water I ain't talking Aquafina 
 So I kick spiritual lyrics in God's arena 
 Start pouring my heart out more than a gospel singer 
 My whole life never felt fair 
 "Fuck my dead beat father" is what a yelled as a kid living on welfare 
 No healthcare we walking down hell stairs 
 Hell Yeah! I looked for help else where 
 All I had was a 9milli and one gage 
 Plus Rage 
 I dropped out at a young age 
 Fuck Grades 
 My mission to become paid even if one day they put my face on the front page 
 Now I beef and squa, sleep with raw 
 Thief and rob the streets to beat the odds 
 My homie slit both of his wrists 
 He said he wanted to meet with God 
 'Cause he couldn't keep a descent job 
 I seen it as a true lesson 
 You can't afford to step outside of your mind, for 2 seconds 
 If so, you choose weapons, shoot yourself with this Smith and Wesson until 
 You're through stressing, DAMN! 
 (Chorus: Crooked I) 
 I know you stressing homey 
 You need blessing homey 
 I've been there before 
 Life is hard, I know (I know) 
 Face your depression homey 
 It ain't a question homey 
 We can fight and survive the odds fo sho! (we can fight) 
 I know you stressing homey 
 You need blessing homey (yeah) 
 I've been there before 
 Life is hard, I know (I know) 
 Face your depression homey (face it) 
 It ain't a question homey (it ain't one) 
 We can fight and survive the odds fo sho! 
 (Verse 2: Jim Gittum) 
 Now when times get hard 
 Sometimes they get harder 
 She should have been, could have been, baby moms supporting my daughter 
 While I was out wild 'n' out trying to be Shawn Carter 
 Should have been working a 9 to 5 trying to be a father 
 I was only 18 trying to chase this dream 
 Rebellious little nigga mesmerized by the Bling 
 Then I had a spirit encounter with the King of kings 
 And he told me "Jim Gittum go and do your thing" 
 Now I understand what vision and focus mean 
 Prioritized lay my ties and now I get green 
 I ain't trying to be extreme and say that life is perfect 
 I'm just trying to say walk by faith and life would be worth it 
 Gotta think more optimistic and control your thoughts 
 Gotta think more postivite before you talk 
 It's true you gotta learn to crawl right before you walk 
 But after you learn to walk you run to be number one!
