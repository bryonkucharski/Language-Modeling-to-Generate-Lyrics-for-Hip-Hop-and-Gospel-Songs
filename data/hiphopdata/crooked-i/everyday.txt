How many times I gotta tell you niggas? 
 I'm not like you! 
 Sup niggas 
 It's your boy 
 Crooked I 
 Yeah 
 Turn this shit up 
 Turn it up! 
 I ain't never love a cop 
 They some American devils 
 Wanna bury me since birth 
 Gave my parents a shovel 
 Real niggas don't die 
 So they scared of the ghetto 
 What's a puppet compared to Gepetto 
 Hello 
 And you... time niggas you know where on my level 
 Rather talk to baby girl over there in the yellow 
 I'ma tell her get naked but she can wear the stilettos 
 Got a round jiggly ass but I ain't sharing my jello 
 It's an alien abduction 
 Put her in my spaceship 
 Demeanour of a boss 
 I ain't gotta say shit 
 I just wanna make it 
 Get my new bitch a pair of Sarah Palin fake tits 
 You hear me 
 I'm a long beach nigga 
 Riding down prince y'all 
 Read my bumper sticker it say fuck Russ Limbaugh 
 Got hood credit, the streets is my co-signer 
 I talk shit like Mel Gibson my ghostwriter 
 I'm in the streets tell me where you at 
 Put a hundred killers in front of you I could do that 
 Me and you ain't the same but you knew that 
 If you don't give a fuck throw your middle finger up 
 Real niggas fuck with real niggas, everyday 
 Live niggas fuck with live niggas, everyday 
 Real bitches fuck with real bitches, everyday 
 Live bitches fuck with live bitches, everyday 
 It's just me against the world, soldier on the mainline 
 How can I be militant and ignorant at the same time 
 I love liquor but I hate swine, blame it on the complexities of a great mind 
 I think I'm stuck somewhere inbetween Malcolm X and Detroit Red 
 Still chasing after d-boy bread 
 And I'm hardcore, lay a snitch flatter than that cardboard 
 Sitting underneath the spinning d-boy's... 
 I keep a glock, I be telling degenerates 
 It'll eat you pussies quick as Ellen DeGeneres 
 I mix drinks like a hell of a chemistist 
 If you a bitch nigga you forever my nemesis 
 Killing youths on my itinerary 
 Shouts out to Bun B and Chamillitary 
 I'm a Nas Illmatic nigga, Jay Blueprint nigga, 
 Curtis Jackson with an opinion 52 cent nigga 
 I'm in the streets tell me where you at 
 Put a hundred killers in front of you I could do that 
 Me and you ain't the same but you knew that 
 If you don't give a fuck throw your middle finger up 
 Real niggas fuck with real niggas, everyday 
 Live niggas fuck with live niggas, everyday 
 Real bitches fuck with real bitches, everyday 
 Live bitches fuck with live bitches, everyday 
 I don't live like you, I don't think like you do 
 Mother fuckers say I'm crazy 
 See I grew up in the hood where the cops try to kill a dude 
 Ever since I was a baby 
 And on top of all that these gangbang niggas tripping too, I kept a loaded 380 
 They tried to brainwash me with the curriculum in high school 
 I never let them fools play me 
 C.O.B. I got a religious career, it's the Van Gogh flow nigga lend me your ear 
 Ain't no rally for the feminists, the women are here 
 Pull your cock out quit living in fear 
 Probably see a nigga chilling with a porn star 
 Use her like the all star in my 4 car 
 In other words I only call her when I need help 
 Give me brains while I buckle up my seatbelt 
 That's when she told me she was Glen Berg's daughter 
 Said she couldn't take a molested incest father 
 Get it off your chest bench press harder 
 I gave her a new name called her Princess slaughter 
 Her dad's the devil, she a hottie still 
 Made a mandingo like the way the human body feel 
 Quick question, who embodies guilt 
 If you don't buy my shit up at the illuminati wheel nigga 
 I'm in the streets tell me where you at 
 Put a hundred killers in front of you I could do that 
 Me and you ain't the same but you knew that 
 If you don't give a fuck throw your middle finger up 
 Real niggas fuck with real niggas, everyday 
 Live niggas fuck with live niggas, everyday 
 Real bitches fuck with real bitches, everyday 
 Live bitches fuck with live bitches, everyday.
