What is it all about huh? 
 What the fuck is it about? 
 I'm readin an article and they tryin' to tell me 
 I'm jealous of Kurupt's album droppin' 
 What you mean by that, I want all my niggaz to sell on the West 
 I hope my nigga hit diamond this time 
 I ain't never been a hater nigga 
 It's not my motherfuckin veins boy 
 Real nigga music 
 Do they hate me now 
 'Cause I'm a boss nigga now 
 (Over the Hook) 
 Do you hate me nigga? 
 Yeah, I don't know my nigga 
 I'm still the same nigga 
 Do they hate me now? 
 Yeah, I ain't switched nigga 
 I'm a business man 
 Let's go... 
 How many niggaz wanna know the reason I left from Death Row 
 Right after Suge said I was the Best on the westcoast 
 My pay check over there had me dressing in fresh clothes 
 With jewelry around my neck I was sexing the best hoes 
 Wasn't a damn thang, you can tell me when I spited 
 Rocking the same chain Makaveli represented 
 Ready to aim thangs when it was deadly I was wit it 
 Pistols would Bang Bang I put shellys in Ya fitted 
 Fuck It I frontlined it 
 Got in to beef behind it 
 The comeback, I was blinded 
 The contrack I signed it 
 Whoever was braking bread with me That's who I was aligned with 
 After they did that this cat was one track minded 
 Ride for the label I'm fatal I'm able to disable any unstable finagler 
 Nigga brought to the table 
 4 years later I'm Riding no matter what the cause 
 But it was time to go so I could be my own BOSS MOTHAFUCKA 
 (Hook: Till The End) 
 Do they hate me now 
 'Cause I'm a boss nigga now
