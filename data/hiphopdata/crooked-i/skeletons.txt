I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah) 
 And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah) 
 And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah) 
 Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it 
 I doubt it 
 I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from 
 But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin' 
 Now I'm runnin' from, a somethin' that'll even out my dumb decisions 
 The night I shot and had him bleedin' out his lungs and spittin' 
 Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not 
 'Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen, 
 Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and that thunder hitting 
 So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin' 
 So not a chef but the cocaine forever cookin' 
 I love kids but now I' selling to a pregnant woman 
 Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand, 
 Gun on my waist and, "I don't give a fuck" is my plan. 
 You'll never understand my palm sweat 
 Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet 
 Go on let shorty sing 
 'Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, 
 That's brave enough to tell you everything 
 I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah) 
 And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah) 
 And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah) 
 Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it 
 I doubt it 
 Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock 
 I got skeletons in my closet 
 The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock 
 When will the occupation stop it? Make it a vacant lot 
 The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot 
 And Hope the stowaways go away before the anchor drop 
 Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle drinkin' nutcase 
 Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face 
 I steadily dream about cleanin' these demons out 
 In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout 
 All of your secrets out loud 
 It started as a kid at my school desk 
 Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test 
 Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store 
 And living in an abandoned station wagon cause you was piss poor 
 So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore 
 That's when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor 
 And more came through Crooked I's youth 
 I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth 
 For real, bro 
 I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah) 
 And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah) 
 And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah) 
 Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it 
 I doubt it 
 I thought I had it locked away till forever 
 But no memories fade away, they seem to stay 
 Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams 
 They say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me? 
 See the problem is, I know it all 
 Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all 
 Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there's no remorse 
 Maybe the lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals 
 Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus all 
 We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that's my department 
 Intercity blues cruise and I'm blasting that Marvin 
 Skeletons ain't in my closet, that's my apartment 
 And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments 
 It's all bleak to me 
 Tell my Pop I ain't bothered when he don't speak to me, I love you but it's weak to me 
 On one hand life is short and there's no excuse to do it 
 But you was missing half my life dog, I'm kind of used to it 
 Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don't understand 
 Me against the world, I plan on winning, though I'm under-manned 
 Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint 
 My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent 
 I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah) 
 And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah) 
 And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah) 
 Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it 
 I doubt it 
 I doubt it 
 I doubt it
