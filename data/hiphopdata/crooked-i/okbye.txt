California, you're now rocking with the motherfucking best 
 Crooked I 
 You don't like how I live, ok, bye 
 You don't like getting money, ok, bye 
 You don't like bad chicks, ok, bye 
 Now go that-a way, go that-a way 
 The world hatin' on your boy just yesterday 
 But like I said that was yesterday 'cause hey 
 Eminem signed me to Shady put me on Interscope 
 Then he gave me a rifle so I could put you in a scope 
 Gave me the stamp put the check in the mail 
 Now chicks licking me like an envelope yeah I'm in her throat 
 Crooked about to score I see the red zone 
 All I need is beats by Dre but not the headphones 
 Think I don't live right homie you dead wrong 
 Submarine sandwich I'm just saying my bread long 
 Walk in the club with a gang of East siders 
 Some rappers cool I came to be live-er 
 You claim to be lighters you say you spit flames 
 You a liar damn dawg change your speech writer 
 I'm sideways on the hater keep it pushin 
 Just another Massengill pussy who need a douchin 
 I'm looking for a round ass I need a cushion 
 I love it when they tell me daddy I need a whoopin 
 You don't like how I live, ok, bye 
 You don't like getting money, ok, bye 
 You don't like bad chicks, ok, bye 
 Now go that-a way, go that-a way 
 You don't like how I do it, ok, bye 
 You don't like that I'm hood, ok, bye 
 You don't like that I'm me, ok, bye 
 Now go that-a way, go that-a way 
 I'll be keeping it real because I am real 
 Yeah some of y'all eating good, but it's your last meal 
 You the king of the hill but it's an ant hill 
 I kick it over you over tell me how that feels 
 It's not an arrogant thing I got a stable of lyrics 
 And I'll be pimping this pen like Sean Garrett and Dream 
 If these songs was hoes I'd have a harem like an Arabic king 
 So beware my team yep 
 So many wolves you ain't got nothing for me 
 Nowadays all that champagne popping be looking corny 
 We got the bitches on Hennessey getting horny 
 And they ain't thinking of leaving till 6 in the morning 
 Yeah they love fuckin' with us 
 Let them do what they do you be cuffing 'em tough 
 See you Greyhound luggage when it comes to the sluts 
 'Cause they're gon throw you under the bus boy 
 As long as I hustle hard money gon come with ease 
 And it's child's play call it Chuck E. Cheese 
 Wanna do it like me go sell a couple keys and a ton of weed 
 Then run the street with a hundred G's 
 Goons that is they comin' out the woodwork 
 I would work but that ain't how the hood work 
 I'm trying to take over the game, B.I.G. and Pac style 
 Labels try to drop my old shit 'cause I'm hot now 
 But oh shit you should stop now 
 Try to play me on some ho shit I'll shut your block down 
 Dirty magazines tell you what my clique bout 
 Cause Playboy we some Hustlers in a Penthouse 
 Louis bag full of paper let my chick count 
 She flyer than a double summersault dismount 
 Then she swear to God Crooked gonna dog her out 
 I got a bad rep 'cause I'm from Slaughterhouse
