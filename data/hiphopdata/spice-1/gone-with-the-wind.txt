*Coughing* damn! 
 Standing here brings back a gang of memories, man 
 Sitting on this old block 
 All the violence and drugs you know 
 But I lived through it 
 Get this shit on, yeah nigga, you and them 
 Motherfuckers 
 Rest in player pieces my niggas 
 Blaaow! 
 Innocent bystanders be laying up in the streets 
 In the concrete jungle where real niggas be packing heat 
 Leaving your insides exposed to the witnesses walking by 
 Here today and gone tomorrow my nigga, we born to die 
 Keep your eyes open partner, ain't no rules in this shit 
 My nigga died with three kids and a wife, ain't that a bitch 
 I can't go clubbing because I'm thugging with some g's for real 
 I see some niggas at the party, then I'm subject to kill 
 Keep my head over the water, uzi in the stash 
 Niggas try to wet me up that's why I dumped on they ass 
 I had a homey named 'money' now he's r.i.p 
 Niggas set him and killed him for some key's and g's 
 I don't know why they fuck did it, niggas plotting and scheme 
 That's why you can never be blind to a broke man's dream 
 Because see I'm losing it. I can't take it. I miss my peers 
 Talk to my nigga, makaveli. he's been dead for two years 
 Episodes of divine intervention, invade my mind 
 Got me thinking, 'damn I could've been dead, a couple times' 
 Killer pits and extra clips, around my bed when I sleep 
 Stash my glock under my pillow, twenty gauge by my feet 
 Sitting on my old block reminiscing again 
 For my homies dead and gone in the wind 
 Gone with the wind, gone with the wind 
 Gone with the wind, gone with the wind 
 Sitting on my old block reminiscing again 
 Put the fire to the blunt, take a sip of the hen 
 Sitting on my old block reminiscing again 
 On my homies dead, gone with the wind 
 Gone with the wind 
 (2x) 
 Too many niggas smile in my face and back stab 
 I'm left throwing niggas in the trunk and kidnap 
 Thugging and loving bitches obsessed with this mob shit 
 Niggas thinking they moving 
 And bailing out the cut with the quickness 
 Suckers be blind to this real shit, we bring the pain 
 Bossalini, fetty chico, shiznilti still in the game 
 Immortalized forever, having my homies up in the grave 
 Thinking back on when I used to drank yac in my younger days 
 Bust the twelve gauge shotty, too young to buy liquor 
 Little bad ass niggas grew up to be mob figures 
 Living life on a razor; cars, money and bitches 
 Niggas plotting to kill us, coming in coupes in a milli's 
 We go to war till they feel us, bury they ass on the realest 
 (Not sure what is said) eliminate you for scrilla 
 Niggas dying on the frontline 
 Spending most of they life ducking the one time, no sunshine 
 In the world of sin, from the gutter to the pen 
 Got me swimming in the game with a brim on my shark's fin 
 Sitting on my old block reminiscing again 
 For my homies dead and gone in the wind 
 Gone with the wind 
 I ain't no bitch but if you bone me I'm coming 
 Running double trying to murder something 
 Eyes red and heart pumping 
 Serving niggas out the back of the caddy 
 Hitting corners, 
 Ain't no love for you snitch ass niggas in California 
 Ducking suckers and shady bitches, scheming to gaffle riches 
 Niggas living fictitious, running game and selling fishes 
 Paranoia of surveillance vans watching me close 
 Nigga (?) dreams died back in '94 
 Suckers laid down my homey, I just had to get off 
 Can't be acting like no bitch nigga, because war is raw 
 They say nice guys finish last and the good die young 
 Too many real niggas put to death by the hand of the gun 
 Sitting on my old block reminiscing again 
 On my homies dead and gone in the wind 
 Gone with the wind, gone with the wind 
 Gone with the wind, gone with the wind 
 Gone with the wind
