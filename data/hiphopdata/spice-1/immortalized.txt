 Worldwide worldwide immortalized 
 Worldwide immortalized 
 Smokin' endo with my killaz we ride 
 Heat on the side 
 Hella drama niggaz die 
 In crossfire can't let 'em slide 
 See the rigormortis set in his eyes 
 Nigga surprise 
 You was dumped on by some G'z on the rise 
 It shocked yo ass when I pulled out the chrome 
 I was putting niggaz in the tank before this rap shit came along 
 Immortalized through this thug shit that niggas are spittin' 
 A chocolate philly a bag of sticky green and a game to spit 
 We on the mash 
 Put a slug in niggas stoppin' my cash 
 Mothafuckas wanna see me 6 feet in the grave 
 Thinking I won't last 
 But I'm a soldier I told you bitches know what the fuck 
 The only way I'm fallin' is slippin on one of you nigga's blood 
 I'm in this shit for life and when my casket drop 
 Then my thug presence be immortalized like Biggie and Pac 
 Hear my shit thump in nigga's trunks for blocks and blocks 
 Immortal thug shit'll never stop 
 Immortalized 
 I can't believe je-a-jealous niggas don't wanna se-e-see me rise 
 Thuggin' in the caddy the-they got me thu-a-thuggin' worldwide 
 Eternal mobbin immortalized worldwide 
 One thug to the niggaz like eazy-e soldiers who put a dent in the game 
 It ain't the same 
 Candy coated niggaz claiming the fame 
 (????) My brain 
 This thug shit'll drive a nigga insane 
 Diamond links and chains 
 With infra red we aim 
 Niggas loced up for the cash when the real G'z came 
 Thu-a-thuggin' laced up in my veins 
 I can't be changed 
 Immortalized like dead presidents with they faces on rocks 
 Ebonic sleazy is the language for the game that we chop 
 Green leaves 
 Canibus satives and kryss style 
 50 Gs making niggaz bleed with pistols 
 Put it down 
 'Cause it ain't no time for fuckin' around 
 If a nigga wants to see 6 figures enough no less we platinum bound 
 Remember me the man with the 50 cal in my hand 
 Coming more savage than Tarzan 
 Hear what I'm saying 
 Niggas picking up on my casket but I ain't sweatin you haters 
 'Cause if it wasn't for bitch ass niggas it wouldn't be real players 
 Represent to the fullest at the same time dodging bullets 
 This mob shit ain't easy nigga but somebody got to do it 
 Immortalized 
 Never die just multiply 
 Thug niggas immortalized 
 Energize like them batteries 
 Caught up in the mob life 
 Niggaz be talking that crazy shit when they don't know what the fuck they sayin' 
 Making money off rap music when you was in elementary playin' 
 It's all real 
 Shoot back at niggas shooting to kill 
 Well if its fuck my life its fuck yo life go to war with steel 
 If you niggas ain't feeling me fuck yo clique and yo hood 
 It's Bossalini straight soldier never went Hollywood 
 Always riding through the streets hitting corners with felons 
 In a bucket or a benzo when we blast it ain't no tellin' 
 It's west side till my life expire 
 Mobb music till the wheels fall off mothafucker we all ride 
 Put the fire to the endo sip on the Henn 
 Cause you will never see a bad guy like this one again 
 Put it on you niggas with no mask on 
 Straight smash if it wasn't for rappin' I'd be jackin gettin' my blast on
