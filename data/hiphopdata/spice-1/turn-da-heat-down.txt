(Spice 1) 
 [Verse one] {:14} 
 Dear lord, could you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now, the block is hot 
 I hear the street demons callin 
 Playin' Russian roulette 
 With thug nature, sky fallin' 
 Don't wanna die broke and alone, smokin' a zone 
 With the homies in the car strapped up 
 With a vest on, lord please tell Lucifer 
 He need to turn the heat down 
 'Cause I'm convinced that hell is up on these streets now 
 The hood is on fire, niggas comin' up short (short) 
 Ashphalt burnin the sole of my jordans (jordans) 
 How long will I mourn my homies is gettin' shot 
 Not even mommys tears cool the drama or not 
 Just gettin' hotter, my homies can't take it anymore 
 Sick and tired of bein broke stressed and poor 
 Enemies, wanna murder me at 3000 degrees 
 Wanna catch me on my paper route scoutin for cheese 
 Turn the heat down 
 Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, I'm feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now 
 Underneath my feet now, feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}

 [Verse two] {1:22} 
 It's been a long ass road, for me and my dogs 
 Late nights is cold and day times is hard 
 And everyday is a test, and god must be the teacher 
 Hatin' ass niggas, make me travel with my heater 
 And Satan been waitin, on a nigga like me 
 Since the day I was born homie I knew it was on 
 Daddy gone, and now I'm left to raise myself 
 The devil playin' games with me, got me lustin for wealth 
 So me and my homies went out to get it, no matter what 
 The lord I know it's wrong, but somebody gettin' touched 
 And I can feel the flame, everyday I'm in the game 
 My homie died in vain, so now we ride in his name 
 Are we goan ball or die, put it all on the line 
 Get this money man, make 'em haters wanna shine 
 For makaveli, killer khadafi the prince 
 May the lord bless your soul nigga, till the very end 
 Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, I'm feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now 
 Underneath my feet now, feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x} 
 [Verse three] {2:30} 
 Although you hate to be broke, even smoke with the folk 
 Made alot of money dropped alot on the floor 
 Did alot of shit I never done before 
 Fucked alot of hoes never paid they cardinal 
 Always blast first when it comes to this woe 
 Its in my bloodline plus my daddy done it before 
 You never seen hardtimes why you fakin it for 
 You never seen another nigga with his brains on the floor 
 I think it's all for me to figure why you hatin' me for 
 But then again I'm one of them motherfuckers that do shit broke 
 And then again I'm one of them niggas that'll eat off the floor 
 And I got pool massive blood what you askin me for 
 And you don't need what you think you do 
 And you don't really wanna die but I huck you through 
 Its gettin' hotter on the streets tryin' to kill who snitchin 
 And if you can't stand the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen 
 Its gettin' hotter nigga (punk ass nigga, outlawz shit bitch) 
 Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, I'm feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now 
 Underneath my feet now, feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x} 
 [Verse four] {3:39} 
 Livin' life hot to death we stop the press 
 Stop to, catch my breath and count who left 
 You see this black rain pourin, they wanna see us prehistoric 
 You wanna see me in the county or the corener's 
 There's angels with me, so I can never give up 
 Makaveli trained soldier, just aim and bust 
 From my mental that is, with a pencil that is 
 Known got a old soul like he been to the bid 
 Lil' wayne wasn't lyin', the block is scorchin 
 What gotta kill a cop just to stop the torture 
 Watch the roads cause there really ain't nobody to trust 
 A outlaw till I die you better ride wit us 
 We stand firm in the flame watch the face to burn 
 I get a blast from the past when the pain return 
 Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, I'm feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now 
 Dear lord, can you please tell Lucifer 
 Turn the heat down, I'm feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now, underneath my feet now 
 Underneath my feet now, feelin' the flames of hell 
 Underneath my feet now {repeat 1x}
