 Nik-nak paddy wack, give a G a gat 
 Whippin' up on that ass it's the 187 Fac 
 Spiggity One whippin' up on that ass look what I got that's quick to blast 
 Blowin' 'em up on they back as I sm-a-smash 
 Runnin' up and down the block with a fo'-five pistol up in my lap 
 And niggas be comin' up short when I cap 
 And I leave they ass in a zipped up sack, player 
 So don't be steppin' to these G's 
 The Faculty got me bizzack we strim that with Uzi's 
 So what the fuck you wanna do? 
 Leave your ass in a motherfuckin' coma fool 
 Peelin' a cap back, Red Rum Fac as I jack these niggas 
 Niggas put your motherfuckin' fingers on a triggers 
 G-Nut, (what up fool?) since your ready to blast (ha ha) 
 Pull out my your shit and put a cap in they ass nigga 
 Well it's the G-the-N-you-T, all you haters envy me 
 So check it, 'cause I'ma 'bout to wreck it for the ninety-fo' 
 Roll a couple rhyme to get my crippin' up the par 
 Now when I cock the hammer bro I'm shootin' for the stars 
 And I don't give a fuck who you be G 
 Cause whoever you are, it ain't no way in the world you can be me 
 I'm comin' from the haystack, way back where they grow, froze 
 Up or on the other that I wonder if the bowl knows that I ducks this 
 'Cause I loves this, one eight seven roughness 
 Yeah it's the Nut bitch the nappy that you stuck with 
 So Din Fin is you ready to blast? (What up my nigga?) 
 Slip in the clip and put a slug in that ass 
 If I don't grab that shit and poppin' who gon' pop first? 
 The nigga that'll make your face burst 
 Or worthless I can be packed up in the first side of my hearse (comin' with dirt) 
 'Cause I'm all alone and my clip ain't killin' the niggas that jump 
 I pumps two sick of his side of his chest and dumpin' him in a truck 
 No pistol blister fuckin' that nigga since I dump him a realer ditch 
 Pullin' all my glock clockin' and unload clippin' when that nigga twitch 
 Better wear a vest I'm aimin' at head and puttin' your ass to rest 
 Pump test or Mack with a bigger gat that'll penetrate your vest 
 Their naffy government causin' trouble when I'm bubblin' 
 Smokin' bomb and kickin' it with my niggas on thai but who be bubblin' 
 So Frank J if you ready to blast (you know the rules) 
 Load up your gat and bust a cap in that ass 
 Frankly forty-seven for the nine-fo' fuckin' him up 
 Recruit when I rap like that with a funky rhyme flow 
 And if you can't feel me then just kill me for this weak shit 
 Oh no, never that, oh I finna freak this 
 So peep this corner risin' game I finna spit 
 And if you still can't feel me then I might have to spit a zip 
 Cause niggas like me be breakin' a bitch 
 Rippin' and strivin' a person could have been much more worse 
 Per man with the man even the man they live in a hearse 
 'Cause I would've murdered first 
 Livin' a fast life stickin' up tricks, kickin' at nigga's dolls 
 All those who oppose to the Fac they will be disposed 
 Openin' up your motherfuckin' chest with one of these hollow tips 
 It'll be whistlin' Dixy to your ass when this hollow hit 
 Nik-nak paddy wack, give a G a gat 
 Whippin' up on that ass it's the 187 Fac 
 Nik-nak paddy wack, give a G a gat

 Here comes a nigga like the coolest out to get respect and snappin' necks 
 Creepin' with the Tech a nigga known to leave a bloody mess 
 The sickest motherfucker with the loadest clip 
 And ready to empty the clip into the hip of the nigga talkin' shit 
 I gots to creep low and stay low and let these motherfuckers know 
 When the Tech's ? a nigga hates to see the murder show 
 The figgity Fac is in the fuckin' house and that's the fuckin' truth 
 Now tell me how it feels to be that one eighty seven fuckin' proof 
 Sittin' on the roof with my Tech-Nine bustin' for my help 
 With so many shots in your ass I'll make the fuckin' clip melt 
 (? (Who?) since you ready to blast nigga 
 Get on the mic and put a cap in that ass),-> Spice 1

 Never known for pushin' crack and re-askin' causin' headaches in your family 
 Baggin' up my rocks makin' money, niggas can't fade the 187 Faculty 
 We be pumpin' thug niggas extra clip, bill is fill to his capacity 
 Makin' stacks of g's ain't no turnin' back 
 Sippin' on some new Con Jack I watch my old gat 
 Into beat you to retaliate you fucked 
 Suckin' up ? from inside your fuckin' casket is your next lunch 
 So hear the church bells jingle, I'm comin' out the gut strapped 
 Raunchy black like the season? 
 With the blower burnin' gun smoke my self defence 
 And greedy grease and bloody feet will left the evidence 
 It's pitiful, I'm smokin' on some wonderful shit 
 Gonna have you rollin' with your strap bustin' caps in your vehicle

 Quick to fill my pockets with your cash and bust a cap in that ass nigga
