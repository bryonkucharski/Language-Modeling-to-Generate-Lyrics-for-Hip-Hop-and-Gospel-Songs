 If foes try to jack I'ma blast three 
 Run the fourth nigga over with the caddy 
 Had he not known about the Mac Daddy 
 Slug happy that's born to die 
 Ask why 
 You niggas be out there thinkin' you can't ever be touched on 
 Close your eyes and click your Filas and I'm gon' send you home 
 On a one-way mission to CP Bannon 
 My cannon is made for killin' 
 Nigga caught up in this mob shit and this drug dealin' 
 I'm tellin' my momma don't want to be no statistic 
 But realistically I've got my enemies scared shitless 
 All of my homies is killas 
 Surrounded daily by the real niggas 
 With finger-trigs you dig? We big 
 Nigga duck if you want to live 
 Cause it ain't no name on them bullets 
 Murderers be dishin 
 You wishin you never got caught up in my gunplay 
 You shoulda listened 
 Now it's too late ain't no turnin' back 
 Nigga you done started this 
 I told you once before my trigger gots no heart at this 
 Now shall I proceed to blow your head up off your spinal cord 
 Cause niggas that fuck around with my click is gonna come up short 
 Them come up short in the ghetto them die where them lay 
 This is how we live and die up in the Bay

 Remember the real niggas down for the killin' 
 And ain't no remorse for you suckas 
 Ruckus is caused when the chrome is exposed 
 To you niggas, leaving your body froze 
 Your flesh is freezin you wheezin 
 Paramedics can't stop the bleedin 
 You seein your life before your eyes 
 You hate you leavin' 
 Shoulda thought before you pulled the trigger 
 That's the bitch in you 
 Recognize realize that all our trigger fingers itchy too 
 See we on some old mob shit 
 Everybody guilty of somethin' 
 That's why when one dumpin, we all pumpin 
 Tryin' to kill us somethin' 
 Vacate the facilities when we bailin up in yo' shit 
 Cause the pistol grips 
 Make bigger holes then them fuckin' hollow tips 
 You fuckin' with a soldier 
 Ain't nobody told ya 
 You funkin with niggas that's known for killin' niggas 
 Over and over this is my gunplay 
 Cops ain't nothin' but the Klan undercover
