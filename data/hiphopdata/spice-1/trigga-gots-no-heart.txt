* Also appears on the Menace II Society soundtrack 
 The trigga gots no heart (the trigga a trigga) 
 <Repeat> 
 I'm sick up in this game 
 I'll take no secondary shorts & 
 Slam dunk these riddles up in yo' chest like Jordan 
 Menace II Society mad man killer 
 Just call me the East Bay Gangsta 
 Neighborhood drug dealer 
 Quick to make decisions & I'm 
 Quick to get my blast on 
 Do a 187 with this bloody Jason mask on 
 Rollin' up out the cut deeper than Atlantis 
 Tore his chest apart left his heart on the canvas 
 Now I gots mo' mayo than the rest of the pushers 
 Rat a tat tat tat came my Tec from the bushes 
 I blast with no heart 'cause I'm heartless in nine-trey 
 A-K blast on that ass if in my way, gangsta 
 Slangin' 'Cola since the very very start 
 Much love for this game so the trigga gots no heart 
 Ain't no love trick 
 The trigga gots no heart 
 <Repeat> 
 (Gunshot) 
 Release the trigga as I blast on a nigga 
 Nina put a cease on his Timex ticker 
 And uh playas he can't give me no love 
 'Cause I'm stuck on the corna in the ghetto 
 Slangin' dub sacks 
 And I duck when they fly by 
 'Cause Killa Cali' is the state for the drive-by 
 Caps peel from the gangstas in my hood 
 Ya better use that nina 
 'Cause that deuce-deuce ain't no good 
 And umm I'm taking up a hobby 
 Maniac murderin' doin' massacre robbery 
 I'm twenty-two & I'm still slangin' dub sacks 
 I gives the fiend some love but ain't no love back 
 Much love in this game ain't no love gangsta 
 187 is a art 'cause the trigga gots no heart 
 Ain't no love trick 
 The trigga gots no heart 
 Ain't no love trick 
 Me shootin' him up me shootin' him up 
 If he no give my pay 
 Ain't no love trick 
 <Repeat> 
 The trigga gots no heart 
 And I'll be damned if I'm broke old 
 Pushin' on a shoppin' cart 
 They blast on a friend of me 
 Another sad case of a mistaken identity 
 12 O' clock and my 'hood's dubbin' pay back 
 I sat and watched them shoot my homey 
 Seen his face crack 
 Uzis spray like Raid on these cockroaches 
 A dropped bomb full of 187 soldiers 
 Doin' dirt 'cause we dirty when the trigga pull 
 Seventeen in his body left the boy full 
 Of hollow tips so I know he won't be comin' back 
 I let my hair platt and let my mail stack 
 But my sweet sweet Sunday had to turn tart 
 His posse came and they triggas had no heart 
 Me kill all man say kill all man say 
 Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock 
 Kill all man say kill all man say 
 Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock 
 Kill all man say kill all man say 
 Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock 
 Yeah mon blam! The 187 fact 
 Is back in the house man for nine-trey 
 This here see kill a man wit me Glock 
 BLOW! 187 thousand G
