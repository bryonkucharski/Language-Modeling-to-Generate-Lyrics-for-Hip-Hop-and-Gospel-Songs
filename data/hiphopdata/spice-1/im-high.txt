Chorus: I'm high (repeat 6X) 
 S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and crawl 
 Pull up the vega make it fat nigga got the crush nasty for a playa 
 Purple Haze got me hittin the switches and rollin' bats up 
 With some niggaz who don't want to put the gats up 
 I'm high till I kick the bucket 
 Fuck it, throw some blunts on my coffin and I'll 
 Smoke it with the dead niggas 
 Light it up like the Fourth of July 
 Type of chronic make a dead nigga wake up high 
 I get tired and ? pussy 
 And niggaz know I got to smoke about half ounce, before I flow 
 It ain't no ? in my zig-zag, I roll my blunt 
 There ain't no weed in the studio, we on a hunt 
 To get the sticky ass green shit, shut 'em down 
 You can find a little chron' spot in every town 
 Nigga sell a twenty ten sacks up on the block 
 Break the doobies in the ashtray down to roll a chopper 
 I'm addicted to the THC, gettin' fucked up 
 Leave your doobies around they gettin' sucked up 
 Lungs like a motherfuckin vacuum cleaner 
 Mobbin on the fine Betty's smokin' out the Beamer 
 Just call me Dr. Bomb from the Bay 
 Hit ya in the chest with the chron like an A.K. 
 Kick back lay back and throw them feet up 
 Sometimes I wanna roll, a whole fuckin' tree up 
 I break it down, halves and O's 
 Smoking mold in a broke down sixty-four 
 And ain't no nigga in the world that can outsmoke me 
 The muthafuckin chronic addict S-P-I-C-E 
 Bill Clinton hit the chronic and he didn't inhale 
 But I'm gonna cough a fuckin' lung up for niggaz in jail 
 Smokin' pot before twelve, ain't no secret to my homies 
 Step the fuck in your face with the smell of chronic on me 
 It抯 the C-H-R-O-N-I-C 
 ? With ? about a quarter to three 
 About to loc the fuck up 'cause the Fed hit the weed zone 
 And niggaz tryin' to sell me backyard homegrown 
 I need the motherfuckin bomb break down the bail 
 Roll it up in a fat ass chocolate zail 
 Mr. Endo smoked 'em all 
 Which every nigga hit the joint, cough, gag and crawl 
 Suckin in weed smoke with my nose 
 Hit the joint ten seconds hold it in for twenty-four 
 It's puff puff pass 
 Nigga quit fuckin' the weed or I'ma bank on your bitch ass
