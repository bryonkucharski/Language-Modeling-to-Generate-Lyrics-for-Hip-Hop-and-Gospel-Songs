Intro: Ant Banks, Shorty-B 
 Hey, we tapin', all right let's do this shit 
 Yo Ant Banks man tell me about your boy Spice 
 Man, the boy ain't nuttin nice, you know what I'm sayin' 
 That's the idea man, it's done 
 Hey check it out boy we fittin' ta do this shit Shorty-B 
 I want you to get on the god damn guitar, 
 Fittin' ta lay a funky ass beat 
 And my boy gonn' come tight you know what I'm sayin' 
 That's all it take ya know, 
 So we fittin' ta do this shit and get paid like a mutha fucka 
 Spice kick it 
 Verse 1: Spice 1 
 187 is fuckin' it up 'cause we be blowsin' 
 Takin' out weak mutha fuckas wit the explosion 
 I put my finger on trigger and he was rolled up 
 Was it my nine, my nigga that had him fold up 
 I kep' on bustin' and bustin' and cappin' cappin' y'all 
 Until I emptied the clip out 'cause I was snappin' y'all 
 The was the S-P-I-C-E-187 the murda 
 I put the nine in my pocket all of a sudden I heard a 
 Siren, A-K shots firin' 
 It was the fuzz so I figured the room was wired an' 
 Broke out the backdoor because the backdoor was open 
 So when the cop told me freeze, Yo he fuckin' gotta be jokin' 
 Fuck all the bullshit, I'm poppin' two in the brain 
 Was it a 187 or just a ghetto thang 
 Chorus: Ant Banks 
 Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x2) 
 "Ah yeah, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Hey Spice do that shit nigga" 
 Verse 2: Spice 1 
 A be for acres and J be likely ta jack 
 By the Faculty mutha fucka for short it's the Fac 
 Blast, like a hurricane and blow out you fuckin' brains 
 I can't be tamed I'm insane to the membrane 
 Doper than D-boys, B-l-a-s-t toys 
 Wanna get static then homie you can just bring the noise 
 Spice 1'll put the vision in black, can you fuck wit that 
 You know I like the funky rata-tata-tat-tat 
 Of a U-Z-I, cause it sound fly 
 When your sayin' die mother fucker die 
 S-P-I C-E and wit the Faculty 
 A quarterback throwin' a rhyme now could you tackle me 
 Boy, you must'a had an almond joy 
 Huh, this ain't no child's play I'm worse than Chuckie he' a toy 
 Chorus: Ant Banks 
 Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x2) 
 "Shorty-B break it down homie 
 Ah yeah, you know what I'm sayin', it ain't nuttin' but a" 
 Ghetto thang, ghetto thang 
 "Shorty-B is in the house, hey yo Spice 
 Bring the dope shit right about now" 
 Verse 3: Spice 1 
 Well it's the mutha fuckin' S the P the I the C-E 
 Not in a homocide nigga you might as well be 
 Lifestyles of ruthless, thought he was juicey and tried to juice this 
 Fuck wit the posse but yo was useless 
 Can't stop the jack of the fuckin' Fac 
 The bum rush'll crush a mutha fuckas back 
 Spice 1 comin' straight outta Alkatraz 
 Wit a posse that'll probably fuck up the task 
 A lot of niggas try ta step to the murderism 
 But all they get is a mutha fuckin' circumcis'm 
 The 187 the Fac comin' right and exact 
 You got a static you phoned, you better call me back 
 'Cause I don't sucker round, nor do I fuck around 
 And you can tell this by the mangled body stuck around 
 Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x4) 
 "This shit is on in the '91 
 Out this muther fucker 
 Do that shit homie 
 Ah yeah Ant Banks is in tha mutha fuckin' house 
 Spice 1 is takin' over shit in the '91 boy 
 Triad records is in the house 
 Ant Banks is in the house, Shorty-B is in the muther fuckin' house 
 And we out the mutha fuckin' house 
 For all those muther fuckers who didn't know"
