 A skinny ass neva had a penny ass nigga

 'Cause niggaz they tryin' ta take my head 
 I can't have shit if a nigga dead 
 So I bust back 
 And break the bitch niggaz off propa 
 With a four-four take nine a chopper 
 And try and decapatate a niggaz arms from with his shoulders 
 These jealous niggaz don't know they fuckin' around with a soldier

 So nigga don't wait for me ta fall 
 And if I got enough 
 A hallow tip will smoke æem all, y'all 
 Envious niggaz prepare to fly off ya feet 
 'Cause I'm commin' with some mutha fuckin' heat 
 Playa, so keep ya aim straight 
 And hit a nigga on tha first shot 
 'Cause I'm a be tryin' ta make your mutha fuckin' heart stop 
 And don't be screamin' out for your family bitch 
 'Cause it was your choice 
 That we jump into this gangsta shit
