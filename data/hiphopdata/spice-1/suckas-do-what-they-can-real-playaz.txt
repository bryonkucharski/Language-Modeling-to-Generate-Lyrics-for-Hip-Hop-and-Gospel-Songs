(Intro: roger troutman) 
 Spice 1 
 Too $hort, yup 
 Said I'm a real playa, yeah 
 Real playa 
 Playa 
 Playa... 
 (Verse 1: too $hort) 
 Whoever try to buy a new benz, spend money on your friends 
 Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends 
 Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler 
 For the last 12 years I could never get enough of 
 That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch 
 Have you ever seen it? a big pile of green shit? 
 When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man 
 I do what I want, suckers do what they can 
 That's why I moved to the a, straight from the bay 
 I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway 
 And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck 
 I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up 
 Nothin' half on my business, keep gettin' paid 
 If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day 
 When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks 
 Let these gold-diggin bitches count my spokes 
 Short dog in the house 
 (Chorus: roger troutman) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Real playaz) 
 Suckaz do what they can 
 (Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha) (what they can do) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Yeah, real playaz)

 (Yukmouth) (yukmeezy) (thugged out) (fo' sheezy) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 Real thugz gon' hustlin 
 (Verse 2: yukmouth) 
 Hop in the ranger rover, mob, thrustin this out my car 
 Shit better be hard, ghetto celebrity star 
 Smoke 'dro out of jelly jars 
 Boss to be fraud, catch me at the telly with broads 
 Havin' ménage-? trois, x-ed out on the celly with todd 
 "Short dog, what's up? " he told me roger troutman passed 
 I hollered, my shit about to crash 
 Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass 
 Damn! poppin' crystal, poured me a glass 
 Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass 
 This's for my nigga roger, the godfather of futuristic funk 
 Here's the ganja, get it crunk 
 Twist the skunk, hit it once 
 And keep that shit movin and 
 Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin' 
 I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, jags and 6's 
 To droppin' a solo album that's sellin more than the last shit did 
 I got the streets and ave's addicted 
 ? ? ? Swiss accounts, drunk as fuck in the stretch narrow strippers 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Real playaz) 
 Suckaz do what they can 
 (Real playaz) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Plow!) 
 No time for strugglin 
 (Ha-ha-ha-ha, thugged out, fool) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Real playaz) 
 Suckaz do what they can 
 (Check it out, nigga) 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Plow!) 
 Real thugz gon' hustlin 
 (Verse 3: spice 1) 
 I've come from more bounce to the ounce to short dog and roger troutman 
 Yukmouth, we thugged out for the money and all the power 
 Real niggas do what they want to, suckers do what the fuck they can 
 Self-ma-made-mu-muthafuckin-man 
 Poppin' my collar, li-livin' the hustler's dream 
 Ballers fiend for cream, pockets bust out the seams 
 Franklin and grant is my dogs, I die for em 
 (Die for em) c-cry, lie, ride for 'em (ride for em) 
 Nigga, I know you heard it through the grapevine 
 I was out here doin' it way too live 
 Doin' way too much, I'm tryin' to touch 40 million bucks 
 And flip a jet with some ? ? ?, about 14 
 Flop through your hood, bumpin this shit, smokin' sticky green 
 Thugs be hustlin, muggin and puttin' muscle in 
 No time for strugglin, keep your mind on bubblin 
 You can't see me through websites, but I still got 'computer love' 
 For my nigga roger troutman, 'cause he was ridin' with real thugs 
 Nigga 
 Real playaz do what they want to 
 (Immortalized) 
 Suckaz do what they can 
 (Real thugs) 
 Real playaz do what they want to
