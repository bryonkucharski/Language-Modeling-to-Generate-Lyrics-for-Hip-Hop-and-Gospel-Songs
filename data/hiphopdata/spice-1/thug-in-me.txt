Yeah, I heard niggas out here talking major shit you dig 
 But ain't no motherfucker step to me and said "Spice you a punk" 
 Cause you know I whup his motherfuckin' ass 
 Niggas be muggin' me, Don't show no love for me 
 Don't playa hate me love tha thug in me 
 Now when I walk on by, niggas be muggin' me 
 Don't playa hate me love tha thug in me 
 Now if your hoe come knockin' at my door, she 
 Must want a thug ass nigga for sure 
 'Cause it's the young playa Spiz-ice and I be stacking my paper 
 Twenty four motherfuckin' seven, a nigga havin' it major 
 Now we can do this like playas 
 Or we can hop into some gangsta shit 
 Niggas be tryin' to clown, when your bailin' with your bitch 
 I almost fell, gettin' up out the car but see 
 I had to pistol whip the nigga because he knows who we are 
 We the niggas with the Lex's, Rolexes laced up with diamonds 
 Timer, Timer, Baller, Baller 
 She fucked with the shot caller now 
 Didn't need no scrilla to get her, she want a thug nigga 
 Poppin' collars, and at the same time clockin' dollars 
 Real as they come I got soldiers ready to rob at night 
 And when a nigga goes to your jar you don't attempt to fight 
 You playa hate daily, talkin' the shit on the ace 
 But you a bitch 'cause you never talk the shit to my face 
 I put the pedal to the metal and uh jump the Chevy 
 Heavy in the game 
 But about four five different ghetto names 
 I can't be tamed I'm a G to my heart 
 I can't be changed I've been breaking these niggas down from the start 
 I'm hearing shit up in the streets man, niggas is crazy 
 I've been serving them dope fiends on that block 
 Since you was babies 
 And the world is yours, nigga you can have it all 
 But if you talk bad on this G ass nigga you'll take a fall, blaow 
 How many hoes want a nigga that get his ass kicked 
 Car took, whupped and jacked ain't got no get back 
 I ain't the type to let no nigga jack me 
 Baby we cool if they run up on the Caddy 
 I'm off the Hennessy, when it's me she's callin' right back 
 I'm up in the Benzo on the mobile spittin' the game off the yack 
 I'm strapped with two blacks, 'cause I ain't the baller 
 Who be out there slippin' 
 She understands niggas be playa hatin' so she ain't trippin' 
 Saggy pants G-braids but nigga still out to get paid 
 I'm keepin' my mind up on my money and all my money is made 
 Shadetree niggas be tryin' to get in my mix 
 Conflicts, forty caliber cliques when I be burying tricks 
 She seen me knock niggas out now I do walk bys 
 Now I put faulty ass niggas between them chalk lines 
 See everybody be lookin' when I be bailin', trailin' indo smoke 
 See it ain't nothing but the smooth sailin' 
 And now I kick back and enjoy my riches on a sunny day 
 But sucka ass niggas be all up in my way 
 You're secure don't you worry 'bout a thang 
 I got these two twin glocks and when they cocked this is what they say
