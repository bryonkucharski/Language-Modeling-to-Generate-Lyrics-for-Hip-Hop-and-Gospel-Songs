Verse One: Spice-1 
 Born to die but hard to kill, a buh-buh-ballin ass timer 
 Blow a hole up in your chest like the fuckin' Una-Bomber 
 Your arms still bleedin fifty feet from your body 
 Your 40 ounce threw way back to the other side of the party 
 You was fuckin' with a killa, your potnahs tried to tell you 
 But you didn't listen, now your whole chest missin' in action 
 'Cause I'm kidnappin motherfucker's souls 
 Leavin' holes in they bodies when they go 
 I pops out the motherfuckin Chevy 350 ragtop 
 Still bustin' down the fuckin' block, the killin' don't stop 
 We regulate the co-kayana in a hoggish manna 
 It's like you fuckin' with the man-a, Tony Montana 
 We sent some killas, to murda all the ones you love 
 Chainsaw your motherfuckin ass up in the bathtub 
 Another murda, another fucked up day 
 Some more drama, fucked in the Dirty Bay 
 Chorus: Spice-1 
 Sittin' on the dock of the dirty bay, waitin for my yeah) 
 I might have to use my ak 
 (Repeat 2X, vary 3rd = that AK, repeat) 
 Verse Two: Spice-1 
 I back for these keys, if they ain't have me what they got (break yoself nigga) 
 I'm dealin' these motherfuckers on top, sieze on the spot 
 Waitin another thirty minutes for these punk ass niggaz 
 And when they roll up and get out they ride 
 I'ma get out, you stay inside 
 And if you happen to see some killin' nigga don't go into shock 
 Betta hop out with two chops tied together with your dirty socks 
 Cause livin' up in the bay we gone have a split up in it 
 And your memory and corpse with shit up in it 
 Niggaz seein signs of overkill, yeah you did 
 But niggaz still kicked him in his motherfuckin head 
 But a cop with a donuts busted my choppa in the air 
 Niggaz can't fuck with these motherfuckin nightmares 
 Sellin keys and a half, some niggaz filled with slugs 
 And all the bodies drug, all the motherfuckin ditches dug 
 I bury Paul, 'cause I'm the pallbearer 
 Get your dome clapped in the dirty bay area 
 Verse Three: Spice-1 
 I'm sick up in this game 
 I take no motherfuckin shorts, of course, I'm cappin 
 Leavin' niggaz body parts collapsin 
 From the tech 'cause I collect another killin' 
 When I ride by do a drive-by domes either peelin 
 Bumpin up old school ep shit get off my ballzac 
 Sippin on that Hennesey me and my G is to' back 
 See we don't be stress enough drama until the four chump 
 But we'll bring it to you and murda if you want some 
 Rollin' up in caddies and dumpin out tinted windows 
 Put so much lead up in niggaz, use 'em for pencils 
 See can't be flossin this shit to make yourself look harder 
 It's like, throwin' some bloody meat up in the water 
 Nigga, then you will never yourself a nice day 
 Cause these shark ass niggas'll gobble your ass up in the Dirty Bay 
 Chorus: repeat 3X
