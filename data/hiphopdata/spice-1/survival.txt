I'm lookin' up out the barrel of a .45 
 Will a nigga survive 
 Or will these muthafuckas see me die 
 You see I'm livin' in a society 
 Where soldiers breed 
 And you see murder 187 over hustlers greed 
 I told my homie to watch his fuckin' back 
 While he blunted 
 I know some niggas that wanna kill him 
 For that five hundred 
 You see a murder from a street 
 My survival skills 
 Hand to hand or combat or even shoot to kill 
 Can't let these muthafuckas do you in this game man 
 Leavin' cocaine in blood 
 Runnin' down the street drain 
 They screamin yeah but it ain't because they happy 
 I think they wanna cap me dome 
 Run in my happy home 
 And do me with the chrome 
 But ain't shit poppin' 
 'Cause you're sure to get your life tooken 
 I got niggas watchin my back 
 When even I ain't look at it 
 Survival 
 Survival 
 Only the strong can survive 
 Its called survival 
 You see its cold on these blood-thirsty streets nigga 
 You got to figure 
 Even these little muthafuckas packin triggas 
 That'll put you under 
 I heard the thunder of a .20 gauge 
 ????? Another nigga dead 
 And still don't make the front page 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 You're on your own patna 
 Better pull some licks but don't jack me 
 Cause you get with this chopper 
 Make you spray yourself or AK yourself 
 If you don't know how much you're worth 
 You should have took your time and weighed yourself 
 Its 50/50 in the city when its life or death 
 You can take it 
 Or I could have my last breath 
 Its do or die 
 Die or do 
 Me and you 
 Which one will survive 
 When all the killin' is through 
 Some niggas leavin' dumb before they realize 
 The name of the muthafuckin game is survive nigga 
 Muthafuckas say that I'm a paranoid nigga 
 Because I'm strapped with the infrared and the mack 11 
 Everyday put a happy big face up in your 6 tray 
 ????????? See who survive 
 Before you get off 2 shots 
 Nigga I'm gon get off 5 
 'Cause I ain't the one to be the corpse 
 Up in this muthafucka 
 You know you're fuckin' 
 With the original dead body chucker 
 Punk ass niggas can't get next to this 
 Dead O.G.'s be hautin my body like the muthafuckin exorcist 
 Run up on niggas dumpin they homies 
 Bodies up out they car 
 Its just some hardcore shit 
 That's uncut and raw 
 We do the shit cause niggas can't understand 
 That everybody up on the block 
 Can't be the muthafuckin top man 
 Its scrilla for every nigga so strive 
 And you will be the nigga to survive
