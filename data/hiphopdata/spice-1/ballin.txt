 Spice 1: 
 Some niggas be all up in my shit, you need to quit 
 Sprinkle a motherfucker that will leave you split 
 Tore back ass out bringing you your hat 
 Flat broke, talking about fuck that nigga S-P-I 
 But you can't go one on one Spice 1 because I'm born 
 To die 
 I gets even up on they ass like punk bitches in ditches 
 The gangsterism resulting in murderism 
 Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station 
 You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga 
 Where the scrilla 
 Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off 
 My mask 
 Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your 
 Cash 
 Mobbing I mash out, you ass out 
 Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse 
 Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm 
 Down for thefetty 
 Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and 
 Deadly 
 I ask to ball or not to ball, partner answer the 
 Question 
 I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith 
 And Wesson 
 Yukmouth: 
 One time for your mind 
 Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers 
 All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters 
 Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ??? 
 Drug dealers peep the shit that I kick 
 Hustling, busting down zips making chips 
 If we ain't making it we taking shit 
 To the extreme hit the scenery with machine 
 Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream 
 Nobody run, I come like point blank 
 Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin 
 Frank and Itake 
 So many penitentiary chances, to make 
 Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe 
 I mean ???, nigga your safe is my safe 
 And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe 
 By putting a .38 up in your face 
 For running up in my place and shake the spot 
 And not expect to get your ass shot 
 Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts 
 Caps at your house 
 Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth 
 About to L-U, didn't they tell you 
 I'm a youngster trying to have something like my 
 Nigga L-Q 
 Ballin' 
 Spice 1: 
 It's the motherfucking East Bay G with the hundred 
 Clipper, savage thugnigga 
 See I was born with the lust for money, chrome plated 
 Triggers 
 Mob style haulering 187 up in your face 
 Put a gauge between your throat and tell you that 
 Your out of place 
 Motherfuckers don't be knowing we vicious and vicious 
 To get the cheese 
 More tickets to G's, cruises overseas 
 Can't be no punk about the shit that we're in 
 Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never 
 Get your dividends 
 Balling till I die, until I die I'll be a baller 
 Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shotcaller 
 Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay 
 Them forever 
 Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow 
 Stripe 
 But pull me back, because they cowards and shit 
 I be the nigga that take your drama and put a twist 
 In your the shit 
 Caps get slapped with steel, hot slugs will be your 
 Meal 
 Fucking around with my money is just going to get 
 Your ass killed
