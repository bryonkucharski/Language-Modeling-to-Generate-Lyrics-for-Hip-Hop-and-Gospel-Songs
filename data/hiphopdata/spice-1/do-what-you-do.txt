You do what you do to me. 
 I need to feel. So be prepared. 
 I want to touch. Wanna taste of your sugar skin. 
 So open up and let me in. 
 Don't you know that I'm here to tease you. 
 Let's do it right now. 
 You do what you do to me. 
 And give me love instinctively. 
 Let's go all the way. Come on and make my day. 
 Do what you do to me. 
 The way that it's supposed to be. 
 Live your fantasy. Love in ecstasy. 
 I said take me like a man. I said take me as I am. 
 I said take me by the hand. I said take me if you can. 
 I said you can't turn away. I said you cannot defy. 
 I said you can't be afraid. And you cannot deny. 
 I long to feel your heartbeat race. I want to rise. 
 Want to fall in your special place. 
 So get it on, now face to face. 
 Don't you know that I'm gonna thrill you. 
 I want you right now. 
 You do what you do to me. 
 And give me love instinctively. 
 Let's go all the way. Come on and make my day. 
 Do what you do to me. 
 The way that it's supposed to be. 
 Live your fantasy. Love in ecstasy. 
 I said take me like a man. I said take me as I am. 
 I said take me by the hand. I said take me if you can. 
 I said you can't turn away. I said you cannot defy. 
 I said you can't be afraid. And you cannot deny.
