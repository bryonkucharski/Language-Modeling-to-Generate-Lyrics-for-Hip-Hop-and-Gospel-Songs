If it ain't rough, it ain't me, no it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 (Spice 1) 
 More chips no kippers more bits like your computer 
 With a niglet with the criminal mind like Lex Luger 
 I, leave your top in your lap like I-B-M 
 N-a-navigators, TV's be ridin' them 
 I be him, black beany a brim, twenty inch rim 
 The niggas b-a-bustin' them thangs ridin' with them 
 Slide 'em in, niggas swallow butch like ride 'em in 
 Creep and crawl on they ass like Spiderman 
 Out of men, without the man next to the man 
 Out of men that'll have ya ass buried in sand 
 We ain't playin', layin' niggas across the flo' you gots to go 
 No waitin' for the cops to roll that's pot and a coal 
 Rose like a popsickle and tag his toe, hit him with the calacoal 
 I ride fo' sure and it it ain't rough it ain't me 
 Forever be thugged out Mr. Bossalini 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, no it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me)

 Slam dunk this uzi up in your chest like J.R. 'cause I'ma rider 
 Score thirty six shots in one body slugs burn inside 
 You don't think I'm bad, nobody know karate 
 Just a thugged out nigga puttin' hollows up in your body 
 I don't fuck around with that return from the dead 
 So I make sure I blow off half the back of your head 
 Nigga we skyballin', call me Lucci Skyballer, fly talker 
 Catty trunks with dead carcuses in 'em 
 I spit venom, born to sin 'em sick as fuck 
 With a thug disease, niggas tradin' slugs for cheese 
 In the year two-g's, we call it Y2-YAY 
 And wonder why I pack two AK's, witness the end of days 
 I'm on shots on niggas lotsa niggas to die 
 Hit bitches between their thighs and niggas between their eyes 
 Just pick me with the blunt off in my mouth is lit 
 I smoke the knockout King's two thousand two shit 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, no it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me)

 When you come to my city your vest best be tight on 
 I thought you niggas knew the West was Spice 1 
 Please believe it, we heated with fullies 
 Pull these triggers with baguettes on the index 
 Flexi blast pumpin' like Lex off the X 
 We don't give a fuck we buryin' niggas 
 Never die alone is what we steady tell our young niggas 
 If they comin' to get'cha, take a couple of 'em wit'cha 
 Got 'em rollin' with the "Strap On The Side" 
 Now can you picture me bustin' with saggy pants on runnin' with killers? 
 Bail up on your front lawn with a truck full of niggas 
 We bring nightmares to snitches hangin' around a alley 
 West Sides' finest thug niggas straight outta Cali 
 Bringin' it to ya live, raw and uncut 
 Space ballin', diamonds shinin', plottin' pictures of shit 
 Nigga what I leave you shouldered in the midget of some quicksand 
 Have your ass limpin' around here with a wooden leg and a kick-stand 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, no it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me) 
 If it ain't rough, it ain't me (if it ain't rough, it ain't me)
