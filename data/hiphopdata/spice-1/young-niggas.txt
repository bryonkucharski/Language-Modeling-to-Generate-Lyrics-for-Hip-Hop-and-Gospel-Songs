Y'all ready to do this shit? Bust 
 When I was young, I had the lust to pull the trigger 
 And make change out a five dollar ass, nigga 
 And as time went on, I gained much love 
 But seein' niggas', guts bust at a nightclub 
 Too young to get my ass in but they didn't trip 
 'Cause if I didn't get in, they knew I'd start shit 
 So I was treated like the muthafuckin' Pope 
 Security see me, so they scope 
 And follow me around like a flock of hoes 
 I had a squab with a bitch with a big ass nose 
 I started to knock the bitch out but before I could 
 I'm stopped short by a redneck peckerwood 
 But he was slow, with the other hand slapped the hoe 
 Then security rushed us out the backdo' 
 So when I grabbed the nine, they thought I'd go nuts 
 I'd roll by and bust caps at the grownup's 
 Young nigga, got bold and got the liquor 
 As a young, yeah 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 Well, what do you know, it's summer time 
 And every young nigga my age, is on the grind 
 Workin' for the city 
 A drugstore on every goddamn corner and niggas actin' shitty 
 About who sell, where and whose dope is it 
 So, some niggas around the block, they paid us a visit 
 But we ain't comin' off shit but a drive by 
 I guess they wanna expand to go city wide 
 So we hung muthafuckas by the barbed wire 
 Whoever was a snitch or bitch or liar 
 And five O is gettin' kinda dense 
 'Cause the wire was missin' from a county jail fence 
 Breakin' off boulders 
 And the niggas from around the block, they said they told us 
 Not to short stop, so my nigga got popped 
 I looked down and I'm shocked 
 To see him layin' dead by the bushes 
 As a young nigga 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 Shit is gettin' hectic, my mission had to flow smooth 
 We hit the corner in a sixty-five old school 
 Bustin' at niggas twice my age 
 Muthafuckas catchin' heat from my gauge 
 They tried to shoot back but it ain't like that 
 'Cause I'm the nigga with the biggest gat 
 Hoes get fucked and eat the bullet 
 'Cause the trigger that got my nigga, one of them had to pull it 
 My nigga with the nine said, "Forget it" 
 But I seen a nigga point his finger and say, "He did it" 
 I loaded up the clip and shot him in the dick 
 And kept on bustin' till his leg kicked 
 Now we Audi 5000, gee 
 The glasspacks on the sixty-five, got noisy 
 We had to smash 
 'Cause five O was right behind our ass 
 We had to get away, we dumped the A.K. 
 And the gauge in the bushes on the way 
 The cops kept bustin', niggas kept cussin' 
 About which way to go fussin' 
 We hit the corner and they bust 
 At some niggas lookin' just like us 
 We knew it was about that time 
 Hopped out my homeboy's shit and into mine 
 We got away because they couldn't figure 
 Which one of the boys was that young nigga 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you 
 He said, "Young ass, nigga" 
 You dumb nigga, you
