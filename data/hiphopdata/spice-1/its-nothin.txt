(Intro: Spice 1) 
 It's nothin', you're nothin', it's nothin' 
 It's nothin', you're nothin' 
 (Chorus: Spice 1) 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin' 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin' 
 (Spice 1) 
 It's nothin' when I'm runnin' with the heater 
 Sittin' on a twenty inch thangs 
 Mobbin' with the wood in the grain 
 Can't get in the game, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Hittin' them with the thumb and pinky ring 
 Touched down Lex with the platinum chain 
 Me and my niggas known for bringin' the pain 
 T-a-to the brain, it ain't nothin' to the boss mayn 
 F-a-flossin' with the sticky green 
 Time gets delayed with the gangsta lean 
 Up into the caddy when we ride for cream 
 H-a-hustlin' dream, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Runnin', runnin' whether you're smokin' the glock 
 With the barrettes spinnin' around I'm hittin' them now 
 Goin' sick f-a-fish tailin', smooth sailin' now 
 It ain't nothin' to a boss mayn, bailin' now 
 I'm r-a-rollin' back to back to the trailer now 
 Inhale, exhale b-a-blowin' it out 
 S-a-shouldn't have choked off the endo smokin' my bong 
 P-a-peepin' on the haters 'cause they scopin' me out 
 It ain't nothin' to me, even when I'm ridin' on my enemies 
 Run with a lil' hennessey, weed and be 
 You'll be keen to see, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Play boy... 
 (Chorus: Spice 1) 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin' 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, to a thug, you're nothin'... 
 (Spice 1) 
 ... To a player, to a boss, to a rider ain't no thang 
 L-a-live savish mayn for the cabs mayn, ain't your average mayn 
 Federallies wanna bust me mayn, handcuff me mayn 
 C-a-catch a player rollin' with a half thang 
 I keep ballin' mayn, 'cause it's all the same, ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Play boy it's nothin' 
 To a boss when I'm c-a-callin' shots and makin' boss moves 
 M-a-make a million mayn see the really pain 
 It ain't nothin' to a boss mayn, feel the pain 
 R-a-real thugs lovin' the boss, suckin' 'em all, muggin' it all 
 Watch out I'm chasin' with the real, r-a-rollin' on 
 Sm-a-smokin' cough, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Trigger fingers with the big gats on 'em it ain't no stoppin' me now 
 Smokin' the pound and never come down 
 Keep it crackin' while I'm rollin' now, skypager now 
 Smash off like speed racer now 
 It ain't nothin' to me, thinkin' 'bout it bein' servin' luxury 
 Even if I'm rollin' in a bucket see 
 I keep bustin' see, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn 
 Play boy 
 (Chorus: Spice 1) 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin' 
 It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player 
 To a rider, to a sav, to a hog, to a thug, you're nothin'
