[Chorus:] 
 Kill 'em all [x4] 
 Cuz everybody dyin' on this muthafuckin' album 
 Kill 'em all [x4] 
 Don't kick up in the dirt when i'm puttin' in work 
 Kill 'em all [x4] 
 Cuz everybody dyin' on this muthafuckin' album 
 I murda like this (this) 
 I murda like that (that) 
 Pull an ak-47 up out my muthafuckin' gangsta hat 
 Professinal, columiban, necktiea, barbwire 
 Strangula, over killa, dead fuckin' body hanga 
 Peepin' out the window with an ak 
 Pullin' up on these coppas 
 Helicoptas, squad cars, squat 10's with choppas 
 They tellin' me "nigga, get the fuck out before ya die 
 If you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry" 
 Should i kick open the door and go to war 
 Or should i stick my throat 
 Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note 
 Hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin' 
 And all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman 
 Tear gas through my glass window pane 
 They wanna put me back up in the nut house again 
 But I'm not goin' back and take my prozac 
 They can keep the straight jacket 
 And leave a straight mutha fuckin' jack 
 A straight mutha fuckin' jack 
 A straight mutha fuckin' jack 
 [Chorus] 
 (Get the hell off my dick, i'm 1990-sick) 
 (1990-sick) [x4] 
 Nigga's to pull the lynch 
 Yayo case and stick 
 Marcia Clark screamin' out murda, jumpin' on Oj's dick 
 Muthafuckas still sufferin' and healin' 
 Some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin' fed buildin' 
 Crazy niggas still bangin' and slangin' crack 
 To the death, when the game put 'em up on they back 
 Muthafuckas catchin' names, from shootin' high 
 And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block 
 And I ain't changed much, hell 
 I'm still smokin' four or five muthafuckin' choppas before it's twelve 
 Muthafuckas think they know me, but they don't know 
 I'm sellin' first class tickets to the murda show 
 Don't wanna rap about no nigga, let's get it on 
 Bustin' domes, buck shots through your rib bone 
 So all you niggas up in the magazines talkin' shit 
 Get off my dick, i'm 1990-sick 
 [Chorus] 
 Muh-uh-mobbin' up out the cu-uh-cut 
 With a ready to pow one 
 Nuh-uh-90 sick content of the album 
 If there's a cure for this, don't cure me 
 I'm comin' with the fury 
 Playa hata's gettin' hung up like a jury 
 So peep the game from an old school G you know so well 
 The east bay gangsta, leaving caution tape and faces pale 
 I bails on a full moon like the 12 o clock 
 Neighborhood watch scared to look and see who on the block 
 Just fed a rallys, no po-po come around here 
 Cuz it's a different time, different game, different year 
 1990 sick 
 [Chorus x2] 
 (Get the hell off my dick, i'm 1990-sick) 
 (1990-sick) [x4]
