Hit him up two times 
 Three'd be hat trick 
 Gave him more shots than the pediatrics 
 Came to his house and shot his left hand out 
 Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South 
 To reach the sky, how far would a star go 
 To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo 
 Makin' money from everything I spoke in this 
 Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist 
 Got ability to make missy a little tipsy 
 I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!) 
 I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns 
 'Cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around 
 And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses 
 'Cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses 
 You watchin porn sittin' there at you're macintosh 
 With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off 
 And you try goin' harder than star wars Anakin 
 'Cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin 
 Got a belt full of steel you can call me santa 
 You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin' banana 
 And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards 
 'Cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
 Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay 
 'Cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA 
 And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son 
 But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun 
 They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out 
 Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out 
 I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot 
 So far... how many mother fuckers do you think I got?
