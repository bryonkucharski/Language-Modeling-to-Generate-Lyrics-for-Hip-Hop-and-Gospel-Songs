(The Game) 
 I give niggas the blues 
 Like an L.A. County jumpsuit 
 Hop inside the Phantom like the nigga Donald Trump do 
 And just cruise control until I lose control 
 These rubberband tires sittin' on 2's and 4's 
 I pick and choose my foes 
 And with abusive flows I set traps, so no rat can climb through his hole 
 Touch my chedder bring out Beretta's 
 Try'na floss be a boss 
 We do six hundred or better 
 Chopping up raw lettuce 
 My bitch got a coke fetish 
 Still a fan 'cause she runnin' through lines like Jerome Bettis 
 Iced out Coogi sweater, Air Ones, Louis, checker belt 
 Got me swimmin' through these bitches like Mike Phelps 
 Drop top Phantom so the world know I'm hazin' 
 Catch contact high while I listen to Miles Davis 
 Lay my head back and just cruise 
 Tommy turn down the muthafuckin' bass and give niggas the blues 
 Yeah I give niggas the blues 
 Drumma Boy adjust the bass and give niggas the blues 
 I give niggas the blues 
 I give niggas the blues 
 (Young Buck) 
 Been through it 
 The picture you see now I drew it 
 Service myself change the oil and transmission fluid 
 Mel Gibson on these hoes on these 24's 
 I'm still the truth in this game full of Pinnocchio's 
 Filed bankrupt, like what you gon' take next from me? 
 Then I bought a 'Vette for me, call it IRS money 
 It's money, power, respect 
 Lil' buddy you wrong 
 Respect, power, and money 
 Now what the fuck is you on? 
 This a "Dessert Storm" I get my Clue on 
 Standin' in a room full of Bloods with my blue on 
 Revolver on my waist but the barrel on it too long 
 Can't even fuckin' move, I ain't used to havin' no suit on 
 I'm doin' what I do, y'all done think I moved on 
 With or without a crew 
 My bills is still due on the first like you 
 Pull up in anything bitch I'm B.B. King 
 And I break the rules 
 I will give niggas the blues 
 I give niggas the blues 
 Take Drumma Boy beat and give niggas the blues 
 Yeah
