 (Young Buck) 
 I got my pistol in my lap, and the top drop down 
 An AK in the back 'cause a nigga hot now 
 And I been shooting, and I been robbing 
 Fifty telling niggas I'm a mutherfuckin prophet (gun shot) 
 I come from the bottom, but birds I got'em 
 I ?grip? two cents in harlem, serve all'em 
 To me what I deserve man 
 Fuck what you heard man 
 They doing a Tennekee? 
 So who tha' real wurd man 
 They try to stop us, but I load up my choppa 
 Put my eye in tha' scope and pop'em right in their pajamas (gun shot) 
 Do what we say so is waitin on Yayo 
 So we can double back and give the fans what they paid for 
 Ever since the game came back to reality 
 These Niggas that ain't sellin, they mad at me, but had at me 
 Then, I take it right back tha' block 
 And Tennessee, we known to put tha' pirates on the pot 
 (Young buck) 
 Banks got me Jamican queens showin' dem around 
 We about to bounce from Brooklyn den head up town 
 The first down south nigga getting popping on the east coast 
 Like I dun want ????? I'm from the streets hoe 
 Gotta keep my heat cloaked just incase we bump headz 
 I'm goin' backside with a gunshot, shell spray 
 Fuck what they say, G-unit's is in dis bitch 
 With four assault rifles and 6 ?million? clips 
 Bulletproof beam parked outside da club 
 So we can shoot at y'all, but you can't shoot at us 
 My westcoast niccas get ur bang on to diz 
 If you ain't throwin' up ur hood, den you dun belong in diz bitch 
 One tyme for big pac, two times for tupac 
 Stuff tha shit out of a nigga ina G-unit Reebok 
 I've been "patiently waiting" while niggas was hating 
 I'm trying to keep count all this fucking money I'm makin' 
 Bitch!
