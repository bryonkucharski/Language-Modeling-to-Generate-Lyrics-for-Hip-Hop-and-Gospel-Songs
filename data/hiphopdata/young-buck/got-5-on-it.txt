(Feat. Lil' Flip) 
 (Whoo Kid: talking) 
 Welcome To The Hood Volume 1 
 I don't need a scale nigga I know how much that is 
 Hey Flip pass the weed nigga 
 Why you talkin' about 5 500 hundred nigga we buyin dro 
 Nigga you know what it is nigga 
 What you smokin' on nigga? 
 I'm smokin' on that fresh shit 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' on that Endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' with them Clover Gees 
 I got 5 on it 
 Twist it up and smoke the sack 
 I got 5 on it 
 [Lil Flip:] yeah now puff puff pass nigga let's get high 
 (Verse 1: Lil Flip) 
 The block too hot these niggas ain't playin' in fact they die over greed 
 While I smoke weed 
 With red here 
 Y'all niggas know I flip them bizzirds 
 Y'all niggas know I sip that Sizzurp 
 I comin' from Houston the home of Face boy 
 I'm a bad boy like Puffy and Mase boy 
 The bigger the pistol the bigger the bullet bitch 
 Don't play with me 'cause I'm eager to pull it trick 
 What you about that purple haze? 
 I smoke that shit that'll make you miss work for days 
 I got bricks of coke and pounds of dro 
 And I don't discuss business around them hos (oh no) 
 I ain't tryin' to be that nigga gettin' cuffed up 
 Rule number one don't ever talk much 
 Rule number two keep them niggas out ya crib 
 Cause you just can't show everybody where you live 
 Niggas think I changed 
 'Cause I got a little change 
 But the money and the fame 
 Came along with the game 
 Now you wonder why we get high 
 Just to get by motherfucker! 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' on that Endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' with them Clover Gees 
 I got 5 on it 
 Twist it up and smoke the sack 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Lil Flip:) yeah now puff puff pass nigga let's get high 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 What you know about that Blueberry Kush, Strawberry Haze? 
 That shit that have a nigga ass high for days 
 My eyes bloodshot red I'm tryin' to stay in the fastlane 
 The blunts still burnin' and the police on my ass mayne (fuck y'all) 
 I don't pay for weed my white boys show me love 
 They be like "Here Buck, dog I brought some bud" 
 Ain't nothin' like that California marijuana 
 You wake up the next day the smell still on ya 
 Pass the ganja and 
 Light ya lighters man 
 Raise your hand if you a true Bob Marley fan 
 Can't get enough of Ms. Mary Jane 
 When I leave the bitch she keep callin' my name 
 Whenever I come around 
 She says I break her down 
 She brought half of her friends and she bringin' a pound 
 Everybody gettin' high that's how its supposed to be 
 If you got that real shit come and smoke with me Young Buck! 
 (Young Buck: talking) 
 And I ain't talking 'bout no motherfuckin' brown weed neither nigga 
 I know alot of y'all niggas out there think y'all smokin' dro 
 But y'all smokin' pretend-o (get it?) 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' on that Endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Smokin' with them Clover Gees 
 I got 5 on it 
 Twist it up and smoke the sack 
 I got 5 on it 
 [Lil Flip:] yeah now puff puff pass nigga let's get high
