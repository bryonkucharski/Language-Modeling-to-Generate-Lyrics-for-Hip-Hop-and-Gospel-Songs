(Feat. M.O.P.) 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun 
 If you don't want none 
 Then that ass better run 
 You can get hit 
 In the middle of this shit 
 Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin' 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Two four fives tattood on my side 
 You will die nigga before I lose my pride 
 I don't hide nigga 
 This ain't a bullet-proof ride 
 I be out there, for any nigga want to try 
 Ain't a vest that they make that can take a chopper 
 An unsolved mystery if its done proper 
 Partner 
 Look what happened to Jimmy Hoffa 
 They still ain't found his ass so who shot him? 
 AKs I got 'em 
 I mean alot of 'em 
 Got it lookin' like Fort Knox in this bitch 
 A .40 cal Glock, shoot thirty two shots 
 Can't tell me I ain't ready to get in some shit 
 Make a lane for me, homie get out the way 
 Been out of contro and I ain't got no brakes 
 Like a G would 
 I just do it for the hood 
 If I rob you then my whole block good 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun 
 If you don't want none 
 Then that ass better run 
 You can get hit 
 In the middle of this shit 
 Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin' 
 (Verse 2: Lil' Fame) 
 Yo I been thuggin' with these Brownville niggas for a long, long time (YUH!) 
 We put it down for a long, long time (YUH!) 
 Scuffle in these streets for a long long time 
 And ain't too many fuckin' with mine 
 Now I've been... spittin' at you bitches for a long long time 
 Gettin' at you bitches for a long long time 
 Brownsville style [NIGGA!] 
 Head to toe 
 Anti X and O 
 That's how I do it y'all, that's how I does it 
 Don't give a fuck (Brrraatt) if you Blood or Cuzzin 
 Keep your ears tuned to this nigga, I be dancin' with the Grim Reaper 
 Stuck in this bitch gettin' deeper 
 So, gangsta boogie with the gangsta 
 Gangsta boogie with the gangsta 
 Gangsta boogie 
 Every street nigga ain't a rapper 
 And every rapper ain't a street nigga 
 So holla at me 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun 
 If you don't want none 
 Then that ass better run 
 You can get hit 
 In the middle of this shit 
 Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin' 
 (Verse 3: Billy Danze) 
 Don't bitch out now nigga, you see me comin' with the Magnum 
 Heavy copper tops (SPIT!) 
 Clear out ya block (QUICK!) 
 M.O.P. faggot we at it again with (G-UNIT!) 
 Look roll up in your truck and I'll pump something through it 
 [Ca$hville] Buck said they love me 
 'Cause I'm side steppin' and grippin' my weapon when it's ugly 
 And y'all can't touch me 
 Easy how you rub me 
 I'll show you the meanin' of what a true thug be (Yeah!) 
 Brooklyn, home to the black bags and the white sheets 
 It's where we re-position niggas off they feet 
 It's rugged in the street (FO'SHO!) 
 We learn to, kick off a clip and open ya shit at the door, 
 So, no sudden moves don't do it 
 You'll get found chopped in a bag and stuffed in a Buick 
 The moral of the story is we get to it 
 Where the G's roll 
 And dude I never walk alone (HA!) 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun 
 If you don't want none 
 Then that ass better run 
 You can get hit 
 In the middle of this shit 
 Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your gun go bang (BANG!) 
 Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Let your guns go bang (BANG!) 
 Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin'
