 Da hoes know da swag, they see a new face. 
 They see the Gucci bag and the Louis suitcase. 
 The Marc Jacob glasses and baby brown shirt. 
 Da only question da niggas ask is where dat work. 
 I'm two steps ahead of these bitches and these feds. 
 See I just want da bread, and dey just want me dead. 
 So I don't go to bed, I be sleepin' with my Nikes on, 3 am, all of the lights on, until the white gone.
