(Feat. 50 Cent) 
 [50 Cent:] Man I've been tellin' niggas over and over 
 [Young Buck:] Ayo what up niggas? 
 [50 Cent:] Not to play with this nigga man 
 [Young Buck:] Ayo man? there be alot of niggas out here 
 Talkin' about they got beef with G-Unit... 
 [50 Cent:] Shoot, stab, kill nigga 
 [Young Buck:] You know? 
 And I be seein' these niggas 
 I be by myself and shit niggas be like a hundred deep and shit... 
 I be like "What's up nigga?" 
 [50 Cent:] Don't say I ain't tell you, I warned you 
 [Young Buck:] Niggas be like "Nah man it ain't like that" 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Look up it's a full moon the sound of the winds blowin' 
 And you don't know you about to get killed but I been knowin' 
 The nights still young I might as well come around midnight 
 Just me all by my lonely my homies gon' sit tight, 
 I'm working with a Glock and just a little bit of gas money 
 But bet I come back with what them niggas done snatch from me? 
 My crip and blood thugs want to get with ya 
 They mad at me 'cause I'm tellin' them "Its personal nigga" 
 I want to see 
 If this motherfucker want it with me 
 So on three 
 I'm a hop up out this SUV 
 If you around with 'em 
 I'm a feel like you down with 'em 
 So soon as this round hit 'em 
 You'll lay in the ground with 'em 
 Awakened by Satan but being carried by the Lord 
 What your life cost Bill Gates couldn't even afford 
 Ain't nothin' that can stop reprecussions if I die 
 This ain't got nothin' to do with Dr. Dre motherfucker, it's you and I 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I don't need 10 niggas with me, 
 I don't run and go get the police 
 (I will do it myself) 
 You know me 
 I'm a motherfuckin' G 
 If its beef bitch nigga we'll see 
 (I will do it myself) 
 Let 'em hate homie you know where I be 
 You done seen me get down on TV 
 (I will do it myself) 
 And I brought the whole Unit with me 
 But they already know how I be 
 (I will do it myself) 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 In the beginning I was humble 
 Just thankful for makin' it out the jungle 
 I've never ever said nothin' on this mic I didn't want to 
 I'm a soldier so soon as 50 give me a mission 
 I'm on my enemie's territory then play my position 
 And homie know me even that nigga that's wearin' ya chain 
 See we both from the south but homie we ain't the same 
 And I remain in the same fuckin' project buildings 
 I got guns everywhere bullet holes in the ceiling 
 My adrenaline pumpin' 
 Got this 12 Gauge dumpin' 
 Out the back of this Cutless 
 If I get hit up then fuck it (yeah) 
 The Reaper comin' so don't look back just keep runnin' 
 Tell 50 for this hit I don't need nothin' "You owe me one" 
 Now show me son 
 And where he be at 
 That's all I need to know, you can go I'm a be back 
 Any other time I probably would've asked Banks to ride 
 But this ain't got nothin' to do with G Unit nigga... just you and I 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I don't need 10 niggas with me, 
 I don't run and go get the police 
 (I will do it myself) 
 You know me 
 I'm a motherfuckin' G 
 If its beef bitch nigga we'll see 
 (I will do it myself) 
 Let 'em hate homie you know where I be 
 You done seen me get down on TV 
 (I will do it myself) 
 And I brought the whole Unit with me 
 But they already know how I be 
 (I will do it myself) 
 50 Cent: 
 Yeah 
 Y'all niggas know what it is man 
 G Unit South 
 Young Buck 
 I've been holdin'... 
 I've been savin' y'all niggas man 
 I swear to god 
 I've been savin' y'all niggas 
 Over and over 
 I've been tellin' him "Fall back Buck" 
 "Don't cut these niggas, don't suit these niggas" 
 "Fall back, it's not good for business" 
 Right?, but now I'm a let up off... 
 They got a green light man 
 Fuck these niggas man 
 Get right man 
 Whatever 
 You know what it is man 
 It's The Unit nigga 
 Huh 
 Fuck, I pull through I see niggas... 
 Fix your motherfuckin' face nigga 
 Look at these fuckin' chimpanzees 
 Bunch of fuckin' monkies 
 Huh?, You burgers, you fuckin' meat heads 
 Go shoot yourself motherfucker
