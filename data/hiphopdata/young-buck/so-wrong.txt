 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 Life ain't what it used to be 
 I got these coward niggas shootin' me 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 It just ain't the same no more 
 A nigga trippin' and stressin' a whore 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 (Verse 1: Snoop Dogg) 
 I'm just sittin' back vibin' to some Al Green now 
 10, 11, 12 years in the game and I came from the Seenile 
 Got a gang of loved ones in the penile 
 Fighting for lives everyday but meanwhile 
 I see my life is sort of like there's 
 Cause other than moms and Boo-Boo nobody else cares 
 I know you think I'm tweekin' 
 But the only time I get to see my kids is on the visiting weekend 
 I ain't in no chains 
 But sometimes I get tested by the places I hang 
 And my game just banged on these niggas from the other side 
 Now I got reprecussions 
 Suckas is bustin' 
 Talk is cheap 
 And for some apparent reason the streets keep watchin' me 
 Well watch me 
 And watch ya back 
 Pop pop I got ya that 
 Ratta Tat 
 Nigga I stay strapped 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 Life ain't what it used to be 
 I got these coward niggas shootin' me 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 It just ain't the same no more 
 A nigga trippin' and stressin' a whore 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 (Verse 2: Lil Flip) 
 I'm not a role model but you know I got the title 
 And I ain't no American idol 
 I'm more like the American pimp its no lie 
 So heres a slice of American pie 
 They told me not to rap but I'm doing my thang 
 I'm movin' my caine 
 Got pink, red and blue in my chain 
 Nigga I'm like a pimp writin' scripts 
 I got hits nigga 
 I fill the house with the bricks nigga 
 We on the grind 
 Got money on my mind 
 My niggas puff pine 
 Y'all niggas sniff lines 
 You do the crime you do the time that's what they told me 
 I'm like LeBron my nigga you can't hold me 
 My nigga I can't back down 
 Get a brick and turn ya town into crack town 
 I'm on the blocks with them blocks 
 I don't run from the cops 
 Dump the yay 'cause I got 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 Life ain't what it used to be 
 I got these coward niggas shootin' me 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 It just ain't the same no more 
 A nigga trippin' and stressin' a whore 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 (Verse 3: Young Buck) 
 These niggas wanna see me dead 
 Instead 
 I'm gettin' this bread 
 I'm not blue or red 
 But I'll put two to your head 
 They said I wouldn't make it to see 21 but I did 
 The last homie that got killed I closed his eyelid 
 Fuck friends cause in the end niggas turn they back 
 Just 'cause I smoked a blunt with ya don't mean we cool like that 
 And your hood ain't no harder than mine 
 I put in more work than you on your own block I know that you lyin' 
 I got one hand on the wheel other hand on my nine 
 Bitch come down here to Ca$hville I ain't hard to find 
 My section is protected by Smith And Westons and Rugers 
 A bunch of bulletproof vestes and some cold-hearted shooters 
 Motherfucker 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 Life ain't what it used to be 
 I got these coward niggas shootin' me 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 It just ain't the same no more 
 A nigga trippin' and stressin' a whore 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong 
 So wrong

 By the way you know my DJ, Whoo Kid?

 You know out there in L.A.? 
 You know I found out some new news about my DJ too
