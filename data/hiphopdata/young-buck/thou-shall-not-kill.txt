Young buck: 
 G-unit! 
 Yeah... 
 You better kill me 
 50, lemme get these niggas 
 (Get 'em buck!) 
 I brush my teeth, load my clip, and go bust my heat 
 I'm in too deep, I can't say fuck the streets 
 I need some sleep, the fiends still comin' 
 Bush 'bout to blow this bitch up 
 Better get money, dead bodys get picked up 
 I'm david in teen's now 
 Niggas we're digital, but they work triple beams now 
 I'm livin' for me now, 'cause I done went to war with the other side 
 Lucky me, 'cause the enemies mother and brother died 
 Hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's 
 It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day 
 Y'all niggas just wait, right after my court date 
 It's gonna get grimey, like new york say 
 Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon' spray 
 Bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day 
 Better holla mayday, 'cause we comin' 
 And we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin 
 They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill 
 But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will 
 Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel 
 'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real 
 They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill 
 But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will 
 Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel 
 'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real 
 I'm already dead, can't kill me nigga 
 And even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya 
 I'm unfamiliar with a lot of these soldiers 
 I go out in the road, and niggas think that it's over 
 Runnin', the fiends all puttin' too much soda on the d' 
 You would think niggas know, 'cause they older than me 
 Been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out 
 How can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count 
 It's back to the black gloves, and home invasions 
 Puttin' holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton 
 No I'm not waitin on nothin', no more 
 Eather you pay me what you owe me, or I'm cuttin' ya throat 
 Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe 
 How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope 
 I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge 
 I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in 
 They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill 
 But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will 
 Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel 
 'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real 
 They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill 
 But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will 
 Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel 
 'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real 
 Boom!, g-unit!, we on some military shit nigga 
 You better kill us all, 'cause we commin' 
 Muthafucka's!
