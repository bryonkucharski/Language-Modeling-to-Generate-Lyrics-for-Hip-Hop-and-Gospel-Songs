 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 Two niggaz in the front, two niggaz in the back 
 That's four niggaz riding strapped in grandpa's Cadillac 
 The voice in my head say fuck all these niggaz 
 Then I start thinking, I should rob all these niggaz 
 Man my homies they want do whatever I want do 
 I say I want eat they say shit we want eat to 
 Let's ride around find a nigga stunting on first street 
 With the shine's on niggaz be looking like lunch meat 
 I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor 
 Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start popping some more 
 Fuck a ski mask, man niggaz know who I is 
 I got a full clip and niggaz know I get biz 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 I'm up early in the morning, tryna make a move 
 You coming in here with me shorty take your lil' one to school 
 Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma 
 I hit her with the lama to get this cake 
 Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe 
 Oh, she don't know it, damn, okay we'll wait 
 I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone 
 With a gun to her head saying, "Daddy come home" 
 You was rolling, popping bubbly, didn't think it get ugly 
 In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad 
 Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearing you 
 And the nine will jam, right in my hand 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 I got his homies screaming buck you need to calm down 
 Niggaz be getting killed every time you come around 
 We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground 
 She asking God, what my baby dunn did now? 
 I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all 
 Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall 
 Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow 
 So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow 
 I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star 
 I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar 
 The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk 
 And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault 
 March nigga step, right nigga lef' 
 G-Unit soldier I'm thugging till my death mothafuckas 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed 
 I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will 
 I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled 
 I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
