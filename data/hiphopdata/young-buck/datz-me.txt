I'm talkin' dirty, wit' bout 80 thousand in my mouth 
 I'm stompin' through this bitch, movin' 'em in, and shippin' 'em out 
 Breath smell like hennessey, my clothes smell like weed 
 Atl and tennessee, I'm right up the street 
 In the club where the thugs be, it be hard to breathe 
 Sean paul said we gon' bust they head before we leave 
 I brought so good wit me, and I got my hood wit me 
 Cadillac'n all through college park, I'm talkin' bout wood grippin' 
 Dirty south, they bullshittin', you can't ride on them down here 
 Niggaz can damn well fit inside their rims round here 
 And our hoes drop it down to the ground like they supposed to 
 Or fuck a nigga whole crew, anytime we roll through 
 Young buck and youngbloodz, we came here to show you 
 Just how to start a fight and what that grey goose and dro'll do 
 Snatch me a ho or two, niggaz know howe we do it 
 Ain't nothin' change, you know the game, it's gunit! 
 Totin' guns, rollin' blunts, gettin' crunk that's me 
 Switchin' lanes, grippin' grains, got them thangs that's me 
 Swervin lac's, servin' x, countin' stacks that's me 
 Cook it up and bring it back, that's a fact that's me 
 Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me 
 In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me 
 In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me 
 Represent the atown, best believe that's me 
 Now on the realer, I'm a hell of a nigga 
 Like when I was down in that 'cedes dealer came out a winner 
 I'm a big bank flipper, purple syrup sipper 
 Stuntin' ass nigga, cost my thunder for some spinners 
 Don't you see the chain and watch, bitch, we chillin' like December 
 Finna change the weather when I stick it out the window 
 And I don't want no sack, mayn, don't give me that ever 
 And if the price the lo'lo', then gon' give me two mo' 
 Give me twolo, when I ride out with two hoes 
 One dark skin, one light skin, wit two though 
 Let the top down and let them hoes hair blow 
 Fired up some dro, this like ridin' on two fo's wit' two hoes 
 Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me 
 In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me 
 In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me 
 Represent the atown, best believe that's me 
 Stay slizzard on patron, herringbone that's me 
 In the club tippin' strippers, sippin' goose that's me 
 Ridin' clean, blowin' good on that dro that's me 
 Dirty south, straight country, 105 that's me 
 (Jbo) 
 See I can tell by the way they look me in the eye 
 That he's a ho, and she's a bitch, and often many try 
 But like a soldier, I'mma rid till I fuckin' die 
 Swerve on the buster, run up and put one in the sky 
 And if you ain't comprehendin' what I'm sayin' to ya 
 It's 105, youngbloodz, and I ain't playin' wit'hca 
 Now watch me break 'em down, back 'em up, and ship 'em out 
 Even steady, comin', breakin bread, what I'm talkin' bout 
 'Cause what you didn't know, is how I get so many hoes 
 How I keep it pimpin' never, sippin' 'cause I'm all pro 
 And yeah, I see you like the way we do it big 
 Pull up in the old schools, blowin', hoppin' out the whip 
 Stay slizzard on patron, herringbone that's me 
 In the club tippin' strippers, sippin' goose that's me 
 Ridin' clean, blowin' good on that dro that's me 
 Dirty south, straight country, 105 that's me 
 Totin' guns, rollin' blunts, gettin' crunk that's me 
 Switchin' lanes, grippin' grains, got them thangs that's me 
 Swervin lac's, servin' x, countin' stacks that's me 
 Cook it up and bring it back, that's a fact that's me 
 Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me 
 In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me 
 In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me 
 Represent the atown, best believe that's me
