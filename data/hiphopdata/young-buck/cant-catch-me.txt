Aye Sticks, what up, homie? 
 Aye man, I know you see these niggas, man

 They taking my ideas and everythang, fuck 'em, yeah 
 These rap niggas ain't gettin' no money 
 I got my hands in everythang 
 If I can't get it over here

 I be flying down the interstate, trunk full of snowflakes 
 100 miles an hour, Lamborghini got no brakes 
 Navigation got me, crackerz tryna hide me 
 Niggas won't allow me, these hoes tryna fire me 
 Car so dark with the foppin' san tents 
 Jeezy say I'm goin' hard, yeah, I got to pay my rent 
 All my homies on a yard and I might be goin' in 
 So I give my lawyer ten, like every now and then 
 Keep a ounce of that granddaddy when I'm in my ten Caddi 
 Young nigga, old money, bitch, you know I been had it 
 Catch me with my roof back, birds on tha back seat

 Fuck rap, I got dough money, bitch 
 And I bet cha can't catch me 
 I bet cha can't catch me

 Fuck you, I got dough money, bitch 
 And I bet cha can't catch me 
 I bet cha can't catch me 
 I bet cha can't catch me 
 I won't let them catch me 
 You ain't neva seen a Phantom with so many stashed products 
 Bought a crib in Atlanta 'cause the village gettin' hot 
 You can catch me in the hood in them dough boi spots 
 Every time I leave the kitchen I go buy another watch 
 Bad bitches shop, lil' homie get the drop 
 I change my name to King David, I'm the boss of the block 
 All that snitchin' tend stop soon as I kill me a nigga 
 And I know you probably gon' sue me so look he gon' deal with cha 
 Got my Louie bag filled up, take me where to get it 
 Niggas still tryna do it but we already did it 
 I'ma run this bitch hot, homie, just give me a minute 
 If my album don't drop, you could go 'head and get it, yeah 
 Ghetto hero, I'm hood rich

 And I bet cha can't catch me
