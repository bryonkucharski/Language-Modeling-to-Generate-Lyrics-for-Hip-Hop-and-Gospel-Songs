Ho, niggas got it fucked up for real 
 Supa thug in my bandanna 
 Got my face covered 
 Watch me roll this quarter ounce blunt, 
 And don't waste nothin' 
 Bitch I know you hate me 
 But you won't say nothin' 
 Me and my AK huntin' 
 Since you wanna taste somethin' 
 I don't pay for shit 
 But I will take the hit 
 Pull the Benz out 
 And pull the pin out 
 And make 'em quit 
 Don't compare me to them coward niggas 
 You been bitchin' with 
 Out there swimmin' in that water 
 We gon' see how deep it gets 
 We don't drive by 
 We get out and walk by 
 Parties in the street 
 Yellow tape, white chalk lines 
 Can't afford to let 'em blow it 
 Right now I'm ready for it 
 Realist nigga in this rap shit 
 Bitch you better know it 
 I just think you better know it 
 You better know it (x8) 
 26 inches 
 A problem, I just bought me 
 This should be ridiculous, 
 Niggas kill for this versache 
 First I hit the lights 
 Hit the gas 
 Watch me open up my stash 
 I reach in, get my strap 
 Yeah, then put on my mask 
 Got a face full of teardrops 
 Still you ain't no goon 
 Niggas die right here on this block 
 This ain't no cartoon 
 Put bulletholes all in ya gucci 
 Let you pick the spot 
 On where to let a nigga 
 Shoot ya ass 
 Chopper cut ya head 
 Hit his leg till it strike out 
 Let him think he made it 
 Then ya knock his whole life out 
 Borrow money bitch 
 Go to jail, I'm gettin' right out 
 Stop and see my kids 
 Then I'm on the next flight out 
 I just think you better know it 
 You better know it (x17)
