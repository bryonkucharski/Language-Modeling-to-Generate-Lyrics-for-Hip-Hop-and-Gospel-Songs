Bang bang 
 I shot you down, bang bang 
 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awful sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 (Verse one) 
 Don't nobody wanna die, but everybody wanna ball 
 Somebody gotta go, when them killa's call 
 You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it 
 You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it 
 The streets talk, the beats mark, 'cause that heat comin' 
 And if they know that you did it, you better keep runnin' 
 I think I see sumthin, there go my enemy 
 Only lord knows where this nigga f'nd to be 
 Tennakee, still the price is as real if you look it 
 Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it 
 Nigga anything goes, my shop never close 
 From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo 
 The real niggas feel me, the haters wanna kill me 
 But I'm holdin' down my city, me and this 9 milli 
 While your throwin' bricks, and hidin' ya heads 
 Homie, I know where you hang 
 Ain't no thang to walk up and let that chopper go...

 Bang bang 
 I shot you down, bang bang 
 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awefull sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Bang bang 
 I shot you down, bang bang 
 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awefull sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Now all the gangsta's pray 
 Lord, forgive me 
 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me 
 Lord, forgive me 
 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me 
 (Verse two) 
 Just think if I ain't empty the clip, and he killed me 
 Would I still be livin'?, would my homeboy's miss me? 
 How many niggas bust they gun when they have to? 
 Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you 
 I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left 
 Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe 
 It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery 
 Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me 
 I'd probably be in the penitentary 
 But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me 
 The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas 
 Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers 
 Before I let this police kid harass me 
 This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me 
 He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed 
 He made a move and I heard a blast 
 That's what you get, bitch

 Bang bang 
 I shot you down, bang bang 
 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awefull sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Bang bang 
 I shot you down, bang bang 
 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awefull sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Now all the gangsta's pray 
 Lord, forgive me 
 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me 
 Lord, forgive me 
 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me 
 (Verse three) 
 It's goin' down around here nigga 
 Get ya muthafuckin head bust 
 Them muthafuckin street lights go out 
 And them real niggas come out 
 All the bitch niggas go in the house 
 Just not a game, man 
 Don't fuck around and lose your brain 
 And hey, all my real niggas pray

 Bang bang

 Bang bang

 You hit the ground, bang bang 
 That awefull sound, bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Now all the gangsta's pray

 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me 
 Lord, forgive me 
 But he tried to kill me 
 Somebody out there gotta feel me
