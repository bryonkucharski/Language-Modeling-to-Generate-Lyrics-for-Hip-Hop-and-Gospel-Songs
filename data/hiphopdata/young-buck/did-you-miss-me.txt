Oh so everybody out here rich now? 
 All these rappers wanna talk about how much money they got, how much work they done flipped 
 I don't see none a' you niggaz out here, nigga I'm out here for real 
 A nigga tell you my life is real nigga what? 
 Since everybody rich now 
 Fuck it I'm broke 
 All these rappers talking bricks now 
 I got the dope 
 I got murder on my mind 
 And niggaz tryna murda me 
 Bright like a bounty hunter blood in all burgundy 
 Gangsta like a crip hollerin 'cause you done heard a' me 
 Standin over this stove won't these niggaz worry me 
 Can't no rapper bury me 
 I be trappin thoroughly 
 Freeway Ricky Ross be home in the March 
 I got it all together 
 Ain't nothin' fell apart 
 Be lyin' if I sit here and act like this shit ain't hard 
 They tellin' me "celebrity" 
 "Buck you a celebrity" 
 But if I don't eat, that put my kids life in jeopardy 
 All this fuckin' jealousy 
 I'm buyin all this weaponry 
 And I'm listenin to ever word that T.I. tellin' me 
 And I'm flippin every last bird Jeezy sellin me 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the music 
 Can't charge me with no felony 
 Tell me did ya miss me? 
 Ya miss me? 
 They miss me 
 (x2) 
 Well I'm back 
 I'm Back 
 (x8) 
 Tell me did ya miss me? 
 Ya miss me? 
 They miss me (x2) 
 Well I'm back (x8) 
 I know these people miss me 
 Since everybody ballin' now 
 Fuck it I'm not 
 All these rappers on these private jets 
 I'm on the block 
 Fuck a watch fuck a chain 
 Fuck a phantom fuck a Range 
 Gimme life and this mic 
 And I'ma do the damn thang 
 I'm Insaneee! 
 Crazy 'bout the money 
 All these traps made a nigga relapse 
 They see me and they wonder damn does he still rap? 
 He out here with the goons so ya gotta feel that 
 What happened to the morals 
 When niggaz had rules 
 You had to put in work and pay ya dues Or Ya lose 
 Now niggaz is confused 
 'Cause now they gettin' four and a half 
 Lease a car and make it look like you got more than ya have 
 And these rappers ain't no better they just sayin' whatever 
 Will me and 50 work this shit out? 
 Naaw I ain't sayin' never 
 But I will say now I'm on a whole 'nother level 
 From the music to the business to the ghetto.
