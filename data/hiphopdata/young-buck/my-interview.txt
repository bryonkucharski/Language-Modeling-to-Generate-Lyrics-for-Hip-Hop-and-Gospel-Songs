(Feat. Dion) 
 Yeah, it's my time man, I mean you should just open up the door for a real nigga, you know, roll out the motherfucking carpet for a nigga like me, let's go I guess I gotta kick the motherfucking door down 
 Damn right I'm sippin syrup 
 Flipping birds to get what I deserve 
 And I hear the same things that you heard 
 Like "50 kicked him out" or "Buck sniff coke" 
 Or "he flips out", it's too late the whole world know what I be bout 
 But I do make mistakes like any other man 
 Shit I recoup off a album nigga quicker than you can 
 It ain't me it's the streets and I practice what I preach 
 I got beef in the club 1 deep in south beach 
 Am I loyal? Dr Dre can answer that for ya 
 The hood we ain't fighting for no oil 
 We fighting for life, niggaz can't afford lawyers 
 If you ain't been on ya block, I'm going there 4 ya 
 You open up a casket of a thug who was born a bastard 
 50 birds with a bucket full of battery acid 
 They watching you, they goin' wait for me 
 Street nigga for real, what can you take from me? 
 It ain't nothing I ain't been through Seen the evil shit that men do (so this ain't nothing to me) 
 Givin' money wasn't meant to 
 Muthafucker we ain't been cool (no that say nothin' to me) 
 So when the smoke clears (I'mma be here) 
 I shed no tears (unless you here) 
 Real niggas real bitches go way from here (fo sho) 
 I know you ain't nothing you can't take from me 
 Abel was the youngest and Kane was the oldest 
 Kane had the money but Abel stayed focused 
 GOD came around and Abel got closest 
 Kane got jealous and started showing his emotions 
 All he had to do was do right from the jump 
 He had a head start, GOD put him in front 
 You see a man heart when his kids need lunch 
 See who you really are, see if you can take a punch 
 The dope going up, rap sales going down 
 The south ain't fucking with it, if Buck ain't around 
 Yeah, I'm in the projects right now, the booth in the bathroom 
 The engineer half dope dealer half goon 
 Militant, taking rap where it ain't never been 
 I told niggaz back then bitch let me in 
 They watching you, they going wait for me 
 Dopeboy for real, what can you take from me 
 It ain't nothing I ain't been through Seen the evil shit that men do (so this ain't nothing to me) 
 Givin' money wasn't meant to 
 Muthafucker we ain't been cool (no that say nothin' to me) 
 So when the smoke clears (I'mma be here) 
 I shed no tears (unless you here) 
 Real niggas real bitches go way from here (fo sho) 
 I know you ain't nothing you can't take from me 
 Ok, let me talk to the streets, words I speak make those? rocks? rely six feet, we call it the truth, it makes a caged man wish he was loose 
 It can't be feared to ya uniforment juice 
 But throught the heart and soul of the truth 
 With Soulja in the booth 
 I bring it to you and me 
 Yeah I had my hands and nose in the D 
 The projects like jail and I wanted to be free 
 The game got send me kept me out the penitentiary 
 Made a decission as a child? already givenin 
 Never left the dirt wich I was birth 
 Spiritual young men 
 Don't know the last time I was in church 
 But I do know I'm here for something 
 If you can't see and I know you hear come in, all a board 
 We got room for you, to who you make concern, Young Buck, "my intervieuw" [x4: till fade out]
