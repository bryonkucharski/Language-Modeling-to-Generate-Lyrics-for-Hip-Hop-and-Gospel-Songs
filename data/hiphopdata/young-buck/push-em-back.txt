It's about to go down 
 Get out the way, get out the way 
 Better move, it's about to go down 
 Get out the way, get out the way 
 You better move 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through 
 If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do 
 I push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Get out my way, we ballin' like hey 
 I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway 
 Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Ain't nobody goin' broke, everybody sellin' dope 
 Everybody gettin' money, it's some niggas tellin' no 
 We ain' talkin' on the phone, I don't know ya, I ain't servin' ya 
 Nobody never heard of ya, you're fuckin' wit' some murderers 
 Look at my wrist, look at my bitch 
 She hold daddy down, help a nigga get rich 
 This patron got me hot, the Phantom in the lot 
 See this pill kickin' in and I'm standin' wit my glock 
 In this bitch like move, I need some elbow room 
 Got me spillin' liquor, why the club close so soon? 
 Burn this bitch up, we 'bout to get Buck 
 Gimme a light, tell the DJ, turn my shit up, it's on now 
 Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through 
 If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do 
 I push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Get out my way, we ballin' like hey 
 I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway 
 Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Cup fun of Hennessy, my niggas call it Gasoline 
 Pussy niggas fill up and say shit they don't mean 
 Stuntin' wit cha real money that'll get chu killed 
 See probly wan' this paper, my baby needs some milk 
 Bitch, we built this city, the dope boy committee 
 I still got the nerves to saddle up and come and get it 
 A product of the projects, my momma's only son 
 Made my first million dollars and a new drama would come 
 Didn't run from it, I ran to it 
 I'm not playin' 'bout the Unit and my fans knew it 
 Now make a lane for me 'cause I deserve this 
 I wonder what my enemies get when they hear this 
 Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through 
 If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do 
 I push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Get out my way, we ballin' like hey 
 I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway 
 Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga 
 You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga 
 You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga 
 You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me 
 Got a blunt of green sticky and my AK wit me 
 If a motherfucker hit me, I'ma knock his head off 
 I ain't scared of none of y'all, bitch, I'm runnin' from the law 
 Put your trigger fingers up, if you will knock they head off 
 Pushing weight all through the state 
 It's like I speed up when they tell me, "Pump my brakes" 
 If I told you what I make every time I flip a kii 
 You would prolly try to take the same trip that I take but you can't 
 Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through 
 If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do 
 I push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Get out my way, we ballin' like hey 
 I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway 
 Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back 
 Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
