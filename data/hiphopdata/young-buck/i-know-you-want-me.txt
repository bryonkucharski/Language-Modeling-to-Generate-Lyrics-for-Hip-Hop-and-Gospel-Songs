 Jazze Pha that is for all you numbskulls out there 
 Hey speakin' of pimpin' that's my nigga 
 Young Buck! 
 (Chorus - Jazze Pha) 
 Just hop in my ride 
 If you want some 
 We can only get high 
 If you want some 
 Gotta open them wide 
 If you want some 
 I can see in your eyes that you want some 
 I know you want me shawty 
 I Know (x4)

 (Verse 1 - Young Buck) 
 These hoes out here love me 
 I get it wet 
 N*ggas old ladies want to fuck me 
 You should see the shit 
 I'm nothin' like them other thugs 
 That eat it quick 
 Too many n*ggas in this club 
 I need a bitch 
 We park right up in the front 
 You see the six 
 I puff some smoke up out my blunt 
 And pop the Chris 
 I gotta find me a model 
 I like 'em thick 
 I make her hop in my Impala 
 Go take a trip 
 Clean off my shoe and pop my collar 
 I'm rich bitch 
 Oh what you never seen a balla 
 Well this is it 
 I make that p*ssy feel good 
 Till you tell me quit 
 And I won't tell nobody that you let me hit 
 Sike! 
 (Chorus - Jazze Pha) 
 (Verse 2 - Young Buck) 
 Okay then shawty if you ready 
 Then lets go 
 Lets take it from the dirty to the East and West Coast 
 A couple shots of Patron 
 Lets have a sex show 
 I got a lot but baby 
 You can be my best ho 
 I see you watchin a playa 
 She like my dress code 
 Rockin' these Cardieys 
 Drinkin' that X-O 
 I know a place that we can go 
 And get low 
 You wit a gangsta 
 You ain't never felt like this before 
 And if you know that p*ssy good 
 Then hit tha floor 
 Shake that a*s like you should 
 Go get that dough 
 I'll make you love me if you let me 
 Fo' real though 
 See down here we put Chevy's ridin' real slow 
 So come on 
 (Chorus - Jazze Pha) 
 (Bridge - Young Buck) 
 Don't get scared girl 
 Show me what you got 
 Show me what you got 
 Just show me what you got 
 I said Don't get scared girl 
 Show me what you got 
 Show me what you got 
 Just show me what you got 
 C'mon Don't get scared girl 
 Show me what you got 
 Show me what you got

 I said Don't get scared girl 
 Show me what you got
