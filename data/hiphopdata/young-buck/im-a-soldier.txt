 You gettin' robbed (Give me that) 
 We all talkers, Standin' out on this street corner 
 That's why you see the lil kids wit the heat on them (What up!) 
 Police pull up, hop out, But they can't catch us 
 They never even get the chance to say "Drop your weapons" 
 Liquor stores never close, The whole hood high (Come on) 
 Nigga's know when it's war the whole hood ride (Yeah)
