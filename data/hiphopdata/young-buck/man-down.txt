 G.unit 
 Eyo spider 
 Eyo hit that nigga banks up 
 Tell 'em man 
 Ey man I just seen the niggas man 
 (Yeah) 
 Yeah man tell a nigga call pete 
 Call a nigga half tell 'em niggas common man 
 (Wassap) 
 Them niggas over there 
 Man a nigga slippery man 
 They all been fucking with some hoes and shit 
 Common niggas let's go 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 (Let's gooo) 
 If you just a nigga spinnin outside 
 We gone hustle bout da wide 
 Overside 
 Nigga hit there ass up 
 Every body die when the bullets start to fly 
 Let 'em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up 
 Man down (aeeeh) 
 Some body got hit 
 Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip 
 Man down (awhh) 
 You hear 'em people screamin 
 They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin' 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Since homie know ma face 
 Ain't no need for no ski mask 
 Hollow tips can make a nigga go to sleep fast 
 Catch 'em stuck and show 'em nauf in his E class 
 Pull up and put a hole in his cheap ass 
 Bought a glock and a kayne with a body on it 
 And show the blood over spit nobody else want it 
 Whole kinda bitch throwem in da back seat 
 Empty out the clip make them hoes wanna track me 
 Don't you love it when your enemy has lost 
 And the sound of the 12 gage when it sound doze 
 U cathc that ass slippin and he blame it on hiss boss 
 Begin or his life askin you how much it cost 
 A bullet has no eyes and the trigger has no heart 
 The people never stop so the war bout to start 
 Don't be out there 
 Am tellin' nigga as soon as filthy dark 
 We gone circle bout da block 
 And throw it less you want 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 (Let's gooo) 
 If you just a nigga spinnin outside 
 We gone hustle bout da wide 
 Overside 
 Nigga hit there ass up 
 Every body die when the bullets start to fly 
 Let 'em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up 
 Man down (aeeeh) 
 Some body got hit 
 Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip 
 Man down (awhh) 
 You hear 'em people screamin 
 They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin' 
 (Verse 2: Prodigy) 
 Ningga ma slow flows ain't touch a bow 
 Your fans cahnge their mind 
 When P comes through 
 'Cause I be sittin' in da drop 
 Skimmin with the top 
 Then your hoes saw the video now they wanna pop 
 And maybe 'cause I gave David that stack 
 He cover ma risk with invisible sacks 
 Fresh off the private jacks 
 Now we in da projects takin' pictures with the kids 
 Call me ORP or VIP da dawn 
 The people love me 'cause I say what they want 
 Tell these rappers they ain't shit they mommas too 
 When you see me in da streets whachu gonna do 
 Pull your heads down to your feet and grow somewhere else 
 Better escape far make sort out your grill 
 Nigga am laughin' at the top of the world 
 It's the unit 
 Pray that you could do it 
 How we do it 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 (Let's gooo) 
 If you just a nigga spinnin outside 
 We gone hustle bout da wide 
 Overside 
 Nigga hit there ass up 
 Every body die when the bullets start to fly 
 Let 'em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up 
 Man down (aeeeh) 
 Some body got hit 
 Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip 
 Man down (awhh) 
 You hear 'em people screamin 
 They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin'
