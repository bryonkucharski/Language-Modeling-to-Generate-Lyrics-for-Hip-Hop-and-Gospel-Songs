(Verse- Young Buck) (Prodigy) 
 The sound of gunshots, the smell of swisha sweets 
 Ki's of cocaine is all a nigga see 
 And all these niggas be lookin' for a lick to hit 
 'Cause it don't look like we leavin' these bricks to quit 
 On them hot summer nights we be servin' them whites 
 On them cold winter days we be shootin AK's 
 You ain't safe around here or in the yard 
 Its everyman for himself nigga livin' is hard 
 You see the cars, the bars, the ghetto super stars 
 Some niggas got money and forgot who they are 
 We rob, kill, steal, whatever 
 ("Ayo dunn when you gettin' out the hood"), Never 
 My people need me, my heart is still here 
 Even tho police be hatin' I'm still here 
 I'm standin on this corner till my pockets bigger 
 I'm goin' to my grave as a project nigga 
 (Chorus- Young Buck/(Prodigy)) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Yo we hood niggas, Project Niggas, everybody know we some ghetto ass niggas) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Straight hood niggas, Project Niggas, y'all better know we some ghetto ass niggas) 
 (Verse- Prodigy) 
 P is a triple threat, VIP, the Don't 
 P, bitch get a look at his arm 
 We megastars, we got bulletproof cars 
 And we ridin' in them shits, with the guns in the door 
 Baum, is the only thing we smoke 
 I ain't pickin' seed out my weed since '94 
 In New York, the projects is where we feel safe 
 Surrounded by the others like us, we embrace 
 All the bullshit, get you niggas a void 
 This is our life, we ain't got no choice 
 Look we enjoy ourselves in the middle of hell 
 Shots poppin' niggas might run up on you with and tell 
 Like blow you away, you'll die with ya gun on ya waist 
 Half assed in a bare cold case 
 Nigga you ain't got strength like the Mobb and G-Unit 
 In the ghetto, my niggas rear run up in ya place 
 (Chorus- Young Buck/(Prodigy)) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Yo we hood niggas, Project Niggas, everybody know we some ghetto ass niggas) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Straight hood niggas, Project Niggas, y'all better know we some ghetto ass niggas) 
 (Verse- Havoc) 
 Gun through these niggas that stay hatin' 
 Blood I can taste it, Buck I'm losin my patience 
 This rap shit, dudes got it fucked up boy 
 Don't you know we gettin' money so we got more toys? 
 I fucked ya bitch, think nothin' of it 
 Got mad drama but we still out clubbin 
 We still out gunnin, dumpin the Mac clips 
 Homie we got this and y'all ain't have this 
 Baby ain't nothin' you know I'm spittin' that crack shit 
 Like I'm still on the block, bunch of police flippin 
 Still in the kitchen cookin, workin that Trip Beam 
 Have fiends baggin watch them lick the plate clean 
 Do this for my niggas up north from them state greens 
 Bustin' them hammers for clippin my sing sing 
 All my hood niggas don't worry just maintain 
 You know what it is G-Unit's what I bang 
 (Chorus- Young Buck/(Prodigy)) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Yo we hood niggas, Project Niggas, everybody know we some ghetto ass niggas) 
 You can take me out the hood but the hood still in me 
 A Project Nigga till the Lord convict me 
 (Straight hood niggas, Project Niggas, y'all better know we some ghetto ass niggas)
