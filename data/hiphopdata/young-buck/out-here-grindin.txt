(Intro - Talking) 
 Damn 
 What everybody lookin' at me for? 
 I mean, I'm out here just like you nigga 
 Shit 
 You ain't got shit, I ain't got shit 
 But that don't mean, we ain't the shit 
 Rain pours when I open up the Range doors 
 The young boys slang 'caine from they front porch 
 Show 'em love, let 'em know they ain't playin' wit' 'em 
 Ya homies locked up, ya might be stayin' wit' 'em 
 Act like ya don't know they haters 
 They make us tax payers 
 And then section 8 us (Fuck 'em all) 
 White lady but she had a black baby 
 A nigga fell in love and we look at her crazy 
 We all got guns, and so do Dick Cheney 
 They trick on hoes, I make my bitch pay me 
 These are the things that they scream 
 As I lean to the left by myself wit' no team 
 Tell the kids to go to school 
 They tell me they ain't breakin' no rules 
 'Cause when the bell rings, then it's back to no food 
 Ya have no clue what we goin' through 
 Ya need a hundred to fill up what I'm 'posed to do nigga 
 Ya in my ear, but there's money out here 
 And I'm always here, when none of y'all here 
 Which one of y'all scared? (Which one of y'all scared?) 
 Okay, 'cause you said let's get this bread and I did 
 Shit I wanna do it big, and I just can't wait 
 So you gotta live wit' the decisions that you make 
 I'm gettin' cake, let 'em hate, I'ma elevate 
 I sold my soul to the streets playa, it's too late 
 Sunrise, gun fires, and another dies 
 Mother cries, brother rides, now that's two lives 
 You and I both know that that was suicide 
 Same shit woulda happened if you'da died 
 Thirty guns, fifty deep, ten niggas shootin' 
 O.G.'s keep ya eyes on who ya recruitin' 
 Back then they was ridin' and lootin' 
 You lookin' at the 2000 Huey P. Newton 
 True deciphile, swag like a el rookin' (?) 
 Ain't heard it like this since 'Pac, I might spook 'em 
 Choosen, you tryna be chosen, it's a white man's world 
 If we win we losin', abusin' ya blessin' 
 I'm givin' you a lesson, but it's goin' in the right ear 
 And out the left one, I tell the kids education is the key 
 Then a student in Virginia went on a killin' spree 
 Look at me 
 (Outro - Talking) 
 Y'all know what to do right? 
 Take care of what'cha got homie 
 I mean, ya never know what'cha got till it's gone right? 
 Do what you gotta do man 
 Support you and yours 
 God giveth, God take it away 
 Young Buck
