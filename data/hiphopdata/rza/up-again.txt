 Alright, great job 
 Dear momma, no need for the head drama 
 I quit slinging that yac', don't need the feds on us 
 I made a mil' off the deal, legit 
 And after I pay the tax, I'ma buy us a crib 
 In the winter, I'ma buy us a whip 
 So we can take long trips, just me and the kids 
 I'm up again, I never let you down 
 Nothings ever gonna stop me now 
 I'm up from the gwop, don't gotta hide from the cops 
 Plus homies got a spot, they can stay off the block 
 They can drop a few tracks or spar a few minds 
 The God, home from the pen, he left the yard behind 
 Got a brand new sampler, take the breaks and I loop it 
 Got a license for the gat in case the public is stupid 
 Plus I ain't afraid to shoot it 
 A man with the family is firmly rooted 
 We on top right now, we living 
 Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us 
 Oh and look at this luxury, sweet in here 
 We did it, we ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing no more 
 We on top right now, we living 
 Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us 
 I always knew you was gonna make it 
 You was a dreamer from day one 
 What shall I speak, about the brothers that passed? 
 Make me weak about the knees, make me wanna bust ass 
 Or should I kick knowledge and I ain't even graduate 
 But take it from me, it ain't cool to skip class, imagine it 
 Five Gods, came to picture perfect to ovulate to it 
 Music and expression of freedom, escape to it 
 Not much to it, we was born and conceived to it 
 And me being the man that I am, it's like we knew it 
 Surrounded by a civilized man, a weak woman 
 Subconsciously be planting a fed inside children 
 Allow me to explain my cause 
 Who I B E R E, Double T A, N I N E 
 A.k.a K I N E T I C 
 My attribute B O R N, G O D, Allah 
 Searching for the truth in myself, I seen, I saw 
 In order to achieve it all, must give my all 
 I always knew you was gonna make it 
 You was a dreamer from day one 
 Look at how you killing 'em right now 
 Why don't you go get you a massage or something, daddy 
 Ain't gotta worry 'bout none of that 
 Matter fact pass me the oil 
 I got you all day, you know you did your thing 
 Just sit back and relax 
 Yeah, Off up in the C H I C A to the G O 
 Where the winter time temperature be twenty below 
 Knee deep in the snow the Reverend still get dough 
 To pay the bills, feed his family and go get more 
 Money, now we taking trips to Jamaica just to relax 
 My homies came a long way since paper from g-packs 
 But gone, they used to be pushing BP's and Zenax 
 Now, they wire us our paper back and forth like we fax 
 We ask the lord and savior for guidance 
 It's probably hard to hear us over gunshots and violence 
 Figure when I'm in the casket it'll be plenty silence 
 So in the end when you add it up it all balance 
 The crew been up, staying higher than pallets 
 On vacations in the islands, watching women with talents 
 Fellowship and with the family members who be the wildest 
 Now we live in mansions, castles and golden palaces 
 Enjoy everything that you put your hard work into 
 Look at the gold on the lamp, baby 
 Look at the size of this TV 
 Look at everything 
 Just take up all the beauty in this room right now 
 Look at how you did your thing, you did it 
 We living right now 
 We ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing no more, yeah 
 Up again, I'll never let you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop me now 
 Up again, I'll never let you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop me now 
 Up again, I'll never let you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Never let you down, never let you down 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now 
 Up again, I'll never you down 
 Nothing's ever gonna stop us now
