 Aiyo, I wanna dedicate this song right here to O-Ren Ishii 
 Half Chinese/Half Japane-see, Half American and yo 
 Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection 
 She got the sinister cat eyes and little freckles on her complexion 
 Cheaper than Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa 
 And she got Crazy 88 killers that'll slice right through ya 
 Quick to chop a head off then wipe the blood off 
 A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off 
 You got a minute to pray and a second to die 
 You can see the image of the devil reflectin' inside her eye 
 But since she was a little girl, yo, she never would cry 
 She seen so much tragedy, let me explain to you why 
 She grew up on the military base, where she had to face 
 The brutality of her mother and her father being erased 
 The blood drops from her tear drops, on her cheek you seen her smear spots 
 She solomly watched, as the shogun sliced through her dear pops 
 Through his thick skull, yeah she's viscius like a pit bull 
 And when it comes to hatred and revenge she got a shit full 
 Revenge is the fire that burns inside your soul 
 Aiyo, she's been busting up knee caps son since the age of 11 
 But fuckin' her enemy to death, that was her favorite weapon 
 And in death you paid in hell Boy it can't be paid in heaven 
 You better get down on your knees son and start praying to the reverend 
 Bon Appetite, Boy revenge is so sweet 
 Especially when it's served on a cold dish 
 But she has no wish but to cut yo day short like the winter solstice 
 And the chance to receive a slight bit of mercy from her was hopeless 
 Oren Ishii, half Chinese, half Japane-see, half American 
 Oh, what a species
