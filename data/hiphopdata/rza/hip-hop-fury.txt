Chorus- Rza 
 You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock 
 Fuck wit the Wu we bustin' ya whole snot box 
 Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock 
 Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop 
 Verse 1- Hell Razah 
 Here's something to advertise, promote it keep the fan satisfied 
 Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide 
 Leave 'em paralyzed, they stolen every word I provide 
 Without no clearence, I nurture this track like Amish parents 
 Got requests from retail stores, for my appearance 
 First we target it, then they market it, to kill ya artist wit 
 The hungry shark, contra hit, whoevers starting shit 
 Got as many rap soldiers, for how much this record ships 
 Fuck them niggaz you record with, I make them forfit 
 Send a bomb rap fed ex into ya office, son we buil and deliver 
 Came to build with the Gza, 
 Check the chorus from the Rza, the real album spitta 
 Me and my street team be holding congress meetings 
 Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking 
 Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you 
 It's the coming of the newest hip hop Christ 
 Pop you, try the BDS and soundskins from war fans 
 Ya whole roster can't take on, one Sun of Man 
 Get ya street team, get ya sickest out, put ya posters up 
 Boost ya bucket up, still Razah gonna fuck it up! 
 Chorus- Rza 
 You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock 
 Fuck wit the Wu we bustin' ya whole snot box 
 Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock 
 Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop 
 Verse 2- Gza 
 Industrialize niggaz change soon as ya get in 
 Throw 'em on a auction block, CEOs bidding 
 Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made 
 It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated 
 I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales 
 Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell 
 I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst 
 Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst 
 Full tank, with the premium quallity raps 
 Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap 
 Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex 
 Looking like rockwell wearing Vnecks 
 Ya learn from this earn from this 
 Niggaz getting tossed and turned for this, burned for this 
 Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs 
 I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas 
 Verse 3-Timbo King 
 The microphonus, collect the bonus, aiyo we on this 
 House niggaz verse the homeless 
 Ten to one, Tim's the one 
 Royal famous, the verbal painless 
 The dark gallery, million dollar pictures 
 Import from poor to riches, leanin on doors 
 We move across the broklynn bridge doing 60 
 Illegal driving, from dusk to red dawn 
 The Gza/Genius, Wu-tang we live long 
 Verse 4- Dreddy Kruger 
 True indeed, I hook tracks like my seed 
 Persona, wack MCs do me notta 
 King solomon the great, came to evaporate the fake 
 Yeah you, you know your power-U 
 Ya reconize the voice, it's that nigga from the Wu 
 Every dart I spit gets mastered and promoted 
 Ya just been demoted, cause ya sweet and sugar coated 
 Ya folded, ya style is half stale and molded 
 So mold it 
 Chrous- Rza 
 You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock 
 Fuck wit the Wu we bustin' ya whole snot box 
 Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock 
 Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop
