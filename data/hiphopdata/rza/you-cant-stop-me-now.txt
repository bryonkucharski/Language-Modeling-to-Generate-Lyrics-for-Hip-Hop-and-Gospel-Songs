Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up, round up, round up 
 Round up, round up 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes 
 While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes 
 Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up 
 A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up 
 Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up 
 My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up 
 And cops flood the block, no way to eat 
 So I dropped a half a G 
 On a rented SP-1200 Sampler and a Yamaha Four-Track 
 The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back 
 While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up 
 Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up 
 Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up 
 Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck 
 When I was stressed I would head to the rest 
 Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed 
 Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat 
 In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP 
 We went platinum, whoo-peesh, yeah, we flatten 'em 
 Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em 
 Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em 
 All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em 
 You can't stop us, you can't block us, rock us or mock us 
 Knock us or top us, better sit back and watch us 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 Can't stop me, man 
 No matter how hard, you better go hard 
 So hard, if you gon' try and stop me now 
 I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild 
 Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down 
 Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride 
 Without a homicide, case and trial 
 It's a long time comin', long nines bustin' 
 Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin' 
 Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin' 
 The shit that I been through, things that I've seen 
 The chicks that I ran through, places that I've been 
 I'm a victim of the very song I sing 
 That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it 
 Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics 
 I'ma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is 
 Either you pay with your life or you pay dues and homage 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now 
 No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
