(Hook: woman) 
 We pop, we brawl, gettin' money till the day we fall 
 We pop, we brawl, gettin' money till the day we fall 
 (RZA) 
 Double barrel shotgun, pop son 
 I told nigga, just not run 
 I saw him on 205th in Fordham 
 This dog was frozen, so my high heat thawed him 
 I blown ya, you need a blood donor 
 My bitch ghetto, like Florida and Laronia 
 Laundry mat hoes, who bought clothes? 
 I flow checks, one followed by six o's (six o's) 
 I got hoes, in codes, in different areas 
 Four ton whips that's sittin' on interiors 
 The bass shake in the club like it's earthquakin' 
 I cock arm, pass the bomb, like Troy Aikman 
 Play the face, but like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson 
 You miserable, you get kidnapped by Kathy Bason 
 Thrown to the dungeon, for your spongin' 
 Of Wu Killa Bee, what's your total malfunction? 
 (Shacronz) 
 Come on, let's cut the crap, money 
 I've been gettin' this rap money 
 Crack money, stack money, I'm tryin' to get that Shaq money 
 That Mike Tyson, Michael Jordan, Michael Jack' money 
 Five hundred mill' and better, dog, yeah, now that's money 
 Act funny, y'all make me laugh (haha) 
 Frontin' like you tough, you softer than a baby's ass 
 These lazy ass, lazy -- fuck you! Pay me cash 
 My crazy path will motor me into a Mercedes class 
 (Chorus: Shacronz) 
 We pop, we brawl, get money till the day we fall 
 My glock, my fall, those shots through your bedroom door 
 From the P's, to the morgue, cop Louie all the way to my drawers 
 We pop, we brawl, get money till the way we fall 
 (Freemurda) 
 All y'all can see is the back of my jersey 
 Blowin' in the wind, goin' back to Jersey 
 Off to Brooklyn, left you back in Jersey 
 I was doin' a buck 90 like a throwback jersey 
 Shame on a nigga, take it back to Dirty 
 Run, game on a nigga, I'll be back in thirty 
 Seconds, got the world's greatest reckon 
 And that money I'mma spend it like your greatest record 
 This Division, all the ladies respect it 
 Disrespect it and the eighty'll check it 
 It ain't hard to see how y'all ignorin' the steel 
 Niggas that I clap, lookin' for me still 
 Till they look like they came out of George Foreman grill 
 Thoughts are stolen on Free, must be on them crills 
 Plus my, team gon' be holdin' like forty mill' 
 Thoughts are rollin' on E., must be on those pills
