(Featuring Christ Bearer and Prodigal Sunn) 
 (RZA) 
 Yo, sting of the dragon master, one blow make your jaw shatter 
 Have you walk around with your face wrapped in plaster 
 Gaspin'... *gasp*, like you got a bad case of asthma 
 Spot the dog, you try to run faster 
 Wild savage, but he bow down to his master 
 Wash it down with a ice cold Shasta, he would shout 
 (Chorus: RZA) 
 I am free from you, so unleash me 
 There's nothin' else you can do to teach me 
 Nothin' else you can do to appease me 
 I know this point in life, it wouldn't be easy 
 I gave you my all, I would equal 
 Out of care, through my hands and all 
 Just to show and prove, you my man's and all 
 Didn't even try to make plans at all 
 (Prodigal Sunn) 
 My hand's cut in the outer, leakin' the contender 
 Hit 'em high, stick 'em low, break through the center 
 Somebody screamin' ambulance, yo, he bend a 
 Ghost like a ninja, whole 'nother agenda 
 Yes, we day and night, ready for fight 
 Plus I spit more through the mic, four fist right 
 Chest, head, body blow, would leave, anything goes 
 Broken nose, shatterin' jaws, spark him with the C-4 
 P-Sunn did it from the east door 
 The more I tour, the more I score, watch the lion roar 
 Through the field, with the skills and agility 
 Martial art ability, bend the laws of gravity 
 Stay in shape, no cavities 
 Some wise words from a young one, trained to reach mastery 
 (Chorus: RZA) 
 I am free from you, so unleash me 
 There's nothin' else you can do to teach me 
 (Christ Bearer) 
 I am free from you, Buddhapest fist, Tai Chi, Kung Fu 
 Master sick cool, jujitsu, round house kick you 
 Forty elbows, then I left right hit you 
 Master set me free, although you'll never let me get the master key 
 'Cause when it's time for beef, who could the master be 
 While I'm stopped, critique you see the master flee 
 But cats keep rushin', I'll back flip bust you 
 Crack your rib cage apart, snatch your heart, that's nothin' 
 Guillotine chop, to the Philippine hot 
 Leave 'em worst, and sendin' them to Killa, get shot 
 I ate from my hands, and ate from the plan 
 Entranced, my fake was a glance 
 I gave you my all, I know you felt my slave to, and thought 
 I'm sittin' pool on y'all
