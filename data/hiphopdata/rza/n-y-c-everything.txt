(RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene 
 Now-Y-C/Now I see Everything 
 Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats throw inside a bing 
 Bobby Digital got the golden seal sting 
 Rhyme star, I write a hundred thousand dollar bar 
 My pinstripe comma deletes your power bar 
 Dr. Octopus tentacles, same as different song 
 Bob Digital instrumental, nothing's indentitcal 
 You biter, non-writer, Mr. Potato Head or Ida 
 Deep-fried crinkle cut, one nickel cup fucked your whole LP up 
 You must be stupid you liar 
 I'm the purifier, live wire, hip-hop reviver 
 A suicide mission you're committin, go against the Wu-Tang henchmen 
 Perfect precision marksman, spit darts an, flip charts 'an 
 Archery, shots aimed at your heart then 
 Daffy Duckest will still +Bring Da Motherfuckin Ruckus+ 
 Project Killa Hill be the buckest 
 Smoke blunts drink Bud Light beer wit Buzz Lightyear 
 Wet from here to infinity for them white hair 
 Bobby Digital, overthrow your whole citadel 
 Mista pitiful, your whole shrap stack is despicable 
 Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish 
 Cherish every moment of his love before you perish 
 Bitch, chicka chicka chich, watch me switch 
 Lookin' for a bird, I can hitch, into your atmosphere 
 Take your pussy out like a pap smear 
 Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear 
 Smack ya rear, vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider 
 Up inside ya, dick applehead, opens up your clit wider 
 Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a ?prider? 
 (Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi) 
 Stuck to your ass like a Victoria's Secret wedgie 
 Heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene 
 Now-Y-C/Now I see Everything 
 Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats thrown inside the bing 
 Bobby Digital got the killa bee sting 
 From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Green 
 Now-Y-C Everything, niggas who sling 
 Shaolin cats is thrown inside the bing 
 Bobby Digital got the killa bee sting 
 (Method Man) 
 Drink a Heineken, as we go inside the mind again 
 Nevermindin men droppin' gem, can he shine again 
 Most definite, let this be my last willing testament 
 For the pesimist, exercise for the Exorcist 
 Johnny Treacherous, like Three, I'm supposed to be 
 Perpetuous, desimate the poetry 'cause everything is close to me 
 The lectorous, Jonathan, king of the seven seas, battle wit Leviathan 
 The Methodist, poly to your deficit, hit it up 
 If I can't live it up somebody gotta give it up 
 John J., blow 'em out the water adopt the Bombay 
 Your bitch look like Strange', look at me the wrong way 
 Burn one and sautee, bringin' you different ways to sword play 
 They bustin' Bullets Over Broadway, Deep Cover 
 I'm like Larry when the Fish-burn, I burn rubber 
 'Cause I'm not an easy lover 
 To the midnight, butt naked wit a knife 
 Ask my a-alikes, I've been crazy all my life 
 Hardtime homicide, time flys, do or die 
 Crooked ass and crooked eye, scripture from the darkside 
 Johnny 5, I reside, in the killa bee hive, 
 Only the strong gon' survive 
 From the depths of the killa to the top, we're now born 
 Wildin on Staten Island be the poet John John 
 Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp 
 Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip 
 From the depths of the killa to the top, we're now born 
 Wildin on Staten Island be the poet John John 
 Can't forget Digi, if I did I'd feel gyp 
 Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip
