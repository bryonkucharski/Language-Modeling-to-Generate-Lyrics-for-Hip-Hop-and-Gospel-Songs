(Feat. Allah Real, Masta Killa) 
 (Hook: Allah Real) 
 When I was small 
 We had nothing at all 
 We used to eat Grits, for dinner 
 It was pain 
 Almost drive a man insane 
 What we could find for 
 To survive another day 
 But I said nah... 
 (RZA) 
 An old killa bee once hummed me a tune 
 Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon 
 Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room 
 Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon 
 Old Earth in the kitchen, yell "it's time to eat" 
 Across the foyer, ya hear the gather of stampeding feet 
 One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine 
 A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin' 
 Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy 
 Used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby 
 Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes 
 Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it 
 House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin' 
 Pillsbury box on the stove in the kitchen 
 (Masta Killa) 
 Young shorties in my hood started hustlin' 
 Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate 
 Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit 
 I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit 
 You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand 
 Drinkin', thinkin' of a masterplan 
 Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got 
 So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock 
 And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin' 
 Morning star Reggie makin' go good with the Grits 
 Now let's take it back for real 
 When we used to build at ghetto big wheels 
 With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on 
 Girls skippin' rope in the street 
 The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet 
 Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps 
 Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat
