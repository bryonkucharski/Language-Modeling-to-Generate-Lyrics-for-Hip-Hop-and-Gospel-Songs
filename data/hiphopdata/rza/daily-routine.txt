 Verse 1: Bobby 
 I'm paranoid of loiZOID 
 We fight like Guiver against the hyperZOID NOIDS 
 HIGH ACHIEVER mind computes like a THIEVER 
 Thoguhts connect like the quarterback to the wide receiver 
 Stay blunted drinking cokey nine hundred 
 Never fronting on my niggas on the battle zone 
 Thoughts flip before they change your whips on the 
 Good ship Jesus before Kimet was called Egypt 
 Before the bloods and crypts tomahawks and pimps 
 Eighteen pumas spazed we still had balds and braids 
 Amplify the sound of the earth rotation 
 Who could pin-point the exact location in space 
 It's to see hear and feel the earth rotation 
 That's why knowledge is the basic foundation of 
 All days and creation, like man is the foundation of 
 His family and the sun's the foundation of the solar system 
 Wisdom is the manifestation when words and actions are put 
 Into activation escape this captivation niggas busting 
 Wasting shots like masturbation transforming like gobots 
 They created a race of robots our new rulers are 
 Computers Abbott's been known now come through to us 
 Heads drifting in space like asteroids, 
 Pass the roids, savages trading places like Dan Akyroid 
 The truth is ignored, these devils must be destroyed 
 Chorus: Bobby 
 Search for the better things in life 
 Beef wid wife make a nigga live a street life 
 We smoke blunts, throw weight, pay rent 
 Verse 2: Baretta Nine 
 Yo, check it out, yo, one two, yo 
 Soon to smooth litigating 
 Camouflage educating 
 Baretta Nines barating 
 Only smoke rounds a day and 
 Ain't nothing to overdo the shit 
 Y'all niggas best to come up quick 
 We gonna start and finish it 
 'Cause I'm sure watch me murder it 
 Undersiege fatigue get bat at major league 
 Nine industry forms that be forced from catigues 
 We live righteous TC they go up do the same 
 Fuck the fame we hear the bill better keep your 
 Eyes peeled fuck around get killed it ain't safe no 
 Fucking more C-Ciphers at my door and I got more 
 Than one war, I'm gonna stay on my toes and do the one 
 To two timers, we gon' make this year our year to 
 Beware peace to rhymers our life is in a bond-a 
 Sware we gotta find a, way out we took the crypt ride 
 We all about, on these streets trying to make ends meet 
 Stay on my feet gotta eat God you things is deep peep 
 The sleep, How you see camouflage these cats 
 We on that bullshit, last days thinkings of snakes 
 And either pull it soft you know like an afro 
 Other cats sit like Castro I murder that snitch ass 
 Donnie Brasco, We dissatisfied of your devils 
 Running running high, my mind and my physical be unified 
 To the day we testify we wanna be penalised 
 Form God Allah motherfuckers best recognise 
 Chorus: RZA 
 A bag of dast mixed wid stress 
 Search for the better things in life 
 Beef wit wife make a nigga wanna live a street life 
 We smoke blunts, duck Jakes, pay rent, stay bent, 
 Attend wakes, baby make 
 Search for better things in life, 
 Beef wit wife, make a nigga wanna live a street life
