(Feat. Beretta 9, Featherz and Cilvaringz) 
 (RZA) 
 The grand ultimate supreme, no extremedies 
 We use Tai Chi to deflect off our enemy 
 Five poisons, from the Clan there's no Remedy 
 We dispell the smell of wickedness in our vicinity 
 Bobby, the atomic, Islamic, bomb-droppin' 
 Appear in your atmosphere like the comet 
 Heading to the Western Hemisphere, non-stoppin' 
 Strikin' the belly of the seed to make it vomit 
 Things of beings is unseen by men 
 In shapes and form, never been dreamed by men 
 The word of God, always intervene with sin 
 From insight, my inner-light beams within 
 Pin-point focus, move silently un-noticed 
 When you attack, I fall back in the wind like the lotus 
 Put the soul in the track like my name was Otis 
 Pain in my heart and your chance is hopeless 
 For you to win, a change is gonna come 
 You heare the "suuuu"?, Wu-Tang is gonna come 
 And my vocals, they gonna bang on the drum 
 You go against the grain you will hang from ya tongue 
 So... 
 (Hook: RZA (Feathers) 
 (Love) love (Love) love (thugs) thugs 
 This is in yo' club (club) 
 Nigga pass the mothafuckin' drugs (drugs) 
 (RZA) 
 Just smooth a loop... 
 To my soundwave there's no sonic solution 
 No Pro Tools to edit or out-date my producin' 
 Form like crystals, mushrooms after the missile 
 We strike into the hip-hop bone, of the gristle 
 And my thoughts be the marrow, son I'm the narrow 
 Tube inside the gun that's released through the barrel 
 And the words travel in lead, expandin' high-speeds 
 With the hole in ya head, and filled up you 
 With the, knowledge of self 
 I dropped out of school, I went to the college of self 
 And I pertained my wealth, B-O-B-B, when y'all niggaz see me 
 I'm like Godzilla stompin' over Mount Fiji 
 Or Rodan with the wingspan, Prince Rakeem can 
 Rocks to the solo or combine with my team and 
 Spit like the calico, welcome to the Alamo 
 Bop-bop-bop, you know how you cowards go 
 (Hook - first line only) 
 (RZA) 
 Welcome back to my hip-hop club! 
 (Beretta 9) 
 Psycho-menace, downin' a Guinness 
 Strictly bidness, while I'm in this 
 Flip on a nigga like a gymnast 
 Put a knot on ya head, the size of Grimace 
 Bitch, jumpin' out ya speaker 
 Huntin' for yo' egg like it's Easter 
 Although I come in peace, I would just like to say peace to 
 Scallywags, skeezers, and I don't really need ya 
 You don't understand why I don't understand either 
 Now shit's gettin' deep, you should've thought a lot deeper 
 It's my time to get over and I got on my blinker 
 So I write and I spit on the mic, so you can feel 
 What is truth, what is right and what's not 
 Yo I must kill the ideal and enlight this Earth 
 And yo I will give birth to a light that lives to keep it real 
 All through research, I learned in schools, not even Church 
 Can enstill, these words are jewels so you can heal 
 Still I search, and I works real hard, I need a deal 
 And with speed 'cause it hurts indeed 
 Yo can you feel? my heart still pumps the blood that makes me bleed 
 All real and the pastor's best and I always will, do my thing 
 (RZA) 
 Yo let me know son, yo... 
 X.O. Hennessey, Jack Daniel or Tennesee 
 Whisky, got these groupie bitches actin' frisky 
 (Beretta 9) 
 Searchin for that Bill like Lewinsky 
 All over my pants lookin' for a Jim Brownski 
 (Cilvaringz) 
 Ringz and Partnerz, Wu-Tang is how we fuck up Helsinki 
 Oh shit, Kinetic, Bobby Steeles 
 Origin/Barrakjudah, Wu-Tang Forever motherfuckers
