I could take the pitchfork from the devil 
 Keep a super suit like I'm incredible 
 From the deep, blue sea to the dark, blue sky 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'd grab a crocodile by his tail 
 Handcuff the judge, and throw the cops in jail 
 Make the meanest woman break down and cry 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I take no mess, and I take no jive 
 Sometimes I feel like I can fly 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good 
 Say my name three times, and you knock on wood 
 Candy man walks, I terrorize your hood 
 Flashing macs on a cop, the way a gangster should 
 I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger 
 Take a gasoline bath, and I walk through fire 
 Bear hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty 
 Take the sergeant hat from his head and use it for a Frisbee 
 Spit in a crocodiles face, have a menage a trois with two female apes 
 Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives 
 I drink honey straight from the beehive 
 Bungee jumping off the Empire State butt-naked 
 Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt-naked 
 I'm the baddest man alive, and I don't ṗlan to die 
 When the grim reaper come, I look him right in his eye 
 I bust off in the face of the witch of the East 
 Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, heh heh heh 
 I'm the man who stole the golden fleece 
 And I date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast 
 The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I take no mess, and I take no jive 
 Sometimes I feel like I can fly 
 I'm the baddest man alive 
 I'm the baddest man alive
