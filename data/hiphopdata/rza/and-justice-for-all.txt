Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital 
 Wu-tang, killarmy we indispensable 
 We never fall 
 We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all 
 (Killa sin) 
 We move on m.c.'s mechanically 
 Strike nerve like ghost vs. a canopy 
 Hard to touch ratarded fucks playing wit they fantasies 
 Respect this 
 Specialist 
 Black 
 Testing this will get ya necklace jacked 
 And named scratched up off my guestlist party freak 
 You the type of nigga that'll hardly speak 
 Unless you spoken to 
 We throw a cold screw 
 And sober up when I'm approaching you 
 At the same time we posting two 
 Niggas on tha ass-fist gonna do what they supposed to do 
 The limelight 
 Snatched away from you because it's my night 
 Killarm blaze inside of the twilight 
 You better get ya lines right 
 Half of thease crabs can't even rhyme right 
 Which dart slows wit body movement and blurry eyesight 
 What you want I already got 
 And after I control I keep head high, head pon-cocked 
 And pockets rollin' 
 You foldin' 
 You fagot ass fuck 
 (Dom pachino) 
 Yo farotion never fails 
 Shoot at darts sharper than a carpenters nail 
 Inhale life 
 Exhale strive anxiety's trife 
 Blowin' smoke out my piece pipe 
 Ducking the snipe 
 Shot off the top of the white house and cop 4's 
 War never does and many causes 
 My offense is my defense extreme precautious 
 Moving cyphers high valocities making you nautious 
 Ya forcing it 
 Parishly extortionists 
 Aborting this 
 Space ship that's spacious face it 
 I'm on contain shit 
 Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix 
 The case is 
 If not ya basic 
 Way to make shit 
 Embrace it 
 Knowing some day you'll have to face it 
 Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital 
 Wu-tang, killarmy we indispensable 
 We never fall 
 We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all 
 (So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas) 
 (Bobby digital) 
 Yo, yo hard to grapple 
 I raise the sharp scaple 
 Technique slaps you invasion body snatch you money grip 
 I smoke the honey dip 
 Blunts cherry bomb 
 Very calm 
 First bursts like a shot from the berry homes 
 You'd be most wise to pay close attention 
 To willy lynchin' 
 Its stupid to fuck wit' bobby steel's henchmen 
 I step into presidential 
 Credentials, evident my potential 
 Be infinate, deluxe benetic sluts invinsible 
 Only ones can know me 
 Swore me before the dolby 
 Alexis colby broads try to control me 
 Pussy whip me like toby 
 Fuck the local 
 I move global 
 Economical 
 Ship sea promise fool 
 My info glow 
 And the dark wu-tang logo 
 Sparks the attention, look listen observe 
 Killa bee swerv 
 Slam like dr. julias erv 
 Still strike the vital nerve 
 Charter through the magna carta 
 Trapped like otis and carter 
 Wild like the shaolin style or manos harbor 
 King devine forced to shine 
 Head burst open like a bottle of pine 
 Use penmenship 
 When I write my script 
 Blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless 
 Killa hill syndrome 
 Peace to two tone 
 He must know me to understand me from what you do 
 To realize I'm you 
 Everything I do honey bee from the bee hive 
 Ever-green squeeze dried leaf smoke killa priest from the tribe 
 Of levi smoke out and not steal 
 Or blunt spill 
 The indestructable bobby steel's is here 
 (Method man) 
 Yo in the heat of the night 
 My 4-7-7 mash on the mic 
 Killarmy and trappa john m.d. 
 Full metal jackets 
 'Cause' some gots to have it 
 Kill or be killed 
 Only time will reveal 
 I think by myself 
 And I drink by myself 
 From 9-8 until 
 Let me know it's real son if it's really real 
 Understandable 
 Self explainable 
 Caution john blaze flammable 
 When under pressure, interchangeable and still 
 Coming down like precipitation as I reign undesputed 
 How johnny do it 
 Dangerously, whoppin cough (cough, cough) 
 Two and off 
 Stank pussy make my dick soft (huh) 
 Bottom line be this high, explosive 
 Not for the average joseph 
 Come and get some 
 Hol' it, keep one 
 Up in the chamber 
 Blast wit' my middle finger 
 Now I toss men 
 Attack like the four horsemen 
 See me dog walkin' 
 Strickly getty-o slang talkin' 
 All up in thease guts, soften 
 Thease rap niggas, official 
 We slap niggas 
 Wit' mak' charges 
 Dope shit regardless 
 We usually take another niggas garments (what) 
 (Killarmy) 
 Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98 
 Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce like top notch politicians 
 Who be pola-tickin' 
 Slam through expand total construction across the planet and micro chip software 
 Placed in the rear of ya ear 
 As I sit the next year 
 All y'all analong niggas fuck y'all we be digital 
 Shit is critical 
 Like the hallways in my projects 
 Similar to the streets in tibet 
 Fuck that I ain't playin' wit' a full deck (son, son, son, son)
