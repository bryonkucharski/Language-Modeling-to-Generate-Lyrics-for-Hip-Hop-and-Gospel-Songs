Uh-oh second album out the stable 
 No worries about the paper, I ain't gettin' raped though 
 All about his payroll, BME is the label 
 Hoppin' out the fly shit, we ain't carin' what they do 
 [?] full of bitches, [?] glistens 
 She wanna Orlean hair little niggas 
 I'm in the lair in the air when she misses 
 It's the Trice gang, you know we about ta (bang) 
 OG up in this mafucker 
 Obie up in this mafucker 
 We got that heat up in this mafucker 
 Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang) 
 Got the flame young boy, [?] fired up 
 Got them things young boy, [?] 
 I guess the feds ain't got you niggas wired up 
 Cooperation with them people got you tied up 
 Literally tied up, vodka in the cup 
 Me in the club nigga, turning shit up 
 I spent a few dollars, long as lil mama swallows 
 After that y'all know what follows (bang) 
 My niggas [?] against the law: D-boys 
 Who give a shit we have legitimate decoys 
 We in this bitch like a fetal position 
 Don't let the heat come from wishin' when your piece end up missin' 
 Know that she in submission, on her knees in the kitchen 
 Forgive me for sinnin' Lord, her man she be kissin' 
 Put the key in ignition, she believe in my engine 
 When she speak about leaving him I just turn up the system 
 OG up in this mafucker 
 Obie up in this mafucker 
 We got that heat up in this mafucker 
 Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang) 
 We ain't worried 'bout money, we gettin' ours up 
 Trice party of 40, we tear them bars up 
 When local broads after hours involves us 
 Y'all can have 'em tomorrow dawg, we all love 
 The next city she wanna connect with me 
 Correction: she wanna put stress on her neck simply 
 Hit me on the text, meet right up at cha' exit 
 Guess your girls get naked (bang) 
 You stretch things when dawg puttin' his thing on it 
 Things keep comin' back, puttin' cream on it 
 It tastes good cause taste buds cling on it 
 The American dream: get money 
 See us comin', face just turned ugly 
 I don't let it bug me, you're still my lil buddy 
 Steal if niggas turn ill, [?] 
 Reveal you are here in [?] 
 OG up in this mafucker

 We got that heat up in this mafucker 
 Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang)
