Graduated you of M, summa cum laude, few of them 
 Just had her first IUD, ain't tryin' to have birth by Obie T 
 Louis bag, big as shit, rule area, Borics 
 Nigga need a cut, nigga need to get trimmed up 
 She so proper wit' it 
 Lingo lil' different when I say, "Let's hit that store" 
 She pronounce them words like she work for white people

 Magistrate's her mami, but it's more heat though, it's Miami 
 No beach clothes on her fanny, got a nigga ego so Grammys 
 I done won an award on the water, she'll never bored, I score 
 Shoot to the top floor, then record her, she in love wit' a bad boy 
 It's that Dior or [?], got her feelin' euphoric, bitch 
 What you think that you for? Perfect time to run through this dick 
 Say she like my lips, fell in love in licks 
 Never had it like this, growin' up, it stinks 
 Body so murderous 
 It's only right first forty-eight sit on a urban dick 
 She got on my baedar when I seen that she so cold 
 She don't care who they are, just as long as wit' O

 That appearance got them starin', that two dress oval-barin' 
 Them hips and ass so gifted 
 Nigga might think he just missed Christmas 
 I'm a put it on my wish list 
 Got to give it to the hood like the fellas I witness 
 I'm a get this, put a little bit of wood on her 
 Get straight to the business 
 Nah, it's VIP, KOD, fingerin' her booty hole, you know me 
 Baby on the pole, young PYT want to be wit' we, makes it three 
 Bottle-sippin' wit' the model citizens, she probably be a politician 
 Got to get it out her system 'fore the ballad kicks in 
 Cause, babe, they'll might go missin' 
 Just want to follow sister when her bottom's crimson 
 Body so convincin' 
 Nigga want to follow sister when her bottom's crimson
