(Obie Trice) 
 Every man determines 
 His definition of realness 
 What's real to him 
 Everybody got their own definition 
 Gangster man 
 Ok 
 Well, this is my definition 
 Of gangster, nigger 
 Surprise, motherfuckers 
 You thought I would never rise, motherfuckers 
 This Obie Trice, motherfuckers 
 Look in the eyes of a real guy 
 I ain't got the time for lies 
 Niggers frontin' like they lyin' 
 Nigger, you're not tough, we seize the bluff 
 These streets is too heated up for you to front 
 Dre laced the beat, heated up for you to bomb 
 Real name, no gimmicks 
 Givin' my niggers what they want 
 Fuck an image and a blunt, that ain't rap, dogg 
 Be who you wanna be but let it be fact, dogg 
 Don't ever let a nigger tell you 
 How you should act, dogg 
 Especially when your fuckin' 
 With automatics gats, dogg 
 These niggers ain't playin', I'm sayin' 
 I'm sprayin', do my dirty work with my hands 
 I'm a man, layin' a nigger down, he advance 
 You fuckin' with my plans, I'm lookin' for the truth 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 Look In My Eyes, 'cause I can love, I can hate 
 'Cause it's a thin line, walk around with my chest out 
 Like I got nine lives, never will, bitch, I'm just strapped 
 Before I find mine wonder what the future is like 
 Look In My Eyes, real G's anticipate 
 They got to have mine, all the hoes coppin' me out 
 Think it's about time niggers never open they mouth 
 'Cause they know I kinda find hard to figure me out 
 Look In My Eyes 
 (Obie Trice) 
 Aiyo, Obie's lookin' back 
 They askin' Obie 'How you cope with that'? 
 I cope estically man, I'm Kobe Bryant rap 
 I'm so defiant that the lines I'm invitin' on rhyme 
 I swear I'm outta my mind's sometimes 
 Out on the grind, my kind 
 Nickel and dime niggers, we ain't rich yet 
 We on the corner with a .40 and biscuit 
 Ready for bitch shit 
 Heavy drinkin', we ain't got good sense 
 My hood so tense, niggers so dense 
 I see through the life you invent 
 Slow up on how you niggers vent 
 You niggers ain't repestin' shit 
 I represent School Craft killers 
 Detroit nigger, my nigger, what? 
 The Realest 
 Exploitin' niggers, my nigger, what? 
 It's the point in the void, you fillin' 
 You feel us, we drillin' you with lyrics motherfuckers 
 Real life experiences 
 Eminem gave the clearance 
 So I'm here to show you niggers brilliance 
 Buildin' Shady Marine, no civilian 
 O Trice you're fuckin' with real proveliance 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 Look In My Eyes, 'cause I can love, I can hate

 Look In My Eyes 
 (Obie Trice) 
 This is what the streets done to me 
 Hungry, gun on me 
 Hopes high on the Key 
 Change of Community 
 Givin' up immunity 
 Raise future me's 
 You Look In My Eye's 
 Yeah, that's the dream Obie's seein' 
 And it seems as easy 
 As the rhymes Obie brings 
 But my eye's shows things intervene 
 All in-betweens like losin' my team 
 Losin' my freedom 
 Losin' my mind and the bein' 
 Bein' I'm bein', graduated from rice to beans 
 To obedience, congratulated on lights 
 I don' came too far to go backwards 
 My aim too extrane for y'all

 (Obie Trice) 
 Yeah 
 Look In My Eyes man 
 It ain't shit but real talk 
 Over here nigger 
 I would never send you else where 
 I got hair on my nuts, nigger 
 Grown man shit 
 That's how a nigger 
 Gettin' into to clubs, nigger 
 When I ain't got no ID 
 Flash my nuts on they ass 
 And bumped me right in, nigger 
 Ha ha, yeah
