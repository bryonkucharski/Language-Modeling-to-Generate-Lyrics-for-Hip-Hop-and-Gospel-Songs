(Eminem) 
 Naw 
 We ain't done 
 I love bein' hated, it's great it 
 Let's me know that I made it 
 I wouldn't have it no other way 
 I wouldn't trade it for the world 
 Only lets me know that I'm loved 
 By so many other motherfuckers 
 That hate you in this buzz 
 You keep fuckin' with us 
 We keep fuckin' you up 
 And keep pullin' the rug from up under you 
 And what's even more fucked up 
 Is we enjoy what were doin' so much 
 There ain't nothin' that we love more 
 Than pullin' your skirts up 
 And exposin' you hoes so much 
 People are startin' to wonder 
 What's up with the fuckin' 
 Wonder Woman underoos? 
 Do onto others as you will have done onto you 
 So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to? 
 When someone runs up with a mask 
 And puts a gun to you 
 You will ask yourself how come your man's 
 Didn't enter the last round that he had 
 In Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance 
 You keep askin' us to keep it on wax, but we can't 
 This is past any rationalization 
 We have captured national media attention 
 Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension 
 Start buildin' soon as we enter the 106 and Park Building 
 Someone's gonna get killed 
 And I swear to God if someone so much as even 
 Touches one of my people I'll put a million on his head 
 And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it 
 But I rather rap than get into this gangster shit 
 And it ain't because I'm a bitch 
 It's 'cause I ain't a bitch 
 I don't endanger people that I'm with 
 I'm a general 
 I ain't Bush 
 I don't send my soldiers to war if I ain't there 
 In the middle of this shit with em 
 So when I do get em 
 Orders to storm your head quarters 
 You be fuckin' with a 
 (Swifty) 
 A beat keeper, so you ain't eager 
 To greet this lyrical meat cleaver 
 That'll eat ya, niggers wanna keep speakin' 
 Like it ain't even that deep 
 I got heat that'll sweep a nigger's streets 
 So ya wouldn't fuck with me neither 
 Only heaven can help ya 
 I be searchin' for ya longer 
 Than The Legend of Zelda 
 Without a failure 
 It's gonna be Hell to tell the 
 Captain that a basset hound 
 Couldn't even smell ya 
 Body wanna hide ya 
 I'll be on that mob shit 
 You another hopper 
 Under the Renaissance, bitch 
 You get bombed like Lebanon with 
 On tactic 
 I'll snatch your head like one Saddam's men 
 (Obie Trice) 
 Motherfucker, I'll handle you 
 We can have it out on any avenue 
 An Average Man, flipped into an animal 
 Shoot out ya mandibles 
 Cannons and ammunition reload 
 With precision, nigger know the mechanicals 
 Break the pistol down you should see them handles 
 The streets taught the child no read up manuals 
 Pushin' crack valves, young Nino Brown 
 Chasin' green is the dream 
 When you're young and brown 
 Bound to be a problem child 
 Look what I'm involved in now 
 A Dozen Dirty niggers and they all get down 
 I'll solve any problem that enlarge 
 When I was on revolvers 
 We all get down 
 (Kuniva) 
 While you punchin' and tacklin' punks 
 I'm handlin' chumps, packin' the pump 
 That's longer than the elephant's trunk 
 On the streets I'm the beast, I'll feast 
 Upon the weak, so speak beef 
 I'll shoot you and scream 
 Increase the peace 
 The monster, pistol packin' 
 Pushin' niggers off they Hondas 
 Stomp ya, get it crackin' 
 Yankin' bitches for they Ganja 
 Sneaky as fuck 
 I don't think mamma beat me enough 
 When she was sleepin' and stuff 
 I was stealin' the keys to the truck 
 Shut the fuck up 
 Before you end up dead in the dump truck 
 Or in the streets takin' a nap 
 Bleedin' and locked up 
 You want what? 
 Like M Bleak with this heat 
 If your ten deep, then fuck 
 It'll be ten asleep 
 (Proof) 
 Don't mess with my alasnke 
 Don't tussle with my aspe 
 Clutch your burner 
 Bust it and watch your man bleed 
 We ferocious, toast, don't host us 
 Approach us 
 Through heat straight from the shoulders 
 We the soldiers, you're the youngster's 
 Youngster's among 
 Aren't ya dead in the dumpster? 
 Say to the monster head full of drama 
 You scared of the trauma 
 Vomit to monster 
 (Woof!) I'm back nigger 
 (Poof) I reappear 
 Shoot like, you ain't seein' clear 
 Blackness, carcass, cover with catfish 
 We mercers with no purpose 
 Other than practice 
 (Bizarre) 
 Theirs three things I hate 
 Liars, fakes, and cheaters 
 Alcohol, and sluts, and fuckin' wife beaters 
 I guess that describes my life 
 I don't even know whose song this is 
 Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck 
 About no Hip-Hop 
 At my release party 
 In a pink tank top in Reebok's 
 This Ja Rule beef, I'm not gettin' in 
 I need an R&B singer 
 To sing at my weddin' (Say yeah) 
 I'll turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty 
 I'll fuck your mommy 
 And go fishin' with your granny 
 I'll shit on you 
 I'll pee on R Kelly too 
 This is Bizarre 
 See you in Devil's Night 2
