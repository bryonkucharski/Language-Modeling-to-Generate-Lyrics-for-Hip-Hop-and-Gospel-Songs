I want my Dat back 
 I want my Dat back 
 I need my Dat back 
 I want my Dat back 
 Where the hell is my Dat at 
 I want my Dat back 
 I need my dat back 
 I want my Dat back 
 I need my Dat back 
 I want my Dat back 
 I played 13 for that 
 I want my Dat Back 
 I need my dat back 
 I want my Dat Back 
 I need my dat back 
 (Verse One) 
 Yo I been listen to you since I was a small crop 
 I bought your tape and watched your career flop 
 I post your face up in my room 
 You had the grim look so when I was mad nigga you was mad too 
 You blessed me with opportunity to listen 
 And by droppin' an album you made music my mission 
 I would turn on the TV 
 All I see is DMC who I truly want to be 
 And mama bought a karaoke machine 
 As present, so I can have sessions with the young adolescence 
 In my room 
 Fuck a cartoon 
 I'm to busy trying to get at you 
 With this music 
 And as time went on my skills got tighter 
 An unbelievable writer, unbelievable reciter 
 Hit the hip hop spots 
 Closed the ciphers 
 Obie trice dark like a phantom with flows 
 And by this time shit you like a platinum with those 
 I gotta get me a Dat 
 I need a Dat 
 What the hell is a dat? (Digital Audiotape) 
 Get a Dat 
 I gotta get a Dat 
 Yo What's a Dat 
 Hey yo you came to my town one day I got the word 
 The illest emcee in the rap game most preferred 
 I thought it was a start for me to exploit my style 
 And maybe you lend a hand out 
 So I dropped what the fuck I was doin' 
 Grabbed the DAT 
 Jetted to the weed spot 
 And blew the whole fuckin' sack with my man Joe 
 Who keep the ten-dollar Dats 
 He like you really bout to make it huh o" 
 I just laughed 
 Shot up out the spot 
 Started the engine 
 Hold the dat tight in my right, while I was steerin 
 Thinking to myself when the voices started blarrin 
 Hey yo hey yo hey yo 
 Arrived at the spot 
 Parking lot packed 
 Filled with rap-a-lots and bad boy cats 
 Timbos and backpacks 
 Hood thing playin' with Mecca 
 Old shirty and scissor hands 
 I got ta trippin' on them niggas when they started rappin' 
 They aggravating the line while you autographin 
 In fact when I finally reached ya 
 Them niggas got thrown out a long time ago, nice ta meet ya 
 Obie Trice nuttin nice 
 On this mic device 
 I got a Dat for ya tonight 
 Clinched in my right 
 But don't take it if you ain't gonna holla, aight 
 Hey yo I gave him the dat, now my foot is in the door 
 I gave him the dat now I'm bout to go on tour 
 Yo I gave him the dat my foot is in the door, I'm a bout to go on tour 
 Yeah Yeah 
 Now a year den past and I ain't here from yer ass 
 I den strapped some loot 
 Ready to jump in the coupe 
 Head for NEW YORK 
 And if I see ya I'm a shoot up all over your shit 
 Since I been wearing troops 
 And you can't call a nigga back to tell me that my shit is garbage 
 If I see you in concert I'm a snap 
 Slap you from the roof like Harley did Jack 
 I want my fuckin' dat back 
 Fuck that 
 Hey yo I need my Dat back 
 I paid $13.50 for that 
 Hey yo I want my Dat Back 
 Hey yo Where's My Dat at 
 I said you said you was gonna holla back 
 You Know I need my Dat back 
 I want my Dat back 
 I played $13.50 for that 
 And you ain't called me back 
 You know I want my fuckin' dat back 
 Cut it out 
 Cut it out
