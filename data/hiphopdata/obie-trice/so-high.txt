(Drey Skonie) 
 Not too many understand 
 They don't hear the truth 
 Youy think it's all a movie 
 If you only knew 
 I'm just making moves, money on my mind 
 I ain't spending time 
 Step in to my shoes, only on the grind 
 And I'm bout to fly, so high-i 
 So high-i 
 Yeah 
 Over a decade my debut 
 Dedicated to the music I could give a F less what they do 
 Respirator my efforts later, show what time I lose you 
 That's OK 'cause I'm courageous I play with time like a fool do 
 Who knew 
 I manoeuvre this new school, come from where two's got drew 
 Bullets let loose, lose someone in your crew 
 Dude in the lobby wanna shoot your body put him in ICU 
 Came to point proxy, gotta box your own way out like Rocky nigga 
 Rest in peace to big Proof I'm on my grind homie 
 Retribution for you, I keep my mind on it 
 Can't stop now, gotta see him on top now 
 Can't get locked now 
 'Cause he on the block pocket full of rock trying to lock up a small town 
 Never let my guard down, disregard you clowns 
 Discharge a few rounds y'all giving rich round three pounds 
 I'm getting rich, verbs and nouns so let me get the itch bird and pounds 
 It'll be hurricane Obie round this bitch, flood your town Nigga

 Yeah 
 Boy really from that bottom 
 Father leave, family fall, just like it's autumn 
 Let me be, when you see me turning up that bottle 
 I just need time to breathe that clear, never got the best of me 
 My therapy's what's best for me, young nigga looking for clarity 
 (?) 
 Apparently I was paralyzed when the pear split no paradise 
 No fear is given when a thug cry 
 No mercy nigga when a slug fly 
 Looking at life through my eye, sobriety nah uh 
 That's why I stay wide eyed, rare young nigga got a right eye 
 Fuck a DUI I miss my momma, pa stay high high 
 Out of options so I crack the seal intoxicants 
 I look to the sky intoxicated, no reply, irritated 
 Look in the mirror and I fear nature the end is near I see you later 
 We both creators, when I go hiatus 
 Until then I'm gross paper get a big dose of Obie haters
