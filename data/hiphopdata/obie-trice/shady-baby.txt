(Feat. Eminem) 
 Hey, what's a demon? 
 A demon is fun, a lot more fun... 
 (Intro: Obie Trice) 
 Guess who's back from Shady's faction 
 You gotta know that cause you made him Platinum 
 'Case you look past 'em and ask him 
 Is OT all right? I say easy bastards 
 Thought I wouldn't come back? Nigga you backwards? 
 He came from crack to obtaining his classics 
 Knowin' all that, get your ass in action 
 Cause now you have access to what's happenin' 
 (Verse 1: Obie Trice) 
 The flows eccentric 
 O is back with a mouth full of inventions 
 To hold my fans 
 Till the next album comes, like my second one has 
 [? ] Slept on, it's a thing of the past 
 I guess got some [? ] made 'em all laugh 
 When I shoulda been strapped, up with gats 
 But, I'm from the Ave so what's up with that? 
 Cause on previous tracks Obie's clutchin' mags 
 Look at him kickin' with fat chicks why would he brag? 
 What possesses him to do a song like that? 
 Shut the fuck up! 
 My nigga what's up? 
 Cats with no humor, in the club mugged up 
 You gon' get a facial tumor 
 Assuming that that looks persuasive or invasive to him 
 This is neither the time or place to pursue him 
 Baby party it up with Shady, under the influence 
 (Chorus: Eminem) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 Yeah were wilin', yeah were crazy! 
 (Whoo) Yeah come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 (Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us 
 Throw me in the club let's get fucked up! 
 (Verse 2: Obie Trice) 
 Okey dokey, Obie's back in the lab runnin' the track 
 On my second lap, ahead of these fags 
 Marshall Mathers laced the track 
 So I ride that as if he would have 
 Havin' a blast with a half a glass of Cognac 
 Next to my pen and pad 
 If I wanna get my abs intact call Curtis Jack for that 
 Make chicks have asthma attacks 
 The reaction is massive on the? 
 Shut the fuck up! 
 My bitches what's up? 
 Cats that perfuming in the club hugged up 
 You should get a different human 
 Assumin' the dude you're in tune with is wearing PINK 
 Instincts to tell you he's a freak 
 He ain't interested in you, he's lookin' at G 
 (Hahaha) 
 (Chorus: Eminem) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 Yeah were wilin', yeah were crazy! 
 (Whoo) Yeah come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 (Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us 
 Throw me in the club let's get fucked up! 
 (Verse 3: Obie Trice) 
 No rehearsals the flow is cursed 
 I spit it in cursive you know it's curtains 
 Return with a banger that's so assertive 
 DJ spinnin' 'em in circles certainly 
 Hence the urgency, servin' them since the birth of me 
 Get an intense verse from Obie - Wan Kenobi 
 One and only, nothing like a phony 
 Coordinate and macaroni 
 Plus I clap your homie 
 Actin' like he ain't have access to madness 
 (?) 
 Fuck that, let's relax a moment 
 Before we fuck around over react and blow it 
 Do it for the folks those who know how to act enjoyment 
 Actually this is Shady gatherin', spoil it 
 It'll beat that ass like a Prince performance 
 (Chorus: Eminem) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 Yeah were wilin', yeah were crazy! 
 (Whoo) Yeah come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo) 
 You can't stop us Shady baby 
 So come party with my crazy group 
 (Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us 
 Throw me in the club let's get fucked up!
