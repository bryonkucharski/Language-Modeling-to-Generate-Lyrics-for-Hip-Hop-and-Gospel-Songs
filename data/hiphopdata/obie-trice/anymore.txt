Obie Trice 
 Yeah I then had some empty years 
 Lost a few peers even shed a few tears (Proof!) 
 For my niggas ain't here 
 But even from up there they whisper in a boy ear (pppsss) 
 Say Obie how dare you stand clear when you the realist nigga there 
 Bring fire Obidiah God admire ya (Dear God) and I'm a servant of him from urban to Em 
 From Em to now what I'm deserving is slim (nah) 
 Like BME ain't as urgent as them 
 I murdered every verse you purchased back then 
 Nuttin rehearsed no actin' 
 No reenactments "O" so actually 
 Actually it hurts tryin' to bring them back to me 
 When you the same person that made him platinum 
 Plus (You) only nigga did that where he rest 
 Schoolcraft Ave put a hole in ya chest (Yes) 
 Nope I'm not Drake of course I'm not Weezy I'm riding to K-Deezy 
 So why when I see where the cheese be 
 You don't receive me BME that's Obeezy (BME) 
 Don't it get it twisted like you 
 Internet niggas do Shady that's my birth we'll always be crew (always) 
 If we gotta take it back to Ja Rule 
 Back to Benzin Hoe 
 We gone do what it do (4sho) 
 Bullet in my head loose screw still 
 My motor skills had to get another boost real 
 I'm living proof that a death certificate's not a definite 
 Unless you the nigga got my roof peeled 
 Watch his head play peek a boo 
 Through the scope on the pica-tinny rail ...Richard Harrow 
 Expires ya no face 
 This a Broadway Empire ... BME Believe you me I wanna crossover 
 The aroma of the hood take a hold of a soldier 
 Then it take toll and turn to a odor 
 When you can't get it off ya 
 The labels they don't want cha 
 But this ain't Degrassi this is where the grass be 
 Forty four eight in weight and that's his last 
 Where mama titty rotten and she wear a mask 
 Just to be in public or around the people she lovin' 
 They say I'm buggin when I'm buzzin 
 I ain't recovered but big ups to my brotheren (Em!) 
 Still keep it in the cupboard bring that shit out 
 Need somethin' I need to go bottoms upward 
 Bottoms upward ... bottoms upward ... bottoms upward ... bottoms upward 
 Nospeakerz 
 Yeah I do beats do streets ... BME 
 Y'all act like I'm the only nigga that heard (young Guru) Guru speak 
 Let's get this money 
 Trice
