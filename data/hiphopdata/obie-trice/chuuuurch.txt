Semi on the couch, 3 bullets up in the cartridge 
 Four runnin' the house hopefully God can vouch for us 
 We outlaws 
 Dropped out of school so momma trusting the lord with some Ralph on 
 Identity crisis when the Trice's divorced 
 So the enemy's trifling like my pop, no remorse 
 I outsource 
 Get the illest nigga on the block who will bust off a shot for him 
 Find a little spot, some hood home 
 Eighteen now, niggas getting they thug on 
 Gotta get this paper niggas getting they drug on 
 Haters see us caking know they gettin' they mug on 
 Homie losing focus, he don't wanna traffic 
 He pullin' pistols out on nigga's up in traffic 
 Jumpin' in they classic, s fucking with the maggots 
 Got us looking hot, you know that end up being tragic 
 Tell a boy stop, I ain't got the audacity 
 I just wanna cop, he furious passing me 
 Know the streets watch but him nigga's is tagging me 
 Say you see O? That's where the car jacker be 
 Know I keep the mac on me 
 Living out here carelessly 
 Ended up burying I'm listening to the pastor preach 
 Now I face his old earth askin' what it's worth 
 My sons in the dirt, my nigga got me in the church 
 Thinking I'll fuck around catch 5 
 I'm up here in the church 
 Reading Psalm 4 through 5 
 Homie got me in the church 
 Look in the box he ain't alive 
 He got me in the church 
 I'm in the church

 Mommy outta high school, voided her college scholarship 
 She want higher knowledge afford, that mean she gotta strip 
 Round this bitch, taintin' her little purity 
 All she banking on is Cartier's and some jewelry 
 Winning at the poles, hoes, see her body tough 
 No ass shots, mommy just get Pilates up 
 Why they wanna body her, just for tryna make a buck 
 The Devil done embodied her, now she don't give a fuck 
 Ain't about college now it's about a dollar 
 She turnt up, hottest in the city, most popular 
 Ballers want a shot at her, fly her out do shots with her 
 Non-stop shopping for the number one ass dropper 
 But the Devil got binoculars, homie got a wife he's stalking her through metropolis 
 Tryna get the drop on her but, she ain't contacted Joy from Cheaters 
 She paid boys with them heaters 
 Put her fucking cleavage beneath us 
 Make her family grieve know the streets is devious 
 Birth name Eve, better known for her apple 
 Them nigga's blew tree then filled her up with ammo 
 Turned her in the trunk she was missing for weeks 
 Made her an example for nigga's to cheat 
 Shorty was my peeps man may she rest in piece fam 
 Obituary in here, let's take a seat 
 She got me in the Church 
 Thinking I'll fuck around catch 5 
 I'm up here in the church 
 Reading Psalm 4 through 5 
 She got me in the church 
 Look in the box she ain't alive 
 She got me in the church 
 I'm in the church

 We ain't in the queue less there's a body to view 
 Old folks say niggas irresponsible 
 If he ain't at the alter meeting our father 
 Most niggas say why bother 
 Unless it's life altering, then we need Bishop to visit 
 Show us an see something different 
 Lost so many friends it's religious 
 They in a penitentiary that's 72 inches beneath 
 Believe in the creator but Sunday's we gettin' paper 
 Funny how money come up before nigga's save ya 
 Some don't come up, sending out prayers 
 Ain't trying to preach just speaking on our behavior 
 We ain't in the church less somebody close hurt 
 Spirit leave the earth put his shell in the dirt 
 Shells scattered all over the turf 
 First 48 investigation's a blur 
 How that look as a murderer up in the church 
 Sitting next to the nigga mother I done murked 
 Demons get to working, palms get to sweating and 
 Heaven's looking far fetched fuck what the reverend say 
 Me I'm just praying man that I keep a steady hand 
 When them Devil's is ready to start spraying 
 Take me off the lamb, RIP my brand 
 So my fans and family can see me land 
 Right up in the church 
 Thinking I'll fuck around catch 5 
 I'm up here in the church 
 They reading Psalm 1 through 5 
 Nigga got me in the church 
 Look in the box I ain't alive 
 I'm up here in the church 
 I'm in the church
