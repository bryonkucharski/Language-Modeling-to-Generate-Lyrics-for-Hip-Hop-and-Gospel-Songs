(Obie Trice) 
 Obie Trice: Real name, no gimmicks 
 Rap; I been in it ever since I was invented 
 That's cause a nigger live it 
 My records wield digits in history 
 Niggers, you be the witness 
 I got the white boys mad at me 
 Cause Em signed another black boy 
 Like he nigger happy 
 Caucasians, Marshall knows talent 
 Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired 
 I hit ya raves, balloons and E's 
 And bang all your European Pamela Lee's 
 Fuckin' aye, or how we say it round my way 
 'Fo sho', Trice gon blow, then I'm off to them shows 
 I'm off across the globe, until my accounts all swoll 
 For young Kobe - big things, act like ya know me 
 Not a soul can hold me, I'm here 
 [Eminem] That's why I ain't got no 
 [Obie] Rap Name 
 The name's ('Obie Trice') 
 ('They see me on the streets 
 They be like 'Yo, he nice!') 
 So I came to the game 
 ('Real name, no gimmicks') 
 Rap a livin'...

 It didn't take much - one hot single (BAM!) 
 Smiles and handshakes, my man 
 The industry greeted me with open arms 
 With no type of flak cause O. Trice got that 
 Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat? 
 New wave of mu-zack that you're all lovin' 
 Got your broads on my balls, huggin' 
 Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?) 
 Please believe it 
 I'm as 'Down to Earth' as Chris Rock 
 Gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat 
 A big cannon in ya G-spot 
 Me, not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot 
 Whether or not you believe my status 
 I'm prepared to be the baddest 
 On the rap that's happenin' 
 Put the Mitten back on the map 
 With Mathers and win this

 (Obie Trice) 
 Well, I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun 
 Beef? (*cocked and two shots*) best-a run 
 'Cause when I pop, people's flesh get numb 
 And whoa... Ya might not make it till ya young 
 The only one with okay's, wanna blaze 
 Meet my little friends on racks in my den 
 Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins 
 And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film 
 Deserted, that's word to vacant homes 
 2002 Trice up in ya headphones 
 [Eminem] If it's ya system 
 [Obie] Trice up in ya bows 
 [Eminem] If it's ya women 
 [Obie] Then Trice up in ya hoes! 
 I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin' 
 With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me 
 I handle it like Rocky, Jake Sneed 
 Rakim, Eric B. - O's a G!

 {*Scratching*} 
 'Rap Name' ... 'Rap Name'... 
 'Rap Name'... 'Rap Name'...

 [Eminem] You-you-you can get stomped by Obie...
