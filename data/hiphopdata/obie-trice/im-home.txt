(Estelle) 
 I know the world wanna see me humble 
 They want to see me broken down 
 No matter how they try, they try 
 I'm staying up way high, way high 
 Way up in the sky 
 'Cause that's my home 
 (Obie Trice) 
 They say he wouldn't make it 
 But that ain't old make-up 
 Came from servin' fiends flavors 
 Until I got [?] 
 Belly all full, nigga ate up 
 Not just the cheddar I pulled but the haters 
 Wanna see the raw flesh in the grave, it's dangerous 
 And I ain't Singapore, I'm a singer bitch 
 Singular, nina on the hip 
 Sittin' in the hood home, dreamin' while I flip 
 I could be anything, include being rich 
 Take 'em out the ghetto, move 'em to the sticks 
 Put 'em in the [?], let 'em know 
 O represented to the fullest 
 Even if it's foolish or even if jewellery [?] 
 [?] boy came up from the sewage, bitch 
 (Estelle) 
 I know the world wanna see me humble 
 They want to see me broken down, but 
 No matter how they try, they try 
 I'm staying up way high, way high 
 Way up in the sky 
 'Cause that's my home 
 (Obie Trice) 
 Cold nights 
 Trice on the corner, rollin' white 
 Police wanna put me 
 In a holding cell after reading rights 
 They don't know what I received in life 
 My reason for me to push inebriatin' vice to fiends, it's like 
 By any means make it easier right? 
 When we come from dangling from trees at night 
 Yeah, now it's Ibiza 
 Stamps on the visa because I'm an emcee 
 Something a beat does to Obie 
 I'm from the street [?], you should know me 
 The boy raised by the OG's, sippin' old E 
 Now he sold out shows overseas so effortlessly 
 Eleanor we did it so elegantly 
 Know you're smiling from heaven on me 
 (Estelle) 
 I know the world wanna see me humble 
 They want to see me broken down, but 
 No matter how they try, they try 
 I'm staying up way high, way high 
 Way up in the sky 
 'Cause that's my home 
 (Obie Trice) 
 I'm home but I was starving 
 I sold yayo now [?] 
 I used to sling narcotics 
 Narks used to see me as a target 
 Now I'm in Bucharest, Budapest 
 We the arch of the triumph 
 Obie Trice not retirin', right now I'm hirin' 
 Long as your mind's inspirin' 
 (Estelle) 
 I know the world wanna see me humble 
 They want to see me broken down, but 
 No matter how they try, they try 
 I'm staying up way high, way high 
 Way up in the sky 
 'Cause that's my home 
 I know the world wanna see me humble 
 They want to see me broken down, but 
 No matter how they try, they try 
 I'm staying up way high, way high 
 Way up in the sky 
 'Cause that's my home 
 (Obie Trice) 
 I'm up in the air baby. You niggas just do whatever you wanna do or say whatever you say about a nigga like me. I'm up in the sky. Yeah
