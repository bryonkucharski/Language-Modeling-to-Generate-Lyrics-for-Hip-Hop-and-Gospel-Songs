(P8tience) 
 Keep me in your prayers 'cause I've been drinking Stolis 
 Riding in a stoley, plotting on a kony 
 Stomach rumbling, stomach touching, I need to eat 
 I mean trouble, I'm seeing double, I need to sleep 
 Living amongst wolves, I'm riding with all demons 
 I'm just trying to find the way in, no Keenan 
 If I'm getting armed up, you're catching it palms up 
 Chrome squeezing's an orgy, niggas is all fucked 
 (Obie Trice) 
 I'm from the gutter, I'm well aware of suffering 
 Two brothers, one ratchet, stuck hustling 
 No love for them, the fuzz, they want to cuff 'em 
 Got to feed my loved ones, nigga, fuck 'em 
 Clutching the sandwich bag, that's where the candy at 
 Addicts rolling in wheelchairs, I serve 'em handy cats 
 Thought that's where my answer's at, heartless and the [?] 
 Chasing baller dreams till my carcass in that casket *blat* 
 Die before I open my eye 
 Nigga holding the pie, holding the soldier's pride 
 'Cause niggas just living ain't being alive 
 If you ain't feeling what I'm spitting then you're living a lie 
 Patience, transition, it takes discipline 
 Decisions, only shit quakes nigga's position 
 One day, you're in the kitchen, the next, your flow's sickening 
 I'm a eye witness, my nigga, is you listening? 
 (P8tience) 
 See I was broke, no fashion, gloves on the ratchet 
 When you was saying "cheers", O, I ain't had a glass to 
 Camera shy, the cannons we buy don't have flashes 
 The next nigga out the hood trying to get to Mathis 
 Obie, give me that chance, I'll kill for it 
 Feed the kids, put my face on the billboard 
 And I know you're still trying to get a feel for it 
 But these other niggas, they ain't got the zeal for it 
 (Obie Trice) 
 Sometimes, you're too real for it 
 I know your frustration, I've been casing that for ages 
 Seems all the fake niggas taking their vacations 
 While we're pushing freebase, facing incarceration 
 We ain't floss hating, let the boys get paper 
 Be patient, yours is in the making 
 Loyalty never forsaken, lay and get your cake up 
 Prior breakup never turn Trice traitor 
 I cry 'bout what life give ya, that's your make up 
 Maybelline cover up your nature, cup up 
 By any means seem is our equation, fuck's up 
 Is being mean until we hit it major, nut up 
 (P8tience) 
 Niggas see Pai, pay, it's mayday, AK 
 SK, HK, put it in their face day 
 Drop 'em in the crate day, leave 'em by the lake day 
 Point me to your writers, I'm turning this Al-Qaeda 
 Nine stamps on the passport 'cause I'm balling 
 Niggas calling me a bad sport 
 I got the answer for niggas who [?] making beef 
 And I'm turning this to mad cow season 
 (Obie Trice)
