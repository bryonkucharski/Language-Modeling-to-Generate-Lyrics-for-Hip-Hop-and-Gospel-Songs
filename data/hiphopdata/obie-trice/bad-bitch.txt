(Strached "Obie") 
 (Chorus - Timbaland) 
 He got a bad bitch, said she recognize a "G" 
 Said she want to roll and get to know Obie 
 Claming that she love everything that he do, heeeey 
 He got a bad bitch, said she recognize a "G" 
 Said she want to roll, and get to know Obie 
 Claming that she love, everything that he do, hey, hey 
 (Verse 1 - Obie Trice) 
 Yes it's O. Trice, I done jumped outta heights 
 Writing to the microphone life, yeah this is right 
 This is less stringuest niggaz, this is tight 
 This is more dividends niggaz, get it right 
 Stomping like Timberlands niggaz, a pair of Nikes 
 But this is more Timbaland nigga and Obie Trice 
 The combination is invading stations, air waves 
 And rest haven on your listeners membranes (woo!) 
 I done paid some change, I got Timbo 
 This is not a brainy thang, yo this is simple 
 Get your ass up and dance, to the tempo 
 Exchange your stiff frame, with that of a more limbo 
 Grab shorty sippin' on that Shirley Temple 
 With that ass hanging out, and pinch her on that pimple 
 On her ass hanging out, nigga advance 
 This a world of a night, better start with the pants 
 (Verse 2 - Obie Trice) 
 Yeah, let's keep this shit in motion (motion) 
 'Cause we gon hang out till we hung over then I.V. Profin 
 Adios when (os when) 
 I fucked them thighs, who influenced with the game that was spoken 
 I'ma make sure she open (open) 
 Ménage-a-trois in these's days and times got my shit growing 
 And she's hoein' (hoein') 
 And I'm ignoring' the lies she throwing', how she won't perform? 
 I feed her a blunt throw on the "Quiet Storm" 
 She repeatedly cum, insistently all morn' 
 And she needed cause funs up in the purse not growin' 
 Bitch beat it my one's you gets none (nada) 
 To feel she's treated as if a Playboy or lpay her dumb 
 I skeeted so bitch your Playboy is on the run 
 Deleted the bitch, outta direct connection 
 Thanks for calming' down, my erection, hun 
 (Verse 3 - Obie Trice) 
 Yeah, I speak the words of experience (oh) lady I'm serious 
 Lyrics on my deliverance, is oh so vivid bitch 
 Oh no hoes up, hoes I spit it bitch (spit it) 
 Roll up, smoke up dro, and spit on this (spit it) 
 I'ma outta order 'cause I break the ice 
 And squirt liquid in your eyes, all you see is little guys 
 Swimming in women they claming they like my style 
 Treat 'em like Ike and ride (bitch!) 
 I don't a fuck I got the height, sure your right 
 I'm Barry White tonight (hey) you feeling' all right 
 Got a buzz and this huzzie saying O's her type 
 I take her to the high-end and strike (ah) 
 Trick for hire, I'll never buy her to bite 
 Despite she tight, I'll tell the bitch you can have a nice life 
 See I'm working with these I's in this rhymes 
 It's I's, all's that not a aus-tin time
