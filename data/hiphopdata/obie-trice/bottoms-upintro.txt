I'd like to thank you all for purchasing the new Obie Trice album 
 It's well appreciated 
 I'd like to thank you all for copping my classic Cheers 
 The Seconds Round's On Me 
 It's well appreciated, no doubt 
 Detroit city stand up 
 They say when a nigga for testing 
 They say that he stay kept with his Smith & Wesson 
 Story tells us his accomplishment's a blessing 
 Now that's what the fuck I call an urban legend 
 When a verse kept him from serving corrections 
 Turf he slept in had notorious conditions 
 All of symptoms that ought to send me to prison 
 Yet he had a vision 
 And since then, I've witnessed those visions 
 An eye witness 
 To put sense into it, you ain't listening 
 Get it? I hate to keep twisting 'em 
 My mind ventures, I spit with conviction 
 Nothing fabricated or based of forcism 
 Simply kicking what's living in O Trice's system 
 Come on 
 I wanna thank Shady records for backing me up 
 For all those years 
 Nigga, Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Riggs Morales 
 I wanna thank all my label mates, D12, 50 Cent, G-Unit 
 Stat Quo, Bobby Creek' and Cashis 
 It's been one hell of a run 
 Album number truces, found him in a booth nostalging 
 With Dre pounding the beat machine 
 O Trice say nothing, deleting them 
 'Scope couldn't destroy my evening 
 We are the elite, machine 
 Niggas is ass backwards, thinking they in the class, as if 
 And have access to these type of masses 
 When I seen this, massive 
 From a black teen with dreams of being this rapper 
 What happened is that he slipped between the cracks 
 Brought to your ears all the years that I've captured 
 Re-appeared after Cheers, the classic 
 Second Round's On Me showed you O mastered it 
 'Cause Obie not an actor in this shit 
 Actually, it's action show you know different 
 I'm ah be a victim on the set that I lived in 
 'Til I die, it's Obie Tri' 
 Try to understand this psychological spare 
 From serving them grams to inserving them fans 
 That's right, Obie hurting them, man
