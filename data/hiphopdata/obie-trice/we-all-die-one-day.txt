(Tony Yayo: "Yeah! 
 U rockin' with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo 
 Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins 
 Here we go!") 
 (Chorus: Lloyd Banks) 
 Niggas Know what I'm about out here 
 I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to 
 You can run your mouth I don't care 
 But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you 
 It's too real out here to be scared 
 A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to 
 A man is the last thing you should fear 
 It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you 
 We all die one day 
 (Tony Yayo: "Obie Trice") 
 (Obie Trice) 
 Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look 
 Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook 
 Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and 
 Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand 
 I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms 
 Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes 
 Everybody runnin' for their motherfucking lives 
 Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely 
 Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave 
 Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z 
 O's an animals skirts get mirked 
 Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt 
 Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard 
 Trust in God it 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar 
 I give a fuck where you from who you be with 
 Keep this a secret right by the nuts 
 A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck 
 (Tony Yayo: "Lloyd Banks") 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks 
 And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks 
 Poverty'll make your ass bet on words 
 Touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents' 
 They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun 
 If that's the case then get a bigga one 
 You don't think I pack the pump 'cause I'm out of the hood 
 That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump 
 I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done 
 Got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them 
 Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from 
 Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come 
 I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains 
 I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane 
 You should be easy on my name, 'cause I don't going back and forth 
 Your boss and your captain's soft 
 (Tony Yayo: "Yo Em spin that shit") 
 (Eminem) 
 We gonna bring it to anybody who want it 
 You want it? you gonna get it 
 Name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out 
 Too much venom and if you roll with 'em 
 We gonna fuck you up with 'em 
 I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose 
 My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM) 
 You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through 
 G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins 
 Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning 
 Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs 
 But we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch ass up 
 We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though 
 Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario 
 Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real 
 We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill 
 Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still 
 Shady records you better believe the hype is real 
 This is no joke, I don't smoke 
 But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin' P.O. choke 
 I'm an OG, you're fuckin' with a GI Joe 
 Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco 
 I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me 
 When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on people 
 At San Pedro ranch, huddled up next to her 
 With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs 
 You ever had your cat peeled back or your shit pushed in 
 I put my blade in you're like a fucking pin cushion 
 Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dog 
 I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog 
 Nobody told you that I'm loco S.A.? 
 I lack every sane chemical in my membrane 
 I'm slim sha-"D" and the "d" is for deez nuts 
 And you can get each one for free so feast up 
 I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come 
 (Tony Yayo: Here We Go) 
 (50 Cent) 
 We gonna bring it to anybody who want it 
 You want it? you gonna get it 
 Name em, we gon hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out 
 Too much venom and if you role with 'em 
 We gonna fuck you up with 'em 
 You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest 
 I got a 12 gauge Mossburg to pump up your chest 
 Have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest 
 Fear me like you fear god 'cause I bring death 
 Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle 
 I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down 
 I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy 
 And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die 
 If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to 
 So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new 
 You can raise your voice like you fin to touch something 
 When I raise my knife shit I'm fin to cut something 
 See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie 
 If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me 
 (Haha Sorry Kim haha... Oh sorry haha)
