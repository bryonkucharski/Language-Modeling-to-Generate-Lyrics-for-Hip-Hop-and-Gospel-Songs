I got this chick named Ari, all she do is want to party 
 Always want to meet up in public with a Barbie 
 Swear she's a Barbie, Nicki, she got it going 
 Ass fat, keep a straight wig on her dome 
 Never at home, hot ass, she hit the street nights 
 Paparazzi, earrings reflecting off the street lights 
 Never want to sit tight, she call a nigga midnight 
 To tell me after two, she's coming to get my dick right 
 Well baby, that's cool, but listen, I'm getting older 
 Nowadays, after 2, I'm sleeping, I'm rolling over 
 I call you about noon, you was tweaking, you wasn't sober 
 I can see you in your room hungover all on the sofa 
 Them days over for Obie, I'm on some next shit 
 Way it's looking like, I'm going so domestic 
 You ain't cooking nice or hooking up that breakfast 
 I'ma direct you to the exit, biatch 
 (Obie Trice (w/ Gwenation)) 
 (So long, so long) 
 I've been fucking y'all for years, time for Obie to duck up out of here 
 (So long, so long) 
 You enjoyed Obie's pleasing, but pardon me, good evening 
 (So long, so long) 
 Been a player like forever, I'm gone, it's time for O to move on 
 (So long, so long) 
 You done had a lot of fun, right? But pardon me, good night 
 (Gwenation (w/ Obie Trice)) 
 Time for me to move on 
 I'm telling the girls so long 
 (I'ma direct you to the exit, biatch) 
 I got this chick named Mona, always want me on the phone with her 
 When I'm on the road, she blowing up my horn at her 
 She don't like the homies, she always want me alone with her 
 Social skills ill, something had to be wrong with her 
 Lock me in the crib since she ain't fucking with wanderers 
 Niggas got to live, see that will never become of us 
 Want to be my rib, literally fuck my kids 
 Fuck a [?] sister, speak up, yo disappear 
 Baby listen here, your tack glisten full of wackness 
 You don't like kids, you need a psychiatric pamphlet 
 I don't give a shit how damp your snatch get 
 How loud your ass clap, you's a crazy ass bitch 
 Going through life ass backwards, your motto 
 Carrying all that baggage, bottle 
 Marrying me's not happening, bye dude 
 There's the door, yep, I mean to be rude

 I got this chick named Keisha, all she do is smoke reefer 
 When she say she love me, it's hard for me to believe her 
 'Cause when she say she love me, she's rolling up sativas 
 Smoker's choiced lips, bitch swears she's a diva 
 Yeah I grew up off the chronic, but she's so Wiz Khalifa 
 Keep a couple grams of OG in her sneaker 
 Dressed like the 90s, Dooney and Bourke purse 
 I try to coerce her to Louie, it never worked 
 So pitiful, forgetful 
 You on some hoopy shit when Obie is so in it, boo 
 I like to hit and quit, you claim that it's medicinal 
 I swear you be getting more licks than my dick do 
 I know you on the, ganja 
 Sometimes I'm wishing, bitch, that I was marijuana 
 You thinking relationship, I'm thinking more like nada 
 I won't be seeing you tomorrow, bitch 
 (So long, so long)

 We're supposed to be peers, but you never caught up, fuck out of here
