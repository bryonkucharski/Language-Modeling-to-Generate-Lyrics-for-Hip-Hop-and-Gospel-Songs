(Obie Trice) 
 Me, I ain't no rapper 
 Nigga, I'm a trapper 
 Eva since nigga was invented 
 Came out that snapper 
 Cocaine pin my stature 
 Bring it back, whip Kane Ackerin 
 Oh Lord, so hard, just like a statchet 
 Mathmatics, nigga, I'm stackin' 
 Whateva you crab, I'm matchin' 
 I'm soap certain bout my curses 
 Shit's comin' back to a mansion 
 At work call a nigga athen 
 I rap, still give a dabble 
 There's only curtains went over certain 
 I ain't dealin' with hustles 
 Bring that bread back to that castle 
 Lay it on the bed, that's what blacks do 
 Take a picture, me and my figures 
 Basket in my satchel 
 You rap, I'mma come back to put you beneath 
 Nigga no altitude 
 My attitude is absolute 
 Nigga like me comin' after you 
 This is for my drug dealers 
 Drug dealin', my real life drug dealers 
 Drug dealin', my Columbian drug dealers 
 Sarcoase to my Haitian drug dealers 
 Hovado loco to all my Mahecco drug dealers 
 Yella, to my Aerobic drug dealers 
 All my killas in the hood who be drug dealers 
 Makin' paper, reach the ceiling, my niggas 
 (Young Buck) 
 With my granddaddy got guncharches 
 His grandson got gramms though 
 Got grandma get a grand for every gramm that she transporting 
 My kids 'cause I got ammo 
 And I ain't talk about ammo 
 I am talking about shelves, hoe 
 These no more, when you sell dope 
 Projects with this pyrex 
 Got nine left with these hombres 
 He's jumpin' back, I'm bein' honest 
 I got all my young niggas on this 
 I don't believe in carin no gateway 
 I'm not takin' care of no grown man 
 Gotta jump in and get yo feet wet 
 Test to shoot you'r own hands 
 Dope-boy that got no plan 
 So I do shit you don't understand 
 I let my partner meet demand 
 They in it deep like quicksand 
 You still handling heorine 
 My uncle in and steppin on it 
 He got out the pimp 
 For lettin hes friend OD and left him on it 
 Dopeboy... 
 This is for my drug dealers 
 Drug dealin', my real life drug dealers 
 Drug dealin', my Columbian drug dealers 
 Sarcoase to my Haitian drug dealers 
 Hovado loco to all my Mahecco drug dealers 
 Yella, to my Aerobic drug dealers 
 All my killas in the hood who be drug dealers 
 Makin' paper, reach the ceiling, my niggas 
 (Tone Tone) 
 Money to the set 
 No rax that gub like a build 
 My dopes make cocaine like score 
 Count so good I could be a Tone 
 I can take you where the block at 
 I can show you where the love at 
 All this work that we get with-Yeah! - 
 - Where my scrubs at 
 The eastside where the drugs at 
 How we all trough the city with the pounds and the trunk 
 Trying get the work on 
 M'gotta murder ya nigga 
 Bought what you served y'all 
 And we ain't doing no dance 
 Booty make the work twerk 
 Rou-rou-round 3 4 5 6 times 
 Put 'em niggas to the dime 
 Flip a brick at a time 
 Put a loose at the lam 
 See the whoop in this man 
 Fell of it like (cadillac?) 
 Took a trip now I'm fine 
 Look, what you know about OT 
 (Crunnerbook?) you a hoetail 
 Just to make you a hoesell 
 Real g's taking no air 
 Wait till you dry when you got no aires 
 Feel niggas
