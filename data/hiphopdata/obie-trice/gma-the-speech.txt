You get more for your money 
 When you fuck with Mr. Porter 
 Yeah 
 Tweak my vocals just a lil bit 
 Yeah 
 Turn me up sound man just a lil bit 
 Good morning good evening, good evening good morning 
 When y'all was yawning, I was performing 
 When y'all was snoring, Obie was touring 
 Couple of [?] blowing my horn and 
 I just like forehead take 'em back home and 
 To the motherland, where nigga's belong in 
 All my belongings, my shit was stolen 
 Release my shit like a nigga parole it 
 Now he in the foreign hittin' them corners 
 Right on Ocean why he so boisterous 
 America made me this ain't even my culture 
 If fam weren't a slave nigga I'd be a [?] 
 Fuck Trice 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good morning good evening 
 Who they believe in, who they deceiving 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good evening good morning 
 As Kunta Kinte wasn't sensei roots 
 That's why modern cocaine is O's truth 
 Methamphetamine's make friends enemies 
 When we all tryna chase the same loot 
 Remember Bob had a noose 
 But as a kid rocks, pocket my triple fat goose 
 So who are you to point finger bout his demeanor 
 Even though you thinking his demons could be cleaner 
 Now we dream of Goodfellas not Mandela 
 We are the same colour his acts is so stellar 
 Drug peddler believin' in what they tellin' us 
 Hard young blacks on the map has no relevance 
 President's black that's evident 
 But crack bring precedence back dead presidents 
 Pocket's full of opposite what my melon gets 
 Elephant in the room y'all on some poaching shit 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good morning good evening 
 Who they believe in, who they deceiving 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good evening good morning 
 Landed on this bitch with Columbus, true 
 With no compass understanding O's roots 
 Reincarnated like Cordoza I snoop 
 Inspired by the essence of understanding my truth 
 Understanding why I brandish a weapon at you 
 When he resemble I, and we are only few 
 Why, animosity builds in to a fuel 
 When the Ruger is spilled and kills another dude 
 They just watch the tube 
 Screw us [?] like something in they food how they view us humans 
 Morning and evening, evening and morning 
 We all over the news like we part owning 
 We far gone because we not knowing 
 We so far from home [?] 
 [?] boarding up home we was raised in 
 Well fuck it Imma chase paper then 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good morning good evening 
 Who they believe in, who they deceiving 
 Good morning good evening 
 Good evening good morning
