WOO! 
 Damn ... 
 There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy 
 I'm about to get drunk 
 Let's hold down 
 Where the bar at? 
 (*Crashing noise*) 
 Okay, okie dokey Obie's here 
 No more focus, old pro's got a career 
 And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here 
 And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear 
 She erotic and it's hot, so a Heineken beer 
 Pull her to the side and invite here to "Cheers" 
 Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama 
 Prepared for a player? You're workin with a MONSTER (*yelling*) 
 I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place 
 Shut blinds and drapes, grind till your face in a grimy state 
 Concentrate, you will find that your bound to gape 
 But we found what's fate 
 We can watch two incredible mates masturbate 
 Why settle and wait 
 Let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight 
 Till your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin booty cheeks 
 C'mon 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 Okay holy moly derriere 
 Look around the club booty everywhere 
 She caught me starin' 
 And my homies darin me to approach Karen 
 She's model material, but she got a venereal 
 Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal 
 She holla 'cause I got a lot of dinerio 
 The DJ's playin' Obie song on the stereo 
 And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home 
 With the real thing not the dildo clone 
 And I know I don't wanna be headin home 
 With some double D's full of silicone 
 Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside 
 Found me outside, clowned me outside 
 Till I popped the trunk and they found me outside 
 Bustin' at the bitches screamin "off to they rides!" 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 Okay rolie polies everywhere (*horse naying noise*) 
 Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere 
 Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin 
 She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literal (*crunching noise*) 
 -Ly, like a box of Cheerios 
 Carrot cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls 
 I'm outta order 'cause I gotta big girl disorder 
 So better cover up that blubber or I'll split (*feet running away noise*) 
 And I ain't got time to play 
 Let's investigate another place to date 
 Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape 
 Dresses pettite, no window drapes 
 (Obie Trice - talking) 
 Word to mother, that god damn okra and beans 
 Got ya Oprah in jeans 
 Seems to me a little lean cuisine 
 Wouldn't hurt much, I don't touch 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 (Outro - talking) 
 Haha, haha, ha 
 You gotta have teeth baby 
 It just wouldn't look right 
 Look, me big lips ... 
 You no teeth, it wouldn't work 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 Haha ha, yeah 
 I'm feelin' good 
 Shady Records man 
 Obie Trice 
 C'mon
