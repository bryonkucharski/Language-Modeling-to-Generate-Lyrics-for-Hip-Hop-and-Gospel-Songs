What up 
 Jokes on us 
 Everything in the city ain't pretty 
 When you're looking at the curvy, thick 
 Trying to make a way to survive 
 Even though it ain't right 
 I'm trying to preach another ghetto hymn 
 A state that doers be 
 Hustling to come up all my life 
 Testify, it's just a Detroit state of mind 
 Detroit win'er, cold in December 
 Hustle on the corner, tether on the fibula 
 N_ wanna stick 'em up cause O's getting richerer 
 That ain't a word, but birds they speak literature 
 Literally hood house, semi in the couch 
 Figuring life out with this last half an ounce 
 We just trying to defeat the drought, make ends meet 
 Flous like a motherfucking bous 
 Slim Thugger Sig Deuce ninety 
 Drug smuggler, they ain't got love for us 
 Cuff us, throw us in jail for being hustlers 
 We on that knuckle so why would you fuck with us? 
 (?) 
 Y'all don't know Pacific 
 Just to be 'pecific, N_, came out of Michigan 
 No pot to piss in 
 Just a few rocks in this pocket for flippin' 
 Everything in the city ain't pretty 
 When you're looking at the curvy, thick 
 Trying to make a way to survive 
 Even though it ain't right 
 I'm trying to preach another ghetto hymn 
 A state that doers be 
 Hustling to come up all my life 
 Testify, it's just a Detroit state of mind 
 Turn this shit the fuck up 
 (J-Nutty) 
 I come up amongst the monster youngsters 
 Blazin' ass, wrong facing time 
 They'll blow out a N_ state of mind 
 Real talk, white lines 
 That's real chalk, night time we peel off 
 Through pipelines, we deal raw, real boss 
 Seen it all through my optical at spots 
 Aunties and uncles coppin the blow 
 In areas not many cops can go 
 If possible, I got a purpose 
 God put me here on purpose, or worse 
 (?) 
 Or am I worthless? I wish life was picture perfect 
 The feds taking pictures, snitches working 
 Them dealers lurking, through the traffic 
 Pushers pushing the package 
 Neighborhood full of addicts, graveyard full of caskets 
 They asking, time waits for a dboy 
 Where the street noise it's the real deep d voice 
 Evading the decoy, all shooters on deploy 
 Fuck the crime rate, my mind state is Detroit 
 Everything in the city ain't pretty 
 When you're looking at the curvy, thick 
 Trying to make a way to survive 
 Even though it ain't right 
 I'm trying to preach another ghetto hymn 
 A state that doers be 
 Hustling to come up all my life
