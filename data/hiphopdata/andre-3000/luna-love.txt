Love is in the air 
 Te quiero, mi quieres 
 Te adoro, I confess 
 I love you, do you love me? 
 I adore you, can't you see? 
 Darlin' to me you are fantastic 
 For you I will swim the entire Panama Canal 
 And you will be my girl 
 I will dance the flamenco with a flamingo 
 In the streets of Miami all night long 
 Until you hear my song 
 Yes, yes, I know, call me crazy 
 Call me insane, as long as you call me 
 My number is 
 Te quiero, mi quieres 
 Te adoro, I confess 
 I love you, do you love me? 
 I adore you, can't you see? 
 Te quiero, mi quieres 
 Te adoro, I confess 
 I love you, do you love me? 
 I adore you, can't you see?
