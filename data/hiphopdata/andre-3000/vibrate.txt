Every boy and girl, woman to man 
 When you feel you've done about the best you can 
 Muthafuck the wagon, come join the band 
 Vibrate, vibrate, higher! 
 Sometimes when it's late at night 
 And you have no one to talk to 
 Here's what you don', you go through that 
 Raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times 
 Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home 
 The Love Below start talkin' to ya 
 The circumcision has already begun 
 Desensitizing the very thing or thang that brought 
 You into this motherfucker in the first place 
 And when I say "motherfucker" I do mean "motherfucker" 
 Because Mother Earth is dying and we continue to fuck her to death 
 Play with your own score sheet, become the master of your own bation 
 And yes, God is watching you, but no need to be embarrassed 
 For the future is in your hands, no the future is in your hand 
 Play with your own score sheet
