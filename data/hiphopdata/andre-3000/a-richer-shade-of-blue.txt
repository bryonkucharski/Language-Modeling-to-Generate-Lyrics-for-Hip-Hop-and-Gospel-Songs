You see all these people out here on this street, Eddie 
 See they got blues 
 I'm talking 'bout they poor 
 They broke, they hungry, that's blues 
 Well, the blues can live in Buckhead too 
 I know it's just a richer shade of blue 
 But it's still blue, I can feel it, listen 
 He got everything he want 
 But everything he need money don't buy 
 Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen, oh 
 They look at you 
 All they see is dollar sign 
 Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen 
 A rich shade of blue 
 Okay, okay, you snappin', you snappin' 
 A rich shade of blue 
 Well, I'm just playing what I feel and it sure feels good 
 A rich shade of blue 
 I see I'ma have to bring you down to [Incomprehensible] more often 
 'Cause you goin' off 
 A rich shade of blue 
 Or we can take it to Buckhead and do it Peachtree style 
 A rich shade of blue 
 Everybody fall down sometime, yeah, just like that 
 Oh, but you gotta get back to the place where they know your face 
 And they don't mind if you cry sometimes 
 They listen 'cause they cry too 
 Ooh, that's [Incomprehensible] 
 A rich shade of blue 
 I guess it ain't where you from, it's where you at 
 A rich shade of blue 
 It's my birthday and I'm having the best worst time of my life 
 A rich shade of blue 
 Man, we stand out on this corner any longer 
 You gon' make me rich 
 A rich shade of blue
