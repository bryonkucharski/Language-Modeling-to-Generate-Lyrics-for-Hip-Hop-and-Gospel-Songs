La, la, la 
 L-l-life without m-m-music's 
 Like l-l-life without love 
 Man, if we had no music what would we dance to? 
 What would we sing to? 
 How would them babies learn their ABC's 
 Oh, no 
 No, 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars' 
 No, 'Old McDonald Had A Farm' 
 And birds would have nothing to sing 
 No, 'Take Me Out To The Ball Game' 
 Life without music 
 This is terrible 
 (No, no, no) 
 Uh, we wouldn't even whistle 
 (No, no, no) 
 And we wouldn't have a heartbeat 
 'Cause we wouldn't know what a beat was 
 Life without music 
 That's so lame 
 (Life without music) 
 Man, we wouldn't even have no ring tones 
 Shawty the phone wouldn't even ring 
 (Life without music) 
 Uh, it would just vibrate 
 At least nobody will be able to download your songs 
 (Life without) 
 She's got a point 
 We'll go have to do something 'bout this
