All right, Westley Funkaneers, today we go to war 
 I want you to man your instruments 
 Hello? Well, lady your instruments, whatever 
 You know what I'm talking about 
 Because we have a big, big problem on our hands 
 And I say before we let this blob take over our city 
 We funk him outta town 
 Y'all ready? 
 Blob, you goin' down 
 Hey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town 
 The Westley mob gon' make you frown 
 Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down 
 Nuclear waste, sloppy joe 
 Where it goes no one knows 
 Maybe underground where it's found 
 But it can't play here no more, sing, come on 
 Nuclear waste, sloppy joe 
 Where it goes no one knows 
 Maybe underground where it's found 
 But it can't play here no more 
 Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down 
 Hey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town 
 The Westley mob gon' make you frown 
 Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down 
 Well done soldiers, the battle is won 
 But the war continues 
 Thanks to every last one of you courageous Funkaneers 
 Atlanta can sleep tight tonight 
 Because you faced your problems head on 
 You didn't run away from 'em 
 And that's how true players do it 
 They get straight to it, at ease soldiers
