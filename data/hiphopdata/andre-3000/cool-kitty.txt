I'm so cool I could be an Eskimo 
 Even in the summer at my house it snows 
 Ooh, I'm always chillin' like it's forty below 
 I'm so hot, I'm cold, cool kitty 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Meet me at the corner of cool and ice 
 Where all the girls hang out, you know the spots 
 The cars are fast and the motors are loud 
 If I were you I would be in the crowd, cool kitty, cool kitty 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat 
 Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
