 Cah baby girl i see the way you move 
 Take you back to my room 
 So we can catch a little groove 
 You know dat i've been watchin' 
 You been singin' my tunes 
 And right now nothing stoppin' 
 Keep it poppin' me and you 
 And right now nothing stoppin' 
 Keep it poppin' me and you 
 And right now nothing stoppin' 
 Keep it poppin' me and you 
 And right now nothing stoppin' 
 Keep it poppin' me and you
