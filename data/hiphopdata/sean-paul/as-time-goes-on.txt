 Yow, yow 
 You who seh rule de people 
 Say don't it so deceiful 
 Yes, year to year it's clear to de youths 
 Dat yuh don't care 
 Top dollar all you wanna is thief it 
 Everybody know it ain't no secret 
 Ammunition and gun 
 Dat's all yuh really wanna share 
 I see di blood is on your hand 
 I see di youths don't understand 
 It's goin' nowhere 
 'Round and 'round in a circle 
 Politics tactics, nah, go work cauh 
 Too much blood gotta spill pon Earth 
 Man is dying everywhere 
 As time goes on 
 When will we live together? 
 Time goes on 
 And one seem so unclever 
 As time goes on 
 Will we ever get along? 
 When will we live as one 
 As time goes on? 
 When will we ever care? 
 Everybody got good and evil 
 Tek a look inna yourself people 
 Positive, negative 
 Which one will yuh manifest? 
 Everybody wah de same ting down deh 
 Nobody don't wanna live in a dismay 
 Everybody's fighting 
 To achieve their happiness 
 Some man wah rich and famous 
 Den dem get it switched and blame us 
 I wish dat those could see their emptiness 
 'Round and 'round in a circle 
 Selfishness just nah go work cauh 
 Too much blood gotta spill pon Earth 
 Man is dying everywhere 
 As time goes on 
 When will we live together? 
 Time goes on 
 And one seem so unclever 
 As time goes on 
 Will we ever get along? 
 When will we live as one 
 As time goes on? 
 And will we ever care? 
 Will we ever care?
