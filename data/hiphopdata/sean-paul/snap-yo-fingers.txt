 Drinkin' some rusty, dyin'-off Patron 
 VIP status, strapped wit' my chrome 
 Look around tha club, what do I see? 
 Everybody rockin' from side to side to tha beat

 Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk 
 Rollin' up tha kush, put it in tha air

 Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock, bitch! 
 Reppin' my block, bitch, straight from tha deck

 Smokin' on tha best; we don't fuck wit' dat mess 
 I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this

 One, two step, then you gotta lean back
