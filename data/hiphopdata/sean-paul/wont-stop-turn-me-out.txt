What you feel like? 
 What you feel like? 
 What you feel like? 
 What you feel like? 
 Love her back because she love me 
 Picture up in my cell phone 
 Call her up when I get lonely 
 Hope she keeping her cell on 
 This girl, she got something about her I can't deny, aye 
 This girl, if she tells me to I'll be standing by, aye 
 But, what you don't know is 
 Once we get started, it will go on and on 
 And it won't stop till I see her love come down 
 And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love 
 Nowhere to be found 
 And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound 
 Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out' 
 Oh no, we can't stop now 
 I'm about to feel her body 
 I'm about to feel her body 
 I'm about to feel her body 
 I'm about to feel her body 
 She'll be taking her clothes off 
 Once we get the gal right by me 
 Break her down till she doze off 
 This girl, should be up there with the stars in the sky, aye 
 This girl, she could send me on a permanent eye, aye 
 But what you don't know is 
 Once we get started it will go on and on 
 And it won't stop till I see her love come down 
 And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love 
 Nowhere to be found 
 And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound 
 Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out' 
 Oh no, we can't stop now 
 Can't stop now 
 You're about to turn me out 
 You're about to turn 
 Watch your feet love 
 Talked up on this 
 Stepped up on this 
 Keep it real properly 
 No it ever means 
 You and I in twine 
 And in ever bliss 
 You and I combined 
 She a reminisce 
 Tops up on this 
 Give all the reminisce 
 See all the lonely nights 
 We got candy strips 
 I'm the landlord 
 To the premises 
 I am the king 
 Make her know 
 What a empress is 
 Jeanie me give you sex wishes 
 Flex with me 
 For the lifetime membership 
 So send her kids 
 Make remember this 
 No matter day from my calendar is 
 But what you don't know is 
 Once we get started it will go on and on 
 And it won't stop till I see her love come down 
 And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love 
 Nowhere to be found 
 And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound 
 Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out' 
 Oh no, we can't stop now 
 Can't stop now 
 You're about to turn me out 
 You're, you're, you're about to turn
