Ugh 
 Wah 
 Ugh 
 Um 
 Yo 
 Shaggy 
 Ugh 
 Yo 
 This one goes out to all my women yeah know 
 My strong women, ugh 
 So amazing how this world was made 
 I wonder if GOD is a woman 
 The gift of life astounds me to this day 
 I give it up for the woman 
 She's the constant wind that fills my sail 
 Oh that woman 
 With her smile and her style, my 
 She'll protect like a child 
 That's a woman 
 She'll put a smile upon yah face 
 And take you to that (ah) higher place 
 So don't you under estimate 
 The strength of a woman 
 The strength of a woman 
 Woke up this morning 
 I got up with the scent of a woman 
 Jus picture if you would what life would be 
 Ain't much good without a woman 
 She can nag and be a constant pain 
 Oh that woman 
 But those hips she's got me whipped 
 And it's just to hard to resist 
 What a woman 
 Ugh, hey 
 She'll put a smile upon yah face 
 And take you to that (ah) higher place 
 So don't you under estimate 
 The strength of a woman 
 The strength of a woman 
 Tosses in 
 Ugh, ugh, ugh 
 Tender lips that's so so sweet 
 Gentle words she softly speaks 
 Such an angel when we need 
 GOD bless the ground beneath her feet 
 She can take you on a high 
 Be your comfort when you cry 
 But if you look into her eyes 
 You'll see the strength of a woman 
 Strength of a woman 
 Ugh, ugh, ugh 
 She'll put a smile upon yah face 
 And take you to that (ah) higher place 
 So don't you under estimate 
 The strength of a woman 
 The strength of a woman
