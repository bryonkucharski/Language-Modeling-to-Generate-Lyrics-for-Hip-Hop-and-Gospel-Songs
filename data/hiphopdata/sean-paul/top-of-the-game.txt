From the day we arrive on the planet 
 And blinking, step into the sun 
 There's more to see than can ever be seen 
 More to do than can ever be done 
 There's far too much to take in here 
 More to find than can ever be found 
 But the sun rolling high 
 Through the sapphire sky 
 Keeps great and small on the endless round 
 It's the Circle of Life 
 And it moves us all 
 Through despair and hope 
 Through faith and love 
 Till we find our place 
 On the path unwinding 
 In the Circle 
 The Circle of Life... 
 It's the Circle of Life 
 And it moves us all 
 Through despair and hope 
 Through faith and love 
 Till we find our place 
 On the path unwinding 
 In the Circle 
 The Circle of Life
