[Intro:] 
 Yow yow yow yow! 
 Some bwoy don't never learn 
 Never learn 
 Skin a burn... skin a burn! 
 Yow yow! 
 Wah me tell dem 
 [Verse 1:] 
 Some bwoy don't never learn... 
 Tell dem put dung di gun cah nuff man skin a burn 
 But dem still pick it up back, like dem don't give a fuck, dem nah tek nuh chat 
 Nuff a dem don't concern 
 Fi nuh like none at all, dem a hustle hard, money got de herb 
 Like dem tick a wrong turn 
 Talk, wi a talk all de truth an bun dem out 
 Some gyal nah live life right 
 Fleet an' fly off tek new man, every nite 
 An a suh gyal fi live dem lives 
 Cah nuh man nah guh wuk an' tek dem as wife 
 Some a move like parasites 
 An' a dem mouth dem out everyting unda my sight 
 Dis world fi open his eyes... 
 [Chorus:] 
 We only got one life 
 Believe it-live it, careful how you lead it-lead it 
 Writings on de wall an wanna know if you can read it-read it 
 Life... believe it-live it, careful how you lead it-lead it 
 Writings on de wall an wanna know if you can read it read it 
 [Verse 2:] 
 Politician an' pastah... 
 Some a dem good fi lead, some a cause a disastah 
 Dat's why we nah lissen dem speech 
 Cah none a dem practicin' what dem preach 
 Like money a di mastah 
 If a dat dem a praise den dem nah guh last yah 
 We hear de everlasta 
 Talk wi a talk 'bout de truth an bun dem out 
 All a hoe[?] ex-dawtah[?] 
 An' a cause bare pain pon Jah sons an daughta 
 Dat turn mi eye watah 
 Fi see de piepl dem a live up in a bare blood boatyah[?] 
 Man fi change dem pathyah 
 Stop lead all di innocent lamb to di slaughta 
 Earthquake gwain startyah... 
 [Chorus] 
 [Verse 3:] 
 Dis world on pollution 
 It a kill off de yutes, an a cause confusion 
 Climate an di atmosphere, global warrin an dem don't care 
 Nuff a live inna illusion 
 Every bam weh yuh drop man a hurt batta bruise an 
 Dere aint nuh solution 
 Nuh job, nuh money, nuh food is diffusion 
 Dere ain't nuh excuse man 
 Cah di so called bigga headz a gwaan like a lose man 
 An a sell out de yute man dem 
 Issue dem gun fi shoot up dem frien 
 From a life yuh a choose man 
 Dem try put yuh foot inna a neks man shoes an 
 Follow dis conclusion... 
 [Chorus] 
 [Outro:] 
 The world need to open his eyes... 
 The world need to open his eyes...
