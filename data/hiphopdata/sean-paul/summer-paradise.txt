Oh, oh 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Oh yeah 
 Back to summer paradise 
 My heart is sinking 
 As I'm lifting up 
 Above the clouds away from you 
 And I can't believe I'm leaving 
 Oh I don't know-know-know what I'm gonna do 
 But someday 
 I will find my way back 
 To where your name 
 Is written in the sand 
 'Cause I remember every sunset 
 I remember every word you said 
 We were never gonna say goodbye 
 Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta 
 Till we had to get back to 
 Back to summer paradise with you 
 And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Oh-oh 
 I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Oh-oh 
 (Tell 'em) 
 My soul is broken 
 Streets are frozen 
 I can't stop these feelings melting through 
 And I'd give away a thousand days, oh 
 Just to have another one with you 
 What'd you say 
 Well relax can wait 
 (Relax can wait) 
 I'm crushing my ways 
 (Uh-huh) 
 Playing in the sand 
 (Me and you) 
 Holding your hand 
 'Cause I remember every sunset 
 I remember every word you said 
 We were never gonna say goodbye 
 Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta 
 Till we had to get back to 
 Back to summer paradise with you 
 And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Oh-oh 
 I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Oh-oh 
 Yeah I remember summer mornings 
 And summer evenings 
 Now you're right next to me 
 And I am freezing 
 Was it real? 
 Oh baby tell me, was I dreaming? 
 How can you show me paradise, 
 When I'm leaving? 
 Now my heartbeat is sinking 
 Hope's shrinking 
 When I try to speak no words 
 Lip-syncing 
 Hope this is not just wishful thinking 
 Tell me that you care 
 And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Someday 
 I will find my way back 
 To where your name 
 Is written in the sand 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go 
 'Cause I remember every sunset 
 I remember every word you said 
 We were never gonna say goodbye 
 Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta 
 Till we had to get back to 
 Back to summer paradise with you 
 And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 I remember where we first kissed 
 How I didn't wanna leave your lips 
 And how I've never ever felt so high 
 La-ta-ta-ta-ta 
 Tell me how to get back to 
 Back to summer paradise with you 
 And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 Oh-oh 
 I'll be there in a heartbeat 
 (Summer paradise) 
 Oh-oh 
 I'll be there in a heartbeat
