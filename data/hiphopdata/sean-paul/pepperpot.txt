Are you with me, baby 
 I wannna know, I wanna know

 Try to tell you that I love you, babygirl 
 But it's all in vain 
 (In vain, in vain) 
 Try to tell you that I be there for you 
 When you call my name 
 (My name, my name) 
 If every little thing I try to do 
 It gon' cause you pain 
 (Pain, pain) 
 Then I might as well leave you girl 
 And don't come back again 
 'Cause you know I can't pretend 
 I tell you that I give you love straight to the end 
 Bad mind a cut we off

 Have you ever buck a woman and you feel so close?
