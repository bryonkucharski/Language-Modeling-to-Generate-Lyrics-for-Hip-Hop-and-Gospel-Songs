Hey yo we flip the script now the game done changed 
 Dutty cup music drive dem insane 
 Worldwide, yard ain't been the same 
 Jigzag zigular come bring the pain... 
 Hey yo Sean Paul... bad mind waan see you pop down and drop down 
 Step we a go step pon dem... tek onnu class... who a di real boss... ay! 
 Still blowin' up stage shows, all over the globe 
 Make mi tell you this god knows. 
 It no matta who wah chat mouth, chat bout seandapaul an di dutty a no real folks. 
 Cause wi still don't love those... 
 Back bitters and dem wolf inna sheep clothes. 
 Still no love none a them hoes, still I got a lot fine ladies at my dispose. 
 Nothin' more need to disclose. 
 SP a di dapper, bless with the best metaphors. 
 Them caan test all we ill flows. 
 That why all the fake ones dem getting' exposed. 
 I'm laughin' at these Johncrows,...When them encroach, mi shot them with a fresh dose. 
 Blow them up make them explode outta the cosmos, 'cause we a the utmost. 
 'Cause we be keeping it live. 
 And we don't be talking that jive. 
 Dutty blazin' it overdrive, we nah back slide. 
 'Cause we ever deh pon di campaign. 
 Non stop we riding this train. 
 Platinum plaques and all the fame... We change the game. 
 Dutty rock... got my back... rat-a-tat-tat-tat... 
 If a bwoy dis the fact we full them up a scatter shot... 
 Bullet weh we got a lot... We aimin' for your cataract... 
 We di gal dem follow here the flow and know a Dutty that... 
 Loogie Looge mi pon di track... Di gal them drop inna mi trap 
 Non stop stop... dem a get... from the kitty fox 
 Then dem woulda ask ...tell dem quickly dutty got the machinery 
 To chill nothin' nice than change up them scenery 
 Believe me... me no like when guy pre me 
 Especially when me under me greenery 
 Still I don't know what dem hoes be thinkin' 
 A we dem hear ?out... I wonder if them drinkin' 
 Me no care who dem linkin' or who a the kingpin 
 A Bwoy better boogie when the infrared blinkin' 
 We have them line up and the shot dem sinkin' 
 Make them decompose and stinkin'...suuuuuuu! 
 'Cause we be keeping it live. 
 And we don't be talking that jive. 
 Dutty blazin' it overdrive, we nah back slide. 
 'Cause we ever deh pon di campaign. 
 Non stop we riding this train. 
 Platinum plaques and all the fame... We change the game. 
 We nah pay dem no mind so make them bwoy chat 
 Not a point of return there's no lookin' back 
 With my eyes on me gold and me Henny to the top 
 And me got Sean Paul and a sell some plaque... 
 Dem no like that... So them come a huff up and a puff up 
 And a gwaan like say dem waan bruk up the big up 
 Dem no love we lifestyle but we still a live it up 
 Sean say fi represent... so... we rep it up 
 What a pity dutty run the city lock up a titty 
 Gal a shake them ass and keepin' it jiggy 
 Take it back to basic... Tupac and Biggie... 
 And a watch old school joints on Rap City 
 Kickin back and relax and a blaze a ziggy... 
 And the first draw she take she start move giggly 
 Me haffi wonder if da gal ya come from Tripoli 
 Make her know this Jamaican is too muckily 
 'Cause we be keeping it live. 
 And we don't be talking that jive. 
 Dutty blazin' it overdrive, we nah back slide. 
 'Cause we ever deh pon di campaign. 
 Non stop we riding this train. 
 Platinum plaques and all the fame... We change the game. 
 'Cause we be keeping it live. 
 And we don't be talking that jive. 
 Dutty blazin' it overdrive, we nah back slide. 
 'Cause we ever deh pon di campaign. 
 Non stop we riding this train. 
 Platinum plaques and all the fame... We change the game.
