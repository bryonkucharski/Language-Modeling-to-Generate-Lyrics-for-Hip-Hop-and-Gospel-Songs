Say when mi look up ina mi life its plain to see. 
 That it's never gonna be the same. 
 Take another step on towards my destiny. 
 But the memories still remain. 
 Deep ina mi brain inna mi soul I hold the key. 
 Said it's never gonna be the same. 
 Throughout all life and beyond all eternity. 
 I keep burnin up the flame. 
 Wish I could rewind all the hands of time and bring back 
 Daddigon a great bredrin of mine, I... 
 Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of, 
 All of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of.

 But those who pull the trigger cannot take away. 
 The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah. 
 So I know I'll see you again my brother.
