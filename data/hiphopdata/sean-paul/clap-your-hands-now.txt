 Woman, get busy, just shake that booty non-stop 
 When the beat drop, just keep swinging it 
 Get jiggy, get crunked up 
 Percolate anything you want to call it 
 Oscillate you hip and don't take pity 
 Me want fi see you get live 'pon the riddim when me ride 
 And me lyrics a provide electricity 
 Gyal nobody can't tell you nuttin' 
 Caw you done know your destiny

 If your stomach is flat, bend over 
 If you got a cute face, bend over 
 No stretch marks on your waist, bend over
