 It's on a base of steel 
 Them boys checkin' us out

 Strut in the club, it's dark 
 But still got my shades on

 To tha Whisper Song

 To make clubbin' a year-round holiday 
 So if you feelin' right, grab tha Kryptonite

 Step on the dance floor 
 Watch and learn 'cause here I go

 And work my body to the floor
