My main aim is to maintain. 
 Beyond 2005 stay alive jah jah we a fear. 
 Stay clear of the brain drain. 
 Because the system design wth a whole heap a fall and pit hole 
 And no just a little bit of gain. 
 Dem waan you walk thin lines. 
 Then dem say do it again. 
 My main aim is to stay sane. 
 'Cause I never did like an I never did love fame. 
 So listen me. 
 All who playerhate an keep on dissin mi. 
 Tell dem say dem cannot stop mi synergy, 
 Dem really cannot limit mi. 
 (No) Matter how dem mimic and a gimick mi. 
 Tell dem say dem cannot stop mi energy 
 I'm giving dem di Trinity. 
 Music so that dem caan refuse it. 
 5 million and forty top cuties. 
 Dem be shakin up dem booties. 
 Dat is how di dutty sell di units. 
 Nuffa dem get puzzled like a rubiks. 
 When dem hearin' all mi new hits. 
 Watch it make mi show dem how fi do this. 
 Cause this is how di dutty get mi true kicks. 
 We school them on di true hits. 
 Year after year dem caan dispute it. 
 Real dancehall dem caan dilute dis. 
 So listen me. 
 All who playerhate an keep on dissin mi. 
 Tell dem say dem cannot stop mi synergy, 
 Dem really cannot limit mi. 
 (No) Matter how dem mimic and a gimick mi. 
 Tell dem say dem cannot stop mi energy
