Mm oh yeah, what a night 
 Oh yes it's ladies night 
 And the feeling's right 
 Oh yes it's ladies night 
 Oh what a night (oh what a night) 
 Girls, y'all got one 
 A night that's special everywhere 
 From New York to Hollywood 
 It's ladies night and girl 
 The feeling's good 
 (Chorus:Repeat x2) 
 Romantic Lady, single baby 
 Mm sophisticated mama 
 Come on you disco lady yeah 
 Stay with me tonight, mama, yeah 
 If you hear any noise 
 It ain't the boys, it's ladies night, uh huh 
 Gonna step out ladies night 
 Steppin' out ladies night 
 Gonna step out ladies night 
 Steppin' out ladies night 
 On disco lights your name will be seen 
 You can fulfill all your dreams 
 Party here, party there, everywhere 
 This is your night, baby 
 You've got to be there 
 This is your night 
 Tonight, everything is gonna be all right (repeat) 
 Come on let's all celebrate (repeat) 
 Oh ladies night and the feeling's right 
 Come on let's all celebrate 
 Lovely lady, lady, I love you 
 Girls, y'all got one (what?) 
 A night that's special everywhere 
 You dance, you smile, the guys go wild 
 So chic so fine you all looks so divine
