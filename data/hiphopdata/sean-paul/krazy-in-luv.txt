 It's so crazy right now 
 Most incredibly, it's ya girl, B 
 It's ya boy, young 
 You ready? 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Yeah, history in the making 
 Part two--it's so crazy right now 
 I look and stare so deep in your eyes 
 I touch on you more and more every time 
 When you leave, I'm begging you not to go 
 Call your name two or three times in a row 
 Such a funny thing for me to try to explain 
 How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame 
 'Cause I know I don't understand 
 Just how your love can do what no one else can 
 Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's 
 Got me looking so crazy right now (in love) 
 Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch 
 Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch) 
 Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss 
 Got me hoping you'll save me right now 
 Looking so crazy in love's 
 Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no 
 When I talk to my friends so quietly 
 Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me 
 Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress 
 If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress 
 It's the way that you know what I thought I knew 
 It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you 
 But I still don't understand 
 Just how your love can do what no one else can 
 Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's 
 Got me looking so crazy right now (oh, crazy) 
 Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in love) 
 Got me looking so crazy right now (love) 
 Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey) 
 Got me hoping you'll save me right now 
 Looking so crazy in love's (hey) 
 Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love 
 I'm looking so crazy in love's 
 Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love 
 Check it, let's go 
 Young 'Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco 
 Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh, (oh) 
 Ol' G, big homey, the one and only 
 Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony--Soprano (oh no) 
 The ROC handle like Van Axel 
 I shake phonies, man; you can't get next to 
 The genuine article; I do not sing though 
 I sling though; if anything, I bling yo 
 A star like Ringo, roll like a green beret 
 Crazy bring ya whole set 
 Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged 
 They can't figure him out; they like, "hey, is he insane?" 
 Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth 
 My texture is the best fur, chinchilla 
 (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no) 
 I been iller than chain smokers 
 How you think I got the name Hova? 
 (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no) 
 I been realer; the game's over 
 (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no) 
 Fall back, young; ever since I made the change over 
 (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no) 
 To platinum the game's been wrap, one 
 Got me looking so crazy, my baby 
 I'm not myself; lately I'm foolish, I don't do this 
 I've been playing myself; baby, I don't care 
 'Cause your love's got the best of me 
 And, baby, you're making a fool of me 
 You got me sprung and I don't care who sees 
 'Cause, baby, you got me, you got me so crazy, baby 
 Hey
