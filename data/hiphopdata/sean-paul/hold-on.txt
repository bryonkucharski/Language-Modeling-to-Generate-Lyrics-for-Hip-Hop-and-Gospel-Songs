Hold on to the dream 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on and believe 
 That we're already one 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on to the dream 
 It is done, I'll see you there 
 I know you're well prepared 
 Put aside all your fears 
 Jah will answer all your prayers 
 My team that no one cares 
 Been working hard for years 
 Keep climbing up the stairs 
 Gotta know that you are ready there 
 Blood, sweat under tears now 
 None of them can take your shares now 
 Enemies better be aware now 
 Champions got a lot to bare now 
 I'ma tell you this I'ma swear now 
 I are the tiger I got the stair now 
 Carry on until we see the sun 
 We're holding on 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on and believe 
 That we're already one 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Although the road is long 
 We still hold on 
 We carry on 
 We still stay strong 
 Today is long 
 But tomorrow will come 
 Hold on, hold on now now 
 All the broke guys know 
 Be the strongest bit 
 All that you know 
 Is that the road is steep 
 Pain and trouble and try a long grief 
 But you must soak cause you must worry 
 Hard times will never get you beat 
 And you never will get defeat 
 From your old and strong concrete 
 Do the work, cause talk is cheap 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on and believe 
 That we're already one 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Although the road is long 
 We still hold on 
 We carry on 
 We still stay strong 
 Today is long 
 But tomorrow will come 
 Hold on, hold on now now 
 Oho, oho, oho, oho 
 Hold on 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on and believe 
 That we're already one 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 We still hold on 
 Hold on, hold on now, now 
 Hold on to the dream 
 Although the road is long 
 We still hold on 
 We carry on 
 We still stay strong 
 Today is long 
 But tomorrow will come 
 Hold on, hold on now now
