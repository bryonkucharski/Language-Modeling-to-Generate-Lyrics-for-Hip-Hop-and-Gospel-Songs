Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone 
 If something's going on, girl, you'd already know 
 We can't even say two words without a fight anymore 
 How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know 
 On the other side of love 
 You tell me you hate me and I hate you more 
 On the other side of love 
 How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know 
 Hey, baby girl

 Is a thing what you get with love 
 Trust and good live with it 
 So listen me and just believe I make stop from war 
 Like we are enemy 
 'Cause most definite 
 Without you in my life, my girl, it would be desperate 
 Come I can't forget all the times when you had my back 
 Girl, you get me medicine hundred percent 
 So I represent and you represent 
 I'm the president, you're my first lady 
 Girl, you heaven sent, I'm your first baby 
 I told you girl when you first met me 
 It's a crazy world. Nothing comes free 
 Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone 
 If something's going on, girl, you'd already know 
 We can't even say two words without a fight anymore

 On the other side of love 
 You tell me you hate me and I hate you more 
 On the other side of love 
 How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know 
 Girl, I remember when you first gave it up 
 And we began to first live it up 
 I steer it up, I gave it up 
 We came to love with no fear in up 
 But now you ain't seeing clear enough 
 Yeah, you look in my phone and tearing up 
 And tell me you want to swear enough 
 Me, I tell you what we share is us 
 I told you girl, when you first met me, 
 It's a crazy world. Nothing comes free 
 Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone 
 If something's going on, girl you'd already know 
 We can't even say two words without a fight anymore 
 How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know 
 On the other side of love 
 You tell me you hate me and I hate you more 
 On the other side of love
