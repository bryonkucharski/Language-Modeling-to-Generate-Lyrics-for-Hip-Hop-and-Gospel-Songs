 Rude boy what you want cause you push pon me waist 
 I know you falling in love from that look pon yo face 
 If I leave it there for you could you pick it up, pick it up 
 Got a hell of an appetite, let me know if you big enough 
 I'm talking high life, such a high price but we pay 
 Do this all night. Everything be all right, that's what we say 
 So original, super wicked style, we get wild 
 If it's right how we does it now, how you like me now? 
 Money talks, if you without it then don't mention my name 
 Ain't no competition within me and they make the same 
 Need a Benz or a better just to get in my line 
 Flyin private, we get at it till they see me on the plane 
 Talkin' fly right till we turn night into day 
 We could take time and never waste time 'cause I don't play 
 So original, super wicked style, super wicked 
 I can give it to you but tell me what you gon do, well tell me
