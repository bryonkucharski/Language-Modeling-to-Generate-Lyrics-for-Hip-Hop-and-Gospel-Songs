Yessir! (Ey girl) 
 I'mma hit the club, hit the weed 
 Hit the Gin then hit then drank 
 Poppin' bottle, buy the bar 
 Before I came through I had to hit the bank 
 Always toss a bitch or 2 
 You know, that's what trippy niggas do 
 30 goons in the V.I.P 
 Got you, pussy niggas spooked 
 Still hood, now I can buy the hood, my bitch bad, she fuck good 
 Mob around all through the town 
 I wish one of you hatin' niggas would 
 Life of a millionaire, on the way to be a billionaire 
 All I like is stripper poles and white hoes in their underwear 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin' 
 Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin' 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, (Entertainment) 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, (Entertainment) 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad 
 From the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment (2 Chainz!) 
 Bad man, live band, hair down my back nigga 
 Everything I do is dope, you would think I was a crack dealer 
 Big money, fast cars 
 Hoes all in my lap niggas 
 So far ahead the game 
 I might as well just lap niggas 
 Milk the game, lactose 
 She could see my chain from the back row 
 Came in with my niggas 
 Left out with some bad hoes 
 I got a black ho, a white ho 
 A Spanish ho and a Chinese 
 Yeah they call me 2 Chainz and 
 My first chain's a Siamese 
 That's your favorite part 
 Whatcha gonna do for it 
 Hey girl she on the Molly 
 Think she saw a unicorn (Damn!) 
 No horsin' around 
 Polo draws 
 She might say yes to me and no to y'all! 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin' 
 Here comes the bottles tell me what you're drankin' 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, (Entertainment) 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, (Entertainment) 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad 
 From the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 Ima hit the mix, with the chicks 
 Take my titts, I'm a hit the bitch 
 Hit the pole, hit the flips 
 Do it like Miguel, I hit the kicks 
 When I land, I hit the splits 
 Puffin on that trippy stick 
 Bitch I'm queen, 'Lizabeth 
 Bitch I'm bad, hissy fit 
 I'm a rip the skirt, hit the twerk 
 I don't give change nigga, hit the clerk 
 Drive niggas crazy, hit the skirt? 
 Ass on bounce, tits berserk 
 Life of a bad bitch 
 Nigga make my san'mich 
 Yes I been bustin' bands 
 All night, and I'm famished 
 He took the ass, we vanished 
 Pull up in the Aston Vanquish

 You bitches ain't fucking with me on my worst day 
 Fuck outta here 
 Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'

 Bubble on down and pet it, pet it 
 Holding out the air, then get it, get it
