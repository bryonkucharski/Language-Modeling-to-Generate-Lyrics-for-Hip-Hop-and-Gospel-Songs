 Kick up the bass up and make I bun up the 
 Place up... make I pick up the pace up and 
 Make them wine up the waist up 
 We them want fi erase up but we style them 
 Embrace up... but them can't stop the music 
 So great up weh we create up

 Straight up... man a no punk man a no fool...

 And the bass make it play... party non-stop 
 From a night till a day... and no matter weh
