Straight connection! 
 Girl 'em need a section 
 Sean paul sing fi di gyal, dem boy make dem know 
 Girl you go slow then again yo 
 When I ride 
 You ride 
 Baby girl until the end of time 
 Can't lose, nah lose 
 Girl 'cause we keepin' it so exciting 
 In my mind I get high 
 I hit the lights and start caressing them thighs 
 She's mine but she wanna me do is love with the lights on 
 She wants it with the lights on 
 She wants it with the lights on 
 That's what she say while I'm up in her throat 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Don't want it all 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Steady rockin' her though 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Why she singing that song? 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Gyal believe 
 No lie 
 And I'm lookin' at a woman so fine 
 'Cause she so fly 
 She make me feel just like I'm a child again 
 My ego, my pride won't let me leave without her tonight 
 And how she want me 
 Take her back up to the crib and turn the lights on 
 She wants it with the lights on 
 She wants it with the lights on 
 That's what she say while I'm up in her throat 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Don't want it all 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Steady rockin' her though 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Why she singing that song? 
 Uh-la-la-la 
 Red light stop 
 Green light go 
 Switch on the yellow light when you want it slow
