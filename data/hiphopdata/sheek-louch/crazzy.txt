Lyrics: 
 (Intro (talking)) 
 Imma make the hits 
 Y'all book the shows 
 Aiyyo 
 Bling bling, what's that? Sheek Louch is back 
 Ride ride, you got my back? where the heaters at? 
 12 gauge, tech nines, yo! where the hit 'em at? 
 D block, we got 'em going crazy, crazy 
 (Verse One) 
 Aiyyo, whos that looking through my window 
 Blaaaow, y'all muh'fuckas know my style 
 Any nigga looking and I'm daffy ducking his ass 
 Beat upside down, straight bucking his ass 
 Louie bat to his head, roll a truck in his ass 
 Old man style, bust a bottle, cut 'em wit glass 
 Yeah!, it can be who? Sheek the MC 
 Spit hard, the MC, in the yard, the MC 
 I eat dictionaries and spit out little pieces of paper 
 That's why my vocabulary sick 
 Use big words like, suck-my-dick 
 You don't wanna play Louch, wit out entering cheats 
 I'm like Eddie Kane nigga from the Five Heart Beats 
 Coke thicker than ya muh'fucking cream of wheats 
 Paper too small nowadays, I write on sheets 
 And I done made so many hits, I'm about to cop cleats 
 (Verse Two) 
 Without baking soda still keep the arm and hammer 
 D block flag waving on the rangest tanner 
 In our jungle, all gorillas keep a banana 
 Spraying dumb, yo heat is old as nana 
 Listen, if you wit us no time for bailing 
 Sheek Louch, D-block, stop Rose like jalen 
 No bull, nickel plate catch me pailing 
 Scoop big niggaz, put 'em through half the sailing 
 Yeah! I don't care if I sell or not 
 The boy is hot, that be wit a oven glove 
 Fuck mainstream, keep me wit gangstah love 
 Street shit, Sheek shit, bring life to tug 
 Ha ha, I'm like new, but I been here tho 
 Just low, I ain't drop and y'all wanting a show 
 Book it, let the hood in and let me rock 
 Bring the hardest niggaz from ya block, what up! 
 (Verse Three) 
 I got big signs, fuck dog, beware the owner 
 Step out, shopping boxes, Lemon Coronna 
 Scratching my ass, hoping that the kids tresspass 
 One of 'em vietnam niggaz, my stitch wit hair triggers 
 I'm hot like, bout to start breaking you up 
 I feel the earths a little baller niggaz shaking me up 
 I'm bout to dig inside ya pockets, start caking me up 
 I get coke before, I ever be outside wit a cup 
 And yo what, that's right, the god sick wit it 
 May be before, but right now the kid Louch forget it 
 I'm the best out right now, spread the news 
 I could write a book, Louch the new Langston Hughes 
 Yellow Play Boy nigga, stin Pepe Lepues 
 I don't just clap, Sheek'll make the 4 go off 
 Espionage and all that, like gombachev 
 Hit the block and make the o's go off, oow!
