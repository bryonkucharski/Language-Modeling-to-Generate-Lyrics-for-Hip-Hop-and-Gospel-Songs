Stay dip, cute bitch out in Delaware, moving our bricks 
 So hard, stupid big stones from Miss Stella ear 
 She just turn 35, we in the spot on Martin Luther King Drive 
 Whole team getting high, on phones 
 We learned different codes of pig Latin 
 So the jakes don't follow our trail with sick patterns 
 And the crib is jig, Jennifer convertible love seat 
 That's worth forty G's from Madrid 
 In Spain, sipping cherry Cosmo's and things 
 Stella, finish the glass, showing niggas her rings 
 I said bitch, I ain't impressed with that 
 Why the fuck is every briefcase short by at least ten stacks 
 We had a mil' in each bag, there's eighty grand missing 
 You pop up with a new Jag', with a bad system 
 I done sent your ass to Hawaii and Waikiki 
 When your man needed bail, you'll come see me 
 Rob me? That's how we do? You pretty slick muthafucka 
 You must think I'm a sucker 
 Matter fact, you gon' suck this dick, how bout that for a change 
 Let me see what's really on your brain 
 She said 'Starkey, you violating me, stop it' 
 I saved up for this shit, you playing me like a hostage 
 Out of all people, I wheeled you around, when you got shot 
 Be the closest one too you, and may I rot 
 In hell, yo Starks, chill, I don't think she that stupid 
 Since '90, '95, she came through, kid 
 Two million in six weeks, cover six space 
 Just to think of those towns alone, we brought a big steak 
 But it still don't change the job 
 Aiyo, Tone, who this silly bitch trynna rob 
 Niggas been getting money, since pushing a Saab 
 In the spot writing rhymes, never heard of a blog 
 Is it that coincidental? That the same rental 
 Be out in Virginia and DC, before she come see me 
 I'm ready, put this hammer in her face in 3D 
 I know that's your home girl, but fuck it, on GP 
 And I don't like her brother, either, he probably put her up to it 
 Give me the word and I go empty his fluid 
 Shady? I been bagging up since 1980 
 Me and Ghost been tight, since Fred met Grady, lady 
 So what you telling me? My account is off? 
 Oh you must really muthafucking think we that damn soft 
 Hold on, yo, Sheek, what you gon' do? Cut her whole hand off? 
 Put a pillow over her face, and let the four bang off? 
 Or we can get the gat taping so the hoe can't talk 
 Before we get the whole story cut this whole thing short 
 I don't think that's wise at all, whatever honey do with her money, dog 
 That's not my problem, why is it yours? 
 Wu-Block, you riding for mine, I'm riding for yours 
 That's the motto if you talking bout homicide, my lordyep 
 It's survival, homey, you ain't never lied, my lord 
 But the Pretty Toney baby ain't never lied before 
 That's a hundred lucci, word to Bully, I smoke too many loosies 
 I know her history, if something fishy, must be the coochie 
 It ain't no mystery, your finger itchy, if she a groupie 
 Once you go up, once you go down, let's keep it Gucci 
 You take her head, I take all the jewellery from all these moolies 
 Get all your goonies, and we can meet up for Call of Duty 
 Ain't nothing funny like Paul Mooney, this fatal beauty 
 Got some explaining to do, hold up, I thought you knew me 
 Better than that, we know the cheddar was tapped 
 You getting bread in the trap, why get in bed with them rats 
 My son is missing some racks, and Louch is fitting to snap 
 She need to come up with answers, instead of fixing her Mac 
 Makeup, just give the facts, straight up, and just the facts 
 If you did it, we gon' bury you with it, and that's that
