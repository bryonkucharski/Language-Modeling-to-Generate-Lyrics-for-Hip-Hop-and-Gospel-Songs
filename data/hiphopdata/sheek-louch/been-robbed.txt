"Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 Cocaine flow, cocaine dough 
 Where that money, where that paper, where that cocaine go? 
 Lay 'em down, face first, take the numbers out his cell 
 Get his connect to gag him, so the faggot don't yell 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 What happened to that street shit you rap about? 
 Where that spot that you sell heron, and dope and all that crack about 
 Niggas stop fronting, you don't own a glock 
 If I take it off your neck, you probably call the cop, it's like 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 Aiyo, I had to shove the fifth in his mouth 
 He tried to raise the price on me in the spring, in the midst of a drought 
 Told him papi, no need, just put the slabs in the bag 
 Then I told him shut the fuck up but his dog even said "arf! arf!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 '88 Riker's Isle, banging for phone time 
 One big nigga slid through, bulky with two shines 
 Winked at my goons, they leave quick, big man ran 
 To the bubble, leaking, repeating that help shit 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 We smack niggas up, shake 'em down as we see 'em 
 Take his jewellery and his podium 
 Sheek and Ghostface on our '88 shit, get your chest hit 
 Box cutter, get your face split, they yelling like! 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 Out of respect, I through the gun to his neck, he had singles and loose change 
 And yo, four bundles of wet 
 Told him, yo, kid, respect the juks, and there's one thing 
 You shouldn't yell around murderous crooks and that's 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!" 
 "Help! I'm being robbed!"
