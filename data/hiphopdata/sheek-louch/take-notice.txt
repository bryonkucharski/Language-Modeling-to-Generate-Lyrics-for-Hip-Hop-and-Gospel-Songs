You can catch me on G-Street, snowflake fur on 
 Cubaned out, neck looking all beastie 
 Don't pass me the blunt, I'm cooling, sixteen hundred grams 
 On his concrete land, it's moving 
 From here to La Cienaga, I do hood yoga 
 I pull muscles counting money, need a new shoulder 
 Bitches circle round me on the block, I'm bossed up 
 I ain't stabbing nothing less she got a horse butt 
 Fuck her on the side of the building, that's a 'walnut' 
 She pregnant, ten minutes ago, she had a small gut 
 One apostle, Cuban Link skit 
 Montana Medellin, blowing both nostrils 
 Stick up kids stay away, Shaolin is far from your Emerald City 
 Call it Ox Town, trust me, I give you fifty 
 V necks on a different level 
 Staple your collar bone, you don't want no bass treble 
 I feel murder in the air, yeah, where my soldiers 
 Where the hood at? Bring 'em out, need y'all to hold us 
 We go marching till the whole entire world take notice 
 Wu-Block, take notice, Wu-Block, take notice 
 I feel murder in the air, yeah, where my soldiers 
 Where the hood at? Bring 'em out, need y'all to hold us 
 We go marching till the whole entire world take notice 
 Wu-Block, take notice, Wu-Block, take notice 
 I'm dreaming, at the bar with Barack's wife 
 Nancy Reagan making shots for us, TMZ sent they source 
 Hillary said I frighten her 
 Alarm go off, choking off the teeth whitener 
 I'm Don-Don, Daily News, fitted be true blue 
 I don't gang bang, but my niggas be Su-Wu 
 It's only a few niggas in the game that I'm true to 
 She mad I won't fuck her, go wash that poo-poo 
 Yo, Starks, tell Vel to book more suits 
 Aiyo, Vel, tell L to call more treats 
 Snow bunnies, house wives of Orange County 
 We gun smoking bonanzas, with no bounty 
 See me? My chain lower than your GPA 
 See them shooters in that building? They hear to stay 
 Said you getting that for cheaper, well, what you pay? 
 Sometimes I feel like Naughty, Hip Hop Hooray 
 I feel murder in the air, yeah, where my soldiers 
 Where the hood at? Bring 'em out, need y'all to hold us 
 We go marching till the whole entire world take notice 
 Wu-Block, take notice, Wu-Block, take notice 
 I feel murder in the air, yeah, where my soldiers 
 Where the hood at? Bring 'em out, need y'all to hold us 
 We go marching till the whole entire world take notice 
 Wu-Block, take notice, Wu-Block, take notice
