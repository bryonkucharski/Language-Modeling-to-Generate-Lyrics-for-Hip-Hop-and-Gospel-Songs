We make the club jump every time we walk in this bitch 
 Yeah, we shining. You can tell my niggas is rich 
 Rozay and Patron at my throne, women at my feet 
 Staring like they want me to beat 
 This New York rap, I'm on the other side of the map 
 Nah nigga place rap with a bitch on my lap 
 Back to back on the FDR, big cigar 
 Explain You can tell there's a star in one of these cars 
 She's with Ghostface, yeah a bird on her wrist 
 Mask on face, *********************** 
 Everybody try but they can't do it like this 
 This Don Donna it starts I bet I won't miss 
 Hey yo 
 Pull them cars out 
 We gettin' money over here 
 Them bottles on the table 
 The weed in the air 
 Your woman starin' at us 
 Them haters ice grillin 
 Wu-Block, you know we in the buildi 
 Every little spot they know me 
 Loyal females who can't just give me the twat 
 They show me like I'm a big stock broker on Wall Street 
 I said, "Nah, I'm that big drug dealer from 4E!" 
 A lot of guacamole, know a lot of parolees 
 Slung in front of a lot of these delis eatin canoles 
 I stayed on the front line like private events in airports 
 And live by the code I'mma bust mine 
 Word, tunes, start shorty while I got a tongue in my ear 
 Don't get a stain on my Porsche 
 Light-skined said she a virgo 
 Said she love my roll game and my bird yo 
 A baby ghost appeared from the blunt smoke 
 It lingered through her hair and settled in her clothes 
 Her bag fell, I saw a 38 snub nose 
 I stole that and still fucked her when the club closed 
 Bust honey on your face, hundred stacks on the car 
 If I spend a rack today, get that rack back tomorr 
 I'm a cash ruler, rulers zig-zag along 
 Get my money off the hook like I'm Abdul-Jabar 
 Get my money off the book like Steve Paul 
 Then fall, act hard, but they livin' 
 They think like a man, but act like they women 
 I never trust a broad with that in God trust only trust in God 
 Look at me, I'm what these little haters wanna be 
 I'm your man, 50 grand and I keep it a hundred G 
 I'm that block on fire, it's like a hundred and three 
 Rappers come a dime a dozen but they don't come in tha peace 
 I only need a few raps when you comin' with cheese 
 And the people you come up with, they be comin' to me 
 We got the city under siege 
 Where the tightest ladies 
 Where the tightest under reach
