 Sheek Louch cummin' through wavin' the 4, 4 
 Night boots, black hudie, tell me who want war 
 Coke on the glass table, some rock vodka 
 Dutchie rolled, soaked 'n' quevlow gold 
 Ma swag is up, ma bars in tight 
 The house, the bitches, the jewelry, the cars is right 
 The hammer light, titanium 
 I'll put 3 in ya cranium 
 Like pop, pop, pop 
 Cannot stop 
 Now bring it back 
 It used to be 500 k in the closet 
 Now it's a couple M's every time I deposit 
 Tell the young boys it ain't really nothin', it's lojik 
 Stack whatever you get, don't spend, you got it 
 On top of that stay consistent with your product 
 Don't matter if it's just weed or if it's narcotic 
 Due time you'll be pullin' of the lot in something exotic

 Pam won't light, I'm going light it hotta 
 Then a slug from my 4 pound

 We can go to war now 
 L.O X muthafucka 
 Rich on a plane 
 Couple bucks 'n' ma trucka 
 Shoot from anywhere 
 Like niggas in the rukus 
 Gettin' stronga, barral longa 
 Coup shorter, jar of dat water 
 Malinium flow 
 Kamora times 2, malinium hoe 
 Tattooed up diamond cross 
 Hip hops Randy Moss 
 Dump the whole clip and toss 
 Hottest group 
 Let the beef loup 
 And we barry you niggas 
 In yo pocket like kiss and jiggas 
 Big money, big car 
 And big cagars

 Comas, frunaral 
 Wheelchairs paraplegics 
 Reel life so you gotta believe it 
 If you did have a goal 
 Then you gotta achieve it 
 'Cause your body stays hear 
 But your soul gotta leave it 
 Square feet, hot wheels 
 200 bricks 1 shot deals 
 'Cause every body down will pop pills 
 It's hard to top that 
 Point blank the goddest got crack 
 We U P S body parts back 
 I don't get the newest Benz 
 I get the newest house, newest business 
 I learned that from my Jewish friend 
 I brake bread with the Arabs 
 But I'm African 
 So I got doe chillen in the gray Calv 
 I could hit you with a hook 
 Or a straight jab 
 Or I could cock it back 
 'N' shoot you in ya face, hag 
 And you know I'm from Y O nigga 
 I got every kind of charger 
 Even the Y O nigga
