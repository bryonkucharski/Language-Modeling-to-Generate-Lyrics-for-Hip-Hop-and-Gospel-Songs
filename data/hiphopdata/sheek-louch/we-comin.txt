We comin' [15X] 
 Get up out my way - hey, get up out my way [4X] 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 New York, Down South, Bay Area 
 I roll on down and look around 
 A lot of muh'fuckers don't know me now 
 So I cock my pound, pull out my chain 
 Look for a bitch wanna give me brain 
 Let her know I'm really there to sell 'caine 
 If it's good I could be on that train 
 On that flight, by tonight 
 Long as the dope boy price is right 
 Get up out my way 
 Last time, next time I'll spray 
 Pop that trunk, Sheek and UNK 
 Tell Montay yo let that bump 
 I ain't no chump, move over dawg 
 Clear my space out when I walk 
 Elbows thrown, yeah I'm grown 
 I ain't no king of no microphone 
 I'm the king of my house, king of my son 
 Feel like a king when I'm holdin' a gun 
 Ain't no killer but I'll vouch you two run 
 Five up in you boy ain't no fun 
 'Fore they chalk it out 
 Got a little stressed I'll "Walk It Out" 
 'Fore your ass be dead lyin' on the floor, hot ass led 
 White t-shirt be straight up red (Yeah!) 
 (UNK) 
 Yo! [2X] 
 I ain't gon' lie, I done came out set the world on fire 
 To the top slot couple niggaz got retired 
 Some lost then some got downsized 
 Everybody know me, everybody know thee 
 Oomp Camp, introduce them to the O.C. 
 Ay, why a B wanna try me? 
 See, now you plugged to the IV 
 And, when I'm in N.Y.C. 
 Sheek Louch got the plug, I ride by thee 
 G code, when I'm on the road 
 Connected with the realest that keep the good smoke 
 That pack, nigga where you at? 
 I'm way up front why y'all haters in the back? 
 I'll tell you that, pop a few tracks 
 Spend a lil' money you'll get it right back 
 'Specially when UNK's on that track 
 It's Oomp Camp, D-Block, nigga pump it to the max 
 That's right, niggaz got it now 
 Cuttin', gunnin, nigga lay it down 
 Seven, runnin', niggaz in the ground 
 Money, mo' money, all on my round 
 Get it by the pound, shut the block down 
 Oomp Camp, D-Block, we run this town 
 We comin' 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 Geah, don't stop, get it get it 
 In the South with my Yankee fitted 
 In New York with my Down South rented 
 Hammer cocked but my windows tinted 
 You don't know me, from one of the three 
 (LOX) hottest groups in history 
 I'm Sheek, Louch, Jadakiss 
 And that's my homey, S.P. 
 Go [6X] go shorty 
 And leave that deadbeat home cause homey pushin 40 
 He just want a stay, yeah he don't wanna play 
 Nah, you know what you say? Get get get up out my way 
 I talk what I know, liquor drugs 
 Money guns and them thugs 
 Street life, I get it poppin' 
 Sheek ain't home I'm car shoppin' 
 24's, slip up doors 
 Candy paint on all them whores 
 Hold it down, whatever town 
 Play me close and you'll hear that sound 
 Pow! 
 We comin' [7X]
