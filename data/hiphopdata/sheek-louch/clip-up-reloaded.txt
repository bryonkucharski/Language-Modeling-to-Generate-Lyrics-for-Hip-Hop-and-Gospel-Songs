 Yeah, I clip up the nigger, Johnny 
 Can I get any higher, they say sheep's on fire 
 I feel like death jam, just sound starter mayer 
 I've been a g since I was chewin' on a pacifier 
 I keep that nick cannon with me, no Mariah 
 They say the hood is mine 
 It's like the nigger was born against the wind 
 She, Johhny Frankenstein

 And down bottom somewhere hot, but no breeze 
 And dinner with young millionaires 
 This is o keys, just sit back 
 Talk shit and blow trees 
 My outfit's un-wearable, my shoes don't fit you 
 My pain's unbearable

 Extra projects 
 Who punks that jails the street for 
 We sorry to say for our toons
