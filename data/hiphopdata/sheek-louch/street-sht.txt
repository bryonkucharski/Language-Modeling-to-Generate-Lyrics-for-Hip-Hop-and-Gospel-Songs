Among evil gods I sleep 
 Their ancient hymns were my dreams 
 But the vast and cold forest beckons 
 So I rose with the funeral moon 
 From my coffin of blackest slone 
 From the crypts which for aeons 
 Embraced me 
 Through the portals and into the 
 Frozen night 
 It's calling for me 
 In darkness reborn 
 Through the midnight spheres I dance 
 Spreading my wings 
 Caressing the black infernal night 
 "From a timeless past I have risen to 
 Rule this kingdom of mine" 
 The eye of the wolves will guide me 
 Through landscapes of ancient black 
 I am eternal, I am supreme 
 I ride the nocturnal winds 
 Thy cry of ravens will carry me 
 Forth dimensions unknown by mortals 
 I am eternal, I am supreme 
 The nocturnal winds are mine 
 I descend into forests long forgotten 
 The naked trees united in perfect 
 Melancholy 
 And I saw spirits dancing, 
 Swirling insane 
 The knowledge revealed to me 
 In darkness reborn 
 Through midnight spheres I dance 
 Spreading my wings 
 In the forest of pernicious black 
 Night is eternal 
 The sun is forever consumed 
 Embraced by the beautiful blackness 
 So sombre, so pure
