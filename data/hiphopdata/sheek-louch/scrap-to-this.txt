This is steel glock music slash hip-hop music 
 Slash rock music, no, not pop music 
 This is heavy at the bar, big cigar, hood chick wit'chu 
 Fat ass, somethin' loud in the cat 
 Long-ass barrel, the shells big 
 All black mask over me, chick anne in a cold wig 
 Comin' through newhaven, 24's what I'm cravin 
 Ain't that scary? TV's "something about mary" 
 System up, alpine just on 9 
 Lil' kids wanna open the blind, it's a hood thing 
 I make these dudes wanna get more, that's a good thing 
 Hold up; I ain't no role model 
 I just make a model roll up, send her to the stage and hit the pole up 
 Liquor drinkin', club small 
 Hood little hole in the wall, that's where I be y'all 
 Chain hangin' like "what?! come rob me" 
 Hood rats (thugs) ladies (thugs) 
 I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uh, gyeah 
 Hood rats (thugs) ladies (thugs) 
 I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uh 
 Put your hands up (hey) put your hands up (hey) 
 I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uh 
 Put your hands up (hey) put your hands up (hey) 
 I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, let's go 
 I like to smoke and go past the clouds 
 Like to drink and don't stand there homey, I walk through crowds 
 I ain't a trouble maker, I'm just not soft 
 But these dudes will shoot, so please don't push me 
 I've been workin out, startin to get a nice little build 
 We can scrap on the other wing, get you killed 
 Ain't no formula here, I just spit what I want 
 I don't care what's in rotation or hot for the month 
 I don't stress the pd to play my song 
 A hit is a hit, with sheek you know what you get 
 Somethin' crazy that the streets eat'll up 
 So don't matter if it's there yet homey; it will heat up 
 I'm right there - o.g. slash young boys nightmare 
 Yeah, what I do in the booth 
 Sheek walk around with, what they shoot off the roof 
 Ain't that the truth, one thing you just can't change 
 And that's hood love when everything else seems strange 
 Now these chickens wanna jump in my clique 
 They say you got a club hit, when it die they don't watch you forget 
 That's why I push it to the limit, like ross that's it! 
 "I'm wearing my heart like a crown..."
