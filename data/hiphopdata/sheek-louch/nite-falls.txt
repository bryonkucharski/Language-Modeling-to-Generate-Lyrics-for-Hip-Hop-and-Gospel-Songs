Let the wolfs out 
 He comes to ... again 
 His skin is darker 
 Think I'm shopping the ... again 
 Stash ... opened up the rooms again 
 Party is over 
 But we ain't popping over ... again 
 You see the 40 on my waist 
 They see my face 
 They'll be like 
 A... noise 
 When the night starts to fall 
 I'm painting this vivid picture 
 In my private ... 
 The bullets will come to get you 
 You see ... night time to a sunny 
 Hey man don't be fucking with my money 
 They'll be like 
 When the night starts to fall 
 And where we go from here 
 Is it safe 
 Is it ... clear 
 Is it ... ear 
 Is it the women in the trunks and the cars 
 And the jewels on the bodies ... news 
 I ain't playing with these fools 
 They see me they'll be like 
 Show off 
 They see me they'll be like 
 As crazy 
 When the night starts to fall 
 Stupid isn't stupid 
 He's going down 
 Understand how stupid he was 
 But it's ironic 'cause he got a stupid boss 
 ... Super false 
 ... Is your time 
 When the night starts to fall
