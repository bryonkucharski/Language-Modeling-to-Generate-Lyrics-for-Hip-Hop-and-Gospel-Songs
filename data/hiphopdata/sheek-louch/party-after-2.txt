(Sheek - Intro) 
 Hey, come here baby 
 I know you ain't tired 
 Whaa, what that mean, ay pour a drink 
 We gon party you with me 
 Homie bring that in 
 (Jeremih - Chorus) 
 I got five sexy women plus some five star love in my house 
 And on the walls, got Gucci linen 
 My bartender keep the bottles poppin' all night, ni-ii-ght 
 Ni-ii-ght, ni-iiii-ght, niiiiight 
 All night 
 (Sheek) 
 I pull up in that Maserati 
 Come inside baby it's the after party 
 What you like, Ciroc? Or the dark Bacardi? 
 I got a couple dutch's rolled up 
 I don't see the hold up, like that, everybody growed up, we grown 
 My little chocolate thing, my butter pecan momma 
 My white girl is hot too and she like Obama 
 My little asian chick and my Jamaican girl, 
 Wind on me, wind on me 
 Damn 'cause she love the... ha 
 My left hand is froze, high got me spillin' Rose 
 On her thousand dollar redbottom open toes 
 I be in the hood, but tonight I'm not 
 I got the party jumping off in my own spot 
 (Jeremih - Chorus) 
 I got five sexy women plus some five star love in my house 
 And on the walls, got Gucci linen 
 My bartender keep the bottles poppin' all night, ni-ii-ght 
 Ni-ii-ght, ni-iiii-ght, niiiiight 
 All night 
 (Sheek - Verse 2) 
 You're now listening to this lyrical Christening 
 Haters wan' be dissin' him cause their baby momma on me 
 I make the women horny, just the way that I am 
 D-Block, the way I look up in that black Lam' 
 Chain watch bezel iced out, God Damn! 
 Real, in the hood that's my fam 
 I do Patron shots, she like red wine 
 She looking at me like she ready for her bedtime 
 They call me Don Don, flow so ridiculous 
 I like 'em fat too, come here, are you ticklish? 
 Eat my like a liquorice, or better yet your favourite dish 
 You think I'm home by myself, hater remember this... 
 (Jeremih - Chorus) 
 I got five sexy women plus some five star love in my house 
 And on the walls, got Gucci linen 
 My bartender keep the bottles poppin' all night, ni-ii-ght 
 Ni-ii-ght, ni-iiii-ght, niiiiight 
 All night 
 (Jeremih - Bridge) 
 'Cause we don't stop till it's gone 
 Stop till it's gone 
 So don't leave me, leave me 
 The ? burning my soul, ? 
 Don't leave me, leave me 
 Oh-oh-okay, thinkin' 'bout you, blue lingerie 
 Quarter past 2, shawty swing my way 
 So hit the phone, you can tell it's on 
 (Jeremih - Chorus) 
 I got five sexy women plus some five star love in my house 
 And on the walls, got Gucci linen 
 My bartender keep the bottles poppin' all night, ni-ii-ght 
 Ni-ii-ght, ni-iiii-ght, niiiiight 
 All night
