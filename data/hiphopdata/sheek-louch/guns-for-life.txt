I love my heat, yeah, you know hat it is 
 You know it stay hot, just a little tale about my gun 
 Feel the neck on that nigga, that's my homey, uh, yo, aiyo 
 I kept the same gun for nine years, navy blue glock 
 In the blue safe, right upstairs 
 I make sure that little nigga stay warm, tuck him under my pillow 
 Case the robbers come, I gotta perform 
 Kiss him night-night, mwuah, read him bedtime stories 
 Times I just stared at him, the Glock .40 
 His belly stay full, and he on a strict diet 
 I feed him lead, he good, he at ease when fired 
 Go to sleep Mr. Gat, I had him doing doubles for two days 
 And this the only way I get back 
 Besides changing your diaper, me and your click 
 Got niggas defecating in shit bags, they full of shit 
 Yeah, that still my nigga though, son 
 I can't live without him 
 Special relationship with that muthafucka 
 You feel me right? You feel me, Ghost? 
 Wu-Block, uh 
 I known him ever since he was nine, now he 22 
 Thinking he 45, that nigga is live 
 Like to come with me everywhere when I drive 
 Trouble maker same time, keep you alive 
 His ego too big, he be getting pumped 
 I told him chill, he said it's better when you getting jumped 
 No matter how you face it, now matter where you place me 
 Since the day that I was born, I ain't have safety 
 He went from Y.O. to Staten, that's real talk 
 He hung with Puff, he was with Shyne in Club New York 
 Now he with me, he hurt him like Angelina Jolie 
 With them babies, I raised them up from 380's 
 I raised them up from 380's, I raised them up from 380's 
 That Wu-Block shit, nigga, yeah 
 I still pour liquor after I pop bottles 
 Got a friend named Deuce Nickel, the cops got him 
 Back then when the coke price was rock bottom 
 I robbed a lot of spots with him, and I'm not lying 
 Then I got knocked with him and the cops kept him 
 I reminisce and get high over a lot of weapons 
 Got a friend named Nine, caught up in the murder one 
 I ain't seen him since, 'cause my man had to murder son 
 Homey named Thirty-Eight, he pop with him 
 And it ain't too often that he's not with him 
 Call 'em your guns, I call 'em my friends 
 Pop it off or keep it tucked, guess it all that depend, yeah
