Pretty Tone, I got you, fingers 
 Morphine flow, lean on the brass gold 
 I can see your snake eyes without the crap roll 
 Bust the mack stroll, laughing at you assholes 
 Sticking thorns in my pride like the Black Crowes 
 Cracking your dome for breakfast, Deck spit 
 Lava, fresh like the produce section 
 Repping, there's no use testing, you know who stepped in 
 It's Deck bitch, for those who question 
 Like Serena on the swerve, I swing hard 
 Main event, bad broads with ring card 
 This shit here, niggas get the fiend nod 
 On the wreck, though, these cowards never seen yard 
 Head boss, you scavenge off what Deck toss 
 I don't fall for petty talk I check the source 
 Flex force with army arms, I lets off 
 Bomb threat, blow both your stanky legs off 
 [ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah 
 [SL]Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son 
 [ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah 
 [Method Man]Blaow, bang, 'cause 
 [GK]'Cause I write, and blast and slash your whole level 
 [SL]Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son 
 [ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah 
 [GK]Yeah, kid 
 Pay attention, gun shots, fuck what you benching 
 Big chains on my neck, my wrist is Clinton 
 Presidential Rolex, coming out the projects 
 Seat back looking mean in a foreign object 
 Three for twenty in Japan, with American money 
 Get back home, get head from American bunnies 
 My Iron Fists, my platinum wrists 
 My cook up game is chemists, fuck my nemesis 
 Fly birds like Tyson do, had to switch 
 From the car to the cargo on board Jet Blue 
 Bodies drop from the Liquid Swords, been making hits for years 
 But I'm mad I ain't got no awards 
 I'm a real OG tho', swag like James Bond and 'em 
 My white tee is my tuxedo 
 Belts on the track, Sheek and Ghostface 
 Got the hood on smash, RZA leave it like that 
 We be jammin', I grill on the track just like salmon 
 I don't play no games, baccarat or backgammon 
 I'm Supreme Cliente', rawer than sushi 
 And if your girl got my number, means I beat that pussy 
 Sword slayer, dick slinger, I got the stroll 
 Of an R&B singer, Wu-Tang ruckus bringer 
 36 different dialects, we call spot checks 
 My homeland security, is up in the projects 
 Shaolin, Stapleton, Bricks on Broad Street 
 That's where niggas get chopped up like raw meat 
 Fuck that, started off rocking a stocking 
 Over my face, now my face is what gets it popping 
 Donnie had the wave voice, being blowed through the mic 
 The definition of TRU TV, fuck SPIKE 
 I'm the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks 
 Too black for BET, too wild for Cops
