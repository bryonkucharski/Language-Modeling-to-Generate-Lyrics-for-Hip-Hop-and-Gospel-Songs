Yeah, out the window of that range or that muscle car 
 Arm hanging out the window, diamonds in that big shepard 
 Weed in the crack cigar, more sour in the jar 
 Looking both ways, I'm cautious when I'm ("drivin' round") 
 Hood rats that's fresh but barely feed they kids 
 Little kids that's killas and love doing bids 
 Unemployment lines, mexicans'll work for nothing 
 You pray with 'em but you don't who that priest been touching 
 Liquor stores, strip clubs, filthy whores 
 Somebody daughter getting ten singles to drop her drawers 
 Crack fiends buy new TV for twenty beans 
 Niggas trynna get money, police ("drivin' round") 
 Blue flags, red flags, different gangs 
 Og's still outside, it never change 
 Mcdonald's, Chinese food, a thousand chains 
 I'm just trynna use my brains when I'm ("drivin' round") 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 Look I'm fresh back from out of state, JFK arrival 
 A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day 
 And I'm feeling idle, slide through Medina, son 
 I done pushed everything, I love the way the benz swing 
 So I turn my music low, caught a thought, wrote it down 
 I seen 'em come back from out of town and get laid down 
 It's music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing 
 It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving 
 Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing 
 They waving, I'm leaning hard, cruising, grooving to the beat 
 As I move through these mean streets, I beep at the seeds 
 Stop, bless 'em with a little gwop, ha 
 I keep it rolling, picture me, twirling 
 The big truck, yukon, my sheep skin showing all the leathers 
 It's a cold world, winter war weather 
 This is wu-block music for the black hooded champions 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 What is the key to life, with no ignition 
 Another jump start, then I'm on my mission 
 I keep id, insurance and registration 
 Wu music, good hemp and stimulation 
 Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians 
 Blacks, whites, asians, indians and mexicans 
 At the light, the bass head, fragile as the pringle 
 He ask me can I spare change, I throw him singles 
 He mimics my song that's on repeat 
 Addictions so strong, got him in knee deep 
 Buttons on his lapel, picture of obama 
 Four years later we stuck in this same drama 
 These street corners, just over crowded saunas 
 Biggest losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma 
 Education to a thug is well debated 
 Each crime is kinfolk, all bloods related 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round") 
 Step in the car and go 
 Round down by your lady and I 
 Be waiting at the door 
 We bout to go ("drivin' round")
