Yo, brown Napoleon Dynamite, white Dolemite 
 Sho' Ya Right, Holy Moly, totally tight 
 White America, good morning Erykah 
 Badu, where are you at? 
 Allahu Akbar, do that, do that, do that 
 Do-do that that that 
 Do do do, do do that 
 Do that, show that, pro-black, pro-brown 
 Down, round, getting down, down 
 Yippee-kai-yai-yay, it's a showdown 
 Girls say chill, you ain't too cool to be nice to boo-boo 
 You right, you right, you right, true, true 
 Sorry if I'm acting too cool cool 
 All the zoom zoom got me acting like there's flowers in my doo doo 
 I'mma roll the dice for some new shoes 
 If that don't work then, boo hoo 
 At least you couldn't say I never grew two 
 If I can't win, then it's lose-lose 
 Do it for the kids like Blue's Clues 
 Choo-choo-choose to be 
 Half-asshole, half-bashful 
 Uh, give me like half a glass full 
 Or maybe a quarter that 
 I'm like a black quarterback 
 In the motherfucking, oh shit, bobbing, ducking 
 Weaving, passing and running 
 Passing and running, passing and running 
 Like a caravan 
 Um, wait, what was it? 
 I don't even know, buddy 
 Exactly 
 As my grandma knits the sweater 
 Chickens with the cheddar 
 Timbos and yarmulkes, you ain't in my genre 
 Bitch, blow me: harmonica 
 Arts and leisure, peace to Jon Caramanica 
 Sam Sifton rate the plate that we feasting on 
 I jerk my penis off at the precinct, dog 
 Since a youth, all proposals been indecent, dog 
 Sense of humor so I'm down for a comedic song 
 Rub my dick like my zipper when I walk 
 Touch of Down's Syndrome, flip it when she talks 
 Gums are purple, teeth monkey 
 Her look is mix with streetwalker and a junkie
