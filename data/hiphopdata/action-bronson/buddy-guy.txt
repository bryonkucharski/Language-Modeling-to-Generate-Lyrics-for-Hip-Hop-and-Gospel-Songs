Uh, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Bronsolinio, yeah 
 Aye yo 
 Stoned on the stoop, got the box pumpin' Billy Joel 
 I'm Mickey Mantle while you motherfuckers semi-pro 
 Neck to colon how a slice from the machete go 
 Shoot your gun and throw confetti 'cause I'm ready ho! 
 Look in my eyes, you can tell that I'm a stand-up 
 Call me the teacher, wanna talk just put your hands up 
 We eat the lamb, duck, goose, beef or chicken 
 Two-seater shiftin' with the smooth Cedar Strippin' 
 My facial hair is light red just like a ball of fire 
 Golden sound, blow the town, 'lo attire 
 Brown haze leather swampy like the Everglades 
 I'll switch a style so that I'm ready when the era change 
 First pressed virgin oil from the Greek Border 
 Spit the shit that have me laid up with the sheik's daughter 
 Three quarter on the Bally jacket to the knee 
 Lights flashin' when I'm rappin', tappin' tree 
 That smoke lingers son it shine through the curtain 
 Cracked pepper motherfucker I'mma grinder for certain 
 So never in your life come with scared business here 
 Fuck around never found bitch, disappear 
 Time after time I'm a winner 
 Seasoned in the barrel, harvest in the winter 
 Far from a beginner, keep an extra cartridge in the denim 
 Twisted off of Manischewitz, Harlem in a rental 
 The hash candidate, kindly gorgeous 
 360 is the ways and the Caesar's huggin' knotty flosses 
 Never stop until we hoppin' out of grimey Porsches 
 One night shorty needin' over 9 abortions 
 I'm the whole shit, one you wanna roll with 
 When in canoe waving the ganja like a glow stick 
 Number one, numero uno with the flow shit 
 Your style is tired and limp just like an old dick 
 Bitch 
 Roman sculptures, all of my students hold a diploma 
 Straight to the back, garage door, behold the Lotus 
 Finest tuna right out the sea straight off the boat this 
 Hurricane rap spit tap low, rock a toga 
 Bronsonelli chef de cuisine I flex the two seam 
 Inject the vein with marijuana I'm a true fiend 
 Up-to-the-minute, all the weapons we invented 
 That's hidden inside the rented, the window tinted ten the percentage 
 Sacrificin' the lamb for the nutrition 
 "Criminology 101" hard cover, newest edition 
 Nuclear fission is heavy weighty top the division 
 Lots of provisions colossal status stoppin' collisions 
 Too beaucoup, fresher than a lake trout 
 Barbecue the venison, pair it with a great stout 
 Peace I'm out kid, a motherfucker pace out 
 Every time I take that motherfuckin' weapon from my waist out
