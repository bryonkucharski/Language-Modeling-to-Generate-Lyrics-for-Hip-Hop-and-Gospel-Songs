Yeah, here I am again, Big Fuckin' Body, it's me 
 We done came a long fucking way from stealing out the supermarket man 
 I'm out here, oh my god 
 We out here so fuckin' heavy man 
 Mr. Motherfuckin' Marvelous Himself 
 But enough about me man, and more about myself 
 We out here, all types of big situations on the table, man 
 And I'm just pulling my chair up man 
 Let me put my motherfucking paper plates up, man 
 Big Body 
 The 06 Commissary King 
 I had the most fuckin' tunas in the house 
 Rice game, soup game ridiculous man

 Soap, deodorant on stack 
 Ask about me man 
 Two buckets under the bed man 
 Fuck outta here 
 You must be outchea motherfuckin' mind man

 This is me man 
 No rap checks man

 Platinum in the street 
 You must be out your fuckin' head 
 It's me, though
