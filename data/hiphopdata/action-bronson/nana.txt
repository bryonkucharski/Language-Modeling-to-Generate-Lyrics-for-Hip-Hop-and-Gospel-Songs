Introducin' Chance the Ruthless 
 Trip 'shrooms and lucy 
 Dreams is lucid 
 Loosely based on music 
 Swallow my mucus 
 Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus 
 Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG) 
 Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha 
 They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit 
 They use of illusion could confuse Confucius 
 Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy 
 Last week suspended 
 Last night kissed Va$htie 
 Parleyed with Ashley 
 Always in the hallway, so I never been classy 
 (Ha ha ha) Shut up 
 (Igh, igh, igh, igh!) 
 Acid acid, get it? Acid 
 Melts through plastic, I spit fired 
 Pad my palette, talkin' paper 
 If this was work, I'd get higher 
 Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered 
 Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack 
 Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell 
 From peelin' banana splits back 
 Give me my Kit-Kat 
 Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch? 
 Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch 
 Zen with that chakra 
 I eat it like Idi Amin, Ya Kna Wha Mean 
 Hit me back when that mean shit 
 (Igh, igh, igh, igh!) 
 Introducin', It's Bronsonlino 
 With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino 
 3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino 
 Lettin' trees blow, oh 
 I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit 
 I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (get to the chopper) 
 I splash summer like a fast brother 
 With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm 
 Back, acid in my hat 
 Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag 
 My new shorty got a gymnastic back 
 87 emerald green on a classic jag 
 She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad 
 She had the club foot, with that little arm 
 I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm 
 I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on 
 Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde 
 Queens, baby 
 Blow me
