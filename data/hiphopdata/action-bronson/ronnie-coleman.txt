When I'm alone 
 Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home 
 Often thinking why the fuck is it I'm not in Rome 
 If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body 
 I see it now Bronson a heart-throbby 
 No more pigging out, binging on the late night 
 No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight 
 No more packing hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right 
 40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right 
 I'm eating salad but I'm leaving off the croutons 
 Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn 
 Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons 
 Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon 
 Lock the refrigerator, there's no controlling me 
 Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin' hold on me 
 Ain't trying to be laid in a box, roses on me 
 Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory 
 Lets go, 20 more to go baby boy 
 Yo you want that V by the crotch right? 
 Yeah lets go (I want it) 
 Gimme some pushups 
 Gimme some dips (I can't no more) 
 Let me get some jumping jacks (Gimme a sandwich!) 
 Yeah you want that steak dinner don't you? (Ah) 
 Your gonna work that sandwich off now (I need marshmallows!) 
 Yeah lets fuckin' go 
 20 more miles, lets go you fat fuck 
 (Ah marshmallows, give it to me) 
 You motherfucker, you, fuck you! 
 From Philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque 
 I'm getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute 
 An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer 
 Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer 
 Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened 
 Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping 
 I don't want know one to know that I took it 
 'Cause I'm an over-eater (Hey, yo, uh, fry the mayonnaise for me, man) 
 Life is a smorgasbord to me and I'ma over do it 
 I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don't cut it 
 Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded 
 The shit they model in Milan that's looking crispy custom 
 5 and 6 bitches, lickin' my dick twitches 
 Serve up a facial, miss the Belgium bitches dismiss em 
 For now I'll take what I can get till this shit switches 
 Whatever fuck you stupid bitch 
 Yo here's to the Drums of Heaven 
 Here's to beef ribs 
 Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids 
 Go on a diet, then fall off because I'm weak kid 
 Since I was young I'm eatin' candy on the sneak tip 
 My day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol 
 Though at my height and weight I'm probably still the best at ball 
 I'm tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all 
 I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles 
 Yeah, Bronsolino 
 Bout to be fuckin', summer time in the winter 
 Shirtless
