Uh, yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in 
 Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in 
 I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her 
 You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered 
 Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy? 
 Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy? 
 Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy? 
 Ma, you know I'm still your little baby 
 All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up 
 Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us 
 See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!" 
 No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from 
 Baby, oh, my lord 
 The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford 
 Shit, I'm on that all-night tour 
 Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw 
 I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor 
 You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord 
 Hot hoes every city that we go, singin' 
 "Heads high, kill 'em with it now!" 
 Uh, all I do is eat oysters 
 And speak six languages in three voices 
 It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat 
 Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin' 
 Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker 
 With Anita Baker, uh 
 Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself 
 I should kiss myself 
 I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror 
 The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!) 
 Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah) 
 All my women play the flute 
 Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt' 
 Left handed, make the Fender cry 
 Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye 
 Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh 
 Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street 
 And turn your chest plate to lunch meat 
 I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me 
 Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby 
 I switch the season, now the hair's curled 
 Tan skin, I need a bad girl 
 Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World" 
 In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl 
 That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"
