You can find us in the garden like Spike on any night 
 Encrusted in some ice that look bluish in the light 
 Spanish on the mistress, Jewish on the wife 
 Shootin' like a Piston, aim for proper distance 
 Live from London, number crunchin' 
 Drivin' gloves with some Asian bitches rubbin' me with sponges 
 Expensive lunches, wages off of hunches 
 I bet the dogs and if I win it then the paper yours 
 Pack your bag, wash your pussy, then leave 
 Meet me at the airport, the plane is leaving at 3 
 She said all right, blew smoke through my nose 
 It's the talented younger stallion, no Pinocchio nose 
 Please stop your shit's all hype dude 
 Meanwhile the wrist all spiteful 
 Just be real, that shit's not like you 
 Man you know these things go through a cycle 
 Straight from Queens rock fatigue all weather 
 Fila three-quarter cream feet all leather 
 Never sing the blues, man my team mo' better 
 We blow cheddar, au four feta 
 City lights shine bright on my complexion 
 Self-reflection, red hands flashing at the intersection 
 Life is green-lit, one star no script 
 Supporting actors, fresh peaches no pit 
 I love my people, considered as my brothers 
 Came from different mothers, came up in the same struggle 
 Some estranged, some deep up in the game still 
 Money separate, believe you know the fame will 
 Ayo macerate the fruit, tap it over angel's food 
 Yeah we gettin' loot, Timberland the boot 
 Kush is by prescription, prolific in the kitchen 
 People on my dick because I'm vicious with the diction 
 House shoes and some khakis on the west 
 Hit the beach up, twist the Cheech up, let the beat thump 
 Never fuckin' with the crab that's pre-lumped 
 Makin' bitches sign a pre-nup 
 Chocolate with the mean rump 
 Serve some cream stuff, shit to make the fiends jump 
 Crispy greenery, tropical the scenery 
 Believe you me, this shit ain't always what it seem to be 
 I'm feastin' dolo down in Eataly 
 I'm in the street like a hooker's feet 
 I'm known to sit on leather 
 I'm smokin' hash and marijuana cause it go together 
 Old school PAL at the colder center 
 Three AM we on the corner rockin' Polo sweater 
 Thank you 
 It might be the illest track I ever wrote 
 Who left it? You? 
 Word yo 
 I'm sippin' something, I gotta sip before I rap 
 I gotta ooh ooh ooh 
 Bing bing bing bing bing 
 Exactly 
 Bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing 
 It's rap
