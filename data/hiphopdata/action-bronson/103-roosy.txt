Medication in the plastic bag 
 I'm a man motherfucker, you're a half a fag 
 My chest is hairy like the Cubans rocking silk 
 In the 80s on Miami beach 
 You're just a rabbit that be captured by the falcons feet 
 I hunt for the meat see me we can thump in the street 
 Fuck around leave you slumped in your seat 
 'Cause we're coming from Queens, every platter is Zagat rated 
 Caramelized up, bulls are getting castrated 
 Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me 
 Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery 
 Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex 
 Yoga stretch, open pussy like a sofa bed 
 Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan 
 Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter 
 Pair of shooters Anthony and Harper 
 Caciocavalli dog I'm sharper than the archer 
 I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan 
 Cause everyone getting paid see me with the freshest fade 
 Charles Oakley gecko belts and durangos 
 I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango 
 NFL ready, sculpted for the clay court 
 Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport 
 Suck my dick bitch real good 
 Mother fuck a kid, Action Bronsolino suck my balls 
 No disrespect ma, I'm tryna eat the pussy 
 Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy 
 King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house 
 260 pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth 
 5'7" with the ass of of a horse 
 Put it in from behind it's the salad I toss 
 She ride me like a maniac 
 Best believe the bitch a brainiac 
 She known to keep a fresh shaven cat 
 Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun 
 Keep a loaded 22 inside her thighs and her buns 
 Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun 
 She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums 
 Boosting in the boostiere 
 I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray 
 Fucking tired can't go no more 
 My raps are marinated days ahead 
 Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread 
 That's for breakfast 
 I've got a death wish you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace 
 I'm on the block like tetris 
 Caddy green Northstar engine 
 Pecan pie seats Lord I'm a legend 
 Queens shit man
