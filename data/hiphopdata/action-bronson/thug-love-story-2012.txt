She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have 
 Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag 
 She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid 
 Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers 
 And selling the pussy for paper to play 
 Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains 
 At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel 
 She quick to split up an owl 
 She loves some dick in her bowels 
 Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour 
 Straight flieshman 
 In the private part of her pussy pocket 
 Randomly pussy farting 
 Sold at the hookers auction 
 Left as a crooked orphan 
 Wrapped in the sports section 
 Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what 
 Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar 
 Apple cider baths 
 Sit in the vinegar 
 Bronsolino 
 PS 
 Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone 
 You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet 
 We were young then, experimental periods 
 Laid a towel 'cause I fucked you on your period 
 Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King 
 Young love, but we thought it was eternity 
 Raw sex, never thought about paternity 
 But now this cunt is trying to murder me 
 Abusing me physically and verbally 
 Said my dick was too small 
 I went and got the surgery, just to show it off 
 This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off 
 Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song 
 Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights 
 Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes 
 She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head 
 .25 out the pussy and it spits lead 
 We always end up in a situation 
 She throwing diapers out the window at me 
 Called the cops said I beat her face 
 Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace 
 I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum 
 On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon 
 Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch 
 In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck 
 Cold, tired and I mean it 
 I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix 
 Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit 
 But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix 
 But I'mma to do what I gotta do 
 Trying to make this French dough like a Pâte à Choux 
 Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed 
 Smoking Ethiopian red 
 The son goes, a single teardrop fallopians bled 
 Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed 
 It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain 
 I keep the weiner on display for the campaign 
 I'm just doing what I had to do 
 Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going 
 To the top till I fall just like Owen 
 Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a love state
