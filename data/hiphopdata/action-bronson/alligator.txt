(Hook: Action Bronson) 
 Baby my ride so clean, I ride so dirty 
 I'm about to buy an alligator for my birthday 
 My girl asking me, "Where you been?", don't worry 
 She said, "Baby I crashed the Benz", don't worry 
 I ride so clean, my ride so dirty 
 I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday 
 My girl asking me, "Where you been?" don't worry 
 She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry 
 Dropkicks out the drop-top 6 
 Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this 
 Stay in the water like the Loch Ness 
 Shirtless rocking a locket 
 Drugs in my pocket 
 It's all for a profit 
 Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers 
 Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster 
 Orgies at Hofstra 
 My bank account is like a Polish doctor 
 My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera 
 My drugs as strong as Arnold 
 They found her dead in the gold Impala 
 Hanging backwards out the chopper 
 The room smell like Nag Champa 
 Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers 
 Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit 
 I've driven every flavored whip there is to get 
 Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff 
 I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut 
 These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it 
 I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing sega 
 Prince of Albania 
 No money, nothing to say to ya 
 I push the limo to the stadium 
 Game 7, Knicks-Heat 
 Me and Spike had to switch seats 
 'Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet 
 Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet 
 Down in Mexico eating chick' meat 
 No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets 
 I saw her walking 'cause I'm stalking on the dead streets 
 Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet 
 She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon 
 Said she was a daughter of a Reverend 
 Well thank god I don't believe in heaven 
 Butt cheeks sculpted like a horses hind 
 Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line 
 Annual abortion time 
 Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th 
 Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off 
 And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough 
 Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign 
 Matter of time till she placed and laced in a wood pine 
 For years she was the hood slime 
 Now no longer having a good time 
 Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth 
 Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph 
 Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah 
 As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning 
 Instinctively they heading towards the water 'cause they need it 
 Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiends wrist 
 Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship 
 My mustache like a Colonel 
 Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal 
 A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal 
 I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the inferno
