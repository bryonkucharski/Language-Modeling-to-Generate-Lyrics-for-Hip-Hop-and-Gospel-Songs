Ayo, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready right, the fast life 
 Getting twisted almost every night, my mind is deeper 
 Than the voice featured on Barry White, I'm not the marry type 
 I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight 
 I'm flattered at all the chatter and comparisons 
 To the great, soon to see me right on Madison 
 Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins 
 I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi 
 Outdoors with my sport vest, leather on the shoulder 
 Hold the rifle in place, knife in your face 
 I'm out the world just like a lightning in space 
 The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes 
 This is madness, certified madness 
 Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage 
 Single-handedly slam you to the canvas 
 Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage 
 Fuck the love, I want the money and the pussy 
 Brazilian bitches, names tatted on their tushie 
 You're a man dressed as a woman, call him Tootsie 
 I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie 
 Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp, fuck shrimp 
 We eat steak, wine and cheese plate 
 Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state 
 Play it cool or taste the weapon, time to meet fate 
 My feet slide just like a hockey player 
 Eating yakitori, getting hammered in the sake lair 
 Sucky sucky, happy ending shower 
 Wifey making dinner, I'll be home about an hour 
 Crush the sour, dutches from the Netherlands 
 My rolling skills is undefeated yo you'll never win 
 I bring the devil in, Bronson known for his benevolence 
 Polo fitted with a leather grip 
 This is madness, certified madness 
 Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage 
 Single-handedly slam you to the canvas 
 Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage 
 I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up 
 Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore 
 Hop in the whip and go for breakfast 
 Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas 
 Damn I'm living reckless, smoking all day just like the brisket 
 My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit 
 Everyday I'm thinking should I risk it, add another number to statistics 
 Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix 
 I'll feed her coke for a dick suck 
 Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt 
 Now it's on the computer, got the pussy moister than Bermuda 
 Pop a hole right through her throat, that's no joke 'cause I'mma shoot her 
 Yeah, damn, yo, fuck 
 Yo, three verses ain't enough anymore these days man? Fuck 
 This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars 
 Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma 
 It's always drama, she got too much time on her hands 
 Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man 
 My eyes are open like an owl though 
 Animosity, trying to get the paper, sour dough 
 But if I die before the hour go 
 Just place the Bally's on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho 
 Egyptian fixtures, patties by the coliseum 
 Guns from Russia, I turn 'em to a ballerina 
 Cop the work then they bagging coke 
 Transporting interstate, Carolina to Tobacco Road 
 To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go 
 Master flow work now so I got cash to blow 
 When I'm older, leather on a rugby shoulder 
 I'm top dogging if I'm lying may they slump me over
