Lace up your Timbs, Queens, fresh off the blacktop 
 All foreign recital ? fiends on the backlot 
 Back alley Bronson always cookin' up a mad plot 
 The shit that have us laid in Benzes with a glass top 
 Hash pot, stickin' out the dash spot 
 I'll leave a bitch in a vacant and let his ass rot 
 One seven for ? an autobahn is where the cash drop 
 Then take the paper, then distribute to the have-nots 
 I'm on the scene, 26, and I'm a manchild 
 'Lo machete, hoppin' out the fan's style? 
 Whether fightin' or graffiti, got them hand styles 
 I'll wipe the floor up with your face like a ShamWow 
 Hands down, one motherfucker 
 260 combined, here to bring the ruckus 
 The bassline plus the words raise the crime rate 
 Bronsolini show 'em how to hold a 9 straight 
 Yo, get off the next man's P.P 
 Be original, kid, get off the P.P 
 Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P 
 Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P 
 Yo, the drugs are rolled up, the money fold up 
 I like my bitches big-body like an old truck 
 With their waists sliced inches like the cold cuts 
 Been at the bottom of the sea, but then I rose up 
 Feet first, my voice is known to curl a honey's toes 
 Serve a pound of that, I'll leave 'em with a bloody nose 
 Smoke the hash, take it, form like a puddy, holmes 
 Hop in the Caddy, leave your body by a muddy road 
 A dirty rotten scoundrel like Steve Martin 
 Drugs so good, Fiend Weekly just three-starred 'em 
 I'm on the road, blow trees through East Harlem 
 Just put me in a cage in the basement, I'm retarded 
 German shift, twist, burn to bliss 
 I love it when the pussy tighter like a tourniquet 
 Copped the chicken, started cookin' and converted it 
 Dutch leaf, third of it, roll it up, murder it 
 Yo, get off the next man's P.P 
 Be original, kid, get off the P.P 
 Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P 
 Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P
