Yo, pop, sniff confetti for the toast 
 Dropkicks like Janetty off the ropes 
 Mach 6 smoking heavy on the coast 
 See me dip the law like vanilla in a cone 
 Use caution 'cause if not, then you a goner 
 Only talk business where we sitting in a sauna 
 Ain't trying to be in prison, taking shits up in the corner 
 Rikers Island know the water so it's all water 
 Shoes native, rock a husky as a headdress 
 Mind's sick so we need to be on bedrest 
 You're favourite niece give me head sex 
 She's a squirter, so the bed's wet 
 You're gonna have to lay the towel down 
 Retard shit, class in the basement 
 Free form jazz band, eat a pussy 
 While she do a handstand, out in Flushing call me Bam-Bam 
 Smoke good, stay chopped, Van Damme hand 
 Damn, the bitch like Mrs. Schroeder 
 Vinegar by the bed, that's for the vicious odor 
 Vicodin from Minnesota, make her kiss the cobra 
 Bottle service, snap my fingers, tell them bring it over 
 "Oh but I don't even drink" 
 Then shorty sipped the liquor, then I'll fuck her on the sink 
 Red mink to the ankle mat lotioned 
 Arch your back, slow motion 
 Hold a green toast out in Oakland, shooting juice in my upper cheek 
 Shorty dripping like a tunnel leak 
 You know your whole team pussy like a muffin sheet 
 Stay balanced like a runner's feet, it's me
