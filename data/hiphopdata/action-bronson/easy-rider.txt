(Produced By: Party Supplies) 
 Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat 
 Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel 
 I'm leaned back with the Les Paul 
 Shit I smoke is like cholesterol 
 Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival 
 The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call 
 Best believe that there was neck involved 
 Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab 
 Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains 
 Started running with the stallions 
 Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys 
 Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need 
 Rockin' very loose pants, yeah 
 Rockin' very loose pants, yeah 
 Bury a million in the sand, by the clock tower 
 Before I die, take a hot shower 
 Ride the Harley into the sunset 
 By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz 
 With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick 
 I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious 
 Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser 
 A little machine to make espresso 
 I heard your bitch still wears Ecko 
 Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco 
 Live from the Expo, it's me 
 I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center 
 Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner 
 I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans 
 Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin 
 Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team) 
 Bite the eel by the dozen 
 Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand 
 Except this toy cost 80 grand 
 And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been 
 Just from writing words with a pen 
 Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main 
 Put a jacuzzi on the seven train 
 And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face 
 I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste 
 The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches 
 We got twin Mac elevens with the features 
 Shit you barely got sneaker money 
 So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny 
 You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya 
 (I can't hear ya) 
 You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya 
 The Magic Johnson of the game 
 These lames don't want to play with me 
 Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me 
 I know you mad, 'cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see, it's me
