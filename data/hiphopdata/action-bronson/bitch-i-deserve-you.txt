(Intro: Action Bronson) 
 I mean man, I made 872 million off molasses yesterday 
 Straight up 
 I'm only rhymin 'cause I'm nice 
 I don't even give a shit no more 
 We on our way 
 (Hook: Action Bronson) 
 Look at the game say bitch I deserve you 
 Here forever, that's my word boo 
 I know my words slurring now but when I sober up 
 I just called to see how the fuck you've been holding up 
 (Verse 1: Action Bronson) 
 I know you heard your boy's been hopping out the Rover truck 
 Long remove from when I rode the bus 
 Now I'm diving up in Polish sluts 
 With the gorgeous butts 
 And she love it when I throw her in the Cobra clutch 
 Window half down 
 Smoke trickle out 
 Stripper vixen out the blouse 
 Put the pickle in the pouch 
 No more sushi, style reserved for the past days 
 Big joints filled with hash in my ashtrays 
 We still fam' though we chose different pathways 
 I heard you're sniffing 
 Cleaning plates like the Cascade 
 Death's the only thing that's certain 
 Once was the cash fades 
 Fuck it, I'm getting money till my last days 
 (Hook x2: Action Bronson and Evidence) 
 (Verse 2: Evidence) 
 Your number changed and I ain't recognized the ringtone 
 So pardon for the unannounced 
 The rain, you know I've been gone 
 Flip the fucking beat up 
 I was looped around the planet 
 In the coupe with the cannon 
 With the car and the camera 
 Paparazzi never flashed 
 The days are way beyond us 
 Fact, they never flash and I'm below the surface, honest 
 Never blast my way out 
 I stroll out, pull by 
 Under the nose of anybody that knows not 
 Check-in's out of courtesy cause these are not requirements 
 Wait until our time is up 
 Iron and the niacin 
 Boomer Esiason, flying out the Lion's den 
 This is weird science, inside a siren's blend 
 I hit the solid ten 
 Water just a little splashing 
 Loop it up and bring it back man, cause this is Action 
 (Hook: Evidence)
