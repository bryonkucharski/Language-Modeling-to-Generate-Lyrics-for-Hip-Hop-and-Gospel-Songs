Yeah my sole purpose 
 Long hair, speak Turkish 
 Twisted sisters out like the UniverSoul Circus 
 About to cop the crib furnished 
 Wood burning brick oven shit with the furnace 
 Quattro fromage 
 Big plate look like a lobster collage 
 I'm on the art and the food scene 
 Fuck rap, laying back, eating poutine 
 Matter of fact, couple raps will make a coupe lean 
 While you see me in the shorts all weather 
 Whether Puerto rica bitches chilling on the boardwalk 
 Rockaway smelling like Georgi 
 Ready for orgies, slightly retarded 
 Breading the porgy 
 20 seconds dead in the forty 
 All this money to be gotten 
 Hailin' from the rotten 
 Scotch make it neat, no socks on the feet 
 When I'm stepping the loafer 
 Creamy like the robiola 
 Guaranteed I'm getting box like an old controller 
 Baby momma catching cases 
 High speed chases 
 Fiends rocking the ID bracelets 
 You only live once, so fuck if I'mma waste it 
 I'm in France, stepping on grapes, you can taste it 
 Yeah, make cheese like the fromagia 
 Tatted chest cover pain wash the scars 
 Daddy disapprove of my life just like I'm Marvin Gaye 
 Keep the Dodge, I want the '87 Saab in gray 
 Stuff a shorty like the man a gut 
 Light tan on the shoe like banana nut 
 Strong odor off the weed like your grandma's butt 
 No attempt to disrespect, but my grandma blunt 
 But I'm known to eat expensive lunches 
 From the farm right to the table 
 Aired straight right to the plate I doubt you could relate 
 Figs at the peak of their ripeness 
 Money off this music, motherfucker I like this 
 So cut the check 
 Ayo, the kush get flipped to a swan origami 
 Floating in the water, north of North Dakota 
 Dip to Barcelona Algeria connection 
 Pussy like a leather jacket 
 Been to hell and back 
 They tried to sell me back, but they couldn't 
 Hookers by the Ho-Jo chillen with Doc Gooden 
 "Tapas up for grabs so fuck it, then why wouldn't 
 Bronson be the one coming through with the gold belt 
 Track 16 on Blue Chips
