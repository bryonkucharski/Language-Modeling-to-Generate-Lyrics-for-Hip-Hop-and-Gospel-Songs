Our lungs are filled with the purple from the jungle 
 Never fumble, got the work right by the grundel 
 Twin dick-sucks for me and my son 
 That's before he was three, smoking weed in the blunt 
 Straight from Flushing, where the birds are hanging dead in the window 
 Scent of garbage make me sick, getting head in the rental 
 Got the lamb rack, pan-roasted, laced it with fennel 
 Little yogurt that been drizzled over might be a winner 
 Come and see me, Nona hand-makes the fettuccine 
 Halla makes the baklava, getting paper kahskaval 
 Lahmacun Salad-smoking savage out of Sarasota 
 Macho man, the taco stand is where the hook is kept 
 30 dollars get you pussycat, right in the kitchen where they cooking at 
 Manteca, architecture Art Deco 
 Twist the pussy like a soft pretzel 
 I'm such a special guy, I'd rather die than ever testify 
 You'd sooner see me at the party with a vest and tie 
 Shorts, that's my steez when I'm stepping 
 Strolling down the streets like the westerns 
 Double weapons, at my sides and preparing for the showdown 
 Spinning like a wild maneuver, wilding at the ho down 
 Hold ground, stand firm, you little sissies got a chance 
 Now it's time to give a man burn 
 Yo, you try to fuck with Bronsolini, it's a crucial calling 
 Guaranteed you're gonna lose just like the Brooklyn brawler 
 Mister Wonderful in short-sets, Cortex 
 Gore-tex the bottom of the feet in case the floor wet 
 Floral scented, hand-crafted on the mother earth 
 Kinda strange, things been funny since my brother's birth 
 Shaking hands as if the money connect 
 Blow a ransom on the yacht, have a seed in Quebec 
 Respect my exquisite mystique, pretty petite 
 Little hookers running wild, giving head in the street 
 But still, slicing nuts, clean off that's with the razor 
 I'm laughing in the tavern in fresh Brunos and blazers, chilling 
 Spark the pepper 
 Queens shit, spark the pepper, PS
