 Don't hurt me again 
 Uh, don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again, baby 
 Nah 
 What up, love? I need a hug cause drugs be takin' over 
 Shorty couldn't take it no more, she went loca 
 No stranger to a rum and soda 
 I met the ho while she was slumped over 
 Shit, I've been good, though, I can't complain 
 I could probably cop a half a plane 
 Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now 
 I'mma strike it rich any day now 
 Uh, you know I gotta get a plate now 
 Virtuoso on a keyboard 
 I rep the eastern seaboard, jeez Lord 
 Please leave the Z3 keys before you leave 
 Don't sneeze on my shit, cause for shiz I'mma flip ya 
 Pedicured foot slide in the slipper 
 Tryna do the remix with Pitbull 
 Tell the pilot land at Schiphol 
 Play the violin with dimples 
 Life's ironic and it's simple 
 Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink 
 Drive nice car, wear all green mink 
 First time I whacked off was a Penthouse 
 Roses in the bath at the penthouse 
 Billy Joel at the garden 
 Should I get a skybox or an '89 IROC? 
 It's always poppin' at the IHOP 
 Choke a pussy with his tie knot, it's my block 
 Chuck Knoblauch, spicy coconut curry from the Thai spot 
 I'm in a hurry, dumb jewelry 
 The verdict read from a hung jury 
 The doctor said that I was hung early 
 Skull curly, Larry, and Moe, I'll marry a ho 
 Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe 
 Twisted off the Jenkem, watching Iron Chef 
 The secret ingredient was lion's neck 
 Royal Blue-Cyber Tech 
 I ride solo like a fighter jet 
 Hurt me again 
 No, don't hurt me again 
 Please, don't hurt me again 
 No, don't hurt me again 
 There's no hit records on a demo 
 There's no hit records on a demo 
 No, don't hurt me again 
 There's no hit records on a demo 
 There's no hit records on a demo 
 Catch me hoppin' out the limo 
 Catch me hoppin' out the limo 
 Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink 
 Drive nice car, wear all green mink 
 Uh, what you payin'? 
 Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink 
 Drive nice car, wear all green mink 
 Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink 
 Drive nice car, wear all green mink
