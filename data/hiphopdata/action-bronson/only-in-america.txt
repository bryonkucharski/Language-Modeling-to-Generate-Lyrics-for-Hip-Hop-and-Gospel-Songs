(Produced by: Oh No) 
 I'm focused, man, I swear I'm focused. These mothafuckas don't know, I'm the mothafuckin' golden child. Uh huh 
 (Verse 1: Action Bronson) 
 Anywhere I go, you know you're goin' with me 
 Bobby and Whitney without the sniffin' 
 Dog your bitch look like Eddie Griffin 
 I'm three wheelin', keep the Chevy tippin' 
 Big bearded Buddha bangin' bitches in Bermuda 
 Barry Bonds, barracuda, Chattanooga 
 Back alley shooter, black Balley booter 
 Catch me jumpin' out the plane like a black puma 
 Stoned, pump Depeche Mode 
 Man all I see is red snow 
 Left my man with a headstone on Edgecombe 
 He was goin' for the glory in the end zone 
 Just another Saaab story cause the pen's cold 
 Am I gonna sell my soul? That depends, ho 
 Man the vehicle's a rental, speak gentle 
 Mink sweatsuit 
 Stab your father while he's pissin' in the men's room 
 (Hook: Party Supplies) 
 Only in America 
 Just can't seem to get you off of my mind 
 Only in America 
 All that seems we're goin' nowhere 
 Only in America 
 And I just can't seem to get you off my mind 
 The best things in life are free 
 All that seems we're goin' nowhere 
 All that seems we're goin' nowhere 
 All that seems we're goin' nowhere 
 Goin' nowhere, nowhere 
 (Verse 2: Action Bronson) 
 NYC what the fuck is goin' on? 
 These mothafuckas won't play my song 
 They sayin' that we soft, they sayin' that we fell off 
 They sayin' that these other fuckers better than us, you gotta be kiddin' 
 A bunch of pussies, when you piss, you gotta be sittin' 
 You tie your hair in a bun and shirt in a knot 
 You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka 
 Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker 
 You and your father never played catch, he taught you how to twerk 
 Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up 
 And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp 
 Shit, light the earth
