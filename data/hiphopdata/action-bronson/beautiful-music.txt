I'm not your normal kind of rap singer 
 In the building where the subtle scent of crack linger 
 Fiends smoking off the foil 
 I only smoke shit from out the soil 
 Virgin oil, the name Bronson, no Arroyo 
 Barbecues get thrown with EBT Cards 
 Land and sea, the air, 3 stars 
 Till gold plates get made right on arrival 
 The Amarone got me spinning like a gyro 
 Take the high road, poppy seeds from Cairo 
 Aaron Rodgers style: I'm here to take the title 
 Rock a Maz Dog cause every word is viral 
 To leave you like a wet noodle, paralyze your spinal 
 (Smoke this motherfucking weed real quick, hold on 
 I'mma get back to you in a minute) 
 "Darling, let me lay besi' 
 Darling, let me lay besi' 
 Darling let me lay beside you 
 Kiss my burning lips about you" 
 Dennis Byrd shit, china doll 
 Leave your fur split, dig your pockets 
 Then she'll kill your earth 
 Even if she's seven days away from giving birth 
 Ruthless, she'll catch you for your leather and your purse 
 Lamb roasting over wood-fire, extend the olive branch 
 Since the 90s I've been rocking hundred-dollar pants 
 Fifty-dollar drugs linger in my sock 
 Put the lighter to the plastic, that's the sealant for the top 
 'Cause we coming from the heights, you know I copped the Puto 
 Tried to put it in the pussy, slid it in the culo 
 Damn, that's the wrong route 
 Now I gotta knee her in the stomach so it falls out 
 Take a deep breath 
 Ancient knowledge like the crocs up in the Nile 
 Alabaster tiles in the kitchen 'cause I'm wyling 
 Tryna cop a chain that say you styling 
 Only chain of interest in the water made of Valens 
 Yeah 
 "Darling, let me lay besi' 
 Darling, let me lay besi' 
 Darling let me lay beside you 
 Kiss my burning lips about you" 
 Wild world that we living in 
 I smoke drug got the subtle hint a cinnamon 
 My mind twisted from the Absinthe 
 You can thank Flushing for my accent 
 So much more than rapping 
 You fucking with the captain 
 Action Jeter 
 Salmon on the cedar 
 You ain't do the job, and then they calling a reliever 
 Me, Dennis Eckersley 
 Rhyme flavor like my grandma's book of recipes 
 I'm 'bout that equity 
 Large stocks, a palm Glock, bomb box 
 Long beards, knee draped in sports drop 
 Loafer pressing on the pedal 
 Extra heavy doggie cause my leg is made of metal 
 Often tangle with the devil 
 Shapeshifter, shaking with strange hands 
 Bronsolini fresher than Maine clams 
 Making money every day, it's been the motherfucking game plan 
 Remain tan during the winter laid in beige sand
