And when I find out who did it 
 It won't be quick and quiet like it was with you 
 It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill 
 And when his eyes go dead the hell 
 I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him 
 Yo, time on my hands 
 Running fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
 Hit the Jackie Rob 
 Cop the Hershey 
 Spark the bark for the ride back to the Galaxy 
 Back, back, down, forward, kick 
 That's a fatality 
 For Liu Kang, turn to a dragon then a raven 
 Ain't no professor that can fuck with this verbatim 
 Your style is prenatal 
 I got the hand that rock the cradle 
 Fully auto mac under the table 
 Jewish platters, kreplach soups and sable 
 If you ain't stable, don't hang around 'cause I enable 
 Drug use, dick sucks from a fiend 
 Rib eye steaks that still on a bone 
 Me and my team shine 
 Like hologram fishscale right off the Greek coast 
 Toast to greats with bubbles 
 Three states, three cases, no traces 
 I'm the ace to shovels 
 So sick, muthafucka cover face with muzzles (Yeah!) 
 Flushing, Queens, twenty seven years strong 
 Where you think you're gonna run to when the tears gone 
 And reality set just like the sun do 
 Ain't trying to have my babies raised up in the slum, true! 
 And when I find out who did it 
 It won't be quick and quiet like it was with you 
 It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill 
 And when his eyes go dead the hell 
 I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him 
 C'mon, you son of a bitch 
 Damn, he's slick 
 No love for snitch niggas trying to serenade the precinct 
 Singing about granulated onions that ain't used for seasoning 
 My mind is off, this life gave me a different type of reasoning 
 I'm so New York that I could rep it from a different region 
 Slay heffers, Ottomanelli's got 'em in telly's 
 We eat good, Turkish cuisine, Ottoman belly's 
 We sit in whips and our whips sit on Pirelli's 
 While we're getting dick sucks, my whole team is Akinyele's 
 Put in their mouth, let 'em give 'em second chances 
 I'm known for finger banging bitches giving table dances 
 Open my flip book, see me posted in the sickest stances 
 Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances 
 Red snapper, taken apart, put back together 
 Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!) 
 Same routine, another day, a new endeavor 
 I usually rock a power piece under a Polo leather 
 I write left, think right, need the box tight 
 Mind blowing dome 'cause I always eat the box right 
 Make believers out of haters, haters out of homies 
 Bring my fam to the top so I ain't lonely 
 I'm with the team, cuisine like we celebrating 
 Contemplate the takeover when we delegating 
 Get it shaking like a dancer at Perfections 
 Catch us in a European coupe, it's never rented, kid 
 Been getting it, circle full of amateurs 
 See great rappers smoking seeded up cannabis 
 Fucking embarrassment, we cooler than a Vick's rub 
 You the type to trick it all night at a strip club 
 I'm the type to bag a stripper out front 
 Take her back, line a twenty up and get my shit sucked (Yeah!) 
 That's what you do when you flyer than Goldblum 
 Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school 
 I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop 
 Same reason I don't fuck with the cops 
 My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not 
 I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots 
 We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine 
 And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time 
 I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime 
 That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime 
 Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting lead off 
 Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off 
 Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off 
 D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off 
 I'm like a cross between Stoudemire and Carmelo 
 Half these New York whack rappers are soft as Jell-O 
 Since a little nigga, always been a fly fellow 
 Went from dark brown skin into a high yellow
