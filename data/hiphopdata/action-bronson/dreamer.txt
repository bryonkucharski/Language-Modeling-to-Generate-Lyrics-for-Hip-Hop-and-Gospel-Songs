Ayo, my headbands filled with acid, out of body 
 Mind trick, mind sick like Magic Johnson's dick 
 You know your shorty lettin' Bronson hit 
 Stuff penis down the neck like it's lozenges 
 Two bags of drug sleep, 'bout to wake 'em up, though 
 Stay sharp, cut quarts with the cutthroats 
 Don't snort, use gloves when you cut dope 
 Won't stop, eat box on a plush boat 
 The brougham, forest green with peanut butter 
 Jelly belly, fuckin' in a smelly telly 
 African room, drugs up in the nightstand 
 Look in my eyes, "Daddy, make the light dance!" 
 Nice pants, cut off at the knee 
 Cuttlefish, cut up on the beach, out the sea 
 Mix it with the lime juice, smidgen of its own ink 
 (Ah, the beat cut out)
