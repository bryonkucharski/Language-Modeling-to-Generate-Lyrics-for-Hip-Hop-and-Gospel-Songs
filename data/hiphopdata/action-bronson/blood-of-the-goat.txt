[Hook - Action Bronson and Big Twin] x2 
 Grimy cats, keep 'em out of my peripheral 
 Caught you snitchin' too, dog I'm liftin' you 
 Off your feet like my daughter at the park 
 Don't cross the border 'cause it's slaughter after dark 
 (Verse 1 - Action Bronson) 
 My life is inches from death, smoke a spliff on the step 
 When my shorty see the cops the drugs she boof in a sec 
 Ain't no games played this real life, we struggle and fight 
 Early morning with the money, we don't hustle at night 
 Aim my arm out the window, then I rock you to bed 
 One shot will knock the carpet off the top of your head 
 Catch the shark, skin the shark, hang the shark in the shed 
 Everything dinner got the marvelous spread, you feel me 
 Dabble in truffles, Sauvignon Blancs, simmer the mussels 
 Nothing ever ripped from my neck during a tussle 
 I'm Bolo Yeung, I'm Lecter with the muzzle 
 Injector of the deck of placin' sectors in the puzzle 
 Roses growin' from the cracks in the concrete 
 Palm Beach, palm trees shining like diamantes 
 Well step aside because you're playin' yourself 
 I'm gettin' money while you stay on the shelf, just like a statuette 
 (Verse 2 - Sean Price) 
 When Ben Chavis submitted to the will of Allah 
 I gun-butted your grill, in Deville/the Ville with your mom 
 Sean, all praise is due to 
 The best rapper the rest of you rappers are doodoo 
 Got a way with distributin' bars 
 Inquisitive gibberish nigga the Wizard of Oz, P! 
 Nobody can rap better than 
 S-E-A-N P, fuck it I'm letterman 
 Kevin Madison flow 
 Have your motherfuckin brethren mad at the flow 
 Don't be mad at him pa 
 Unbreakable flow, adamantium bars 
 I am a fuckin' superhero 
 Top 5 dead or alive you just a stupid zero 
 I am the best rapper out 
 Best rapper, sket clapper in the mouth 
 Shut the fuck up
