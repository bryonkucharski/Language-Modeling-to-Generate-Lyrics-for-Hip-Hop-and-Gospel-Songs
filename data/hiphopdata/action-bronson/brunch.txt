(Know you broke my heart woman) 
 (When you said goodbye to me) 
 You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break North 
 Before you six South and I'll be sitting in that big house 
 Just let me sharpen my knives, thrown on the apron 
 X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon 
 And bleu cheese, caramel complexion's on two knees 
 Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs 
 I'm Rick the Model, Martel to cartel 
 Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells 
 No more child's play kid you with the big boys 
 Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce 
 My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury 
 Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases 
 That'll bribe a jury, grind the curry never shine the jewelry 
 Pussy like an eighty-six style, you know it's fine and furry 
 Spark the bark in the park, you know, lumberyard 
 You ain't never in the limelight, undercard 
 Bronsonelli in the sky, thunder rod 
 Commandante of this rap shit, your facade, killer 
 (Know you broke my heart woman) 
 (When you said goodbye to me) 
 You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break North 
 Before you six South and I'll be sitting in that big house 
 The second stanza even deadly than the first 
 From the birth, I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth 
 That's soon road to a valley that feeds, civilization 
 I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from 
 My bad, I'll keep it fifth grade, keep the switchblade 
 Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade 
 First day class, the Agassis are black and white 
 My older cousin puffing clot bitch, pass the pipe 
 Now I'm a certified user, more like abuser 
 Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the Yakuza 
 I'm Sanders whether Deion or Barry, find candy 
 Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere 
 My team we work as a unit, nobody hide the ball up 
 Great intuition and vision, no time to hit the mall up 
 Just a taste of the life like a September call up 
 Johnnie Walker in our tour cup, getting torn up 
 Listen, I'm steel fisted with the iron lung 
 Heavy metal balance out the guitar with lion's run 
 Praise the son that can stand on his own two 
 Smoke on the big blunt, take a sip of this home-brew 
 (Know you broke my heart woman) 
 (When you said goodbye to me) 
 You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break North 
 Before you six South and I'll be sitting in that big house
