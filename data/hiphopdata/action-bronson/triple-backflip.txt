(Verse 1: Action Bronson) 
 Peel the top off the can of Pellegrino 
 Lost my money at the tables, but I got it back in Cee-lo 
 I'm trying to have the bank account with all the Zero's 
 Rolling Camaros, Jose Canseco was my hero 
 Swing the bat like I swing the 'Lac 
 Snap my fingers and they bring the crab 
 Wave my hand and they bring the bag 
 For your body motherfucker cause you old news 
 And then you see me fucking skip away in boat shoes 
 Ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri- rip your dick off 
 Ah uh! Motherfucker I'm a sicko 
 Fucko, amethyst on the knuckle 
 On the arm, something Spanish with a bubble 
 (Hook: Action Bronson) 
 Uh, it's big trouble in Little China 
 All of the china hidden inside of a big vergina 
 Uh, I'll pile drive her through the bed 
 Hit the strip, get my motherfucking bread, don't you say a word, bitch 
 I need the gators just to match the vest 
 Have my apprentice put the stainless to a bastard's chest 
 Come out the sweatsuit 
 Do a triple back flip into the red coupe 
 Skrrrt, we out 
 Come... hold my dick while I take a piss 
 Shake it off, put it back in my boxer shorts 
 Ride in the drop top lobster Porsche 
 Inside the joint I got some pasta sauce 
 Uh, stalking the street, just to put the fork in the beef 
 Coffins are cheap, seats are very soft in the Jeep 
 The lights hit me at the club, my skin was like a chicken 
 And now my leather to the ankle by my Pippen 
 This feels crazy and I hoping I don't blow it 
 That goes to show I'm still a human under all this glow 
 Needless to say I'm exceeding while you pussies bleeding 
 I guess your weight was not in season 
 Breezing
