Exhale the fucking essence 
 Absorb me 
 Peace to Lonnie Londell 
 Everything is Mar-vel 
 Kid, on this side we shine like the sun 
 Though the night brisk on the night shift 
 Peep the tight lips 
 Cause muthafucking loyalty is priceless 
 Fly bitch blow me harder than a vuvuzelo 
 My mood is mellow 
 Catch me hopping out the Cougar, yellow 
 Brew the Bustelo, Brosonlino 
 Smooth as Othello in convertible Z3's bruising the pedal 
 Chief of command, it's hard for you to try to see me 
 Your team ain't ready to win a war like Mussolini 
 Harsh as a Russian winter 
 Still we dining at Lupa right there on Bleecker and Thompson 
 Eating a custom dinner 
 Wine served, about a third of the glass filled 
 Premium rap skills, lounging in the Catskills 
 Let me end this with a kiss from my bitch 
 One love, Bronsonlino, signing off 
 Who better than this, kid? 
 Luxury sports apparel is what I rock to cover feet 
 I feel like everyday is Thanksgiving 
 That's how we usually eat 
 Rep the street, my flow is heat 
 Queens made me complete 
 When we outside deep 
 It's like a Double L retreat 
 You know my status, everything's Mar-vel 
 Hard shell shots will tear you up 
 Now you scar well 
 Bizarre hell, I'll take you there 
 Never fear nothing, not me 
 Shellfish specialist, I'll eat it if it's from the sea 
 Action Bronson is in the building 
 So it smells like half a key 
 He's usually smoking marijuana in a jacket past his knee 
 Yeah, we live this, still crispest 
 Back to business, fuck bitches 
 Most of y'all were living blind until I hit the light switches 
 Peace to my dress code and my way of life 
 Super trife, slay your wife 
 Ask about the way Lauren can lay the pipe 
 Never duplicated, wordplay is custom made 
 Niggas know my steez 
 Catch me in Queens covered in suede (word up!) 
 The fine fabric delegates 
 And Peter Pan Posse 
 This the finale, Youtube is where the fans watch me 
 High definition, Lo religion 
 Loving Scottie Pippen's 
 Switched it from Jordan Dream Team 
 It hurt the slutty women 
 Love to collab, I used to dabble in a couple of things 
 Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Men's will be 
 Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery 
 We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies 
 I might party like a rock star for a couple of days 
 A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K 
 I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack 
 Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass 
 They call me Shaz, before it was my government 
 Unholy covenant, could never get enough of it 
 So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half 
 And don't get left behind to choke on my gas 
 Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact 
 Prime king in the booth 
 I got it like that 
 But wait, audible react 
 Don't get caught in the trap 
 Real recognize real 
 And see it's part of the act 
 I break hearts, surround sound 
 With the sermon I spit 
 And leave behind a trail of permanent drips 
 In a room full of douchebags burning their lips 
 And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix 
 The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch 
 Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko 
 I'll give you something to fix, get sober 
 You'll understand when you're older 
 The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner 
 Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder 
 So, give me room so my set can breathe 
 I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens 
 So how you want it? 
 Bent, skeed or straight blunted 
 My rap good like Deer Park in your stomach 
 Incredible Hulk, flash the villainous smile 
 He trying to stay young, he's never going out of style 
 Fresh to death like the corpse out the morgue 
 The new slang stay stiff, pause 
 No shirt when he record 
 Stay zoned, known to kick rap through payphones 
 Mighty Healthy set the tones 
 Spread the wealth through fly poems 
 Well known rap flesh 
 Keep it tight like close homies 
 And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody 
 Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach 
 Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street 
 Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto 
 @Toechamp, twitter game you should follow 
 US Weekly with the centerfold 
 A thousand tapes pressed up 
 A thousand tapes sold 
 Kids screaming out, "when the mixtape coming?" 
 Streets is fiend out, yo, they really need something 
 Understood, no matter what 
 Shine like the sun 
 Remember one thing 
 ? Rap and number one
