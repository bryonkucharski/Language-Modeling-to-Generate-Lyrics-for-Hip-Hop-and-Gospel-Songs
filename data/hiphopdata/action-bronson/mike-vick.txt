When you down the people kick you 
 When you up the bitches lick you 
 Chill dogs, don't wanna have to Michael Vick you 
 Stash the work inside the asshole of a pit bull 
 This getting money shit is simple 
 I got my hand like Mike Jack's glove, lungs filled with bud 
 Gold bullets in the snub, old and Jewish on the rug 
 Young and Spanish on my bitch, quick to vanish on the pricks 
 In the drop six cockpit, hammers getting lift 
 Bite beef that was aged inside the basement 
 Smoke a floral arrangement baby I'm dangerous 
 The silver soup spoon is gracious 
 Place it on your tongue and taste it 
 Numb your face like the bass did 
 Cash we slidin' in, they always call me safe kid 
 Lou Brock, blue drop like a spaceship 
 Who's hot, you not, you just basic 
 Lace you up just like my favorite pair of Asics 
 Winter time switch the climate warmer 
 Also change the type of music that I'm rhyming over 
 My bitch thick like John Lovitz 
 Pure virgin blooded blonds with the guard covers 
 It got me rhyming in French 
 Long removed from climbing the fence 
 Dipping cops, getting high on the bench 
 Iron defense, briefcase handcuffed, stand up 
 M-5 flying like a tan duck 
 Tandoori half-moons in my haircut 
 Serving work to Danny Tanner 
 Smooth percussion, coke inside the pans just like a muffin 
 Enjoying puffing at the luncheon, shit 
 Behind the back pass Arvydas Sabonis 
 Rare intelligence you know I'm smoking weed in diplomas 
 Catch a case, post bail, then I flee to Tacoma 
 Come back, new face, 103 and Corona 
 Jackson Heights plastic surgery 
 Colombian rooftop, botch attempts at the burglary 
 Got my eyes open certainly 
 Allow me to go exotic on the curtains G
