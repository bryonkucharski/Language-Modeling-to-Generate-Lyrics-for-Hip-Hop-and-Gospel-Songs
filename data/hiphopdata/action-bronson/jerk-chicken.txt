From the Colosseum Block to the Island, "What the blood clot?" 
 Stay designing, always wiling, and we puff pot 
 Queens to Brooklyn, no lies, give 'em 'nought shot 
 Chicken been getting jerked before your little nuts dropped 
 You know the mantra, Tyson in El Fonta? 
 The i-tal jockey keep me fucking like a monsta' 
 Her landing strip is red like hair that's on Tatanka 
 I'm steady diving in chocolate like Willy Wonka 
 I take a knee and shoot a duck in the air 
 Five minutes, I'm making stuffing filled with truffles and pears 
 I'm lapping "Go," while you only move a couple of squares 
 But still take out some time to do some drugs in the stairs 
 "Freeze! Lay on your stomach," what the popo said 
 My team selling the patties, getting cocoa bread 
 Babylon, them have to catch me, burn up on the irie! 
 Never die, I'ma give it to you my way! 
 Yo, peace to the chicken spot, peace to patty spot 
 Peace to the types of spot that Veggie Castle dready spot 
 The dollar van, the Wallabe and Reggie spot 
 And if a coward wanna rump I give him seven shots 
 (Y'all won't test we?) I'm in the corner puffing Marley 
 Got the knife inside the booth, hoping they don't shoot 
 'Cause I don't want to hurt nobody, ow 
 (Y'all won't test we?) I'm in the corner puffing Marley 
 Got the knife inside the booth, hoping they don't shoot 
 'Cause I don't want to hurt nobody, ow 
 Ay, ya no wan' rump with the senior 
 Who lean like he mixed Jamaican rum and tequila 
 Trail a load of hoes from Kingston and Montego 
 Keep dick hard like Rottweiler Mandingo 
 Bob Marley ganja, stuffed up in the fanta 
 Pass dutchie towards San Fransisco 
 Where your nephew bout to bounty kill a punaani 
 Hoes know the movado! 
 Lick a shot for (Windsweep?) 
 I am living dangerously, Beretta 
 Leafy make the girl wine like Beenie "Sim Simma" 
 Keys to my new bitch bimma, her name Serena 
 Rastafarian reefer got me feeling so irie, tranquil and leisure 
 Berry salmon and jerk chicken 
 Oxtail, gravy on white rice and fried plantain
