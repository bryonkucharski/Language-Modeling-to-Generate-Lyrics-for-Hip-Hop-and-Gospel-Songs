 (Verse 1: Action Bronson (Chauncey Sherod)) 
 On this dark old road, tryna find my way 
 I'm sick and I'm tired of games people play 
 (Singing I'm tired of games people play) 
 No 808, I'm barely standing 
 That ain't for dealing, that girl in your hand (girl in your hand) 
 Now I got no soul, it was taken a long time ago 
 (It was taken a long time ago) 
 I've given my life to a stranger, that sleeps by my side at night 
 Look in her eyes, I see danger, and man is this shinning bright 
 (Bridge: Action Bronson) 
 She won't think twice, to hurt me 
 She won't think twice, to hurt me 
 She won't think twice 
 She won't think twice 
 (Hook: Action Bronson) 
 She only wants money my money 
 She only wants money my money 
 She only wants money from me, love from somebody else 
 She only wants money from me, love from somebody else
