Yo drop to the ground and one knee me if you see me 
 Take off your top like ZZ 
 Mushrooms by himself causes shown to give samples of the body 
 That I demolished you novice I'm polished 
 Dip in impala quick 
 Ah motherfucker your only kinda sick 
 I'm fully blown like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia 
 I'm out for self-ia, Bronson not helpin' ya 
 Trying to get the Lexus ah oysters for breakfast ah 
 I'm still in queens that's my native land 
 I sport a headdress baby veil on the headrest 
 Bitch 
 Buscemi frame by my favorite chair 
 Asian hair on a Dominican with Cajun flare 
 I keep the coke clean, father and son dope fiends 
 Mother and daughter strippers sniffing all the codeine 
 Affliction shirts and dress paints like I'm Oakley 
 Three bitches waiting for me Toyki oh shit 
 Roll whip, panamera rough 
 Salamander tux, fucking Alabama Butts 
 Ah we known to gallivant in trucks 
 With an Irish bitch that will put a fucking hammer to your nuts 
 Compose a fly rap with an 18 karat meisterstuck 
 My people like to shoot 
 Bronsolino dice the fluke 
 Phenomenal fish platters 
 Plus everyday is turkey day 
 My vision is clear so now we getting it the murky way 
 Pillaging daily plus we give thanks and fill tanks with premium 
 Cadillac's my people always steaming them 
 Turn the car into a sauna with some marijuana 
 If you know Bronsolino then you know that's his persona 
 Slang school PHd holders in the building 
 Far from elementary but we do this for the children 
 Ready able and willing 
 Dealing constantly building 
 Seen niggas make a million standing outside they building 
 I'm from New York home of the hustle 
 Where skinny people move big 'cause chrome is the muscle 
 Just to get a rep you get left with a darker past 
 You just a little sick my fucking flow is Arthur Ashe
