As I step in the door, you in your bathrobe 
 Pour you a little more wine, I see your glass low 
 Scared of a real man, from dealing with these assholes 
 Just drink ya wine and then will step up in the bath, slow 
 Soak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch 
 Light the candle, and I'ma light another Dutch 
 Then we slip into a place that's only you & me 
 Put it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea 
 You too young to be locked down, truancy 
 Always got ya hair down, rockin' your jewelry 
 Killing these other bitches, word, reading their eulogy' 
 Hips insane 
 The pussy? Foolery 
 At the end of the day baby it's you and me 
 At the end of the day honey it's you and me 
 Just you and me
