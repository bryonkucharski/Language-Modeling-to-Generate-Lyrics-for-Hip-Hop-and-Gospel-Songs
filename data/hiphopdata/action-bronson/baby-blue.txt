Action Bronson: 
 Why you always all on my back? 
 Why you gotta do me like that? 
 Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you? 
 Baby girl I'm blue 
 Because you treat me like shit 
 I paid for the bed and never even slept in it 
 I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in 
 And now somebody else is eating all the pudding 
 Things change, now my dashboard wooden 
 All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden 
 Dark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy 
 Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby 
 All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short 
 Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing 
 Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians 
 There were times I used to hide my feelings 
 Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini 
 And motherfuckers can't see me 
 Wait till this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy 
 Who would've thought I hit you right back? 
 Why you always all on my back? 
 Why you gotta do me like that? 
 Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you? 
 Baby girl I'm blue 
 So many women wanna call me baby 
 And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately 
 Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh 
 Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath 
 Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me 
 And you could order whatever 
 The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce 
 You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next 
 And I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular 
 I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera 
 As Bocelli sings the celly rings 
 I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king 
 I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is 
 I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous 
 Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish 
 Why you always all on my back? 
 Why you gotta do me like that? 
 Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you? 
 Baby girl I'm blue 
 Chance the Rapper: 
 I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue 
 From a razor in a paper cup 
 I hope every soda you drink already shaken up 
 I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun 
 I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's 
 I hope there's always snow in your driveway 
 I hope you never get off Fridays 
 And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays 
 I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket 
 I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen 
 I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck 
 And your headphones short, and your charger don't work 
 And you spill shit on your shirt 
 I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face 
 Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade 
 I hope you happy, I hope you happy 
 I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy, igh!
