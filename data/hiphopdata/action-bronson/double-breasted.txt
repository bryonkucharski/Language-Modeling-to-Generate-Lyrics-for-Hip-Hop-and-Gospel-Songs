Respected blends 
 Hopping out the 87 Benz 
 No pendent 
 Plus I've always been defendant 
 Never Plaintiff 
 Shorty crying at arraignment 
 This Jamie Lee Blue Steel what I'm aimin' 
 Queens to the death 
 Lean to the left 
 Walk in the kitchen? Meet and greets with the chef 
 I'm like a baby 'cause I sleep on the breast 
 But still fuck around throw the heat to your chest 
 Million dollar raps, million dollar beats 
 Five dollar dimes 
 Young Harvard minds 
 Yale in the spring 
 Bali in the summer 
 See me through the window like Batali in the Hummer 
 Sharp at the feet 
 Morimoto knife set 
 Young Cordell coming through the portal 
 Terry Gene Boli motherfuckers are immortal 
 You in the corner looking floral 
 The New Yorker 
 Heavy body smooth talker 
 Stand in the foyer 
 Portraits of my yiddish lawyer 
 British walker 
 Presence like I'm Connery 
 You wanna die well swing 
 Knees like Olden Polynice 
 My shorty Polynesian don't make no apologies 
 I'm when I'm rich I'll probably join the Scientology 
 Three hookers 
 Street gynecology 
 Edward Scissors my existence is anomaly 
 Smoke the chronic, chronically 
 Bronson Chronicles 
 You ain't really fucking with me honestly 
 Sonically we fuckin' boom shit 
 Just be smooth kid or catch a fucking raping with the broom stick
