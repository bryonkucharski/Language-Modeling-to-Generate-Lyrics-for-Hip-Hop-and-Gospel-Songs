Action Bronson: "What was that one you were telling me about the other evening, you were singin' about the sister in the street gang?" 
 L.E.S Ezra : "Uh you're talkin' about... damn... say some words that I... I got so much shit." 
 Bronson: "...Lost in the street life..." 
 L.E.S. Ezra: I'm lookin' for this lady 
 Bronson: 
 (There you go, there you go!) 
 L.E.S. Ezra: 
 She's special to me 
 So if by chance you see her 
 Won't you hit me on the hip, will you please? 
 I went to Red Cross and I went to the station 
 I looked up missing persons 
 And I found out that she wasn't there 
 Did she find, did she find 
 Did she find someone new? 
 Is it true? 
 Did she find, did she find 
 DId she find someone new? 
 I hope it's not true 
 My sister came over with no smile on her face 
 She said, "You better sit down" 
 It's gonna hurt, what she has to say 
 "That baby's not yours, she belongs to the streets 
 Where gangsters and hustlers 
 Where they meet on 125C 
 She can never be yours, a housewife. you see 
 She belongs to the ghetto, my friend 
 She doesn't belong to you or me" 
 Did she find, did she find... 
 L.E.S. Ezra: "Let me tell you something about that song. It could go two ways. It could be about drugs, and it could be about a woman."
