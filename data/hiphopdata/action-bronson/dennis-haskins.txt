All my bitches adore me 
 No more visits to Maury 
 Only visits to where the shore be 
 Fuck having a shorty 
 I'm on tour, I need my dick milked 
 Blow my nose in patterns woven into thick silk 
 Ah shit motherfucker man I been ill 
 Spin wheel my favorite disc consists of thin veal 
 Mmm daddy look good, that's what your bitch feel 
 Then spread her thighs wide open for a kid's meal (fish) 
 What a bitch, here's the twist 
 What I twist'll make a normal human twitch 
 Catch me in the Saab like Mitch 
 Pitch left-handed with the chip wrist 
 Bring Mr. Belding out, that means you gettin' dismissed 
 Cancelled, flicks with mickey on the mantle 
 Flicks with Yogi Berra lifted in some sandals 
 Smoke the wax like a candle 
 It be that shit you can't handle 
 Look just like doodoo in the pamper 
 Like when my son drinks too much apple juice, loose 
 When he was four he got his dick sucked by a prostitute 
 Right in the pasta chute 
 A piece of knife, a little gun hang out the mobster's booth 
 We gettin' lots of loot 
 I lift him off his feet, cop a Porsche for cheap 
 Fuck around, you'll be layin' in the coffin sleep 
 At the large round table where the bosses meet 
 Come correct motherfucker you know that talk is cheap 
 Lift him off his feet, drop a Porsche or Jeep 
 Fuck around, you'll be layin' in the coffin sleep 
 At the large round table where the bosses meet 
 Come correct motherfucker you know that talk is cheap
