Do me a favor, with that, light the candle 
 Is that the Hawaiian Rayman? 
 Aight I get the same one every single time, I don't understand this 
 At the piano with a glass of pino 
 All red silk like I'm nino 
 Custom made shit, I weight 140 kilos 
 Sneeze on 100G's, hoes on their knees blow from Montego 
 The way my hair look you swear my name was Rodrigo 
 Lay low, if you can't do it then just say no 
 If you ain't built to play this game then you get halo'd 
 I put a lot of fiends in k-holes

 Hello 
 Hi 
 What's up mama? 
 I just watched *boing* perform 
 How do you feel about it? 
 They ain't you baby hahaha, you're better than all these shit heads 
 I'm just a bastard with a bad habit 
 Bad back in a black Volkswagen Rabbit 
 Shit I gotta have it 
 Black magic woman put a spell on me 
 Fuck around and win a spelling bee 
 I could walk under ladders, still win the lotto 
 Ten minutes flat, built a boat in a bottle 
 Roy Rogers bathroom, sniffin' coke with a model 
 Told her to Google me, shit I might paint the Cougar green 
 All this lechuga in my jeans 
 I still see Freddy Kruger in my dreams 
 Ain't nothin' moving but the cream 
 Shit, know I do it for team 
 (Skit 2) 
 I just wanna hear 'em announce your name, that's all I care about 
 How's your knee? 
 My knee is... It's not bad these past few days 
 You been all right? 
 That's all I care about 
 Took a meeting up at Paramount 
 Typecast as a romantic lead 
 I'm classically trained for drug dealing 
 But I wasn't good at drug dealing 
 So I flipped shit, rug, ceiling 
 Dry water, five daughters all stood 5'4" 
 Or got 5 quarters for the store 
 Fuck knows what I'm saying anymore mane, my mind is shot, been working so motherfuckin' hard 
 So I'm bout to light this motherfuckin' dab up 
 Till the next time, peace
