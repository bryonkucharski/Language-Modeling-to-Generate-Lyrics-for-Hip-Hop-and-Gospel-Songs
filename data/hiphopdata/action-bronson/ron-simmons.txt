Gipsy Salami cheese is from the cave 
 Wild dandelion greens dressed up on the plate 
 Parmesan crisp, we wildin' in marea 
 Doing all the drugs off of Pico and Labrea 
 Peace to Kings English, sticky green fingers 
 Brock Fetch Polaroids 
 Bitches named Dinga 
 Cunnilingus, Buddy Holly singing 
 Hash between my butt cheeks, hookers in the plush suite 
 Whole grain mustard, 12 grain bread 
 Move cocaine out of Spokane, I got no shame 
 Spit the propane, relive you of your gold chain 
 Go to bed without even knowing the hoes name 
 Hazelnut spread, banana on your bread 
 Treat you like a shark, put the hammer on your head 
 Mock neck sweaters, I pack up on the threads 
 Fat black leathers leave your body in the shed 
 Damn 
 Ron Simmons 
 Peace to motherfucking Iceland 
 Ron Simmons 
 Ron Simmons 
 Ron, Ron Simmons 
 Ron Simmons 
 Damn, your fucking with a pro kid 
 No triple A I went straight up to the show, kid 
 While You can catch me out in Spain on the coast, dick 
 Don't ever say my fucking music sound like Ghost shit 
 Born alone, stood strong for half a fifty 
 Vocal reminiscing of a kid that hold a semi 
 Old and sweaty, motherfucker shit the bed 
 They crying in the corner while there shorty give me head 
 Yeah, ice sculptures, Venezuelan white vultures 
 Chinese wizardry, long capes 
 Old grapes in the glasses she suck me while I'm flaccid 
 Every summer catch me grilling steaks by Lake Placid 
 Dabbled in plastic, don't ever babble or get blasted 
 Bitches ass to ass, double dildos made of plastic 
 Remain classic with all this flash inside the pan shit 
 Like Jr. Griffey smashing homers, never land bitch 
 Damn, we never land bitch 
 Yeah, we never land bitch 
 Kinda high, never land bitch 
 But you can see me in lambish 
 Damn
