(Produced By: Party Supplies) 
 (Verse: Action Bronson) 
 Sittin' first class, feelin' like shit though 
 Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo 
 Thinkin' if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground? 
 Fuck that, I want the crown off anybody head 
 I wouldn't care if everybody's dead 
 It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed 
 Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons 
 My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my Smith and Wesson 
 Shit, I made this out of nothin' 
 Damn, these ladies love me out in London 
 Laurenivici served the granulated onion 
 My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon 
 Dog, what the fuck is with your mother? 
 She got one leg longer than the other 
 One eye through the shutter 
 Made the transition from weed to butter, like spring to summer 
 (Hook: Action Bronson and Black Atlass) 
 I nearly lost my mind 
 All a motherfucker got is time, time, time 
 Time, time 
 I nearly lost my brain 
 Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad 
 So bad, I'm so glad
