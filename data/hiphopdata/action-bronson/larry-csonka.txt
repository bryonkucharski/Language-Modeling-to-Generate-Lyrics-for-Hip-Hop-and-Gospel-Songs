Bronsolino 
 Fuck that sitting-down rap type shit, man 
 I stand up, 'cause I'm a motherfucking man 
 And I'm motherfucking hot 
 Peep it 
 I'm on the third floor, your class was in the basement 
 You know what that means; you got a hint of retardation 
 Well, me too, I'm fully-blown just like the flow, though 
 Spit the silky shit that's ankle-length like a kimono 
 Uh, sharp instruments to rock like a fossil 
 Shotty for the haters, that's trimmed off at the nostrils 
 Well, me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel 
 Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco 
 Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it 
 I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though 
 'Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito 
 Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual 
 Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by 
 I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die 
 Green DeVille, right, green drugs, but hold the serum 
 Rub the things together, then you clear 'em, flatline 
 The prosciutto, olives from Tunisia 
 Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver 
 And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer 
 The night creeper 
 I love the pussy really tight, that's with a light Caesar 
 Can it be that I'm the Golden Child, the chosen one 
 The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run 
 Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun 
 Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son 
 Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade 
 I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid 
 Yo, take a taste of my nuts 
 Know they sweet just like the candy 
 Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me? 
 I built this building, they came and then I conquered 
 Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde 
 Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name 
 I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain 
 Killer Queens is on the rise, so understand me 
 Ain't never stoppin' till there's a Grammy in a room for my family 
 Also known as a den 
 Post and toast with Lauren 
 Posing for pictures, kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm 
 Uh, let me take a little break fam' 
 I'm fucking straight out of surgery, man 
 I need a little break 
 When I come back in, I'mma come back in hard, though 
 I promise you that 
 (Look at my motherfucking shoulders, son) 
 Yo, I'm diving in like Louganis 
 I'm aiming right for that anus 
 Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis 
 Peace to Shaevitz and Shaevitz 
 My rhymes are seasoned for flavor 
 Fuck with shorties that's in shape, they got the V like they're Vader 
 Ah ha, Animal Style, flippin' like a flipjack 
 You heard the cat rap, like animal's fear from a rat, got 
 Ankle length, that's suede, the jacket 
 Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke 
 Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead 
 No one compare to me, lampin' with my tangerine 
 I'm fiend out, so I'm bangin' on the tambourine 
 Yo, bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner 
 And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya 
 Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust 
 My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk 
 Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk 
 Shoe be pointy at the toe, closin' down the show 
 Poison be the flow, got the boysenberry blow 
 Finish on the women 
 That mean the bitch from Finland 
 Her tits are bonkers 
 Chilling in her chanclas 
 Rollers in her hair, I'm running through it, Larry Csonka 
 Bronsolino 
 You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is, man 
 Get the fuck off my wee-wee 
 Pussy
