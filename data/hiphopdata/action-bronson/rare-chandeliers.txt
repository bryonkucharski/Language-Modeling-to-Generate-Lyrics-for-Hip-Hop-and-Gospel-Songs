All I want to do is buy boots, ride coupe, hide loot 
 Uh, flick chives in the soup 
 Stick knives where you poop 
 Back flips off the ledge, hang-glide off the roof 
 Land on one leg, see me all up on the front page 
 Holding a pump gauge, ready to dump, aim 
 At your nuts, like the mouth of a whore 
 Somersault Cadillac on the door 
 I been gorgeous, good friends with the florist 
 Transportin' work in the Sequoia 
 Now the chandeliers inside the foyer, feet wrapped in snake 
 The rug gotta hibernate, jacket tryna find a mate (Sex) 
 Choke a duck, lay it on the plate (Roasted) 
 Snap my fingers for the waiter come and pour the grapes (Toasted) 
 What's the word baby? (Slow motion) 
 Only vision out my home window (All ocean) 
 Suede kicks, shootin' ball at the park (Swish) 
 Thousand on the free throw, you just a Webelow 
 I'm a full-grown human, half my leg covered in Ewings 
 You know a pussy gettin' ruined to the point where it doesn't even work 
 Taz and Bugs Bunny on the shirt 
 Hop up in the Jag and skirt 
 While I show you how the magic work 
 Take a bastard lay him down in dirt 
 Aim at your apple with the archery 
 Chef with the tweezers place the parsley for me 
 Person in the travel car seat's a G 
 I'm gettin' V while you home beatin' meat 
 Can I sense I'm a stud 
 Drink the blood of the snake 
 Burn a fake at the stake 
 Drinkin' grapes with the steak 
 Make a cake for your wake 
 Jamaican dancers on your face rockin' 8's
