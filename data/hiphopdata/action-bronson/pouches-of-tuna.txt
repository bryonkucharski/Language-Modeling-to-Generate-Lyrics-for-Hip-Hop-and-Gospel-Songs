Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano 
 My shawty features like Madonna, I ain't like that one 
 Yo, line for line, straight up lambs on the arm 
 Giambi lenses, Ken Caminiti, Basworth 
 Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano 
 My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer 
 Bending these young Lola Fellanas over, ace the test 
 Baste the breast with the juices 
 Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin 
 Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest 
 Baby girl, you're wylin' if you sniff this 
 You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets 
 Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand 
 Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam' in the can 
 Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos 
 Eating tacos, higher than a opera note 
 We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics 
 It's like avant garde to the critics 
 I throw you in that armbar with the quickness 
 Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list 
 Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily 
 The hard bottoms gators is slippery 
 I just had an epiphany 
 And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously 
 45's fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china 
 Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er 
 I hit the diner, the Carolina 
 Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder 
 Vagina splash like apple cider 
 So fuck your little 2 cents blue Benz bitches jump like Harold Miner 
 I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner 
 And I escape like MacGyver 
 Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler 
 And lay up with a case of vodka 
 Get cake and prosper 
 Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra 
 Air you out, leave your face for pasta 
 Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster 
 Beige fox, 88 Clarks 
 Ladies identify gangsters' posture 
 I'm feeling like J Hoffa 
 Fuck y'all, eat a fat dick with the monster
