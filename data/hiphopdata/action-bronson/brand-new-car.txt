 I got a brand new car 
 I got a jazz guitar 
 Welcome, everybody 
 Thank you a lot for coming, it means a lot to me 
 Steer the yacht with my knee, plenty of botany 
 Damn, bad chick on top of me, pornography 
 And I know she only want me for my guap-ery 
 (Ahem... let me get my voice right 
 Gary, sorry, 1, 2, 3, 4) 
 It's the first time ever 
 Yo fuck this jacket, I turn this shit to 85 napkins 
 Since Jeter's done I'm now the captain 
 Trust you me, Gotham's safer now 
 But there's always a new joker in town 
 Ready to smoke you with that pound 
 But when he shoots it, the flag says "BANG!" and everybody laughs 
 He must be up and off the molly tab 
 I'm by the bar lookin' Swedish in the trenchcoat stupid 
 The only one drinkin' mango lassi in the bullpen 
 My lips are sealed like the singer with bad skin 
 My need for speed made the Jag spin 
 Dog, I'll resurrect Freaky Tah to do my ad-libs 
 Overseas I prolly got mad kids 
 That I don't even know about, you better slow down, baby 
 I'm still young, fuck it, gotta use it while it works 
 Nothin' lasts forever, or does it? Fuck it 
 Shout out to my cousins, all of 'em 
 I'll take it back to playin' handball and smokin' on the park benches 
 Dippin' cabs and hoppin' fences 
 Laughin' all the way back to the buildin' runnin' 
 Got to the door, twist the key, elevator waitin' for me 
 100, got upstairs and fixed eleven bowls of Crispix 
 Grabbed a Snapple out the bin, no one's an even match for the kid 
 Legs are made of stone, the back of a bridge 
 In goal line situations I'll tackle The Fridge 
 Peace to Mike Ditka, 50 on the light fixture 
 Right side shifter, fight fixer, twist your sister 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hair band, mothafucka 
 It's Bam Bam doin' ah ah ah ah 
 Out with the, ah! 
 I can't even get this fuckin' right, are you kidding me? 
 I'm ashamed of myself, I'm sorry
