Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man 
 Surgical procedures 
 Ben Johnson 
 You already know 
 Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon 
 Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam' that left us too soon 
 Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies 
 No English muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies 
 Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee 
 Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse 
 One hand driving, 3 gram smoking 
 2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking 
 Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger 
 Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through 
 Over fishing make the snapper less affordable 
 I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical 
 Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious 
 Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia 
 She grew a bush like a baby plant 
 Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams 
 Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag 
 And then I serve at a private tasting 
 I got no time for wasting 
 Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation 
 And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the bla bla bla bla 
 Fuck, fucked my last word up 'cause I don't give a shit man 
 I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo 
 Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up 
 In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked 
 Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day 
 She said she finally met a... Fuck 
 Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up 
 In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked 
 And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day 
 She said she finally met a man to take her breath away 
 Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely 
 At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli 
 My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me 
 A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely 
 Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor 
 Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo 
 Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor 
 Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo 
 That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed 
 I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June 
 And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting 
 Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted 
 Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted 
 Or take the hand of God but shit I think I'll keep my distance 
 I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it 
 But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet 
 It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it 
 I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me 
 Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips 
 Great white sharks, the .38 with tarnished tip 
 27 years I never met an honest bitch 
 Slice their faces like Kitana and shit 
 Through my nasal blow the smoke 
 Basil on the boat 
 Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants 
 Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind 
 Play the kitchen like a Mexican, next of kin 
 Patrick Swayze, we out!
