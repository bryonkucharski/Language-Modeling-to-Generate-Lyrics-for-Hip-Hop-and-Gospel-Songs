Look baby don't play me, play lotto okay, you gotta try to cum okay 
 I'm a nice girl don't play me out 
 I know it's not everything baby but I'm out here working and I gotta pay up 
 Cindy, she not herself unless she smoking crack 
 7 times she got stabbed in the back 
 By a regular john she dealt with many times before 
 That's what she gets for being a whore though 
 She walked the streets, patent leather mini skirt 
 With the zipper, damn I know her kitty hurt 
 10 hour shifts she thinking' bout retiring 
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I think she lying man 
 She'll suck a Jewish lawyer, or an African cabby 
 "It ain't about the money, tryna get back at my daddy 
 Plus I'm feenin' tryna smoke me some crack in the alley" 
 Grease the cops, found her mouthing off Captain O'Malley 
 Yeah, its Hoookers at the point 
 Bitch, get my motherfucking drink, bitch. Henny 
 Quarter filled, in the fuckin' sniffter don't put it in the rock glass again please 
 You fucking stupid bitch treat you like garbage kick you in ya fuckin' ass 
 Come here bitch, put your breath on my pinky ring bitch 
 Get my motherfucking drink bitch Henny! 
 As I ride inside my 92' Seville 
 Windows half down so I can see my bitches in the field 
 Best believe they bringing daddy money 
 How you think I copped the caddy dummy 
 Tryna get this Puff Daddy money 
 The name silk but all my bitches call me Montel 
 Spit the marvel, with the soft top not the hard shell 
 Three shades of green- suit, hat, and matching lizards 
 8 bitches look like they straight from the Alaskan blizzard 
 Bitch get my money 'fo I kill ya 
 You know the life you chose 
 But know you wanna be a mother 
 The kid will be retarded you can add him to his brother 
 Do the world a favor line your pussy up with rubber 
 Now you done made me spill my henny on my pinky ring 
 My nails are filed 
 Perfect though right you see me shinin' 
 Now get the fuck up out my car and sell ya joint 
 We gettin' luchey this is hookers at the point 
 Bitch 
 Dos en el morning, rocking sweatpants ya know what up 
 Slowly approaching animals in motion 
 Pussy safari, twenty for a lay 
 Ten for a BJ, but free for some free base 
 Before I purchase, I wanna peek at the turkey 
 Make sure that its perky so it won't turn my dick to jerky 
 Open the door, soon as she sat down, she took a bump 
 She caught the rush, then made a hooker grunt 
 Let's talk about me, I'm always on the road 
 Got a little dick, many of the secrets I behold 
 Name is dano born in the Bronx, half Puerto Rican 
 Drive a truck hooked on dope cook a soul 
 Was once a prospect for the twin now I'm on a mission 
 Cryin' naked shootin' dope up in the kitchen 
 Falling asleep right on the shitter 
 Word to Roberto Clemente dog I'm still a hitter, yeah!
