Jungle Rule, can't be no fool 
 Jungle Rule, can't be no fool (I needed a little taste of that) 
 Twisting joints like a contortionist 
 Laid in the Porsche 
 My father driving 
 Days been sunny since I started rhyming 
 No denying me, I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry 
 Nobody high as me 
 Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn 
 At the same time, fellatio from three twins 
 Those are triplets, I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it 
 Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck! 
 On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune 
 Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom 
 Guns drawn like my bath from my lady friend 
 Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz 
 And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here 
 Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair 
 Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case 
 Long as she got big nipples and a tan face 
 Jungle Rule, can't be no fool (Yeah, you're in the concrete right now) 
 Devil is on the loose, no coop 
 Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno 
 I've been husky, motherfuckers couldn't touch me 
 'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly 
 Celebrating 1987, no bubbly 
 Facially, I'm like a young John Kennedy 
 More obscenity, EBT in Genovese 
 Go to Ock, get 70 for 100 
 I want the 75 from Ocky but he fronted 
 Take the money, cop 5 dimes, 2 chicken sandwiches, 9 limes 
 For the Canada Dry, pose for the cameras by the banister, "Hi" 
 In the summer, rock the vest set, Salmon Kani 
 Flex the three-quarter cream Fi's 
 We're summer seam G's, steamed red snapper, Vietnamese 
 Catch a case, get a Jewish lawyer, beat it with cheese 
 Fuck the beef cause it don't go together, read 'em and weep 
 It's very easy, make you disappear now, kid 
 Make your paper, but you need to stay grounded 
 Eyes wide like a chick that got the dick in the butt 
 We're out here, trying to get the money, baby, live it up 
 Talk about me if you please, but I must be Hercules 
 Hercules 
 I must be Hercules!
