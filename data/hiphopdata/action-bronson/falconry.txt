(Produced by The Alchemist) 
 Yo pass me the ball fool 
 You better fuckin' pick me, ya 
 Straight the fuck up, I roof this shit 
 Fuckin' 360 on this pussy 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I'll kick this motherfucking ball over the fence 
 No shoes on 
 (Verse 1 : Action Bronson) 
 I know you see me on the TV, lookin' like a hunk of beef 
 When I smile your baby mama shit her dungarees 
 Somebody get the kid a deal he sound like me 
 But nah, dunny don't get down like me 
 The falcon flies back to the glove when I whistle 
 Don't try to put me in the box like a tissue 
 'Cause I push you in the box with a pink suit 
 Fuck around and have some squid ink soup, bitch 
 (Ah man there's so much fuckin' hash in this joint right now son) 
 Uh, you ain't a legend like Yanni 
 I'm so Queens like a Roy Wilkins T-shirt 
 With one arm shredded, and one arm missing 
 Dog, I was born with Allah's vision 
 I learned quick I couldn't follow suit 
 Cause the Devil put the pork inside the dollar soup 
 Now I'm sittin' in first class with a hard dick 
 Listenin' to German guitar riffs, what a life 
 I was made like the beginning of Jurassic Park 
 When they took the fucking blood from the mosquito with a dope needle 
 Then they shot it in a wild lion, 1983 
 I popped out holdin' an iron with a visor on 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 Yo, the videos are like a Jewish summer camp promo 
 Your ideas lack Adobo 
 (Verse 2 : Meyhem Lauren) 
 Yo, silk cinder blocks, cinnamon socks 
 On the low like a whip without shocks 
 I bag bitches in flocks 
 Representative for everything official 
 Y'all niggas can't live, so it's officially an issue 
 Waterproof penmanship, padded on a rugby 
 Hammer in the hamper 'case a nigga try to thug me 
 I'm a idol, my wave is tidal, forget survival 
 Treat the last record I broke just like a rival 
 Uh, I'm New York before it turned into a bike lane 
 Never had a light fame, split the pipe cane 
 It was written but I wrote it 
 Put religion right on my neck and then I froze it 
 Laurenovitch, yeah 
 (Outro: Big Body Bes) 
 3:36 in the morning 
 Location: a drug infested area, Brooklyn, New York 
 What am I doing? Standing on an unidentified corner 
 With a Latin individual, corn rows, foamposites; 
 All sorts of a felony in his waist 
 But who are you? She only loves me when I'm naked
