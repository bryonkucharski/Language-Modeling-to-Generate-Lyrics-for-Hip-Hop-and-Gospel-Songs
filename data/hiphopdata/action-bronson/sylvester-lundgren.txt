Cash off the top, cash off the top 
 Play with my money motherfucker get shot 
 Weed from the dread that I roll in the fanta 
 Cover on my dick so I won't catch the monster 
 I don't even know myself, I'm twisted 
 This exquisite shit that flip when I rip it 
 Crisp kiddicks, right hand quicker than Riddick's 
 Safe to say that I'm the shit here 
 Red suede shoes, a holiday in Arizona 
 Cocaine knives open up the abalone 
 Smoke the macaroni, eat the cannelloni 
 Put the cameras on me, take the cameras off me 
 Motherfucker raise your hand when you speak 
 Act wild this .45 is gettin' jammed in your cheek 
 Play the hotel room with bitches tossin' my butt 
 Layin' back chillin' blowin' a blunt 
 Motherfucker you 
 Play them sound blocks, tinted, not timid, no gimmick 
 Game of life is trife but due to good advice I'm 'bout to win it 
 Fuck with rap but I still run around the map and still get it 
 Let a nigga violate, I make a visor out his fitted 
 Shoebox spinach, new Glocks finish, my life is real 
 Calm when clocking currency but on the stage we hyper, still 
 I spit for New York where we rep a different type of skill 
 But often plan to kill while listenin' to Cypress Hill 
 My knife is ill, infections get spread through incisions 
 Conquer and divide when we ride, peace to division 
 Shinin' when I'm rhymin' my slang fuck up your vision 
 Missiles leave you layin' missionary if I'm on a mission 
 That's all precision, precise moves change of position 
 Never snitchin', define a mime during an inquisition 
 My team's about to run the world and that's a true prediction 
 Another day, another dollar, and a new affliction 
 You know you picked the wrong niggas to fuck with, you punk bitch 
 Tyson uppercuts, Bruce Lee front kicks 
 I'm Dexter with the blood splatter 
 Have you shakin' in the back seat with JFK, covered in brain matter 
 Everything I talk I walk 
 Crib lookin' like a blackboard, oh shit, flooded with white chalk 
 Heartbeat racin' fast, when I chase yo ass 
 With a Jason mask, pussy boy wave the flag 
 Life ain't savin' that, family draped in black 
 Visit your maker, now you can't make it back 
 One-way ticket to the fire and brimstone 
 My mental's locked up but my physical been home 
 Question our God ask him what do I sin for 
 He said I do wrong cause Eve is my kinfolk 
 Bloodline of a disobedient 
 Mixed with the heart of a butcher, make the coroner ingredients
