(Verse 1 - Action Bronson) 
 Yeah, good hoodie, shorty got the good pussy 
 Sniff coke off a crisp hundred 
 Stay blunted, silk pants, sip France 
 Chicks dance, I stand in the pimp stance 
 West coast, laid back feel the breeze 
 Burnin' trees in diplomas, earn degrees 
 In the winter, mockneck circle ski 
 Wanna party, pop that purpley 
 Oh shit bam bam in the building 
 Scrape the women, hide the children 
 Give a bitch rimshot like a Zildjian 
 Me and Mildred eating like a pilgrim 
 Huh, yo Tommy Lasorda 
 Dodge bullets, dive into the water 
 True lies, diamonds at the porter 
 Shoot like Terry Porter, pimpin' with your Asian daughter 
 I'm always ready for a minor bid 
 Not for long 'cause I need me some vagina, kid 
 Tryna catch strange soup in the silk 
 Well-built with the coupe in the kilt 
 I need some mouth from a woman 
 I couldn't get it, so I took it, though I shouldn't 
 Sick shit like Ferrara with the footage 
 Stick shift in Ferrari, oh my goodness 
 Hood bitch, sweatpants, good tits 
 Fat butt, 97 Acura 
 Big bitch, make me want to tackle her 
 Fuck around Urlacher her 
 Enough of that, I'mma shoot dice, abusin' the wall 
 Till I cruise on the shore, barbecues on the four 
 Mad drugs on the table and I'm doing 'em all 
 And I'm never gon' fall 
 Last time we locked eyes, slapped hands with the kid 
 Now you rambling kid, you should have handled that shit 
 When you see me motherfucker better handle your biz 
 Better handle your biz 
 (Verse 2 - Action Bronson) 
 Put the flame to his sneakers, I'm a pyro 
 Barrel revolutions got us spinning like a gyro 
 The suitcase is filled with filo 
 Here's a side-note 
 Fuck around, leave you on the side road 
 Five stars on the dinner plate 
 Pardon 'em, see me studded like Cardamom 
 Play your part cause you don't really want no part of 'em 
 Take the key out the ignition, shouldn't have started 'em 
 Joints twisted like a sprained foot 
 Red beard, big blue eyes, a strange look 
 It's like I'm chopping down trees 
 Jump out the chopper on skis, maltese 
 I'm stunned by the mountains and the sunrise 
 Stash work in the mattress where your son lies 
 Enter the casket under dirt and the guns cry 
 I'm going out blazing, squeezing at the one time 
 (Verse 3 - Styles P) 
 You ain't a boss, you just playin' boss 
 Pop him in his head, pray on his corpse 
 Knee on his neck and his sternum 
 Askin' for forgiveness, when I'm done I'mma burn him 
 You dancin' with the demons 
 I know you see the European leanin' 
 And the chain and watch gleamin' 
 And you thinkin' this a dreamin' 
 Welcome to the nightmare 
 Blunts, the Delorean 
 This shit'll travel light-years 
 But you gon' end up right here 
 My rap style is impeccable 
 Standing still in the mirror but seein' my reflection move 
 Phantom no vehicle, ghost no vehicle 
 A Ouija board, it ain't weed what the fuck I need it for 
 And what the fuck you got me heated for 
 Real cool nigga, show you what the heat is for 
 Ghost and Bronson, shoot like Bronson 
 Cook you like Swanson, now look at your conscience
