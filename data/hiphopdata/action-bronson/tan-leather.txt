Fuck the light at the end of the tunnel 
 'Cause I'm living for today, tryin' not to drown in a bottle 
 Death all around me, drugs seem to numb me 
 Mental's gettin' sicker, the Devil's gettin' comfy 
 Acupuncture with the smoke like I'm Mason Storm 
 Legs crossed like a Buddhist, smokin' Buddha 
 Angry tuna, chillin', gettin' brain from Uma 
 Used to lose, now everybody kangaroos 
 Hop off the schnitzel, see me on Kissena 
 Smoke the marijuana, always been the same guy 
 Whether ballin' on a yacht, or haulin' from the cops 
 I'm flooring on the Fox, till I'm swelled up in a box 
 All you gotta do is see me when you see me 
 I'm burnin' bitches from the TV like a CD 
 I'm trynna live the life in 3D 
 So you could nibble on my pee-pee 
 We out in Fiji 
 From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket 
 Bone marrow roasted 
 Spread it on the rosemary bread, lightly toasted 
 Drizzle with the vinagrette 
 Stuffed dutches and it's pulling like a cigarette 
 Until I'm tan skinned, bitches sayin' that I'm handsome 
 'Bout to be up on the screen like Ted Danson 
 Suede loincloth, never fall off 
 Mr. Wonderful, Paul Orndorff 
 Leather jacket, knee length 
 Peace to people gettin' money in the 80's with the freebase 
 First time, you get a free taste 
 That's the start of a career chase, I'm eatin' cheese plate 
 Skirt steak shaved straight up off the diaphragm 
 Muay Thai title fights out in Thailand 
 I spit the fly shit, accompanied by fly bank 
 Use the flows that have me diving up in thighs tan 
 Purple rain, no Prince, summer solstice 
 Dope body, but her pussy's like an old fish 
 The antipasti is a cold dish 
 Yo, I'm focused, catch me out in London speakin' Polish 
 From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket 
 Bone marrow roasted 
 Spread it on the rosemary bread, lightly toasted 
 Drizzle with the vinagrette 
 Stuffed dutches and it's pulling like a cigarette
