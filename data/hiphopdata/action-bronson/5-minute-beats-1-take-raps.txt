Five minute beats, one take raps 
 No false stories of my gunplay stats 
 Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat 
 Hand-craft the music, rhymes stay acoustic 
 Pies and Thighs on my mind all the time, roll the lime 
 Fuck rap I was class with my bus pass 
 Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache 
 Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough 
 Needle in the hay, charismatic character, far from amateur 
 Spider senses so I'm scanning the parameter 
 Straight from scrubs so my uncle is a janitor 
 Love my Mother, hate a motherfucker, hate a piece o' shit, hate a cocksucker 
 Stand beside me motherfucker you're my brother 
 Came from different pussies but we share the same supper 
 Five minute beats, one take raps 
 No false stories of my gunplay stats 
 Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat 
 Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat 
 West Palm Beach betting on a dog race 
 Bitch with me big titties and a small waist 
 Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy 
 Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy 
 Eating brisket, chilling at the bris 
 Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist 
 Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit 
 Veteran shit, give Melissa Etheridge a dick 
 Stroke pussy like a cat lover 
 My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother 
 And their Father's a G 
 Strictly Oolong on the tea, the shirt straight from '93, man with the ski 
 Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn, smart crew Queens 
 Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans 
 Old Girbaud shit, pockets in the front 
 Waist 33, odd sizes out of Marshalls 
 Five minute beats, one take raps 
 No false stories of my gunplay stats 
 Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat 
 Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat 
 Kid, Queens shit, Blue Chips shit
