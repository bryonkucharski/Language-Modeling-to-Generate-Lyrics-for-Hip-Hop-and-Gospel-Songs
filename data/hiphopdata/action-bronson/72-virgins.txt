(Action Bronson) 
 Here we are 
 Just us 
 I know you want from the first time you seen me in the movie 
 Hanging on the shoulder of a villain 
 She could flatten a village 
 You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis 
 Somehow, you and my man met first 
 I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse 
 But you were 
 Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work 
 Back then we smoked nickels of dirt 
 Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert 
 And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts 
 Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus 
 Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus 
 Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib 
 Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live 
 Die happy, knowing that my family's straight 
 I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate 
 I been a grown man since I had a baby dick 
 These motherfuckers ain't saying shit 
 Close my eyes, spray the whip, hit your rib twice 
 Now your kids gotta deal with this shit cause this is life 
 (Big Body Bes) 
 Yeah, and I'm fucking here now 
 It's fucking Body 
 What the fuck I'm doing? 
 Whole bunch a shit 
 I'm out here wilding 
 Got a fucking 50-year-old Puerto Rican with me 
 He don't even know my name 
 But he gon' stab something for me 
 He know what time it is 
 No watch on the wrist 
 Fuck outta here man 
 Smack the shit outta you then slap your son's father 
 Your own family loves me more than you 
 Salute me every time 
 Every time I come to your fucking crib, it better be a plate wrapped up on the stove motherfucker 
 Cause you know I'm coming to eat 
 Fuck that I don't even want firsts, I want my seconds first 
 That's right, I eat right out the motherfucking pot 
 Fuck a spoon, I been eating hand to hand my whole life 
 I motivate myself motherfucker 
 Anytime I need to think about some shit man 
 I just go back and close my motherfucking eyes man 
 And go back to the sorrow 
 Fuck outta here man 
 My whole life is a fucking discography b 
 You stupid? Quadruple platinum 
 Oops, what's that? Another one
