(Verse 1: Action Bronson) 
 Uh-huh, yeah, yo 
 Cash in a brief case, trying to play it smart 
 Love is a privilege and you better play your part 
 Don't wanna leave it to the lawyers breath 
 Snap my fingers, you'll be laying on the foyer steps 
 Wishing you were a boy again 
 Late night stand on the roof, smoke a newp 
 Reminiscing when I had the broken tooth, we were loose 
 Three different colors on the goose with the boots 
 Maryland College basketball suits 
 I drive the 525 made in '95 
 Shawn Kemps on the pedal, I'm a kamikaze 
 Right arm hang out the window while I steer left 
 Near death, slam into a deer's chest 
 Lights out for a second, but I'm back 
 Hopped up like a karate master 
 Still I blast the shottie faster on you bastards, make you backspin 
 Come out the closet you've been trapped in, that's it 
 Queens 
 (Verse 2: Prodigy) 
 Yeah, nigga you know I put the work in 
 Head shots real precise like a surgeon 
 I see your heart beating through your shirt, nervous 
 Nigga shaking in his J's, his legs gave in 
 Wow, and I ain't even pull the gun off my waist yet 
 This nigga done got so scared he took a shit 
 Then I swerved in some low key wheels 
 And go about my business like it never happened, chill 
 For reals, pop a couple pills 
 Cup a drink, come to think about it I feels 
 Like turning up the rap, ignorant, loud 
 Like this weed that I smoke, make a thick, yellow cloud 
 Perpetual payday, my money don't vacay 
 I'm out seeing the world, my life is so crazy 
 You could only imagine 
 But you could never fathom my intelligence, I get at em 
 (Verse 3: Raekwon) 
 Oh shit, it's real like that, right y'all? 
 Word up man, pledge allegiance man 
 I Patrick Ewing niggas, long shotties I be 'suing niggas 
 You gon' pay, face the camera ruin niggas 
 And my money, I'm collecting and I'm stepping 
 Might slap the shit out your man and take his weapon 
 Hungry and angry and I'm savagery, but still 
 More your majesty, wipe out the cool t-shirt, vacuum it 
 And I'm gon' keep you rich, so chill 
 Or you can live with them faggots and stay away from real deal abbots 
 Death is our game plan, new playing bullets 
 Come in spray cans, write graffiti all on your vest 
 Lester, cousin Eve sleeve all greasy 
 He the best of it, put it right there, you get a check 
 Slang prostitution, it's prohibition 
 When we move shit, this is what some niggas suggest 
 I suggest war, and clout the fake niggas 
 They could move out, take no chance, you never know, y'all 
 (Outro: Raekwon) 
 For real man, 'cause we ain't playing no games no more, no more homies 
 You sit around this, you sit around the best 
 With gold forks and all that, word up 
 Y'all niggas that come shine, come through come through come shine, come 
 You know what it is man, it's automatic
