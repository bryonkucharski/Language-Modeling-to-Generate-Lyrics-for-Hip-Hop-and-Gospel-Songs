We've been the best since I stepped in 
 Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn 
 In the sack, break her back like a Redskin 
 Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin 
 Tree to make the head spin 
 Every season play the corner like I'm Revis 
 Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus 
 New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop 
 I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop 
 Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch 
 Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot 
 Bitches are on display, give brain 
 Inside the coupe - shift gears, that's with the left 
 Which means I'm on the right, get paid 
 By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid 
 Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking 
 Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean 
 In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief 
 Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat 
 12 courses laid up on the long table 
 Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel 
 For fly women use a condom 'cause it's fatal 
 Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil 
 The red razor cut the features in your facial 
 Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona 
 Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner 
 Tu ne tappa me, muthafuckas are sloppy 
 Captain of the rap, you talking to papi 
 Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a 
 Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough 
 Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off 
 Hash straight from the desert, can knock 
 A camel off, Sheep straight out of school 
 Let the hammers off - off the boat shit 
 Whole cliques roll thick, no shit 
 Piss drunk and they smoke sticks 
 Not a word of English but 
 They hold the four-fifths 
 Fila jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit 
 Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand 
 Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam 
 Never speak to fuzz 
 Tap out the reefer, show him how 
 To use his sneakers, 'cause 
 Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom 
 We on the beach, fresh Ceviche 
 We in Cancun, fly girly curly 
 Hair is getting read through 
 We in the shower give me head: shampoo 
 Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle 
 Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco 
 Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango 
 I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you 
 Bye, peace, one, fuck you
