You said that I was worthless 
 Sure enough the toxins came up to the surface 
 I'll take your oxygen I'm perfect 
 Better bring your iron to the skirmish 
 Step on heads of serpents, smoke detergent 
 Robert Downey Jr., rotate image 
 Old money in the bag look like sauteed spinach bitch 
 Manicurin' like a China, spin out the Beamer at the arena 
 Bitches spot me like a cheetah 
 Wild life, wild nights with your wife (twice, dyke) 
 Now who the one that be turnin' the wheel in the old Deville 
 Step in the field, suckas know I'm real 
 Long sword down the leg so I stand still 
 Red beard so I resemble Jim the Anvil 
 Neidhart, ride dirty in the five sharp 
 Hand skills, Jean Claude, fine art 
 Put my head right through the Monet, ole 
 All the drugs I smoke, my lungs are probably coal gray 
 Ice on the Rolly, dykes on the pole play 
 Gravitatin' towards the money cause it brings me joy 
 Only thing next to my baby girl and baby boy 
 Drop Mercedes toy 
 With your moms butt naked cookin' eggs like Ving Rhames in Baby Boy 
 You know the outcome, you ain't about none 
 Smoke 'til my mouth numb 
 Hold the chopsticks at the top you know I'm upper class 
 Grab the sizzle beef with my teeth 
 Hop in the vehicle, lit the keef 
 Back in the streets, it's me 
 Yo this is Bam Bam and I'm representin' Flushing 
 Smokin' blueberry like a muffin 
 Yo I'm the one your lady lovin' 
 Just tell that bitch I need a scrubbin' 
 And don't forget the chicken in the oven 
 Never burn a dinner, spend cake on cheese 
 Red mirror lenses in the gray Oakley's 
 Flip out the plane with a cape on skis 
 Girl I really love it when you're dancin' on me 
 Dancin' on me, dancin' dancin' on me 
 No time flat I'm gonna be on TV 
 With a big batty gal, skin tropical 
 I'm doin' all the things you never seen possible 
 Blow the smoke out, the BBS's poke out 
 Daddy did the three-piece and mommy brought the cloak out 
 Nowadays you can catch me out in So Cal 
 Spendin' five stacks in a week in the grow house 
 Now I'm highed up, makin' popcorn 
 Flip the bag this side up 
 Then sit back on the couch 
 And let me put my penis in your mouth 
 Cause girl I really want some head tonight
