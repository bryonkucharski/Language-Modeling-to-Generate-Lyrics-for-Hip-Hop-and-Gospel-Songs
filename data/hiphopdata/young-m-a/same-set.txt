It's lit 
 It's lit 
 Uh, red cup and the wood tip 
 I'm just tryna clear my mind from the bullshit 
 I got ninety-nine problems, money ain't one 
 They be talkin' bad bitches but I date one 
 Money stackin', pistol packin', what that talk 'bout? 
 Bitch I'm gettin' forty bands on the walk out 
 Yeah I blew a little money but my bills paid 
 I woke up the next day and I'm still paid 
 I remember when I barely had a dollar on me 
 I remember ducking cops 'cause I got it on me 
 Went from plain gold chains, now I'm watered down 
 Now I drink to my success and that water brown 
 We them niggas 
 Always see me with the same set 
 We make money, we don't make threats 
 While they pay attention we get pay checks 
 When they throwing shade we just play catch 
 Getting money with my set now 
 When I'm praying is the only time my head down 
 Popping bottles, I'm all wet now 
 Told my city I won't let up, I won't let down (Brooklyn) 
 Chain is ocky, wrist is rocky, what that talk 'bout? 
 I just bagged twenty bitches on the walk out 
 Honestly, knowing me, I won't hit them up 
 And if they try to hit me up I ain't picking up 
 Life was a living hell, now I'm living well 
 And we drink champagne like it's ginger ale 
 And we stand on the couch while my song playin' 
 Up in VIP like we ain't got no home training 
 We them niggas 
 Always see me with the same set 
 We make money, we don't make threats 
 While they pay attention we get pay checks 
 When they throwing shade we just play catch 
 Bob Marleys and Gorilla Glue 
 Out in Cali, getting cloudy with my hitter Blue 
 Uh, you aight ma? yeah we good 
 And if I had to make a wish, I wish you niggas would 
 Put my Cartiers on for the shade throwers 
 At first they was fucking with us then they changed on us 
 And we right back popping and they back again 
 And these hoes back thotting and they back again 
 In the Yams with some Jordans, on our scooter bikes 
 They was claiming that they do it but don't do it right 
 It's not about what you got, it's 'bout who you are 
 'Cause we don't need foreign cars to get foreign broads 
 'Cause we them niggas 
 Always see me with the same set 
 We make money, we don't make threats 
 While they pay attention we get pay checks 
 When they throwing shade we just play catch 
 But nah for real 
 We really be in the Yams on them scooter bikes bro 
 We got the Jordans on the back of them 
 And all that 
 Then we see these niggas comin' down the strip in foreign cars 
 And we be laughin' 'cause 
 When you look inside of them 
 It's just niggas, no girls, niggas 
 Fuck outta here 
 We them niggas
