I just want the Audi R8 with the matte black paint on it 
 Hoping that them niggas don't hate on it 
 New York plates on it with my own name on it 
 Young M.A on it, just wait on it 
 They say that I manipulate the youth 
 Nah, don't get it wrong, I speak the truth 
 This is deeper than the roots, look around you see the proof 
 No excuse, but what you see is nothing new 
 They saying that I'm rich but I ain't rich yet 
 I ain't count a hundred M's yet 
 I ain't buy the Beamer and the Benz yet 
 And I ain't fuck all of her friends yet 
 My mama said I ain't about a dollar 
 'Cause a dollar just a dollar, only God can make you prosper 
 And baby when you do it do it proper 
 And if they ain't tryna hear, you better holler 
 And only wife a chick if she a scholar 
 If she down then she a rider 
 She been with you from the bottom, 'cause 
 Nowadays it's been kind of hard to find 'em 'cause 
 Every bitch a prima donna, a hundred on the highway 
 Riding in the Hyundai 
 Glock on the side 'cause they 
 Lookin' at me sideways 
 Gotta make a quick move, grindin' 'cause the rent due 
 I hear them guys talkin' 'bout me, homie that's a bitch move 
 That is what a bitch do, I'm guessing you a bitch too 
 Finding Nemo with the chopper 
 Feed them niggas fish food 
 Loyal to my last breath, ridin' till the wheels fall 
 But I'ma still ride man, even when the wheels off 
 I know who really fuck with me 
 I know who only want from me 
 You ain't gotta tell me that 
 I know the difference luckily 
 That's why I keep my eyes wide 
 That's why I keep a side-eye 
 And I keep a long nose 
 Ready for you wise guys 
 I just want the Audi R8 with the matte black paint on it 
 Hoping that them niggas don't hate on it 
 New York plates on it with my own name on it 
 Young M.A on it, just wait on it 
 Rich and famous 
 But I just want the money, I don't want that fame shit 
 Hanging with them guys that's armed and dangerous 
 Cut some niggas off, had to make some changes 
 'Cause they was on that same, they was on that same shit 
 I just gotta go and get it, I don't have no patience 
 I'm that get this money, stay in my lane shit 
 That's upgrade, self-paid, self-made shit, M.A 
 Uh, I wanna sip white Henny in the white Bentley 
 I wanna sip moonshine by the poolside 
 I wanna count hundos in the condos 
 Pull a blunt two times then I woosah pool side 
 Eating lobsters and steak by the lake 
 I wanna have a feast by the beach 
 Looking at the waves, looking at the waves 
 I wanna feel the sand on my feet 
 I just wanna eat, I just wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep 
 I just wanna grind, I just wanna keep, making money 
 I don't wanna beef, no I ain't pussy, no I ain't sweet 
 But if the pussy sweet I'ma eat (Ooouuu) 
 Rich and famous 
 But I just want the money, I don't want that fame shit 
 Hanging with them guys that's armed and dangerous 
 Cut some niggas off, had to make some changes 
 'Cause they was on that same, they was on that same shit 
 I just gotta go and get it, I don't have no patience 
 I'm that get this money, stay in my lane shit 
 That's upgrade, self-paid, self-made shit, M.A
