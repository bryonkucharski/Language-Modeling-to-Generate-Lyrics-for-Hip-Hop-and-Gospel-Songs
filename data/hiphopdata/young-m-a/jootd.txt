It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 Airplane mode on these hoes 
 That's on the regular 
 Somebody's girlfriend blowing up my cellular 
 If I got head from ya I'm deadin' ya 
 Hit that decline button 
 I don't wanna be bothered baby, my mind running 
 I don't mind hitting that block button 
 I'm quick to block something 
 I'm quick to block a thot 
 Yeah I flop a lot, don't care if she hot or not 
 'Cause hoes get ignored every day B 
 Man she'll be aight 
 You keep worrying about me, girl you need a life 
 I got this blunt, now I need a light 
 No I don't need a wife 
 I'm moody, I don't want no groupies 
 I ain't in the mood for no coochie 
 I don't wanna talk to Kim, Jessica, and Julie 
 They don't really love me, they just wanna do me and use me 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 Nike slippers and sweatpants 
 Bitch I'm comfortable 
 If I don't really fuck with you then I'm dubbing you 
 I'm just stacking this cheese up like a Lunchable 
 It's just, one of those day-ay-ay-ays 
 Just one of those days 
 She text me like why you playing these games? 
 You know I'm stuck in my ways, why you seem so amazed? 
 Let me be in my zone, let me be on my own 
 Now she in her feelings like fuck it go be alone 
 Why you doing all that, you ain't even all that 
 Put her on the blocked list, now she can't call back 
 I can never fall off, bitch I just fall back 
 Thought I was the one, I'm like nah, why you thought that? 
 I just let her argue with herself, I don't talk back 
 Since I ain't the one 
 Now girl are you finished or you done? 
 (Are you done? are you dumb?) 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I wanna be all alone 
 It's just one of them days 
 When I gotta be all alone 
 It's just one of them days
