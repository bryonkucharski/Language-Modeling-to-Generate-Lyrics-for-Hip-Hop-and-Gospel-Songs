Looking for that, that Bonnie man 
 Need a lil Bonnie with me man 
 Lil Bonnie by my side and all that 
 Lil Bonnie and all that 
 Bonnie, huh 
 You can call me crazy if you wanna 
 Shawty got me on some other (some other shit) 
 Shawty tell me what you want 
 I can beat it like it's bad or I can eat it like it's lunch, ooouuu 
 I dare a nigga try to front too 
 Go ahead and try your luck dude 
 Bust a move, that's a dumb move 
 My shawty 'bout it and she dump too 
 Shawty tryna tell me that she could have me sprung 
 You know who I am? girl you fuckin' with the one 
 She the type to go and get it, I'm the type to get it done 
 So if you wanna chase this bag, shawty let's go on this run 
 I'm like ooouuu, she like ooouuu 
 I'm like shawty what it do? 
 She smoke the loud I just sip the Henny, she like, "hit it with me," 
 I'm like, "nah", she like, "why?" I'm like, "fine" 
 Now you gotta drink this liquor with me 
 You ain't gotta drink a lot, here just sip it with me 
 Let's get this money, spend it with me, what's mines is yours 
 And what's yours is mine, meaning you ain't gotta split it with me 
 Niggas be mad every time they see me with her 
 I don't even need the nina 'cause my shawty keep it with her 
 And when I'm on the road and she at home I leave it with her 
 'Cause while I'm doing shows and she alone, she need it with her 
 Even my ex wanna fuck her 
 All of my guys want her 
 She a slayer, I'm a stunner 
 She ain't tryna tie me down, 'cause I'm a fighter, not a lover 
 I run with her, and she run with me 
 She don't keep it a buck with me, she keep it one on one with me 
 I don't tell her I love her, I tell her I fucks with you 
 And that's just the Henny speaking whenever I fuss with you 
 It's better we stick together, so fuck it, I'm stuck with you 
 But if you disloyal to me than shawty I'm done with you 
 Don't ever think that I can't live without you, huh 
 I smoke this L 'til I forget about you, huh 
 So don't be acting like them other hoes, huh 
 'Cause I'll treat you like you one of those, huh 
 Then she hit me with that, "nigga please," huh 
 "This pussy good, you ain't gon' never leave", huh 
 I can't lie I be on it, huh 
 And I can't lie, you're gorgeous, huh 
 But if I had to choose, uh 
 My money is more important 
 Money is wifey, I'm sorry, I can't divorce it 
 'Cause when that money callin' it's hard for me to ignore it 
 But that's my lady, my baby, and she a boss chick 
 I buy her Louboutins and I just buy me some Jordans, uh 
 She ain't worried 'bout my last chick 
 And I ain't worried 'bout her last dude, huh 
 And she love it when we have a quickie, huh 
 That's why I eat it like it's fast food, huh 
 Even my ex wanna fuck her 
 I said, even my ex wanna fuck her, huh 
 All of my guys want her 
 I'm like nah man, that's my bitch 
 Don't try shit, I'ma cock it, let it fly quick 
 Don't try shit, 'cause that's my bitch 
 That's my Bonnie, my Bonnie 
 That's my Bonnie, my Bonnie 
 That's my, that's my Bonnie
