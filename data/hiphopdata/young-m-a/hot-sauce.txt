Straight off the top 
 M.A bring them hoes out 
 Redlyfe bring them poles out 
 Pull up to the club with a bottle on me (that Henny) 
 I'm already sipping 
 Got five voicemails, I just left the brib 
 And my bitch, she already tripping 
 Blu just rolled a blunt, he like, "bro you good?" 
 I'm like, "nah bro, let me hit it" 
 Puff puff drink, I don't wanna think 
 Groupies want a picture, groupies gotta wait 
 I'm in another zone, I'm in another zone 
 My girl getting on my nerves, I ain't going home 
 Ain't got time for this shit (I don't got time for this shit) 
 I ain't got time for this bitch (I don't got time for this bitch) 
 Throwing ones like money grow on trees 
 So when I look down all I see is green 
 Never look for love in the strip club 
 Where all the bartenders give me big hugs, wait 
 Hold up, turn around, tssk, girl 
 Where you think you going with that big butt? 
 Brown water sippin' in that big cup 
 My nigga Bottle only rolling big blunts 
 Chill dude, you are not a tough guy 
 Not the only one with a gun, guy 
 My hitters like shootin' shit for fun, guy 
 Head shot, hit the boy one time 
 Do not come to Brooklyn with that nonsense 
 I used to bag the work in them apartments 
 Now I get a bag for a walkthrough 
 If you want to book me, Big Savage who you talk to 
 While they making disses I'm just making hits 
 'Cause if it don't make dollars it don't make no sense 
 This is chess, not checkers, learn the game dude 
 But I just can't relate 'cause that's what lames do 
 Big brown bone, she look like Babe Ruth 
 She let me hit it out the park like I'm Babe Ruth 
 Then I hit my dougie, ooh I'm pretty though 
 Bring that Hilfiger back and I'm jiggy though 
 Niggas know I'm hot but they envy though 
 Oh well, at least my bitch is with me ho 
 This her favorite song, this her favorite song (OOOUUU) 
 She get in her Birk when they put this on 
 Owww, that's the thot call 
 OOOUUU, shawty got that hot sauce 
 My guys don't talk, they just pop off 
 If a thot tryna front, she'll get dropped off 
 My homie Sav in that Porsche with the top off 
 I'm in that Audi with some slippers and some socks on 
 Doin' 95 just to piss a cop off 
 Then I pull up to your hood and piss your block off (skrt skrt) 
 Bitch I got that hot sauce 
 So NY with these Timbs on 
 And shoutout to the girls who don't wear sew-ins 
 'Cause it's all about my bitches with the wigs on, OOOUUU 
 You don't got no hot sauce 
 You are not hot, you a knockoff 
 Fuck around boy and get your top knocked off 
 Hear them hoes, yeah they quick to really pop off 
 And them Redlyfe niggas, yeah they pop off 
 And you know this the beat I can bop on 
 Yeah we bop on, New York City bop on 'em 
 Yeah we bop, I'ma bop, I'ma bop on 'em 
 Ooouuu 
 Yeah we got that hot sauce 
 But you niggas got no hot sauce 
 This the type of beat I can bop on 
 I need a quick thot that can top off 
 This the year that I really get my guap on 
 And you know the whole game, I got a lock on 
 It's Young M.A, Redlyfe, got that hot sauce 
 Redlyfe got that hot sauce 
 Shawty you don't got no hot sauce 
 Nah, you don't got no hot sauce
