M.A, M.A, M.A, M.A 
 M.A, M.A, M.A, M.A 
 Who dat who dat? never who dat (who dat nigga) 
 It's M.A bitch, act like you knew that (it's M.A bitch) 
 It's Redlyfe, it's Redlyfe (it's Redlyfe) 
 Ask around, we really do that 
 Turn the club into a fucking zoo 
 Groupie bitches love the crew 
 That's nothing new, pull up in something new 
 Redlyfe bomin' through 
 Poppin' bottles, still spinning blocks 
 Speeding, rushing potholes, every Tahoe 
 Ubers full of shooters that'll crack your taco 
 Yeah I still ride for my guys 
 And I'm still packing them nines 
 Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed 
 I'm still the wave, I'm still the wave 
 I pour champagne on that bitch 
 For asking me for some money 
 They like M.A why you cheesin'? 
 'Cause I just got me some cunny 
 Got the baddest bitch in the game wearin' my chain with her middle fingers up 
 Like a dress-wearing lil church girl with strict parents, we don't give a fuck 
 They talk down, we live it up 
 We ain't worried 'bout nothing 
 I'm probably countin' money, getting head 
 And I'm just worryin' 'bout nothing 
 They chase clout, I chase checks 
 Fuck wrong with these guys? 
 Got a whole section full of bad bitches 
 And I grab all of they thighs 
 Went from underrated to most hated 
 From a nobody to a Young M.A 
 Even white people know me, like 
 That's Young M.A! No fuckin' way! 
 We party and bullshit 
 We pop bottles and we smoke weed 
 We fuck slow but we live fast 
 I get high but I'm lowkey 
 Celebrating every day now 
 Every day we awake now 
 It used to be that Hennessy 
 Now it's champagne for the pain now 
 It's Redlyfe, it's Redlyfe 
 Get down or you lay down 
 No this ain't no playground 
 Them guys don't play 'round 
 They was sleeping, yeah they was sleeping 
 Now that ass is awake now 
 Fuck everybody else 
 It's all about M.A now
