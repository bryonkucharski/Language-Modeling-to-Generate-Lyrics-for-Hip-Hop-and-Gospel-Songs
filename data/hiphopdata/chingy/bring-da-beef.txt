Bring da beef to the streets (y'all don't really want it) 
 Keep the heat with me (so don't run up on me) 
 All my people see (y'all don't really want it) 
 Betta not fuck wit me ('cause our hood is on it) 
 I'm a bad block crook out hurr runnin' wild 
 Bout to run up on your ass Tommy gun style 
 Call me One-eyed Willy since I sleep with my clothes 
 Make money with my partners as I murder my foes 
 In all black clothes like the Grim Reaper 
 Its G.I.B. and I'm my brother's keeper 
 (?) Will chop his fingers with an axe 
 These trick-ass cowards should be wearin tampax 
 What ya think this is, huh, a Lifetime story 
 Man I'm knockin' cowards off of my riders before me 
 Lay it down muthafucka and quit bumpin your gums, 
 Ain't no peace in the slums just bums and crumbs 
 Police say G.I.B. is a game 
 But we hooded up doin' our family thing 
 Straight up hang and swang in the city of? 
 Increasin my change to an impeccable range 
 That you can't reach, if you listen I'll teach 
 Of course I'm a beast on them tracks I release 
 Whether East or West, I envision a check 
 That my show pay, I'm a predator, hey 
 So where's my prey 'cause it's possible for me to be poppin' today 
 I'll keep rockin' the ? in the home of your place 
 Bet you won't wanna stay 
 Keep the chrome in your face 
 Betta watch what you say, hey 
 I'm? 
 Disturbin the streets 
 Money's my mission but the way I live ain't no guarantees 
 Just visions of casualties, sworn to municipalities 
 Got 'em after me 'cause a coward chose to speak on how I eat 
 But I don't play when it comes to my meat 
 Like the ? brothers, leave 'em layin between the sheets 
 See we Get It Boyz, so we roll with the heat 
 If money got a problem, tell him he gon' get beat 
 I'll put you lames in the place where you're eternally restin 
 And for that player-hatin' testin, you gon' meet the Smith and Wesson 
 'Cause these bad block niggas take no prisoners at war times 
 Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin in your door time 
 We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot 
 Plenty G's plus a silly G to get your ass-knot 
 Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand 
 Find these buzzards, split their wig, that is my master plan 
 I don't start it but I finish it a true gun blazer 
 OGM and H-man, them some true hell raisers 
 From the WMPG, Northside ? street 
 Stay equipped with the heat, so we can take it to the street, bitch niggas
