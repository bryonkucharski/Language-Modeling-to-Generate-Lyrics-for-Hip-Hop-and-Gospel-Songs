Shine, shine, shine 
 Everyday when I'm rollin' through the hood 
 Playas watch me 'cause they know I 
 Shine, shine, shine 
 Hey I know I'm shinin' I'm fresh pearl bodies in a crispy tee 
 Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna 
 Shine, shine, shine 
 Keep doin' what you doin' 
 It's ya time and its ya shine 
 I love the way you ride 
 I hope you shine 
 The party starts tonight 
 My friends are comin' over 
 I really think you fly 
 Tonight's the night 
 I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in ya face in ya state 
 In and outta cars, interstate, win a date with one of my broads 
 But you gotta hate a bitch before she gets your dick hard 
 That's what shinin' about and when you get the hoe 
 You can tear her linin out, what you whinin' about 
 You want the presence of pimpin', I'm walkin' while limpin' 
 And holdin' on the drink that I'm sippin', I'm flippin' the script an' 
 I'm slidin' while I'm dippin' my whip in, out of traffic 
 It's so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss 
 Matter fact nephew this bitch is a classic, pass this 
 Ayo locie loc' let's blow some dope, better yet lets go for dough 
 Hoe for hoe, I'm so fa sho, and so low and sensational 
 You know how I do it 
 Keep doin' what you doin' 
 It's ya time and its ya shine 
 I love the way you ride 
 I hope you shine 
 The party starts tonight 
 My friends are comin' over 
 I really think you fly 
 Tonight's the night 
 Now wuts the haps on the bottle caps I want a snow bunny 
 I'm Rick James bitch I got fasho money and I ain't hatin' for nothin' 
 But it be so funny cowards be wantin' see me with my eyes and nose runny 
 I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play 
 Basically around the burbs I'm fittin' like a Lego block, you bullshittin' 
 While I'm sittin' in an eight o drop, these suckaz tell me keep it gangsta 
 But they don't know, when they ain't lookin' I be doin' population control 
 Then I'm lookin' for a breezy with a whole lotta soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe 
 To not the jada with the ??, it's the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin' on the fifth 
 With Snoop be in the front and his ***elry shinin' all through his clothes and little tigger's 
 In the back on the low, but I still shine though 
 Keep doin' what you doin' 
 It's ya time and its ya shine 
 I love the way you ride 
 I hope you shine 
 The party starts tonight 
 My friends are comin' over 
 I really think you fly 
 Tonight's the night 
 Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that's deeper than rappin' and rhymin' 
 Success happens with timin', over here I'm doin' low with the punk 
 When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches 
 Lookin' for us but I ain't lookin' for puss, right now ma I'm lookin' for cush 
 And I'm strapped with the pound and ?? shoes, cackies, T shirts 
 Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab 
 A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused 
 I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn 
 So much money my *****z be countin' it wrong, so many hits 
 I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin', stainless still nine 
 And y'all still hate but we still shinin' let's go 
 Keep doin' what you doin' 
 It's ya time and its ya shine 
 I love the way you ride 
 I hope you shine 
 The party starts tonight 
 My friends are comin' over 
 I really think you fly 
 Tonight's the night 
 Shine, shine, shine
