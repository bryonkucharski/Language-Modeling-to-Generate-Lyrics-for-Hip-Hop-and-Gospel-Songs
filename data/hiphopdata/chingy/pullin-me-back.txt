(Feat. Tyrese) 
 Every time I try to leave 
 Somethin' keeps pullin me back, me back 
 Telling me I need you in my life 
 Every time I try to go 
 Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that 
 Everything gon be all right 
 Every time I try to leave 
 Something keeps pullin me back, me back 
 Telling me I need you in my life 
 It was meant to be 
 You were meant for me 
 So that means we gotta make it work 
 It was all good at first, 
 Spendin money, goin' shoppin' 
 Eatin at the finest restaurants 
 And then from club hoppin 
 She was right thurr with me bottle poppin' livin' that life 
 She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like 
 We didn't have a worry in the world, got you diamonds got you pearls 
 Cut can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls 
 Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it 
 You got a good nigga on the side, u betta run wit it, 
 Even though I'm on tha road doin' shows, 
 I make time for me 'n' her, relationship to grow 
 They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry 
 But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me 
 Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her 
 May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her, 
 (Uh) I thought I was your man 
 Guess you ain't understand, 
 N now I'm sittin' herre, lookin' crazy like 
 Damn! 
 Every time I try to leave

 Walkin' to house from hard work, my head hurts, 
 Instead of arguin, can I have dinner with some dessert (uh uh) 
 She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found, 
 Hey, give me time to put my bags down, 
 She's straight up, clowned 
 Before we end up fightin, let me leave, 
 I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need 
 Now I'm wit the fellas ridin' 'n' drinkin' 
 She's blowin' my two way up but I need some time for thinkin' 
 (Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naaaw 
 Give her some space and the next day I might call 
 What should I do 
 Look, let me ask y'all 
 Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall 
 I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed 
 But it happens some time 
 It's either love it or give it up 
 I thought I was your man 
 Guess you ain't understand 
 N now I'm sittin' herre lookin' crazy like 
 Damn! 
 Every time I try to leave

 (JD:) Chingy holla at dem again! 
 Ta all the fellas know you feel me, if you eva had a woman, 
 Good times led to bad times n u ain't see it coming, 
 Try the best to make her happy, 
 But it wasn't enough, 
 'Cause mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff 
 N I don't wanna have my head down 
 Weak 'n' stressed out 
 As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next round 
 (Uh) I thought I was her man 
 Guess she ain't understand 
 N now she's sittin' hurr lookin' crazy like 
 Damn!
