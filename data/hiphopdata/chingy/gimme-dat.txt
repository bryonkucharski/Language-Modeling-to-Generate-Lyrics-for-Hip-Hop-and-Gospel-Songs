 Pop 1 bottle, pop 2, bottles pop 3

 Louis frames match my Louis kicks on my fifth right? 
 Dirty lame lookin' at me wrong? Tell 'em get right 
 Light reflecting off the Bentley watch, now I'm lit right? 
 Sixes on the candy range just so I can sit right 
 Hotter if ya chick nice, I can triple his price 
 On the black boy, got 'em hating, wanna fist fight? 
 Man don't get ya shit sliced, yeah, I hope the fifth tight 
 We tryna party, yo homey don't mess up this night

 Chingaling, I gotta car full of women 
 And a truck full of beef, air full of smoke 
 Le box full of heat, heat it and repeat it eight day 
 If the cops seein' on mah bumper, everything is okay 
 What you say, we cruise down the block? 
 Droolz on my watch, fools on mah truck 
 So, turn this tune up a notch 
 'Cause mah whip game's proper, Bentley drop topper 
 Clubs on Luda, drinks on Chaka 
 Ima mash that woman, smash that woman 
 Jump, shot, fake and pass that woman 
 Over to Bobby V.and tell her to swallow he 
 Oops, did I say that? Good oh, Golly V. 
 'Cause it's probably three more women in tha cut 
 Talkin' 'bout tonight, they tryna get fucked up 
 And who tha hell would I be 
 If I ain't grant them they wish? 
 Well, sure as hell, it's not Ludacris 
 Who is this that got his pockets all swole, big bank rolls 
 A bad li'l mama, and she ready to go 
 I'm like 
 I just want that gushy, gimme dat gushy 
 I just want that gushy, baby that's 
 I got my pockets all swole, big bank rolls 
 A bad li'l mama, and she ready to go

 Mah whip flash, you my catch whip glass 
 When ya boy dip past, man, ain't none of y'all cold as me 
 Mah chick lash, she ain't roll this past 
 Watch that new six stash 
 Why can't none of y'all roll like me? 
 Don't get mad, blame mah momma dem 
 Plus the Cadillac gangsta grill but don't call me drama then 
 My flows listen to 'em, you mah final summit then 
 Is a couple celebrity chicks, yeah, I'm with them 
 I got my pockets all swole, big bank rolls 
 A bad li'l mama and she ready to go
