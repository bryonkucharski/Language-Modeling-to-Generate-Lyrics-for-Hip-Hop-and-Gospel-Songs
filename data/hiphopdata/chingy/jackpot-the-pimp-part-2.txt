Hey, what's goin' on y'all? 
 It's your main man, Jackpot The Pimp once again. 
 Did you miss me? Hope not. 
 I've just been pan-handling makin' these hoes walk backwards to the track to get 
 My stacks or get smacked and my pimpin', 
 HELL Yeah, 24/7, 3 hundred 65 days outta a yurr, I am, Baby. 
 But check this out, I talk to my main man, Snoop Dogg, the other day. 
 He told me to make a bitch pay like she weigh. 
 Hoe, you made the bed you gotta lie in. 
 Matter of a fact, Bitch, die-in. 
 You see you all this gator skin on me, hoe. 
 Fur on my rolls royce, flow. 
 Take ya shoes off before you get in hurr, bitch. 
 Say what? Pimp, I got the juice. 
 And the flock of hoes I'm bout to let it loose on your strip. 
 Wurrs my cash, Trick? 
 Get My Grip. 
 Nigga, quit watchin' Superfly so much 
 And quit copyin the mack. 
 I really do gotta Cadillac with a wheel 
 On the back that say Hoe Slayer.
