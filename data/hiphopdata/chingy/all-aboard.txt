 There she go with that coke bottle, body guns, bang, bang 
 When she drop it on down, doing her thang, thang 
 And I can't stop assuming her 
 She get it in then she run, run with it 
 Break it on down, 911 with it dumb, dumb did it 
 Took my fit it, wink her eye then I go, go get it, ay

 Then I close my eyes and realize that I want this to sway

 We feeling like these feathers stuck together, blowing away
