Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Let's talk this over 
 It's not like we're dead 
 Was it something I did? 
 Was it something you said? 
 Don't leave me hanging 
 In a city so dead 
 Held up so high 
 On such a breakable thread 
 You were all the things I thought I knew 
 And I thought we could be 
 You were everything, everything 
 That I wanted 
 We were meant to be, supposed to be 
 But we lost it 
 All of our memories so close to me 
 Just fade away 
 All this time you were pretending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 You've got your dumb friends 
 I know what they say (they say) 
 They tell you I'm difficult 
 But so are they (so are they) 
 But they don't know me 
 Do they even know you (even know you) 
 All the things you hide from me 
 All the s*** that you do (all the s*** that you do) 
 You were all the things I thought I knew 
 And I thought we could be 
 You were everything, everything 
 That I wanted 
 We were meant to be, supposed to be 
 But we lost it 
 All of our memories so close to me 
 Just fade away 
 All this time you were pretending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 It's nice to know that you were there 
 Thanks for acting like you care 
 And making me feel like I was the only one 
 It's nice to know we had it all 
 Thanks for watchin' as I fall 
 And letting me know we were done 
 He was everything, everything that I wanted 
 We were meant to be, supposed to be 
 But we lost it 
 All of our memories so close to me 
 Just fade away 
 All this time you were pretending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 You were everything, everything 
 That I wanted 
 We were meant to be, supposed to be 
 But we lost it 
 All of our memories so close to me 
 Just fade away 
 All this time you were pretending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Oh oh 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Oh oh 
 So much for my happy ending 
 Oh oh oh oh
