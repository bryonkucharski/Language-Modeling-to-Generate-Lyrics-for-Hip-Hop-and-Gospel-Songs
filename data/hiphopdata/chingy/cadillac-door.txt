 I know you've all had a lot on your mind, man. 
 Had a lot of struggles you went through in your life. 
 Keep your head up dirty. 
 I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left. 
 I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess... 
 I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

 See the star was born. 
 Don't think nobody notice. 
 Goin' through these trials and tribulations kept me on focus. 
 Tried to do a 9-5, but where's the money? 
 Coming to work damn near bumming, people thinkin' it's funny (haha). 
 I'm fed up. 
 Plus my homies sellin' crack doin' good. 
 Now I'm thinking fuck doing it legal bring it back to the hood. 
 Man it's hell, you see, wasn't no woman there for me. 
 I ain't got shit but a dream, that's why they chose to ignore me.

 Hey 
 Now I'm on the block pumping rocks toting blocks. 
 Grand-mama on my head, I'm ducking and dodging the cops. 
 All 'cause I'm trying to make a living (living). 
 Consequences of that: 
 End up dead or in prison, ain't shit given. 
 I done struggled too long not to floss and get on. 
 Imma get it with the double, if not the microphone.I'm headstrong plus I'm out for those dead presidents. 
 And the government ain't doing shit for my residence.

 Plus I'm praying but they breaking down in tears.

 But I've been struggling trying to come up since I was a child. 
 Who are you to judge me for my sins and what I did wrong.
