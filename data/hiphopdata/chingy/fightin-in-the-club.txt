 Aint nobody playing fair ever man for themselve 
 When the push come to shove, shove come to push 
 You against us now us against you 
 All the buses came in 22's when the spre whole crew 
 And you probably gon run when the girls screamin "i thought i seen a gun" 
 They yellin that they fightin in tha club 
 Got people doing stunts got people rolling blunts 
 Got people in the ring got people that have sense 
 You need to stay low till you get out this building 
 Bursting everything even ya enemy 
 Niggas swinging pool sticks niggas throwing pool balls 
 Got niggas throwing bottles and got them throwing them all 
 I get locked up, I'mma get out tomorrow 
 They fightin in the club 
 Its all our fault had to go to waste cause all us folks
