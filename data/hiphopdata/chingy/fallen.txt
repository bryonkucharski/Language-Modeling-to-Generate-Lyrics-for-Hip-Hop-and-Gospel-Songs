Oh 
 Yeah 
 Oh oh 
 You complete me 
 Like air and water boy 
 I need thee 
 And when I'm in your arms I feel free 
 Fallen 
 My heads up in the clouds in love 
 I'm proud 
 To you say it loud 
 Like an accident it happened 
 Out of nowhere 
 It just happened 
 And I ain't mad at all 
 Because I've 
 Fallen 
 Head over heels 
 I've fallen 
 In love with you 
 I've fallen 
 And I can't get up 
 Don't wanna get up 
 Because of love (Because of love) 
 Baby 
 To let you get away is crazy (Let you get away) 
 So I'm doing what it takes 
 To make you pledge your love to me 
 You see 'cause I'm tryin' to be a lady 
 For ever and ever baby 
 The picture wouldn't be the same 
 If you weren't standing next to me 
 Can't you see I'm fallen 
 Fallen 
 Head over heels 
 I've fallen (I'm fallen) 
 In love with you 
 I've fallen (Oh) 
 And I can't get up 
 Don't wanna get up 
 Because of love (Because of love) 
 You compliment me 
 Not an accessory 
 You're necessary 
 You never could speak bad words against me 
 Your bare with me 
 Security 
 Are you here with me 
 You're my happiness 
 My joy (Joy) 
 And all because of you boy 
 I look forward to the time 
 I spend with you 
 Whatever it is we do 
 'Cause I'm fallen for you boy 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fallen 
 I've fallen for you 
 Fallen 
 Head over heels for you 
 So in love with you 
 Fallen 
 Love, oh 
 For you 
 Touch me (Touch me) 
 Hold me (Hold me) 
 Love me (Love me) 
 Kiss me 
 In love with you 
 Talk to me (Talk to me) 
 Caress me (Oh) 
 Play with me 
 Don't wanna get up 
 It's gonna be 
 You're my everything 
 Fallen 
 Head over heels (To let you get away is crazy) 
 I've fallen 
 In love with you 
 I've fallen 
 And I can't get up (I won't get up) 
 Don't wanna get up (Don't wanna get up) 
 Because of love 
 And I can't get up (And I can't get up) 
 Don't wanna get up (Don't wanna get up) 
 Because of love
