You know the definition of a balla (uh-huh) 
 That's me, 
 C-H-I-N-G to the Y, 
 Let me explain it to you though, 
 I'm a balla (say what), 
 High, roller baby (baby, baby), 
 Shot colla (that's right), 
 Drivin' chickens crazy (like me), 
 You a hater (you a hater), 
 Why you tryin' to play me (I don't think he know), 
 Fake playa (yeap, fake playa), 
 Scared I'll take your lady (hey, I'm a balla for real), 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 Girl I know you do the nasty (nasty), 
 I could tell when ya (when ya) walked past me (past me), 
 And your Prada lookin' flashy, 
 Errthing's on your mind, just ask me, 
 I know my ear related to da wasky wabbit, 
 Carats all in it jazzy, it's a habit (uh), 
 Hoe where's my cash, 
 Outside I got a Benz and Jag (both sittin' on chrome mags), 
 Is you down wit gettin' dirty wit a 'Git It' boy, 
 All I need is one night just to hit it boy, 
 After the club we can check in at five-star telly, 
 Get a suite and let me put somethin' in your belly, 
 What's your name? Sheena, 
 Oh, I thought you was Shelly, 
 Don't matter four o'clock, just be ready, 
 For a episode you probably won't come, 
 Back from, your momma must be thick 
 That's where ya get your back from?, 
 GIB we keep it crackin' ask Em and Rich, (what's up) 
 The girls on us so dirty who you rollin' wit, (GIB) 
 From Magic City to the pink slip in the Lou, (Lou) 
 Them chicks love the diamonds that I get from rob jewels, 
 We be in the spot maaaan hang up flirtin, 
 We be surrounding by girls man and I ain't burping, 
 All I know is money, cash, hoes, like Jay, 
 And I got all three no I don't play, 
 Chicks call me drama king like Kayslay, (Kayslay) 
 'Cause in the bed I bring it, yeah night and day, 
 Lettin rounds off in 'em like an AK, 
 You leavin' wit me tell me is it free or do I have to pay, (what you say?) 
 I like them black, white, Puerto Rican, or Haitian, 
 Like Japanese, Chinese, or even Asian, (okay) 
 Don't matter what color on this occasion, (fo sho) 
 Like smoke take a hit of what I'm blazin', 
 Instead of God it's me these girls praisin, 
 Meet me at about 6 at the Days Inn, 
 5 of em, 1 of me, I'm feelin' caged in, 
 I'm a pimp, I'ma keep on playin', 
 You know I love 'em for that one night, (one night) 
 I could take on ten with my one pipe, (one pipe) 
 Knock 'em all like a bowling pin on site, (on site) 
 Make 'em soak, change, girl look herre you better get your mind right, ('cause...) 
 Ain't nobody gettin' it like me
