Yeah Let me 
 This that Pro Player Music 
 Right hurr man 
 For the playas dirty 
 Let me 
 You ain't even gotta say nothing to a girl 
 You ain't even gotta approach her 
 She just gonna give it to ya 
 This ain't for you rookies though 
 Aim for your best 
 Get it 
 (Chorus: Girl) 
 You can get this lovin' 
 Its nothing 
 I think I got the something you wanting 
 So when you leave the club and 
 Come on in 
 Private party's jumpin' over here 
 Come on in, come on in, till morning 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, till morning 
 Come on in 
 I bumped in to this chick 
 Light skin and 5'6" 
 Thick as a brick 
 Nice stomach with some wide hips 
 Approached her like what's good baby? 
 You seem hood baby 
 Maybe we could hook up oh yeah we should baby 
 She asked my name 
 I laugh and flash my chain 
 I can't stop staring 
 Damn she got ass and thangs 
 We can forget about the club and go to my crib 
 The finer things in life, that's how I live 
 I told her think about it, take a second, then tell me 
 She said ain't nothing to think about (ha ha) 
 Ya smell me 
 She got close and ... 
 And almost overdosed 
 I stays fly ya know ya know 
 (Chorus: Girl) 
 You can get this lovin' 
 Its nothing 
 I think I got the something you wanting 
 So when you leave the club and 
 Come on in 
 Private party's jumpin' over here 
 Come on in, come on in, till morning 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, till morning 
 Come on in 
 (Chingy:) 
 We on the way to my house 
 Know what I'm thinking about 
 Pop some Jodecy in 
 That'll get her wet, no doubt 
 Look like you been needing a friend 
 To please, ya heard me 
 With that gangsta love, girl come ride with a G 
 Rolled up some of that sticky 
 Since she like to smoke 
 Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast 
 Pulled into the driveway 
 Hopped out and opened the door 
 Y'all might think that's weak 
 But all the real playas know 
 Got inside, said she's cold 
 So I turned the heat on 
 Persian rug on the floor 
 To wipe ya feet on 
 And in 15 minutes, head boss gonna get beat on 
 She ain't got no man, 
 Ain't got no woman, 
 Who there to cheat on? 
 Can I get it? 
 (Chorus: Girl) 
 You can get this lovin' 
 Its nothing 
 I think I got the something you wanting 
 So when you leave the club and 
 Come on in 
 Private party's jumpin' over here 
 Come on in, come on in, till morning 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, till morning 
 Come on in 
 (This is how it went down) 
 (Chingy:) 
 We in my bedroom 
 She ask, can I take a shower 
 Hell yeah, there go the soap, lotion and baby powder 
 She got undressed in front of me 
 She must been reading my mind 
 Glad I ain't buying 
 This something you'd want to see 
 Instantly, I snuck in 
 Then she told me, get in 
 I grabbed to glasses and a bottle of that Seagrams Gin 
 So we got in the Ja'causezi 
 Cause its more relaxing 
 Call me Mr. Miyabi 
 Cause that ass I'm gonna be waxing 
 She got a little tipsy 
 Then started feeling on me 
 Then start feeling on herself 
 Yep, it's going down homey 
 Next thing I know, 
 She went down... I got blessed 
 Then she got on top and let it drop 
 You know the rest 
 (Chorus x2: Girl) 
 You can get this lovin' 
 Its nothing 
 I think I got the something you wanting 
 So when you leave the club and 
 Come on in 
 Private party's jumpin' over here 
 Come on in, come on in, till morning 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, 
 Come on in, till morning 
 Come on in
