 Now that we together girl the light's so bright 
 It took a lil' time but now the feelin' so right 
 Remember when I snuck through your window at night? 
 Bringin' you flowers and candy 
 Me and you sippin' on Brandy 
 Plus I appreciate the love on sight 
 Huggin' me, holdin' me 
 Fix dinner, so polite (thank you baby) 
 Even when them stupid pigs was tryna sue me 
 Forget about friends and family

 We have a argument, it drive me to go out 
 You my flesh, so me and another woman won't BOUT (bout meaning 
 Thinkin' 'bout the times when you flew to my house 
 Gonna give you everything that you want

 Rose petals in tha tub

 I like your style, your grace, your beautiful face, your essence 
 Your size, your shape, this beautiful place, a blessin' 
 Your weight, your waist, your delicious taste, perfecting 
 Your height, your sight, with my life as your protection 
 So sweet like CANDY, let's raise a family in Miami 
 Where the beach so sandy, toast two champagne glasses, you and me 
 Your scent, like the smell of fresh AIR (pronounced URR) of relief 
 And for you I go over my budget 
 No I ain't CHEAP 
 Can't stop grindintill I get EVERY (pronounced ERRY) RECORD to the top 
 Just Know that you on my mind erry second on the clock 
 Tick tock, if you ever need help, scream (Ooh) 
 And I come runnin' for my life, to trade it in for your dreams
