Good evening 
 Town folk 
 Country folk 
 City folk 
 Rednecks colors and Spaniards 
 And anything in between 
 Brand new kicks to match my new outfits 
 I still roll wit project chicks 
 And I know I make y'all ni**as sick 
 I move crumbs to bricks 
 Too fly rides 
 Wood frame playa leather inside 
 That's dat high definition TV live 
 Check the chain, check the wrist, check the buckle 
 Aye neon, the flyest the freshest the coldest 
 The smoothest to ever to walk this earth and I knows this 
 High dats probably from purple puffin and drumsticks 
 I got enough game to spit this rap through a whole chick 
 It ain't me actin' 'cause see dis homie I'm chosen 
 Wrist all bliss because my watch is all slowed and 
 My life photo shoots see daily I be posin' 
 I hit the club and git it poppin' till its closin 
 I take you back in the days bugs bunny j's 
 Low cut fade and them Cartier shades 
 Pimpin' until I'm dead and gone somewhere in the 
 Remember what special ed said I got it made 
 Play games wit me boy you gon need first aid 
 I'm bout money you bout trickin' we ain't on the same page 
 A honey grant for a feature fresh let's get paid 
 From head to toe I'm g'd up 
 We doin' big stuff rippin' the grain and big trucks 
 Sippin' champagne with some ducks makin' big bucks 
 Wow! ain't no limit to my bank account 
 Wow! look at this check you see dat amount? 
 My wardrobe go across the globe 
 That's how it is when you release eight million sold 
 That's cool if I go gold 
 'Cause Ima read fo shows on this punkhold 
 Got the Benz that new range bout to git that bump 
 Plus got some new shit that you ain't never seen 
 All alone 
 Aye don't hate let the playas play 
 Before I hit you wit dat cake 
 I your kicks is crispy and yo fit is spiffy go head 
 If yo cake is jiffy and you richer den richy go head 
 If chick is pretty and you run the city go head 
 If yo pimpin' is strong and yo money is long go head 
 See all those other dude bedroom 
 Smell dat Gucci and me playa 
 Next thing you know they in my bedroom 
 My name speaks for what's up she give me some heads on 
 Rubys all in my charm lookin' like a red moona 
 Head cocked bandana reppin' for the block 
 Gang cocked guess some coward wanna take my spot 
 Law will run away from me I guess I'm that hot 
 Usta be fellen now its co slot-a-lot 
 Yes you know who it is 
 Its yo boy once again ching-a-ling 
 My homeboy Manny Fresh on the track ya digg 
 We gon do this one from the end onto the atl man 
 We gon keep it so fly so fresh and so clean 
 Ya dig what I'm sayin'
