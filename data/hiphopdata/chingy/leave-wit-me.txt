(Feat. R. Kelly) 
 Ba da da 
 Baby don't you want to leave this VIP 
 And finish off this party in my hotel suite 
 Girl just follow me because I got room keys 
 Sex, red bull and belve, we be like 
 Ba da da 
 I pull up on the light 
 And I fell up in the spot 
 Saint louis can't talk 
 Tryin' to find somethin' hot 
 Drink in my hand 
 Hundreds in my pocket 
 I don't curr if he ur man 
 Understand I'm ur profit 
 Its 2:39, we should leave by 3 
 We can stroll around an go get something to eat 
 Outside I got a flat drop 
 You hungry? 
 Round your girls up and we can all go to ihop 
 You prolly think I'm tryna cut 
 And maybe you're right 
 You don't like one night stands? 
 Well baby the night 
 I got a presidential suite at the ritz 
 Errything on me? huh ain't that a hushhhhh 
 You actin' like you don't hurr me 
 Come nurr me quick 
 Bacon, and take a puff of this green from jamaica 
 Just bought a new yacht with 4 rooms and a bar 
 No you're not that used to bein around a hood star 
 My papa told me good girls always go fast 
 So if I touch her right thurr ain't no need to get mad 
 I could take you from the club to paradise 
 Used to my chicks, I like them thick 
 Plus naughty and nice 
 The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom 
 The way you smell, shoulda had ur own perfume 
 So knock knock, whos thurr? Jackpot (that's hot) 
 Ran with the old head so ?(fuck the sex)? 
 Do it tickle when I lick your neck? 
 Better get you wet 
 Lookin' at your sexy ass make me wanna write a check 
 Baby don't you want to leave this VIP 
 And finish off this party in my hotel suite 
 Girl just follow me because I got room keys 
 Sex, red bull and belve, we be like 
 Ba da da 
 I know she like it from the back and from the front 
 I know you like it off the yak and on the blunt 
 I know you wanna ride around lets go 'bout the town 
 You know you claim of bein on top an goin' down 
 So show a little somethin' 
 Whisper in my ear and let me know a little somethin' 
 You workin that body 
 Well throw a little something over here where I'm at 
 Girl I got too much pride to be chasin the cat 
 But I like how that lingerie fit 
 Shit, I got enough game to hit queen elizabeth 
 My blood blue so you know I'm royalty 
 I'm through with catering to all you girls 
 Spoil ME 
 Now hold on the way you put it on me now 
 Hold on I love the way you shake it now 
 Hold on you drop it then you pick it up 
 Hold on girl you got me goin' what the (whoo!)
