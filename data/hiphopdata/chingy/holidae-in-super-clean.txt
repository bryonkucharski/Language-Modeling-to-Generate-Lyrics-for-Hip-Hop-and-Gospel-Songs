 I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store 
 Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an {coughs} of 'dro, ya know? 
 Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road

 Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning 
 Valet look like he in the game and must be winning 
 To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up

 I told 'em follow me they knew I had it cracking B 
 One said ain't you that boy that be on BET? 
 Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling 
 Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things Busted in, 
 Henny bottle to the face! Ooh it then, feel like my head a toxic waste 
 There's some pretty girls in herre, 
 I heard 'em whispering 
 Talking bout that's that dude that sing 
 'Right Thurr' he glistening

 Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles 
 Far from little, make ya mammary glands giggle 
 Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles 
 Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles 
 Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble 
 Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle 
 I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle 
 Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles 
 I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle 
 Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels 
 For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the 
 Big Snoop Dizzle 
 Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo 
 I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple 
 Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again 
 My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In
