I got my hands in my pocket 
 My hats real low 
 I'm to kool to dance I just rock [x3] 
 I'm on the edge of the dance flo 
 Drank in my cup 
 I'm to kool to dance I just rock [x3] 
 Friday night 'bout a quarter to 12 
 My benz outside and I'm ready to bail 
 My line'n on fresh and my shades channel 
 Gotta be so fly in that stl I hear da dogs bark 'cause I got dat mail 
 Before I go grabbed da pumper and a box of l's 
 Pulled out the drive way on my cell 
 Say he bout to meet me on [? ] 
 For da chicks got the sean john smell good 
 I know the thugs out so I'm keepn it hood 
 You can mug lil dirty but I wish you would 
 The real do what they want the fake do what they could some chicks rolled up in range and thangs 
 Lookin' like they ready so I asked dey names 
 They knew who I was now they lookin' strange 
 We on our way to the club and I don't play no games
