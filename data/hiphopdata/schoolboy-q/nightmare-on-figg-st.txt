Figg Side! 
 (Ball so hard) What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me 
 Can you please remind me? Shit, I'll remind ya 
 Put that steel behind ya, put five inside ya 
 Better chill out with all that flossing partner 
 (Ball so hard) You must be cray 
 Leave 'em in the streets with his shoelaces missing and socks up off his feet 
 Pistol holding gonorrhea, nigga, skeet-skeet 
 Soul dropped, Rock dropped, Dot dropped 
 Black Hippy, TDE, well, fuck it, nigga, let's four-peat 
 A dope Hoover dealer, uh, ADHD 
 Fuck that, let's bake coke and cook crack 
 Fuck the sheriffs, the gang unit, fuck crash 
 Pimp hoes or wring ya bread, she love tracks 
 Crack of dawn, Figg get it, yeah we get it, yeah 
 Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year 
 Niggas better hope our star popping 
 Before I start robbing the re-up with Oxycontin 
 On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it 
 It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging 
 On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it 
 Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year

 What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like you 
 You still need a reminder? (Yeah, I thought so) 
 Shit, I'm loco, 38 brown had to call him coco 
 Stick around the block boy, tell 'em go go 
 Don't stop shooting 'til ya all red tho 
 Yellow tape mothafucka shoulda yield ho 
 Why you all tough for? See your thug ass later at the crossroads 
 The landlord turn your lieutenant into a tenant 
 And if ya, rims spinning, your jaw dented 
 I'm a grown man dog, I ain't kidding 
 The end has come, so keep big weed and big lungs, big guns 
 Brought on her knees, the holy ghost, she speak in tongues 
 Murder searching, why even run one shot, he done 
 Nigga you must got me confused 
 Bitch, I'm from the Groove on Figg Side making moves 
 Drive to pussy more than I do to church 
 No AC, but the heater work, murk! 
 On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it 
 It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging 
 On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it 
 Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year 
 Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
