Our experience to where we have parents in our lives that were showing us everything, like didn't nobody walk us, our hand and show love like you do this and don't do that. It wasn't like that coming up in our mothafuckin' community. We grew up off of cigarillos... we grew up off of second row, acting like them. A worldwide blade, a real strength... 
 Yeah that's on the regular 
 Smokin' the gas on the regular, man 
 Word 
 Sippin' on Hen, that's the regular 
 Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh 
 I'm gangsta, Crip, my poppa was a bitch 
 Left me where hope just don't exist 
 And every neighbor got a fence 
 With bars on windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent 
 Throwin' dices, GT dyno pool 
 Where you hang, we shootin' 
 You slip, we stiffin' 
 Creative Crippin', uh 
 Bitches stoppin' traffic 
 This the type of shit that make the MAC a classic 
 Reason I'm a pussy magnet 
 She learned to carry package 
 Been the best at rappin', uh 
 I'm hot as Vegas 
 Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper 
 But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though 
 He tryna fool the people 
 Man 
 The joke's on you, mothafucka 
 The loc is on you, mothafucka 
 I warned you, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 Ain't nothin' changed but the change 
 Let's put our brains away from gangs 
 Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves 
 Shit we even changed our names 
 Tiny somethin' Lil Shane while we bang 
 But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me 
 My homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy 
 But... you keep your eyes in that dark 
 Your mind, it greys your heart 
 I wrote these rhymes days apart 
 Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts 
 How your grandmother see your corpse? 
 How your big homie make your life a book? 
 Left you for dead 'cause he ain't lead you, right 
 But I'm gon' fredom write 
 Let's put the rags down and raise our kids 
 Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff 
 Let's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs 
 It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips 
 You can learn to fly or take the ladder 
 Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides 
 Man 
 The joke's on you, mothafucka 
 The loc is on you, mothafucka 
 I warned you, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma 
 Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
