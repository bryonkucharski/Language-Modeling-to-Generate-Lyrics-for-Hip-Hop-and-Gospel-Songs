Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot 
 Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock 
 Every dollar closer to a drop 
 Every drop is closer to a cop 
 Every cop is closer to a cell 
 Hit the cell your ticket right to hell 
 No job, no bail 
 No fam, no mail 
 Institution another nigga fail 
 Go from pussy to a prison tale 
 Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead 
 Ship my music off with them instead 
 Turn it up and here the ghetto pledge 
 Live righteous nigga like my brother said 
 King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but ima shoota' 
 Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle 
 Finally gettin' praised 
 Yeah kudos 
 Doing bad, still love the need 
 Connect said it's something up his sleeve 
 Said, I rather bust off them keys 
 Yeah nigga birds and the beez 
 Birds and the beez 
 Birds and the beez 
 Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on 
 And my daughter hungry sitting home 
 And my girl said she feeling lone 
 I can't tell it's over in her tone 
 Only time I call is for a loan 
 She be stressing, so depressing 
 Always worried every time a lil nigga gone 
 Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah shoot ya' 
 Get a couple wipps, yeah kunta 
 Schoolboy but gangsta was his tutors 
 Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people 
 Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle 
 Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job 
 Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive 
 Niggas turn to shark over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed 
 So I rather bust of them keys, yeah nigga birds and the beez 
 Birds and the beez 
 Birds and the beez 
 Birds and the beez 
 Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it 
 Niggas out here living foul 
 Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game 
 Keep these niggas right up out my lane 
 I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change 
 Q I wanna see you do your thang 
 Entertainment business living lime light 
 Hop on every track and move them trains 
 Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been 
 Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life 
 And for you my nigga I would sacrifice my self to make it just to see you hold the mic 
 And hit the stage and rock the set but its hard to change when your from the set 
 Won't you think about it nigga, life or death, like a cracker would like to hang you by the neck 
 Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets 
 Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck 
 Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live 
 If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids 
 My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter 
 Please don't let her grow up life without a father 
 Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy 
 All she need is love but that shit aside 
 At the same time know they got to eat, know you got to hustle, make ends meet 
 Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c 
 And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze 
 Blue pill, red bill, choose now, birds or the beez 
 Birds or the beez 
 Birds or the beez 
 Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it 
 Niggas out here living foul 
 Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game 
 Keep these niggas right up out my lane 
 I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change 
 Count my change 
 Count my change
