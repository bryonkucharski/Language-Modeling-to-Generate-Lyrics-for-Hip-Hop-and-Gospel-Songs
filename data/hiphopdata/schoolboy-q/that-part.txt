 All my bitches flavored 
 That part, that part, that part, that part 
 Ay! That part 
 Bang this shit in the hood one time 
 Lil bitch I'm back and poppin' 
 Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options 
 Broke then fix your pockets, all I do is profit 
 Quarter million, switchin' lanes... that part 
 Bet my bitch move the same old thing... that part 
 405 with the gun off safe... that part

 Bitch up on the Q's your fate

 Five years I've been rich, nigga 
 Drove Bimmers down Fig, nigga 
 Pushed Porsches down Broadway 
 I've been doggin' different hoes, nigga 
 Got a chain that's worth the Rolls, nigga 
 Got an engine back with the top in it 
 Nigga drivin' it like it's a bomb in it

 Beggars can't be choosers, bitch this ain't Chipotle 
 Nigga with an attitude, I feel like O'Shea 
 Walkin', livin' legend, man I feel like Kobe 
 I just left the strip club, got some glitter on me 
 Wifey gonna kill me, she the female OJ 
 Y'all don't feel me, man this ain't okay 
 Four Seasons, take a shower, new clothes, I'm reloaded 
 Rich nigga, still eatin' catfish 
 That bitch ain't really bad, that's a catfish 
 If I walk up out of Saks Fifth 
 Have the paparazzi doin' backflips 
 If I lay you down on the mattress 
 Blow the back out till you backless 
 Thick, we already established 
 She just got 'em done, bra-strapless 
 Yeah! Okay, okay, okay, okay! (That part) 
 Beggars can't be choosers, bitch this ain't Chipotle (That part)

 Ay! That part 
 Bang this shit in the hood one time 
 Lil bitch I'm back and poppin'

 Me and Ab-Soul only thing go straight 
 Need me a bitch that'll go both ways 
 Style on top of style, nigga 
 Since a youngin' I wanted to ball, nigga 
 Had a pistol in my drawls, nigga 
 When I was broke, I had the sauce, nigga 
 Got a Chevy with side to side on it 
 Hundred spokes, the dang-d-dangs on it 
 Got a chopper that stand the fire too

 I just dropped 60, man I feel like Kobe 
 Lamar was with me, man I feel like Kobe 
 Pippen at my weddin', man I feel like Jordan 
 Trippin' at my weddin', I be runnin' away 
 Ain't say shit, nigga 
 You was listenin' close though 
 You was listenin' to Hov's flow 
 You wouldn't listen to the flow though 
 Listen to the 'Go 
 Listen to a young nigga from the 'Go though
