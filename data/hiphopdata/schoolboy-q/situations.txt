I got bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody fully loaded better watch your step 
 You keep running your mouth, or I'm hiding where you slept 
 Bet you be hog-tied and die for fucking with a red 
 Dude this for my niggas, bet they say it's worth it 
 So I don't leave the studio not until it's perfect 
 Can't you see I'm grinding, can't you see I'm working 
 Down to give this motherfuck the life and that's for certain 
 Sipping on that lean, same color as Easter 
 This weed Halloween, hi It's nice to meet ya 
 Checking out my steelo, it's on another 
 Couple hundred kilo, spend it with my brother 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set 
 I got money in my wallet, money in my pocket 
 Burner in my hand, so you better watch it 
 Bitch, I am the man tryna make a profit 
 Hope you understand, nigga what's ya logic? 
 Sagging in my jeans because I'm gutta 
 Fresh as Listerine, and still I'm gutta 
 Bitch I'm bout my paper, I'm bout that butter 
 Roll me up a blunt, time for another 
 Everybody paper chasin', working on a situation 
 Giving bitches penetration, Houston rocking, got it popping 
 Niggas like to catch a figg's ever seen a nigga drop 
 Coup the wrap, pollute the block 
 Cock it back then shoot the cop 
 Flee the scene then get the cream 
 Then go split it with my team 
 Live my life and live it right 
 Shit I'm the homie with a mic 
 The homies out here ain't nice 
 Earn they stripes, serving white 
 Shaving coke, nigga what you living for? 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set 
 Nigga finally on another page 
 Glock forty or the gauge (fade) 
 Hit a nigga with a blade, lay down, blocka 
 Then go around, blocka 
 Then another, take cover, black zip covers 
 Pass the deacon speakin', say the briefing 
 I know I left that nigga leaking 
 I know I coulda let him slide 
 But shit I'd rather slide a nigga 
 Forty-five a nigga 
 Shots will dive inside a nigga 
 Clean and sanitize a nigga 
 Smooth operator, Under-layer 
 Fast forward them shots and those who play us 
 Got love for my haters 
 And garcia Vegas 
 I put a dub in that it keeps my mind free of mazes 
 See my rhymes still amazes 
 Amazing ass nigga here to lick and pass nigga 
 Scheme ass on blast nigga 
 You say you doing bad, nigga what you lying for 
 Better get your chopper and then turn this bitch to Rambo 
 Meanwhile 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set 
 I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's cracking (crack) 
 Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen) 
 Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left 
 Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set
