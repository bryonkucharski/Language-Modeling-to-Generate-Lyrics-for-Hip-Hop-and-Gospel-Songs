I feel like a phenomenon 
 Like I'm who these people idolize 
 And I won't let nothing get in my way 
 It ain't a thing, we do this all the time 
 Got another one, twist another one, off that indo 
 That's my medicine, need a bigger lung 
 Fame going to my head, call it wisdom 
 Now I need racks, yeah, Wimbledon 
 This chewing gum, always hold ya tongue 
 Never spit it out, we finna miss like cobras huh 
 We soldiers huh, you noticed them 
 As the tales money flip, until the quota's done 
 Yeah, until my single come, be the Devil's son 
 Devil's work, getting work, Hallelujah 
 Hope the Lord alerts, do a soul search 
 Understand my heart's good, but my daughter's first 
 Black episode, my down time, needed church 
 Precious life what my style is worth 
 Won't gain, let my shit assert 
 Move on! 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 All the time 
 And I'm still up, never gave a damn, never gave a fuck 
 All my real niggas, we gon' stay in touch 
 Even out of range, nigga do your thang 
 You know where I'm at, just holla back 
 Where that cash at? Nigga flashback 
 Nigga sixteen? A dope sack 
 A sixteen? Stretch that 
 Double that, yeah, flip that 
 Big steps, work hard 
 Big yards, slanging footballs 
 Have 'em running back, receivers serving corners 
 It's taken by the pushers, burners eyes and lookers 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, now see we gotta make it 
 We ain't trying to brick, unless we cop a brick 
 Accompanied by the razors, you know the shit 
 I make it easy, ain't this 'bout a bitch? 
 Move on! 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 All the time 
 Said I can't lose, nigga gotta win 
 Future looking bright, Thomas Edison 
 Here we go again 
 Music always kept me calm, nigga ritalin 
 Always got it done, you a middleman 
 Contraband, yo we get it in 
 You are inelegant, my niggas looking militant 
 Dope boys, what you know about it? 
 You just know about it 
 A nigga sky high, boy, fuck a pilot 
 Microwave it fast boy, fuck a pilot 
 Yeah, hold it silence, keep your mouth closed 
 The game is to be sold not to be told, you like a ho 
 Matter like a auction, gave it to the best bidder 
 Lucky I didn't rob you, why your ass bitter? 
 I'm that nigga, better ask nigga 
 You was a phase, I outlast niggas 
 Move on! 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 We do this all the time 
 All the time
