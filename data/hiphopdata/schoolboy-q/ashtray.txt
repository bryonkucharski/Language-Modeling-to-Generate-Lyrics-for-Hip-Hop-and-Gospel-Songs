All my cars got gas in the ashtray 
 And all my cars got gas in the ashtray 
 All my cars got gas in the ashtray 
 And all my cars got gas in the ashtray 
 And we roll up that dour 
 Riiiiiight! 
 Blowing on that loud in the gas mask 
 Always get bomb, nigga: Baghdad 
 Hit the green door, get a grab bag 
 Pull out my trippy slide, Nicki with her fast ass 
 If I cop 5 I get 'em 4 a piece (riiight?) 
 Load up Dreddy van, hit the L.I.E 
 Niggas rapping, they be trappin, that's a L-I-E 
 I really live that let me tell you who the hell I be! 
 Had a nigga in the spot in the Hamptons, used to grab 4 of em 
 That's 25 a piece at least 
 Nigga getting chicken off that liquid petroleum 
 That OG kush, I used to ounce that 
 Fucked a little money up, it help me bounce back 
 I know it sounds absurd, nigga, living off herb 
 But e'rybody in the world need that loud pack 
 Riiiight? 
 Bitch-ass niggas wanna sleep on me? 
 Now I'm a nightmare 
 Wait that's the spot where they wrote me off 
 Y'all bitch-ass niggas still right there! 
 Nigga I don't even fight fair 
 I know it might scare, don't give a slight care 
 I ignite yeah bitch I'm so high, nigga I can fly Dom Buzz Lightyear 
 Had a nice year and the bitch just started 
 OF Tape went fucking retarded 
 I been that nigga, why you fuck boys stalling 
 I was Doms OG, puffing and coughing 
 Man niggas ain't real this often 
 But I'mma be that till they put me in a coffin 
 I'mmma be crack so inhale me with caution 
 Nigga, it be green like a jersey in Boston 
 It's Doms nigga, you better get real fine nigga 
 We in the middle of the calm nigga 
 And you know we drop bombs nigga 
 It's Smoke DZA and Harry Fraud, nigga 
 That's the cue for applause nigga 
 I had my back against the wall, nigga 
 Said fuck that and I balled, nigga 
 Backwoods keep a nigga's mind stuck 
 Off OG niggas tryna OD 
 With a NY bitch who want a mouth rush 
 She let a nigga skeet, all the girls know me 
 And I got the head too, cause the weed's so good, made a bitch say "Q!" 
 And a nigga so faded, racked out man a nigga straight made it 
 And you won't hit it if you're corny 
 Just got a ounce, more dope for the homies 
 I'm a rap Willie Nelson and Monster Kody 
 These raps is the end 
 I don't fuck with Kony, sliding in a Benz, no top up on me 
 50 for the bill, nigga fuck that Tony 
 Ride around gettin' it, smoking on doty 
 My mama with a bag with a little bit of hash 
 My daughter hear my grind and she had covered it with cash 
 Brought behind the wheel on me and gas 
 My nigga was in my drawers, so she smothered me with ass 
 Girlfriend are bugging, happy 'cause they keep me hoes 
 Switching up my flows cause a nigga getting blow 
 Dollar after dollar, man, this money getting old 
 Still buying eighths, what you know about O's?
