 In the bedroom geeked, while your clothes hang down 
 Chillin' all day, lovin' all night 
 Nice ass, and your stomach all tight 
 If your money ain't right, I should be in your life 
 Put it down when your boyfriend know, girl 
 Both hands where the sun won't show, girl 
 Meet you around four with the chauffeur 
 Keep a penny on top of my loafers 
 Keep a diamond on each of my tooth 
 I'm gettin' money like athletes 
 It can, it can go down in the backseat 
 I know all your right spots without asking, hey 
 Baby let me know it's mine 
 And I might put in overtime (that's right, yeah)

 Keep an arch in your back when you do it like 
 Fuck with me, you be luxury day and night 
 Got me trickin' on everything overpriced 
 Can I hit it and skip all the love? 
 Leave your square and come chill with a thug 
 Girl I'm privileged, you know how the time be changin' 
 Know I'm hittin' it right when your core be shakin' 
 Why you hangin' with niggas that's missin' payments? 
 Keepin' my dollars on top of dollars 
 Netflix and chill when it's after hours 
 I should be in your room when you leave the shower 
 Hittin' them spots like you taught me 'bout 'em 
 Girl me and you got a lot in common 
 I'm the one you should call when you're done with clubbin' 
 Darlin' fuck all the talk, let me show you somethin'
