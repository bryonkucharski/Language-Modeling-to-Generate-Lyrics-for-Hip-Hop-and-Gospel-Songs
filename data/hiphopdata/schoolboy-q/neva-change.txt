Hoes ain't callin' 
 The cocaine rock 
 World keep spinnin' 
 The block stay hot 
 The block stay hot 
 The block stay hot 
 World keep spinnin' 
 Thank God for the game 
 My TV screen off the chain 
 My bitch, she off the chain 
 I came from the grain 
 The sidewalk chalk 
 The block stay hot 
 Paranoid, the cop that keep my gear in park 
 Pull me out the car to give me black thought 
 But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player 
 This shit my mama flavor 
 This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now & Laters 
 Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor 
 Grew up just like your daddy 
 Packin' baggies in alleys 
 To where the streets is your family 
 Gettin' blurred by the same cop 
 Go to jail for a year and come home 
 Two of your niggas dropped 
 You know how that feelin' feel 
 What to feel when it's gettin' real 
 More bullets to go around 
 Come jump in this water, nigga 
 You still with your mama livin' 
 30 with no ambition 
 Your kid got no pot to piss in 
 You sayin' some nigga fake 
 You're selfish and sad, nigga you're lame (and go on) 
 You hatin' on another man's success 
 Because the nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse 
 You got the game all twisted 
 You're leechin' worse than these ladies 
 Your inner nigga ain't aging 
 Reason the hood stay shady 
 Who you do when you want? 
 Boy think you got this 
 No one here, on your own 
 Stuck in the same spot 
 What do you do? What do you do? 
 Hoes ain't callin' like you want 
 Only ones you got passed 
 No one here, on your own 
 Stuck in the same spot 
 What do you do? What do you do? 
 Hoes ain't callin' 
 The cocaine rock 
 World keep spinnin' 
 The block stay hot 
 Really with it forreal 
 We fuckin' hoes forreal 
 Gettin' paper forreal, nigga 
 I play for the bills, nigga 
 I really sold pills 
 Smokin' weed for my ills 
 Breakin' weed in my whip 
 Just got an ounch on a bitch 
 Still our motive be commas 
 And still my life isn't promised 
 Still nervous as drivers 
 You see them lights get behind us 
 They pull me out for my priors 
 Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire 
 You say that footage a liar 
 They want my flow in the dryer 
 I'm at the top aimin' higher 
 My lawyers stay on retainer 
 When white folks point the finger 
 Place my neck on that hanger 
 Shit, no wonder we riot 
 Niggas still killin' niggas 
 Child support killin' niggas 
 Cops enslavin' us niggas 
 Little girls killin' mothers 
 They treat their kid like a brotha 
 Fathers stuck with them lifers 
 Kept it real with his niggas 
 But left his kid for the sucks, shit no wonder we bang 
 Damn shame, mane, some things will never change 
 Who you do when you want? 
 Boy think you got this 
 No one here, on your own 
 Stuck in the same spot 
 What do you do? What do you do? 
 Hoes ain't callin' like you want 
 Only ones you got passed 
 No one here, on your own 
 Stuck in the same spot 
 What do you do? What do you do?
