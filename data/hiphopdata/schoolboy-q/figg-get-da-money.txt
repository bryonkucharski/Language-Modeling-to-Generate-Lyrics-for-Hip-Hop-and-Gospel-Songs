The flow, is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics

 Better yet the drug era that used to be a ball player 
 See how things evolve later, 4 Lokos for the young locos 
 Niggas cashing my check for white tees 
 Don't fuck with Melrose, just Metros... PCS's

 Put her in the gas station, hiding from the white and black 
 They gotta make a living, so they put us on our back 
 But why they gotta judge us when we do it back? 
 Mickey D's and Burger King still make sure that my daughter fat

 Been coming to this store for years, the cops come behind me 'bout a snack 
 But thanks Ms. Han, Jackie Chan, Sake bomb

 Write my niggas doing hella years past time 
 Ballers got it cracking, cracking at the crack of dawn 
 Ice cream truck stop for my mom, but me he won't respond 
 Gotta read between the lines, best believe I'm off of crime 
 This must be the longest line, where they cooking worse than swine 
 Lying on their letter signs, but hurry 'cause they close at nine 
 But Pisces got it jumping at the taco stand 
 Rapping on them corners, a.m., p.m., like the Taliban 
 Camping out, your daddy selling money he can understand 
 Drizzle riding through the hood, junkies love the Avalanche 
 Homeless person gotta shuffle cans 
 Take 'em up to the recycle bin, take his bread to the candyman 
 But still he eat, tell me if that ain't hustling
