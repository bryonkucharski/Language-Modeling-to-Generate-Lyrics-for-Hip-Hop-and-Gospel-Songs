(Strolling in the park) 
 Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me 
 You need a gangsta baby, just tryna give it to ya 
 (Walking in the dark) 
 A groovy nigga that's way too G 
 (Tryna tell you baby!) 
 He might say 'cause but he ain't fucking with 'cause 
 Yeah I'm Q, but you can call me Quincy 
 If you want or whatever baby, it's all love 
 Fuck all that rapping, let me talk to you 
 Book you a ticket so we can kick it 
 Make an escape somewhere we'll be safe 
 Close your purse, I got my Visa on me 
 Pick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey 
 Take off my saboteur, wipe your nose for ya 
 Climb a mountain in the snow for ya 
 You see these dummies always cut you lose 
 But so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two 
 I pay attention, I can listen too 
 You say he fucking who? Fresh out the shower, let me smell your hair 
 Garnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets 
 Let me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it? 
 From a lost child to a woman 
 Eye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip 
 (Strolling in the party) 
 Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me 
 Just tryna give it to ya 
 (Walking in the dark) 
 A groovy nigga that's way too G 
 (Tryna tell you baby!) 
 A 5'3" stallion 
 Daddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian 
 I don't see the challenge 
 Of having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance 
 I told her light that candle 
 I heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples 
 Yo ass is like a handle 
 See us on the front page, that'll be a scandal 
 Take off this red shirt, then my flannel 
 I need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals 
 Hit the coochie like a dime sack 
 Ain't those Gucci, didn't I buy that? 
 Close your eyes, go and try that 
 You only live once and I know I got you soaking wet 
 Is the liquor store open yet 
 I need some moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint 
 Back shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation 
 In the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch 
 (Strolling in the party) 
 Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me 
 Just tryna give it to ya 
 (Walking in the dark) 
 A groovy nigga that's way too G

 Underground Royal 
 Flow over they heads, air duct 
 Upper crust, toast bread 
 Talk of the town, thinking you know everything 'bout 
 A nigga cause them bitches talk loud in them beauty shop 
 Gossip before your man came get ya 
 YouTube clips can't show it all 
 Come and get down if you really wan' get up, baby doll 
 Ain't nobody 'round to judge, go on 
 Get if off your chest, vent, come up out that dress, bitch 
 She ain't take offense 
 Proceeded to take hits of the pregame twist, smoke out, smash 
 Grub a little bit, pass out, post-game events 
 Too high to find the remote, fell asleep to a infomercial 
 Woke up in her mouth, reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel 
 OG my strain, rarely do I blaze purple 
 Some of them growers be in a rush fucking the game up 
 You gon' learn about all that stuff long as you hang around us 
 Go on roll up 
 (Strolling in the party) 
 Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me 
 Just tryna give it to ya 
 (Walking in the dark) 
 A groovy nigga that's way too G 
 (Tryna tell you baby!)
