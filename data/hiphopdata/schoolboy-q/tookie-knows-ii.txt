Oh, we might die for this shit, nigga 
 Uh, might go down for this shit, nigga 
 Gang, gang bangin' that Crip shit 
 Niggas said 'cause in the first grade 
 In the shade where the cops can't see us 
 Eighteen, tryna dodge the cage 
 It was cool till that gang sweep 
 Now I'm in back of a van 
 And my wrists got a band 
 Got a number for a name 
 No name on the visit, no card get accepted 
 Now I'm forced to a man 
 Murder raps, where you from? 
 Put the nigga on his pockets 
 Watch the COs, they be watchin' 
 Counting noodles for the hustle 
 County spread for the muscle 
 Couple marks on my knuckles 
 Puttin' niggas on bunk status 
 Shoulda been with the bitch ass 
 Now he on a mattress that we bench press 
 PC, get the Fruit Loops 
 Keep tellin' on niggas 
 Why I fuck with that nigga? 
 Nigga made bail but I'm still at rage 
 Should I thank God for the hell I raised? 
 'Cause the nigga that snitch is gonna feel that grave 
 Like, ain't nothin' to a locc, huh? 
 Went missin' to his folks, I ain't in, I ain't know, huh? 
 They ain't show up to the court, huh? 
 But then charges gotta go, huh? 
 A young nigga back on Fig 
 H-crown on wig 
 Shoe strings say where I'm from 
 On probation and got my gun 
 Other side goin' for that thumb 
 Motherfucker, I'm gangbanging 
 Nigga I'm blue'd up, blue Chucks 
 Blue tee, nigga I keep it G 
 Nigga, in the streets is where I be 
 I'm up like breakfast while niggas sleep 
 Me and Floyd posted on Fig 
 Getting it in and movin' it out 
 Getting it in and movin' it out 
 I'm holdin' the heat, he's watchin' the block 
 I'm watchin' for cops, I'm holdin' these rocks 
 Fiends keep comin', this shit don't stop 
 When it's war time, niggas get popped 
 We might die for this shit off tops 
 My nigga gonna ride for this Crip, no lie 
 But I ain't dead, yeah, nigga, thank God 
 Money got niggas lookin' at me all odd 
 Punk ass niggas better go get a job 
 Run up on me wrong, bitch, nigga get popped 
 I'm gon' ride for this shit, on Crip 
 A nigga gon' die for this shit then trip 
 4/5th extendo, with fifty in the clip 
 TF by my side, he stupid with this shit 
 Q in the ride grippin' on the fifth 
 Run up on me wrong 
 My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, I'm gang banging 
 Uh, might go down for this check, nigga 
 Uh, I might die for this set, nigga 
 I ain't trippin' nigga, I ain't slippin' 
 Niggas lyin' sayin' I ain't Crippin' 
 Back to back, me and Tiny smack 
 I said back to back, straight cups of 'gnac 
 Niggas ask, what he signed for? 
 I got an eight ball, I got a Rondo 
 I got an AK when that bitch spray 
 It's like pullin' strings on a lawnmower 
 Last time I seen jail, nigga 
 I was cell livin', getting mail in it 
 I ain't even talkin' mail, nigga 
 Pay-pals for the cell, nigga 
 Hit the streets and cause hell, huh? 
 School of hard knocks, fuck Yale, huh? 
 See me and Traffic like a orca nigga 
 And the black and whites love whale watch 
 Front line like mailboxes 
 5-12, that's the numbers on it 
 May first, May deuce, May twelfth, members only 
 .45, no numbers on it 
 Scratched down, I'm strapped down 
 Might go down for this shit 
 If I don't then I'm racked down 
 Rank up there with Shaq crown 
 I got a Benji button like Brad Pitt 
 I press that, I'm gettin' rich 
 I might go down for this shit 
 We might die for this shit nigga 
 Might go down for this shit nigga 
 Gang, gang bangin' that Crip shit 
 We might die for this shit nigga
