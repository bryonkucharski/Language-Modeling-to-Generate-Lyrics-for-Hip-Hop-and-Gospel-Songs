Big willy, I'm fuckin' whores 
 Since a youngin' grabbed the pistol, skipped the chores 
 Hit the weed and said "It's on" 
 Got with my older Loc's they threw your boy a zone 
 Before my mom could smell the scent that shit was gone 
 Movin' on to bigger things now, don't call my phone 
 Carry chrome, I think them boys after me 
 But I shoot fast like athletes 
 Number one Magic flipper, I'm Anfernee 
 Oops, threw a couple at your coupe 
 Mr. Hard-top, don't fuckin' lose your roof 
 Smashin' on a 110 
 Empty most of the clip, shit only got one sin 
 Where's Waldo at? Put this bitch to his lens 
 Got the dimes all wrapped, on his block like you're still friends 
 Still low from the po-po, no L's in the Volvo 
 Mask on catch a photo when my glove's wrapped around the 4-4 
 Caught a statutory rape cause the steak wasn't mature 
 I'm laid out by the lake, you lay with inflatable mates 
 I lace my shoes tight and ready for the paper chase 
 I like my girls with African bodies and Asian face 
 Only green M&M's placed in my dressing room 
 Pineapple juice, roast turkey 
 If I want, I got a bitch to suck a thirty dick circle 
 Then hop up in a cab, this just to serve a bitch purple 
 Come back, make rice for the fellas 
 Every single person rockin' leather 
 Cheddar attatched, my mental is hatched from the medicine cabinet 
 Rock a shirt, got the pattern of the wilderness habitat 
 I make kids, NFL ready 
 Yours are 23 wearin' bibs slurping spaghetti 
 Your family cancer took her tits off 
 Don't even look us in the eye 
 Spit the shit to make a lesbian cry, dyke
