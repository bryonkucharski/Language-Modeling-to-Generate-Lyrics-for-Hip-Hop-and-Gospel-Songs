Now it's time to make our mind, oh babe 
 I don't feel a thing 
 You got the right one, 2 step 
 Can I rock with ya? Can I smoke with ya? 
 Tryna give you an upgrade 
 Cherry bottles to your shapes 
 Take my debit and go cray 
 Spend, spend every dollar, all way 
 Turn your closet to a driveway 
 Your old nigga was the old days 
 Broke times in a broke place 
 Teary eyed with the pout face 
 You can get it how you want it, my love 
 Small shoppin', hope a hundred thousand enough 
 Benz, Benz, want the rims on the truck 
 Girl you livin' a no, stay in the goat 
 Whatever you want 
 Hey! Cribbo in the Hills 
 Table full of bills 
 Dollar dollar bills 
 Whatever you want 
 I can make it real 
 We, we can split a mil' 
 Prolly sellin' pills 
 Dollar dollar bills 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 West coast, Cali love, whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 Good weed and pain pills 
 Big boy, we bringin' in big mills 
 Every dollar dollar bill caught wheels 
 Crib in the Hills if you call us, Net, chill 
 Fly around the world, girl you livin' or not? 
 We used to run from the cops, now we buyin' the blocks 
 Started ballin' like I said I would 
 Came up in the game I love 
 If you backed it you must get cuffed 
 So cold with the cobra love 
 Now I'm never in the hood enough 
 Had to get up off my ass to get it 
 Want it, pick it, tag, clip it, yeah 
 West coast, Cali love, you can have it all 
 Palm trees, bomb weed, whatever you want 
 Middle age millionaire, you can have it all 
 Sleeve gold, bankroll, whatever you want 
 Hey! Cribbo in the Hills 
 Table full of bills 
 Dollar dollar bills 
 Whatever you want 
 I can make it real 
 We, we can split a mil' 
 Prolly sellin' pills 
 Dollar dollar bills 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 West coast, Cali love, whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 I don't need your money, honey 
 I just want your love 
 Make it, tasty, nasty, crazy 
 Give it all you got 
 Diamonds last forever, baby 
 Look at what we got 
 I don't want your money, darling 
 I just want your love 
 Diamonds last forever, baby 
 Look at what we got 
 I don't want your money, darling 
 I just want your love
