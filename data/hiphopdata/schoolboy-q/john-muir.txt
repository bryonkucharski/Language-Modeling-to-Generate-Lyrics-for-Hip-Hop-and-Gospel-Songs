Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
 Never had a mothafuckin' weed card 
 I'm down to flatline a nigga, never been soft 
 Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
 Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
 I was thirteen with my mothafuckin' heat, y'all 
 Nigga caught cases tryna take your fuckin' screen off 
 I could put your fuckin' life on the recall, uh, yeah 
 Lookin' for the bitches with the ass 
 Got an ice chain 'cause a nigga gettin' cash 
 Three different pagers blowin' up because I'm crackin' 
 Tryna turn a dollar to a million, ho, what's happenin'? 
 O-orange laces, for my shoestrings 
 Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string 
 Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville 
 Hoover with my mothafuckin' locs still 
 Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend 
 Ghetto bird hit a kid like ghetto hoop dreams 
 Tryna strike me out before I finish school 
 I was just a square nigga till I took my 52, oh, yeah, ay 
 Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all

 We love, we go 
 We rise, we low 
 Our pride, we show 
 We love, we go 
 Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all 
 Tryna get this mothafuckin' weed off 
 Gang injunction tell me where we can't go 
 Shoot me in my back because my afro 
 Heard I got a stripe on my record then it's true 
 Cops effin' at my record, never told 'em what I knew 
 I was in my nigga car garage, yeah, I'm tryna shoot 
 I was out here sellin' dope at 14, what it do? 
 I was out here fuckin' hoes at 14, what it do? 
 I was ditchin' class, fifth grade, yeah, I'm Groovy Q 
 Ain't no biggy when the small nigga rob, gimme loot 
 Pop a nigga on his mom's porch, kill his brother too 
 Nigga lost his first fade nine years after school 
 Nigga tryna get the Js, blue Chucks sick as flu 
 Runnin' from the crash unit like my name was State Farm 
 On my nigga's handlebars tryna get our groove on, yeah 
 Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
