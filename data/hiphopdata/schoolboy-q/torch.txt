Blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face 
 Blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face 
 Blank face, blank face 
 I'll trade the noise for a piece of divine 
 Uh! 
 This that "Fuck the blogs" 
 The afterbell, we hang in halls 
 Underage, smokin' weed and alcohol 
 Grandma sweeped shells out the driveway 
 One of the homies got slayed so we bang at the King parade 
 I can take you spots where gangsters walk 
 The real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close 
 Where the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked 
 Now she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Hoe, mane 
 I ain't been right since out the cervix 
 I know a M can make it perfect 
 It came through more than the one I worship 
 You know I never lie, the truth be told, the dope, it gettin' sold 
 He got the runny nose 
 Summertime, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes 
 I swear the hood low, as the burner get rolls I follow the city codes 
 My money short 
 Missin' the days of honey oats 
 Dollar bills in mama's coat 
 Cartoons and bubble soap 
 This be the realest shit I wrote 
 This be that ride that hunnid spoke 
 Red and blue from head to toe 
 Who needs a mothafuckin' friend? 
 You see them mothafuckin' rims 
 Met the devil in disguise 
 Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 Look at my eyes, look at my block 
 Look at my zip, code 
 Bustin' these nines, true to my life 
 Word to my pen so 
 Take what you want, get what you like 
 Open that window 
 Ain't that simple? 
 Ain't it that simple? 
 Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 Vision impaired by the high 
 No cares on my mind 
 Couple dares, that is fine 
 This shit from 'round the back house 
 More baggies bagged and that roach 
 In granny's plastic suede couch 
 Best play cat and that mouse 
 A minor pitchin' in major 
 Stay servin' dope but we cater 
 Take you back to my Sega 
 Slammin' bones on that table 
 Runnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's 
 Forced to grow to a man 
 Before L.A. had them Rams 
 Went to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal 
 Lungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store 
 My haters came for the better and money came for the loads 
 Concrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold 
 Fucked up the game with many flow 
 I've been a loc since embryo 
 I'm ten toes, you movie role 
 I do this shit for lifers way before 
 Jehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke 
 Got so many bodies the world knows, shit 
 Don't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath 
 But our dreams was big, homie 
 The world done flipped on me, took my soul then clicked on me 
 Who needs a mothafuckin' friend? 
 You see my mothafuckin' rims 
 Met the devil in disguise 
 Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 Look at my eyes, look at my block 
 Look at my shit, cold 
 Bustin' these nines, true to my life 
 Word to my pen so 
 Take what you want, get what you like 
 Open that window 
 That shit raw 
 Ain't it? That shit raw 
 Look through my mothafuckin' eyes 
 Vision impaired by the high 
 No cares on my mind 
 Couple dares, that is fine 
 My picture was in full frame 
 But my vision had distort 
 My memory is okay 
 But my feelings on point 
 I could be here all day if you let me go, go, go, go 
 Oh lord! 
 You don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold 
 No lord! 
 I see faces at my window 
 My patience growin' short 
 I had no one to lend on 
 That's why that chip is so cold 
 Kinda like the cool king on my fallen bros 
 Oh lord! 
 Guess that's my curtain call, my last go 
 Ain't this shit what you wanted to see? 
 Ain't this shit what you wanted to see?
