Blank Face, tre 8, kill everybody, fuck an AK 
 Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates 
 Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off 
 Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off 
 Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang 
 Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids 
 Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty till the shell break 
 Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face 
 Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways 
 Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then 
 Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone 
 Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin 
 Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on 
 All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone 
 Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' till all the weed blown 
 Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone 
 Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, ugh 
 Groovy Tony, no face killer, I see the money right, ugh 
 Blank Face, clear everything out the safe 
 Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too 
 My heart an igloo, the devil in all blue, huh 
 Die now go to heaven or bring 'em through 
 Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you 
 And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits 
 Pistol through your Civic 
 Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit 
 Drive slow, oh, hey 
 Hit the curb with shattered mirrors 
 Look around now you're hellbound, boogie down 
 Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou' 
 Smack a nigga with the heat 
 Contradicting, now you peace 
 Leave you triple six laying in defeat 
 Can you dig it? 
 Struck a match, they won't finish 
 Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped 
 Squeezing fingertips, aye 
 Blank Face, tre 8, kill everybody, fuck an AK
