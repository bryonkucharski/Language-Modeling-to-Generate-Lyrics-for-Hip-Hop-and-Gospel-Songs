Preacher told me don't set trip on a Sunday 
 Knowin' damn well that there'll get you laid Monday 
 Lord have mercy 
 Please Heaven's mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Please Heaven's mercy 
 Never, ever ever get caught tellin' on my niggas 
 I'm a gangbanger, deadbeat father and drug dealer 
 When the money and fame gone, tell me who stayin' with you 
 Runnin' from God's creation 
 Shakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces 
 Snake eyes keepin' my back achin' 
 Dirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage 
 Still hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage 
 Guess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be 
 But bein' real never once bought the groceries and 
 Top told me keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully 
 And hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work 
 This workin' affair was better than bullet holes in my shirt 
 The demons hate when you make it and stay alive 
 They'd rather see me down under than see me fly 
 Lord have mercy! 
 Lord have mercy 
 Please Heaven's mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Please Heaven's mercy 
 They say I was a wanted man, a wanted man 
 Runnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand 
 They don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man 
 Comin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand 
 Damn 
 Lord have mercy
