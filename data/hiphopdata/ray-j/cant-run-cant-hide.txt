Can't run, can't hide (you can't run) 
 You know you can't get away 
 I often wonder who you know 
 What you thinkin', where'd you go, baby 
 Your mother done told you more than twice in your life 
 You can't keep runnin' away, you can't keep hidin from yo man, it's all right 
 You got me thinkin', thinkin' 
 I don't really feel the same 
 You should be thinkin', thinkin' 
 Losin' you'd be a shame 
 So baby baby come around 
 Can we talk at least before the sun goes down, baby 
 Can't run, can't hide 
 You know you can't get away (can't hide) 
 Can't eat, can't sleep 
 Till ya know you got your lovin' today 
 You can't hide what your feelin' 
 When you're dealin', with my love (with my love) 
 I often wonder, what you say 
 Or when I'm not around, but I'm hear to stay, baby 
 I've paid the time, I've paid my dues 
 And now its bout time that we had some rules (baby) 
 Stop hiding from me, ignoring 
 (The situation at hand) 
 Let's stop pretending, you hear me 
 (Let a man be a man) 
 So baby baby, come around (oh) 
 'Cause we can work it out before the sun goes down (whoa yeah) 
 Can't run, can't hide (can't get away) 
 You know you can't get away 
 Can't eat, can't sleep 
 Till ya know you got your lovin' today
