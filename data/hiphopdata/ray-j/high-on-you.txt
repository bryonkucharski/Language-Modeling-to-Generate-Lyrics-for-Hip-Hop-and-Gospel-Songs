So high 
 So high 
 Girl let me say that 
 I like everything that you do 
 Can't hide from the feeling 
 That I get when I get next to you 
 Girl for me the only thing on my mind 
 Is to know that you're for real 
 And when I imagine your pretty smile 
 It only confirms what I feel 
 And I am 
 High on you 
 So high on you 
 And I can only hope that you feel it too 
 I'm high on you 
 So high on you 
 Tell me you feel it too 
 Now this might sound crazy 
 But I dream about you all the time (all the time) 
 Cause you are my baby 
 Cause you are my my baby 
 And to me you're a perfect sunshine, yeah 
 Girl I cherish the moments alone with you 
 And the loveliness of your embrace 
 And when I imagine your pretty smile 
 It only takes my breath away 
 So high on you baby 
 So high on you girl 
 Let me show you baby 
 And I'll give you the world 
 I'm high on you so high on you 
 Tell me you feel it too
