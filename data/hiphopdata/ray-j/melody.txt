Yeah, Melody 
 I just wish that I could hold you 
 While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano, 
 What is that sound it sounds so beautiful 
 And I just wanna be close to you 
 Close enough that I can feel you 
 I'm already wondering where you are 
 And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar. 
 Melody, said that I love you 
 Melody, said that I adore you 
 Melody, said that I need you 
 You can call me foolish and I might be but I'm in love with a melody. 
 Donnie and Stevie they can write you 
 Now you come humming in my write too 
 As the music's playing in my radio 
 I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful 
 It makes me wanna just embrace you 
 Your close enough that I can taste you 
 I know just where you are caus your right here next to me. 
 (Chorus till the end)
