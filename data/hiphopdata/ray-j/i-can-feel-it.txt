Took away my soul, start 
 Changing all my clothes 
 I can feel it 
 Found out all my calls 
 Tried to take control 
 Of my feelings 
 (Listen) 
 I guess is time now 
 Time to say goodbye now 
 Makes me wanna cry but 
 Gotta make it out right now 
 All tha things that we've been through 
 Just couldn't figure it out 
 I thought we told the truth 
 But guess it was all a lie now 
 I change my number 
 Take down all of our pictures 
 I'm always in the club now 
 Drinking a lot of liquor 
 I had to put my 
 Engagement ring on a dresser 
 Thought I found my girl 
 Guess I still never met her 
 Took away my soul, start 
 Changing all my clothes 
 I can feel it 
 Something wasn't going right) 
 Found out all my calls 
 Tried to take control 
 Of my feelings
