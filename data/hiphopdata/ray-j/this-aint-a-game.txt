Ray J and Dark Child 
 What is it you want from me 
 I'm tired of playin' games baby 
 Do you think 
 That I would sit around and play the fool 
 When its really up to me 
 Basically do what I please 
 And you think 
 That your the one controlling everything 
 At first I was so big on you 
 Then you strated to change 
 You begin to play these games 
 Never thinkin' you would be the one to lose 
 Now your tellin' me what your gonna do 
 I'm tellin' you to tell the truth 
 But you see I'm through with you 
 'Cause you tried to play me 
 And that just ain't cool 
 If I owed you 
 What would you do do 
 You thought that I'd be 
 So caught up in you 
 You thought that I 
 Couldn't do what I had to 
 But this ain't a game 
 Now you tell me who's playin' who you 
 Thought that I would be some kind of fool who 
 But I jus go and do what I had to 
 But his ain't a game 
 I duno what makes you think 
 I would be the type of guy 
 Who would be 
 So forgiving after dark baby 
 If you wana play with me 
 Always messing with my head maybe 
 You'd be 
 Spending the best of your life with me 
 Now that you know that I'm 
 Not the one to play 
 Keep my respect n I'm 
 Over you 
 I don't understand why you 
 Play to lose 
 I can't believe that you 
 Would play me 
 You had me fooled 
 Thinking I could put my trust in you 
 But you jus can't show me you 
 Had the best of me, so baby plz 
 Stop thinking that you could handle me
