 I noticed she was sexy 
 'Cause she's an independent woman 
 She used to drive a Toyota 
 Now she's in the doodle drop top Phantom 
 She's so sexy, I swear this no lie 
 She got swag, got cash, she's so fly 
 She came in with no man, I don't know why 
 'Cause by the end of the night you know she guard out 
 So I look her in the eyes 
 Tell her I could have a peek and hide in the skies 
 Yes she might be fun, but she a freak under the skies 
 When it's dark she could light up the night 
 She's so sexy
