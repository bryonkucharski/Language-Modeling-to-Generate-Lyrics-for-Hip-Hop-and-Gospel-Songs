She might move on to rappers and ballplayers 
 But we all know I hit it first 
 I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I had her head going north and her ass going south 
 But now baby chose to go West 
 We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em 
 I know that I hit it the best 
 Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind 
 And I gave her that really bomb sex 
 No matter where she goes or who she knows 
 She still belongs in my bed 
 Going hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies 
 Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG 
 Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie 
 I did that first so everybody know me 
 She might move on to rappers and ballplayers 
 But we all know I hit it first 
 I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 Steady on at the top where we finna be 
 Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy 
 Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave 
 I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity 
 First come, first served is all a player know 
 But I don't wanna be a player no more 
 That's a lie, I'm way too fly 
 I love anything with ass that walk by 
 Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her 
 She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers 
 Tia's and Tamera's, I be knockin' sisters 
 And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her 
 When I walk in the function 
 You already know I'm leaving with something 
 Girls know when I'm coming 
 I give a girl real proper loving 
 She might move on to rappers and ballplayers 
 But we all know I hit it first 
 I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 And if you were to come back to me 
 Girl I know just how you'd do me 
 And if you were to come back to me 
 Girl I know just why you'd choose me 
 And if you were to come back to me 
 Girl, I'll get it wet -- jacuzzi 
 And if you were to come back to me girl 
 We'll make another movie 
 She might move on to rappers and ballplayers 
 But we all know I hit it first 
 I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first 
 I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on 
 I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on 
 I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on 
 I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on
