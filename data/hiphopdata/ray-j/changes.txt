If I ever give you all of me (if I ever) 
 Just a piece of me that you can see 
 Will you ever make a change for me? 
 A change in you is a change for me, baby 
 I said you ought to make a change 
 Find a way to love yourself 
 Open up your heart and mind 
 In there, you will find 
 The key to a new life 
 The words "I'm sorry" 
 Are said a thousand times 
 But what's it going to take 
 For you to change your life around? 
 If you truly want to be happy 
 Then recognize in yourself 
 There's a true gift from life 
 The truth in life 
 It just a piece of me that you can see 
 Will you ever make a change for me? 
 Change in you is a change for me (oh yes) 
 Take a longer look at yourself 
 Find the hidden truth and let it exhale 
 Let me lead the way (uh oh oh oh) 
 Can you evasion all the things that I see? (oh oh)
