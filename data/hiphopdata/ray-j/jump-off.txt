I know we ain't talked in a while give me a minute 
 I've got somethin' on my chest to get off I need you to listen lord 
 It got me trippin' lord 
 I'm even sippin lord 
 Can't get it off my mind 
 Can't even sleep at night 
 I tried to talk to mama all my friends and my pastor 
 No one gave any good advice so I'm gettin' at ya 
 Because I'm so confused I don't know what to do 
 Like comparin a Bentley to a Honda can't compare the two 
 I don't know how it got like this 
 But I know that it's serious 
 Choosin' who to be with 
 Leaving me sleepless 
 Oh can you help me 
 Better yet tell me girl 
 One girl is my jump off 
 One girl is my wife 
 I done fell in love with both and I can't decide 
 So tell me what to do 
 'Cause I don't know which one to choose 
 I just don't know 
 I was scared I was fallin' too deep off with my pimpin' 
 If I kept on playin' Russian roulette with all of these women like 
 I guess I broke a rule 'cause I ain't play it cool 
 But that ain't no excuse cause that's just what I do 
 Or either that you were tryna teach me a lesson 
 To appreciate what I got or recognize the blessin 
 And so I see it now 
 And plus I'm bleedin now for you to show me a sign and help me figure out 
 I'm in the worst situation 
 I mean I love my wife 
 But I'm in love with my jump off, too
