Yeah (15x) 
 She was a precious lil girl 'n' such a pretty lil girl, now she's grown up to a women 'n' she used to be my lil girl. her daddy don't like men, he barely likes girls, n yeah she always listens to him. that's why she's trapped in both worlds. she goes to church on ever Sunday, but she's a freaky lil girl. n what she does to me on Monday. you wouldn't think she was the pastors lil girl. 
 Late night we always do it downstairs in the guest room. n yeah her momma knows everything, uh but wit her pops it ain't cool.

 She said she wanna get wet, so lets sex in the rain. n she say fly high so lets jet to a plain. n this might sound insane but I don't even know her name. by the way that she swang, you can tell she do her thang. graduate with honors 'cause she got that good brain. speed it up slow it down, 'cause she like that good pain. if that clouds ain't out you ain't even gotta complain, throw a stack in the air bet that kinda feel the same.
