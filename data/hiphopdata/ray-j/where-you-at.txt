 My cherry red shirt and my Anaheim fitted 
 Nigga throwin' up the beat, baby came to get with it 
 Soon as I got a meal, I got a zone 
 Got a couple cribs, all brand new homes 
 Smokin' and poppin' pills, it's how we goin' 
 My cherry red shirt in the club gettin' loaded 
 Bitch I'm a baller, but I ain't hopin' 
 I'm up the courts in a view so movin' 
 And we can confirm that (with the whole west coast) 
 'Cause my nigga DJ Quik brought this beat funk music

 Nigga throwin' up the beat, baby came to get with it 
 I'm in cherry red Chucks, Anaheim fitted 
 Brim low, drive by, tell 'em Anaheim did it 
 Game the banger, part time slinger 
 Half time hustler put soap on a hanger 
 Let it damp out, khaki suit flamin' like a camp out 
 Game on the track I'll blow the fuckin' amps out 
 Game bang while I drive, pull this six tramp out 
 X-Games in the hood bring the fuckin' ramps out (where you at?) 
 Gameboys on the block, 'til they see the Vans out 
 Three dollar X pills, call that shit a handout 
 She know that sex sells so she got her ass out 
 But we ain't buyin' nothin' but Patron, bitch pass out (where you at?) 
 Where I'm at in the hood on D's 
 5 years after I was in the hood on Keys 
 Rockin' that 80's hat, like where the haze at 
 Red rag in my right pocket and I stay strapped 
 Where you at? (I got it)
