Yo, yo this one's for you boo (yeah), ha ha you know what's up, been drivin' around in 
 My car wit the windows down just think about you, I'm trippin'. 
 From the way I introduced myself, she knew that I was stakin wealth 
 She wasn't in it for the dollars she had doe herself 
 I pulled up in my dirty ass Lexo, girl I've been workin hard so what you expect yo 
 She smiled and laughed and just that fast the way she made me feel had me trippin' man 
 I think I felt this way befo', but see that girl wasn't feelin' me so dat don't count yo 
 This mommy that I'm talkin' bout she kind of light brown yo, 
 The type to make me wear my seat belt and say baby please drive slow, 
 Her ex man she (pause) she had to let him know 
 She don't need yo stress now 'cause she know I got dro, 
 I think Ray J's the one you should 
 Fall fo' you have no idea how good I'll make ya feel, 
 Everything will be great and I'll always keep it real, 
 So hop up in the driver's seat and dip on these chrome wheels 
 She's takin' control, control of, me 
 She's takin' control, control of, me 
 She's got me open and it's so deep 
 And I don't know what to do about it baby 
 She's takin' control, control of, me 
 She's takin' control, control of, me (she got me goin' crazy) 
 She's got me doin' things I can't believe 
 And I don't know what to do about it baby 
 I can't fake it love, 'cause every time I open my eyes I picture me and you wakin' up, 
 She alway's teasin me doin' that sexy stuff, now it's goin' up and down and down and up 
 Sometimes she wears weaves and got a nice round butt, 
 She like to smoke weed and not talk to much, 
 She let me be me and not givin' a fuck, and maybe one day 
 I'll get her finger froze up, will see when we get older (older), 
 But now I'm doin' it Prince style 
 With the mink fox on my shoulders, "Heat" tucked in my tux pushin a VT ?, 
 She's always on my mind that's why I know she's controlin' me, 
 She like's kissin' and holdin' me 
 And she real cool with my Moms and Brandy, 
 My Pops and the rest of the family, that's another reason 
 I thought she was right for me
