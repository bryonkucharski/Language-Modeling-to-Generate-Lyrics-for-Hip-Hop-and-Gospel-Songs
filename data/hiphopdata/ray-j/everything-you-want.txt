Hey, who is that (laugh) 
 Better calm down around here 
 Hey girl, whatever you want... I got 
 Hey yeah 
 (Everything) 
 Everything you want from me (I want) 
 I'm gonna give it all to you 
 Baby if you please, tell me your desires 
 Of your heart (your heart) 
 One thing I can see 
 You're in need of lovin' 
 I can give it to you (hey, hey) 
 Don't lower your expectations 
 So you can say that you're just- 
 Someone in love 
 Baby, 'cause in my estimation 
 You should get all that you want 
 And it's my pleasure just to give it to you 
 Everything you that you want from me (from me now baby) 
 I'm gonna give it all to you (hey, hey) 
 Everything you that you want me to be (me to be) 
 I'm gonna be there just for you 
 Girl, it's a possibility 
 That you've been lonely for too long (too long) 
 Well I've got remedy for your frustration 
 In the words of this song 
 This song baby 
 Come closer my love, I'm already near 
 To keep you satisfied 
 It's me that you need 
 You can get it all from me 
 You don't have to worry 
 'Cause I'm gonna give it to you 
 Everything that you want from me (I'm gonna give it baby) 
 I'm gonna give it all to you (to you) 
 Everything you want me to be (oh yeah) 
 I'm gonna be there just for you (for you) 
 Everything that you want from me (just want to know about my love) 
 I'm gonna give it all to you (baby can't you see whatever you want me to be) 
 Everything you want me to be (want me baby) 
 I'm gonna be there just for you 
 Hah ah 
 Whoa whoa 
 Everything 
 Everything 
 The love you deserve (yeah) 
 All you want in life (want in life, baby) 
 You are the one, only in my eyes 
 And that's enough for me to say - baby 
 (Chorus (repeat till it's fade))
