 Let me talk to you about some deep shit

 And she loved it 
 We share affection 
 Special connection

 She'll never leave you 
 And you can sleep better now that you know it 
 And I'm not here to 
 Take your position

 You don't beat it right 
 Makin' love is cool 
 Just pull her hair sometimes 
 She wants to feel like a lover 
 Not a touch from a brother 
 She wanna wake up body achin' 
 Not fall asleep fustrated 
 She said she loves it home 
 Its just somethin' sexy 'bout me 
 Though all the haters so

 That she'll always be safe with me
