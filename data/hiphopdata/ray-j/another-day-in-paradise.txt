(Feat. Brandy) 
 She calls out to the man on the street 
 "Sir can you help me?" 
 It's cold and I've no where to sleep, 
 Is there somewhere you can tell me? 
 He walks on, doesn't look back 
 He pretends he can't hear her 
 He starts to whistle as he crosses the street 
 Seems embarrassed to be there 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you 
 And me in paradise 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 She calls out to the man on the street 
 He can see she's been crying 
 She's got blisters on the soles of her feet 
 She can't walk but she's trying 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for 
 And me in paradise 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do 
 Oh lord, there must be something you can say 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for 
 And me in paradise 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 You can tell from the lines on her face 
 You can see that she's been there 
 Probably been moved on from every place 
 'Cause she didn't fit in this 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for 
 And me in paradise 
 Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 Just think about it 
 It's just another day for you and me in Paradise 
 It's just another day for you and me in Paradise 
 It's just another day for you and me in Paradise
