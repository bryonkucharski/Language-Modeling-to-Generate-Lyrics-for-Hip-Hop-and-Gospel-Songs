 I was just a young boy, 
 Raised out in Carson, 
 Ambla Elementary, 
 Principal Dr. Larson, 
 Me and my godbrotha, 
 Tyrin Davis, 
 Walkin' down the hallways, 
 He got all the ladies. 
 I was just a nappy head 
 Livin' on the 9 block, 
 'Ready went to Bedcross, 
 I was at the chronic spot. 
 Did a lil' rooster 
 And my homey shantwain- 
 And the homey Big B 
 Put me on the game. 
 The big homey solo 
 Told me not to bang. 
 He told me don't put 
 My career to a shame. 
 But I did, anyway, 
 And I got in trouble but 
 I had the hookup on the hundred dolla double ups, 
 My nigga E-dog... he had the flow, 
 And when I snuck out my window, 
 I used to go smoke up his endo.

 My dad was always at Church 
 Working in his office, 
 And my cousin Ryan got a 
 Scholarship to college. 
 Everything start happening 
 All so quick- fast 
 I got on a TV show 
 And started to make cash, 
 My sister's on the radio 
 Banging through the stereo, 
 I remember when we used to go 
 Skate at Skate Depot, 
 Damn those were the days, 
 Things just ain't the same, 
 And to my little homey D-O, 
 You gotta be careful in this game.

 Put my city on the map 
 That's why I do it back 
 First time I held this track

 Oh, I used to take the circuit bus 
 To the Carson mall, 
 To go buy cans of spray paint to 
 Hit up on the walls, 
 I was young and dumb, 
 I was livin' crazy, 
 But thank God for my family, 'cause 
 Man they really saved me, yeah, 
 {Oh-oh, oh-oh

 To everybody in my city 
 That remembers good times, oh oh,

 Just to hug a few friends, oh oh,

 On the block around ten, Oh oh,
