Knock Out 
 DogChild 
 Years and Feelings 
 Hopes and Wishes 
 How many of them we share 
 How many of them we dare 
 To show, To Grow 
 Promise not let it go 
 Now look, what we become 
 So gone now, And I don't even get it 
 How a love like ours could fall apart in one minute 
 I'm sleeping in a happy home 
 The next minute, I'm walking out an open door... 
 And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off 
 Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry 
 Wanting to be together 
 But this feeling getting worse 
 Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is 
 2 days ago I felt like a star 
 2 hours ago just lost my heart 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 It's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 Now I remember when I first knew ya 
 And I was all that had on your mind 
 Did I ever mean anything to ya 
 Or was I just something you did to pass the time 
 Cause now you won't hear me out 
 You ain't even tryin' to work it out 
 But I ain't going back 
 And even though I'm scared 
 I got too much pride 
 So I'm in my ride... 
 And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off 
 Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry 
 Wanting to be together 
 But this feeling getting worse 
 Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is 
 2 days ago I felt like a star 
 2 hours ago just lost my heart 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 It's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 What you gonna do when you miss my love? 
 I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love 
 I thought what we had was real 
 And the pain is all I feel... 
 What you gonna do when you miss my love? 
 I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love 
 I thought what we shared was real 
 And the pain is all I feel 
 So I'm Driving... 
 And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off 
 Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry 
 Wanting to be together 
 But this feeling getting worse 
 Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is 
 2 days ago I felt like a star 
 2 hours ago just lost my heart 
 Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel 
 It's all I feel, it's all I feel
