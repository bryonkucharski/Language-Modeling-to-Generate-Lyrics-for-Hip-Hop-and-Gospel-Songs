I don't wanna be right 
 I don't wanna be right 
 I don't wanna be right 
 I rather live 
 A lonely life 
 Everyday I wake up 
 I still think about the past 
 I would wake-up in the morning 
 With the same clothes on my back 
 I would take the money 
 That I made 
 And give it to my dad 
 I was present on the block 
 But I was absent in the class 
 Ooh 
 So hard for a young brother 
 I hardly saw my self 
 And barely 
 Every saw my mother 
 I got in trouble every-day 
 Because I loved the drama 
 Didn't understand how 
 My first name had changed 
 To brandy's brother 
 I grew up 'insight' of you 
 Everybody know I was a fool 
 Red laces in my tennis shoes 
 I blow money 
 On my dead homies funerals 
 The critics say 
 I'm out acting a fool 
 I'm tired of being excused 
 I'm putting out these sex tapes 
 I'm just living my life 
 Just because I'm making money 
 And my chain so bright 
 I make the night time day 
 Cause my wrist so light 
 I don't wanna be right 
 I don't wanna be right 
 I don't wanna be right 
 I rather live 
 A lonely life
