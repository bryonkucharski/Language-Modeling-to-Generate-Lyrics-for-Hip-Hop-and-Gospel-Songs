(Feat. Brandy) 
 (Verse 1 - Ray J) 
 My brothers and sisters 
 Here some courage and some wisdom 
 As you go on life's mission 
 Hope you make the right decisions 
 Although life's just an illusion 
 People get lokced up 
 Some start using 
 While the government is recrutin 
 They trainin more soldiers to go out and do it 
 But when the war is over 
 You wont have to worry no more 
 When the war is over 
 You wont have to cry on my shoulder 
 (Verse 2 - Brandy) 
 When we need it 
 It's time for freedom 
 No more voices 
 We can beat em' 
 Stand together fight the struggle 
 Take our justice to another level 
 Your mistakes please don't repeat em' 
 All your goals you can achieve them 
 When they tell you no don't believe them 
 All your enemies you can defeat em' 
 (Bridge - Ray J & Brandy) 
 (Ray J) 
 We just gotta walk away 
 And pray that it will be okay 
 Know there will be brighter day's 
 See when you little kids get older 
 Think of what your elders told ya 
 Remember all the fallen soldiers 
 When the war is over 
 (Brandy) 
 Everything is meant to be 
 It will all go down in history 
 Just be proud of your family 
 When the war is over 
 Well we're gonna make it through 
 Forget about the things we do 
 I just want peace with you 
 When the war is over
