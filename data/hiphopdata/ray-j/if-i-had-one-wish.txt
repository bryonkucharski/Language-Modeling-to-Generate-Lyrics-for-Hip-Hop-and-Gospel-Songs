Damn baby 
 I just don't understand where we went wrong 
 I gave you my heart 
 I gave you my soul 
 I gave you 
 As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first, 
 It was about 8 years ago 
 Don't act like you don't know. 
 We were sitting at home in your momma's living room, 
 Cause, (We couldn't be alone) 
 See your mamma knew I was something else, she knew how I felt. 
 Back then we were in school, 
 And that sure thing didn't excuse, 
 Growing up I was a fool, 
 And I can't lie I'm missin' you 
 Listen and don't trip, 
 Think I need a bottle with a genie in it. 
 Here's my wish list, 
 (First one), I would create a heart changing love 
 (Second one), I'll take your lift and lead on 
 (Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, 
 I'll, be okay if I get one 
 If I had one wish, we would be best friends 
 Lovin' never end, 
 It would just begin. 
 If I had one wish, you would be my boo, 
 Promise to love you, 
 Trust me I'll trust you. 
 If I had one wish, we would run away, 
 Making love all day, 
 Have us a baby. 
 If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, 
 Can you be my wife? 
 Make it right this time. 
 If I had one wish, 
 One wish, one wish, one wish. 
 One wish, one wish, one wish. 
 One wish, one wish, one wish. 
 One wish, one wish, one wish 
 And tell me is this the only way I, 
 Can get you right back in. 
 If so, then search and I'll go, 
 Then I can have you for sure. 
 Then you'll be loving me, 
 Holding me, 
 Kissing me. 
 So girl don't tell me what, 
 I'm feeling is make believe. 
 I swear if I lose, 
 A second chance with you, 
 I wouldn't know what to do, 
 I'd probably check myself in, 
 To come kind of clinic, 
 I couldn't be alone, 
 Because without you I'm sick 
 Here's my wish list 
 (First one), I would create a heart changing love 
 (Second one), I'll take your lift and lead on 
 (Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, 
 I'll, be okay if I get one 
 If I had one wish, we would be best friends (we'd be best friends) 
 Lovin' never end, (never end) 
 It would just begin. (Starting here right now) 
 If I had one wish, you would be my boo, 
 Promise to love you, (promise to love) 
 Trust me I'll trust you. (I trust you) 
 If I had one wish, we would run away, (yes we would) 
 Making love all day, (it would feel so good) 
 Have us a baby. 
 If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, (oh yeah) 
 Can you be my wife? 
 Make it right this time. 
 If I had one wish 
 I don't even know 
 How we ended up on this road, 
 And even though we are grown, 
 Girl I just want you to know
