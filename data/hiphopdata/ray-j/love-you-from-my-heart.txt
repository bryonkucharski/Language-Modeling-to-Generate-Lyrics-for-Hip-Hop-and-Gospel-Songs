Well I know I'm only 16 
 But inside you mean the world to me 
 I know I may be young to you 
 But there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
 See I've had romance 
 Girl I'm very smart 
 I must have learned it much too soon baby 
 Because I'm torn apart 
 And baby you don't 
 You don't even see me 
 All you see is a young one 
 But I love you endlessly 
 And no other man 
 Is gonna love you the way I do 'cause I love you from heart 
 It don't matter how old I am if I love you from my heart 
 It would be easier if you feel the same when I love you from my heart 
 I don't understand if I'm a man what's keepin' us apart 
 'Cause it doesn't matter how old I am if I love you from my heart 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 I feel the way you look at me 
 And I'm not surprise 'cause I'm every bit of what you need 
 So what you gonna do 
 You better hurry girl before I'm taken 
 Games over my love you lose 
 'Cause I'm so tired of waiting 
 Repeat hook 
 Repeat chorus till fade
