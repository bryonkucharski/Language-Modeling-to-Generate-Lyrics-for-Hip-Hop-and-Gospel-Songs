 Good Thangs... Oh... oh yeah

 Sugar dumplin', you got me feenin for ya 
 In so many ways, that I can't remember my name 
 You got the ride, that I wanna drive 
 You got the groove that soothes with all good thangs 
 B-Section: 
 Ain't nothin' better than, when I hold you close 
 Ain't nothin' better than, the way you turn me on and on 
 Cause baby baby, you know you make it right 
 Each and every time I look in your eyes, I... 
 I just wanna do thangs 
 Baby not just anything but 
 Good thangs, good thangs to ya

 Baby not just anything, but 
 Good thangs, good thangs to ya

 Honey darlin', you got me goin' crazy 
 Cause everywhere I look, it's you that I see 
 I'm on a high, way up in the sky 
 Above the clouds where all the birds do fly 
 B-Section:
