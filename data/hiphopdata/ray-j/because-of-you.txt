Will not make 
 The same mistakes that you did 
 I will not let myself 
 Cause my heart so much misery 
 I will not break 
 The way you did, you fell so hard 
 I've learned the hard way 
 To never let it get that far 
 Because of you 
 I never stray too far from the sidewalk 
 Because of you 
 I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt 
 Because of you 
 I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me 
 Because of you I am afraid 
 I lose my way 
 And it's not too long before you point it out 
 I cannot cry 
 Because I know that's weakness in your eyes 
 I'm forced to fake 
 A smile, a laugh, every day of my life 
 My heart can't possibly break 
 When it wasn't even whole to start with 
 I watched you die 
 I heard you cry every night in your sleep 
 I was so young 
 You should have known better than to lean on me 
 You never thought of anyone else 
 You just saw your pain 
 And now I cry in the middle of the night 
 For the same damn thing 
 Because of you 
 Because of you 
 Because of you I am afraid 
 Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk 
 Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt 
 Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything 
 Because of you 
 I don't know how to let anyone else in 
 Because of you 
 I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty 
 Because of you I am afraid 
 Because of you
