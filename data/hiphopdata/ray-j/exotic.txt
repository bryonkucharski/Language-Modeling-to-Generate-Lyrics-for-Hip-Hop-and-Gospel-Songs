Is how I describe you 
 Your honest 
 You make me feel like I can trust you 
 Take advantage of my space and time 
 You're so romantic 
 You know how to make a man feel fine 
 You took me swimming in the ocean 
 Had me flying cross the coast and 
 You always keep me focused (yeah hi yeah) 
 You told me, you love me 
 And in my heart I know you mean it 
 And no one can come between us (yeah hi yeah) 
 All of the things that you said to me 
 And all of the things that you did for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 All of the things that you got for me 
 All of the things that you stop for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 You're so special 
 You're the type of girl that is hard to find 
 And you're so faithful 
 I'm proud to say that you're all mine 
 Now that were together 
 I know the real meaning of love 
 And when I close my eyes 
 I still know is you just by your touch 
 You took me swimming in the ocean 
 Had me flying cross the coast and 
 You always keep me focused (yeah hi yeah) 
 You told me, you love me 
 And in my heart I know you mean it 
 And no one can come between us (yeah hi yeah) 
 All of the things that you said to me 
 And all of the things that you did for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 All of the things that you got for me 
 And all of the things that you stop for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 So gone 
 Baby we going to shine like crome 
 I know you hate being alone 
 So I'm going to take you far from home 
 And girl 
 I know you wanna try new things 
 Like a photo in a magazine 
 Of me and you together 
 You gotta trust me 
 All of the things that you said to me 
 And all of the things that you did for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 And all of the things that you got for me 
 All of the things that you stop for me 
 All of these things just let me know you care 
 And you look so good 
 Yes you do 
 And it feel's so good 
 That somebody out there loves me to 
 And if anybody out there 
 Has been in love 
 Then it's easier to understand 
 When I say that she is the only one I'm thinking of
