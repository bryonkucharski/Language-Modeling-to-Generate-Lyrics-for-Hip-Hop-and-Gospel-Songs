 [Ray J] 
 Girl i understand if you say no 
 Cause once we started who knows where we'll go 
 On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop 
 But your hot Imma make you dance 
 On the floor to the pole baby either way it goes 
 On the pole Imma make you dance 
 On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop 
 But your hot Imma make you dance 
 In the middle of the night we be turning of the lights 
 Then 1 thing leads to another 
 1 thing leads to another [6x] 
 Don't look back once we blast off lets go 
 Cause once we get there were so out of control 
 On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop 
 But your hot Imma make you dance 
 In the middle of the night we be turning of the lights 
 Then 1 thing leads to another 
 1 thing leads to another [9x] 
 Baby come follow my lead 
 I'm takin off everything 
 And since I see you undress 
 Dress me I'll handle the rest 
 We goin in under the deck 
 Your body's under attack

 1 thing leads to 
 1 thing [3x] 
 1 leads to 
 1 thing [3x] 
 1 leads to 
 1 thing [3x] 
 1 leads to 
 1 thing [3x] 
 Leads to another 
 [Pitbull] 
 If it ain't one thing its always another 
 Word to abuela papi my mother 
 That's why 1 thing always leads to another 
 Mamita I'm raw like no rubber 
 Like no other now take cover 
 Little weapon with no cover 
 I wanna be your friend and your lover 
 1 thing leads to another [Repeat] 
 [Till end]
