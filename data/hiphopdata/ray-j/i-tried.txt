Damn, she crazy, and she done a whole lot too 
 She cut off my phone, 
 She stole my credit card 
 She turned my cable off 
 I swear she's driving me insane 
 She cut up all my clothes 
 Threw my shoes in the pool 
 She smashed up my new car 
 She is straight up acting like a fool 
 I tried to kick her out 
 I tried to set her free 
 But she just won't let me go 
 I done change all my locks 
 I threw away her keys 
 But she just won't leave me alone 
 She kicked my niggas out 
 Said they been spending too much time with me 
 She rearranged my house 
 And threw my numbers in the trash 
 She found out all my codes 
 Said were hoes been calling me 
 Went and killed my dog in me 
 She's in my crib 
 But I'm the one who's got to leave 
 I tried to kick her out 
 I tried to set her free 
 But she just won't let me go 
 I done change all my locks 
 I threw away her keys 
 But she just won't leave me alone 
 Shoulda listened to my father 
 When he said that she wasn't the one for me 
 Shoulda listened to my mother 
 When she said that she wasn't no good for me 
 Shoulda listened to my sister 
 When I know she wasn't feeling her 
 She put this spell on me and she just won't let me leave 
 I tried to kick her out 
 I tried to set her free 
 But she just won't let me go 
 I done change all my locks 
 I threw away her keys 
 But she just won't leave me alone 
 I tried to kick her out 
 I tried to set her free 
 But she just won't let me go 
 I done change all my locks 
 I threw away her keys 
 But she just won't leave me alone
