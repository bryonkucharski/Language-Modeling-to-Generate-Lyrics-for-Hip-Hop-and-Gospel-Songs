When a good good girl's gone bad 
 When a good good girl's gone bad she (gone forever) (2x) 
 You should be there girl 
 When I was in love, with you 
 Listen girl, I said 
 If I'm not here for love 
 What am I here for 
 Tell me baby, got me going crazy yeah, I'm like 
 Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when my heart is soul is so into you 
 Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew starts changing 
 Ooh if I'm not here for love 
 What am I here for?, you, oh baby, I said 
 If you didn't think it was love 
 What did you think it was? 
 Tell me baby, got me goin' crazy, I'm like 
 Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I've givin' all my lovin' to you 
 Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew starts changing (yeah) 
 (Shorty Mack) 
 Mommy nah, not at all 
 Papi's never forgiven yuh 
 I can only honestly say "I'm gettin' rid of yuh" 
 I pity yuh 
 Did it to only yuhself 
 So when yuh cryin, understand that yuh noosed ya self 
 When a girls gone bad, she's gone foreva 
 Betta say bye J, I'm undastandin that nigga 
 So all the Prada that I bought, you can keep that gold 
 But when I get to the pad, have your shit out the door 
 I'm Shorty Mack 
 (Chorus) fade out
