 This is that shit that make 'em all flip 
 They all wanna piece 
 Some keep a steady mind, some get geeked 
 Now what be the shit to make them niggaz think 
 When they ship come in, they ship won't sink? 
 Everybody you meet on your way up, you meet down 
 So if you burn a bridge, how you gonna cross town? 
 Think about it now, and cry later 
 A motherfuckin money maker so I die greater 
 And every time I get them visions in my head, everything is red 
 Gettin' high from the stimuli', very blurry eye dread 
 Said to be, Buck the B.D.B 
 When you smoke your sensimi' I hope you take out your seeds 
 And watch your back for them bitches who act shady 
 With another lady friend that try to serve you with gravy 
 Menage, I almost got caught, what could I say? 
 Fallin' for the lust I almost got bust Friday 
 But safely so, got about a Most High 
 Eased out yo, into some next bullshit I'm like 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Bounce to this 
 Bounce to this 
 Bounce to this 
 All my hip-hop heads 
 Bounce to this 
 Bounce to this 
 Bounce to this
