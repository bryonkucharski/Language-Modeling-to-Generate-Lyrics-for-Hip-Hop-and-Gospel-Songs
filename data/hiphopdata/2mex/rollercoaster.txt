She's my 
 Roller coaster so I hold her tight 
 She says, 
 "Take a ride" 
 So I 
 Hop inside 
 (Verse One] [Murs) 
 She said she never did it before 
 So we did it before 
 She changed her mind, because she seemed unsure 
 Pure 
 Ecstasy I gave her my legacy 
 Woke up the next mornin', and you know what she said to me? 
 "We only fuck. You don't really love me. 
 We never make love and that makes me feel ugly. 
 You push and you shove me, you pull my hair. 
 Grab me around the throat then you choke me and stare." 
 You stare at me like you hate me, so do you? 
 That look in your eyes seems like I never knew you 
 Like every other week I receive the same speech 
 'Cause she's feelin' guilty 'cause she really a freak 
 So when she's off to work, I'm makin' somethin' to eat 
 I sneak and put rose petals all over the sheets 
 Turn on some slow jams and we have simple sex 
 And the very next night we back to the triple X 
 She's my 
 Roller coaster so I hold her tight 
 She says, 
 "Take a ride" 
 So I 
 Hop inside 
 She puts her hands in the air 
 Like she's reachin' for clouds 
 But she won't sit down, 'cause she's screamin' so loud 
 [Verse Two] [2Mex]: 
 She's so hard to stay away from 
 My friends always say I'm dumb and that she's dangerous 
 But I'm so insane I trust my lust for her 
 Other girls are a lackluster blur 
 She wack, but I always end up thrustin' her 
 Against the wall 
 Fuckin' her should be against the law 
 The contradictions in her are the contradictions of us all 
 With that ADHD, I'm like, "Baby it's me. 
 Can I ABC/see you out of that baby tee?" 
 There's no maybe G, she's fuckin' crazy 
 And that's the fuckin' trick, that we be fuckin' crazy 
 I'm losin' it 
 I'm think she's startin' to phase me 
 Every time I leave her she looks at me like, "Save me." 
 She's my 
 Roller coaster so I hold her tight 
 She says, 
 "Take a ride", so I 
 Hop inside 
 She puts her hands in the air 
 Like she's reachin' for clouds 
 But she won't sit down, 'cause she's screamin' so loud 
 [Verse Three] [Murs]: 
 She's got split personalities, she ruined my life 
 It's like I wifed one chick and got two for the price 
 I really wanna leave her but I thought about it like 
 If I wanna break up, then I gotta call her twice 
 [2Mex]: 
 She's bi-polar, bi-sexual and buy's me issues of my favorite comics 
 When my sinks dirty she buys me Comet 
 Whatever I need, homie, she's on it 
 A woman like this, is rarely seen like Hailey's Comet 
 But then she changes up, just like a Coin Star 
 Tell me we're not goin' far like I don't even know who you are 
 And this ain't workin' right 
 When last night she complimented me of how I was workin' it right 
 Damn Sybil 
 Always givin' me mixed signals 
 Do you wanna be single or do you wanna be under my wing 
 Go away 
 If you're really going to stay 
 Stop tellin' me you love me and don't in the same day 
 She's my 
 Roller coaster so I hold her tight 
 She says, 
 "Take a ride", so I 
 Hop inside
