2Mex falcon gentle 
 The outcome is mental 
 Inner visions of anarchism essential 
 From inside the mouth of south central 
 Which side of your soul should I attend to? 
 Die in a rush never painted with a (?) brush 
 Just like you fearing god was my high school crush 
 Misunderstood up at the prom 
 Misunderstood up under a bomb 
 Still they deliver the silver sonnets 
 Shiver and quiver if you really were ever honest 
 Never was never really upon us 
 Forever was cleverly thrust upon us 
 Gray patients I stay ancient 
 Decayed saint ships 
 A vapor ray trips in the middle of arcade flips 
 In a way it's our art our came well equipped 
 I'm buying red don't die on your bed know that I am what's said 
 Code of Zion misled 
 For I am stormberg 
 Now conformist warm words 
 Torn disturbed the laughing sunrise 
 Collapsing lung size 
 Grasping rasping tongue tied 
 Robots can't feel it in here 
 Boy copy imperial theater 
 Lunar solburn balloon into the auburn 
 Crimson maroon the edge is all burned 
 Over done orange 
 Brothers and sisters over the sun 
 We will find the courage 
 To reconnect with the umbilical 
 To see corrected stand at the pinnacle 
 If you can memorize your own pin code 
 Then you can energize your within soul 
 My words of hope they tour the scope 
 Of what you think is hardcore dope 
 The assorted coats 
 Touchable figure heads 
 I'm on the payroll of un touchable bigger heads 
 I'm 3 secrets 
 From losing my life but maybe saving yours today 
 My rights and wrongs are expandable 
 Tonight's my songs are what I'm sending you
