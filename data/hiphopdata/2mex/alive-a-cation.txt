 Breath in the blessings 
 Excel all the guessing 
 Don't leave before the lessons lessen 
 Believe in your self and not a yeses essence 
 Stretching the limits of all our dream 
 While etching your image upon my screen 
 You love much better in person 
 Above my head I touch letters in cursive 
 I drug myself pack the knife 
 Then I hug my self-back to life 
 Even though I'm broke as ever 
 Hope this rope between our spirits never sever 
 I'm holding on tight 
 Singing these golden songs of light 
 Tonight broadcasting from all locations 
 This a world wide alive a cation

 Feel free to go nuts 
 Come battle the robots 
 Ill handle the no knots 
 Run until you have to start swimming 
 Have so much fun that you have to start singing 
 Don't mind if it sounds karaoke 
 Carry yourself over the finish line 
 Don't be afraid of the powers that climb over your mental towers 
 See its ok to be a silly teen 
 2Mex is everywhere like the legend of Billie jean 
 We can't afford to be innocent 
 Even if you're a hardcore militant 
 Put away the tazors and the radar 
 Throw away the lasers and the k car 
 Hug yourself out of your own salvation
