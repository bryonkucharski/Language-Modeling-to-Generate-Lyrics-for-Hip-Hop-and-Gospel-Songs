(A.k.a, a.k.a, the rugged child) 
 Microphone check, one-two, one-two, yo 
 Microphone check, one-two, one-two, yo 
 Microphone check, one-two, one-two, yo 
 Microphone check, one-two, 
 One's for the money 
 Two's for the show 
 Three's for ya hooker 
 But we all say, HOE! 
 My slang and my gang bows up the concrete 
 Like everybeing rocking 
 Don't sweat the technics 
 So you got beef 
 Narrow sony go get ya posse 
 'Cause I've got a mosse, when you wear haratchies 
 Then you hear me kicking as I own you, it's mad ruggie 
 The jump on my tip, but I taught nuff to naw it 
 'Cause I let the microphone spark right after dark 
 And be dropping mad skillz like my name was Pad Mark 
 The rebel to society 
 Everyone's trying me 
 Loking at me strange leave dim raid it'll mase me 
 Had I did something wrong go and my dumb 
 Brothers keep stressing, no shorties the one 
 To make it real snappy, and little nasty-nasty 
 Things get pawsie-pawsie 
 And of to be hax me 
 It'll little gone and still can hold you on, on 
 Microphone so keep licking on that wish bone 
 You had you're chans but you feld out on tune, 
 So you're hanging out with deuce, now you say that rock rues 
 You make me laugh as you're mom's get smoke 
 You get ain't like a taffy, and red like the chokes 
 Flow with the flow from the Wu-tang free-style 
 You catch yo bow-bow, And they're two's this wild, child 
 From the Staten the Island, the temple 
 Just an example how pop goes the pistole 
 One's for the money 
 Two's for the show 
 Three's for ya hooker 
 But we all say, HOE! 
 Here comes the shortie with the tec twenty two 
 But If you tell I'm gonna blast you 
 From the projects worst ghetto section 
 So my back but gun from protection 
 Shortie do-wa, more shoops and tupa' 
 Come and do with the Wu-tang hip-hop 
 Shortie wa-wa, shorts sniki sha-sha 
 Go-go, ga-ga, now you want me popa 
 I'm not a mack daddy or my daddy mack 
 Touch my napsack, boy you gettin' pitch smack 
 I've got a style may not be formilliar 
 It's like both way you're callin' round in a cosha 
 Who will be the next to flex and face death 
 Ashes to ashes, and only dust is left 
 One's for the money 
 Two's for the show 
 Three's for ya hooker 
 But we all say, HOE!
