Verse One: 
 I wake up to another day of life and wish I didn't 
 'Cause my records predicted a future of Bill Clinton 
 But I continue to do my thang to make a livin' 
 Fuck the police and Judge Brennan 'cause I ain't givin' in 
 I'm cops so say the notorious killa 
 Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga 
 Smokin' lye with an unidentified man 
 The feds believe it was a member of the clan 
 A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious 
 Fuck wit Delores I'm bringin' 50 crime bosses 
 From BK to Jersey niggaz wanna murder me 
 Ain't nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army 
 Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz 
 End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh 
 1 - Makin' green for the next man 
 Money ?strugglin plans for the dividends 
 Look in my eyes and tell me what you see 
 (Repeat) 
 Verse Two: 
 Same shit different day I scheme to make the paper 
 God dreams of livin' large makin' niggaz steal and rob 
 Fuck the pleadin Ill leave ya bleedin 
 If ya take to long deliverin 
 Dividends, see nigga, I'm menances like 8 sharp 
 Cracks on my moms china plate 
 Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate 
 Keep my eyes open 'cause po po they be keepin' 
 They tryin' to get locked on Friday and spend the weekend 
 Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin 
 So when I'm in the four buildin I'm hollerin Staten Island 
 With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th 
 The first nigga to fake a move is gettin' phillied with the quickness 
 I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life 
 It's a cut throat BI with mens who live trife 
 You Squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death) 
 I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left 
 And let's go to war I got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's 
 Straight from Haiti, Ill turn a nigga into gravy 
 And fuck the media ? ? put this on the news 
 'Cause it's so safe to know the notorious rulz 
 Repeat 1 
 (Fade)
