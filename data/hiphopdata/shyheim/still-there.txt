Hah, oh word up, this is one of them 
 Yo let me tell ya son 
 This one of them gettin' dick sucked type tracks 
 I'm tellin' you, in the closests or where check it out 
 Verse One: 
 What up boo, how life treatin ya girl 
 Hopefully you're takin' care of yourself out in the world 
 As for me, I'm mainting in this packed hell hole 
 Hopefully in the year 2000 Big Kane'll be home 
 My old school crew frontin on me cept for a few 
 It's a shame that jail had to make me feel the way I do 
 But it's all good, enough for me what's up wit you 
 You don't write or come and visit me like you used to 
 What's the problem huh Why all of a sudden you dissapearin 
 Now that I need you the most you actin' like you don't care and 
 It hurts my feelins but life must continue 
 I heard that Big Mark died please don't say this shit is true 
 If so that's fucked up oh tell my niggaz what's up 
 And don't get caught up in no bullshit and get sicked up 
 How is my seeds doin' I know they're crazy big by now 
 Tell 'em daddy loves 'em no matter what the fuck goes down 
 And Love Dark ha, he's a dead man walkin' for talkin' 
 To Jiggy Jake I'm puttin' him in a coffin 
 Ay yo I'm vexed so Ima end this little letta 
 So take care of yourself for worst or for fuckin' betta 
 Are you still there for me baby I need to know 
 You're one of the only things I got in this whole wide world 
 You're my whole wide world 
 (Repeat) 
 Verse Two: 
 All I do is party and bullshit 
 Fuck big chicks that's mad thick 
 Roll through the big city 
 In BM's and Cruiser Land's 
 But damn, it ain't the same without my fam 
 You niggaz understand 
 On New Years I drink beers and bust off heat 
 I'm in this little street doin' by any means to eat 
 You gotta get up get out and rob suntin 
 Ha don't let dem niggaz with that cream walk by that's right 
 I be shootin and stabbin, robbin niggaz whateva 
 For gold chains, rings, watches, diamond studs and leathaz 
 My peoples one love y'all stay bugged 
 Don't crimp your style none 'cause we thugs... foreva 
 Are you still there for me homiez I need to know 
 You're really the only thing I got in this whole wide world 
 You're my whole wide world 
 (Repeat) 
 (My cousin Tawana, rest in peace girl, you're my whole wide world) 
 I need somebody there when it's hard kid oh yeah yeah 
 When they bring the ruckus to me 
 You're my whole wide world
