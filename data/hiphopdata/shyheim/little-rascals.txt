This Bob Billiard for the Entertainment News 
 In the news today yoth rapper Shyheim AKA the Rugged Child 
 Is rapidly climbing the charts and making a lot of noise 
 Shyheim seems to be one of those little boy rappers 
 Who are making a lot of money. 
 Personally I don't think a little boy should get paid 
 Verse One: 
 Don't call me boy! (why?) Haven't you heard? 
 Boy ain't nothin' but a white man's word 
 As the old saying go- I could never forget. Boy plays a tarzan g-tuck quit 
 So call me Shy with the Ooh la la la 
 Kissin' young girls and I makes them hollar 
 Fortan can never be an orphan. New Yorkin' Wu-slang talkin' 
 So hump the mile as I walk the mile 
 The little rascal's bucked un-juvenile. I be the captain of dappin' of 
 Rappin' 
 How you scatchin' the cuts and the scratchin' 
 Not your average shorty 140 on the block 
 I got more props than your 1,000 cops 
 Stop! In the name of me. Like Denise Williams I gots to be free 
 To do what I want to do. Oh Shaboo 
 Here come the Little Rascals 
 One little two little three little rascals 
 Four little five little six little rascals 
 Seven little eight nine little rascals 
 Ten rugged rascals in all 
 Verse Two: 
 Gotta make a record to gain recognition, or competition 
 My posse is blitzin': I yell hooray! When they cross the barricade 
 Fuck the arcade- No games are being played 
 Sneaky little Shy from the streets of Staten 
 Somethin' shot me and my cousin cry Jason 
 Jason Jason- time for chasi' -girls 
 I'm on every case like Perry Mason 
 Step in they face and beg them for they number 
 Get the seven digits and now they like the roadrunner 
 Beep! Beep! Yo, things is gettin' deep. Takin' old does and coffee 
 There's no time to sleep. A tazmanian walkin' maniac 
 A young girl playing rap brainiac 
 So pump up the volume. For 10 balls you could have the whole album 
 Of the rugged- Child- Chi- Chi- Chi- Bow! 
 Little Rascal Style
