Yeah yeah, hah 
 Where all my niggaz at? 
 We up in here, what? 
 Word up, all my peoples 
 Crim-criminals in the penile 
 Where ya at? Cats sacking green 
 Bill/Hill Clinton 
 It be real when I pack a steel 
 Everyman for himdelf, send my love to a battlefield 
 Ain't no wack, it's a straight up fact 
 Or dip down in black once you hear the clap clap 
 Verse One: 
 Shit iz real, ain't no time to cash no butterflies 
 Pass the St. Ide's 
 Screwface is my disguise so look me in my eyes that ain't wise 
 The first chump that jumps is the first chump that dies 
 Raw, spell that backward that's war 
 Lay low scarecrow I'm knockin' at your front door 
 Pointin a pistol to your peekhole, pussy 
 Warning: my trigga finga gets busy 
 Blaow, a single shot straight to the headpiece 
 Decrease the peace and watch the murders increase 
 See I'm ruthless, pistol whip a nigga toothless 
 Me gettin' hit that shit is ludicrous 
 I'm on my P's and my Q's 
 Try to put your foot in my shoes kid, you gotta pay the fuckin' dues 
 I ain't the one to play Pammy 
 I leave the head all red like that little orphan Annie 
 I'm dressed in black like Streets of Harlem 
 Paddle punk's pockets down with no problem 
 And get away just like an Unsolved Mystery 
 You don't believe me G, check my pedigree 
 And you can feel how I deal with the muthafuckin steel 
 Ain't no game boy, it's real 
 Verse Two: 
 Shit iz real, I'm in some real shit 
 Niggaz wet up the lab, Ma Dukes got hit 
 Now they knew I was trying to give 'em what I owe em 
 But now I gotta act like I don't know em 
 The muthafuckers violated to the fullest degree 
 They did it smart, now they gotta see me 
 And I'ma flip like an acrobat, to give them bastards back 
 And let them know where my head is at 
 I pack a cannon, I know where them thugs be standin 
 Near the stores, with them Hip Hop whores 
 And there I was all dipped and fatigued 
 Goin' Rambo, G.I. Joe of a dolo 
 Droppin' bodies, bodies they was droppin' 
 Like rain from a blackman that went insane 
 They dissed my Earth I had to diss they whole universe 
 Blew up the block, stepped back and watched it burst 
 Niggaz was runnin', I was steady gunnin 'em down 
 They hittin the ground from the impact of the four pound 
 Some kids tried to dip in the whip, I emptied the clip 
 And watched a car do a fuckin' flip 
 Reloaded at the same time the car exploded 
 Spotted a Gangsta Bitch, told her to hold it 
 It only took five secs for she squealed, BLAKA BLAKA 
 Two shots to the twat, shit iz real
