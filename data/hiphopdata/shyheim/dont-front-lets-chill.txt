 1: 
 Baby don't front you know you want me 
 See it in your eyes you can't lie you know you want me 
 Give me a little time, Ill make you change your mind 
 I'm ready if you will so baby let's chill 
 Verse One: 
 Settlin' down is the last thing on my mind honey 
 No time to be all lovey dovey gotta make this money 
 So I can get my thug on and pimp the world 
 Shorty just hold on and Ima put you in girl 
 You're mad sweet and plus you look good like a mutha fucka 
 But Ima playa and not just a one woman lova 
 I'm all about skins, diamonds and G notes 
 I ain't tryin' to hit dis one girl now but you never know 
 Yeah ok but I wanna have your love tonight 
 And ya know that I'm gonna do you right 
 I know that romance just ain't a thang 
 But if you give me time we can do this ?here this way 
 2: 
 Is it good girl, as it really sounds girl 
 Or is it game that you're puttin' in my mind girl 
 I understand that you wanna spend time girl 
 Just keep it real and I wouldn't even mind girl 
 Verse Two: 
 Aiyyo I'ma thug honey, pushin a ? blue montero 
 Through the roughest part of any ghetto 
 Packin a you know just in case sum grimy fellows wanna touch my riches 
 Jiggy'll find 'em in many different muddy ditches 
 But is this the lifestyle you wanna live love 
 In a game with only two ways to get up at 'em 
 Dead or in jail and I ain't tryin' ta see neitha 
 Proceed to smoke the ? hold on tight to your heata 
 Make me a believa, that what you're sayin' is sane G 
 Would you catch a slug for me better yet die for me 
 Of course not, so don't act like ya would 
 Shorty rock just keep it real and it's all good 
 Word up 
 (1 den 2 again)
