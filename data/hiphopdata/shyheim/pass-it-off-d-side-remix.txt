(Feat. G.P. Wu) 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Shy] I got the loaded clip 
 [All] Pass it off and move it back 
 [DLR] I'm reachin' in my napsack 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Rub] Let me show you how 
 (All] Pass it off [echoes) 
 (Shyheim) 
 You better look out kid 'cause I'm the Wu-Tang's smallest artist 
 When I come through brothas be jettin like I'm narcotics 
 I'm the shorty that'll bust but yet I hit the hardest 
 When I rose up on ya squad just show me where ya heart is 
 You'll start to snitch like a bitch, cold drop a dime 
 I cut that ass short like a tree of alpine 
 But I'm not lumberjack, black and a matter of fact 
 I flip your stacks like two kilo's of crack packs 
 I let off quick like a four-fifth automatic 
 Who got Static like Spike Lee? I gotta have it 
 And I'm the bomb like a black leather jacket 
 I keep it movin like I did on my first LP 
 I stay true to The Grain of G.P. 
 Word to my motha I could never be a sucka 
 I Die Hard too, yipee-cahier mothafucka 
 (Down Low Recka) 
 Now it's the Down Low comin' through with the roughness 
 Technique, brothas packin needles can't bust this 
 Teflon style that I master, my art 
 Hit the chart, wait, combine with the track from the heart 
 I take shape and break, the best when they fake 
 Maneuvers, are natural born when into these losers 
 Ego bruiser, fly wiz chooser 
 Marijuana user, Valentine Hell enducer 
 Be too slick and sly for the guy with the best try 
 Brotha fake a move, ya gotta die 
 I got the loaded clip and I'm about to show ya how 
 We murder brothas style with the slang from the Shaolin Isle 
 Now... 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [DLR] I got the loaded clip 
 [All] Pass it off and move it back 
 [Pop] I'm reachin' in my napsack 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Shy] Let me show you how

 (Pop Da Brown Hornet) 
 It's about time to bust a cherry, or should I say a nut? 
 You can run if you want to, I'll still catch you in your butt 
 My aim is on point like a racist cop 
 And I get down and dirty like a project mop 
 If you're in between a crack I'll find just where you're at 
 Expose you, beat ya butt like no one knows you 
 I have no sympathy for no mouse MC 
 Once I snap you in my trap there ain't no turnin' back 
 I got you where I want you, that's under my wing 
 You ain't it, your wisdom treats me like a king 
 So please motha f'er with that premium choice shit 
 By the looks of things, I think that it's best ya forfeit 
 A true experience should be taken for a scroll 
 I'm big time baby, ya gonna need a centerfold 
 (Rubbabandz) 
 Murder, all I see is gats in my mind 
 Cock back ready for combat, pass the nine 
 I'm a mind blower, constructin boats like Noah 
 So I could never drown in this rap thing 
 I keeps it real, like Shaquille O'Neal on the court 
 You better recognize or get played like a sport 
 My flow's comin' down, somethin' terrible 
 Down pat when I be on the train ridin' R tracks 
 Styles is phat, contact, the lyrical smoke got me open 
 Infact, I think I'm ready to rock steady 
 I leave ya white like Betty 
 Froze you and plus you're not quick like Ever-ready 
 Oh shhh that clown just took the bait 
 And lost more blood then Nobra lost weight 
 Prepare for gladiation, I'ma slam the nation 
 It doesn't matter if you're Japanese or Jamaican 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Shy] I got the loaded clip 
 [All] Pass it off and move it back 
 [DLR] I'm reachin' in my napsack 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Rub] Let me show you how 
 (All] Pass it off [echoes) 
 (Shyheim) 
 Yo, the rhymes that I be kickin be the bomb baby 
 I be the bomb on this swarm, that's a fact I got it goin' on 
 What's that a doubt? I'm never on a lyrical drought 
 My mind out concentrated, so I let my long thesis out 
 And represent to the fullest, I don't be fakin 
 I shit you out of service like some bugged out Jamaican 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [DLR] I got the loaded clip 
 [All] Pass it off and move it back 
 [Pop] I'm reachin' in my napsack 
 [All] Pass it off I wanna flip 
 [Shy] Let me show you how 
 (All] Pass it off [echoes)
