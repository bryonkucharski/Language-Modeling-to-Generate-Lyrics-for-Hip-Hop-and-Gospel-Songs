One's 4 da money, 2's 4 da show 
 If you're clockin mad dough let me hear ya say - hoe! 
 (Repeat) 
 One's 4 da money cause you know that cash rules 
 And I'ma jack foolz till I'm rich like Scrooge McDuck 
 And I don't give a damn about da next man 
 I rhyme solo but always represent my Clan 
 Who real brothers who catch bodies in the broad day 
 Prepare for war 'cause it's on my brother 
 I'm loadin up my lyrical thoughts and I'ma slay your 
 As soon as I spot the imitator I'ma let off 
 And fill slang in his brain and then I'm gonna 
 'Cause it's every man for himself like a game of keyhole 
 And I got twenty one shots to unload 
 Who wanna battle I wreck a sucka brain like a hollow point 
 MC's get terrified when I step in the joint 
 Is it 'cause I be the dopest rhyme sayer 
 Original with my flavor, this razor's sharp like a saber 
 I come strong like the tide from the ocean 
 I gets props from the east and west coasts when 
 I drop hits like females do their underwear 
 I represent tray 6 pound days a year 
 I sware I knock a rappa teeth out 
 If his lips get loose smack 'em with my double duece 
 So who will be the next example for me to trample I found 'em 
 Now let me begin to kill 'em ... blooded 
 My flow kept flowin so his mind got flooded 
 Rugged neva smooth is how I always keep it 
 And if you really got clout come on let me hear ya speak 
 I'm on the track just like a match lights a fire at night 
 Keepin' it smashed like an intoxic driver 
 King of the rap empire, I mean the whole entire 
 Some brothers said that I got tooken out, dumb f'in liars 
 I stand my ground no matter who comes around please 
 My flow is the soundwaves that make noise overseas 
 Peep the stylez I free, Cause styles I freak 
 Turn this mix up in your jeep so people hear it in the street 
 And pay attention to this rugged adolescent 
 Or catch a buck 50 on your feet so in another section 
 Part of your body cause my jams be slammin' 
 Well then ya throw your burners in the air at an Onyx party 
 Smooth like picardi, but mellow like the Heineken 
 My thoughts is wild you can't understand 'em like africans 
 I lick the shot chic-blaw for all my peoples restin...
