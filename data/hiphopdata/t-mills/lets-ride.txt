Listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 I got a lot of things I need to figure out 
 Hop in the front seat and empty this grape swisher out 
 Cold in my blunt seat, never roll the windows down 
 Friends hop in, quick the trip is near started now 
 Four wheel coastin' 
 Goin' lean my seat back 
 Drunk driving music 
 Open up that six pack 
 I don't know what traffic is 
 They don't know where Travis is 
 Probably on the road where my camp, causin' havoc its 
 Summer time bitch 
 Picture me rollin' 
 I do what I please and I live in the moment 
 I'm just a young favorite 
 Hear my voice and savor it 
 The open road is much like home 
 And I love it like it raised me 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 I ain't stoppin' till I have to 
 Everybody buckle up it's gonna be a fast one 
 Yeah, I see those red lights 
 I'm finna go blast 'em 
 We all got that red I space side like NASA 
 Grip the wheel tight when I'm swervin 
 We just hot boxed the suburban 
 See the smoke pourin' out 'cause we burnin' 
 This is the shit you forget after learnin' 
 But you know who taught it to you first 
 Picture me rollin' 
 I do what I please and I live in the moment 
 We got all the time to waste 
 Bank accounts and half a tank 
 We movin' 
 We movin' 
 We on our way 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride 
 Just listen when you drive 
 Let the music get you high 
 And let's ride, let's ride 
 You can see it in your eyes 
 Steady cruisin' through the night 
 And let's ride
