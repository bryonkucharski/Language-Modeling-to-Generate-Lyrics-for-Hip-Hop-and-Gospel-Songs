(Yo! This is T. Mills and Jeffree Star BITCH!) 
 She had real nice style, and wings on her back, wings on her back, wi-wings on her back 
 She had swag like mine, and ones in her crack, ones in her crack, one-ones in her crack 
 She had a real fine ass, so I hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit-hit it from the back 
 And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat 
 I had my first stripper at the age of 16 
 Had me feelin' like the club was the place to be 
 I swear I couldn't wait till she got off the clock 
 So, we could go back to her spot and she'd hop on top 
 She would dance to rap, but listen to rock 
 We'd be fuckin' to Kiss 
 And then I'd switch it to Pac. 
 She would drive me around and pay for my shit 
 And I never got jealous of the dudes that she hit 
 I got private dancers in the VIP, champange rumor, co-workers were mean 
 Took me in through the back so I chilled till 3′ 
 And when the club closed, back to her W-Suite. HA 
 And I thought she was so right for me 
 Truth be told, spent every night with me 
 Talkin' on the phone, never tryin' to fight with me 
 I almost thought she would spend her whole life with me 
 She had real nice style, and wings on her back, wings on her back, wi-wings on her back 
 She had swag like mine, and ones in her crack, ones in her crack, one-ones in her crack 
 She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit-hit it from the back 
 And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat 
 Bitches love me like my name's Justin Bieber 
 Deep throat so good, give every boy a fever 
 Wake up every morning feelin' like P.Diddy 
 Why the fuck is there money in my grandma's pussy? 
 Legs around the pole, hickey marks on my neck 
 Cum say hey to my Hello Kitty cervexx. 
 I'm a rollercoaster ride, you know I'm good 
 Got with Adam Lambert, even fucked Tiger Woods 
 (Owww What?) 
 My mouth is V.I.P, weave like Beyonce, lips like Jay-Z. 
 I'm 'bout to do a back bender, make you go POP! 
 You wanna lick this? Lipgloss and Lollipop 
 Sorry, I'm so dirty, so d-d-dirty 
 Show me your wee wee 
 The fucky sucky fucky fucky happy happy ending 
 (Hiyah ... Whatever)

 And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat 
 I had, I had, I had those ones in my hand. 
 You had, You had, You had this need for a man. 
 I had, I had, I had those bills in my hand. 
 You had, You had, You had this need for a man. 
 You were so untamable 
 I Just had to figure you out. 
 I'm glad you let me figure you out. 
 You were different from the rest of them 
 You were better then the rest of them. 
 You were so untamable 
 I'm glad you let me figure you out. 
 I Just had to figure you out.
