Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Even stars burn out 
 It's funny how they hate, but I'm all they talk about 
 Doubts were a constant thing 
 I was in constant need of weed, constantly 
 Now my concert fee, has me never looking back again 
 All these people try to put me down 
 Tellin' me "you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it" 
 But I'm not breakin 
 All these people try to fool me now 
 Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?" 
 But I'm not slowin down 
 Switch on, once I get my rich on 
 I take a picture of my dick for them to put they lips on 
 I ain't no fast one 
 Last long 
 Get up off my fashion 
 How you talking shit for stalking pics of what I have on 
 Damn, change the subject 
 Cause lately I'm like fuck it 
 But it's funny how my haters ain't gonna say no shit in public 
 I got my youngins 
 And if you didn't hear it, it's motherfucking I'm gettin' 
 And anybody near it 
 That's the spirit 
 Get too close and I will lose you 
 Your mind is a powerful thing, do what you chose to 
 Just to make shit a little clearer, I know some fake motherfuckers 
 It's no smoke and mirrors 
 All these people try to put me down 
 Tellin' me "you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it" 
 But I'm not breakin 
 All these people try to fool me now 
 Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?" 
 But I'm not slowin down 
 People come, and people go 
 I'd like to think that I did this all, on my own 
 People come, and people go 
 Oh, people go 
 All these people try to put me down 
 Tellin' me "you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it" 
 But I'm not breakin 
 All these people try to fool me now 
 Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?" 
 But I'm not slowin down 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 But, I'm not slowin down 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 Smoke and mirrors 
 But, I'm not slowin down
