It came back around again 
 I never saw a thing 
 I used to be down and out but now I'm lovin' everything 
 Things ain't never been better 
 I ain't feel this good ever 
 I love being clever with every letter I used to send her 
 I've been waiting yeah 
 I've been waiting for a long time to finally feel like this because 
 I've been waiting yeah 
 I've been waiting for a long time 
 To see the things I couldn't 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I don't hear what they gotta say 
 I get mine, I get mine, I get mine 
 And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em) 
 They'll never know a thing (a thing) 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I love my life that I'm livin' 
 I could paint pictures so vivid 
 The places I stay 
 The things that I've seen 
 The women I've been with 
 I do what I wanna do 
 Be what I wanna be 
 Say what I wanna say 
 See what I wanna see 
 And can I talk honestly? 
 I'm not good with apologies 
 I've been waiting yeah 
 I've been waiting for a long time to finally feel like this because 
 I've been waiting yeah 
 I've been waiting for a long time 
 To see the things I couldn't 
 One: 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I don't hear what they gotta say 
 I get mine, I get mine, I get mine 
 And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em) 
 They'll never know a thing (a thing) 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 And these shoes have no sole left for walkin' 
 And my throat is on fire from talkin' 
 You say that I've changed, I'm the same 
 You say that I've changed, I'm the same 
 I won't give into your games 
 I cannot say that I'll remember your name 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I don't hear what they gotta say 
 I get mine, I get mine, I get mine 
 And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em) 
 They'll never know a thing (a thing) 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high 
 I don't hear what they gotta say 
 I get mine, I get mine, I get mine 
 And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em) 
 They'll never know a thing (a thing) 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I live high, I live high, I live high
