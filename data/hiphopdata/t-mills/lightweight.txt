 Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever 
 Put it on your tongue, taste that 
 And lemme get it from the back, take that

 Motherfucker, I see the same pussy your dad saw

 And gettin' paid while I fuck 'em with my vans on 
 She ain't a bitch like a lushie 
 But she a pro, she don't even need instruction 
 Light another one before the blunt ends 
 I want you, you want her, and your drunk friend 
 I wake up with no pants on 
 Ménage à trois in Paris

 And then I let her get her dance on 
 She let me bust on her face when her man gone 
 And she love to do gymnastics 
 So I tell her to come over and we practice
