I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this 
 Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 I could see what they like to do 
 Wanna see it go wrong for me when it ain't right for you 
 It's cool I keep my enemies close 
 Eyes wide open as I center the scope 
 Listen real well, don't be saying the most 
 Theirs one God, one Devil and I live with them both 
 Everybody don't fuck with you with the way you think they do 
 Only the lord knows what we been through 
 They want to drag me along, I'm in the studio working on every song 
 Tryna put a little peace in you 
 My biggest fears being right here next year selling y'all the same ass dreams 
 In the making of a movie that you haven't seen 
 In ten years you'll know what I mean, if anything 
 I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this 
 Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this 
 Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Look, I fucked around and got a deal for this 
 Sometimes I feel I'm too real for this 
 And the game so hype but I feel I'm to chill for this 
 Just want to make a couple mills and shit 
 See I'm tryna stay fresh in a world so filthy 
 Niggas of my own kind tryna kill me 
 Them boys in blue always trying to arrest me 
 But I still love life when I look at my prezzie 
 Man, swag shit like the NBA 
 Niggas want to make the league but they can't even play 
 Can't tell them that though, that's for certain 
 Nigga say he bored, then he just ain't working 
 See it's a nigga that grind and he putting in the time 
 'Cause he simply waiting on his season 
 And his pops got lock and his brother got shot 
 But they tell him to never stop believing 
 I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this 
 Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this 
 Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new 
 They gon' want something new, they gon' want something new 
 These niggas don't know what real is, know what I'm saying man? 
 I used to deal with the bullshit all the time 
 Grabbed the pen and I draw the line 
 A boss is mine, follow my steps you could walk in line 
 So come game it don't cost a dime 
 Well I guess this a letter to me 
 You can't do me better then me 
 Half of these niggas don't come with a soul 
 That's the reason they sell it for free 
 Pay attention to what you telling the streets 
 I won't live a lie nigga 
 Unhappy tryna criticize niggas 
 I'm alive nigga, watching niggas get high with you 
 'Cause they'll give you up for that dough 
 It ain't what it seem though 
 You complaining and you paranoid, you tryna make a scene bro 
 I ain't waiting for the green light, I'm bout to hit the gas through the red light 
 Hope you got your wings on, thoughts that you can lean on 
 Nigga!
