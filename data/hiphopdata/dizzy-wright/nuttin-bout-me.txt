 Right 
 I came in this world on my own and I promise I'm probably gon' leave here alone 
 Xhaiden my only concern she gonna learn how daddy turn up to a song 
 She hate when I leave and I'm gone so I gotta make time to FaceTime on the phone 
 Keep them happy roots and I'm not acting cute do what I have to do to stay strong 
 So when they hate I just smile about it, keep the Mary Jane around 
 I go wild without it (that's right) 
 Look, fuck what you think about me 
 Ain't no reason walk around like I'm down about 
 'Cause growing up I don't feel the same 
 And I don't know how everyone else deals with lames 
 I look at you while you reveal my name 
 Shout out to Big Will and Dame 
 We finna kill the game

 'Cause you don't know nothing 'bout me 
 Right 
 My city depending on me 
 I don't talk that shit just to defend my beliefs 
 You create your conflicts for the streets 
 And I knock the nonsense 'cause we praying for keeps 
 Grab some weed, grab my engineer, hit the studio 
 And tell that nigga that we staying for weeks 
 My album on the way nigga get ready 
 I feel like the rap game waiting on me 
 Hustle hard is a run the distance 
 Praying for my little brother with a son that listen 
 My mind lives on more than one dimension 
 It's a problem not a issue, you gon' learn the difference 
 Whatever my nigga I'm solid 
 I'm kicking back kicking my knowledge 
 We bounce like hydraulics (bounce bounce bounce) 
 Give it to them while they knowledge 
 So they can accept and allow it 
 Everybody want to be on 
 Couldn't find another me with a drone 
 You can try all you want, fly in the sky all you want 
 Taking blunts to the dome 
 Paying four double O for an ounce with the bro 
 Making sure the family tree stay strong 
 'Cause when them branches stop falling 
 These niggas start renting it and talking and acting like hoes 
 Don't act like these hoes 
 I ain't afraid of no man 
 That's not how I'm programmed 
 Can I get more grams? 
 Just marijuana, no Lindsay Lohan 
 But you don't know them 
 Look their I go passing judgement 
 I ain't perfect we can add adjustments 
 You mad for nothing 
 Bad for business, laughing at you, because you niggas making bad assumptions 
 But anyway
