Look, I put my soul in this shit 
 With this ink all in my skin 
 Think before you ink 
 I got this ink all on my hands, man 
 I'm growing up and I'm changing 
 Don't try to knock me out of my plans 
 You was bullshitin' 
 And my grindmode was giving it all I can 
 Boy I been down, reppin' Vegas 
 Had to show these niggas what's dedication 
 More than music, it's more than life 
 Been tryin' to figure out who gon' be the next to make it 
 Put in work and guarantee a show 
 Real nigga, you just a G.I. Joe 
 Believe I go see my bro from tryin' to get my real life looking like the T.I. Show 
 Man I swear to God I hate swearing to God 
 Tear the stage down I ain't sweating a jive 
 I'm looking good and I'm swaggin' out 
 I'm the next to blow and you the next to flop 
 Real nigga, I ain't scared of shit 
 Real niggas take care of shit 
 Wipe me down I like the crown 
 But when the mic is down this life you never get 
 I'm 21 and I'm drunk as fuck 
 Livin' life by myself (nigga) 
 Tatted up and I'm actin' up, no shirt better check out the belt (nigga) 
 Vegas raised, Vegas paid 
 Got up out that bitch to put it on 
 I'm the first to do it, show improvement 
 All I gotta do now is set it in stone 
 Hol' up (Hol' up) Hol' up did a nigga just swag like that (He did) 
 Hat to the back, Gucci backpack, spittin' crack on you little niggas 
 Spittin' facts like that 
 Coming out the Veg with a rap like that (He cold) 
 He cold nigga that's a fact 
 Trying to get me a platinum plaque 
 Kill this shit, A$AP the track 
 I can't trust none of these niggas 
 Can't trust none of these hoes 
 I'm killing shit 
 So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros 
 They talking shit but we talking goals 
 Gettin' money that's all I know 
 In this shit and I been the shit 
 And I did this shit all on my own 
 Don't let me get in my zone (my zone) 
 Don't let me get in my zone (my zone) 
 I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone 
 Boy, don't let me get in my zone (my zone) 
 Don't let me get in my zone (my zone) 
 I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone 
 They done fucked up, let me out 
 Stress me out, set me up 
 Mad as fuck, I got anger issues 
 And now you gon' feel 'em when you next to us 
 Vegas with me, shit evolved 
 Killin' niggas you don't wanna get involved 
 You barely good and my good is great 
 Compared to the team nigga we'll shit on y'all 
 Real nigga with swag (What?!) 
 How the fuck that sound nigga 
 All the fake niggas to the back 
 You ain't welcome round in my town nigga 
 Bogart and I'm so retarded 
 My social skills is over heartless 
 Niggas talking, bitches talking 
 Get to walking I don't hear no offers
