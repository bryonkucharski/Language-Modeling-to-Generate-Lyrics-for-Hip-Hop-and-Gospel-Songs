Hopping off my plane, finna grab my bag 
 Running on my main, 'bout to jump in the cab 
 She always be late, and she saying she trying to drive fast 
 She better not crash 
 Over here waiting on you sitting out of commission 
 She said chill out my nigga just kick it 
 'Cause Lord knows I don't need another ticket 
 Well I traveled the distance 
 Now I'm back home back in business 
 So I'm kinda impatient 
 So I'm a hit the weed man and make arrangements 
 I'm just tired of the waiting so my attitude is changing 
 She like stop the complaining 
 I swear I'm not leaving you hanging 
 We gon' pick up the trees, just sit in yo' seat 
 Okay, now you talking my language 
 I've been on tour for so long, adapted habits 
 Back home, now it's back to dabbing 
 Sorry if you saw me act dramatic 
 She told me relax the madness 
 How you acting? 
 She like fuck it you've been on the road 
 A nigga ain't one of them mo's 
 His motions is being exposed 
 But fuck it, in 24 hours I'm gone 
 Well I'm trying to be yours when you ain't right 
 Change flights through the lay overs 
 Came back and it's all good 
 'Cause you look good well you might as well stay old 
 Came back from a takeover 
 If you had a chance with me, well its looking like its probably too late for you 
 She said I understand what rapping do 
 But I ain't feeding off your attitude 
 And I'm a need you to 
 Calm down and let me get you high 
 See you looking for a reason to be mad, but I don't know why 
 Keep it real you been salty all day and you can't even lie 
 'Cause dawg you been complaining all day 
 I done ran out everything that I can say 
 I'm a need you to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 I'm a need you to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 Yeah you really need to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 'Cause dawg you been complaining all day 
 I done ran out everything that I can say 
 I'm a need you to calm down, relax a little 
 Maybe you just over thinking it 
 You fighting the old while you building a new 
 Go for that shit while you dreaming it 
 When you talk all that negative shit 
 Well I'm just like the people you got me believing it 
 Social media became a joke, and everybody became a comedian 
 But we in 20 1-4 and its funny 
 Wasting time is worse than wasting money 
 Tryna pay all my bills by the monthly 
 Until they get somebody to Michael dumb me 
 And we went from homeless and hungry 
 To getting this hot meal with these fries 
 Happy with the smallest things alive 
 Talking about bitch don't kill my vibe! 
 Imagine that, we got our own imagination, so me, I think big non-stop 
 Turning negatives into positives, it's kind of hard and its doing a lot 
 So what we do? We smoke our pot 
 Create some new, got to clear my mind 
 So I don't got to change the old nigga that I am 
 I just got to create something fly (exactly) 
 Keep calm when the bad attack me 
 Even when they nagging at me 
 Now I gots fans to back me 
 They been waiting on the grand finale 
 Me, I'm just living my word, smoking the funk and I'm speaking with value 
 Turn up the volume, finna hit y'all with a album 
 Till then I'm a need you to 
 Calm down and let me get you high 
 See you looking for a reason to be mad, but I don't know why 
 Keep it real you been salty all day and you can't even lie 
 'Cause dawg you been complaining all day 
 I done ran out everything that I can say 
 I'm a need you to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 I'm a need you to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 Yeah you really need to calm down 
 I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little 
 'Cause dawg you been complaining all day 
 I done ran out everything that I can say
