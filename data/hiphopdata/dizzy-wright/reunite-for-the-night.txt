This about to be a party 
 Tryna reunite for the night 
 This about to be a party 
 And we all like 
 What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you 
 Same girlfriend sittin' over there lookin' cute 
 Glad you found your talent and your putting it to use 
 What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you 
 Glad you in town, I ain't seen you in a while 
 You been holding shit down, keep making the city proud 
 And we all like 
 Momma let us rent out the crib, tryna reunite for the night 
 A couple bottles, everybody putting in on it, its about to be a party for the price 
 Where the folks I ain't seen in a while? 
 Heard you had a child, hope you turn that into a ring and a vowel 
 Momma and the daddy ain't together, but they going through shit 
 'Cause the momma caught the daddy sleeping around so she out 
 With the same homegirls that she used to call ratchet 
 Shut up Dizzy stick to rapping 
 I know, I ain't mean it I'm just making sure you looking through your glasses 
 I love to leave my friends laughing 
 We all came through, lets toast, drank, and smoke dank 
 Uncle Chewy only used to the homegrown 
 He sat back when the bone-bone 
 Ran thangs, he would smoke blunts with my momma while she did his cornrows 
 I'm just trying to bring life to the party, its 2014 where yo mind at? 
 Where you used to be, we supposed to be beyond that 
 It's funny 'cause I'm still dodging contracts 
 Looking at my life through a peep-hole 
 Can't bring time back, fuck it I'm a turn it with my people 
 Still moving at the right pace 
 Can't complain homie life's great 
 And we all like 
 What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you 
 Same girlfriend sittin' over there lookin' cute 
 Glad you found your talent and your putting it to use 
 What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you 
 Glad you in town, I ain't seen you in a while 
 You been holding shit down, keep making the city proud

 Yo Hoppa run that back for me, I got something fly I want to kick 
 No flights, no drama, just fans 
 Before this I ain't never give a damn 
 Who got some coke? 'Cause I'm a mix it with some hen 
 Who got a swisher? I'm a fill it with a gram 
 We at a party at the house going ham 
 My niggas like damn you on MTV Jams? 
 Man that shit so cray, I be smoking to your music every day 
 Brother you don't understand (that's the reason you my man's though) 
 Now we talking through a bottle 
 Reminiscing on Mr. Stellavato 
 Graduated school to give niggas something to follow 
 'Cause you could be here today and you could be gone tomorrow 
 Ain't nobody sitting on they own 
 Niggas singing songs playing beer pong 
 Its okay that we can't always do the right thang 
 'Cause I heard a little laugh can make you live long 
 How 'bout you fuck off instead of you tying to fucking up the day 
 Don't know who you trying to scare a wrong place 
 Since the tripping at the door with the next-door neighbors 
 Football without the gear on, Hennessy damn near gone and that explains it all 
 You better calm down and shake it off 
 Live by the three M's "Maintain, Mary Jane, Make Art" 
 And enjoys your days off 
 Can I get a amen? 
 And we all like 
 What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you 
 Same girlfriend sittin' over there lookin' cute 
 Glad you found your talent and your putting it to use

 Glad you in town, I ain't seen you in a while 
 You been holding shit down, keep making the city proud
