Turn my passion into my paycheck, they can't relate yet 
 He the hottest, well I debate that, 'cause I know you ain't bumping my tape yet (don't lie) 
 Getting high, where the vape at? A little something to ease my mental 
 Four Agreements on my Kindle, yiggity yuh, my design reminder 
 Going ham in the line to fire, never not working until I'm an expert 
 Success is a state of mind, and in due time, you gon hear my best work (what) 
 I'm strictly about my business, too many niggas is with that "let's work" 
 Tryna swim with the sharks without catching yo breath first (nigga wait a minute) 
 Dizzy gets down, nigga this is his town 
 When you learn how much you worth you will stop giving out discounts 
 Gotta quiet all of these critics, the most devoted in my division 
 They do it for the mentions, but I never trade respect for attention 
 Y'all don't hear me, demons near me, yes I'm on my own 
 A hundred songs that sound alike, you better get out yo comfort zone 
 Run along until I'm gone from an unsolved crime 
 Don't act surprised, yo state of mind gon change when I get a trial, that's why I 
 Picked up the yoga, put down the soda 
 My healthy mind, that's what's gon help me over 
 Life of a stoner, if you still concerned 
 I never lose, I only win or learn 
 It's all about your state of mind 
 Picked up the yoga, put down the soda 
 My healthy mind, that's what's gon help me over 
 Life of a stoner, if you still concerned 
 I never lose, I only win or learn 
 It's all about your state of mind 
 I told 'em it's hard to be the man that never gives up 
 Lightweights and so, but ain't nobody made it but us 
 See dedications a must, I'm up after you and before you 
 Whether you popping in this moment, or before me, I'm coming for you 
 Ignore the hate, you niggas ain't qualified to even be occupied 
 Don't fake the funk, we blaze the blunt, we never compromise 
 Focus, I'm bringing this funky shit in doses 
 With a ashtray full of roaches, ripping that real shit with emotion 
 My city say I'm the closest, so I'm open for new suggestions 
 My mind found all the answers, my heart switched up all the questions 
 Yo shit getting ejected while I'm out painting my reflection 
 The secret weapon respected from all the topics I be addressing (uh-oh) 
 From time to time it's hard to advise these niggas that's tryna rhyme 
 'Cause money ain't everything but yo state of mind become them dollar signs 
 Poison the planet, y'all feeding off all kinda lies 
 And these new slaves is mentally traumatized, y'all don't hear me though 
 We got on my shoulders, my purpose shows I deserve it 
 I ain't saying it's finna be easy, I'm telling y'all it's finna be worth it (preach) 
 When my time come I'm just tryna have my season like Mr. Yeezus 
 This my state of mind before The Second Agreement, better believe it, so I 
 Picked up the yoga, put down the soda 
 My healthy mind, that's what's gon help me over 
 Life of a stoner, if you still concerned 
 I never lose, I only win or learn 
 It's all about your state of mind
