(Wish Bone) 
 You can call it what you want to 
 Respect when we roll through 
 Fight like yeah, that's just what we bust through 
 Swear niggaz straight thugs 
 Really nigga rolled up 
 Laid out 
 Blacked out 
 Know niggaz fucked up 
 It don't really matter 
 They scatter 
 We bustin' 
 So fuck'em 
 Let 'em lay 
 I ain't really playin', niggaz playin' 
 Bone ass niggaz down, to me that shit is gay 
 Better than my black gauge too 
 Hear ya blountin buddy but my eyes on you 
 Watch that step, do what I gotta do 
 Gotta go fuck in my hotel room 
 Its about that money that money gotta have me some 
 Money 
 Or else 
 Hit a nigga to the white meat 
 Gonna get me some money 
 I ain't gotta tell, a nigga know 
 When you fuckin' with that bone better go for broke 
 It ain't really that serious betta let it go 
 Ain't no tellin' where that might might just might go 
 (Krayzie Bone) 
 You niggaz better wake up and smell 
 That marijuana in hell 
 That little gotcha 
 And realize ya dealin' with a monsta 
 Mastermind 
 I rap the crime 
 I blast ya mind 
 I'm so sick 
 But don't need to call a doctor 
 'Cause you won't find a cure for this 
 Besides I don't need no remedy, I'm already fixed 
 Nigga take a hit of this and you ain't never goin' back 
 To that wack shit 
 Y'all know what clique got the hits 
 Wait a minute 
 I'm sick of niggaz gettin' all the credit 
 For bein tough guys and ain't got the balls and said it 
 I read it little nigga when I seen him in the video 
 You can tell who really real on them really hoes 
 Just because you stack up hoes and some pretty clothes 
 Really don't mean you niggaz automatic criminals 
 You can fool that at a show 
 They don't really know 
 How a real nigga let the mutha fuckin' trigger go 
 We them thuggish ruggish niggaz that'll get in ya mind 
 With the reefer and the lyrics that a spit like a nine 
 It don't matter what we give em 
 It's a hit every time 
 But you that's bone 
 That's that bone! 
 (Kryazie Bone) 
 I told you nigga, you dealin' with a beast 
 From the streets of clevland, down with Easy-E 
 Niggaz give me a reason to keep that heat in the seat 
 But in my lap so I'm in position to bust back 
 (Wish Bone) 
 Guess who's back to shut the lights down 
 Screamin out thug and no you ain't none 
 Gotta do something 
 When we see we gon' run up on em, nigga gotta tell me 
 Somthin, somthin 
 (Krayzie Bone) 
 Take a journey to my violent side 
 The riots lie 
 Hit 'em with the silenced nine, a quiet mine 
 And still fuck the law, and any other nigga want to run 
 Up, come on 
 (Wish Bone) 
 And its easy it don't take much to make ya blow 
 Before you hear it you gon' feel it 
 Stay locked and loaded 
 Thugs like us they don't make it get it straight dawg 
 Get rolled up 
 They gon' like it when we roll off 
 (Krayzie and Wish) 
 Missed with the sawed off 
 Creepin' through the fog 
 All y'all niggaz die 
 Compitition dry 
 To see me wit a dollar 
 Gotta get it 
 Get with the lyrical killas from the 99 
 Spittin' when I ride ride 
 (Wish Bone) 
 Know what you doin' when you step, you can fall off 
 Hands up thugs comin' through when we raw dawg 
 Everywhere we go yes it's like that 
 Everywhere we roll strapped with black a thug ready to 
 Go... 
 We them thuggish ruggish niggaz that'll get in ya mind 
 With the reefer and the lyrics that a spit like a nine 
 It don't matter what we give em 
 It's a hit every time 
 But you that's bone 
 That's that bone!
