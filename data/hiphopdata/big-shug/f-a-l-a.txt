Fuck around lay around do or die (Repeat x3) 
 "You figgedy fuck around you lay around" 
 Word to Joe Frazier got ta do what pays ya 
 Give a nigga pain like displasure 
 But close your hips in nigga you can't win 
 I walk around with a scowl and a grin 
 Parties try to rock me chicks try to clock me 
 Niggaz try to block me but they can't stop me 
 I'm a bad man understand where I come from 
 Treatin' niggaz dumb, as I drink my rum 
 I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec 
 Put punks in check, Shug's on the set 
 I'm the one with the game, the twelve round 
 Crack to the concrete, from the underground 
 I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me 
 You cannot break me, so don't mistake me 
 For your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see 
 I did my time, and now I'm free 
 I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop 
 I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops 
 I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick 
 I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick 
 Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano 
 Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano 
 This is something you can't handle, here's one example 
 I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle 
 Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified 
 Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die 
 Fish niggaz, they get fried upon my skillet 
 I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit 
 And hittin' you blaow (BLAOW) so what you want to do now? 
 You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya 
 Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master 
 If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now 
 You know, like POW 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x3) 
 So fuck around, lay around, do or die 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2) 
 "You figgedy fuck around, you lay around" 
 Word to Mike Tyson, hit you quick like lightnin' 
 Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right 
 Cold deck ya, nah I could never respect a 
 Punk like you, you get dropped like one two 
 And you're out son, just like a one round bout son 
 The outcome, is that you'll get that ass hung 
 Easily, swiftly, you'ew stupid you can't get with me 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2) 
 I said fuck around, lay around, do or die 
 Fumin! Hey, I'm boomin' down on niggaz 
 I figure, how could they take out a big nigga 
 They don't know, so I don't never give 'em a clue 
 That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you 
 You can't get with this or take me down 
 I'm always laughin' haha 'cause you punks are clowns 
 Since I'm passin' emcees, with my skill 
 I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill 
 Rippin' up shit as I do, because I'm violent 
 That's why when I walk in the room, punks are silent 
 My name is Shug, as if you didn't know 
 I'm pimpin' hard, and punks are just a hoe 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2) 
 I said you fuck around, lay around, do or die 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die 
 I said you fuck around, lay around, do or die 
 Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2) 
 "You figgedy fuck around, you lay around" 
 Yeah yeah that's Shug for ninety-three 
 I want to say whattup to all my people, yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 We got the Guru in the house, and my man Lil' Dap 
 Showin' motherfuckers where we're truly at 
 I want to say whattup to my homegirl, my main girl and my kids 
 Whassup Kerry, Marie and Lisa how y'all chillin'? 
 I know y'all in the motherfuckin' house too, yeah! 
 I like to say whattup also, to all the peoples back home 
 That know what time it is, and the niggaz tryin' to get real 
 And on that note, right 
 I'ma get the fuck up out of here 
 "You figgedy fuck around, you lay around"
