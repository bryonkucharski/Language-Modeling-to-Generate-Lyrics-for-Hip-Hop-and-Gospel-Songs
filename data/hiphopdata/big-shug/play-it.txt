Yeah man, all I'm sayin' is 
 Just play the music, play all of the music man 
 We gotta keep some balance in the game 
 You know? Let it play man, for real 
 Uuhuuh, Big Shug, Primo 
 You know the deal 
 Just play these records man, all of em 
 DJs, all around the world 
 This year, I'm not fuckin' with coward cats 
 Who hide behind they raps and flashy Cadillacs 
 Scared of the battle raps and semiauto gats 
 But wanna push wack rhymes _ official cats 
 Who wanna feel the purple haze and sparks with cattle graze 
 Swimmin pool with dime chicks, spendin happy days 
 With all my niggas, blaze, honey dips gets glazed 
 And I'm paid a hundred grand when I hit the stage 
 This is not a phase, it's a real niggas wage 
 And I'ma make sure I get it before I'm back in the cage 
 I promise to shoot and blaze, till my dyin' days 
 Till DJ stan and my musics played 
 Any beef with me will end in castastrophe 
 I'm winnin' while you losin, that's how it just has to be 
 From the vinyl, to the CD j 
 Give the fans a chance to hear the fly shit I say 
 Play the record or get smacked clean 
 With anotha bangin' joint from Big Shug and DJ Prim 
 (Play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it 
 (Play it) play it (play it) play it 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (You know we get down) 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (On the microphone) 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (Rhymes flowin like water) 
 Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (You know we get down) 
 (...Record is massive evidence, of the flexibility and toughness of the 
 Principles you profess) 
 I do it all to show my skills, till pushin dafidills 
 I be on the roof tops, accurate for the kill 
 From old school to new school dudes, I set the tone 
 I'm a vocal, crush and do other things to your bones 
 When I face my enemies, I creep like a centipide 
 Smoke that angel _ while I'm spittin' that 16 
 The games been a hunch, referee true and lunch 
 I spit the hottest fire, and always pack a punch 
 Play the record or get your station smothered 
 Or get your head popped off like Sadaam Hussein brother 
 Play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play 
 It (play it, play it, play it) 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (You know we get down) 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (On the microphone) 
 Let the music play, hey 
 (Rhymes flowin like water) 
 Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday 
 Let the music play 
 All I'm sayin' DJs, around the world, let the music play man 
 All the music ain't got to sound the same 
 This is Big Shug, DJ Primo, what could be better? 
 Let that music play man, for real 
 Street champ, I'm gone
