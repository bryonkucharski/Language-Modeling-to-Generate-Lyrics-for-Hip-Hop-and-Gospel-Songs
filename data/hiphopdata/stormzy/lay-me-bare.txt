One more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare 
 Look, one more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare 
 Lord help me please I'm breaking down 
 Tryna' call my name and take my crown 
 Little bit of pain I'll paint the town 
 When they put me in my grave don't make a sound 
 'Cause there's still some days I find it hard 
 Smoke my spliff and write my bars 
 I know they see me climbing charts 
 But plaques won't help me find my heart 
 Yo God, what's good? I need you bad 
 Devil's in my ear I need you back 
 Got scars in my soul I've been attacked 
 Even when I'm low I seem relaxed 
 But then year's been mad I lost my way 
 They think I went ghost to drop my tape 
 Not knowing that I fell and lost my faith 
 Like Satan please no, not today 
 So fuck this shit this ain't a joke 
 Just to get away I take a toke 
 I took this pain and made a boat 
 Lord knows how the fuck it's staying afloat 
 Last year I cried too many times 
 Weren't for Flipz and weren't for rhymes 
 Weren't for Rachel, weren't for Kelly 
 Man them people saved my life 
 Like man'a get low sometimes, so low sometimes 
 Airplane mode on my phone sometimes 
 Sitting in my house with tears in my face 
 Can't answer the door to my bro sometimes 
 Roaming around all alone sometimes 
 Don't know sometimes 
 I was a young Ned Stark 
 But this shit's like Game of Thrones sometimes 
 One more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare 
 Look, one more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare 
 Like bro I can't believe I saw my dad 
 Still up in the ends, still driving cabs 
 He said "Yo son, I need a car" 
 I kissed my teeth and turned my back 
 Like "Nigga, you ain't seen my face for years 
 Nigga, you ain't seen my face for time 
 And the first thing you're asking me for, is that? 
 Fuck you! That's where I draw the line" 
 Should've dashed through a rack like "Keep the change" 
 And fuck letting go, I'll keep the pain 
 23 years I'm still the same 
 When you hear this I hope you feel ashamed 
 Cah' we were broke like what the fuck 
 Mum did well to hold us up 
 But yet she still forgave your arse 
 But mumsy's cool, I'm cold as fuck 
 Fuck that! I'm still not over this 
 Fuck that! No, I'm still not over this 
 Flipz told me someone died in Heath 
 Like "Please say I don't know the kid" 
 When I heard TS, I kissed my teeth 
 And then I broke down in disbelief 
 My bro TH and Yogi too 
 Man I'll be damned to miss the streets 
 But I still got old school friends that I shoulda' been cool with 
 Man that I ride for, man I went school with 
 Man that I love and man I kicked ball with 
 My phone's there, just call it 
 But I guess things just got strange for me 
 But you all grew fast and gracefully 
 Left my hood and grabbed the mic 
 And I got me a girl that prays for me 
 One more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare 
 Look, one more time I'll make it clear 
 This some shit I hate to share 
 Escape this life or pay the fare 
 Grab this gun and aim it there 
 Shoot my pain and slay my fear 
 Before I die, I say my prayer 
 Don't worry about the mess just lay me there 
 This is all I got so lay me bare
