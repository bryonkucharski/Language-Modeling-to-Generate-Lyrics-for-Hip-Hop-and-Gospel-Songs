I'm sorry that I'm late 
 And I missed your call 
 But you know night turn into day 
 I didn't stop to pause 
 I know I never see your face 
 And baby, that's my fault 
 But I'ma fix all my mistakes 
 So don't stress no more 
 You got those cigarettes and cush 
 You don't ever let me down 
 You got those cigarettes and cush

 All those other girls just look 
 They ain't never takin' your crown 
 And girl I know it gets on your nerves sometimes 
 When I don't answer my phone 
 And yeah I double back on my words at times 
 But please don't start with that tone, 'cause girl 
 I love you, you know, but I can't be there 
 But when I get home, just roll my weed, yeah 
 What's mine is yours, give you space to breathe here 
 Just weed and cush, that's a major key here 
 Yeah, then you play me a song 
 Smokin' smoke 'til we're wavy and gone 
 Come home from a long hard day with the dons 
 Like where's my baby? I'm sorry it's been long 
 I'm sorry that I'm late 
 And I missed your call 
 But you know night turn into day 
 I didn't stop to pause 
 I know I never see your face 
 And baby, that's my fault 
 But I'ma fix all my mistakes 
 So don't stress no more

 You don't ever let me down 
 As much as you feel you're a thorn 
 In the way that you feel, I come home 
 Every day when it rains 
 But it's real 
 Between us, ground so far beneath us 
 Sometimes I can't read ya 
 But it don't mean I won't treat ya 
 To a blunt full of that reefer 
 We may get in fights 
 But I could never see me leavin' 
 Somethin' 'bout our (?) the high can bring us 
 Sober just don't please us 
 If you're wondering, yeah I'm still here because I see us 
 But Mary makes it easy to talk to you 
 Aww, yeah 
 'Cause sometimes I just can't spill my thoughts to you 
 I took you in every day 
 At the end of every day I belong to you 
 Belong to you 
 I'll still pass the bong to you 
 I'll write a song to you 
 I'll do no wrong to you 
 I'm sorry that I'm late 
 And I missed your call 
 But you know night turn into day 
 I didn't stop to pause 
 I know I never see your face 
 And baby, that's my fault 
 But I'ma fix all my mistakes 
 So don't stress no more 
 You got those cigarettes and cush 
 You don't ever let me down

 You don't ever let me down 
 I won't ever let you down 
 'Cause you don't ever let me down 
 I won't ever let you down 
 'Cause you don't ever let me down 
 I can't ever let you down, down, down 
 Down, down, down, down 
 It's been like a month now 
 Since you left my side 
 Got me smokin' a blunt now 
 But there ain't no vibe 
 'Cause I fucked up badly 
 All I did was push 
 Now there's no more weed 
 No more cush 
 And I'm deep in the south side 
 And I can't find love 
 I was lookin' for my brown skin 
 Tryna find that buzz 
 Now what have you done, Stormz? 
 Now what have you caused? 
 And we weren't just bredrens 
 We were so much more 
 Girl you was my hero 
 The beat to my heart 
 And them tears on your face 
 Man they tear me apart 
 Man I just wanna fix you 
 Fix what I broke 
 No covers on the sofa 
 No more smoke 
 And I pray God saves you 
 Man I pray all night 
 I just wanna say thank you 
 'Cause you saved my life 
 But I cut you deep 
 And I know how it looks 
 Now there's no more weed 
 No more cush 
 No more cush 
 No more cush, yeah 
 Now there's no more cush 
 No more cush
