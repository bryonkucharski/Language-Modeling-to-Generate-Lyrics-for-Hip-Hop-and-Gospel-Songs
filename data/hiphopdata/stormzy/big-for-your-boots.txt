You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I've got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth, look 
 You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth 
 Wanna come round here like a badboy? Do it 
 Bun all the talking, go on then, do it 
 Running through the party, bottle of BACARDÍ 
 Bro's in my ear saying "Stormz, don't do it" 
 Devil on my shoulder, I don't lack 
 Hit 'em with a crowbar, I don't scrap 
 Even when I'm sober, I'm so gassed 
 Say you ride but there's no car and no mash (what you talking 'bout?) 
 Clown, stand down 
 Never had a MAC-10 or a trey pound 
 You were never bad then, you ain't bad now 
 Never had the MAC then, little nigga, back down 
 Wait, I saw bare kicks, saw bare clothes 
 Said fuck that, I can't wear those 
 I don't like them, they're not my ting 
 They went silent, they're all weirdos 
 Like yeah, Stormz gone clear 
 Never had a Tom Ford or a Moncler 
 Mandem are calm, but you see my don there? 
 Fuckries, tell 'em don't do it, don't dare 
 Don't care who you know from my block 
 You're not Al Capone, you'll get boxed 
 They can take my car and my creps 
 I'll still do the road in my socks 
 Like who's gonna stop me? You? Him? 
 Weed in a cigarette, blue slims 
 Don't be an idiot, move smart 
 I've been killing it, new king 
 Niggas ain't ready for my new stuff 
 You're a prick by yourself, go and group up 
 And when Krept went States for the BETs 
 I was covering Krept like a bootcut 
 Ith mad, that's a family ting, straight family ting 
 Dem man are broke, no salary ting 
 Had a peng ting called Amy 
 Telling me to come round hers on a Valerie ting 
 #Merky, academy ting 
 Coming like art in a gallery ting 
 Dem boy dere wanna chat about bars 
 Wanna chat about crud but, but, but 
 You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth, look 
 You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I've got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth 
 I'm too hot 
 Drug money in my shoebox 
 I'm the man of the house and my shows sold out 
 Like the brudda from the Boondocks 
 Beats 1 in my boombox 
 Still steal meat from the stew pot 
 Mandem go sick when my tune drops 
 Little man, that's a Hublot, not a Hublot 
 What? Pronounce it right, you prick 
 I go mad, yeah, I'm down to die for this 
 I don't care, bro, I'm down to pipe your chick 
 Mad stressed so I'm bound to light my spliffs 
 Wait, I'm bound to ride for Flipz 
 Real Gs gonna ride around to this 
 Man, I've got no time to write a diss 
 I never left my 9 to 5 for this 
 Wasteman ting 
 I don't care what rave man's in 
 I came here to relax but if it gets mad 
 Mek a young boy take man's tings 
 Try tell me I'm way too big to rebel? 
 Nah, man, you're never too big to rebel 
 I was in the O2 singing my lungs out 
 Rudeboy, you're never too big for Adele 
 Leave my yard, blow a kiss to my girl 
 Salute to my sister as well 
 Gotta keep trophies down at my mum's bit 
 Man, I'm getting way too big for my shelf 
 Man, I see bare MCs wanna sideline 
 But I still got a couple bangers in the pipeline 
 Man, I've got grown men @ing me shit 
 You're getting way too old for the timeline 
 You're getting way too old for a diss 
 Should've looked after your kids 
 Get out the booth, go home to your son 
 It's never too late to commit 
 It's like man love put my name in a bar 
 Random flight, get a plane to Qatar 
 This year, I learned how to take care of business 
 Next year, I'll learn how to play the guitar 
 You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth, look 
 You're getting way too big for your boots 
 You're never too big for the boot 
 I got the big size twelves on my feet 
 Your face ain't big for my boot 
 Kick up the youth 
 Man know that I kick up the youth 
 Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth 
 How dare you twist up the truth
