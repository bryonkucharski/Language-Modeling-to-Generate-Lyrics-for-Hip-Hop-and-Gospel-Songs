Yeah, all right, yeah 
 Yo, you just wanna know what it feels like 
 You don't know what you want but it feels right 
 And you ain't even my girl but we still tight 
 All your man took you 'dam, aw sick that's nang 
 Let me put you on a real flight 
 Yeah, welcome to the trill life 
 That views in the shard then I go and book a car 
 Then we go and get a meal life 
 You're tryna' look into my soul and see the real Mike 
 I got a long term plan, I'm a long term man 
 I'm just tryna' get the deal right 
 But my issue is pride 
 If I ever told you I missed you, I lied 
 Screaming at my phone like "I wish you would try" 
 Poison love, I kiss you I die 
 You get mad, get pissed and you cry 
 Then you making one wish and send a kiss to the sky 
 I can't lie man, I wish you were mine 
 But the truth is I ain't got the tissue or time 
 I can show you my dirty little secrets 
 Promise me you're always gonna keep it, girl 
 Tell me that you love me, you're the sweetest 
 I didn't want to love you but I beat it girl 
 I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder 
 I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 I wish I could help it 
 Into my window of calm 
 Want only to take the flame 
 To the bridge of dawn 
 It feels just like velvet 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 Ooh then it's gone 
 So how would you feel if a brother stayed around? 
 Taking care of you and not the other way around 
 Fell too deep, now we're both 6 feet 
 Baby I can barely breathe, could you suffocate me now? 
 I don't wanna sell a dream you can't afford 
 I can take you round the city when you're bored 
 Maybe when you finish your degree, we'll go abroad 
 Your ex man never gave you nothing, he's a fraud 
 Can you tell me what it feels like? 
 Tell me what it feels like 
 Welcome to the sweet life 
 Baby, welcome to the sweet life 
 Look, hanging up the phone on me, girl you're too bright 
 You got a hold on me, girl you're too tight 
 We can go from Paris to Rome in two nights 
 If I'm gonna do it then I gotta do it right, all right 
 I will never ever lead you astray (aye) 
 That's all I never needed to say (aye) 
 The boys wanna tease at my faith (aye) 
 That's just another reason to pray (aye) 
 And if you ever needed me to stay (aye) 
 I'll always be a phone call away (aye) 
 Breathtaking, I'll blow you away 
 Girl just face it, I know how you stay 
 If I tell you my every little interest 
 Thinking of you every time I rinse this, girl 
 But loving you is easier, the simplest 
 Running through the world you're my princess girl 
 I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder 
 I grow fonder, girl I grow fonder 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 I wish I could help it 
 Into my window of calm 
 Want only to take the flame 
 To the bridge of dawn 
 It feels just like velvet 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 Ooh then it's gone 
 Yeah, all right, all right, all right, all right 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay 
 Man thought that Stormzy couldn't sing, haha 
 Yo, it feels just like velvet 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 I wish I could help it 
 Into my window of calm 
 Want only to take the flame 
 To the bridge of dawn 
 It feels just like velvet 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 Ooh then it's gone, then it's gone 
 Then it's gone, ooh then it's gone 
 A touch of the wind and it's gone 
 Ooh then it's gone 
 Oh yeah, I definitely loved that one 
 That was Stormzy, with the smoochy "Velvet"
