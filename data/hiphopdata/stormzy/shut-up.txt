Man try say he's better than me 
 Tell my man shut up 
 Mention my name in your tweets 
 Oi rudeboy, shut up 
 How can you be better than me? 
 Shut up 
 Best in the scene? 
 Tell my man shut up 
 Couple man called me a backup dancer 
 Onstage at the BRITs, I'm a backup dancer 
 If that makes me a backup dancer 
 The man in your vids, backup dancer 
 The man in your pics, backup dancer 
 Man wanna chat about backup dancer 
 Big man like me with a beard 
 I'm a big man, how the fuck can I backup-? 
 Army comes everywhere I go 
 I can't run when my enemies show 
 Walk in the club with all of my tugs 
 Party's done, everybody go home 
 Apart from the girl dem, you lot stay 
 Walk in the club, all the girls say hey 
 Tell a man like I'm K to the A 
 There's no champagne, we don't rave 
 Yeah, I'm the best, I'm so cocky 
 I've got a mob like A$AP Rocky 
 I set trends, them man copy 
 They catch feelings, I catch bodies 
 They roll deep, I roll squaddy 
 Got about 25 goons in my posse 
 They drink Bailey's, I drink Vossy 
 I get merky, they get worried 
 If you got a G-A-T, bring it out 
 Most of the real badboys live in south 
 If you wanna do me something, I'm about 
 I'm not a gangster, I'm just about 
 But you see my man over there with the pouch? 
 Dare one of you man try get loud 
 All of my mandem move so foul 
 I might sing but I ain't sold out 
 Nowadays all of my shows sold out 
 Headline tour, yeah blud, sold out 
 When we roll in, they roll out 
 I'm so London, I'm so south 
 Food in the ends like there ain't no drought 
 Flipz don't talk like he's got no mouth 
 I wanna make my mum so proud 
 Like "yo Mum, book a flight, go now" 
 All of my ex girls stalking me hard 
 Talk to my face, don't talk to my palm 
 Had four bills and I bought a new car 
 Little red whip that I bought for my marge 
 I straight murk, it's a walk in the park 
 I take care when I water my plants 
 These MCs wanna talk about Lord of the Mics 
 You ain't even lord of your yard 
 Dead MCs, blud, leave me alone 
 Me and your girl, we speak on the phone 
 Kill a whole crew of MCs on my own 
 Kill a whole crew of MCs for the throne 
 Look, I was out hungry, so damn hungry 
 Man tried eat then leave me the bones 
 Now these niggas, they need me to grow 
 Hot chocolate and a panini to go 
 I'm a big man, fuck a postcode war 
 Man were upset about the MOBO Awards 
 Yeah, I was gassed at the MOBO Awards 
 Why? 'Cause I ain't won a MOBO before 
 Duh, all of you MCs sound so bitter 
 Shut down Wireless, shut down Twitter 
 Shoutout Deepee, shoutout Flipper 
 Best my age, yeah blud, look 
 If you don't rate me, shame on you 
 If you don't rate me, shame on you 
 Can I order a deathbed for an MC? 
 He wants beef with me? Make that two 
 Anyone else wanna make that move? 
 Anyone else wanna pay their dues? 
 Stiff Chocolate, yeah my face so smooth 
 Imposters wanna take my tunes, check it 
 Don't even talk too much, you're a talker 
 Dem man still go halves on a quarter 
 See me turn from a prince to a pauper 
 Two cigarettes and a bottle of water 
 Told the bouncers get the bottles in order 
 Man in the kitchen putting in orders 
 Stiff Chocolate, skin clear like water 
 Smooth on this ting, start locking up daughters 
 Brown skin girl in the club, I want that one 
 Who's got Rizla and chip? I wanna strap one
