See I love my hood, but the hood shit bugs me 
 Cuh' man ah put the chrome to my mum then they see me and spud me 
 And plus I got childhood friends that are schemin' to rush me 
 So if I just pack my bags and I leave this fuckery 
 Look, nobody judge me 
 Now I'm just picturing (?) all dressed in white 
 On the steps with Christ 
 Tryna tell my young Gs to relax and invest in life 
 They invest in knives 
 Man I was in my history class when my bredrin died 
 So vexed that I cried 
 But I come from a place where mandem can't let shit slide 
 So we rest in pride 
 And it kills us slow 
 But bro I don't need all that 
 'Cause the place where I live is the place I will die but I already preed all that 
 Can't chat about pain, just look at my veins 
 Look brudda, I bleed all that 
 Damn, I just want all my people back 
 Yo 
 In case you think I've changed and I'm different 
 I'm not keeping you at a distance 
 So have a thought for me, yeah 
 Hold down this thought for me 
 Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day 
 Everything can stay the same 
 Remember I came? Remember my name? 
 Remember my face? 
 I don't wanna fade away 
 Don't cry for me 
 Don't cry for me 
 Oh no 
 No, no 
 Don't cry for me 
 Don't cry for me 
 Don't cry for me 
 Yo 
 Heart on my sleeve, let me open up 
 (?) On the block all posted up 
 Me and them boy don't mix but I'll post it up 
 And it ain't no family pic but it's close enough 
 And look man, I still reminisce when I'm holdin' up 
 I think about the past sometimes and I sober up 
 'Cause if that boy looks back, it'll hold him up 
 Man are out here beefin' like we ain't broke enough 
 Swear these bruddas ain't woken up 
 Like what have I done to deserve this life? 
 I got brothers in the pen that will never see again 
 Got my brothers dem servin' life 
 And I know that you think that it serves 'em right 
 But I come from a place where you burn or die 
 Or (?) 
 So don't blame us when we turn to the dirt, we tried 
 I just pray we fly, yo 
 In case you think I've changed and I'm different 
 I'm not keeping you at a distance 
 So have a thought for me, yeah 
 Hold down thought for me 
 Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day 
 Everything can stay the same 
 Remember I came? Remember my name? 
 Remember my face? 
 I don't wanna fade away 
 Don't cry for me 
 Just take a shot for me 
 Don't cry for me, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Don't cry, oh no 
 Don't cry for me, no
