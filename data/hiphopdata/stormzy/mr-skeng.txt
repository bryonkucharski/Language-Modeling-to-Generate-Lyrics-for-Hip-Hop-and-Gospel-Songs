Yeah, yeah 
 Call me gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng 
 Check one-two, man skitzed again 
 Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew 
 Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends 
 It's like dem man woke up pissed again 
 If I buck these pricks again 
 I got goons and you got goons 
 But the difference is your shit pretends 
 My niggas don't talk or rap 
 No, my niggas don't talk or clash 
 No, my niggas don't talk they mash 
 Fuck boys, man are you talking smack? 
 They said Stormzy can't be the king of grime 
 Cuh he can't do radio sets 
 Let's be real, rudeboy 
 I would light up a radio set 
 Like, really, I can't stand these fucking pricks 
 I don't care about your fucking whip 
 Mum, if you're listening, close your ears 
 But tell them paigons suck my dick 
 I've had enough of them, they all piss me off 
 Had one chance they missed the shot

 Then we laugh about it and split the prof 
 Call me gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng

 Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew 
 Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends 
 I think I just got dissed again 
 Think I care who this offends 
 Run up on man like Bale with a- 
 Slap that through your shit defense 
 And I can still get a box imported 
 Said don't worry about the beef it's sorted 
 My man said he's a real gun shooter 
 Then my brother said rah, that's awkward 
 My man's never been bad that's bullshit 
 Two weeks in the top 10 who called it 
 Christmas, I went to war with the corporates 
 Like big ups the ones that caught it 
 I do rap, then I do grime 
 Then I do rap, then I sing and I roll right back 
 They said you ain't gonna blow like that 
 Who gives a fuck? You know like that 
 Ice in my cup come cold like that 
 Whoa, we ain't even close like that 
 You know my style, know my stats 
 Don't talk bad if you don't talk facts 
 If I sign now what's the buyout clause 
 One top 10, 5 sold out tours 
 Might fling a mixtape out when I'm bored 
 My life's okay, how about yours? 
 Brother, I'm good, I stay with the lord 
 Bible carrier, that's my sword 
 Matthew 12, so I don't talk 
 John 19's why I never got caught 
 Call me gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng 
 Check one-two, man skitzed again 
 Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew 
 Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends 
 Back now damn I've missed the pen 
 Had one shot you missed the pen 
 Bad man yutes, with their bad man ways 
 What they wish for me, I don't wish for them 
 I don't pay them fools, never been told 
 Robbing phones outside Elliott School 
 Let me get a little bit of Henny, I'm cool 
 Many have come but many did fall away 
 What? You thought I was the one? 
 I was fourteen trying to buy me a gun 
 Most niggas doing what I did back then 
 So, now I thank god for the guy I've become
