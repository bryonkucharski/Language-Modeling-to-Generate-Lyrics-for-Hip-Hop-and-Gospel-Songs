I don't wanna be on Lord of the Mics with shit MC's 
 Nah bro, I'm above that 
 Using my name for a dead bit of fame 
 Tryna get up in the game, yeah right nigga, fuck that 
 Stormz' ain't grime and Stormz' ain't clash 
 Look don't be fooled 'cause the war ting, I love that 
 Call this the return of the rucksack, 
 Oi Flipz get the four-door truck back 
 Come to your block in my PJ's 
 Big dot dot for the briefcase 
 Bro bought me a watch for my B-day 
 And my girlfriend's a boss like I'm Decay 
 Yeah, I lick shots for my DJ 
 And I'm still getting guap in my CK's 
 Big whip I'm underground parking (skrrt, skrrt) 
 That's word to the fob on my key-chain 
 Nigga can't flex on me, can't flex on me 
 Rude boy thing, all the cheques on me 
 See Big Mike on the IV site 
 Now the pengtings wanna do the sex on me 
 I've got scars for days, I'm so tribal 
 You're not Ghana made, you're not Michael 
 I can spar and spray with my idols 
 Look, if I slap your face, it'll go viral 
 I was on my saracen bike on my ridge back (Word) 
 Cold on the road buts I did that (Word) 
 IPhone 3 with the GiffGaff (Word) 
 Take a break little nigga, have a Kit Kat (Cool) 
 Came from the wall like a mix pack 
 I've got pengtings shaking their tic tacs 
 And I know that I shouldn't be sending but broke niggas shouldn't make diss tracks 
 You broke niggas should've been quiet 
 I'm cold little nigga, don't try it 
 Yeah I think I'm the best, I'm biased 
 And I shoot for your chest like Payet 
 But I roll deep on these

 Rude boy, we ain't forgotten your past 
 Laughing stock for the year, what a laugh 
 Sending for MC's can't be your path 
 Rude boy, come off my name, just graft 
 Man wanna know what they paid for the part 
 Know that I'm comfy, shout out Noel Clarke 
 Bro you're too thirsty, I don't blame you 
 I get merky, I get paid too 
 You're not certi', I can't hate you 
 Just a wasteman looking for a break-through 
 I know Kofi, I know Kweiku 
 You can't smoke me, I don't rate you 
 Man, I told these niggas that it's album time and it'll probably go gold on my debut 
 I was on a BMX bike with the trick nuts (Word) 
 Out here tryna get my chips up (Word) 
 Known for the park with my lightie (Mm?) 
 I was fifteen tryna get my dick sucked (Eurgh) 
 Young nigga tryna get my dick wet (Word) 
 Had a cold pink jacket like Dipset 
 Last night I just rung my accountant 
 Like talk to me brother, am I rich yet? 
 Like, talk to me brother, can I buy this? 
 Big yard for my nephew Alias 
 Can't get this style from a stylist 
 Then I blow on the riddim like ISIS
