Like, all right, first things first, I've been putting in the work 
 I'm a rebel with a cause (with a cause) 
 Had problems with the fam 
 I had problems with the gang 
 But I put that shit on pause (put that shit on pause) 
 I've been gone for a while but I saw you niggas smile 
 When I cancelled all my tours (little pussies) 
 Someone tell 'em that I'm back 
 I don't never ever slack, grab my gun and go to war (boy) 
 I got brothers up in jail, going mad up in their cells 
 When you hear me, bang your doors (bang your doors) 
 Niggas moving chatty, someone tell them that I'm scatty 
 Bro, I'll pull up uninsured like (skkkkkrrr) 
 Running through my strip, rappers jumping on my dick 
 Just to build up a rapport (it's embarrassing) 
 I can tell them man are bitter 
 But they're begging it on Twitter, man, I swear I'm so appalled 
 Before he takes a shot, I'll shoot him first (shoot him first) 
 And poor mum, we was going through her purse (through her purse) 
 We were doing road and doing church 
 Looked the devil in his face like motherfucker, do your worst 
 Still here tryna' find another blessing 
 I'm over-loyal man I'll ride for what I'm repping 
 Dark times niggas dying in recession 
 You was fighting with your girl when I was fighting my depression, wait 
 Okay 
 All right, first things first, coulda put you in a hearse 
 Man, I gave you boys a lifeline (lifeline) 
 I was scrolling through my tweets, had Adele up on repeat 
 And saw a madness on my timeline (on my timeline) 
 LBC's tryna' black ball me 
 And tryna' blame your boy for knife crime (like what?) 
 I don't use a shank, I got money in the bank 
 Man, I'd rather do a drive by (dickheads) 
 Mad, mad demons in my thoughts 
 Young Stormz wasn't ready for the limelight (he wasn't ready) 
 Took a little break from the game, started praying 
 Man, I had to get my mind right (started praying) 
 All black clothes till I shine bright 
 Full beams fucking up my eyesight 
 They hate me on the sly 
 But I bet you if I died, you would see 'em at my night night (fake youts) 
 They're asking if I'm real, I'm real enough ('nough) 
 Still got a couple killers in the cut (cut) 
 If he's coming nice 
 I big him up, drugs kill 
 But my niggas make a killing off a drug (aye) 
 Rapping like I'm Jigga but I'm Puff (puff) 
 Westend wanna show a nigga love (love) 
 But if it weren't me you would never let my niggas in the club 
 Fuck DSTRKT and fuck all these nightclubs 
 And fuck giving money to people that don't like us 
 There's riots in the city just tell me where I sign up 
 The rave goes silly every time I pick the mic up (whoa) 
 I got smoke, you can hold a bit 
 A coloured brother with a bone to pick 
 But I still get to gunning, don't be running when I bang mine 
 Before we said our prayers, there was gang signs (gang signs)
