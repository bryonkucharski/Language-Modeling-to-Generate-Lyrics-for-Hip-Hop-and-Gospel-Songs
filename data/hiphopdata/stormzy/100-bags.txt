Hello, hello my son, good morning 
 I bet you are still sleeping 
 I just want to bless you this morning 
 May the God of Jehovah bless you 
 Guide you but teach you everything you are doing 
 May the God lead you, as he lead the israelite to their promise land 
 God will lead you far 
 My son, I'm blessing you this morning 
 God will lead you far, okay? 
 Just put your trust and hope and everything in him 
 And he will take care of everything, okay? 
 God will bless you, in Jesus name 
 Have a pleasant day my lovely son 
 God bless you, bye 
 Your son did good mum 
 Swear down man, your son did good mum 
 Know I used to run around with a budge mum 
 But I promise I was doing what I could mum 
 Now I made a little change, now we're good mum 
 I was saying I was gonna get you out the hood mum 
 Take a selfie, show 'em how you look mum 
 Flex on 'em, let 'em know that we're good mum 
 See, back then I was bumping cabs 
 South of the Thames, where I come from's mad 
 Done some dirt and I ain't too proud that you're living on the road that your son got stabbed 
 I had you on the station, your son got nabbed 
 Tough luck, just mums no dads 
 And we all know growing up in London's mad 
 Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags 
 So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad 
 Yeah, I bought mumzy a pad 
 Yeah, like mumzy you're bad 
 Ghanaian queen, let 'em know that you're back 
 'Cause mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags 
 Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags' 
 Be right here whenever you need me, I need you to know that your son's got your back 
 Like, mum I owe you everything, can you believe that? 
 Everything, I'ma repeat that 
 And when I make a song, you give me feedback 
 I watched you plant the seed and then you reap that 
 Made a little money from cheese, I let you keep that 
 Hid drugs but you probably couldn't see that 
 Young thug, missing colly like an eediot 
 Fucked up saying sorry like I'm three stacks 
 Man I just hope you can play this 
 All them times that you worked on a late shift 
 Just to see you come short on your payslip 
 Always in and out of beef with the bailiffs 
 Now I'm on the playlist 
 Yeah, where I come from's bad 
 Same old shit, just mums, no dads 
 And we all know growing up in London's mad 
 Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags 
 So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad 
 Yeah, I bought mumzy a pad 
 Yeah, like mumzy you're bad 
 Ghanaian queen, let 'em know that you're back 
 'Cause mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags 
 Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags' 
 Be right here whenever you need me, I need you to know that your son's got your back, look 
 Mum, I save it all for you 
 Listen to the words I say 
 No more broken promises 
 I promise this 
 So I save it all for you 
 Mum I save it all for you 
 Listen to the words I say 
 No more broken promises 
 No more broken promises, I swear 
 No more broken promises, I swear 
 No more broken promises, I swear 
 No more broken promises, I swear 
 No more broken promises 
 Never seen a hundred bags 
 Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags' 
 Never seen a hundred bags 
 Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags' 
 Never seen a hundred bags 
 Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags' 
 And I'll be right here whenever you need me, I need you to know that your son's got your back 
 Like, I swear
