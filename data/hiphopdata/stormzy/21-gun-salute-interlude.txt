Woke up on my crucifix again 
 Was up all night praying for revenge 
 I don't need more enemies for friends 
 Tell me how much times can I kill this game for them 
 But I still love these yout's 
 21 Gun Salute 
 Fuck wi' you 
 21 Gun Salute 
 I put my trust in you 
 21 Gun Salute 
 Would you share your last bullet with me if there weren't any more gun salutes? 
 Yeah, okay, our father who are in Heaven 
 Know that I pray that I still stay repping 
 Pray for my bros and the pagans souls who turn their nose every time I step in 
 Know that I pray that my bro stops betting 
 Man that roulette machine won't let him 
 And I can't wait 'til I say 'I do' and the bros say 'Brap', gun shots at my wedding 
 You know how we do, flex on occasions, no more food 
 Left it with Satan, Lord you know I'm a different person but Lord why do they test my patience? 
 Please can I bun my zoot in peace? 
 21 Gun Salute for these neeks 
 I don't ever wanna be like them so I say this prayer every time I go sleep 
 And it goes like this 
 Woke up on my crucifix again 
 Was up all night praying for revenge 
 I don't need more enemies for friends 
 Tell me how much times can I kill this game for them 
 But I still love these yout's 
 21 Gun Salute 
 Fuck wi' you 
 21 Gun Salute 
 I put my trust in you 
 21 Gun Salute 
 Would you share your last bullet with me if there weren't any more gun salutes?
