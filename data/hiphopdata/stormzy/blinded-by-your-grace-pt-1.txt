Hmm 
 I'm blinded by your grace 
 Every night, every day 
 And I was lost, yeah 
 But ever since you found me 
 I'm blinded by your grace 
 Through the darkness you came 
 And I'll be alright 
 With you by my side 
 The way that I see you 
 You're all that I'm needing 
 Your love never lets me down 
 Your love never leaves me, how? 
 And when I'm losing faith and there is nowhere left to turn 
 I pray you won't let me down 
 I pray you won't let me down 
 I'm blinded by your grace 
 Every night, every day 
 And I was lost, yeah 
 But ever since you found me 
 I'm blinded by your grace 
 Through the darkness you came 
 And I'll be alright 
 With you by my side 
 I can't escape you 
 I can't replace you 
 So don't walk away from me now 
 Oi, hahaha, that was it? 
 Yeah, yeah?
