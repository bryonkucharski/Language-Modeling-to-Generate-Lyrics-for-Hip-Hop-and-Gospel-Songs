 This loving so good I should never be single 
 He love the way I throw it like a pitcher on the mound 
 Put it on him make him wanna wipe a bitch down 
 I can ride it like a cowgirl 
 Up down up down such a bad girl 
 I handle biz in and out the bedroom 
 It ain't a position that I can't assume 
 She can't do it like me

 I stay up on my fitness 
 Put on my genie costume and grant your wishes 
 When I leave it 'cause love sickness 
 So he tie me down and eat it up like brisket 
 He knock this thang out the park like Arod 
 Slide into home plate then I applaud 
 I must say the loving so good 
 He do all that freaky shit call him lil' Tiger Woods

 My bunny hop got him giving up carats 
 Taking days off like Ferris 
 Ain't no other chick comparing 
 He want me to his self & he can't imagine sharing 
 Pull my hair slap my ass let's play ruff 
 Fun sex got the whip and the handcuffs 
 Imma' throw it at him like a fast ball 
 He got his glove on tight hitting every wall
