C'mon 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake 
 (Verse 1: Petey) 
 I want them 3, to come up here wit me 
 So I can put 'em where they 'pose to be 
 One at the head, one in the middle 
 And one down by my feet, she keep ticklin me 
 Neighbors bangin' on the wall 'cause we over here 
 Disturbin the peace, baby be easy 
 Rockin' the bed so hard we done kicked off 
 All tha sheets, don't worry we don't need em 
 A couple hours in the session we done been 
 Through bout four CDs (about four CDs) 
 Keith Sweat, Mary J, Brian McKnight, and Jodeci 
 (They love Jodeci) 
 By the way look think I need a couple can of energy drinks 
 (Yeah I'm gone need em) 
 'Cause these hoes go vibratin in they coochie 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake 
 (Verse 2: Rasheeda) 
 Bend over and touch ya toes, blow smoke got ya hoes like you blowin' dro 
 Slide down the pole, upside down do it fast or slow 
 Round here we professionals, get flexible, real sexual 
 Make a nigga wanna eat it like a vegetable 
 When he see that ass rise like a buttered roll 
 Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar 
 We let it all hang out 
 Break bread till the song played out, show that nigga what a real bitch bout 
 These cats thank they pimpin' like Don Juon 
 But they all played out like the thong song 
 Get ya money gul, show 'em what you really bout 
 Rasheeda reppin fo the ladies in the south 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake 
 (Verse 3: Petey) 
 I can fuck, any bitch in here, lay her on the pillow 
 Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her 
 Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there 
 When I move you move, just like that 
 Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac 
 Like spinners, sittin' on a sixty-seven 
 At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex 
 I ain't met a bitch yet (and yeah) that I couldn't have 
 All I gotta do is tell a hoe who I am 
 Pull up to the side and get away from them 
 Doom, Doom, Doom 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 I like the way yo ass be vibratin... 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake 
 Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate 
 Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you 
 Start an earthquake
