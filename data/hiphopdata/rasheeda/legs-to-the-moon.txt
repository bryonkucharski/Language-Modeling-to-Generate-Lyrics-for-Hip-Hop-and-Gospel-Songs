Hey, that's my baby 
 You know that's my baby, right? 
 Hey, that's my baby 
 You know that's my baby, right? 
 I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon! 
 And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put yo legs to the moon, shawty legs to the moon!) 
 And we gonna do it all night, till the sun light, it feel so right 
 When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 He never gone long, 
 And when he leaves he calls can't wait to get home! 
 You know that I'm ready, ready 
 And on that Patron, ain't got nothing on (ain't got, ain't got nothing on on!) 
 It's going down, I can't wait, 
 I send him pics to his phone, so he fixate 
 He call to conversate, now it's getting dirty. 
 How long before you get here 
 He said be there in a hurry 
 That swag off the chain, I talk myself, he can get this damn thing 
 The first time we did, uh, insane 
 But we got it popping, I ain't talking champagne 
 No other can replace 
 The way he do that thing when I put it in his face 
 He says I'm singing to his tune 
 When he spread my legs and put 'em up to the moon! 
 I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon! 
 And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 And we gonna do it all night, till the sun light, it feel so right 
 When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 I'm on a drug addicted to love 
 Addicted to the way he put my legs up above 
 Now I'm seeing stars, 
 On another planet his love taking me to Mars, Mars! 
 Work the middle, switch positions 
 I'm such a boss, but his love makes me so submissive, 
 He takes his time so attentive 
 I do a new trick just a lil incentive 
 To keep him on my team, gotta him on some big shit 
 Holler, it was all a dream! 
 He know I'm down, I'm down like no other 
 The classy sexy freaky chick who always keep it gutta 
 You know, I'm motivated, his my my motivator 
 And his tongue's amazing, such a stimulator. 
 I'm wetter than a lagoon, and ready, 
 Baby come and put these legs to the moon! 
 I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon! 
 And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 And we gonna do it all night, till the sun light, it feel so right 
 When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put to legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 I'm so flexible and he likes to see it 
 He likes to put my ankles around my neck 
 Every time he beats it! Bang, bang, bang 
 And he really turns me on 
 He drives me crazy 
 But he goes way too deep, so hard and I can't take it! 
 Bang, bang, bang 
 I love it, I love it, I love it I love it I love 
 How he takes control! 
 I love it, I love it, I love 
 Even when it's uncomfortable 
 So hold my legs up to the sky 
 Baby, take me for a ride to the moon! 
 I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon! 
 And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put to Legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!) 
 And we gonna do it all night, till the sun light, it feel so right 
 When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon 
 (Put to Legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)
