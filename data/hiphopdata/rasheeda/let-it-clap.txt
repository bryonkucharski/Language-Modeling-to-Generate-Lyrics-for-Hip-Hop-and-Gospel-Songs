(Feat. Akon) 
 Akon: 
 Konvict 
 Akon and Rasheeda 
 Rasheeda: 
 'Cause I got this hump (yeah) 
 In my back (yeah) 
 And every time he hears the bass 
 He just wants to clap (yeah) 
 Akon: 
 Let it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2] 
 Come on and let it 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2] 
 Rasheeda: 
 Come on and let it clap 
 Picture perfect 
 Paint a perfect picture 
 What's the dime pieces in it in the club get quicker (Whoa) 
 Now let's make this clear 
 Got a lil' tips and now we bound it over here 
 Rasheeda got them fiddling 
 Sit inside daze boy I see you later 
 Tell me what you thinking 
 Is that really you talking or what you drinking 
 You better put a tag on it 
 See this hump in my back 
 Now you wanna grab on it 
 I can make it pop like it's got a tag on it 
 If I let you beat it up you gotta put a man on it 
 (Bridge: Akon) 
 Now the way you open up like a folder 
 Wanna see it clap when you bend it over (eeh) 
 Watch how you grind on me 
 Drop down likes down on me 
 Rasheeda: 
 'Cause I got this hump (yeah) 
 In my back (yeah) 
 And every time he hears the bass 
 He just wants to clap (yeah) 
 (Akon) 
 Let it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2] 
 Come on and let it 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2]
