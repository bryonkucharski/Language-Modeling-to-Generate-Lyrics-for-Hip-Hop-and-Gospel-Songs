(Feat. Kalenna) 
 He better answer this phone 
 What lie he gon come up with this time 
 Pff yeah it figures 
 Whatever I'm throught 
 Kalenna: 
 Boy, pack ya bags 
 See you ain't gotta sneak and creep 
 Ima let you keep runnin' these streets 
 I ain't bout to have you stressing me 
 No 
 See how good she gon love you 
 When you let this tricks get the best of you 
 I'm good and I'm gon get over you 
 (She can deal with the drama I'm through with you) 
 Boy, pack ya bags

 Rasheeda: 
 Sometime love feels so good 
 Sometime love feels so great 
 Sometime love turns to hate 
 That's when it's all gone and it's just too late 
 I thought you was different from them other dudes 
 I've tried so hard to hold on with you 
 Yep by a minute I played a fool 
 I even let you sleep by with a lie or two 
 See I was your chic I ride for you 
 If I can't get down to it I ride for you 
 It took a little time for me to shake you off 
 Cause night and days I should break you off 
 Boy pack yo bags, take your game 
 Go with them lies you ain't gon change 
 I thought what we had together was so strong 
 But there are pictures on my phone that prove me so wrong 
 Kalenna: 
 Boy pack ya bags 
 See you ain't gotta sneak and creep

 Rasheeda: 
 Let a slide with the business trips 
 Got a name of a credit card slip 
 Man, why you're going out like this 
 I've never thought I'd have to deal with this 
 I look back and it all makes sense 
 Late night hanging out with ya boys 
 So now you're too drunk to drive home from the club 
 Why you didn't call me I would scooped you up 
 But you're sendin out all my calls and voice mails 
 Where your blackberry at - you get my e-mails 
 Now you're gonna sit here lie in my face 
 Shoulda cheated on you and gave you a daze 
 But I didn't do that I thought real love was better than all that 
 You the reason women think me ain't shit 
 You'll never find another real chic like this 
 Kalenna:
