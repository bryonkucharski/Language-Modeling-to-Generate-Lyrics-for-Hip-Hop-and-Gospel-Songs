He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over 
 And touch my toes 
 Them boys in the club always looking for a blockhead 
 Y'all the same ones givin' up non-stop 
 So get it right before you step to me rugged 
 I like them brands, betta rip on them cookies 
 I gotta have that dough 
 I like the hit (???) 'cause I'm a jazzy...(girl) 
 This fit that I'm fittin' cost more than them 24s 
 If you gotta ask, you can't afford what it's hittin' for 
 I change rides more than some of y'all change clothes 
 It's so hot, but yet the wrists is so cold. 
 One to the head, two more to get me loose 
 Once I hit the floor you can blame it on the Grey Goose 
 He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over 
 And touch my toes (x4) 
 Antique jeans with the stones on the booty 
 Ghetto fabulous in the club, give it to me 
 I like to lean and pop, I like to jig and stop 
 It take a lot to get this bunny to hop 
 Got 'em lined up like (???) 
 My bank account on the rise, like Wal-Mart stock 
 Boys get it straight, I know you wanna see me touch my toes 
 With this mini skirt on, I can strike a fine pose 
 He droolin' at the mouth like he 4 months old 
 Here's a teethin' ring to bite, just to keep your grill closed 
 One thing for certain, two things for sho 
 I know you wanna see me do my thing on the floor 
 He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over 
 And touch my toes (x4) 
 He all in my ear sayin' I look like a model 
 Steady poppin' game when he should be buyin' bottles 
 I ain't a golddigger boy, but I got needs 
 I'm on some presidential shit and I ain't talkin' bout trees 
 Girls in my hood like boys with fat pockets 
 Straight drop game, and he know how to lock it 
 The new R-class benz, he already knew it 
 I ain't gotta ask for it, he just do it do it do it 
 I know what real money look like, and you ain't 
 Girl, don't never touch them toes till you verify the bank 
 Bottom line, if you wanna play with these toys 
 Do away with the games and bring the damn noise 
 He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over 
 And touch my toes (x4)
