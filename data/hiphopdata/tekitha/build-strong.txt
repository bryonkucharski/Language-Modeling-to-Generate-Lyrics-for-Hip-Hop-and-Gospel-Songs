Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me 
 A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of my self physical... listen, let me tell you about... 
 Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me 
 A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of self physically enslaved 
 By the luxuries of this world so I behave 
 Like a man inside the grave 
 Who's life is lost 
 I want the promised gold but can't afford the cost 
 Or could I, I know the prescribed laws 
 Any effect is a result of the cause 
 Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied 
 Burning inside wanting to open wide 
 And scream 
 The name of the supreme 
 But I'm trapped in this world 
 Lusting for girls 
 Therefore I imagine a genie and a wish 
 And searching for things that just does not exist 
 But in the midst there's the answer for which I have searched 
 Cause from me springs divine prince rakeem 
 And that is me the master of equality 
 With the ability 
 To set myself free 
 But b.o.b.b.y 
 He don't want to die, 
 He don't want to die he don't want to try 
 So I'm forced to cry 
 And get trapped up for living my life inside a lie 
 These problems surround me 
 A lot of things upset me 
 As my soul rejects me 
 Enemy of my self physically enslaved 
 By the luxuries of this world so I behave 
 Like a man inside the grave 
 Who's life is lost 
 I want the promised gold but I can't afford the cost 
 Or could I, I heard of the prescribed laws 
 Any effect is a result of the cause 
 Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied 
 Burning inside and wanting to open wide 
 And scream 
 The name of the supreme 
 But I'm trapped in this world 
 I'm lusting for girls 
 Before I imagined a genie and a wish 
 And I'm searching for things that does not exist 
 But in my midst there's the answer 
 For which I have searched 
 Cause from me springs the divine prince rakheem 
 And that is me the master of equality 
 Give myself the opportunity 
 And set free and be all I can be 
 Be all I can be 
 And not a nigga just trapped up in luxury 
 Yo bobby digitial got to get knowledge of his self right now, 
 As we go through the struggle of life we got to go from boy to man 
 We start off as sperm to baby baby to man from man to dead man 
 And from dead man back to sand 
 All praises due to allah the most high word up 
 I got to be free I got to be free I got to break free 
 I got to break free I got to break free I got to break...
