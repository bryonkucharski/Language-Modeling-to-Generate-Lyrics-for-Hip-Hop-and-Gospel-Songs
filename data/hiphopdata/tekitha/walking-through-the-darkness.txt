It's been so long 
 Since he had a true friend 
 True friends are sure hard to come by 
 But then again 
 His loyalties lie within 
 Always kept his head to the sky 
 And they can't see, no, no, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness, no, no, no, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 No, no 
 They can't see him walking through, walking through 
 Day after day 
 And night after night 
 He's hustling just to get it right 
 There's no honor from thieves 
 No war without peace 
 The noose is tight, he'll still survive 
 Because they can't see, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 No, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 No, no 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 They can't see him walking through, walking through 
 No, in the end 
 Fate had it's place 
 On his road to become, becoming 
 They chased and gave haste 
 With zeal to a lemonade 
 Challenge instead of grace 
 And sealed his fate 
 They can't see him walking through the darkness 
 No, no 
 They can't see him walking through, walking through 
 No 
 They can't see him walking through, walking through 
 Walking through 
 Walking through the darkness 
 Walking through the darkness 
 Walking through the darkness
