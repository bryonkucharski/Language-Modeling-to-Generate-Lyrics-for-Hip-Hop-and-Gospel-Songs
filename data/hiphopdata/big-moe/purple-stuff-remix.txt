(Big Moe) 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 That purple stuff, purple stuff 
 Purple stuff, that purple stuff 
 (Project Pat) 
 Drinkin' on some purple got me feelin' mello 
 Some like promethazine some like that yellow 
 Project Pat that fellow 
 Hit that from the tailow pur-pur-purple stuff 
 Pockets sittin' swellow 
 Dollars I be stackin make that... clap in 
 When I'm in the bedroom I'm hittin it from the backend 
 Freakin that thing on them things kinda swervy 
 Cruise on them 22's keep 'em sittin' jervy 
 Chickens actin' birdy, ridin' kinda dirty 
 Eyes like a china mayn high as a birdy' 
 Ridin' kind of early me and Big Mizzel 
 Home of that sizzurp holla at a nizzel 
 Hit it in the cizzil gone off that drank-drank 
 Go let go my eggo and find you a drug mayn 
 Bigger then a dollar 'cause I'm a keep my cheese up 
 Picture me swallow the south off the heezy 
 (Big Moe) 
 The south is off the heezy, the south is off the heezy 
 Ain't no girl talkin' down on Meezy 
 Really doesn't matter if you follow ya click 
 It's that Big Moe and the Screwed Up Click 
 And my kin folk Po-yo always on that purple 
 We stay sippin on some drr-aank and the Project Pat 
 You know hes got my back 
 I'm all about my fetti, my cream, and my stack 
 I'm a put it down I got the rocks on my wrist 
 Drinkin' throwed and you know its sun kist 
 I'm a G chop, chop, chop on my block 
 On that purple stuff it got me feelin' so high 
 When I'm drinkin' its in my tummy 
 It got me leanin standin like a mummy 
 I'm a G and you know I'm throwed in the game 
 I'm a sip, sip, sip, sip until the day that I'm gone 
 (I'm on that purple) 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 (Purple stuff) 
 Purple stuff, that purple stuff 
 (Big Pokey) 
 Dro's in the air, I'm sippin on this liquor 
 Not sprite minds, or city of syrup, mines the big dipper 
 Boys movin quicker then me I'm on lean 
 That and a sack of hydro light green 
 I'm lookin' for somethin' 19 in tight jeans 
 My eyes blood shot pass the visine 
 On the bendin knees it's that throwed menage 
 I'm on the petty wit a pocket fulla trojan R's 
 Its some throwed lil broads in the place tonight 
 Gotta pint po'ed up so I'm tastin right 
 We on the case tonight me and da barre baby 
 Noke D, D-Gotti, see we barre crazy 
 (D-Gotti) 
 Muddy cups, muddy drunk 
 Leanin in it slow its some knockin' trunk 
 Purple this, purple that 
 Even slide in the purple candy Caddillac 
 I gotta Kool-Aid smile off some purple Kool-Aid 
 A pump froze, milly, milly a blue ice Gatorade 
 Its some playa drank I was raised on the stuff 
 Naw uh keep that Cris' pass me a muddy cup 
 So I can lean on you like the Monte'De Elrado 
 Here we go again my lil mama hollerin wake up Gotto 
 2 swallows to the dome I'm like (ah!) 
 Been tendin to the Barre Yard since Junior High 
 [Chorus] - repeat until fade
