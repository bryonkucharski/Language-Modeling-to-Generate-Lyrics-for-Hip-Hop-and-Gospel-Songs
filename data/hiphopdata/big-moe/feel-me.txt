 Uh its Noke D baby 
 In here with Twin and Gwin 
 K-Luv nah I'm talkin' bout 
 Its 2002 what y'all gon do? 
 (Keep It Real Gangsta!) 
 Man it's been along time comin' 
 Wave Ya Hands If Ya Feel Me 
 Drop ya top and keep it real yeah 
 Wave Ya Hands If Ya Feel Me 
 Drop ya top and keep it real yeah 
 (Big Moe) 
 Now if you keep it real lil ma go on, put ya hands up 
 I jus need some scrilla ma go on pull ya pants up 
 Now you can stand up or you can drop down 
 Open up wide lil mama say "EEEYYY" 
 Now I know you throwed dime piece fa sho 
 When we talkin' now I see ya tongue ring glow 
 And you not like them other lil boppaz 
 You kinda throwed you can break us off proper 
 Ain't no trippin' wit you 'cause I like what we do 
 It's always somethin' new that is why you gotta... 
 (Big Moe) 
 If you keepin' it real go on raise ya hands up 
 South seia felias go on raise ya dress up 
 Let ya candle dance in one stance 
 Turn up yo sound let your system enhance 
 Now ya know we throwed playas don't save hoes 
 Candy on chrome pop trunk on glow 
 Crawlin like a gator on the dark now 
 Ya know I gotta pint po'ed in a Sprite 
 Ain't no talking to the laws 
 The laws can kiss my balls 
 Don't do the speed limit when I crawl 
 If ya know what I'm talkin' about y'all 
 (K-Luv) 
 Lemme tell ya how it feel when ya droppin' ya top 
 Pullin up at Exxon and ya watchin 'em bop 
 Makin' it hop bringin' it not 
 Pullin through the Cario with a bad hoe drippin ya knot 
 Grabbin the glock cause sometimes boys be hatin' 
 Mad when they see young K-Luv skatin 
 Down to get my cake baby with the top reclined 
 Casey in the 4-door with the dot to yo spine 
 (Toon) 
 Toon expedition we ain't playin' no games 
 We gon park the 6 so we can floss the range 
 40 inch chain so my piece can hang 
 Ball kappa tennis shoes is a everyday thing 
 Purple stuff up in our cup we drank 
 While sippin on a gallon heres the tap we crank 
 Bodies feelin' good from the X we take 
 And pockets filled up from the mission we bring 
 (Noke D) 
 Chunk that duece in the air 
 Body rock with the H-town mayor 
 If you beatin' ya block and got hops on ya drop 
 Put ya middle fingers up in the air 
 I just want you to raise ya hands up high 
 Let me see em' player wave em' left to right 
 I just want you to drop ya top on yo ride 
 Man its sparklin inside its goin' down tonight
