Dime piece, that's what she is 
 Sexy sexy, sexy sexy 
 (Big Moe) 
 Fell up in the club nigga see this cutie pie 
 See what's going down on a Friday night 
 I was on a drink so a nigga feeling fine 
 She was over there giving up the freaky eye 
 Stepped to her, with the drink in my hand 
 Do you have a man, or do you have a girlfriend 
 You never know, you might be creeping 
 So what you think little mama you and I 
 I know you heard this once too many times 
 So what you sipping on, little Chardiney 
 Can I but you another drink if it's okay 
 (Every little city I go) everybody know my name Big Moe 
 (You looking good head to toe) 
 You a dime piece baby fa sho 
 (Big Moe) 
 Fell up in the club once again the next night 
 (What you was blowing Moe-Yo man) 
 Tripping on the X or jar so tight 
 I wish that I would of hit the light 
 (Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling) 
 She was the finest broad in the club that night 
 (She was like music) 
 (Tyte Eyez) 
 Baby you must be from Tennessee 
 Cause you the only ten, that I see 
 A straight up, dime piece from your head to your feet 
 A nigga can't help or put you in the diamonds on me 
 We at the bar buying drinks I'm really digging your style 
 Small waist, bow legged straight white pearly smile 
 It'll only be a while 'fore I'm getting your digits 
 Best believe every time you see me, a dime with me c'mon 
 (Isis Re) 
 Even though you checking me 
 I've been checking you too 
 So don't cross the law, you a dime fa sho 
 Baby, you so fine, so fine, so fine 
 (Big Moe) 
 Baby you a dime, a dime, a dime 
 (Sexy, sexy) 
 Dime piece, that's what she is 
 (Isis Re) 
 Don't cross the law, you a dime fa sho 
 Dime piece, that's what she is 
 (Isis Re) 
 Even though you checking me 
 I've been checking you too 
 So don't cross the law 
 You a dime fa sho, Big Moe
