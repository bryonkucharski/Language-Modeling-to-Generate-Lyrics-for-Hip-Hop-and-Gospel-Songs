Bitch don't play 
 For real

 Back up off me 
 I'm so serious bout this, 
 I'm So serious bout this 
 Move around bitch if you ain't dyin' move around bitch, 
 Church on the move 
 Say bitch you fuckin' with a boss, 
 Trill O.G. that didn't come to take a loss, 
 I paid the cost to be who I are, 
 And they know it when they see me ridin' my car, 
 Candy, with the dro inside a big jar, 
 I'm bout to roll that mother fucka in a cigar, 
 And when the swisha sweet is hit Id be careful 
 That smoke will have you coughin all your shit up, 
 I'm in my everyday get up 
 Black tee, levis, jordans, and them diamonds that stay lit up, 
 You wanna be like Bun Beeta step yo shit up, 
 Nigga this is playa school pay attention sit up, 
 Cause big daddys on the block, 
 Smokin' private stock and his bitch is sellin cock, 
 Hit the block grab the cash, get the g's and get the doe 
 And if you never did this shit befo, you can hit the door, 
 2x chorus: 
 I need a real live hoe, (live hoe) 
 That'll pick it up and drop it to the floor, (to the floor) 
 Fo sho, now bust it open let me see it, 
 If you're lookin' for a man hoe you know I can't be it, (can't be it) 
 I needa real live bitch, 
 To get out on that block until her daddy get rich 
 Now come and let a nigga put you on my gift list, 
 This rep a lot bitch, grab a shovel dig this, 
 Broke bitch get a hustla flip this, 
 If you don't like it you can raise like a lift kit, 
 Lil bitty boy I was lifted, 
 Off of kush smoke 7 grain I must of missed it, 
 I started blowin' up like some bisquick, 
 Fish stick ass nigga plex it was dismissed, 
 My name be on top of nigga's hit list, 
 Betta yet my name be on top of a nigga's wish list, 
 Canary diamonds lookin' like a piss test, 
 Shawtty wanna be with me she betta be a rich bitch, 
 Or she betta be a dime done diva when I'm down in H Town fuckin' around with Bun Beeta now 
 2x chorus 
 Everywhere I go hold up pimpin' is respected, 
 Hoes keep a playa chose, honor and except it, 
 Astonishin collective, my ism is effected, 
 Wake up to some pressed clothes, pussy, and some breakfast, 
 Pimpin' is a threshold, physically neglected, 
 Women call my phone and plee for GLC to smash this 
 Tryin' to check on me and see what they can come and help with, 
 Beezies is some L.I.G.'s they wasn't on the shelf bitch, 
 Just because your man be there wearin that wear that's got some velvet, 
 He is least intreguin so I call him Robert Redford, 
 Get an A for effort, 
 That when situations lead to somethin' desperate, 
 I'm at another airport, 
 Church is on the move, ew, 
 Let me be your shephard, 
 The mackin Moses I was on it, 
 I was caught up in the moment, 
 Mackin moment of a tone, 
 Askin me to be your man, 
 When you know the answers no, bitch 
 4x chorus
