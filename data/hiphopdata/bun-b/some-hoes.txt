 (Hook: Bun B) 
 I done listened to your music and watched your videos (eos) 
 You niggas ain't trill (trill), you niggas is some hoes (hoes) 
 You fakin on the TV and frontin at your shows (ows) 
 You niggas ain't trill (trill), you niggas is some hoes (hoes) 
 You niggas is some hoes (hoes), you niggas is some hoes (hoes) 
 You niggas ain't trill (trill), you niggas is some hoes (hoes) 
 You keep on disrespectin it, we kick it in your domes (domes) 
 You niggas ain't trill (trill), you niggas is some hoes (hoes) 
 (Verse 1: Bun B) 
 Wake up in the mornin, I turn on the TV 
 What do I see? Some pussy ass niggas starin' at me 
 They got some big ass chains on with big ass rocks 
 A couple niggas standin behind 'em throwin' up blocks 
 They claimin they whip pots, got the streets on lock 
 And they don't take no disrespect and keep their heats on cock 
 And if they punch you in your face then some teeth gon drop 
 Man I don't know where the fuck y'all thinkin' that we from at 
 But you niggas is keystone cops, laurel and hearted 
 Little rascals tryna be big, just gon fuck up the party 
 Thinkin' that cause you drink a couple of fortys and twist phillys (phillys) 
 That y'all is bout to take over the game, bitch really? (bitch really?) 
 You goin' broke tryna slang that crack 
 And you only gon fight a nigga that ain't gon fight back 
 And that's wack, they don't get you no damn props 
 You niggas is sheeps in wolves clothing and I eat lamb chops, c'mon

 (Verse 2: Bulletproof) 
 {What it do? Teflon! } 
 Say Bun what's wrong with em? They must be full of that when they hit it 
 A sucker with the semi, bet he run right when he hear me 
 His niggas masqueradin, faker than silicone 
 A bad apple in the bunch, now we figure your city foldin 
 Homie, I'm from street po, I know how to dish a clip at you 
 Wouldn't you? Break with em, a webster's permission slip 
 Pimp said it best, these niggas transcript writers 
 Pathological liars, sad suckers, dick biters 
 It's Teflon biatch, knock you out them Reeboks 
 A cocaine key, but he only flipped three blocks 
 Blow your brain all over the ceiling like sheet rock 
 I bet he get to ya, take a fader to a T top 
 We hot, Rap-A-Lot and Maab, don't get shot hoe 
 Cappin at your show, don't even know what you got shot fo 
 And next show, you hoe ass niggas squarin some rocks 
 Get some money, move out the hood but don't take care of your block?

 (Verse 3: Chino XL) 
 These niggas is hoes on King's life, Chino is livin' it 
 Jesus Christ is sewing me for copy write infringement 
 Ignorant bully belligerent, tearin out ya ligaments 
 So I deserve a certificate for thinkin' up this killer shit 
 Arrogant, I'm like a Pharaoh standin on a pyramid 
 UGK tat on my heart, hopin Bun's enemies hearin this 
 Y'all ain't sellin nothin' right (serious) 
 The only bricks y'all ever seen was your record sales and when you pass a construction site 
 These rhymes that I write, if you could bring 'em to life 
 They could go in a cage and fight and knock out Kimble Slice 
 I live by the gun, die by the gun 
 Just to get closer to heaven with Pimp C and Big Pun 
 This is Latin history in the making for trill title takings 
 Like taking the love of Bob Marley from a Jamaican 
 Y'all faking but for Bun B we will ride until our heart stops 
 The success make me smile like TV Tego and Bankrock 
 I catch you popping champagne, chop it to your brain 
 Just for thinking outside of the Bun like Taco Bell's campaign

 (Verse 4: Killer Mike) 
 Think you get it with Killer then sucker have a dick 
 I'm a take your funky breath like an asthmatic 
 Damn tragic how I got your momma shot before her damn casket 
 I ain't talkin' head bussin, I'm just talking rap battlin 
 See that was a metaphor, but just in case you really want it 
 What you think the metal for? I hope you pussy niggas get the point 
 I don't care who point it out when my laser on a point 
 Rest in peace to Pimp C cause that nigga had a point 
 Point 1, rappers act gay and dress like it too 
 Point 2, niggas greedy and they never feed their crew 
 Point 3, niggas cower to these crackers like some hoes 
 But always talkin' bout what they-a do after their shows 
 Point 4, just some shit I gotta get offa my chest 
 I ain't scared to battle him but he say that he the best 
 Got a question for my trill ass Gs around the way 
 How you let these fuck boys make it cool to be gay?
