 I'm holdin' on a rope 
 Got me ten feet off the ground 
 And I'm hearin' what your sayin' 
 But I just can't make a sound 
 You tell me that you need me 
 Then you go and cut me down, but wait 
 Tell me that you're sorry 
 Didn't think I'd turn around 
 It's too late 
 Lil Wayne: 
 OK, I'm talkin' about a 
 Good Girl Gone Bad 
 Crooked World, wrong path 
 Right Mom, wrong dad 
 I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you 
 But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luther's 
 In the morning with the boosters 
 On the corner with the boosters 
 And she's the fresh cut and they're on her like sutures 
 And I wanna talk to her 
 But her momma has to school her 
 I wanna see her better 
 She's the weather of my future 
 I don't wanna see another hurricane 
 Baby you can kill the pain 
 If you just let me explain 
 Trust me I know what I'm sayin' 
 You will end up on the track of an oncoming train 
 Stuck in the passenger seat 
 Trying do the fast lane 
 Bun B: 
 Well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad 
 Who on the outside had everything people wished they had 
 A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage 
 And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard 
 See daddy was a doctor 
 And mommy was a banker 
 Mommy's job got outsourced 
 So now mommy's drinker 
 Daddy had a malpractice suit 
 Now he's a snorter 
 And all this shits takin' place 
 Right in front of their daughter 
 She says, "Daddy what's wrong?" 
 But he's just too high 
 "Mommy what we gon' do?" 
 She just get drunk and cry 
 Caught in the middle of two wrongs trying to do right 
 Looking for answers alone in the darkness of night 
 They say... 
 I'm holdin' on a rope 
 Got me ten feet off the ground 
 And I'm hearin what your sayin' 
 But I just can't make a sound 
 You tell me that you need me 
 Then you go and cut me down, but wait 
 Tell me that you're sorry 
 Didn't think I'd turn around 
 You say that it's too late to apologize 
 It's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize 
 It's too late
