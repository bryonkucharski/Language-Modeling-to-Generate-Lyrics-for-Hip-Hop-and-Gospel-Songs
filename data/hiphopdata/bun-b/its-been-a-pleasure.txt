(Chorus: Drake) 
 Emotions in this game run deep 
 So before these haters kill me in my sleep 
 - I'd like to say it's been a pleasure 
 Reppin till my last second through 
 Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do 
 - I'd like to say it's been a pleasure 
 Honored to be somebody they mention 
 But before these niggaz stop payin' attention 
 - I'll just say it's been a pleasure 
 You'll never be somebody they need 
 Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this 
 [*Singing*] Oh, for the H-Town 
 Tonight I'm gon' make some money goooo 
 For the H-Towwwwwn 
 (Bun B) 
 Ladies and gentlemen you're now listenin to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire) 
 Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there) 
 Pay attention, it's the beginnin of a new era (era) 
 Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer) 
 It's like Lasik but are basic 
 Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it 
 Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it 
 Ball up in the club gettin' white boy wasted 
 One shot of PatrÃ'?n, then another one to chase it 
 Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it 
 Been so many places, up and down the interstate 
 Cities that I've never been, wonderin if they fin' to hate 
 Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill) 
 So they can see it for theyself that I keep it trill (I keep it trill) 
 I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip 
 So it's all good (good) don't even trip 
 Believe me it's been a pleasure 
 (Bun B) 
 Man I've been all over the world 
 Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through) 
 What we already done and what we fin' do (do) 
 What we got into, what we gettin' into (to) 
 When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a ginsu ('su) 
 Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama) 
 Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar) 
 From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans) 
 And all points in between just to get the cream (cream) 
 Me and my "II Trill" team on the road flippin (flippin) 
 Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin') 
 Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin (slippin) 
 Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin (slow grippin) 
 Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down) 
 Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town) 
 But we always made it home okay 
 And we still on the road to this day 
 I gotta say it's been a pleasure 
 (Bun B) 
 They say that you never really know 
 What you got till it's gone and can't touch it (touch it) 
 If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it) 
 If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it) 
 But looks can be deceivin, so don't you get it twisted (twisted) 
 Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's) 
 Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days) 
 Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place 
 How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case) 
 And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you) 
 And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin' through) 
 The phone receiver's in your hand starin' at your child (child) 
 And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile) 
 See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be) 
 And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy) 
 So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me 
 For those that overstood me, understand me 
 It's been a pleasure 
 (Drake) 
 I'd like to say it's been a pleasure 
 I'll just say it's been a pleasure [*echoes*]
