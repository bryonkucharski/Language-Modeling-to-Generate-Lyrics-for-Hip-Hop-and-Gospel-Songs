You see me, you know that I'm on my Deen 
 Down to get down anytime by any means 
 Known to be OT, reppin on any scene 
 And all about the paper, we stackin up plenty green 
 From my city to your city, it's all the same 
 These hoes disrespectin, they callin you out your name 
 These niggaz lookin' for work, there's guarantee to lock 
 Put they dope up in they sock, then head out to the block 
 These snitches wearin G uniforms to blend in 
 Yeah we know you one of the ones Feds gon' send in 
 Got caught, out of town, lookin' at a dime 
 So you wanna give other niggaz ya time 
 And here's the new plan, they cut the dope way before you can 
 By the time you get it, you like what the fuck to do man? 
 You better be a certified chef 
 Or your whole sellers fittin to go left to the death 
 And street niggaz ain't got receipts so 
 They fittin to try to sleep yo ass on the d-low 
 Ridin' like Deebo, comin' like Carter 
 You rollin' like Marsellus Wallace, we roll harder 
 Start a situation and we bring it to the end 
 So take a memo motherfucker, send it to a friend 
 Then send it to your kin or whoever care 
 'Cause when we come, we takin' out whoever there 
 Yeah, real talk, this is real nigga attitude 
 Bring it your face, give me longitude and latitude 
 Better show me some gratitude 
 Or I'm a show you why God himself ain't never made a badder dude 
 Then the one standin in front of you 
 Bitch you know what I'm a do and don't call me B, this Mr. Bun to you 
 Motherfucker fix ya grammar 
 The next time you call a nigga bamma, you better have a hammer 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout all that nail shit 
 I'm talkin' 'bout they poppin' off and makin' you bail shit 
 We ride like Amtrak cross country 
 You badder bitch? Then come in front and try to chump me 
 Ah shit, ding, ding goes the bell 
 That's the sign that ya bitch ass is fittin to take a L 
 Don't give it to ya homeboy, take it for yourself 
 And after I give it to ya, you can take it and tell 
 And put in on ya Facebook wall 
 And let your friends see, how a trill nigga took y'all and shook y'all 
 Stompin like a nigga that's ten foot tall 
 But don't trip it's just a friendly game of football 
 Hold up and I'm the Super Bowl quarterback 
 But yo bitch ass? You ain't even much a starter jack 
 Go ahead and take ya team to the showers 
 When we done with the trophy bitch, you can have ours 
 'Cause we packin more power 
 And bound to make ya stop, drop and roll like the fuckin' Twin Towers 
 Hours on the clock goin' by like seconds 
 When you in the middle of a chin check and I wreck it 
 With real live thugs at my beck and call 
 They won't find no trouble disrespectin y'all 
 So you bound to fall, somebody yell "timber!" 
 You fuckin' with the down South King, call me Simba 
 And remember, who the fuck ya talkin' to 
 Or you'll see the pearly gates you'll be walkin' through, fool
