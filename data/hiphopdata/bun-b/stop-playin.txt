I'm the one-man army, Bun B 
 I've never been taken out 
 I keep emcees breaking out 
 I'm bringing real rap back and 
 Taking the faking out 
 I'm clearing all the bullshit out the way 
 To make a vacant route 
 OK, now let the real niggas roll through 
 It's going for you new niggas and the old too 
 It was some bullshit then and it's some bullshit now 
 So I'm just tryna keep the bullshit down 
 They say the rap game needs balance to keep it level 
 Just like the EQ with the bass, mid, and treble 
 And yeah that's true but if you wanna point blame 
 Just be careful about the motherfucking way you aim 
 You blame radio, internet, and politics 
 But see, we all really know it's just a pile of shit 
 You not playing cause your music ain't hitting 
 The people don't like you, stop hating, start quitting muthafucka 
 You saying you the man, that's the key to you 
 Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do 
 It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying 
 You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing 
 Stop playing 
 Niggas be lying, talking about they bust a heater 
 Once I see him, they be more like Justin Bieber 
 Leave it, my rivals underground like SkyZoo's how I do 
 I have 'em laying on the ground bleeding 
 Butt naked with a bullet in his motherfucking head like Erykah Badu 
 I find irony in being in the place where 
 I'm wearing Gucci mane, getting white boy wasted 
 I tell a nigga break bread or take lead 
 I'm trying to get rid of this weight, K-Fed 
 Me and Bun got the gangsta bond 
 We like that once-in-a-lifetime fame, to you that ain't the prom 
 I'm not a fan of no man, I'm not Stan 
 Flow like Viagra, that's why they go, God damn 
 I whip it up in the kitchen like pots and pans 
 I'm God-like, when I'm praying I should stand 
 You saying you the man, that's the key to you 
 Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do 
 It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying 
 You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing 
 Stop playing 
 No rapper can rap quite like I can 
 Now take your best-known rapper and make him a fan 
 I'm the man homeboy, been running the block 
 I make you say Go Reggie and do the wop, ha ha 
 And I'm Doc, the niggas are hating 
 My flow and your swag, it don't relate 
 'Cause I'm great 
 Jewels like Frosted Flakes 
 Light-skinned, just one shade darker than Drake 
 I hold weight when the camera rolling 
 It's like golf how I got the US Open 
 Nigga I'm nice, I see you scoping 
 Think twice before you move that close in 
 That's my dosage, call me tomorrow 
 Look so fly when you call me a barber 
 Everything I write, call me the author 
 Baby I'm back, sorry I lost you
