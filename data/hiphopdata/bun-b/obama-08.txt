 Obama's speech: 
 John McCain stands alone in his stuburn refusal to end the misguided war (Unexpected) 
 That's not the judgement we need, that won't keep America safe 
 We need a president who can face the plex of the future 
 Not keep grasping at the ideas of the past 
 (People cheering) 
 (Verse: Bun B) 
 H-Town 
 The place is here the time is now 
 Election 08' and the day is slowly winding down 
 Fourth of November is the day, Barack Obama is the way 
 Think it's a game? 
 You wanna play not me it's too serious in Texas, G 
 This is history in the making that we blessed to see 
 A new day in direction of the people 
 For way to long America has been separate and not equal 
 We don't need a sequel of four more years 
 America is crying we don't need no more tears 
 We need real ideas about the future 
 Not Wal-Mart is won't hesitate, the streets shoot'cha 
 Health care, energy crisis, the economy 
 Community outreach, a new form of policy 
 Republicans you had ya chance but'cha blew it 
 It's time to turn Texas blue, I thought'cha knew it 
 Obama's speech: 
 The main party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country... 
 For affirm 
 (Crowd chanting) 
 And we are here, we are here because we love this country too much 
 So let the next four years look just like the last state 
 (Crowd cheering) 
 (Verse: Chamillionaire) 
 Yeah 
 When that call coming three in the morning I probably won't be in bed 
 Obama ain't the one that answer I probably goin' be upset 
 War and fear in ya head with hope that I'll make ya scared 
 Supporting the wars for you till they come in and take ya kids 
 Government in the sky and you try'na reach for ya prayers 
 Leading the elevator they try'na get you the stairs 
 Trying me in economy try'na get me some bread 
 They putting Palin on TV and promise me pretty legs 
 Looking the Fox News try'na show some restrength 
 Every answer that I heard from Sarah Palin was lame 
 Tell her Whitehouse we on that porch nothing left to explain 
 I hope that Joe the Plumber got a empty room for McCain 
 Vote Obama Mayne 
 Obama's speech: 
 ... That in America their son could achieve whatever he puts his mind to... 
 Cause that promise that's always set this country apart 
 The true hard work and sacrifice 
 Each of us could pursuit our individual dreams but still come together as one American family 
 Then sure that the next generation can pursuit their dreams as well 
 (Verse: Paul Wall) 
 Paul Wall 
 It's time for a change 
 Two many bad chefs in the kitchen 
 Try'na sell us these war tickets but I ain't try'na listen 
 Too many politicians but now we need a leader 
 That can take us our recession end up hope our freedom 
 I got boys in Iraq and gone for years and months 
 That got two-year-old kids and ain't never seen them once 
 Hey, I got hope so no more jokes 
 On November fourth Barack Obama get my vote 
 Them boys at the capital been playing games for too long 
 It's time clean house so tell them boys to get gone 
 We got the power to make a change in our hands 
 So catch the stallied and go vote take a stand 
 Obama's speech: 
 These challenges are not all of government's fake 
 But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington 
 And the fail policy's of the tourist of the above 
 (Verse: Cory Mo) 
 Cory Mo 
 Surviving is the only option that we have 
 So if you don't get off your ass, you goin' wish that you had 
 It's more than just gas prices 
 We living in a national crisis 
 To see Obama win would be priceless (huh) 
 So vote Democratic and watch the game change 
 Or you can pick McCain if ya wanted to stay the same 
 We all a part of history don't take it for granted 
 Just take it one day at a time and keep both feet planted 
 (Verse: Trae) 
 I woke up seeing a blood feeling like coke out of my franchise greeter 
 Barack Obama that it's time for a change 
 Only it's the last? 'fore my life go down the drain 
 I know a class can give it up and victory go to McCain 
 The economy very pleated in the state of recession 
 But we goin' fight who we fighting for us we hear to bring the pressure 
 It's a message to the wise you need to try before it's late 
 And realize the bath we use to make the one we gotta take 
 Wake up!
