(Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice (echo)) 
 Hold up mayne 
 I know you ain't think we wouldn't fittin to come through with somethin' 
 For the slab 
 You must be crazy nigga 
 You know we come down, this Texas nigga 
 That's off the top ho 
 Hold up, that some shit that'll shake the sidewalk right there 
 Dang, you pop this trunk 
 Bang down this block (Play-Play-Play-Play-Play-N-Skillz) 
 Beat 'em down right quick mayne 
 (Chorus - Play-N-Skillz (Bun B) - w/ ad libs) 
 I'm ridin' slow 
 (I'm in the slab, swangin up the Ave.) 
 I'm ridin' vogues 
 (Sittin' on leather with my shit together) 
 I'm ridin' fo's 
 (I'm doin' dirty while I'm "Ridin' Dirty") 
 I'm ridin' slow 
 (Sittin' on buck and I don't give a fuck, so bitch, what's up?) 
 Beep, beep, so they can see when I'm rollin' through the hood 
 Beep, beep, so they can see how a player grips his wood 
 Beep, beep, I bet they see that now I'm livin' good 
 (Grippin the grain, drippin the stain) 
 I'm ridin' slow 
 (Verse 1 - Bun B) 
 Texas, land of the swang (swang), where boys pop trunk and bang (bang) 
 Come down in a candy thang, hittin that switch (switch), lettin 'em hang 
 Hit me a stang, maybe a lick (lick) 
 Pound of the brown, maybe a brick (brick) 
 Burn that purp inside of the 'gar 
 With a bad ass bitch inside of the car (car) 
 C to the A, D to the I (I), L to the L to the A to the C (C) 
 B to the you to the N to the B, reppin that P to the A to the T (to the T) 
 I'm a dirty South representer, summertime, spring to the fall to the winter 
 O.G. in the game, no beginner, don't take a loss (loss), get with a winner 
 Lobsters on my plate for dinner (dinner) 
 And your bitch is the midnight snack (snack) 
 Break her off when I'm layin up in her (in her) 
 When I'm done I'm a send her right back (back) 
 Iced out chain (chain), frozen wrist (wrist), grip that grain when I close this fist 
 Diamonds up against the wood in the hood and I can't be missed 
 (Chorus - w/ ad libs) 
 (Verse 2 - Slim Thug) 
 Huh, huh, huh 
 I'm ridin' slow, eyes slow, from what I smoke and po' 
 If you ain't smokin' 'dro, then what the fuck you smokin' fo'? 
 With my deposit Thug about to give the world a show (huh) 
 You know the truck gon' glow (glow), you know them screens gon' show (show) 
 You know the fifth gon' fall (fall), you know them fo's gon' crawl (cheah) 
 You know that Texas got to show y'all how we like to ball (huh) 
 My trunk knockin', got 'em watchin like I'm on a stage (I know you see me) 
 Them four fifteens sound like lions bustin' out a cage 
 I'm gettin' paid, been ridin' clean since the 'leventh grade 
 No more braids now, I'm razor on my taper-fade (yeah) 
 I got it made, went to Ike and I got it sprayed 
 Now when I park where it's dark, you can't see the shade (huh) 
 (Chorus - w/ ad libs) 
 (Verse 3 - Bun B) 
 Man, there's a road through the city 
 Leather so soft (soft), paint so pretty 
 Wheels so shiny, rims so new 
 When I hit your hood (hood), what you gon' do? (gon' do) 
 Fall back and break bread with a G though (G though) 
 Might come down, not like me though (me through) 
 Underdog like To' and Beedo (Beedo) 
 Big cheese on me like a Cheeto (Cheeto) 
 Ooh wee though, I'm the throwdest (throwdest) 
 But I guess you already know this 
 J's the freshest, chain the coldest 
 Hard to miss (miss), easy to notice 
 Watch me to show this, easy as pie 
 Bad ass broad, easy on the eye 
 I'm so clean and she's so fly 
 Man we so player and that's no lie 
 When we come through (through), pass on by 
 If you gon' hate, take your ass on by 
 Sittin' on top of the world 
 So really don't need nobody to crash my high (my high) 
 On buck with the stitch and tuck (tuck) 
 These boys know I'm not givin' a fuck (fuck) 
 Try to step and get stuck 
 So don't press your luck, what's up? 
 (Chorus - w/ ad libs) 
 I'm ridin' slow ... 
 I'm ridin' slow ...
