Okay now guess who's back 
 In a black Maybach 
 With a black card on me, better know it's straight like that 
 My nigga we black on black, black on black 
 My Rolex gold, but know my strap all black 
 My nigga we black on black 
 Flag all black 
 Put it all on that 
 My niggas gon' ride for a fact 
 Yeah homie we black on black, black on black 
 One thing that's fact: I'm rich and black 
 I put black on the paint 
 I whip white in the sink 
 I put work on the pike 
 I ain't scared of handcuffs and links 
 Only thing that petrify me is no money in bank 
 I'ma Chevy out there sprayin' bitch, I'll jail bite the crank 
 I'm a shark out the tank, I don't bark I just bite 
 Keep that K all day, don't walk up on me I'll put that knife 
 All gold Dayton spokes strokin' the pavement slow 
 I did that ho a favor and she paid me back in throat 
 I told the kitchen they wasn't cutting the loaf 
 Butcher knife on the shelf like, "Where the fuck the filet Mignon?" 
 Take a close look at my face, the war paint is on 
 Stuck my dick in the world, now I'm raping this song, I'm wrong? 
 Okay now guess who's back 
 In a black Maybach 
 With a black card on me, better know it's straight like that 
 My nigga we black on black, black on black

 Yeah homie we black on black, black on black 
 One thing that's fact: I'm rich and black 
 Man I'm sitting in a black room dressed up in a black fit 
 I'm cleaning my black guns and loading my black clips 
 Count from one to fifty, that's a fully loaded mag 
 I pick it all up and put it in a black bag 
 Put on my black gloves, put on my black mask 
 Pop my trunk and load it up and jump in my black Jag 
 Sipping on black Hennessy out of a black flask 
 And best believe that I'm coming to get your black ass 
 When I pull that Mac out, they know I'm finna black out 
 They start hitting fences, taking alley ways and the back route 
 I caught one of 'em slipping, put that thing up to his back 
 Pulled that trigger on that nigga, and all he saw was black 
 Okay now guess who's back 
 In a black Maybach 
 With a black card on me, better know it's straight like that

 One thing that's fact: I'm rich and black 
 Okay now black lil' nigga, in them all black denims 
 With a Mossberg pump that'll have them sleep in your liver 
 Better watch that shit that you say, my goons don't play 
 That black Glock 9 never leave my side, no way 
 I keep that strap when I pray, even when I bow head to say grace 
 Any nigga bring beef my way, better let that 4-4 spray 
 Yeah nigga that's black on black, my whips all black 
 That Ghost don't fold, them four Diablo's on that 
 And I keep that black Louis bag, racks on racks 
 My bitch so bad, Chinese and black, yeah 
 I'm a wild young nigga, getting rich off rap 
 My Rolex fitted, spent about sixty on that 
 Okay now guess who's back
