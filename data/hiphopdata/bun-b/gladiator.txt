(Intro - Truck Buck - talking) 
 The spirit of Pimp is in here (yeah) 
 Truck Buck (uh huh), never give a fuck (yeah) 
 6300 Westside Port (haha) 
 Southwest Superman (already) 
 Yeah, Trill Gladiators (mayne) 
 Yeah huh, yeah, goons catch ya in the street (yeah) 
 Gladiators we come to your house like Pimp say (no shit) 
 Uh huh and guess what? (what?) 
 We ain't doin' it for no money (what you doin' it for nigga?) 
 Haha, we doin' this for loyalty nigga 
 Tell them niggaz Bun 
 (Verse 1 - Bun B) 
 They thought it was over, they thought that I was done (I was done) 
 They said I wouldn't last, I'm the last one (last one) 
 I'm "Still Standing" like the Goodie to the Mo-B 
 In a black hoodie, it's the O.G., you know me (me) 
 Never bow to no feet or kiss no rings (rings) 
 Hold my own ground, never doin' ho things (things) 
 Just to get accepted (accepted), just to be included ('cluded) 
 Nigga I am from the South, that ain't how we do it (do it) 
 True shit, you and your city must be on some new shit 
 Gettin' on my last nerve, such a damn nuisance 
 Pussy niggaz on the rag, wearin Couture or Juicy 
 You don't like what I say, fuck ya nigga, that's my two cents 
 Opinions is like assholes and I don't like assholes 
 So stick your opinion in your ass ho (in your ass ho) 
 That's for whoever ain't me 
 You just hatin' on a nigga that ya know ya can't be 
 (Chorus - Bun B) 
 I'm a, gladiator, greater than the rest 
 Bring who ever's won a battle, you'll never be the best 
 Got a chest made of metal, a jaw made of steel 
 When I put the hands of God on ya, tell me how it feels 
 I'm a, gladiator, hardest of the G's 
 Bring the biggest you can find, bet I drop him to his knees 
 I bring it to ya now, fuck bring it to ya later 
 And never take no shit up off a hater, 'cause I'm a gladiator 
 (Verse 2 - Bun B) 
 Now make way for the big man (man) 
 'Fore somebody catch a smack from the big hand (hand) 
 Rap-a-Lot is in the building and we in control ('trol) 
 "II Trill" comin' through nigga, make a hole (make a hole) 
 And we ain't askin you but one time 
 Give a fuck if you pedestrian or the one time (time) 
 Nigga you can walk the gauntlet or the gun line 
 We can light the night sky up, like it's sunshine (shine) 
 'Cause I run mine (mine), this is native turf (turf) 
 And we'll squeeze and toss a nigga like he made of Nerf (made of Nerf) 
 He's playin' games like it's Fisher Price (Price) 
 They gonna find your ass gutted with a fishing knife (fishing knife) 
 See now you gotta ask yourself a question 
 Is he really serious or was he just testin? (testin) 
 I hope your answer ain't the latter 
 'Cause I think you just made a mad motherfucker madder 
 (Verse 3 - Bun B) 
 And I don't want to be nobody but 
 Never dick ride or see me swingin' on nobody nuts (nuts) 
 Real hood nigga (nigga), real street nigga (nigga) 
 That'll stand up on his own two feet nigga (nigga) 
 Never been a bitch, never had a plan to be (be) 
 And talkin' down on other niggaz ain't the man in me (me) 
 A man walk it (walk it), exactly like he talk it 
 We can swing it or stalk it till somebody white chalk it 
 You don't want a problem pussy nigga (nigga), so don't bring us up 
 Actin' like you niggaz hard or twistin your fingers up (up) 
 'Cause you be bluffin in the streets 
 I let the dogs out, then I let the hogs out, till it's nothin' in the street 
 There is nothin' industry or Hollywood about me (about me) 
 I'm no studio gangsta (gangsta) but if you want to doubt me (doubt me) 
 Then catch me on the corner (corner) and run up if you wanna (wanna) 
 To kill your pussy ass will be a motherfuckin honor, 'cause 
 (Outro - Truck Buck - talking (Bun B)) 
 Yeah, yeah, ya hear me bitch ass niggaz? 
 Uh huh, any nigga talkin' shit, we comin' to see ya (gladiator) 
 Picnics, to ya house, barbecues, yeah 
 Anywhere, clubs, tell him who comin' Bun (gladiator)
