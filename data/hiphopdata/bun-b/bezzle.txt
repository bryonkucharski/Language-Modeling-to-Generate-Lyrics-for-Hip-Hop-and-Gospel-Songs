Stop the drop top like the bezzles in my watch [Repeat: x3] 
 Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch 
 Stop the drop top like the bezzles in my watch [Repeat: x3] 
 Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch 
 Stop the drop top like the bezzles in my watch [Repeat: x3] 
 Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch 
 (T.i.) 
 I came up bumping Eazy-E, Cube, and Dre 
 (Scarface, OutKast what's happening niggas) Eightball MJG UGK 
 They raised me like santa raised cee 
 I always made the money, money never made me 
 Break me what this bitch you crazy 
 You seen with the freaks don't think she never paid me 
 Pimping get a bitch, break a bitch, hit a bitch, shake a bitch 
 Spit game till I make this shit turn these tricks and get me rich 
 Lick his ass suck my dick bring me back my niggas quick 
 Who you think you fucking with 
 I'm serious about this pimping shit 
 All the niggas I kick it with looking for a richer bitch 
 Get this bitch to take this trick for pounds of weed bricks and shit 
 Broke bitch you get your shit 
 Before I get another bitch who could fix your shit 
 My pimp to strong I ain't with your shit 
 You going to make me split your shit 
 Two things I ain't seen is this you a fony bitch I can't get 
 Eyes on the ride yeah right shut the fuck 
 Stop the drop top like the bezzles in my watch [Repeat: x3] 
 Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch 
 Stop the drop top like the bezzles in my watch [Repeat: x3] 
 Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch 
 (Mjg) 
 Whole mack load it up hard as fine blow it up 
 M-J-G I know you hoes and been exposed enough 
 I cross a tree over bag a bitch in a toaster oven 
 Slam dunk in pimping and her sister if she close enough 
 (Eightball) 
 Look over hear 
 Open up the door and let it cook in hear 
 Grab the mic a watch these niggas tuck there tail and look in fear 
 As I bust around with no shells inside in myself 
 Lyrics like a counseled weapon sending you bitches straight to hell 
 (Mjg) 
 Burning up just like in waco Texas 
 Heating up your neckless 
 Scorching up your afro the devil coming at your 
 Ass any hard one for niggas who really want it 
 M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it 
 (Eightball) 
 Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it 
 24 inches under something smoking tinted 
 Hustle hard for keep it 'cause I love to spend it 
 Pimping love is when your style is when you love to hit it 
 (Bun B) 
 I came a long way from a posta posta 
 Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer 
 Than I'm supposed to well I poast ya procha 
 Ride like a roller coaster 
 Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha 
 Pull out a light and smoke you (damn) 
 Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man 
 Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances 
 Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it) 
 I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it) 
 Mother fuckers get a moving (moving) 
 I born into hustling I grew up tustling 
 Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in 
 My left and right hand grinding threw the night 
 And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man 
 Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on worthless 
 Sprite and you can call it what you like 
 I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel 
 But we ain't sleeping till they free and pimping here that's the fucking drill
