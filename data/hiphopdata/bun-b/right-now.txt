 UHH, she got the whole, world, in her jaws 
 When she feel it tighten up, don't stop and don't pause 
 I got the whole, game, in my head 
 Don't fuck for recreation but I'm good in the bed (good in the bed) 
 Tony Snow, I keep big blow (blow!) 
 My homeboy gal wanna fuck me on the low (low!) 
 But I don't wanna 'less she goin' out on the grind 
 Check-in with the choosin' fee and I'ma knock her from be-hiiiind (knock her from be-hiiiind) 
 I make a bitch bleed to black 
 Wit a certified knot and a platinum cock 
 The pimpin' didn't stop, even when the bids died 
 We just kept on gettin' high, puttin' dick up in they eye 
 Dick up in they ears (ears), dick up in they nose (nose) 
 Ass, pussy, mouth, I'm fin' ta fuck in every hole (hole) 
 Put it between they titties and between they toes 
 That's how a gushy gush out when ya bitch get chose 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 You know, and I know, we need to geeeeeet riiiiiiight 
 I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after miiiiiid-niiiiight 
 So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or sloooooow dooooown 
 You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to goooooo dooooown right now

 Eternally thug nigga, Hilfiger made by Tommy 
 So when I speak, hope to reach my boricua mamis 
 Oh, come to papi, I love it when it's wet and sloppy 
 In and out the mouthpiece until I cum, no one can stop me 
 My bump and grind'll do ya every time 
 Come get a blast of this thug passion that'll blow your mind - hey! 
 Throw up yo' legs, wrap them shits around my back 
 It's a Westside thang fuckin' hoes around the map 
 Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin down hotties 
 And they, seduce my jimmy, out and screamin, "Gimme body!" 
 Make 'em all scream my name out, gimme my props 
 And don't cha, love how this THUG nigga, be at the cot 
 I'm at the Rican Parade, I'm watchin caramel bitches play 
 Get with real niggaz, bullshit'll never get you paid 
 This is the DREAM of a young black teen 
 I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend, now c'mon! 
 (Chorus w/ Songz ad-lib) 
 (Bun B) 
 Look here shawty, lemme tell you what the game is (game is) 
 And while I'm at it, lemme tell you what my name is (What?) 
 Bun Beeda, big D up in my drawls 
 When I pull out my piece, it make the girls all pause 
 Y'allz, niggaz, better recognize 
 When ya bitch choose me, shouldn't come as a surprise (nope) 
 Knew she was a freak, I could see it in her eyes (yep) 
 And I'ma bring it out her when I get between her thighs 
 God-damn~! That's what you call a home-run 
 I knock it out the park when I give her a long one (a long one) 
 It's on, I'm ready, it's strong, it's steady 
 First I'ma, give it some bacon and beat up the belly 
 When the sheets start shippin and the bed starts rockin' 
 And the headboard's bangin', playa don't come knockin' 
 It's a grown folks party, we don't need no kids 
 And I ain't tryna blow you up, but gurl yo' pussy the sheeeeit! 
 (Chorus w/ Songz ad-libs)
