Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around 
 Ain't shit sweet 'bout the peach this Atlanta, clown 
 Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though 
 Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho 
 Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers 
 Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker! 
 These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine 
 And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain 
 Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain 
 Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain 
 We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich 
 Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch 
 These real-ass killers move in silence with violence 
 The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest 
 How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon 
 Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun 
 And you know just how it go 
 We ain't playing round with that bullshit 
 Nigga, we ain't let that shit go 
 When you come here, you better come correct 
 This real G shit, you gotta show respect 
 Once upon a time in the projects 
 An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect 
 Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age 
 So he opened up the G code to the front page 
 He sat me on the porch, said, "This where little dogs sit" 
 Pointed at the yard, said, "That's where big dogs shit" 
 He said, "Don't leave till your ass get growed 
 And don't come back till your ass get throwed 
 Whatever you want is whatever you can have 
 Bring the pain and leave 'em wet, like they soaking in some salve 
 When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya 
 Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia 
 Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping 
 Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen" 
 Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care 
 Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air 
 In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip 
 From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit 
 Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this 
 A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit 
 Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis 
 Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy 
 A record full of felonies, searching for a better me 
 But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv 
 Pretty nigga, let him be fuck him, shorty 
 Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it 
 Quick to round up on that Audi, make 'em get the fuck up out it 
 Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it 
 What's a coward to a kamikaze? 
 He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay 
 I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion 
 Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing 
 Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang 
 Listen to my clip before that five go bang 
 Bang bang, guap time, rep game 
 We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks 
 Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames 
 Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains 
 All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars 
 Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars 
 All of y'all rappers and producers and such 
 No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched 
 Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed 
 If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us 
 I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak 
 Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap 
 I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P 
 Opposite of the sucker shit they play on TV
