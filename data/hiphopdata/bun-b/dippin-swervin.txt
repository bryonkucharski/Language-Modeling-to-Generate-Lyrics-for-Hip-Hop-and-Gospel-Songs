Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 I'm dippin through the city, fresh Jordans on my toe 
 Candy coupe DeVille, ridin' Cadillac bro 
 I'm all up in yo hood, nigga checkin' on my dough 
 Catch me with yo baby momma, checkin' on yo ho 
 A pocket full of bread and I don't mean pita 
 Leanin on this ditch bitch, hand on the heater 
 Your gal on my meter, she begging me to beat er 
 But I really don't want it, damn sure don't need er 
 She a fly mamasita with a big round bottom 
 They come a dime a dozen and I damn sure got em 
 Somebody should've told er that I'm all about the pay so 
 Get up off yo knees, I need the cheese, get the ya sold

 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 I'm dippin' through the city, fresh fitted on my dome 
 Comin' down candy and I'm sittin' on chrome 
 Eighty-Fo's crunkin' and they sqeaky like chrome 
 Make you bitch mouthwater and a nigga straight moan 
 Port Aurthur is the home, mane and Texas is the grill 
 The south is what I rep so you can get it how you live 
 A glass house dropper so they know just who it is 
 With diamonds on the wood 'cause I'm handling my biz 
 I'm jumpin' up the hood so they know just how I feel 
 It's UGK for life but if I'm ridin' for the trill 
 Real just blindin', we do it big time 
 And I'm grippin' on the grip and I slap that shinin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 Dippin' and swerving in my suburban 
 Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin' 
 I'm dippin' through the city, fresh chain upon my neck 
 The hood niggas see me and I'm getting my respect 
 They understand that I ain't playin' with a fork yet 
 If you get up out of line then I'mma put yo ass in check 
 I'm certified partner, better know it when you see 
 They gonna recognize it when you're fuckin' with a G 
 They put me in the cross, I'm sending flowers to your team 
 I'm finna cut some branches down up off your family tree 
 I'm underground king, that's forever and a day 
 And I'mma lay a hater down that up in my way 
 If you can ask him then you can explain 
 Don't fuck with that trill ass nigga from PA
