Hold up 
 It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler 
 It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains 
 To make these motherfuckers peep my game 
 I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow 
 And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city 
 'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll 
 So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters 
 'Cause we some made motherfuckers 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin' 
 Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution 
 It's the corruptor's execution 
 I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital 
 Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter 
 Kind of like a see-saw, up and down 
 A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that 
 There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley 
 Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?" 
 All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya 
 I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin' 
 Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution 
 It's the corruptor's execution 
 I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks 
 I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang 
 It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage 
 And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one 
 I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland 
 Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive 
 And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back 
 With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin' 
 Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution 
 It's the corruptor's execution 
 Now, we get the cash the stash and bash 
 Your brains all over this dashboard 
 Give up the hash, and get you some gas 
 Who'll blast you main in man's sport 
 Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em 
 We stole 'em and brick 'em to death 
 K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin' 
 They last motherfuckin', breath 
 On the real how you feel about caps get peeled 
 I just baby, deal with the talk 
 You backin' the guns and all the law 
 So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong 
 Fuckin' 'em quick in the back with the dick then 
 Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in 
 Keep yours eyes on Nich-en 
 'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin' 
 Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution 
 It's the corruptor's execution 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin' 
 Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution 
 It's the corruptor's execution
