(Bun B) 
 Baby your love is like a drug 
 I need it like a fiend 
 Every time I get it, it's got me gone like a fiend 
 Every time I hit it, it's like the best dro 
 And every time I'm with you I don't wanna let you go 
 See I don't think you know 
 How much you got me sprung 
 I'm walking around pacin' acting high strung 
 Try to go to sleep 
 But when I lay up in my bed 
 All I do is toss and turn to get you out my head (out my head) 
 It won't give me no peace I can't rest 
 Waking up in deep sweat shirt sticking to my chest (to my chest) 
 I feel it deep up in my stomach 
 And no matter how I try just can't run from it (run from it) 
 It's like an itch you can't scratch 
 Waiting on the chef to come through with a fresh batch (fresh batch) 
 I'm trying to keep it together but 
 I'm feeling like I'm going to need you forever 
 You got me on one 
 (Devin The Dude) 
 When I give you a call you don't answer your phone 
 When I pass by your house girl you're never at home 
 I'm doing everything I can just to leave you alone 
 'Cause it's like 
 And everywhere I went man I was looking for that ho 
 I'm going crazy it just ain't fair 
 I'm in the streets looking for you everywhere 
 People stop and they stare 
 But I just don't care 
 'Cause it's like 
 And everywhere I went man I was looking for that bitch, oh shit 
 (Gator Main) 
 Hey why you never at home 
 Why you never answer your cellular phone 
 Who that little bitch in front doorway 
 I'm gonna tell her you gone 
 How she know where I stay anyway 
 Hey what the hell are you on 
 I'm in the 5-50 bumping my (?) 
 With a lil' yellow bone watching my television 
 She in love with a nigga but she just won't admit it 
 Look why you playing hard to get? 
 Why you just want some niggas 
 We in Kansas City 
 I'm the man in the city 
 I'm (?) in the city 
 Say god dammit she pretty 
 I'm a sucker for hookers 
 But don't be tricking no dollars 
 How bout we gather our children off in a little country cottage 
 And this coupe with no mileage 
 Plus my passenger (?) 
 Now we way down in Houston with ambassador Bun 
 I'm an ace in the hole 
 Your nigga a rapper with guns 
 I'm the jack of all trades 
 And bitch he the master of none

 I saw your friend the other day 
 She acted like she knew something I didn't 
 Then she turned around and started grinning 
 Like I was the butt of a joke 
 The last to know 
 Started to ask where you were 
 She acted like she had to go 
 Quick, birds of a feather I guess 
 I'm cold and sick, but nevertheless 
 I'm aight, can't sleep at night 
 I turn and I toss 
 Call you cellphone, but you turned that ho off 
 So I pace the floor 
 I can't wait no more 
 I try to find you but you know I won't chase you though 
 Now I'm going through some withdrawals 
 Without you I've gotta go and settle for some big drawls 
 And all I want to do is get another dose 
 I tried that other shit but you know what I love the most 
 I plug your hole if you let me 
 But you got me feeling all lonesome 
 Yah, I'm on one
