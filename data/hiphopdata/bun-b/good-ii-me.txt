(Feat. Mya) 
 Bun B: 
 Baby girl lookin' good, feel real thick 
 Real pretty, real fly, she a real chick 
 Lookin' for a real player to adore ya 
 But look no further, I'm the player for ya 
 Sittin' big on the 20-somethin' inch thangs 
 Leanin on the leather, grippin grain with them big rangs 
 Big piece, big chain with the big ice 
 You wanna roll? You ain't gotta ask the kid twice 
 Push a button, the do's open up for ya 
 I save the shotgun seat up in the trunk for ya 
 Stitch and tuck, so you know that I'm a boss 
 With the red candy paint lookin' like spaghetti sauce 
 You wanna floss with a G, keep it real 
 It ain't no need in you lyin', to the king of the Trill 
 You either won't or you will 
 Just keep it one hundred with a player baby tell me how you feel 
 C'mon 
 (Chorus One: Mya) 
 People always talkin' bout - they be sayin' they be sayin' they be sayin' 
 Your reputation - how you got a lot of hoooooes, but I don't really give a 
 I don't care what you did to them~! Just be good to me (be good to me) 
 Just be good to me (just be good to me) just be GOOD! 
 Bun B: 
 You want me to be good, then I'm a be the best 
 And I'm a give you top shelf baby nuttin less 
 Front do' to the, front row 
 Whatever, you need just let, Bun know (Bun know) 
 First class flights, penthouse suites 
 You want sushi? We go to Japan to eat 
 You want pasta? We fly to Milan 
 That's how it is in the life of a don 
 We eat filet mignon in Pa-ris 
 That's how it is when you rollin' with a G 
 Your man want it but he ain't thar rich 
 Trust me baby I can scratch that itch 
 Never call you a bitch when you act like a lady 
 You carry yourself like a woman and we gravy 
 Ain't no maybe, I know I can 
 Put the whole wide world in the palm of your hand baby 
 (Chorus 2: Mya) 
 People always tellin' me - they be sayin' they be sayin' they be 
 That you're a player 
 I don't care 'bout them other girls~! Just be good to me (be good to me) 
 Just be good to me (just be good to me) just be GOOD! 
 Mya: 
 I said, I'll hold you down when you need me 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gon' always be around 
 I'll give you all my love 
 If you treat me right baby, ooh 
 Bun B: 
 Girl anything you wishin I can make it come true 
 Have you lookin' like a million dollars when you come through 
 With'cha Louboutin shoes, or Jimmy Chu's 
 Giuseppe, Zanetti or whatever you wanna do (you wanna do) 
 Louis V, Dior, Prada or Gucci (Gucci) 
 Richard Roy, Chanel, or maybe Coogi (Coogi) 
 Dolce and Gabbana or Valentino's (Tino's) 
 Ferragamo, Mark Jacobs, Malandrino's (Drino's) 
 Maybe Fendi or Yves St. Laurent 
 Versace, KLS, or whatever that you want 
 It ain't a thang to buy you some Vera Wang 
 You gotta look like a Queen for you to be with the Kang 
 The fancy cars with the butterfly do's 
 Big mansion with the marble on the flo's 
 The world is yo's but here's the key 
 When I'm bein good to you, be good II me 
 (Chorus 1 + Chorus 2: with ad libs) 
 Mya: 
 In the morning 
 In the evening baby 
 If you treat me good I'm a gonna keep on comin' to ya 
 La la la la la lah 
 La la la la la lah 
 You're all that I know, just be good to me
