You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas 
 Good girls gotta get down with the gangstas 
 Go 'head, girl, put some back and some neck up on it 
 While I stand up in the background and check up on it 
 Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see 
 Won't you come over and check up on it? I'm gon' let you work up on it 
 Ladies, let 'em check up on it; watch it while he check up on it 
 Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight 
 If you got it, flaunt it; boy, I know you want it 
 While I turn around, you watch me check up on it 
 Ooh, you watchin' me shake it; I see it in ya face 
 Ya can't take it; it's blazin'; you watch me in amazement 
 You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it 
 If you don't go braggin', I'm-a let you have it 
 You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason 
 I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you 
 I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gone make you chase it 
 You got to be patient; I like my men patient 
 More patience you'll take might get you in more places 
 You can't be abrasive; have to know to pace it 
 If I let you get up on it (you gotta make a promise) 
 That you gon' put it on me like no one's put it on me 
 Don't bore me; just show me; all men talk, but don't please 
 I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you 
 Well, it's the king of the underground and the king of the trill 
 Standin' on the top of the soft like the king of the hill 
 You tuned into a winner that's never taken a loss 
 Reppin' music with Beyonce and Slim Thug the boss 
 Diamonds on the wood wheel; I'm a Dirty South soldier 
 Draped up in (?) Holder; thought I told you 
 I like your wiggle and the way that you work it 
 But no judging, just watchin' you twerk it; I'm checkin' up on you tonight
