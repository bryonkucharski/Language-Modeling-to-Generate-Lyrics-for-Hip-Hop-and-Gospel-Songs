Fuck a rubber band a nigga need a buncha birds (X4) 
 (Over intro - Gucci Mane (Yo Gotti)) 
 Yo, it's Gucci, brrrr, R.I.P. Pimp C mane, brrrr 
 (This that straight my, straight my) 
 Money all day, count money all day 
 Count money all day, count money all, money all 
 Count money all day, count money all day, count money all 
 Money all, money all, money all day 
 (Bun B - Verse 1) 
 Say mane, no matta where I go, no matter what I do 
 If chillin' wit' myself, or ballin' wit' my crew 
 The skies is lookin' cloudy or Bahama water blue 
 I got that money on my mind, so tell me what it do 
 And if you be like me, then you already knew it 
 We goin' for the money then we goin' right through it 
 Take it to the table baby, chop it up and screw it 
 'Cause it ain't nothin' to it where come from, but to do it 
 We get it in our hands, and then it go right through the fingas 
 We standin' on the system in a fresh set of swangas 
 We pop a couple tags, put some fresh up on the hangas 
 That everyday struggle and can't nair nigga change us 
 Believe that I was famous 'fore I ever did a song 
 Believe I had a poppin' 'fore a label put me on 
 It's 2010 and I ain't seein' nothin' wrong 
 But niggas countin' money all day fuckin' long 
 (Yo Gotti - Verse 2) 
 Money totin', pistol carrying young nigga thugged out 
 Very first song I ever dropped was in a drug house 
 Razor blades, sandwich bags, Louis shoes, stoopid swag 
 Rubber bands, duffle bags, small bills, trash bags 
 Apple chain on my neck, you know that cost stoopid cash 
 Maserati for the wash, that's that foolish cash 
 Penitentiary chances, '6's on a muscle car 
 Bun helped me keep it real and watch it take me far 
 My money don't fold, this money here 
 I ain't make it for no hoes, I ain't get this off of shows 
 Count money all day, count money all night 
 Trust no one wit' my paper, so I count my paper twice 
 I been on wit' out my paper, so I sleep wit' it at night 
 Now I wake up wit' to my paper so I start my day off right 
 They call me Cocaine Gotti, and it's money over bitches 
 Mr. Everything White, he be always in the kitchen 
 (Gucci Mane - Verse 3) 
 It's me Gucci 
 I'm the shit bitch you smell me 
 Ain't no need to check ya sneakers 
 Three bricks, plus a split wit' me, then bitch you got a hit 
 Big money on my leisure, pop bottles wit' top models 
 Wit' my goons in Puerto Rico, yo' girlfriend I'ma freak her 
 Believe me I'm a giant, leave it to the lemurs (?) 
 I only see my paper plus my cojan on the Sanyo 
 The hottest rapper that you know, people look like Cujo (Gucci) 
 I get a thousand million ties and sold your guys for uno 
 So tune into East Atlanta, please don't change the channel ma 
 Roll the windows down back up 
 In my Phantom show my automa 
 Hangin' out my partner, naw 
 Don't you want this autograph? 
 Thinkin' that you angry 'cause my neck look like the Mardi Gras
