(Bun B) 
 Now if you got it on yo mind 
 I can get it off your chest 
 Take it out yo mouth and I'm gon' take care of the rest 
 No stress, just do-do, when I'm jumpin' out the 4-door 
 Smoke'll hit you like judo when you walk up to the yuko 
 When I let the top down, sippin lean still ballin' 
 TV's in the visors so the screens still fallin' 
 Niggaz grab hustlin' I ain't finna break my neck 
 I make some paper off this flow, but I got rich off respect 
 Ask anybody who know me about my seeds 
 Westside 9th street, I came up amongst the G's 
 Crack game in 88, it took over shit I was there 
 I stood on southern through Texas and got my share 
 And my nina on my waist, dope up in my jaw 
 One eye for them fiends, one eye for that law 
 Niggaz crooks as niggaz soft, so my rep is hard as steel 
 Big Bun muthafucka, representin' for the trill 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 If you haters you gon' like us 
 If you like us you gon' hate us 
 But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers 
 'Cause, friends turn to haters 
 And, some turn to traitors 
 But my money never changes (mhum) 
 So in Money We Trust 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 When white America stares at the pair of eyes in a colred face 
 Can they see why he love to chase 
 Green fetti in a gutta place 
 He grew up so he love the taste 
 For diniro's hes a disgrace 
 Denies that he's tellin' a lie lookin' right in his mother's face 
 Can't reside, in his brother's 'states 
 But out ridin' on dub's he take 
 What's hidin' above his waist, and go ride out some other fake 
 He's claimin' that he's real, but when he's not on that camera 
 Hed rather give stuff to these hoes, like he's copyin' Santa 
 When he's not on that camera, he's talkin' like he Pac with his grammar 
 But he will not cock or pop the top of his hammer 
 Money's the reason why rich people get red-dots on they flannels 
 While bank-tellers gotta get down on the floor like Dave Banner 
 Go ta spot in that 'Bama, and also got a spot in that channel 
 Few people know I got a spot to stash that knot in Atlanta 
 Don't trust the chick I with, she fine and mixed with another race 
 But I keep the combination to my safe in a safe in another place 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 If you haters you gon' like us 
 If you like us you gon' hate us 
 But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers 
 'Cause, friends turn to haters 
 And, some turn to traitors 
 But my money never changes (mhum) 
 So in Money We Trust 
 (Slim Thug) 
 A lot of folks say when Slim got a lil change he changed 
 I ain't gon' lie yeah I changed, but it was for the better mayne 
 When I was broke ain't have to worry bout gold-diggin' hoes 
 When I was broke I ain't have to worry bout jackers tryin' to get my dough 
 Haters bustin' the .44's, 'cause I'm stickin' they chicks 
 I got a lot of best friends quick, when they heard I was rich 
 And them niggaz I used to ride with, stack cash, get high with 
 Is the same niggaz on my side, them the same niggaz I'ma die with 
 Some friends turn foes, and some men turn hoes 
 But that's how the shit goes, when you ain't broke no more 
 Money the root of all evil, it could help or hurt people 
 You can't live without it so it tend to turn good guys evil 
 A lot of folks love money, more then they love theyself 
 I rather be dead then broke takin' death chances for wealth 
 I know niggaz'll kill you for scrilla and won't think twice to bust 
 Yo life ain't worth shit to us, (mhum) IN MONEY WE TRUST! 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 If you haters you gon' like us 
 If you like us you gon' hate us 
 But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers 
 'Cause, friends turn to haters 
 And, some turn to traitors 
 But my money never changes (mhum) 
 So in Money We Trust
