Triller 
 Say ain't nobody triller 
 I'm a motherfuckin' killer 
 Say ain't nobody triller 
 And you know it's for real 
 Wake up in the morning, give thanks to the Lord 
 For giving me another day so I can go hard 
 Never been fraud, always kept it true 
 Get dressed, hit the street try ta' see what it do 
 Cut a few corners, chunk a few dubs 
 Get 'em, jump back, trill niggas show love 
 Some try to hate, I don't pay it no mind 
 Either get with me or get like me, that's on the grind 
 Candy paint shine as I flip through the city 
 Ridin' 84s, and them hoes look pretty 
 Had dirty money way before P Diddy 
 I'm just tryna squeeze a little mo' milk up out the titty is ya with me? 
 I'mma put it down my nigga 
 Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga 
 Boys talking down on a nigga 
 But since day one I've been a killer mayne and ain't nobody triller 
 Say ain't nobody triller 
 I'm a motherfucking killer 
 H-Town in this bitch 
 And you know it's for real 
 Riding drop top in the Fleetwood Lac 
 The sun is shining down on my Astro's hat 
 I'm all about the cheese but I never been a wreck 
 Gotta keep it to yo self, what part of the game is that? 
 You see me rollin' 4's on them foes, just flipping 
 Leaning on the leather through the Southside dipping 
 You know I got the gat up on my lap with the clip in 
 Cock back ready but these boys ain't tripping 
 Who run this bitch? Don't even bother 
 My granddaddy did, he passed it to my father 
 My father did his thing like a G 
 He passed it down to me 
 Now the neighborhood belong to Bun B, OG 
 I'mma put it down my nigga 
 Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga 
 Boys talking down on a nigga 
 But since day one I've been a killer manye and ain't nobody triller 
 Say ain't nobody triller 
 I'm a motherfucking killer 
 P.A. in this bitch 
 And you know it's for real 
 Pussy niggas need to stay off in they lane 
 Sitting sidelines, want to quarterback the game 
 Back seat drivers get to talking too much 
 But not when I'm around, 'cause they know they get touched 
 This the city called Clutch, and that's how we come through 
 Fake niggas runnin' up? What the fuck they gon' do? 
 P.A. trill nigga, no Hilfiger 
 Put it on yo ass, before when we still we'll nigga 
 New niggas in the game, get your share 
 Long as you ain't touching mine, bitch I really don't care 
 Sets in the air, twist yo fingers till they break 
 Trill recognize trill, we never roll fake for the game 
 I'mma put it down my nigga 
 Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga 
 Boys talking down on a nigga 
 But since day one I've been a killer mayne and ain't nobody triller 
 Say ain't nobody triller 
 I'm a motherfucking killer 
 H-Town in this bitch 
 And you know it's for real
