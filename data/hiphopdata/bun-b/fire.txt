 It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Serani and Bun B 
 (Serani) 
 When the heat is on we burn hotter than fire 
 People will burn up on, we burn hotter than fire 
 Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with fire 
 Whether life or death, guess we're far from fire 
 (Bun B) 
 Murder murder redrum - mami, I done dead them 
 Rude boy like Ashanti, take his motherfucking head from 
 His shoulders, this is Bedlam - mayhem, chaos 
 Competition cease and seckle already, they lost 
 Thinking they boss like the Triple C's CEO 
 Fuck them, they would be D.O.A ASAP, you see me, ho 
 Me, you, and D.O.G, that's why the fuck they ducking me 
 Rude boy, now deal with the fuckery, we bucking G 
 The ghetto red hot, the youth and the care play 
 Pussy and lit up match shots now in the air 
 Motherfucker beware till I retire or expire 
 Cyanide in them, know that we are coming with more fire 
 (Serani) 
 When the heat is on we burn hotter than fire 
 People will burn up on, we burn hotter than fire 
 Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with fire 
 Whether life or death, guess we're far from fire 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Big belly man, big belly man man 
 Big belly man, I'm that big belly man 
 Big black benz, 20% tints 
 100 niggas on my team, 20% friends 
 After four or five lines you know this organized crime 
 Me still buying jewels, I got on more than last time 
 This not a past time, this a landslide 
 And I'm bringing more fire, better get your hands up 
 Get out my beamer, you know I like my trigga finger crew 
 Get with a boss and maybe you could get a beamer too 
 Burning down the strip from Texas to Kingston 
 As a dime stand in line just dying to squeeze in

 Who want to test this? Titty 2 necklace 
 Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe 
 Balling like the ESPY's 
 Drinking on that Texas 
 Sexting. texting, aggravated flexing 
 Did it for the money and the fame came with it 
 Connect from the island and the cane came with her 
 Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop 
 Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried off 
 They got a stretcher with your name on 
 Shoot a nigga and I'll dash like Damon 
 Insane in the membrane 
 2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz

 When the heat is on we burn hotter than fire 
 People will burn up on, we burn hotter than fire 
 Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with fire 
 Whether life or death, guess we're far from fire
