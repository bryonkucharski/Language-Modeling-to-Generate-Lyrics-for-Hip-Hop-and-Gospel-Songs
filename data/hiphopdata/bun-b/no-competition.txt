'Cause them boys keep challenging me 
 So I'm gon' make sure I can drop 'em (drop em) 
 Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock em) 
 Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back) 
 Aim! (I will let it go)

 (But there's no competition)

 Staircases and aces, razor blade cameras and scrapers 
 Get through it big, I got the rhythm to bend cages 
 Choppa mad, places in front 
 We just stunt, you know my shakers 
 All of them shoot just like the Lakers 
 Paper fryers and Goliath, mission attired, he wired 
 Kill that nigga with the quick fast and tie it 
 Check that Houston goose and the cranberry will loosen niggas up 
 Quinton thought he was straight just like moose and 
 Stat and Pharell bustin' them bow and arrows 
 We touch so we lowin sparrow 
 Chums is long and goofy like cousin Cowell 
 Truth or fire, dope fiends get crucified 
 Both teams is super loud 
 Me and Buns, the underworld is ours nigga 
 Pantries is filled with nothing but blow and scampy shrimps 
 Try to stop me nigga, shoot through his eyes 
 Blow tryin' to cope, coppin' the stove, he drove pop us 
 'Cause them boys keep challenging me

 Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock em)
