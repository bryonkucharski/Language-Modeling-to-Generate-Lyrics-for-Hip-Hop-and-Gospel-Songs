Breaker breaker one-nine, runnin' from the one-time 
 They on my ass, they don't like the way I done mine 
 While I do mine, I'm on a true grind 
 They was bound to hate a nigga like me and do time 
 A real nigga, a trill nigga 
 A "down to get down, don't make me have to kill" nigga 
 'Cause I will nigga, on the real nigga 
 Hit you in ya back from waist down you won't feel nigga 
 When that banana clip peel nigga 
 It drop tall, short, big and lil' niggaz 
 Then it drop house niggaz and field niggaz 
 So you better watch your back, we on your hill nigga 
 So you best be on your toe nigga 
 We layin' down real niggaz and hoe niggaz 
 Layin' down his niggaz and yo' niggaz 
 Them niggaz, those niggaz, anything goes niggaz 
 Catch you at the studio or at the show nigga 
 Comin' out the barbershop or jewelry sto' nigga 
 At the Chevron or at the Texaco nigga 
 Wit'cha main bitch, or wit'cha side hoe nigga 
 Waitin' at the front, back and side do' nigga 
 Soon as we see ya you know we lettin go nigga 
 And we don't care about the set you throw nigga 
 Or the hood you represent, what fo' nigga? 
 You got fo' niggaz? You need mo' niggaz 
 So bring a friend, maybe ten, even though nigga 
 And even then nigga, you can't win nigga 
 Not when you tryin' to fuck with B-U-N nigga 
 I got them fresh up out the pen' niggaz 
 Who don't give a fuck about goin' back in nigga 
 And you don't wanna know where they been nigga 
 And you don't wanna go where they send niggaz 
 'Cause whenever they begin nigga 
 They ain't stoppin' till your heartbeat end nigga 
 So ain't no need to pretend nigga 
 Like we cool, you ain't my motherfuckin friend nigga 
 You way down with me, you're my men nigga 
 So we can get it poppin', just say when nigga 
 I come around the bend and straight bend niggaz 
 Take your blood in the mud and make it blend nigga 
 Now watch the chopper slug spin niggaz 
 Like Michael Joe Jackson singin' "Ben" nigga 
 And when I check you on your chin nigga 
 It's R.I.P. for you just like him nigga 
 Reppin P.A.T. live from Houston nigga 
 And we don't give a fuck, we gets it in nigga 
 'Cause we off niggaz, then we in niggaz 
 Like Frankie "Man Down Code 10" nigga 
 Blowin' stanky puttin' 'dro up in the wind nigga 
 Pass the cup, I'm 'bout to po' me up some Henn' nigga 
 Pimp has slept the same way, I pimp the pen nigga 
 And God only made one, it's no twin nigga 
 The closest thing to me was my brother nigga 
 And after me, there will never be another nigga 
 Not a tighter nigga, or a tougher nigga 
 Or a righter nigga, or a rougher nigga 
 That'll leave a chicken-hearted nigga smothered nigga 
 And if you didn't know then you finna discover nigga 
 While we make these pussy niggaz run for cover nigga 
 They screamin for they daddy and they fuckin' mother nigga 
 'Cause we ain't scared to squab and straight duff[?] a nigga 
 This Rap-A-Lot, the mob ain't tryin' to cuff a nigga 
 They even sendin undercover niggaz 
 That's why you gettin' stuffed up in the duffle nigga 
 So spy all you wanna spy nigga 
 And keep on tryin' all the fuck you wanna try nigga 
 Not me and my niggaz, you know why nigga? 
 This UGK for life until we die nigga 
 That's true stories, no lie nigga 
 Bet yo' ass you can put that on P-I nigga 
 We gon' ride for H-Town like G.I. nigga 
 And got no love for a motherfuckin C.I. nigga 
 Naw, you ain't gettin' in, is you high nigga? 
 We been keepin' game, you ain't sly nigga 
 My pistol never jam like it's Guy nigga 
 And it's known to make a nigga's momma cry nigga 
 Trill niggaz known to make the slugs fly nigga 
 Them bullets droppin' like it's rain from the sky nigga 
 And when it's over ain't no need in askin why nigga 
 You gettin' no reply nigga, bye nigga!
