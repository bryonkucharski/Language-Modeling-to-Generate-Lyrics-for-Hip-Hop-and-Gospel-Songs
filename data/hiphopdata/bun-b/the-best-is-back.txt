(Intro - talking) 
 God damn! (God damn!) 
 Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house? (motherfuckin house) 
 The King of the Trill bitch, you guessed it 
 "UGK 4 Life" ho (4 Life ho) 
 You already know how we gettin' down this time around (time around) 
 We representin for the po' town (po' town), bitch 
 And the motherfuckin best is back 
 Hold up, yeah 
 Ladies and gentlemen, you already know that it's him again 
 Lettin 'em hang, non-feminine, crunk like I'm gone off Ritalin 
 Chopped off top, there's no middle and throwed on that load again 
 With no vodka, show shocker, mo' rocker 
 In the slab (in the slab), "Bend It Like Beckham", no soccer (no soccer) 
 And no doctor can diagnose, the symptom when I approach 
 My victim, from the back and tie the rope (rope) 
 And throw 'em over the ledge 
 Like Blanket, throw a thrower over your head, all over your dead 
 Go 'head quote 'em, he said it was bound to happen (happen) 
 When you fuck around with the clowns and down for clappin (clappin) 
 Get strapped, ready to pop rounds up out the Magnum (Magnum) 
 When they hop out and jack 'em (jack 'em) 
 Call the coroner to come out and wrap 'em 
 Put him under the tree, so every one of ya can see 
 That ain't no fuckin' with the Bun to the B, niggaz 
 "Guess who's back? Me" 
 "There's no competition, huh, 'tion" 
 "Aww sh-shit, hold up" 
 "Guess who's back? Shut 'em down" 
 "Hurt-hurtin' boys" 
 "It's over, it's over" 
 "'Cause the best is back bitch" 
 It's Bun Beeder mayne, ridin' with the heater mayne 
 Niggaz know that I'm the hardest out since the peta mayne (mayne) 
 Hot doggin, yeah smoke dog comin' out foggy 
 Lettin off at your toes, hi froggie (hi) 
 My third leg loggy and your bitch is a lumberjack 
 You'd of killed that ho if you knew what I'd done to that (to that) 
 She chopped my tree down, often if I slumber jack 
 Beggin me to call but shit I don't know where her number at (at all) 
 And on the cool, I ain't lookin' for it either though 
 Or the bitch before her, no I ain't lookin' for neither ho (naw) 
 It ain't like I really need her though 
 Once she drop to her knees and let me skeet it out, nigga she can go (go) 
 Lead her out like a blind man walkin' 
 Like Sandman dancin, it's over, stop talkin' 
 I'm sparkin mo' dodo (dodo), blazin' mo' kush up (kush up) 
 Comin' mo' harder than a no hand push-up (push-up) 
 Let's pass the peas like we used to say and put it down like we used to play 
 Let's make the news today and leave some cement in they shoes today 
 Say what we choose to say and lay down who we choose to lay 
 And we leave 'em laid (laid), while we leavin' paid (paid) 
 Fair and square nigga, sound like an even trade (trade) 
 Triple cross and we leave 'em sprayed (sprayed) 
 Spayed and neutered, no matter how much you pray to the shooter's face (face) 
 'Cause there's no emotion ('motion) and there's no elation ('lation) 
 Then he realizes the reaper of the show he facin (facin) 
 Secret words like a holy mason (mason) 
 Was all he heard before I took his head off (head off) and I blew his face in (face in) 
 Who ya chasin? Ain't no catchin up 
 Keep ya weapon tucked, be ready to buck and knuckle up, whenever you steppin up 
 Takin' it as your guns are just, the fact that leavin' it less is crap 
 Never leave less than that 
 It's just a fact that nigga the best is back, bitch (yeah)
