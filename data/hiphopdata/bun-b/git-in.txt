 Say you got them yams and you sittin' on some yay! (yay!) 
 Asked him for a ten piece, he hit me with a trey! (trey!) 
 Got me fucked up, partner; who you tryna play? (play!) 
 Keep your dirty dope, your shit ain't butter anyway. - O-kay?

 Thirty karats in the piece got your girl eyein' me. (mommy!)
