Down in the dirty south to be exact 
 Gettin' money gettin' money is a well known fact 
 Welcome to Atlanta, GA 
 I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin' 
 My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin' 
 My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters 
 Then I make 'em come around like curl activator 
 There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene 
 Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team 
 But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players 
 And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers 
 I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres 
 I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers 
 So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors 
 Cause rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper 
 Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches 
 Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest 
 I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters 
 Like the lens on your camera, fuck, boy I'm so focused!

 Welcome to Miami, FL 
 20 grand in the left 
 Another 20 in the right 
 Got my wallet in the back 
 And that thing packed tight 
 Credit cards don't need 'em 
 All the birds won't feed 'em 
 While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin' 
 E-class on the cell; discussing another mill' 
 Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill 
 Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar 
 If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz' 
 I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox 
 If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box 
 Outta town for a month 
 Came home with a duffel that was one point something 
 Getting brain and I love it 
 Pimp, ask Khaled. Lobster salad 
 Mobster acknowledge I'm popping them dollars 
 Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow 
 The game in a choke hold 
 No I won't let go

 Welcome to Houston, TX 
 Well I done said said it before 
 But I guess it's best to repeat it 
 Dirty south in the building 
 With no losses we undefeated 
 Anybody think they can beat it must be on sherm 
 Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm 
 I'm big worm and that big body slayer 
 Rip it open and you keep playing with my money 
 Smoke it like I'm a joke 
 I go for broke on the boulevard 
 In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank 
 You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble 
 Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble 
 I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down 
 So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down 
 You can get your issue like your ass subscribed 
 And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide 
 Nigga try to come at me crooked like burners play craves 
 Have you running up north like a runaway slave 
 Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period 
 The dirty south niggas take their money too serious nigga
