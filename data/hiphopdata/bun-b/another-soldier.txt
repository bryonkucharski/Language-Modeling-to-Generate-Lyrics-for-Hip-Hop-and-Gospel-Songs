Bun B: 
 Remorse. 
 Vengeance. 
 Lost of a loved one. 
 Relative in commander in the game of life, in which one chose to adapt to as a gangsta. 
 Enter my mind. 
 Fill my heart. 
 My emotional pain. 
 Can you feel it? 
 Naw. 
 Can you feel it? 
 If you haven't experienced that nature of life, it's gutter. 
 (Chorus: Cobe) 
 I got this drama 
 Don't worry mama 
 'Cause I got the armor 
 On my back when I 
 Drive through the streets 
 Everybody on me 
 Tryin' to take my life 
 But I don't give a 
 What about that 
 Grip that thing 
 Cock that back 
 You don't wanna be, gone 
 Another goner, gone 
 In the game, gone 
 Another Soldier, gone 
 In a grave, gone 
 Bendin' corners, gone 
 Finna bang, gone 
 Another Soldier, long gone 
 In the grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave. 
 Bun B: 
 We are the mighty Mddl Fngz 
 We do not accept hate 
 Love us or die. 
 Mddl Fngz: 
 Yeah fat boy slow, but a nigga ain't quick 
 Hoe limped through the door, lay a nigga on his dick 
 Open up the door, nigga standin' like shit 
 15 full bricks, same price for a hit 
 Nigga I done done it, it ain't gotta be a lick 
 And if I'm plexin' with you partner then the chopper gon' piss 
 Shootin' up your corner make a sound like "Swish" 
 But I low so ghat cause the chopper don't miss. 
 Bun B: 
 No the chopper gon' hit 
 Bound to leave your dome split 
 Lose your bodily functions 
 Have me think you gon' shit 
 Mddl Fngz, strong click 
 Bun B, the strong spit 
 Put you 6 feet under 
 Why not have a long sit 
 Long walk, short pier 
 Mane have a long flip 
 Got the streets on lock 
 And got the yola on whip 
 Tell mama we comin' home so don't trip. 
 Mddl Fngz: 
 If I Tee, don't worry 'about me 
 Mama I'm a G 
 I know how to handle niggas tryin' to come up on me 
 Tryin' to run up on me 
 Thinkin' you gon' try me 
 Shit in a bag 
 Drinkin' through a IV 
 So appreciate your breath 
 While you got some left 
 Your life's a bitch 
 They got permanent PMS 
 And my only fear of death is reincarnation 
 So it ain't shit for me to make you niggas ER patients 
 Another Soldier in the grave. 
 (Chorus: Cobe) 
 I got this drama 
 Don't worry mama 
 'Cause I got the armor 
 On my back when I 
 Drive through the streets 
 Everybody on me 
 Tryin' to take my life 
 But I don't give a 
 What about that 
 Grip that thing 
 Cock that back 
 You don't wanna be, gone 
 Another goner, gone 
 In the game, gone 
 Another Soldier, gone 
 In a grave, gone 
 Bendin' corners, gone 
 Finna bang, gone 
 Another Soldier, long gone 
 In the grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave. 
 B.A.N.D.I.T: 
 2 9's 4 clips 
 Prayin' that you niggas trip 
 Lookin' for some trouble 
 Finna bust you niggas bubble 
 And I don't give a fuck about your happy meal mug 
 We can go toe to toe or trade these slugs 
 So catch a square nigga 
 And I won't budge 
 Don't plea bargain now, nigga save it for the judge 
 I might have you niggas lookin' like a strawberry Fanta 
 Did so much, done burned myself, retire my bandanna 
 Southwest got them soldiers 
 Some movin' doja 
 Some movin' X 
 But they mostly movin' yola 
 With guns in the holster 
 We never leave the toaster 
 Face could wind up on a rest in peace poster. 
 Rest in peace? No sir 
 Pissin' on your graveside 
 Then get real nigga with it and go fuck your wife 
 So think twice 
 One for you and your mama life 
 Band I-T, shoot the soldiers like I shoot the dice. 
 Bun B: 
 For my nigga Bad Ass Bam, I'll open ya head 
 For Young Lo, I'll let that 44 fill ya with led 
 For Big Monster, I'll pull out the Thompson and straight squeeze it 
 Behind Sean Wee I'll cut you off at the knees 
 For the Band I T, I'll close range ya with the mac 
 And for K.S.O lot, I'll put the glock to ya back 
 Mddl Fnga, this ain't a act 
 This uncut coke 
 Don't ever play us for a joke 
 You'll get yo' bitch ass smoked 
 We go for broke. 
 (Chorus: Cobe) 
 I got this drama 
 Don't worry mama 
 'Cause I got the armor 
 On my back when I 
 Drive through the streets 
 Everybody on me 
 Tryin' to take my life 
 But I don't give a 
 What about that 
 Grip that thing 
 Cock that back 
 You don't wanna be, gone 
 Another goner, gone 
 In the game, gone 
 Another Soldier, gone 
 In a grave... [fades out]
