(Bun B) 
 Remorse 
 Vengeance 
 Lost of a loved one 
 Relative in commander to the game of life, in which one chose to adapt to as a gangsta 
 Enter my mind 
 Fill my heart 
 My emotional pain 
 Can you feel it? 
 Naw 
 Can you feel it? 
 If you haven't experienced that nature of life, it's gutta 
 (Cobe) 
 I got this drama 
 Don't worry momma 
 'Cause I got the armor 
 On my back, when I 
 Drive through the streets 
 Everybody on me 
 Tryin' to take my life 
 But I don't give a 
 What about that 
 Grip that thang 
 Cock that back 
 You don't wanna be (GONE) 
 Another goner (GONE) 
 In the game (GONE) 
 Another soldier (GONE) 
 In a grave (GONE) 
 Bendin' corners (GONE) 
 Finna bang (GONE) 
 Another soldier (LONG GONE) 
 In the grave (grave 7x) 
 (BUN B) 
 We are the mighty Middle Fingaz 
 We do not accept hate 
 Love us or die 
 (Mddl fngz) 
 Yeah fatboy slow, but a nigga ain't quick 
 Ho limped through the door, lay a nigga on his dick 
 Open up tha door, nigga standing like "shit" 
 Fifteen full bricks, same price for a hit 
 Nigga I done done it, it ain't gotta be a lick 
 And if I'm plexin wit you patna then the choppa gon piss 
 Shootin up ya corna make a sound like "Swish" 
 But I low so gat 'cause the chopper don't miss. 
 (BUN B) 
 No the choppa gon hit 
 Bound to leave ya dome split 
 Lose ya bodily functions 
 Have me think you gon shit 
 Middle fingaz, strong click 
 Bun B, the strong spit 
 Put you six feet under 
 Why not have a long sit 
 Long walk, short pier 
 Mane have a long flip 
 Got the streets on lock 
 And got the yola on whip 
 Tell momma we comin' home so don't trip 
 (Mddl fngz) 
 If I Tee, don't worry 'bout me 
 Momma I'm a G 
 I know how to handle niggas tryin' to come up on me 
 Tryin' to run up on me 
 Thinkin' you gon try me 
 Shit in a bag 
 Drinkin' through a IV 
 So appreciate ya breath 
 While you got some left 
 Ya life's a bitch 
 They got permanent PMS 
 And my only fear of death is reincarnation 
 So it ain't shit for me to make you niggas ER patients 
 Another soldier in the grave 
 (B.A.N.D.I.T) 
 Two nines, four clips 
 Prayin' that you niggas trip 
 Lookin' for some trouble 
 Finna bust you niggas bubble 
 And I don't give a fuck about your happy meal mug 
 We can go toe to toe, or trade these slugs 
 So catch a square nigga 
 And I won't budge 
 Don't plea bargain now, nigga save it for the judge 
 I might have you niggas lookin' like a strawberry fanta 
 Did so much, done burned myself, retire my bandanna 
 SOUTHWEST got them soldiers 
 Some movin doja 
 Some movin X 
 But they mostly movin yola 
 Wit guns in tha holsta 
 We never leave tha toasta 
 Face could wind up on a rest in peace poster 
 Rest in peace? No suh 
 Pissin on ya gravesite 
 Then get real nigga wit it and go fuck ya wife 
 So think twice 
 One for you and ya momma life 
 Band I-T, shoot the soldiers like I shoot tha dice 
 (BUN B) 
 For my nigga Bad Ass Bam, I'll open ya head 
 For Young Lo, I'll let that forty-fo fill ya wit lead 
 For Big Munsta, I'll pull out the Thompson and straight squeeze it 
 Behind Sean Wee I'll cut you off at the knees 
 For the Band I-T, I'll close range ya with the mac 
 And for K.S.O lot, I'll put the glock to ya back 
 Middle Finga, this ain't a act 
 This uncut coke 
 Don't ever play us for a joke 
 You'll get ya bitch-ass smoked 
 We go for broke
