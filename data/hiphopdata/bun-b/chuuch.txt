Ah yeah 
 2010 and we still rolling 
 You know Bun 
 My dad used to tell me every time he thought he knew it all 
 Something new would come up 
 So at this time let's welcome 
 Drake, the newest member to the family 
 Whom my son, JS prince discovered 
 Make no mistake the arm is behind us 
 Now Bun I've been labeled as a quiet storm 
 And it maybe true 
 But I've been watching a genius at work on this album 
 And without further ado, yo pimp give us your blessings 
 Judge 
 Yeah 
 I'm back baby and better than I ever was 
 I got the streets on fire so forget a buzz? 
 I ain't tripping on sounds scan a beat DS 
 It's easy to find with or without your GPS 
 And now we riding next 
 Biden on Obama 
 Go ask the hustlers, the gangsters, ask your mama 
 And they'll tell you the best that ever did it 
 Is still in here doing it, you can fuck with it 
 And I'ma hit it on the head with a hammer 
 Rep-ing H-town like five slam a jam 
 Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready 
 Bro well you already know 
 On your march, set, ready, go 
 I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
 I came to represent for the south 
 In the streets and in the booth 
 I came from the bottom to the top 
 And I'm out here doing my thang 
 So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing 
 Yeah 
 We back baby and better then we ever was 
 It's trill G gang so quit acting like we never was 
 You see the group is too trill and in effect 
 If Rap a lot is rolling with us 
 We in to wreak? 
 So ask him, ask ?, ask diddy 
 Go ask Yeezy, Jeezy, ask 50 
 And they'll tell you I'm through when I spit it 
 It's still in here doing it, you can't fuck with it 
 And I'ma hit it in the chest with the nina 
 Reping H-Town like James Prince Senior 
 Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready 
 Bro well you already know 
 On your march, set, ready, go 
 I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
 I came to represent for the south 
 In the streets and in the booth 
 I came from the bottom to the top 
 And I'm out here doing my thang 
 So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing 
 Yeah 
 It's back baby and better than it ever was 
 That dirty south shit 
 That you can only get from us 
 That H-town, slow down, drop the screw music 
 And it ain't going no where so get used to it 
 Go ask Trey, ask paul wall, ask roll 
 Go ask Cooper, ask Slim, they already know 
 And they'll tell you they ready to represent it 
 It's still in here doing it, you can fuck with it 
 And I'ma hit 'em low, chop 'em at the knee 
 Rep-ing PAT like a young MC 
 Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready 
 Bro well you already know 
 On your march, set, ready, go 
 I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
 I came to represent for the south 
 In the streets and in the booth 
 I came from the bottom to the top 
 And I'm out here doing my thang 
 So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing
