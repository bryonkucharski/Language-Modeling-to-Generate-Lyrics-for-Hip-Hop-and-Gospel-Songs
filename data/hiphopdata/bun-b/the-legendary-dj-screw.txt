 DJ Screw 
 (Bun B) 
 Now once upon a time not long ago 
 Where they come down candy, and live life low 
 Where the fours stay chromey, and they grippin' on wood 
 And people all behave like it's all to the good 
 Then came a young player from the Southside streets 
 Who had dreams of making music, with slowed down beats 
 He jumped on the tables made it do what it do 
 And so begins the legend of DJ Screw

 Jeah 
 Six in the morning, Feds at my door 
 Quarter mil' on the floor, the city where everything shows 
 Yeah, still bang Screw, we love it mayne 
 I know he gone, but nothing changed 
 Hawk, P.A.T., M.O.E. they all above us, mayne 
 Down here he grind and hustle, mayne 
 Can't forget Chad Butler mayne 
 Still swang on 84's, a mirror-glass like buzzers mayne 
 Grab the Louie duffle man, S.U.C. still in this thing 
 I know my dog gone, Robert Davis, we gon' do it mayne 
 (C-Note) 
 See, I love this life 
 This is Screwed Up Click 
 Don't quote me, dog 
 You'll get screwed up quick 
 Still we blew one quick 
 My 84's, they stick 
 On 24's, we sit 
 You know we holdin' it, bitch 
 I'mma do this hit for Screw 
 For Hawk, for Pat 
 Even though we pushin' powder 
 But the trunk, be crack 
 C-Note reppin' S.U.C 
 R.I.P. to Jimmy T 
 Nigga, I'mma swang in the 'Lac 
 That's how it s'posed, to be

 (Jeah) 
 One of the realest to do this shit 
 Used to Texas Screwed up, quick 
 Yeah, the tracks, Screw'll bring it back 
 No one better that you can get 
 For my nigga Robert Davis 
 Chop it up, Screw my shit 
 Now the true representation, making sure the world knew this shit 
 Every time you think of double cups, or swangers peekin' out the boards 
 Freestylin' off top of dome, or grills covered in ice and gold 
 Dealers salute the General, point-black, no subliminal 
 Tell 'em we Screwed up Texas, we go fed like a criminal 
 (Lil' O) 
 Here's a little story about a nigga like me 
 Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, nigga, S.U.C 
 South-west, H-Town, all of that's me 
 If a ho is cotton-mouth I wouldn't give a bitch P 
 I'm so Screwed up nigga say I talk slow 
 I say I listen fast when you niggas talk doe 
 And nah, I can't touch if the shit is not dro 
 If the drink is not purple, and the bitches no -whoa-

 (Z-Ro) 
 Dark blue Regal, or a Screw Blue Impala 
 Helpin' everybody, that's what he used to with this dollars 
 No collars, just t-shirts and Dickies 
 Even though he had a lot to do 
 He was never too busy to come and get me 
 I'm really Screwed Up Click, Robert Earl Davis put me in 
 Not a friend of a friend of a friend, of a friend 
 I can see him spinnin' records in Heaven in all white 
 Like he used to do on 22-34 all night 
 (Big Hawk) 
 Niggas I feel that's talkin' shit 
 Niggas I feel that's ridin' dick 
 Talkin' down on the Screwed Up Click 
 They must don't know who they fuckin' wit' 
 5-Star General of the S.U.C 
 Want my clique, gotta go through me 
 Go through Key, and Mike. D 
 Then you gotta go through Big Pokey 
 Who you know a nigga hard as me? 
 Who you nigga know is smart as me? 
 Niggas wanna know how hard is he 
 I'm hard as the Baltimore Raven's D 
 Betcha ain't see, like a [?] real 
 Hardest nigga I feel, with no deal 
 Plowin' through niggas like a snowmobile 
 And I make beats that the real can feel
