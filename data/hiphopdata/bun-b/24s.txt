(Hook- Perion) 
 You can find me on 24's 
 Blowin' on a pound of dro 
 Getting gone in the wind 
 Sitting behind tint 
 Getting bent 
 You can't see me 
 But you smell the smoke 
 Oh yeah 
 (Bun B) 
 Now what you know 'bout the H town 
 Clutch city the throwdest 
 With them big body slab swangers on the grind 
 And you know this 
 Got them buttons and bumper kits 
 Them buckles and belts 
 With pop trunk, shiny grill 
 Keeping it Trill with ourself 
 We break left and lack turn to the right 
 And bust his glock off - what 
 And if one time roll up 
 We ain't fittin turn this knock off 
 I'm a crank this surround up 
 And show him my thang 
 And if we need us another corner to slang 
 It ain't a thang 
 We got that 3rd Ward, that Yellowstone, 5th Ward and the Acres 
 Dirty dub back to the Southside we fulla bar breakers 
 So anywhere you want to take us 
 Guarantee you can show him up 
 I'm a crank him like a seal on a PT and pour him up 
 Paul Wall the OG Ron see to slow him up 
 So if y'all reppin some down ass hoods player than throw 'em up 
 Keep the Trillness in front of me and them haters behind me 
 So Magic if you're lookin' Bum be this how you gone find me... my nigga 
 How? 
 (Magic) 
 I'm on the 10 goin' West and I'm heading straight to the H 
 From Louisiana got money to make 
 They got some bitches I didn't cut 
 Some clubs I didn't crash 
 Some bars I haven't run up the tab on a nigga ass 
 Neglecting my nuts I work too much 
 Fuck gettin' tipsy tryin' to get fucked up 
 I need some rup to sip 
 So I can lean in my cut dogg 
 Eyes focused on pussy 
 Run some G on a damn broad 
 I'm with Bun and Mike Gizzle 
 Sippin' and dippin' till at least 7 in the morn 
 My 24's I call them the hoe catchers 
 Catch the type of hoes that wouldn't usually sweat ya 
 Bet cha I do it bigger than y'all 
 40 gals on call to entertain my dogs 
 Just bring me some good and a big fat goo 
 So I can puff and blow smoke on a hater like you 
 (Mike Jones) 
 Makin' money is all I know 
 24's is all I roll 
 Killa dro that's all I blow 
 In the lime light I shine and glow 
 Mr Magic and Bun be want to live lavish then come with me 
 As I flip the script in my Humvee 
 Grindin for my currency 
 281-330-8004 hit Mike Jones up on the low 
 'Cause Mike Jones about to blow 
 I'm in a Lex 
 Black on black ballin' 
 24's and up when I'm crawlin 
 Grind daily to keep from fallin' 
 Got hot now majors callin 
 I'm Mike Jones 
 Puttin' down for Swisher house 
 Princess cuts all in my mouth 
 Representin that dirty South 
 Stay on the grind from 9 to 9 
 Hope and pray one day I'll shine 
 Body Head, Swisher House and Middle Fingers we on the 
 Grind 
 I'm in a Benz on Lorenz 24's in the wind 
 My daily routine is pimpin' pens 
 I'm Mike Jones

 Mike Jones 
 Swisher House and Body Head baby

 And you're to dry on the nose

 What you need to do is help yourself up in the slab 
 Catch a corner with a Trill player like myself

 No what I'm talking about
