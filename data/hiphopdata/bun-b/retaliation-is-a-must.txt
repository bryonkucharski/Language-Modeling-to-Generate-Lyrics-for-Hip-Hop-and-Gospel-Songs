Hold up, Mddl Fngz up 
 Pussy Ass Niggas Down nigga 
 Htown Texas stand up 
 Southwest, sunnyside, PA we up in here baby 
 Holla, know'm talking bout 
 (Bun B) 
 Say, Nigga you can't run, nigga you can't hide 
 Know that we got guns, know that we gon' ride 
 Blow out your insides and leave you to rot 
 'Cause when we give it to you bitch we give you all that we've got 
 Now all it takes is one shot to put your ass in a ditch 
 But you gon' get the other 49 for bein' a bitch 
 Go to war with the big men when it makes no sense to 
 Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you 
 Ain't no movie, your baby mama, teachers and your kids 
 Everybody finna get it for the shit that you did 
 So when I get to your crib, better come out swingin' 
 Cause the devil ain't even ready for this hell I'm bringin' 
 We don't want no dope 
 We don't want no cash 
 We don't want no excuses 
 We just want your ass 
 So when that front door crash, and you see them soldiers 
 When that gun go blast, don't say Bun didn't told ya 
 If I I pull it out my pocket, be the first one to bust, 
 We ain't playin' wit you hoes 
 Retaliation is a must 
 First nigga make a move, first nigga hit the dutch 
 (Mddl Fngz) 
 Yeah, now I stand on my two feet, 
 One playa, two heats 
 20 shot, hollow heads, bitch give me the loose leaf 
 Fuck beef I got a K for niggas 
 In spots the law won't find you for days my niggas 
 Southside young playa full of plots and scams 
 Show ya how to get cha overs up and lock the grams 
 Boys know me in the hood, but not for rappin' 
 Back street trappin', front line, ya boys a captain 
 First nigga to shot, I ain't tryna talk, 
 Bring the heat to the hospital and finish you off 
 No life is a come up, when I'm rollin' with my gun up 
 Don't get ya bitch gun, but nigga what you want, what? 
 And ain't shit to get ya family touched 
 Catch auntie on the bus, and pop her ass like a clutch nigga 
 I'm in the game 'cause I love the rush, 
 Love to bust 
 This fans money never enough nigga 
 (Mddl Fngz) 
 45 in the rova, the k is on my shoulder 
 Pop your bitch ass, then I go and smoke it over 
 Niggas gettin' older, but thugs is comin' younger 
 So just in case you wonder, I keep a (?) up under 
 Cause nigga u a blunder 
 Got rock by the thunder 
 Cryin to Bun, but he the reason that we done ya 
 Gave us the word, said we keep the bird 
 Leavin' is for nerds, I put your brain on the curb, fucka 
 Pull ya piece nigga, and watch ya rest it 
 Come to this clip game, bitch I'm the best in it 
 The white flag you wavin, now it's on bitch please 
 All your love ones houses lookin' like swiss cheese 
 Tried to let your ass make it, but your ass act a fool 
 Now the HK, the AK and the AR is the tools 
 All your homeboys gone and them hoes won't help 
 So tell ya mom and your sister break out the black dress
