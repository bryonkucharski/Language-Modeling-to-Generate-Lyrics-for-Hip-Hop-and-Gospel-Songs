(Verse 1 - Bun B) 
 Well it's Bun B performin live, one night only (one night only) 
 Come on through and kick it with your trill homie 
 Showtime's midnight, we ready as we gonna be (be) 
 A packed house and you know it's all on me (me) 
 You've seen the flyers, zone in the mix, now you wanna get in the mix 
 It's cool, get in line and get ya tixs (tixs) 
 But don't forget to buy your VIP pass 
 So you can get a picture (picture), soon as you see me pass (me pass) 
 And when we pull up to the back door 
 And they know the King of the trill is in the building, it's a wrap bro 
 Go DJ, let 'em know we in the house 
 It's official, we came to turn it out, no doubt 
 (Chorus - Bun B) 
 We need lights (lights), so you can see me live on stage 
 We need cameras (huh), put me on your Facebook page 
 We need action (what?), happens when you pass me the mic 
 And I can give the people just what they like 
 Well all right 
 We need lights (lights), cameras, action, it's on 
 We need lights (lights), cameras, action, it's on 
 We need lights (lights), cameras, action, it's on (action, it's on) 
 O-o-on (on), o-o-on (on) 
 (Verse 2 - Bun B) 
 We in the dressing room posted 
 Drinks in the air get toasted, sweets in the air get roasted 
 Promoters askin for a signed poster 
 Take a picture with my wife, get a little closer (little closer) 
 Now say "cheese" (cheese), we smile, wait a second, laugh (laugh) 
 I ain't trippin' (trippin'), long as I got my second half (half) 
 And Below's noddin (noddin) and Nina's all good 
 So I pour some "II Trill", take a shot to the noggin 
 Couple Texans in the house (house), some Rockets and some 'stros too (too) 
 They representin for the city like they 'sposed too (too) 
 I hear the opening act, it's on it's last song 
 Gladiators buy 'em up, time to mash on 
 (Chorus - w/ ad libs) 
 (Verse 3 - Bun B) 
 All right y'all, it's about that time (about that time) 
 The DJ tells the crowd yo and he ain't lyin' (he ain't lyin') 
 This is the moment that we all been waitin on 
 Real recognize real, nobody got they hatin' on 
 It's showtime and the venue off the chain (chain) 
 Wall to wall people and they crunk for me mayne (crunk for me mayne) 
 We backstage gettin' ready for the crowd 
 Ask 'em who they wanna see, they say my name real loud (loud) 
 They make me feel proud after all these years 
 We can still pack the place, hearin all these cheers (cheers) 
 Say a little prayer as I drop to one knee (knee) 
 Comin' to the stage, give it up for Bun B 
 ("Give me the mic" instead of "pass me the mic") 
 (Crowd chants "Bun B!" into next song)
