Yo, Navi 
 It's my birthday 
 I should have a party, for my birthday 
 Have a house party, for my birthday 
 Dog, I'm serious 
 It's really my birthday 
 But I ain't trying to hit up the club tonight 
 And I shouldn't have to pay to get buzzed tonight 
 Plenty liq at the crib so I fittin' to get 
 On the horn and have something sick where I live 
 Move all the furniture in the back room 
 Put a sign up that says don't shit in my bathroom 
 Hide anything that looks expensive 
 Shower so the body odor isn't offensive 
 Draped in Up and Up and a blazer by Concep 
 And other fresh shit you haven't got on yet 
 Gon' get my neighbors real heated with this one 
 House party of the year, this that shit, son! 
 This is for my people that's sick of the club 
 If you miss house party's then give me some love and say... 
 Oh la oh la eh! (Ladies) 
 (Oh la oh la eh!) 
 This is for my people that's sick of the club 
 If you miss house party's then give me some love and say... 
 Oh la oh la eh! (Ladies) 
 (Oh la oh la eh!) 
 No sausage parties you know what we need bruh 
 So I call ladies 1st like Latifah 
 Speaking of which grab some old school hip-hop 
 And classic soul to guarantee your shits hot 
 Like MJ I wanna be starting something 
 Grab reggae to get the party jumping 
 Oh and I better not forget the slow jams 
 For when we get close and I don't mean hold hands 
 Oh damn! Too late to get a DJ 
 Normally I'd call DP with no delay 
 Or Kool Herc 'cause that's my people 
 He started this shit so there's no equal 
 Don't wanna bother so I do it myself 
 'Cause back in the day I use to do this myself 
 Use to hustle mixtapes 'fore the raps was fire 
 But never mind gotta cop the appetizers 
 This is for my people that's sick of the club 
 If you miss house party's then give me some love and say... 
 Oh la oh la eh! (Ladies) 
 (Oh la oh la eh!) 
 Bring only fam here with you 
 All love here leave your pistol 
 Bring chips and liquor with you 
 Just don't break my momma's crystal 
 U act like you don't party 
 Relax and move your body 
 Fam it's a celebration 
 Feels like constant elevation 
 At a house party is where you can find me 
 Everything's peace no fools that's grimy 
 No pat downs from a dude named Tiny 
 Drinks are free and the food is fine B 
 (HEY!) Watch all the people jumping 
 Like the dance floor is a trampoline or something 
 Wifey grinding on me while the beat is pumping 
 Fronting like "I'm no freak or nothing" 
 We'll see about that when these negros go home 
 Did I just hear something break love hold on 
 As much as I hate to be a party pooper 
 Break my shit are you stupid (Bounce!) 
 But that's just the price you pay 
 For letting all these party people in your house today 
 While the neighbors complain 'cause it sounds like a riot 
 And that's why their punk ass wasn't invited 
 This is for my people that's sick of the club 
 If you miss house party's then give me some love and say... 
 Oh la oh la eh! (Ladies) 
 (Oh la oh la eh!) 
 Bring only fam here with you 
 All love here leave your pistol 
 Bring chips and liquor with you 
 Just don't break my momma's crystal 
 U act like you don't party 
 Relax and move your body 
 Fam it's a celebration 
 Feels like constant elevation
