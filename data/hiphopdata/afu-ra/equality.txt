Slow down, don't rush 
 I'm here to keep the peace, but I'm prepared to say, ay 
 Slow down, don't rush 
 I'm here to keep the peace, but I'm prepared, now I say 
 (Chorus-afu-ra) 
 Yeah, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop 
 Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop 
 What, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop 
 Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop 
 (Afu-Ra) 
 Meditation, equality, it keeps me level headed, the men-tal-ity 
 Cool, calm, posignatic with suggestion 
 Never stressin', heat chambers never sweatin' 
 Honeys cryin', cause her man she caught cheatin' 
 Mothers eyein', sons cut down like bushes 
 Daddys sicker than the land lord, just evicted 
 Stressed to death, month to month until he kicked it 
 I seen ya hustlin' on the dark streets, the mental 
 Look what you been through, you just escaped reality 
 Now what ya into, is just a technicality 
 Check it, deep inside of my head like TV 
 The lifestyle I live so crooked you won't believe me 
 Lessons learned that I could walk a tight rope 
 Even though I toke and choke, don't provoke 
 Uh, now you can call me Afu-Rastahood 
 'Cause I rob from the rich and I give to the good 
 Even though its for the money b, I'm droppin' dollars g 
 Straight shots in the head, peep the summary 
 Wake up in the mornin' got me yearnin' for food 
 Yeah, yeah what, huh, I'm that type a dude 
 Pledge allegiance, pay attention, payin' homage 
 So much time held in my hand, none for college (college) 
 Hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu 
 Slow down, don't rush, 
 I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to bust 
 They wanna cut my meditation with their crooked laws 
 Say I can't hold a bong and smoke my love 
 If its war that they want we already are registered 
 The king, it is he, who defends me 
 So when its time for the showdown 
 We'll march in the soldiers Babylon, get thrown down 
 When the war is over we run up the whole town 
 And my spliff will stay lit from sun up till sun down 
 Ay, Afu 
 (Afu-Ra) 
 Stimulating, verses like blood working 
 Paper hits the pen like the needle to ya skin 
 Blow ya blood up, xena, hero-in 
 More contagious than sex (sex), nobody flex 
 Dangerous minds, little kids throw gang signs 
 Treacherous times, too many can't press rewind 
 Stress the elevation, wrap my thoughts like a mummy 
 Its funny, how sometimes some smart one 's a dummy 
 Scorin' a million, forget the S.A.T. 
 Now I leap on towers in Pisa, peep the ether 
 Wrap it in a scroll, pass it off to carmani 
 Lessons of exquisiteness versus poetry
