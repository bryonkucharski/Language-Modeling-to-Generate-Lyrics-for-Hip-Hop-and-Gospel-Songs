Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 I'm not a bad boy or a rude boy blood spiller 
 Notice how I touch the microphone like gorillas 
 Dressed in all white, sparking up my tire 
 It's Brooklyn dance y'all that have me in a trance y'all 
 I slid my way, right up in a jam 
 Skated on the dance floor like I was Peter Pan 
 Put style's together, I inspired Dapper Dan 
 Plus I'm down with the Wu-Tang Clan 
 No bodyguards, I'm just a dred rolling dolo 
 Looking for an empress and not a ho, yo 
 I made my way to the bar, the DJ shouted me out 
 To kick that Shogun slogan 
 I ordered Hennessey mixed with Captain Morgan's 
 And made my way right to the booth, to bust a flow son 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 And all my big body medium and slim body Chaka queens 
 A hip hop nigga rocking in reggae scene 
 Arms out, skin out, synchronized as he rock to the beat 
 And can you stand the heat 
 And can you wind your waist without moving your feet 
 And if you don't like sweating, you should take a seat 
 Yeah, yeah, I mixed it out with my homey, Robbie Gandis 
 Pulling a cigar from Havana, like a don dada 
 While lil' ma's eyein' me up in the corner 
 I talk to bartender and order two corona's 
 I slid on over, the way she look made me sober 
 'Cause I'm a smooth brother, yeah, I kept my composure 
 We danced all night to guess what the drama 
 It couldn't be a Brooklyn dance without no drama 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 One shot, two shot, rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat-tat 
 I grab the hand and we jetted out the spot 
 It was a beef between a Yankee boy and Jamerican 
 The whole crowd spread out in a hurry, shit 
 I held a taxi and hopped up in the backseat 
 He told the driver, 550 Jay Street 
 And by the way, I'm taking you with me 
 'Cause I, I really really like the way you MC 
 Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I didn't really know you like me 
 Now we both fixing on the party 
 Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo but you can parle with me 
 'Cause that's the way I like things to be, aiyo 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt, yeah 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt, yeah 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt 
 Nobody move and nobody get hurt
