I rise as day breaks 
 Clouds hide the sun's rays 
 Quick sand and mistakes 
 Smash walls to get through 
 I fight the good fight 
 Even on the bad days 
 It's darkest before light 
 I'm gonna push through 
 Turbo charged bars 
 Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars 
 Ain't nothing band-aids won't cover 
 Touring with 7D coverage 
 Live bands, two buses, my own cash 
 No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby 
 We went from crawling to walking to running 
 You can't say nothing, you under gag order 
 Hopping out of Audi's hurting y'all with kicks, I'm the Transporter 
 Think about it, never mind, you ain't gotta 
 I'm already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self 
 Nobody else gon' do it for ya, nobody else 
 Every now and then someone'll offer ya help, but they ain't doing nothing 
 'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain't bluffing 
 Kush puffing on you jive turkeys 
 Stuffing stockings with these gifts 
 Audible applaudables homie take a wiff 
 I rise as day breaks 
 Clouds hide the sun's rays 
 Quick sand and mistakes 
 Smash walls to get through 
 I fight the good fight 
 Even on the bad days 
 It's darkest before light 
 I'm gonna push through 
 When you a man, action is what's expected, nothing is spoken on 
 Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond 
 My flow is tom-foolery 
 I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie 
 I beautifully exude the vibe that's free of ambiguity 
 Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me 
 It's coonery, it's lunacy, let's make it plain 
 Only way that you hang is attached to a tree 
 The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently 
 She makes it rain 
 When I'm on fire, she always try to douse me 
 Only reason that you make it rain is 'cause your diamonds cloudy 
 I see you from a mile away when it get overcast 
 Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass 
 And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia 
 Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement 
 The score to your achievements, never join 'em so you gotta beat 'em 
 It's carpe diem hey (hey) yeah 
 I rise as day breaks 
 Clouds hide the sun's rays 
 Quick sand and mistakes 
 Smash walls to get through 
 I fight the good fight 
 Even on the bad days 
 It's darkest before light 
 I'm gonna push through 
 Like kindergarteners 
 My vision's bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners 
 Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya 
 The starving'll speed on ya, stampede on ya 
 Impede on your pockets then pee on ya 
 Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens 
 Spending, established, with women dining and laughing 
 But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in- 
 To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened 
 Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped 
 So many times I can build casinos from scratch 
 Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax 
 That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached 
 I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government 
 I'm higher rankings, where's the mothership? 
 I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent 
 Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been? 
 Left him face down like he was planking 
 In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive 
 You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting 
 Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging? 
 Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga 
 I'm focused 
 I rise as day breaks 
 Clouds hide the sun's rays 
 Quick sand and mistakes 
 Smash walls to get through 
 I fight the good fight 
 Even on the bad days 
 It's darkest before light 
 I'm gonna push through
