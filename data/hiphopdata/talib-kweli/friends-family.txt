You are now witnessing the demise of the music business 
 I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life 
 You know what I'm saying 
 I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with 
 You know what I'm saying 
 I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you 
 So with said shout out to Strong Arm Steady 
 Shout out to Jean Grae 
 That's my Blacksmith family you dig 
 I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you were finding me 
 Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993 
 Yeah those were the salad days my careers appetizing 
 The main course a casserole a jambalaya 
 Different influences that led me where the music is 
 A student is only as good as his teachers tutelage 
 Paying for college and not learning was straight foolishness 
 So I stopped going to school but this 
 Hard to tell my parents how to now try to get through to them 
 Thought of no one daily and traveled to different places 
 Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement 
 With Rubiks and JuJu on Flatbush my hood amazing 
 Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze 
 And that was right next door to Rawkus what's up Jarret and Brian relax y'all 
 I'm mad [?] Kendra Ross you got the soul of a Stax singer 
 I love how you always bring it back sister 
 You and Reesy making every record 
 I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected 
 Shout out to Corey Smith shout out to Dave Chapelle 
 I went on tour with The Roots they played so well 
 Writing rhymes with Mike and Nine me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing 
 Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in Common 
 Mystic Journyman introduced me to Top Ramen 
 On the bus Kanye West would never stop rhyming 
 Ain't no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing 
 That's why when the homies win I never stop smiling 
 See I'm smiling right now 
 Nothing else matters more than friends and family 
 No doubt that's how its gotta be 
 This is my odyssey its just the god in me 
 Yup they all a part of me 
 'Cause I would die for them and they would die for me 
 That's right and plus I love my fans 
 Love when you throw your hands up it's like you all my fam 
 Like you considered kin 
 Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening 
 Nothing else matters more than friends and family 
 It started with a blast now I'm a iconoclast 
 Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last 
 I do this for myself but the song for you 
 Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you 
 This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe 
 Your daddy love his girl your mother never far away 
 This is for Eque this for Kierra Paul 
 We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall 
 Headquarters and Guru is love forever y'all 
 Make it plain 'cause it's too strong for a metaphor 
 Simile your legacy will always be remembered for forever or 
 Till the end of time whichever come first 
 Big love to my mom and dad you could have done worst 
 Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first 
 Many black parents lose they son to the gun burst 
 Mommas drowning in they own tears till they lungs burst 
 Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts 
 Nothing else matters more than friends and family 
 No doubt that's how its gotta be 
 This is my odyssey its just the god in me 
 Yup they all a part of me 
 'Cause I would die for them and they would die for me 
 That's right and plus I love my fans 
 Love when you throw your hands up it's like you all my fam 
 Like you considered kin 
 Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening 
 Nothing else matters more than friends and family 
 My first record was with Mood back in '96 
 In fact it was pretty fresh Google that find that shit 
 It sound good I was showing you what timeless is 
 You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it 
 Believe me every fan is special 
 You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and "Manifesto" 
 So much wack rap I know its hard to tell 
 The difference but when I heat it up I make the garbage smell 
 I'm resurrected but I'm no savior 
 I know the game I can ball a little bit I'm an OK Player 
 Double meaning cause the flow is layered 
 We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters 
 To snap back like the jaws of gators 
 (Fades out)
