Yeah special dedication 
 I'm sending this one out to you and you and you and you 
 I said to you and you and you, 
 She cold blooded, love how we melting the ice, 
 You like the sunshine of my life, cause all see is a 
 A hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word 
 You keep my dark sky light up at night, 
 So bright that you blinding my sight 
 Cause all I see is a 
 Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word 
 Your body's like a flick, it's got surprising twists 
 I write the script, the main characters your thighs and hips 
 Award for less important role with your eyes and lips, 
 The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph 
 I watch you dance across the floor to the title track, 
 You about to get me 
 off the wall 
 like you 
 Michael Jack 
 Ill make describing your beauty my sacred duty 
 I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie 
 Hey, hey, hey special dedication

 Good love you a sexy thang, and all I'm saying

 (Talib) 
 Yo, I love ya country ass, I love ya city sass 
 I love how ya normal ways you catch it pretty fast, 
 These dudes is pretty crass, harass you in ya past 
 I love how you snap back and get the last laugh, 
 I love the way you crib smell like ______ candle incents 
 The white that you use on the phone when you handle business, 
 I love it when you freaky, 
 I love it when you a lady 
 Rockin' doing ____ in the late 80's raising babies, 
 I love her God bless you, 
 Your body something special 
 I love to play connect the dots with yo facial freckles, 
 No need for fashion police because I love your style, 
 Whatever happen Shanese baby I love your smile 
 I might be fallen in love, should I let her know 
 A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go, 
 I sing the praises every time I play this instrumental 
 Cause you instrumental to my life, to my life, to my... 
 Hey, Hey, Hey special dedication 
 I love how we melting the ice you like the sunshine of my life 
 Cause all I see is a 
 Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word

 Cause all I see is a 
 Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word 
 Let me take you by the hand you need to try your man to fight and dance and have your groupie doubt like excited fans, 
 I promise you'll be climbing walls like spider-man 
 Knees buckling you'll hit the floor when you try to stand, 
 So you drop it like its hot oh so heavy, 
 You and me we can leave now we can go steady, 
 How bout we be jetty 'cause I'm so ready 
 To bounce like a 64 chevy, word 
 Hey, Hey, Hey special dedication
