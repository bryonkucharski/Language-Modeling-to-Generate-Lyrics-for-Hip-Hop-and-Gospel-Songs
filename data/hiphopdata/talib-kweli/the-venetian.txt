(NIKO IS and Ab-Soul) 
 Ay yo, we like 39,000 feet up in the air and shit like that 
 Just ride the wave 
 Niko, what's up 
 (Niko is) 
 I do this shit 'cause I want 
 Man, don't need no reason 
 Started out at the Bodega 
 Now we at the Venetian 
 So Brazilian, but the clothes Parisian 
 I just do my thing and write like a king man I'm Stephen 
 These rappers Mr. Fantastic to me, they be reachin' 
 They poetically describing their gats 
 That they never squeezin' (pow) 
 Pardon me I'm starting to see it 
 Jobs is misleading 
 Even a snake infiltrated the garden of Eden 
 Boy stay around the time 
 It like Martin to Gina 
 They diggin' meaner than a Spartan's demeanour (Yo, keep it 3 hunnid) 
 Just spark it and park it 
 The valet be parking the beamer 
 Sharper than a? 
 That orange indica Ha 
 You get it for the low 
 Like Forrest Whittaker's eye 
 Their vision? 
 Don't make up for that counterfeit 
 Probably with that Alchemist 
 Free myself then I only see myself like Malcolm 
 (Niko is) 
 I do this shit 'cause I want not 'cause I need a reason 
 Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian 
 Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian 
 (Ab-Soul) 
 (We need to build to destroy, you know what we about) 
 I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling round like fuck it 
 Now I pull up in a luxurious something 
 With nothing less than an onion 
 See I'm the wolf the boys cry about (fibbin') 
 You lyin' in yo lines like the county building 
 Burning backwoods niggas poppin' outta woodwork 
 Punch told me how this shit would work 
 That's why I just smirk 
 Niko let these people know b (let these people know) 
 While they voted 
 We was devoted, TDE Javotii 
 Felt like an activist, bumping Hi-Tek and Kweli 
 Now the activis gone, we sippin' high tech and Kweli (Quali') 
 Junius Brutus with the flow like the Caesar 
 Just ask Seasick, but don't get sea sick 
 SOUL 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Let's go 
 Squadin' up and the crew is tough 
 Cold and frozen the chosen, like I got Jewish blood 
 Committed like institutions 
 I'm married to my music 
 Women in my life are gettin' jealous, because is my truest love 
 Get my eyes on the prize 
 Cause my lyrics are like the Pulitzer 
 Murderer of verses 
 I am Like Persus to Medusa brah 
 Better yet King Louis the Sixteenth 
 Them angels are falling like Lucifer 
 How could see coming its disgusting 
 This neck is gushing with too much blood 
 Academic fellowship even my mellow shit is super tough 
 Not the fellowship of the ring with the hobbits and talking junipers 
 I am a follower of the freestyle fellowship them niggas knew their stuff 
 I'm a student of? 
 Long pieces of Jupiter 
 Nowadays rappers are stupider 
 Swearing to god that they blew up 
 I soon I take the stage 
 Niggas take the fade like a super cut 
 Immediately stage my scenery 
 So I chew it up 
 And I spit it out like I was puking 
 That's why you threw it up 
 (Niko is) 
 I do this shit 'cause I want not 'cause I need a reason 
 Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian 
 Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian
