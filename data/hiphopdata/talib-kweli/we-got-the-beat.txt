(Talib Kweli) 
 Yeah! Come on! What it is 
 It's the P-l-a-n-e-t R-o-c-k 
 Kweli, BK, se-la-vis 
 You could tell I be hell-a-free like college radio 
 WQHT gonna play me though 
 This hot shit is to fly like the cockpit 
 Got spit like a French kiss chicks lock lips 
 Coming from the deep black like the Loch Ness 
 Now bring apocalypse like the heart of darkness 
 It's like the heart of the artist become a target 
 Pop music is the black market 
 Recently we witness bizarre shit 
 The war hit the same time as SARS hit 
 Terrorists send bombs at the concert 
 The show must go on yo regardless 
 I'm just some hip-hop kid to pop shit 
 And get on some rock shit and start a mosh pit 
 Yeah 
 We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 Yeah, Come on 
 We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 (Talib KWeli) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 We got the planet to rock, Kweli's standing on top 
 I'm like a panther when I answer to cops 
 And bust back before the man get a shot 
 And the blood on their veins run cold like the cannibal lox 
 And bring heat like the blood of the mammal that's hot 
 And keep fighting like the boy with the mechanical heart 
 And watch time count down on the hands of the clock 
 Till the hour when the pinnacle start 
 Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark 
 The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow 
 Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars 
 Think they fighting for the holiest cause 
 It don't matter if you muslim, hebrew, or you a christian 
 Information is the newest religion, is a true way of living 
 Ain't no rule to a superstition stop me with going through with my mission 
 Come on man 
 Yeah 
 We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 Yeah, Come on 
 We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 Yeah 
 We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 Yeah, Come on 
 We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Come on get down, get down, get down, get down 
 Go ladies, go, go, go ladies, go, go 
 Come on all my ghetto people stand strong 
 We rocking on and on 
 One for me, now rocking with the best and is Kweli 
 You ain't no MC like me, you just a clone like KFC 
 Come on, B-Boys, B-Girls, we rocking the world 
 Yeah 
 We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 Yeah, Come on 
 We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk 
 (Come on, Come on) 
 (Talib rhyming over hook) 
 Can't believe niggaz running the place 
 Man everything is dangerous nothing is safe, nigga 
 Think you a man with a gun in your waist 
 Let the cops disrespect you right in front of your face 
 Take it out on your girl, punch her in the face 
 You ain't a thug you a waste of space 
 Nigga get out the way, B-boys gonna rock till the break! 
 How much can the planet take 
 We got the beat...
