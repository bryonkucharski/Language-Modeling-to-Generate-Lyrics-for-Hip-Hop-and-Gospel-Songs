I can go so low 
 I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me 
 I can go so low 
 I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me 
 And I've been so low 
 I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea 
 Might have been so low 
 You might did low get low but you never been as low as me 
 I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting 
 I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person 
 I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain 
 About my commitments in life although I'm still searching 
 I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path 
 One that's seldom traveled by the masses 
 I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic 
 Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist 
 I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction 
 'Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen 
 I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours 
 Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for 
 People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me 
 I tell 'em change is god you gotta let it be 
 How does it feel to come full circle 
 Still cursing still pursing my lips to pull purple but 
 I can go so low 
 I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me 
 I can go so low 
 I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me 
 And I've been so low 
 I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea 
 Might have been so low 
 You might did low get low but you never been as low as me 
 Witness it the building of a legacy 
 So let us just pray cause the journey that's ahead of us 
 Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us 
 That's why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus 
 No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist 
 When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices 
 Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with 
 You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist 
 Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo 
 Establish your fan base local before you take it global 
 Don't be scared spend your own dough 
 You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low 
 Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us 
 We just getting started why you slowing up 
 But know enough to know by a collective we 
 Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity 
 What the fuck is a celebrity 
 I can go so low 
 I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me 
 I can go so low 
 I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me 
 And I've been so low 
 I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea 
 Might have been so low 
 You might did low get low but you never been as low as me
