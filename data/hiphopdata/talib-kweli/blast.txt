Let me, let me practice, hehehe, ehehe 
 Talib, T'Kwi, Kweli, I can't say it! 
 That's wack 
 (Talib Kweli (Vinia Mojica)) 
 Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions? 
 I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti) 
 We make the sky crack, feel the fly track, 
 Get your hands up like a hijack 
 Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like 
 Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit 
 It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writing for 
 I'm writing to show you what we fighting for 
 Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spelling in phonetically 
 If not then just let it be like Nina Simone, 
 You probably (ably) don't listen be 
 Even when we suffer loses I account the victory 
 Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say 
 It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday 
 I know my son wept cause his dad's away 
 Stop crying be strong is what I had to say 
 To my little man named Amani (mani) 
 Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots 
 Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie) 
 It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli 
 Who make you rock your body (body) 
 (Hi-Tek) 
 I remember when it all started 
 Back in the day when me and moms first parted 
 Hi-Tek from the beginning I stayed advanced 
 A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance 
 Peep game nigga, never been a lazy nigga 
 Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger 
 Stay focused while other cats stay hopeless 
 While niggas stay high I stay lower, 
 Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure, this shit ain't over 
 Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo, 
 It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flow Jo, 
 Bet you ain't even know I had flow though, 
 (Repeat: x3) 
 Keep on dancing, ya gotta keep on dancing 
 (Overlapping) oh oh oh, yeah yeah 
 Keep on dancing, ya gotta keep on dancing
