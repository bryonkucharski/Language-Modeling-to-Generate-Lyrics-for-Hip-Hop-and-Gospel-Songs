This the high life 
 Call it my life 
 (Rubix) 
 This is the byproduct of beautiful love 
 Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could 
 Get it you know we should, hold it like it's a grudge submerged 
 But I just surf 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 I'm renting the universe 
 But the stars don't fit and my bars are too mega 
 Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color 
 Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor 
 Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker 
 (Rubix) 
 Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers 
 Take you higher on the vapors 
 Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper 
 Executive executor direct when I'm on path 
 Flight without navigator, plight of a savior 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Now what would Jesus do? 
 How you believe in Him? You don't believe in you 
 The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable 
 Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable 
 These MCs is eatable, wait - edible 
 I'm fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full 
 Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you 
 Incredible, give credit where credit due 
 (Rubix) 
 Put passion into action 
 Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing 
 Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape' 
 Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate 
 You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate 
 Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage 
 Even if they don't one quote and the hate just integrates 
 (Rubix) 
 They feel us like shade, you know we're feeling great 
 Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit 
 It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate 
 Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs 
 Continue to fight on, I'm putting the gloves on 
 I love horns, I'm loving this damn track 
 I'm loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap 
 Loving it when you listen 
 "Love will fix it" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right) 
 Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts 
 The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark 
 (Rubix) 
 Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids 
 Booking like we're playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade 
 FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight 
 Sucka free I'm in my space, say I'm hella steezy, yeah (yee) 
 Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin 
 Sunny in Dolores, bike parking 
 Fly chick's sparking 
 Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping 
 There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is 
 Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business 
 Everywhere we deep in this, shawty's gon' be speaking it 
 Oh, they so uniquely spit 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader 
 The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator 
 News junky I'm debunking the myth of the job creators 
 Departed the conversation that started indoctrination 
 The flow is a thing of beauty, I'm bringing it as my nudey 
 You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi 
 Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie 
 Near they're acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie 
 Skip the drama, this an action-adventure 
 They so freaking soft it should be against the law 
 Illegal tender 
 And yo, do I really need to mention 
 This is the high life 
 High life, high life 
 High life, high life 
 'Cause we be living the high life, high life 
 High life, high life 
 Yes, I'm living in the high life, high life 
 High life, high life 
 'Cause I'm living the high life, high life
