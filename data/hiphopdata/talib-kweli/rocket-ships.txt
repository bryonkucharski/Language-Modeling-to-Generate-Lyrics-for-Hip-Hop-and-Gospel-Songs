(Talib Kweli) 
 Moving at the speed of a solution 
 Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution 
 They're saying that we need a revolution 
 But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer 
 Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene 
 Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen 
 Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens 
 My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine 
 You going green like Al Gore with 'em 
 I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em 
 God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient 
 We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations 
 My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels 
 Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant 
 It's too amazing how we be blazing, son 
 Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us 
 But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Take a tour with it, bake the raw 
 Where the beats so savage 
 That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor 
 Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off 
 Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo, I plaster the nation, causing evacuation 
 My manifestation got 'em patient from how I keeps it amazing 
 See, I'm the reason niggas need some training 
 While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion 
 I'm very engaging soon as I'm awaken 
 Quickly back you up and bag your bitch 
 She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan 
 Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting 
 That's when I embrace 'em 
 If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken 
 The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it 
 My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient 
 Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking 
 I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in 
 (Damn, can you cut his mic off?) 
 See how we got 'em buggin' 
 'Cause they can't believe what we have in the making 
 Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation 
 And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon 
 Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house? 
 Stop cooking that damn pork in this house 
 The hell going on in here? 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Take a tour with it, bake the raw 
 Where the beats so savage 
 That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor 
 Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off 
 Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me 
 Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me 
 Your weak product is nothing to me 
 I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis 
 Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee 
 Pulling strings like the Muppet movie 
 Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi 
 Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming? 
 We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name 
 Who're you kidding? The truest spitting 
 I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer 
 That we don't believe in superstition 
 These new additions need supervision 
 Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me 
 What are you stupid? Listen 
 I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent 
 I make a claim 'cause I'm too official for euphemisms 
 Staying in the cut like a new incision 
 I'll put you on your ass like True Religion 
 So give it up for the truest living 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Take a tour with it, bake the raw 
 Where the beats so savage 
 That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor 
 Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off 
 Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off
