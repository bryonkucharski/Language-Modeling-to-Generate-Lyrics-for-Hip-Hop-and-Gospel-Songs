Gravitas, light it up 
 Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea 
 You want the grown step your bars up 
 You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up 
 Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli 
 Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven 
 Descendant of Terra Firma 
 I'm from the era of legend 
 The blind to my eyesight 
 Too scared of the world ending 
 My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven 
 Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears 
 We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers 
 Unravelling minds, travelling through time like langoliers 
 Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier 
 In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair 
 Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there 
 Cops would prepare to lock us up 
 They was scared like tales from the dark side 
 Summer of the Central Park five 
 1989 was the number, the year that I started rhyming 
 From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin' 
 Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats 
 Therapy for the prison industrial complex 
 Provided the context for the crime with the tec nine 
 At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine 
 I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed 
 Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme 
 An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio 
 Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati 
 Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates 
 Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte 
 We was standing outside the tower devouring prey 
 Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with 
 Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers 
 I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath 
 Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive 
 This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise 
 I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic 
 At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big 
 At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth 
 Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source 
 Rest in peace to Allah's sons 
 Shabba was liking to call you son 
 Cause you mine I call you son cause you shine 
 What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit 
 Not for impostors, pour out a shot of vodka for them 
 Big L, Big Poppa, Big Pun, 2Pac 
 The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic 
 This shit is too classic it's blow to [?] to spinal tap 
 I started with the Rawkus Recording we work the vinyl backwards 
 From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux 
 I'm the underground king like I'm rolling with Bun and [?] 
 The flow is nuts it's solid I got the golden touch 
 Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch 
 This the highest calibre do the algebra 
 From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch 
 Black Thought to Common 
 Almost 20 years after the release of Soundbombing 
 And it still sounds timeless 
 I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest 
 And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this? 
 In Vegas with Tech 9 getting faded before the gig 
 Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince 
 True story, I always knew the importance of great shows 
 Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toad's, way cold 
 Continue to pave the road for the Kendricks and J Coles 
 Continue to stake gold 
 From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte 
 All started on park benches with Dante 
 Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant 
 The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait
