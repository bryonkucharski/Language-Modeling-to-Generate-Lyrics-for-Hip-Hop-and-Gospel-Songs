 It's not so much a business where you make a lot of money but if you enjoy the business then the money comes. But if you're looking for the fast, instant kind of famous and money it's going to be boring to you because it doesn't happen quite like that 
 (Yeah, yeah... {?}) 
 When the money come it's sweet as a honeybun 
 But when the money gone they hide like a honeycomb 
 They tell you get your education 
 Nigga, go to college 
 They colonizing your mind like Rhodesia 
 What you, a Rhodes scholar? 
 They never tell you that degree is just a receipt 
 You be paying off them loans till you're 6 feet deep 
 Peep 
 In my environment every snitch gon' have to die 
 You ask me why 
 'Cause my entitlement is American as apple pie 
 It's hard to get a check, it's easy to get in debt 
 Then get it wet 
 You could get a little head for a little bread 
 That shit is dead 
 Get by, get over 
 You gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by 12 so you can get a bed 
 The conditions you raised in is preyin on your decision-making 
 You concentrating on that short paper 
 The broad paper, that hard candy, that jaw breaker 
 The dark side of the force pay for that Lord Vader 
 How you tell a nigga from the hood? 
 We on the Dirty, Sexy Money like Blair Underwood 
 My money good (x4) 
 Can't touch it 
 It's only human to want to look 
 Money talk 
 My shit be tellin' everyone to shhh 
 My money good (x4) 
 The millionaire musician a fairly recent phenomenon 
 Before there was [?] musicians performing on the street corners 
 Out in the deep forest 
 The city drop the beat, the night air sing a sweet chorus 
 The trees lean toward us in order to take in the CO2 that we let out and convert it into oxygen 
 Every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again 
 Recycle the wind, spin it any way you want it 
 It's priceless, this life is a blessing 
 No matter how you slice it or dice it, you can grill it like a swordfish 
 A beautiful mind, the bars gorgeous 
 I know I'm a suspect 
 When I'm walking and the streets is like my office 
 We the working class artists 
 They wishin that we was porpoise 
 But I know my worth 
 Tell 'em to make an offer of gold first 
 I'm in the fight of my life and I'm taking the whole purse 
 Soul search 
 For getting paid for creating the cold verse 
 Got the money on my mind 
 Tryna escape and it don't work 
 Church 
 How you tell a nigga from the hood? 
 We on the Dirty, Sexy Money like Blair Underwood 
 My money good (x4)
