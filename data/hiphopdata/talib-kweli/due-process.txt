Yo, from Pittsburgh to Pelan this type shit we be on 
 When we on inside a cassette deck of your Neon 
 Or in your navigator whippin' with the CD on 
 Lone Catalysts, rocking to the break dawn 
 Make a sucker new jack be gone 
 He kick his shit, I be like 
 Yo, you puttin' me on? 
 You wanna battle? Out to Rawls pick me a beat to freak on 
 Something with a lotta bass and some highs to tweet on 
 The drums, I give it a run, you know, turn the heat on 
 Up in the kitchen, then you'll delish on 
 Who put me in a top position, J. Sands dishing 
 No look like Ron Strickland 
 Make the average MC contemplate, just sitting 
 Down, the wax spin like merry go round 
 While I format the verbs and nouns through underground 
 Now what you're looking for you have found 
 So now bump to the sound properly laid and mixed down 
 By no other than my brother, although from different mother 
 J. Rawls with Sands on the mic, so take cover 
 The sound makes you bounce like flubber, Ludacris, Danny Glover 
 Lethal Weapon, so while you're checking 
 Due process, paying these dues, battling crews 
 At the same time, livin' in life, givin' enlightenment 
 Seeing eye for the blind 
 Through the darkness of the industry we ministry 
 I go on like etcetera 
 And blast my way out the plethora of replicas 
 Cats steady acting extra 
 And they parts is non speaking 
 My skills go without and beyond speaking 
 Address your congregation like a deacon 
 Seeking converts, my convo is a honor and a pleasure 
 You seein me is like Geraldo seein Al Capone's treasure 
 You the don of mediocrity, I'm the indispensable hero of hypocrisy 
 Stopping your flow like bureaucracy 
 Due process, you got blessed by the best of the population 
 Word to Black Shawn, I see your whole operation 
 And shut it down, cut it down like rain forest 
 You see Talib Kweli when you look up the idlest in the thesaurus 
 I'm the definition of special edition with rack and pinion steering 
 To make my handling more smooth than aloe and lanolin 
 Manifesto spitting, my stiletto's hitting 
 On a ghetto mission to keep it fabulous 
 Like a Lone Catalysts composition 
 Due process, paying these dues, battling crews 
 At the same time, livin' in life, givin' enlightenment 
 Seeing eye for the blind 
 Through the darkness of the industry we ministry 
 On a level of metaphors with lies life seems to depreciate 
 Like automobiles submit its original state 
 I'm into brothers with registered plates 
 Pushing the weight of my spirit 
 Passing the limit of speed, rhymes per minute 
 Cerebral engine is infinite 
 Class, the third eye high beams illuminates the distance 
 The pressure on pedals accelerates, racing the currents of winds 
 Making the intangible bend with aerodynamics and panoramic visioning 
 I see the world we livin' in, five gallons of knowledge 
 A tank full filled with lessons 
 My temperature gauge measures all of the blessings 
 For the miles I'm stretching 
 Passing what is hot and what you got for all you cats on the list 
 Cause us to be the Catalysts 
 Of a new era, correcting errors 
 Learn to love it or leave it alone 
 Reciting these Nubian poems 
 From NYC to ATL we got continuous flows 
 Due process, paying these dues, battling crews 
 At the same time, livin' in life, givin' enlightenment 
 Seeing eye for the blind 
 Through the darkness of the industry we ministry
