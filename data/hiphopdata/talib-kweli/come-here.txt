I don't wanna waste your time baby 
 I just wanna make you come to me 
 Comfortable baby, so come here darling 
 And come for me baby 
 I don't wanna waste a second, no girl 
 I just wanna make you come dance with me 
 Come talk to me, come here darling 
 Come here for me baby 
 Why you so far away? You need to feel this 
 I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick 
 I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts 
 I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first 
 I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues 
 You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible 
 You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you 
 Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable 
 Your whole style is colder than Minnesota 
 I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders 
 At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over 
 We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer 
 We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump 
 Black magical, act radical with the fist up 
 Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop 
 Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked 
 I don't wanna waste your time baby 
 I just wanna make you come to me 
 Comfortable baby, so come here darling 
 And come for me baby 
 I don't wanna waste a second, no girl 
 I just wanna make you come dance with me 
 Come talk to me, come here darling 
 Come here for me baby 
 Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor 
 Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure 
 I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure 
 Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure" 
 She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby 
 As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali 
 She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown 
 Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around 
 This last bird probably flew the coop 
 Blastin' Outkast, last words: "Ooh-Dee-Whoo" 
 I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful 
 Je ne sais quoi how you say, "voulez vous?" 
 Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither 
 'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her 
 I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor 
 But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider 
 I don't wanna waste your time baby 
 I just wanna make you come to me 
 Comfortable baby, so come here darling 
 And come for me baby 
 I don't wanna waste a second, no girl 
 I just wanna make you come dance with me 
 Come talk to me, come here darling 
 Come here for me baby 
 Hey you, hey you, hey you 
 Yeah, I'm talkin' to you 
 Hey you, hey you, hey you 
 Yeah, I'm talkin' to you 
 Simmer down for me 
 Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me 
 Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me 
 Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me 
 Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer 
 While I mange, just serving long sentences, no commas 
 Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna 
 The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter 
 You the Earth, that's emphatically "yes" 
 But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect 
 Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh 
 I ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes" 
 I don't wanna waste your time baby 
 I just wanna make you come to me 
 Comfortable baby, so come here darling 
 And come for me baby 
 I don't wanna waste a second, no girl 
 I just wanna make you come dance with me 
 Come talk to me, come here darling 
 Come here for me baby
