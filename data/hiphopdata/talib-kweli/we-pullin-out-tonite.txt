 Y'all dudes be watchin TV, see the MC, get the CD 
 Believin every word he's heard spit, you best believe me 
 So when I get to spittin', this should be so excitin 
 You see your favorite rapper and you can't believe you like him 
 Saw a tear comin' from your eye now 
 Can't really pretend you fly now 
 So you still frontin but why now 
 Feel like you can't touch the sky now 
 What the people really feelin', let's find out 
 If you rockin' with a nigga, let's ride out 
 We got no time to lie down 
 Young girls in the fuckin' cryin out 
 It's the way that I walk and I talk like 
 I'm a real Brooklyn-New York type 
 You know the type to push niggaz off bikes 
 One summer only rock Air-Force Nikes 
 Gonna put it down answer the door right 
 Go hard to the paper with all night 
 Spit that murder rap, murder rap rap 
 Sounds like rapapa

 These niggaz screamin how they take your life ??? dreamin' 
 They leave the proof so they can keep their man a cure appointment 
 Say they be on the block and they got ammunity 
 They can't even scare white people and they pay their community 
 And I know you got a wife and you not playing with your kids 
 That's why I don't believe in half the shit you say you did 
 Treat you like Craig, you ain't gotta lie 
 Like B.I. somebody gotta die 
 I keep these niggaz on their toes, fuck it, somebody gotta try 
 I make the mystery DIE, I'm like Magnum P.I 
 Its just a fax when I RAP, I got 'em trapped like T.I 
 Niggaz get 24's and shit they ain't got money for 
 And put on some funny clothes to holla at some funny hoes 
 And what you think that make you a man huh 
 That don't make you nothin' but a bumma 
 Drop, pause and they ain't no cameras 
 Gangstas gotta cry your manner 
 You rockin' a shook demeanor, probably scared to throw some joints 
 Ain't gonna bust a nina, nothin' sweeter, what's the point? 
 Set it off, set it off, get it off now 
 Get out or you headed North now 
 Ain't comin' at you like its soft now 
 We pullin out tonight
