(Talib Kweli) 
 Whoa! yeah 
 On top of the world 
 Yeah, that's how my seeds got me feeling' right now 
 On top of the world 
 Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything (Yeah) 
 On top of the world 
 Amani Fela, Diane Ashe, I'ma hold y'all down for real (Gotcha!) 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 It was 1996, 4th of July, looking off in the sky 
 Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye 
 It was a silhoutte of a beautiful woman, bright with life 
 Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight 
 We at the African street festival, and she walking around 
 Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down 
 I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds, seem brighter around me 
 And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word 
 We got home at three in the morning, I was beat 
 Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep 
 3:05, like every five minutes, then the water broke 
 We on the go, yelling at the cabbie, 'cause he's sort of slow 
 You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions 
 Hear come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do c-sections 
 But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long 
 Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy! 
 (Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli) 
 Huh, yeah 
 I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel 
 (That's the sound of joy) 
 See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel 
 (That's the sound of joy) 
 So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real 
 (That's the sound of joy, y'all) 
 Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel 
 My baby girl 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind 
 Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes 
 Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least 
 That's what the midwife said, on the phone 
 Anyway, the music got me going away 
 Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience 
 And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation 
 So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house 
 I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again) 
 So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore 
 Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!) 
 I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go 
 Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital 
 I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt) 
 Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh) 
 Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm 
 But I cried tears of joy, when they put my daughter in my arms, how precious! 
 (Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli) 
 Huh, huh 
 Said I know how you feel, uh, said I know how you feel when you 
 (My precious joy) 
 Said I know how you feel, uh, Kwe I know how you feel 
 (I know you do, huh, my precious joy y'all) 
 Huh, uh, said I know how you feel (yeah), said I know how you feel 
 (My precious joy) 
 Huh, man I know how you feel (yeah), said I know how you feel 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 I do it for the seeds y'all, in they formative years when they need y'all 
 We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all 
 I give them the truth, so they approach the situation, with ammunition 
 I keep nothing away, they hear everything, 'cause they know how to listen 
 Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow 
 And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition 
 They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start 
 That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart, it's breaking our nation apart 
 We gave the youth all the anger, it's just 
 We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous 
 You can't talk to them 
 Unless your language is relating to what they going through 
 So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you 
 And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's 
 When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo 
 I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl, everyday they bring joy to my world 
 (Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli) 
 Huh, yeah 
 I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel 
 (That's the sound of joy) 
 Brother Kwe', I know how you feel, Brother Kwe', I know how you feel 
 (Baby girl, my precious joy) 
 Kweli, I know how you feel, say bro' I know how you feel 
 (Fela, be my joy, yo) 
 Huh, if you know how the people feel, let me really know how you... yo 
 I do it for the seeds y'all 
 I do it for the seeds y'all 
 I do it for the seeds y'all 
 I do it for the seeds y'all 
 I do it for the seeds y'all
