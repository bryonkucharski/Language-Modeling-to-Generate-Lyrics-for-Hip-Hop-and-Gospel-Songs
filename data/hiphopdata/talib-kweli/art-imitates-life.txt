Let's toast to paid mortgages, lasting marriages 
 Tina Farris's pay King to Paris 
 Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses 
 The family crest, the legacy, the heritage 
 I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is 
 And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists 
 Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents 
 Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch 
 Yeah, it's me and [???], and his [???] 
 North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam 
 If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong 
 We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe' 
 Life got me in a state on the interstate 
 And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate 
 Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate 
 Prolly 'cause I live the kind of life art imitate 
 That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands 
 We living next door to the Aquilius again 
 Pardon me fam 
 But I'mma show you how it is 
 I'mma show you how we get in 
 Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous 
 Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip 
 The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips 
 Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse 
 I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio 
 This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio 
 That's what a few believe like a doobie roll 
 We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio 
 You talking shit? we don't need the chatter 
 Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter 
 So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth 
 That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out 
 Better let it off cause you set it off 
 The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th 
 Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white 
 Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life 
 It imitate my life 
 That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands 
 We living next door to the Aquilius again 
 Pardon me fam 
 But I'mma show you how it is 
 I'mma show you how we get in 
 Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360 
 Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me 
 Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath 
 Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left 
 Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around 
 Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down 
 'Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this 
 All while I be living it, and set the precedence 
 And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat 
 Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back 
 Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff 
 Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass 
 I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle 
 Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo 
 Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do 
 That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands 
 We living next door to the Aquilius again 
 Pardon me fam 
 But I'mma show you how it is 
 I'mma show you how we get in
