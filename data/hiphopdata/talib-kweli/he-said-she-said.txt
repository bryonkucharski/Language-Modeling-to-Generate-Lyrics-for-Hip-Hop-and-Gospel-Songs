All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 A cautionary tale 
 I heard about this new artist 
 Somebody said he was the hardest 
 Seem like I gotta do the knowledge 
 'Cause I don't go by those comments 
 Loving the promise of some new hot shit 
 And apparently this kid got it 
 He adored by all of them bloggers 
 They describe him down to his boxers 
 I heard last night he had problems 
 With some other random ass nigga 
 Tonight the blog is on fire 
 Them niggas beefing on twitter 
 His timeline full of depression 
 But his death the life of the party 
 They celebrating his self destruction 
 It make for excellent copy 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 The life a series of moments 
 And VIP he be posting 
 Dudes be drinking that potion 
 Girls all in they emotion 
 Thorough breads in the stable, what 
 Pills on his table, what 
 I heard he staying independent 
 He don't fuck with major labels 
 The rumors keep on swirling 
 Every interview is a circus 
 Yeah he grinding, he working 
 But his lack of god is disturbing 
 Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame 
 He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame 
 Plus think he going out with what's her name 
 With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 Heard your baby mama got crazy drama 
 Get way too violent and drunk 
 Couldn't make an honest woman out of her 
 Now he face your honor every month 
 Now she slandering niggas on instagram 
 So her followers up and her kids be down 
 She be giving out advice how to get a man 
 On the sex tape part of a business plan 
 Now she coming out next to plug 
 A new song she gets on the breakfast club 
 Where party promoters give extra love 
 All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us 
 I heard a bunch of these rumors 
 I heard it made this nigga lose it 
 Only thing I have yet to hear 
 Is any of dude music 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care 
 All the he said she said 
 Don't even care
