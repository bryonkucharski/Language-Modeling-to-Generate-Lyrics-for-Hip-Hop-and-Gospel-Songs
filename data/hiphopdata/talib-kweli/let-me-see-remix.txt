(Talib Kweli) 
 Ay yo the prophet is without honor 
 In your own country, 
 People swear that you ain't shit because they know your mama 
 So much drama at the crib it ain't fit to live 
 And that survival of the fittest shit will split your wig 
 Cats master doin' bits of illegitimate kids is splitin' dutches 
 Dealin' with the physical and caught up in his clutches 
 My way of life bum-rushes pullin' no punches 
 Silence is golden and all I'm hearin' is hushes, when I'm shinin' 
 MC's pay attention 
 I rise like a ascention see more than three dimension 
 To the situation we facin receivin energy 
 So you see who your friend and who your enemy 
 (Morcheeba) 
 Crashin back down to earth I've found 
 We can love 
 Oh let me see 
 All of the places I can be 
 Oh let me know 
 All of the places where we can go 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Yo we rock on shed like light the break of dawn 
 Stand strong like the words in God's song 
 B-Boys, make some noise and B-Girls, rock the world and 
 (Morcheeba) 
 Falling apart right from the start 
 Crawling round 
 Oh let me see all of the place that I can be 
 Oh let me know all of the places where we can go 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 A blind man feels the wickedest taste is exquisite 
 He can hear me lound and clear and smell fear in the air 
 Without sight he gains in-sight and lets me see his true self 
 Not what he wants me to precive him to be 
 Preception is deception 
 Without the facts you keep guessin 
 That's the image in the mirror so we Eternal Reflection 
 Forever manifestin' the cleverness in the lesson 
 Dropin' with authority with no doubt, no question 
 Yo my man's blazin' more cheeba 
 Blowin' out like speakers 
 Keepin' y'all open wide like receivers 
 We rock on shed like light the break of dawn... 
 And we stand strong like the words in God's song c'mon 
 (Morcheeba) 
 Show us how to stand up strong 
 Waitin' for you takes so long 
 Shadows leave us standing naked 
 We can't fake it 
 Oh let me see all of the places that I can be 
 Oh let me know all of the places where we can go 
 Oh let me see all of the places that I can be 
 Oh let me know all of the places where we can go 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 B-Boys, make some noise and B-Girls, rock the world and 
 B-Girls, rock the world and c'mon and 
 Pick it up yes 
 And we put it down, yes we put it down 
 Another Hi-Tek production 
 Talib Kweli, MCs ain't got nothin' 
 Blaze up... more cheeba, more cheeba 
 Cheeba, everybody say cheeba, everybody cheeba
