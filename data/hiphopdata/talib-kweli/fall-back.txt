These silicone rappers acting real but 
 Light them up like blunts gotta spill guts 
 Never mind they still acting tough 
 My T-shirt breathe corporate corporate magazine steal some 
 Fuck ever heavy metal shit real pop 
 You been pop because you daybueing real flop 
 Cops trying to kill guys but killed shot 
 Exploring every options while the water still trying to feed cops yeah 
 Everything a vibe but it's still the same 
 Only the real remain when I kill the game 
 Running over the niggers in a renter hearse 
 Then I erks tire marks tire marks 
 Wait that's a Kendrick verse 
 None I ain't have to steal that 
 What's left when all of your layers are peeled back 
 Got a mind like a steel trap 
 And then fill it to the brim with real raps 
 Yep you wanna fall back (fall back) 
 You wanna fall back (fall back) [x2] 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel 
 Up the money tell them to fall back 
 Fuck the money we coming to north black 
 The cops trying to kill us we can't ignore that 
 Some rally some riot 
 Government selling up bull shit and we buying 
 Giving us all sort of drugs and we try it 
 I've never been to a court with a judge that ain't bias 
 Look at the conviction rate I got the colour that the system hate 
 Wait face facts as they face us the racist trying to erase us 
 Beat us to the truth then erase us 
 History is a high story Knee high 
 Don't watch exodus no one is our story 
 Rearrange the past no one is our glory 
 Not even the colours of my brothers will ride for me 
 Yep you wanna fall back (fall back) 
 You wanna fall back (fall back) [x2] 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel 
 Hip hop is still evolving from stealing vaults 
 Some of these real life shit don't appear in blogs 
 Rap niggers soft this ain't a pillow talk 
 At the club ain't saying nothing when they kill us all 
 Ah silence but you say you real ya that's how you feel huh 
 Ey yo fro real bro riders better watch who you steal from 
 A true steal gun tighter than the steel drum 
 We on that crazy steel drum 
 Smoking that B real what the fuck you feel one 
 Wow you niggers acting real young 
 Stop that recording that baby beef shit feel tongue 
 Yeah no time for your hard feelings 
 Blood is in the ghetto my socks is like curry shillings 
 Un apologetic as fuck when they say my name 
 Open methic in the truck men I bring my pain 
 Yep you wanna fall back (fall back) 
 You wanna fall back (fall back) [x2] 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel 
 If you the real shit you really real shit 
 Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real 
 If it's really real drop it let me feel some 
 If it's real drop it let me feel
