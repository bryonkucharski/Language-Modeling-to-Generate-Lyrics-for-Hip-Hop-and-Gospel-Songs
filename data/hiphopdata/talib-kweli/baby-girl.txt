Baby girl, hey ya 
 (Talib Kweli and Kendra Ross) 
 What kind of language do you know? 
 English and some French 
 (...) 
 Baby girl, hey ya 
 I know a little French, though... 
 (French) 
 Loving 
 (...) 
 The sound of you comin' 
 Is nothing 
 (...) 
 Loving, loving, loving... 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Ever you made love out in the rain 
 But your body so hot 
 That the water does not ??? in the flame 
 So arise to the brain??? 
 ??? Profanities coming out of you 
 And you shouting out my name 
 I'm the truth like I'm coming out ??? 
 We are on the top of the world 
 And to reach this level had to climb a mountain of pain 
 But we are here now 
 Noting to fear now 
 Everything clear now 
 I ain't to tear down walls to your heart now 
 Every single stare down 
 Calling for sex 
 So emotional tear gonna fall 
 I applaud your agility 
 Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation 
 Old faces, Got you feeling all flush 
 'Cause we are touching in public places 
 In the studio ??? 
 Making amateurs movies in a condo 
 You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe 
 When I'm wilding out with my tongue like Jon Snow 
 Every sword need a chief 
 Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast 
 You are the lioness 
 And you roar so loud 
 Niggas call the police 
 Doesn't matter 
 Where we get down 
 Ever come over us 
 Doesn't matter 
 Where we get down 
 Ever come over us 
 Baby girl, hey ya 
 You are my one and only 
 My one and only 
 You are my one and only 
 Baby girl, hey ya 
 You are my one and only 
 You are my one and only 
 How come you lonely? 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 ??? ambition girl 
 You are going places 
 I make the temperature rise 
 Call it homeostasis 
 We are up and down 
 We on and on 
 I'm sorry ain't being around 
 Let me show remorse 
 Now you show in off 
 Now you show in out 
 Know what? We are staying in 
 Fuck going out 
 We smoking out 
 We smoking now 
 We smoking now 
 What you know about it? 
 What you know about it? 
 Doesn't matter 
 Where we get down 
 Ever come over us 
 Doesn't matter 
 Where we get down 
 Ever come over us 
 Baby girl, hey ya 
 You are my one and only 
 My one and only 
 You are my one and only 
 Baby girl, hey ya 
 You are my one and only 
 You are my one and only 
 How come you lonely?
