Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
 Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music 
 I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams 
 Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes 
 I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones 
 Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone 
 My daughter's growing up, my son on his way 
 They closing in on me, I feel like every day 
 Music saves me, soothing like the navy 
 But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars 
 So I took the vibe with me using my life 
 Yep, I propose the main music my wife 
 If ever need to call a nigga music's my night 
 And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice 
 If I degraded and I haven't even cried to 
 I watch purpose prophesize about going through 
 Music ain't the knowledge itself 
 And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth 
 Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
 Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music 
 Music a part of me, I'm a bully 
 Beating up the track with brutal lines 
 The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me 
 I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me 
 I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry 
 A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy 
 Now all the people who go irresponsibly 
 Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy 
 So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use 
 Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you 
 My music gives you a message true or respect is due 
 But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual 
 A tree in form of a far is never heard 
 Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds 
 You download it for free but what I create the same 
 Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me 
 Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
 Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
 The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music 
 I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson 
 When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet 
 It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it 
 Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin' 
 Willing to the same songs but we hear them different 
 Serenade the death like we got a fear of living 
 Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising 
 Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism 
 The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories 
 Attract the police forces 
 Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us 
 And he could run before he walked
