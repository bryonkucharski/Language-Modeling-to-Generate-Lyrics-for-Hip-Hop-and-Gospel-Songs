Been around the world many times 
 Seen many things 
 And they in color too 
 Seen women so beautiful 
 That I could die with a smile on my face 
 And not feel like the good lord gypped me 
 (The space between love and me 
 Between...) 
 How you expect to have an ordinary relationship 
 With such an extraordinary nigga 
 Yeah there's flaws in what you figured 
 Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter 
 Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her 
 I like my fantasies, half stripper half glass slipper 
 Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma 
 Character in my flip book 
 Coming to life when I'm flipping through the pictures 
 Switching up the positions 
 My karma karma chameleon 
 Change colors with the surroundings 
 I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound 
 And I'm smothering and I'm grindin' 
 Now doubt is counting me out 
 Loving in public when we coming and 
 Up against the cupboard till we... 
 (Look like turquoise) 
 Right on the couch 
 (Yellow on the bad day) 
 Knocking it out without a doubt 
 (Colors of you) 
 'Eyo the world is my coloring book 
 Look, new discoveries every time 
 When I color outside the lines 
 (Colors of you) 
 'Eyo the world is my coloring book 
 Look, new discoveries every time 
 When I color outside the lines 
 (Color of you) 
 My self expression 
 Acquire every color in the spectrum 
 My self reflection make the light change direction 
 When you see it from this angle the colour, the cut the clarity 
 Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity 
 Having me in my blue phase 
 Go off the grid for a few days 
 Go on a journey without a suitcase 
 The security of obscurity in a world of respect 
 And I'm trading it like a currency 
 Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone 
 He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong 
 But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam 
 Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome 
 My light'll poke through the clouds 
 We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud 
 While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound 
 You can see it with your ears 
 You can hear it with your eyes 
 You can feel it right here yeah 
 (Colors of you) 
 You don't look like turquoise 
 You don't look like gold 
 You don't look like purple 
 That'll match your hue 
 'Eyo the world is my coloring book 
 Look, new discoveries every time 
 When I color outside the lines 
 (Colors of you) 
 'Eyo the world is my coloring book 
 Look, new discoveries every time
