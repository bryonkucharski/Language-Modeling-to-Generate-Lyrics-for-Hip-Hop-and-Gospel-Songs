 I used to put the money first, y'all still do 
 But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from 
 The waiters and you're hardly served 
 You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse 
 That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse 
 Mutual respect over below payments 
 Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery 
 I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it 
 I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement 
 And I'm the most relevant 
 You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment 
 We're not on the same level man 
 Your dream girl sent me nudes and I'm checkin' 'em 
 Underneath the table as I'm havin' dinner with the president 
 Man fuck the money 
 O tsenya tlhogo then otla ka plane 
 Eh sane, being broke's for makgokgorane 
 They love 'cause they know I'm bein' real to my peeps 
 There's niggas richer than me who still wish they were me

 (Talib Kweli) 
 Money make niggas break promises 
 Money turn niggas into pharmacists 
 Money make you drop outta colleges 
 But the bars that I spit through God exist 
 Who we be, that's who we are 
 Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton 
 My taste expensive as a superstar 
 So I take what I want like a coup d'état 
 From profit sharing to profiteering 
 Now they stop and stare 'cause we cop McLarens 
 But we not preparing for God's appearance 
 Too busy dominating and domineering 
 Our competition securin' our position 
 Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition 
 Rap niggas lie like politicians 
 So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision 
 Capitalism is a cataclysm 
 If white collar crime is a bad decision 
 Then the makers who routinely crash the system 
 Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison 
 Need money to eat, need money to live 
 Need money to keep, need money to give 
 But when pursuit of the money is your only goal 
 Then you lose control, then you lose your soul 
 Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence 
 So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check 
 According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream 
 "We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme" 
 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money 
 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money 
 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money 
 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money 
 Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
