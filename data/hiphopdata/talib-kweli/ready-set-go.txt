I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames 
 Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change 
 Control your mission, keep up with my pole position 
 Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing 
 Racing to your death or the holiest celebration 
 God bless our lady of holy accelerate 
 'Cause we speeding while we drive on this highway of information 
 The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation 
 They keep us at sea level so I'm staying on my A game 
 They local like the C when I express like the A train 
 My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain 
 We be alike and see alike, 'cause we got the same brain 
 We in the same chains, work in the same fields 
 Now we're independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal 
 Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators 
 So fast, it's like they going backwards 
 Life's so short, we can't afford to lose 
 When the guns go off and the flag drops 
 I'll never stop 
 I'mma race to the finish line of the road 
 To kick in the door 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase 
 Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer 
 Pulling capers with my team best believe I'll be seeing paper 
 With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major 
 On the highway of life I'm faster than cop cars 
 Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars 
 Never rattled 'cause we been through the battles, we got scars 
 This the international half of the Black Star 
 This is the sound that you're missing I'm here when your ears listen 
 Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting 
 Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick. 
 Boys take over when the shit drop 
 Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock 
 Men wanna talk to the women, we ain't screaming 
 Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin' 
 Life's so short, we can't afford to lose 
 When the guns go off and the flag drops 
 I'll never stop 
 I'mma race to the finish line of the road 
 To kick in the door 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 When it's gone to the wire 
 I gotta win to the fire 
 You can't stop it. No, you can't stop it 
 Because I'm destined to win 
 Like a full champion 
 And we know it's happening 
 At the time, get ready, set, go 
 On your mark, get set, when I start the jet 
 Look how far I get, I'm not only an artist they say 
 One is the loneliest number but still regardless 
 The second best don't exist, it's a little oxymoronic 
 What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high 
 Watermarks, cause the market's flooded with garbage 
 You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic 
 Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic 
 Prisoner of conscious, nonsense 
 I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake 
 It's so ironic, it's beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral 
 We don't get it away 
 Rappers nowadays are confusing you 
 I know you're tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake 
 That's why I'm leaping the faith, keeping the pace 
 Although it's all about the winning, it's never about the wait 
 Life's so short, we can't afford to lose 
 When the guns go off and the flag drops 
 I'll never stop 
 I'mma race to the finish line of the road 
 To kick in the door 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go 
 Ready, set, go
