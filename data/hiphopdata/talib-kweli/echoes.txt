(Talib Kweli) 
 Like that right there 
 It feels so African 
 Got a little somethin' on my chest 
 Gotta get it off, gotta get it off 
 (Miguel and Patrick Stump) 
 You say the meanest fuckin' things to me 
 And I pretend that I don't care 
 But when it's said and done and the war is won 
 Your words are all I hear 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Say what you mean, mean what you say 
 You the meanest girl, you my Tina Fey 
 Like you out for pain, like you out for shame 
 But you pout when I call you out your name 
 Your words burnin' me, you're my bird of prey 
 When you feed your young, you regurgitate 
 What I heard you say and reverberate 
 But I'm a man, gotta show my vertebrae 
 I'm the kind to wait, you can come through with 
 You can run to it and get numb to it 
 Treat you like the Autobahn, just sung to it 
 Treat you like my favorite song and just jump to it 
 Girl you waste my bluff when we makin' love 
 Can't take it, love, you my favorite drug 
 You my fleur-de-lys, you disturb the peace 
 Cause you hurtin' me, you turned to me and said 
 Love is a potion that's fluent, let's keep it movin' 
 The only thing that's magic is moments, I'm only human 
 The only thing that's tragic is futures that we can ruin 
 I pound for couple of hours, double influence 
 Need a break from the words you're usin' 
 My love broke my Kevin Hart 
 Let me explain 'cause I see what you're doin' 
 Mama said, "You don't need to stay" 
 Papa said, "Boy you need to pray", goddamn 
 (Miguel and Patrick Stump) 
 You say the meanest fuckin' things to me 
 And I pretend that I don't care 
 But when it's said and done and the war is won 
 Your words are all I hear 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 We can't internalize the things people say to us 
 But it make you sus, I need a break from us 
 I used to think your attitude was a major plus 
 Now the way you talk to me is like we breakin' up 
 Tryna get into my zone without you makin' a fuss 
 Like sticks and stones, your words breakin' stuff 
 They hittin' home, but I can take a punch 
 I'm your David Lynch, you're my naked lunch 
 I found space for us, found a place for us 
 Used to pray for love, used to pray for us 
 Would've gave you my blood but you gave it up 
 My heart a house for this love but you sprayed it up 
 You can't take a brush, comments is tangled up 
 In a web of emotion that's dangerous 
 I can't make this up, that shit is lame as fuck 
 I ain't a slave but I'm out here tryna make a buck 
 Stayin' on my hustle, I ride around and I spend it 
 Set it into motion like butterflies to defect it 
 Tryin' to pretend that the words are never effective 
 Seem to work for a second but never be worth the effort 
 I'm a man and they say I ain't s'posed to run on emotions 
 So I let you get away with more than you were supposed to 
 I kept it bottled up like a note to float in the ocean 
 Just stop myself, I'm explodin' 
 (Miguel and Patrick Stump) 
 You say the meanest fuckin' things to me 
 And I pretend that I don't care 
 But when it's said and done and the war is won 
 Your words are all I hear 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo 
 And they echo
