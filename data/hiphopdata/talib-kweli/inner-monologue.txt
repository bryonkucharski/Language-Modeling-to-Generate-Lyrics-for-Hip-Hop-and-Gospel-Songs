Remember, whatever discipline you're in 
 Whether you're a musician or a photographer 
 A fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer 
 A singer, a designer - whatever you do 
 You have one thing that's unique 
 You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard 
 Things go wrong - in life and in love 
 And in business and in friendship and in health 
 And when things get tough, this is what you should do 
 Make good art 
 This about to be the realest shit you ever heard 
 I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word 
 These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word 
 Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird 
 Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas 
 Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor 
 My flow is sicker 'cause I flow with vigor 
 I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda 
 Control my center 'cause I gravitate with Gravitas 
 This my inner monologue 
 Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov 
 My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd 
 Actually battery in my back like a copper top 
 Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock 
 Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop 
 Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch 
 They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n' tot 
 Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot 
 Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs 
 Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia 
 I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia 
 Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates 
 Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet 
 I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history 
 I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories 
 It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet 
 They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed 
 Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater 
 My crew stay winning, we stay innovating 
 Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes 
 They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco 
 Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue 
 Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews 
 Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule 
 That's why I had to get at you 
 Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga 
 (Baby, just shine your light 
 If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter 
 Just stay bright, so shine your light) 
 We're in a transitional world right now because 
 The nature of distribution is changing 
 The distribution channels that people have built 
 Over the last century or so are in flux 
 The print, the visual artist, the musicians 
 Which on the one hand intimidating and on the other 
 Immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions 
 The now-we're-supposed-tos of how you get your 
 Work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down 
 The gatekeepers are leaving their gates 
 You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen 
 The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are 
 So make up your own rules
