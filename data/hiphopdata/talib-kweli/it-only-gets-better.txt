Lord knows I had it hard today 
 Had it hard today 
 Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way 
 Cause it only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 Every day I gotta wake up early 
 Let it break, thank the Lord at the take 
 Get the troops, hit the booth, spiritual, it's been great 
 Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful 
 Working on that attitude, just because 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 Every day I gotta 
 Trust the God and hustle hard 
 My grind is real, my hustle dope 
 I'm finding meals, I'm signing deals 
 I'm the Gladiator like Russell Crowe 
 Yeah, you know it's real, but I'm focused still 
 Why you focus shake it like gold field 
 'Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune 
 No acclamation, no golden seal 
 You sick side, gotta flush it down 
 We talk to folks, cover your mouth 
 Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts 
 So you go to work, you tuff it down 
 You bust it out till you're out for work 
 I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth 
 Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut 
 That cock only think you punch him out 
 I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues 
 When the time is right you gotta make a move 
 Your job is what you get paid to do 
 Your call is what you're made to do 
 I got faith in you, you're gonna make it through 
 Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you 
 Keep laboring like you got a thing to do 
 Won't taste no foods like they put you 
 No more wait for you, you gonna take it now 
 You gonna make a vault 
 As long as you walk on the earth with that first got to make me proud 
 Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts 
 Keep talking bout how stressed you are 
 Better talk about how blessed you are 
 Lord knows I had it hard today 
 Had it hard today 
 Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way 
 Cause it only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids 
 Get on running made again 
 Go to work watching in 
 Every day I'm hustling 
 Fight the traffic, lose my cool 
 Get the kids right after school 
 Think it's hard, yeah, that's true 
 This is what I have to do 
 Cause it only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 What we got is true they listen 
 Try to talk to gal but is real what I'm spitting 
 Call Christ by name but still ain't rising 
 Set to my lane but still ain't listening 
 Got ice in the vans we make so frigid 
 Still in the kill brain self when you hit it 
 Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that 
 Don't stop, get it, get it 
 Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living 
 My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving 
 We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison 
 But just because the president was black there's no racism? 
 Postracial? More like most racial 
 They hate for you disgraceful 
 Don't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you 
 Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause 
 Survive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild 
 Lord knows I had it hard today 
 Had it hard today 
 Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way 
 Cause it only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here 
 It only gets better, better 
 It only gets better from here
