 I'mma start this story, my influence so enormous 
 Got that shit you love to sing along with 
 Like every line is the chorus 
 I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie 
 I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan 
 I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson 
 You don't live this, you just a tourist 
 We ride or die for them corners 
 Fuck your private life they spy on us 
 When they catch us man it's like practice 
 For the new tactics that they try on us 
 Them cops are lining them coffers 
 Why we get shot we lying in coffins 
 They want my demise 'cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often 
 Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit 
 We like Shia LaBeouf so lawless 
 Still recognize real, still recognize real 
 Like the car I'm driving you foreign 
 My diamond cut so flawless 
 No not jewels I'm talking bout songs bitch 
 So if they after me like I'm Lauryn 
 I tell the feds that I'm moorish 
 We walking, all the girls is talking 
 Generally they butt fucking naked just like the Book of Mormon 
 We see the trees for them forest 
 My name ring them bells like a doorman 
 Y'all niggas game is so corny 
 That's why you grill them hoes just like Forman, boring 
 What's real? Do you know?

 Paper chasing we on that grind 
 Reputation on the line 
 Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time 
 Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time 
 Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time 
 Explore and discover what most fear 
 I will never wait till the brush clear 
 Swear I will never get stuck here 
 America, fuck yeah 
 Measure my career in dog years 
 My past four got them dog ears 
 I set sail, travelling the world like Jesus was doing in his lost years 
 I might give you the pill like Morpheus 
 I'm like the P.E. logo in the cross hairs 
 Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here 
 Pimps rock crocodile like false tears 
 Bring it on through your force field 
 I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal 
 What I say on display is the purest skill 
 I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real 
 What's more real, what's more real? 
 I got chicks fighting like floor sales 
 You gossiping bloggers all fail 
 Look at the yardstick measuring your tall tales 
 And you on all fours you small scale 
 All in between the legs like a dog's tail 
 You are what you eat, you don't want no beef 
 You completely vegan like all kale 
 What's real? Do you know?
