(Talib Kweli) 
 Yeah. You know. Make it work 
 Summer rain is like my ad-lips??? 
 ??? 
 Right Chris? 
 (Sound like) 
 Extra precautions when they not needed 
 We do it like this like... 
 I'm still awake... in the middle of the night 
 Try to lay it down, try to close my eyes 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 At night I can't sleep 
 Cause my heart skip a beat 
 I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve 
 I can see the deceased 
 Tear into the flesh of the weak 
 Currency bear the mark of the beast 
 Never stand for the bull 
 Even when the market asleep 
 Anything I want is in arms reach 
 And the score is so sweet 
 But the consequence is that 
 I got to wear the mark of the thief 
 I am the man with one hand 
 Stranger in a foreign land 
 New identity cost a grand 
 It's the miracle worker 
 Serving up the offering 
 So make the disabled walk again 
 Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland 
 Like the blind man that saw again 
 Like el-Hajj Malik 
 Street cats fought for him 
 And they never ate pork again 
 Bear witness to the 
 Power of transformation 
 That's the power of transformation 
 That's the power of transformation 
 That's the power of transformation 
 It's the power of transformation 
 It's the power of transformation 
 It's the power of transformation 
 It's the power of transformation 
 Make it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation 
 The adulation is such a powerful high 
 And as sour as my transportation 
 When I am heading for the clouds in the sky 
 Stay clean as the department of sanitation 
 Even though we from the gutter right 
 That's the power of transformation 
 Caterpillar to the butterfly 
 Caterpillar to the butterfly 
 Caterpillar to the butterfly 
 Caterpillar to the butterfly 
 Caterpillar to the butterfly 
 At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn (x3) 
 At night I can't sleep 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 At night I can't sleep

 Change is God 
 Survival requires transformation 
 No one said it would be easy 
 But ain't nothing worth having, easy to get 
 So run towards the challenge 
 I love the challenge 
 Every challenge is a new opportunity 
 Of self-transformation 
 So run towards the challenge 
 I run towards the challenge 
 I run towards the challenge 
 I run towards the challenge
