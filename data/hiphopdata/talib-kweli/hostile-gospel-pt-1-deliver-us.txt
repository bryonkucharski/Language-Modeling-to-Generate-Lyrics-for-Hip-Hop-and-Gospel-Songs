Deliver us, deliver us (yeah) 
 Deliver us, deliver us (what, yeah) 
 And what the people say? We wanna live it up 
 And what the people want? Please deliver us 
 And what the people need? Hey 
 I got that, yeah 
 I call these rappers baby seals, 'cause they club you to death 
 I could call em' Navy SEALs, 'cause they government feds 
 What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt 
 There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang, it's like a club or a set 
 Hip hop's the new WWF 
 What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget 
 We got till it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin' backwards 
 Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin' disaster 
 Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus 
 They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts 
 Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper? 
 An entertainer or the author of the last chapter 
 We living in these times of love and cholera 
 Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous 
 We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit 
 We still waitin' for the Congress to acknowledge this 
 What the people want? Please deliver us 
 We wanna live it up, please deliver us 
 Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel 
 I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us 
 I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us 
 Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood 
 Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow 
 You ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up 
 You can't always just borrow and asks for favors, bruh 
 Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff 
 Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin', bruh 
 I start a conversation based on general observation 
 Hip hop is not a nation, take it to population 
 Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan 
 Awaitin' trial, debatin' how the hell I got placed in this system 
 Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination? 
 They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement 
 You hear the congregation - this is the hostile gospel 
 The truth is hard to swallow, it'll leave you scarred tomorrow 
 "Keep it honest" - our motto, these niggas keep it bottled 
 I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by 'Cause D'Amato 
 DJs stickin' to vinyl like "fuck Serato" 
 Suppliers who ride around the block in the custom models 
 Ballin' like the struck the lotto, you know who the cleanest is 
 A nigga keep it rich with the stitch and Greedy Geniuses 
 I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp 
 Expose the game, treat it like a bitch 
 Smack fire out these hoes, 'cause they snitch 
 And tap wires while I plead the fifth, you can't trust a soul in the biz 
 So be careful who you eatin' with and sleepin' with' and also who you chiefin' with 
 You never know, they might've added in secret ingredients 
 What the people want? Please deliver us 
 We wanna live it up, please deliver us 
 Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel 
 I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us 
 I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us 
 Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood 
 Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow 
 Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel 
 Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle 
 The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water 
 And not take the hand of every man who make an offer 
 To black kids wishin' they white kids when they close they eyelids 
 Like "I bet they neighborhood ain't like this" 
 White kids wishin' they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers 
 It's all backwards, it's identity crisis 
 The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us 
 Drug suppliers is the health care providers 
 We cakin' makin' narcotics outta household products 
 We ain't workin' out till we exorcise the demons that's inside us 
 Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves 
 Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves 
 It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin' 
 That's why I'm spittin' freedom, we had enough of trigger squeezin' 
 People wanna live it up, please deliver us 
 We wanna live it up, please deliver us 
 Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel 
 I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us 
 I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us 
 Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood 
 Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow 
 In these trying days and times 
 All I need is to be free 
 I can't do it on my own 
 Lord can you deliver me? 
 There are trials still to come 
 It's salvation that I need 
 So I'm reaching to the sky 
 Lord can you deliver me? 
 Deliver us 
 Deliver us, yeah 
 Deliver us, ooh 
 Oh, deliver us 
 Deliver us 
 Deliver us 
 Deliver us, yeah yeah yeah
