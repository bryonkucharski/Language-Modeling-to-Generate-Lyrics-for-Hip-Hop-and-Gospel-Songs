Check it out baby, check it out y'all 
 This that upper echelon shit, what is this? 
 Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious 
 Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical 
 You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual 
 You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you 
 I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you 
 Real shit back, it's a miracle 
 Rap been laughable over the last year or two 
 Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof 
 I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical 
 Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer 
 And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya' 
 No need to brag on my paper 'cause I'm a naturizer 
 I vibrate higher, the truth break liars 
 I chose who is like us 
 The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters 
 Cut the grass we could see the vipers 
 We cut the glass 'cause we the diamonds 
 Check it out baby, check it out y'all 
 This that upper echelon shit, what is this? 
 I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling 
 Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit' 
 I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them 
 My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list 
 Kweli the artist that you wanna be 
 Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me 
 Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities 
 Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity 
 The purity you need to get in the game is gone 
 Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on 
 Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh 
 Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh 
 Waiting on me with baited breath 
 Check it out baby, check it out y'all 
 This that upper echelon shit, what is this? 
 Welcome to the 
 Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious 
 Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage 
 Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant 
 My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress 
 Ain't no question who the best is 
 You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mansions 
 Pimping down to the socks, and so is business 
 The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness 
 Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible 
 The praise that you get is barely audible 
 People is ignoring you, why? 
 The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth 
 Order suit, niggas is gassed up 
 Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up 
 Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean 
 I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian
