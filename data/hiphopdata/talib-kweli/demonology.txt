I see 'em, I see 'em 
 You don't see 'em? 
 For real? 
 Look around, son 
 Look around, son 
 Take a trip, I got you floating on this real spit 
 I rock the boat so much you get nauseous and start to feel sick 
 Too many house niggas, I'm taking 'em on a field trip 
 Your fate is sealed: a life that come with a kill-switch 
 My wife said I've got demons I've yet to deal with 
 But I ain't trying to hear her though, my music is my mirror though 
 They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap 
 My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back 
 The polar opposite of too emotional 
 Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose 
 And miss the moments trying to control 'em till I'm on overload 
 Or hard to handle, we get dismantled and now I'm home alone 
 I power trip like I'm sampling Hubert Laws no more 
 I got honor, face my karma like a Buddhist law 
 I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours? 
 I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours? 
 Too many demons in the dance hall 
 And they stomping on what you stand for 
 Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on 
 Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom 
 They live in the shadows of the angels 
 The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you 
 Proof that evil words can maim you 
 Proof that evil words can maim you 
 Demons want a pound of my flesh, it's quite accurate 
 It's tragic when you feel like your lawyer the devil advocate 
 Legal-ese ain't a language, they made it up 
 No wonder I'm losing blood, everybody taking a cut 
 Speaking in tongues, they depleting your funds 
 Beating the drums of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons 
 You think boys point guns when they run to the sun? 
 A decoy, Pink Floyd, 'cause they're comfortably numb 
 Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket 
 Trying to go native like faces that get war painted 
 Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places 
 Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader 
 Y'all haters develop and lead the role 
 When they start to give 'em parts of your life and feed the trolls 
 I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours? 
 I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours? 
 Too many demons in the dance hall 
 And they stomping on what you stand for 
 Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on 
 Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom 
 They live in the shadows of the angels 
 The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you 
 Proof that evil words can maim you 
 Proof that evil words can maim you 
 This feel like church, save that soul 
 That cry "good God, oh me, oh my!" 
 I got to save them all 
 Pray the Lord forever call on him 
 For setting the screen for evil things, then letting me ball on them 
 Pick and move, or you could die, nigga 
 Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga 
 Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms 
 Some think "Don't take, will" 
 But fuck it, you live and learn 
 Beware of the roots and salty looks 
 Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook 
 Pens and needles, hoes and blokes 
 When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat 
 I know, cause my folks lost souls off coast, never found 
 The triangle ain't just an ocean, it's on the ground 
 Take heed of the sign, dodging demons that find foregiveness 
 Young Krizzle 
 Too many demons in the dance hall 
 And they stomping on what you stand for 
 Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on 
 Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom 
 They live in the shadows of the angels 
 The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you 
 Proof that evil words can maim you
