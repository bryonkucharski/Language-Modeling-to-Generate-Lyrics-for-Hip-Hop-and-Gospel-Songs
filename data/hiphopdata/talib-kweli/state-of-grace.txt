(Talib Kweli) 
 From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top 
 From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top 
 In a state of grace 
 Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence 
 So the selling never safe 
 At the same time snitching to the Jake 
 Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake 
 But the problem we face seems so great 
 That we can't escape so we accept our fate 
 So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint 
 If an artist is a part of a community 
 And got an opportunity to get that cake 
 Would never come back to the hood, no immunity 
 Usually a nigga like that so fake, no different from a snake 
 Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take 
 If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with 
 For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste 
 Look into the face of a young girl 
 Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled 
 Got game listening to her mother's pearls 
 And she love Beyonce 'cause she run the world 
 Her mama used to run this city 
 Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy 
 When it came to the music then she got real picky 
 From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie 
 No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge 
 And she felt that Pac was more lyrical 
 Plus she never went to college 
 But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual 
 She God in the physical 
 And it's only natural to pray for a little you 
 Musical so she played the umbilical chords 
 So her daughter was born it was a miracle 
 Music is the light when it's dark 
 And the way that you spit your dart is a big part 
 She grew up loving hip hop 
 Now all her daughter got is "Love and Hip Hop" 
 Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex 
 Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement 
 Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid 
 Getting in the fights at reunions 
 She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters 
 No desire for the lying and the violence 
 That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment 
 Her body is politics 
 Lost count of how many whores she was called today 
 She won't do it no more, lost all her faith 
 They say she exaggerate when she hollerate 
 But it's only so much she can tolerate 
 (Abby Dobson) 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Stir my heart, touch my soul 
 Feed me freedom sounds you made 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Lift me up with your weight 
 Pull me to the grace 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education 
 Her entire graduation was a dire situation 
 Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation 
 But no longer felt a part of the conversation 
 Used to be I'm a 
 ride or die 
 chick 
 B.I.G. with the 
 Me And My Bitch 
 No objections, being an object, major label seeing a profit 
 She ain't never been a bitch or a ho 
 But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song 
 She used to be front row at the shows till she overdosed on the testosterone 
 Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed 
 But she felt like she really ain't belong 
 When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch 
 She erased all her songs from the phone 
 You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with 
 You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted 
 Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting 
 She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him 
 And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering 
 And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion 
 Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew 
 I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo 
 But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude 
 Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo 
 She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew? 
 (Abby Dobson) 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Stir my heart, touch my soul 
 Feed me freedom sounds you made 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Lift me up with your weight 
 Pull me to the grace 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 In the face of hate 
 She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great 
 I see lyrics as colors and shapes 
 Put it on tape, let her know I could relate 
 When you wish you could switch the way that you look 
 And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight 
 When you got no faith 
 When you hate yourself, when you hate your race 
 Let's get to the core 
 Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked 
 She a bitch, she a whore 
 And you rich and you shit on the poor 
 In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it 
 Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me? 
 And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left 
 With the charge of repping it correctly 
 When it's free online or in a cloud 
 Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial 
 You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air 
 And it's clear that your sales going down 
 Down by law then you found the raw 
 On a message board and you sounding off 
 These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause? 
 No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost 
 Rhyming is a memory 
 The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy 
 Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap 
 Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap 
 Running through you like fast food - Big Mac's 
 You don't want no problems, fix that 
 All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit 
 Now you ain't never gon' get back 
 (Abby Dobson) 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Stir my heart, touch my soul 
 Feed me freedom sounds you made 
 Help me find my way to a state of grace 
 Lift me up with your weight 
 Pull me to the grace 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 She don't love it, no 
 She don't love it no more
