Yeah, yeah 
 New Talib Kweli 
 Yeah, you know what it is 
 Come on, come on, yeah 
 Hey yo *repeats* 
 I try, I try (that's all we can do) 
 I try, you know I try 
 I try, I try (yeah) 
 I try, you know I try 
 K. West! Kweli! 
 Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name 
 Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain 
 Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same 
 You flirt till she came 
 Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture 
 Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein 
 Something to take in vain like the Lord's name 
 Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin' 
 I try, I try 
 I try, you know I try 
 I try, I try 
 I try, you know I try 
 Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher, the floor settle 
 More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle 
 I try to navigate the treacherous waters of 
 America's ghettos that set up the slaughteres 
 But there's more of us 
 Although we speak in different languages 
 We all pretty familiar with what anger is 
 Young and dangerous, ??? 
 Get up on some gangsta shit 
 Guns to bang ya wit' 
 And we put it on records to entertain ya wit' 
 I'm grown with pains way deeper than my receivers 
 Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts 
 On top of wife beaters 
 We like to light reefers 
 The 'hood need us for rappers, just ain't the right leaders 
 I put a lot into it 
 This is my product and I gotta move it 
 Stop the industry but you can't stop the music 
 An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom) 
 Some many sufferin' 'cause deep inside they're scared (so scared) 
 Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny 
 Where would they be if you and I don't care? 
 I try, I try, you know I try 
 I try, I try, I try, you know I try 
 Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane 
 A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train 
 A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself 
 Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help 
 Tryin' to bring your struggle to life 
 The label want a song about a bubbly life 
 I have trouble tryin' to write some shit 
 To BANG in the club through the night 
 When people suffer tonight 
 Lord knows I try 
 I try, I try, I try, you know I try 
 I try, I try, I try, you know I try 
 Life is a beautiful struggle 
 People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle 
 Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle 
 Some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle 
 Come on, say it now 
 Life is a beautiful struggle 
 People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle 
 Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle 
 Some people put it all together, yeah 
 I try, I try, you know I try 
 I try, oh Lord I try 
 Everyday I 
 Upside down kingdom 
 Oh, they're so scared 
 Everyday on the news we can't look around with 
 Something somewhere 
 I try, I try, you know I try 
 I try, I try, I try, you know I try 
 Lord knows, Lord knows we try 
 Yeah
