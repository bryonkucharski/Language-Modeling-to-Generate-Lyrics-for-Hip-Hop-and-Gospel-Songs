That's all I wanna do, baby 
 I mean really 
 I mean, I go out there, I work my whole life, baby 
 I put it down for you 
 I put it down for our kids 
 See, as a man I ain't got no excuse, baby 
 I'm the voice of the struggle 
 All I wanna do is write love songs about you 
 Love is a drug 
 Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz 
 Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best 
 Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure 
 Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease 
 Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep 
 Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak 
 Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak 
 Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug 
 Love is the gift, love the curse, love is the buzz 
 Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best 
 Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure 
 Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease 
 Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep 
 Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak 
 Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak 
 Never so strong, love is reap 
 When you saying love me it doesn't matter 
 See, babe, I got so much love to give 
 I don't got an ounce, I don't got grams 
 I got kilo's of love 
 Kilo, kilo, kilo, kilos of love
