I don't fuck with these niggas, nope 
 Why all these lames wanna riff? 
 It's an ass-kickin' party and your name's on the list 
 She keep my name on her lips 
 Good year like my name on the blimp 
 I get insane off the rip 
 Flip, let the beef cook like the flame on the rib tip 
 Goin' out in a blaze with the biscuit 
 Got the streets hooked like the 'caine that you sniffin' 
 Why? Why would you ever go against it? 
 If I gave a fuck about you it'd be borderline offensive 
 It's senseless, stalkin' on my page and my mentions 
 Walkin' on eggs and you soundin' all defensive 
 Hear dogs hollerin' 
 That's your ego talkin' and you're listenin' 
 When it get to whisperin' them snakes start slitherin' 
 Rappin' how they're rich and all their jewelry is glistenin' 
 Your mortgage underwater like I walked in on a christenin' 
 That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope 
 I don't fuck with these niggas, nope 
 I'm smoother than a criminal 
 I never trust niggas with no books in the livin' room 
 When there's no electricity, what the fuck is digital? 
 Beyoncé married Jigga but they think we all jiggaboos 
 Don't get confused by the lyric 
 Protector of my city, stand alone on the citadel 
 Wake up in the mornin', say a prayer 'cause I'm livin' well 
 Proof of a miracle, it's spiritual 
 These niggas go from robbin' punchlines, to bein punchlines 
 For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time 
 Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line 
 Not really for a cause but for they brothers they lay their lives when it come time 
 Trust being brave is a challenge 
 If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor 
 The nerve of these cowards, who are you, the herb of the hour? 
 I treat my girl like horiculture, I'm preservin' the flower 
 That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope 
 I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
