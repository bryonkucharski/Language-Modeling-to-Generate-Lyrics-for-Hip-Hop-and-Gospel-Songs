It's on and poppin' 
 And on and poppin' 
 And on and poppin' 
 Yes it's on and poppin' 
 Oh yes it's on and poppin' 
 And on and poppin' 
 And on and poppin' 
 Yes it's on and poppin' 
 Show me the money 
 Ain't no time to act funny 
 I'm a pick up the mic and rhyme for you honey 
 Cause the party got started 9:30 or so 
 It's a quarter past ten so I gots to go 
 With the key in the ride and I starts to cruise 
 A foundation boom at the house of blues 
 Pull up as a velt parked the ride 
 A boy says yo yo let me get inside 
 But I only got one can't swing it now brother 
 If you ain't got juice than you must pay the comer 
 No disrespect gotta move gotta bounce 
 Got a lady and a cold drink waiting by the couch 
 As I hit the do' see people I know 
 Lookin' at the big screen as they start the show 
 Gettin' in the flow and there ain't no stoppin' 
 Tonight's gon' be right 'cause it's on and poppin' 
 Now as I sort to rear to take stock of the crowd 
 I see fine faces of girls all around 
 Spotted one honey in particular 
 Who had me thinkin' of some extra cirricular 
 With a physique so tight it was strange 
 Could put a dollar in her body and she'd spit out change 
 T Bone said man, can you beileve the women 
 I said naw as I got my 7-up with lemon 
 So I walked on over to the change machine 
 Said you're the hottest honey hangin' on this scene 
 We could sit for a while talk about our dreams 
 Or we could take it to the bridge if you know what I mean 
 She said slow your roll hold on take your time 
 I think I know your face somebody said that you rhyme 
 I said my name is Young and I do hip hop 
 And if I get to hang witcha than it's on and poppin' 
 Now every night is new year's eve 
 When you got a fine lady hangin' on your sleeve 
 And I've never been much for make believe 
 So I'm a put it down proper by the time I leave 
 E-man what up, then he told me hi 
 I seen you talkin' to the lady that was oh so fly 
 I said yeah later on we'll be hooking up 
 Turn around and this lady was booking up 
 Like a bat out of hell runnin' down the stairs 
 And this wasn't in my plans for the sad welfare 
 Hopped in the 300 she was out like slick 
 Damn why that lady gotta be so quick 
 So I headed back home with my feelings hurt 
 And was it bad cologne or mouth wash not workin' 
 Then I hit the brake didn't know what to say 
 See the same 300 parked in my driveway 
 She said babe I'm sorry I hope you're not bitter 
 Got a 9-1-1 call from my baby sitter 
 I'll make it up tomorrow when I take you shoppin' 
 I said good I need some Jordans and it's on and poppin'
