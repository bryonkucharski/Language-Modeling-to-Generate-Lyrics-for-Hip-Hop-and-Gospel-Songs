(Yuh huh) 
 (Hey hey) 
 Okay, this is what I say 
 About when I was a young man 
 Back in the day 
 I see a young lady 
 Thinking she was fine 
 Then I try to step to her 
 Just to make her mine 
 Bet, I proceed with a plan 
 Tellin' her how I could be her man 
 Lookin' in her eyes 
 While I tossed the bait 
 But she threw it right back in my face 
 Now I wanted this girl just to talk to me 
 But she wouldn't even take the time to walk to me 
 I got dissed 
 And that made me made 
 So I ran home just to tell my dad 
 I had a question, for my dear father 
 If girls treat you this bad, why bother? 
 He said you're learnin' somethin' everyone else knows 
 Just listen close son 
 'Cause that's the way love goes 
 (Ah hah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 Now I remember 
 When I got older 
 The ladies got hotter 
 And my luck got colder 
 Girls tellin' me I won't go for that 
 Just because Young MC was not phat 
 Now by Phat, I don't mean overweight 
 I mean makin' crazy dollars 
 Till they come in a crate 
 Ya see, I had myself a job 
 I worked as hard as I could 
 But to the young ladies 
 It was just no goo&100 
 Wow, I guess you can't win for losin' 
 Havin' bad luck with the girls you're choosin' 
 I said to myself these dames are wack 
 But give me some time and I'm gonna get them back 
 But for now I manage my situation 
 I'm pickin' my women all across the nation 
 I'm havin' rough times with the girls I chose 
 But I'll have to deal, because yo 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Yuh hah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 Break it down 
 All right, I went out last night 
 Thinking about a girl that would treat me right 
 I find myself chillin' at a discoteque 
 And the night went better than I could expect 
 One girl, down for the whole evenin' 
 For when I got there to when I was leaving 
 We went to her place and got in a cab 
 She said she was a model 
 I said, yo, all right 
 We opened up a window to watch a full moon 
 But the night was much colder than the afternoon 
 She started to shiver 
 So I gave her my sweater 
 I said you all right? 
 She said, yeah much better 
 I held her close, she felt good in my arms 
 And I knew this girl would do me no harm 
 Thinkin' how the two of us could be as one 
 Then I fell asleep before my boat was done 
 Now I woke up, I was still in her place 
 In the mornin' sunlight I could see her face 
 Yo, I tried to get up, so I could start my day 
 But I merely knocked over my breakfast tray 
 Now this girl went and made breakfast for me 
 When last night was the first time she saw me 
 You win some, you lose some, I suppose 
 Well I feel like a winner, yo 
 'Cause that's the way love goes 
 (Ah hah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Ah hah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Oh yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 (My my my my, that's the way love goes) 
 That's the way love goes 
 See ya!
