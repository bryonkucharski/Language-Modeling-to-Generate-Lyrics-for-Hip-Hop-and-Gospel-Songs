One, two 
 Coming right back at ya 
 Just call yo' dispatcher 
 90 mile fast ball straight for the catcher 
 Stature, tall 
 Catch a fall 
 Bringing heat to the people like a match to walls 
 Now I never did claim to be a man of the streets 
 But I do know my way around some pillows and sheets 
 Kicking rhymes and beats from back in prepbuesence 
 Kept it strong throughout my adolesence 
 At first take presents would come and go 
 But I'd always make a move to improve my flow 
 Just to let y'all know I got some years in the game 
 And half of them came before you even knew my name 
 Feelin' just the same like when I kicked my first lyric 
 With brothers in the back sayin' yo that's the spirit 
 You know it when you hear it that's you what you gon' get 
 Young is coming at ya with the one hit
