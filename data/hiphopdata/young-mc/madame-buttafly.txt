Madame, madame, madame buttafly 
 I just cannot, cannot, cannot tell you why 
 You're so pleasing, pleasing, pleasing to my eye 
 'Cause you're butter, butter, butter and you're fly 
 Now the first time ever I saw you face 
 It was love at first sight in a public place 
 See you moved through the room with such style and grace 
 And like a sweet piece of candy yes I wanted a taste 
 Sex appeal in blue it was real and true 
 Like Chaka Kahn said girl I feel for you 
 But what I had to do was just chill take my time 
 Cause my main objective was to make you mine 
 Divine and every synonym that's related 
 It's taken many years but I'm glad that we waited 
 Debated on weither I should make the push 
 Because this bird in a hen is worth ten in the bush 
 Oh yes intellectual heterosexual 
 Have you coming back for more baby I bet you will 
 See what I mean when you look in my eyes 
 An I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly 
 Now madame let me tell you one thing for sure 
 When I first came across you I was immature 
 Didn't see all the changes live would put me through 
 And I know you can realte cause you were young then too 
 I had a chance to flip but no I did not trip 
 Stumbiling through meaningless relationships 
 Baby I give you a tip and you should follow the trend 
 Sometimes your best lovers comes from your best friends 
 Do you remember those late night's on the phone 
 Ain't nobody in the room but we're never alone 
 And I tell you some lady tried to tear me apart 
 The same time some punk tried to break your heart 
 And at that point it never really crossed my mind 
 That I wanted to be with you till the end of time 
 See I grew to love you that's precisely why 
 I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly 
 Now many days have passed sort of crazy fast 
 And I think that I have come out of my haze at last 
 Put myself to task and underwent the test 
 To see if this was real or if I was just obsessed 
 But it's not obsession I've learned my lesson 
 And grew with you through a true progression 
 And sting wrote a song that occurred to me 
 That if you love somebody you should set them free 
 See you've been important to me in my life 
 And in the fairytale ending you would be my wife 
 But sometimes fairytales don't come true 
 And this won't if you don't feel the same way too 
 Cause all the things you've done for me I can't measure 
 The days and nights memories that we treasure 
 The time we spend as friends brings me pleasure 
 So it makes no sense to get tense and bring pressure 
 So if you want a friend than it's fine with me 
 And baby if you want a lover you know where I'll be 
 But if I find another woman than I tell her why 
 I became a better man knowing madame buttafly
