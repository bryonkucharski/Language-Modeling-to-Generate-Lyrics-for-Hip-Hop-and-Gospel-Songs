Now is it hot in here or is it me 
 Or could it be you cause you do your voodoo baby 
 I never thought that one could really get the job done 
 Keep me warmer than the normal hot like sun 
 See cause everybody wanna get down for a minute 
 Get a girl in your world and you take it to the limit 
 This sweet young thing and me kicked it for a while 
 But she gave me more drama than the OJ trial 
 See my chest went boom when you walked in the room 
 And I knew I wasn't needed here anytime soon 
 I had to get your name number information 
 Because certain body parts had inflimation 
 In fact from the front and the back you was hittin 
 And I said damn from the place I was sittin' 
 To say I'm not sprung well Young would be a liar 
 You're taking me higher adding fuel to my fire 
 Ya don't stop 
 That's because you're adding fuel to my fire 
 Ya don't stop 
 That's because you're adding fuel to my fire 
 Ya don't stop 
 That's because you're adding fuel to my fire 
 Ya don't stop 
 That's because you're adding fuel 
 Now body temperature's ninety eight six 
 But I caught the fever when they put you in the mix 
 No doubt hon straight up you got me open 
 And I don't need aspirin or I v propen 
 Ooh look at you hella tight and on hit 
 And you've got no idea girl what you gon' get 
 Just because I gotta fever that don't mean I'm hurt 
 I have a hundred five temperature and still you work 
 Oh yes indeed lover give you what you need 
 Lover coming like Keanu with the speed lover cut me and I'll bleed 
 Lover but I never lose my spot the grooves I got is hot 
 Giving it my best shot 
 So move around baby boogie to the sound 
 And we won't stop rolling to the car breaks down 
 And if it's a flat then yo I got a spair tire 
 You're taking me higher adding fuel to my fire 
 Fine and genuine you had me high from jump 
 And I have to worry bout paying at the pump 
 Cause the fuel is free don't need cash or credit 
 You're the steamy one with the premium unleaded 
 Bonafied as you walk with pride 
 See my tank is full so come and take a ride 
 I got a clean front seat that's got your name on it 
 We can roll to the crib for the night if you want it 
 So boom-sha-lock baby listen to me rock 
 Cause you got more style than all the girlies on the block 
 And I bet yo kiss can make a prince from a frog 
 Have the brothers sayin' yo is it good to you dawg 
 I say yes but not just to impress 
 Cause you look so right in that skin-tight dress 
 And the flesh will fade because it's only skin deep 
 You're not here to get paid because you're not that cheap 
 So creep with me as we roll through the night 
 And don't sleep with me until you know that it's right 
 That was thirsty girl until you quench my desire 
 You're taking me higher adding fuel to my fire
