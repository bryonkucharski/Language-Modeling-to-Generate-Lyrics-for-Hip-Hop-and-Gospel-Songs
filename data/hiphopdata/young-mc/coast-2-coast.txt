I met a girl named hip hop in seventy eight 
 Hollis Queens New York gave us our first date 
 Man she broke me off proper yo the girl was fast 
 And everybody kept telling me it would not last 
 Cause ain't no women in the world supposed to be that sweet 
 And ya just can't trust a hot chick from the street 
 I could tell she had been through lots of struggle and strife 
 But yet in still she'd been with me over half of my life 
 Born key Jeff Taylor took me into his home 
 And introduced me to some tables and a microphone 
 Hip hop talked to me told me take your time 
 At the age of eleven I bust my first rhyme 
 Block partys in the day house partys at night 
 Just about one year before Rapper's Delight 
 Everybody in the crew called to make a request 
 Cause rap's on the radio and hip-hop was blessed 
 Didn't go to many clubs I wasn't old enough 
 And if it try to sneak it out my folks is scolding up 
 But I still do anything to get on stage 
 And once I got a club gig I lied about my age 
 Just a couple blocks away was the Hollis crew 
 Run and them used to rock at one ninety two 
 Up the street was a crew called Solo Sounds 
 Where Davey D and Mex used to throw it down 
 Man I wouldn't trade rap for anything in the world 
 Hip hop meant more to me than diamonds and pearls 
 And I still reminicse to this very day 
 And I remember those words hip hop would say 
 (Do you have love for the east coast?) 
 Yes I do 
 (The hip hop on the east coast?) 
 Yeah that's true 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 East coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 (Do you have love for the east coast?) 
 Yeah that's right 
 (The hip hop on the east coast?) 
 Yeah that's tight 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 East coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 Now I gotta get busy time to make that move 
 High school over with gotta sho' improve 
 Got college on the coast and I'm makin' plans 
 So hip hip went and told me go west young man 
 It was a different kind of style but I liked the sound 
 Everybody in the house guaranteed to get down 
 I did the casa skateland word on wheels 
 And the crazy crazy world of the record deal 
 K-day was the station that played my song 
 I got love from the people it's a shame they gone 
 Julio and Tony G yo was keeping it real 
 And Baker Boys doin' they own up in Bakersville 
 I remember other brothers putting out the gin 
 Like six in the morning and the battle ran 
 There were boys in the hood and little Nenah Cherry 
 And oh I can't forget about ooh Rock Berry 
 Before the madness when I made my fame 
 Alot of people on the west coast knew my name 
 Before the big magizines even wanted to meet me 
 I checked the back pages of the L.A. weekly 
 To see if they would write and recognize the sound 
 Cause in those days Young MC was underground 
 Lot of times I would rhyme and I'd get no pay 
 But I remember those words hip hop would say 
 (Do you have love for the west coast?) 
 Yes I do 
 (The hip hop on the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's true 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 West coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 (Do you have love for the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's right 
 (The hip hop on the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's tight 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 West coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 Talk of an east coast west coast beef makes me panic 
 I love both sides so I'm straight skitzafrenic 
 Got my skills in the east got my deal in the west 
 So I just can't say what side is the best 
 Now you love where you live that's true indeed 
 Cause your family and friends give you what you need 
 Stand up for yo' hood and you do it with pride 
 But the media tells you hate the other side 
 Now it's hard to hate a man that I have not met 
 Or hate a whole damn coast like a ???? 
 Cause hip hop is wit ya no matter where you stay 
 So remember these words hip hop would say 
 (Do you have love for the east coast?) 
 Yes I do 
 (The hip hop on the east coast?) 
 Yeah that's true 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 East coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 (Do you have love for the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's right 
 (The hip hop on the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's tight 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 West coast played a role in making a hip hop 
 (Do you have love for the east coast?) 
 Yes I do 
 (The hip hop on the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's true 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 Both coasts played a role in making hip hop 
 (Do you have love for the west coast?) 
 Yeah that's right 
 (The hip hop on the east coast?) 
 Yeah that's tight 
 From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop' 
 Both coasts played a role in making hip hop 
 (Coast to coast)
