It's the bomb, 3-2-1 detanate and boom 
 Give me some room you better wait 
 For the kid to blow-up and take off like a rocket 
 Got something up my sleeve and something else in my pocket 
 Yeah, let me see you move out there 
 Through your hands in the air like you just don't care 
 'Cause we rollin' here coming with the funk sound 
 And this ain't the government so, we won't shut down 
 First gear, make sure you got everything you need 
 Second gear, lean back as you pick up speed 
 Third gear, hit the highway you're starting to roll 
 And fourth gear, now you're looking for the cruise control 
 I got my home boys with me and we rollin' kinda tight 
 Get it washed in the day so it's shiny at night 
 And make you feel all right like when your pockets is swollen 
 So bust this as I does this and we rollin' 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 On the track and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 And there ain't no turnin' back 
 There's a party going on but it's hard to see 
 Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me 
 That's why we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 In the west and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 East coast past the test 
 There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul 
 But, it don't get started till we start to roll 
 Come one, come all we ain't looking for no static 
 You can roll low riff stick shift or automatic 
 It's an open ivitation to the whole nation 
 Yo the whole world all of civilization 
 Bob your head to the lyrics that I said 
 From an 18-wheeler down to a mo-ped 
 Even a kid can go or a bike or a trike 
 Can get with it as the people here me hit it on the mic 
 Now convoy came out twenty years ago 
 But I love that record bay don't you know 
 It doesn't matter who's up front or who's behind 
 Just as long as we rolling and we stay in line 
 So take your time as you get your boogie on 
 And let me bust my rhyme up until the break of dawn 
 Cause some try to dis and look at this like it's stolen 
 Don't trip moneygrip, pink slip and we rollin' 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 On the track and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 And there ain't no turnin' back 
 There's a party going on but it's hard to see 
 Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me 
 That's why we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 In the west and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 East coast past the test 
 There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul 
 But, it don't get started till we start to roll 
 I got kicks, I got snares, I got tracks, I got beats 
 I got more ryhmes than klans men got sheets 
 But I don't fight the quibble, bite or even nibble 
 Mess around and I have to break you down off the dribble 
 With a 1-2-3 take it to the bank 
 And before we get started put some gas in your tank 
 'Cause we don't wanna make a pit-stop for a while 
 We gonna keep it going for a couple hundered miles 
 And when we do stop it's like a brotherhood thing 
 Ladies become queens the men become kings 
 So when you hit your neighborhood treat your neighbor good 
 Ain't no other flavor make you move but I bet this flavor could 
 So give me the microphone and let me finish up my mission 
 And tell your people you won't be home and that your on an expedition 
 Cause there's a bunch of hope in my heart that I'm holding 
 So join me set yourself free 'cause we rolling 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 On the track and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 And there ain't no turnin' back 
 There's a party going on but it's hard to see 
 Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me 
 That's why we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 In the west and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 East coast past the test 
 There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul 
 But, it don't get started till we start to roll 
 Yeah we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 On the track and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 And there ain't no turnin' back 
 There's a party going on but it's hard to see 
 Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me 
 That's why we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 In the west and we 
 Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 East coast past the test 
 Yeah we roll and roll and roll without no doubt 
 To the place for the nine sase baby and I'm out
