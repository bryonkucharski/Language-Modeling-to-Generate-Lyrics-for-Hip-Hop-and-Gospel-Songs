Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing, 
 Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing, 
 And as I get to the office I can hardly speak, 
 'Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week, 
 So to my first class I run and don't walk, 
 All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk, 
 And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say, 
 Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today, 
 I try to sit down so I can take some notes, 
 But I can't read what the kind next to me wrote, 
 And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete, 
 As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat, 
 So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand, 
 And said, exscuse me but can I go to the bathroom, maam? 
 The teacher got upset, and she screamed out no, 
 It's off the principal's office you go, 
 12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria, 
 Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria, 
 Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch, 
 And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch, 
 I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken, 
 The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking, 
 I looked up at her with a smile on my face, 
 No joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place, 
 So I walked to school with ice on my lip, 
 The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip, 
 My books are real heavey, I'm walking, I'm dragging, 
 Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it, 
 Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball, 
 With the late pass I got no trouble at all, 
 But then the nurse walks up and says what do you know, 
 It's office to the principal's office you go 
 (Recess) 
 Passing notes is my favorite pass time, 
 I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to, 
 To express my feelings, 
 Give me a week B, and the girl' be dealing, 
 Now one young lady was looking at me, 
 I said hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC, 
 But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in, 
 And that's when the game of passin notes would begin, 
 I wrote the first note, told her she was fine, 
 And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time, 
 She wrote me back and told me you're fine too, 
 I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you, 
 So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling, 
 Words can't express the way that I was feeling, 
 Then I though to myself, the sure way to get her, 
 Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter, 
 When I finished the note, it was ready to pass, 
 The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class, 
 She read it word-by-word and line-by-line, 
 And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine, 
 Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late, 
 For me to write another note 'cause there would be no date, 
 The teacher looked at me, and I said I know, 
 It's off to the principal's office I go, 
 Yo, you think this is bad, wait till I get my report card
