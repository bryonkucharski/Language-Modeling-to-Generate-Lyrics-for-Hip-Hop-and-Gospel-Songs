I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Belly and beard and red and white 
 Doing his thing in boots and tights 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night 
 I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Belly and beard and red and white 
 Doing his thing in boots and tights 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Out to the club on Christmas eve 
 Check my wardrobe before I leave 
 Pretty young thing hanging on my sleeve 
 Gonna have a good time you best believe 
 Hit the ride and I'm on my way 
 Driving up as the music play 
 But in the vip valley was a shiny one horse open sleigh 
 I walked inside and I heard the sound 
 The music from the underground 
 On the floor the people gathered round 
 To see this fat man gettin' down 
 A sight to see in this disco light 
 But there he was getting down all right 
 His dance was slick, his moves were tight 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night 
 I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Belly and beard and red and white 
 Doing his thing in boots and tights 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night 
 I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Belly and beard and red and white 
 Doing his thing in boots and tights 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night 
 Dasher and prancer and dancer and vixen 
 Bobbed their heads to the DJ mixing 
 Comet and cupid and donner and blitzen 
 Were out in the back getting snacks from the kitchen 
 But rudolph man he was the troop 
 Runnin' light from the DJ booth 
 Making sure that they flashed on beat 
 Taaping hoofs like you tap your feet 
 But there he was jolly old saint nick 
 Two stepped in with the disco chick 
 The people joined him the floor was thick 
 With numbers high like arithmetic 
 But were's the bag no gift in sight 
 They must be somewhere locked down tight 
 I knew had them when he took flight 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night! 
 On the first noel angels did sing 
 Cause this year Santa is doing his thing 
 With a hohoho and a sleigh bell ring 
 We knew that he was the dancing king 
 He took the reindeer and went outside 
 Got on the sleigh and began to ride 
 And I thought to myself as he rode on his sleigh 
 Yo I saw Santa in the club last night! 
 I saw Santa I saw Santa 
 I saw Santa I saw Santa 
 I saw Santa I saw Santa 
 I saw Santa in the club last night!
