This here's a tale for all the fellas 
 Try to do what those ladies tell us 
 Get shot down 'cause you're over zealous 
 Play hard to get an females get jealous 
 Ok smartie, go to a party 
 Girls are stancin' the crowd is showin' body 
 A chick walks by you wish you could sex her 
 But you're standin on the wall like you was Poindexter 
 Next days function, high class luncheon 
 Food is served and you're stone cold munchin' 
 Music comes on, people start to dance 
 But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants 
 A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin' 
 Sits down next to you and starts talkin' 
 Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove 
 So come on fatso and just bust a move 
 You're on a mission and you're wishin' 
 Someone could cure you're lonely condition 
 You're lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 Not fine girls just ugly faces 
 From frustration first inclination 
 Is to become a monk and leave the situation 
 But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope 
 So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope 
 New movie's showin'...so you're goin' 
 Could care less about the five you're blowin' 
 Theater gets dark just to start the show 
 When you spot a fine woman sittin' in the front row 
 She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello, 
 Come sit next to me you fine fellow" 
 You run over there without a second to lose 
 And what comes next, hey bust a move 
 If you want it baby you've got it (repeat) 
 Just bust a move 
 In the city ladies look pretty 
 Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty 
 Tell a funny joke just to get some play 
 Then you try to make a move and she says "no way" 
 Girls a fakin'...goodness sakin' 
 They want a man who brings home the bacon 
 Got no money and you got no car 
 Then you got no woman and there you are 
 Some girls are sophistic... materialistic 
 Looking for a man makes them opportunistic 
 They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan 
 So that a brother with money can be their man 
 So on the beach you're strollin'...real high-rollin' 
 Everything you have is your's and not stolen 
 A girl runs up with somethin' to prove 
 So don't just stand there, bust a move 
 Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry 
 In five days from now he's gonna marry 
 He's hopin' you can make it there if you can 
 'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man 
 You say "neato"...check your libido 
 And roll to the church in your new tuxedo 
 The bride walks down just to start the wedding 
 And there's one more girl you won't be getting 
 So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin' 
 A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin' 
 She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back 
 And now you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked 
 Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin' 
 Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin' 
 Says she wants to dance to a different groove 
 Now you know what to do G, bust a move
