Hey, yeah yeah 
 You got it goin' on 
 Oh na na, na na 
 Now I wrote this record for when I perform 
 On the nights inside a university dorm 
 I put pen to paper, with the paper to pen 
 For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men 
 I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddie 
 Kruger with a Luger turning men into spaghetti 
 I'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill 
 Because my rhymes are funky-fresh and not run of the mill 
 So like a king has palaces, I give an analysis 
 You can't talk because you're suffering paralysis 
 If the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue 
 Coming to you compliments of a brother named Young 
 Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless 
 So be quiet, let an educator teach this 
 I speak to my producer so he's in a rage 
 So like he controls the vinyl, I control the stage 
 'Cause I come off 
 Yo, I come off 
 Four score and seven years ago 
 There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know 
 Four score and seven years later 
 I dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater 
 Because to battle me you're really taking a risk 
 'Cause you're an 8-track tape and I'm a compact disc 
 Like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession 
 That's how I'm dropping rappers in the rappin' profession 
 I'm comin' off 
 Just like the clothes on a hooker 
 And I can fly just like Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka 
 Like the shuttle goes up into outer space 
 People's hands go up when I enter the place 
 I don't mean to brag or boast or try to tell you I'm great 
 But I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamil can skate 
 Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive 
 Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to come off 
 Yo, I come off 
 My name is Young MC and baby I come off 
 Yo, the brother's comin' off 
 Bust this 
 A-here we go 
 A-here we go 
 A-here we go 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Here we go 
 Here we go 
 A-here we go 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 A-here we go 
 Lo and behold, Young MC struck gold 
 From the rhymes that I been singing to the young and the old 
 From the battles I've been having with the smart and the dumb 
 From the records I've been making with the mic and the drum 
 You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me 
 They run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC 
 Like a kid playing tag, it's how it's got to be 
 So when I start I say, "olly olly oxen free" 
 Yo, you could never write a rhyme as strong as this one 
 So pay attention, 'cause you don't wanna miss one 
 Of my healthy rhymes, nobody's are healthier 
 New York, New Jersey, LA and Philadelphia 
 City to city and town to town 
 Place to place, country to country, 'cause I get around 
 Even if you were in prison, you'da heard me play 
 Because the warden'd have me rockin' up on the PA 
 So when you get out, come and see my show 
 But if you start static, back in you go 
 'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of my jam 
 And when the rhymes are finally finished people say Goddamn 
 'Cause I come off 
 I come off 
 Yo baby, I come off 
 A-here we go 
 A-here we go 
 A-here we go 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
