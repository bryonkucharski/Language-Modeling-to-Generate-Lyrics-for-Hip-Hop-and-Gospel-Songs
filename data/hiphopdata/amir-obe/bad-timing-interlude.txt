You used to look so conceited, yeah 
 Now you look so defeated 
 If I knew what I know now 
 Would have been said "slow down" 
 Lookin' for a reason 
 Lookin' for a reason 
 Tell you I ruined you 
 I ruined, I prove it to you 
 You hide tears with a smile 
 Wonder you been grindin' for a while 
 Don't let your pride hear me wrong 
 Don't let my drive steer you wrong 
 You hide tears with a smile 
 Wonder you been grindin' for a while 
 Don't let your pride hear me wrong 
 Don't let my drive steer you wrong 
 Hmm, turnin' the table 
 I'm still on the table 
 Talkin' about 
 I'm still on the table 
 Talkin' about 
 Whatchu talkin' about? 
 If the moon stay up and the clocks don't work, I'll be there for you 
 Must've heard everybody that I care for say I don't care for you 
 And I'mma keep venting, best believe I'm never runnin' out of air for you 
 So when the moon stay up and the clocks don't work, I'll be there for you 
 Why, why, why, why? 
 You hide tears with a smile 
 Wonder you been grindin' for a while 
 Don't let your pride hear me wrong 
 Don't let my drive steer you wrong 
 You hide tears with a smile 
 Wonder you been grindin' for a while 
 Don't let your pride hear me wrong 
 Don't let my drive steer you wrong
