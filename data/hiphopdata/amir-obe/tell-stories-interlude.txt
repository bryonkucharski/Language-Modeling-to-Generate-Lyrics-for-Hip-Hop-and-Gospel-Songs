I don't do interviews, Lord 
 Look like I'm giving you, nah 
 Stories that you living through, yeah 
 Ain't really adding up to much 
 Gucci, Versace bragging about the Louis 
 Got the gas, ashing in the cut 
 Asking 'bout the past 
 Asking 'bout the last 
 Girl I fucked, yeah 
 That's too much to ask 
 I just went and copped the half 
 OG stinking out the bag 
 OG press him for the pass 
 Passing through for the band 
 I ain't tryna tell stories 
 I been countin' all morning 
 Spilling feelings, let you air it out 
 I don't care what you care about 
 I'm just tryna chill, fuck the camera 
 Good girls turn to dancers 
 Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab 
 Asking questions, I don't answer 
 They gon' hit me for the favor 
 Bad bitches need a savior 
 Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab 
 Leave no liquor for the chaser 
 Spilling liquor on the sinks 
 I been filling up the safe 
 Ain't no tint up on the Wraith 
 Let these bitches see my face 
 Golden child in the projects 
 Who be talking all this nonsense? 
 Kicking women out the studio 
 Hoes be fucking up the process 
 This ain't the time and the place 
 Flooded the time and face 
 Telling them lies out the face 
 Fuck hoe, get up out my way 
 I ain't tryna tell stories 
 I been countin' all morning 
 Spilling feelings, let you air it out 
 I don't care what you care about 
 I'm just tryna chill, fuck the camera 
 Good girls turn to dancers 
 Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab 
 Asking questions, I don't answer 
 They gon' hit me for the favor 
 Bad bitches need a savior 
 Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab 
 Leave no liquor for the chaser
