Met you 'round the way up 
 There's some things that I ain't said yeah 
 There's sometimes I wished you stayed yeah 
 Miss you every single day I 
 Think about you when I drink alone 
 Pop a pill and call you on the phone 
 That's that over thinking when I'm home 
 Losing focus when I'm all alone 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 I know fights and I know pain 
 Got a cup full of that purple rain 
 Only way that I can turn the page 
 Hope these lyrics find you on the way 
 Out your way is what you want, right? 
 Drunk in Texas, been a long night 
 If she gone I can tell y'all 
 How I know how you felt, nah 
 You don't know, nah 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 You don't love yourself 
 You don't trust yourself 
 You not the only one 
 You not the only one, yeah 
 No, no, no 
 No, no, no 
 Yeah, no 
 No
