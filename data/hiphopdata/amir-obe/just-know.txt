We the focus, leave the poor shit 
 I'm on some rich shit, I'm on some boat shit 
 I'm on a PJ, I'm from the PJs 
 From the Westside, I'm out in Eastway 
 I don't say shit, niggas ain't shit 
 You niggas bitch made, you niggas Caitlyn 
 There's no mistaken, I'm straight out the way with it 
 Swipin' the debby, I pay wit it, say I won't 
 Been broke and bougie in Saint Lauren 
 Still cop a loosy, man, say I won't 
 Might tuck the toolie, man, say I won't 
 Runnin' the city, man, say I don't 
 You gettin' desperate, I need the money to the decimal 
 I flooded the Rollie just to mess with you 
 Red bone, red seats, more money, less sleep 
 Just know, if she say she love me it ain't mutual 
 She introduced to the team, that's the usual 
 They hate on me, bro, only you would know 
 West side, East side, fuck around with each side, each time 
 I ain't gon' fuck around, me time 
 When you get to stunt like he lyin' 
 Just know, hit me if you need plugs 
 Just know, hit me if you need drugs 
 Hit me with the word, hit you with the serve 
 Hit me, just know, you should hit me, hit me 
 I'm touchin' the cake, bustin' the bank 
 As long as my brothers is straight 
 Breakin' the profit I made 
 Free all the partners upstate 
 Just wait till all of my partners is done with probate 
 Take 'em off the corner to the border clear the customs 
 Can't afford to fuckin' function 
 I kinda sorta had enough with ya 
 Might go back on what it was wit you 
 Do it big, wanna puff wit ya, wanna cut from ya 
 Hold it down, I want the trust from ya, that's a must from ya 
 Mama outta debt, wallet lookin' blessed 
 Fuck me is fuck you, don't talk 'bout respect 
 Check, check, check after fuckin' check 
 Check for me, city rep for me 
 Just know 
 Just know, hit me if you need plugs 
 Just know, hit me if you need drugs 
 Hit me with the word, hit you with the serve 
 Hit me, just know, you should hit me, hit me
