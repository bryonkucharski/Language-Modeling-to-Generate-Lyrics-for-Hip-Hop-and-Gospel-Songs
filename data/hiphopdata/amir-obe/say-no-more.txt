... 
 Stop all the talking, they say 
 There's no too often these days 
 We're going running and running around 
 Fuck around gon' beat ya man down 
 She dolled up with that photo, yeah 
 Drunk bitch tryna' make convo, yeah 
 She just want me 'cause I'm next 
 She just want me 'cause I'm next, yeah yeah 
 If she keep talkin' 'bout her ex 
 Need to put the pussy on reset, yeah yeah 
 Just want the respect 
 I'll go for me and my set 
 Ask bout my side, I say west 
 Ask bout my life, I say blessed 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it all before 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it all before 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it before 
 See you on MediaTakeOut 
 Used to be Netflix and take out 
 Pass through the city, I think about you 
 You know that it's you when I sing about you 
 Drunk dialing, I'm wildin' 
 Can tell that you care when you crying 
 Can tell that you gave up on trying 
 Front like it's love, we been lying 
 Yeah, just want the respect 
 I'll go for me and my set 
 Ask bout my side, I say west 
 Ask bout my life, I say blessed 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it all before 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it all before 
 Say no more, say no more 
 You heard it all 
 You heard it before 
 Throwing up the west, smoking on the best 
 Headed to the east, let you know we eatin' 
 I be in the street, I be in the streak 
 You be in the birds throwing up the bees 
 Sitting pretty in the drought 
 Broke niggas love to say "Meet me at the top" 
 Rollin' up the loud, I got the whole city proud 
 Couple niggas made it, I'm like "Where they at now?" 
 Back to back Benzes on Broadway 
 Black on black lenses in broad day 
 Fuck what a broad say, I'm getting brain while I'm listening to Sade 
 Smooth operator, if I don't do it for myself I do it for the haters 
 Do it for the paper, do it for the love 
 She ain't fucking for the money, she gon do it just because nigga 
 Throwing up the west, smoking on the best 
 Headed to the east, let you know we eating' 
 I be in the street, I be in the streak 
 You be in the birds throwing up the bees 
 Sittin' pretty in the drought 
 Broke niggas love to say "Meet me at the top" 
 Rollin' up the loud, got the whole city proud 
 Couple niggas made it, I'm like "Where they at now?"
