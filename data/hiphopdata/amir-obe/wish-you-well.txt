Know your place yeah, know your place yeah 
 I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient 
 I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah 
 I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah 
 Yup, pour my problems in a red cup 
 Only check-up when the cheques 
 Come 
 My pockets looking blessed up 
 All that talking never stretched up 
 They talking like they jealous of me 
 They talking like they never loved me 
 They talking like they next up 
 I still treat 'em like a stepson 
 Champagne showers on the way 
 I've been working twenty-five hours everyday 
 Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain 
 Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain 
 Know your place yeah, know your place yeah 
 I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient 
 I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah 
 I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah 
 Know your place yeah, know your place yeah 
 I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient 
 I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah 
 I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah 
 Promises and wishes, candles for my exes now 
 Ain't no fingers left to count my blessings now 
 Promises and wishes, trust me it's been different now 
 No rings for the 'tings, I go missing now 
 Promises and wishes, why would I ever stop celebrating? 
 Why would I ever stop celebrating? 
 I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking 
 I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking 
 Champagne showers on the way 
 I've been working twenty-five hours everyday 
 Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain 
 Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain 
 Know your place yeah, know your place yeah 
 I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient 
 I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah 
 I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah 
 Know your place yeah, know your place yeah 
 I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient 
 I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah 
 I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah
