Same old me, still no good 
 Tied up with the talk and the drama 
 Fucking 'til the sun up and I'm gone 
 Looking for relations baby, nah, nah, nah 
 Lowkey feeling like a star though 
 Looking for affection, I been hollow 
 I remember writing all them songs, you the subject 
 I am just your ex, not your ex that you up next 
 Sometimes I gotta shit on you 
 Routines bringing all the bitch out you 
 Moving through the city, you'll be running to me 
 Fuck these bitches saying, I be running the street 
 Yeah, where, where you go? 
 You ain't never seen it all 
 Pockets, pockets, got my change up 
 I be leaning with you later 
 Yeah, you're the one that I need, oh 
 You're the one that I wanted 
 You're the one I get high for 
 You're the one that I lean on 
 Get high for, high for 
 Get high for, high for 
 You're the one that I lean on 
 Get high for, high for 
 Get high for, high for 
 Yeah, you're the one that I need, oh 
 You're the one that I wanted 
 You're the one I get high for 
 You're the one that I lean on 
 Aye, you're the one that I lean on 
 Same old me, still no good 
 Blew my mind, I'm still so hood 
 From the projects, man, I thought you understood 
 On vacay, bring her back to the hood 
 Ain't shit, just quick inspo 
 Still fucking bitches, smoking out the window 
 Still treat me like a star, like she didn't know 
 We just move lowkey, no info 
 Wasn't fucking back then, we're on the floor now 
 Boss up, rolling weed in the club now 
 Fuck the who's who and the what's what now 
 She go coo-coo I'm a new drug now 
 You could pick the flight we'll figure it out, yeah 
 You could pick the night we'll figure it out, yeah 
 I don't even know what you're tripping about 
 You should hit the uber and get out the house, yeah
