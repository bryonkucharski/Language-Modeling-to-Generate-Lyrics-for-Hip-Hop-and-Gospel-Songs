Smoking something right for the wrongs now 
 Make these bitches sing along now 
 Don't let them lyrics leave you wanting now 
 I'm still fucking all them broads now 
 I lost patience in a waitress 
 She been living too complacent 
 All them rumors make me anxious 
 Where'd you get your information? You... 
 Cause every time I'm around you 
 You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself 
 Here's a bullet for your pride babe 
 Here's a bullet for you, pull the trigger 
 Cause every time I'm around you 
 You just got some bad news for me babe 
 Here's a bullet for your pride babe 
 Here's a bullet for you, pull the trigger 
 To you I'm just a struggle rapper 
 Go for low blows, then you suck me after 
 I hear the chatter and the sudden laughter 
 Now who's fast-forward? I don't hustle backwards 
 I got you humming to my songs, yeah 
 Girl you used to cut me off, yeah 
 Now I got it like I said I would 
 And you ain't saying nothing, like I said you would 
 'Bout to set the wood on fire 
 Bitch I wish you would, call mine yeah 
 Off brand niggas tryna cuff you 
 Pillow talking to yourself, I don't judge you 
 Used to never say you proud of me 
 It's awkward that you doubted me 
 I just copped the whip and a house for me 
 Fuck approval, I'mma vouch for me 
 Cause every time I'm around you 
 You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself 
 Here's a bullet for your pride babe 
 Here's a bullet for you, pull the trigger 
 Cause every time I'm around you 
 You just got some bad news for me babe 
 Here's a bullet for your pride babe 
 Here's a bullet for you, pull the trigger
