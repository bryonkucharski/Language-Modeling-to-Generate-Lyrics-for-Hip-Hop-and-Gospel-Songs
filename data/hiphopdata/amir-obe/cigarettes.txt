I, I, I... never read ya 
 I got amnesia 
 I don't remember 
 I got a temper 
 You stalkin' now 
 I fuck around 
 You fuck around 
 We both not proud 
 You said I'm different 
 I'm difficult 
 You said I'm missin' 
 I'm missin' you 
 You poppin' up 
 I'm poppin' out 
 They talkin' now 
 Just block 'em out 
 Yeah, new phone, who dat? 
 New thread, do it 
 Don't kill the vibe, bitch, I'm too lit 
 Them rumors come from you, I knew it, knew it 
 Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you 
 If you ever sinkin', I go down with you 
 All I need my baby and a cigarette 
 Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet 
 Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you 
 If you ever sinkin', I go down with you 
 All I need my baby and a cigarette 
 Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet 
 I can see your true colors, ain't nothin' true 
 I been with you two summers, ain't nothin' new 
 Watch you get done up and tell me it's for me 
 See you in public, you actin' differently 
 Brand new, brand new, brand new 
 'Bout to dumb it down, don't understand you 
 Ain't no point in flexin' 'cause I am too 
 Flexin', flexin', flexin' like a dance move
