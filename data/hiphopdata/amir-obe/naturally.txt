Lost my mind, thousand times 
 It's just you, tryna find 
 Lost inside, lost in time 
 Lost my love, lost my mind 
 Tryna find some songs to relate to 
 Tryna find excuses to hate you 
 Ain't no make up out here gonna make you 
 And ain't no break-up with me gonna break you 
 Heartless, at times I feel a darkness 
 Sometimes I think you want this 
 You got this, you got this 
 Just don't ignore the signs 
 You can stop this, tho 
 Lost my mind, thousand times 
 It's just you, tryna find 
 Lost inside, lost in time 
 Lost my love, lost my mind 
 Bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 You a bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 I'm just an audio clip with some truth 
 My lyrics on the side o' yo wrist tattoo 
 I ain't in The Loop, but they keep me on loop babe 
 You don't understand, this is all about you babe 
 Aye, I miss conversations in the silence 
 When we don't speak it speaks volumes 
 Now you're livin' in the silence 
 And I been livin' in your eyelids 
 Lost my mind, thousand times 
 It's just you, tryna find 
 Lost inside, lost in time 
 Lost my love, lost my mind 
 Bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 You a bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 You a bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 You a bitch, that's your personality 
 Ay, wear it so naturally 
 You a- 
 Lost my mind, thousand times 
 It's just you, tryna find 
 Lost inside, lost in time 
 Lost my love, lost my mind 
 Lost my mind, thousand times 
 It's just you, tryna find 
 Lost inside, lost in time 
 Lost my love, lost my mind
