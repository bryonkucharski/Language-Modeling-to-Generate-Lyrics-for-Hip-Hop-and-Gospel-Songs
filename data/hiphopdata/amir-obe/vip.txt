I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before 
 All them rapping niggas that you vouching for 
 Lost a good girl for a bad one 
 And then she claiming, yeah, I'll be the last one 
 Tell me all your flaws, bet you I'll relate 
 Tell me all your wrongs, bae, I'll take the blame 
 Smoking on the ganja, got me so cloudy 
 Kill my energy, they still got doubts about me 
 Hit me when I'm lit, just before the vomit 
 Chase me when I'm coming down, and solve my problems 
 Think it when I'm sober, say it when I'm drunk 
 Don't need no closure, I'm still thinking that it's love 
 I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before 
 All them rapping niggas that you vouching for 
 Lost a good girl for a bad one 
 And then she claiming, yeah, I'll be the last one 
 She don't love me, she just love potential, I know 
 Searching for yourself, you need direction, I know 
 You too fine to blend in with the rest of these hoes 
 I'm just another guy that tried impressing you though 
 Bite my tongue until it bleeds 
 Tryna figure you out, but you hard to readbaby 
 I'm just honest, them promises hard to keep babe 
 See you run through my nightmares, it's hard to sleep babe 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Tell me all your flaws, bet you I'll relate 
 Tell me all your wrongs, babe, I'll take the blame 
 Smoking on the ganja, got me so cloudy 
 Kill my energy, they still got doubts about me 
 Hit me when I'm lit, just before the vomit 
 Chase me when I'm coming down, and solve my problems 
 Think it when I'm sober, say it when I'm drunk 
 Don't need no closure, I'm still thinking that it's love 
 Yeah, yeah
