Fuck around and get rich fucking with OVO 
 Might get another Rollie, might get another bracelet 
 24 carat 
 RIP Mikel and Abdullah 
 93's whassup? 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good 
 Questions like, "Can you get Drake's number?" Nope, no way, Jose 
 Rolling out, every time the hummer pull out, remember slowly in the slow lane 
 Police still watchin' the boy now 'cause I ain't no boy now, I'm the man 
 Tings I gotta understand, my girl wanna see a plan 
 House, and a Porsche to drive in 
 We just need some keys just to put them inside it 
 The crib look like a temple, man we livin' in silence 
 We juugin' so silently, the money is silent 
 True, say the girls do adore us 
 Who do we all do it for? 
 Hey, sorry for the wait, amen 
 All I need's a little more room for me 
 And it'll be straight 
 I'm at Petro gassin' up, tell that boy his pass is up 
 Cut the cheque, quit checkin' up, I'm okay 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good 
 Don't say you've been hittin' me up 
 Don't say you've been callin', brand new foreign, it just picked me up 
 All that talkin', you say I ain't down for you 
 A nigga like me ain't got no time for girl like you 
 No apologies, I hold a grudge 
 Dealin' with the comma, broken hearted women try fix me up 
 I ain't with the swindle, smokin' out the window 
 I don't pass the blunt, no no 
 Taro's in the cup, girl I used to fuck with you till I realized who I was 
 No way, 45 nights on the low 
 45 nights in a row, true say 
 You adjusted to the road 
 You get the packet, you live through pics and the captions 
 You talk a lot just to say that you have it 
 Back now, we fuck with no passion 
 And if they keep askin', I say I'm good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good 
 I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
