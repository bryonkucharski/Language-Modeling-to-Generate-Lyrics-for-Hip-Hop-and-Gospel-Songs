Imma find me 
 A woman that's real 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's strong 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's oh so true 
 I got a pedestal to put her on 
 I found me a Girl 
 She's sweet as could be 
 An everythin' in her world 
 Revolved all around me 
 I had a chance to make her mine 
 But I was too blind to see 
 And now I got too let her go 
 An pray she comes back to me 
 -She's my angel she's my lover 
 -She's my very best friend 
 -I hate her 'cause I love her 
 -So I hurt her again 
 -Don't want no other lover 
 -Won't go through it again 
 -She's my Angel She's my lover 
 -She's my very best friend 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's young 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's pretty 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that swears I'm the one 
 An imma try not to treat her shitty 
 Girl I been drinkin' 
 Ever since you been gone 
 An I been thinkin' 
 Maybe that I was wrong 
 You been holdin' out for way to long 
 I get this feeling you don't wanna belong 
 -She's my Angel, She's my Lover 
 -She's my very best friend 
 -I hate her 'cause I love her 
 -So I hurt her again 
 -Don't want no other lover 
 -Won't go through it again 
 -She's my Angel She's my lover 
 -She's my very best friend 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's tough 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that's loyal 
 Imma find me 
 A woman that say she got enough 
 And that's the one I'm gonna spoil 
 Well I've been waitin 
 Such a very long time 
 My hearts gonna break 
 Girl if I don't make you mine 
 What's past is past 
 What's done I cannot rewind 
 All said and done girl 
 So your one of a kind 
 -She's my Angel, She's my Lover 
 -She's my very best friend 
 -I hate her 'cause I love her 
 -So I hurt her again

 -Won't go through it again 
 -She's my Angel She's my lover 
 -She's my very best friend
