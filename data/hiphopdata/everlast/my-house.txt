I know you heard it before, but it's true 
 C'mon! What you 'fraid of? 
 It's gon' do you some good 
 For all the girls that I loved before 
 That got a lot more than they bargained for 
 They got a lot more than they was anticipatin' 
 Started off lovin', winded up hatin' 
 Remember back when we were very first datin' 
 You said baby be patient 'cause I'm all about waitin' 
 I'm not your overnight stick and move easy 
 You gotta prove your love or I'm really kinda cheesy 
 She's her daddy's girl, oh so fine 
 Do anything in this world, to make her mine 
 We'll sip a lil' wine 
 Talk and see what this is all about 
 C'mon over to my house 
 C'mon over to my house 
 C'mon over to my house 
 We could have some fun at my house 
 We can do this like Brutus on a Tuesday night 
 Can burn some nice hemp and make the place smell right 
 Could roll you up some trees, could make you a bite 
 Could maybe watch a movie or the UFC fight 
 Could play a little chess, or sit by the fire 
 And conversate for a while 'bout human desire 
 We'll do a little bettin' we could do a little kissin' 
 Get what you need gettin' girl you don't know what you missin' 
 Baby girl let me know 
 If you have any doubts 
 C'mon over to my house 
 C'mon over to my house 
 C'mon over to my house 
 We could have some fun at my house 
 We could put on some tunes, and sing a few songs 
 Call up your friends tell 'em all come along 
 We'll fire up the grill, and start up a party 
 Cause ev-a-ry-one needs the love of somebody 
 We can sip on tequila, and act like a fool 
 And wake up all the neighbors when we jump in the pool 
 Come on over and spend some time 
 And, put some hope in this heart of mine 
 Lay your head in my lonely arms 
 No surprises, no alarms 
 And baby girl let me know 
 Are you in, are you out? 
 C'mon over to my house 
 C'mon over to my house 
 We could have some fun at my house 
 Baby we can call it our house 
 C'mon over to my house
