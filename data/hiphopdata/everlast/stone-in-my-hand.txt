Ride with the devil, hide with the Lord 
 I got no pistol, ain't got no sword 
 I got no army, ain't got no land 
 Ain't got nothing but the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 Ain't got nothing but the stone that's in my hand 
 You say you want a revolution, well get on board 
 We'll start a new crusade, we'll start a Holy war 
 Don't need no orders, don't need no plan 
 I don't need nothing but the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 I don't need nothing but the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 I don't need nothing but the stone that's in my hand 
 You build your fighter jets, you drop your bombs 
 You kill our fathers, you kill our moms 
 Kill our brothers and our sisters, and our uncles and our aunts 
 Still I'm fighting with the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 Still I'm fighting with the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 All the love that's in my heart and the stone that's in my hand 
 Blood runs the gutters, smoke fills the sky 
 Every son that suffers, every mother cries 
 So if you've had enough and you're ready for your stand 
 I'll be waiting with the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 Yeah, I'll be waiting with the stone that's in my hand 
 Stone in my hand, stone in my hand 
 All the love that's in my heart, and the stone that's in my hand
