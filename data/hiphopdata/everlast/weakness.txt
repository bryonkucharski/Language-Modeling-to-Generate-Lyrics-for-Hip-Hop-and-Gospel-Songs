Met a fine red boned mami, she told me that her name was Lucille 
 Met her on Fountain Avenue sitting on a Cadillac Coupe de Ville 
 She said I'm a liar, a thief, a junkie and I used to be a whore 
 And I've been trying to shake this monkey so long I just can't take it no more 
 I got a weakness, I got a hunger, I got a jones 
 I'm sick and I need to get well, I hurt deep in my bone 
 I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst, 
 I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble 
 Just waiting for it to burst? 
 We talked all afternoon, she made me cry, I told some jokes 
 She looked me deep in my eyes and told me love was nothing but a cruel hoax 
 Her grandmother died when she was five and she never did know her folks 
 Her father fell in a gun fight and her mother by an overdose 
 I got a weakness I got a hunger, I got a jones 
 I'm sick and I need to get well, I hurt deep in my bones 
 I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst, 
 I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble 
 Just waiting for it to burst 
 She said I've slept with gangsters, thugs and smugglers, congressman and governors 
 I've seen therapists and holy men but this weakness is my only friend 
 It feeds my need it numbs my soul, it starts to creep and takes control 
 Sell my flesh I pierce my skin 
 And tomorrow I'ma do it all again 
 I got a weakness I got a hunger I got a jones. 
 I'm sick and I need to get well 
 I hurt deep in my bones. 
 I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst, 
 I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble 
 Just waiting for it to burst?
