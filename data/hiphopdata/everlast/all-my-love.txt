Gets all my love (4x) 
 Pick up the pace, keep it, freak it 
 Can ya keep a secret, so can I 
 Why ask why, try Bud dry 
 I get fly smokin' a thai, puffin' a blunt 
 Tokin' a spliff, stoppin' any crew that tries to rip 
 The House of Pain, Cypress Hill, Funkdoobiest 
 My girl's on the pill, so I can drill, and not have to kill 
 An unborn child cause that's just wild 
 I felt the pain, I built the house 
 All respect due to Mickey Mouse 
 Club, I'm rhymin' on the dub 
 Switch off the track so I can shout out my love 
 Yeah, you know my mother, she gets all my love 
 My sister Cassandra, my neice Jessica Rose 
 They get all my love, Danny Boy gets all my love 
 My DJ Lethal, he gets all my love 
 Cypress Hill, they get all my love 
 Son Doobie the Vocal Avenger, he gets all my love 
 Ralph Emms the Mexican gets all my love 
 The Divine Styler, he gets all my love 
 Bronx Style Bob and Claudia, they get all my love 
 My man Wise Guy gets all my love 
 Yes, you know my man Matt Champy gets all my love, rest in peace my brother 
 I know you in a better place now than when you were here 
 Kahaku gets all my love 
 My man Cameron, First Born, Scribbles, and ATA, they get all my love 
 'Cause those are my boys, ya know, ha ha 
 My man Al B. gets all my love, good lookin' out my brother 
 Yeah, my man Balthazar get even the thirteenth floor get all my love 
 My man Captain Rudethrow gets all my love
