All my money's spent 
 All my prayers been said 
 Walking up that hill 
 Legs are nearly dead 
 It won't be long at all 
 Heartbeats tick away 
 Feel it in my bones 
 Will I see the day, 
 Pay off all these loans? 
 It won't be long at all 
 It won't be long at all 
 Long and winding roads 
 I walked 'em all in vain 
 When that trumpet blows 
 Hope they call my name 
 Won't be long at all 
 Put your rifles down 
 Abandon all your arms 
 Sing your prayers out loud 
 The Gospel's in your song 
 'Cause it won't be long at all 
 No it won't be long at all 
 It won't be long at all 
 Stop your warring way 
 Only kill your bros 
 Put your season skies 
 Kindness to your mom 
 It won't be long at all 
 It won't be long at all 
 Teach your children well 
 Beg them to be kind 
 'Cause they'll be running shit 
 When you're old, deaf, dumb and blind 
 And it won't be long at all 
 No, it won't be long at all 
 It won't be long at all 
 It won't be long at all
