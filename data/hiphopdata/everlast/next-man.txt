I rock a jam for love 
 I quit my band for love 
 I'll smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love 
 Make you cry like a dove 
 Leave you standin' alone 
 In a world so cold 
 Watch the drama unfold 
 'Cause you sell your soul 
 Now you're fearin' your death 
 Sniffin' crystal meth till there ain't none left 
 But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it 
 You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted 
 You probably won't admit it 
 So you start to sink lower 
 You're caught in the flood 
 And you're tryin' to find Noah 
 If you hungry and your near me yo, you gonna get fed 
 If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head 
 Then come take my bed, I'll sleep on the floor 
 Cause these are the times that friends are for 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 I get uptight for love 
 You know I'll fight for love 
 I might keep my wifey up all night for love 
 And when the daylight comes 
 I be seein' mad bums 
 With no shoes on their feet 
 Plus nothin' to eat 
 I can't save the whole street 
 So I feel like I'm beat 
 And why play the game when nothin' gonna change 
 The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans 
 I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend 
 Tryin' to keep my dean 
 I try to give to the poor 
 Tryin' to get through this life 
 And get through that door 
 I'm all up in this mix 
 For these final tics 
 Goin' all the way to seven 
 And it's half past six 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 I pray to God for love 
 I'll make Jihad for love 
 And I just might pull your freakin' card for love 
 Make you sing 'Hey Love' like my man King Son 
 I freak the art noise 
 Over all you toys 
 Better bring your boys 
 Summon all your crew 
 No matter what you do 
 It's comin' back on you 
 Just like a planet orbits 
 Let your sponge absorb it 
 It's logical conclusion 
 It's b-boy fusion 
 And confusion say that he want control 
 Of your mentality 
 Your body and your soul 
 So if you lose your whole 
 Come and take my hand 
 And link up this jam 
 'Cause money that's the plan 
 Tryin' to get through this maze 
 Not to win this race 
 We either ridin' on our horse 
 Or walkin' on our face 
 So come take your place on the side of love 
 And swallow up your ego and your pride for love 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 I see everybody out here doin' for self 
 And they don't give a damn on the next man 
 Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
 I can't wait till you the next man 
 Can't wait till you the next man 
 Can't wait till you the next man...
