Mr. Whitey Ford 
 I see the nightmare inside 
 Of your American Dream 
 I'm screaming: 
 Bismi allah al-rahman al-raheem 
 With your fascist regime 
 And racist magazines 
 Trying to ruin peoples livelyhood 
 You're all hoods 
 All their tricks and bedfellows 
 There's safety in numbers 
 Cause some cats are fighters and 
 Some cats are runners 
 Big game hunters assassin made politicians 
 While corporate CEOs 
 Got their ruthless ambitions 
 Nostradamus premonitions 
 They see the end coming 
 Every kid from the suburb 
 A hundered miles and runnin' 
 The influence is stunnin' 
 Enough to make you stagger 
 Cause prep-school Johnny 
 Got some thug in his swagger 
 Take seven politicians 
 Put them in a line 
 Take seven Hollow Points 
 Put them in my Nine 
 I'll give them seven more minutes 
 For some prayin' time 
 Then I'll pull back my trigger 
 And I'll blow your mind...
