Sitting restless under the moonlight 
 I know I'm getting ready to kill 
 They say we're going in with the daylight 
 I don't want to but I will 
 'Cause I won't know the man that kills me 
 And I don't know these man I kill 
 I pray to God for my salvation 
 Wash away the blood I spill 
 I try not to think about my family 
 'Cause it's a little too much take 
 Now here I got me and I got my buddy 
 Who can't afford even one mistake 
 I'm sorry about writing on dirty cardboard 
 It's the only paper I can find 
 Tell everyone I got their letters 
 Tell everyone I'm doing fine 
 Late at night when I can dream I 
 I think about life back in the world 
 I miss you and Dad 
 I miss sister Sarah 
 I Miss my wife and baby girl 
 Pray for me pray for my soul ma 
 Pray for me and all my sins 
 They say I got a job to do now 
 And I'll be back when it finally ends 
 Do you think I should be fighting? 
 Mom are you proud are you ashamed 
 I really am trying to do the right thing 
 I hope my government can say the same 
 'Cause I won't know the man that kills me 
 And I don't know these man that I kill 
 Cause not one of us doing god's will
