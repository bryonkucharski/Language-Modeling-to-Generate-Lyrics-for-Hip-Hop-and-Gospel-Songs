Ends, some people will rob their mother 
 For the ends, rats snitch on one another 
 For the ends, sometimes kids get murdered 
 For the ends, so before we go any further 
 I want my ends 
 I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar 
 He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar 
 Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A. 
 But now he's waiting tables cause there's rent to pay 
 Companies downsizing, inflation's rising 
 Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed 
 Doesn't even feel the effects when he says 
 Forgot to count how many times he been blessed 
 So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack 
 And once it hits his brain, it starts to chain react 
 He sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet 
 He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street 
 And all of sudden he's like Jesse James 
 Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains 
 But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool 
 So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool 
 For the ends... etc. 
 I knew this chick named Sally, she had a nice strut 
 And everywhere that I went, she was up in the cut 
 Swinging that butt, like 'place your ad here' 
 Only rapped the benz, and rocked the fly gear 
 Brand name wearing, champagne waving 
 Jewels around the neck, a life style she's craving 
 Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending 
 If you do the lending, she'll do the bending 
 Straight machine vending, it's money for take 
 Shopping sprees get her on her knees 
 And if you hit her with keys to your crib, you acting funny 
 Come home one day, find her counting out your money 
 From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo 
 If you're broke she's spittin', and if you're rich she might swallow 
 For the ends... etc. 
 I knew these two homeboys, that made a lot of noise 
 Making money on the block, kids was on they jock 
 They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run 
 DMC, they was toting guns 
 Holdin' weight, goin' out of state 
 Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips 
 Fly jewels and clothes, and got no job 
 And then one disappeared, and one got robbed 
 For the ends... etc.
