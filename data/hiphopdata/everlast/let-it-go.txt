Change your look, cut your hair 
 And I pretended like I don't care 
 Your so lovely girl, stop crying 
 Bite my lip, I close my eyes 
 Try to tell myself your no prize 
 Can't forget you girl but I'm tryin' 
 No one else will ever be 
 The things that you are to me girl 
 Kind of special hey I ain't lying 
 Bite your neck, I pull your hair 
 You're so innocent and unaware 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so scared girl 
 I'm dying here 
 Every single time I went and fell in love 
 Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out 
 And every single time I couldn't let it go 
 Babygirl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt 
 Grab your shoes, walk out the door 
 Like you've done a thousand times before 
 But you got nowhere you can go to 
 Try to run girl but you can't hide 
 All the voices deep down inside 
 Repeat all them things that I told you 
 You're steadily on my mind 
 Girl spoonin' you from behind 
 That's my favorite way that I hold you 
 For every time I let you down 
 For every tear that touched the ground 
 For every sincere apology that I owe you girl 
 Every single time I went and fell in love 
 Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out 
 And every single time I couldn't let it go 
 Babygirl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt 
 I've been loving you a little too long 
 And still I keep holding on 
 It's been a year since you been gone girl 
 Check it out now 
 Every single time I went and fell in love 
 Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out 
 And every single time I couldn't let it go 
 Babygirl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt 
 Every single time I went and fell in love 
 Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out 
 And every single time I couldn't let it go 
 Babygirl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt
