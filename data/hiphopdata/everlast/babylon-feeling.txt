My heart is broke, my will is gone 
 Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
 She hook me to the gills 
 All of her forbidden thrills 
 I call her baby for short then I ramble on 
 She'll forget about me 
 My soul is high, my mind is free 
 Met a shorty with some back call her destiny 
 She showed me all my fates 
 My stream of conscious navigates 
 I orbit around the sun at high velocity 
 Don't forget about me 
 Don't forget about sweet things 
 Won't you save my soul 
 Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
 Sweet things 
 Won't you save my soul 
 Pretty lady, won't you take me home... tonight 
 My arms are heavy, my body's tense 
 Got the hots for this honey named confidence 
 She points out all of my flaws 
 Breaking all of her favorite laws 
 Never speaks a word in my defense 
 Just forget about me 
 My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive 
 Got a thing for this bitch 
 Said her name is a lie 
 She controls me with her fear 
 My prayers fall on her cold deaf ear 
 She says have a good time and take your dive 
 Just forget about me 
 Just forget about 
 Sweet things, won't you save my soul (Yeah) 
 Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
 Sweet thing won't you save my soul (Yeah) 
 Pretty lady won't you take me home... tonight 
 I've got a Babylon feelin' 
 I've got a Babylon feelin' 
 I've got a Babylon feelin' 
 I'm feelin' Babylon 
 My heart is broke, my will is gone 
 Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
 She hook me to the gills 
 All of her forbidden thrills 
 I call her baby for short, then I ramble on 
 And I ramble on 
 I've got a Babylon feelin' 
 I've got a Babylon feelin' 
 I've got a Babylon 
 Feelin', Feelin', Feelin', yeah 
 I've got a Babylon 
 Feelin', Feelin', Feelin', yeah

 Feelin', Feelin', Feelin', yeah 
 I've got a Babylon 
 Feelin', Feelin', Feelin', yeah
