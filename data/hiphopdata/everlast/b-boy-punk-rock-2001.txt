Ha Ha 
 Whitey Ford 
 X-ecutioners Style 
 MC am I 
 People call me "Ev" 
 When I'm busting up the party hear my engine rev 
 With high resolution in the late p.m. 
 X-Men scratch this beat while I drop this gem 
 Got tints on my window so you can't see in 
 "Pack it up, pack it in" baby once again 
 Ain't no way to check me (check me) 
 No way to wreck me (wreck me) 
 When shit gets hectic if you disrespect me 
 While you stare at my knife imma see my life 
 On the top of the mall, kid can build me right 
 You know it ain't right, but yo it's ok 
 'Cause see 
 This type of shit happens every day 
 'Cause see 
 This type of shit happens every day 
 (X-Men... Everlast) 
 You know 
 This type of shit happens every day 
 It go 
 One for the thugs 
 Two for the chickens 
 Peckerwoods stats classic like Slim Pickins 
 Cut the democrats and republicans 
 Got all your cars bouncing like a bunch of mexicans 
 Quarterrock style, I "Touch" you like Tony 
 You claim you keeping it real but still coming out phoney 
 Just one MC and four DJs 
 Give them six turntables and a mic to blaze 
 Now imma set it like Run 
 In the house of Fun 
 I burn hotter than the heat that's made by sun 
 Got a gun and a uzi 
 But it weighs a ton

 The world keeps spinning 
 X-Men keep winning
