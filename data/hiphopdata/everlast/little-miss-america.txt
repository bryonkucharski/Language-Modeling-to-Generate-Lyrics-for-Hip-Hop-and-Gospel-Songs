It's all been said, it's all been done 
 The war is over, the battle's won 
 Sour grapes, sweet revenge 
 Heaven starts right where hell ends 
 She was young, seventeen 
 She felt so soft she smelled so clean 
 Her aim was true, her heart was pure... 
 Until the day that her daddy walked out the door 
 She's lookin' for a man and so much more 
 But her Uncle Sam sent him off to war 
 And Little Miss America, in all of your glory 
 She love the paparazzi, she's tryin' to sell her story 
 She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star 
 But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar? 
 Desert sun, blazin' sand 
 Love in my heart, gun in my hand 
 Lost a leg, killed a man 
 In mortal combat, hand to hand 
 Saw men killed, watched men die 
 So many times that I can't cry 
 It's been eighteen months since I've seen home... 
 I get a purple heart, a good G.I. Loan 
 They say God blesses every child with his own 
 But we're all gonna die in the dark alone 
 And Little Miss America, in all of your glory 
 She love the paparazzi, she's tryin' to sell her story 
 She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star 
 But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar? 
 Back at home, it's kind of strange 
 Ain't nuttin' happenin', ain't nuttin' changed 
 Same old rules, same old game 
 Still I'm haunted by the names 
 Of all the friends, left behind 
 They weigh so heavy on my mind 
 At night I miss goin' out on patrol... 
 The desert went and turned my warm heart cold 
 And Little Miss America, in all of your glory 
 She love the paparazzi, she's tryin' to sell her story 
 She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star 
 But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar? 
 Where did you get the scar? 
 Where did you get the scar? 
 Where did you get the scar? 
 Where did you get the scar? 
 Where did you get the scar? 
 Where did you get the scar?
