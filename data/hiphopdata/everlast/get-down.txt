Get down, get down, get down 
 I see everybody rockin' the same old style 
 And everyone's sportin' the same profile 
 And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands 
 I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams 
 I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands 
 I rock mikes and roll bikes 
 I cross foreign lands 
 I made my bones out in zones 
 Where the twilight be 
 And every time I touch a mic 
 It's Fright Night Part Three 
 For every MC that wanna test and try 
 In your custom made wears 
 Thinkin' you too fly 
 Makin' up in gold chains 
 What you're lackin' for brains 
 It's time to call your ma, Duke 
 Scoop up your remains 
 And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed 
 Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin' 
 I'm knock knock knockin' on heaven's door 
 While every rapper that you simmed 
 Is pimped like a whore 
 You see your talk is eighteen 
 Three quarters past four 
 When your doctor slaps my ass 
 Hear the lion roar 
 The record sales soared 
 And the world got toured 
 You say what happened to my band 
 I say I just got bored 
 Now they call me Whitey Ford 
 And I say praise the Lord 
 Find me breakin' up your crews 
 Catch me singin' the blues 
 Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King 
 It's Abdul Rakim 
 Now watch me do my thing 
 Down down, you go 
 Down down, so low 
 Down down, till you hit the floor 
 Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more 
 You go point blank range 
 With the scope he's knockin' 
 The Psycho might change 
 But there ain't no stoppin' 
 The moon's on the rise 
 When the sun start droppin' 
 And y'all need to quit the bullshit you poppin' 
 'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP 
 Rock the P it's free 
 It's Abdul Rakim 
 And when referring to me 
 You best respect the name 
 Make a quick double take 
 And double check your game 
 'Cause you about to get dissed 
 I'm checkin' my list 
 When I check it over twice 
 It's like rollin' the dice 
 I hit four-five-six I'm all up in your mix 
 I rock good from Hollywood 
 To the City of Bricks 
 And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real 
 While you're makin' your deal 
 We'll be breakin' the seal 
 You be breakin' your vows 
 Like people worshippin' cows 
 And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's 
 Like Vinny Barbarino 
 Matt Gachino 
 I'm with my man Rino 
 With the Brooklyn Lordz 
 Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole 
 I take it back to the future 
 From the days of old 
 I'm too cold to hold 
 Too hot not to burn ya 
 Don't stick your nose in business that don't concern ya 
 Might have to trip 
 And flip like Ike Turner 
 You too old for schoolin', boy, when I'm gonna learn ya 
 Down down, you go 
 Down down, so low 
 Down down, till you hit the floor 
 Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more
