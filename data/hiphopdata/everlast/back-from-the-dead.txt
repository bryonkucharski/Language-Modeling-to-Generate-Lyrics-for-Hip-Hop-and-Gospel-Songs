Straight out the casket, risin' up 
 Open up your eyes, can't you see me 
 What the fuck is this, madness 
 Pick up my bones, erase my name from off the tombstones 
 Alive and kickin', breathin' the air 
 Call out my name punk and I'll be there 
 No question, my suggestion to the action 
 Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin' 
 Messin' with me, you're messin' with the best 
 Blough, you're takin' two shots to the chest 
 'Cause I'm back from the dead 
 Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead) 
 You know I'm back from the dead 
 And I'll put a friggin' hole in your head 
 Back from the dead 
 Back from the dead 
 You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected 
 Back from the dead, just to mess with your head 
 I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it 
 If you've got a cold, starve it 
 If you've got a fever, feed it 
 And if you can't feed it, then why not blow 
 You might be positive and not even know 
 I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceilin' 
 I give sexual healin', I'll get your girlie squealin' 
 Like a pig, my grave's somethin' you can never dig 
 I'll rock a mausoleum, backyard or colosseum 
 'Cause I'm back from the dead 
 Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead) 
 You know I'm back from the dead 
 House of Pain's in effect, 'nuff said 
 Skip the autopsy, 'cause I never O.D.'d 
 I only puff boom kid I never get skeemed 
 I don't sniff or shoot up, rip I'll stick my boot up 
 Your ass quick fast Everlast don't jive 
 Just like Pearl Jam, I'm still alive 
 Spreadin' like tumors, gossip and lies 
 Exaggerated reports of my demise, and if you believed'em 
 Well then you got gassed, the media deceived'em 
 Just like in the past 
 Like Steven Segal I'm hard to kill 
 And like G.G. Allen I'm crazy ill 
 I'll beat ya down with my mic 
 Kick your ass with my Nike 
 Bust ya in the eye if ya tell another lie 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 Thinkin' I'm dead you must be smokin' dust 
 Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must 
 Back from the dead
