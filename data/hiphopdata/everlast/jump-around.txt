Pack it up, pack it in 
 Let me begin 
 I came to win 
 Battle me that's a sin 
 I won't tear the sack up 
 Punk you'd better back up 
 Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up 
 Get up, stand up, come on! 
 Come on, throw your hands up 
 If you've got the feeling jump up touch the ceiling 
 Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk 
 Yo, I'll bust 'em in the eye 
 And then I'll take the punks home 
 Feel'in, funk'in 
 Amps it are junking 
 And I got more rhymes than there's cops that at a dunkin 
 Donut shop 
 Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill 
 Plus my mom and my pops 
 I came to get down (2x) 
 So get out your seats and jump around 
 Jump around (3x) 
 Jump up Jump up and get down. 
 Jump (17x) 
 I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe 
 If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho 
 Word to your moms I came to drop bombs 
 I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms 
 And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned 
 Anyone stepping on me you'll get burned 
 'Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none 
 If you come to battle bring a shotgun! 
 But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death 
 Try'in ta step to me you'll take your last breath 
 I got the skill, come get your fill 
 'Cause when I shoot ta give, I shoot to kill 
 I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top 
 I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop 
 Or better yet a terminator 
 Like Arnold Schwarzenegger 
 Try'n to play me out like as if my name was Sega 
 But I ain't going out like no punk bitch 
 Get used to one style and you know I might switch 
 It up up and around, then buck buck you down 
 Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead 
 I'm coming to get ya, coming to get ya 
 Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya 
 Jump (32x) 
 Yo, this is dedicated 
 To Joe, da flava, Dakota 
 Grag yo bozac, punk
