I knew a man with a son 
 Who bought him a gun 
 And learned Shorty just how to use it. 
 Taught him hunting and skinning 
 Right from the beginning 
 Built himself a mighty fine killer. 
 But Shorty got picked on 
 Beat on and kicked on 
 And all his classmates wanna punk him. 
 So with tears in his eye 
 He read "Catcher in the Rye" 
 And told his old man he went hunting. 
 And he felt so free 
 Like his destiny 
 Laid somewhere out on the horizon. 
 His heart went cold 
 He felt a hundred years old 
 And started pulling back on the trigger... 
 I think I'm gonna die today 
 And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay. 
 How could such a short time feel so long? 
 How could such a young life go so wrong? 
 See me 
 Hear me 
 But don't touch me 
 You should fear me. 
 Hold your life dearly 
 'Cause I'm seriously disturbed 
 That's my word. 
 Straight to my mother 
 Wayne, my brother 
 Who found another one to play soccer 
 'Cause I ain't the one 
 Who put shade in your sun 
 And took all your shine 
 Watch me get mine. 
 Feel my love burn 
 Me for my sins. 
 Watch the world turn 
 The saga begins. 
 Losses and wins 
 Angels and djinn 
 Dancin' on top 
 The head of a pin 
 Don't know where I'm going 
 But I know where I've been. 
 I can't hear a sound 
 I clapped a full round 
 I came to get down 
 I came to get dirty 
 I came to get even... 
 I think I'm gonna die today 
 And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay. 
 How could such a short time feel so long? 
 How could such a young life go so wrong? 
 I think I'm gonna die today 
 And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay. 
 How could such a short time feel so long? 
 How could such a young life go so wrong? 
 Momma, don't cry. 
 Please, momma, don't cry. 
 Momma, don't cry 
 You did nothing wrong...
