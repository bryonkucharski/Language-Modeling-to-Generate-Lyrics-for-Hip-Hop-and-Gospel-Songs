You ain't seen the things I seen 
 You don't wanna know this thing I know 
 It's like a nightmare, like a dream 
 Hear the final trumpets blow 
 Takes near everything I got 
 Seeing through the darkest spot 
 When the have-some will have none 
 Lookin' through the darkest spot 
 Who's gonna stop the comin' rain? 
 Who's gonna wash away the stain? 
 Who's gonna save the day? 
 Who's gonna light the way? 
 Who's gonna stop the comin' rain? 
 You ain't seen the things I seen 
 You don't wanna know this thing I know 
 It's like a nightmare, like a dream 
 Hear the final trumpets blow 
 You ain't seen the things I seen 
 You don't wanna know this thing I know 
 It's like a nightmare, like a dream 
 Listen to the final trumpets blow 
 Listen to the final trumpet blow 
 Listen to the final trumpet blow
