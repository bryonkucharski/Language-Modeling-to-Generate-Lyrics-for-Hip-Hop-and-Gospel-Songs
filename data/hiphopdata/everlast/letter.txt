Yeah that's her 
 Sometimes you win 
 Sometimes you lose 
 All the broken hearts 
 And the unpaid dues 
 What you did to me 
 What I did to you 
 I ain't mad at you, boo 
 So what we gonna do 
 I just seen you out with your new man 
 It's lookin' kind of happy 
 I'm feelin' like somebody just slapped me 
 My gut's in a knot 
 My temp's gettin' hot 
 I wanna make that man bleed 
 And wear this speed knot 
 'Cause he ain't got what we had 
 And it makes me kind of mad 
 I hurt my one true love 
 Just like my dad 
 And it's kinda sad 
 'Cause now my shit's together 
 No need for umbrellas 
 I can see the stormy weather 
 I'm goin' outside into the rain 
 Like Keith Sweat 
 'Cause I can't house this pain 
 We was workin' for years 
 Now I'm jerkin' these tears 
 From my lips to God's ears, girl 
 I did you wrong 
 So I'm makin' this song 
 To let you know how I feel 
 Before I'm keepin' it real 
 May keep my heart concealed 
 And now I'm on the side 
 Just patiently waitin' 
 Watchin' on you when the time for updatin'I can't hide from the 
 Truth 
 I know the puddin's in the proof 
 So I stand convicted like all your friends predicted 
 But I'd think you'd be surprised 
 On how this ends brothers 
 We went from lovers to friends 
 We'll go from friends to lovers 
 So if that man make you smile 
 I guess that I'll 
 Just accept it 
 And respect it 
 I'll hit you with this song 
 And let you think about it 
 Then I'll just leave you alone 
 And be a man about it.
