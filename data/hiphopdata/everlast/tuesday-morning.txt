I was too busy counting all my zeros 
 Never really thought too much about heroes 
 Never really thought too much about anyone but me 
 Never really opened my eyes wide enough so that I could see 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 We're only separated by a few degrees 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Never really thought too much about tomorrow, 
 Never really dealt very well with sorrow 
 Tired of living my life like a feather floating on the breeze 
 Trying to find me a good woman that can bring me down to my knee 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 We're only separated by a few degrees 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 I think I've always tried to do the right the right thing, 
 I've been a little to scared to ride the lightening 
 Tired of living my days surrounded by all these fears 
 Still stuck in my ways haven't changed after all these years 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 We're only separated by a few degrees 
 I'm just like you, you're just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me
