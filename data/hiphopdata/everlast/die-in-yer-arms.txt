Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight 
 Really don't care 'bout the wrong or right 
 The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe 
 Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite 
 Baby girl looks so good, she walks so mean 
 Got a vicious little sway, I think she's semi-obscene 
 She'll pick ya bones clean, oh my God, she's so fine 
 She sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine 
 I'm a picker, I'm a squeezer, I'm-a make me some wine 
 I'm a drinker 'til I'm crazy, I'm-a drink 'til I'm blind 
 I'm-a touch her so good 
 I'm-a treat her so fine 
 I'm-a make love to her soul 
 I'm gonna fuck 'er with her mind 
 I'm gonna die in yer arms tonight 
 I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right 
 The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe 
 Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite 
 Baby girl acts so proper, like daddy's little daughter 
 A wolf in sheep's clothing leading lambs out to the slaughter 
 She's lookin' so young, she's smellin' so pretty 
 She's a junkie on a binge, and her drug is the city 
 She's a vicious little biddy 
 Attitude is shitty 
 An' if I get my way, she pro'ly gonna come home with me 
 Talkin' good for nothin' 
 Eyes were made for cryin' 
 Bombs were made for droppin' 
 Girl, yer arms are made for dyin' 
 I'm-a die in yer arms tonight 
 I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right 
 The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe 
 Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite 
 I'm-a die in yer arms tonight 
 I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right 
 The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe 
 Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite 
 Die in yer arms tonight 
 Care 'bout the wrong or right 
 Forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe 
 Pick me some and take me a bite
