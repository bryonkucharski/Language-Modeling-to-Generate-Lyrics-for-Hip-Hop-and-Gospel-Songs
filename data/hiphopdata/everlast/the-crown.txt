With a soft underbelly 
 And a hardened heart 
 They say you've got to be tough 
 If you ain't that smart 
 I'm sitting here alone 
 Waiting for my phone to ring 
 Run out of time 
 Run out of hope 
 The boys on the corner never run out of dope 
 I keep myself high 
 So I can keep doing my thing 
 They say "Stupid is as stupid does 
 And everything's the same as it ever was" 
 I drink myself blind 
 Trying to find a new song to sing 
 Time is money, 
 And money talks 
 Bartender, pour me one more whiskey on the rocks 
 While I try to understand 
 Why every man wants to be king 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown) 
 Everybody kicks you when you're down 
 (When you're down) 
 Laugh for now; later you can frown 
 (You can frown) 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown) 
 With a sweet disposition 
 And an iron will 
 A couple nice cars 
 And a house on a hill 
 My back account's full 
 But my soul is still empty and cold 
 All the money and the clothes 
 And the sold out shows 
 Don't mean a damn thing when nobody knows you 
 And your home is just a house 
 When you're sitting there alone and you're old 
 I heard love is a game 
 I heard love is a rock 
 And I heard love is a house on a dead end block 
 But the ending keeps changing every time that the story gets told 
 Some pray for money 
 Some pray for rain 
 And some are just praying for relief from the pain 
 But some of us will buy 
 Just about anything we can be sold 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown) 
 Everybody kicks you when you're down 
 (When you're down) 
 Laugh for now; later you can frown 
 (You can frown) 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown) 
 I'm a mean old dog 
 Got a big old gun 
 I'm a proud new papa 
 I'm an only son 
 I'm a beggar 
 I'm a thief 
 I'm a liar and a cheater too 
 I've been around the block 
 I've been around the sun 
 I've been up 
 I've been down 
 I've been over and done 
 I've seen the bottom of the pile 
 And the mountain top 
 Either will do 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown) 
 Everybody kicks you when you're down 
 (When you're down) 
 Laugh for now; later you can frown 
 (You can frown) 
 Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 (Wears the crown)
