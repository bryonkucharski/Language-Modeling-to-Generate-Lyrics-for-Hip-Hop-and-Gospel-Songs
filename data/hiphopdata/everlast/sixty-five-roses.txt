It's been a bit of a while since I seen you smile 
 It's been too long baby what went wrong 
 Tell me how it got spoilt 
 Tell me when it went bad 
 How to get back to the times that we had 
 We were both young 
 And our spirits were bold 
 Now we're just angry and we act like we're old 
 We can't even talk it out without one of us walking away 
 You were 18 I just turned 29 
 I was fresh out the coffin 
 Girl you were so fine 
 The future was bright 
 The world, it seemed new 
 I was with some other woman 
 I was thinking of you 
 I know how it hurts 
 I know how it feels 
 I know it how aches 
 Cause the heart never heals 
 We're so busy screaming that we don't hear the words that we say 
 Taking out lumps 
 Took a few blows 
 Hit a few bumps 
 Had our fair share of woes 
 We tried to see good 
 Through all of the bad 
 Put on our smiles 
 Pretend we're not sad 
 Gotta be tough 
 Gotta be strong 
 Gotta be right 
 Can't afford to be wrong 
 It's hard to sing the blues 
 When you're hearing bad news everyday 
 We worry too much for one couple to bear 
 Hunger so much for one person to care 
 Fooling our family 
 We're fooling our friends 
 Pray that the pain and the frustration ends 
 Hope is a chance 
 Hope is a dream 
 Hope is a drug 
 Maybe hope's a vaccine 
 In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray 
 Shout at the devil 
 I curse the lord 
 Offer them everything I can afford 
 I'd sell out my soul 
 I'd lie and deceive 
 Tried to be righteous 
 Tried to believe 
 Prayed every prayer 
 Kicked all of my highs 
 For hours I'd stare at those beautiful eyes 
 All of my problems seem to be melting away 
 The smile on her face says daddy everything is okay 
 In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray
