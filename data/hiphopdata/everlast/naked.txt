Blue sky, devil eye 
 Cyanide, suicide 
 Double down, let it ride 
 Lose your money 
 Bruise your pride 
 Easy come, easy went 
 Ghetto slums tenements 
 Things look real, Old Testament 
 Blame it all on the president 
 The emperor's got brand new clothes 
 And everybody but him knows he's naked 
 But you don't say a word 
 The emperor's got brand new jewels 
 Wake up soon you silly fools 
 He's naked 
 But you don't say a word 
 The rich they get richer 
 The poor they get poorer 
 While liberty stands naked screaming in horror 
 The emperor raped her but we just ignore her 
 The rich they get richer 
 The poor they get poorer 
 Euthanize, youth will rise 
 Scrutinize, truth from lies 
 Time to revolutionize 
 Organize, weaponise 
 Easy come easy go 
 Think I'm movin' just a little bit too slow 
 Got front row tickets to the big freak show 
 Wait for the whole freakin' thing to blow 
 Homicide, genocide 
 Victimize paralyze empathize and analyze 
 Compromise and vandalize 
 Easy come, hard to take 
 Wide awake the original fake 
 Find the heart 
 Drive the stake 
 Wait for the whole freakin' thing to break
