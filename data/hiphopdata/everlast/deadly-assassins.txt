Everlast 
 What? You think it can't happen? 
 Soul Assassins 2000! 
 Word! Goes somethin' like this 
 On a vision quest fresh best error terror 
 Krush Groovin' like a low budget movie 
 I'm Wild Style like Lee Quinones 
 Stop ridin' on my cajones 
 I talk with a speak that's much unique 
 While you desperately seek for that Susie freak 
 Yo, word to Rob One. He used to like the big ladies 
 My name's Everlast, I started back in the 80s 
 Like (whoosh sound) all up your nostril 
 Actin' hostile, 13th apostle 
 Goin' postal, Holy Ghost know 
 Why you walkin' on a hostroll, actin' bicoastal 
 Bitch! Try to play the middle, 
 Snitch wind up in the hospital 
 Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle 
 Put your money in the middle, get broke like coal 
 B-Real 
 Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall 
 I'm Real 
 Everlast 
 I'm Everlast, and I'm takin' 'em all 
 B-Real 
 Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape 
 Both 
 Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate 
 B-Real 
 I'll spit out the fire, you won't know what hit 
 Watch me place you out quicker than the joint gets lit 
 I got tears in this shit, what do you got? A couple? 
 Think you got a hustle, what d'you want, trouble? 
 Lookin' at the two who go back like Chuck's (Everlast: Way back) 
 With the hand on the pump by the big black trucks (Everlast: Fools) 
 You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels 
 The strange ho's want a piece, look at these lame ho's 
 I stain those, with hot blood and chain flows 
 And main foes who want to rock this ain't closed 
 They use the same clothes these unoriginal niggas 
 Ah, my son, if any one of them wanna run (Everlast: Come on, motherfucker) 
 You get chastised and baptized in blood 
 Where the gat lies don't matter, you're scattered in mud 
 You ungrateful, most hateful, leech niggas 
 Wallow in your misery, I'm outta reach, niggas 
 Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall 
 I'm Real 
 Everlast 
 I'm Everlast, and I'm ready to brawl 
 B-Real 
 Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape 
 Both 
 Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate 
 B-Real 
 Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall 
 I'm Real 
 Everlast 
 I'm Everlast, and I'm takin' 'em all 
 B-Real 
 Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape 
 Both 
 Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate 
 (Everlasting) 
 (The round one)
