Make you go 
 Soul for soul over mic control 
 Kid you can't touch me with a ten foot pole 
 And I even made the devil sell me his jewels 
 He was out to cold mock me 
 And play you for fools 
 Kid, you know the rules must be smokin' super cools 
 Try to diss me on the low got to be a psycho 
 That's aight though 
 You know you won't see me shakin' 
 I'm out to blow the spot on who's real and who's fakin' 
 Who's givin', who's takin', who's livin', who's starvin' 
 Diss me on the mic it's time for headstone carvin' 
 And then tap right ya, 
 I'll strike ya like lightin' 
 Dissolve ya like powder 
 So turn it up louder 
 Go on pump the wattage 
 Get the cheese by cottage 
 I like mean streaks 
 I like Spanish freaks 
 I like Korean barbecue 
 I'm like old school beats 
 But... 
 I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin' 
 And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin' 
 And all the wack attitudes people coppin' 
 I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin' 
 It go bang bang boogie 
 I'm sick like a loogie 
 I'm wiser than bud 
 I'm thicker than blood 
 I'm older than time 
 I'm only from divine 
 How can you be so bold and think that you'll take mine 
 I'm cash like Johnny it's the highway man 
 And I'm walkin' this line the best way I can 
 With my farmer's tan and my bloodshot eyes 
 I ain't bodied no one 
 I ain't chopped no bod 
 With the butter's from the gutters 
 I'm about to explode 
 And blow the spot for folk nave up the Gun Hill Road 
 Like artillery shells 
 Been from heaven to hell 
 And I'm a say a little prayer for every rapper that fell 
 'Cause...
