You know it's Whitey 
 And the Likwits 
 I say it's Whitey 
 And the Likwits 
 You know it's Whitey 
 And the Likwits 
 Watch me rock these sounds 
 From the polo grounds 
 To the sunset strip 
 Like a nasty trip 
 I'll flash it back on ya 
 Run it up on ya 
 I'm born in Hempstead 
 And live raised in California 
 Mr. Entreprenuer 
 I rock the shot that's sure 
 I need a dime plus more 
 I sip the fine liquor 
 I want the cash in hand 
 And the beach front land 
 And I get loco 
 From Acolpoco to Japan 
 Mr. Whitey Ford gets terrain explored 
 You perpetrate that Ford 
 You must be out of your gourd 
 It's time to make like Greg Nice, kid 
 And praise the Lord 
 Keep the faith 
 Smoke an eighth 
 Until you stack the papers all up in my safe 
 Commence the motivate 
 Consume an altered state 
 I'm killin' your whole wack show 
 Like I'm Edgar Allan Poe 
 With the psychotic thriller 
 No peckerwood iller 
 Than this freckled-face man 
 With the farmer's tan 
 If I can't bomb on you 
 I'm bombin' on your man 
 Some get the shit, sugar, some get the stains 
 Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains 
 Some get the powers, love, some get the papers 
 Some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors 
 Better... 
 Praise the Lord, keep the faith (4x) 
 I say roll to the rock 
 Rock to the roll 
 Whitey Ford brings the devastatin' mic control 
 Like Derryl McDaniel 
 A hundred G's annual 
 The tip's get clocked, baby 
 The bond's get stocked 
 My style gets rocked 
 Just like doors get knocked 
 With legendary status 
 Like my name's Lou Brock 
 And my lazairre sounds 
 Be shakin' the grounds 
 Huntin' down crews 
 Like packs of bloodhounds 
 Snatchin' off crowns 
 And meltin' 'em down 
 I once was lost, see 
 But now I'm found 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet's the sound 
 And when the saints come marchin' in (keep the faith) 
 I'm Nestle's Alpine White / Classic rapper's delight 
 All these shorties pullin' tools 
 'Cause they know they can't fight 
 I bank my selections on worldwide connections 
 So get the seven digits, baby 
 Never burn your britches
