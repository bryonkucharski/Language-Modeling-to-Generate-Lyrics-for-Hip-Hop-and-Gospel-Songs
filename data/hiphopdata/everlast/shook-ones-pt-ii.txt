(Everlast) 
 To all the killers and a hundred dollar billas 
 For real dealers who ain't got no feelings 
 Check it out now 
 I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous 
 You heard of us 
 Official White folks murderers 
 My mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware 
 Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share 
 For all of those who wanna profile and pose 
 Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nosebone 
 You all alone in these streets, cousin 
 Every man for their self in this land we be gunnin' 
 And keep them shook crews runnin' 
 Like they supposed to 
 They come around but they never come close to 
 I can see it inside your face 
 You're in the wrong place 
 Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up 
 With bullet holes and such 
 Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched 
 You can put your whole army against my team and 
 I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin' 
 Your simple words just don't move me 
 You're minor, we're major 
 You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player 
 Don't make me have to call your name out 
 Your crew is featherweight 
 My gunshots'll make you levitate 
 I'm only nineteen but my mind is old 
 And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold 
 Another figga deceased, another story gets told 
 It ain't nothin' really 
 Hey, yo dun spark the Phillie 
 So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas 
 Why they still alive I don't know, go figure 
 Meanwhile back in L.A the foundation 
 If I die I couldn't choose a better location 
 When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation 
 Getting closer to God in a tight situation 
 Now, take these words home and think it through 
 Or the next rhyme I write might be about you 
 Son, they shook... 
 There ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death, scared to look 
 They shook 
 There ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death, scared to look 
 Livin' the live with the diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds 
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones 
 You ain't a crook son, you just a shook one 
 There's a war going on outside 
 No man is safe from 
 You can run but you can't hide forever 
 In these streets that we done took 
 You walking with your head down scared to look 
 You shook cause there anit no such thing as half way crooks 
 There never around when the beef cooks 
 And my part of town is similar to Vietum 
 Now we all grown up and hold heavy on the cops control 
 You better have the right gear get ready 
 Tryin' back me and get rock steady 
 By the mac one double I'll touch you 
 Leave you with not much to go home with 
 My skin is thick 
 'Cause I be up in the mix of action 
 If I'm not at home puffin lie relaxin 
 I lay got a nigga depress 
 So I wear a stuff (?) underneath my gest 
 In the life filled with diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds 
 But some get shot, lock-down, and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts say straight up shook ones 
 You shook 
 There ain't no things as half way crooks 
 (You ani't a crook son) 
 You sarced to death you scared to look you shook 
 (You just a shook one) 
 There ain't no things as half way crooks 
 (You ani't a crook son) 
 You scared to death you sacred to look you shook 
 (You just a shook one) 
 There ain't no such things as half way crooks 
 You scared to death you scared to look you shook 
 There ain't no such things as half way crooks 
 You scared to death you scared to look you shook 
 You ain't a crook son 
 You just a shook one 
 You ani't a crook son
