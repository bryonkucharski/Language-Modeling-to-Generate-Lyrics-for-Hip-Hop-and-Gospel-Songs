I just can't do it, not anymore 
 Every time I fake a smile I feel just like a whore 
 I just can't do it, it's beyond my means 
 And all I know about love reading fashion magazines 
 I just can't do it, it can't be done 
 That's just what I say 'cause I know I'm not the one 
 And I've been moving for so long 
 Life's a million miles away 
 I'm the one that made you strong girl 
 But I could not make you stay 
 I just can't do it, it's much too hard, 
 I drive around alone at night up and down the boulevard 
 I just can't do it, I feel so old 
 It looks like the sun is shining but the wind's blowing cold 
 I just can't do it, it's gone too far 
 I sit at home alone at night just wondering where you are 
 And I've been standing still so long 
 My minds a million miles away 
 I'm the one that made you strong girl 
 But I could not make you stay 
 I just can't do it, no matter how hard I try 
 You don't come around anymore but I know the reason why 
 I just can't do it, it's way too late 
 I hang on with all my might I can't accept this fate 
 I just can't do it, I feel so bad 
 I sit around and think about the chances that I've had 
 And I've been hurting for so long 
 You're a million miles away 
 I'm the one that made you strong girl 
 But I could not make you stay 
 But I could not make you stay 
 No, I could not make you stay
