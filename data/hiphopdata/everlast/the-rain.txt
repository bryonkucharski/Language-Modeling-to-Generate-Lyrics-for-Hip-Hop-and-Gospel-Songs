Every man's bound to fall 
 Every man's bound to fall 
 Pain inside my heart 
 Trouble stay on my mind 
 Everything falls apart 
 (It's) happenin' all the time 
 Livin' by Murphy's Law 
 Tryin' to have it all 
 Running from instant karma 
 Every man's bound to fall 
 Life is short, the grind is long 
 Some of my very best friends are gone 
 My hustle's strong my money's all spent 
 On buying bitches titties and drugs and rent 
 Work a double shift grind, I can't save a dime 
 My daughter needs medicine I just can't afford 
 Bout to grab a .9, lose my mind 
 My insurance keeps sayin' that they won't pay for it 
 I'll stage the heist, I'll pay the price 
 Don't be shocked when I turn to crime, kid 
 I'm goin' big, I might split your wig 
 'Cause I ain't getting knocked for no nickel'n'dime shit 
 All that glitters ain't all it seems 
 The American dream is an American scheme 
 What you're looking at, what you're trippin' on 
 Who you flippin' on, see what I'm grippin' on 
 Pain inside my heart 
 Trouble stay on my mind 
 Everything falls apart 
 (It's) happenin' all the time 
 Livin' by Murphy's Law 
 Tryin' to have it all 
 Running from instant karma 
 Every man's bound to fall 
 I've been breakin' my neck just to live correct 
 Keep my head above water, living check to check 
 I get no respect, I got no regard 
 Patience is a struggle when times is hard 
 Paper's in the shortage, tryin' to pay the mortgage 
 I can't get to work, they repossess my car 
 Bout to buy a pistol and kidnap Bristol 
 Tell me bitch, can you see me from your backyard? 
 This New World session of the Great Depression 
 I'm living off preemptive unchecked aggression 
 You're cryin' and you're bitchin', know it every politician: 
 My family tradition is heavy ammunition 
 I cock the hammer, I'ma rock the vote 
 Got your forehead on lock, dead in my scope 
 Look me in the eye, what you're lying for 
 What you're living by, what you dyin' for 
 Pain inside my heart 
 Trouble stay on my mind 
 Everything falls apart 
 (It's) happenin' all the time 
 Livin' by Murphy's Law 
 Tryin' to have it all 
 Running from instant karma 
 Every man's bound to fall
