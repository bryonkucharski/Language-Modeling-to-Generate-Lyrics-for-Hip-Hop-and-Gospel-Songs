Everybody meets their maker 
 Everyone, they feel the fire 
 Everybody's on the takin' 
 Everyone's a fuckin' liar 
 Everyone's another suspect 
 Everybody's on the run 
 Everybody feels the boxin' 
 Everyone respects the gun 
 Everybody's got each other 
 Everyone is on their own 
 Everywhere is overcrowded 
 Everybody is all alone 
 Everyone they need somebody 
 Everybody needs someone 
 Everybody feels the boxin' 
 Everyone respects the gun 
 Everybody is a winner 
 Everyone done lost their mind 
 Everybody is just a sinner 
 Every day is borrowed time 
 Everyone's another suspect 
 Everybody's on the run 
 Everybody feels the boxin' 
 Everyone respects the gun 
 Everyone respects the gun
