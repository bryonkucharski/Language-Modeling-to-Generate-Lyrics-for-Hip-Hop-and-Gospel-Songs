It's been seven years down the road 
 I got no more tears that me left to flow 
 When I did my baby wrong 
 That she left me lonely for so long 
 Now I'm out here all alone 
 Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
 Lord won't you please... bring my baby home 
 Lord won't you please bring my baby home 
 It go one for the treble 
 Two for the bass 
 Used to mess with this girl 
 Way back in the day 
 She was from the PJ's 
 And she went both ways 
 Yeah, the girl was a freak 
 I used to call her Monique 
 And before I even speak 
 About knockin' the boots 
 I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits 
 So now we gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty 
 She brought her friend around 
 And damn she was pretty 
 Betty was twisted 
 She said her number was listed 
 They grabbed my love two fisted 
 Hugged it and kissed it 
 They say one in the hand 
 Is worth two in the bush 
 But when shove came to push 
 Yo, I had my own theories 
 World Series of love 
 It's two on one 
 Till I got caught with the smokin' gun 
 His wife came home 
 And she bursted in 
 Now I'm lookin' for my heart 
 Like I'm made from tin 
 The road that I travel 
 Ain't got yellow bricks 
 My old woman jinxed 
 That all men are pricks 
 And she flipped the script 
 She's puttin' lip to lip 
 And every time I think about it I just lose my grip 
 'Cause I've been up 
 And I've been down 
 And I've been fast 
 And I've been slow 
 And I've been square 
 And I've been round 
 And I've been high 
 And I've been low 
 And I've been cool 
 And I've been calm 
 And I've been kind 
 And I've been crass 
 I held the whole world right in my palm 
 I tried to spread it around 
 But it sure went fast 
 Seven years sure have flown by 
 I got no more tears that me left to cry 
 When I did my sugar bad 
 I lost the best thing I ever had 
 And now I'm out here on my own 
 Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
 Bring my baby home...
