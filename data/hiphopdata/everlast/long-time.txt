She was a hot-blooded women, he never saw it comin' 
 She hit him from the side that's blind 
 She never gave a warning, he woke up in the mornin' 
 Layin' there next to his pride 
 He got a little crazy when she had a little baby 
 Cause it filled him with a fatherly pride 
 But a couple years later when their love started fadin' 
 He hurt so bad he nearly died 
 It's been a long time, since I was faithful 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 She's a mother with a daughter, sittin' by the water 
 'Cause it's better for her baby to breathe 
 She got a man that's in prison 'cause he didn't wanna listen 
 Now he's sittin' waitin' on a reprieve 
 And she loves her lil' baby but she get a lil' crazy 
 'Cause it's harder than she ever conceived 
 He left her on her own, but she's doin' it alone 
 'Cause she loves him like he wouldn't believe 
 It's been a long time, since I was faithful 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 He's a friend and a lover, husband and a brother 
 He's always been a prodigal son 
 He gets a lot of drama when he go to see his momma 
 'Cause he curses like a son of a gun 
 He's beggin' to his lady, let him see his baby 
 He swears that she's the only one 
 He's got a heart full of sorrow, he's livin' for tomorrow 
 And he's sorry for the damage he's done 
 It's been a long time, since I was faithful 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 It's been a long time, since I was faithful 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful 
 It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye 
 It's been a long time, since I was grateful
