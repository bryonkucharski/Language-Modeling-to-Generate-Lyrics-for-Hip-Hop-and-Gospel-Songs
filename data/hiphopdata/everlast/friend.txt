There's a sickness in my soul 
 And I don't know but I been told it's uncurable 
 There's a darkness in my heart, slowly tearin' me apart 
 It's unbearable 
 Drop of blood, a lake of tears 
 And baby after all these years your still beautiful 
 And I've been loved and I've been used 
 Cut wide open, scarred and bruised 
 I'm unbreakable 
 Flesh it heals I know 
 Hearts they never mend 
 Lover's come and go girl right now I need a Friend 
 Walk for miles, talk for days 
 And I keep trying to change my ways 
 It's so difficult 
 You kick and scream 
 You curse and yell 
 Tell me I should go to hell 
 It's so typical 
 Touch my heart, feel my pain 
 Let me know I'm not insane 
 You're so merciful 
 Break your heart 
 I cheat, I lie 
 And honestly I don't know why I'm so pitiful 
 Flesh it heals I know 
 Hearts they never mend 
 Lover's come and go girl right now I need a friend... yeah 
 There's a sickness in my soul 
 And I don't know but I been told it's uncurable 
 There's darkness in my heart, that's slowly tearin' me apart 
 It's unbearable... yeah 
 Flesh it heals I know 
 Hearts they never mend 
 Lovers come and go girl right now I need a friend... yeah 
 Right now I need a friend 
 There's a sickness in my soul 
 And I don't know but I been told it's uncurable
