Here we are, my friend. 
 Once again 
 I'm inclined to rhyme one time. 
 So won't you lend me your ear? 
 'Cause it's clear 
 That this here has no pain 
 If this song was the blues you'd be sheddin a tear 
 Like a baby 
 Maybe 
 Is shoulda held back. 
 Some of you look shocked 
 I guess you couldn't tell that 
 I was here to drop knowledge 
 College is irrelevant 
 My next move, 
 To prove I'm smooth but still intelligent 
 Expressing 
 Lessons with sheer precision 
 First hear me out then make a decision 
 On whether Everlast knows what time it is. 
 Does this song belong in the rhyming biz? 
 Yes, I think so, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 Blazing the trail across a new frontier. 
 I'm growing lengths of growing strength as I get older. 
 'Cause I'm a syndicate soldier. 
 All affections left behind, 
 There's two more gears to grind. 
 Before I'm through, 
 I'm sure that you will find 
 A new respect for the rhymes I inject. 
 Through your eardrum, 
 Don't play dumb 
 Just let me get to the point of my address 
 Unless you feel you can't go. 
 This song is on the tables to make you dance, so 
 Get up, and if you don't, leave the premises 
 I'm Rula-Ku so you can call me a genesis. 
 Born to perform and please a large crowd 
 Of people at night and to my right is El-o 
 The scale is brother, 
 Known for being treacherous 
 A sucker made a move and that's the reason 
 Fletcher was forced to put his head out 
 He got too close to me, 
 Two by my side 
 And that's that's how it's supposed to be. 
 These are my brothers, 
 And they've been around me 
 Since back in the days when the Syndicate found me. 
 They are the people deserving of credit. 
 List my name, gained fame, and made sure I wouldn't let it 
 Go to my head 
 Instead 
 I keep my feet down 
 Unlike sucker's from the past I beat down. 
 The fatal mistake was to break on my confidence 
 Overall, their fall was due to overconfidence. 
 As we go, the ego's 
 All start acting up 
 With statements 
 Of greatness, the rhymes aren't backing up. 
 Talking louder as they get bolder, 
 But there's no defense 
 Against a syndicate soldier. 
 As we reach the final stage, 
 Something got engaged, 
 In a conflict, 
 That's sick with violent rage. 
 I gained fame, 
 From my name, Everlast. 
 How long can this hype about a devil last? 
 A star was formed, but everyone took it serious. 
 Now it's seems, I'm seen as delirious. 
 That's okay, I'll stay under rated. 
 And good things will come to all who have waited. 
 For the brother of a lighter skin to begin 
 Droppin' knowledge with weight, 
 'Cause you rate paper thins. 
 Science is one thing, knowledge is another. 
 What do I mean when I say that I'm a brother? 
 Being a brother is a state of mind 
 For all those who chose to remain unblind. 
 Growing wisdom as I get older. 
 That's right I'm white and I'm a syndicate soldier
