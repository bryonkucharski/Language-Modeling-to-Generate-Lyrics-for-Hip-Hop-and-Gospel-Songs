Blues for X'Mas 
 Baby, I ain't got a dime 
 Blues for X'Mas 
 Baby, I ain't got a feakin' dime 
 I'm just ain't and they're wasted 
 I hang my head down baby 
 I'm cryin' 
 Baby, I'm cryin' 
 Santa Clause 
 Bring my Baby back on home 
 See, I ain't got a lot of money 
 But my baby she's rich enough for us both 
 Blues for X'Mas 
 I'm as blue as I can be 
 Blues for X'Mas 
 Baby, I'm as blue as I can be 
 I'm just in here dinkin' 
 Tryin' to drink my Baby back to me 
 Tryin' to drink my Baby back 
 Santa Clause 
 Bring my Baby back on home 
 Blues for X'Mas 
 Ain't no time to be home all alone 
 I can't lose these X'Mas Blues 
 Baby, I just can't seem to shake off 
 Held so many arms 
 All I seem to do is break 'em 
 Yeah, break 'em 
 I said I break 'em, Baby
