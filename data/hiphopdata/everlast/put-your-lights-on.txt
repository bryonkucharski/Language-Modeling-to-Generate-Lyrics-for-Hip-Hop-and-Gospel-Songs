Hey now, all you sinners 
 Put your lights on 
 Put your lights on 
 Hey now, all you lovers 
 Put your lights on 
 Put your lights on 
 Hey now, all you killers 
 Put your lights on 
 Put your lights on 
 Hey now, all you children 
 Leave your lights on 
 You better leave your lights on 
 'Cause there's a monster 
 Livin' under my bed 
 Whisperin' in my ear 
 And there's an angel 
 With her hand on my head 
 She say I got nothing to fear 
 There's a darkness 
 Livin' deep in my soul 
 Still got a purpose to serve 
 So let your light shine 
 Deep into my hole 
 'N God don't let me loose my nerves 
 Don't let me loose my nerves 
 Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now 
 U-oho, hey now 
 Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now 
 Hey now, all you sinners 
 Put your lights on 
 Put your lights on 
 Hey now, all you children 
 Leave your lights on 
 You better leave your lights on 
 'Cause there's a monster 
 Livin' under my bed 
 Whisperin' in my ear 
 And there's an angel 
 With her hand on my head 
 She say I got nothing to fear 
 She say 
 La ilaha il allah 
 You gonna shine like star 
 La ilaha il allah 
 You gonna shine like star 
 Let me fade away...
