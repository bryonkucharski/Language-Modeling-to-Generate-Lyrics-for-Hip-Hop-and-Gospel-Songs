Please, please, please don't 
 Leave me now, girl 
 After all I've done for you 
 On my knees here 
 Let's work it out, woman 
 After all that we've been through 
 I told you that Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone suffers and everyone cries 
 Old people laugh, young people try 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone hustles and everyone strives 
 Bad people win, good people die 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Hush your mouth, girl 
 And settle down, woman 
 'Cause you don't make no sense 
 Make up your mind, girl 
 And come around now 
 Come down from off that fence 
 Don't you know everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone suffers and everyone cries 
 Old people laugh, young people try 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone hustles and everyone strives 
 Bad people win, good people die 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Watch your temper, girl 
 And calm your nerves down 
 Better watch how you react 
 Put your hands down 
 And back up off me, woman 
 'Cause you might get touched back 
 I told you that everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone suffers and everyone cries 
 Old people laugh and young people try 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone hustles and everyone strives 
 Bad people win, good people die 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone suffers and everyone cries 
 Old people laugh and young people try 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
 Everyone hustles and everyone strives 
 Bad people win, good people die 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
 When they look in your eyes 
 When they look in your eyes 
 Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes
