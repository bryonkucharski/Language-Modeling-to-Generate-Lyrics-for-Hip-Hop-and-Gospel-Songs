She smelled like flowers, she taste like toffee 
 She kissed me slowly, she held me soflty 
 Got too close and she backed up off me 
 Left me stone cold sober just like black coffee 
 Just like black coffee 
 She told me that she'd always be thinkin' of me 
 She said she wanted me to know that she really did love me 
 She said she'd never put no one else above me 
 Except her monkey, she's like a junky 
 Just like a junky 
 Just like a junky 
 Its April 25th its up around 80 
 Found a spot out in the park where the grass was shady 
 She said her mom's from Jamaica, Said her father's from Haiti 
 Such a pretty lady, she's such a lady 
 She smelled like flowers, she taste like toffee 
 She kissed me slowly, she held me softly 
 Got to close and she backed up off me 
 She left me stone cold sober just like black coffee 
 Just like black coffee (x3)
