Yesterday, just a dream I don't remember 
 Tomorrow, still a hope I've yet to endure 
 I'm out of time 
 I'm out of rhyme 
 I'm out of reason 
 Season's change and leave me out in the cold 
 The story's old 
 The tale been told by many scholars 
 Got a fistful of dollar 
 And a pocketful of love 
 God above if you hear me cryin' 
 I've tried to sell my soul 
 But no one's buyin' 
 Lord, strike me down now if I'm lyin' 
 It's gettin' cold 
 It's time for dyin'. 
 Come on and watch me shine 
 Like the world is mine (check it out) today 
 Come on and watch me shine (check it out) 
 Like the world is mine today 
 Watch me shine (check it out) 
 Let the man who's free from sin 
 Cast the first stone and begin the violence 
 Let the man whose words ring true 
 Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence 
 Let the ones who lose their way 
 Live to see just one more day in the sunshine 
 Let the ones who choose to stray 
 Recognize the price they'll pay 
 In their lifetime 
 Come on and watch me shine 
 Like the world is mine (check it out) today 
 Come on and watch me shine (check it out) 
 Like the world is mine today 
 Watch me shine (check it out) 
 Sittin' here waitin' for my roads to cross 
 You nail me down and you watch me bleed 
 So lay my head against the earth 
 Plant my body like a seed 
 You can't always get the things you want, love (check it out) 
 You get what you deserve 
 Or maybe what you need 
 So fill my hole with precious dirt, love 
 Till the soil and part the weed 
 Come on and watch me shine 
 Like the world is mine (check it out) today 
 Come on and watch me shine (check it out) 
 Like the world is mine today 
 Watch me shine (check it out)
