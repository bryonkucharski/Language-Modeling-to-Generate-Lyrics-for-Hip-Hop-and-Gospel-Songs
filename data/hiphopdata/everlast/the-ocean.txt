There's a house up on the hill 
 Where you can just make out the ocean 
 There's a women there waiting for your hard work 
 All and every breath she takes is like artwork 
 And I think that I can just about touch the ocean. 
 There's 1500 miles between me and my next real smile 
 I think I can just about smell the ocean 
 I'm full of unquestionable devotion, 
 But I think I put a terrible thing in motion 
 The ocean... 
 There's a house up on the hill 
 Where the air smells like the sea 
 I left my heart up there, rusting inside the salty air 
 I tried to make it home but I lost the key 
 It's been 600 days since I laid eyes on your gorgeous face 
 I'm trying to make it home but I lost the key 
 I'm waiting for the lord to set me free 
 I'm wishing that you were standing here right next to me 
 There's a house up on the hill (the ocean) 
 Where you can just make out the ocean 
 There's a house up on the hill 
 It used to feel like home 
 There's a house up on the hill 
 Where the air smells like the sea (the ocean) 
 There's a house up on the hill...
