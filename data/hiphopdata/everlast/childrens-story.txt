 Uncle Whitey, Uncle Whitey, can you tell us a bedtime story? 
 Yeah, we want some bedtimes stories...(Please!) 
 (Everlast) 
 Once upon a time not long ago, 
 When people wore pajamas and lived life slow 
 When laws were stern and justice stood, 
 And people were behavin' like they our too good 
 There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy 
 And this is what he said 
 "Me and you, Guy, we gonna make sum cash, 
 Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash" 
 They did the job, money came with ease, 
 But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease 
 He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother 
 Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover, 
 The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic, 
 He said, "keep still, boy, no need for static", 
 Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap 
 But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped, 
 The kid pulled out a gun 
 He said, "Why'd you hit me?", 
 The barrel headed straight for the cop kidney 
 The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure, 
 "I'll do years if I pull this trigger" 
 So he cold dashed, ran around the block, 
 Cop radios in to another lady cop 
 He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister, 
 A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her 
 Looked around good and from expectations, 
 So he decided he'd head for the subway stations 
 But she was coming so he made a left, 
 He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath 
 Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him, 
 Then he made his move to an abandoned building 
 Ran up the stairs up to the top floor, 
 Opened up the door there, guess who he saw 
 Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope, 
 Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap, 
 He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run", 
 The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun 
 He went outside but there was cops all over, 
 Then he dipped into a car, was a stolen Nova 
 Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university, 
 Escaped alive though the car was battered, 
 Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered 
 Ran out of bullets but still had static, 
 Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic 
 Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead 
 He told the cops, "back off or honey here's dead", 
 Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong 
 So he let the lady go and he starts to move on, 
 Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded 
 Before long the lil' boy got surrounded, 
 He dropped the gun, so went the glory 
 And this is the way I gotta end this story, 
 He was only nineteen, in a madman's dream 
 I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream, 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 Just another case 'bout the wrong path, 
 Straight and narrow or your soul gets cashed 
 G'night
