One time around the block 
 Two times around the clock 
 Three times, don't cross the little lady (lady) 
 So pretty and, oh, so bold 
 Got a heart full of gold on a lonely road 
 She said, "I don't even think that God can save me" (save me) 
 (Am I) gainin' ground 
 (Am I) losin' face 
 (Have I) lost and found my saving grace 
 Thankful for the gift my angels gave me 
 Born alone, we die alone 
 'N' I'm just sittin' here by the phone 
 Waitin' for the Lord to send my callin' 
 Street wise from the boulevard 
 Jesus only knows that she tries too hard 
 She's only tryin' to keep the sky from fallin' 
 Any man who says it's Heaven and Hell 
 Prob'ly got somethin' useless to sell 
 You ask me if I'm saved, but what's it to ya? 
 Blow a quarter, cop another eight 
 You're runnin' out of high, you're losin' your faith 
 Throw your hands up and scream, "Hallelujah" 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Amen 
 One time around the sun 
 Another year older and my work ain't done 
 It's time for me to write the final chapter (chapter) 
 Deal the cards and roll the dice 
 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll are my only vice 
 Tryin' to figure out just what's here after (here after) 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Amen
