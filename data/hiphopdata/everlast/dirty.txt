And I'm so dirty 
 Call me daddy 
 You're so sexy 
 You can be my bad girl 
 If someone hurt you 
 And you tried to hide it 
 I'd cut you deeper 
 'Cause I know you like it 
 The pain I got, girl 
 Could satisfy you 
 But I can't love you 
 I won't even try to 
 And that junkie urge 
 Deep down inside you 
 Couldn't keep my secret 
 But I know you'd like to 
 Girl you're never gonna get 
 Blood from my heart of stone 
 Some of us were just plain 
 Meant to be alone 
 I'm all out of secrets 
 I'm running out of lies 
 And I can see the end, girl 
 When I look into your eyes 
 And I'm so nasty 
 And I'm so greedy 
 And I'm so lonesome 
 Girl, I'm so needy 
 I wanna take you 
 And make you my girl 
 My willing hostage 
 My favorite prisoner 
 I'll be your owner 
 And I'll be your jailer 
 I'll be your lover 
 Girl, I'll be your savior 
 I'll be your alpha 
 And your Omega 
 I'll break your heart, girl 
 And you'll call me later 
 Girl you're never gonna get 
 Blood from my heart of stone 
 Some of us were just plain 
 Meant to be alone 
 I'm all out of secrets 
 I'm running out of lies 
 And I can see the end, girl 
 When I look into your eyes 
 And I'm so dirty 
 Call me daddy 
 You're so sexy 
 You can be my bad girl 
 And I'm so dirty 
 Call me daddy 
 You're so sexy 
 You can be my bad girl 
 And I'm so dirty 
 Call me daddy 
 You're so sexy 
 You can be my bad girl 
 And I'm so dirty 
 Call me daddy 
 You're so sexy 
 You can be my bad girl
