I hear the train a comin' 
 It's rolling round the bend 
 And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when, 
 I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on 
 But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone... 
 When I was just a baby my mama told me "Son, 
 Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns." 
 But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die 
 When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry... 
 I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car 
 They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars. 
 Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free 
 But those people keep a movin' 
 And that's what tortures me... 
 Well if they'd freed me from this prison, 
 If that railroad train was mine 
 I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line 
 Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay 
 And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away...
