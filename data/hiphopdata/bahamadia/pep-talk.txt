(Verse One) 
 Follow my lead as I delve into channels of chi affix harmony 
 Inwardly naturally 
 Sole purpose on the physical plane 
 Is to master my mind soul spirit and anatomy 
 Gradually map out destiny 
 Embrace the oneness that rest in me 
 Build a force field for the negativity 
 Then within it find out what the lesson be 
 Keep key elements to my survival elevating on spiral movement movin' 
 Subsequent to substance drawn off the perineum point or Hui Yin 
 Union Of the fem and the masculine become primary goals for the selves 
 To blend amend connection between jing and shen 
 Then be somewhere in the mix when life begins... 
 (Verse Two) 
 Inherited simpler ways to make better days 
 Striving to pave a steady trail evading the maze 
 Tending to exaperate personal space 
 That in turn alienates and stagnates true state of your place 
 In the scheme of things 
 In accordance to whatever karm brings 
 Face truth even if it do like bee stings 
 Or financially I'm up and down like moodswings 
 Attitude is till footloose and fancy free broaden my horizon 
 Roaming the galaxy galloping ballantly 
 Limits and boundaries Haam be clowning 
 These feed off most high source surrounding me 
 See each and every movement merely 
 As a chance to bond and correspond with power of the all in existence 
 Life is a privilege 
 Learn it love it live it... 
 (Repeat verse one)
