Rock on, to the break of dawn 
 Freak on to the early morn 
 Khadafi and Sue-kwon, you got it goin' on 
 To my man Big Shawn, you got it goin' on, now, yo 
 You got The Roots in the house 
 We also got Bahamadia in the house, representin' lovely 
 With you ears now proceed 
 It's flavor you wouldn't believe as we proceed 
 I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic 
 I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic 
 Let's, kill all the small talk, and just elaborate 
 The Roots collaborate I see myself as rather great 
 How the words generate, whole crews disintegrate 
 When I penetrate 
 As if in the course flow with intensive force 
 You best to go and check your source about my textual course 
 Simplicity, it sounds complex, you might miss it 
 But after you critique it you can kiss it 
 I'm assisting fire force that leaves statistics 
 When identify niggaz simplify you'll feel no sympathy 
 My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion 
 I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin' 
 My style is urban not suburban when I'm splurgin' 
 Gosh these MC's I wash more than detergent 
 I can split the Red Sea but deadly 
 Take heed, illadelph style as I proceed 
 Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly 
 Brand new, funk doobie, choosy with the tactics 
 When I gets Raw, like Dice, nice 
 With the flavor, Do You Want More?!??! 
 Of the Organix, pure 
 Eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics 
 Automatic, systematic 
 I'm nasty at it 
 So hand me the five micraphones like they did Illmatic 
 One time for the mind 
 Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind 
 The real is not whole or half time 
 All the time, and I shall proceed 
 I'm movin on baby, I shall proceed 
 To remain, on point like an infrared beam 
 Succeed, in chasing out the ultraviolet dreams 
 No Mas like Shorty, 'cause it's all about me 
 Black and handsome, holdin' MC's for ransom 
 Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom? 
 Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled 
 I hit you from the most bizarre angle, rectangular 
 Visions of papes my mind conceive 
 Motivatin' me to achieve as I must proceed 
 When I ride the train, traumatized to maintain 
 But laid back, the tracks can relax the brain 
 I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain 
 Servin' as a killer 
 To the pain I live a High Life like Miller 
 Me and the mic's mechanized 
 Respect recognize with mind beyond wise 
 Limitless when I bless the mic with speak 
 Dialect never weak, y'all niggaz know Tarik 
 From seven-fifth Snider Ave. got the flavor you need 
 For the ingredients indeed so to the lead I shall proceed
