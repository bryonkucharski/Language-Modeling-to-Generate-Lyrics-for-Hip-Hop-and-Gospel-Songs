Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time" 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time"

 As the clock keeps ticking in this hip hop shit 
 My main objective is to float way above the average 
 State of MCing by a thorough thought out elaborate 
 Speech reaching the multitude standing form of what I believe in 
 My all races of heaven for the one who's truth seeking 
 Be the vessel for messages so far without preaching 
 Before knowledge of self I walk through darkness like a heathen 
 Had a 3.5 GPA in ???? for teaching 
 Then my lust of words start giving life new meaning 
 Strengthen of my inner regions so my aura could be beaming 
 Fertilise my creation like ovaries to semen 
 Spit rhyme for reason, clinging to my up bringing 
 Spirit got to be that when I first pledge allegiance 
 Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing 
 Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing 
 I got for what I know to help the growth of human beings 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time" 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time" 
 Frankie Ano 
 I advertise like a poet, paint a picture when I flow it 
 Drop a gem on you then, all you party people know it 
 That I'm not a mere mortal, but extraordinary human 
 Amazing with the microphone, plus the music I be doing 
 Is I like, still the finest, like blue note jazz 
 Your royal highness, king poetic flavour of the rhyme list 
 I insist you close lips and pay homage 
 To me, Bahamadia and for the way we drop knowledge 
 Hot like peppermint, ultraviolet I spit 
 It's big like the bang theory, or when Adam start to spit 
 The champion, individually inspired son 
 Approach me with steady caution like the new millennium 
 Radiate, I see your eyes lit with grave concern 
 Recordable like CD-R when the shhh start to burn 
 Nowhere to run from when words sprung like volcanic ash 
 So somewhere in the future they can find you in the past 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time" 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time"

 Spit reality rap over this Frankenstein track 
 Recorded reported facts of an urban inhabitant 
 This is my, brain on wax, instead of mesculin or smack 
 Evade the ghetto death traps by using my thinking cap 
 Then drop, a gem and immortalise it 
 Any verse I use is a virtual patient 
 General thoughts so strong they linger on like a fragrance 
 Relate the folks from many walks of life and all ages 
 And all places and all stages, when all phases 
 Lend you a hand if your vision were ever jaded 
 For as the future cop me as one who try to save it 
 The impact of this music really ain't nothing to play with 
 Frankie Ano 
 See, I'm super fly paper, get you stuck on any subject 
 The hip hop president of this republic 
 I know you love it, don't fight it 
 Find peace before it fucks with your head, sort of like the Middle East 
 I break the lease and get bent on rappers to pay rent 
 Try to overthrow my government it ain't going to happen 
 I'm a real brother with a lasting impression 
 Forcing dedicated rappers to just quit their whole profession 
 No question on the mission verbal oral expedition 
 Wise words formulate the deadly verbal lyricism 
 I'm a Scorpio, but drop a gem on eyes 
 Stand clear from my dears is what I always advise 
 'Cause 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time" 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about that time 
 "For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine 
 Looking at my Gucci it's about time 
 "Check it, one time"
