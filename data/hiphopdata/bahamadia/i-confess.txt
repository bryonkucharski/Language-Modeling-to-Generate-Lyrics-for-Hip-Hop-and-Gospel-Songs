(Verse One:) 
 Word life boo, I checked you flexin wit' cha crew 
 Lookin' sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew, 
 Roughneck mannerism, fly disposition, 
 Ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm, 
 My mission, is gettin' into you like a religion, 
 My woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin, 
 You're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in, 
 This feelin' that I have is never endin, I'm sendin, my love like Zhane' up 
 In a box 
 With the bow up on the top, cause, for you I got the hots so 
 Please accept these feelings I possess I'm like a damsel in distress in 
 Pursuit of happiness, I confess 
 Chorus: I've been really tryin' baby 
 Tryin' to hold back these feelings for so long 
 And if you feel, like I feel baby 
 Come on, oh, come on 
 (Verse Two:) 
 Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills, 
 But still I picked you like a daffodil 
 Cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills, 
 Perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin' 
 That when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush, 
 That entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush, 
 Boy times girl times lust equals us, 
 And you can count on that like you would an abacus so 
 Bust the equation, baby 'cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of you 
 On two occasions, but I'ma max once I get this off my chest, and just let 
 Nature do the rest... 
 I confess 
 (Verse Three:) 
 I wanna be down like brandy with you handy for tha duration, 
 Engage in electric relaxation, 
 Build a conversation, probe ya intellect, 
 Put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is what 
 I'm after, 
 Ya heart I wanna capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores, 
 Truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born 
 But I could go on and on throwin' hints, 
 That I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin' life wit, 
 So instead I felt it best if I just, 
 Stood and represented in the flesh, 
 That I confess...
