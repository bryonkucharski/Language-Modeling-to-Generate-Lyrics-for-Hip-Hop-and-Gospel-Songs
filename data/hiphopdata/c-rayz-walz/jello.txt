The proof was in the pudding neighborhood called her Jello 
 My man thought she was thorough - poor fellow! 
 She fucked more niggaz than legal aid in each borough 
 Favorite color yellow; cheesy racked tendency profound mellow 
 The role of a serene sister, I miss her 
 Undercover gossip put her world in a twister 
 The setting is a sinister slum where sex ain't sacred 
 By thirteen she was pro-active and naked 
 Had a gift to give but she would tend a path not taken 
 Twenty years old she wishes she was in The Matrix 
 Years passed mad relationships ain't last 
 Her esteem was the small amount of sand in her hourglass 
 I told her she was beautiful she felt the opposite 
 Had the pieces to the puzzle couldn't find a proper fit 
 Each time we spoke she said, 'Something gotta give 
 I'm glad I ain't got a kid 'cause I don't even want to live!' 
 Mommy, my sister, her, she 
 Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece 
 My cousin, my wife, another part of me 
 Is where it all started see 
 But now we got chicken, slut, whores, tricks 
 Skins, ass, pussy, bitch 
 Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick! 
 Yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip! 
 "Get out my mind!" she tells herself time after time 
 Ignorin words spoke by the most high divine 
 In her own eyes she was less than prime 
 So sublime her smile upside down would decorate her lip line 
 Words note this cry for help by a wise man 
 Real short attention span, you know man 
 Parties in her head leave her eyes jam 
 Tears ran down cheek lane hell she would keep flings 
 Gave it up for fake things, street gangs, and cheap chains 
 Slept on the beasts who fiend for sweet dames 
 Take her stride with guys but yo they was lame 
 Hijacked a seat on my mental plane 
 She wanted dedication but kept finding debt bills 
 No skill, and life ills helped her to strip 
 She would diet, crying, but didn't notice 
 Pretty flowers get devoured, now know this 
 It's like Lauren (flippin in the ghetto on a dirty mattress) 
 Dreams of being nurse, a school teacher, or an actress 
 Surrounded by self hate happiness pursued by the sadness 
 She committed suicide on the Sabbath 
 Young queen lost she was no longer a girl 
 Killed by lack of understanding in an ignorant world 
 She played the roll, but yo her supporting cast 
 Was every man that lied to her just to get in the ass 
 (In a whisper) 
 Mommy, my sister, her, she 
 Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece 
 My cousin, my wife, another part of me 
 Is where it all started see 
 But now we got chicken, slut, whores tricks 
 Skins, ass, pussy, bitch 
 Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick! 
 Yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip!
