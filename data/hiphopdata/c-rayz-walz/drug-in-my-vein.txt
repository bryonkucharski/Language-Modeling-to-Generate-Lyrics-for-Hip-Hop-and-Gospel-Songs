Hip hop like drug in my veins 
 Killing me harshly 
 This could be [?] 
 Don't start me 
 In street life I'm hugging the flames 
 Get this heat off me 
 Tie the knot, eating not driving right in the iron hot seat 
 I love hip hop for the lack of something worse to do 
 I spit high then just rock, this is impersonal 
 Free shows, flee flows, wonder if I'm breaking even 
 Eating [?], worth of snacks just to start breaking even 
 Hating seeing what I love misused and abused 
 Mind bleeding, confusion, focus, a loser succeeded 
 I ask questions to answers and define reason 
 Like cancer to a cigarette lung having fun, still breathing 
 Smokers suck pot, no pun intended 
 I'm tryin' to get big in the Bronks like Pun intended 
 I'm still booking if your looking, still juking, still crazy 
 Just got my straight jacket on, quickly lock it 
 I thought that I was all about it 
 But my mind remained clouded from weed, without it 
 What you read about it? 
 Crazy man ran through the train car crowded 
 Strapped with bang-bars, dramatic 
 Expression in face destined to taste it 
 While finessing the basics 
 Essence of ancients like P.A.Z.E 
 Keep it ten steps ahead like the KGB 
 Beasts watching me harder than Jay-Z streets 
 Cage me now, the search found a crazy nut 
 You mangey cops 
 That's coming from the stage we rock 
 Stoned, earth and home all alone 
 With the peace of the block grown to daddy unknown 
 Had his son known pop would he have left it alone? Never 
 Out with the chrome, build the treasures of doom 
 Represent home 
 Slay to lay the rest of this poem to it's long lost kite unflown 
 How long this gonna be going on? 
 Hip hop like drug in my veins 
 In real life I'm still light and move at the speed of it 
 A bad child on the mic, sometimes I just need a hit 
 The difference of right and wrong 
 Open mic and writing a song 
 Someone I love or a chick that I like looking nice in thongs 
 While you rush to work and rude people step on your feet 
 I'm coming from the studio thinking deep, listening to beats 
 You think that I wake after I rest in peace 
 I live heavenly in hell, feeling well writing the heat 
 They putting math[?] improper on us, want us dead 
 Plus they couldn't care less if every corners red 
 Hunted like cornish hens 
 Even men making honest ends, born to sin 
 Walk and take me out tournaments 
 From hanging like ornaments to self-inflicted infortunates 
 Do it to yourself like "who taught you this?" 
 Bought you for a portion now 
 Abortion is a landless mask 
 And yeah my man's work the plans to command this cash
