I'll keep swingin' for the fences 
 It's like this heart is defenseless 
 Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins 
 Blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin' 
 And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin' 
 It might flicker, but they can't kill the flame 
 I can't stop 
 I can't quit 
 It's in my heart 
 It's on my lips 
 I can't stop, no 
 I can't quit 
 It's in my heart, yeah 
 I'm all in 
 Till the wheels fall off 
 Till the spotlight fades 
 I will lift your banner high 
 I will lift your banner high 
 And till the walls crash in 
 For the rest of my days 
 I'll lay it all on the line 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the end of the line 
 Till the day I die 
 It's Your name I'll glorify 
 It's runnin' deeper than the ocean 
 This ain't religion, it's devotion 
 365, every minute, everyday 
 So in the middle of the madness 
 They can stretch me out like canvas 
 But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame 
 I can't stop 
 I can't quit 
 It's in my heart 
 It's on my lips 
 I can't stop, no 
 I can't quit 
 It's in my heart, yeah 
 I'm all in 
 Till the wheels fall off 
 Till the spotlight fades 
 I will lift your banner high 
 I will lift your banner high 
 And till the walls crash in 
 For the rest of my days 
 I'll lay it all on the line 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the end of the line 
 Till the day I die 
 It's Your name I'll glorify 
 Till I die and they put me in the coffin 
 Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin' 
 Tell me what you think about me, that really ain't important 
 You know Imma represent um, I ain't playin', can't afford to 
 I only got one life and I get it though 
 And this is not an act, not a movie, not a TV show 
 I don't know what quittin' means, I don't ever take it slow 
 You know I'm on the grind, me and Toby in the studio 
 Do it for the King, what you know about that? 
 Say you goin' harder, mmm I doubt that' 
 You say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at 
 How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at? 
 God is not a crutch, you can use Him when you wanna 
 You only look to heaven when you goin' through some drama 
 And when they goin' through some problems and that's the only time they call Him 
 I guess I don't understand that life, wonder why? 
 Cause' I'm all in 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the wheels fall off 
 Till the spotlight fades 
 I will lift your banner high 
 I will lift your banner high 
 And till the walls crash in 
 For the rest of my days 
 I'll lay it all on the line 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the day I die 
 Till the end of the line 
 Till the day I die 
 It's Your name I'll glorify
