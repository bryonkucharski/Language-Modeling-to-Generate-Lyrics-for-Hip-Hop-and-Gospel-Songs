Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people, makin' music for the people 
 I wanna magnify Your light 
 I wanna reflect the sun 
 Cut like precious diamonds 
 With the colors by the millions 
 This is the only world we know 
 And for now this rental's our home 
 If we gonna be a reflection 
 Gotta make this third rock glow 
 (Just so you know ...) 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people, makin' music for the people 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people 
 Jesus music for the people 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
 Lights in the city might be more than pretty, pretty 
 That freaky shine might be more than meets the eye 
 Anytime you see that sparkle in the dark you might look deeper, deeper 
 It might be more than simply theatre 
 Yo, that smile might be joy that's connected to the spirit 
 The spirit might be contagious if you dare, you dare come near it 
 I remember, can't forget, peace that you can't second guess 
 Sparkle as the light reflects we writin' pay it forward checks 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people, makin' music for the people 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people 
 Jesus music for the people 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
 The lights in the city shine bright 
 The lights in the city shine bright 
 So let your heart light shine tonight 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people, makin' music for the people 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people to illuminate the soul 
 Lights shine bright everywhere we go 
 Music for the people 
 Jesus music for the people 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright 
 Everywhere we go 
 Lights shine bright, lights shine bright...
