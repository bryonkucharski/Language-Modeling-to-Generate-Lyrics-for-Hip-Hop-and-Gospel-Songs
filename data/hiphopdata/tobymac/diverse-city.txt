They call us Diverse City, we're colorful good 
 It's like a freak show in your neighborhood 
 So, if you wanna praise you can come on down 
 Cause this freak show's leaving the ground 
 Up, up and away, baby we don't play, maybe you thought you was done for the day 
 He said, she said, I said this, that you can't get away from your moment of bliss 
 Stirring, we'll lure you in and we'll make room for the shade of skin 
 Short ones, tall ones, skinny ones, bigger, love is the gun and we pullin' that trigger 
 So you send me and I'll send you hope in the form of a new tattoo 
 Mine is the shiny city on a hill and yours, of course, is the colors that fill it 
 We'll take you high, we'll take you higher 
 Now come to the city where you can praise 
 If you're black, if you're white, if you're yellow or grey 
 In the morning, in the night, anytime of day 
 What's that place?' Diverse City! 
 With curls in your hair and braids on the side 
 Straight shake 'em loose, just come on and ride 
 We're a body with parts, like you and me 
 Together we make diversity 
 Welcome to Diverse City, we're colorful good 
 It's like a freak show in your neighborhood 
 So, if you wanna praise you can come on down 
 Cause this freak show's leaving the ground 
 Said we're Diverse City, we're colorful goods 
 It's just a state of mind, we gonna shine the way that we should, baby 
 So, if you wanna praise you can come on down 
 Cause this freak show's leaving the ground 
 You bring the heart, I'll bring the soul 
 I'll bring the flag, you bring the pole

 The dream of a king 'bout to unfold 
 We 'bout to do this thing for real
