Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey 
 Who had only one reason to be hated by whitey 
 Raised on a farm outside of South Bend 
 Where they hated on him 'cause he was 
 African American 
 But three years later, Mikey was the town pride 
 Basketball Mikey went and got himself a full ride 
 Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor 
 And that's something white America could never ignore 
 Stop, hey, what's that sound 
 Everybody look what's goin' down 
 Stop, hey, what's that sound 
 Everybody look what's goin' down 
 What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down 
 I wanna know just what's goin' down 
 What's goin' down tell ya what's goin' down 
 You wanna know just what's goin' down 
 Take a look around 
 Everything is comin' down 
 Do you hear the subtle sounds 
 Of our mortality slippin' 
 People on the go 
 We'll be reapin' what we sow 
 Yeah we say we want to know 
 But I got my suspicions 
 Welcome to the world of a girl name Susie 
 Susie's only crime was that she was born a cutie 
 Physically abused by her uncle and his friends 
 Alcohol let 'em all leave the house with grins 
 But Susie couldn't shake off the memories 
 Forced to find her own kind of remedy 
 A man-eater for the rest of her days 
 Three kids, three men, no daddies by eleventh grade 
 What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down 
 I wanna know just what's goin' down 
 What's goin' down tell ya what's goin' down 
 You wanna know just what's goin' down 
 What is goin' diggy down 
 What is goin' diggy down 
 When you find what you lost 
 But you lose what you found 
 But you lose what you found
