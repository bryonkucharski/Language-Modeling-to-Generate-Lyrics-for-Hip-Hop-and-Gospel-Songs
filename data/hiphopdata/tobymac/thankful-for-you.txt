Well it started out in the spare bedroom 
 Two turned tables uh and a microphone 
 I was flipping over 33's 
 Working on rhymes and melodies 
 Searching for some more of You 
 (And little less of me) 
 It's never been my dream 
 To see my face in magazines 
 It's always been about the music 
 Hoping God would use it 
 To set some people free 
 But I can say without a doubt 
 I never had it figured out 
 Lord you've opened every door 
 I've stepped through yeah 
 And I try to keep my head about me 
 I'm thankful for the friends around me 
 I'm thankful for You yeah 
 I'm thankful for You 
 I've been on this road 
 But you come to my shows 
 Sometimes just a few of y'all 
 (Other times in troops) 
 But you've been right there to rock with us 
 We come together, we lift Him up 
 Seeing You there inspires me, put Your fire in me 
 It's never been my dream 
 To read my name in magazines 
 It's always been about the music 
 Praying God would use it to set some people free 
 But I can say without a doubt 
 I never had it figured out 
 Lord you've opened every door 
 I've stepped through yeah 
 And I try to keep my head about me 
 So thankful for the friends around me 
 I'm thankful for You yeah 
 I'm thankful for You yeah 
 I'm thankful for You 
 It's such a free feeling that You got me feeling 
 We're all good all good all good 
 I love this free feeling that You got me feeling 
 We're all good all good all good 
 Said I love that free feeling 
 That You got me feeling 
 We're all good all good all good 
 Yeah 
 They say you become who you hang out with 
 Well I can tell you for sure 
 You made me a better man 
 And I can say without a doubt 
 I never had it figured out 
 Lord you've opened every door 
 I've stepped through yeah 
 And I try to keep my head about me 
 So thankful for the friends around me 
 I'm thankful for You yeah 
 I'm thankful for You yeah 
 I'm thankful for You 
 Thankful for You 
 Thankful for You 
 That's it
