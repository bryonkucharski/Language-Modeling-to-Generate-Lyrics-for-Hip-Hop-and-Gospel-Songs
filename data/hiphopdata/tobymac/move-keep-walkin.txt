Another heartbreak day 
 Feels like you're miles away 
 Don't even need no shade 
 When your sun don't shine, shine 
 Too many passin' dreams 
 Roll by like limousines 
 It's hard to keep believin' 
 When they pass you by and by 
 I know your heart been broke again 
 I know your prayers ain't been answered yet 
 I know you're feeling like you got nothing left 
 Well, lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet so 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 Move, keep walkin' until the mornin' comes 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 And lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet 
 Echoin' inside your head 
 Are the words that your sweet momma said, 
 "Shoot for the moon, my dear" 
 So you took aim out of this atmosphere 
 Between high stakes and pump fakes 
 You're feelin' like you can't buy a break 
 I can hold your hand, but I can't turn your eyes to freedom 
 I know your heart been broke again 
 I know your prayers ain't been answered yet 
 I know you're feeling like you got nothing left 
 Well, lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet so 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 Move, keep walkin' until the mornin' comes 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 And lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet 
 Hold on, hold on 
 Lord ain't finished yet 
 Hold on, hold on 
 He'll get you through this 
 Hold on, hold on 
 These are the promises 
 I never will forget 
 I never will forget 
 Hold on, hold on 
 The Lord ain't finished yet 
 Hold on, hold on 
 He'll get you through this 
 Hold on, hold on 
 These are the promises 
 I never will forget 
 I never will forget 
 I know your heart been broke again 
 I know your prayers ain't been answered yet 
 It ain't over yet, ain't over yet so 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 Move, keep walkin' until the mornin' comes 
 Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on 
 And lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet...
