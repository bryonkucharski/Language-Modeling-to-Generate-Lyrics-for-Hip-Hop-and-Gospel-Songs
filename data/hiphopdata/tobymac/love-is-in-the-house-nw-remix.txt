Do what you love 
 And you'll love what you do 
 (That's what they say) 
 That's only true 
 When I'm following you 
 Cause you are my shade 
 On those hot southern days 
 You're the hand I live to hold 
 You fill up this space 
 Put love where it ain't 
 And you're patient as I grow 
 So I know 
 Love is in the house 
 And the house is packed 
 So much soul I left the back door cracked 
 Mama always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house 
 The house is packed 
 Love is in the house 
 And the house is packed 
 Daddy always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house 
 The house is packed. 
 Your love is patient 
 Your love it shines 
 I'll never capture all its beauty in my dopest rhymes 
 Your love is Tru-Blue 
 Your love's The Twins 
 Your love's a girl from Jamaica 
 Who is still my best friend 
 You brought life to me 
 So on the mic 
 I'm communicatin' everything you've done for me 
 You filled the halls of my house with your love 
 So I'm lifting you up 
 Government checks they flex with no dollars 
 Two turn tables and a plate full of collards 
 Royalty checks we flex with few dollars 
 But amazing grace makes the people wanna holla. 
 Love is in the house 
 And the house is packed 
 So much soul I left the back door cracked 
 Mama always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house 
 The house is packed 
 Love is in the house 
 And the house is packed 
 So much soul I left the back door cracked 
 Daddy always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house 
 The house is packed. 
 Woke up this morning 
 Didn't know what to do 
 There was people all around me 
 Tellin' me to sing the blues 
 Said they ain't seen no happy since 1992 
 Then they turned to me thinkin' I'd agree 
 And I offered this humble view 
 And I said 
 Naaah nah nah nah naah 
 Nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Love is in the house is packed 
 Sing: 
 Naaah nah nah nah naah 
 Nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Love is in the house is packed 
 Woke up this morning 
 Spend some time with you 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed
