Told the girl that you should treat her like a lady and 
 She told me all the things you did and it was shady, man 
 She said that what you say and what you do are different things 
 While you were telling me that you were checking out them blingy rings 
 She said she's had enough 
 Well, it sounds to me like you're straight out of luck 
 And she said she's all through 
 And life's not blowin' her kisses thanks to you 
 I wanna know, wanna know what you were thinkin' 
 I can't imagine why it didn't even sink in 
 They say you never know what you got till it's gone 
 (Never know what you got till it's gone) 
 I wanna know, wanna know what you were thinkin' 
 I can't imagine why it didn't even sink in 
 They say you never know what you got till it's gone 
 (Never know what you got till it's gone) 
 She said she's had enough 
 So, it sounds to me like your still out of love 
 And she said you weren't true 
 And life's not blowin' her kisses thanks to you 
 She said it's gonna be alright 
 Cause God made a way through the pain and he opened her eyes 
 And she said you came crawling back 
 But after what you did to her she wouldn't have any of that
