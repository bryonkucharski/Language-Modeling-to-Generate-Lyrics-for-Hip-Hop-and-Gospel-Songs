I'm captivated, I'll say it 
 I'm on a whole new intrigue 
 My space invaded, upgraded 
 I hear You talking to me 
 It's in the boom of the thunder, it's in the cool of the rain 
 And I'll say I don't ever want to get away 
 Tonight is beautiful 
 It's got my mind on You 
 And everywhere I turn is a reminder 
 I see You in everything, all day 
 And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me 
 I see You in every little thing, all day 
 No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me 
 I see You in everything 
 You're all up in everything 
 My soul's awaken 
 I'm taken by all the beauty You bring 
 You got it blarin', I'm starin' 
 Love watching You do Your thing 
 There's no mistaken Your style 
 No mistaken Your touch 
 I see the grand, I see the subtle of Your love 
 Lord, I see You in everything, all day 
 And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me 
 I see You in every little thing, all day 
 No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me 
 It's finding me in everything, all day 
 And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me 
 I see You in every little thing, all day 
 No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me 
 Tonight is beautiful 
 It's got my mind on You 
 And everywhere I turn is a reminder 
 From the sparkle in her eyes to the starlit open skies 
 You bring my heart to life, fill me with wonder 
 Oh, I can see Your love, Your love in everything 
 And that's why You'll always be my everything 
 Yeah, I can see Your love, Your love in everything 
 And that's why You'll always be my everything
