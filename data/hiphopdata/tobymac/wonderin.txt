Well I'm wonderin' 'bout the road ahead of me, 
 Wonderin' 'bout the things you said to me, 
 Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
 And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days, 
 Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
 Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you. 
 Uh! We didn't know what to do 
 But you were lookin' at me and I was lookin' at you 
 And we were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God 
 For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts 
 And yo, without a second to think 
 We was tourin' around and we were making that bank 
 And we was ridin' in style clockin' them miles 
 With the songs that He put down deep in our hearts 
 Well I'm wonderin' 'bout the road ahead of me, 
 Wonderin' 'bout the things you said to me, 
 Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
 And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days, 
 Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
 Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you. 
 Yeah, it's been a minute my friend 
 And you and I, we never thought it would end 
 But when we stopped to pause, it opens the doors 
 On some dreams that were put down deep in my heart 
 But hey, I'm always thinkin' of you 
 And I can see your influence in the things that I do 
 Thick and thin, forever my friend 
 Cause there's a bond that was put down deep in our hearts 
 Well I'm wonderin' 'bout the road ahead of me, 
 Wonderin' 'bout the things you said to me, 
 Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
 And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days, 
 Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
 Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you. 
 We didn't know what to do 
 You were lookin' at me and I was lookin' at you 
 We were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God 
 For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts 
 And hey, if I could turn back time 
 I wouldn't touch a day, I wouldn't shade the shine 
 'Cause I do know this, I won't be remiss 
 With the memories locked away in my heart (locked away in my heart..) 
 Well I'm wonderin' 'bout the road ahead of me, 
 Wonderin' 'bout the things you said to me, 
 Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
 And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days, 
 Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
 Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you. 
 Wonderin' if we ever had a clue
