Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo 
 There in the air 
 I had a dream last night about the other side 
 And I must confess that it was quite the ride 
 I had a dream last night and the fact that you weren't there 
 Gave me quite the scare (Uh-huh) 
 You see people were afloat all around me 
 Yet their weightless state never seemed to astound me 
 Everything was grand till I noticed one thing 
 That you my friend weren't on the scene 
 Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo 
 There in the air 
 I've been working all morning trying to spin my dream 
 'Cause I just can't believe you weren't in my dream 
 Remember you and I said we would paint the sky 
 And the leaves on the trees and the stars at night 
 We made beats and we even wrote rhymes 
 And played golf I think a million times 
 Now we never got around to spiritual matters 
 But we sure made time for our mindless chatter 
 Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo 
 Whether here, there or in the air 
 I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there) 
 One day we'll we be singin' (Singin') (Alleluia) 
 I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there) 
 One day we'll we be singin' (Singin') (Alleluia) 
 *Phone dialing* 
 (Other guy) Hello? 
 (Toby) Wassup? 
 Wassup? 
 How you doin'? 
 Just fine! 
 I was sort of wondering, could we make a time? 
 Just to kick it? 
 Why not? At our usual spot 
 Lattes in May 
 Mine cold yours hot 
 So where we goin'? 
 Much deeper than our usual chat 
 Like whose beats is weak and whose (both) beats is phat 
 (Toby) Nah my man just some next level junk 
 Like when we discussed if Tiger Woods could dunk? 
 Just meet me there, seven o'clock 
 Rain or shine yo 
 With a fat cup of bean and a wide open mind (wide open mind) 
 Man that's heavy 
 Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo 
 There in the air 
 I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there) 
 One day we'll we be singin' (Singin') (Alleluia) 
 I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there) 
 One day we'll we be singin' (Singin') (Alleluia)
