Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I and you 
 Illuminati comin' through 
 Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I and you 
 Illuminati comin' through 
 Flow like the Cassius, swing like the Clay 
 One day, I'm'a make the whole world pay 
 With k.o.'s and okay we bash clots-n-dot-dash 
 You got that right, I'm'a rock the Morse code tonight 
 Transmit 'n' throwin' fits 'n' paparazzi like zits 
 Get flipped out and squeezed fresh like juicy sun kissed 
 And if I miss with my missles you're still gonna sizzle 
 'Cause I frizzle fry radiation style worldwide 
 You got your pipeline clogged man get that puppy routed 
 You got the style down and since you don't know about it 
 Who's the loser (I am) because we come in numb love 
 And choicer and did I mention looser (no you didn't) 
 Then I do sir, producer, hit me with the juice 
 Much obliged got the head of a moose 
 So mount me on the wall of your livin' room 
 Sure to bring the boom 
 Speakin' like a zoom deep into your tomb 
 And if you feel the vibe glide true it's on you 
 And if you need to drive right through it's on you 
 And if your screamin' "moi non plus" it's like 
 What you tryin' to do when you can't fade the true one 
 Eruption type volcanics I got the vocal spurtmatic 
 Suction cup hands upside the slammin' daily planet 
 I do windows (on school days) spill Jim Jones (type kool-aid) 
 All these primrose (style bouquets) I clip those (for doomsday) 
 Got succulent flavor, the uprisen Savior 
 Manifestin' through these mics, blastin' out your graveyard 
 Savor every bite that TOBYMAC gave ya 
 Turn and tell your neighbor this ball-o-dirt is goin' into labor
