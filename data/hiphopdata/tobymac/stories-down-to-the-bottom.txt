Stories we all got 'em 
 We've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 To let the lost know that someone cares 
 'Cause we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 And let somebody know that the most high cares 
 I never knew that it would feel like this 
 When the two that raised you up and call it quits 
 Nobody told me 'bout the emptiness 
 When the place you call home is closed for business 
 I push the pain down, I gotta get by 
 Always knowin' in my heart that it ain't gonna fly 
 Rock bottom's never felt so near before 
 And if pain is God's megaphone, it's loud and clear 
 So hold me now Father, human love ain't enough 
 I've failed and been failed by the people I love 
 But Your faithful arms they surround me 
 And any other soul who has to sail those seas of a broken family 
 See we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 To let the lost know that someone cares 
 'Cause we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 And let somebody know that the most high cares 
 Been so many times that I've been close to rock bottom 
 Tryin' to look for answers but nobody's got 'em 
 Like the time my mother looked me in the eye 
 Tryin' not to cry, tellin' me the cancer might cause her to die 
 How can this be? I thought that God loved me 
 So why would he try to take my mother from me? 
 And as I cry myself to sleep at night, holding on my pillow tight 
 He spoke to me and said that everything gonna be alright 
 So I tried to fight all the pain that it caused 
 I try to move on and I try to stay strong 
 So put your hands up, if y'all are feelin' me 
 And put your hands up, for everyone to see 
 So put your hands up, we all a family 
 So put your hands up, in unity, in unity 
 See we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 To let the lost know that someone cares 
 'Cause we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 And let somebody know that the most high cares 
 We've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 I've been there too when everything falls apart 
 And the best you can do is 
 Get through each day wonderin' will this never end 
 Is it always gonna be this way? 
 And the greatest lie you've ever been told is 
 You're the only one to ever walk on this road 
 And now you'll never see the light of dawn 
 So we came together to say, "Hold on" 
 'Cause we've been there and found our way home 
 I promise you that you're not on your own 
 One day this will pass, God will see us all through 
 God will see us all through, God will see us all pass through 
 See we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 And let the lost know that someone cares 
 'Cause we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 And let somebody know that the most high cares 
 'Cause we've been down to the bottom 
 Stories we've got 'em 
 If you been there put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air 
 I'm gone out on the boat again 
 She's back there all alone again 
 One trend, when will it ever end? 
 For her, for me, for her, for me 
 I'm gone out on the boat again 
 She's back there all alone again 
 One trend, when will it ever end? 
 For her, for me
