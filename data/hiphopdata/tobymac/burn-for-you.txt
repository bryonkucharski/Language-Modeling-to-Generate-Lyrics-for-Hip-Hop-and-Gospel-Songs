I'm a brand new man, I'm a conscious man 
 I'm a man who's burnin' for you 
 The mistakes I've made have been chased away to the bottom of the ocean blue 
 I'm a brand new man in a foreign land, I'm a man who's feelin' that fire 
 And it's all so clear when I'm standing here at the peak of my desire 
 So won't you move me like you used to 
 I want the world to know I burn for you 
 I feel revived again, I am alive again 
 (Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up 
 I feel revived again, I'm energized again 
 (Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up 
 Woke up in a sweat, those ghosts in my head 
 Had a grip, but I slipped on by 
 It's a whole new day as the darkness fades 
 And the sun's climbing in the sky 
 I concede, my love, that I need your love 
 I'm before you, a broken man 
 And it's only you, no substitutes who can renew this soul again 
 So won't you move me like you used to 
 I want the world to know I burn for you 
 I feel revived again, I am alive again 
 (Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up 
 I feel revived again, I'm energized again 
 (Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up 
 You got me higher than Kilimanjaro 
 Got me believin' I can "save the day" 
 I'm up and running like their ain't no tomorrow 
 I'd rather burn for you than fade away 
 I'd rather burn for you than go my way 
 I'm a whole new guy with a whole new vibe 
 Changed inside - more flame in the fire 
 Can't stop, won't stop praying for desire 
 Like the bunny on the screen feel so energized 
 Old shell gone without a trace, new face 
 No more shortness of breath, new pace 
 Live life now without the taste of fear 
 TOBYMAC, Double Dutch now let the smoke clear
