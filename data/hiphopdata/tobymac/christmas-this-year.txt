As fall rides off in the sunset 
 I sweep the snow from my doorstep 
 I just can't help but stop and grin 
 It's like I'm ten years old again 
 And everywhere I go I can feel it 
 Some say it moves like a spirit 
 It falls on us once a year 
 Like it came on a midnight clear 
 It's all love 
 The season is a gift 
 When love came down to let us live 
 Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment 
 For Christmas this year 
 Gonna make a sound 
 Gonna make it loud 
 For Christmas this year 
 We're gonna make some noise 
 Let the world rejoice 
 For Christmas this year 
 For Christmas 
 For Christmas this year 
 The laughter starts before the sunrise 
 I sneak downstairs at the sparklin' lights 
 And oh what joy it brings to me 
 Our family around our Christmas tree 
 And I thank the Lord for His favor 
 As we sing the songs of the Savior 
 Our Savior 
 It's all love 
 The season is a gift 
 When love came down to let us live 
 Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment 
 For Christmas this year 
 Gonna make a sound 
 Gonna make it loud 
 For Christmas this year 
 We're gonna make some noise 
 Let the world rejoice 
 For Christmas this year 
 For Christmas 
 For Christmas this year 
 Holy Holy holy 
 God is coming near 
 Unto us a Savior's born 
 On a midnight clear 
 Holy Holy holy 
 God is coming near 
 Unto us a Savior's born 
 On a midnight clear 
 Oh 
 For Christmas this year 
 Gonna make a sound 
 Gonna make it loud 
 For Christmas this year 
 We're gonna make some noise 
 Let the world rejoice 
 For Christmas this year 
 For Christmas 
 For Christmas this year 
 For Christmas this year 
 Gonna make a sound 
 Gonna make it loud 
 For Christmas this year 
 We're gonna make some noise 
 Let the world rejoice 
 For Christmas this year 
 For Christmas 
 For Christmas this year 
 Holy Holy holy 
 God is coming near 
 Unto us a savior born 
 On a midnight clear
