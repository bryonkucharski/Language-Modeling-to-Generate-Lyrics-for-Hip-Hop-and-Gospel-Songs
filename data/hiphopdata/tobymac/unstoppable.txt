We are, we are 
 We are, we are 
 We are, we are 
 We are, we are 
 We are the travelers, we look to the ever after 
 We are the strangers, we're practically endangered 
 We know these roads here, they never seem to bode well 
 It's our predicament and we ain't even sick of it 
 We make our moves in mysterious ways 
 We'd rather burn up, than stick to the shade 
 Not of this world so we live on the run 
 We keep our eyes set on what is to come 
 We are, we are (we are unstoppable) 
 We are, we are (for the impossible) 
 We are, we are (we are the kingdom come) 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 We are, we are (we are unstoppable) 
 We are, we are (for the impossible) 
 We are, we are (we are the kingdom come) 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 We keep it moving, this path is by our choosing 
 When we get tripped up we call above for lift up 
 Stay busy bashing while we proceed with passion 
 They say we missing it but I'm inclined to stick with this 
 We make our moves in mysterious ways 
 We'd rather burn up, than stick to the shade 
 Not of this world so we live on the run 
 We've got our hearts set on what is to come 
 We are, we are (we are unstoppable) 
 We are, we are (for the impossible) 
 We are, we are (we are the kingdom come) 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 We are, we are (we are unstoppable) 
 We are, we are (for the impossible) 
 We are, we are (we are the kingdom come) 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 There's no disguising, the truth is rising 
 There's no disguising, the truth is rising 
 To live is Christ, to die is Gain 
 We're not afraid, we're not afraid 
 To live is Christ, to die is Gain 
 So bring the noise, we're not afraid 
 We are, we are 
 We are, we are 
 We are, we are (we are unstoppable) 
 We are, we are (for the impossible) 
 We are, we are (we are the kingdom come) 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 We are unstoppable 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 For the impossible 
 That's who we are, that's who we are 
 Unstoppable 
 We are, that's who we are 
 For the impossible 
 That's who we are, that's who we are
