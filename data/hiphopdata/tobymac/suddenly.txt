She blew everything to pieces 
 He's there hanging on to Jesus 
 She broke everything about him down 
 He said he never saw it coming 
 Until the day she dropped the bomb 
 And she broke everything about him down 
 Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe 
 And suddenly all of it's behind you 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 That yesterday is gone so say goodbye 
 And suddenly the skies open above you 
 And someone really loves you 
 Now everything's alive 
 Everything's alive 
 She's there broken into pieces 
 But he swears he doesn't really see it 
 When she says that all of it was so unfair 
 But Hope road is just around the corner 
 It's one place there's never been a foreigner 
 'Cause God's love makes everybody welcome there 
 Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe 
 And suddenly all of it's behind you 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 That yesterday is gone so say goodbye 
 And suddenly the skies open above you 
 You know, Jesus really loves you 
 And everything's alive 
 Everything's alive 
 Sometimes it's in an instant 
 Sometimes we wait for years 
 But it comes down to the moment when faith eclipses fear 
 Your wandering is over 
 The other side is real 
 You've broken through 
 Your mountain moved 
 And mercy is revealed 
 His mercy is revealed, yeah 
 Yesterday is long gone. 
 And suddenly all of it's behind you 
 And I'm here to remind you 
 That yesterday is gone so wave goodbye 
 And finally the skies open around you 
 And love has truly found you 
 Now everything is alive 
 Everything's alive 
 Everything's alive 
 Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe
