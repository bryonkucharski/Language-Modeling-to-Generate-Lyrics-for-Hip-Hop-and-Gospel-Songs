Last night, everything was movin' so fast 
 I could barely keep track 
 Of my offenses or your defenses 
 In hindsight, I woulda, coulda, shoulda not gone there 
 But left without a word to spare 
 Was it your offenses or my defensiveness? 
 That's got me thinkin' that we're never gonna get it right 
 I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight 
 If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside 
 This thing is eatin' me alive 
 Well I'm right here 
 And you're right there 
 And God knows we've got to start somewhere 
 'Cause I'm messed up 
 And you're broken 
 And those shots we fired are still smokin' 
 I'm tossin' and turnin' on the things I'd undo 
 As I wrestle with the painful truth 
 My sleep escapes me as guilt berates me 
 Exhausted, the memories are drawing so near 
 I can see it like a world premiere 
 When did my objective lose all objectiveness? 
 If I need you, and you need me 
 How can you turn your back and just leave me? 
 When I'm right here, and you're right there 
 And God knows we've got to start somewhere 
 I said some things that I regret 
 And if I could, I'd take 'em back 
 If I could turn my words around 
 You wouldn't hear a sound 
 But here I am, and there you are 
 The space betwee n us is not so far 
 I'm reaching out my hand in love 
 Before the fading sun, forgive me for what I've done
