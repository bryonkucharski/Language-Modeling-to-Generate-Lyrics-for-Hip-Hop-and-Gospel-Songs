One thing leads to another 
 It was a Garden of Eden, it was like no other 
 Everything I needed, everything I could wanted 
 And every time I turn around, I'm singing our song 
 So what happened girl? How could I forget? 
 We always asked something since we was kids 
 I may dip in it now, but no matter how I stack this 
 I conclude, you're matchless 
 Like a star dust bound for Earth 
 All the leaves have just let go 
 Your gravity takes me like a domino 
 I fall for you again 
 Every time just like the first time 
 I fade away, you draw me back 
 Your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for you again 
 I can't believe that after all this time, you're still mine 
 I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us) 
 I fall for, I fall for you 
 Some say it's a little romantic 
 But me? Imma have to chance it 
 If they can talk about their love is like there ain't no other 
 Surely I can tell 'em 'bout the real I discovered 
 I know they gonna call it old fashioned 
 But they ain't about to rattle my passion 
 'Cause it's you and me, label me the dreamer 
 It's a wrap girl, I'm around your finger 
 Like a star dust bound for Earth 
 All the leaves have just let go 
 Your gravity takes me like a domino 
 I fall for you again 
 Every time just like the first time 
 I fade away, you draw me back 
 Your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for you again 
 I can't believe that after all this time, you're still mine 
 I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us) 
 I fall for, I fall for you 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Everyday's a new day to love you 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 All my dreams lead back to you 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 I can't count the ways, the ways I love you 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 You're my godsend, baby it's true 
 I fall for you again 
 Every time just like the first time 
 I fade away, you draw me back 
 Your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for you again 
 I can't believe that after all this time, you're still mine 
 I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us 
 I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us) 
 I fall for, I fall for you
