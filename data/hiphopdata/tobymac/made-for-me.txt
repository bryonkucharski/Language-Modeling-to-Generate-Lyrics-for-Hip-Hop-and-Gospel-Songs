Yeah, here we go 
 1, 2, 3 
 She was 17 when she came on the scene 
 I saw her down the hall and felt that I was in a dream 
 See she was from the islands 
 Which had this brother smiling 
 Little did I know that I'd be on this, my contestifying 
 I love sunsets but she likes sunrise 
 I'm always running late and she's always on time 
 But I like U2 and she like Coldplay 
 But something tells me we're gonna be OK 
 'Cause she was made for me 
 You gave 'er to me 
 I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you 
 Just right for me and for the life of me 
 I can't believe I get to call her mine 
 And she was made for me 
 Made for me 
 And she was made for me 
 Made for me 
 Next chapter - we got hitched 
 And thought we'd have some kids 
 Looked up and now we got five little Jamaricans 
 I thank God every day 
 I'm blessed in a crazy way 
 My daughter said 2 to 8 
 This thing we got is cool like shake 
 I love sunsets but she likes sunrise 
 I'm always running late and she's always on time 
 Well I like hip-hop and she likes raggae 
 So we meet in the middle with some Shattie 
 'Cause she was made for me 
 You gave 'er to me 
 I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you 
 Just right for me and for the life of me 
 I can't believe I get to call her mine 
 And she was made for me 
 Made for me 
 And she was made for me 
 Made for me 
 She is a flower, You are the rain 
 She gets more beautiful with every passing day 
 She is my flower and You are the sun 
 She gets more beautiful because of how You love 
 How You love 
 I get to call her mine 
 I get to call her mine, oh my 
 See she like slow dates and I like fast dates 
 She into books, I'm into movies 
 She made straight As 
 Well I got white skin and she got brown skin 
 But milk and coffee's always been a beautiful blend 
 She was made for me 
 When You gave 'er to me 
 I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you 
 Just right for me and for the life of me 
 I can't believe I get to call her mine 
 She was made for me 
 When You gave 'er to me 
 I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you 
 Just right for me and for the life of me 
 I can't believe I get to call her mine 
 And she was made for me 
 She was made, she was made 
 Made for me 
 And she was made for me 
 She was made, she was made 
 Made for me 
 She was made, she was made for me (I get to call her mine) 
 She was made, she was made for me (I get to call her mine, oh my) >
