Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say 
 Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day 
 Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today 
 And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day 
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night 
 They saw a brand new shining star 
 They heard a choir sing, the music seemed to come from afar 
 Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today 
 And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day 
 Sing na, na, na... Hallelujah 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na... 
 Na, na, na... 
 Sing Hallelujah 
 Na, na, na ey... 
 Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, come to Bethlehem that night 
 They found no place to bear her child, not a single room in sight 
 And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn 
 And in a manger, cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born 
 Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today 
 And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day 
 (x2) 
 Sing na, na, na... Hallelujah 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na... 
 Na, na, na... 
 Sing Hallelujah 
 Na, na, na ey... 
 Sing na, na, na... Hallelujah 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na... 
 Na, na, na... 
 Sing Hallelujah 
 Because of Christmas day
