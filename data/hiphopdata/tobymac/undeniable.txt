There are moments that I doubt You 
 Blind to the beauty that surrounds me 
 I try to push away the need that I'm needin' proof 
 And this struggle that I have, it ain't nothing new 
 But the evidence is piling up, yup 
 You change my heart isn't that enough 
 You give me life that I can't take credit for 
 Call me to walk through an open door 
 Undeniable, You are, You are, You are 
 Unmistakable, You are, You are 
 You're the bright and morning star 
 But still You speak to my heart 
 Undeniable, You are, You are 
 Your work doesn't stop with me 
 Your signature's on everything we see 
 From the hills of Negril, Jamaica 
 To the kid that the doctor said would never make it 
 Which is harder to believe that You don't exist 
 Or that You orchestrated all of this 
 Living in the world that is so confusing 
 You're the argument I'm never losing 
 'Cause I believe 
 Undeniable, You are, You are, You are 
 Unmistakable, You are, You are 
 You're the bright and morning star 
 But still You speak to my heart 
 Undeniable, You are, You are 
 From the hymns that my Daddy sang, 
 I know I was made to glorify Your name 
 And from the prayers that my Momma prayed 
 I know I was made to glorify Your name [x3] 
 Undeniable, You are, You are, You are 
 Unmistakable, You are, You are 
 You're the bright and morning star 
 But still You speak to my heart 
 Undeniable, You are, You are 
 Undeniable, You are, You are, You are 
 Unmistakable, You are, You are 
 You're the bright and morning star 
 But still You speak to my heart 
 Undeniable, You are, You are 
 You're the bright and morning star 
 But still You speak to my heart 
 Undeniable, You are, You are 
 Which is harder to believe that You don't exist 
 Or that you orchestrated all of this 
 Living in the world that is so confusing 
 You're the passion that I'm never losing
