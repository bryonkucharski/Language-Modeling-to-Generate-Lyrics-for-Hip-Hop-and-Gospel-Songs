Momma never said it would be like this 
 I never knew such bliss existed 
 Or maybe it's just so indescribable 
 Love was liable to get her twisted 
 She never told me but if she tried I was a little to young it floated right by me 
 I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me 
 It goes on and on and on and on and on 
 It's over spillin' on me 
 It goes on and on and on and on and on 
 It goes on and on, Yo 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 I refuse to believe we're a dying breed 
 Children of peace, hope and harmony 
 Ordinary folks extraordinary love 
 Something from above 
 Something we fall short of 
 You can't see with an untrained eye 
 But if you take a little time you are sure to find it 
 We complicate something so basic 
 But once you taste it, you gonna chase it like me 
 It goes on and on, Yo 
 It goes on and on 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 A-yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow... 
 A-yo here we go, Love's gonna take us higher 
 A-yo here we go, Love's gonna take us higher 
 This ain't no ordinary... 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 Gonna tell everyone up under the sun 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 This ain't no ordinary 
 Gonna tell everyone, tell everyone 
 Gonna tell everyone, tell everyone 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 It's extraordinary love 
 It's extraordinary love
