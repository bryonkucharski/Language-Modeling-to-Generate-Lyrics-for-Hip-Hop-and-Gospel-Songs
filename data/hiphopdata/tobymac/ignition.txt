Start it up 
 Turn it on 
 We can ride this storm 
 A grip of hope in our hands 
 For the coming dawn 
 Up to our necks in complexities 
 Causing us to pause 
 As we collect our thoughts 
 So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border 
 Take a look around or come test the water 
 We won't stop till we see the morning 
 So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits 
 Turn on, turn on the ignition 
 Everybody 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 Comatose 
 Half-hearted 
 Room temperature's fine 
 Sleep walking, no dream is even filling our minds 
 Earth shaking 
 We be quaking like a wake up bomb 
 This ain't no trouble overseas 
 No Vietnam 
 So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border 
 Take a look around or come test the water 
 We won't stop till we see the morning 
 So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits 
 (Take it up a notch, come on, come on turn it up a notch!) 
 Turn on, turn on the ignition 
 Everybody 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 Come on, come on and turn on the ignition 
 You're sleep walking 
 I'm sleep walking 
 You're sleep walking 
 I'm still talking 
 Come spark the parts in me that all but died 
 Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside 
 Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die 
 Hold up the flag 'cause it's RIDE OR DIE
