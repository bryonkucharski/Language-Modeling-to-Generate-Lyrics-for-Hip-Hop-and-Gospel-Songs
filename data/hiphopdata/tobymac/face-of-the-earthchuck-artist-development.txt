It's been a long time coming 
 Since I saw your face 
 Since we held it down 
 Since we were in the chase 
 It was the road less traveled 
 The path less formed 
 A skinny trail 
 It was barely worn 
 But we kept walkin' 
 And slippin' and talking' 
 And runnin' and fallin' 
 And cryin' and crawlin' 
 We were in the trenches 
 On top of the world 
 Young refugees but we were momma's pearls 
 Where you been dog? 
 Where you been? 
 I thought you fell off the face of the earth 
 I thought you fell, I thought you fell 
 I thought you fell off the face of the earth 
 I thought you fell, I thought you fell 
 It's been way too long and we've come too far 
 For you to drop out of my life like a falling star 
 Right off my radar 
 Not a sign or a trace 
 You know I had love for you that's Bigger than mistakes 
 Now Hope Road is calling 
 Let's pack you up and move 
 'Cause real friends are willing to intrude 
 So I'm gonna push you in because I wanna love you well 
 Let the ghosts of your past rest 
 Open up the door 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 What are you waiting for? 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 Open up the door 
 To life ... 
 Behold I stand at the door and knock 
 If anyone hears my voice and opens the door 
 I will come in ...
