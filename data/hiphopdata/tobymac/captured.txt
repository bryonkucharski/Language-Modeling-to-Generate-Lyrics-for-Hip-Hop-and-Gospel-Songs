All I wanna do 
 All I wanna do 
 I'm Your prisoner by choice 
 I will rest at Your feet 
 And I'll only lift my voice 
 When You want me to sing 
 It's the beauty of Your covering that's stealing my heart 
 And it's the mystery of You that tears me apart 
 If I should die before I wake 
 I pray the Lord my soul to take 
 And if I should get a peaceful sleep 
 I wanna wake at my Father's feet 
 All I wanna do is get into You 
 You got me captured (By Your love) 
 All I wanna do is stay here with You 
 You got me raptured (Can't get enough) 
 Let's go 
 The sun's on the rise 
 The sleep's in my eyes 
 The dew's on the ground 
 The night is disguised 
 There's hope in the air 
 I'm fresh off a prayer 
 The blue mountain bean is clearin' my stare 
 I make recompense 
 It's all makin' sense 
 Like blood in my veins 
 You're my sustenance 
 The moment of trust 
 The "me" becomes "us" 
 The "we" become "one" 
 Your gift is my gust of wind 
 'Til we meet again 
 So faith, don't fail me now 
 If you touch my heart 
 You can feel it pound 
 So faith, don't fail me now 
 So faith, don't fail me now 
 If you touch my heart 
 You can feel it poundin' 
 So faith, don't fail me now 
 So faith, don't fail me now 
 When I touch my heart 
 I can feel it pound 
 Gotta get myself up off this ground 
 Faith, don't fail me now 
 You got me, and You won't let go
