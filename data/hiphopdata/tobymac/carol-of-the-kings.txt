La historia nos ha dado una declaración que sobre vive a los tiempos 
 El villancico de estos reyes hace brillar el alma, 
 Que nos recuerda que el verdadero Rey ha nacido 
 Midnight strikes and awww 
 See them rushing through the stained doors 
 Like kids in a sugarcane store 
 Is this what they stood in rain for? 
 Suddenly, Isle 3 
 Stood a sight so angelically 
 Inhale voice to the sky 
 Hear the bells ring it goes: 
 Hark how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say 
 Throw cares away 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 No panic, no stress 
 Opposite security threat 
 ‘Cause their eyes declared peace be still 
 In the midst of hopelessness 
 On their knees all agree 
 To reconcile to the King of peace 
 Many voices, one plea 
 And you can hear them scream it goes: 
 Hark how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say 
 Throw cares away 
 Gaily they ring 
 While people sing 
 Songs of good cheer 
 Christmas is here 
 So we’re laying down our crowns when the carol bell sounds 
 Now behold the rich and poor 
 Neighboring and distant shore 
 A baby King existing more than 
 A manger in the Inn 
 The source of life for man 
 Whose glory lights the land 
 The remedy for sin in generation and again and again 
 We’re thankful for gifts and the presents but 
 Give us the gift of your presence Sir (please)? 
 ‘Cause we all long to be 
 A symphony of royalty so with this we sing 
 We three kings of Orient are 
 Bearing gifts we’ve traveled so far 
 Field and fountain 
 Moor and mountain 
 Following yonder star 
 And you can hear them scream they said: 
 Woooooooooo 
 So we’re laying down our crowns 
 When the carol bell sounds 
 Following yonder star 
 Christmas is here… 
 So we’re laying down our crowns 
 When the carol bell sounds 
 Following yonder star 
 Feliz Navidad a todos. 
 Recuerden que, el verdadero sentido de la Navidad, 
 Es el nacimiento de nuestro Señor Jesucristo
