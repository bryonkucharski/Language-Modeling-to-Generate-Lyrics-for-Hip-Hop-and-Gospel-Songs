Born is the King, born is the King 
 The first Noel, the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep 
 Born is the King, born is the King 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the East beyond them far 
 And to the Earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night 
 Born is the King, born is the King 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 The love You shared, even scared 
 Oh, the shepherds they were so afraid 
 You flipped it all on that very first Christmas day 
 So I'ma yell Noel on the streets like a newsie 
 And sing Emmanuel till this Earth gotta lose me 
 Born is the King, born is the King 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Noel, Noel, Noel
