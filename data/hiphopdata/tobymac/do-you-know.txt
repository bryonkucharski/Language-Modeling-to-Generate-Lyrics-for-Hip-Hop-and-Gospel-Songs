Do you know where you're going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 This goes out to my man his name is True Blue 
 For all the nights that your Daddy spent away from you 
 For all the days that I told you, "Maybe next time" 
 Laid up in the studio consumed with my next rhyme 
 What kind of lyric can I drop to make you think twice 
 About the trials that you're gonna face in this life 
 I can lullaby even point you to the Most High 
 Prayin' every little thing is gonna be all right 
 Someday, my love isn't gonna be fulfilling 
 Try as I may, human love it hits a ceiling 
 But I can sow the seeds, say a prayer, this I know 
 If faith can move a mountain, surely God can make His spirit grow in you 
 Do you know where you're going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 Do you know where you're going, going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 This goes out to my little man T-Mac 
 For all the junk you've been carrying on your back 
 My burden's easy and My yoke is a featherweight 
 And this you know yet you're still a man of little faith 
 What can I do to spring your knowledge into how you roll 
 Don't you have the spirit and the letters that My people wrote 
 My love stretches farther than your mind can conceive 
 I've got a hand full of grace, a heart full of mercy 
 Someday my son, your gonna find my love fulfilling 
 Hope as I may, you've got to turn in when you're willing 
 I'll take you as you are and just to add a human touch 
 I gave to you a son so you can understand the Father's love for you 
 Do you know where you're going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 Do you know where you're going, going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 Well, God will light your path if you want Him to 
 Just emphasize His lead and your dreams will come true 
 From the father to the son to the multitudes 
 He's the lover of you soul, spiritual, baby do you know 
 Do you know where you're going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 Do you know where you're going, going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Do you know where you're going, going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know? 
 Do you know where you're going, going to? 
 Do you like the things that life is showing you? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Do you know?
