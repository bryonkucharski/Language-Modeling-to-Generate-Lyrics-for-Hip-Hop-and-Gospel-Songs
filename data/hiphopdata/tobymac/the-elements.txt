I lace the boots up, it's straight to the door 
 'Cause this, is worth fighting for 
 I get my head right, the heart's gotta follow 
 Whisper a prayer like there ain't no tomorrow 
 Take a breath, and I exhale slow 
 I wasn't made for this kind of cold 
 This ain't the kind of place that you wanna know 
 These are the elements, I'm telling you bro 
 This world, is up in my grill 
 This world, is shooting to kill 
 This world always gotta be stealing my heart 
 This world always tryin' to rip my family apart (apart, apart, apart) 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 I got spirit, I got faith 
 I might bend but I won't break 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 And I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 This ain't our home, nah, not even close 
 They camouflage like we're fighting some ghost 
 You start to doubt everything that you know 
 I feel the heat and it's starting to show 
 They try to break us, break us, make us wanna give in 
 Lay down our arms, Novocain us again 
 Lay down a fight, I could never relent 
 And I'ma take it all the way to the end 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 I got spirit, I got faith 
 I might bend but I won't break 
 I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements) 
 And I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down 
 Let's go 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Father, God, let me see it for what it is 
 This ain't neutral we're up against 
 These elements push me to the fence 
 And then I end up on top of it 
 If I'm not careful 
 To recognize what is pushing in 
 Open my eyes to these elements 
 Stand up and rise to these elements 
 I'm willing to fight, willing to fight 
 The elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (let's go) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it) 
 Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
