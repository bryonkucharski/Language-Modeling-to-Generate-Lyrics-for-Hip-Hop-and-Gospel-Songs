Raindrops falling off my brim 
 Streetlights got the pavement glistenin' 
 Touchdown, I fall into Your arms 
 Right where I belong 
 Your everlasting arms 
 And where would I be 
 Without You... 
 I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay 
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way 
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away 
 It's true 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 Don't know where I'd be without You 
 (Whoa, without you) 
 Flashback, stepping through the scene 
 There's You and there's a very different me 
 Touchdown, You had me at believe 
 You had me at believe, You did 
 And where would I be 
 Without You, without You... 
 I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay 
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way 
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away 
 It's true 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-uo-ou-ou 
 Don't know where I'd be without You 
 (Where would I be...) 
 (I was so deep, 
 So incomplete 
 Till You rescued me 
 Yeah, You rescued me) 
 You rescued me 
 You are mine, I am Yours 
 You rescued me 
 And I am Yours forever 
 You saved me, remade me 
 And where would I be 
 I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay 
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way 
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away 
 It's true 
 That I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay 
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way 
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away 
 It's so true 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou 
 Don't know where I'd be without You 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou 
 Don't know where I'd be without You
