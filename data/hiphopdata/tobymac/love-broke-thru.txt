I was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze 
 Singin' like a song through the tall oak trees 
 It was just another summer night 
 Had to be the last thing on my mind 
 Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment 
 I was young and runnin' wide open 
 It was just another summer night 
 Had to be the last thing on my mind 
 When love broke through 
 You found me in the darkness 
 Wanderin' through the desert 
 I was a hopeless fool 
 Now I'm hopelessly devoted 
 My chains are broken 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 I did all that I could to undo me 
 But You loved me enough to pursue me 
 Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows 
 Made me believe that I mattered, to You (You) 
 You were there, You heard my prayer in that broke down dusty room 
 It was the first time I said, "I'm Yours" 
 The first time I called You Lord 
 When love broke through 
 You found me in the darkness 
 Wanderin' through the desert 
 I was a hopeless fool 
 Now I'm hopelessly devoted 
 My chains are broken 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze 
 Sang like a song through the oak trees 
 Pennsylvania 
 She kind of caught my soul 
 Which had me a little more open than closed 
 Walls I built 
 Opinions I learned 
 Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned 
 Blind to the arrow that headed to my heart 
 But You hit the mark 
 When love broke through 
 You found me in the darkness 
 Wanderin' through the desert 
 I was a hopeless fool 
 Now I'm hopelessly devoted 
 My chains are broken 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 When love broke through 
 You found me in the darkness 
 Wanderin' through the desert 
 I was a hopeless fool 
 Now I'm hopelessly devoted 
 My chains are broken 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 And it all began with You 
 When love broke through 
 I did all that I could to undo me 
 But You loved me enough to pursue me
