Arrows flying, into silence 
 Broken pieces, lying around where it went down 
 Waters risin', back to silence 
 Quietly crying, wondering how 
 And look at us now 
 We thought our love would take the world by storm 
 Are we too far apart? 
 Two worlds among the stars 
 You're gonna take a piece of my heart if you leave 
 So its two separate ways 
 Or am I too late to say "I wanna fight for what we got 
 'Cause I believe in family" 
 In family 
 So are we still trying, or simply surviving 
 Facing these giants, the bigger they are the harder they fall 
 But I still believe in the dreams we've been dreamin' 
 The hope that we built on 
 It's never too far, never too far 
 If we choose to turn and let these walls fall down 
 Are we too far apart? 
 Two worlds among the stars 
 You're gonna take a piece of my heart if you leave 
 So its two separate ways 
 Or am I too late to say "I wanna fight for what we got 
 'Cause I believe in family" 
 In family, in family 
 I still believe... 
 I still believe... 
 That were not too far apart? 
 Two worlds among the stars 
 Don't take a piece of my heart please don't leave 
 It's not too late to say: "Father show us the way 
 To fight for what we got 
 Cause You believe in family, in family" 
 In family, In family
