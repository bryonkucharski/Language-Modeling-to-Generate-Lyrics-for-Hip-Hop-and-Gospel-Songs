I know this road is gettin' hard 
 I heard you say it's overwhelming 
 I said I'd never be too far 
 And I meant that from the heart 
 I see the mountain gettin' higher 
 I see it stackin' up against you 
 I always said you were a fighter 
 But you've got your doubts tonight 
 But I'm here to remind you 
 It don't matter where you come from 
 I know we can get through this 
 In my feel it's been so long 
 But we keep on keepin' on (Keepin' on) 
 It might feel like an uphill climb 
 Always some kind of battle (Battle) 
 But you got more than you on your side 
 And we gon' see the light (See the light) 
 We gon' see the light (See the light) 
 We gon' see the light (See the light) 
 You and me, yeah, you and me 
 We gon' see the light 
 Some things will never be the same 
 Some things are only for a season (Season) 
 And just the thought of lettin' go 
 Well, it's brought you to your knees (To your knees, to your knees) 
 Oh, but if you can make it, you can make it through the night 
 I can promise that the sun is gonna rise 
 You wake up just a little bit stronger 
 So hold on just a little bit longer 
 'Cause it don't matter where you come from 
 I know we can get through this (Ooh) 
 It might feel like it's been so long 
 But we keep on keepin' on (Keepin' on) (Ooh) 
 It might feel like an uphill climb 
 Always some kind of battle (Battle) 
 But you got more than you on your side 
 And we gon' see the light (See the light) 
 We gon' see the light (See the light) 
 We gon' see the light (See the light) 
 You and me, yeah, you and me 
 We gon' see the light (We gon' see) 
 We gon' see the light (See the light) 
 We gon' see the light (Ho, ah-oh ah-oh ah-oh) 
 You and me, yeah, you and me (You and me) 
 So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from 
 And let your burdens, let 'em fade away (Fade away, fade away) 
 So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from 
 And let your burdens, let 'em fade away 
 (We gon' see the light, we gon' see the light) 
 So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from 
 (We gon' see the light, we gon' see the light) 
 And let your burdens, let 'em fade away 
 (We gon' see the light) 
 So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from 
 And let your burdens, let 'em fade away 
 'Cause it don't matter where you come from 
 I know we can get through this 
 You got more than you on your side 
 And we gon' see the light 
 We gon' see the light
