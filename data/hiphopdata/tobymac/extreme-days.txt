 Extreme Days! 
 (toby) 
 Say we're livin' 
 We're livin', We're livin', We're livin' in extreme day, days... 
 Comin' at ya like a whirlwind 
 A hundred miles an hour's where we'll begin 
 I spy the eye of apprehension 
 Show me risk and you'll get my attention 
 Come on, can ya take it 
 Bang to the bip I make you wanna flip 
 Take my trip and you can bust your lip 
 I never fear 'cause I live fearless 
 Don't even think for a second you can get with this 
 Come on, I never fake it, come on 
 These are extreme, extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin' in extreme days 
 These are extreme, extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin' in extreme days 
 I'm a freak from the 'burbs of the chocolate city 
 Luther Jackson was my middle 
 Pine Ridge my elementary 
 School of hip hop 1979 
 And Sugar Hill had the skills that taught me to rhyme 
 Got hip to Kiss and I tripped on Zeppelin 
 So Mr. Therapist-Why did I go this direction 
 God had a plan to end all my schemes 
 I had a dream He said to be ... extreme 
 Come on, can ya take it 
 These are extreme, extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin' in extreme days 
 These are extreme, extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin' in extreme days 
 Extreme days 
 Just the other day I saw a kid 
 Who flipped his hat to the back and he called it a lid 
 You know what else he did? 
 He stacked books from the floor to the ceiling 
 Said somethin' bout trying to get to heaven 
 And he was only eleven 
 But he climbed to the top with outstretched arms 
 And he screamed at the top of his lungs 
 These are extreme days 
 Move out my way 
 Give up the mic 
 X to me is extremely Christ 
 Livin up in me 
 Like it or not 
 Put an X on my chest 
 Cuz X marks the spot 
 We're livin', we're livin' 
 These are extreme, extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin', we're livin' 
 These are extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin', we're livin' 
 These are extreme, extreme days 
 We're livin' in extreme days... 
 We're livin' in extreme days... 
 We're livin' in extreme days... 
 We're livin' in extreme days...

 Extreme days!
