Father God, I am clay in Your hands, 
 Help me to stay that way through all life's demands, 
 'Cause they chip and they nag and they pull at me, 
 And every little thing I make up my mind to be. 
 Like I'm gonna be a daddy whose in the mix, 
 And I'm gonna be a husband who stays legit. 
 And I pray that I'm an artist to rise above, 
 The road that is wide and filled with self love. 
 Every thing that I see draws me, 
 Though it's only in you that I can truly see 
 That it's a feast full of eyes - a low blow to purpose. 
 And I'm a little kid at a three rink circus. 
 I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul! 
 I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul! 
 Don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say. 
 The paparazzi flashes and that they think that it's you, 
 But they don't know that who you are is not what you do. 
 True, we get it twisted when we peak at the charts, 
 Yo before we part from the start where's your heart? 
 You a pimp, hustler? tell me what's your title, 
 America has no more stores now we call them idols, you sit idle, 
 While we teach prosperity, 
 The first thing to prosper should be inside of me. We're free! 
 Not because of 22's on the range, 
 But Christ came in range we said yes now we changed. 
 Not the same even though I made a fall, 
 Since I got the call, no more Saul, now I'm Paul. 
 I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul! 
 Don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say.
