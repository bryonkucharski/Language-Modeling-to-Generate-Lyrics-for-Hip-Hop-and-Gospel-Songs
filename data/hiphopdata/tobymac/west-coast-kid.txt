 (Paul) 
 Yo I'm a West coast kid, 
 Livin' in Nashville 
 Moved here in the summer when I got my record deal 
 Plan to make a mil' but I've only sold a thousand 
 So I relocated to low-income housing 
 I'm all about singing the blues, 
 Take a walk in my shoes 
 You can see my point of view 
 Country folk on the back porch, pickin' banjos, 
 Grams and Gramps are bustin' a move with the dosey-doe's 
 Paul (and Toby) 
 It's all hip-hop to me yeah 
 (It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 It's all hip-hop to me all right 
 (It's all hip-hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 It's all hip-hop to me 
 (I'm a grab my guitar) 
 (It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 It's all hip-hop to me so tight 
 (It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 Paul (and Toby) 
 (And I'm a grab my guitar) 
 (And play you this song) 
 (And all the people come on now)

 And I'm a East coast kid 
 Livin' in Nashville 
 Moved here in the winter when I got my record deal 
 Started with some vinyl and a mic in D.C. 
 Suburban little punk with an urban degree 
 I'm all about makin' some noise 
 And givin' people a choice 
 Long as I'm hearin' God's voice 
 All my folk on the back porch 
 Tru, me, and Moses, 
 Mandy, Marley, ain't it sweet how it grows, 
 Sweet how it grows, 
 Sweet how it grows us 
 Paul (and Toby) 
 It's all hip-hop to me yeah

 (It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 It's all hip-hop to me so tight 
 (It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me) 
 My mother used to sing me rhymes 
 (Sing me rhymes) 
 When she put me to sleep 
 (C'mon, c'mon) 
 I wonder if she realized, 
 She was sowing seeds 
 (Sowing seeds) 
 And now they're growing growin' 
 Growing to the sky 
 (To the sky) 
 And now I'm flowin' flowing 
 (Flowin') 
 Flowing on this mic 
 (What ya got, c'mon, what ya got, what ya got) 
 It's all hip-hop to me 
 (What you want, what you want, what you want, what you want, what you need) 
 It's all hip-hop to me 
 (What you want, what you want, what you want, what you want, what you need)

 (Free your mind and free your soul) 
 (Listen to the rhyme in stereo) 
 (Turn the music up so that you can hear a sweet sound coming down) 
 (Loud and clear make a simple melody) 
 (And we lay it down, put it all together make a brand new sound) 
 (Maybe it's a symphony or maybe just a melody) 
 (It really doesn't matter 'cause)
