I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go 
 Why's it always circumstantial? 
 Never any real potential 
 Obvious and so sequential 
 It always ends the same 
 Holding out with all that's in me 
 Is it worth all this pretending? 
 A story with an ugly ending it's never worth the pain 
 So right here and now I am all in 
 'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am 
 And I'm holding on to everything You are 
 I'm letting go of everything I once was 
 I'm all in 
 I'm fallin' into Your arms again 
 I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go 
 Can we just wait out the weather? 
 I could stay right here forever 
 Got to get myself together 
 Real life is on the way 
 Call it my foregone conclusion 
 I'll always welcome Your intrusion 
 You're the master of my choosing 
 I'm all Yours 
 'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am 
 And I'm holding on to everything You are 
 I'm letting go of everything I once was 
 I'm all in 
 I'm fallin' into Your arms again 
 I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go 
 'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am 
 And I'm holding on to everything You are 
 I'm letting go of everything I once was 
 I'm all in 
 I'm all in 
 I'm fallin' into Your arms again 
 This time I'm so for real 
 It's time I sealed the deal 
 Shut down my lame appeals 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 I'll throw caution to the sky 
 Kiss all my fears goodbye 
 This time its do or die 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am 
 And I'm holding on to everything You are 
 I'm letting go of everything I once was 
 I'm all in 
 I'm all in 
 'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am 
 And I'm holding on to everything You are 
 I'm letting go of everything I once was 
 I'm all in 
 I'm fallin' into Your arms again 
 I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go 
 I'am letting go
