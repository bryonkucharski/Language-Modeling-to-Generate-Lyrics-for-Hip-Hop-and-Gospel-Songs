Somebody said you better let go, 'cause they said so 
 But I could never let this thing go 
 Don't they even know what that means 
 They call me obscene, say I wear my faith on my sleeve 
 But I ain't here to seek no glory, end of story 
 I know the judge and the jury 
 People always gotta ask who, what, when, and why 
 But never wanna step to the light 
 So I hear you say you wanna come and get some 
 Should I mention I got your attention 
 Know that I'm a man on a mission 
 My position is momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got, we've got momentum 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll, we've got some more 
 We've got the momentum for sure 
 Livin' on the edge of obnoxious, they call me raucous 
 I'm a freak, I can't stop this 
 Ardently enthused about God 
 No hand-me-down nod, you're gonna get all I got 
 High-steppin' from the twenty on in, knees to my chin 
 I'm rollin' deep in momentum 
 Burnin' with the hard core flame, no shame in this game 
 I'm followin' my heart not my brain 
 So I hear you say you wanna come and get some 
 Should I mention I got your attention 
 I know that I'm a man on a mission 
 My position is momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got, we've got momentum 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll, we've got some more 
 We've got the momentum for sure 
 Well we been on a roll, 'cause we got souls that won't die 
 And this party ain't over 'til we take flight 
 You've been told that we come bold on this side 
 You ain't never known the dilly 'til we testify 
 'Cause have you ever heard of turnin' water into wine 
 And have you ever heard of givin' sight back to the blind 
 It's undeniable we're droppin' the truth on this track 
 'Cause once you start an avalanche there ain't no turnin' back 
 So I hear you say you wanna come and get some 
 Should I mention I got your attention 
 I know that I'm a man on a mission 
 My position is momentum, baby 
 So you say you wanna come and get some 
 Should I mention I got your attention 
 I know that I'm a man on a mission 
 My position is momentum 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got, we've got momentum 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll, we've got some more 
 We've got the momentum for sure 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got, we've got momentum 
 Been on a roll for two thousand years or so 
 We've got momentum, baby 
 Been on a roll, we've got some more 
 We've got, we've got momentum
