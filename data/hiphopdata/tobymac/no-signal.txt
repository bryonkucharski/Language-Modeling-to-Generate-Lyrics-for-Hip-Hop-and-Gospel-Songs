I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway, 
 Waiting for a storm to pass before we take 
 Off, I just wanna get home, Lord, 
 I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone. 
 I got my wife and my kids waiting for their daddy, 
 At the baggage claim, Lord, I miss my family, 
 I just wanna get home, Lord, 
 I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone. 
 I just want to wake up, talk to the morning sun, 
 Kiss my Mandy on the cheek, grab some breakfast and run, 
 I love my family, Lord, bless my family, 
 Please tell my family I'll be home soon. 
 I love my kids, y'know they love their dad, 
 And I'm with them no matter where I'm at 
 So they know, I love my family, Lord, bless my family, 
 Please tell my family I'll be home soon. 
 I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway, 
 Waiting for a storm to pass before we take, 
 Off, I just wanna get home, Lord. 
 I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone. 
 (This is your captain speaking, and we are clear to take off.)
