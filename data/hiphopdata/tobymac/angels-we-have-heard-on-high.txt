Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be? 
 Which inspire your heavenly song 
 Gloria, (Gloria), Gloria 
 Sing merrily, shout joyfully, sing merrily, shout joyfully 
 Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess you alone are God, ah 
 See Him in a manger laid 
 Whom the choirs of angels praise 
 Mary, Joseph, lend your aid 
 While our hearts in love we raise 
 The greatest expression of love ever shown 
 Happened on this night 
 When the angel appeared to the shepherds and said, 
 "Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
 Which shall be for all people 
 For unto you is born this day 
 In the city of David 
 A Savior who is Christ the Lord 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Emmanuel 
 The word made flesh 
 Lamb of God 
 Sing praises to His name" 
 (Gloria) 
 Come let us adore 
 For unto us is born 
 A Savior who is Christ our Lord 
 Emmanuel, Elshaddia 
 Singing praises to the Lord most high 
 Our King of Kings and Lord of Lords 
 Sing Gloria 
 Gloria... 
 Shout joyfully to the Lord 
 My soul does magnify you 
 Holy is the Lord 
 The mighty One of Israel 
 And You alone are God 
 And You have done great things for us
