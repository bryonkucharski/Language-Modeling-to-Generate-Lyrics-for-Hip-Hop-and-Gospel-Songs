A little something like, a little something like 
 A little something like this 
 A little something like, a little something like 
 A little something like, a little something like this 
 I clear my throat before I grab the mic, I need uno memento 
 Them cynics gonna ride me like a pinto 
 No resentment do you comprehend my innuendo 
 You still can't leave the party till you drop your crucial info 
 Am I jaded in assumin' that you're simply bound to do me 
 Like them other lyricists who's message ain't so gloomy 
 Pan my positivity, 'cause love has let you down 
 'Cause if they taste the love you tasted 
 They'd be making sweeter sounds T 
 Government checks they flex with no dollars 
 Two turntables and a plate full of collards 
 Royalty checks reflects with few dollars 
 But my DJ makes the people wanna holler 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Mama always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house the house is packed 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Daddy always said that I wish I was black 
 And when love is in the house the house is packed 
 Packed like a baby nine months in the womb 
 Man it was packed like the closet full of Nike's in my room 
 Singin' "Oh sweet Lord take me to the next level 
 Where the love's much thicker than the stares of my devils" 
 So whether or not this is a dream or reality 
 Let me appeal to the graces of His majesty 
 Amazin' it will be when this tree bears life 
 My roots run to the river and the Giver of Life 
 Corporate jets they flex with big dollars 
 Two palm pilots and a room full of bawlers 
 Royalty checks reflects with few dollars 
 But amazin' grace makes the people wanna holler 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Mama always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house the house is packed 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Daddy always said that I wish I was black 
 And when love is in the house the house is packed 
 Woke up this morning, I didn't know what to do 
 There was people all around me tellin' me to sing the blues 
 Said they ain't seen no happy since 1992 
 Then they turned to me thinking I'd agree and I offered this humble view 
 Well now sing 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Mama always said it's a matter of fact 
 That when love is in the house the house is packed 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 So much so I left the back door cracked 
 Daddy always said that I wish I was black 
 And when love is in the house the house is 
 C'mon, na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 Sing, Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing 
 Love is in the house and the house is packed
