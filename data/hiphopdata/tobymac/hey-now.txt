Hey now, I feel a new one comin' on so that you can sing along with it 
 Right now and I'm gonna dedicate this song to everyone of God's children 
 Hey now, one love, one God out of many his people 
 Right now it's been a long time comin' but I'm serving up the sequel 
 Back from the day, I'm the sleeper done slumbering 
 Pass me the mic and I might stop mumbling 
 Crumble like a cracker, I'll fall like a leaf 
 But the hole in my soul's been filled underneath 
 So whether you're a loser or a winner by the numbers 
 Everyone knows a tie goes to the runner 
 So lace up your shox, get yourself in this race 
 Cause this little thing here gonna set a new pace 
 Sometimes we do it like this, sometimes we do it like that 
 Sometimes we say it with words so you can see where we at 
 And on a different level I persist to reach a girl or any fella 
 I believe we receive a little then we all do better 
 Hey now, help is coming anyday now 
 Hope it can reach me when I am way down 
 One love, one God and I'm ok now 
 Ten years, TOBYMAC and GRITS stay down 
 What you think of this here, gotta get with this here 
 Diverse City, are you gonna get it this year? 
 What you think of this here, gotta get with this here 
 Diverse City and we'll run it till He gets here 
 Get your back up off the wall 
 Live a little, come on 
 Get your back up off the wall 
 Everybody come on 
 One love, one God, I feel a new one comin' on so that you can sing along with it 
 One love, one God, and I'm gonna dedicate this song to everyone of God's children 
 One love, one God, one love, one God out of many his people 
 One love, one God, it's been a long time comin' but I'm serving up the sequel 
 One love, one God
