Watch baby, watch baby 
 I got it like that 
 Watch baby, watch baby 
 So I got it like that 
 Suggestions, questions 
 People want to know 
 Is there life after talk 
 'Cause there's talk on the road 
 Twistin' words that I've never even said 
 To the ones that I trust on my 
 Or my "Boo" in our bed 
 Will he make it? Man I bet he won't 
 As they're runnin' through the minutes on their cell phones 
 So the pictures painted, you got the point 
 And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint 
 Sometimes I feel God 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the cool of the shade 
 In the bright sunlight 
 I always feel like somebody's watching me 
 (Watch baby, watch baby, he got my back) 
 See I'm down with the King 
 So I got it like that 
 I always feel like somebody's watching me 
 (Watch baby, watch baby, he got my back) 
 See I'm down with the King 
 So I got it like that 
 It's no joke, I've been roped in, chokin' on a bone 
 From a fish in the school of your twilight zone 
 You shook me, took me to me to another place 
 Where the air I'm breathin's like mace in my face 
 If this controversy is your way 
 You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny 
 'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a a Son of the Light 
 Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight 
 Sometimes I feel grace in the middle of the night 
 In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight 
 Sometimes I feel God in the midst of a show 
 As the palm trees sway in an afterglow 
 I always feel like somebody's watching me 
 (Watch baby, watch baby, he got my back) 
 See I'm down with the King 
 So I got it like that
