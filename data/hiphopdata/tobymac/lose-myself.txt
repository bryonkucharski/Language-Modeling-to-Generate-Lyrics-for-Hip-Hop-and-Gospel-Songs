Take all of the good and all of the bad 
 'Cause all of it's on me 
 Take all of my ways, the things that I chase 
 The things that control me 
 And all that I hide, could you bring me to life? 
 Could you open my eyes and show me? 
 Take all that was me and shape it to be 
 Reflecting you soully 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you 
 I don't care how it sounds 
 Burn it up to the ground 
 Your kingdom, my desire 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find 
 To find you 
 (I need to find you/I need to find you) 
 As all of the fates, I'll be on my way 
 The wreckage behind me 
 My feet on the ground, Two hands reaching out 
 The future is blinding 
 So what is stirring in you? May you stir up in me 
 All the dreams that you placed inside me 
 Take all that you see and shape it to be 
 The story you're writing 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you 
 I don't care how it sounds 
 Burn it all to the ground 
 Consume me with your fire 
 I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find 
 To find you 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Do not hide your face 
 Do not hide your face from me 
 Please don't hide 
 I'm gonna lose myself, lose myself to find 
 To find you 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 I need to find you... 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Do not hide 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Do not hide 
 I need to find you... 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Do not hide 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Do not hide 
 So do not hide your face from me 
 Please don't hide your face
