You turned away when I looked you in the eye 
 And hesitated when I asked if you were alright 
 Seems like you're fighting for your life 
 But why, oh, why? 
 Wide awake in the middle of your nightmare 
 You saw it comin' but it hit you outta nowhere 
 And there's always scars 
 When you fall that far 
 We lose our way, we get back up again 
 It's never too late to get back up again 
 And one day you gonna shine again 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 Lose our way, we get back up again 
 So get up, get up, you gonna shine again 
 It's never too late to get back up again 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 (May be knocked down but not out forever) 
 You rolled out at the dawning of the day 
 Heart racin' as you make your little get-away 
 It feels like you've been runnin' all your life 
 But why, oh, why? 
 So you pulled away from the love that would've been there 
 And start believin' that your situation's unfair 
 But there's always scars 
 When you fall that far 
 We lose our way, we get back up again 
 It's never too late to get back up again 
 And one day you gonna shine again 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 Lose our way, we get back up again 
 So get up, get up, you gonna shine again 
 It's never too late to get back up again 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 (May be knocked down but not out forever) 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 Out to the broken 
 This is love callin' 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 Out to the broken 
 This is love callin' 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 I am so broken 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 We lose our way, we get back up again 
 It's never too late 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 We lose our way, we get back up again 
 So get up, get up, you gonna shine again 
 It's never too late to get back up again 
 You may be knocked down but not out forever 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 (Lose our way, we get back up again) 
 Out to the broken 
 This is love callin' 
 (It's never too late) 
 (You may be knocked down but not out forever) 
 This is love callin' love callin' 
 (Lose our way, we get back up again) 
 Out to the broken 
 This is love callin' 
 (It's never too late) 
 (You may be knocked down but not out forever) 
 This is love callin', love callin' 
 Out to the broken 
 This is love callin'
