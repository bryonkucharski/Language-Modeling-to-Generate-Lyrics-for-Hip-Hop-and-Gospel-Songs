I've played in L.A. and D.C., Manhattan and Sydney 
 And Kingston, Jamaica where my Mandy was made 
 It's 98 degrees in the straight-up shade 
 I say I'm stickin' with her for the rest of my given days 
 "Somebody told me that you're takin' a break 
 A sabbatical from rhymin' on the records that you make 
 A little birdie said that wasn't the case 
 They blamed your exodus on "DC" partners Kevin and Tait" 
 "Hold up, I didn't say all that" 
 I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day 
 I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade 
 So if you're wonderin' why I 
 Continue to try my 
 Skills at this rap game 
 Girl, I can't get enough 
 I been rockin' the black folks 
 And tellin' those white jokes 
 And people are people 
 So just throw your hands up 
 If you're wonderin' why I 
 Continue to try my 
 Skills at this rap game 
 Girl, I can't get enough 
 I been rockin' the church folks 
 And tellin' those same jokes 
 So all of God's people 
 Won't ya throw your hands up 
 I've been away for some down time 
 But thought it was 'bout time 
 To give my freaky people what they came here for 
 I guess I needed some head space 
 And felt that by God's grace 
 My homosapiens would still be up for some more 
 I'm talkin' God in my hip-hop 
 If not, then my show stops 
 And everyone around me knows I ain't gonna sell -out 
 To those bad guys, they pushin' them white lies 
 Tweak the word freak and you'll be airing tonight guys 
 So if you're wonderin' why I 
 Continue to try my 
 Skills at this rap game 
 Girl, I can't get enough 
 I been rockin' the black folks 
 And tellin' those white jokes 
 And people are people 
 So just throw your hands up 
 If you're wonderin' why I 
 Continue to try my 
 I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day 
 I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade 
 I wanna give my people what they can't deny 
 I wanna light up the skies like the Fourth of July
