From the lips of desperation 
 Different nations, every man's cry 
 Comes a song of anticipation 
 As we wait for a crack in the sky 
 Side by side, we recognize that 
 Hope has brought us together tonight 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Break open the sky 
 Won't You turn off gravity so we can fly? 
 We wanna see Your face 
 So tear the roof off this place 
 Jesus, break open the sky 
 So we sing 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 We believe, and we imagine 
 'Til the dawn of our beautiful dreams 
 Through the noise, I hear the voices 
 Melodies that are flooding our streets 
 Not forgotten, are your people 
 So let a thousand church bells ring 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Come, Jesus, come 
 Come quickly 
 Come quickly 
 Break open, open the sky
