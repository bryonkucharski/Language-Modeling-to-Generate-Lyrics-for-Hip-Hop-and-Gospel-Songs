She dialed him about 6:00 PM 
 She checked her hair in the mirror 
 And she stepped through the door like this 
 Three flights down 
 And she's out on the streets 
 Walking brick sidewalks lined in grey concrete 
 He saw her coming from a few blocks away 
 Red scarf in the wind as it started to rain a bit 
 Shuffled down the boulevard 
 Cut me like a deck of cards 
 I thought you had me 
 You thought that you had me 
 But hey, Devil, go on 
 Get your junk out of here 
 I don't need you 
 I don't need you 
 Hey, Devil, go on 
 Get your junk out of here 
 I don't need you 
 So move on 
 I stepped to it like I knew what I was doing 
 I'm a moth 
 You're the flame 
 Never knew you'd be my ruin 
 In the blink of an eye 
 Element of surprise 
 Got my feet on the earth 
 But my face to the sky 
 Shuffled down the boulevard 
 Cut me like a deck of cards 
 I thought you had me 
 You thought you had me 
 Now the plot is thickening 
 Pushing deep under my skin 
 I thought you had me 
 You that that you had me 
 You're a beauty and A beast 
 You're the pressure never cease 
 You're the straight other side 
 And they say you never sleep
