You got me feeling so fly 
 There ain't a day that goes by 
 A supernatural high 
 Oh my goodness - people I can't deny 
 You got me feeling so fly 
 Uh oh, here we go again 
 Talking about that thing that so genuine 
 Uh huh, gonna make it known 
 So a freak like me get his cover blown 
 Can't help but glorify my Adonai 
 Gotta testify 
 Uh oh, here we go again 
 Talking bout His love so genuine 
 This ain't no fire drill 
 It hits like Holyfield 
 Break out your freak appeal 
 You think you know the deal 
 I'm gonna show you what's for real 
 There ain't a day that goes by 
 That I'm not singing Your praise 
 There ain't a day that goes by 
 That I'm not lifting your name 
 A supernatural high 
 Your love is simply insane 
 You got me feeling so fly 
 So fly when it's You and I 
 And the way we hanging in the morning time 
 And it's so dope I can barely cope 
 When you make my joy go and overflow 
 I can't help but glorify my Adonai 
 It's so fly that it's blowing minds 
 So fly that they can't deny 
 There ain't a day that goes by 
 That I'm not singing Your praise 
 There ain't a day that goes by 
 That I'm not completely amazed 
 A supernatural high 
 Your love is simply insane 
 You got me feeling so fly 
 Knock, knock 
 Who's there? 
 Well it's me, TMac 
 Feeling fly as a kangol hat 
 Insecticides can't steal this shine 'cause 
 The fly I feel is straight divine
