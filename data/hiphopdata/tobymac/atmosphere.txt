I know you keep a journal and every page is rippled 
 From the tears that you cry, ain't no meanin' to your scribble 
 Cause words can't describe what you've been feelin' inside 
 It's like thousand foot walls, and they're still on the rise 
 But look up to a beautiful sound 
 And see for yourself you're not that far down 
 And know this, I cannot love a little 
 My promise to you is unconditional 
 And I'll keep the light on, baby 
 Just keep the course, you can weather the storm 
 I'll keep the light on, baby 
 You've come this far, don't you ever lose heart, now 
 Just turn around and I'll be there 
 I'm moving into your atmosphere 
 Just turn around and I'll be there 
 I'm moving into your atmosphere 
 I know you're all alone in a crowd full of friends 
 I can see it in your eyes that your fadin' again 
 Checking out, moving into your hole 
 Where the light can't touch any part of your soul 
 But hold up and let the river rush in 
 You can turn around and start livin' again 
 Cause your life is a beautiful bloom 
 In the image of the one that created you 
 I'll be there 
 Said I'll be there, said I'll be there 
 Said I'll be there always, forever
