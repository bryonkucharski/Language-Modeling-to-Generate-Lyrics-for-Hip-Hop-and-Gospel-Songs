I heard Your name but never seen Your face 
 Been touched before but never Your embrace 
 Had a soul to lose and the world to gain 
 But then You whispered my name 
 And I heard the truth but never from Your lips 
 Bought the lies of many counterfeits 
 Dreamed my dreams but they were never in color 
 And I searched for You in many others 
 I was down for the count 
 Then I saw Your face 
 Just a glimpse of Your face 
 And my whole world changed 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 Changed forever now 
 Then I saw Your face 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 It's a whole new game 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 Yours forever now 
 If I could reach the stars, I could touch the sky 
 And if I spread my wings, I could almost fly 
 I had everything paper could buy 
 I was lost in my disguise 
 And if I played my role, they would feel my style 
 If I bought the night, they would buy my smile 
 I've been runnin' this game for a million miles 
 Believin' my own lies 
 I was down, I was out 
 Then I saw Your face 
 Just a glimpse of Your face 
 And my whole world changed 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 I'm Yours forever now 
 Then I saw Your face 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 It's a whole new game 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 Yours forever now 
 Then I saw Your face 
 I was blinded by my selfish dreams 
 Everything ain't what it seems 
 From inside to out, there ain't no doubt 
 I been changed 
 Nothing short of satisfaction 
 Your love caused a change reaction 
 I can tell You this much, I felt Your touch 
 And I'm changed 
 When I was down for the count 
 Your love surrounded me 
 Blink of an eye 
 I saw my destiny 
 Change rearranged 'cause I couldn't maintain 
 The heart it took to even stay in the game 
 One look in Your eyes, even I realized 
 A fellow like me had been put down to size 
 To be built up in a better way, Your way 
 Your way ain't about to fade 
 Bombastic, ain't no way to mask it 
 I saw Your face and my old ways blasted 
 Then I saw Your face 
 Just a glimpse of Your face 
 And my whole world changed 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 I'm Yours forever now 
 Then I saw Your face 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 It's a whole new game 
 Then I saw Your face 
 And I was changed forever 
 I'm Yours forever now 
 Then I saw Your face 
 Just a glimpse of Your face 
 And my whole world changed 
 Then I saw Your face 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 It's a whole new game 
 I'm Yours forever now 
 Yours forever now 
 I'm Yours forever now
