Another cold night 
 Another late flight 
 It's almost show time, and Diverse City's waitin' on me 
 We got a packed house, the crowd is callin' out 
 They want the beat to drop, but what we really need is You 
 If You wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch You go 
 If You got somethin' to say, go on and take it away 
 Need You to steal my show, can't wait to watch You go 
 So take it away 
 So now the crowd is hype, that you showed up tonight 
 Anticipatin', cravin' somethin' more than smoke and lights 
 So I'll step out the way, I'll give You center stage 
 Alight 
 Spotlight 
 Give 'em what they came for ... 
 When You arrive, we come to life 
 Our hearts collide, they're beating in the same time 
 You're comin' through, all eyes on You 
 Our hearts collide, they're beating in the same time, beating in the same time 
 No matter who we are, no matter what we do 
 Every day we can choose to say ... 
 My life 
 My friends 
 My heart 
 It's all Yours, God 
 Take it away 
 My dreams 
 My fears 
 My family 
 My career 
 Take it away 
 Take it away 
 It's all Yours, God 
 Take it away 
 Take it away 
 It's You I wanna live for
