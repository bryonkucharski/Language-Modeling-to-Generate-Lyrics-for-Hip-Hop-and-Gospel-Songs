Call it a reason to retreat 
 I got some dreams that are bigger than me 
 I might be outmatched, outsized, the underdog in the fight of my life 
 Is it so crazy to believe 
 That You gave me the stars, put them out of my reach 
 Called me to waters a little too deep 
 Oh, I've never been so aware of my need 
 You keep on making me see 
 It's way beyond me 
 It's way beyond me 
 Yeah, it's out of my league 
 It's way beyond me 
 It's way beyond me 
 It's way beyond 
 Anything that I got the strength to do 
 In over my head keeps me countin' on You 
 I'm leaving the sweet spot, sure shot 
 Tradin' it all for the plans You got 
 Is it so crazy to believe 
 That You gave me the stars, put them out of my reach 
 Called me to waters a little too deep 
 Oh, I've never been so aware of my need 
 Yeah, you keep on making me see 
 It's way beyond me 
 It's way beyond me 
 Yeah, it's out of my league 
 It's way beyond me 
 It's way beyond me 
 You take me to the place where I know I need You 
 Straight to the depths that I can't handle on my own 
 And Lord I know, I know I need You 
 So take me to Your great 
 Take me to Your great unknown 
 It's way beyond me, w-way beyond me 
 It-it's way beyond me, w-w-way beyond me 
 Yeah, You gave me the stars, put them out of my reach 
 Called me to waters a little too deep 
 Oh, I've never been so aware of my need 
 Yeah, you keep on making me see 
 It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me) 
 It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me) 
 Yeah, it's out of my league (it's way beyond me) 
 It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me) 
 It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me) 
 It's way beyond me 
 You take me to the place where I know I need You 
 Straight to the depths that I can't handle on my own (it's way beyond me) 
 You take me to the place where I know I need You 
 Oh take me to Your place 
 Take me to Your great unknown
