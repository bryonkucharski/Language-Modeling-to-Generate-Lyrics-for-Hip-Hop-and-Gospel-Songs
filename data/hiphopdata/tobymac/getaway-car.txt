I'm staring unaware 'cause I'm in the zone 
 It moves in like a fog on a seaside road 
 Paralyzed by the signs and the deafening tone 
 I'm on a lock like a jock with a broken bone 
 I can see the real game and I want to get in it 
 I can read your headline and I am dying to spin it 
 Man down in the clutches of his own desire 
 I got to find the kind of speed that will put out a fire 
 I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far 
 I need a getaway car, I wanna flea what I see, wanna be where you are 
 I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far 
 I need a getaway car 
 I put my hand on the wheel before I change my mind 
 I put my foot to the floor and I start to fly 
 I keep my eyes on the road so I don't get spun around 
 To the nightmare I've been delivered from 
 It's a brand new day, I drove hard all night 
 I thank God for the sun as it starts to rise 
 I take a peek in the mirror and my past is gone 
 I'm feelin' free as a bird with a new song 
 Now I ain't gonna stop till I find your peace 
 I gotta get to the place where it's you and me 
 So fill'er up now, and let's roll 
 Gonna drive through the night till you touch my soul 
 Said I ain't gonna stop till I find your peace 
 I gotta get to the place where you're all I need 
 So fill'er up, let's roll 
 I'm gonna drive through the night till you touch my soul 
 Let's ride all night, let's shift this thing into overdrive
