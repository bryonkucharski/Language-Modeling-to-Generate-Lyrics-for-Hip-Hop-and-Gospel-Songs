Slackin' off like a bum, I'm feelin' ho hum 
 I'm feelin' luke warm like the water in my tub 
 Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not 
 We had that fire like we was boilin' in a pot 
 Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy 
 Come, we gonna catch that 
 Fire, I'm feenin' for a flicker 
 Then we'll fan the flame up into something bigger 
 Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not 
 We gonna catch a fire, catch a fire for God 
 Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy 
 Come, we gonna catch that 
 Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy 
 Come, we gonna catch that 
 Fire, takin' it from warm to hot 
 Fire, gotta give it all we got 
 Fire, whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy 
 Come, we gonna catch that 
 Spark to a flame, I'm flippin' up my game 
 I caught the fire and I'll never be the same 
 So unexplainable I can't contain it, son 
 And my retaining it would only be a shame 
 So let me hear you say 
 Heat, like the Kingston concrete 
 There ain't no stoppin' the fire 
 We're straight breakin' ground 
 There ain't no cooling this thing down 
 We burnin' up and keep'n it krunk as we know how 
 Hear me now people 
 Catch a fire let it burn within 
 Catch a fire let it burn for him
