God's in the Spot, you can like it or not 
 So rip the knob off the volume when you give it a shot 
 And raise your hands as the slam starts to thicken the plot 
 Openin' eyes to the lies of the enemies' lot 
 So run like the wind from the sin of your past 
 Keep your eyes on the prize when they put you on blast 
 It's the Christ on the cross, it's humanity's shot 
 It's a worldwide call to everything that we're not 
 This is the slam, this is the one (God's in the spot, you can like it or not) 
 This is the slam, this is the one (We gonna bring it like it ain't been brung) 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna do it like it ain't been done before 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna spring you like you ain't been sprung 
 They came from the cities and towns all around 
 To see the longhaired preacher from the desert get down 
 Waist high in water, never short on words, he said 
 "Repent, the kingdom of heaven can be yours" 
 But he stopped in the middle of his words and dropped 
 Down to his knees and said, "Behold the Lamb of God" 
 He's the one, the slam, don't you people understand? 
 You're staring at the son, God's reaching out his hand 
 This is the slam, this is the one (God's in the spot, you can like it or not) 
 This is the slam, this is the one (We gonna bring it like it ain't been brung) 
 (We gonna bring it like it) 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna do it like it ain't been done before 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna bring it like it ain't been brung 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna do it like it ain't been done before 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna spring you like you ain't been sprung 
 The father slammed it like Shaq 
 For Latinos and Blacks 
 Packin' them straps 
 And Caucasians hooked on Ecstasy and the crack 
 Stacked the sins of this world to his body 
 And conquered evil and hell 
 Then snatched the keys of death in one breath and unlocked the cell 
 He rose on the third 
 I'm tellin' you partner, it's actual fact 
 Just like tobyMac and Boney Soprano up on this track 
 We Slam dunkin' and keep it jumpin' like jumper cables 
 And keep the crowd rowdy like Jesus tossin' them temple tables 
 (This is the slam, this is the one) 
 This is the slam 
 We slammin' the gym with the remedy of libery like it ain't never been done 
 This is the one 
 Gonna represent it and tell the people all that he's done 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We slammin' the gym with the remedy of libery like it ain't never been done 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 Gonna represent it and tell the people, tell the people, tell the people 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna bring it like it ain't been brung 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 This is the slam, this is the one 
 We gonna bring it like it ain't been brung
