Silly me, silly me, aye 
 Revertin' back to my old ways 
 Them got to be in control days 
 Jump before I pray 
 Yo, I'm headed out the doorway 
 But I want Your way, Yahweh 
 From dirt roads to highways 
 You're showin' me a beautiful view from this backseat 
 But there's lots of room and I never would have seen it if I wasn't rolling with you 
 Hollyn: 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over) 
 I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 You got the wheel, take me where You wanna go 
 My heart is Your's, no matter where we roll 
 TRU: 
 Been backseat my whole life 
 Now I turned 16 so it's time to drive 
 Buckle up, TRU behind the wheel 
 Got my iPhone bumping like (dom da dom) 
 GPS locked and the map was set 
 Thought I had it all right till the road went left 
 Spinning outta control in this Coupe de Ville 
 Now I'm sittin' shotgun, Jesus take the wheeel 
 Hollyn: 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over) 
 I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 I'm putting my trust in You, putting my trust in You 
 It's a little bit overdue, but I'm putting my trust in You 
 (3x) 
 It's a whole new journey, a brand new path 
 And Imma fix my eyes so I won't look back 
 Tame this beating heart in my chest 
 Cause everything in my wants to jump ahead 
 So light it up, up 
 Don't let it fade 
 Light it up, up 
 Show me the way 
 Light it up Lord, just like You do 
 No second guessin', Imma move with You 
 Hollyn: 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over) 
 I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord 
 I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver 
 (2x)
