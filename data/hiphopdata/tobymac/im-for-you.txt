Tell me where its hurting 
 Are you burning? 
 Running just to catch your breath 
 And going nowhere 
 It's getting old when you feel like you got nothing left 
 Well it ain't over till it's over 
 I told you since the day we met 
 So let me be the voice through all the noise 
 Whatever I gotta be 
 I'll be for you 
 Whatever you need from me 
 To see you through 
 Everyone of us has stumbled 
 Everybody's humbled 
 We hit the ground and our lives crumble 
 Whatever I gotta be 
 I'll be for you 
 I'm for you 
 If you never knew 
 If you never knew 
 I'm for you 
 You know it's true 
 I know the feeling 
 I know it's real when the drama's all in your face 
 You see a mountain 
 I hear a promise - it's never more than we can take 
 Well it ain't over, till it's over 
 We can learn from our mistakes 
 So let me be the voice through all the noise 
 Everyone of us will fall 
 Have our backs against the wall 
 And everyone shares a need to be loved 
 You've always been for me 
 So I will be for you 
 That's just what it means to love 
 Whatever I gotta be 
 I'll be for you 
 I'm for you 
 If you never knew 
 If you never knew 
 I'm for you 
 You know it's true 
 Whatever I gotta be 
 I'll be for you 
 I'm for you 
 If you never knew 
 If you never knew 
 I'm for you 
 You know it's true 
 Everytime you fall, I'll be for you 
 If you back's against the wall, I'll be for you 
 'Cause you've always been for me, I'll be for you 
 I'll be for you, I'm for you 
 If you never knew 
 If you never knew 
 I'm for you 
 I'm for you, like your for me, like I'm for you 
 I'm for you, like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you 
 I'm for you like your for me, like I'm for you 
 I'm for you like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you 
 I'm for you like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you 
 I'm for you
