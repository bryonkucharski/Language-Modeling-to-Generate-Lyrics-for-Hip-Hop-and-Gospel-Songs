Fresh air, (sigh), 
 Is what I needed 
 I ventured through my door 
 Proceeded 
 Into the streets of this place 
 I had to lower my shades to shield my face 
 Still squinting from the glare 
 What I saw was unfortunately rare 
 I rolled upon a variety 
 The sight that moved my heart 
 Deep inside of me 
 I heard some cats rockin' mics 
 Saw mad stunts on BMX bikes 
 Sons and daughters 
 Standing for their rights 
 A city scene lit 
 Well through the night 
 Tilted trucker hats with tats 
 Hittin high hats 
 Pinstripe sellard suits 
 Invested mad beats 
 Truth 
 Distinct how we live it 
 Many members but only one spirit. 
 Individualized 
 You're on the same side 
 Separated vehicals 
 Huh! 
 We still ride 
 Well we bring it from nice to gritty 
 Read the sign kid, Diverse City.
