Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that 
 I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat 
 I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up 
 And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up 
 My past is taking me to task and I can't guarantee 
 How much longer I'll last 
 Without you I'm a hopeless wreck 
 So I cry out your name as I drop to the deck 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up again 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up 
 Simple minded little punk, thought I was the junk 
 Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk 
 What was I out of my mind or was I just trippin' on an ego 
 But you filled up the space and you never let me go 
 Bullseye to the center of my soul 
 One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow 
 This love was your gun, mercy your shells 
 Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 Don't get me started, don't even get me started 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up again 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up 
 Give me 
 Give me more 
 Give me 
 Give me more 
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot 
 Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops 
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot 
 Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot 
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot 
 Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got 
 Shout it from the rooftops like it or not 
 Shout, shout 
 Shout, shout 
 Shout, shout 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours 
 I'm a dead man walkin' down the boulevard 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up again 
 I'm yours, take me as I am 
 I'm yours, so won't you take this space 
 Between us and fill it up 
 Take this space between us and fill it up again 
 Take this space between us and fill it up 
 Take this space between us and fill it up again 
 Take this space between us and fill it up 
 Take this space between us and fill it up again 
 Take this space between us and fill it up 
 Take this space between us and fill it up again 
 Take this space between us
