All you rappers gonna wish I never got in the game 
 'Cause when I get my first hit, everything fina change 
 The whips and slang, medallions on yo platinum chains 
 From the art of spitting to darn near everything in between 
 Move around now, get up and dance now 
 Get out ya chair, get on the floor 
 Go on and bounce now, I move crowds like security guards 
 Plus I'm hard as it gets, even when I'm reppin my God 
 So everybody in the building wave ya hands and get down 
 From the inner city's and suburbs to them country cow towns 
 I'm stacking chips like Doritos and casino tables 
 And pushing whips like 'em valet's at them record label's 
 Move around now, get up and dance now 
 Get out ya chair, get on the floor now, go on and bounce now 
 Life is good when ya blessed wit all the finer things 
 Got piece of mind, from the grind, plus 'em diamond rings! 
 Shake ya body like ya got the holy ghost now 
 Shake ya body like your shivering 'cause it's cold out 
 Shake ya body got the wiggle in your soul now 
 Shake ya body what, shake ya body what 
 Who could it be, on the M-I-C y'all ain't gotta tell me 
 Everybody in the club is fond of me, 'cause how I rock 'em beats 
 I ain't R&B, and all of you haters just a bunch of punk wanna be's 
 I don't, pack a piece, 'cause I'm 'bout the peace 
 Even though you suckas wanna try to pull and squeeze 
 Well goin' release, I ain't scared, I'm on my knees 
 I'm a really keep it real with the Jesus piece 
 I got y'all tripping pimping, by the way that I be ripping spitting 
 All of these lyrical styles that got the crowd jumping 
 Over a beat that's hitting, hitting, chicken, grits, and catfish 
 Love it wit a side of greens and beans in my dish 
 You know it's all good when I slide through the hood 
 'Cause I represent my people the way that a playa should 
 Et love from all the homies in the red and the blue 
 Mexicanos y cubanos and 'em white boys too 
 I stay true to the game, I ain't new to the game 
 Still keeping it gospel and prey, when I, rip the mic 
 'Cause I'm dynamite, like JJ 
 Then all the people tell me show ya right 
 It's on tonight, I know you love the way I write 
 And I'm a make all of the rappers wanna die tonight 
 Still holy ghost filled, freed from sin 
 I keep it holy plus I make the bread, got that water 
 That will never ever wanna make you thirst again 
 And I'm psycho when I grab the pen 
 Make miracles happen when I'm up in the vocal booth 
 And everybody always tripping 'cause I spit the truth, to reach the youth 
 You suckas better call a truce, or I'm a have all of you rappers shaking in ya boots 
 You'll probably never catch me packing a knife 
 But I'm cutting rappers to death with all the words that I write 
 The truth and the light, is what I'm representing tonight 
 By the end of the night I'll have the crowd ready to fight 
 So throw ya hands up, throw ya hands up, all my people if ya wit me go on and stand up 
 Making inspirational music for 'em killas and thugs, tell 'em to 
 Put away them heaters, stop slanging 'em drugs 
 Got get them, gangstas and riders, make songs 
 Trying to get inside, tired of, hearing all 'em sirens 
 Can I, get a moment of silence, sick of the violence 
 Murders, and burglars, and curb servers, concerning 'em burners 
 Ya better believe they concern us, they con earners 
 With the gift to gab, ready to stab, used to be conscious 
 Now they conscious has gone bad, they living really hard 
 And quick to pull ya card, don't make me holla, dogg 
 I'm bout to get my bodyguards
