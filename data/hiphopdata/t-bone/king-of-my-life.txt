Glory to the King of my life 
 Only You are holy 
 You are the life in me 
 You are the light that shines inside of me 
 All praise and glory to Your name 
 I will give to You my life 
 And anythin' that You require, oh Lord 
 I'm givin' all praises up to the lion of Judah 
 Alpha, Omega, plus the El Shaddai 
 Elohim, Yahweh, Messiah, Y'shua 
 What about the Adonai? 
 Somethin' about the name, Jesus 
 That makes me go insane, Jesus 
 Saved my soul from burnin' flames, Jesus 
 And He broke them devils' chains, Jesus 
 Glory, glory, how are You doin' to me, not bein' worthy? 
 You could have saved Your son, Jesus Christ 
 Instead You sent him for me 
 He gave His life for a sinner like me, threw my sins in the sea 
 He died, He died, He was dead but He rose in three 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 He is alive, He is alive 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 Only You are holy 
 Surrenderin' my will 
 Desirin' You to fill me with Your love 
 I live to serve my livin' King 
 Only I bow, please show my how 
 To love the world the way You love 
 Me givin' praises and honor, glory, thanks unto the King of kings 
 Whose precious blood is more than cars 
 Houses and diamond rings 
 Give Him praise and raise your hands 
 And magnify Him with the song and the dance and a 
 Give Him praise with the harp and the microphone 
 Tambourines, cymbals, drums and the xylophone 
 Gotta give Him praise, gotta give Him praise 
 For the things that He did when He walked onto Calvary 
 And died on the cross, when He took my place 
 He is alive, He is alive 
 Giving all honor and glory 
 Unto the King of kings and the Lord of lords 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 He is alive, He is alive 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 Only You are holy 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 He is alive, He is alive 
 Glory to the King of my life 
 Only You are holy 
 Giving all praise to the most high God 
 The Father, you know what I mean?
