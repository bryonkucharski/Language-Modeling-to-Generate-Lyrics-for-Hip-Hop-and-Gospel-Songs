I show ya how to do it now homie, 'cause it's ok 
 Got the Spirit all over this music, put all of the guns away 
 I keep it gully for the streets and gangstas, but I'm trying to make a change 
 'Cause there's too many of my dogs and comrades, homies done passed away 
 Coming up in my early days, I was raised around blacks and esés 
 And thugs with short tempers that are quick to spray 
 Then throw up a gang sign reppin' they set 
 I'm from the west man, this about as hard as it gets 
 The projects saturated wit drugs and dealers 
 And the streets consist of the guns and cold killas 
 It's bad enough man the odds are against me 
 And homies in the hood just wanna bang and smoke hemp trees 
 They say the only way for me to push Bentleys 
 Is ride and bust bullets till the whole clip empty 
 All these demons slowly trying to tempt me 
 "You'll never make a difference, Bone" yeah but God sent me to 
 Revolutionize the style that your youths do 
 And reach all of the gangstas in them khakis and zoot suits 
 Came to try to make some of you open your eyes 
 And realize what really happens homie after you die 
 Will the killing ever cease? It's like we got a sick disease 
 That makes us, pack a piece, in these cold heart streets 
 Gotta break the generational curse 
 Hurts to see these young brothers getting hauled off in a hearse 
 What's worse, we promote it though songs and movies 
 We banned the Passion of the Christ, but endorse glocks and Uzis 
 Then we wonder why are kids is dying, bullets flying 
 Gangsta's riding and gangs multiplying 
 At such fast rapid rate 
 Could it be all the heroes man kind create? 
 We teach our children how to murder in these video games 
 So all they do is imitate what's inside of their brains 
 'Cause to them all of the killing is cool 
 So they pack in the backpacks then shoot up the school 
 And then leave them other children wounded and dead 
 Then realize what they did and turn the gun to they head 
 Raised in a dangerous place where thugs pack heat, creep 
 Throw up 'em blue flags, C-walk to the beat 
 Blast from the jeep and leave you in the back of your seat 
 Face down in a pool of blood resting in peace 
 Mark of the beast is plotting trying to leave us deceased 
 Bullets flying throughout our neighborhoods roaming the streets 
 It's a war zone where we living, partners dying 
 And got collect calls from tha prison twice a day 
 Inside the land of the murderers, crooks and armed burglars 
 Pimps, and curb servers, and golden state warriors 
 That say you gotta be ready to die, you gotta decide 
 Could be facing 20 to life 
 In a 6 by 9 cell, in jail wit no bail 
 Just waiting to get mail where destiny is hell 
 You shoulda known gangstas never retire 
 It's blood, blood out, homie, devil's a liar
