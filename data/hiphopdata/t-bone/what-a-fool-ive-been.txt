Lonely days gone by without you in my life 
 Even though I've tried so hard I do 
 Don't forget what you learned along the way 
 Talk to him and keep him close to you 
 I've lived dangerously 
 Not noticing at all what I quickly could become so soon 
 He is always there 
 He's always been around 
 You will see Him when you change your view 
 What a fool I've been 
 What a fool I've been 
 Just to think that I 
 Can live my life 
 Like time is on my side 
 I could not see through all the pain I caused 
 I was lost for my sin blinded me 
 We serve a great God 
 For when we turn away 
 He remains so faithfuly close to you 
 What a fool I've been 
 What a fool I've been 
 Just to think that I 
 Can live my life 
 Like I would never die 
 What a fool I've been 
 What a fool I've been 
 What a fool I've been 
 What a fool I've been
