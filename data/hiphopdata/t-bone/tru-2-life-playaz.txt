Kinda like tha mafia if you ask me, who's that? 
 All of them ridas from ORC, why's that? 
 'Cause we bad like 3 strikers when we spit rhymes 
 And preach to street bikers or convicts in rockers 
 There never ain't no telling what we gonna do 
 'Cause when you think we through, we come back and bless you 
 Doing another hit, ain't no stopping me and my gang 
 Boneybone Corleone from the MTV to cut fame 
 Same rapper and same rider, Westsider 
 Only difference is my beats and rhymes tighter, that's real 
 Now throw in the sky if you down with me 
 I represent that organized rhyme family 
 Family tree consist of demon killas, reaching drug dealers 
 And top billas making scrilla, living in white villas 
 Using guerrilla tactics to reach Crips and Bloods 
 And all the thugs that are looking for love 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders 
 From tha land of Chuck Taylors, khaki wearers and gang bangers 
 Where rap singers low ride and rap about 'em colored bandannas 
 Ducking from one time, California sunshine 
 Projects and streets infested with thugs that are doing major crimes 
 Prime time couldn't paint a better picture 
 Best beware of them locs and O.G.'s before them thugs hit ya 
 'Cause where we from it's straight scandalous, Los Angeles 
 Ain't too many players or riders that can handle us 
 Slugs flying in every direction you look 
 Got homeless people living under bridges and drug addicts hooked 
 Ain't this a shame, that's why me and my gang preachin' 
 Like deacons to Bloods, Crips, Latinos, and Puerto Ricans 
 Every weekend we be speakin' and preachin', teachin' 
 How we need to be reachin' tha heathens, sleepin' while the devil's creepin' 
 Meetin' to put these suckers' names on contracts 
 And lift up and raise up the King of Kings like a car jack 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders 
 We makin' moves like a U-Haul 
 Playa haters don't get it twisted like RuPaul 
 We don G's and family, that stick together like Siamese 
 Twins and Chinese steam rice from Chang Lee's 
 I'm the Bone Corleone with Lucky Luciano 
 Danny Brasco and Mr. Kevin Blanco 
 E-Doggie Montana from Nicaragua 
 And my little patna that we be calling Jimmy Hoffa 
 Can't forget about Chase Gigante 'cause when I rhyme say 
 He makes them beats bomb bay, hot like picante 
 This is the clique that I be talking about 
 And if you ain't down with us, then back up before you get clowned 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders 
 We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz 
 Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters 
 Making rider music strictly for the Creator 
 With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders
