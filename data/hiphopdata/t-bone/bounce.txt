This is strictly for them low low's, el Caminos and Chevrolet Impalas 
 Bouncing from California all the way to Nicaragua 
 Sixteen switches, rides is vicious 
 Bouncing like bad checks, Candy Apple, licorice 
 Twirling a hundred spokes, this one's for my folks 
 Blacks, Filipinos, Caucasians, Latinos 
 Gotta know the rules when you up in this game 
 If you want a piece of the street, fast and furious fame 
 Then yo, 
 mira

 Juice it up wit hydraulics then 
 brinca lo 
 Blast this in the fosgate and let the speakers blow 
 In the, Escalade, then escapade, like Janet 
 To the car show, pump the breaks 
 Take first place, smile, then collect the cake 
 Call up the homie E-Dogg, then it's time to shake 
 Bounce, bounce 
 Cadillac trucks and jeeps 
 From the Bronx to the Compton streets 
 For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeah) 
 Now everybody bounce

 I been know to bring the heat to the instrumental, check the credentials 
 My fundamentals essentials for reaching killas and thug generals 
 In the street where they packing the heat, creep 
 Throw up 'em gang signs and C-walk to the beat, strictly 
 Preaching the word to those smoking the herb 
 Sharing the real for 'em dealers serving crack on the curb, swerve 
 To the left then I scrape my plates 
 Now I'm dipping hopping initiating sparks on the interstate 
 Feels so great in the Golden State 
 Cool breeze from the ocean on the Golden Gate 
 I can't wait for the weekend, we can make it a date 
 Motorola 2 way the homies, tell 'em meet me at eight 
 At the studio so we can blaze the track 
 Like Kobe and Shaq, with back to back platinum tracks 
 We ain't quitting y'all, yo we bringing the heat 
 Like Pacino and Luchiano for the thugs in the street 
 Bounce, bounce

 Hypnophonic music! 
 Drop 'em clean 'em lace 'em up with rims and bangin' systems 
 Now if ya feeling what I'm saying throw ya hands in the sky 
 Party people from California all the way to Hawaii 
 ATL and South Beach where the mamis look fine 
 To the streets of Spanish Harlem for my peeps in NY 
 Mexicano o cubano, panameño, columbiano, argentino, chileno, nicoya o puertorriqueño 
 Yo, it don't really matter, this a T-Bone party 
 So throw ya hands up in the sky, mama move ya body 
 No Bacardi, Hennessey, Chronic, beer or Chocolate tie 
 Why? 'Cause this is how we do it when we naturally high 
 Now watch me rock like Nirvana, what up mama 
 I'm the don dada known to mix it up like Santana
