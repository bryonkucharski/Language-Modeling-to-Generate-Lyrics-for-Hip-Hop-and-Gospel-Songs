I know the world got you down 
 Bound by the problems and troubles of life 
 Full of strife pain and misery 
 Lookin' for true peace love and happiness 
 That you can't find in a drugs 
 Sex or hennessey but come along wit me 
 If ya wanna hear 'bout the one that healed the sick 
 And made the blind see 
 The one that turned water into wine 
 And multiplied the loaves and the fishes 
 Healed the lady wit the issue of blood and cured leprosy 
 'Cause even when your friends ain't there 
 And you feelin' like nobody cares 
 God's still there ready to cast all your burdens away 
 Let Him in your heart this very day and I pray 
 That every lyric I spit will penetrate 
 The very depths of your soul 
 And I'm gonna let the whole world know 
 He can make your sins white as snow 
 Now let me bust en espanol, para mexicano, o cubano 
 Panameno, colombiano, argentino, chilleno 
 Nico, ya puerto ricano, lo que to te enseno 
 Es algo que me ensenaron de pequeno 
 Wit this instrumental I'm gonna make you get sentimental 
 'Cause I be knowin' that your feelin' what I'm talkin' bout 
 Make ya wanna shout shout, let it all out out 
 Like tears for fears, I'm tryin' to reach my peers 
 And the thugs playas in the clubs and my patnas slangin drugs 
 Duckin 'em slugs lookin' for love 
 In a messed up world that's cold like a freezer 
 That's why until the day I die I'm gonna preach 
 The Word of God like the man of God they call Peter 
 Mira ahorita you might be goin' through 
 A thing or two but know that Jesus still loves you 
 So it's all good playa wipe your eyes 
 'Cause Jesus said that everything is gonna be all right 
 Now come on down 
 Problems, troubles trials and storms will come your way 
 Jesus offers love and wants to wipe yours tears away 
 'Cause even when it seems like nobody really cares, Jesus is there 
 And he hears your prayers and he hears your prayers 
 Don't cry the Lord replies 
 I wanna wipe the tears from your lonely eyes 
 It's gonna be all right 
 Tonight you might be goin' throught some things 
 But joy comes in the mornin time 
 And I pray that through this rhyme 
 I'm touchin your mind 
 Body and soul let Him take control 
 And I know that if you trust in God, 
 Leave your problems in his hands 
 Then everythings gonna be all right 
 (T-Bone) 
 Your cryin in the night 'cause you're lonely 
 Prayin' to the Lord above please hold me 
 Somebody told me 
 That when I'm feelin' broken hearted, 
 Sad and lost in the valley 
 You're the one to console me 
 Slowly ease the pain that I be feelin' deep 
 Within free me from the life of sin 'cause 
 I'm tired of all the bangin' 
 Drug slangin and playin' wit the girls 
 Smokin' weed and sippin on the gin 
 I need a real friend who wont leave me nor forsake me 
 Even if the whole world hates me who makes me 
 Feel like I'm somebody special for once in my life 
 When all my foes wanna lie and playa hate me, 
 I seen so much drama throughout my life 
 So many of my peers died and I wonder why 
 I never got to say goodbye look to the sky 
 And pray that the Lord hear my cry 
 They say that You can set me free take away this pain 
 And misery and deliver me from the hands of the enemy 
 All because of the blood that You shed at calvary 
 You gave me the gift of eternal life and now I finally see 
 That You're the answer to all my needs so I'm down on my knees 
 Beggin Lord please forgive me 
 From this day forward I promise 
 To follow where ever you lead 
 Wipe my tears Lord
