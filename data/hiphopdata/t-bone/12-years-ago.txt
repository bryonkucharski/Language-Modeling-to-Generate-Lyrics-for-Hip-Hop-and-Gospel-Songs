12 years ago, a friend of mine 
 Asked me to spit these MC rhymes 
 So I said this rhyme I'm about to say 
 The beat was dope, and it went this way 
 Well my name is T, from the golden state 
 They call San Andreas 'cause I cause earthquakes 
 Been rhyming on the mic since the age of 8 
 The fans and the people tell me that I'm great 
 Y'all can hate, but they relate, trying to get all of you walking through them pearly gates 
 I been to city's all around the globe, Nicaragua 
 Australia down to Tokyo, Lima Peru and London back to San Tropez 
 When I'm in Paris France pale vu France 
 Seen me on TV and on big screens 
 Now I'm crushing MC's like they jelly beans 
 Now get both of them hands in tha air 
 And wave 'em all around like in around like B-Boys in flair 
 We bringing the noise, and a raising our voice 
 Plus I keep it old school like the Beastie Boys. 
 I had to take this rhyme back to the 80's 
 When rap was bout skills DJ's and the ladies 
 Didn't rhyme about sex and degrading themselves 
 And rappers didn't glorify busting em' shells 
 This is a hip-hop blast from the past, stop 
 All the violence put away all the straps 
 Better enjoy the music 'cause it's not gonna last 
 If we keep on glorifying all the killing and gats 
 The milies and Mac's the chronic and hash and the cats slanging perico on the corner for cash 
 We gotta try to make a change for the better, and stop 
 Selling out for the fame and the cheddar, put down berretta 
 Quit throwing up letters 
 I'm trying to make a difference it ain't getting no better 
 That's why I came to represent for all of my people 
 Wit conscious rap Chico, 'cause it's almost illegal
