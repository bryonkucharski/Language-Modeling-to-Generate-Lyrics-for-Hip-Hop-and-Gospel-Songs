I'm trying to change this music, my nizzle 
 It's official, I'm tired of hearing heaters that whistle and sizzle when gangstas pull out they pistols 
 I'm like money trying to get in the middle and settle the difference 
 'Cause too many rappers is tripping, don't nobody wanna listen 
 Plus I'm tired of all the cussing and cursing 
 So I started rehearsing working on converting a better version 
 For every person that's hurting lurking searching for life's purpose 
 Feeling suicidal and worthless but you ain't certain 
 If you ready to die and leave this earth's surface then cross over 
 And see what's on the side of this life's curtain 
 Call me the Moses of rap, taking it back to tha days when this artifact 
 Wasn't 'bout the woman and gats 
 I'm sick of this rap, matter a fact 
 How many more women you find to pimp, and gangstas we gonna cap 
 We murdered them all, Pac and Biggie there ain't here anymore 
 Better do something, sound the trumpet, 'cause I'm goin' to war 
 To all the playas popping off at the lip, oh 
 Fronting the street game like you a pimp, no 
 Ya coming up but going down wit tha ship, bro 
 Ya better let that thang go 
 And all tha ladies that be shaking they hips, oh 
 Up in tha strip clubs stacking 'em chips, no 
 Top of tha world, but you down in tha pits, ma 
 Ya better let that thang go 
 It's the Nicaraguan son of Big Pun, who flip tongs 
 On kick drums, and leave rappers like victims from big guns 
 Better panic, 'cause I'm charismatic and automatic 
 When it comes to this phonographic magic, I gotta have it 
 Like an addict, I'm the magnet pulling these Asiatic and Hispanics bandits 
 To make 'em put down tha cannons, I'm standing for unity in rural communities 
 Filled with darkness and cruelty, where men get woman paid off of nudity 
 It's soon to be all over, I crossover barriers of hate and racism plus I bring the Cross over 
 I'm out to change all the images in our villages, and all the religious criticisms from church citizens 
 Always pointing, judging, shrugging ya shoulders at the adulterers, fornicators, and cobras 
 But never question our culture, Biggie prophesied ready to die 
 50 took 5 and got rich and Pac's mamma still crying 
 Suckas surfing the internet trying to find kids for sex, and placing bets 
 Credit card fraud is next, they write them checks for chicks on 'em porno flicks 
 When they shake they hips sick wit them chain and whips it gets 
 Even worse, truth hurts, don't be mad at me, I ain't the one getting paid enhancing they anatomy 
 And gradually, they rotten out like bad cavities, then periodically prostituting and armed robberies 
 This how we raise the little children of America to grow up and be criminal, rapist, and bomb terrorist 
 From the second they're born, innocent but torn 
 Between these 2 worlds fighting for souls, like tug a war 
 Who's keeping score got juveniles in the morgue, while killas winning awards 
 And steady and praising the Lord, they cheer and roar 
 Ego tripping has gotta stop, gotta shine and rhyme in his name instead of hip-hop 
 How many more of our people gotta die 
 Before we decide, genocide isn't only in war 
 It's also in the words that we write 
 We got tha power 
 I keep it gully like a Cali general running the streets, ya freeze when I speak 
 Memorized my style is unique, we bringing the heat like the Bahamas talking the word 
 From Nicaragua to communist countries like China, Iraq and Havana, canta lo, Godson levanta lo 
 They lace the beats then I rock the flow, she hit them notes 
 Collab then we rock the show, think we blessed 
 No doubt, count the dough, we make about oh 25-30 a show 
 People flying from other countries just to hear tha Bone flow 
 Sick wit the skills to the point that they wanna honor me 
 But I'm not honoree I'm on the Rock like Sean Connery 
 And y'all fond of me, the rest is just wanna be's
