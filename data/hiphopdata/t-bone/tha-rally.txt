MC's, DJ's, B-boys and Beat Makers 
 I'm speaking to all of y'all 
 The time is now, it's our time! 
 It's time for us to pick up tha ball and run with it 
 To rise up and rhyme for what we believe in 
 We believe in "live and let live" 
 We believe that what we're doing is right 
 And right will always win against wrong 
 We been doing this thang so long, singing tha same old song, 
 We couldn't do nothing but get strong 
 Ah, don't look at me like crazy 
 Think about it, even Tech and Sway be trying to wake you up from they radio station 
 A sleeping nation and generation 
 Wake up and smell the coffee. 
 I'm calling out to all the disenfranchised, blacks, whites, Asians and Latinos 
 Join me in this fight against corruption in entertainment 
 Politics, religious rituals and music 
 I say stop all the violence, stop all the cursing 
 Stop all the killing, and lets become one in this conscious state of hip-hop
