Why can't y'all leave me alone 
 Man seem like everybody be judging me 
 Talking behind my back, faking the smiles then hugging me 
 Pointing fingers hating jealous of my success praying for my downfall 
 Can't handle me being blessed, naw 
 You'd rather see me at the bottom of the totem poll 
 Scraping for dollars, on the edge bout to lose control 
 Back on the corner still living in tha projects 
 Still struggling down and out wit no prophets 
 Still driving through the hood in a bucket 
 I'm bout bringing my people over like I'm Harriet Tubman 
 Been through the fire like Kanye West 
 Beat the odds now I'm on shuffles and ipods 
 See most of y'all could never reach stature 
 'Cause half of you gangsta rappers is gangsta actors 
 And backstabbers y'all got the game backwards 
 But Bone and Darkchild make hits like linebackers 
 Can I live 
 If you wanna be in my shoes then get in 
 You can talk the talk 
 But ain't lived the life I live 
 So can I live, that's the question, can I...(2x) 
 I shed blood sweat and tears 
 Been on this grind for years 
 I'm at the top of the charts, no respect from peers 
 I could be the franchise still I'm chastised, spreading ya lies 
 Need to recognize there's two sides, my whole life been the underdog 
 Against the odds back still against the wall 
 Fighting to represent in the ring for God 
 Consciously making records for a different cause 
 This crab game keep pulling me down, but like Ron Artest been known to rebound 
 And like Roy Jones I'm pound for pound spitting a different kind of message over platinum sounds 
 Can I, get some love and a little respect 
 Can I, rock ya world without giving ya sex 
 Can I, live in peace man I paid my dues 
 You'll never know where I been until ya walked in my shoes 
 I'm in it for the long hall 
 Committed to the end like John Paul 
 I'm trying to make a change, throw stones if I'm wrong 
 If you can do it better, then by all means, shoot for the stars 
 But stop crushing all of my life's dreams, and let me fulfill my destiny and purpose 
 Quit trying to make me feel no good and worthless 
 This life is all a playa got to give, so back up and give me room to breath can I live
