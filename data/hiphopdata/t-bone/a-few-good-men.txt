Strap up the boots, I'm ready to shoot 
 Load the ammo, Bone Soprano wit glocks and green camo 
 I play rappers like they grand pianos, a general 
 Call shots like I'm Joe Bonanno, what, The West is back 
 Sep this dude ain't black, he Latino dogg and rock Gringos 
 Black, Indians, Palestinians, and Phillipinos, and cash money like Vegas casinos 
 I'm armed and ready, palms is sweaty, kinda like em 
 Sep I got a sharp machete, and I'm quick to toss wack rappers of a levy 
 Words is heavy, kinda like a 6-4 Chevy, uh 
 Hip-Hop will never be the same, it's time for change 
 I'm bout to rearrange the game, ready to fight back 
 So when they say who's that, tell 'em it's just the king of the conscious rap 
 See all we need is just a few good men 
 'Cause ain't to many left like Bone and Mack 10, 
 We know nobody's perfect, so repent for ya sins 
 So ya better get it straight, 'cause he's coming again 
 (Whisper) He's watching 
 Mack 10 - 
 I got the hood on smash homey 
 And though I'm ballin' full throttle 
 I'll never run outta gas homey 
 I'm so fly as the days go by I'm better 
 So I dump re-up and keep getting more cheddar 
 You know what it do 
 Mack 10 a savage 
 Got hustle in my veins so I fiend for the cabbage 
 Fresh baller to the end 
 Tell a friend and a neighbor 
 Ain't that I got so much flavor 
 It's that I got so much favor 
 I'm like Pac I get's down, against all odds 
 And you don't wanna go to war with a child of God 
 So if you see me in a six four 
 Tuck ya pistol 
 Plus it's on if ya miss 
 So be careful what ya wish for 
 A rhyme sayer wit respect like the mayor 
 Plus your arms is to short to box wit God playa 
 See I'm all for Jesus but I'm nothing like Mase 
 I'm to ghetto and gutter 
 But I'm covered in his grace, yeah!
