What's happening big baby? 
 It's the Boney Bone Corleone back up in your face 
 Man, Ephesians 4:29 says, "Let no corrupt communication proceed 
 Out of your mouth, but that which is good for the use of edifying 
 That it may minister grace unto the hearers" 
 And that's exactly what I am going to do on this track mang 
 This one going out to all the pimps, hustlers 
 All them thugs out there trying to live that crazy life 
 Man P Game on this track partner, this one for you 
 When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 I be that lyrical miracle spiritual eating these demons like a cereal 
 Redeemed criminal, to say the minimal 
 I got the feeling though even all left in the circle 
 The pain ain't gonna be, 'cause you let me go 
 I got subliminal messages in my mind telling me to kill myself 
 And if I want to be rich to go 
 Saying lyrics to die on the line for the wealth 
 But that's when I felt Holy Ghost come upon me 
 Trying to call me, tell me the Devil want to rob me 
 But God want to draw me 
 Plus, through Him enough to other been through 
 Not unless He wanna call me 
 I don't want to fall G so I gotta pray every day 
 And it's got to keep all the playa haters away 
 And even when I don't feel like raising my hands 
 I gotta do it anyways 
 'Cause I don't live by the feeling 
 Let me tell you about Christ heathen 
 He saved me while I was hanging on the streets 
 With the pimps and thugs 
 My deal was drug dealing and stealing 
 So now I be killing them unexpected spirits 
 That trying to get me to turn away 
 From the path of the Lord, 'cause the Lord is my Savior 
 But the Devil want to see my soul decay 
 That's why I gotta stay, in the Word of God 
 'Cause there ain't no demon in hell gonna hold me back 
 As long as I keep my mind and heart concentrated 
 Uh, I know he got my back 
 But the thing is the bigger the harder the trial to overcome 
 The bigger the blessing is when I get to heaven 
 So don't give up when you going through a trial 
 Got a smile even through the hard times 
 'Cause here's why, I'm trying to let you know 
 That you ain't alone 'cause I been there too 
 And in the end I'm going to let you know 
 That Jesus Christ chrome be the only one that stick 
 'Cause I put my frame, so now I put down my pen 
 When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 I had disappointments in my life, I ain't gonna lie 
 Sometimes I wanted to take my own life 
 But thanks be to Jesus Christ 'cause He showed me 
 He could relieve with the truth and the light 
 So now in the night, when the Devil trying to tell me 
 There ain't nothing worth living for 
 I tell 'em get back Satan 'cause you is lying 
 In the name of Jesus I'ma leave a word tag on your toe 
 How you gonna do that? I'm going to put on 
 The full armor of my God, if you know what I mean 
 No I don't, okay well get the cage of he 
 And be the thing read Ephesians 6, 10 through 18 
 Now strap on your bullet proof vest 
 What, that be the best bet of righteousness 
 Why I need this? 'Cause the Devil ain't playing homeboy 
 He gonna try to throw all these rounds to the chest 
 Coming out the west, he naive the Devil 
 Got a stick that'll make me bleed 
 But hold up, I'm the one with the Devil, let you show soul 
 How he gonna leave them holes like a donut 
 Take off in the thrower, my gang sign 
 'Cause I'm down with the O R to the C 
 And if you didn't know that Boney bone be 'bout it 'bout 
 It just like that homie named Master P 
 Come along with me if you want to hear about the one 
 Who healed the sick and made the blind see 
 The one who changed water to wine, the multiple fishes 
 The lady with the issue of blood to cure leprosy 
 And who can it be, coming with the lyrical side 
 You ain't never heard before like this? 
 Try to member this, it's the only I dis 
 'Cause the way of preaching thugged out with a gangster twist 
 When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 Chilling with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 When I was chillin' with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa' 
 Chillin' with my homies slanging drugs 
 Lounging with the players and the thugs 
 I used to make that skrilla 
 But now a demon killa'
