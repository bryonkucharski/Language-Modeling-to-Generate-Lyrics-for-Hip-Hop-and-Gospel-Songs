(Mayhem) 
 I snatch the mic and rock and spit rhymes that make the world stop 
 And wanna-be MCs shed tears like Tupac 
 Stabbin my soldier in the back, but you sittin' on the bench 
 Shut yo mouth about my man, 'cause I'll come to his defense 
 I gotta drop thang upon your feel 
 So in this next line Mayhem bout to get for real 
 Half a y'all is wack, no lyrical talent, you pretenders 
 You're wrong about the Organized Rhyme representers 
 The other half approach if you wish to persist in my rage 
 You cease to exist when I enter the stage 
 I'm invincible, you invisible, break you down to pure minibles 
 Now you miserable, destroy you with no intervals 
 In my mind I see a lyrical beam on your head 
 When its time to go to the battle zone all I see is red 
 Cause you in danger, when I come through whos stoppin' me? 
 A kamikaze Mobb a Deep-er, than Havoc or Prodigy, uh 
 I represent the Organized Rhyme c-a-Crew 
 No one can do what we do, that's why there's just a few 
 (Organized Rhyme) ORC 
 Droppin' lyrics led by the Spirit on the M I C 
 (Maximillian) 
 Maximillian sees the problems in the Christian industry 
 So I'm breakin off all these hooble-type rappers 
 'Cause they don't feast on dope beats, they're just snackers 
 Meanwhile our crew explodes like fire crackers 
 Backwards mentality 
 You disrespect the pioneers who paved the way for you and your crew 
 We be the deacons of this industry 
 Dis and Mayhem and T and the E - D O G 
 When actually your lyrics straight be glorifyin the enemy 
 I hate to hit you with a blast from the past LP 
 Without the LORD, man it wouldn't sell 3 
 Most brothas be like, "man don't I know you ?" and its true 
 91, 92, where were you ?, I'm bangin' with the Organized Rhyme Crew 
 (T-Bone) 
 Check it out 
 Well it be my turn to bust, so watch out, you know the deal 
 I cut MCs like Zorro, leavin' faces scarred up like Seal 
 Really tho, so peep the voice, I be the B O N E 
 Wit the crew who hold more championships than Wayne Gretzky 
 ('Cause we be) the Organized Rhyme bambinos 
 Bustin' more rhymes than tech 9s held by Al Pachino 
 So watch out, we comin' full force with dope production 
 And these lyrics so phat, sometimes I need lyposuctions 
 Huh, I'm in the house like a kitchen, flippin lyrics sweet like honey 
 And I got mo raps than the mummy 
 Steady killin' the demons everyday like Chunghatti 
 Until the day God gone beam me up like Scotty 
 (Oh yeah) did I forget to mention 
 That I be keepin' MCs locked up like Shawshank Redemption 
 Huh, its just a gift, now I be passin the microphone 
 Back to my cousin who used to sling more keys than a lock smith, ah 
 (E-Dog) 
 Pose a threat, my rhymes be organized like my crew 
 It's the few, but not the proud like some groups around fool 
 It's the E to the D O G 
 Lyrically assassinatin demons everyday like my cousin T 
 See, we be, the notorious Organized Rhyme clique 
 Equipped with the Word of God like a pistol grip 
 And when I'm thumpin gets to pumpin more and more of what you lookin' for 
 Aura in your town, now we takin' over 
 So put away your nursery rhymes, chimes, and nickel and dime hooks 
 You ain't got no verse in this rap book 
 Dear God, I got up in the ride because its scary 
 For T-Bo capped 'em writin out a dictionary 
 I don't associate myself with playa haters, can't trust 'em 
 They say we ain't dope, but we still can't pass through customs 
 (Dust 'em) like finger prints (you can't touch his mind) 
 My crew be more United than the Airlines
