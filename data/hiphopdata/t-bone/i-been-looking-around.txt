Growing up we didn't have much 
 I still remember mom in the welfare line 
 Pops on the corner slanging flowers trying to make a dime 
 Hustling hard, working beyond a nine to five 
 Praying somebody stop but cars just keep passing him by 
 My older sister ran away and chose a life of crime 
 My younger sister getting calls from these older guys 
 I still hear the sound of them sirens running through my mind 
 Saw grandma die in a stretcher before my very eyes 
 And who could forget the flames coming outta my room 
 Wit firefighters trying to save everything that ain't ruined 
 It's bad enough we barely making ends meet 
 Now we ain't even got a blanket or a place to sleep, man 
 We all been through struggles and em' harder times 
 And at times it seems like there ain't no peace of mind 
 But just, when I started to doubt, thinking nobody cares 
 I looked up and found that you was always right there 
 Still looking for, keep looking for 
 Out searching, nothing working, steady looking for... 
 Still waiting for, keep waiting for 
 True love, one love, what we waiting for... 
 Moved to Southern Cali and bought me a baller crib 
 Wit marble floors, high ceilings and a pool to swim 
 I got a, lot of famous high profile friends 
 A white Benz laced wit them chrome spinning rims 
 Top dollar brand fashion and a Jacob watch 
 Bracelet wit canaries and 'em flawless rocks 
 I went from playa hated to Grammy nominated 
 To making movies wit Cuba and Beyonce now they say I made it 
 Finally got my music making all the headlines 
 Radio spinning my single back to back 10 times 
 But still it wasn't everything that I thought it be 
 Found me searching for love and life's remedy 
 Money bought me cars, power and yachts 
 I'm still distraught, got my stomach tangled in knots 
 Sad and depressed, finally after everything I been through 
 I found out the only thing that was missing was you 
 We all pretty much looking for the same thang 
 We soul searching trying get through life's long maze 
 I been to mountain tops looking for the most high 
 So many valleys lows, never thought I'd get by 
 So many shattered dreams, all the broken promises 
 Lied to, left for dead, emotional apocalypse 
 We all looking for the answers of what and why 
 Choose win or loose in this life we can live or die 
 And never fill that empty space that we feel inside 
 I know ya hurting, see the pain written in ya eyes 
 Tried the drugs, tarot cards, and astrology 
 Blaze up the purple haze, transcend reality 
 Trying leave all of your problems behind 
 And some of y'all put ya faith a nine 
 I got mine when I, gave up tha life 
 Swapped it out for the better one 
 Finally found true wealth, Never gonna find myself...
