Well, it's that crazy MC, the one that nobody can control 
 So give me the microphone, my name is T-Bone 
 I know you want to fight this, pull out your pen and write this 
 'Cause you know I be the hypest, but I don't smoke blunts like Cypress 
 I never have and I never will kinda like 7-Up, so shut up 
 Before you get cut up wit' another lyrical piece of glass 
 Gettin' thrown from the dome of T-Bone 
 To all them rappers sayin' that my God is not real 
 But they don't be knowin' my God is magnificent, omnipotent 
 I'm obedient 'cause if I disobey I'd be burnin' in the fire 
 'Cause the devil is a liar 
 Tryin' to make me fall anyway that he can 
 Like makin' me think that I'm the man 
 By puttin' a glock in my hand or a beer can 
 Then I be hearin' these voices sayin' sip it 
 Put I buck the devil down and grab the mic and start to flip it 
 Flop it, then I be pullin' my Bible out of my pocket 
 And remind the devil that he's been defeated, nobody cheat 
 Jesus Christ won fair and square when He died apon the Cross 
 Which mean the blood was not lost 
 So devil get the heck away from me 'cause I'm that crazy hispanic 
 When I grab, the mic I start to panic 
 Committin' perfect crimes wit' the perfect rhymes 
 Mutalatin' demons, hold up, I think I somebody screamin' 
 Oh, I think I recognize that yell 
 That the sound of twenty thousand demons burnin' in hell 
 And if you don't want to be there, then you best change your ways 
 I eat demons like a pack of Frito Lays, anyways 
 I got my dues, so Gloria Jesus 
 Go out and tell the devil there's 
 A crazy Latin on the loose 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic 
 I be that Latin MC that the devil can't see 
 Like the wind that hear goin' in ear 
 Like a cutip or even Casper the ghost, I burn MC's like toast 
 The oven's hot roast don't mean to boast 
 But since the age of 8 I have been unfadeable 
 Suckas get big heads but head is not inflatable 
 So if you like hip hop while I beat, I got 'em 
 From the top to the bottom, Bob Cat brought 'em 
 From the top of his dome to the studio 
 Wit' this crazy flow to the radio, gotta save a soul 
 Is what I'm screamin', I got a demon on my inferred 
 So I pop the demon like a fat pimple on my head 
 Nuff said, demons on the ground all around 
 Maybe next time they'll think before messin' wit' the brown 
 Crazy hispanic, skitzophranic type of fellow 
 I eat MC's like jello, hello 
 Lay your head apon the pillow, 'cause your raps need a nap 
 Oh, snaps, crackle pop, this some real hip hop 
 Not some drip drop, water down type of junk punk 
 But the type of stuff that makes demons weary 
 They fear me like a mouse does a cat, 'cause I'ma maniac 
 Nuts out of control, the devil tryin' to steal my soul 
 But he won't succeed, I'll make him plead and bleed 
 Mercy, mercy to this crazy hispanic and then I'll do it all over again 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic 
 Well, it's that lunatic Latin comin' straight from the mission 
 District, I get ballistic, let me kick this 
 Rhyme like a sucka ballin' to the devil catta 
 No dijo nada, con de una pallada 
 I'm the brother wit' the bald head like Mr. Clean 
 Settin' demons on fire, tryin' to put 'em out wit gasoline 
 But for some reason gasoline ain't helpin' 
 Demons keep meltin', like a ice-cream sundae 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 
 Everyday I praise the Lord and hang demons wit' my mic cord 
 Then I hit 'em wit' my bat while the one the floor 
 Hold a sec, I think I hear somebody knockin' at my door 
 Knock, knock, who's there, Jesus, Jesus who 
 The one who loves and can change you, rearrange you 
 From the top of your head to the tip of your toes 
 To afros, bald heads, dread and all the stuff 
 Rough and rugged by my style 
 Like a juvenile gettin' buck wild in the streets 
 I teach over beats 
 'Cause that's a secret to reach ya and teach ya 
 So that the devil won't defeat ya 
 Wack MC get cut like trees wit' ease 
 Geez, I eat 'em like Chinese 
 Wak tak tu ya, what's your technique? 
 My technique is unique, lead by the Holy Ghost 
 I got the type of skills that burn demons like toast 
 So pass the M I C and let me flow like the Atlantic 
 The terminator couldn't stop me 'cause I'ma crazy hispanic 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic 
 'Cause no one can handle and wonder 
 And loco a crazy hispanic
