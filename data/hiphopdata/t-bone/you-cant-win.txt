I'm so dope I'm impressing myself 
 Challenging rappers of my status dogg is bad for your health 
 It's like swallowing rat poison straight of the shelf 
 Or slitting your wrist then changing ya mind 
 But ain't no one around to help, dudes hear spit they like holy Toledo 
 'Cause when it comes to this rapping, I'm the one like Neo 
 I'm Jackie Chan, bet a hundred grand I could take out five of ya man's with one wave of my hand 
 Your whole caravan get smacked right in front of ya fans 
 I'll have screaming "No Mas" like Roberto Duran holla 
 They call me Boney Soprano, Young Luchiano, Bone Guevara 
 Raps Sammy the bull Gervano, I'm sick wit tha flow 
 Lyrical tactics and back flips, spitting ridiculous mathematics 
 Like it's gymnastics, when I die, be sure to place in my mic in my casket 
 And tell the world that I was fantastic, and that's it!

 Y'all can't win, against us 
 If you try, we will bust 
 You should know, we're the truth 
 You can't do, what we do, oh 
 Opposing me could be detrimental like a skinhead wit a confederate flag 
 Walking through south central, it's suicidal like Kirk Cobain 
 Trapped in a thunder storm using God's name in vain, ouch! 
 Y'all ain't really ready to riot wit me, I'm the Rocky of rap retiring rappers like Jay-Z 
 The Ronald Reagan of rapping yo that's me 
 I been rocking and running this rap game, Chino...
