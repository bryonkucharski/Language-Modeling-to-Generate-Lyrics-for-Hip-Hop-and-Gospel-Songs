You can catch me in the big body S-Class wit chrome spinners 
 Pulling up to the club wit a brim, ice and the chinchilla 
 Stacking that skrilla in a legal way 
 Rock stadiums from Nicaragua down to San Tropez, hey 
 And I ain't even gotta curse in my raps 
 I keep it gully while I'm spitting this fire on hot tracks 
 My skills speak for themselves 
 I'm like a young LL back in the day when he was rocking the bells 
 The Sly Stallone of the microphone, I'm old school like Special K 
 Turbo and Ozone, rep for my people like I'm Che Guevara 
 Wit a derby and linen pants plus a guallavera 
 Oh, I'm so sick they sending ambulances to resuscitate the mic from my verbal thrashing 
 Cash advances, and top brand fashion 
 Guaranteed to rock the spot and keep the party peeps dancing 
 I had to switch up the flow for all the DJ's spinning wax in the club 
 So when ya hear my joint y'all better turn it up, louder 
 Suvelo, blast that music bro, respect the flow, ya listening to a music pro 
 The Burt Bacharach of rap is back ready to make ya move ya body And lean back like Joe Crack 
 Whoa get ya hands in the air and wave them back and forth in the atmosphere 
 I know ya wondering if the rumors are true, believe the hype 
 I am the dopest rapper to come through wit brand new series of rap arts like kung fu 
 You don't believe me, ya crew could get hung to 
 I run through anybody opposing 
 Don't make me have to tell you again 
 I'm Gods chosen, like Peter, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John 
 Now everybody just bounce to this new hit song, What! 
 From sold out arenas to the silver screen 
 I move crowds and drop hits that make the people scream 
 Stack cream, get chauffeured in stretched out limousines 
 I'm a hot album, you just a ah 16 
 T-Bone is hard as it gets and I don't fly first class, why? 
 I travel with chef's on private jets 
 That's why you mad and upset, homie 
 I paid my dues though, been ripping these mic's since tape decks 
 So place your bets, I'm the best yet 
 Move the crowd and make ya bounce like bad checks 
 I got next, like the WNBA, defeating me is like blacks joining the KKK 
 It won't happen, like hoods without guns clapping 
 Or hip-hop wit no DJ's and MC's rapping 
 It's contradictory, none of you'll ever get wit me 
 The dopest to ever breathe on a mic and claim victory
