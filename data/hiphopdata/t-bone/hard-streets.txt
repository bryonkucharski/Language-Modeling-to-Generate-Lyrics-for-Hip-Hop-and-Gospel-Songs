See I was only 16 such a tender age 
 A young seed leaving my home in search of ghetto fame 
 Mom's begging me to stay, crying but yo I gotta make it on my own now 
 I'm tired of hustling, plus I'm almost full grown now 
 Packed up my bags in now pursuit of my dreams 
 Gave her a kiss then wiped the tears from eyes so that she couldn't see 
 Jumped in the car starring up at the stars 
 Rhyming for hours hoping one day I'm a hear the applause 
 Now I'm 17, still broke loc, no money 
 Holes in my shoes and people laughing 'cause my clothes crummy 
 No food to eat so now I'm digging in the trash can 
 Eating left over food from last week in tha bags man 
 I never thought that it could get this hard, pray to God 
 Then I get to stepping, 'cause I know that I'm called 
 I told myself I gotta keep the faith living inside, knowing I'll make it one day 
 So I can't just lay down and die, I gotta try man! 
 What are these hard streets doing to me 
 Ghetto running through me 
 Thicker than blood, down in the mud 
 Trying to come up, these hard streets do it to me 
 Ghetto running through me 
 Thicker than blood, down in tha mud 
 Trying to come up another day 
 It's 1991 getting older now 
 Kicked out my crib nowhere to live 
 Wit problems and the world on my shoulders now 
 If I go home mom will think I'm a loser 
 And if I call the homie then he'll think I'm trying to use em 
 So now I'm stuck, sleeping on my managers sofa 
 Even though I know he's ripping me off 
 Trying to play me like a game of poker 
 Congested wit depression I proceed to try and count my blessing like 
 The fact I'm still alive, I could have died on these mean streets 
 'Cause they ain't kind, so many killers and dealers committing horrible crimes 
 Dope fiends, drive-by's, muggers and drug smugglers 
 No one expecting me to make it 'cause I'm from the gutter 
 A young G from the streets of killa cal, 
 Where riders pack heat and smoke weed as a juvenile 
 It's all good though, I'm out to prove 'em all wrong 
 Reach for the stars, and show 'em one day I'm a be the bomb! 
 I'm sick of all the heartaches, let downs, broken promises and feeling hopeless 
 I'm tired of being rejected and all the disappointments 
 Feeling like I ain't worth a dime 
 Partners telling me I'm the greatest, but there's no deal to sign 
 Crying, devastated and confused at the same time 
 My mind is telling me to quit and God's saying try 
 My heart is telling me it's over and I'll never rhyme 
 But something's telling me prevail and it will be fine 
 See there's always so much drama 
 From tha block or ya babies mama 
 In these streets that's where my peeps be running that game 
 Why ya trying to run me over, like I'm trying to snatch ya corner 
 In these streets gotta get your grind on 
 All day long gotta grind get ya hustle on
