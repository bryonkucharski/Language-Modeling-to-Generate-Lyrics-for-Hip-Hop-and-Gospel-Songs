 Got to get the scrilla got to get the scrilla 
 Got to get the cash hey come on got to get it (huh huh) 
 (Repeat 3X) 
 (WC) 
 Ridahs please callin' on all ridahs please 
 Blowin' through the wind like the sticky green breeze 
 Back once again straight faded off Henn' 
 It's that nigga WC with the pocket full of spend 
 Runnin' all the gators with the new chrome feet 
 Checkin' through my rearview with my hand on my heat 
 Cause hatas can't stand to see a nigga doin' good 
 But fuck Hollywood I'm a still bang the 'hood 
 Gettin' my stalk on walk on loc I'm all about the paper 
 Hoppin' out the Navigator with braids and Chucks Taylors 
 A regulator scopin' the field like a commentator 
 Dodgin' investigators haters and salt shakers 
 The cookie baker the 64 pancaker 
 Bitch my whole entourage is full of kit makers & 
 Gators trip makers to Vegas from bird breakers from skyscrapers 
 Tippin' nobellas cause loc we's all about the Cheddar 
 (Mack) 
 See we down for whatever 
 It's all about the Cheddar 
 I put that on my life and the 23rd letter 
 (Cube) 
 Everybody get yo' scrilla 
 Don't worry 'bout ya time zone 
 Homie get yo' grind on 
 Better 
 Bounce baby baby bounce baby baby bounce 
 To them outta town niggas I still got 'em 9 an ounce 
 Can't rely on no label to send my kids to college 
 So after I rock the spot meet me in the parking lot 
 Now call it what you want but the game got me cheese 
 With bitches on my dick since my last CD 
 I went from young black and broke bro' to dub the inevitable 
 Turnin' over three decimals bangin' the oyster perpetual 
 Let it go rags to riches buckets to Phillies 
 I went from no dough to mo' dough 
 To still gettin' these switches 
 I'm wicked for digits forgive me God for the truth 
 But I fiends for Cheddar like a smoker with a sweet tooth 
 Got game from Legit and 40 C Mac and Short 
 Cube told me the key to it all is to keep hustlin' loc 
 Put your family first and the rest will endeavor 
 Stay focused and forever we can get this Cheddar 
 Come on... 
 (Mack) 
 See we down for whatever 
 It's all about the Cheddar 
 I put that on my life and the 23rd letter

 From the ghettos of Cincinnati Europe to Killa Cali' 
 I been around the world and ya ya like Puff Daddy 
 Lookin' for the Cavi' yet caught in a drought 
 Connected with the Don and copped one from SuaveHouse 
 Betta bet ya stepped on it cause last year ya slept on her 
 But now I'm up on her givin' golden showers to my opponents 
 Grindin' till I'm paid in full 
 Pledgin' allegiance to them dollar bills 
 Baguettes on 'em bigger than pit bulls 
 Only true playas can comprehend what I'm talkin' about 
 Aiiyo Mack I think I'm over the can loc carry me out
