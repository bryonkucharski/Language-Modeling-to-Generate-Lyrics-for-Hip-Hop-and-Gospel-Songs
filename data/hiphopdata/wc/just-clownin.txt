(Talking) Back again... It's the jankiest the jankiest 
 Still gettin' my stalk on walk on 
 One of the G'est WSC riders 
 One about the Feds on camera with the folded bandanna 
 It's me the G you be a seein' Nighttrain sipper 
 Two fingers split I'ma get her once again I bring her 
 Skip skip throw it up throw it up give it up or get rolled up 
 Swole up thought I told ya 'bout this Maad Circle Soldier 
 Allstars locs pieces khakis and linens 
 The OG Godfather with the blue feather in it 
 The shadiest nigga what's crackin' who got the sack and 
 Nigga what they goin' for everybody's on the floor 
 Make way for the loccest cutthroat with a beard long as Moses 
 Walkin' through yo camps and striking penitentiary poses 
 A straight vet Connect Gang is my set 
 Since a rook I did everything in the book 
 Puttin' those thangs on ya like bing bing when I get ya 
 Loc this rap game ain't ready for a real cap nigga 
 Not just clownin' we got thousands 
 Still out bangin' the streets 
 Playas get jacked from thinkin' I'm acting 
 Y'all can't see WC 
 (Repeat) 
 Now bow to the shadiest hood patrollin' west rollin' 
 7 figure nigga still hi fi growin' 
 Pistol holdin' bailin' with nothing but trues 
 Jumping out the fo' in the corduroy house shoes 
 WC a G been in these streets for years 
 Been loccin' since the Force MD's were singing "Tears" 
 Now what the fuck a new nigga got to say to me 
 I was pullin' 211's when KDAY was the Beat 
 1984 Lo Cali Sports Arena 
 And off of jams I'm jackin' fools for Filas 
 When Run DMC and Jam Master first bust 
 We was snatchin' mothafuckas outta Nissan trucks 
 Raised from a crew of real killers and knick kickers 
 That never ran on ya but was quick to put them hands on ya 
 (Talking) Ha ha Man y'all better figure us out quick 
 Ain't no rappers here we felons trying to make money at this here 
 It's the cap peeler night grinder west rider hood ratacider 
 Deuce 4 7 all day everyday 
 4 deep hittin' corners in a rag Chevrolet 
 Started out nada before I turned rich I used to do it for free 
 But now I ride for the paper 
 Maad Circle hit 'em up like bam 
 Where y'all from them enemies don't act dumb 
 Y'all know where we from 
 It's that 15th letter 2 times with the S 
 Cut off Dickie wearing descendant from the West 
 Steady square dumping in the center where the crowd 
 With my flag on my head tied Aunt Jemima style 
 But ain't nobody trippin' 'cause we all about the ends 
 Plus fool I don't set trip I set trends 
 Now after this I'm givin' y'all about a year 
 We gone see how many niggas grow braids in they beard 
 Chorus with ad libs till end
