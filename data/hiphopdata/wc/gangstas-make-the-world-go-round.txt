I am gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a frisbee 
 Gangsta's and girls make the world twirl 
 No hesitation, I can run a nation from incarceration 
 30 years is what I'm facin' but give me 7 seas and 11 G's 
 I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees 
 Nigga, please I got enough guns 
 To fill the Empire State Building full of 1's 
 Go to school is what you tell us 
 But nigga's in school is scared of the good fellas 
 We got the yayo, you can just say no 
 But nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so 
 That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be 
 Kids, when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be? 
 Like me, yo' black superhero 
 Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro 
 Yo' honor I'm have to get rid of you 
 Because it ain't no trivia about my flat in West Bolivia 
 I blew the jury a kiss, they rather dismiss 
 Them swim with the big fish, you fuckin' guppies 
 Gangsta's make the world go 'round 
 Not just saggin', wavin' my flag and never will I ease up 
 Nigga, so stop askin', see, I was taught as a tiny loc on the set 
 It's all about the pussy, your money, fuck the rest 
 Nigga, this tech is quicker to collect when I'm seekin' all the jewelry 
 The money so miss me with that preachin', teaching 
 Fuck all that bullshit, I want to slang yeah, like Noriaga 
 Sit back watch my paper collect like the I.R.S. 
 As I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the president 
 And like the police I want a gang of killers all on my side 
 That's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride on my behalf 
 As I call shots as if I was Saddam Hussein 
 Jackin' mothafuckas for Dana Danes, hated by many but I don't care 
 Because I rather be feared than loved with a pocket full of dubs 
 'Cause Gangsta gangsta's make the world go 'round 
 If you want a piece then you best to be down so quit chastising me 
 Analyzing me like the escorts look over your shoulder nigga 
 It's plain to see, crooked ass cowards 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 360 degrees like my D's the world be spinning 
 Nigga's been sinning since the beginning 
 History's a trip so I peep when I'm reading 
 Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden 
 Before big ballin', sex cars and loot 
 It's like bitches been scandalous biting forbidden fruit 
 But gangsta's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside 
 And since they regulating hoes I roll with the best side 
 So check it as my lifetime is ticking 
 Coming up strong, licking and flipping chickens 
 Need cheese in amounts of G's 
 I gave up sports to slang key's but blamed it on my knees 
 Make sure I got what I need to make your order 
 Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for my water 
 Like a snitch life's a bitch a world full of drama 
 Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma 
 Trauma brings the sad song, your mamma seems to search 
 Your way to killa king nigga 
 So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span 
 'Cause evil lurks the land 
 Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket 
 Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted 
 Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas 
 While the world keep twisting as a Westside 
 Gangsta for life, nigga 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round 
 Gangstas make the world go 'round
