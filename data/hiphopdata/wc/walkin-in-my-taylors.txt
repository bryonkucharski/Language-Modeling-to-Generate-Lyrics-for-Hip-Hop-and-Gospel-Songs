I'm Banged out like the tongue on my chucks 
 Wes, wes, wes, west, y'all 
 Yeah Hit 'em again hey 
 Now Dub C Show 'em What tiiiime it is 
 It ain't hard to figure it out 
 Dub C y'all what's all the bickerin about 
 Lench mob nigga 
 Throw rocks duck and dis us 
 Niggas say fuck us but ain't fuckin' with us 
 Y'all don't wanna see me like medusa 
 We get moola 
 Can't barricade the barracuda 
 Take my legs from me look around and I'll be still there 
 Like Michael (?) countin' money in my wheel chair 
 All day every day roll It up celebrate 
 How you niggas ever figure me and pimpin' separate 
 I'm trifle psyco loaded like a rifle 
 Nigga I could do this in my sleep with my eyes closed 
 You rockin' with a "G" on the west 
 I know a nigga this grown shouldn't be so fresh 
 But I do this for my true fans who made me 
 So if you ain't a fan I could give a fuck if you play me 'cause I'm 
 Hood famous 
 Gettin' paper 
 It won't change up 
 Walkin' in my Taylors 
 Fuck haters 
 I'm getting paper 
 Throwin' my dub up 
 Walkin' in my Taylors 
 Hood nigga forever 
 Put a dub in the game 
 Still surviving the weather 
 'Cause I done seen it all 
 That's why fuck with a chosen few 
 And keep my back up against the wall 
 Cause y'all niggas might (?) for the chippas 
 Actin' like you got a pussy up unda that zippa 
 But me to the script I'm stickin when I walk 
 Goin' keep keeping it raw 
 Cut from a different cloth 
 Made money lost money 
 Got It back touch plaques 
 Crip walk had the whole world on my nutsack 
 Lead spitter bread winner red getter ran through a lotta figures 
 Holla at a lot a niggas 
 Stayed true neva sold out kept it tight y'all 
 Now I'm here which motherfuckers gonna write me off 
 Nobody feelin' 'em I guess so 
 Catch you niggas in the line at my next show 
 'Cause I'm 
 Cadillac tinted 
 Been in it for a minute 
 Mother fuck a gimmick 
 It's the west side defended 
 While you other niggas mimick 
 I really live It to push It to the limit 
 Fly like a G5 
 A Cali nigga with the NY to the side of my head like Ely 
 In my slingshot o levis 
 Rollin' on Sunset with dope in my car like T.I. 
 Itchin to put you in a box like a mortician 
 Wit the (?) George Clinton 
 Fuck a love song slugs is thrown 
 And I been with it since poppin' with the white gloves on 
 Walkin' in the function 
 Pickin' up the Henn 
 Lookin' for something to take home and stick something in 
 Dub Sizzlean pumpin in your hole like gasoline 
 If you lookin' for It I got what you need 'cause I'm
