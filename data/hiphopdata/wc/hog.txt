 Fade me nigga last album, the album before that one. Ol' New 
 Jack ass niggas. All you muthafuckas this what I want you 
 Niggas to do. Check it out.

 The rock of the Glock tucker 
 And I'm from outta the land of the hustlers 
 'Hood rollers and Cutlass loccest ?? 
 Nutted up on you niggas with the 45'n hane 
 Study the West ridin' gots to get my money man (e) 
 Cause niggas don' got comfortable and fell the fuck off 
 Went all the way soft ? the fuck off tryin' to floss 
 So now it's up to me to retrack step back 
 Slide in my croker sacks put this gangsta shit 
 Back on the map Come on.Da da da da daaa! 
 It's the return of the Shadiest rider G'd up 
 Rippin' the game full o' dollars 
 Bumpin' More Bounce let it rain let it drip 
 Saggin' to my knees with my starter cap flipped 
 Bailin' through the smog yellin' fuck the law

 For all dippin' the 'Shaw makin' shot call 
 Junk hogs rips and dogs 
 Can't stop won't stop long as rap pays 
 I'm killin' the airwaves till my dick hairs gray 
 Ain't no question no need to ask 
 Who's the West baddest livest 
 Standin' center stage controllin' the crowd like Cyrus 
 Warriors come out to play 
 I'm off the Tanqueray crossin' every nigga 
 That's out now and puttin' a K (Killa) 
 Revokin' ghetto passes blastin' leadin' the masses 
 To kickin' asses fuck static these rap niggas is plastic (Bitch) 
 We need more street niggas (What!) 
 It's too many weak niggas with too much talkin' 
 Not enough sidewalk chalkin' 
 So let me wave my handkerchief high as a flight & 
 Show these muthafuckas what that South Central like (Westside) 
 So mirror mirror who's the downest of them all?

 To all my real G'z locked down incarcerated 
 Slap my tape in ya Walkman and let it thomp (Bump... bu bump) 
 ?Pass around to every nigga that California drops? 
 Sittin' on dubs with them triple gold thangs 
 Bitch fuck yo' nigga WC's a cold thang 
 Totin' Chronic smokin' Bionic workin' them 'draulics 
 Choppin' game for my niggas talkin' that Westbonics (Niiir) 
 Rollin' on handlebars of beach cruisers and cahoots with 
 Fools and tell 'em ?? until that ace deuces 
 Who get's the loosest? 
 Shockin' niggas like Ruthless 
 No con, the ghetto icon my shit's the bomb 
 When I die lay me face down in the grass 
 So when they view my body all y'all can kiss my ass 
 My obituary'll read: 
 When it comes to fadin' 'em all 
 It was me Willie Calloway A.K.A. the Hog
