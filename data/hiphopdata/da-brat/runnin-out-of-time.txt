Wonderin' where you been, baby, baby? 
 I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin' 
 I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying 
 Really though how much time you think I got? 
 The clock is ticking, it's ticking away 
 You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop 
 'Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure 
 Let's stick around till the murder occurs 
 How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her? 
 At the moment of time when I heard the news 
 My vision must have been blurred 
 'Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools 
 Shit people were saying was absurd to me 
 But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree 
 Of hurtin' me, purposely 
 We were supposed to be husband and wife 
 So I dedicated my life to you 
 Why? So you could keep a chick on the side 
 'Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die 
 And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie 
 I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind 
 Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine 
 No matter who the bastard was, I was past his love 
 But he never ran fast enough 
 I'm a master at the craft 'cause I roll with some master thugs 
 Laughin' as I pass you up 
 Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck 
 I would've set it up so we all had some fun 
 You assist to get around, I'll be the aid and assist you to get out 
 Thank them hoes 'cause you're shit out of luck 
 And I don't regret what I spit out and bust 
 I'm sick and tired of you us, I had enough for this sittin' at home 
 Cryin' 'n' stuff 'n' being alone 
 Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be 
 There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets 
 I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin' 
 I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying 
 Shit, all I ever did was wait and look out the window 
 And smoke me some endo 
 It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo' 
 Gave myself 100% more time to think, was love designed to stink? 
 Repeatedly you lied to me, told you to confide in me 
 Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do 'cause I molded you 
 To fit properly was inside of me 
 When you're strokin' them, you're thinkin' of riding me 
 And most of them hopin' to slide with me 'cause I'm a ferocious hoe 
 When it comes to freaky shit the dopest, you had to blow this 
 It's all out of proportion and lost your focus 
 Wasting my time 'cause I'm just getting older 
 You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder 
 44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes 
 I'm supposed to trust you 
 Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you, the moanin' and groanin' 
 Led me to the pillow where you laid your head 
 Felt like I'd rather be dead instead 
 Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway 
 You said you'd always be true 
 But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you 
 That's why you ain't answered when I was pagin' you 
 I hit the door, you duck and dove, she tried to find her clothes 
 Y'all was dodging bullets holes together 
 You gonna stay with that broke hefer 
 You know who the So So Defest is 
 I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses to keep 'em interested in 
 You better recognize the good investment 
 From the West Side of Chi nigga 
 I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin' 
 I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying 
 I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin' 
 I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin' 
 We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying 
 And I'm running out of breath
