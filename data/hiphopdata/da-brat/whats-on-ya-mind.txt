Ay homie 
 Ay yo 
 Shit wassup with you 
 What... I make ya horny huh (giggle) 
 I make ya horny huh (giggle) shit 
 You act like you want some nigga... do you? 
 (Da Brat) 
 Di di di da di di di da di day 
 I'm on the dance floor and you up on it in every way 
 Day to day you think of me 
 Can't wait to get to the club to see my face just to 
 Smoke and drink with me 
 The DJ keep spinnin' the hot records 
 Make the whole table go crazy the first second 
 Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle 
 Under that disco ball so I could shake a little 
 This shit for y'all who dance with me 
 Touchin' my ass and titties so frantically 
 Don't get carried away with it 
 I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it 
 Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently 
 'Cause if it ain't all night it's a waste to me 
 You been chasing me for the longest time 
 Like Billy Joel so please tell me what's on ya 
 Mind... nigga 
 Homie, you act like you want some 
 Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh 
 All up on me having a good time 
 I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind 
 Mind (say 2x) 
 (Da Brat) 
 I put my hands on the back of your fade 
 And we danced till the crack of dawn came 
 To the sun raise up its on 
 Still got stamina to take you home 
 Brat the damager managed to handle any position 
 Handed to her 
 You wanna fuck with the funk bandit 
 Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my 
 Cleavage you can't stand it 
 And you ain't even believing you dancing with Brat 
 And making eye contact 
 Homie put your hands on my waist and occasionally 
 Run your fingers through my fresh ass braids and say 
 To me 
 That you feel horny 'cause I wanna know 
 If you want some of this I wish you tell me so 
 'Cause if I let you touch me I must want you to go 
 Home with me be alond with me to get some mo' 
 'Cause we smoke we drink we bump and grind 
 And even though I'm tipsy I wanna know what's on 
 Ya mind 
 Chorus: say 2x 
 (22) 
 Brat now let me rock it from a niggas perspective 
 No chick can neglect this 
 Just listen when I stress this 
 The bitch was breathless 
 Big lips so thick make me wanna drop draws 
 Star had me rock hard shaking like a pornstar 
 Uh huh wassup shorty 
 Won't you be my sweet lover friend what homie 
 Thug love homie Brat put you up on pink lemonade 
 That's why I don't attract rats with my serinades 
 Stack off plubicades 
 Lack when it comes to brains 
 More than 2 women I'mma stack'em then play the 
 Game 
 Rack'em they love my name 22 
 'Cause they figure amongst themselves can I really 
 Enject 2 
 With my nine inch source see me climb in the nookie 
 Screaming 
 Everything is mine while I'm grinding the pussy 
 Can you picture that what's on ya mind baby push me 
 I don't mind raiding the jar just to get a cookie, uh 
 Chorus: say 4x
