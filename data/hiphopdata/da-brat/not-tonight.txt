I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me 
 Night time pissy drunk off the Henny Rimmy 
 I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind 
 It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it 
 He was a trick when I sucked his dick 
 Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit 
 Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the jeep 
 Tell him "I'll be back," go fuck with some other cats 
 Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop 
 Raw top in my man's drop 
 Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin "Gimme" 
 Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me 
 After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice 
 He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice 
 Put me in Chanel's, kept me out nice 
 Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike 
 It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand 
 Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man 
 Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy 
 The motherfucker never ate my pussy 
 I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now 
 I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q 
 Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue you 
 Had a weedspot, used to pump African black 
 He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap 
 I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn 
 Whisper in my ear he want to get his fuck on 
 I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin' 
 He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin' 
 The sex was wack, a four stroke creep 
 I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep 
 He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him 
 "I thought your ass was still sleepin'." 
 He laughed, told me he bought a new Path 
 Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass? 
 I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash 
 If sex was record sales you would be double plat 
 The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me 
 Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown 
 Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones 
 I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin' 
 The moral of the story is this 
 You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this 
 And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with 
 They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this 
 I ain't with that frontin' shit 
 I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends 
 Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas 
 Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures 
 Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt 
 I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front 
 For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy 
 Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?
