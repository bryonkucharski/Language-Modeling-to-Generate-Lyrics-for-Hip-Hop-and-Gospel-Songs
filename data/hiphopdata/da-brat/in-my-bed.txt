You want to dance? 
 Ha, I'm a make you dance 
 You want to move? 
 Ha, I'm a make you move 
 Dru Hill come on 
 I got this feeling 
 I can't turn it loose 
 That somebody else is getting next to you 
 Can't walk around 
 Like I was your fool 
 'Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool 
 My friends keep telling me bout things going on 
 But deep in my heart babe 
 I hope that I'm wrong 
 Somebody's sleepin' in my bed 
 Messin' with my head 
 Takin' my place 
 (Somebody's sleepin' in my bed) 
 Sleepin' in bed 
 Messin' with my head 
 Takin' my place 
 (Takin' my place, Oh oh) 
 I come home early expecting your warm embrace 
 But something's wrong 'cause it's written on your face 
 (Written on your face) 
 'Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door 
 But you know one thing 
 I ain't comin' back no more 
 Don't try to tell me things are still the same 
 'Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name 
 What else did you want? 
 What else did you need? 
 Giving you everything plus my heart 
 I gave you the world (Yes I did) 
 'Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I) 
 But you still ran out on me 
 Uh, fly shit, different colors whips 
 I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips 
 Got too many 
 My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz 
 And can't nobody do it like we does 
 It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me 
 And represent for the rest of the family 
 Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs 
 And now I keep it commin' strong till the early morn 
 Let me interrupt 
 Your regular schedule 
 Twistin' off high levels of bubonic 
 Chokin' amateurs till they vomit 
 I make 'em sick 'cause I'm the williest 
 Too much for you to deal with 
 My niggas that ride quick 
 Survive or die bitch 
 Why switch this remix hurts everyday 
 It's like this and I never stop puttin' it in work 
 I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill 
 Something you can feel 
 All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill 
 What the deal? 
 Funkier than parliament 
 Stay bent behind tent 
 And keep a nigga payin' my rent 
 My goldier scent lingers 
 VVS describes best what's on the fingers 
 We make believers out of dreamers
