Uh oh o, uh uh o, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Uh oh o, uh uh o, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Verse One: 
 Bringing more noise than pg-we true and flew in life 
 Leave us-JD and rock a party all night tight nigga 
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven 
 I can rap like hell but make it sound like heaven well 
 Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one 
 JD-what the deal is? Lemme get some 
 How many occasions, you and your liaisons 
 Can't fuck with this phenomenon, division, separated from the norm 
 Pop a lot of Shawn Don and celebrate the good times 
 So get your groove on, pulling on the in-and let's all get high 
 In the back of my-Black on Black, you come through in ninety 
 Bumpin' you remind me with the cops right behind me 
 I got head rest, Genesis played by the Brat-Hey 
 Bulletproof windows, for negroes, that wanna act 
 Don't wanna face the fact, That that's the way we live 
 Lookin' everyday Jig, Buyin' everything big-You dig? Nigga 
 You don't wanna' go the distance-Surrender-Consistence 
 Allows me the key clock contender 
 And enter a new millennium, Cracking mutherfuckers craniums 
 Droppin' Bombs-Saddam Hussein and nigga's straining 
 Hit a little, I'm feeling tickles from the nickels I smoked 
 The sweat trickle, as I slid a little liquor down my throat 
 It ain't no hope for these nigga's who broke and acting big willy 
 They dream to see a milly and talk shit before it happen really 
 Spark up another philly and eyewitness 
 The Brat fulfilling champagne and caviar wishes 
 The lifestyle of the bitch is famous, Make the payment to chante 
 Embarass nigga's live a hobby-All day harris 
 Fly me to the moon, soon and very soon stay tuned 
 Prepare to meet you doom 'cause it ain't no room for you 
 No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 
 We be keepin' in live, Keepin' it live-It's like straight to the scene 
 It's like that it's Da Brat just 
 Keepin' it live, Keepin' it we make you say 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Verse Two: 
 And if you're feeling for masquerade, I can rock a party today 
 Breaking parlay as we stack cakes of cheddar 
 Butter like parkay, wanted in four plates-sex 
 So-so definitely the best, Better watch your step 
 It's pooky, Trap with hits I make 'em clap to this 
 You knew we was coming back to kick some asses kid 
 It's nigga's like me that have more fun 
 Pop mo' bottles than the next one 
 Supermodel sex and make a portion 
 Now catch me if you can like the gingerbread man 
 Fifty grand in my hand sit-tin' on top of the world 
 Half drunk, high as fuck, shitting hard, legs swinging 
 Bringing the ruckus to all motherfuckers-woo 
 Hey yo, Brat you Da funk bandit 
 Act like you know, the baddest sweet habit having mommy to hit the door 
 Flash it a little, living riddles can't buy the vittles 
 Get cash, Life don't only come once-to let it pass 
 To all my nigga's rockin' big jewels, brand new shoes and new kicks 
 Nigga's from the old school that started all this shit 
 Big time weightholders, Dope clocking for years 
 Nigga's you watched as a shorty thinking that's the way to live 
 Giving all I got to give, us bitches is pushing sixes 
 With ten thousand dollar bracelets around they wrist 
 Legistics, is strictly riches, the other fishes in the sea 
 Can't be malicious as me, fucking with G's 
 No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 
 We be keepin' in live, Keepin' it live-It's like straight to the scene 
 It's like that it's Da Brat just 
 Keepin' it live, Keepin' it we make you say 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
