B side, B side, ha check it, So So Def 
 Bad Boy collaboration, the Notorious B.I.G. in the house 
 We got Da Brat in the house and me 
 Y'all know who I be, check it 
 I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to 
 Funk for your trunk is what I provide you 
 So slide through your hood with me in your deck 
 Cause your correct way to get your groove on flomps 
 And I paid the costs to be the boss as a kid 
 Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with 
 They thought luck did it but it didn't 'cause I'm back again 
 Back with the B.I.G. and my new-found friend 
 Sliding in from the front, never way behind 
 Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine 
 Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip 
 Brat and Biggie Smalls 
 Aw shit, on top of all that, I'm so, so remarkable 
 Flow to make you motherfuckers know 
 Ain't an MC coming close to touch 
 Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 I never knew, niggas had a clue on who was the king of the street 
 More deep than a Range Rover jeep, guns under the seat 
 And my nigga just came home from work, release 
 Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air 
 Nigga, pass that shit like you just don't care 
 Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs 
 When I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist 
 Nigga, no human being, Korean or European 
 Be seein' what B.I.G. be seein', I leave 'em peein' 
 In they draws because Biggie Smalls is far from weak 
 Brat-tat-tat, please speak, nigga close your eyes 
 'Cause you already see the Notorious B R A T 
 The raw combination, the destination 
 Number one tote a gun with no hesitation 
 Live with the funkdafied cutie pie 
 Gat by the thigh, the Smalls by her side 
 If you fuck with her you got to fuck with me 
 And we'll be rapping at your motherfuckin' eulogy, so 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 Brat-tat-tat-tat, please speak 
 I got the funk in my pocket, shit stay locked down 
 The nigga you know who represent them platinum sounds 
 Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy 
 Didn't find nothin' but truth in the hook B 
 You're pledging to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die 
 Jump in the Benz, took me a little ride 
 Round the mountain, broke a left, hit So So Def 
 And told the nigga JD I was the one, fuck the rest 
 We funkdafied, kicking it live 
 Robin Leach teach a nigga how to really survive 
 Whether it be track or blunt, ain't no need to front 
 Got what you need and I take everything you ever wanted 
 Nigga, we comin' mass, his pimpin' ass 
 His glass is full of Moet, the Rolex is bar-bayed 
 Parkade, B to the R A T 
 Rolling off swoll on chrome 17 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 Lay on back, light up the blunts 
 As we give you motherfuckers just what you want 
 Lay back, listen to the B side, slide, glide 
 Do whatever you want, get out your lighters 
 We be the rhyme writers, starters from the heart of College Park 
 New York, Chicago, wherever you wanna go
