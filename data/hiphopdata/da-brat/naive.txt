I know you think I'm young and naive 
 But you gotta trust in me 
 To be strong and responsible 
 'Cause I think I'm in love 
 1st Verse 
 Solange: Don't try to tell me this ain't real 
 It's in the way he makes me feel 
 I think my baby is the one 
 It's in the way he holds it down 
 Beyonc': I know you think that this is real 
 I know exactly how you feel 
 To young to know if he's the one 
 Girl you got time so slow it down 
 Solange: It's to complicated 
 To explain my relationship 
 My friends are hating 
 'Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' 
 Leave me alone 
 And just let me be 
 Find your own thing 
 And get off of me 
 Beyonc': It's not complicated girl 
 I've been where you are before 
 I'm not underrating 
 I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings 
 Solange listen to me understand what I'm saying 
 You'll realize one day 
 How much I care 
 Da Brat: Solange you might love the boy 
 Even sneak around the corner kiss and hug the boy 
 But Beyonc' been there before 
 And she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you 
 Cause Matthew would drill the boy 
 And I can't ignore that you young 
 We just don't want you to get sprung 
 On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs 
 Get all up in your heart and then run 
 Gettin' your heart broke is no fun 
 Neither is somebody telling you he not the one 
 You gotta learn for yourself though 
 And if you don't experience things 
 Then you'll never know 
 I don't want you wishing 
 You coulda, shoulda, woulda did it 
 But you didn't 
 Listening to other people's advice 
 It's your life 
 Make your own decisions really
