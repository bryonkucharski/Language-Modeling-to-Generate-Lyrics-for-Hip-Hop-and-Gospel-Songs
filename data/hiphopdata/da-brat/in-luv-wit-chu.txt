Yo, So So (wassup) So Def 
 Yeah, LT Hutton, uh 
 And it's the rat-tat-tat y'all, huh 
 And it's another album, huh 
 And it's so phat phat phat y'all 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' I won't do for my baby 
 You drives me crazy 
 And you make me say 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' nobody can say 'cause 
 You're the one for me baby 
 When I wake up in the morning (miss you) 
 When I can't sleep at night (miss you) 
 When I'm tossin 'n' turnin' (miss you) 
 When my body yearnin (miss you) 
 Yeah, I'm in love like Maxwell 
 You see me coming, but I just can't help it 
 My self esteem is even higher when I'm walking wit you 
 You give me fire and desire like Teena Marie and Rick James do 
 I don't care, burn up the minutes on the cell 
 Just turn up the music and feel that it's hard as hell 
 I get abusive with the flows on 'D? 
 When I seduce them, they just wanna hold me 
 'Cause I'm so smooth, and it's real not phony 
 With a nigga you'll never be lonely 
 It's beneficial, I'm hot, and since you is, let's do this 
 It seems I've been shot by cupid 
 I'm not gonna stop, think not 
 That's stupid 'cause 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' I won't do for my baby 
 You drives me crazy 
 And you make me say 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' nobody can say 'cause 
 You're the one for me baby 
 I'm in luv wit chu more than my car, more than my house 
 More than the night I keep your name comin' out of my mouth 
 I can't get you off of my mind 
 Finally found somebody who see's me besides what's on the outside 
 Fine as Roy Jones, stick 'n' movin my bones 
 Your presence make everything else irrelevant when we close 
 Turn off the two way, do lay your head on my pillow 
 And do me baby, the rhythm gonna getcha groovin baby 
 And we can rock it till the broad daylight 
 Bodies knockin' da boots, destroying property, proping me up to get through 
 It ain't right how you're feeling on my boo-hoo-hee-tee 
 It's just you and me, unexplanatory, the way that you adore me 
 Lord have mercy, somebody gon have to pray for me 
 You're worthy, my service superb, and on purpose 
 I swerved it all the way to your heart baby 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' I won't do for my baby 
 You drives me crazy 
 And you make me say 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' nobody can say 'cause 
 You're the one for me baby 
 When I wake up in the morning (miss you) 
 When I can't sleep at night (miss you) 
 When I'm tossin 'n' turnin' (miss you) 
 When my body yearnin (miss you) 
 When I wake up in the morning (miss you) 
 When I can't sleep at night (miss you) 
 When I'm tossin 'n' turnin' (miss you) 
 When my body yearnin (miss you) 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' I won't do for my baby 
 You drives me crazy 
 And you make me say 
 Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv 
 I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu 
 And there ain't nothin' nobody can say 'cause 
 You're the one for me baby 
 Yeah, LT Hutton, uh 
 And it's the rat-tat-tat y'all, huh 
 And it's another album, huh 
 And it's so phat phat phat y'all
