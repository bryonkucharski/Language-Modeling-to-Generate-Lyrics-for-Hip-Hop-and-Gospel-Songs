(Jermaine Dupri) 
 Ah, Remix 
 All I see over here ain't nothin' but a lot of honies lookin' for man 
 And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand 
 And short shirts, honies tryin' to show that slow (show that) 
 Lined up tryin' to get through the velvet ropes 
 'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug 
 Standin' on the couches like this our club 
 Got the Bacardi and Cristal mixed in too (yeah) 
 Knowin' in the morning I'm a feel the blues (uh huh) 
 Now the jam keeps droppin' and the drinks keep comin' 
 And the girls keep talkin' to me (talkin' to you) 
 I mean shit straight poppin' everybody jumpin' 
 Makin' it hard for me to leave (oh) 
 (Da Brat) 
 All you gotta do is call me 
 And I'll come runnin' to where the party at 
 I keep a fat sack in the backpack 
 So what's happenin'? 
 In every city I'm rappin' in 
 If it's a after splash I'm the last cat in 
 Get in, purrin' tight like virgin 
 Like snow, flurrin' 
 The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh) 
 You do me I do you 
 Spend a night with boo-boo 
 Let's have a private party for two 
 But it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream 
 Runnin' to the border for Colombian's green 
 Studyin' horniculture 
 My green thumb keeps them water vapors twistin' 
 I freak until I cum 
 I keeps it number one 
 (Jagged Edge) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Yo, yo R.O.C.) 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 If the party's where you're at, just let me know 
 (R.O.C.) 
 Uh, uh 
 Now here we go, how 'bout another shot of henney? 
 I heard the apple martini happen to help plenty 
 Mami ven aqui, the party's over here! 
 But the hustlers, gangsters, thugs is over here! 
 Get wit' us (why?) 
 We true ballers like the Sixers 
 We all hoppin' out of sixes 
 Mines is black, Jermaine's is champagne 
 Jagged Edge in the blue, black and pearl white and gray 
 What a sight to be seen (uh) 
 So So Def's the crew I thought you knew 
 It's a beautiful thing (so beautiful) 
 I mean there's nothin' like us it's true 
 The sun could retire if the rocks we got get any brighter 
 Whoa! 
 Once the man and the game that I kick begins 
 My nickname is ESPN 
 Now if ya jewels is blue and ya goose is gray 
 Mix in the O.J. and let's party away 
 (Jagged Edge) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 Uh ooh 
 (Uh oh oh oh) 
 If the party's where you're at, just let me know 
 (Nelly) 
 Show me where the party at dirty, someone with me 
 Strike there about one thirty, never get there too early 
 Commin' as is (eh), do-rags and ten's 
 I'm rollin' fas is (eh), this little jagged benz 
 With the Rolls not the one wit the stim, the one with the rims 
 The one that seems to make more enemy's than friends 
 I'm slidin' in past those, fo' eyes closed, 
 Mo' on Rolls, folk charms rolled 
 With the S-O, S-O, D-E dot F 
 Buyin' bottles and bottles till there ain't nothin' left 
 I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no refs 
 My jazzmode an def baby show me the clubs 
 I'm like'aye where the Bacardi at 
 Mix it with the Cris baby what's wrong with that? 
 We in the V.I.P's twisted 
 Down right stiffed it 
 Two way shit, boo it make like you missed it 
 (Jagged Edge) 
 Left side just put your hands up, throw 'em up 
 Right side just put your hands up, throw 'em up 
 Everybody put your hands up, just throw 'em 
 When the beat comes back around, everyone do it again 
 Do the east side run this mother for ya? (Hell yeah) 
 Do my south side run this mother for ya? (Hell yeah) 
 And them hater's ain't hittin on, ain't talking about 
 And they look like, if the party's where you're at let me hear you say 
 (Lil' Bow Wow) 
 O-H-I-O 
 Yo, this lil' cat got girls 
 Cat got flows, roll up in the party, snuck in the back door 
 I don't mean no harm, I just heard it was rockin' 
 Let me party witcha till the cops come knockin' 
 I'm tryin' to see what all the fuss about 
 Bounce a little bit before they put me out 
 I'm like the sun - this lil' cat got beam 
 Got girls 21 wishin' they was 14 (haha) 
 That's the affect that this phenom 
 Bow Weezy 
 When I do it I do it like it's for TV 
 They might come close but you and I both know they can't see me 
 I'm a So So Def representative 
 Young niggas in the game they was born to live 
 And we do what we do, we don't talk no smack 
 And we always know where the party at, bling (bling bling) 
 (Jagged Edge) 
 Ay, where the party at? (Tell 'em) 
 Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at? (J.E. y'all) 
 Models and models, talkin' all of that 
 Know I can't forget about my thugs (C'mon) 
 (Where the party at?) 
 And all my girls (Yeah) 
 (Where the party at?) 
 Up in the club (Uh, yo) 
 (Where the party at?) (Tigah) 
 If they party's where you're at, let me here you say 
 (Tigah) 
 Man I rip flows, get dough every time I rip shows 
 Rip hoes, when we mash out in Chevy's and fours 
 Niggas know they ain't heard it like this before 
 Whenever we pull up on the strip they like "Oh!" 
 Chickens know me, hundred dollar mac and shorts 
 Tank tops and Polies 
 If it's 'bout cash, I'm gas chick, I'm on E 
 On e'rything 
 Me and Jagged, every time we hit the club 
 This nigga's off the chain! 
 You can believe that 
 And if you don't, come on down here where you can see that 
 Anything you wanna be, best believe I be's that (oh) 
 Where the G's at? 
 Where the keys at? 
 Where the 22's on them SUV's at? 
 Gotta have that from the do' 
 And gotta get me some mo' 
 Man you think I'm goin' on a groupie, no 
 Spot me with a fifth in the velvet room 
 Crown Royale while J.E. spit this velvet tune 
 It's over (over) 
 Dough
