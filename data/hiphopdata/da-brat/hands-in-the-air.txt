(Da Brat) 
 Niggas always watchin me (funky!) 
 But I want 'em to keep on watchin me 
 I'ma keep give 'em sumthin to see (smokin'!) 
 I always feel like 
 Somebody's watchin me, watchin me 
 Could it be the way I'm still tight? 
 Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin me, jockin me 
 The, whole world got too much money for me 
 To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe 
 Rock harder than the one from So-So 
 I never go broke broke 
 I keep comin' with the vocals that make most know 
 Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag 
 Why should I look sad that I got some loot now? 
 In fact, I knew how 
 Watch when I back the Coupe out 
 Can niggas just troop out 
 The same way they do when I show you Brat 
 With a little bit of boobs out 
 And her big ass protrude out 
 Get the news out 
 Some of you bitches lose out 
 When the sexiness ooze out 
 Like orgasms, I'm the best at this 
 Throwin' tantrums when I move into makin' shit 
 If you thinkin' of becomin one of my favorites 
 You gotta pay a bitch 
 'Cause I be stayin rich 
 I ain't quittin, quittin 
 Way before "Funkdafied" I was spittin', spittin' 
 Throw yo hands in the air like you don't care 
 This fo niggas and bitches everywhere 
 Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on 
 Em 
 And make 'em say, say 
 Hands in the air, from side to side 
 Forever I'm high, high 
 Together we ride, ride 
 I'm never too tired 
 To get that paper, baby 
 (Da Brat) 
 If y'all wanna see me, see me 
 I'm give y'all somethin' to look look at 
 Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat 
 Burn burn these hoes 'cause I'm back and my pants still 
 Sag 
 It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, 
 Wagon 
 I ain't lackin lackin on shit 
 Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes 
 That fit fit 
 I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit 
 And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie 
 Roll 
 Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow 
 Slow 
 Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks 
 See you when I shine, I glow, glow 
 From the C-H-I-C-A-GO, 6-0-6-4-4 
 And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me 
 Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you 
 Some of the ones run 
 I can't control my trigger finger when it pump pump 
 Stay out the way when I come come 
 It's guaranteed to bump bump the trunk, uh 
 And put a hump in ya back 
 If niggas is askin who's thumpin, it's Brat Brat 
 (Mystikal) 
 I keep my bad braids back when puttin' the dick on 
 The track 
 You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that 
 The bass don't thump, we spit on crap 
 That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat 
 Everytime that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap 
 I be breakin ya back to the rhythm of rap 
 (?) Test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?(?) 
 Niggas say, "I love that fuckin' shit ya did wit Da 
 Brat!" 
 Actin' bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper 
 Still smoke a nigga under the table 
 Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the 
 Phrases 
 Instead of puttin' out sumthin that's blazin' 
 Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth 
 And ya head out ya ass 
 And keep ya nose out my business 
 And I mean it, goddammit, 'cause I'm fiddinta get 
 MAD! 
 I put 'em in the trash bag 
 Twist tie, put 'em out Monday and Wednesday 
 I kick 'em in they raggely ass 
 Take money from 'em and you know I better get 
 Some 
 I know it ain't fair 
 But I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 As high as you can, and leave them bitches there! 
 (Chorus 2x, fade out)
