 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 So you besta watch ya back

 And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Well, here it comes 
 Say what 
 Here it comes 
 It's the quicka rippa ripper 
 Known to flip a script like it ain't notin' 
 All ya MC's that used to MCs better duck an' 
 Run an' hide 'cause it's too late to try to make it right 
 Ya just messed up and I ain't tryin' to let ya slide 
 'Cause I ain't the one for that I ain't the one that slack 
 I'm the Miggida-Miggida-Mac pack and I ain't takin' jack 
 I don't care who you get or who ya wit' 
 Just know you won't be equipped to what it takes to break this krossed 
 Out kid 
 I've got deez off dout clout 'cause I'm deez off doubt 
 I'm bad suckas if ya wanna know what I'm talkin' about 
 So lay your cards on the table 'cause I'm able to rock 
 When ever, where ever I still rocks the cradle 
 'Cause I'm a nappy happy bad little sun-of-a-gun 
 And in my eyes, nigga, you don't want none 
 Cause on the mike I get dum-ditty ditty-dum 
 So watcha back when I say here it comes 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 So you besta watch ya back 
 It's da bomb 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac 
 Well, can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Well, here it comes

 Understand that Kris to the Kross comes with nothing but flavor 
 We get our own on our own ain't askin for no favors 
 We're true to what we do that's how we be 
 So just reason with the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C 
 I betcha never thought you would here it like this 
 Some funk for the trunk by this nigga named Kris 
 See, I ain't into the game 
 I'm true to the gang 
 I'm poppin' your thang till the party people swing 
 'Cause I'm a little rough neck 
 Tiffy-tiffy tough neck 
 'Cause what gettin' 'nough respect 
 And all those little punks talkin' junk bring it on 
 'Cause I just love takin' punks outta homes 
 Why 
 'Cause I'm a nappy happy bad little sun-of-a-gun 
 And in my eyes, nigga, you don't want none 
 So watcha back or comments will startcha runnin' 
 And do-do on yourself when you hear the daddy comin' 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 So you besta watch ya back 
 It's da bomb 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 And I'm called the Daddy Mac 
 But, can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb 
 Well, here it 
 Say what 
 Comes 
 I'll be coming around the mountain when I come droppin' a bomb 
 Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some 
 So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack 
 Walkin' away you're like the bottom of a door mat 
 I didn't gain props 'cause I was a suckas daughter 
 I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker 
 I can pay Donny Mars in a sticky cage 
 Give me 30-30 half-caliber half-gauge 
 And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about 
 Test me out 
 We're in the big part of in The Last Boyscout 
 Scopin' a needle is like a needle in a haystack 
 Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq 
 You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back 
 'Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a phat track 
 I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom 
 Dat Da Brat done drop da bomb 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 So you besta watch ya back 
 It's da bomb 
 I know you hear me comin' here I come 
 And I am what they call Da Brat
