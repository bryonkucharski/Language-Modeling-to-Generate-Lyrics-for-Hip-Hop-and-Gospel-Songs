To the beat beat and ya don't quit shit 
 Before the sun shines the rain falls 
 Applause the encore 
 Havent you heard of a bitch who can open like pores 
 Pop a nigga like a pimple keep it simple enough 
 Make 'em wonder what the fuck happened leavin' 'em stuffed 
 Get that ass kicked fast quick in a hurry 
 You felt the fist of fury when you envisioned that I was comin' 
 Used to laugh when I had a demo 
 But since the big stretch lex limo 
 You ain't got no moe jokes 
 Ya wanna come on and go wit me 
 To my place hate to hurt ya feelings sexual healin ain't the case 
 Laced the tracks like angle dust 
 Thus fuckin' wit us is deadly 
 Behead the whole crew of the last nigga who wasn't ready 
 Stay bregheted up, platinum plus 
 Nubians E three four chrome's 18's three piece B B S treat seat's 
 And y'all shall find riches it's mad bitches gettin' dough 
 I'll die for I go broke just a lil moe 
 Just a lil bit more 
 Do me just a uh 
 Just a lil bit more will ease my mind 
 Now put one hand in the air if ya keep the chinky out effect 
 I live to party all night 
 And love to have sex 
 Got a main squeeze in the piece on the low 
 Make a good piece of cheese but could use some more 
 Who got a lighter bout to blaze up its tucked in tight 
 I let the ventilation slide sensation between the windpipe 
 Ignite it up try to bite my style too tought 
 It's too much, too lil, too late for you to come up 
 Be deceived of ya wanna be foolish this bad mandate bitch is 
 True to the shit, envoke the spirits like the craft's 
 Serve the niggas half the stash in case the cash get low 
 The bastard know 
 Fuck over the dough and die 
 Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit 
 No nigga ever lasted past the first attempt 
 I leave 'em baffled and gaffle 'em for all of they keys 
 Then dispense to my niggas like Sony distributing LP'S 
 To the tic toc and ya don't stop 
 To the beat beat and ya don't quit 
 A lil moe bitch 
 A lil moe nigga 
 A lil moe baby 
 That'll ease your mutha-phuckin' mind... 
 So so def wit that mind blowin' shit
