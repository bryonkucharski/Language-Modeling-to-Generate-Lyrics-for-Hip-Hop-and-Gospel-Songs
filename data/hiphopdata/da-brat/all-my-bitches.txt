Where my bitches at? 
 Where is all my bitches at? 
 This motherfucker right here, 
 This for all y'all motherfuckers 
 You a bitch, you a bitch, I'm a bitch, 
 We all bitches, 
 In this motherfucking game 
 Just be a bad bitch, 
 When you be a bitch 
 I wakes up from dreaming of money, 
 To thinking of money 
 On a daily basis, 
 Make sure the money 
 Make the way to the safe 
 Put your bet's on the "b" to the "ra" 
 From the west side of chi' "t", 
 Niggers want to ride with me 
 'Cause I'm the live-est, 
 Get high with me 
 'Cause I'm fly 
 Obsessed with me 
 'Cause I'm shy 
 No matter which whip I pick, 
 And butt-kick your little buckets 
 And leave your face with a disgusted look 
 As you bite the dust 
 I get them big things 
 This is hard shit, head bob, 
 Breakin your neck, 
 Raw shit 
 My bitches keep hollin' 
 "Dollas" 
 "Tillgod" 
 Call us 
 And it don't quit 
 Till the earth split 
 This bitch 
 A baller wit' it 
 In a black jag, 
 It's a fact that, 
 Brat the first solo 
 To go platt, 
 And if it sound like I'm braggin,' 
 I am, 'cause I'm proud of myself, 
 Pat a bitch on the back, 
 Damn... straight to the bank I go 
 Created a game plan 
 That y'all follow 
 Switch four in the diablo 
 Vacationin' morocco 
 Keep chasin' the papers faithfully 
 And 'cause I get it 
 Niggas permanently hatin' me 
 Fuckem' 
 I'm talkin' to... 
 All my bitches 
 That live the hood life, 
 Good life, 
 My bitches 
 That don't need 
 A nigger for shit 
 Bitches wit a 
 Game plan, 
 Rockin' 
 Name brand, 
 I dedicates this one to you 
 I'm talkin' too... 
 All my bitches 
 That live the hood life, 
 Good life, 
 My bitches 
 That don't need 
 A nigger for shit, 
 Bitches, 
 Niggas gotta holla at 
 Screamin 
 "Where them dollars at" 
 I dedicates this one to you... 
 From the start I was in a hurry to crawl, 
 And walk slap niggas before I could hardly talk. 
 Now I gottem'on they knees screamin' 
 That's what the fuck I thought 
 No matter how I part the braids 
 Hear y'all chatter when I rock it straight. 
 I'ma bad bitch even when the style flipped 
 I get paid cause dough come fast in large amounts 
 Too much for one nigger to count 
 You must not know how a so so def hoe bounce 
 To bust open another niggas accounts and be out 
 To the tellee or the atm in a 750 gray bm 
 Made a motherfucker pay for the rims 
 I fucked his friend but it's all good 
 He understood the way I live my life, my life 
 That I can't depend on nobody 
 For me to survive and stay high. 
 Where all my bitches at? Girls 
 Make 'em love to hate us 
 And whether you classy to dick suckin' 
 Or a trashy bitch get your papers 
 I gotta eat throw these bows 
 Silently creep on these hoes 
 That's robbin' my flows you impostors to me 
 Prophets is all I see I ain't got time for beef, 
 So I rhyme for cheese financially stable, 
 Tryin' to make g's and I'm talkin' to 
 And since I cover the mortgage, 
 The car note, the porsche, and the condo 
 We still smokin' 
 Dollar signs are all I see excuse me, 
 I got to cut the line leave you niggas behind 
 For the third time and shine on purpose 
 Blind'em every time I surface 
 If an aries hurt you you must deserve it 
 Every bit of a dime is worth it, 
 Keep on swerving not perfect 
 But striving for that working with diamonds, 
 And flirting with the finest cats, 
 Desert the broke niggas that still live 
 With their momma's at 
 Provoke most to wanna wine a dine brat, 
 'Cause I'm dope from coast to coast 
 Guarantee to fall in love with me 
 After just one toast, 
 Smoke weed that'll make you say, 
 I ain't never getting' high again 
 Niggas always wanna see what I'm riding in 
 So I slide in the benz outfit match 
 From head to tims 
 Rims you ain't seen before fein for doe, 
 Screamin' cream for mo and mo, 
 Reap the benefits if it's free shit, 
 I take gifts in all shapes and sizes 
 And diamonds is my favorite wish, 
 Picture me rich a genious, 
 When it comes to me collecting these chips, 
 And this to...
