Anotha tantrum dealin' rugged don't give a fuck I'm denied nothin' 
 Gotta still get it spoiled rotten real wit it deal wit it 
 Don't you feel me livin' in you 
 When mothafuckas make promises and can't come through (say 2x) 
 Whateva obstacles they dig to me from gettin' my way 
 I gets revenge to the end then begin the fourplay 
 My forte is sippin' alize and acting up 
 Looked into your mirror at ya face you started backing up, what the fuck 
 You slowly stepped away and started panic 
 As you witness anotha tantrum fantasmatic to keep a niggas frantic your manic 
 Y'all wanna be told shit if I can get it 
 You might feel my spirit off on anotha mission 
 Fishin for my next victim with no permission 
 Switchin bodies had to get some new goddies put on da benz 
 Jump in da mind in many mens with no patience 
 The worst thing to do is wait and waste time its constantly slippin away 
 Take it manipulatin' all ages bring da frustration 
 Waitin for da left of my cavin to face e-all-lu-cation 
 Appearing crazy untract but seem daily 
 Some say shady but so what mothafucka
