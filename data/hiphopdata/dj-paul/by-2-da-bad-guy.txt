When dem boys hit the corna I'm a gonea 
 When dem boys hit the corna I'm a gonea 
 Like (skerrrrrrr) fuck that sat goodbye to the bad guy 
 (Skerrrrrrr) fuck that say goodbye to the bad guys 
 (Lil Wyte) 
 Commin out like hold up aw shit there go them 4's 
 DJ Paul where you at been tryin' to hit you on the phone 
 To let you know that it's hot as cole 
 All around the globe 
 Tippi toes what I'm flickin on 
 Passin by these hoe like (skerrrrrr) 
 Fuck that say goodbye to them bad guys 
 I smoke weed till I die 
 I'm gon stay high 
 Come touch this engin pimpin' 
 I been crusin a buck 
 Got to get away from this cops they finally cross me out of luck 
 The same story 
 Every day only of guts glory 
 It's part of yo struggle if it you ain't got shit for me 
 I gon' hold it down 
 Get my crown and keep only truckin 
 Civilize this industry fuck up yo truck and keep on bumpin 
 This is some shit that you didn't think you would ever see 
 But since we hear turn to the back of the pack and let us be 
 You think we'll give up purple suryp and pimp cups 
 Now motherfucker this the life we like in Memphis 
 (DJ Paul) 
 Yeah now they got me in this cell 
 'Cause this crack man I sell 
 In the haven boy this crack sell well 
 I was in the zone 8:30 in the morn' 
 Them po's hit the con 
 I got gone I had a tone 
 With a big bag of crack 
 Them boy don't like that 
 So I had to get down like a lack 
 With 4 flats 
 I'm a grayhound 
 I just put the tre down 
 I can't be on my way down 
 So I'm gon have to put down 
 Ditch the rocks I had them in a machbox 
 Ditch the glock behind the bushes round the block 
 And just like the spinners I will never stop 
 Like bukus and money we don made on the spot 
 I make the hood hot along with the faculty and ganegreen P.A.C 
 Every thang we gain is green 
 To the bay 
 Where my boy Lil Wyte stay 
 Is where I damn there ran but they caught me anyway fuck
