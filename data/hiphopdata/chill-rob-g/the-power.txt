 "Don't say this, don't say that change your lyrics" 
 Everybody's a critic - It's gettin' kinda hectic 
 My rhyme is authentic, so it shall remain 
 My writing exciting, never mondain 
 In actuality my personality 
 Keeps my mentality based on real 
 Life situations, not speculations 
 But verbal illustrations of how I feel 
 Dull, void, without substance or content 
 You need to slow your speed, stop the nonsense 
 These are words of the rising sun surprising some 
 Who thought I was just another hum-drum 
 I'll take a page, write a phrase, then rephrase it 
 Treat it like a national flag and upraise it 
 So a nation of people can feel proud 
 About a brother who speaks out real loud 
 I've got the Power 
 I've got the Power

 It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic

 I've got the Power 
 I've got the Power 
 I've got the Power 
 I've got the Power

 It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic

 I've got the Power 
 You've got the Power

 You, you, you and me and Chill Rob G 
 We've got the Power

 We've got the Power 
 I've got the Power 
 I've got the Power
