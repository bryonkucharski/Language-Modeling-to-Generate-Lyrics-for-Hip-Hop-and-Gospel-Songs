My word's food for thought, the mind is like a cafeteria 
 Some rappers are inferior, but none are superior 
 My voice is choice, I'm one of the chosen 
 I might be Chill, but I'm not frozen 
 Self-preservation, survival of the better 
 Chill Rob plus the seventh letter 
 Flyin' off at every angle, can you tangle 
 Mix or handle, you don't hold a candle 
 To what you're hearin', you don't have a near win 
 But it's a clear miss, no wonder you fear this 
 And don't get pissed just because I riffed 
 I'll tell you what, smoke this: 
 I'm the Future Shock... 
 The man, the moment, the mic, the muscle 
 The power, the people, the hype, the hustle 
 The harder I hit, the smarter you get 
 If you're a liar, stay away 'cause I ain't shovellin' shit 
 The edge of night opens doorways to horror 
 I'm the guiding light as you search for tomorrow 
 Dark shadows terrorize the young and restless 
 I'll crash the spot if I'm not on the guest list 
 The hands of time in my mind advances fast 
 While you recite the first to the last 
 Word that I spoke, but no, that's no complaint 
 Take my rhyme but use restraint 
 If I catch you on the perpetratin' tip, hurtin' your lip 
 Well look, you know how it is, I gotta flip 
 In ways you would never suspect 
 Like do a front semi and land on your neck 
 To be precise, correct and exact 
 This album is mostly freestyle and feedback 
 From the people, it's the sequel 
 To 'Dope Rhymes', but this is go for broke time 
 Without breakin', makin' no mistakes and 
 Takin' no flakes for friends, 'cause in the end 
 They backbite, and you don't wanna get smacked, right? 
 So hold tight while your mind takes flight 
 Check out a verse or two and see if I can rock 
 I'm the Future Shock... 
 Nothin' better to do, so I'll pursue this new 
 Style, rhythm rockin' and poppin' lip 
 Jealous punks pretend it ain't hype but in 
 Ten lines or less they're jockin' it 
 Reality is my beat, the beat goes on 
 Mark creates the beat that Rob rolls on 
 Like a musical note or a boat ridin' a wave 
 And I hope what I wrote goes with you to your grave 
 Save a little for later so I can come back 
 My lyrics stick in your brain like a thumbtack 
 And if you thought I was slummin', wrong 
 You know that I'm comin' strong 
 This is a Flavorized drum track 
 So take a stand and plan to upraise your hand 
 When you agree what I'm speakin' is purely truth 
 I rap the style of rhyme that opens up your mind 
 To the way things have been since my youth 
 Why am I riffin'? Just listen and see if I can rock 
 While you be-bop to breaks I drop 
 I'm the Future Shock.
