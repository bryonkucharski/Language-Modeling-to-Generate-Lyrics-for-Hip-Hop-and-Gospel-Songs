I made this beat, 2003ish 
 Wrote to it but never got it completed 
 I love the fell love the vibe that I acquired 
 Spit a couple lines but wasn't really inspired 
 See inspiration is the thing that keep my brain ticking 
 If you don't feel inspired, someting in my veins missing 
 I wasn't too strong 
 Quit that and moved on, never looked back 
 And started working on a new song 
 But as a beatmaker, you never know 
 A track that I ain't feeling might inspire someone else's flow 
 I sell beats, internet and in the streets 
 Helping poets paint pictures, I'm the canvas so to speak 
 I sold this beat to a guy named Phil 
 He reached out as a fan, hit me on my email 
 Told me I inspired him, he loved what I was doing 
 He said I motivated him to start pursuing music 
 Gave him the instrumental, call me when you done writing 
 But I never heard back and really never thought twice 
 It happens often, rappers never finish nothing 
 So it didn't seem strange he didn't hit me back with something 
 A couple months passed, that was fine 
 Then I got another message with Phil's name in the subject line 
 "Class, I'm a friend of Phil's from back in the day 
 And the music you made, inspired him in many ways 
 He changed his life around, got it on track 
 I want you to know, cause last week Phil died in a car crash" 
 What? ? ? you serious? 
 I barely knew the guy but shit it hit me fairly quick 
 We all forget how much life should be admired 
 Sometimes we all forget how our music does inspire 
 Inspired Phil? nah, Phil inspired me 
 To finish up my song over top of Phillip's beat
