And it's the 5th element (uh huh) 
 Never repetitive (nah) 
 Highly competitive (all right) 
 Happy and elegant (yeah) 
 I'm gettin' busier, can't you tell? 
 I got the rhymes that sound so well 
 And it's the 5th element, 
 Never repetitive, 
 Highly competitive, 
 Happy and elegant, 
 I'm gettin' busier, can't you tell?, 
 I got the rhymes that sound so well 
 Yeah, I got no time to waste, 
 Back and it's time to embrace, 
 Kid is too nice, 
 I ain't fallin' flat on my face, 
 I figured it out, 
 Yeah, guess I'm crackin' the case, 
 And I ain't slowin' up, infact, 
 I'm detachin' the brace so, 
 Believe me when I say it, 
 I ain't gunna take no, 
 Shit from no man, 
 Especially from no assholes, 
 Class is to much, 
 I flex words like muscle, 
 And I ain't a hustla but I'm livin' off my hustle, 
 Digin' in the grates, 
 Maneuver the track, 
 Went from rapper who produced to producer who raps, 
 Kid, 
 Respect drive if you don't respect rhymes, 
 We all got our taste but I still stood the test of time. 
 And ever since I started movin' up, 
 And popped off this class, 
 I've been gettin' more attention and often more ass, 
 Listen, love women, 
 Can't stand sluts, 
 Media's fucked, 
 Irritating, all of the above (yep) 
 My flow ain't pretty, rhymes ain't gritty, 
 I'm in between from the country livin' in the city, 
 And record labels never saw a thing in me, 
 But I can tour and a thousand kids sing with me, 
 A modern day hippy, yeah, 
 Changin' up the norm, 
 Smoke dope, you can say I'm bakin' up a storm 
 I dress like I'm sixteen, spit like a pro, 
 Wear the same clothes in every video and every second show, 
 This is me, tryin' to do it comfortably, 
 Lazy as hell but I run my own company, 
 And most music, really I despise it, 
 But I hate on everything I even hate most of my shit. 
 Hip hop ain't the same, 
 I remember parents used to hate it, 
 But hip hop is grown up and now parents play it, 
 Everybody and their grandmother love rap now, 
 And everybody and their grandmother try to rap now, 
 I'm a fan but I'm losing my cool, 
 Cause every rapper that I hear keeps abusing they tools, 
 You can't make an album with 12 battle tracks 
 When your punchlines are whack 
 And you can't make hyenas laugh. 
 Most rappers don't like me, I can live with it, 
 Diss me on your record cause really I don't give a shit, 
 Say that I'm a sell out, call my beats commercial, 
 But it's only music man, 
 I don't take none of it personal
