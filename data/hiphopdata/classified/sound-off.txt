Ay yo I march to the mic with my hands out 
 Set and stand out cut the band out 
 And let my hype man out 
 Take the mic stand now excite hands down 
 Deleting competition and still stand proud 
 Constructive over your head still productive 
 Got you hanging off my words class be seductive 
 Ya had enough kid relax and listen 
 I'm sick of everybody in this rap game bitchin 
 First off ill make a few things clear 
 Don't be yapping in my ear bout some stupid shit ya hear 
 Take it from the source class no other 
 I'll bring it to your face to keep your mind from getting cluttered 
 Second to the people disrespecting 
 Taking me for granted 'cause I'm unsigned fuck you 
 I'll cuss whoever wants to step to this essence 
 Now feel my presence in every sentence a message 
 Ground squad, round off, prepare, crowns off 
 Found war, now your, in for, downfall 
 Want war, got war, want more, got raw 
 Ground squad, sound soft, nah sound off 
 That's the bottom line right, now you can see where I be coming from 
 See what I'll be dealing with, understanding some of them 
 These people acting dumb to me, and I can't seem to concentrate 
 Then I got these other people, bitchin like they men-es-trate 
 That's my third problem never meant to lay it on ya 
 But life's a funny thing, I'll probley turn and blame it on ya 
 I need to keep my head straight, can't drink and such 
 But that's my forth problem, people say I think too much 
 But for the fifth, it's like this 
 Looking at the large few still ain't seeing shit 
 Got me wondering what's the reason for my rhyme 
 And so fucking tired, when people tell me it's a waste of time 
 I told ya, this is my life 
 If anybody's having any doubts you can die twice 
 One death for my soul, another for yourself 
 Now do the mathematics, or rewind and try to figure it out 
 And from one point to another, I'm lifting up my eloquence 
 And exercise my past days to see what things was relevant 
 My sixth point, intelligence, no one seems to use it 
 Wonder if I'm dissing ya I'll tell ya if I do it 
 Seven deadly sins, plus 9 pedestrians 
 One squad I represent, defeating us, guess again 
 It's takes the best of men to overcome the rest of em 
 Take the lesser men and rebuilt, ain't no questioning 
 Now who's impressing them, check the truer specimen 
 Hot like Mexican, take the proper steps to win 
 Problems next to him, but still will prevail 
 With a mic in my hand and the skill you should feel
