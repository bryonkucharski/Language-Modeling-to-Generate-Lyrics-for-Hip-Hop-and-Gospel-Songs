I'm so highhhhh, flying saucer racing on vacation in the sky over top the population 
 Marijuana, maryjane, whatever you name it 
 Been smoking for a couple years and got no plan to change it 
 At 21 I started puffing just in moderation 
 Now I smoke like I'm Jamaican it's a daily operation 
 Plus within my occupation it's an obligation 
 Late night, cloudy room instrumental dominating 
 I'm so high strung, but I stay calm and patient 
 When I'm blazing, more focused then when I'm intoxicated 
 My parents always told me drugs are bad don't you ever take em 
 You'll be wasted and sedated talking sharp with God and Satan 
 Life is often changing though, nowadays they smoke a bit 
 After work "Puff Puff" and don't want no one knowing it 
 Oops I let the cat out the bag, what a drag 
 Don't be mad fam here take a drag 
 I'm a pot smoking pot head, I'm not ashamed to say it 
 Never hide it like a coke head its way too complicated 
 I'm laid back feeling good, yeah I'm high maintenance 
 Puffing on a blunt go ahead try taking it 
 Rolling my weed another day goes by 
 I know what I need when I see the sun rise 
 I wanna believe I don't need to get high 
 But I gotta have it, 'cause I gotta habit, and I keep smokinggg 
 To maintain my high, smokin' 
 I need to maintain my high 
 Rolling my weed another day goes by 
 I know what I need when I see the sun rise 
 I wanna believe I don't need to get high 
 But I gotta have it, 'cause I gotta habit, and I keep smokinggg 
 We got that hashish, dope, weed, however you say it 
 When it comes to chronic smoke Canada we have the greatest 
 And all my freinds and peers have been smoking it for years 
 So it's hard for me to quit but I'm constantly contemplating 
 And my girls been complaining ever since her ovulating 
 Turned into her water breaking now she watches what she takes in 
 Cudo's to my lady, but if I'm not mistaken 
 She's the reason I smoke a lot, man she used to smoke a lot 
 I use to say, damn girl get off the dope, stop 
 When I tried it though we grew together like a growing op 
 She means well I know that, I'm not complaining 
 I'm just colour commenting, stepping back and observating 
 Shit I love it, but I see the complications 
 It's hard concentrating when I'm high song creating 
 Man I hate it, I mean I need it, I mean I hate it, I mean it 
 Shit I'm indecisive when I'm weeded 
 I need some hight maintenance, I know it's long awaited 
 Plus I feel my tonsil's aching think it's from the pot I take in 
 Rolling my weed another day goes by 
 I know what I need when I see the sun rise 
 I wanna believe I don't need to get high 
 But I gotta have it, 'cause I gotta habit, and I keep smokinggg 
 To maintain my high, smokin' 
 I need to maintain my high 
 Rolling my weed another day goes by 
 I know what I need when I see the sun rise 
 I wanna believe I don't need to get high 
 But I gotta have it, 'cause I gotta habit, and I keep smokinggg
