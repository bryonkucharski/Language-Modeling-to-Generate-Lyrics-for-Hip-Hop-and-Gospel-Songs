(Life is a bitch) It's a bitch, girl 
 But it's gone too far cause you know it don't matter anyway 
 (And then you die) 
 Now people come from the left and the right 
 And they try to get up on me 
 Don't do so, so why they step up to me raunchy (?) 
 You try to fool me but then you catch the backhand 
 Then you jump my friends so now it's on again yeah 
 Recognize ain't a damn thing changed 
 'Cause I'll still be the rhymesayer, still be the mind player 
 I'm playin' with your mind I'm playin' with your thoughts 
 But now it's back to business so check out what I brought 
 I'm bringin' tears to emcee's eyes 
 When they see me rise 
 People think I'm pleasin', but really gettin' even 
 Revenge is what I come back to prove 
 Come back to get, 
 Come back to move, 
 Come back to wreck 
 Check me out, check the mic out 
 Or put it back on the block till I say its time to rock 
 The clock strikes four, so I guess you want some more 
 The clock strikes five, so now it's time to classify 
 Classify you on the down-low, on the down road 
 Now you leave the stage cause you lost all your flow 
 You embarrass, garish like parish 
 Don't start hidin', raise your head and start flyin' 
 Start ridin' on the funk track that we produced 
 Now it's time to hang loose 
 Life's a bitch 
 (And then you die) 
 Do you like what you get? 
 Do you like what you see? 
 Do you like who I am? 
 And do you like who I be? 
 People comin' far and wide just to see Classified 
 But then I woke up, I wouldn't try to let the passion by 
 I ain't a liar but I'm learnin' to be higher 
 Life in a wreck here's a nickel on my bet 
 My luck's strippin' so I start to sink into the gutter 
 I'm down low and I need help from another 
 Your brother's on ya but this ain't nothin' new 
 Cause deep down inside you know he's just tryin' to get to you 
 You do what you do, 
 I'll do what I did 
 'Cause I'm leavin' face prints, and every single kid numb 
 Dissin' my style, it ain't me 
 But when I take my leap 
 I'm strikin' suckers in they sleep 
 You wake up, you see the marks Classified left 
 Life is a bitch and I'll sing it to my last breath 
 Here's my last one before I take my ride 
 1995, don't forget Classified 
 It's a bitch 
 And then you die
