(Oh Canada we stand on guard, for thee) 
 I told this guy where I was from 
 He said oh, Canada 
 Kinda laughs it off, real funny huh? 
 Yeah, uh, come on 
 (O Canada) 
 1-2, 1-2 
 Mic check, 1-2, 1-2 
 Yeah 
 (O Canada) 
 Uh, yeah 
 From the land of the lost 
 Trans-Canada crossed 
 Patriotic and a honor 
 With a hand on my heart 
 From the Greatest of Lakes 
 To the greenest of greens 
 To the Rockiest mountains 
 And everything in between 
 O-o-o Canada 
 Oh you're no fan of us? 
 'Cause our movie and TV shows are so amateur? 
 Yeah, we laugh it off, that don't really bother me 
 Look, we ain't serious unless we really gotta be 
 Humorous attitude like Kids in the Hall 
 Like Jim Carey, Mike Myers, hell we claiming them all 
 It's the Great White North 
 Home of the funniest actors 
 The brunt of the joke 
 With an abundance of laughter 
 The Red and White flag 
 Keep it high keep it visual 
 People say Canada and get stereotypical 
 Think we finish every sentence with buddy or bye 
 And if it ain't that its either dude, eh or guy 
 (Canadaka eh) 
 Yeah we consider it people 
 And smoking marijuana 
 We consider it legal 
 Still doing rap like the 1990's 
 But that's how we like it off timed and grimey 
 I know where I'm from and I told ya before 
 North of America hard to ignore 
 Every time I go away I tell them for sure 
 I'm from Canada o-o-o Canada 
 (O Canada) 
 O Canada o-o-o Canada 
 (O Canada) 
 I'm from Canada 
 O-o-o Canada 
 The Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic 
 The Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic 
 The Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic 
 The Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic 
 I've been around the globe and 
 Heard the confusion 
 Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid 
 Yes, we have microwaves, tvs and cell phones 
 Unintelligent fuck we invented the telephone 
 We made Yahtzee 
 The light bulb, hockey 
 And bred the greatest player's Gretzky to Crosby 
 We all got at least one drinking buddy 
 And after one drink, all of us think we're funny 
 Our national mascot's a damn beaver 
 O Canada we love our beaver 
 Home of Hell's Angels the RCMP 
 Home of Gordon Lightfoot and SCTV 
 The Underground Rail Road 
 Georges St. Pierre 
 Right here is where he calls home 
 Our health care system 
 Y'all know its free 
 Keep our girls banging with a full mouth of teeth 
 I won't even get into the music on the streets 
 They say hip hop is dead 
 Naw its up north with me 
 I could do this all day it's a part of my routine 
 But supper's almost done and tonight poutine 
 I know where I'm from and I told ya before 
 North of America hard to ignore 
 Every time I go away I tell 'em for sure 
 I'm from Canada o-o-o Canada 
 (I'm from the east coast of Canada) 
 O-o-o Canada 
 (I'm from the east east east coast) 
 Yo yo! 
 See I'm from Canada so sometimes the words come out of my mouth like this 
 Get used to it 
 (O Canada, we stand on guard for thee)
