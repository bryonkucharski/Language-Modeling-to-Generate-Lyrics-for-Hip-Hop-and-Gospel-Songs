To fully enjoy this recording do not, I repeat do not 
 Listen to it on your laptop, cellphone, or any place without bass 
 I need to here that (boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) yeeaaa, I need to here that 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 I've been desensitized, I've been exposed to the truth and 
 The lies, reality's part of our demise, look to the sky hands up 
 Like waah my eyes keep burning as I watch time fly 
 Everyday growing up was so sci fi, nothin' seemed real now I say bye bye 
 To the dreams and the fairy tales damn I tried, wish I paid no mind 
 Oh Oh my my, my lord, my god, I am a little odd, I am off the wall 
 Old school, yes sir, used to get exited seeing girls in there bra 
 Now I'm still soft till I get 'em out there drawers, awhh, back then I never saw 
 Any imperfections or flaws on these broads, naah, I feel spoiled gotta pause 
 Slow down I think I've seen it all I've been desensitized 
 I need something I can feel, everything around me used to overwhelm me 
 Think I've seen it all need to find another grail, everything I see 
 I gotta feel to believe, I'm desensitized 
 I've been at the same club way to long (yeah) 
 And I dunno what drink I'm on 
 1, 2, 3 shots 4 
 Doesn't really hit me no more 
 I've been at the same 
 I've been, I've been at the same club way, way to long 
 And I dunno what drink I'm on 
 Yeah, yeah, but drink on, drink on, but drink on, drink on 
 Drink oooonnnnnn 
 I need to be re-energized, back to the basics 
 No beginners guide, from my inner child 
 Never needed internet, no Wi-Fi 
 I've seen enough porn keep that window minimized 
 When I was a young guy I would chase your daughter 
 Never had no honour, cept when I was on her 
 Now I'm in the real world, dealin' with the monsters 
 Going international, Canada's conquered 
 Man someone turn the TV down 
 Shit so real, stereo, ace deuce around 
 I've seen the movies, TVs and news clips 
 Never killed a man, but I know how to do it 
 It takes a whole lot to shock me now 
 I've been through the deep waters and the rocky grounds 
 Now I need the enticement and in need of enlightment 
 Guess I'm overlooking the excitement, I'm desensitized 
 I need something I can feel, everything around me used to overwhelm me 
 Think I've seen it all need to find another grail, everything I see 
 I gotta feel to believe, I'm desensitized 
 I've been at the same club way to long (yeah) 
 And I dunno what drink I'm on 
 1, 2, 3 shots 4 
 Doesn't really hit me no more 
 I need to here that (boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) yeeaaa, I need to here that 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Boom, boom) Turn it up 
 (Turn it up) uh, yeah 
 Now if there's one thing I love about being classified 
 Its, getting free shit and not having to buy it 
 I'm getting used to the smiles and the kindness 
 Never though I would fit in this environment 
 Back then I was my own worst enemy 
 Now I'm getting used to this life, a celebrity 
 Used to have a hard time handling the spotlight 
 But now I'm numb to it all like frost bite 
 So repetitive, I feel like I've been injected with 
 The anaesthetic now it's slowly setting in 
 I'm drifting off and I wanna rest my eyes 
 Cause now a days nothings a surprise, I'm desensitized 
 I need something I can feel, everything around me used to overwhelm me 
 Think I've seen it all need to find another grail, everything I see 
 I gotta feel to believe, I'm desensitized 
 I've been at the same club way to long (yeah) 
 And I dunno what drink I'm on 
 1, 2, 3 shots 4 
 Doesn't really hit me no more 
 I've been at the same 
 I've been, I've been at the same club way, way to long 
 And I dunno what drink I'm on 
 Yeah, yeah, but drink on, drink on, but drink on, drink on 
 Drink oooonnnnnn
