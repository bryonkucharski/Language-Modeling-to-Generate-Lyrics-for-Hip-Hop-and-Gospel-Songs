(Feat. Tash, Mic Boyd) 
 Tash: 
 What's up Canada, ye, you know 
 We got caTash up in this bitch so everybody raise your cups up 
 I'm about to make a toast and after that, we gettin' fucked up 
 Yup yup, you know, and you ain't checkin' with an ammateur 
 Customs bust my balls, but I still made it through Canada 
 Right off the bat, I'm down the blue Labatt's 
 Now I'm creepin' through the party, they like 'who is that?' 
 Gettin' toe up from the floor, up in the LA Dodgers feathered cap 
 Drinks is kinda weak, bartender, gotta send them back 
 Put it on my tab, while I snatch and grab a couple glasses 
 Couple asses, cause my pick is so rowdy 
 Probably representin my city, under seized that's LA 
 California, north of cocaine and weed 
 But all I really need for me to see some shit in 3d 
 Is 3 bottles of rum, and a Classified CD 
 Another day, another stamp in my passport 
 So when you want to drink, you know who the fuck to ask for 
 Let it go, have a drink, take a sip 
 Everybody sit back, recline 
 When you work for the week, and you're stressed 
 And you're feelin' like you need to unwind 
 Pour a drink, raise your glass, make a toast 
 Tilt your head, put the glass in your mouth 
 Hold it there till the liquor flows out 
 And it slides down the back of your throat 
 Classified: 
 Ya, now I don't like how my liquor be tasting 
 But drink it every week for the intoxication 
 Straight up, you're wasted, drunk, inebriated 
 My tolerance is there, but it's not the greatest 
 Forget about the work week, and all the troubles son 
 Chug like you're thirsty, and grab another one 
 Feelin' the effect off of 3 or 4 beer 
 Cause in Canada, the alcohol percent is more here 
 Ya, I walk with a swagger in my step 
 Only 'cause I'm drunk, smell the Yagger on my breath 
 Takin' shots burn, like a dagger to the chest 
 So I switch back to beer, get the kegger out next 
 Still gettin' twisted, you know the deal 
 Pissin every 10 minutes since I broke the seal 
 This is classic attached, drink till we sloppy 
 I ain't alcoholic, I just got the same high beat 
 Let it go, have a drink, take a sip 
 Everybody sit back, recline 
 When you work for the week, and you're stressed 
 And you're feelin' like you need to unwind 
 Pour a drink, raise your glass, make a toast 
 Tilt your head, put the glass in your mouth 
 Hold it there till the liquor flows out 
 And it slides down the back of your throat 
 Yo Tash, you got the weed? (You, you, you know it) 
 It's Class who got the beats (You, you, you know it) 
 Crack open the beer (You, you, you know it) 
 Ya we got it this year (You, you, you know it) 
 Alkaholiks (You, you, you know it) 
 HalfLife (You, you, you know it) 
 Catastophy (You, you, you know it) 
 Class on the track (You, you, you know it) 
 Classified: 
 This is for the casual drinkers who don't know when to quit 
 For the underage kids wanna sip till they sick 
 For the ones who go to college to study abroad 
 Then they waste all day drinkin', studyin broads 
 How the fuck y'all feelin' out there 
 We got what you want 
 Y'all fucked up like me 
 We only drink to get drunk 
 So what's up California 
 What's up Nova Scotia 
 Say cheers! cheers 
 A toast for you here 
 Let it go, have a drink, take a sip 
 Everybody sit back, recline 
 When you work for the week, and you're stressed 
 And you're feelin' like you need to unwind 
 Pour a drink, raise your glass, make a toast 
 Tilt your head, put the glass in your mouth 
 Hold it there till the liquor flows out 
 And it slides down the back of your throat
