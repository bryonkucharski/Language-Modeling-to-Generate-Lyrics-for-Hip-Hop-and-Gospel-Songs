 Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet 
 We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set 
 Uh, yeah, night falls, days come and go 
 No retreat, stubborn, played the role 
 Held a grudge, seen it takes its toll 
 I guess it proves I still got a way to go 
 Got to stop being so hard headed and hard nosed 
 And get rid of the excess cargo, you know 
 Lighten up my carload 'cause I keep veeren on back down to her road 
 Uh ? I've been lied to and cheated on 
 I've been shit talked, beat down, treated wrong 
 And I won't forgive or forget 
 But I don't want to live with regret 
 And so I hope I can let go, move on 
 Try to forgive anybody who did Luke wrong 
 Yeah, right I can hold hope, hoping it'll do but I don't think I got the will to 
 Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet 
 We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set 
 He goes, balls to the walls till I drop 
 Love what I am, hate what I'm not 
 I no longer talk or text message 
 Any exgirlfriends or these exbestfriends 
 Who left me stress and this neck tension 
 And who never paid any dues but expect pension 
 So that's what the friendship is suspended 
 And if you thought I'd forget guess again 
 I don't have it in me. I don't have the discipline 
 Eye for an eye, the adreneline is kicking in 
 Burn me once then it's shame on you 
 If I let it happen twice than it's shame on me 
 Okay, I get it, this is part of the vicious 
 Cycle we live in so I'm forgivin 
 Still gittin heated with anyone who burns us 
 I won't hold a grudge but I'm still tryin' to learn to 
 Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet 
 We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set 
 The day doesn't die... 
 The day doesn't die... 
 The day doesn't die... 
 The day doesn't die... 
 The day doesn't die... 
 Sometimes I think I'm a rebel 
 But I'm trying to be the bigger man and never sink to your level 
 I try to stay subtle in all my neighbours drama 
 They're tellin' the police that I'm growing marajuana 
 Thanks. Ya lyin' punk bitch ass wipe 
 Pricks comes and go every day that's life 
 And truth be told many other episodes occurred 
 But you ain't worth my time for a full verse 
 Shit, I forgive I never will 
 Forget. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet 
 We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set 
 Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet 
 We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set
