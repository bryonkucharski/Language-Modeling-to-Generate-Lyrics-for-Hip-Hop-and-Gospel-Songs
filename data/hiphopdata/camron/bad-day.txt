Tom Gist: 
 I got problems, naw, I'm no flossin' 
 Notice in the lobby, there's no high raw 
 No jobs so I'm forced to be a nemisis 
 Notice on my door, them days lead to premisice 
 I can't be a straight dude 
 My girl said "There's something in the oven nigga, and it ain't food" 
 Sometimes I wanna slap her fuckin' lips off 
 Went to see my P.O. had to drop this off 
 I remember life was easy playin' kickball 
 Now I'm outcasted like Big Boi, playing with the big boys 
 And my day's straight horrible 
 Black boy slain, no need to read the article 
 I can't afford not to be selfish 
 Lookin' for a job is like lookin' for Elvis 
 Got my mind gone halfway 
 Today was a bad day 
 Tom Gist: 
 My nigga just got locked up again and shit 
 (Today was a bad day) 
 Grandma's gotta go back to the hospital 
 (Today was a bad day) 
 Tom Gist: 
 All I got is my word, a pad and a pen 
 Hey, them jokes ain't funny today 
 Hey, old folks say son just pray 
 Hey, so I can be broke, old, and gray, nay 
 Barely made it through last night 
 I spent my last on a oil change and there goes the gas, light 
 Damn dude the streets is sour 
 Even papi in a problem now, there's no more powder 
 Death might be my best bet 
 I'm wildin', throw some beats on in my headset 
 Rob called like "Waddup, duke" 
 "Same shit, yeah, this day was fucked up too" 
 Startin' to feel hungry, lookin' at my watch 
 'Bout to test my credit at the Chinese spot 
 Stay strong is what my dad say 
 (I hear you talkin' pops) 
 Today was a bad day 
 Tom Gist: 
 Fuckin' label told me I'm not what they lookin' for and shit man 
 (Today was a bad day) 
 Lil' cousin hit me talkin' 'bout she pregnant, she 15 man 
 (Today was a bad day) 
 Cam'ron: 
 Bacon, pig feet, all haul (chitlins) 
 Fall, small, feelin' like O-Dog 
 The F.B.I. got Shiest (Not Bub) 
 Zeke got knocked right, and I almost got life 
 And his bail was a hot price, not nice 
 Y'all shot dice, I got shot twice 
 And the feds heard my murder raps 
 Said my name was Killa, they put me on a murder rap 
 And they know it's absurd to rat 
 They ask me anyway 
 Nope, I never heard of that 
 My wifey going psycho 
 Sais she need the green, not the gecko from Geico 
 Mess wit' her, not the hottest chance 
 Told me write her some letters, only we out of stamps 
 Stood back in my mack stance, lack dance 
 Fine luxury, give him a lap dance 
 Left the crib and I'm posting 
 Squalie pulled me over, scoping 
 What's the commotion 
 Two people got killed in Harlem 
 Word to say today was a bad day 
 Cam'ron: 
 Today was a bad day 
 Today was a bad day 
 Today was a bad day 
 Today was a bad day
