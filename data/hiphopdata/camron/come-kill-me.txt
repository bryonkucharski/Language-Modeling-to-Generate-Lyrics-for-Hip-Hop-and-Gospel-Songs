 No doubt 
 You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
 Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
 Yo check it out now, uh, yo, yo 
 Yo subliminal thoughts, 107th street, criminal court 
 Pissy drunk up in here, Gordon, Gin the court 
 It's like a biscuit, judging my dick though, case acquitted 
 When it's dough I do whatever it takes to get it 
 So, chain danglers, are in danger 
 When I skate wit ya ice like the Rangers, assume later 
 Boss bitch though, goin' out like Tomb Raider 
 Booth razors, a few blazers, who raised him 
 He speak Eboni-, me and my goddaughter C-Hanni 
 Come through with the mean Tommy, ask you if you seen mommy 
 And she three feet behind me 
 Why my whole life is like the repeat of Gahndi 
 Me and G O D, from C O C, like got dough C O D 
 A S A P, A S A P 
 Play me, you crazy, and your mother ass fat 
 So I laid her on her stomach bust your brothers on her back 
 Never rubber on or cap, I'm a raw specialist 
 Make me more devilish, me and my whores never kiss 
 Though, motherfucker we was prone to die 
 Just my green top, yo we own inside, motherfucker 
 You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
 Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
 We gon ball till we fall, gon ride in the five 
 Keep pies in our eyes, stay high till we die 
 You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
 Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
 We keep a clip in our shit, keep a brick on the trip 
 Keep a chick in the whip, gettin' licked the six 
 Ayo they used to call me "Work Out" 
 'Cause before I brought my work out, I used to work out 
 Niggas wanna make deals, na na I want work out 
 Now murk out, before you get cursed out 
 Bangin' they fun, same as the sun 
 Hidin from the church when you slang to the nuns 
 Chumps come through with giraffe and orangatang guns 
 Vetty vest, you petty theft, you seem soft 
 I'm seven judges up in Supreme Court 
 Mean thoughts all over a teen porch 
 Wait, don't have to tell you shit 
 Matter fact, pat him down, who the hell you wit? 
 Yo you wack money, wait around all day for pack money 
 Get a gold chain talkin' 'bout you bout to have money 
 But everything's gonna to be all right, why 
 'Cause every ring's gonna be all ice and 
 You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
 Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
 This nigga with the ice mug stuntin? [He won't bust nothing] 
 Yo, talkin' bout he gon' touch somethin' [He won't bust nothing] 
 Yo sayin' that he too much frontin [He won't bust nothing] 
 Yo, he just a fake thug bluffin [He won't bust nothing] 
 And his man with the ice grill frontin [He won't kill nothing] 
 Yo, he outside with the mil frontin [He won't kill nothing] 
 Talkin' bout he some real somethin' [He won't kill nothing] 
 Sayin' yo I'ma kill something! [He won't kill nothing] 
 Not a collecter of Picasso, but everybody in my scepter got dough 
 Neglect a rock row, go to charve and not dough ho 
 But Hector, Comancho, mi amigo rockin' in the side bitch 
 ?Maxin out to Marvin?, can't know it 
 That's why I keep the BLAM BLAM loaded 
 Club grand open, next week we grand close it, come and kill me 
 Get the fuck outta here! This shit is fuckin' closed! 
 Get the fuck outta here motherfucker I'll kill you!
