(Chorus] [Jermaine Dupri) 
 Ayyo a Pimps a Pimp 
 Flow is flow 
 Doe is do 
 Ho's a ho 
 Chic's a chic 
 Trick's a trick 
 Bitch a bitch across the world 
 So nigga getcha money and attend to your girl 
 (Cam'ron) 
 Now when it comes to these hoes I did'em I got'em 
 Rip'em and rock'em 
 But if I hit'em I pop'em 
 But if I lick'em I lock'em 
 And I ain't famous at all 
 Let my game tell it all 
 But they a pain in my balls 
 Got to train'em like dogs 
 From how they, walk and they talk and when they sit on the couch 
 To how they, lick in they mouth and never shit in the house 
 But I make, babies with babies 
 Let the street drive'em crazy 
 They say "Cam, good you saved me" 
 Now I pimp'em and they pay me 
 They feelin' it like Jay-Z 
 Or Suger Hill like AZ 
 When Party Time like plainly 
 I'm So-So Def like JD 
 Oh baby they have you stressed, nigga 
 Mad depressed 
 I want they mind... Muthafucka, you could have the rest 
 'Cause I gas'em up, I tell them I'm more than just the lover 
 I want to be your friend, father, confidant and brother 
 See my, nine-inch slugger now she, chose her devotion 
 With messing with my money, girl you messing with my emotion 
 Now baby-cakes what's you're name? 
 (Ain't no need to explain) 
 Why is that? 
 ('Cause I'm from Down South) 
 Well I got Down South game 
 And to mess wit' you this my last attempt 
 'Cause I only like when you're ass is bent 
 So they're dumb they're sashin 
 You ain't know why you catch their pimp? 
 Go ask him, my whores are fresh 
 So I afforded them 
 'Xplore the rest 
 Tell you now backdoor's the best 
 For the stress 
 We never raw in flesh 
 Why I'm sores aguess (?) 
 I done pay for yeah I stack them chips 
 Condoms when I grab them hips 
 Kiss and mix you wrap them lips 
 And if she act (smack the bitch) 
 If she wack (smack the bitch) 
 Sad to see the way it had to be 
 Smack the bitch the bitch don't smack me 
 Cupid's snap me but so are mine on my lines 
 Yo, my rhymes got a concubine 
 'Cause I control they mind 
 Avoid the crew 
 'Void the groove 
 Got more doe, than the fued 
 Got more hoes, than the few 
 If I die they wouldn't know what to do 
 Whatcha think all they do is cry? 
 Tell you this between you and I 
 Forty slit wrists outta the forty nine suicide 
 And now I'm drunk of the Henny now 
 Went off the Remmy now 
 Niggaz always envy now 
 'Cause I'm good and plenty now 
 And when it come to gettin' head, yo many bow 
 Girls acting friendly now 
 (Killa c'mon feel me OWWW) 
 I leave'm past sleeping 
 Last weekend 
 I took Cardin to get his ass eatin 
 He said you pass freepin' 
 But I'ma ace so throw your cards up 
 But if you stink baby, I ain't hard up 
 Parl' up 
 To wash up 
 But that's insulting 
 Revolting 
 But if you clean we ballin' 
 Eat you till you catch convultions 
 And girls all feen, for the bod 
 On my team and my mob 
 Think we scheme and we rob the way they screamin' for God 
 And all sluts, with he V's 
 Let'em see how it be 
 They be like "No, you ain't puttin' all that meat up in me" 
 You wil'in out 
 For the styinout 
 Girls say I'm foul and doubt 
 But baby got to understand 
 That's what my style's 'bout 
 Ayyo a Pimp's a pimp
