 Verse 2 
 Penz: 
 I'ma relax with the haze in back of the stage 
 And shit I smoke the same color as Saint Patrick's Parade 
 Yeah, keep a Mac and a gauge packin', attackin' wit' rage 
 Stackin' and mackin' until they put my ass back in the cave 
 I'm actually brave, this beats easy to cook 
 I'm on my Peter Pan shit, I don't need me a Hook 
 Got 100 of bars, spittin', I done it with stars 
 You ain't gotta take my shirt off to see none of my scars 
 I was locked down, 500 Pearl Street 
 Look now, Nextel, 500 girls deep 
 And ya girl a freak cuz the kid handle green 
 But she wax, shorty breath smell like tangerines 
 F defense, homeboy handle me

 Where is son from, all I need is one gun
