(Guy singing) 
 I need a freak 
 I need a freak 
 Girl I need a freak 
 I'm the one who is the low-key Don 
 Dick stay hard, call me Pokemon 
 'Cause I'm the one they call Cutie pie 
 I'm the one with the Gucci tie 
 I'm the one with the brand new Benz, droopy eye 
 That's the one they said "I knew he'd buy" 
 I'm the one who be fly 
 I'm the one that hit it from the back, dookie pie 
 Oh, you ain't gon' sue me right? 
 What's that there? your coochie (aye!) 
 I'm the one to play it off 
 I'm hard already girl, make it soft 
 Sisqo wants to see your thong, I wanna see you take it off 
 Or I'll pull it to the side, break it off 
 Right to left, up and down, front to back 
 Turn around, head down, I wanna hit it from the back. 
 (Chorus - (man singing)) 
 I need a freak 
 I want a freak 
 That's what I need tonight 
 At every club I like a freak 
 I need a freak 
 I need a nasty girl, girl I need a freak 
 I met this one girl smokin' a blunt 
 I went to her house, she starts to front 
 Nah, I gotta potty, why you teasin'? 
 Pulled out my dick, why you cheesin'? 
 Then while I hit it, why you wheezin'? 
 Hold up girl, why you sneezin'? 
 Pull out my dick, why you bleedin'? 
 When I get my clothes, "why you leavin'?" 
 But Ma had chrome to play wit' 
 Shoes by Joan and David 
 When I was in the whip I asked for dome, she gave it 
 "Ooh, I taste it" 
 "Ooh, my favorite" 
 That girl had me out my thug 
 I liked her alot but her mouth I loved 
 Right to left, up and down, front to back 
 Turn around, head down, I wanna hit it from the back. 
 Females, go 'head, act surprised 
 Y'all like sex more than guys 
 Pop the question, they get silly 
 You got your period? "umm, not really" 
 What's that mean to be polite? 
 "It's the last day and it's real light" 
 Yeah right, you leak leaky 
 Call me next week, I'm not that freaky 
 Some girls come for a dance 
 See that fat ass all in a stance 
 All I do is a touch or a glance 
 You won't have Killa Cam bust in his pants.
