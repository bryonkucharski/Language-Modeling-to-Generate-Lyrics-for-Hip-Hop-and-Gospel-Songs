[Cam'ron] (intro) 
 You do what you do where you live 
 I do what I do where I live 
 That's what makes me nigga, and that's just the way it is nigga 
 Uh, Killer, uh, Prease, uh, Vacant Lot, Diplomat, uh 
 Killer, family nigga, yo, uh, Killer, uh, yo yo yo... 
 (Verse one) {:28} 
 Where I'm from kids get it hectic 
 But get arrested but get respected 
 Piss infested, dislexic 
 Take caution money, for extortion money 
 Girls fate just for abortion money 
 Honey no day you'll play me on 
 Flip water, nuttin' like avion 
 Type a shit my niggas get gravy on 
 Money missin', might find your baby gone 
 The way we bond, Cam got ta spray these arms 
 Have you relocate, like Kay Reconn (?) 
 Crazy don, crazy cons girl fuck 
 Put they ladies on, me I'll go crazy on? 
 One chick told me give her a loan 
 Shit, only thing I leave you is alone 
 Indeed you could bone, lemme read you a poem 
 Mom no good for ya, it's da hood for ya 
 My hood (hood!), hoes (hoes!), thugs (thugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 My hood (hood!), guns (guns!), drugs (drugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 Yo yo yo 
 (Verse two) {1:30} 
 Now it's gangs out here 
 Cats pass we flaggin', blue 'n' red rags we braggin 
 Look out y'all, here the padon wagon 
 Cops or punks, hit 'em with the pump 
 Nigga wanna front, Killer give 'em what they want 
 Roll 'em up in the rug, dump they body in the trunk 
 Eat hoe heat low kill slow like mosquito 
 Now we dead if I ever did doubt of her 
 You want these streets? tryin' to get out of 'em 
 Gotta leave 'fore they see Cam fold 
 Where they don't speak Englas or Espaniol, no 
 Where I go they don't spit that rap, they say 
 "Ching chang maka halia" 
 Yeah, shit like that! 
 Get my gat, click my clack 
 Cam's killin' this, I write for niggas 
 Am I a vantriloquiste? 
 Ya feelin' this, niggas pump ya krills ta dis 
 Be careful, Harlem World will get this 
 My hood (hood!), hoes (hoes!), thugs (thugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 My hood (hood!), guns (guns!), drugs (drugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 Yo yo yo... 
 (Verse three) {2:38} 
 Cats wanna talk shit, I don't throw back trash at 'em 
 I come through in a drop top, laugh at 'em 
 Wit the girls behind me, bout ta throw a pass at 'em 
 They with me stupid, now Ma, blast at 'em 
 Cats fire when I'm walkin' by like JFK junior, y'all talkin' fly 
 I give 'em Macaulay Culkin lie, Dolly Parton high, they all can buy 
 Got it for sale 
 And I don't run the crack spot 
 Opperation is a jag drop, rag mop, access with a laptop 
 One of the have-nots to brick money 
 Then I came through in the six yummy 
 Ya whole click sick tummy 
 But be careful, out in this game 
 Buyers, supliers, yo they wearin' wires 
 But come up in the world, if I twirl you fry 
 Got killed like a bitch hair; curled and dyed 
 My hood (hood!), hoes (hoes!), thugs (thugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 My hood (hood!), guns (guns!), drugs (drugs!) 
 What it is it good for? absolutely nothin' nothin' nothin'... 
 Yo yo yo, yo this for every hood 
 Every poverty, my whole NYC Harlem eastside 
 My cats down in ATL you win! keep it krump Miami 
 Keep it off the chain, Cat Gatti I see you in Green Borough 
 Get money, VA my guys out in CHI-town, the whole cali 
 Westside, LA, bay area, Dego, Houston, Dallas, Memphis 
 Keep it krump, Detroit, I see everybody 
 Every hood, every ghetto, everything is a poverty 
 We love y'all, Dip-Set, Killer Cam, Jim Jones, Freaky, hoo!
