 With the goons I spy 
 Stay in tune with ma 
 She like damn 
 This the realest since kumbaya 
 Kumbyay killa Cam my lord 
 Still the man with pants 
 Scrill fam oh boy 
 They want neuter me 
 They want do to me 
 The hooligan in hoolahands 
 Maneuvering is nothin' new to me 
 Doggy I'm from the land of crime 
 Pan pan gram or dime 
 Not toes or MC 
 When I say hammertime 
 Beef I'm hammer mine 
 When I get my hands on nines 
 If I had on bammerline 
 Cordourys Cam will shine 
 Canary burgundy 
 I call it lemon red 
 Yellow diamonds in my ear 
 Call 'em lemonheads 
 Lemonhead end up dead 
 Ice like guinea peg 
 Gemstones, Flintstones 
 You could say I'm friends with Fred 
 You want happy scrappy 
 I got pataki at me 
 Bitches say I'm tacky daddy 
 Range look like laffy taffy

 I'm from where Nicky Barns got rich as fuck 
 Rich and Nay hit the kitchen, they were pitchin' up 
 Rob base mase doug e fresh switched it up 
 I do both who am I to fuck tradition up 
 So I parked in a tow-away zone 
 Chrome I don't care 
 I'll call it throwaway homes 
 Welcome to Harlem 
 Where you welcome to problems 
 Off a furlow fella fellas get parkings 
 Canabuy banks 
 Stand out like puty tanks 
 Soon as the studie sings 
 That when the tudy sing 
 Bang bang came from that movie rang 
 Snap crack jewelry bling 
 Flat jack who he bring 
 Clack clack cooley ring 
 Bad rap cuties claim 
 Ascap put 'em in the river 
 I'm the sushi king 
 And I'm keep it fresh 
 Let the fish eat ya flesh 
 Yes sir please confess 
 Just say he's the best

 How dope is this 
 Teach you how to rope a chick 
 What you want 
 Coke or piff 
 I got it all smoke or sniff 
 And you know my drift 
 Used to figures doe and shit 
 You a roosted bitch 
 Just a roasted bitch 
 And I roast ya bitch 
 That how I usually am 
 Tell her and her groupie friends 
 Go get they gucci cleanse 
 We the moody gucci louie and pucci men 
 A skada prada 
 The chopper it got the uzi lens 
 Bird's eye view 
 The birds I knew 
 Flip birds 
 Birds gang 
 It was birds I flew 
 And word I flew 
 Or herb I grew 
 I would serve on stoops 
 Now it swerve in coupes
