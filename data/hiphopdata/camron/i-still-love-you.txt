I still love you babe 
 I'm still for you girl 
 I'll never leave you baby 
 'Cause I realize I need you in my life 
 Girl it just ain't right 
 What we said last night 
 'Cause I know we didn't mean it 
 You feel the love is gone 
 'Cause we don't get along 
 But I can prove you wrong 
 Girl I swear 
 'Cause every time I close my eyes I see you 
 And how I wanna live my life with you 
 There is no one 
 You're all I need and all I want 
 The only one I'll ever love 
 In this relationship we spend alot of time 
 Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine 
 Girl, I know we've had our share of ups and downs 
 But it doesn't mean that we can't work this out 
 Oh baby girl, I care, yeah 
 You know I do 
 'Cause every time I close my eyes I see you 
 And how I wanna live my life with you 
 There is no one else 
 You're all I need and all I want 
 The only one I'll ever love 
 No, oh girl, I know I need ya baby 
 'Cause every time I close my eyes I see you 
 And how I wanna live my life with you 
 There is no one else 
 You're all I want and all I need 
 The only one I'll ever love 
 Next, in 9-7 ya'all
