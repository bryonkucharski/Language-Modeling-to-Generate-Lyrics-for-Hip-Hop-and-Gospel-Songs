Killa 
 'For leaf big blowgun, fag nigga's bitch, doj' an' 
 Peach chrome, sick Rover, Zeke home so bend over 
 He looked at me and said "Killa I'll be your kitchen pitcher, the bing was rough" 
 I said nigga I did the bid wit' ya 
 Capiche, not Mona Lisa it's the big picture 
 Six scriptures, six blickers, grip triggers, strip niggaz 
 The Big Dipper, swig liquor, big liver 
 Now that you home watch the shit differ, I dig nigga 
 Soon as a nigga whisper, believe we jiggin' Jigga 
 He Elton Brand in a barber chair, he'll get the Clippers 
 I don't care who you are, the point, don't be stupid pa 
 We celebrities with guns, shooting stars 
 Yeah remove ya bras, a few of ours in through-in cars 
 Spray 21, Blackjack, I knew ya cards 
 Kid roll, Peter Rowe like Kennedy 
 Friends with me at the graveyard, visits from old enemies 
 Some bitched, some snitched, some owed us dough 
 Piss on the tombstone, write on it, "Told you so" 
 Check my portfolio, I was poor then rose to dough 
 KNow what I'm about in a drought I score, overflow 
 I'm the waterboy, wet work for water call 
 The price is nice, TLC, some waterfalls 
 Fiends snort it all, this fact I report to y'all 
 Go inside, extort them all, from short to tall you oughta ball 
 And where the ballas live and all my friends all to win 
 This the second time around, that shit you call again 
 Damn yo' lady fine, you been on yo' baby grind 
 Me I'm 86, highest temp, P-89s 
 Everyday we shine, fine, don't pay me mind 
 My watches are retarded, you can call 'em crazy times 
 Mines are more than brothers 
 We gon' rock till the Range, Benz, and Porsches clutter 
 Garage, assorted colors 
 Yeah Crayola box, for that, payola doc 
 I'll lay you over a stroller with the strangest odor ock 
 Is it over not, huh, we immune to you 
 We shoot the wake up, striaght up and dead the funeral 
 Ay yo hold the fuck up 
 I said we gon' shoot the wake up and dead the fu-- 
 You dead already we gon' dead the fu-- 
 Matter fact son, bring that shit back up, fuck it 
 And you heard Rell, I do worst than foul 
 They murdered Roberta, lawyer murdered murder trials 
 We deserve to style, walk on Persian tile 
 On the island with millions, Durst to Al 
 I get cake in layers, not the Daily News 
 But when I flip, I make the papers, hate the mayor 
 I'm a gangsta, I fuck ma, go date a player 
 Man these dudes are fish market, straight fillet ya 
 Went to war with Kromo, then Pataki 
 Then Guilliani, then I went to North Cackalacky 
 What you gon' tell a mobster, cake was hella proper 
 No Petey Pablo when I saw them helicopters 
 That's the letter niggaz, trinckets from the ghetto bird 
 Her word said I gave the whole ghetto birds 
 Man your case go find it, need a new assignment 
 That ain't giving out, first of all that's call for silent 
 Contest to play 
 You got no gunwounds, jail time, felonies, real shit on your resume 
 I get you extra yay, not tomorrow, yesterday 
 If they ask, never say, snitch and we never play, ay
