 (Cam'Ron talking over the chorus) 
 Uh... killa... Dip Set... Santana... Freaky... Jim Jones 
 Yo, yo, yo, the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely 
 Little faggot motherfucker like (Mike Lightly) 
 Tried to get someone to pop my chain 
 Getting robbed dog, is not my game 
 My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang 
 Reversed the situation, popped his chain 
 Be happy we ain't pop his brain 
 Aiyoo, I treat that show money, Mike... 
 Like it's coke money, aight? 
 So you better have it, consequence could be a casket 
 I'm beyond forensic, a menace wit' a matic 
 I'ma leave 'em in the streets just splattered 
 Beat and battered, fuck cops, police don't matter

 Triple no, Come on, Bs Up, Dip Set, uh 
 Yo, aiyyo I pop to my name 
 With not a dollar, not a cent, not a rock to my name 
 Yo I'ma keep it funky dog to hop my chain 
 For a block and cocaine, now it's back to my block and cocaine 
 You know, re-in up, and fillin' up them pots with cocaine 
 Then you chop it up, and bottle up and top the cocaine 
 Got watch for the cops and dey chains 
 For them diplomatic affairs, automatic'll flare 
 I whips everything from automatics to gears 
 Yeah, you know sticks I clutch 'em 
 Shots with 6 I bust em, cop kicks to scuff 'em 
 Fuck 'em, hop out the 6 and crush 'em 
 Hop in the 6 and dust 'em, BOOM

 Turn your whole crew into +Dodgers+ like +Tommy Lasorda+ 
 Jimmy Jones 
 Yeah, come on 
 So you faggots have that money in order 
 Jim'll come through in wolves and let the hungry extort ya' 
 Now how is that for the drama suspense? 
 Any beef, our piranhas get sent 
 Kidnap your momma for rent 
 Hot shots from the beretta'll a fly 
 I'm breakin' bread with my guys, we want 'em dead or alive
