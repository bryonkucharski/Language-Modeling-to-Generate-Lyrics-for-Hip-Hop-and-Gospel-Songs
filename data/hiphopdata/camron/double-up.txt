Yo y'all niggaz wit the muscle y'all get clapped in the tussle 
 I'mma hustler, not a rapper bitch, rap is my hustle 
 Show a nigga know yo, we the 1st teen millionaires in Harlem 
 Since rich and poor, you don't know, get to know 
 Ain't takin' shit to left, Jimmy Jones rock and jock 
 Right back to the block and cock, it ain't hop and scotch 
 It's pop and scotch, in a bar they go shot for shot, 
 Matter of fact, outside the bar they go shot for shot 
 Me and my codie on a O-Z, we go rock for rock, 
 Me and my codie on a role we go rock for rock, 
 You souped up, think I'm easy to touch, 
 Then you been watchin' a little bit of TV, too much, 
 Lots of rhymes, so you see my ass lots of times 
 On the corner still, like I ain't got a dime 
 Autographs not the kind to be signin' the crap, 
 Here's a CD, slash here's a dime of that crack 
 Nigga double up, keep all guns double clutch, 
 Shoot at yo feet, make you jump like double dutch, 
 New York baby, for you matchbox nigga'z 
 Take away the French fry, snack box niggaz 
 I know lookin' at my jewerly is scarrin yo brain 
 Not to mention Jada Pinkett over parkin' the range 
 (Yo that's Will Smith girl) naw she's part of my chain 
 Pardon my game, car gettin' washed in the rain 
 Runnin' yo trap, that'll get you one in yo back 
 The hood that I had, had to take the good with the bad 
 Like Joe on the run, put his fuckin' P O it's done 
 Low on his funds, had to get the coke or the guns 
 Word to the wise, killa Cam, I heard of them guys 
 Diplomat, crisp black, yo convertible fives 
 Rims on the wheel, to drive down shows in the South 
 Rap ain't that great neither, I got coke to give out 
 Stroke to give out, motherfuckin smoke to give out 
 Hoes to give out, naw we ain't over this route 
 Back on the street, Jimmy get the crack on the street 
 Tour over motherfucka let's get back on our feet 
 Verse 3: Un (whispering) 
 Ay yo it's un bitch shhhhh it's un bitch 
 CEO joint bitches, punk bitches 
 I'mma let you know so you get it right 
 I don't rap nigga but I'mma spit it right 
 Make a nigga, go to church and pray 
 Nigga'z first day, and his first deal 
 Leased his first beamer now y'all tussle 
 2 against 4, now on y'all youngsta'z 
 Gone respond, walk out the rusty 
 Car, what y'all stand on, fuck the tabloids 
 Y'all little men, I be Un man 
 ??? Charli Baltimore and Lil' Kim 
 And y'all can't see these flows, 
 If you wanna be stars see the CEO
