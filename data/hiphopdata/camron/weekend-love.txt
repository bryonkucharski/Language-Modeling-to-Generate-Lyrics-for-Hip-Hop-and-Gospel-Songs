Uh, Killa 
 Harlem World, '89, black Jordans they were mine 
 Hund'-eighth, Toy Dork is the only one ever pay me mine 
 Baby my lady fine (fine) you ever date a dime (dime) 
 Before your favorite rhymes, had gator lime 
 Major crime made me grind, copped fancy heat 
 You know, hater time, cat food, fancy feast 
 Dated Nancy niece, she like candy treats 
 Goddamn she sweet, we did the Lancy Street 
 We hopped the D-train, you don't understand us freezed 
 No hassle heifer, did we battle, never 
 We went Easter shoppin', coppin' them tassled leathers 
 From Gimbals we gained, make it simple and plain 
 I wanna nibble on ya ear, rekindle the flame 
 I'm God's child, but yeah I got devilish game 
 Once you meddle with Cam, ma'am, it's never the same 
 So you through with the peekin', you pursuin' and seekin' 
 You know the season, Killa 
 What you doin' this weekend, huh, Killa 
 (Weekend Love) 
 You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be 
 You could be, you could be, you could be 
 (And I don't have time on the weekend) 
 You could be my, you could be my 
 (Weekend Love) 
 You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be 
 You could be, you could be, you could be 
 (Then maybe we can try to work it out) 
 Uh, Killa 
 Some say that I'm belligerent, others say that I'm ignorant 
 I don't just experiment, intimate not my sentiment 
 Everyday at the tenement, yayo like I invented it 
 Scrambled just like eggs, like eggs they're Benedict 
 They don't ever remember shit, all they want is their membership 
 Only one that they gettin' is Jenkins, that's the end of it 
 They want designer recliner along with benefits 
 Won't take a risk, but wanna spread the mick 
 Wipe 'em off my agenda quick, I need the other gender thick 
 You seen my Monday to Fridays, I need a Friday to Sunday 
 We'll eat Friday's on Fridays, and go to Sunday's on Sundays 
 Drink a little liquor, maybe twist a L 
 Play catch and kiss, if you don't kiss and tell 
 Take the city bus, or come through with chauffers 
 We could do Air Ones hun or Louis loafers 
 Yeah I'm truly focused, take down your Snoopy posters 
 Put up Killa Season, now who the reason 
 Come through this weekend, huh, huh 
 Uh, Killa, Killa, Killa 
 I drive big cars, puff heaven haze 
 Not just the weekend, that's seven days 
 Rev up the engine, not a lemon, it's lemon 
 That's the color, wanna play 7-11 
 You know, catch and hump, your butt got a extra rump 
 Forget ya man, extra clip, extra pump 
 Don't mean to be extra, but ma, extra stunts 
 Extra money, extra piff, extra blunts 
 Extra, extra, really some neck I want 
 Not the dude for help, but you're truly felt 
 Ass fat, stomach flat, I could see ya Louis belt 
 Mine on too, for any gunplay 
 I'm a troublemaker, yeah yeah, some say 
 You model material, you need a runway 
 So let's runaway, we could hit the runway 
 Round-trip not a one way, come play 
 Rio Friday, Spain on Saturday 
 Back on Sunday, make work Monday
