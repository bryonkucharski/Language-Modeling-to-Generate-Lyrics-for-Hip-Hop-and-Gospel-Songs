(Feat. Penz) 
 (Verse 1: Penz) 
 I'm seein everything, from currupt politics 
 To my cop killers runnin' loose with the hollow tips 
 Niggaz poppin' shit, body bags, pop em' quick 
 Sometimes it's like only me that acknoledge this 
 When you rapidly movin, shootin and runnin' through life 
 There's a chance you can crash, loser be under the pike (Damn) 
 Man I thought I was nice, runnin' and pumpin the white 
 Then I slipped the interrogation room, I'm under the light 
 I felt the pressure, they test ya, and try to make ya rat 
 But I'm ahead of the weather, so I'm a take the wrap 
 I was ready cop, time in ready for shot 
 Then the feds startin talkin' bout I was heavy with rocks 
 It's the life that I live, shit'll stay right in my crib 
 Movement from the allen to the feds extra indited the kid 
 Now they pressin me hard, talkin' bout attendin the L 
 District attorny like "I recommend you to tell" 
 But I live by zoo, scavenger homie a beast 
 Calabar backsmackin you cowards that boney and weak 
 Stop flippin them dimes, 'cause if you can't do your time 
 Homeboy, you not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 (Hook: Penz) 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 (Verse 2: Cam'ron*) 
 Yo, won't hear a sound from your kids 
 They'll get found by the bridge 
 In a fridge, it's cold, you ain't around for the bibs 
 Keep the pounds by the ribs, I ain't down for your fibs 
 So high, yo I had to lie your cuffs around the crib 
 Where I used to live, but the truth of it is 
 We is always on the run, I'm harborin a fugitive 
 Dust and dirt, they comin' in with the cuffs and they hurt 
 Chirp, we must be alert, harry start flushin the work 
 I see the canines y'all, put the guns in the cieling (man, shut the fuck) 
 I get the numbest feelin', like I'm done with dealin' 
 Me, James, and Duke, this ain't no fed tale 
 They came in 10 deep 12 guages, red shells 
 Now I'm thinkin' of foreman, tanya, maybe lawrence 
 Could be they correspondents, do I got any warrants (shit) 
 Who droppin' the dimes, fast forward unlock your mind 
 To the block of mine, off of weed sold 15, copped out the nine 
 When it rains, it pours, we never seen it drizzle 
 He got foreign shit, I've seen many nickel 
 I ain't being fickle, these shots, they gon' tickle 
 My money, honey, bun bun, I love to see it trickle 
 Vista seas are trickles, (huh) more than sniffles 
 Pull the pistol on yourself, it'll leave you crippled 
 Stop flippin them dimes, if you can't do your time 
 Homeboy, you ain't fuckin' fit for the grind 
 (Hook: Penz) 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind 
 You not fuckin' fit for the grind
