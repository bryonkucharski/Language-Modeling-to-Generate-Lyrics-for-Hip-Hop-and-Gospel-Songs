(But I still get in trouble) killa, uh, but what, uh 
 Mami all on me 'cause I'm touchin' her belly 
 I'm on butter pirelli's 
 Wit' purple and yellow, hello 
 That's butter and jelly 
 I flip butter on celly's 
 All right in front of the deli 
 Holly, lilly, to kelly all spent once on the telly 
 (And what else) and I got hella gear 
 My earring is nice the price 
 3 townhomes in delaware 
 Uh tomato porsche lookin' like tomato sauce 
 Hip hop hooray I got to get 
 That yayo off 
 That's blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the 
 Ave, I put the glock in the stash, slabs and copped in the trash 
 Still stop and I laugh, ma put 
 Them rock in your ass, the rest twat in ya bag, dag, hop in a cab 
 Play you for what 
 You gon' play yourself 
 Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself 
 And my weight of the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday dog 
 Don't play with your health. 
 Mami... she open she open, jump off... hopin' I'm hopin', grab her... rope em' and dope em', 
 Oral... choke em' and choke em' 
 I flip bundle to bundle, tryin' to double my double, at the same time... for what... but 
 The cops say I'm 
 I get fresh from 
 Yankee stadium to the garden I beg your pardon 
 Stop it, my closet, macy's mens department 
 Pants, shirt, scarf, phone if you check it 
 Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section 
 Fur for fur baby, baby you'll go stir crazy 
 Got that david yurmen burnin', the bird gazey 
 You'll get hurt play me 
 Burp let the dirt chase me 
 Every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately I know 
 Some rn's that still strip, when I and this real dick, in 
 The clinic, no student can heal shit 
 Better than college, after that, students home 
 At least after your bid, ain't no student loans 
 To pay back, jack, ask 
 What do you condone 
 Hit towns wit coke, a .45 blue as chrome 
 Now they done juiced marone?? 
 Knock, knock are you at home 
 I'm a call he, girls call the crib 
 And ask are you alone 
 ...Killa 
 We race foreign cars, customed models, drop top mustard tahoe 
 We like the musketeers, trained by 'cause d'amato 
 Just a model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow 
 Watch sanford in son 
 I'm like the buzz in rolo 
 Afourtuniado, the porsche apollo, wars a follow 
 Got the mack jack, still swing swords like zorro 
 We jackin' and clappin' y'all just applaud like bravo 
 Now I plaud the cappo, zeke and santana 
 I don't razor wrist's 
 I keep eighths of piff 
 The games and the chick 
 Like kobe imma rape the bitch 
 Razor grips, laser spit, glock cocked j or fifth 
 D on the block just like jadakiss 
 Haters shift, plead the fifth, spray 
 The fifth, gator kicks, ma-tr-ix, major chips, I'm your favorite... killa 
 Dipset, dipset
