Been had to get forget, lived in the sickest pad 
 Slept with mice and roaches, woke up pissed up slab 
 School of the hard knocks, I on the vicious ave 
 Jim chase Mark Chan, we beat a bitches ass 
 Ask me who you loving, Cam, you been bugging 
 Must have lost your mind, you fought Lucien's cousin 
 And St. Mark's, yeah, big LE watch 
 My nigga red squashed it, forget that topic 
 40th, down the block danger zone 
 Up the ave forty wall, hope y'all niggas bring you chrome 
 What you saying homes? Cops, they raiding homes 
 Activator juice, yes, to spray your dome 
 From a tiny dude, developed grimey dude 
 Stuck delivery, took all his Chinese food 
 I'm so good but bad, I'm so kind but rude 
 Americas most wanted, should have signed a Q 
 Plus its savage, cop car crash your door 
 Further more heard the boy 'em at the sack amore 
 Boy yes, overseas, more sex 
 4 jets, corvettes and I ain't done a tour yet 
 'Cause I'm moving bricks, yes, they serve in fours 
 Signing off dipset boss, truly yours 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all 
 We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it 
 We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all 
 We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it 
 We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it 
 My cerebral stress, eagle let it rest 
 Feel it in the air, yeah, Siegel said it best 
 It's a legal mess, needles need to death 
 Blame the government until then I need to chef 
 Turn right, lead left, street games scrams 
 Call the cops, oc, like we need a ref 
 You can't cheat a chef, I can see your chest 
 No heart, cherish your oxygen, breath your breaths 
 He need a rest, how he gon' be the best? 
 Like I guess a couple slugs he need to catch 
 See the sketch, you lassie 
 The gun is Frisbee proceed to fetch 
 Side up the hoopty, spray up the Sentra 
 Be sixty years before I'm laid up in benter 
 Sprayed up her denture, your girl 
 Then I laid her placenta, blew hazed in her rental 
 Some days in December, some days I remember 
 A boy, Sugar Ray wanna play the contender 
 Just say I got a temper 
 And my temperature is off the thermometer 
 Korean New Year to Hanukah, I'm bombing ya 
 Put you to sleep for good pajama, ya 
 Wrangle you in ya He-Man pajamas 
 Wrap you up in your Pac Man sheets 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all 
 We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it 
 We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all 
 We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all
