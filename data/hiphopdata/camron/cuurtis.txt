The truck or the Lamby 
 Cam be stuffed in some candy 
 This ain't a label Curtis, I'm freaking with family 
 See my squad done waited right behind them bars that's gated 
 Hopped out the casket bastard, reincarnated 
 Yep, so have a seat, this gon' be a masterpiece 
 I have to beef, he look like a gorilla, with rabbit teeth 
 Bugs Monkey, act hard wit' a crack god that mack broads 
 That video ain't Queens, it's your backyard 
 Cuurtis, what's messing wit' ya head bad 
 Ya dead mad, but dag that, security with red flags 
 You bangin' 5, shootin' rocks and signs my way 
 Fine play, I keep it nuetral, but my family's 9-Trey 
 So-Woo, my A.R. lights that stay to fight from day to night 
 When I smack the Lightey brothers, Dave and Mike 
 Huh, believe me hoe, you can't G me though 
 Jimmy ain't the president, he the CEO 
 Zeke is the president, it's evident, he'll cock and spray 
 Santana underboss, I sign off like Dr. Dre 
 I fuck with Zo Pound too, waddup, Sa Pa Se 
 Grab the cocoa macok, tessozo, rock away 
 I extended the clip, never be friends with you pricks 
 Shout to a real Queens dude, ya know, Kenneth McGriff 
 He ran from police, you run with police 
 You ain't from Southside 
 You 'bout to get your mouth wide 
 Cuurtis, uh, rewind it DJ 
 Cuurtis, you ain't 50, 50 Cent's from BK 
 Cuurtis, yep, he deserve to be nervous 
 Cuurtis, damn, show some courtesy Curtis 
 Ay yo, check the tale, girls break they neck and nails 
 Just for me to sex they tail, but let's talk record sales 
 Juelz, 800, Jim, 400 
 I cop more cribs, more cars, got more blunted 
 Yeah I rocked the Roc so stop it doc, you copper top 
 My niggaz, watch 'em ball, your dudes, I watch 'em flop 
 Yep, so beware, dog I'm tryna be clear 
 Banks bricked, Mobb bricked, Buck ain't been out for three years 
 Lemme be fair, I hop up off a sweet Lear 
 Right to Lennox, ain't no sand, but I'm on my beach chair 
 Visa knottail, and dog we not frail 
 You don'r club in New York, you party out in Scotsdale 
 I can't be clowned, beef dog, how dare we now 
 And how you livin', you live in Tyson's hand-me-down 
 Plus you can't be found, I'll have you taped, gagged, and bound 
 Ask around, I never liked the circus, so I clap a clown 
 Ay yo man, thanks for all the shout-outs 
 For my dudes who keep shoutin', I love it baby 
 They're my brothers 
 I ain't hear you say Banks name in a minute 
 Talkin' 'bout Koch a graveyard, you just signed off for Prodigy to go there 
 Ay yo P, he a sucker, get away from that dude B 
 You ain't got no swag with buck teeth 
 You know how ya ain't got no swag 
 Whoever let you sign off on them G-Unit tanktops 
 Is stupid just like yo' dumb ass 
 Them is brazier tops 
 Whoever wore that outside was a homo, gay ass nigga 
 Ay yo stop calling my probation officer too 
 Why you talkin' 'bout my probation 
 You tryna get me locked up Curtis 
 Ay yo Curtis you really tryna get me locked up 
 You said something about my probation on your song 
 Next thing you know my probation officer called me today, said they need to see me 
 Ay yo if I go to jail, Curtis put me in jail 
 It's crazy, how I gotta report to probation next Thursday 
 I ain't supposed to report for three weeks 
 I gotta go Thursday and he mentioned my probation 
 Ay yo, lemme get off this mic now 'cause I know how you get down 
 Rat ass nigga, that's true story, that's not even a joke, I'm dead serious
