(Kelly Price) 
 Hmmm, hmmm 
 Oh, on and on and on 
 (Cam' Ron) 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, 
 Yo, why stay here when all y'all don't play fair 
 Wanna disrespect slit cha neck, spit the tech (Oh) 
 Yellin' out baby hit da deck and all the people 
 See my face on all y'all TV's 
 Laid out like Castellano on a war with Thoebe (Oh) 
 To my family y'all all the greedy 
 Yeah my mother, I can't judge her 
 I love her, but trust her, she a sucka (Oh) 
 Went D-Rugs when I turned around 
 Ready to lock her in the liquor store and burn it down 
 Or at least give her a tumor to kill the rumors (Yeah) 
 How she a coke consumer, and my girl too slick 
 Acting goody two shoes like she don't do spit (Oh) 
 I knew it, no bluffin, no fussin or nothin' 
 After all, I'm the one that was up in her cousin (Hmmm) 
 But she got a girl in her world 
 F a boyfriend, I don't know if I'm mad or if I should join in 
 Like the movie flicks (Oh) 
 And all my trickers wit hoochie slit (Oh) 
 I tell 'em you be quick 
 My grandmother need her rubies fixed 
 And some Gucci chips 
 She think I'm paid 'cause she heard me with the Fugee clique (Oh) 
 All the money she want 
 I tell her sue me quick 
 Why don't you shoot me quick 
 Do it tasteful and gratefully, hateful 
 My grateful behalf (Hmmm) 
 Now my girl is crying pregnant 
 Look it and laugh (Oh) 
 No, and I ain't seen 'em last in a year and a half 
 But they hand open 
 Prepared for the cash (Yeah) 
 Ch'all don't offend me, my ends be 
 Buried out in the Indies, too bad I'm stingy (On and on) 
 (Throughout chorus) 
 On and on away we'll fall (On) 
 Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (Sometimes, yeah) 
 On and on the pained ones say (On and on, oh) 
 How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are so fragile) 
 (Cam' Ron) 
 Yo 
 Yo, yo (Yeah) 
 Yo, you got a best friend, me too, mine's in heaven 
 My man Blood Deedee left in '97 (Oh) 
 C'mon how that sound, yo 
 Put my man in the ground, yo 
 'Cause he let a girl be his downfall 
 We would slide together 
 In a ride together (Oh) 
 What you know about Blood, even my endeavors 
 How we cried together, vowed to lie together 
 I wish I was in the whip, we could of died together (Oh) 
 Like the charm, love is gone, I ain't bleedin 
 But I got blood on my arm 
 'Cause what happen when you die 
 You miss one or two treats 
 One or two weeks 
 One or two beeps 
 One or two peeps (Oh) 
 Cats like you 
 Miss one or two freaks 
 Them hoes gon' cry 
 For one or two weeks (Yeah) 
 My life is like a car race 
 No brakes, just gas 
 Goin' real fast 
 Probably land in a crash (Oh) 
 Like my cousin, perhaps, for a dozen and black 
 Harlem buzzin the fact, prayin' I wasn't the cat (Yeah) 
 But haters lovin' the fact, can't stay on my toes 
 And I be layin in low, y'all be blazin' my hoes (Oh) 
 Yeah, I sound wet 
 But lounge yet 
 Playa lay it down bet 
 Y'all be tryin' to J and I ain't even in the ground yet (Hmmm) 
 And from the first I put my heart in it 
 I love you Blood Deedee (I love you) 
 I'll see you in a minute (Oh) 
 (Throughout chorus) 
 On and on away we'll fall (Sometimes some fall) 
 Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (And the paain) 
 On and on the pained ones say (Sometimes it hurts so bad, oh) 
 How fragile we are, how fragile we are (Oh, onnn) 
 On and on away we'll fall (Oh, yeah) 
 Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (From a child, yeah) 
 On and on the pained ones say (On and on, yeah) 
 How fragile we are, how fragile we are (oh yeah) 
 On and on away we'll fall (We go on, on and on) 
 Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (Sometimes we get lonely, 
 Sometimes we get sad, but we go on) 
 On and on the pained ones say (Yeah) 
 How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are so fragile, oh)
