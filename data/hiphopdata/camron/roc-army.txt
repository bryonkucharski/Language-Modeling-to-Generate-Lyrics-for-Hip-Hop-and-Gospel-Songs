 Young Chris be easy, it's ya boy Peedi 
 Roll wit me or ride against me 
 Make it look easy how I empty out in ya Bentley 
 I'm a close range shooter, blow flames out the Ruger 
 Losins for Losers, I got my zoo back from the devil and I could 
 Cut ya face and throw the knife in the swewy 
 The block captain, clappin a gatlin at Sam Bouey
