My nigga g.o.d. (yessur) 
 My nigga leo g (how y'all doin') 
 Let's rock baby 
 Yo, I'm thinkin' 'bout aj 
 Ajinaye, name shoulda been ak 
 Willie hit the eastside, it was mayday 
 Red bentley drop, let's play, play 
 Chuck stone home, my nigga ray, hey 
 Pass the brandy brother, I'm ray j 
 That was deep for y'all, that's just why I sleep on y'all 
 Peep it y'all, you creepin' any coke, give me a call 
 Can't stop the d's, but the d's can't stop the keys 
 Stop the cheese, all these damn shopping sprees 
 Louis this, gucci that, sacks, 5th 
 .9, tech, banana, mac clips 
 Go 'head and act sick, mac spits, backflips 
 That rich, a half a million dollars in the mattress 
 Stickup kids outside, tell 'em "ah it's cool" 
 Thou will never ever ever get my jewels 
 Go 'head and try fool, die fool, I, cruel 
 Mean jet, tough car, bad bitch, fly pool 
 I'm professional, you high school 
 Mini hardware store, 5 tools 
 And they're all hammers, you'll turn pale-blue 
 Not the cops, ock, but I will nail you 
 Fishscale, that's on the scale boo 
 Run a train on your girl, then derail you 
 You, you, this is how you get rich 
 Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich 
 Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich 
 Bitch, bitch, bitch 
 We talkin' codes on the phone, jellocake 
 I see my enemy, well look, hello snake 
 Killa, calm, yeah I'm in a mellow state 
 Anytime, any moment, they'll be yellow tape 
 And y'all hesitaters call on your investigators 
 Legislators, yo you should invest in a respirator 
 Like warren g and nate dogg, I'm a regulator 
 I'm on the top ock, catch the next escalator 
 I want fast head, mami give me slow dome 
 Wish she can hurry up, so she can go home 
 Or go roam, I'm so grown 
 Sun hit the ring, it look like a snowcone 
 And you synthetic, forget it, I'm connected, respected 
 What you expected, yo check it, it's genetic 
 Fuck with me you will regret it, in the ground you'll be embedded 
 Let's bet it, don't wanna bet it, the best bet is to get it, forget it 
 The abominal, phenomenal phenomenon 
 Bomb with' no drama, whole llama blow at abdominals 
 They fallin' like they dominoes, what we got in common though 
 Nuttin' 'cause I'm comma after comma after hoe 
 They bonded though 
 Wonder where I wander though, where I'm a go 
 How I'm a flow, they baffle how I'm on the dough, on the low 
 Babygirl I'm honorroll and right now I'm on a roll 
 Born to roll, pay your toll, hurry up, get on the pole 
 Shake it like a tambourine, peel it like a tangerine 
 Fuck bumpin', liet's get it jumpin', like a trampoline 
 Damn, his tramp is mean, I want head for sure 
 Then I looked down, mami need a pedicure 
 Yeah your feet dun, I told her "please hun" 
 I been gettin' money since each one, teach one 
 And this rap, singer, crack-slinger, mac-blinker 
 Yak-linger, look at the pinky ring on that finger 
 Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich 
 Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich 
 Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich 
 Bitch, bitch, bitch 
 Killa, killa
