Let's do the Eastside one time 
 Metro North, Eastriver, Wilson, Club 99 
 Jefferson, Charleston, A.K., Jackie Rob, Clinton, Taft, Carver 
 Lakeview, 1990, Wagner, Taihino, Harlem 
 I don't care if you a old head, or a young bud 
 I'm not a elevator, I'm no come-up 
 Nor do I go down, do like Brand Nubian, slow down 
 Whole clip, blow pounds 
 Silencers steady, that's no sound 
 Circle ya block ock, merry-go-round 
 Here we go now, I'm the owner 
 You're the pitcher, this block is your mound 
 Buildin' a beast so villians can eat 
 I reside on the west, chilled on the east 
 If I say that I rock, then sayin' is gossip 
 I lived in the Nine, stayed in the projects 
 Scored 35 then I wait for a profit 
 Talk, pull the .9, then I spray up an object 
 Homie, don't confuse me, pardon mine 
 I'm the Harlem World Karlton Hines 
 Get it right nigga 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me 
 Knew that it wasn't, and wasn't the game of degree 
 Rippin', they runnin', the gunnin', they name it from me 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me 
 I don't really buy jewelry, I take 'em 
 I don't listen to artists dog, I break 'em 
 I don't really look at movies, I make 'em 
 I'm filet megnione, you a steak 'em 
 Any beef, I'm a open it probably 
 I got some dudes hopin' ya try me 
 I got hoes, sell coke in the lobby 
 I'm rich bitch, sellin' dope is a hobby 
 Beefin' with Cam be heat did they hand me 
 I be in the Lamby, you with' your family 
 Talkin' gangsta, the church ya visit 
 Your roller bladin', circus, and picnics 
 The underworld, the circuit I live in 
 You keep your biscuit, we'll work her with chickens 
 That's the rules that were laid to me 
 Why you think they call me KFC 
 You don't know me homie 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me 
 Knew that it wasn't, and wasn't the game of degree 
 Rippin', they runnin', the gunnin', they name it from me 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me 
 '91 to '96, yeah Harlem was out 
 Grant's tomb brought out of Laguardia house 
 Huh, stand in the lobby, Cam and his posse 
 Steak and cheese sandwich from Heaugies 
 They come to heroin, the biggest of Dons 
 Since Guy and Nicky, Fisher and Barnes 
 Snitched, triggers and bombs hit the alarm 
 I would kick in the door, click on ya moms 
 I fell to the arms, in jail we roasted 
 The bail was there, bail got posted 
 Like, in Boston at 1 point boo 
 The bail it was 1 point 2 
 Get the money nigga 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me 
 Knew that it wasn't, and wasn't the game of degree 
 Rippin', they runnin', the gunnin', they name it from me 
 A child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me 
 I'm livin' in scripture, the picture they painted for me
