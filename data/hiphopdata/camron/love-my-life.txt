Ayo, I never claimed to be hard, tough, no homo, gangsta none of the above 
 Just a kid from 145th and Lennox Ave 
 Harlem, USA trying to make his way in the world ya heard? 
 Ya know through the trial of tribulations that life brings 
 I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever 
 Ya know you cant expect everything from everybody 
 So get up get out and get somethin, thats what I did 
 Before I had the hammer cocked 
 A Santana rock 
 Little Gerv, Grandpa Jerry, Grandma Doc (thats my fam) 
 Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill, 
 Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill now 
 My Aunt Normy, I dont speak to my Aunt Deita 
 Or my Cousin Bashiba, love my Mother Fredricka 
 Neighbour Freida, daughter Raven and Nika 
 Down another doorbell was that nigga Warden Nell 
 He gave birth to the best emcee you never heard 
 Lever after lever and was clever with whatever word 
 Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C 
 He did damage, road managed my G.O.D 
 Aka Duke Da God, he was stupid hard 
 16, the bitch dream had stupid cars 
 Cut the ' 68, hooptie ' 75 
 Still drives some bullshit, I dont know why 
 I loved the nigga though, for him put cris in the air 
 First one that diss him in here, I swear I'll risk my career 
 Thats a fact they aint talking no rap shit 
 I'm talking that mack clip, niggas will backflip, act sick 
 My dude study the sabbath 
 No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish 
 He could have my house, he could keep my mauries 
 He could drive my cars, this a eastside story 
 (Thats why my dudes love me I let them do them. 
 You either gonna be rich or famous fuckin wit me, probably both. 
 If you happen to brush shoulders wit me by accident, 
 play lotto, nine out of ten times you gonna win nigga.) 
 (Chorus - Nicole Wray (x2)) 
 To play the game, sure to win 
 ?? 
 I sacrificed, I rolled the dice 
 I love the hood, I love my life 
 (Verse 2 - Cam'Ron) 
 See a boss I prepared to be 
 When I walk away from a confrontation I aint scared of you I'm scared of me 
 I got a gun, you dont so it flares you'll see 
 After that a 5,000 volt chair for me 
 So I move carefully, niggas dont care for me 
 Who care I dont, you share I wont 
 Calm down (uhuh) breathe again 
 I dont do extortion unless I wanna recieve an end 
 Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak (what she say) 
 Thats word to me, told me I deserve to eat (what happened) 
 Moved to a killa ave, right from a murder street (what you did) 
 Rocked adida forms even though they hurt my feet (thats fucked up) 
 I dont look in the sky, never mind stars 
 You also find stars, right behind bars 
 Snazz, Black, Do' on house arrest 
 Zeke, shiek, wont even throw out the rest 
 They wanted my ass right alongside zeke 
 Turn myself in, nope play hide and go seek 
 I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome 
 Yeah i'm just like a fly, see the shit that i'm on 
 And, hour after hour I would chill at the afterhours 
 Where they flash the power, no bath or shower 
 In that same spot, realize math is power 
 So I pointed the mansion, that is ours 
 (Chorus - Nicole Wray (x2))
