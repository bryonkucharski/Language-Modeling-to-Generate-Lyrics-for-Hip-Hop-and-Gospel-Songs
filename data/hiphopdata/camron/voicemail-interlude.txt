 Yo Cam, it's Juelz 
 Listen, man, where you at? 
 I gotta call you six times 
 And the voicemail still on 
 So, I gotta leave this message 
 Listen, I gotta talk about your shit 
 "Killa Season" in the streets 
 Just talk about this shit 
 It's more important about this 
 I know, it's fucked this shit 
 Gotta prepare 18 tracks to this shit 
 And, you know, it's fucked 
 You know, bitch, I gotta talk with you 
 Can you taking a concert to this shit? 
 I hope not, this shit is really fucked 
 Like you kill your fuckin' ass 
 Don't rap drugs, violence and sex 
 It's going to smoking marijuana and alcohol 
 Don't take your ass at all America 
 Stay at your motherfuckin' studio 
 About your fuckin' shits at music stores 
 It's terrible, don't do it 
 You heard me, bitch
