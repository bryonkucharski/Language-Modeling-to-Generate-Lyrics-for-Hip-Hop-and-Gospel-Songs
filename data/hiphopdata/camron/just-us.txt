Uh, yo 
 Her shoes straight was hooker 
 Don't play, I cook it, what's shakin' sugar 
 I'm gettin' cake, fetti, cheddy, makin' mucke 
 She said she hate a pusher, I said I hate a booger 
 A snotty attitude, she laughed, I purple haze and kushed her 
 My charm captured her, she havin' man trouble 
 I'm havin' woman problems, it all began in Harlem 
 Wife with the Lou' Vuitton said I'm livin' wrong and I did her wrong 
 Forget the song, I swear I love her to death but we can't get along 
 Her problems big as hell, her dad died man, beat her friend crossed up 
 Ma Breast cancer got laid off and plus her son got sickle cell 
 Damn mami, hit the L, Misses Bell got shit to tell 
 Sounds horrific, ain't a doctor, but your son I wish him well 
 Under this damn pressure 
 She looked at me, I looked at her and then Cam measured 
 Started to Sanchez her 
 Tell you some dudes might fight some 
 Gunplay, day time and the night come 
 But I'm from Harlem, want a problem yeah you're dealin' wit' the right one 
 The right one, a female, I like one, a straight girl 
 A dike one, either way, come on girl, it's just us (it's just us) 
 It's just us (it's just us) 
 I'm so tough, out the cuffs 
 Diamonds crushed, we so plush 
 It's just us (it's just us) 
 It's just us (it's just us) 
 It's just us (it's just us) 
 It's just us (it's just us) 
 It's just us 
 Tell you the boy's amazing, I show some poise and patience 
 Lack of communication, well that there destroys a nation 
 I'm God's child right, my dudes employed by Satan 
 And once the grape get dry, hope y'all enjoy the raisin 
 Tanya never checked the check, Kim gettin' high, no self-respect 
 What you expect, MTV, naaa, crack got Direct Effect 
 Plus all the side-effects, they coming fully-loaded 
 And then divide ya death, fuck protect, better hide yo' neck 
 So I play homebase, and I keep a chrome case 
 And a lawyer just incase I catch a case, it's a very long race 
 Moving at the wrong pace, hope you got strong brakes 
 My crew ain't nuttin' but candles, yep we sittin' on cake 
 And all these birds we pitchin', well they're absurd and sickenin' 
 But I seen Brando 143rd and Lenox, dirty kitchens 
 Back of the Burban hun, you heard me hun, she 31 
 Gave her a Sanchez, yes a dirty one
