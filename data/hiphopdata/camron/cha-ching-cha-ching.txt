(Feat. Hell Rell) 
 Cam'ron: 
 Excuse me 
 Do you take a Afro-American card 
 What's that? black card homie 
 Cam'ron: 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cam'ron and Hell Rell: 
 (You got change for a billion) 
 What's that, that's the Lear nigga, leaving outta Tito borough 
 Dipset beats Okero 
 But it's bombs away, do things the monster way 
 We'll take your beauty queen, snatch ya little Jonbenet, 
 For that cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Ransom, Mel Gibson 
 [Yeah, welcome to Hell's kitchen 
 I got one stove, 2 pots, 4 workers, 2 blocks 
 After this I'm buying us all new drops 
 That's right, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Let's go, bling for bling 
 Pay homage to the chain nigga, kiss the ring 
 Damn, we got 'em teary-eyed and heart-broken 
 The Porsche tires burn the rubber, yeah the cars smokin'] 
 Man, lean fast, peel the whip 
 What dealership you dealing with 
 Potangrams, damn, we nothin' you familiar with 
 More killin', killin', what's poppin' 5, the tools out 
 They 550,212, G-mack, pool out 
 Leave 'em layin', stinkin' 
 That's the way I'm thinkin' 
 New York hustlers love me, like I'm David Binkins 
 [That's right cha-ching cha-ching 
 That's my pockets talking 
 Naw, my stomach talking 
 Nigga, we run New York and 
 I'm your favorite boxer, favorites blossom 
 Black Aston Martin, but I made it darker 
 Add on some extra pink, I get extra hate 
 Know how I deal wit' it, I move extra weight 
 Cam'ron: 
 Cha-ching cha ching (We the treasurers) 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching (More cash registers) 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching
