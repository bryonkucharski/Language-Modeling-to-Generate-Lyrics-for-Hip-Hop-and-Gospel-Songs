If only you... could let me in 
 I know that love... it would begin 
 If only I... could rap to you 
 I know this love... would capture you, yeah! 
 Don't you wanna ride? (x4) 
 (Cam'Ron Speaking Over Beat) 
 Killa! Uh! 
 This the ghetto soap opera right here man! You from Harlem you already know. You on that 
 Hustlers mission. You tryin' to get that paper. Wifey like it one minute... next minute she don't 
 Man. You know they at home watching Lifetime on the internet. But you got to do you. I got it, 
 Let me tell you! 
 Yo my mommy Toy 
 Was my pride and joy 
 She would drive the toys 
 Plus ride the boy 
 To supply the boys 
 I got it live from Kroy 
 Yes a 9 in boys 
 Wore a 5 in boys 
 Over the chick shit 
 I shoot 5 wit Roy 
 Now I load the fo' five 
 Shoot 5 at Roy 
 Ain't like my job 
 All guys I employ 
 Lifestyle I enjoy 
 But I'm the livest Doy (echo doy) 
 A Hustler and Cam famous? 
 You damn anus 
 I dunno but I can't change it 
 Can't paint it 
 Pop it, champagne it 
 Stop it, car drop it, it look dull 
 Damn paint it 
 She would throw a pout 
 How I'm showin' out 
 How I'm out goin' 
 But don't be goin' out 
 It's things to know about 
 When you got dough and clout 
 Ways to move, know the route 
 Baby girl, close your mouth 
 'Cause I feed you well 
 Every sneaker, hell 
 You eat Louie, shit Gucci, breathe Chinelle 
 Car laga fell 
 Acting like Gargamel 
 For the car cop the cell 
 And the bar stop at hell 
 'Wrong wit chu? 
 She said what's wrong with chu? 
 Always got a song to do 
 Can't get along its true 
 So I skipped marriage 
 Bought her six carrats 
 Rather die that nigga 
 Than to live average 
 If only you... could let me in 
 I know that love... it would begin 
 If only I... could rap to you 
 I know this love... would capture you, yeah! 
 Don't you wann ride? (x4) 
 (Cam'Ron) 
 Oh it ain't over part 2! Uh! Ghetto soap opera let's do it! 
 Yo! Yo! Uh! 
 Lookin' back on school 
 Arts and crafts 
 Fuck half the staff 
 Beat up half the class 
 I was like Dr. Dre though 
 I have to laugh 
 Nigga wit an attitude 
 Meet me after math 
 Had her half and half 
 Not a drink 
 2 chicks def lit acid fast 
 To half a tab 
 You could ask her ass 
 I would dash and laugh 
 You after me? 
 Huh, I'm after cash 
 I'm on I-80 
 Though with my baby 
 Whole ride hazy 
 Tell her don't drive crazy 
 I got plans for you 
 Look in the sky baby 
 Fuck Sara Lee, Misses Smith 
 You the pie lady 
 Fly lady G2 
 Fly baby gee you 
 Wild baby 
 Please boo what's your size crazy? 
 Don Wonin' 
 When I'm in the foreign 
 Almond drop top 
 My charm is alarmin' 
 I was alertin' her 
 Just to re-insert in her 
 That I would leave Earth wit her 
 Huh, I can't interpret her 
 She got mad I leaned over 
 I'm mercin' her 
 Said when I do dirt wit her 
 The only time I flirt with her 
 Not to be V.I. 
 But this is B.I. Bia 
 Me and G.I. 
 Be watched by the P.I.'s 
 See why we can't finish together 
 I'd rather do business than pleasure and that's real! 
 If only you... could let me in 
 I know that love... it would begin 
 If only I... could rap to you 
 I know this love... would capture you, yeah! 
 Don't you wanna ride (to fade out)
