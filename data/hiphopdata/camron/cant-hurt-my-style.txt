Y'all little dudes couldn't hurt my style 
 And you got birds, it'll make it worth my while 
 And I mean-mug 'cause you don't deserve my smile so 
 Been into plenty drama 
 Flame it like Benihana's 
 Y'all little dudes couldn't hurt my style 
 And you got birds, it'll make it worth my while 
 And I mean-mug 'cause you don't deserve my smile so 
 Been into plenty drama 
 Flame it like Benihana's 
 I got the stainless, the stainless know how to work the fire 
 I'll leave you brainless then famous, more murder murder guys 
 My chain, my ring, my chain, my watch, it might hurt ya eyes 
 Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop, baby come work them thighs 
 I know that coke the iaina, ya know, birds or pies 
 Bad work, a bloodbath, niggaz deserve to die 
 Look dude, I'm the Dean, don't mean to hurt ya pride 
 You the wanksta, I'm gangsta, certified 
 Get with me, physically I'll take you out your misery 
 My bracelet is Time Square, necklace a Christmas tree 
 The piece you see across the entire state children 
 The night version of the Empire State Building 
 Let's dead the convo, pronto, go condo for condo 
 Better yet shot for shot, John Doe for John Doe 
 Y mano y mano, I'm Don Juan Demarco 
 With the magic wand, beyond, tell 'em get and begone you 
 Y'all little dudes couldn't hurt my style 
 And you got birds, it'll make it worth my while 
 And I mean-mug 'cause you don't deserve my smile so

 We pimps and mobsters, with a different posture 
 Dipped in Prada, pasta on the shrimp and lobster 
 A side of oysters, plus the scamp we fried 
 I don't understand it 5, the way he move he can't be live 
 We still family ties, get ya family tied 
 Uh, duct-tape, wrong move, ya family dies 
 Couple hit the kid, couple shots graze the trunk 
 Middle finger, pay the punk, know who I was raised amongst 
 The neck tennis yellow, the wrist tennis blue 
 I'm at the tennis match, L.V. on the tennis shoes 
 Soon as the tension fuse, we begin to feud 
 I'm 80 percent of the reason the tenants move 
 So tell your employer, better yet, tell your lawyer 
 You wanna see the boy, a 100 million, Dela Hoya 
 Dude brought your girl to the crib and said "Enjoy her" 
 I got it cookin' on the stove, you can smell the Goya 
 Y'all little dudes couldn't hurt my style 
 And you got birds, it'll make it worth my while 
 And I mean-mug 'cause you don't deserve my smile so 
 Been into plenty drama
