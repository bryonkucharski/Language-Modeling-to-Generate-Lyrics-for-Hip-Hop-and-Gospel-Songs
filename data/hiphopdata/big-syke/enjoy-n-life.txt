(Syke talking) 
 (Waking up) 
 Another day, another day... 
 Let me get up and do something 
 Rolled out the bed about eleven past nine 
 It's about that time for me to incline 
 Hit the shower took about a half an hour 
 For me to throw on my clothes I suppose 
 Slappin' on my khakis and t-shirt not the linen 
 Low profile cause my Dayton wasn't spinnin' even grinnin' 
 Callin' dollars on my mobile phone 
 Cause last night he stumbled home, but not alone 
 Got baked and toasted overdosed on Re-my 
 Vision me, in the land of no pity 
 Doin' a hundred through the city swervin' 
 Baby grabbin' on my thang in the suburban 
 Turnin', agony and stress into careless therapy 
 It's true overdue for the century 
 Could it be no more strugglin', smugglin', sellin' crack 
 Day dreaming kicking back 
 Doubt that's really gonna last 
 Put some in the stash, let time pass, enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 Enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 Nothing else I can do, but enjoy life 
 (Ooh) 
 Livin' the life of a boss player 
 (Ooh) 
 Scooped the little homie, snowmobiling, jetskiing 
 Offroad vehicles dependin' on the season 
 Needin' something exotic and sexy 
 Two piece bikini come undress me 
 Nasty as you wanna be, sucka free 
 Let it hang loose when you hangin' wid me 
 Unsolved mysteries on ya body let me find 'em 
 Fantasy desires don't hide 'em, just come 
 Let it throb did I get the job done 
 Doin' it standin' up 
 Are you having fun?, don't run 
 Stop, get on top, it's wet, drippin' sweat 
 And I ain't even hit it yet 
 No regrets on your mind quali-time 
 Wid a floss, from a playa boss 
 The cost is a question-ing not asked 
 Just lettin' time pass enjoyin' life... 
 Ha ha enjoyin' life 
 (Hook: only women sing) 
 Can't fall off I gotta ball till the end playa 
 Fat crib in the loft at the thug lair 
 Can't let go, I know they want me livin' low 
 Ambition competition got me federal been poled 
 Open doors to a money journey 
 Conception transgression won't turn me 
 Mentally composed so I rose to the occasion 
 A celebration, everyday vacation 
 Optimism I put in 'em 
 Give 'em to the kids, love being wid 'em 
 Livin' what I did in the past is in the past, if you ask 
 Listen my intuition say I'm moving fast 
 On the gas, of a big, bike sled 
 All my people say I'm living, past fed 
 Enemies want me dead 
 Females calling 
 Gotta keep ballin' 
 Enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 What else can I do, but enjoy life 
 (Ooh) 
 Forever ballin', ha hah 
 (Ooh) 
 Enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 Livin' the life of a boss playa 
 Enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 You know, enjoyin' life 
 (Ooh) 
 Sucka, and busta free
