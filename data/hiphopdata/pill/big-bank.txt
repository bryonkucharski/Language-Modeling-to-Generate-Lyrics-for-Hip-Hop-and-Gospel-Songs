Big bank take little bank, 
 Drop a in the fish tank 
 Got the sharks on lean 
 Fish scale for my whole team 
 Big bank take little bank 
 Drop a in the fish tank 
 Got the sharks on lean 
 Fish scale for my whole team 
 Watch that gonna pull up watch the pogo 
 Cake my birthday blow them 
 Candles baby please don't blow my 
 It's a band aid on your forehead I got people on my 
 On my pockets said release me to the sky 
 This is big bank talk make frequent as it is 
 Swear that money like the chili double hot 
 Dog tater chip bag 
 No sir, no shoes, no swag, 
 I'll get cash, put that title by my name 
 Hottest lighters I'ma fire plus they gotta aim 
 I just left the title game 
 Don't they drove it trying to block me 
 I'm surrounded by this dollars 
 Big bank take little bank 
 Drop a in the fish tank 
 Got the sharks on lean 
 Fish scale for my whole team 
 I say at the Benjamins, pretty swimming in 
 And they ain't talking money 
 It's just my women friend 
 Pull up in the so sexy when the engine rim 
 It goes wrum, wrum, screw that, 
 Cost like 7 birds 
 Cruise me down my swimming in that money 
 She say she don't like them bros 
 She in love with money
