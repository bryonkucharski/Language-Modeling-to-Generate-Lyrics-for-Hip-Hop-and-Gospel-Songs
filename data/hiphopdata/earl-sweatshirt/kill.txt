Aw, nigga thought he killed me? 
 Alright, that's cool, we'll see 
 Strict top of the crop shit 
 Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit 
 Dollar cents since shit, sense I ain't lost it 
 It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit 
 Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness 
 Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick 
 Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch 
 Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses 
 Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist 
 Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic 
 Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it 
 Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, off 'em! 
 Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch 
 Box logo, switchblade and cocaine 
 In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation 
 The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick 
 Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes 
 The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with 
 Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it 
 Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit 
 Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face 
 With erasers and use Based God as his replacement 
 Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings 
 Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin' 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all 
 Just watch, off 'em! 
 Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's 
 Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager 
 And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina 
 And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up 
 Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough 
 And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us 
 Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up 
 At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers 
 Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts 
 Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick
