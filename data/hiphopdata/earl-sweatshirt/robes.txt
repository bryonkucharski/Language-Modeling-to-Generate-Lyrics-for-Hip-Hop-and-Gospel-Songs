They often see what we can't see 
 Wearing a smile 
 You never ever find a frown 
 You ain't shit if you ain't ever struggled 
 You gotta put in hard work before you flex your muscles 
 I see where niggas fall off tryna perfect the puzzle 
 You ain't gotta like my work shit, respect my hustle 
 I was a solid hearted mind before I had to grind, my swagger fine 
 I never had to pack my lines with plastic rhymes 
 Diamond in the rough, give it time, you'll find your light and shine 
 This little light of mine, these are our highest times 
 My third eye divine, I see my skies aligned 
 I feel like one with the moon but that's some other shit 
 I stopped caring how people see me and I'm loving it 
 But no desire for your input, I does my shit 
 Say what you want but know my ignorance is fucking bliss 
 They often see what we can't see 
 Wearing a smile 
 You never ever find a frown 
 Pardon the scents 
 Checking press releases off the beeper like a pimp 
 Smanging Lever off the strength, threw his demons off the cliff 
 The scenic route below, tires screaming in the mist 
 And like the key open the door I twist 
 The weed I bought because I don't know how to cope with shit 
 Be easy I could three hit 'em right where his shoulder sit 
 Maneuver throught the swamp like a four-wheeler 
 Hitting it quickly after a coarse greeting 
 Leave like the father I never had or a low Caesar 
 The son he had but ain't never wanted like cold pizza 
 Skull and bones out the same closet I grow reefer 
 The team eatin', cold-hearted, spit feces 
 They often see what we can't see 
 Wearing a smile 
 You never ever find a frown 
 Fuck every rapper and his entourage 
 Fuck up the stage and blow dodi smoke on his bodyguards 
 Nothin' but Cutlasses, Cadillac coupes in my garage 
 Make foreign bread, get some morning head on the Autobahn 
 Faces, smiling faces, they keep me motivated 
 And I got plenty fans but I ain't shit without my haters 
 Know this pussy A&R that threw some bullshit cross the table 
 Then next year I still be rappin' and he be fired from his label 
 Damn, bitch, I'm in the mob, I always got a job 
 Breakin' down the Keisha gettin' Brandon Marshall for the quad 
 Brett Favre for the zone, five bags for the whole 
 Wrist piece solid gold, neck piece arctic froze 
 Give you the smarts and the parts and also regarding hoes 
 He chase a bitch but I was chose 
 I only think of you, on two occasions 
 That's when I'm drunk and when I'm blazin' up 
 My Filipino bitch she fly me to LA to fuck 
 I weigh my options, I'd rather be cookin' cuttin' and weighin' up 
 Bitch, it's Gibbs! 
 They often see what we can't see 
 Wearing a smile 
 You never ever find a frown
