It's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves 
 Skate Mental, truck smack a faggot in his Shirley Temple 
 Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners 
 At the end of the bar, I spit with the permanents 
 Learn I'm a curb stomping person 
 Like third strike verdict dropping jaw dropping verses 
 This bigger lips in person, nigga spits some burn so earn the shit 
 Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick 
 The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass 
 I control them like your eyes when I'm tinking a glass 
 So if you thinking about this then stop thinking it fast 
 Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, ho 
 The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass 
 I control them like your eyes when I'm tinking a glass 
 So if you thinking about this then stop thinking it fast 
 Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch 
 Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine 
 Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains 
 Wait, where you going, what you doing tonight? 
 Just want to know what you doing, come back 
 Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine 
 Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains 
 Where you going, what you doing tonight? 
 Stop running, where you going, what you doing? 
 It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift, rapist in training 
 Who edge about as straight as some clay closet gay dick 
 Ray say hey Earl's a real charming racist 
 Your birthday day, have some KK cake bitch 
 Habit have it, grab it fast and attack it, faggot 
 I'm above average like I'm rapping in the attic, yeah 
 I'm crouched in the basement shouting "Couch" is the greatest hit 
 Dirty as a anus is, fans stand in rain for this 
 They even stand in sleet season until they fucking feet bleeding 
 Hail and fucking snow, in hell with fucking coats 
 Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt 
 He make them bow down until they mothafucking necks hurt 
 Fans probably stand in sleet season until they fucking feet bleeding 
 Hail and fucking snow, in hell with fucking coats 
 Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt 
 He make them bow down 'til they mothafucking necks hurt 
 Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine 
 Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains 
 Wait, where you going, what you doing tonight? 
 Just want to know what you doing, come back (Please) 
 Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine 
 Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains 
 Where you going, what you doing tonight? 
 Stop running, where you going, what you doing? 
 Mr. Deerskin Moccasins is on the fucking stalk again 
 Following and stalking all them larchmont soccer chicks 
 Chopping limbs, gnawing legs, through they fuckin' stockings 
 Him his grandfather sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans 
 Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us 
 So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard 
 So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin' fuck you, son 
 Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin' 'til the moon come 
 Woo son, the moonshine got me feelin' loose 
 As the puss of a whore who's used to abuse 
 My screw's pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos 
 Of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you 
 You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through 
 My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of yoo-hoo 
 Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All fuck 'em all 
 No lube, it's the crew to get use to, faggot
