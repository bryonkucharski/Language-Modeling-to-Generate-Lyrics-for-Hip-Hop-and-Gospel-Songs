Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal 
 Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle 
 Hang or bang hocking loogies in a bible 
 Dancing with the Devil tonight's our first recital 
 His hands on my hips he take control of my movement 
 A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doing 
 Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me 
 But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me 
 Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? 
 You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? 
 Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? 
 You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? 
 I live all over my roomie's a bum 
 Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun 
 Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum 
 My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums 
 She asking me to dance I ask for my pants 
 Ended up with an argument sirens, ambulance 
 Scratch her off my list, the situation bias 
 She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it 
 Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick 
 Besides from the smell of it I'm hating the flavor 
 Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor 
 Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber 
 (Ah, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior 
 A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up 
 I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet 
 Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet 
 Bitter sweet seven fist fighting with a reverend 
 Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is 
 Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then 
 Place one missed call to heaven 
 You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
