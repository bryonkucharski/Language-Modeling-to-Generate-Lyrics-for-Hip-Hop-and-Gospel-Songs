Fuck yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods 
 "How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho? 
 I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em 
 Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her 
 I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller 
 Strollin easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass 
 Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad 
 And nigga that's a great lunch 
 Poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks 
 Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come 
 Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut 
 Peep the evening news, my nigga, we don't do the same stuff 
 Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases 
 Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one 
 It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck 
 I been like this since the Motorola Razr 
 What a bastard that baby was 
 Little mad nigga missing dad never praying much 
 Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch 
 Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me 
 I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf 
 I'm only happy when there's static in the air 
 'Cause the fair weather fake to me 
 Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets 
 Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy 
 You berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat 
 Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty 
 Hope the sheriff keep away from me
