Watch me get this money nigga, tired of being hungry nigga 
 Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga 
 Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga 
 Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga 
 We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch 
 I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' Ollie switch 
 Buncha novices, odd future the squad, its thick 
 Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense 
 We the last of a dying breed 
 And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs 
 You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please 
 My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees 
 Bitch, twerk as I get on the verse, cursin' 
 Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person 
 Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin' 
 Make actions, fuck rehearsing 
 Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time 
 Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine 
 Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time 
 Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine 
 In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather 
 Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather 
 Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether 
 Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better 
 I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched 
 I was defiant, always said, "fuck shit" 
 Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one 
 Also hated homes too, till I start coppin' me some 
 See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's 
 And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell 
 Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele 
 And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille 
 I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well 
 I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself 
 These fucking rappers got stylists, it's 'cause they can't think for themselves 
 See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but 
 Really, boy posers looking silly boy 
 I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi 
 Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese) 
 Na'kel smith transworld page 64 
 Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames 
 I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game 
 The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name 
 I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes 
 But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists 
 God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished 
 And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens 
 See y'all niggas trippin' man 
 Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong 
 Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs 
 Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me 
 Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat 
 Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind 
 But talk is money, I said, "hi," I guess I bought him some time 
 Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh? 
 They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh? 
 But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan 
 And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements 
 And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing 
 Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings 
 "Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape 
 All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes 
 But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints 
 But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank 
 Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think? 
 My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct 
 Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink 
 Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch 
 Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time 
 Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine 
 Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time 
 Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind 
 You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine 
 This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering 
 So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me 
 But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?) 
 I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me 
 That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff 
 Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot) 
 Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids 
 So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you) 
 Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and 
 All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, I got one!) 
 Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs 
 Bitch gotta (Oh, shut the fuck up!)
