Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse 
 Shorty I'm pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt 
 Tell her to bless the girth if she with it 
 I'm in that kitchen, wrist water whippin' 
 Sike nigga, I don't do that 
 Niggas get bloo-blapped and blown away 
 Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like órale 
 Okay, I'm on to something 
 Momma should've told you it'd be days like this 
 It's just a tale from the crip 
 I'm on my séance shit, I'm tryna' make a million dollars 
 Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit 
 I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip 
 Ramona Park made me from scratch 
 A lot of lotto picks lost inside this game called rap 
 I be the underdog 
 Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm 
 Ain't nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss 
 Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw 
 Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law 
 And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you play me for a pawn 
 Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns 
 Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways 
 Niggas better listen when the pastor say 
 It's Golf on that--bitch, it's Golf on that ball cap 
 I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ain't call back 
 And y'all still debating over Earl music 
 Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy 
 Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street 
 In the different color McGrady's, that first grader was me 
 Now my fist full of spliffs and the old banker receipts 
 Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry 
 I'm taking purses like they chances in the evening 
 Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon 
 On my momma I been limiting my features, filling swishers up with reefer 
 Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick 
 Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive 
 That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy k brought the matches 
 Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag is 
 Switch to different fucking whip to let them piggies speed past 'em 
 It's the rats, try and get the cheese 
 What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat 
 Call me Lou, if I'm on the track, these niggas skip to me 
 Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me 
 50's in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth 
 Vince be with the rocket, he gone pop it when it's danger round 
 Fingertips to tapers, now, salute us when you face us 
 Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now
