Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib 
 Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss 
 Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this 
 Cats always tryna' pick up the fist 
 "Duff this dude out" 
 Rappers stoop just to get to your crib 
 Now it's like who's face? who's warped? too sauced 
 Distort thoughts, on my corpse on the asphalt 
 Back when I'd slack more, rock my slacks or my ass 
 Everytime, I rap I blast-off 
 Back when I catch Cor', I always had Sports 
 Dippin' on cops in my track shorts 
 So tell my mom I had to make it right 
 I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night 
 And tell my Pops' I gotta' take advice 
 Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics 
 See me, I'm the contusion type 
 A cat to smack the mic against my fuckin' head when I'm losing hype 
 Ratking, never losing hype, no 
 It's Ratking and I do it right, no 
 Ratking, yeah, I do it nice, whoa 
 Bitch, I skated before I rapped, if you take me before your captain 
 Bet twenty hots on your Daddy 
 That someone gon' nola clap 'em probably cold and passive 
 'Cause Pops' was the one that got to me 
 Feeling down like he passed it and when I'm cornered, it's action 
 I was kinda' out the game, I'ma put the quarter right back in the slot 
 In 09', we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block 
 Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it 
 And nowadays, I'm on the hunt for mirrors to box with 
 And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run 
 I got the gold 'cause I don't do the crying bro 
 She Mario, I'm tryna' keep the whining to a minimum 
 Piggies come, bet I'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum 
 Find me some Indica, nuggets on my fingers and my shirt like they was chicken crumbs 
 The room spinnin', finna' yak if I don't hit the blunt 
 Got the chin wagon, slim chances of me getting up 
 After this, mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went 
 Dodge fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling six hours or more 
 Brick out on the tour, got kicked out of the morgue 
 Spit cattle manure shit, shit, rally the Horsemen 
 Tally the corpses
