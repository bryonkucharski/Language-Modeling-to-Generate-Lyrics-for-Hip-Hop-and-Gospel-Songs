Foot and hand on the gates 
 We was jumping, oh fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways 
 Was always stuck and I'm stuck until an ambulance came 
 The first time I changed fast through Los Angeles lanes 
 And my bitch say the spliff take the soul from me 
 And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby 
 Beat the fuckin' beat up like it stole from me 
 You can talk to Clancy you need a feature, or quote from me 
 I'm off the lancy, I reek of reefer and show money 
 It's Early running with niggas, who cold running shit 
 The wins like lotion, he get it he go rub 'em in 
 Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him 
 I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother 
 Just grab a glass and pour up some cold white wine 
 And a Colt 45 in it, you know how I get it 
 I'm toasted myself and a toast to all my niggas 
 And there ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell 
 And I gotta jot it quick 'cause I can't focus so well 
 And now, a formal introduction
