Get your lady 
 Cop, piff, inhale and cough 
 Rip the label off this 
 Picked the road that got twists 
 I'm holding my dick and playing cautious 
 I'mma show you how it's done right, nigga 
 Drop this when the sunlight gone 
 Better run right home when the sky turn black 
 Screaming "fuck five-0" 'til my line go flat 
 In that ash-gray beamer we'll be callin that the pigeon coupe 
 Jack knife bitches to the couches in they living rooms 
 Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you 
 Back like how I need to style, I invented you, yup 
 Act like you don't know the name 
 Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky 
 Listening to "Pre", getting dome while I lane switch 
 Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky of a 
 Poster child, you're supposed to hate me 
 Bold and wild, you broke and angry, my nigga 
 Name getting bigger than the difference between us 
 Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em 
 Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt) 
 You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch 
 And if they hate in a passive tense 
 And now they hounding dick 
 And you ain't ask for this 
 Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids 
 Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound a pic 
 'Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick 
 And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick 
 I said sweat (sweat), shirt (shirt) 
 You can tell the Reaper I'mma meet 'em when he send for me 
 With a cleaver and a .30, and some twisted weed 
 I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga 
 Get your lady 
 Cop, piff, inhale and cough 
 Rip the label off this 
 Picked the road that got twists 
 I'm holding my dick and playing cautious 
 You used to say you like violins and your lifestyle depend on me 
 And I know it's night time when you get lonely 
 And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me 
 And despite all of the facts that you phony 
 You gon' tell them about the night that you exposed me 
 For the bastard I was 
 And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club 
 And the last couple months was the worst 
 'Cause I smashed all the trust 
 That I earned in the past couple months 
 That we had as a couple 
 My absence of fucks 
 Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve 
 We just smashed and we scuffled 
 Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you 
 Now you're taking all your property back and it's obvious that 
 That apart from the fact that we fuck and it's bomb 
 And I hate when you home 
 And when I'm gone I don't call 'cause you nag 
 Man, I brought you some shit 
 And I bought you some shit 
 What you offering here? 
 What the fuck you offering here?
