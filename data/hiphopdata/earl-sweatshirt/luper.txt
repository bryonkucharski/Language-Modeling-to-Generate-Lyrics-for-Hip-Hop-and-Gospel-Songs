Ma said "Wake up son, good morning" 
 I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn then 
 Paused to scratch an itch and went, down to the kitchen 
 Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson 
 Just as I was about to dig in 
 A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit 
 I paid my thoughts no attention 
 'Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me 
 But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag 
 And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick 
 It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth 
 She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe 
 She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so 
 When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso 
 Making my eyes ache, stalking her MySpace 
 Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say, that I fucking hate you, but 
 Maybe if you looked in this direction 
 I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then 
 Feel the fucking life, rushing through my body 
 But you got a guy, it's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy 
 Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador 
 You light me up like lamps a chance is all I'm really asking for 
 Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more 
 Most want to tap and score, I want a fam of four 
 Not like a family of four, just like... fuck it 
 You'll never listen to this shit anyways, fuck you, bitch 
 She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador" 
 But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple stores 
 The basement light is darkened and the switchblade is sharpened 
 Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton 
 See her face while you're fixing your breakfast 
 And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with 
 Me murder spree, surges on with the next bitch 
 Tombstones read RIP 'cause it's pieces they rest in
