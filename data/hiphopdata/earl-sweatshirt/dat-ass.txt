Juicebox, tank top, tube socks 
 Dude stop, forehead shiny like a new Glock 
 Two shots fired at the Excursion we were swervin' in 
 All purpose verses with a passion for servin' kids 
 Empty out your purses on an immature crime spree 
 Eyin' up the nurses with some gloves that read I squeeze 
 Who the fuck said to speak, Mr. Me-Is-Siamese? 
 Even Christ said "Christ, he flows quite nicely" 
 Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me 
 And try to high five me, but I just give them high threes 
 Cause y'all don't get two, touch me, I'm the shit 
 Sue me, if you got an issue, grab a tissue 
 Mediocrity is odd to me 
 Ass as far as your eyes can see, who the best? They holla me 
 Nombre, Ho-lay shit, I don't spit crack, I spit cocaine crisp 
 I ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment (Why?) 
 Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent 
 I'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with 
 Dreams what I'm chasin', flow hot it's chafin' 
 This is why I'm hot? No, that is why I'm blazin' 
 Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in 
 But I don't wear jewelery, it's HUF over Louis V 
 Excuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me
