Feel this cage when that acid fade 
 Face the same but your mind has changed 
 You desire a stable home 
 I acquire fame at naming hoes 
 Contemplating ways of getting dome 
 Plotting on my neighbors 
 Asking God for favors 
 Guess he isn't home 
 Probably 'cause that fucking faith I didn't show 
 Skippin church, flip the work 
 Hit the dirt, like Tommy run it bitch 
 Grew up in a home that papa wasn't in 
 Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in 
 Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit 
 And if it wasn't hoes, then it probably was a lick 
 Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin 
 Sweaty D-A dollar top lotto picks 
 Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against 
 Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend 
 Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end 
 Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me 
 Back roll 
 Garbage bag full of xans 
 Teach myself to rap and steal nigga 
 Cash is in hand 
 Packs get vac sealed 
 Like the Tin Man 
 Cardiac Stillness 
 Cardiac still missing 
 Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been 
 Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends 
 Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups 
 Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been 
 Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends 
 Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups 
 My mama wonder why it never seem to reach 
 See my Daddy in the way I'm acting 
 And my facial features 
 Just trying to put you on 
 Dog I came from teachers 
 Take the plate and clean it 
 Nigga I'm a dog 
 Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue 
 Lord I can't fight it 
 Know I'm tryna brawl 
 Get a copper hauled off 
 I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off 
 Popping hoes off 
 Grab the board and these niggas call charge 
 Chain switches jerseys like it's all star 
 Press the OnStar 
 Think it's all lost
