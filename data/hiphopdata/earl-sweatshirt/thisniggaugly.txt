This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died 
 He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento 
 But this faggot just visiting, he's settling in 
 He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do 
 (Does he skate?) Yeah, he skate too 
 (Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh 
 This the newest Wolf Gang member 
 And he... (What's his name?) Earl 
 Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fucking big 
 This nigga, look at this fucking nigga's lips, dog 
 This nigga's lips look like a split sundae 
 Yo, this nigga's line is bended! (That's fucked up) 
 Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet (Earl, say something) 
 Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fucking big ass nooch 
 (Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say something, trust me guys, he can rap) 
 He a bitch! (Just say something 
 Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say something) 
 Nigga, rap, you fucking suck probably 
 (Trust me guys, he can rap, just say something)
