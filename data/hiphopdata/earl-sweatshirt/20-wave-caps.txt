(Verse 1: Domo Genesis) 
 Look for me, lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality 
 High up until the world end, doing eighty-five in my ride 
 And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant 
 I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant 
 Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying 
 Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond 
 I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon 
 The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying 
 Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode 
 Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows 
 My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro 
 Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for" 
 Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know 
 Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho 
 (Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt) 
 Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit 
 I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with 
 New patterns patty-caking with mannequins 
 'Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all 
 Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck 
 And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks 
 Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks 
 I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's 
 Prior to arriving to the studio 
 Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady 
 Where you headed with that shit? 
 And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook 
 Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles 
 Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment 
 Run until my foot achy, running till my foot aching 
 Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag 
 With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-man's 
 Smoking till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan 
 20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams 
 But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass
