Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut crashing while 
 Jacking off to buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce 
 Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws 
 And knock blunt ashes into their caskets and laugh it off 
 Twisted sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off 
 Six different liquors with a Prince wig plastered on 
 Stop screamin', bitch: you shouldn't be that alarmed 
 When Big Lips is in the Attic Arms with an addict's arm 
 Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin" 
 Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic 
 Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat 
 Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish 
 It so happens that I'm so haphazardous 
 I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fuckin' cast the shit 
 I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action 
 And get a hall pass for this class-act shit 
 How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel? 
 Slip capsules in a glass, you dizzy rascal 
 Party staff baffled, askin' where her ass go 
 In my room, redefinin' the meanin' of black holes 
 Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust 
 And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut 
 It's OF buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us 
 Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked 
 Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt 
 Play a song, invade a thong, my dick is havin' guts for lunch 
 As well as supper; then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt 
 Found the mustard, fuckin' nosey neighbors notice somethings up 
 "What you doin'?" Nothin' much, squish out some other stuff 
 Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us 
 Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off 
 DopeBoyz hatin' but them faggots is a lotta talk 
 Cotton soft pussy them Odd niggas is Molotov 
 Cocktails, fuckin' toss one in your apartment dog 
 Wolf Gang we ain't barkin', nah 
 Try talkin' on a blog with your fuckin' arms cut off 
 Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off 
 The Ace tell Shake's daughter "We're sorry, but papa's gone, bitch"
