Yeah I'ma just catch 
 I gotta catch the flow on this 
 I'ma make sure I catch it 
 Git, git, git, git! 
 They want me to catch this shit 
 I'ma catch it right now 
 I'm a monster, I'm a killa 
 Shotty go pop through the villa 
 Bunch of 'nana clips'll kill ya 
 Jump out, the Lord, he gon' feel ya 
 Let ten fly, the Lord, he gon' hear it 
 I be ridin' with no ceilings 
 I'm a monster, I'm a villain 
 Let ten fly, the Lord, he gon' hear it 
 I'm a monster, I'm a killa 
 Shotty go pop through the villa 
 Bunch of 'nana clips'll kill ya 
 Jump out, the Lord, he gon' feel ya
