All of them killers won't make it out 
 Car crash, call it, racin' out 
 All of them killers won't make it out 
 Car crash, call it, racin' out 
 Got a big brick, tryna build a house 
 Tryna run my Mercedes out 
 Big grams in the granny couch 
 All of them killers won't make it out 
 I said all of them killers won't make it out 
 Car crash, call it, racin' out 
 All of them killers won't make it out

 The bullet kiss 'em, call it makin' out 
 They never said I'd appose to nothin' 
 Choppa known for thumpin' 
 Make a nigga start Forrest Gumpin' 
 When I catch that boy forest frontin' 
 Choppa blow his stomach 
 Hit his body and his soul be jumpin' 
 Cause my nigga don't blow for nothin' 
 We gon' run up on you, we gon' get you hit 
 Talk a lot like you servin' brick 
 Tryna get me rich and I fuck your bitch 
 She be suckin' dick on some other shit 
 These niggas, they just tryna hate on me 
 Take me out try to put date on me 
 Gotta ride 'round with that thang on me 
 Catch a nine slippin' by 43, word to me 
 I'ma just keep goin' hard 'til it's dirt on me 
 L Block 390, you heard of me? 
 Chopper rips open like surgery 
 I'm back from the dead, close the curtian, B 
 All my killers gon' get away 
 Savage come through, he gon' get away 
 Mikey come through, he gon' rip it fast 
 Everybody gon' rip his face 
 And I'ma kill 'em 
 They look Scottie Pippen, woo! 
 You hear that 'Gatti engine, woo! 
 You heard I'm karate flippin', woo! 
 Now haters, they ought to mention 
 Come through the Garvey hittin' 
 I got guns and they're shootin' they Tony flippin' 
 Codeine, you know I'm sippin' 
 Young niggas on a mission!
