(Young Chris) 
 A memory attached, rest in peace Auntie 
 Rest in peace to you faggots that ain't standing behind me 
 Banana clips for you monkey, n-ggers that try to bomb me 
 Ya got a problem, bring Rico, he came to find me 
 We don't f-ck with Tommy's, only the ones for the hommies 
 Got the whole hood on sour diesel and (?), now it's hard to find me 
 At Puerto Rico with some mammies heatting bags, reminiscing the L.A. and the Bonnie, 
 Take it back they gave my n-gger life without parole, he didn't stay 
 I can't spend night without the hoes 
 F-ckers, what the f-ck are we discussing? 
 Beat them till they puss, you p-ssy tell us repercussion 
 Hollows to the vest's, thick tips through fleshes 
 Life shorter than websters, hot heads I wet you 
 Young heffers, f-ckers had a line making chedder 
 While y'all was out f-cking with double ups, Mason Betha 
 It's the latest Hefner 
 Purple label keep me fresher, way better texture 
 Bitch out of line, you better check her, boy don't let me catch ya 
 She ain't been around this thorough sh-t, cause you ain't gotta question 
 No guessing who's giving your girl dick 
 Earl Shank, OG, rode around the World with 
 Media circle f-ck all you bitches on that girl sh-t 
 While n-ggers look mad and my pac bag 
 N-ggers better keep up with that block tag 
 Rest in peace to the young n-ggers that got tagged 
 Shout to all the mammas that's lost 'cause we ain't got dads, fags 
 Get off that Beanie Sigel Jay beef, mobile vans out n-gger, this operation safe street 
 Flawless stones up in the sentence division rapping 
 Biggest weapons, smallest pistol 357's send them pricks to heaven 
 Raise hell all you bitches Nobel, 
 F-ck it, we go to jail, pay the visit, this is how we live it 
 Buy the clothes, we by the code, leave them bodies cold 
 No discrimination, body hoes, everybody knows 
 We play that big body rose, black trucks when we lift the mags up 
 Adios, can't deny the flows 
 It been a minute with this rhyming, 
 I knew this sh-t'll happen, but this rapping sh-t is timing 
 I'm on my Philly shit, back up the chart you see me climbing 
 That boy division one, but n-ggers still throw up the Diamonds 
 Shout out Jay Cole, Whattup Hov? 
 Bleek, Rico, division one n-ggas 
 Yeah, wattup n-gger? 
 Hollywood I see, Dame ya talking sh-t n-gger, talking sh-t boy.
