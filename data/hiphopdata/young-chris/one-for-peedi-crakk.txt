(Peedi Crakk) 
 It's not a game I'm from Philly 
 Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly 
 Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs 
 People want to know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang 
 Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing 
 Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they got your number 
 The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing 
 Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they watch your mother 
 Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinng 
 Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers 
 Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers 
 Wait, that's just enough for you to follow 
 Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow 
 Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet 
 Play with them guns to the fullest 
 Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap 
 About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you 
 Treat it just like that... 
 [Peedi C] Now one's for Peedi Crakk 
 [Freeway] And two's for Free' 
 [Young C] Three for Young Gunna 
 [B Sigel] And four for Sig' 
 [Peedi C] You know it's SP yes we above of those things 
 First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting 
 (Freeway) 
 All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme 
 There's still six million ways to D-I-E 
 I'll smack your P-why-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga 
 I live me rhymes, why'all ain't Free 
 But why'all know why'all heard of him 
 Niggaz can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted 
 Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it 
 Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality 
 Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes 
 What you fools think, full bank money from shows 
 It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch 
 I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a rose 
 So what if it's brown from Mac, gotta take it back, back 
 And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back 
 Free, house the trap, push the release day back 
 Me and crack at it again, add it to wax 
 (Young Chris) 
 It's not a game I'm from Philly 
 Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner 
 Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang 
 Mami's spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same 
 Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang 
 Niggaz they act dumb act they think, thangs 
 Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing 
 Niggaz on the street whisperin', Police District and 
 Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear 
 The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em 
 Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them 
 Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him 
 Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em 
 Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too 
 But our father, the number when he ready too 
 Do not bother the rumble, niggaz ready too, bang you in a second 
 Keep the banger for protection 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 It ain't a game I'm from Philly 
 Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens 
 Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch 
 My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang 
 Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG 
 Why'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs 
 Nigga, we can do the damn thang 
 The war ain't over till that fat bitch sang 
 Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne 
 My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya 
 For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle 
 Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again 
 It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne 
 Got bitches on the thang, thang 
 Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings 
 City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang 
 My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang
