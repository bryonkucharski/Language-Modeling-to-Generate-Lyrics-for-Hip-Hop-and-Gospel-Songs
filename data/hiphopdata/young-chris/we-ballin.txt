Yeah, yanahmean? 
 Just something for all my niggas in the hood 
 They always ask me, what I got to say to the youths and 
 Yanahmean when I do these interviews 
 Just want to let 'em know (we ballin) 
 You gotta strap up cause niggas'll test you 
 Whenever you feel that pressure 
 You let 'em know everyday of your life is, check it 
 For real we still killin' 'em and, each one of 'em 
 You know the flow like caine, look it's numbin 'em 
 Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em 
 I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em 
 Mami you rollin', get your clothin' 
 You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open 
 I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari 
 'Cause I been pimpin' this game since Atari 
 You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe 
 I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe 
 'Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin' and 
 We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions 
 Think I'm slippin', like I don't grip again 
 Go 'head trip it ain't nothing to drop a clip again 
 Got my dogs to catch me when I'm fallin' 
 Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin' 
 Nigga we ballin', ready for war and 
 Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin' 
 We ballin', ready for war and 
 Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin' 
 Yeah, I take a sip of that henny I load that tec up 
 I hit the block wit the medicine give 'em check ups 
 You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin' at war 
 These niggas want to see me off, they don't want to see me on but 
 Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth 
 Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin' 
 Re-up by noon, re-kick at night 
 Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life 
 And you youngn's in the hood want to be like P 
 Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P 
 Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit 
 You know how dudes "This Proof ain't for that bullshit" 
 And these hoes want to roll wit a G 
 But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin' the P, cause! 
 Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel 
 Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin' 
 Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood 
 Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me 
 We ride out (and?) we find out (where?) 
 Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah) 
 Who want war? hoes they tellin' me "E's you ain't right" 
 Like this year I'm goin' go South Pole 
 This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't 
 When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight 
 But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point 
 I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point 
 And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game 
 I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same 
 But I see he hard headed, told 'em stay in his lane 
 Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause
