(Intro: Chorus) 
 So want you ride with me, my ghetto queen 
 You're all that I need 
 'Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need 
 Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G [x2] 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 Girl I done been around the globe and you the realest lil'lady I know 
 Don't wanna ever let you go - cause oh 
 Everytime I call you be there for me 
 Baby girl I love you by my side 
 So anything you need, that means you got me 
 So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride 
 (Verse 1: Trae) 
 Look here lil'momma I'm gangsta 
 Prolly nothin' like you done delt with on the day to day 
 Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae 
 I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out 
 And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out 
 You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot 
 I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block 
 So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet 
 And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin' right back out ya way 
 I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home 
 Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin' - rollin' stone 
 And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone 
 'Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome 
 Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit 
 I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin' all that lover shit 
 I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit 
 And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 (Verse 2: Rich Boy) 
 Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma 
 We can go the Bahamas in the summer 
 Lookin' for the fat[? ], fuck the dumb hoes 
 And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the po - po's 
 No pressure I ain't gotta test ya 
 I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser 
 Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous 
 So bad niggas pullin out they cameras 
 Together baby the world can't handle us 
 Hoes can't compete, no challengers 
 Summer time, we float on the boat 
 While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke 
 I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey 
 The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me 
 So on that note you can take this 
 Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B! 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 (Verse 3: Rich Boy) 
 We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi 
 You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me 
 Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi 
 If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi 
 You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back 
 Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat 
 So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly 
 I'm down with my lady till the day that I die 
 (Verse 4: Trae) 
 Say lil'momma what you waitin on - actin' like you don't know no better 
 You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever 
 When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya 
 And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya 
 So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now 
 I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now 
 You can post up and be the bitch I'm tryna find right now 
 And if you can't see that I'm tha truth baby you blind right now, Yeah 
 (Chorus: Till End)
