You niggas gon' learn buck a buckin' 
 D-boy squad buck a buckin' Rich Boy 
 I'm in that phantom, askin' for that gray poupon 
 Look at my arm bitch, ya see the charm bitch 
 Sweet home Alabama, Yeah, I love her 
 I still try to hug her even though she ain't my color 
 Yeah, I'm fucking wit that home boy but ain't nothin' left 
 See, I got enough heart to march with Martin Luther King 
 Got them killers right by me and we can have a party 
 If ya niggas wanna try me, surprise 
 We got some fireworks for ya 
 Pop the trunk, get the gift inside lemme show ya 
 Niggas treat that coke like a joke 
 A cocaine city's like a murder up in Copeland 
 Pick ya brain like a buncha snow flakes 
 Yeah, I put that weight down, now it's real estate 
 Tell me watcha know 'bout me boy 
 That's me, I'ma mothafuckin' d-boy 
 Tell me watcha know 'bout me boy 
 That's me, I'ma mothafuckin' d-boy 
 Yeah, so go d-boy, yeah, so go d-boy 
 Yeah, so go d-boy, yeah, so go d-boy 
 If it ain't the truth me and my nigga don't write it 
 9 years from the day my uncle man got indicted 
 I thank God for the hard times when I suffer 
 He protect me like a Mother, nigga now, I'm tuffer 
 Can't forget about you prof, I still see ya 
 I'm at the graveyard everyday, I can't leave ya 
 I feel your soul when I'm writing with the pen 
 Fuck what them niggas say you my brother till the end 
 Nigga save a spot for me, tell God I'm coming 
 Niggas killin' fo' that money but they're leavin' here with nothing 
 If it a game motherfucker, I'ma win it 
 As far as I'm concerned, ain't no competition in it 
 Call me the gritty green 'cause I'm wanna lie 
 Now my mommy better thank what she got 
 Get some shit, just got a new house 
 Congratulations 'cause ya son made a million with his mouth
