 It was a girl named Shanda 
 Drove a Honda 
 Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama 
 The real grown type 
 She was always right 
 Couldn't get along with Pops 'cause they stayed in a fight 
 If it ain't skipping school going out with grown men 
 Better your man named Sam with a white Benz 
 He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world 
 And even told Shanda 
 You my only girl 
 One night it was late, they kissing and hugging 
 Next thing you know they kissing and loving 
 Two days go by and Sam ain't showed up 
 Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up 
 Mamma found out and had Sam arrested 
 Now Shanda at the doctor's 'cause she wanna get tested 
 When the results came back it was positive 
 That's the thing about life; you learn and you live 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 I said young girl 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 Even darkness comes to light 
 I said young girl

 Get up yourself 
 Get a man who ?.. 
 Even though sometimes you may be lost girl 
 Don't worry about... this is your world, your world 
 Get a man who ?. 
 Even though sometimes you may be lost girl 
 Don't worry about... this is your world, your world 
 It was a girl named Courtney 
 She was fine as hell 
 She was looking for a man with a lotta mail 
 She had big dreams about the real good life 
 And everything she wanted had a real high price 
 Like Dolce Gabbana, Gucci and Prada 
 So if you ain't spend big Courtney ain't holler 
 She all about the dollar, but let's go way back 
 When Courtney was going with this hard working cat 
 A drug dealer came along and? 
 Next thing you know she was taking it right 
 We part of the reason why she at where she at 
 Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack 
 His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke 
 Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope 
 She stuck with two kids and no child support 
 I did it for girls taking life for a joke 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 I said young girl 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 Even darkness comes to light 
 I said young girl 
 Even darkness comes to light young girl 
 I said Get up stand up for your life young girl 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 I said young girl 
 Get up stand up for your life 
 Get up stand up for your life young girl 
 Even darkness comes to light 
 He said Even darkness comes to light 
 Young girl
