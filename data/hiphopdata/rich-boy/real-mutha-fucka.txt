Daddy ain't raise no punk, momma ain't raise no sucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm a real muthafucka, I'm a real muthafucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 Daddy ain't raise no punk, momma ain't raise no sucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm a real muthafucka, I'm a real muthafucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm getting bread with some butter, bitch in my cut yes I her 
 Swerving on pump muthafucka, spin out and burnout some rubber 
 See I can spot undercovers before they catch us and cuff us 
 You pussy niggas can't touch us, I bang and bust on you bustas 
 I like to pop a few bottles, drinkin' down three with some models 
 They like the Chevy and swallow I pull another tomorrow 
 I keep it real you a lie you the first to testify 
 Telling on me selling pie, if you done nobody cry 
 On my common denominator, that money bring dirty paper 
 Don't know what to do with haters, call me the exterminator 
 Too much for the piggy bank, that purple shit is what I drank 
 A real nigga what you ain't, so fuck you and what you thank 
 Daddy ain't raise no punk, momma ain't raise no sucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm a real muthafucka, I'm a real muthafucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 Baby mommas and wifeys ya they know I'm that nigga 
 Police shoot through my name, Ds follow my twitter 
 Suckas pointing me out, I never told on a man 
 I'm in the lineup wasn't me now I'm back on the lane 
 Swagger makes the bitches pop, I took a cab and I was shot 
 I was rapping I was rapping cooking deal in the pot 
 Free D-BO and Wok, real niggas for life 
 And at my shows get real usually end up in fights 
 Bitch niggas is tripping and my killers is itching 
 Favorite room in the mansion it's probably the kitchen 
 Cops kill little lotto, eat a dick is the motto 
 Learn the green collision if I don't make it tomorrow 
 Daddy ain't raise no punk, momma ain't raise no sucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm a real muthafucka, I'm a real muthafucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 The realest niggas jus popped in it, do it like Pac did it 
 Boxers is showing my pants sag and the Glock in it 
 Cars with no tops with it, these niggers do not live it 
 Hole in my bottle enjoy the air of that God given 
 Did it for my city, did it for my borough 
 Do it for my niggas in cages and dark tunnels 
 Fuck what these pussy saying, these niggas is industry 
 Lord I can't help it I beat 'em like we was in the street 
 Fuck all my with my enemies while I'm getting my dick sucked 
 In Vegas where I'm living like I don't give one fuck 
 Real recognize I got a homie named Rich boy 
 There's only one mission baby and that's to get rich boy 
 Daddy ain't raise no punk, momma ain't raise no sucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka 
 I'm a real muthafucka, I'm a real muthafucka 
 I don't like fake niggas, 'cause I'm a real muthafucka
