Yeah, Rich Boy, man, I'm pimpin' like that 
 I keep flickin' these dollars, girl and you know 
 I just got somethin' on my mind 
 Hold on Polow, man, stop throwin' money, man 
 Let me see what's happenin' wit' this man 
 It's one thing I gotta ask, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 If I fly you first class, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, yeah, touch that ass 
 Now I don't mind throwin' cash, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, yeah, touch that ass 
 Ya homegirl kinda bad, can I touch her ass? 
 Touch her ass, oh yeah, touch her ass 
 You might catch me on Cheetah's wit a down dick eater 
 Standin' on the block in a fresh wifebeater 
 Filet mignon, me and Polow Da Don 
 Why they call you Rich Boy? Look at my charm 
 Look at my bracelet and look at my arm 
 Shakin' my wrist might just start a snowstorm 
 Up in the club and we gettin' it on 
 Poppin' big bottles and spillin' Patron 
 D-Boys be the squad, Zone 4 be the label 
 Got a 645 wit the satellite cable 
 They say I wouldn't make it but I still made it happen 
 One point three mill' and just start rappin' 
 Yeah, I got a room when you suck on my dick 
 'Cause if you suck on my dick you better swallow that shit 
 Ya young bitch, niggas still runnin' they mouth 
 It's one thing that I gotta ask, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass

 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 Ya homegirl kinda bad, can I touch her ass? 
 Touch her ass, oh yeah, touch her ass 
 One dollar, two dollar, three dollar, four 
 When I leave the club, I take two whores 
 Maybe one more, back to the Doubletree 
 Hoes wanna double me and sip bubbly 
 Let's play a lil' game 'Simon Says' 
 Simon says why don't you give Rich Boy some head? 
 No lie, I'm a cool dude 
 Not tryin' to be rude, just tryin' to touch you 
 Yeah, I'm lookin' for that super dome 
 I ain't talkin' 'bout the field they throw the ball on 
 I'm a ball on, make that ass roll 
 Pussy look like gold comin' down that pole 
 Got the whole club outta control 
 Fake ballers in the bitch throwin' rent money, stupid bitch 
 I laugh at that shit, what you wanna do? 
 I got hundred dollar bills, tens and twenties too 
 It's one thing I gotta ask, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 If I fly you first class, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, yeah, touch that ass 
 Now I don't mind throwin' cash, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 Ya homegirl kinda bad, can I touch her ass? 
 Touch her ass, oh yeah, touch her ass 
 I'm takin' my money and spendin' it all 
 All these thick girls that I wanna take home 
 Throwin' big faces until they all gone 
 While I watch all these girls take off they thong 
 Mr. DJ, won't you turn up my song? 
 Bouncin' that ass, I don't see nothin' wrong 
 One bitch, two or three bankrolls 
 Eighty-five thousand dollars worth of Russian rose gold 
 Take a picture of ya broad, put it in my iPod 
 She lick it dry clean when my dick get hard 
 Ain't playin' wit'cha, baby, can I get a lil' grip? 
 Spend a couple chips, I break ya off a big tip 
 It's one thing I gotta ask, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 If I fly you first class, can I touch that ass? 
 Touch that ass, yeah, touch that ass

 Touch that ass, oh yeah, touch that ass 
 Ya homegirl kinda bad, can I touch her ass? 
 Touch her ass, oh yeah, touch her ass
