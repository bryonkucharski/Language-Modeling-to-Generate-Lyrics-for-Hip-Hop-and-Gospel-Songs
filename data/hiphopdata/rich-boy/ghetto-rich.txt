Shit, we tryna get it for real 
 Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused 
 Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka 
 Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised 
 Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's 
 Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police 
 Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police 
 'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win 
 See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen 
 It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone 
 Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home 
 I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back 
 So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack 
 Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep 
 Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap 
 'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends 
 It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men 
 Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends 
 It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men 
 It's where you live, it's where you play 
 It's where you learn your favorite slang 
 Your world is ghetto 
 It's where I live, it's where I'm from 
 It's where you had to tote your gun 
 Your world is ghetto 
 Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter 
 Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her 
 Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate 
 Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate 
 Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know 
 Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show 
 But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin' 
 Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin' 
 Government'd never send me a dime for school 
 So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool 
 I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears 
 Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears 
 It's where you live, it's where you play 
 It's where you learn your favorite slang 
 Your world is ghetto 
 It's where I live, it's where I'm from 
 It's where you had to tote your gun 
 Your world is ghetto 
 I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back 
 Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that 
 Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge 
 Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags 
 Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down 
 See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now 
 Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move 
 Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove 
 Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home 
 Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone 
 On my knees every night conversatin' wit God 
 Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard 
 Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies 
 I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi 
 Even if I take a trip around the world and back 
 I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at 
 It's where you live, it's where you play 
 It's where you learn your favorite slang 
 Your world is ghetto 
 It's where I live, it's where I'm from 
 It's where you had to tote your gun 
 Your world is ghetto, your world, ghetto 
 Throw 'em up if you know what the hood like 
 Throw 'em up if you lookin' for that good life 
 Throw 'em up if ya ghetto, shit 
 Your world, ghetto
