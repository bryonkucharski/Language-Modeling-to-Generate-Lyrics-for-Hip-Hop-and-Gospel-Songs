I will be the one to love and comfort you 
 From now until the day I die 
 I will take you places that you only think 
 About when you're asleep at night 
 Let me take the time to understand 
 And I will 
 Set your spirit free 
 If you get down on me 
 I'll get down on you 
 I will do anything 
 That you want me to 
 It's a game of give and take 
 To make it through 
 So if you get down on me 
 I'll get down on you tonight 
 Nighttime turns to day again 
 And you are on my mind 
 Winter turns to spring and then 
 Life has passed you by 
 Right now we are so young and free 
 But we're runnin' out of time 
 So while we've got each other here 
 Let's treat our bodies right 
 I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
 You'll never get me off of your mind 
 Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
 Make you come tonight 
 Over to my house 
 I'm not the type to change your mind 
 If you want to take it slow 
 No pressure to go all the way 
 There are often places we can go 
 Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
 Two people fall as deep as you and me 
 I want to know every inch of your body so I 
 Can set you spirit free 
 I will be the one to love and comfort you 
 From now until the day I die 
 I will take you places that you only think 
 About when you're asleep at night 
 If you open up to me I'll make you realize 
 The things that you could never see 
 Let me take the time to understand and I will 
 Set you free
