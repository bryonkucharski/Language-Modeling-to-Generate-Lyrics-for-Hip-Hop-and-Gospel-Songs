 Scoe Montana 
 Scoeldie Montana, remember my name 
 I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready 
 Straight out the penitentary, to makin' all this feddy 
 We gangsta rock steady, Bang this in ya Chevy 
 We pushin weight heavy, even if they won't let me 
 Scoe is chillin', makin' a million 
 Stackin his loot till I touch top ceilin 
 Miraculous, toothless, but top notch women 
 Acura roofless blastin my music 
 Adelle on my right, He done got me for my life 
 I'm a star like Tri 
 Crazy youngster livin' the Hard knock life like Jay the hustla 
 I'm a professional mic clutcha plus a dope rhymer 
 Ghetto potent, perfect timing I"m an opportunist 
 Takin' advantage of my youth, fresh when I do it 
 The homie Kokane, tighter than choker chains 
 Soakin up the game with dreams of Roscoe's name being a houshold name 
 We ballin, ghetto fabulous, just trying to do my thang 
 In this dope game switchin four lanes 
 I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready 
 Straight out the penitentary, to makin' all this feddy 
 We gangsta rock steady, Bang this in ya Chevy 
 We pushin weight heavy, how much you want bet me? 
 Scoe is chillin', lyrical villain 
 Straight up outta Philly, West Coast feel me 
 I pack Mac millies, Daz with Daz Dillies 
 Dippin through LA where it don't get chilly 
 I got a attic where I stash my scrilla 
 Keep a automatic mini heata by the attic 
 Homie my gat blast, speratic blast 
 (I'm) Young Scoedizzle, (I'm) keepin' it rizzle 
 (With) Heaters that sizzle, Me an young bizzle 
 Hit the cypher up and stand in the middle 
 Puttin' MC's in the Rap Hospital 
 Hospitable, Roscizzo my flizzo not spitable 
 My dizzo not get-able, anything digital 
 Un F-with-able, we incredible and that's inevitable 
 I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready 
 Straight out the penitentary, to makin' all this feddy 
 We gangsta rock steady, Y'all niggaz ain't ready 
 Bang this in ya Chevy, we pushin weight heavy 
 Dp, dp, dpg 
 Dp, dp, dpg 
 Dp, dp, dpg 
 Dp, dp, dpg 
 Scoe is gettin', in where I fit in 
 Splittin bad rubbers, keep it thuggin' keep livin' 
 Keep givin' all I got, takin' what I want 
 Breakin down the sacks, and crack open a blunt 
 Crack the window to get some fresh oxygen 
 This little Porche we hot boxin in 
 I'm a G to the fame low key in the game 
 I got the key to the game DPG is the gang 
 I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready 
 Straight out the penitentary, to makin' all this feddy 
 We gangsta rock steady, Bang this in ya Chevy 
 We pushin weight heavy, even if they won't let me 
 Dp, dp, dpg...

 We still bangin' in space the new generation
