(Baby) Yeah 
 I mean, I mean 
 (Let's talk about, what you mean?) 
 Y.A 
 (It's all good you know) 
 Roscoe 
 (I don't know about the J-Lo) 
 (Crib? Uh-uh, naw baby) 
 (Call me later, aight?) 
 Every morning when I wake up and open my eyes 
 I check my pager to see what up with all of my wifes 
 They all love me and occasionally they hear of each other 
 But they never bump into one another 
 See I'm a real player baby 
 I got my act down cold, play the roll 
 Believe what you wanna believe 
 You want me to leave? I'm out! 
 I don't need this grief 
 You probably the type of chick that would call police 
 Shoudn't never got involved wit cha 
 But see it all it went down so quick and now its hectic 
 I couldn't care a girl so fine, but so lost in the mind 
 To me it was just a good time 
 So don't sweat me and I won't sweat you 
 You don't forget me and I won't forget you 
 I'ma try to do this thang right 
 So every single time we do get together 
 We make it special like last night 
 Scodie (Whassup?) 
 Why you act like you don't know me? (Say what?) 
 After all the things you told me, last night (Yeah) 
 Last night, Last night (Last night) 
 Last night (Yeah, Why you act like? Scodie why you act like? Yeah) 
 We started all slow wit da park, just chillin' 
 Politicin, I remember (last night) 
 It was such a good feelin' I can never forget 
 The way we met baby, I remember (last night) 
 See its plain and simple 
 There was a chemistry that couldn't be coincidental 
 Like it was meant to be 
 Intimately, mentally, sensually, physically 
 It was devine destiny for you to get with me 
 Lookin' all good, the smellin' all bombs 
 Straight up out the hood labeled as a dime 
 You said you got a record, you could make it after nine 
 I'm chill'd wit that, but then you hit his brother back 
 You said you called out and I should come where you was at 
 I knew it was also known as "I got directions to the flats" 
 So I hit the gas station to get a pack of magnums 
 Cause anything can happen, I remember (last night) 
 Scodie (Whassup?) 
 Why you act like you don't know me? (Haha, yeah) 
 Why you actin' baby? (Say what?) 
 After all the things you told me last night (Haha, yeah, yeah) 
 Last night, last night (Last night) 
 Last night (Last Night, yeah, yeah) 
 You said the right things, you blew my mind 
 Whispered sweat words, sayin' you want my ties 
 Don't front boy, you remember all the lies 
 (You told me...) 
 Baby I just gotta make you mine 
 You're fine, yeah, you know that you's a dime 
 So don't waste my time, be here by... NAAAAAH! 
 Scodie, Scodie (Whassup?) 
 Why you act like you don't know me? 
 Why you actin' like you don't (Say what?) 
 After all the things you told me last night (Haha)
