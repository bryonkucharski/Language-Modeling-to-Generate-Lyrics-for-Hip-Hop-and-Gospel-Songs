 Yeah 
 Yeah, that's wassup 
 You say you wanna roll (with me that's wassup) 
 And I'mma beat it down (until you've had enough) 
 But still it's only for tonight (so let's make it fun) 
 Girl I gotta catch a flight (when the morning comes) 
 You know it's only ever so often I get to get away and relax 
 So it's important when I call for you to come and [?] 
 It's been a while since I've been in town 
 I got a hectic schedule and I get around 
 But every time I touch down and we get together 
 The anticipation and waiting always make it better 
 Imagination of you and me, having relations 
 Until the floorboards rise, look me in my eyes 
 Hypnotized by your hips and thighs 
 Your lips and your size 
 Wanna tear it out the frame right in front of the guys 
 But they gonna bounce in minute, then it's on 
 Time to finish what we started last time we got the bone 
 Getting busy to the fifth degree 
 Now how many licks does it take to get to the centre? You tell me 
 But don't be mad at me if you wake up all alone, and I'm already gone 
 I'll be back baby all you gotta do is listen for the phone.

 Girl I gotta catch a flight (when the morning comes) 
 Girl nobody do it better than me 
 But you already knew 
 Still I gotta handle my business and keep my revenue 
 Gotta catch a plane but I'll be back soon 
 Believe that (believe that) 
 We can get back and resume the beat that (beat that) 
 But you can't be stressing be, either 
 I hate it when you blow me up, stressing my beeper 
 All you gotta do is wait and let it marinate 
 A little patience is all it takes 
 Until I'm gone, baby hit the brakes 
 I travel state to state and country to country 
 Can't come and see you every time you want me 
 But when I do call lady work your while 
 I'll get you open like a woman giving birth to child 
 Don't be frontin' if I bone out 
 Relax baby, don't I always come back baby? 
 To dry your eyes 
 And I'm gonna miss you but it's time to go 
 Gotta catch a plane in 20 minutes, 
 Baby

 Me and the homies had a show do to in Reno 
 After the concert we went to the casino 
 Security was deep so I had to creep through 
 That's when I peeped you in your black see-through 
 Me and Gotti 'bout to bounce out the back-way 
 That's when I noticed something that made me walk that way 
 Something about the way you guzzle in that alazay 
 Straight out the bottle but you looking like a supermodel 
 You bounce with me and we got a couple six-packs 
 And then we dip back to the room and kit-kat, and chit-chat 
 One thing led to another 
 Next thing I know, we couldn't keep our hands off each other 
 All on the floor, out of control 
 'Do not disturb' sign on the door 
 You tellin' me it's on ma, but I already know 
 And to be honest, it's good but I don't want it though 
 I only want it for tonight 
 Girl

 You already know wassup man 
 You know how I get down 
 We've been doing this for a long time 
 It's not a game 
 That's just the way it's gonna be 
 Deal with it 
 Bitch.
