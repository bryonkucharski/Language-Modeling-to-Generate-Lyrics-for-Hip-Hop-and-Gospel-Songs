You wonderin', how big a empire is he gon' make? 
 Just got off a major tour, bet everybody knows his name 
 Yeah that boy eatin' better, stackin' chips, that's Frito-Lay 
 You not with Reach no more, so 116 is he okay? 
 That's the question that they ask me 
 I shake they hand and smile and say, "Everything is dandy" 
 But deep inside sometimes I wish them conversations passed me 
 And debates about who better, you, Lecrae, or Andy? 
 Signed this deal, I bet that we can change your life today 
 I'm no little mermaid, I won't let you take my voice away 
 Derek Minor, I'm a Tesla, you can't gas me man 
 They promise you the world but don't deliver like it's Sunday 
 All that I know, all that I know 
 Not gainin' the world or losin' my soul, losin' my soul 
 When I wanna give up, He tellin' me go, tellin' me go 
 Buildin' His Kingdom will never get old, never get old
