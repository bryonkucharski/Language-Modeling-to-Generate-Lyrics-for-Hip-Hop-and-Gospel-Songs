(Verse 1 - Derek Minor) 
 They tell us that we savages 'cause where them hard, not classes is 
 Dudes will leave you in bandages 
 It's only one rule where the cashless live 
 Survive or reside where them caskets is 
 Yeah, they roll they problems in swishers and blow 'em in the sky 
 Born in hell but hoping that they can get high and rise 
 Tired of steppin' over crack fiends 
 Rather deal it to smoke it, he got crack dreams 
 They broke it so drug dealing is his only hoping 
 And ain't no doctors and lawyers living out where he posted 
 When he see doctors and lawyers, his yellow liquor pourin' 
 On the curb 'cause his homie got his head exploded 
 And as I sit on this stage 
 And the drummer play these symbols and thangs 
 Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change 
 Hoping he can pay for a change, for real ... 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 I wish that things was different ... 
 And we was really livin' ... 
 It must be something missin' ... 
 'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life 
 Today it seem we only getting by 
 (Verse 2 - Derek Minor) 
 See I remember when me and Tommy was barreling down the country road 
 He smoking strong, I'm coming up with the sickest flows 
 At least to me they was, I'm like "you feel that, 'cause?" 
 He blew the smoke in my face so I could get a buzz 
 Fast forward, I'm rappin' and tryna get a buzz 
 Think if you knew who I was that would replace the love 
 That was gon' 'cause I rarely had a daddy home 
 And when I did it was different 'cause I wasn't his own 
 I bet you wanna be a rock star 
 Mix the white with the soda and get rock hard 
 But remember, while you tryna hit your quota 
 There's a kid at home losin' his parents to buy your new car 
 And as I sit on this stage 
 And the drummer play these symbols and thangs 
 Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change 
 Hoping he can pay for a change, for real ... 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 I wish that things was different ... 
 And we was really livin' ... 
 It must be something missin' ... 
 'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life 
 Today it seem we only getting by 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Yes sir, hey I remember as a young buck 
 All I wanted outta life was dumb luck 
 Enough money that I could fill up a dump truck 
 And a whip that I could swing like nunchucks 
 But both of those came second to the females 
 Staring at they backsides, but I couldn't see well 
 Caught up in a chase, would holler for my sake 
 I guess knowing I can pull them would help me to feel safe 
 But them girls wasn't safe though 
 'Cause I was done when I had what I came for 
 It made me feel like I was livin', it ain't so 
 Wish I could go back and take away the pain, bro 
 Now as I sit on the stage 
 And 'em drummers play them symbols and thangs 
 Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change 
 Hoping they can pay for a change 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 I wish that things was different ... 
 And we was really livin' ... 
 It must be something missin' ... 
 'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life 
 Today it seem we only getting by
