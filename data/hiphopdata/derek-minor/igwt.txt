(Verse 1 - Derek Minor) 
 Used to be off of them boats was Africans in ropes 
 Now what get off of these boats is pounds of coke 
 Or sex slaves ... ain't it sick? 
 What you prefer? Take your pick 
 High schools got armed guards 'cause teenagers bear arms 
 And they'll crack your head and put that video on World Star 
 That boy you callin' a nerd got a bomb off in his backpack 
 Plan to get revenge and leave a crater where his class at 
 I saw the sickest thing when Channel 4 News was on 
 A momma put a two-year-old inside a stove 
 We look at third worlds and turn up our nose 
 Got the nerve to tell God we got it on our own 
 (Hook - Thi'sl) 
 One nation under God 
 That's what we supposed to be, that's why I'm praying hard 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 (Verse 2 - Derek Minor) 
 Head cold, so I went to Walgreens 
 Entered the pharmacy and asked for codeine 
 Told them I'm a rapper, they laughed and told me to leave 
 I left with Vitamin C and an itchy throat for weeks 
 We traded cocaine for mollies, heroin for sizzurp 
 The devil eatin' the hood, I think America's for dessert 
 The suburbs love rappers, just come to one of our shows 
 You'll see Tabitha and Matthew repeating all our flows 
 While you think she tryna get that tat, but think you wearin' a snapback 
 'Cause culture don't discriminate and you just thinkin' it's black rap 
 The poor tryna survive, we forgot about the ghetto 
 Now my hood is famous, and Satan is Geppetto 
 (Hook - Thi'sl) 
 To the republic, for which it stands 
 Please take the government and put it in his hands 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 (Verse 3 - Derek Minor) 
 To all the patriots who died in war bloody, every slave 
 I lift this country to the Lord and in Jesus' name I pray 
 That the gospel rip our heart, and we turn from wicked ways 
 I know you gave us this country and they takin' it to date 
 So listen to me, politician: I'm not talking superstition 
 It's the fight and the survival of a nation, and we gon' need way more than religion 
 In a tragedy we run to he who gives us hope and then we get up fixedly 
 But I pray that we forever let America submit to the King so one day we'll be ... 
 (Hook - Thi'sl) 
 One nation under God 
 That's what we supposed to be, that's why I'm praying hard 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust 
 To the republic, for which it stands 
 Please take the government and put it in his hands 
 In God We Trust 
 I said In God We Trust
