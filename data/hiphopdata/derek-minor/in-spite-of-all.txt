In spite of all your wrongs, my love for you keeps rollin' strong 
 Black ski mask, 50 taught him how to ride 
 Watch him with the .40, call him Kobe, he a shooting guard 
 Owner of the store, he always be trippin' 
 So after he do his count, we gon' catch him slippin' 
 That's when he thought in his brain he heard a bang 
 Then the owner came out with that thang and let 'em rang 
 He hit the owner in his neck, ended with his death 
 Panicked, threw the gun in the trash, and then he left 
 Now he in front of the judge dodging the book 
 'Cause sin got no sympathy for killers and these crooks 
 Uh, gave him life in the clink 
 Trapped in the pen, he the ink 
 Contemplated suicide, "I feel like such a fool" 
 "Is there a heaven for a gangster? Can I be renewed?" 
 And around that time there was a guard controlling Block 2 
 Looked in his cell, said "God told me to tell you ..." 
 In spite of all your wrongs, my love for you keeps rollin' strong 
 Till death do us part, husband and wife 
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours for the rest of my life 
 Infatuation's amazing when it's at very start 
 But two kids and arguments can pull you far apart 
 She driftin', and that dude at work, he listen 
 He notice her when her hair fly, she lovin' his attention 
 A couple lunch dates, they won't hurt her 
 "Besides, it ain't a date if he my co-worker" 
 That's how she rationalizes all the lies that she tells 
 Till them restaurants turn to hotels 
 And them "uh-ohs" turn to "owells" 
 She in an affair, but she wanna end it 'cause it ain't fair 
 Yeah, she break it off, come home, didn't tell her husband 
 He feel broken, betrayed, she gave away her lovin' 
 But instead of hate, he chose another way 
 Love her like Christ, he grab her hand and say ... 
 In spite of all your wrongs, my love for you keeps growing strong 
 Deep inside my heart, I'm growing bitter 
 Not from Kansas City, but I am Chief of sinners 
 If it seem that I am more supreme than 
 Anyone, for really bro, I hope you don't believe that 
 Like Jeffrey Dahmer, I got skeletons inside my closet 
 You see everything, ain't no point in trying to hide it 
 I sit and wonder at times, I talk to you in my lines 
 Like I stay on the grind, but feel at times that I'm high 
 So in these times when I Humpty Dumpty, I fall 
 Turn my phone off when you call, you mean you still there for me, Lord? 
 I don't believe it's that easy that you would die for this treason 
 You said you love me, believe it, I ain't seein' a reason 
 Uh, if I was you I would be through with P 
 And throw him in the Lake of Fire where them demons be 
 I'm Mr. Magoo, your ways I'll never see 
 'Cause I mess up and you keep tellin' me ... 
 In spite of all your wrongs, my love for you keeps rollin' strong
