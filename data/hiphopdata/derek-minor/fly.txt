 I've soared with the angels 
 Wish I was flyin' with them right now 
 Feel like I fell right out of heaven 
 And gravity wanna bring me down, yeah 
 My failures feel so enormous 
 But they pale in comparison to You 
 Lord You, Lord You, Lord 
 And I can hear you sayin' 
 Colton Dixon 
 Keep your head up, don't look down 
 We will rise above the clouds 
 Let go of the world we know 
 And we won't touch the ground 
 Keep your head up and don't lose sight 
 Of the the hope you hold inside 
 Fix your eyes to the sky 
 'Cause we were made to 
 Derek Minor 
 Fly, I know the wind is gettin' crazy now 
 But don't let turbulence take your desire 
 You see I'm pointing at you from the ground 
 Sometimes you need that lift to take you higher 
 You, you, you were made with dreams 
 You only see, you've flown away (a-ay-a-ay-a-ay, a-ay-a-ay) 
 My failures feel so enormous 
 But fell in comparison to you, Lord 
 You, Lord you, Lord 
 And I can hear you say 
 Colton Dixon 
 Keep your head up, don't look down 
 We will rise above the clouds 
 Let go of the world we know 
 And we won't touch the ground 
 Keep your head up and don't lose sight 
 Of the the hope you hold inside 
 Fix your eyes to the sky 
 'Cause we were made to 
 Fly, fly 
 Derek Minor 
 I thank the Lord that I'm in His good graces 
 All I know is that I'm free and this feeling's so amazing 
 Everything I've been through, bringing me close to You 
 The fact that I'm here is proof 
 What am I without you, without you, you 
 Another eagle with these wings that are broken 
 That was made for something greater, and doesn't even notice 
 Who wasn't on the ground, but should be higher than the wind 
 Don't be scared of your purpose if you really wanna live 
 You better fly (fly, fly, fly)

 Keep your head up and don't lose sight 
 Of the the hope you hold inside 
 Fix your eyes to the sky 
 'Cause we were made to 
 Fly, fly 
 Fly, fly
