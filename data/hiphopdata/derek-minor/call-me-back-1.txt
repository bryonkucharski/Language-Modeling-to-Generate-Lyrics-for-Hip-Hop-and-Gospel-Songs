 PRo ... 
 Shawshank. I don't know why I'm hearing this from somebody else - I thought we was closer than this - but I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that you are CHANGING YOUR NAME. I don't get it, but I got it, so good. Me and the other people at the barbershop got some ideas and I wanna lay them out for you right now. Get a pen and a pad, my friend, because these are golden. Cash for gold right here. PRo, the first one is "Elephant Man." Because ever since you got in this rap game, you're the biggest thing out. Number 2 - "Lifeguard." Why "Lifeguard?" Because you're CPR certified! You're resuscitating the rap game, baby! You're resuscitating the rap game! And the last one is - that I like the best - "Solar Calculator." Yeah that's right, "Solar Calculator." Why? Because we gettin' these numbers, doin' a million units, gettin' this money, y'all do the math. Let me know what you think. As your future manager, man, I need to know, OK, I need to know. You need to get back with me, you not callin' me back. Call me back ... because with these names, WE GON' TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
