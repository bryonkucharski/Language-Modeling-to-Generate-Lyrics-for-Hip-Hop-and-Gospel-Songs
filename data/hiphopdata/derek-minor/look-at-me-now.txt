I am not supposed be here 
 I was not invited, I am not supposed to eat here 
 Table with my enemies, snacking on a beat here 
 I can see through every last one of y'all, so be clear 
 I talk about God and how we kings and he live in us 
 But I keep it real, that's why the goons still feeling us 
 Be cool dog disrespect is not the way to deal with us 
 'Cause I can put you in your place kinda like a realtor 
 Got some awards on me now, got some dough on me now 
 Like half time, I had some friends switch goals on me now 
 This session, teach you a lesson if you doze on me now 
 On how to depend on the Lord, 'cause he rose in me now 
 I see a generation, everybody wanna be famous 
 Want everybody to love you, y'all wanna be Raymond 
 Everybody hate truth, so you gone prolly hate this 
 But my foundation on a rock, so I'm ok with being Chris 
 This world evil, it manipulate people 
 Like wearing a suit of armor around magneto 
 RMG assembled this year like the avengers 
 You would swear I'm Stan Lee, how I help you see the vision 
 We ain't got a whole lot, just a few stones trying slay a giant 
 In a industry that say you gotta be Goliath 
 Said we'd be nothing, but they lying 
 See my faith is in what God say, I suggest you try it, it's Minor 
 They said that I will never make it, look at me now 
 I would say that they're mistaken, look at me now 
 I was born broke and naked, look at me now 
 I pray you see the Lord's gracious, look at me now 
 Look here, the difference between me and you 
 Homie that is clear as day 
 You trying to make a mil, I'm trying to give one a way 
 You think you indestructible, I know they we made of clay 
 So I live life desperately, like I'm about to die today 
 Cause that may be my reality 
 In a time when black men are seeing more and more casualties 
 Whether bad cop or gang, I still see it a tragedy 
 And they upload the clips on the net, for the world to see 
 Just to get they click ups, they upload a beat down 
 Fear of being a victim make me wanna walk with heat now 
 But that's not the Lords will, he said advocate for peace now 
 Plus I'm already dead, go head and hashtag me now 
 This oppression is systemic, we don't see it tho 
 Slavery is still alive, prison is the vehicle 
 But we don't wanna talk about it 
 We just wanna share our Twitter thoughts about it 
 Grieve for that young man body that got chalk around it 
 Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see 
 When I look at you, I see somebody just like me 
 Made in the image of God, from the dust like me 
 Blew breath in your body from his lungs like me 
 See I'm trying to paint a picture with my words 
 That'll help you see possessions and they words are not your worth 
 You hearing me now, yeah you hearing now 
 Finally reflecting greatness boy look at you now 
 They said that I will never make it, look at me now 
 I would say that they're mistaken, look at me now 
 I was born broke and naked, look at me now 
 I pray you see the Lord's gracious, look at me now
