 Right by my side 
 Derek Minor 
 Aye you've been with me from day one 
 You make everything better girl you A1 
 Tryna spend my whole life with same one 
 I mean spend my whole life till I ain't none 
 Lately I've been out here makin' these moves 
 But all that I got is nothing without you 
 You the best tell Cali that I said so 
 Had to make you mine when I seen you from the get-go 
 You know that I'm in trouble if I ever lose ya 
 So I'm out here cuffin' like a state trooper 
 And we can do whatever you like it don't bother me 
 Long as you on my arm like an IV 
 I'm sick without ya 
 Anthony Evans Jr. 
 What's a castle without you in it 
 It ain't nothin', no, it ain't nothin' 
 And it don't feel right if you missin' 
 I need your lovin', all your lovin' 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 Chad Jones 
 Too broke for the horse and carriage 
 But you've been so down for the kid I proposed a marriage 
 Old boy, G card, I done turned that in though 
 Said "H.I." to permanent, don't want no rental 
 Baby, girl why you so loyal 
 Only secret's victorian, never change up your story 
 I never need to record my feelings, I vindicate 
 You trippin' on me hard 
 Somehow you done did it, you came before the squad 
 You vote for me, I vote for you too though 
 I choose to curb the ones that ain't you though 
 I caught them feelings I used to just stuck on 
 Without you here buildin' this empire's nothin'

 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 You belong right here, right by my side 
 Anthony Evans 
 I need you by my side 
 And that's how it's supposed to be 
 Cause me without you 
 But that ain't gon' do, no way 
 I need you by my side 
 That's how it's supposed to be 
 Cause me without you 
 That ain't gon' do, no
