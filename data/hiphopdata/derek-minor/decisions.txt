Yeah, yeah 
 Derek Minor and 
 Dre Murray 
 He pulled up to that corner store with nothing but evil on his mind 
 Black hoodie on and a loaded .45 
 His rivals think this a game 
 And they don't know that he hot 
 He gonna throw a couple bullets at him like he Brett Farve 
 They done violated 
 I mean really violated 
 Jumped him on his way home from school 
 Uploaded it to YouTube now everybody laughing 
 But they won't be laughing when he tighten 'em all up 
 With his ratchet, then the phone ring 
 Bruh where you at? 
 Why my gun missing? 
 I told you let it go 
 I told you stop tripping 
 I just picked up Desiah and I gotta get to work 
 Look I know your pride is hurt 
 But don't do nothin' stupid 
 The Devil got the blueprint 
 He wanna put us all in Jail 
 Then Hell 
 I'm in the car now 
 Click, whatever Dre, I ain't got time to listen to what you got to say 
 Chino Dollaz 
 Day to day decisions getting made 
 Foolish pride seem to always to get in the way 
 Probably doing something that'll get me sent away 
 Whatever though 
 Touch me, click clack bang 
 Day to day decisions getting made 
 Foolish pride always seem to get in the way 
 Probably doing something that'll get me sent to the grave 
 Whatever though 
 Touch me, click clack bang 
 Derek Minor and 
 Dre Murray 
 About 20 minutes past and his blood boiled inside 
 There that boy go 
 Hopped up off the ride to the back of that room guard 
 And popped him in his eye 
 Pistol whip that boy till his arm got tired 
 Man I'ma get you first 
 And I'ma get your dogs later 
 You ain't making it out of this one 
 I hope that you been praying 
 Pointed it at his head and right before he started spraying 
 Dre came out of nowhere and tackled him to the pavement 
 Boy have you lost your mind? 
 This is not who you are 
 Get in the car 
 But Dre 
 Get in the car 
 He fussed a little 
 But he knew that Dre was right 
 So he walked to his Cutlass opened the door sat inside 
 Then the sirens came 
 Get on the ground I will blast you right now 
 Don't make a sound 
 You gang banger types, all you do is fight 
 I've been chasing your kind around all night 
 Sir, sir, look sir 
 My name is Andre 
 There was a fight here but now it's okay 
 Right, let's see some ID 
 So he reached in his pocket and all you heard was gun 
 Then bullets got to poppin' 
 The officer turned around to the backup just arrived 
 Officers hold your fire hold your fire! 
 The officer looked back 
 Saw a wallet on the floor 
 And Dre next to it eyes closed he was 
 Gone 
 Anesha Birchett 
 Yeah, think twice one decision can affect your life 
 Yeah it can take your life 
 So choose loving twice 
 We don't want no darkness we want light 
 To change our lifes 
 Before another one gone 
 Gone and gone and gone 
 She gone he gone we gone another gone 
 Whoa don't want another one gone and gone and gone 
 She gone he gone we gone another gone 
 Oh what do you know what do you know what do you know 
 You know
