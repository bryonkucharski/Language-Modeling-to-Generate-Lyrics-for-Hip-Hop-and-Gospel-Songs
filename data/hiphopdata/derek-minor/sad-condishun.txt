This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 But I keep on battling on 
 Uh, aye, aye, good morning 
 The Garden where our innocence died, we're still mourning 
 I rolled up on your cousins like, "listen shorty you're more than 
 Dope boy, jump off Bentley, you are important" 
 But he ain't tryna listen, man he keep on cookin' rocks 
 'Cause he tired of seeing his brother with them holes off in his socks 
 Momma bring these men home, his father they are not 
 But they touch him one more time, might just wind up getting shot 
 Aye, full of rage and pain, I see it in your eyes 
 God is their hope in all, I'm looking at the sky 
 Thinking if we ball, it'll change how we feel inside 
 But the Gospel can only change how we feel inside 
 Christ died for us, ultimate price for us 
 Didn't stay in the ground, got up and rise for us 
 So even if this world is broken, can't never break us 
 My faith isn't in it, my heart is something greater 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 But I keep on battling on 
 I got a problem with myself, I think I need help 
 Ain't tellin' me I'm rich, I think I need wealth 
 I think I need the belt, baby I'm the champ 
 Is you seein' these jewels? Maybe that's the stamp 
 They call it Grade A, skipped over school, never made a grade "A" 
 But I'm staring at this tool that they call a AK 
 Don't that count for something? 
 Money on the scale, no I can't count for nothing 
 No key for my chariot, I just push a button 
 They call it futuristic, but I call it stuntin' 
 I'm just living my life 
 Looking out for my throne on this incredible night 
 One mil in my crown, what an incredible sight 
 You ain't never seen ten fingers shine this bright 
 I say hey, it's all cool, but it don't mean a thing 
 'Cause when you die, it dies, you're an imaginary king 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 But I keep on battling on 
 I'm from the hood where they mask up, strap talk to get cash up 
 Crack flippin' that trap bruh, act tough and get clapped up 
 Yeah, where bodies rot, yeah you can smell death 
 They say the block is hot, I say that's hell's breath 
 Dreads all in they hair, kush smoke in that air 
 Window into his soul, you can see the pain in his stare 
 Uh, since he's a young'un his momma has been the geeker 
 On the streets where, where you could just die for a pair of sneakers 
 They like, "look you can be whatever," "lil homie sky's the limit" 
 Make it about the hood, but he just see peeps dying in it 
 All around's him destruction, that's the norm for his family 
 Tore down his projects, now all that he's known is abandoned 
 Sadly he's been conditioned that this has to be livin' 
 Tell him do better, you'll have to supply a definition 
 What's even sadder, internally he is broke 
 Nobody that'll show that in Jesus should be his hope 
 And that's sad 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 But I keep on battling on 
 Blinded by the world, we stumble 'cause it's all dark 
 Never thought that I would be tempted to fall hard 
 Simple man, yeah, and life is real as ever 
 I study him to learn exactly how he did it better 
 Perfect, not a flaw, not a mistake 
 I used to shine bright, now I'm just praying I don't break 
 Erosion over time, my cleats turn to skates 
 The stress from my slides, you can see it in my face 
 Grace is all I'm leaning on these days 
 I crossed the road and sinners comin' from each way 
 Save me, oh wretched man I am 
 Without these nails in your feet, I don't know how to stand 
 Without these nails in your hands, I don't know who I am 
 Help me turn from this lust, get me out of this jam 
 My soul's at stake, and I could die tonight 
 Chartered the king and he hit me with that private flight 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 This whole world is in a sad condition 
 But I keep on battling on 
 Stuck in the sphere of what's near, sad conditions keep me here 
 Tried outer space, I'm out of place, and I can't breathe up in that atmosphere 
 Every minute that I'm in it, feel the pressure thicken 
 Take my diesel from this scene and this pump injured me from breathing (????) 
 So I say where I'm from, outside the box don't feel like home 
 I wish it did 'cause where I live will be this way till I'm gone 
 Conscious students acting foolish, learning to be unruly 
 See these pupils taking light, folks die for what they refusin' 
 Yeah, movie did a massive thing, same-sex marriages 
 Preacher choked their children out and then they wanna pastor us 
 Plus I did dirt, yeah, hard intent to hurt all 
 Friends to me, enemies, millionaire, slum dog 
 Hustle man, no Martin man, just tryna find a come-up quick 
 Sad condition, heart is sick, sadly man I'm loving it 
 Need to get up out this world, packing for a rocket ship 
 God ain't sent a rocket, but he sent his Son, I'm outta here
