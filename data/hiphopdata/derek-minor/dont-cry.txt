 I know it's so hard to say goodbye 
 And wipe away all of those tears that you cry 
 But when you look and don't know where to be found 
 No mama, mama don't you cry for me now 
 No mama, mama don't you cry for me now 
 Derek Minor 
 I know (I know) 
 You saw me at the worst time, you was prayin' all night 
 And I know (I know) 
 That even when I wasn't right you were standin' by my side 
 'Cause you didn't see what everybody else saw 
 I bet they all wish they all had your vision now 
 You just saw that little boy that God called 
 I'm finally tuned in to your mission now 
 And I can hear you call for me 
 Every time the Devil set them trials for me 
 Set them trials for me 
 And you said I would make it through, oh If I just believe, yeah I just believe 
 The Wright Way 
 You're so right, you're so right 
 Because I found a light, I found a light

 Derek Minor 
 'Cause God heard you on those late nights 
 Told you, "Dry your eyes, you don't have to cry Oh no, you don't have to cry 
 Before that boy was yours, he was mine 
 Your son'll be just fine 
 And ma, you know that God can never lie" 
 'Cause I know that I can't make it on my own 
 I trust the Lord through the storm 
 He stuck his hand out 
 For dear life I'm holding on To be the best father that I can 
 Best husband that I can I'm not perfect, but I'm sticking to his plan 
 So when I lose my life I already lost it for him 
 I get it back, I'll forever live again I'll forever live again 
 Forgave me of my sins 
 Forgave me of my sins 
 Now I know I'm his 
 The Wright Way 
 You're so right, you're so right 
 Because I found a light, I found a light
