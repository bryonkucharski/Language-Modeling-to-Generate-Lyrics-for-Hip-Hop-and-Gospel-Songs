Uh, what up girl, it's been a long time 
 Since I picked up this pen and told you I'm glad you're mine 
 Forever together, nothing can separate us too 
 And if love is scary, baby you my Boo 
 First time I saw you my homies said I was crazy 
 My mind is an art gallery, pictured you with my baby 
 I took your hand as we walked through the sunshine, lady 
 Said "get from under that tree, them other dudes are shady" 
 See I was broke, didn't care about my profit 
 So that sealed the deal, I looked for rings like signing 
 You held me down in this love, I swear that I ain't forgot 
 You deserve diamonds on your finger the size of Ring Pops 
 And when my shoe was untied, they said the boy was trippin' 
 She looked past it all, straight patient with him 
 You a thief girl, you stole my heart 
 I ain't goin' nowhere till death do us part 
 See we in love that's strong, what it mean 
 She independent, but don't mind still calling me king 
 They say it's old school for you to be my only queen 
 Well if we primitive, you fly as Pterodactyl wings 
 Uh, I know I do some things you don't prefer 
 I'm a chiropractor, get all on your nerves 
 We get in arguments, sometimes we say some hurtful words 
 But through that, we see the way that Christ loved the church 
 I'll protect you girl, your man's loyal 
 And Lord have mercy on anyone who put they hands on you 
 We one, and when they hurtin' you they hurtin' me 
 Never wanna see you cry to me, that's an emergency 
 Your superhero chop the dark night, Batman 
 Or call me Superman, nothing like your X-Man 
 I can't believe the Lord put this gift in my hand 
 Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, woman
