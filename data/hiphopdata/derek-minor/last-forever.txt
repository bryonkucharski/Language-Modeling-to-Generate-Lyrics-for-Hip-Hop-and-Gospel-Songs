I want this moment for a lifetime 
 I mean a lifetime 
 You give it all till nothing's left 
 And that's the right time 
 I been buildin' this foundation for a minute 
 You ain't gotta be optometrist for you to see my vision 
 I'm a voice for the voiceless 
 Like that D boy buildin' his kingdom, brick after brick 
 That's feelin' that God done lost him and thinking he got no options 
 Don't know what that life will cost him 
 I swear that's some of my family y'all 
 And you know that I do this for y'all 
 So you see God the only reason I made it at all 
 I sit down and hear your heart, like a stethoscope 
 Then I get up on this mic and tell it for the world to know 
 Unless the Lord buildin' it, I can guarantee it's broke 
 That's why I be spittin' with all this passion when you hear my flow 
 Now I can tell you 'about my new home 
 Brand new car that's on chrome 
 But two years later that's old, everybody's moved on 
 Gone, I'm tryna make it count with this song 
 Yeah, with this song 
 I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever (4x) 
 It's crazy how times change 
 Tryna redecorate my life, switched the pictures in my mind frames 
 Went from hidin' to seekin', trying' to find faith 
 Now we speak with our feet and our hands, call it sign lang 
 You age, we get older turn pages 
 Corners folded, tryna hold on to our place in this maze 
 See we gave, years of grown' fast pace it's clear to know 
 Want a direction we would go and that's what we call His grace 
 And we're still here 
 No more letters in them bottles, message still clear 
 Lived our lives for a throttle, trna fail fair 
 Ever our foods flash MacDonald's, slow it down 
 Change up the pitch somethin' like vibrato 
 But eventually we find this 
 If you mention all the times that you acted wild and mindless 
 Rewind it, that's simply just a line that 
 Minus sign, it change the sum of our lives 
 Man, this victor is timeless 
 I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever (4x) 
 I wanna leave somethin' important on this Earth before I die 
 So many watches I done purchased 
 But I still ain't buyin' time 
 You see doubt is like a brain tumor 
 It torture those alive 
 So I'm askin' God to please remove this evil from my mind, yeah 
 I wanna live without these chains on me 
 So much dirt, I wanna live without these stains on me 
 Lord I need Your grace on me 
 God I live to see Your face only 
 And by faith only, You know that I want this to last forever 
 I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever (4x)
