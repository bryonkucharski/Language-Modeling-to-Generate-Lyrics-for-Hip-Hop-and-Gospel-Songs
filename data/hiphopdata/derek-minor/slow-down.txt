Tell them, tell them boys pour up, drink till you throw up 
 If they, if they hatin', hatin' you gon' tell 'em get their dough up 
 Party, party, party through the night till the sun up 
 Hustlin', hustlin' all day, no breaks till you come up 
 Derek Minor 
 You better slow (down, down, down, down, down, down, down) 
 You better slow (down, down, down, down, down, down, down) 
 You got green, purp, brown, white, gone almost every night 
 Bad one at the crib, when you get home she gon' get you right 
 You don't play games and they know what's up 
 If it ever go bad you gon' pop your trunk 
 And you spend dough on that Keisha, them boys better duck when they see it 
 You got plenty guns, if you need to, you gon' fire off with that nina 
 It's get dough, then more dough, it's smoke dro, then more dro 
 You feel like that's real life? Oh no 
 Get all the girls that you want, that ain't gon' make you a man 
 Waste all the time that you want, you ain't gon' get it again 
 Body yourself and keep thinkin' you winnin' 
 But you know in your heart that this ain't really livin' 
 I am your brother, I want so much more for you 
 You could be more if you listened and slowed down 
 Tony Tillman 
 You ain't really 'bout that life, you ain't never been in no trap 
 You ain't never bust no strap, bang no loud, you ain't never sold no crack 
 See the only thing you poppin' is a pill, homie chill 
 Tear drop on your cheek, but we know that ain't real, who you killed? 
 Talk so hard my dude but we know it ain't true, I know that's fake 
 You claim you what? Hold up, who initiated you? It's cool, I'll wait 
 See I know real killers, real killers, real gang bangers, real drug dealers 
 And they ride around with that work, and tell me they don't go to church 'cause they thugs 
 And they pack them pistols in the back of vans 
 Seasoned shooters holding Zatarain's 
 Light your block up like Afghanistan, duh, duh, duh, duh, choppers like a Taliban 
 Homie understand, when you playin' with the flame 
 That you're bound to get hurt 
 Tryin' to be a bad boy, 'posed to mess around and get smart 
 But we know you ain't down to get murked 
 You better slow down 
 Tedashii 
 Man, hold up, tell them boys to pour up 
 I love the feelin' till you kneelin' on the floor to throw up 
 Man, hold up, see I done came down 
 We either snoozin' or we doin' time 
 Either way we losin' time 
 We tell them boys to slow down, they like what for? 
 'Cause it's about to go down, oh you ain't know bruh? 
 All of it, yeah all of it, ruins lives but y'all all love it 
 I ain't innocent though 'cause we all does it 
 But I'm close enough to see it's all nothin' 
 Chasin' after the wind, you never will win 
 It feels good again and again but leaves you empty again in the end 
 Chasin' after the wind, you never will win 
 It feels good again and again but leaves you empty again in the end 
 Hold up 
 Tell them boys pour up (Choppers like a Taliban) 
 Tell 'em get their dough up 
 Party, party, party (Feel like that's real life) 
 Hustlin', hustlin' all day, no breaks till ya come up 
 You better slow (down, down, down, down, down, down, down) 
 You better s-s-s-slow (down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
