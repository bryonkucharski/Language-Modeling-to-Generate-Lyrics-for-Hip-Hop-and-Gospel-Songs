I can only be me, I don't fit in 
 That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win 
 Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement 
 And I stay real and I stay true 
 You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it 
 I can only be me, I can only be me 
 You be in jeopardy tryna fit me in a category (yeah) 
 I mean I hate boxes that's a common fact if you know me 
 Bounce through my life like its Safari looking for old news 
 The history's deleted like I'm looking at things I ain't supposed to 
 The old me is gone I buried it next to the beats that I murdered 
 You want the same thing yes I would urge it 
 I don't concur with ideas opposite of my purpose (nah) 
 And you shouldn't either (uh uh) 
 Time to be you now (time to be you) 
 They said we would fail now they eating them words like its alphabet soup now 
 Enjoy it 
 I can only be me, I don't fit in (I don't fit in) 
 That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win (swish) 
 Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement (whoo!) 
 And I stay real and I stay true 
 You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it 
 I can only be me, I can only be me 
 I want you to win (I want you to win) 
 I want you to raise up the trophy 
 I want to lock arms with all of my dogs 
 Don't want to see no one below me 
 I want to see you be the person you meant to be 
 I want you to see your potential 
 Regardless if they all dismiss you 
 Even when you feel the planet's against you 
 Just remember who made it 
 Remember who hung every star in the sky 
 Like (?) got it don't you worry 'bout another comment 
 Even when they try to shoot you down like comets 
 Honestly, time to be you now 
 And if you live being who you meant to be that's a taste success now 
 Enjoy it 
 I can only be me, I don't fit in (I don't fit in) 
 That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win (swish) 
 Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement (whoo!) 
 And I stay real and I stay true 
 You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it 
 I can only be me, I can only be me 
 This is when you realize what you're looking at is really quite rare 
 I don't gotta brag on my accomplishments cause my wiki page is over there 
 I rather talk about Christ blood 
 Still here when the hype is done 
 And if I ever crossover know I'm tryna revolutionize it like Iverson (ugh) 
 I heard a lot of people say some things about these years 
 I've been an outcast with 3000 problems but I'm big-boying these fears 
 They wanna try to pull me in the game, turn me to pawn I can't believe it 
 But I never trust a blind referee 'cause he will only call it like he see it 
 Listen, you got a purpose 
 Hold it tighter than a python at all costs 
 Cause there's a lot of snakes that will crush your dreams until the life's gone 
 One of a kind, don't ever despise the person that you're made to be 
 Cause you can only be you and I can only be me
