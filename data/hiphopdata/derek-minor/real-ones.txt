 I look around it's a drought of the real right now 
 They dying of thirst, it's a drought of the real right now 
 I can't be chameleon, I can't wear a mask in pursuit of the millions (in pursuit of the millions) 
 I know who I am and I just be myself, that's the reason they feel it (they feel me now) 
 How I'm a talk about 
 How God can change all of these people now (how) 
 If I'm only real in His steeple now? (steeple now) 
 And don't live out none what I talk about? 
 I only surround myself with the people that keep it one thousand (that keep it one thousand) 
 I'm not getting younger, got no time to waste if you not really 'bout it (you gotta be 'bout it) 
 We about what we say 
 This true religion, but you can't buy this at the store though, you dodo (you dodo)

 Everybody know I'm putting on for my dogs 
 Everybody know I'm putting on for the cross 
 The way I kill the beat, y'all gone have to call the law 
 Go get queen latifah I'm about to set if off 
 Good gracious, I been running all out of patience 
 If you want the real, boy, I got it by the cases 
 Gimme one shot, boy, I might will take it 
 Be it, be a hit like Mike Will made it (oh Lord) 
 I ain't bragging, I'm just telling y'all (y'all better listen up) 
 This one here for God, I'm a give my all 
 And I ain't scared to talk about it, I'm a talk about it 
 How many people almost died, but live to talk about it 
 They thought that I was dead and put this chalk around me 
 They forgot the Lord, He got His arms around me 
 RMG a navy, better yet a army 
 So let me talk my talk, you could never harm me 
 My life in His hands, oh my life in His hands I ain't worried 'bout nothing 
 I boast in His goodness that's why I'm still here, that's the end of discussion 
 I reflect His greatness, I reflect His greatness, might be why you hate it 
 We strong in His mercy, we strong in His mercy, that's why you can't break us
