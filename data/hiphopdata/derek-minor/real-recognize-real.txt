 The whole truth, nothing but it 
 Ben Franklin my witness, boy I keep it one hundred 
 So if I say I ain't playing, ain't no flodging or frontin' 
 I got the ball, I cut my legs off before I punt it 
 Bruh said that we fake, I don't know where he heard that 
 Probably met some pulpit pimp with a perm and a Cadillac 
 No I ain't like him at all, I am not perfect dawg 
 But even when I fall, I know Christ paid it all 
 And I preach that, only hope so I teach that 
 Co-signed by that boy Lecrae, so I guess you say that I Reached that 
 I'ma try to live what I talk about until they pit my coffin out 
 And if I'm wrong I call it out so you can see what my God about 
 I don't want you to think that I'm perfect, I just want you to see the Lord is worth it 
 All I got is his grace and mercy 
 And guess what, boy? I don't deserve it

 (Lecrae) 
 Aye y'all so unfamiliar, I ain't never seen you bro 
 And where you say I know you from? And who you say you know I know? 
 It's one thing I can't take, a flodge and a fake when it come to faith 
 And I ain't flawless, ain't the standard, but I'ma sure enough be a living example 
 Ol' Saints came in and laid the tracks, blood, sweat and tears, skin off they backs 
 These new cats here tryna ride the train, and folks hopping on telling lies and things 
 Trying to derail with false details, everybody looking like we fail 
 I seen your kind for a long time, you fake Gucci, no retail 
 Y'all don't fool me with empty rhymes, cliché words, preachy lines 
 Everybody here been made homie, can't nobody vouch for your life in grind 
 Who discipled you? Where you serving, mayne? What ya reading, bruh? What ya learning, mayne? 
 Listen we ain't even in no gang, but this thing realer then the set you claim 
 Look, this ain't some Faith I made, faith made me, you could tell I'm changed 
 You probably wondering why the folk look at you strange, you a stranger, they never heard your name

 (Pettidee) 
 Real recognize real, pushers recognize deal 
 Predators recognize prey, killers recognize kill 
 You thought you was a real gangster in a jeep then they rolled up on you with a .45 
 Shot that boy in the club, now you in the parking lot and it's 'bout to get live 
 Homeboy is 'bout the west side, yo kinfolk get riders' lives 
 Fist to the face, gun go out, take that air, ridin' high 
 Now you come back to your Father raising your hands high 
 I won't return to my vomit, stand up with the men of Christ 
 Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life, that's the Author and Father 
 Greater is he that's in me than choppers poppin' and stop ya 
 Don't die in these streets, you are purposed for something 
 If they tear down your hood and change your block, then the game was all for nothing 
 Bangers, thugs, killers, drugs, dealers too happy to bleed 
 The aftermath of willingness, we refusin' to read 
 Is there eternal life, turnin' from Christ and you still 
 Live like hell and see heaven? Nope, THAT AIN'T REAL
