 I bet you just want to let your light shine 
 It feel like you been waiting for the right time 
 This is your moment, moment, moment 
 It's time to change the world 
 Derek Minor 
 We are the brightest 
 We won't succumb to the darkness 
 The Lord knows we need light right now 
 You know He's calling, cryin' out from the mountain 
 Telling us to come home right now 
 You're my brother (woah, woah, woah) 
 We don't have to fight anymore 
 Oh, brother (woah, woah, woah) 
 None of us win in this war 
 Beautiful people don't you know your made in his image 
 The image of greatness? 
 Why don't we see His reflection inside one another 
 And all of our faces?

 What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? 
 But you know it's no time to waste, better get up

 Oh yeah, you're made for more 
 Even when our hope is lost, never let up

 I know to know brother (woah, woah, woah) 
 None of us win in this war
