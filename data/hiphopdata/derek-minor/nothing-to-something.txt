 Oh don't you judge me 
 Please don't you judge me 
 You supposed to love me 
 You looking down like you standing above me but I'm so used to that yeah 
 America acting like they sinless they don't play their part 
 They just blame it on us 
 Land of the free was built for free off of Granny back 
 They just take it from us 
 Enslaved us and just took our culture till nothing left 
 Beat us and broke us with noose around our neck 
 Sold our families and raped our mothers with no respect 
 And told us if we learned to read it would be certain death 
 And that's the hand that we was dealt played it till Jim Crow 
 White hoods and shotguns intimidate our vote 
 But still we persisted tried to believe 
 Even if assassins kill our kings with dreams 
 And I ain't asking for no sympathy 
 But the difference in our history often affects who we intend to be 
 And don't you dare talk 'bout a broken home 
 Cause for 250 years all our families was bought and sold 
 Still trying to put it together, I feel like it's taking forever 
 It ain't for a lack of trying we trying to do better 
 Gotta rise above it 
 Trying to turn this nothing into something

 Little homie nothing did the trick (uh) 
 Homie let me learn you a trick (woo) 
 Black people teach you how to breathe it though 
 Ex Nihilo, something out of nothing you should see it though 
 It's black boy joy, black boy fly (fly) 
 Black girl rock, hit the rock make it cry 
 Hold the staff for Moses can't call it its magic from 10,000 hours 
 And not having it, couple, cup of noodles and hot links 
 A gourmet feast a miracle, nothing short a tree 
 Sprouting out concrete, yeah right out the concrete 
 Yeah y'all beyond weak 
 System kill our prophets and mock our mournful 
 Give us balls and mics and demand we perform for them 
 It's crazy 300 years been trying to say to you 
 Why I gotta explain, it ain't plain to you? (huh?) 
 We never had nothing but nothing was sufficient 
 Kept my belly full of the stuff the rich was missing 
 Y'all could grow a little, your little minds could listen 
 Privilege you protect has made y'all a victim 
 You think you blameless, I know you shamed it 
 Y'all can't even see the pain in our faces 
 You ain't got the frame for the effects of displacement 
 You marvel at the joy that comes from our spaces 
 Even though 
 Even though
