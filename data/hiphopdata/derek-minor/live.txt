Not a day goes by 
 I don't pray with all my life 
 You do more than thrive 
 Please do more than survive 
 Live, live 
 I want you to live 
 Live 
 I want you to live 
 First time I held you in my arms 
 Swore to God I would die 'fore I let somebody hurt you 
 Make life as sweet as I can, but I never will desert you 
 A blessing from God and I don't know if I deserve you 
 I think about your future all the time 
 And I know you'll change the world, you already changed mine 
 Wanna shelter you from my life 
 Make the best men froze 
 May your smile stay warm and heart never cold 
 And if you fall I'll be your parachute 
 That means I tried to help you fly, but gravity's bigger than me and you 
 I apologize in advance 
 I know I let you down, cause dad's still a man 
 I pray through my imperfections you'll see God on the throne 
 'Cause he'll be there to comfort you on that day He call me home 
 You have a purpose, never question why you're here 
 As long as you're alive, you gotta live, you gotta live 
 Not a day goes by 
 I don't pray with all my life 
 You do more than thrive 
 Please do more than survive 
 Live, live 
 I want you to live 
 Live 
 I want you to live 
 Because you only get one life 
 One time to leave your imprint 
 One time to make people around you better, one time to enjoy these minutes, one time to prepare for forever 
 Follow your dreams, don't want you to have regrets 
 Never let people define you, they words'll talk you to death 
 You ever meet the day that you don't feel you measure up 
 Know you're accepted by God, and son, that is enough 
 Smile as much as you can, this world'll throw you some curves 
 Be thankful for what we have, it's more than we deserve 
 Give to people that need it, greed'll tear you apart 
 And it's okay to cry sometimes, that's good for your heart 
 Everybody you love, hold them close 
 Be quick to reconcile, 'cause when they gone, they gone 
 Guess the best way to sum it up is this: 
 It's God first, family after 
 The only way to live 
 Not a day goes by 
 I don't pray with all my life 
 You do more than thrive 
 Please do more than survive 
 Live, live 
 I want you to live 
 Live 
 I want you to live
