Ha, ha, ha, On Beat 
 Cold world most of my kin dead or the pen 
 That's why I'm an Eskimo, I bought an igloo and put on my wrist 
 Ran out of option we gotta survive so we takin' risk 
 Committing sin we gotta live, it is what it is 
 Red dot on your white tee it look like Japan 
 The 40 is on me and if I get hot, it blow like a fan 
 They talk 'bout the hood like they know the answer but never been in 
 Committing sin we gotta live, it is what it is 
 Yeah, yeah, everybody got the answers (answers) 
 They say that they plan is the master (master) 
 They preaching to us like they pastors (amen) 
 Yeah, yeah, the government treat us like cancer (cancer) 
 The prison system make us bastards (bastards) 
 Our sin on the news and it's plastered! 
 We can't even turn to charity, they make money off our tragedy 
 (They get the money) 
 If life a school of hard knock, street will teach you like academy 
 Everybody in they glass house 
 Tell us what we need to do to make it out 
 When they was born on that mountaintop, they ain't seen the bottom, they don't know the route (they don't know the route) 
 You think that we choose this environment? 
 I wish I could choose an entitlement 
 Instead of being born in poverty and hungry hyenas surrounding me 
 The Fortune 500 won't hire me 
 So we create our own economies 
 With dope money, yeah, our salary 
 Just to feed our families 
 I close my eyes and pray that God deliver me 
 Churches move into our hood but they don't come and speak 
 While they gentrify, we risk our life 
 Selling dope, probably die not knowing Christ 
 Cold world most of my kin dead or the pen 
 That's why I'm an Eskimo, I bought an igloo and put on my wrist 
 Ran out of option we gotta survive so we takin' risk 
 Committing sin we gotta live, it is what it is 
 Red dot on your white tee it look like Japan 
 The 40 is on me and if I get hot, it blow like a fan 
 They talk 'bout the hood like they know the answer but never been in 
 Committing sin we gotta live, it is what it is 
 I used to wonder why, we blow our whole tax refund 
 On brand new J's, a Gucci belt, a few gold chains 
 When you can put that change in a IRA 
 You just waiting, by the time that you retire 
 You'll be at the millionaire stage 
 What's the point of saving anything 
 You die, you can't take it with you 
 And that will probably be tonight the way that they shooting, they straight out to hit you 
 I bet you God hear the prayers of millions of mothers 
 And they all sound the same, even though their sons in different gangs 
 And they shooting at each other right now 
 You hear her cries now 
 Now he's a hashtag they debating 'bout it online now 
 That's what I call an abortion 
 And since we talking about abortions 
 We ain't put them clinics in our own hood, somebody making a fortune 
 You talk 'bout these mothers like they out here killing for sport 
 Rather kill they baby in her belly before he get brought in the war 
 You politicize our genocides 
 Then use the victim as an scapegoat 
 But if you care like you say to do 
 You should talk less and do more 
 Cold world most of my kin dead or the pen 
 That's why I'm an Eskimo, I bought an igloo and put on my wrist 
 Ran out of option we gotta survive so we takin' risk 
 Committing sin we gotta live, it is what it is 
 Red dot on your white tee it look like Japan 
 The 40 is on me and if I get hot, it blow like a fan 
 They talk 'bout the hood like they know the answer but never been in
