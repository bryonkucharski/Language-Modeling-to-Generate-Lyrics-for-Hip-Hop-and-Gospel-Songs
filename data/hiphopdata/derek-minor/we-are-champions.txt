Who are the fighters, 
 The conquerors, survivors? 
 Who is victorious, 
 In the glorious King of Kings? 
 You've gotta know we are. 
 We are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Ooh Yeah! 
 I dedicate this to everyone with 116 tatted on their arm 
 If it ain't inked in your flesh I know it's stitched in your heart 
 I see an army right in front of me 
 Black, white and hispanic, imagine 
 It's all happened from rapping 
 Picture that! How God uses foolish things 
 Like ex-weedheads and d-boys 
 To speak on His behalf 
 Can't tell me this ain't the Lord! 
 We are firm because I see Satan on 
 A mission for our soul 
 But Christ told me eat 
 I see food like Pappadeaux 
 Crae' doing fine 
 Tho' people hoping that he stumble' 
 Hard to get kicked off a mountain 
 When you fightin' to stay humble 
 Trip planting churches 
 T-Dot spittin' across the country, 
 KB going on missions, and Andy shapin' the culture 
 Now, some might say I'm braggin, but I'm 
 Just telling you what I see 
 They won't say about themselves so let me speak! 
 See, none of us is perfect and we know 
 But the devil uses that to have us at each others throat 
 So, for the people who disagree 
 Or anyone we hurt 
 Just know our passion's for the body 
 It's the church! 
 And tho' we all in different lanes 
 The focus still the same 
 Show the world there's freedom in Jesus name 
 Yeah! 
 Who are the fighters 
 The conquerors, survivors (Put up your lighters) 
 Who is victorious 
 In the glorious King of Kings? 
 You've gotta know we are. 
 We are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Whoa, sing we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Yeah, get it right! 
 Do me a favor 
 Put your fist in the air 
 So all our opposition 
 Can know that we here 
 You better look em' in the eye 
 And tell em' come if you dare 
 I'm chosen to suffer with Christ 
 This the cross that I bear 
 This ain't a rap thing 
 I never met a band at a show 
 I have brothers and sisters 
 All behind my back whenever I flow 
 Don't want to rap no more 
 I rather let they stories unfold 
 If you don't mind 
 I'll like to let you hear some things that they wrote 
 See how Nathan had leukemia in 2004 
 Mike's motorcycle crashed and almost everything broke 
 Brenda had addictions that she fought with her soul 
 My prayers are the blood of Christ 
 Keep making them whole 
 So, for the girl who like to cut herself 
 I'm hoping you know 
 That God ain't forgot you 
 Your pain's what he want 
 Meaning your overcome is through Alpha, Omega, 
 And one day I know that this will be all behind us 
 Trying already to get my crown ready 
 Hope's the term regardless of what the world tell me 
 If you believe I hope The Lord keep your faith steady 
 I know my champions will rise even though the weight's heavy
