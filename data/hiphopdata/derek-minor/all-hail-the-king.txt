 All rise, all this, all mine 
 All day, all night, all space and all time 
 It's the God who put you online 
 That's alzheimer's, memory corrupted 
 (You offline) 
 Universities go and they plant planets and it outstanding 
 And it's outlandish to be out actin' like you out tracking' 
 You are not running anything, not even jogging 
 Not even trotting, not even walking, He take your breathe away 
 There's no inhaler to help with that asthma be cautious! 
 Created our bodies and painted us colors, is that something you have considered? 
 Well in all of your figuring how did you figure you're more than an action figure? 
 This the presence of greatness, bow to the Lord 
 Not the girl in New Zealand, now only one royal 
 You've met him before 
 Aye this that presidential, creme de la creme 
 That top shelf creme de la creme 
 And you know it 
 All hail the King, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King

 Oh Lord... Good God... OMG 
 Who made them stars? 
 Outer space or Hollywood, which way you wanna go? 
 He made them both, yeah you should know 
 Who are you, to think he needs you to 
 Assist Him in the air, like this an alley oop? 
 Cause see we drop the ball, His love could pick us up 
 His love could save us all, hasn't changed, you ain't never seen Him 
 But seem to think you know what I mean 
 But what I meant to say, is there a single day 
 And every way you look, cause everything He made 
 You couldn't top that, with a top hat, on the top shelf with a ladder 
 That you climbed on, just to get there 
 He's the most high, hands in the air 
 Aye this that presidential, creme de la creme 
 That top shelf creme de la creme 
 And you know it 
 All hail the King, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King 
 Nobigdyl. 
 King of all, watching all his enemies fall 
 Omnipotence is infinite so witness it like kingdom hall 
 I bet you think you're a god, not at all 
 You make it rain, He makes it fall, in galaxies that you never saw 
 And that's royalty and that crown of thorns is worth more than gold 
 And that's loyalty and He bought us back when we sold our souls 
 And I'm mourning me cause the king ordered my death 
 So I put that royal sword in me and I mortified my flesh, turn up 
 Thank God for the murder, thank God for the purpose 
 Think I saw Shadrach and Meshach back in the furnace 
 Thank God we didn't burn up 
 I would have failed, would have been lost in the spell 
 If my God had not of prevailed, but my king trill 
 Because He saved dyl, and also defeated all hell 
 All hail 
 Aye this that presidential, creme de la creme 
 That top shelf creme de la creme 
 And you know it 
 All hail the King, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King 
 All hail the King, ya, all hail the King
