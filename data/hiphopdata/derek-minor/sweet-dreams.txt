I just want to get these dreams out, 
 So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares 
 And if you wanna know what a dream bout' 
 It's that one thing you might get 
 15 years old 
 Sitting in my bedroom 
 Watching my baby sister 
 And praying Mom's will be home soon 
 Burning my arms 
 The pressure hit me like typhoons 
 'Cause I'm the only black kid in my homeroom 
 I felt the power of words that day 
 When I was called coon 
 Sharp as any sword 
 When they cut, it scar you 
 You know the pain when people seem to ignore you 
 I grab the teacher like "I just want to be heard!" 
 I went home, and put it all inside a notebook 
 Poetry is molding me 
 Look, this how hope look 
 My father is in Michigan 
 My step-dad addicted and 
 My mom's out at working all her fingers to the bone 
 And I feel like I'm worthless and hurting beneath the surface 
 It's clear that I am broken Lord, 
 I just need you in my home 
 And that day 
 A dream was born 
 That in 16 bars 
 You can hear my pain in this song. 
 I see some doctors and lawyers 
 With a person to cure cancer 
 And they don't even know it 
 It's a voice in they dreams, it drowned out 
 By the loudmouths 
 Dreamkillers screaming for God to quiet down 
 So if they say that you are nothin' 
 Tell em' thank you 
 'Cause God created this whole universe, that is proof 
 Meaning, we're expressions of the greatest artist 
 Brushstrokes of The King's speech, greatest masterpiece 
 So why you let em' take your purpose? (Huh?) 
 (It's the dream that he gave you) 
 Why you believin' that you worthless? (Huh?) 
 (It's a reason why he made you) 
 Fly higher, inspire, 
 You were wired to be The Lord's greatness 
 Naysayers are liars 
 And this what He designed me to do 
 I'm living my dream 
 You better live yours too. 
 Now, all my dreamers say... 
 Don't let em' ever take your dream away 
 (Ooh) 
 Now, all my dreamers say... 
 Don't let em' ever take your dream away 
 (Ooh) 
 They can never take your dream away
