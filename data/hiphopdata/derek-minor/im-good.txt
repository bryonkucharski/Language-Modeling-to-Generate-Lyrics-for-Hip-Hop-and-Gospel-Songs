 I don't fit into you're in-crowd 
 I gotta be who I am now 
 I don't got no chains on me now 
 No I don't fit into you're in-crowd 
 Long as we living I'm good 
 Breath in my lungs so I'm good 
 God is with us so I'm good 
 I'm good 
 I'm good 
 Yeah 
 I was born in yak town 
 South side next to a crack house 
 Call the cops and you get shot down 
 Thanking God for where I'm at now 
 I don't chase fame I don't need the problems 
 A million dollars cause a million problems 
 B.I.G. made millions, Pac main millions 
 Both died violent we ain't caught the villains (we ain't caught 'em yet) 
 Oh yeah I see it clear, man (e) 
 Ever since my dad died I ain't been the same 
 I pray to God that he rose and didn't see the flame 
 You know what them types of thoughts'll do to your brain? 
 Every day above ground is a great one 
 Even if the pressure weigh tons, it won't break us 
 Another day made 
 And that is inspiration 
 I can't let you bloodsuckers drain my motivation, yessir 
 I don't fit into you're in-crowd 
 I gotta be who I am now 
 I don't got no chains on me now 
 No I don't fit into you're in-crowd 
 Long as we living I'm good 
 Breath in my lungs so I'm good 
 God is with us so I'm good 
 I'm good 
 I'm good 
 Yeah

 If you have came along way and you still good 
 Get your hands high, hands high 
 You got a ways to go but you still good 
 Get your hands high, hands high 
 They can talk all they want but you still good 
 Get your hands high, hands high 
 We done been through it all and the Lord never left us like we reaching up to heaven 
 Get your hands high

 Tryna give the people something they can believe in 
 This is soul food, go ahead sink your teeth in 
 Some people wanna live but they don't think it's a reason 
 Gotta cold heart, but they know where the heat is 
 And I do' been on the bottom, and I feel what you feel 
 See the pain in your eyes, I can tell that it's real 
 Gotta survive every day is another day 
 Just know that you are not alone, don't let your heart turn to stone 
 This what do you gon' do, every time you feel that way 
 Put this record on, let the melody take you away 
 To a place where you can drown them haters out with laughter 
 Watch your pain float away when flooded with disaster 
 I know that it's a fight 
 I wrote this song for us, we gon' be alright 
 I know who writing our story, it's a beautiful ending 
 So I trust in his word, even with humble beginnings 
 I'm - good

 I'm good, good
