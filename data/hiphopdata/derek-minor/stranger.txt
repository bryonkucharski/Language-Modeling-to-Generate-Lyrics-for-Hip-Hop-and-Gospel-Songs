Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Come on Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lake Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Ride with me down this lake 
 Stand with here for a moment 
 See if you can bear my pain 
 Walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Ride with me down this lake 
 Stand with me here for a moment 
 See if you can bear my pain 
 Ok, Black on black Crime, Black on black violence 
 We don't talk to police 
 That's black on black silence 
 Living in Hell here we are just living on welfare 
 When everybody is broke, you feel for your welfare 
 Ah! Look at them thugs, how dangerous they are with gun in hand 
 Look at them ghetto girls twerking on that instagram 
 Don't bring them to our church 'cause we don't want that Riff Raff 
 What do you expect when most of us grew up wishing for dads 
 Go tossing on Community, people losing hope 
 Why you think he on that corner selling dope? 
 And now accord it's a plan, We were chained on that boat 
 See America left our right we still hanging from the rope 
 And I promise 
 Wanna leave it in the past, but it's hard 
 'Cause I just seen an unarmed teen shot down like a dog 
 I just pray you hear my heart 
 'Cause it's heavy and unrifing 
 See the reason for this song, is that I'm aching 
 Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Come, Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lake Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Ride with me down this lake 
 Stand with here for a moment 
 See if you can bear my pain 
 Walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Ride with me down this lake 
 Stand with me here for a moment 
 See if you can bear my pain 
 Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed 
 And I'm wondering, Do you know my Pain 
 Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed 
 And I'm wondering, Do you ever know my Pain 
 And I'm convinced that we should love one another 
 Regardless of our opinion, we all bleed the same color 
 We're made in the image of God and no other 
 It's clear the world is hurt but I could tell you Daddy love us (love us) 
 So even if you hate me, Imma Love you 
 Imma heal your heart and tell the Lord take this pain from you 
 Imma Pray for you, Imma feel your struggle 
 You gonna feel mine 
 Imma Walk with You, I walk with you 
 Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Come, Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lake Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute 
 Oh I'm hurting!
