Ricky Ross crossed the highway with that dope on him 
 With that dope on him 
 Now them young d boys hit the block with that hope on em 
 With that hope on em 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Who gave the real Rick Ross coke? 
 To spread it 'from coast to coast 
 I know, but if I said it y'all would kill me 
 Just google Gary Webb if you feel me 
 Ain't gone spell it out all the time use your mind 
 How they brand kids as slaves 
 Get dope 'cross ocean tides 
 Or borderlines or county lines 
 I'm stuck 
 Now black men are mascots for hell on earth 
 Tookie started the Crips and told us own your turf 
 So now we shoot in the gym or the block for survival 
 But either way we blue devils 
 My cousins went to jail for sellin' weed 
 Now in Colorado you get green leaf with green tea 
 At first pumpkin spice latte's were her addiction 
 Now she throw them yoga pants and Ugg's on to smoke in Denver 
 Ricky Ross crossed the highway with that dope on him 
 With that dope on him 
 Now them young d boys hit the block with that hope on em 
 With that hope on em 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Black market 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 Somebody asked why I ain't got a deal 
 Okay, I'm 'bout to keep it too real 
 I'm too black for some people taste 
 They can't serve that to their base 
 And others think I'm way too safe 
 'Cause I don't brag about what I got in my safe 
 Or xanny'd out my mind, in a life of crime 
 And I ain't never live but it works on Spotify 
 You ain't selling a character 
 Me, I won't be Carlton Banks to make you feel peace 
 Or generic street 
 You can exploit 
 If you ain't get the iMessage yeah this the text boy 
 I'm the reason Christ died and Martin was martianed 
 Speak the real truth to the ones in the margins 
 So they can dodge the lie from the snake in the garden 
 And I tell it in the church and NY at the Garden
