Gimme 16, I'll show you what to do 
 Try and eat a beet like Dwight Schrute 
 Go ape if you feelin' right 
 Let the beat stop the cage, it's the life implied 
 Boy, pay attention when you hear me 
 My lyrics like a petting zoo, I'm hoping that you feel me 
 I shock 'em all like Pikachu when I come in the building 
 I'm the only rapper not spinning hits, the pencil Da Vinci 
 What's your Van She? Sheesh, what's the big deal? 
 Some people out here chasing toys, it's a Kid's Meal 
 You go in circles for the power, that's a windmill 
 But you can win it all and not know how a win feel 
 Ughh ... don't listen to me though 
 I'm partially broke and got a problem with my ego 
 I'm probably hating on you in front of all of these people 
 They don't care what the verse say, the hook is what they fiend for 
 There's people out here dancing, they don't hear me though (deaf) 
 They just want the beat to tell them where to go (deaf) 
 So every time I grip the microphone 
 It don't matter, I just say what I want 
 'Cause they just swear they gone deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf 
 Deaf, deaf, deaf 
 They swear they gone deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf 
 Deaf, deaf, deaf 
 They just swear they gone deaf 
 Got beef, put me on to the cully flow 
 With the beans on the beach with a calico 
 I see girls that they're probably tryna take home 
 If they the Jordans in the box, it's a safe so ... 
 Get it? Probably not 
 But the beat hot, so let's rock 
 Say what I want, or what you say that I won't 
 As long as Jesus on the throne, I ain't worried about a fold 
 Librarian flow, in other words, keep me low 
 And Jesus paid my debt, I ain't worried 'bout what I owe 
 I said Jesus twice, that's for your checklist 
 "Well that's three times" ... check this 
 Some people sound deep, try and show them proof 
 Find out they're shallow as a kiddie pool 
 But it don't matter what I think, I'm just another dude 
 That made a song for you to go deaf to 
 I know what you came here for 
 I ain't 'bout to make you wait no more 
 The only reason that we at this show 
 So you can hear your favorite song 
 And then go ... 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap 
 And then go ... 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap 
 I know what you came here for

 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap 
 Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
