 See I've been in the game for a minute 
 It's been a crazy ride 
 No matter where I go 
 One thing we all have in common is 
 We all have crazy pains and crazy hurts 
 And every time I want to give up, I can see it in their faces 
 And I start thinking, "I can't give up! 
 Can't give up." 
 BJ the Chicago Kid 
 I've been in so many places 
 And I see pain all on my people faces 
 So I'mma tell 'em about Your love until I'm gone now 
 Until I'm gone now 
 And I got a whole lotta livin' I'mma do 
 Now, I'm finally winning and I owe it all to You 
 That's why I'mma give it all I got until I'm gone now 
 Until I'm gone now

 I came up from the bottom 
 I came up from the bottom 
 And I ain't even supposed to be here if it was up to y'all 
 And I think God had different plans for me 
 Different plans for me, oh yeah 
 I gave Him all of my problems 
 Yeah, I gave Him all of my problems 
 He told me if I trust Him, I'm His son, and don't worry about nothin', don't worry about nothin' 
 This for my people that struggle to pay off they light bill 
 In they heart man, they wonder if Christ real 
 Or the next meal 
 I can tell you how that life feel 
 Political pawns in the hands of the people that make all the laws 
 They set up the game, so we only ones losing 
 Don't act so appalled 
 And we failed 
 We been held in these chains long enough 
 I rebel what they sell 
 Let this light shine in us 
 I'm trying to show the world what I've seen 
 He can turn clay to a king 
 Do you even know what that means? 
 Do you even know who you supposed to be 
 Well let me tell you?

 'Cause I don't know how to fix this 
 I'm just trying to survive the tempest 
 I'm just trying to pray God will hear this 
 I feel like they got us on their hit list 
 I've been on a mission 
 Impossible, Tom Cruise flew in the old school 
 Think of how some kids only eat in the lunch room 
 And they wonder why they fight in their home rooms 
 How can you focus, when hunger is potent 
 There is lead in the water of poor 
 But you wouldn't notice 
 Your head is so far up in the clouds on a very high horse 
 We at war with ourselves 
 While at war with each other 
 Just know I'll never give up on you 
 All of my sisters and brothers 
 Oh don't you worry now 
 This ain't the end of the story now 
 No matter what comes or what go, we gonna hold you 
 The truth that we hold, we gonna hold it down, yeah 
 This is that motivation unadulterated 
 This for the people that say when they felt like giving up 
 We gon' make it 
 Hit the shot at the buzzard, it's still a win 
 What I'm saying is as long as you still alive, better try again 
 What I'm saying, the morning is coming 
 Time to rise and shine again 
 Time to get back on the grind again 
 For everybody that be getting up 
 Let me see your hands high again 
 Let 'em know

 Gone now 
 Gone now 
 I'll give You what You deserve 
 That's all I need
