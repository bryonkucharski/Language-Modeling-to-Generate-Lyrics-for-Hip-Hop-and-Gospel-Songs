(Verse 1 - Derek Minor) 
 Welcome to the world where them young boys sell crack 
 You play with they money, mess around and get your head cracked 
 Tryna make cheese just to trap the local hood rats 
 Four baby mamas, child support, he ain't payin' that 
 Welcome to the world where some preachers is wolves 
 Some sleep with their members and some teachers is fools 
 But I know plenty deacons that practice what they preachin' 
 And you don't know their names, but in their city they a beacon 
 Aye, welcome to the world where liars is part of tensions 
 You free to be whatever as long as you ain't a Christian 
 Don't say what you believe, best for you to swallow it 
 And if you do, that's SO INTOLERANT 
 Welcome to the world where they send dopeboys off to rot 
 But Bernie Madoff, prisoner like the spot 
 If you swindle people for millions, take everything they got 
 They should throw you under the jail and give the key to God 
 (Hook - Tony Tillman) 
 Welcome to the jungle, the mighty mighty jungle 
 Where Adam lost his garden when he satisfied his hunger 
 And now the lions roam, pumpin' fear into the villas 
 So keep your hand in the winder and please don't feed the gorillas 
 (Verse 2 - Tony Tillman) 
 This world is full of Trayvon Martin's and Sean Bell's 
 Blood cried from the ground with the story their son tell 
 Painted history tainted, and riddled with drug sales 
 Come get acquainted with corners that's covered in gun shells 
 Gs posted with toasters, the poster children for drama 
 Degenerate generation, they'll clap a shell at your mama, bro 
 Before I rack them numbers, will leave me completely comatose 
 Some burners, sack, or stick it and icky rollin' like 100 spokes 
 Welcome to the world, I see death in various places 
 White supremists lay back with attack and spitting their hatred 
 KKK in them sheets, the police are crooked and racist 
 People turning to servers and hit the street eating faces, bro 
 Welcome to the world where saints abandon the body 
 They callin' preachers the king and gang is considered godly 
 Get richer is the motto, they fallin' victim to folly 
 Greed is gripping their brain, but we blame the illuminati 
 Lucifer tryna snatch somebody 
 To survive you gotta die, homie catch a body 
 I lift my eyes up to the sky, inside I hate this 
 Not of this world, can't wait for God to send a spaceship 
 For now, welcome to the world ...
