Woke up this morning, kissed my wifey, then hopped outta bed 
 About to go ball, I got these shorts and lotion on my legs 
 Walked right in the gym, "I'ma pick you, him, and him" 
 Tryna get a triple-double like you, jumper on, I'm killin' them 
 After the game was over, somebody in a wheelchair rolled up 
 I ain't recognize him at first, he came closer, I'm like "hold up" 
 Can't be, wait that's my dawg "I ain't seen you in a long time" 
 He said, "I hear you blowin' up, but I'm glad to see you still on your grind" 
 I was like, "what happened?" I remember us hoopin' back in the day 
 He said, "I almost forgot, you ain't even seen me since the tenth grade 
 Well long story short, it was Prom Night, I was in my Chevy 
 Drunk driver ran the red light, hit me, it shoulda been deadly 
 I survived, to a wheelchair I'm confined 
 Lost my legs, I survived, still got life, I'ma thrive" 
 That had me rocked, I ain't even had nothin' else to say 
 Looked right at me man ... 
 Then he said ... 
 "One day it'll change 
 Things won't be the same 
 They say I'm crazy, but I'm sane 
 Next time, I'ma fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky) 
 Fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky) 
 Fly right past the sky" 
 Pain excruciating 
 Wrinkled skin, arthritis, but yet she's still amazing 
 Her grandson kissed her on the cheek, "what's up, Big Momma?" 
 She gripped his hand, cracked a smile and asked, "Where yo momma? 
 Tubes all in her nose, IV, hospital clothes 
 I don't think she got long, in the bed tryna hold her own 
 He said "she comin'," "Ok, have a seat, I wanna talk to you 
 I know you up in these streets, and just dropped outta school 
 Yo pops gone, you in my home, and I ain't raised no dummies 
 I got spat on, dog sic-ed on, hit winter holes for you buddy 
 He said "I know," she said "I don't think you do 
 'Cause if you did you wouldn't waste your life out here, you ain't got no clue 
 This cancer has spread, already know where I'm headed 
 I served the Lord, he gave me joy, and I hope one day that you get it" 
 He put his head down ... "Boy, get yo head up 
 I'm finally free, don't cry for me ..." 
 Then he said ... 
 "One day it'll change 
 Things won't be the same 
 They say I'm crazy, but I'm sane 
 Next time, I'ma fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky) 
 Fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky) 
 Fly right past the sky"
