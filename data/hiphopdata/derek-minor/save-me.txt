 I ain't got no metaphors, no similes 
 To explain to y'all what I've been through 
 Just real talk, just real me 
 You can see the scars I've lived through 
 I heard it through the grape vine 
 They say I'm done like cooked food 
 But that body's still in the oven 
 No clue what the chef is up to, yeah 
 All I know is they said that my pops O.D.'d 
 He ain't had no insurance 
 So that burden of buryin' fallen on me 
 God I need some endurance 
 I feel like You up in the sky and You torturin' me 
 Even though that that's foolish 
 You see all the pain that I feel like You pour it on me 
 I just hope I don't lose it 
 'Cause I'm tired of buryin' my relatives 
 Tired of feelin' I'm failin' at everything 
 Cause sometimes it feel like You take away everything 
 It feel like You've gotta be mad at me 
 Are You mad at me? Do You hate me? 
 Are these tribulations just to break me? 
 Man, this can't be the reason You made me 
 I'm goin' crazy, won't You save me? 
 J.Paul 
 I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes 
 You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground 
 To the ground 
 And I don't know what You're doin' 
 But I'll be right here until You save me 
 Save me, hey won't You save me? 
 I need You now, I need You now 
 To just save me, save me 
 Hey won't You save me? 
 You can take it all, You can take it all 
 But just save me 
 Derek Minor 
 It's like everything around me is crumbling 
 I feel like I'm losing my mind 
 Where are You God? Where are You? 
 The devil is whisperin' up in my head 
 End it all, end it all, yeah end it all 
 He's sayin' the Lord He don't want me to win 
 Not at all, not at all, not at all 
 See in one whole year 
 Lost my sister, lost my aunt, lost my dad 
 Wife got in a wreck, fractured her spine 
 Feel like evil is circlin' all that I have 
 Some people mishandle my business 
 It won't happen again 
 That money entrusted was took from me 
 But most importantly lost one of my friends 
 I could care less about all of this music 
 These numbers, opinions, and all of this fame 
 Just wanna be who God called me to be 
 And take care of (?) all in the same 
 I bend on my knees with these tears in my eyes 
 And my hands to the sky, I'm prayin' for change 
 Put me in fire, take all that I have 
 To the end of my days I'm not cursin' Your name 
 You're all that I have and You gave up Your Son 
 That is enough 
 It's all in Your hands and this weight is too much 
 I have faith in Your love 
 So as long as I'm alive, long as I'm alive 
 I'll trust You forever, forever 
 My faith will never die, faith will never die 
 For worse or for better 
 I know You can save me 
 J.Paul 
 I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes 
 You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground 
 To the ground 
 And I don't know what You're doin' 
 But I'll be right here until You save me 
 Save me, hey won't You save me? 
 I need You now, I need You now 
 To just save me, save me 
 Hey won't You save me? 
 You can take it all, You can take it all 
 But just save me 
 Save me, save me 
 Hey won't You save me? Save me 
 Save me, save me 
 Hey won't You save me? Save me
