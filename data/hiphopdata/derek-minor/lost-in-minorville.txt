 There's a place where life is everything you dreamed it would be. 
 There are no problems, or conflict. 
 And you're always right... 
 Even when you're wrong. 
 Racism, and classism, don't exist. 
 And birds never poop on your car... 
 Even after you've washed it. 
 Yes, I know this place, 
 It's called... 
 Minorville 
 I woke up in a new Bugatti, 
 (Turn up!) 
 Or Honda Accord... 
 I can't tell the difference. 
 And everybody loved all my opinions, 
 I did everything right, 
 'Cause that's what it means to be Christian. 
 Drove 60 in a 45, 
 The cops ain't even trip. 
 Guess Obama just cleared my Illuminati membership. 
 Got mistaken for a doctor, 
 Instead of a ball player. 
 And the Pistons drafted Carmelo... 
 We winnin' it all playa! 
 No political parties, 
 The government's fair, right. 
 It's ILLEGAL for father's not to be in they kids life. 
 Marriage is a habit, 
 Women are not objectified. 
 And rappers tell the TRUTH in they songs instead of lies. 
 This is a place where there's no black or white churches, 
 Color could NEVER divide us... 
 We love each other perfect. 
 I hope you find what you lookin' for in our city now, 
 Hey this is Minorville, 
 Come and take a look around! 
 Uh huh, oh yeah yeah, 
 Come on 
 Come take a walk with me. 
 I'll show you the other side...
