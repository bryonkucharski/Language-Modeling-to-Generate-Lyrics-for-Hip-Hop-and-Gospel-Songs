Party People 
 Lose Your Mind 
 We gon Party All Night 
 Hey Marty! 
 This is my Social Club ad lib 
 Supposed to say something random and funny right here 
 Derek Minor 
 You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night 
 I stage dive off the top rope like Macho Man 
 If I hit your mama with an elbow then I'm sorry fam 
 Y'all better know it 
 Misfits and Minor are lions and tigers 
 In other words, animals, animals, animals 
 We all going crazy I think you should try now (you, you, you) 
 Hands to the sky like I'm flapping the Giant 
 Controlling the crowd like ventriloquist 
 Many resurrecting if you not feeling this 
 Party just beginning we are not ending it 
 People say I'm crazy, I'm not feeling it now 
 Lose your mind 
 We gon Party All Night 
 You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night! 
 MartyMar 
 Agh! Oh no they back again 
 Hoppin out of Minivans 
 With couple of their friends 
 Still rocking Hammer pants 
 I could do that Hammer dance 
 Just gimme room though 
 I'm singing this Spanish 
 Girls they think I'm in Menudo 
 I'm drinking Martin in the back and my shirt is mustard 
 Politicking on the patio my shirt up button 
 I tell that people about Jesus over tea and crumpets 
 We too busy having fun and you busy doing nothing 
 Lose your mind 
 We gon Party All Night 
 You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night!

 What the problem is y'all try to play us like Optimus 
 When we currently in our prime like Optimus 
 Promoters hit the email like lock us in 
 We're booked to next year that's a lot of gigs 
 And a couple of them with Derek and his rapper friends 
 Canon, B-Coop and not to mention them 
 But not many other artists that I recommend 
 Lately I been thinking it was dirty for the culture 
 Chilling me and stash money dancing in the corner 
 Twerking out work it out baby feeding over donor 
 Instagram fill got you feeling like a baller 
 I do things more stiffer than most you 
 My raps like a slam dunk tryna post you 
 Verse like this make this like you supposed to do 
 Now party all night like we told you to 
 Lose your mind 
 We gon Party All Night 
 You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night!
