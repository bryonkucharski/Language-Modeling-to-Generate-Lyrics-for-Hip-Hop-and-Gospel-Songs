(Derek Minor) 
 I met the Father and the Son, he told me the summer's mine 
 He said "mi casa es su casa", boy you gon' be just fine 
 I ain't ever get that Benz that I used to rap about 
 And my son going through pampers like they going outta style 
 I'm good, I'm gucci 'cause Tedashii hit me up 
 He said him and his family cool and I think that that's enough 
 I make a toast to the haters, why you wanna hate us 
 'Cause all I want to do is serve the Lord and make a banger 
 You sittin' on mils, I'm only sittin' on bills 
 And gas prices ain't going down in the 'ville 
 But hey, what can I say, it's a pretty day 
 I buy a honey bun and throw about ten in the tank 
 Bend some corners in the whip, wipe the crumbs off my lips 
 And I'm riding around town to see how far I can get 
 I ain't got everything, but that's ok with me 
 'Cause bro something in my heart say this is where I'm supposed to be 
 (Derek Minor and Laura Reed) 
 I ain't wearin' platinum yet, but my momma think I made it 
 Everything the Lord gave me I can share with my homies 
 So I'm feeling good feeling great 
 Yeah, I'm feeling good feeling great 
 I'll turn down a milli if you won't let me raise my babies 
 I don't think money is everything, you can call me crazy 
 But I'm feeling good feeling great 
 Yeah, I'm feeling good feeling great 
 (Derek Minor) 
 I'm straight, I'm good 
 Ain't got no twenties but ridin' in my hood 
 I told my granny before she died I will survive 
 And I won't make all good decisions but at least I'm gon' try 
 She said just leave it in the hands of God 
 And times is hard, stack some paper, try to leave it to the side, I said all right 
 This for all y'all that ain't figured it out yet 
 But you cool with letting the Lord pilot life's jet 
 We going past the sky even if they pass us by 
 And the wise think we blind, can't see past the lie 
 Well, I'll be a fool till the Lord call 
 'Cause the know-it-alls, I don't think they know at all 
 I meet in town with Marco, he telling me his dreams 
 We both barely broke and wouldn't trade it for a thing 
 'Cause we know when it's over, there'll be much more 
 But the question is, what's your life for?

 But I'm feeling good feeling great 
 Yeah, I'm feeling good feeling great 
 (Chad Jones) 
 "Hey how you doin', Jones?" Man, nothing to complain about 
 Just the average day where I can say that I made it out 
 A black man with a good job and a fine spouse 
 Couple genius kids, I'm fortunate to have a nice house 
 I didn't climb out the crab bucket 
 Where if they find out you grind out, they sit you down like timeout 
 I'm an anomaly, rare, and a sight to see 
 I'm passed jail to get to Tennessee, but no monopoly 
 Honestly no credit to me being one hundred 
 My goal was to play the feeling, surely I woulda blunt it 
 Surely I was a buster, I ain't exaggerating 
 You might think that I'm joshing but I wouldn't have gave you anything 
 Stingy and lazy, only God could have changed Chad 
 Feeling better now 'cause I ain't carrying the same tag 
 Earth is not my home, and God he made my day good 
 I was like used plastic spoons, I woulda stayed hood

 So good, yeah ...
