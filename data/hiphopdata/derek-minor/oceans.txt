 Now I've been waiting for a long, I mean waiting for a long time 
 For a new day to come 
 A new sun to shine 'cause so far it's cold nights 
 They always saying it's the wrong time 
 Why you saying it's the wrong time? 
 To say bye bye to rain and hello to change 
 I'm ready for the summer time 
 Sorta like Chappelle Show I want a new season good times, bad times feelings uneven 
 Staring out a window day-dreaming, matter of fact I'm leaving, headed for the ocean 
 Move Aside 
 Ocean waves, come and take me away 
 Ocean's breeze, pull me farther to sea 
 Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin 
 Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin

 I'm going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, you had to see that coming 
 The son of man said he would carry all my burdens and that's the truth and I ain't worrying 'bout nothing 
 And you know I packed all my bags now, leaving worries behind now 
 Headed to life, there's no room on this ride now 
 I'm alive now and all I've got is your love on my mind now 
 I can feel it in my soul that it's a new season I need it, I could give ya 99 reasons 
 Staring out a window day-dreaming, I'm leaving, I'm leaving 
 Move Aside 
 Ocean waves, come and take me away 
 Ocean's breeze, pull me farther to sea 
 Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin 
 Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin (2x)
