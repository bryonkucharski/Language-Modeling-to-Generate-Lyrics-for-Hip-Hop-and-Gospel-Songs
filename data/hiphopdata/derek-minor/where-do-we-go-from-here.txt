(Verse 1 - Derek Minor) 
 Staring at my wife, papers on the table 
 "You must be out your dang mind, I ain't signin' that!" 
 How can I watch my love go out the door, be up for grabs? 
 Seems like my better half wanna leave with half 
 What happened? It wasn't long ago 
 I was feelin' you in my life was what I'm longin' for 
 It can't be over, I ain't buyin' what you sellin' 
 And I know we argue, girl I feel like you, I'm tired of yellin' 
 Too, what they gon' think at this church that we in? 
 And ain't no way I'm lettin' no other man raise my kids 
 What's some doctor gon' tell me about my own life? 
 We don't need counsel; we can do it on our own, right? 
 (Chorus - ZG) 
 When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out? 
 Where do we go from here? 
 And everything is broken now, it seems the sky is falling down 
 Where do we go from here? 
 (Verse 2 - Derek Minor) 
 Afraid to be exposed 
 I'm wide open, filet, that knife was sharp 
 We hit our knees for a long time 
 Now they see it all, dark parts including our heart 
 God, I hope that you not out of practice 
 They say you a surgeon, any room inside your practice? 
 This car crash that we call a marriage injured us 
 Tried to tend our own wounds, it's killing us 
 Thought if we just tried harder ... read books, get a little smarter 
 Things will be better again 
 But our problem is a problem you can't think or wish it away 
 One hope to solve it 
 These words I hope you heed 
 On your own you're destined to fail, that's a guarantee 
 You don't wanna be me at this table 
 One decision from making us together a fable 
 (Chorus - ZG) 
 When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out? 
 Where do we go from here? 
 And everything is broken now, it seems the sky is falling down 
 Where do we go from here? 
 When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out? 
 Where do we go from here?
