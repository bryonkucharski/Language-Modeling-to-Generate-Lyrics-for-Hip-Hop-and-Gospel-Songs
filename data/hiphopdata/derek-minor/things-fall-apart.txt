What am I to do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls apart 
 What am I to do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls part 
 That's when I call on you, call on you 
 That's when I call on you, I call on you 
 That's when I call on you 
 That's when I call on you 
 I've been broken and thrown away 
 Lost in regret without a trace 
 Come find me now 
 Yeah, come find me now 
 When did the storm arose at the joy, my heart 
 I'm longing for you 
 I'm longing for you 
 I endure the weather now 
 Your love is my tether now 
 Hold me together now 
 This pain won't last forever now 
 Making me whole 
 When agony is smooth as a criminal 
 Yes, you arrested my soul 
 Bringing me home, bringing me home 
 Bringing me closer to you 
 Bringing me closer to truth 
 Bringing me closer to see who I really am 
 Nothing to prove 
 Things fall apart, things fall apart 
 My faith in you, you are the glue 
 That's who you are 
 What am I to do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls apart 
 What am I do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls apart 
 That's when I call on you, call on you 
 That's when I call on you, I call on you 
 That's when I call on you 
 That's when I call on you 
 Now I need your light 
 'Cause I've been in a dark place 
 Sometimes I wear a mask 
 Because I'm just trying to save face 
 I've been through hell 
 The flames have froze my heart 
 Fragments from shattered dreams tear me apart 
 That's when I can't swim 
 I'm thinking about my mistakes 
 That's when you flood in 
 And then I'm swept away (by your love) 
 I'm reminded I'm not alone 
 Reminded I got a home 
 I'm reminded I don't have to worry 
 As long as you're on the throne 
 I believe it 
 What am I to do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls apart 
 What am I do 
 When I've tried it all 
 And everything just falls apart 
 It just falls apart 
 That's when I call on you, call on you 
 That's when I call on you, I call on you 
 That's when I call on you 
 That's when I call on you
