You up in your cubicle 
 Worked 7 hours got 1 to go 
 Dinner waitin' for you at home 
 But you gotta finish this project though 
 It's almost time to get off, 
 So you take it up to your boss 
 All your co-workers impressed 
 But he don't like it at all 
 So, you gonna have to stay late (what?) 
 You gonna have to stay late (dang!) 
 Gary get on your nerves, 
 He always findin' ways to hate 
 But what you don't know is he insecure 
 And he always fail himself, plus 
 Life smashed his dreams, so he crush everyone else 
 And that's the way that it is, 
 Even though it ain't right 
 'Cause he might of bought those problems 
 But you payin' the price 
 Move around and 'round like a tornado that... 
 Tearin' everything down, 
 Trying to blow us all away 
 You so full of hot air, and that's on my momma 
 I'mma put it in a balloon and float over all that drama 
 I see stars shining bright below my feet 
 You can't bring me down, no you can't, you can't bring me down 
 So just keep giving me everything I need 
 You can't bring me down, no you can't, you can't bring me down 
 I'm floatin' so high, you can't bring me down [repeats] 
 Ok now I'm off in this studio 
 Puttin' finishin' touches on all these songs 
 I'll probably shoot a video 
 Unless of course my album budget is all gone 
 I turn it in to my label, everybody like "whoo" 
 All these fans say that they love it, bought two copies off of Itunes 
 Then I get a mention on my timeline, with some random blogger review 
 Said the whole album is garbage, he hate everything that I do 
 Well what I ain't know is he insecure, 'cause he used to rap himself till, 
 Life smashed his dreams, now he crush everyone else 
 And that's the way that is, even though it ain't right 
 He might of bought those problems, but we payin' the price
