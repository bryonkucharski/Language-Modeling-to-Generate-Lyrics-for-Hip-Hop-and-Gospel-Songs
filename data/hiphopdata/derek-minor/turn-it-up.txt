I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles ... 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 My music loud 
 You can't shut us down 
 I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles 
 Yeah, turn up this music, I bet the streets will follow 
 Remove the dome off of that whip, I call it sleeping hollow 
 My subs beatin', the boys speakin' this Country Grammar 
 I met this Jewish carpenter and now I'm goin' hammer 
 Bump me inside your hood like Trayvon Martin rallies 
 Hopin' if the church get involved, it won't ever happen 
 Again, you see this vision boy I'm on a mission 
 They smoke in Memphis, I don't mean barbecue competitions 
 Yeah, repot lemme get it back 
 Prayer, tell me are you really feelin' that? 
 I'ma try to make it hotter than the summer like Alex Trebek then jump in these so I'ma give 'em facts 
 My dawgs off in the streets, and yes they facin' giants 
 They got these rocks in they pockets, but they ain't met Goliath 
 They chasin' bread, but never get a chance to bite it 
 So I put my soul food in these speakers, go'n and amplify it 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 My music loud 
 You can't shut us down 
 I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles 
 Yeah I keep it real so they feel it, talk about I lived it 
 2 Chainz round my neck, I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it 
 Got a couple tats on my arm, 116 tat on my soul 
 And my folks out on the same thing, it's Jesus till we gone 
 That's for my gatos on the west coast where they wearing flags 
 But they ain't playing football and that bullet ain't a pass 
 Aye, why his pants sag or what's his pistol doing there? 
 Y'all worried about his dreads, I'm praying this: we ain't gon' get pushed back 
 PRo the Mouth of the South and I'm calling out believers 
 Lord have mercy, my folks is thirsty and we Aquafina 
 He posted with his Nina till he get put on TV 
 First 48, he singin' like Anita Baker 
 One day we all gon' have to meet our Maker 
 I pray that he's your friend 'cause if it's beef, that's angus steak bruh 
 And he'll set that on fire just like Flambe 
 But I'm all this buffet, so before we pray ... 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 My music loud 
 You can't shut us down 
 I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles
