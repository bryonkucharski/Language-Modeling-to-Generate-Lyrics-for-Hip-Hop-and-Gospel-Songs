Lookin' outta my window, I see a block full of kinfolk 
 On the porch with a 40, full of that endo 
 The shawty clutching her son, he got a afro 
 And daddy nowhere around, where did the man go? 
 It's stacked up on the block, yeah, Legos 
 Feel like it's cheap but it's good, yeah, Faygo 
 It's like I'm dead but I ain't, am I a ghost bro? 
 Feel like two parts of me damned, am I a schizo? 
 And part of me happy, the other half is greed 
 'Cause I'm doing all these shows but I'm still feeling this need 
 I talk about how much different the world could be 
 But still I sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Still I sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Still sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Might be a little too comfortable ... man, I better get up! 
 Cousin front of this flat screen, I see crushed dreams 
 Channel 2 News, I see a couple me's 
 I see a couple you's, I see a couple Gs 
 I see some VLs sent to the F-e-d's 
 Federal Pen if you didn't know 
 They would come hard trying not to be broke 
 That's a reality, so many ghetto casualties 
 Make me think, "Lord, why'd you send your love after me?" 
 I can't afford to be stuck up 
 Just saw a stuck-up couple getting stuck up 
 See the person who robbed 'em, saw him a-come up 
 Thought he played that lotto till his luck sucked 
 And it was, he want whips and chains 
 The cops came, then we got whipped and chained 
 My heart broke for the hood, so I just sit and pray 
 'Cause I know Christ gave his blood and it ain't in vain 
 I'm happy but I'm grieved 
 'Cause I'm doing all these shows but I still feel the need 
 I talk about how much different the world could be 
 But still I sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Still I sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Still sit on this throne like I'm a king 
 Might be a little too comfortable ... man, I better get up!
