Candy crush flow unlocked a new level 
 And I am burying beats, I got a new shovel 
 You trying to win this rat race but get no medals 
 My only competitions Minor, but the battle's large 
 So either way I know I still won 
 Still bragging on the father like a proud son 
 That's the only solution to fix where I'm from 
 Drunk off violence and they taking shots of red rum 
 That ghetto life, like rick james 
 My beats sound like what the five fingers say to the face slap 
 They like, why you so aggressive, I guess it's 
 That's Michigan in me, that country Tennessee in me 
 But I am ok for your pupils, I'll just open up their pupils 
 Two things that's very crucial, I'm safe I'm not unusual 
 That's my, I'm not a scary black guy tone 
 I'm in my zone, let's get it on, I'm bout to kick it off like judo 
 Judo 
 I'm bout to kick it off like Judo 
 Judo 
 I reflect God and his greatness 
 And I'm going harder than the pavement 
 Still underground like a basement 
 This year all my dogs going crazy 
 Create in the image of the great one, so you could never make 
 I make 'em get another appraisal when if they underestimate us 
 Let's go ahead and get it crack a lackin. hit the booth I'm like a yellow jacket 
 Spit ammunition when I get to snapping, like a yopper yopper, Get to yaking, yaking 
 Another one like DJ Khaled, a major key, to make the heat, to make 'em sing 
 They make believe, I hear all the lies they make up, Maybe it's maybelliene 
 Like I'm a do it all for what the paper bring 
 I'm not be your slave, you ain't chaining me 
 Promise I'll die for what I believe 
 Go head take a shot, go on aim at me 
 I tell, what I'm told, in the text, that I read 
 Just like it is I don't filter a thing 
 Nothing's off limits, you won't box me in like a Christmas present 
 Better get the message who 
 I'm Jackie chan, I'm jet Li, this my dojo 
 Bruce leroy with no fro, RMG in go mode 
 Judo 
 I'm bout to kick it off like Judo 
 Judo
