Uh... 
 This for everybody surviving, 
 And all they money spent. 
 People up in my house, 
 And I can't even pay my rent. 
 I work my tail off, 
 Hopin' one day I'm well off. 
 Or at least just feed my babies, 
 They say I'm lazy, 
 But they WAY off! 
 I know the struggle, 
 I feel you. 
 Cops still in my rear view. 
 And I ain't broke no laws... 
 But I guess my skin's in clear view. 
 Hey, we need education, 
 Maybe a lil' mo' patience. 
 'Cause our father's gone and this slave mentality's still keepin' us naked. 
 You see crackheads on every corner, 
 Pills, drink... marijuana. 
 Pick jail, and in the coffin, 
 'Cause that's what we see often. 
 And I know sometimes that you just wanna give up, 
 But boy just keep yo' head up... 
 God said that we gon' make it bruh! 
 One day, 
 I know we won't have to cry no more. 
 And this pain, 
 I can't let you take it, 
 That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah! 
 We, we, we gone make it yeah! 
 I can't let you take it, 
 That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah. 
 Single mama it's hard... 
 Lord knows I understand. 
 Growing up and he's smart, 
 How you gon' raise him into a man? 
 You see the pain when he ask about where his daddy at. 
 You'll go hungry to make sure he got clothes on his back! 
 Girl I know you pain, 
 God, He know the same. 
 He hears you when you pray, 
 You can give Him everything. 
 Young man I feel you, 
 See other kids and it kills you. 
 'Cause they dads off in they homes, 
 And yours ain't even nowhere near you! 
 I understand, 'cause I been it. 
 It's real to me, 'cause I lived it! 
 And I swear to God, 
 Long as I breath my son won't know that feeling! 
 Not 'cause I'm so good, 
 But the Lord's my inspiration. 
 Long as He's our Father, 
 I know that we gone make it. 
 Not 'cause I'm so good, 
 But the Lord's my inspiration. 
 Long as He's our Father, 
 I know that we gone make it. 
 One day, 
 I know we won't have to cry no more. 
 And this pain, 
 I can't let you take it, 
 That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah! 
 We, we, we gone make it yeah! 
 I can't let you take it, 
 That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah.
