Look me in my face, I'm a man 
 If you talk behind my back, say it to me, like a man 
 I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man 
 I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man 
 Like a man, like a man 
 Handle business like a man 
 'Fore I live like a coward, I'ma die, like a man 
 If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man 
 And I pray to God, whew, face my fears, like a man 
 All I know is hustle (hustle) 
 All I know is hustle (hustle) 
 You ain't on your business, I don't know if I can trust you 
 Oh I'm taking care of mine 
 Look my children in the eye 
 Tell em', you won't miss a meal, 'long as Daddy still alive 
 I stand on my word, I won't take it back 
 I'd die over mine, as simple as that 
 So even If I don't get platinum plaque 
 I build all my gold and then turn into scholarship ah 
 Ten toe down, always on the grind 
 Look me in the eye, I don't play around 
 Secure the bag and break it down 
 Invest that home to build community 
 I only buy from people down the street 
 I eat, you eat, you eat, they eat, we eat 
 I bring us alls bread and the cheese 
 A pizza party all on me, scratch that all on God 
 I'm blessed on blessed, (?) with Rolex on wrist 
 My investment by my estimate 
 Leave a heritage to my testament 
 Look me in my face, I'm a man 
 If you talk behind my back, say it to me like a man 
 I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man 
 I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man 
 Like a man, like a man 
 Handle business like a man 
 'Fore I live like a coward, ima die like a man 
 If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man 
 And I pray to God, whew, face my fears like a man 
 I am not your boy, don't you call me that 
 I'm really a king I been on mission take my throne back 
 Pull up on you like the liquor store, where the crown at 
 They just go in circles try to stop me, that's a cul de sac 
 All back in my bag and got it jumpin' that's a set race 
 Shoot my shot like Reggie Miller, you can't net pace-err 
 Uh yeah, if you been sleeping, I make you a (?) 
 I keep killin' checks they gon' leave me the (?) 
 My injects are lethal, My hustle is lethal 
 I see like an eagle, they watch me like Vevo 
 My movements will teach you, I'm here for my people 
 Break it down, break it down, welcome to class 
 Welcome to we ain't coolin' for a dollar 
 Look inside the mirror all I see T'Challa 
 Revolutionary, Jesus (?) problem 
 Stand up like a man 
 Stand up like a man 
 Look me in my face, I'm a man 
 If you talk behind my back, say it to me like a man 
 I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man 
 I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man 
 Like a man, like a man 
 Handle business like a man 
 'Fore I live like a coward, ima die like a man 
 If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man 
 And I pray to God, whew, face my fears like a man
