(Verse 1 - Derek Minor) 
 Okay, you mean if I ain't rappin' 'bout a trunk full of dope 
 And my eyes ain't low 'cause I'm blowing on dro 
 Or I talk it how I live it, keep it real when I flow 
 You gon' act like I ain't killin' these beats on the low? 
 Whoa, that's a lie, all I know is raw 
 When I'm going so hard 'cause I do it for the Lord 
 Yeah I'm free, I don't need validation from y'all 
 Got the deed to my life, co-signed by God 
 So what you wanna do? Hate on me, you want to 
 But you gon' feel the fear of God every time I come through 
 'Cause all I know, I run for him until I'm in the grave 
 Got a whole team with me and they all feel the same 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 You hear the same things every time I talk 
 And I take the same steps every time I walk 
 So if you hear the name Jesus come out of my mouth 
 Then you already know what I'm about 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Preach 
 (Verse 2 - Deraj) 
 Under pressure, and I'm under the weather 
 Get my strength in my weakness and put this beat on a stretcher 
 I'll bet you've never seen rappers and Photoshop mixed together 
 Turn haters into believers, I'll make 'em never say never 
 Huh, I ain't playin', sweaty you ain't playing 
 Aye I'm finna mess around and make me go super saiyan 
 Power in my words, call that a super saying 
 I'm in the image of God, you thought I wasn't creative? 
 (Verse 3 - Chad Jones) 
 It's Jones, I promise; won't run up on you and llamas 
 Won't squeeze off, leave me sauce for your Reeboks, that I won't do for pasta 
 No Parmesan bread, I'm full, quite, say carbs lead to Suge Knight 
 There's something more important than the moolah, the good life 
 We ride around and we screamin' out "without a doubt, he the only way" 
 Better hear me like I'm Washington 'cause my state of mind is misspoken, mayne 
 Kill for what, amigos? Asian, black sweats my lingo 
 Beat y'all effort at nobility, God only thing goes 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 You hear the same things every time I talk 
 And I take the same steps every time I walk 
 So if you hear the name Jesus come out of my mouth 
 Then you already know what I'm about 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Preach 
 (Verse 4 - Brothatone) 
 Hey what you wanna buy shell bin and juice, sell shooting shells like Mario 
 Blowing dro like Marley and treading mills, that's cardio 
 Sorry bro, can't sell out and say you cheap, ain't no starting coke 
 I'm no gorilla yet I got monkey bars like Harleys though 
 And the cross I carry, no bloody Marys will carry for 
 But I rap about his Son being buried, hence that's a scary flow 
 Won't rap about the cheese with my crab, this ain't no dairy store 
 Let that soul salute when you hear the truth in your stereo 
 (Verse 5 - Canon) 
 Now DJ done grabbed my collar, tell me Canon what you know about problems? 
 What you know about being on labels but don't get respect when you're down at the bottom? 
 It ain't raw but you shockin' 'em, frustrated to the point, you done rocked with 'em 
 It's amazing we takin' on obstacles, man I'll kill 'em can I kill 'em while I rock with 'em? 
 We're called to get really raw with you all 
 We should get lost while we set this off ... 
 I'ma focus, been a wild one, living and killing like living in autumn 
 Skip dragging a beat, another rapper that need to drop four to have a good album 
 Well reversed it and got 'em scratching they head 
 Drop two 'cause 
 numero uno 
 resurrected when the world was dead 
 (Hook - Derek Minor) 
 You hear the same things every time I talk 
 And I take the same steps every time I walk 
 So if you hear the name Jesus come out of my mouth 
 Then you already know what I'm about 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that 
 You can't do nothin' but respect that 
 Can't do nothin' but respect that
