Gun shots in the night (oh, oh, oh) 
 Sing a lullaby 
 Sing a lullaby (ay, ay, ay) 
 When I close my eyes (oh, oh, oh) 
 I just wanna say goodbye, wanna say goodbye (ay, ay, ay) 
 Gun shots in the night (oh oh oh) 
 Sing a lullaby 
 Sing a lullaby (ay ay ay) 
 When I close my eyes (oh oh oh) 
 I just wanna say goodbye 
 Everyone tellin' me I need to calm down 
 I've been goin' crazy, feelin' like I'm losin' it 
 Though I got it all now, the Devil he been waitin' 
 I've been on his menu, guess I'm finally in his claws now 
 Trying to avoid the fall now, steal my innocence 
 I need to repent, I am not perfect 
 You should now that by now 
 I've been medicatin' everything away 
 I'm just trying not to ever feel the pain 
 I already know that it's wrong 
 Quit talkin' to me, leave me 'lone 
 I member some people that say they the light 
 They be the ones that bout to make me (?) 
 Skeletons all in my closet, Skeletons turn into monster 
 If there is a God and you're right here and you're listening 
 I'm tired of it all, oh, I'm tired of it all 
 'Cause I see death in my nightmares 
 In my nightmares, in my nightmares 
 In my nightmares, in my nightmares 
 I got voices in my head that always come and talk to me 
 And my fear is Freddy Kruger 'cause they stalk me in my dreams 
 I see slave ship, guns, clips, gang colors, prison cells, dope fiends 
 Jim Crow, Jim Beam, pills, lean, no justice, no peace 
 Felonies and misdemeanors 
 Wondering if we curse 
 Can I get my degree first? 
 'Fore they murder me, no degree first 
 It's America, we get the green first 
 You feed the poor but it's greed first 
 Livin' water but I die of thirst 
 If there is a God and you're right here and you're listening 
 I'm tired of it all, oh, I'm tired of it all 
 'Cause I see death in my nightmares 
 In my nightmares, in my nightmares 
 In my nightmares, in my nightmares 
 But just when I was drowning 
 Surrounded by a sea of my own darkness 
 Then light broke through 
 And just as I was swallowed by my own fears 
 Then light broke through 
 Now all I see is you, you, you 
 God, all I see is you, you, you 
 All I see is you, you, you 
 All I see is you, you, you, you
