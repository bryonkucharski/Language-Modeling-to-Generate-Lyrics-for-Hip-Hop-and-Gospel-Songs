Camille Faulkner and Derek Minor 
 I don't ever listen what they say 
 Plus I got a feeling they don't like me anyway 
 That's okay, I'm good enough 
 He said I'm good enough 
 And every single time I'm on the role 
 They be trying to tell me who I'm not, but I know 
 That I'm good enough 
 He said I'm good enough 
 Derek Minor 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Okay 
 I've been on a mission, trying to dodge a villain 
 Telling me that it's a better me and I can't get 'im 
 Did you here bout so-and-so? It look like he winnin' 
 Comparing me to what's-his-name, but I on't-e'en pay attention 
 Trying to move me out my zone, I only pay a visit 
 Speeding in my lane this year, I only paid a ticket 
 I can't be who you say, just who God has made me 
 Anything else is too fake, ugly like Sheneneh 
 You so crae-zy 
 Oh yeah, I'm doing okay (doing okay, yeah) 
 Oh yeah, I'm done with this roleplay 
 Y'all gon' have to take me like I am this year 
 If Jesus made us in His image, this right here the mirror 
 This the mirror, hey

 Okay 
 I looked in the mirror, my reflection, it looked back at me like 
 Whatchou doin'? 
 Who you trying to impress? 
 Tell me whatchou provin'? 
 Some people, they so shallow 
 You can shine your light all day but they gon' only see the shadow 
 Now when I'm talkin' light: let me address some things that people scared to mention 
 (I'mma talk about it) 
 Quite frankly, some of the biggest haters like to say they Christian 
 Dang, why you gotta be that guy? 
 That always put the flaws on other people like, never give people grace even when they try 
 Let me open your closet, is there somethin' to hide? 
 I'm just saying homie 
 Less talkin', more prayin' homie x2 
 Let your words bring life and less decay, homie (no decay) 
 I'll give you time to work it out 
 Cause you don't wanna be the one I'm bout to sing this hook about
