With my eyes to the sky 
 How can I deny you? 
 You're stronger than the weight of the world 
 Raised high for all to see 
 Deep in my heart 
 You placed a vision 
 To build Your empire 
 But my heart's desire 
 Is to build it for me 
 I'm gonna take, I'm gonna make 
 I'm gonna build, I'm gonna break 
 With your power 
 It will be grand, it will be tall 
 It's gonna shine, it will not fall 
 It will be mine 
 'Cause I've got meditations 
 Full of many tensions 
 Trying to hide my bad, bad intentions (bad intentions) 
 I've got bad intentions 
 Full of bad intentions 
 I've got bad intentions
