 Life is like a movie 
 You can never press rewind 
 And you never want to lose it 
 You'll love it when you find 
 I wanna show you in my airplane, baby 
 Make our love touch the sky 
 Show that you're loyal my baby 
 Follow me, let love go high 
 Let love go high {8x} (2x)

 Let's hop on a plane, ? 
 Over seas, outta space, it don't even matter 
 Passport, tattoo, yeah you know we do 
 But I feel like I'm home babe as long as I'm with you yeah 
 Ri-riding in the old school (old school) 
 Leather seats look like tofu 
 Girl, you know I need you like '02 
 Yeah, girl you know I need you like '02 
 I've been righteous to the top right now 
 But from day one, you've been though (you've been though) 
 Finally got things right right now

 I've been on the road, show right after show 
 You've been all alone, so I can't wait to get home 
 Even when I'm not around 
 Anchor, yeah she hold me down 
 I be always out of town 
 But you ain't got nothin' to worry 'bout
