 I live my life like I'm a live forever 
 Like whatever or whenever, just don't tell me never 
 I can tell that there's some people that won't see me better 
 But greatness in our DNA, He ain't made us for failure 
 Uh, we live our dreams while you sleep walkin' 
 That sound of destiny too loud so I can't hear you talkin' 
 They said, "Minor, we be waiting on that fire often" 
 I'm tryin' to cremate a beat, it won't even see a coffin 
 Yeah, I bet you think that this that braggin' flow 
 Talk about some stuff that you ain't got, impress the masses flow 
 That sell your soul, you can buy your home that's massive flow 
 Thinkin' to myself, what's a mansion to a castle though?

 And now You've given us a new beginnin' 
 You placed us high above 
 And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down 
 This is our empire, empire 
 This is our empire, empire

 I see so many problems 
 The Lord teachin' me patience, feelin' like I'm back in college 
 I'm learnin' most my issues have to do with economics 
 But my anger makin' me wanna go and do trigonomics, true 
 I'm just tellin' y'all where I'm at 
 Tellin' y'all that I need grace 
 And I'm still leanin' on that 
 Doc been worried 'bout me that's my dog 
 He think I'm probably gon' snap 
 Now I'm talkin' to God a whole lot lately 
 I'm findin' comfort in that 
 I'm findin' comfort in that 
 He said, "Don't you worry 'bout none of this 
 You actin' like I don't run none of this 
 You actin' like I'mma put all of this on you 
 And ain't no way you overcomin' this 
 My empire never will run out of nothin' 
 'Cause I am the one who is fundin' this 
 Just do what I told you to do 
 Give it all that you got and you risin' above in this"

 And now You've given us a new beginnin'

 And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down 
 This is our empire, empire 
 This is our empire, empire

 And where we goin' we won't need the sun 
 Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love 
 So shine Your light on me 
 Shine Your light on me

 They said that we won't need the sun 
 Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love 
 So shine Your light on me
