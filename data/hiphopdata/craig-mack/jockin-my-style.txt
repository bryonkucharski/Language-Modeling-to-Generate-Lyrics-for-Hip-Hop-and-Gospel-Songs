Here comes a rhyme in your ear Craig Mack is here so have no fear 
 My rhymes push the hack to the rear 
 I'm severe rap pioneer with funk I steer now it's clear 
 Rhymes flow to the break of dawn 
 Exploring MC's I get silly on, like Ponce De Leon 
 Yet don't foget my style is a banger 
 MC's I deposit in the closet on a hanger 
 Mack chop your rhymes like I chop shop chop a Acc 
 Startin with the bones in your back 
 Whenever I attack it's like a blow from a axe 
 Sweet like sugar that be on Sugar Smacks 
 Facts is Mr. or Mrs. 
 Can't another rapper see me when it's time for gettin' biz 
 And the moral of the story as you will see 
 Is that from now on the greatest rapper is me 
 MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy 
 You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style 
 You know you can't touch the flav 
 MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy 
 You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style 
 Craig Mack has the phat funk flav 
 Now I'm sayin', rock funk to the Himalayan 
 No more delaying, MC's you decaying, I'm staying 
 Cause now I'm out my cage 
 And what I do for rap is gonna make front page 
 Remember back in the days I was just a tyke 
 I do a rhyme while I do a wheelie riding bike 
 But now I'm the man with the mic in my hand 
 Starving MC's like them kids from Siam 
 Breaker breaker, it's the funk rhyme shaker 
 Super duper superb slamming like a Laker 
 Swimmin on MC's like moray eels with mass appeal 
 Your rhymes are jokes like Dangerfield's 
 Boy, I'll tell ya, ain't no liver on this continent 
 I'm dope and you the opposite, the man when I be dropping shit 
 Raw, I give MC's a headache 
 Hit your ass so hard and kill your man by mistake 
 Youse a fake ladies and real niggaz know 
 Non-stop rockin' till it's time to go so bust the flow 
 I'm a be a round for a while 
 MC's stop jockin my style 
 Now everybody put your hands in the air 
 Wave them shits like you just don't care, aiyyo 
 You could have a dollar or be a millonaire 
 Sometimes I think that Mack should be mayor 
 Now me, myself and I, we three bad motherfuckers 
 Here to eliminate suckers 
 I came to rock a party are you ready 
 Get your Aunt Millie's out I eat MC's like spaghetti 
 Rap machete, I'll cut your ass like a sword 
 Into buying rhymes these rhymes you can't afford 
 I shine like jewelry, ain't nobody schoolin me 
 I battle anybody just point to who the fool be 
 Cause you and me, we ain't the same type of breed 
 I grab the mic and give the crowd what they need, and proceed 
 To rock the mic since a child 
 Get off my tip and stop jocking my style
