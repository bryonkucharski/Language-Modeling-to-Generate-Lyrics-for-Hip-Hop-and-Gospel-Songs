Ah! 
 Now who the flav 
 That comes a dime a dozen 
 Thinking that is phat but wasn't 
 Welcome to the world of Mack 
 (Of Mackman) 
 Like Biggie Smallz might say 
 I eat'em shits like pac-man 
 I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables 
 Cause... I does what I do you 
 (Do it!) 
 I fake the roof off of soft suckers 
 Super smackin... macking ...full effect mike check one two 
 I'm a reign... rain forever 
 Rain like bad weather... reign like whoever never 
 You can't bite my style 
 Cause my style ain't a style 
 That is a style 
 So I can go buck wild 
 Betcha figure you got more funk for flow 
 It ain't so 
 Flava in Ya Ear letcha know 
 Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk 
 Strap ya rap book 
 Before you get ya wet style shook 
 Can I get down 
 Get down 
 Get on down 
 Can I get down 
 The Mack's like a superintendent 
 Burning MCs leaves a foul scent 
 See I'm like what ya call... king a yes y'all 
 My style wreck shit... I mean real shit 
 Shit's thick... I come with the ammo 
 The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin' 
 I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate 
 I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate 
 My rap loves to alienate 
 Shake ya ass to the stake 
 You sunk by domniate 
 See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas 
 To me ya all suckers 'cause I make the ruckus 
 Don't try to buckus we roll with the cuf 
 No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth 
 I pound on the ground when I get down 
 So let me get down... let me get down 
 To leap a tall building 
 Crush the earth-a-phone 
 But I'm sayin' ain't no fair when MCs roam 
 The mic now in the right hands 
 Cause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans 
 More pep than the peppa that's in ya peppa shaka 
 Ruff earthquaker... couldn't take me if ya mama make ya 
 I back up the funk that I bring 
 With unknown to mad slang 
 With bigger bite than the double-bang 
 I ain't met boot to hand 
 If ya testin in ya lesson 
 Got me dressin for ya funeral session 
 Man... It won't even matter no more 
 Craig in 94' just won the war 
 My style definite to take ya over 
 Have ya sittin' look over in a four door Chevy Nova 
 (Why yi yi) 
 I figure it's a slaughter 
 In the world of colins (?) 
 Ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter 
 The name of the track is Get Down 
 So let me Get Down and pound other MCs in the ground
