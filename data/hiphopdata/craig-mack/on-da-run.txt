Craig Mack: 
 Eh yo, god bless the dead, ya know? 
 And all my cats I know with the football jerseys on: don't have no regrets 
 Hold them numbers 
 Big up to the feds who tried to catch me in 88, nigga 
 Ha! Funk Flav, Mr. Mack 
 Eh yo, I can't face going to jail 
 'Cause my life is bullshit, man, nigga fuck paying bail 
 Shit is on the third rail 
 On my tail is the feds, baby, Frank ?? for club med 
 Niggaz wanna kill me, god 
 Scared I might wrap these niggaz 
 Entrap these niggaz 
 If the feds wasn't watching I would clap these niggaz 
 I mean put a bullet through the fuckin' back of these niggaz 
 Phone ringing off the hook, probably tapped my niggaz 
 See the headlines now: "Mack found in 5 rivers" 
 FDR, thinkin' was it better when I didn't buy the car 
 Didn't cop the bar, didn't buy my girl mother a new jaguar 
 Shit, my moms got the Continental R with the backseat bar 
 Talkin' about "my sons a star" 
 Little do she know I'm Caesar and world ??? 
 Crack is dead, I'm sellin X instead 
 Bitches in my bed will fill your ass with lead 
 Keep givin' me head till the tip turns red 
 Sit back and watch me butter this bread 
 On the run 
 Best three words to describe my life, make the game my wife 
 On the run 
 Hustler, born and raised, in the streets where I spent my days 
 Craig Mack: 
 I told my main chick, pack your bags, She ain't listen 
 Chrome started whistling and turned her Christian 
 Blew up the whole house using nitro-glycerin 
 But the Expedition in the garage was missing 
 Moved the nannies and the kids to a new position 
 Intuition gave me suspicion 
 Shit is murder, do I kill myself and fuck them niggaz' satisfaction 
 Or demand action, pull out toast and start blasting 
 Young niggaz asking, wise cats only give a fraction 
 Streets is the young man's attraction 
 I dug myself into a hole 
 Into a world that's cold 
 Pimps, players, bitches, ballers, hustlers, drugs, guns and thugs 
 Million dollar homes, like Capone's, persian rugs 
 Gentlemen with fake hugs, turn to slugs 
 I'm a made man, paid man, show no love 
 Clock's ticking, plot thicken, probably written in a book somewhere 
 My fuckin' life ain't fair 
 See either way, I'ma make it off this earth without a trace 
 So if I ever see the judge, I'ma spit in the bitch face 
 Craig Mack: 
 Eh yo, faggots 
 Nah I'm sayin', all you sweet cats, nahmean? 
 Real gentleman don't need it 
 Its strictly drive-through window meals 
 Enemies lurking every crack and crevice, eating rocks for breakfast 
 No time for music, carry toast and use it 
 See your house and uz' it 
 Test your life and lose it 
 You heard Gotti, shit is all fucked up 
 His family didn't even wanna check him 
 Disrespect and neglect him 
 In a place to correct him 
 Disconnect him and stretch him 
 While the bull cop police protection 
 Shit is question 
 My suggestion in the game of deception 
 Is to reign with aggression 
 With the guns for collection 
 The whores you undressing, keep 'em inside the best western 
 You want a firm investment? 
 Nigga, go have a kid, and let him eat your steak 
 Don't make the same mistake 
 Hope the kid is strong, when I'm gone 
 You'll be like pop-duke was the man, but his life was wrong 
 Gunned down off the top like Kong 
 Craig Mack: 
 Mack!
