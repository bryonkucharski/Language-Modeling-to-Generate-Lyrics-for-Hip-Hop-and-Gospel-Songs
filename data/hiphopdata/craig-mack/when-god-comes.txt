What da fuck's going on inside the biz 
 Shit ain't raw no more 
 Fake is how it is 
 I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing 
 Then going home and chilling 
 Frontin' like a villain 
 Let me tell you something real 
 Is how the Mack feel, 
 I ain't no criminal and represent no steel 
 I tell you one thing though 
 MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth 
 To let you know 
 I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God 
 To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod 
 You MC's have been too bad, 
 So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had 
 When MC's disappear it's my fault, 
 It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt 
 And radio ya need to be ashamed, 
 For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in 
 Our brain 
 I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it, 
 Representing truth when the Mack 
 Starts to mike it 
 I hope the subject don't turn ya away 
 But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray 
 Whatcha gon do when God comes 
 You can front now, but when God comes 
 You can't get straped for when God comes 
 'Cause you won't know how to act, when God comes 
 Now we all established dat Mack's new king 
 And the king for his people has to represent the 
 Right thing 
 Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding 
 'Cause same boat we riding, will do like the Poseidon 
 I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch 
 Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger 
 I watched drugs and guns take control 
 I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul 
 They ain't got respect no more 
 When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore 
 Ladies you need to help out your man, 
 Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand 
 The Black family is now pre-history 
 And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick 
 We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please 
 Lord help us shake this disease 
 And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke, 
 Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword 
 You stroke 
 So take heed to the words that I send, 
 'Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend 
 All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint 
 I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint 
 How long can we sing that song 
 Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong 
 And don't figure Mack new to get started 
 'Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded 
 I'm talking from veteran chair prepare 
 MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear 
 Shape up ya Lord about to strike 
 With thunder claps that turn day into night 
 With something similar to Gabriel's horn 
 The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn 
 Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here 
 People of the world presenting Mack this year 
 No need for fronting his time has almost came 
 And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name 
 Choru
