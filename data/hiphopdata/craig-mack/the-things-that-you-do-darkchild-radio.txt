It's the things that you do 
 That makes me keep running to you. 
 Keep on loving me the way you love me 
 'Cause in love is where I ought to be. 
 What I feel inside I can not deny. 
 It feels good to have in my life, oh yeah. 
 Why I fell this way I can not explain, 
 But your love has taken over me, oh yeah. 
 You give more than a typical good lovin'. 
 What you got is more than I ever wanted. 
 So, Please don't stop, keep it right there in my baby. 
 So, I'm gonna do to you what no other lady can do. 
 It's the things that you do 
 That makes me keep running to you. 
 Keep on loving me the way you love me 
 'Cause in love is where I ought to be. 
 If love is wrong I don't wanna do right no more 
 'Cause I love you with all my heart. 
 What I ask of you, to keep doing what you do 
 When you do the things you do. 
 I don't need nobody else but you. 
 Please don't go 
 Please don't go nowhere 'cause you don't know, 
 You just don't know how much I care. 
 That's why I love you so, 
 I love you more and more each day. 
 All I do is pray that you don't never go away. 
 It's the things you do that make me keep running to you. 
 Keep on loving me the way you love me 
 'Cause in love is where I ought to be. 
 It's the things you do that make me keep running to you. 
 Keep on loving me the way you love me 
 'Cause in love is where I ought to be. 
 It's the things that you do that make me keep running to you.

 'Cause in love is where I ought to be. 
 It's the things that you do that make me keep running to you.
