I'll hold you remix (this the remix) 
 I'll hold you remix 
 You are, you are 
 Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down 
 I'll hold you down, I'm on my way 
 My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you 
 Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power 
 So I found her, fly shit, I jump up out her 
 I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter 
 There goes my baby 
 Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air 
 Hold this ready and I'm round 
 You hold me down, I'mma hold you down 
 Now 
 I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear 
 Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire 
 Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors 
 Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door 
 Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone 
 How could I let you down if you never hit the phone? 
 Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane 
 We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change 
 Trap star, two bricks in the match box 
 Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top 
 I wanna spend a night with Jessica White 
 But is a dopeboy really Jessica type? 
 There goes my baby 
 Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air 
 Hold this ready and I'm round 
 You hold me down, I'mma hold you down 
 Now 
 I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you) 
 I'll hold you remix now 
 I'm on my way to hold you down 
 (We the best 
 Yeah, we the best at holding it down) 
 She said he don't hold her down right 
 Some day she'll be done with him 
 I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of them 
 You gotta know your work, baby, don't give 'em no discount 
 All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount 
 And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce 
 I'm the one who getting this amount 
 I'm the one with this foreign shit 
 Name still getting mispronounced 
 Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down? 
 I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down 
 It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang 
 Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang 
 Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim 
 And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name 
 There goes my baby 
 Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air 
 Hold this ready and I'm round 
 You hold me down, I'mma hold you down 
 Now 
 I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you) 
 I'll hold you remix now 
 I'm on my way to hold you down 
 Keys to the whip, key to the mansion 
 I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic 
 See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Adonis 
 And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor 
 That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit 
 She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit 
 It's been a long time and she's still holding me down 
 (This the remix) 
 Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride) 
 I done been through hell, had ups and downs 
 But in the long run still here 
 I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air 
 She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear 
 On everything, she never changed for real 
 That's why 
 There goes my baby 
 Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air 
 Hold this ready and I'm round 
 You hold me down, I'mma hold you down 
 Now
