 The winners I represent the ghetto 'cross the world 
 And you represent the horde, two hands in the sky 
 (I'm so hood) 
 Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist 
 And I never dance when I'm in this place 
 'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate 
 (I'm so hood) 
 And I got these golds up in my mouth 
 If you get closer to my house 
 Then you know what I'm takin' 'bout 
 I'm out the hood 
 And if you feel me put your hands up 
 (Hood) 
 My hood of ***, can you stand up?
