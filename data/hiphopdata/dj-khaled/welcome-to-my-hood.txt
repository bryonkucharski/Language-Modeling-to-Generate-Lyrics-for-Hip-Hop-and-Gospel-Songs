 Welcome to my hood 
 Everybody know everybody 
 And if I got it everybody got it uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Look at all these old school Chevys 
 Twenty fours so you know we roll heavy uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 They outside playing hopscotch 
 And every know this is the hot spot 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Them boys will put you down on your knees 
 (Woop, woop) 
 That's the sound of the police in my hood 
 Audemar on my wrist 
 Diamonds, look like they glowing 
 Fifty stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing 
 Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin' 
 Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em 
 Lord forgive me for my sins, 
 That's my confessions if they put me in this Benz 
 I got possession of a federal offense 
 I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent 
 So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt 
 Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga 
 Blow that bitch on a bottle 
 The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo' in the back (Rose) 
 Tell you "we the best forever" DJ Khaled handle that 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Everybody know everybody 
 And if I got it everybody got it uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Look at all these old school Chevys 
 Twenty fours so you know we roll heavy uh

 (Woop, woop) 
 That's the sound of the police in my hood 
 I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga 
 I'm talkin' Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga 
 If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us 
 And tell congress when you see 'em bitch I'm stealin' cable 
 And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us 
 And why is the half of my whole hood on papers 
 Some of 'em on house arrest, some of 'em on child support 
 Some of 'em did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court 
 Mr. Landlord we gon' bust your ass for that eviction note 
 Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo' 
 I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores 
 We throw our money round here, but y'all can 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Everybody know everybody 
 And if I got it everybody got it uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Look at all these old school Chevys 
 Twenty fours so you know we roll heavy uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 They outside playing hopscotch 
 And every know this is the hot spot 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Them boys will put you down on your knees 
 (Woop, woop) 
 That's the sound of the police in my hood 
 Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad 
 And they say time fly's, well mine's first class 
 I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets 
 I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach 
 Back from hell, cell twenty three, tell the warden kiss my ass 
 Pockets on Monique 
 Bitch I'm from the murder capital 
 Hoe I'm far from practical 
 Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to 
 Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot 
 I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot 
 All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out 
 Got it sewn up, check the thread count 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Everybody know everybody 
 And if I got it everybody got it uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Look at all these old school Chevys 
 Twenty fours so you know we roll heavy uh 
 Welcome to my hood 
 They outside playing hopscotch 
 And every know this is the hot spot 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Them boys will put you down on your knees 
 (Woop, woop) 
 I say fuck the police in my hood
