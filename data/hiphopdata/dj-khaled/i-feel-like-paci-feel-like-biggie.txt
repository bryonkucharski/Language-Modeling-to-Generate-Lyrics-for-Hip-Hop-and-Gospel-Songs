I've been waiting for a long time (how long) 
 Real damn long time (how long) 
 I've been waiting for a long time (how ya feel) 
 Man... 
 I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie 
 I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me 
 I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind 
 You know I go hard when it comes to mine 
 I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, Biggie 
 Sucka walk up on me, talking like he know me 
 Ain't no co defendant do my dirt all by my lonely 
 Down south nigga, talking Jam Pony 
 Rest in Peace to Uncle Al he showed me my first Rollie 
 Bitches want to know me, haters want to show me 
 But I'm so vicious double m worth eighty tickets 
 Cop just pulled me over, caught up in this thing 
 Take my case to trial, my juror Paula Deen 
 I know they hate a nigga but he's such a major nigga 
 Give Chelsea Clinton the .40 when C.I.A. with us 
 305 the realest, Ricky Ross the richest 
 Belaire on my table, I talk it then I live it 
 I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie 
 I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me 
 I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind 
 You know I go hard when it comes to mine 
 I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, Biggie 
 All of you starve and I eat fast 
 Mulsanne when I creep past 
 Blacked out I max out with the same same watch on me chain 
 We killing niggas no repass my momma got like 3 Jags 
 You talkin' bout how you ball nigga we really gettin' that street cash 
 Say old money, new work 
 Smell the caine on my new shirt 
 My old g said strap up and don't lay your head where you do dirt 
 And my momma said do school work 
 I was making that tool work 
 And niggas wanted me dead with a whole lot on my head 
 Man they hit Big in the passenger, hit Pac in the passenger 
 So I'm riding round with this Mac on me 
 And a bunch of shooters in back of us 
 Roll up and you a dead man 
 Head shot when we clapped ya 
 We sendin niggas to the motherland, and I ain't talkin' bout Africa 
 I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie 
 I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me 
 I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind 
 You know I go hard when it comes to mine 
 I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, Biggie 
 Feel like it's "me against the world" 
 "Bury me a g" 
 My middle finger to "the world" 
 I'm gon' forever be a g 
 Pussy nigga want a witness stay armed no Biggie 
 When we get busy no alarms just semis 
 We "pour out a lil liquor" throw it like "straight ballers" 
 We "cradle to the grave" ride when "my homie call" 
 Give a damn if it mean life or death, "what's beef"? 
 When "somebody gotta die", we gon' march to the steps 
 They said "Brenda had a baby" but she left it in the alley 
 One shot that "playa hater" now we "going back to Cali" 
 Hit the time nigga "I got a story to tell" 
 My "ambitions as a rider" got me "ready to die" 
 And "when we ride" on "no more pain" "we go hard" as shit 
 Why you complaining and you wonder why we call you bitch 
 It's an every day struggle nigga "me and my bitch" 
 It's unbelievable "suicide thoughts" you would get 
 Said fuck me "warning" and the gun don't blast 
 "Give me the loot" sorry nigga "one more chance" 
 You know this "shit don't stop" 
 Keep these sucker "under pressure" 
 Hollerin' "only god can judge me" shawty "I ain't mad at ya" 
 Got my mind made up 
 Ya nigga "can't see me" 
 A paid "thug" nigga 
 That's why "shorty wanna be" me 
 See a kid around around in your town kick in your door 
 I feel like Pac and Biggie "love the dough", more than you know 
 I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie 
 I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me 
 I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind 
 You know I go hard when it comes to mine 
 I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, Biggie 
 Ey yo, how you gon' compare yourself to greatness 
 If you ain't ready to be great, man? 
 Ain't no more to it
