 Make me give up everything I worked for 
 You gon' make me give up everything I worked for 
 Sunday, you ain't got to church though 
 I still bless you but you what come first though 
 Make me give up everything I worked for

 You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds 
 Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do 
 I had you after twelve but you came right after at two 
 I could have anything I want but I still want you, that's the truth 
 I'm not really into the sentimentals 
 Just me and you behind the tinted windows 
 While you throwing all these innuendos 
 We just finna' fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS 
 That's LA confidential, show me everything that you've been through 
 We only do what we meant to like, whoa 
 This that, titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit 
 This that, fuck you in the air, no service dick 
 This that, call his ass right now, say you're deserting him 
 This that, call him while we fucking so he heard the shit 
 Make me give up everything I worked for 
 You gon' make me give up everything I worked for 
 Sunday, you ain't got to church though 
 I still bless you but you what come first though 
 Make me give up everything I worked for 
 Sunday, that's what they pray to church for 
 You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

 Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids 
 And more major keys than a locksmith

 My bed was a pallet on the carpet 
 My ride was a bus named MARTA 
 Pillow full of Estee Lauder
