 I dropped the top off the Maybach, fuck these cops (rrt, rrt) 
 V12, see ya, 12 (bye) 
 I do the whole dash with no seatbelt 
 Screamin', "Free my nigga, Meek Mill" 
 Niggas can't wheelie in this free world 
 Meanwhile Georgie Porgie sinnin' and sendin' me threats 
 Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps 
 Try that shit with a grown man 
 I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand 
 And hop back in the coupe (woo, woo) 
 Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit 
 Save all that woopty woop 
 Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot 
 No jewels in this Patek Philippe 
 It's complicated, three million apiece 
 Sheesh, that's how we do time 
 Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine 
 $91,000 for a wine bill 
 Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill 
 My whole team ball 
 Everybody's a star but the team ball 
 '61 with the thing off 
 Me and Blue havin' a sing off 
 That's a raspberry beret 
 The kind you find in a second-hand store 
 That's a vintage piece 
 Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new 
 I had the 'Bach-bach-bach you know how I do 
 Two-tone with the powder blue (woo) 
 Realest shit to come out the stu' 
 Khaled is valid, every word is true 
 What these niggas gon' do without us, dude?

 I chopped the top off in Otis 
 Ridin' 'round town with the FLOTUS 
 1.5 for the Landaulet 
 Bey, put these fuckboys on notice (fuckboys on notice) 
 I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room 
 I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two 
 My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat 
 Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again 
 Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik 
 In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek" 
 Two deep, it's just me and JAY 
 Just posted in them courtside seats 
 Woo! I'm like "hol' up" 
 Woo! I might roll up 
 If they're tryna party with the queen 
 They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ay 
 I took the top off the Maybach, yeah

 Ooh-ooh, ooh, it's glittery, glittery 
 Ooh-ooh, it's pricy, pricy 
 Ooh-ooh, 1.5 
 Ooh-ooh, I'm hyphy, I'm hyphy 
 I hear the po-po behind me, woo, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt) 
 I see the po-po behind me, rrt, ain't gon' stop (skrrt, skrrt) 
 I see the po-po behind me, rrt, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt)
