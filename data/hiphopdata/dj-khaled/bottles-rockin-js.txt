 All I know is how to smash on everybody record and do what I do 
 And make somebody have to go and get a hearse 
 Yo, Game I don't really give a f-ck if it's your record 
 And you my brother my nigga look I gotta rhyme fresh 
 See the way I coming, how I do the game, church 
 Ask somebody, you gotta know you need to get a nurse 
 Let me bang 'em with another killa, then we put a couple bottles on the chiller 
 Kill 'em with another verse 
 Everybody see the way I be going and going 
 How I do it 
 Niggas the only way we know it, but then again, yes we do 
 We knowing how I be banging 
 And every sheet that I get 
 All the heat I be packin; 
 And I show it off 
 With all this money you know where I'm heading 
 And I'm gonna get the Jordan's the patent 11 leathers 
 They really banging all the way down to the [?] 
 And I get a couple pair with all this money I be getting 
 And I kill 'em with the bounce, you see the way a nigga steppin 
 And we pop bottles and we rock J's, see me reppin 
 Let me show you way I do it before I hit you with the weapon 
 Don't be spillin' liquor all over my shit, give me a second 
 Shiiiit, anyway, see we gotta get it up, fillin bottles up 
 Let me [?]

 Bitches, I'm gettin' money, bottles and rocking chains 
 Money like I'm LeBron, my whip collection insane 
 Suicidal thoughts, highway to heaven riding like a boss 
 Condominium in the clouds, 60g's a month

 Bitches snortin' blow, f-ckin fast and cookin' dope

 (Fabolous) 
 I put footprints in them couches 
 I put so much in my two step 
 Put on for my city, I ain't got no choice but to rep 
 I put straight shots in they hair 
 Make pretty girls, do the ugly face 
 And they just my song on 
 Move back I need dougie space like ay, ay 
 Then its right back to my muggin' face 
 Niggas said put the weed out 
 BBM, you buggin face 
 We walked in, want somethin', bottles pop like we won some'n 
 Raise a glass for err'ybody that's done something from nothin' 
 No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind 
 Cargo's and J's on, they let sun in, no blinds 
 All I drink is my shit 
 Stop playin', Youtube 
 But tonight we on that Red Berry and Cranberry, So Woo 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 And I'm smokin' on that purp 
 Sippin' on that purp 
 I came in this bitch with some niggas that will murk 
 And we ain't bout all that talkin', you a dead man walking 
 Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordans 
 Got a scope on the barrell that's a hammer with a camera 
 Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer 
 I don't know nothing but bitches and gettin' money 
 Blood gang kill a nigga in public 
 Young Tunechi 
 Shoot a nigga ass up then it's Deuces 
 Head shots that f-cking vest is so useless
