We the Best Music! 
 Another one! 
 Young Money, Alicia Keys, chea! 
 DJ Khaled! 
 I just got back from 
 Where they said I couldn't get back from 
 And I thank God, I thank God that I made it 
 They surprised, they surprised that I made it 
 Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces 
 I wonder how I keep finding these places 
 I can't explain how it feels to be patient 
 Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 I got something inside of me that can't be quenched 
 I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched 
 Go to war for every black queen that they lynched 
 And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched 
 Uh, after they use you, then they abuse you 
 Then they get mad when they lose you (excuse you) 
 You know the liar will accuse you 
 You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual 
 Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive 
 Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record 
 The devil thought he had me 
 But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie 
 I just got back from 
 Where they said I couldn't get back from 
 And I thank God, I thank God that I made it 
 They surprised, they surprised that I made it 
 Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces 
 I wonder how I keep finding these places 
 I can explain how it feels to be patient 
 Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 Say nobody knows 
 All the trouble I've seen (tell 'em baby) 
 Glory, looking for some glory 
 From all the trouble I've seen (one more time) 
 Tell 'em nobody knows, all my sorrows 
 Nobody knows what tomorrow 
 I just got back from 
 Where they said I couldn't get back from 
 And I thank God, I thank God that I made it 
 They surprised, they surprised that I made it 
 Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces 
 I wonder how I keep finding these places 
 I can explain how it feels to be patient 
 Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows 
 Nobody knows, nobody but you 
 Baby, say it glory 
 You, I 
 Can you feel it? Can you see it? 
 Tell your mama you
