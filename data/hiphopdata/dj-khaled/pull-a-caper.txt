We The Best Music! 
 Another one 
 DJ Khaled! 
 Glee! 
 I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper 
 I got you, Khaled, it's Wizop 
 It's the Dapper Don going on a trapathon 
 Serving coked out food and kush, I call it a triathlon 
 In a red Don with an Amazon 
 She pissed me off, I just found out she got her panties on 
 A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns 
 It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs 
 I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun 
 I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns 
 Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon 
 Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans 
 But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back 
 'Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac 
 I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper 
 It's do or die on my side of things 
 Destiny is my livelihood 
 I'm Iverson with the long braids 
 Three cellphones with the gold fronts 
 Wild thing 'til I Yao Ming 
 Five rings, past nine seasons 
 Big money, that's our thing 
 Heavyweight, I Ali 'em 
 Featherweight how I leave 'em 
 Heaven's sakes, God's need 'em 
 Bob weave rock the Colosseum 
 I'm the biggest nigga, you got gonorrhea 
 Baddest bitches make my collage 
 Biggest buds make my cigars 
 Basic bitches and custom cars 
 Blowjobs in the SLR's 
 Realest ones wanna watch you shine 
 Smoking good and I'm talking facts 
 Iced out like DJ Khaled 
 Burn it down with Kodak Black 
 I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes 
 I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper 
 I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith 
 Jumping out with your bae 
 I just wanna get this paper
