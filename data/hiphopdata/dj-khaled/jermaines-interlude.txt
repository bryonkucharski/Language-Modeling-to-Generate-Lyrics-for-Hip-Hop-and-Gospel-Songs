Can't call it, can't call it 
 I never came from deep pockets 
 Why can't I make a deposit? 
 Can't call it, uh, can't call it 
 Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it 
 I never came from deep pockets 
 Why can't I make a deposit? 
 Can't call it, can't call it 
 Oh, I had so many days of crying 
 Oh, I had so many days of pain 
 Have you ever been as sad as I am? 
 Lord, I ask if anything would change? 
 I can see the future that we're heading 
 I would say it's better not to tell 
 If it's anything like this in Heaven 
 Maybe I'd be better off in hell 
 (Better off in hell) 
 Tables do turn and labels do burn, the second that they ask you to sell your soul 
 Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold 
 'Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold 
 And if you never go gold again, at least you will know 
 The end of your rope was chose by you and not companies 
 Who control our remote control and hide the truth on my no 
 But don't mind me, I'm just high again, smokin' weed to get by again 
 No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' it got me smilin' 
 Rhyming like I rhyme, way back when I would play the violin 
 Thought that shit wasn't cool, momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' 
 Paid for your house in hopes there'd be no more reason for cryin' 
 That shows you how stupid I am, 'cause niggas is out here dying 
 From police that flash the siren and then pull up and just start firin' 
 Niggas murkin' each other, n murky water I try and swim 
 How the fuck do I look when I brag to you about some diamond? 
 Said all I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement 
 Oh, I had so many days of crying 
 Oh, I had so many days of pain 
 Have you ever been as sad as I am? 
 Lord, I ask if anything would change? 
 I can see the future that we're heading 
 I would say it's better off not to tell 
 If it's anything like this in Heaven 
 Maybe I'd be better off in hell 
 (Better off in hell) 
 Can't call it, can't call it 
 I never came from deep pockets 
 Why can't I make a deposit? 
 Can't call it, uh, can't call it 
 Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it 
 I never came from deep pockets 
 Why can't I make a deposit? 
 Can't call it, can't call it
