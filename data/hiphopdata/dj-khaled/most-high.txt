We all got to go through storms 
 We all got to go through mud 
 Remember the sunshine on the other side 
 First I got to give thanks to the most high 
 I've been through it all good and bad seen both side 
 Now we in the sky seem so high 
 And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie 
 You know what they say more money more problems 
 I guess they mad at us just 'cause we came from the bottom 
 I feel the rain the storm's coming in 
 But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up) 
 Don't worry it won't rain forever 
 I've been through the craziest weather 
 The world is cold there ain't no one to call on 
 I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong 
 You know what they say more money more problems 
 I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom 
 I feel the rain the storm's coming in 
 But after the rain we'll be shining again 
 Thak you for all of my blessings 
 All praise to the most high 
 The most high
