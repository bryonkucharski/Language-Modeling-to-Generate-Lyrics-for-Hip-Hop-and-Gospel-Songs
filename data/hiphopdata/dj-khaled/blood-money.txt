 Slide in the slider, in and out night vision 
 Scopes on the AR to hit 'em with precision

 Came from under the sand, lift my own weight up 
 Bought a house off the curb was patient, so it paid up 
 No pleasure and pain, homie, just the price for the flight 
 Don't get'cha head chopped, fuckin' with them five stripes 
 Eagle land it went south now we got the cake 
 Paper plate money every time I hitch a state
