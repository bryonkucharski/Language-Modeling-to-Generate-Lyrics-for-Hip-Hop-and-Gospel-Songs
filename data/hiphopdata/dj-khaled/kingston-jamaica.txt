Kingston, Kingston, Kingston 
 I see them coming from afar 
 I got my eyes open I'm ready for war 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 I see them coming from afar 
 The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 My mom is my hero 
 Two three nine zero 
 Doctor was looking at us talk 
 From then I've been strictly on a mission 
 I got twenty-twenty vision 
 All the haters I can spot them from far 
 I'm sure 
 Jamacains on slash date 
 Probably representin' and bringing it home 
 After I sing my songs 
 I duck trouble but it keep on lurkin' 
 Things going to well the devil start workin 
 I see them coming from afar 
 I got my eyes open tough luck for y'all 
 Crush, Crush the wall 
 I'm still a young boy that drive all the grown folks right up the wall 
 I'm aware of the snakes 'cause they near 
 They plottin' to get me 
 I'm watching my peers 
 Bout time in a million 
 It's close man I swear 
 I feel it in the air and I'm order for them 
 I see them coming from afar 
 I got my eyes open I'm ready for war 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 I see them coming from afar 
 The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 I'm what it is I'm Macdola hype with a game to back 
 Spitting a big ticket number one in the track 
 Ease along, baby say ease the bar 
 My b's the door 
 Bout to take the game by storm 
 The one and only 
 Haters got nothing on me 
 I can feel the vibe 
 I see it in their eyes 
 They praying for my demise 
 They don't want to see me blow yo 
 Rather see me low low 
 Or I be on the floor yo 
 But no yo 
 I'm pull through this game of tug o' war 
 What you fellas fussing for 
 Maybe 'cause I'm grubbing more 
 Not unless I'm paying my dues 
 Don't hate me 
 A little hard work will get you here too 
 I got next, better yet I got now 
 Everybody got faith and yelling cause my hot style 
 86 the bullshit they don't want me hostile 
 I'ma reign supreme until the day I drop down 
 I see them coming from afar 
 I got my eyes open I'm ready for war 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 I see them coming from afar 
 The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 ... 
 I see them coming from afar 
 I got my eyes open I'm ready for war 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through 
 I see them coming from afar 
 The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar 
 When I fight mon' they know who we are 
 A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through
