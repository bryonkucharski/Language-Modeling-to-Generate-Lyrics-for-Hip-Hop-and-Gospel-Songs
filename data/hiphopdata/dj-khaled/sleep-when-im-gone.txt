(Intro: DJ Khaled) 
 About to change the game 
 DJ khaled! 
 We the best forever 
 Cash Money, Young Money 
 I'm for real about this shit 
 Let's go 
 (Hook: Cee Lo Green) 
 I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money 
 The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone (Gone) 
 I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay 
 Naps to my treasure, yay ay 
 (Time's on the side, whoa) 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 (Verse 1: Game) 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related 
 'Cause I'm the most slept on, and the most hated 
 Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle 
 Starin' at me in the club like I won't bust you 
 In the face with the spades, life is a card game 
 And I'm playin' spades, gamblin' with y'all change 
 Fuckin' basketball wives, while you at away games 
 Really fuckin' basketball wives, ain't gotta say names 
 Whole body tattered like a New York City freight train 
 Niggas get to barkin', put a bullet in the great dane 
 Try me, end up like why me? 
 Team full of animals, like I coach the heat 
 Four floor mansion, close to the beach 
 6 car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat 
 In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks 
 Flaggin' down the waitress, wavin' my Rolex 
 I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money 
 The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone (Gone) 
 I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay 
 Naps to my treasure, yay ay 
 (Time's on the side, whoa) 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 (Verse 2: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo, I don't survive the test of time doin' this shit so long 
 And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone 
 Look, a legend while I'm prime, and so current and they hate this 
 The streets classified me as another level of greatness 
 I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch 
 And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit 
 Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things 
 Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings 
 Watch it, I'm hearin' that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine 
 The piano soundin' beautiful and sad at the same time 
 The feelin' of a funeral, so study you niggas 
 Khaled, provide the theme music while I bury you niggas 
 See now there's no escaping the God, you better find a get away 
 'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day 
 Khaled, every time you know we gotta make 'em love it 
 And realize every thing is hotter when we touch it 
 I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money 
 The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone (Gone) 
 I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay 
 Naps to my treasure, yay ay 
 (Time's on the side, whoa) 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 (Verse 3: Game) 
 Ayo Khaled, let this shit breeze 
 It's poor lil' rich nigga, that's me 
 Smoke comin' out the sunroof, blowin' on hasheesh 
 Can't stop now, 'cause I'm in too deep 
 1.5 wide, every 2 weeks 
 Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out 
 Life is short, then please, my kids gon' ball out 
 They kids gon' ball out, 20 years from now, pullin' cars out 
 You gon' think cocaine gettin' hauled out 
 Ass gettin' chipped in, crystal meth gettin' dipped in 
 All cause you let a nigga slip in 
 Aftermath, '05, G-Unit, '06 
 Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip 
 Sittin' on the couch, smokin' up memories 
 Pourin' Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies 
 Fuck beef, nigga I ain't got the energy 
 Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy 
 I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money 
 The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone (Gone) 
 I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay 
 Naps to my treasure, yay ay 
 (Time's on the side, whoa) 
 Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone 
 Sleep when I'm gone
