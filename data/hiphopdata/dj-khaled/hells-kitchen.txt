Cole World... DJ Khaled! 
 Yeah, back from the dead 
 Like Michael Jackson in red jackets, with naps in my head 
 Who's white or black, it's a rare package 
 Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with these square rappers 
 My guest room's got plantinum plaques, and an air mattress 
 No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you 
 Watching you, learning you 
 Word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you 
 Sure the thought can occur to you 
 My next album flop, then I'm goin' pop, like Nelly 
 With tops dropped on convertible Porsches 
 Born Sinner, not burning no crosses 
 Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits 
 I gotta do somethin' 
 Fightin' depression I'm trying my nigga 
 But every time I think about it I'm cryin' my nigga 
 Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets 
 I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep 
 I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back 
 They love to hear black nigga count stacks, count stacks 
 Forty thousand in my pocket (You see it) 
 Another twenty on the way (You see it, ay) 
 I got a fist for a dollar (You see it, uh) 
 Five hundred for the Js (You see it, ay) 
 I get money out the ass (You see it) 
 I thought I'd never see the day (You see it, ay) 
 They put a price on my head (You see it) 
 But they don't ever have to pay (You see it, ay) 
 I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed 
 Cause heaven seems a million miles away 
 I dreamed of all the things that I would say 
 On that day 
 But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing 
 Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen 
 Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing 
 I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day, hey 
 Yeah 
 Omission's usually, an admission to guilt 
 Hari Kari yourself, all the way to the hilt 
 You get nothin', no love 
 Zip, zero, zilch 
 We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth 
 There's a Judas in every crew, concealed in a kiss 
 Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits 
 Fucks sake you niggas emanate a feminines traits 
 Bitch nigga when could never relate 
 Nah, cause man you niggas is birds 
 You learn that at bird school, or somethin' 
 You eaten that bird food, or somethin' 
 You sick with that bird flu, or somethin' 
 That's my word, cause every where I turn 
 When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name 
 And asking me for pics, there's something bout this game 
 It's somethin' for the bitches, it's somethin' for the bitches 
 Forty thousand in my pocket (You see it) 
 Another twenty on the way (You see it, ay) 
 I got a fist for a dollar (You see it, uh) 
 Five hundred for the Js (You see it, ay) 
 I get money out the ass (You see it) 
 I thought I'd never see the day (You see it, ay) 
 They put a price on my head (You see it) 
 But they don't ever have to pay (You see it, ay) 
 I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed 
 Cause heaven seems a million miles away 
 I dreamed of all the things that I would say 
 On that day 
 But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing 
 Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen 
 Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen 
 Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing 
 I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day, hey
