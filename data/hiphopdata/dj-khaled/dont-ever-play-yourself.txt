DJ Khaled 
 Put them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah 
 That's the definition of a major key alert 
 Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah 
 Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah 
 Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar) 
 So keep the movies in, stop actin' out 
 And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither 
 Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure 
 Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever 
 Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar 
 Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics 
 I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never) 
 Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic 
 Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it 
 You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic 
 Next thing is cremation or a casket 
 Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that 
 I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada 
 Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack 
 Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back 
 Either way I ain't never evil 
 Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em 
 Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing 
 You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason 
 First thing first don't ever play yourself, ever 
 Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself, never 
 Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself, it's me 
 Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself 
 See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off 
 Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs 
 Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish) 
 Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff 
 See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit 
 Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets 
 I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit 
 You niggas got fat while everybody starved 
 My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off 
 When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off 
 So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all 
 This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls 
 Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him 
 Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead) 
 Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league 
 Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key 
 Mami yellin' I'm the greatest 
 Back to back with the slow cum 
 In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her 
 Every night I meet a new wife 
 Now ask your wife what this dick like 
 Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee 
 Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID 
 Mami only listen to Romeo 
 Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo 
 Bout to let the cans go, whoa 
 Fuck your bitch and let your man's know, so 
 Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber 
 Only drivin' Uber 'cause I'm franchised in Cuba 
 This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline 
 Brons, Calabrini, niggas always tryna high five 
 Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce 
 Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk 
 Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin' 
 Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin' 
 Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins 
 Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins 
 Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny? 
 Pop you in your shit, brotha, now make room for the money 
 Move! 
 If you don't move, I'll beat a nigga past painful 
 Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful 
 I get this bread and shine like an angel 
 One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful 
 Thank you so much 
 I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas 
 I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (mountaintop) 
 Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas 
 Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas 
 I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do? 
 And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too 
 Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga? 
 You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga 
 Don't play yourself 
 Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket 
 Pray yourself, end in a basket 
 Hate yourself 'cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater 
 Or you could be you a leader for the people 
 You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter 
 Don't you ever play yourself 
 I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out 
 I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out 
 Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out 
 That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out 
 Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up 
 I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up 
 You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up 
 It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers 
 Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three 
 No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me 
 A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in 
 I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open 
 I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets 
 I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat 
 I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat 
 I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet 
 While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy 
 Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy 
 You gotta finish bigger than you start 
 Don't fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all 
 Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all 
 I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah 
 'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, that's all 
 Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car 
 Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus 
 Text back and told her, "Please be hammered so you can sex as my arm strong" 
 If Louisiana then tell her Texas 
 And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message 
 FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3 
 And two things you gotta be, new or lean 
 I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me 
 So never say my name in vain, 'cause bitch there's no arteries
