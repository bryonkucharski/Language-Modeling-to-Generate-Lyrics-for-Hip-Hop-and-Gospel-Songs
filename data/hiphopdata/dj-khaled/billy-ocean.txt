DJ Khaled! 
 From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore 
 Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores 
 Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure 
 Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean 
 More Billy's, more problems 
 We got too many ways to solve 'em 
 My life is like a movie that made the Oscars 
 Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean 
 I got my car back, I'm John Wick 
 The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts 
 The don's slick, some Billys we gon' get 
 Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut (Crack get 'em, uh) 
 Talkin' sports trades with bet guys 
 While sides cheat on their husbands, those be the best vibes 
 Satin grain on the hood of the car 
 Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars 
 You can get a taste for a flat out key 
 'Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3 
 Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera 
 More solid than gold bars, the Billy era 
 From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore 
 Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores 
 Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure 
 Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean 
 More Billy's, more problems 
 We got too many ways to solve 'em 
 My life is like a movie that made the Oscars 
 Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean 
 Hermes sweatsuits and S-Coupes 
 Fly around, NBA money in jets too 
 Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too 
 Shoulda been Billys in '92, line who? The shine's new 
 Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie 
 Sit back, Rocky and Groovie with the '9-2 
 Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers 
 A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures 
 Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love 
 Yeah we sit around and just drip bub', the homies get piff love 
 To all the realest ones and rich thugs 
 One, my hundred niggas, Billy, we gun on niggas 
 From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore 
 Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores 
 Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure 
 Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean 
 More Billy's, more problems 
 We got too many ways to solve 'em 
 My life is like a movie that made the Oscars 
 Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
