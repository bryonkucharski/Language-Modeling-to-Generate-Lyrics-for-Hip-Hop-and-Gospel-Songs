Never let me down 
 For the kings have decreed (bless thy soul) 
 Righteousness shall be 
 Show us thy love, oh 
 Have mercy upon thy soul 
 Never let me down, no man 
 Happened today like nothing 
 DJ Khaled! 
 I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share 
 All the help and the effort just to get me there 
 When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care 
 You believed in me, never forget you I swear 
 I'll always be strong, my character defines me 
 I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me 
 Temptation and ego can get you so wrong 
 A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from 
 I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul 
 With the riches of love forever 
 Happiness shine as a burning sun 
 It's a blooming blessing, hey 
 Let it flow, it's a pleasure 
 Hours upon hours searching for a better way out 
 And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers 
 Still just gotta look out 
 Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason 
 Put my trust in the Most High 
 And my prayers are so consistent, ah 
 Who would've thought it would be like this today? 
 Nothing but prayers lift up your head 
 Lion in the jungle, I tell ya 
 He who have been blessed... 
 Welcome to Grateful 
 Strength is strength, strength is strength 
 You realize and appreciate your blessings 
 Embrace your blessings from the heart 
 To express your gratitude from doing righteous deeds 
 Asahd, my son - I love you 
 Thank you God 
 I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me 
 Thank you, I'm so... 
 I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul 
 With the riches of love forever 
 Happiness shine as a burning sun 
 It's a blooming blessing, hey 
 Let it flow, it's a pleasure 
 Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out
