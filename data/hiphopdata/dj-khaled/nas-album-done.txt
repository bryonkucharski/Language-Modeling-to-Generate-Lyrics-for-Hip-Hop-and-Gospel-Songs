Classic, timeless, forever, iconic 
 DJ Khaled! 
 A divine leader 
 Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer 
 Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer 
 Ebony empress getter 
 Celebrity Apprentice a devil show 
 Big up to Africa, Mexico 
 Hennessy, margarita, venison eater 
 So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either 
 Don't be, relax me, it's only to the nasty 
 I'm just a phony assassin 
 A lot of niggas owe me, I'm a tax 'em 
 A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic 
 'Cause the rosary and gold flashy 
 Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code 
 Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco 
 Last time I checked I was still breathin' 
 My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season 
 To every baby on the album cover existin' 
 This trend I was settin' came to fruition 
 I'm assistin' to push the culture forward 
 To all my go supporters, go support us 
 Like a local black-owned grocery store 
 'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood 
 It's a dub on that 
 We get government aid 
 Spend it at their stores, sendin' their kids through college 
 We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects 
 So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets 
 The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it 
 My signature fade with the devil blade 
 That's a major key 
 I told her she smart and loyal, I like that 
 That's a major key 
 Start a label, run it, sign yourself 
 That's a major key 
 What Tony had on the table 
 It's like us, we a major key 
 Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson 
 Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe 
 It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately 
 I'm playin' chess with babies 
 Niggas is nursery 
 Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me 
 Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly 
 So official, come get this issue, some women crazy 
 I like a woman to show me wisdom 
 These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol 
 Y'all ain't meant to be played 
 Says the brother with the signature fade 
 Still paid, stackin', new stash 
 Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers 
 To computer hackers 
 Check the fashion in Monaco 
 Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats 
 Khaled called me when I was in album mode 
 So I put it on hold for the Major Key 
 My album done, niggas, wait and see 
 Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic 
 My signature fade with the devil blade 
 That's a major key 
 I told her she smart and loyal, I like that 
 That's a major key 
 Start a label, run it, sign yourself 
 That's a major key 
 What Tony had on the table 
 It's like us, we a major key
