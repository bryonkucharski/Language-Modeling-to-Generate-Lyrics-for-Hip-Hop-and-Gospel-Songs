I said all these niggas fuck-niggas 
 (Boosie Badazz, yeah, yeah) 
 And they said they fuck wit' you 
 (Uh-huh, fuck 'em, woo) 
 But really they don't fuck wit' you (Huh, no tussle) 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em (DJ Khaled) 
 And so I bought the Wraith on 'em (Wraith boys) 
 I still got the paper plates on 'em (Money boy, woo) 
 And if you think I'm playin' wit' you (Playin' wit' you) 
 I ride on you niggas (Yeah)

 Boosie Mandela, I am the people's choices 
 We can take it there, but I take it much farther 
 Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle 
 Why when I was gone, you ain't do nothing for my daughter? 
 Paper plate-living niggas hating 'cause I'm ballin' 
 Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled 
 You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call 
 We have no specific victims, we want all y'all 
 Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam 
 Plenty murder scenes 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em 
 G-O-R-R-I-double-L-E 
 It's levels to this shit like my nigga Meek say 
 DJ Khaled, look 
 I said all these niggas fuck-niggas 
 And they said they fuck wit' you 
 But really they don't fuck wit' you 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em 
 And so I bought the Wraith on 'em 
 I still got the paper plates on 'em 
 And if you think I'm playing wit' you

 All the bad bitches real niggas holler when we enter 
 Sky-Dweller looking like chilly in the winter 
 Twelve gauge Mossberg, that bitch look like a chopper 
 If my dogg burst so I hand it to my partner 
 Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor 
 All white head to toe looking like a kilo 
 Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell 
 What they said about my watch when I spoke to Gabriel 
 Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease 
 Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece 
 Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep 
 Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath 
 Ride on 'em 
 I said all these niggas fuck-niggas 
 And they said they fuck wit' you 
 But really they don't fuck wit' you 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em 
 And so I bought the Wraith on 'em 
 Still got the paper plates on 'em 
 And if you think I'm playing wit' you 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' em 
 Betting on a nigga I'mma go and get it 
 And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'mma go and hit it 
 These the laws that we live by 
 Same niggas that you're looking at the ones you getting slit by 
 Still moving how I wanna 
 For a brick whole clique getting left in a coma 
 White glove it's a deadly game 
 You gon' fuck top down say my name like Candyman 
 All I want is real estate 
 Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate 
 Niggas hating on me 
 But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me 
 I said all these niggas fuck-niggas 
 And they said they fuck wit' you 
 But really they don't fuck wit' you 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em 
 And so I bought the Wraith on 'em 
 I still got the paper plates on 'em 
 And if you think I'm playing wit' you 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 I ride on you niggas 
 So I advise you not to fuck wit' em
