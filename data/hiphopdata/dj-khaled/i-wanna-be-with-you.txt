It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you 
 It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you 
 If I adore you, I'mma give you that theory 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be where the commas will be 
 But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree 
 Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be 
 In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee 
 'Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips 
 And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx 
 And he's never with no other bitch, fronting like he's slick 
 'Cause it's levels to this shit and she could never be Nic 
 Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy 
 Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies 
 Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies 
 Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie 
 Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst 
 Ain't never been done, bitch I added this 
 Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists 
 'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin 
 Got a big billboard out in Madison 
 At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson 
 Got the .22 on me, and it's thin 
 Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston 
 You decide you'll be mine you can come inside 
 You the type that can make me prioritize 
 Hittin' my phone, it's all right 
 Hittin' my phone, it's all right 
 You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini 
 You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide? 
 I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, baby 
 Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy 
 Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy 
 Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 Everything you do is brand new 
 Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty 
 My hat bent like 'Uh!', my chain drip like water 
 Car paint like tar, I'mma sex her harder 
 Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it 
 Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real 
 My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years 
 Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal 
 On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light 
 That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine 
 White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain 
 Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla 
 Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur 
 Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy 
 Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy 
 Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 Everything you do is brand new 
 Suffering From Success 
 You witnessing greatness... 
 I'm the best that ever did it 
 I wanna be with you 
 (I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you) 
 (I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you)
