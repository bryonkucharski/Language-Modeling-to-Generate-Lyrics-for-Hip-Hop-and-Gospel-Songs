(Verse 1: Birdman) 
 Shinin', grindin' on the shine 
 Flippin' all the time 
 When we hustlin', Young Money gunnin' 
 Cash Money flippin', shit them every time 
 When we grindin' 'cause we gettin', flippin' the change range 
 And doin' different thangs, hittin' the same lanes 
 But flippin' didn't change 
 Yeah, higher then we ever been 
 More money, now more money, 'cause we ballin' in 
 (Hook: T-Pain) 
 You know I can't stop, I won't stop 
 I feel like everybody's trying to kill me 
 So I don't stop, till I'm on top 
 And God keeps telling me I will be 
 If you with me then salute, you know what to do 
 You know what to do 
 Put your hands up in the air 
 You can make it through 
 All you gotta do is 
 Put your hands up in the air 
 (Verse 2: Birdman) 
 Shinin' bright lights, hotter then them other lights 
 The real life flash mash on the same night 
 More money, now we brighter then we even been 
 Hundred thousand poppin' bottles, bitch we goin' in 
 Crystal lights, blowin' on that Khaled dro 
 Turkey bag, hundred thou on the marble floor 
 Rainbow, red bone with the triple color 
 Hurricane, make it rain, bitch every summer 
 (Verse 3: Birdman) 
 Yeah it's on deck, straps on deck 
 Sticks on deck, Stunna island, private jets 
 Put the house on Gin, and nigga we place the bet 
 From hundred G's to flippin' hundred, bitch we hit the liq' 
 High on the hill, the view above the falls 
 Smashin' in the field, 100 balls [?] 
 You know how we do it, bossin' up grand news 
 Uptown survivor, money really shoot
