Future let's get right to it 
 I don't play about my paper 
 (DJ Khaled!) 
 Sippin' my cup this muddy, muddy 
 When I fuck on these bitches no lovey-dovey 
 Got a flood on my wrist, it was mellow yellow 
 Had a flood on my wrist, it was yellow, mellow 
 Check on that chick out the melo 
 I got that white on that white on the Panamera 
 Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella 
 See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal 
 I put the racks and the goons on 'em 
 I got a MAC with a drum on 'em 
 Soon as the dry hit we laid on 'em 
 Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em 
 Actavis, Actavis wait on it 
 Actavis, Actavis wait on it 
 Percocet roxies and we stay on 'em 
 Percocet roxies we stay on 'em 
 Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me 
 I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't 
 Rich nigga rituals, Royce Royces and residuals 
 Residue in my residence, Revinue was so plentiful 
 Rumors Rozay still be runnin' with all you criminals 
 Ransom notes and repercussions follow my ridicule 
 Private charters to Bahamas as I send them through 
 Two new bitches up in Memphis that's just for summer school 
 A nigga networth at an all-time high 
 I play for keeps, you just ran cross my mind 
 I own all the things that these niggas plot for 
 Know they hatin', still resistin', go and cop more 
 She takin' off her clothes, know that's for a hot boy 
 Pistols in the lobby, honey on the top floor 
 Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me 
 I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 Sippin' my cup this muddy, muddy 
 When I fuck on these bitches no lovey-dovey 
 Got a flood on my wrist, yellow, yellow 
 Had a flood on my wrist, it was was yellow, yellow 
 Check on that chick out the melo 
 I got that white on that white on the Panamera 
 Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella 
 See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal 
 I put the racks and the goons on 'em 
 I got a Mac with a drum on 'em 
 Soon as the dry hit we laid on 'em 
 Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em 
 Actavis, Actavis wait on it 
 Actavis, Actavis wait on it 
 Percocet roxies and we stay on 'em 
 Percocet roxies we stay on 'em 
 Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me 
 I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 All of these diamonds I copped 
 All of these watches I copped 
 All of these Bentleys we coppin' 
 All of these Ghosts and I copped it 
 All of the Phantoms I copped it 
 All of the cribs we're coppin' 
 All of the bitches we copped it 
 All of these bitches we coppin' 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper 
 They know I don't play about that paper, yeah
