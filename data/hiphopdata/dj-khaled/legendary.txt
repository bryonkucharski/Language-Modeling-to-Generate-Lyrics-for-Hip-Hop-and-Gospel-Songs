Keyshia Cole: 
 You know, I've seen some things... 
 It's important to stay strong 
 Wassup DJ Khaled? 
 It's your girl KC! 
 If not they, then who? 
 Can carry on the weight of this world? 
 If not they, then who? 
 Will make sure all the people know how it feels 
 To be legendary! 
 Chris Brown: 
 Baby don't cry no more 
 'Cause I'm here to show you the way 
 I know you got some fight in you 
 So don't make losing so easy 
 (Hook: Keyshia Cole) 
 Everybody's gonna fight 
 And everybody's gonna fall 
 But the ones that get up 
 Are always the strongest 
 Oh I can't imagine if I 
 Never went through nothing 
 I wouldn't be a fighter 
 And I wouldn't last the longest 
 If not they, then who? 
 Can carry on the weight of this world? 
 If not they, then who? 
 Will make sure all the people know how it feels 
 To be legendary! 
 Chris Brown: 
 Legends are born and created 
 Nothing's free, so I take it 
 It takes the determination! (We goin' in) 
 The nation! 
 (Hook: Keyshia Cole) 
 Everybody's gonna fight 
 And everybody's gonna fall 
 But the ones that get up 
 Are always the strongest 
 Oh I can't imagine if I 
 Never went through nothing 
 I wouldn't be a fighter 
 And I wouldn't last the longest 
 If not they, then who? 
 Can carry on the weight of this world? 
 If not they, then who? 
 Will make sure all the people know how it feels 
 To be legendary! 
 Ne-Yo: 
 I promise I'm a do it better than 
 Anybody's ever seen. 
 That I will be everything that everybody told me 
 I would never be 
 Got my feet on the ground, the wind at my back 
 My head to the sky. (Won't stop now!) 
 No, not ever 
 You can see in my eyes 
 I will be legendary 
 If not they, then who? 
 Can carry on the weight of this world? 
 If not they, then who? 
 Will make sure all the people know how it feels 
 To be legendary! 
 DJ Khaled: 
 I remember when they told me no! 
 I looked them right in their eyes and I told 'em yes! 
 Don't let nobody stop your dreams! 
 Keep winning! 
 Rise to the top! 
 Keep your head up! 
 Young world! The world is yours! 
 We the best! YMCMB
