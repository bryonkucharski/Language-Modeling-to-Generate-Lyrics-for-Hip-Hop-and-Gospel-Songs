This shit's special 
 This shit's special 
 DJ Khaled! 
 And if I cry two tears for her 
 That will be the most that I would give to her 
 She left me stranded in my nightmares 
 Taking pictures of my memories she right there 
 Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep 
 Always on my mind so I can't sleep 
 She used to tell me she was all mine 
 Now the only way I see the broad is online 
 I'm doing drugs trying to feel you 
 I'm killing me trying to kill you 
 I built my whole life around you 
 I thought I found it all when I found her 
 Shopping sprees on whatever coast 
 How'd you really feel, I may never know 
 And as I ride through these streets 
 With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I... 
 Realise, some things never change 
 Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same man 
 Fuck love, 'cause she don't live here 
 I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here 
 Hip Hop heartbreaks, straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes 
 Got a nigga feeling like I up and left ya 
 Get away now you all in the lectures 
 Being studied by the college's professors 
 Now I regret the day I met ya 
 I'll be the first one to say it 
 She ain't the one you want to play with 
 I fucked Hip Hop 
 And if I cry two tears for her 
 That would be the most that I can give to her 
 I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr Dre, O'Shea 
 And a host of those who passed away 
 Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz 
 You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit 
 Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit 
 She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm 
 But the Source to her heart is love, word up, right on 
 You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her World Star 
 Kissing on her belly, trick on her and onyx 
 Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic 
 But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her 
 She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me 
 For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet 
 She took me to places I would have never saw without her 
 And she took me from my girl powder 
 I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name 
 Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James 
 Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari 
 Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry 
 But I tried her, used to ride her, for dollars not the fame 
 She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean 
 She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream 
 Notice she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed 
 "She's dead!", and everybody took it out on Nasty 
 I was just looking out for my music family 
 Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours 
 You can have her she's a muthafucking whore 
 I fuck Hip Hop 
 And if I cry two tears for her 
 That will be the most that I would give to her
