Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star 
 I'm a come after you, I seen you from afar 
 When she walked in I was standin' by the bar 
 Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard 
 She so wet I make that pussy fall 
 Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car 
 Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow 
 The way you walk I thought you was a model 
 I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom 
 I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip 
 First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael 
 Yeah, I write but I consider myself an idol 
 Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you 
 Certain shit I just gon' do because I'm prideful 
 Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you 
 It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you 
 Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart 
 Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?

 Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart 
 She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad 
 Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard 
 Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow 
 Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart 
 One thing about that sack boy, I'm a run it up 
 Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up 
 Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce 
 Really Gotti here, he ain't got it, I'm a motherfuckin' boss 
 'Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelings 
 Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin' 
 To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this 
 Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they toxic 
 And it ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon 
 One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan 
 Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks 
 Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz 
 Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart

 Tried to make her mine

 See you on your Oprah gram 
 We can hustle, both can shine 
 She buy the payment I knew that 
 My mind's telling me don't do that 
 My dick hard so I flew that 
 That fake love, we grew that 
 Take her for that mac and let me see the real 
 Pussy off that mansion I can see your grill 
 Fuck the blogs, baby chill

 Fuckin' with her mind so much it started fuckin' with her heart 
 And I just play my part 
 I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start 
 These hoes'll tear your heart apart
