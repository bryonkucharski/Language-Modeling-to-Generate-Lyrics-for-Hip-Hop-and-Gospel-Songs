(DJ Khaled) 
 They doubted me all my life 
 Now it's victory 
 (DJ khaled!) 
 (John Legend) 
 Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost 
 I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss 
 I'll put it all on the line 
 In a hustler's state of mind 
 I'm gonna make history 
 Just so we can claim victory (Victory) 
 Oh, victory (Victory) 
 (Nasir!) 
 (Nas) 
 Speedboats, three tokes and pass it 
 Grass lit, hittin' slopes in Aspen 
 No coat, just an oath to stay thorough till we back to ashes 
 Driven in fly sedans to the MGM Grand 
 Picture lots of sand, two blondes, implants 
 Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand 
 A modest man, aware of any counter-scam 
 Palm trees, magnum Don Ps, LV monograms 
 Hottest girls flew from Rio 
 Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido 
 Sex so strong, without the E, though 
 Hollow threats, we don't see those 
 Higher death toll whenever we roll 
 That process is pivotal 
 My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew 
 Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house 
 Till it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out 
 Contemplatin', there is no bond with Satan 
 Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin 
 For my hustlers, here's some motivation 
 He who has begun is half done, why you waitin'? 
 I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress 
 It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death 
 I know some niggas from Astoria 
 That'll cut your daughter up 
 Like I used to cut a quarter up 
 Makin' all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks 
 Kill all you fucks, easy 
 I be on the golf cart, sleepy 
 Y'all beneath me 
 Y'all be at the pawn shop, pawnin' watches 
 Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas 
 Say you killin' Pablo? Impossible 
 Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best 
 Unfulfilled promises 
 I feel intelligence is my wealth 
 However, how enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers 
 See me at the Oscars, lookin' dreamy, hood opulent 
 Means esoteric, how I wore it 
 Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is 
 Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just 
 We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit 
 Niggas actin' thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit 
 Ha, for that victory we will kill shit 
 Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit 
 (Khaled!) 
 Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost 
 I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss 
 I'll put it all on the line 
 In a hustler's state of mind 
 I'm gonna make history 
 Just so we can claim victory (Victory) 
 Oh, victory (Victory) 
 Just so we can claim victory 
 Oh, victory 
 Victory 
 Just so we can claim victory
