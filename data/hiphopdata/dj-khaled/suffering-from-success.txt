The price of fame, shit real 
 Fuck fame, (man fuck this shit) 
 Fuck the game 
 DJ Khaled 
 Got too many racks on me, I can't even go to sleep 
 Just to get 'em out V.I.P, I'mma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you) 
 I'm sufferin' 
 I'm sufferin' from success 
 I'm sufferin' 
 Ace Hood 
 Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain 
 Fuck my watch, you can have that ring 
 Keep my whips, you can have that fame 
 So stressed out, I'm going insane 
 Young nigga can't even sleep at night 
 All this money I done seen in life 
 More cash bring more haters 
 Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice 
 'Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy 
 If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord 
 Please don't make a nigga do that 
 Please don't make a nigga do that 
 You don't know what the fuck I been through 
 Plus my lawyer texting me too, boy my baby momma be trippin' 
 Talking bout child support, I can't do it 
 I don't trust nobody but God, all these foreign's parked in my yard 
 Swear last night I swimmed in that money, then woke up in a million dollar car 
 Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed 
 Please somebody pray for me, I'm suffering from success 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Got too many racks on me, I can't even go to sleep 
 Just to get 'em out V.I.P, I'mma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you) 
 I'm sufferin' 
 I'm sufferin' from success 
 I'm sufferin' 
 My momma told me when I was a little bity boy, I was blessed 
 Frustrated 
 Nigga fuck that car 
 Fuck these ho's 
 Fuck these millions 
 Fuck your feelings 
 I'm sufferin, I'm sufferin 
 Fuck this house, fuck this condo 
 Fuck these models, fuck these bottles 
 I'm sufferin', I'm sufferin' 
 Got too many racks on me, I can't even go to sleep 
 Just to get 'em out V.I.P, I'mma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you) 
 I'm sufferin' 
 I'm sufferin' from success 
 I'm sufferin'
