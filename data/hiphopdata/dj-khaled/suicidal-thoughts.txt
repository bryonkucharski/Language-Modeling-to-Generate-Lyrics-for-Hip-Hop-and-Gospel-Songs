 So mi say be careful a di road dem weh yuh walk 
 Some a carry drugs and some a dem have dutty heart 
 Chat in front yuh face, dem wah fi kill you when you pass 
 You dem woulda lost 
 So it's best if you nuh talk

 Touch Gullyside guns smoke and guns bark 
 All a mi enimies dead off 
 So suicial, first dem ever see this

 From New York to California 
 To Arizona dem haffi set we free 
 Old Gangalee

 Show the light just let me know

 You know, hands in the sky if you with me 
 It's the gullyside life you know 
 You now... you know... 
 So suicidal, first dem ever see this 
 Gangsta for life, the realist
