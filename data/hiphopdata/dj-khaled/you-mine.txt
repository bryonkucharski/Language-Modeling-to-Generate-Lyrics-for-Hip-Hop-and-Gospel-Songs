You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 Bring your body here 
 You've been workin' out lookin' so right 
 So it's only right 
 Yeah you know how we get 
 It's growin' up, I know you down to ride 
 You know what's on tonight 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You know when I'm opposite of you it drives me so fuckin' crazy 
 Got my head between your legs 
 Kissin' on your favorite places 
 Girl you make a mess 
 How you got me makin' sticky faces 
 You like to get gone off that liq 
 One more shot, one more sip, you get so into it, girl 
 I bet the neighbors, bet they know us 
 Pussy bomb when you you blow up, girl 
 And other niggas can't do nothin' for ya 
 I pledge you mine, you know you keep me focused 
 Said them other niggas stop wasting their time 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 Bring your body here 
 You've been workin' out lookin' so right 
 So it's only right 
 Yeah you know how we get 
 It's growin' up, I know you down to ride 
 You know what's on tonight 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 Dress it up and make it real for me 
 Then tell me you gone kill for me 
 Then tell me you gone steal for me 
 Then tell me you gone steal for me 
 I just said walk in the mall 
 Like you're Puffy then I say gimme the Total 
 I went to Harlem and get me a Spanish bitch 
 She dress like a mannequin 
 I went to Baltimore, got me a ghetto bitch 
 'Cause I've been livin' so lavishly 
 She fuck me good, she roll up my blunts 
 She even hang round all my savages 
 I put my time in 
 Even got the Rollie off her like Uncle May 
 I know it's love, I know it's love 
 'Cause she hang around all my shooters 
 I walked in the club, I walked in the club 
 I told that bitch hold on the Ruger 
 Even I'm gangster nigga, love ya like Larry Hoover 
 I just sent her off to shop her daughter in the Uber 
 She know the shit that I told her some on the realest ever been told 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 Bring your body here 
 You've been workin' out lookin' so right 
 So it's only right 
 Yeah you know how we get 
 It's growin' up, I know you down to ride 
 You know what's on tonight 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine 
 You mine 
 It's We The Best Music 
 For life
