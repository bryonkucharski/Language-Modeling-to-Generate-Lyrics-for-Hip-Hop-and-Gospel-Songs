I know I said Nas album done 
 We the Best Music! 
 But we got one more to do first 
 Straight up 
 DJ Khaled! 
 150 stack it all in my Gucci jacket 
 50 more in the Goyard, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got the mansion on the island 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got them bitches flyin' private 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Foreign bitches and they wildin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 100 mil', keep on pilin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me 
 Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger 
 No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas 
 Or so we thought speedin' through life like 
 The speed of sound - what your life like? 
 Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser 
 She not askin' questions 
 Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin' 
 Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail 
 For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck 
 I gave myself a good hand 
 Probably ran through a hundred million 
 Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya 
 A hundred million before you could ever spot grays 
 Chili Fritos in the helicopter 
 Money can't get that ghetto out'cha 
 150, stack it all in my Gucci jacket 
 50 more in the Goyard, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got the mansion on the island 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got them bitches flyin' private 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Foreign bitches and they wildin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 100 mil', keep on pilin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 Watch out for insecure niggas 
 They take your soul out your body, they not secure 
 I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards 
 Resort to violent reactions 
 That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers 
 Afraid they moments have past 'em 
 It's all different hustles (Straight up!) 
 Niggas movin' bricks 
 Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks 
 Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics 
 Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb? 
 All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep!) 
 43, morbidly ambiguous, you serious? 
 Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this 
 Out of New York's biggest and richest 
 I'm the template, low-key the busiest 
 The game chose me, deal with it 
 So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic 
 But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right 
 So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature 
 Here's another appetizer 
 Khaled, we did it again, let Travis take us higher! 
 150 stack it all in my Gucci jacket 
 50 more in the Goyard, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah yah yah yah yah yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got the mansion on the island 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Got them bitches flyin' private 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Foreign bitches and they wildin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 100 mil', keep on pilin' 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 It's secured, it's secured 
 Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah 
 A hundred mil', keep on pilin' 
 It's Nasir and Travis and Khaled 
 That's right: Khaled Khaled
