Miami! Dade County! Let's ride! 
 I'm from Miami, bitch, yeah, that's Miami streets 
 And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat 
 Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat 
 Let's party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets 
 I'm no holds barred, baby, I'm gung ho 
 They sayin', "Girl, you ain't Jamaican, accent's got to go" 
 And I say, "Hell no, hell no" 
 I got Jamaica in my lungs, it's that good hydro 
 I got that Barbee flow, I'm feelin' irie 
 Party, work and chill on the beach all day 
 Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood 
 Got my toes in the sand and my God is the Sun 
 I'm shakin' up the game, trying to test my luck 
 Living life everyday by what comes up 
 Yeah, I'm working on some things, getting my weight up 
 I'm Helen Keller to the hate, I'm sayin', "What?, what?, what?" 
 I'm shakin' up the game, trying to test my luck 
 Living life everyday by what comes up 
 Yeah, I'm working on some things, getting my weight up 
 I'm Helen Keller to the hate, I'm sayin', "What?, what?, what?" 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh 
 We in that heat wave, where people ain't phased 
 Workin' to get paid, this town, they don't play 
 The girlies like, "Yay", they like the heart race 
 White girl on a white girl's face, and oh-oh-oh 
 We do it for the thrills, thrills, thrills 
 We got enough bills, bills, bills 
 So keep poppin' them pills, pills, pills 
 I'm chillin' in my booth, feet up, V.I.P 
 Bring my girls to the damn party 
 Bro, don't touch me, I got my own money 
 If you want a drink for free, show my girls your body 
 I'm shakin' up the game, trying to test my luck 
 Living life everyday by what comes up 
 Yeah, I'm working on some things, getting my weight up 
 I'm Helen Keller to the hate, I'm sayin', "What?, what?, what?" 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh 
 My town likes to party all of the time 
 All of the time, take me down to Prime 
 Give me a steak, if it's bloody, that's fine 
 Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine 
 Let me clear my throat, uh (yeah, yeah) 
 Have mercy, babe, I hope you don't mind, mind 
 I'm on a fucking boat, uh (yeah, yeah) 
 And I'm thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne 
 I'm shakin' up the game, trying to test my luck 
 Living life everyday by what comes up 
 Yeah, I'm working on some things, getting my weight up 
 I'm Helen Keller to the hate, I'm sayin', "What?, what?, what?"
