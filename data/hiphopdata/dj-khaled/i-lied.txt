I'mma lie for my dawg I'mma ride 
 Just know I'mma lie 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking

 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 And I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth 
 And I got up on that podium and lied 
 Then the coppers swore to tell the truth nothing but the whole truth 
 And he got up on that podium and cried 
 Said I tried to take his life 
 And the judge ain't take my side 
 'Cause when you black that risk is high to beat that case against them odds 
 Against them guys, with your last bit of money for your lawyer 
 My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner 
 They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer 
 Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor 
 But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water 
 Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us They caught us 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Only swear by a law so when approached by them folks 
 I spit the truth when I swore under oath 
 I lied, I lied 
 Shit, 'cause I don't take the stand on niggas 
 I rather give it to that man up close 
 Blocka, blocka 
 I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more 
 See you when they free you 'cause 'cause I ain't coming back no more 
 Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back on fourth 
 Knowing if a nigga violate that I be back in court 
 Reside in somebody's federal estate 
 Niggas jumping on your case is worst than first 48 
 I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told 
 Come on a pill and give a nigga a will 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 It was we vs. them vs. three then ten 
 Swore I'd never read again but I lied, I lied 
 Now the package is enormous 
 And that come with informants 
 We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us 
 We just being hard headed 
 Disregarding the drop 
 Them they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot 
 Found six p's of piffy a little under fifty 
 That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty 
 And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me 
 I miss my goddaughter I wonder if she miss me 
 Birthdays and Christmas I ain't never missed it 
 Her dad is my brother I love him from a distance 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking 
 I lied, I lied, I lied 
 Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer 
 I lied, I lied, I lied
