You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise 
 You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high 
 Do it, do it, I'mma fuckin' do it 
 These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it 
 Middle finger to 'em all, I'mma make 'em pay 
 PSA for any nigga standin' in the way 
 You don't want these problems, you don't, you don't want these problems 
 You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems 
 Oh God! I tell 'em nigga you don't want these problems 
 You don't, you don't want these problems, you don't want these problems 
 Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana 
 Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom 
 Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda 
 Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example 
 Never baptized, as I walk through the fires 
 The pain and the flame never match my desires 
 Crucified 'cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic 
 On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend 
 Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker 
 Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say "fuck 'em" 
 Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool 
 My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool 
 Do it, do it, I'mma fuckin' do it 
 These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it 
 Middle finger to 'em all, I'mma make 'em pay 
 PSA for any nigga standin' in the way 
 You don't want these problems, you don't, you don't want these problems 
 You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems 
 I said "han!" That's what the title say 
 'Cause I'm rich, homie, it's why you feel some kind of way 
 She threw the pussy and I caught it, presidential by 40 
 That drop hit from Europe, that coupe got deported 
 I turn coke boy to that corporate money, big choppa, I'm walkin' funny 
 Money talk but you ain't talkin' money, you ain't even got no corporate money 
 Haaaaaaan! Whip game proper, I'mma make it work 
 Versace, nigga know who did it first 
 We the best, Khaled tried to told yah 
 True! You just second best, Kelly Rowland (hahaha, I'm just playin' babe) 
 Uh, renegade like Em and Jay 
 VIP section, started out from section 8 
 Arm and Hammer, I be armed with the hammer 
 If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas 
 Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly 
 They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee 
 You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise 
 You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high 
 I stay jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma 
 I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma 
 These niggas don't want no drama 
 These niggas don't want no problems 
 These niggas don't want no beef 
 Have 'em walkin' out with that choppa 
 These norm niggas don't play that 
 They murk somethin', I'll tell you that 
 200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak 
 We catch cases, don't say jack 
 Don't talk work 'cause they tape that 
 Don't sell the work where we lay at 
 And don't spend the bread you can't make back, no 
 Rest in peace 
 I'mma start murderin' and bodyin' beats 
 Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast 
 And I'm laughin' at people who try to compete 
 Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me 
 I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be 
 Claimin' you wantin' these problems 
 Tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech 
 My sanctuary's that cemetery 
 My choppa, named it "Obituary" 
 Act up, Tyler Perry 
 Boy you sweeter than February 
 Real nigga, I define that 
 You don't even need no dictionary 
 You ain't even 'bout that life 
 So these shooters with me ain't necessary 
 Do it, do it, I'mma fuckin' do it 
 These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it 
 Middle finger to 'em all, I'mma make 'em pay 
 PSA for any nigga standin' in the way 
 You don't want these problems, you don't, you don't want these problems
