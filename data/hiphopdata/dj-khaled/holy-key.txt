This is, this is... 
 Doing what I gotta do 
 What up though? 
 We the best music... 
 I guess I'm on my Don shit 
 What that mean? 
 I'mma go 
 DJ Khaled 
 Straight up, late nights mixed with early days 
 It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates 
 Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break 
 These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man 
 Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it 
 Realize the energy you give is what you manifested 
 So understand we positive as could be 
 The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats 
 Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach 
 Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in 
 Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating 
 If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan 
 Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers 
 You know it's true, bitch I need respect due 
 Now or later, either way I'mma take it 
 Just like it's fuckin' taxes 
 No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch 
 Lately I been living life in detachment 
 I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions 
 We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting 
 Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion 
 Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies 
 Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body 
 Niggas over stressing, we under investigation 
 Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist 
 Beat your ass until you purple 
 They can't even tell what your race is 
 Doctor King meet Dr. Dre 
 Except this doctor lost all his patience 
 Have you tied up in a basement 
 With you and your partner facing adjacent 
 Until you deposit payment or reparations 
 If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me 
 It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key (the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...) 
 And I'ma celebrate it for a long time 
 The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine 
 Surrounded by my angels and we all shine 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy key 
 And I'ma celebrate it for a long time 
 The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine 
 Surrounded by my angels and we all shine 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy key 
 Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh) 
 Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on) 
 Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings 
 Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was 
 I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back 
 I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that 
 I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate 
 Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake 
 The universe and the heavens work in my DNA 
 Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA 
 The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit 
 Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness 
 Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again 
 The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in 
 The big money, the fast cars, my life produced 
 The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube 
 So what you look up to? 
 Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches 
 Sources with designer thing 
 Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me 
 Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed 
 Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed 
 Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need 
 Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee 
 Flesh and poison the point is the reason 
 You won't die in peace 
 Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally 
 I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me 
 Tape recording my voices and tweak it 
 Let's play hide and seek 
 War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least 
 I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast 
 I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD 
 Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need 
 Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration 
 But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix 
 And I'ma celebrate it for a long time 
 The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine 
 Surrounded by my angels and we all shine 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy key 
 And I'ma celebrate it for a long time 
 The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine 
 Surrounded by my angels and we all shine 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy key 
 Holy, Holy key, holy
