 Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop 
 He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot 
 Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks 
 But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodal blocks 
 Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes 
 Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "go Mets!" 
 I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad 
 Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags 
 Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night

 I'ma do that favor, drippin' flavor in the two piece 
 I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie 
 Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi 
 Still in the trap but like my bitches bougie 
 Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me little mama 
 I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover 
 You want watches, new Versaces, you want Céline 
 Top back, dreamin' money ain't a ting 
 Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway 
 Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace 
 Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down 
 Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now 
 Take you shopping in other places that I won't name 
 First time your friends really got the see Balmain 
 20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes 
 We the best and I told you this back in '05

 Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind? 
 Oh, just in case you need me 
 I don't mind 
 Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do, tell them what to do 
 When you see a bad bitch in front of you 
 Assume the position 
 I'm just tryna get to know ya
