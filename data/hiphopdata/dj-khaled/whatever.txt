Hide the money and ran outta room, yeah 
 I tried to hide the money and ran outta room 
 I tried to hide the money and ran outta room

 Money on your head, you might get hit up today 
 You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke 
 In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone 
 My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater 
 I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects 
 I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever 
 I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin' 
 I, got my bitches down for whatever 
 (I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever! 
 (I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever! 
 (Geek!) 
 Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever 
 I ran that shit up through the roof 
 Young nigga ran that shit up for his mother 
 Buy her everything and I got proof 
 Up, designer fit, ain't known to buy it 
 And I done whipped every tire 
 With the brake pad, "Mello Yello", catch up 
 Ring me up like your pop-pop, whatever you need to 
 I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe, keep up! 
 That V-12 'bout to heat up, grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt 
 The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up 
 Got the Tommy tucked, ay 
 I toss that shit up like a spray, watch it spill on the clothes 
 I soak that shit up when they told me "Don't matter, boss won" 
 I suspended these bitches and I subpoenaed these niggas 
 To see who was real 
 I supported my bank account and I wouldn't tell you the account 
 Money on your head, you might get hit up today 
 You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke 
 In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone 
 My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater 
 I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects 
 I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever 
 I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'

 Maybach Music 
 DIamonds all on my fingers, misses still miscellaneous 
 Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari, residencies out in Vegas 
 Smoking like Calvin Broadus, blueberry with the big homie 
 Idols becoming rivals, down to die for my survival 
 Fell in love with the money, she at the spot every Sunday 
 Loyalty's what I lust, how I measure my woman 
 Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face 
 DJ Khaled my blood, got several M's in my safe 
 Money on your head, you might get hit up today 
 You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke 
 In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone 
 My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater 
 I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects 
 I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever 
 I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'

 2 Chainz 
 Watch me break down bales, residue on scales 
 Yeah, I had the girls sick, man I cure like nails 
 Competition might fail, repetition might sell 
 Dirty kitchen, dirty dishes, dirty bitches, oh well 
 Foreign whip rider, lobster on my rider, uh 
 You can get the platter, uh, I put my money up 
 You gon' need a ladder, work, no acrobatics 
 Work, no calisthenics, my dick be acting stingy 
 My check be acting boujee, my car got all the groupies 
 I bought a new Rolex now my old Rolex tryna sue me 
 Fashion on exotic, pistol on regardless 
 Bitches look like Barbie 
 Ricky Bobby on my trolly 
 Tryna set a bando on fire 
 I'm just tryna get you so higher 
 Money coming in, we get flyer 
 You must be tryna wife her like Tiger 
 Money on your head, you might get hit up today 
 You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke 
 In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone 
 My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater 
 I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects 
 I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
