 Full suit a Louie V 
 Bare gyal inna the vehic's

 Drive out the truck 
 Drive out the car 
 Ride out the bike 
 Gyal cock up pon the back a wah mi like 
 Load up mi cup 
 Gimmi a spliff 
 Gimmi a light 
 Champagne pop, fly like a kite 
 Mi just get a new gyal 
 And seh call up you crew gyal 
 Mi and mi dawgs 
 Dem a gyallis usual 
 How wi do gyal deal with it crucial 
 Real boss, have papers fi burn 
 Holiday weekend, tables a turn 
 Most of your money straight like perm 
 Hotel presidential suite confirm 
 A wah wi waan

 And a little bit a grabba leaf 
 Full suit a Louie V 
 Bare gyal inna the vehic's

 Then you no si how dem yah gyal yah stand up 
 Batty cock out and dem a push up stomach 
 And the whole place tun up when the big Benz come up 
 College gyal she dem love mi swag 
 Scream off stage when mi throw mi rag 
 Mi no haffi brag 
 But mi know mi bad 
 Trap lord fi the gully God 
 Trap lord, trap lord 
 Wi ever fresh wi no stale a road 
 Trap lord, trap lord 
 Every ship and every plane a load
