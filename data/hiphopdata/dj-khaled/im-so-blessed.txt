 DJ Khaled 
 Yeah 
 Oh, oh, ooh, no 
 Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed) 
 I got the Lord on my shoulders 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 Ain't got no stress (Ain't got no stress) 
 My people with me they celebratin' the life 
 We livin' life (We livin' life) 
 Now sing it with me 
 If you've been working hard 
 If you believe in God 
 Sing it with me 
 Can nothing stop me now 
 Yeah, yellin' fuck a 9 to 5 boy 
 Even if I gotta work from 9 to 9 boy 
 I'm self made, self paid and I got my city watching 
 They threw me in the game 
 I threw up numbers like an auction 
 'Cause I do it, do it, do it 
 Like it's no other option 
 Fat asses, big bottles 
 When I'm around they both get poppin' 
 I talk about girls and money 
 Too much I admit, way too much girls 
 Too much money, those 2 things that don't exist 
 And I think It's so impressive I'm riding in the back 
 Young and black 'cause I'm chauffeured and not 'cause I'm arrested 
 Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression 
 Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off 
 Showing her blessings 
 Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed) 
 I got the Lord on my shoulders 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 Ain't got no stress (Ain't got no stress) 
 My people with me they celebratin' the life 
 We livin' life (We livin' life) 
 Now sing it with me 
 If you've been working hard 
 If you believe in God 
 Sing it with me 
 Can nothing stop me now 
 I wonder what the haters got to say now 
 They mad I'm on top of my game and they down 
 I'm always repping for my gang I stay down 
 Ain't gotta go back to my hood 'cause they 'round 
 And the niggas that's next to me it's all the niggas that stress with me 
 I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own 
 So to me that's destiny 
 If anybody got a problem I just tell 'em to get on their grind 
 Try to to see as much checks as me 
 And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest 
 A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us 
 They showin' us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us 
 We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us 
 They screaming my name, I'm repping my city it's me who they proud of 
 So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us 
 Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed) 
 I got the Lord on my shoulders 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 I'm all right (I'm all right) 
 Ain't got no stress (Ain't got no stress) 
 My people with me they celebratin' the life 
 We livin' life (We livin' life) 
 Now sing it with me 
 If you've been working hard 
 If you believe in God 
 Sing it with me 
 Can nothing stop me now 
 Been hated on, I been doubted 
 Been talked about and mistreated 
 Still put in the work that I needed 
 Now I'm living the things that I'm dreaming 
 Got my mama straight and my daughter good 
 And my team right 'cause we eating 
 Been broke before and now its open doors 
 I got the dopest flow and they seen it 
 God keep away all them demons 
 Been patient dog I've been lenient 
 Been holding out I've been fiending 
 Long as God with me don't need 'em 
 When you winning everybody want a dap up 
 Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up 
 I don't really give a fuck I'ma go hard 
 No stress, couple cars in the front yard 
 We the best be the logo, getting money with a mogul 
 Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door 
 Top down so blast it, its yolo 
 One time form the XO

 Fied No lie nigga day know 
 From the bottom to the top only Lord knows 
 Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed) 
 I got the Lord on my shoulders
