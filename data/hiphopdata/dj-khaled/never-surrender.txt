Keep your circle tight 
 Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no) 
 DJ Khaled! 
 Gotta be careful who you trusting 
 Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling 
 Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg 
 All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all 
 You fuck with dude, he your day one 
 Almost had it all then the day comes 
 When they walking through your house with the strap out 
 Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah) 
 Bright lights down the hallways 
 Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay) 
 They say that every dog's got a day coming 
 It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing 
 Eyes wide shut like you looking at me 
 Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy 
 But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach 
 The homie didn't keep it one hundred 
 The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect 
 Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin' fuck that (fuck, that) 
 For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga) 
 Entire families these motherfuckers ghost you 
 Smoke you, was it worth what the life was? 
 Just prepared for the payback because it strikes 'cause 
 Was it worth what that life was? 
 Prepare for the payback when it strikes 'cause 
 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around 
 Cold world, cold world 
 Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable 
 He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to 
 The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to 
 To really figure out what he said will take a year or two 
 Family over everything, skills over politics 
 He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it 
 Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces 
 Betrayal is worse than death in most cases 
 The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist 
 Multiple shots to the face, No chasers 
 Mad 'cause you blew up quick and you excited 
 Your man that you grew up with get you indicted 
 This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go 
 Found out at the trial they got audio and video 
 Shit don't always happen how you plan it 
 Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is 
 You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas 
 That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas 
 You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure 
 You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more 
 He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war 
 Even had a crack spot together, the first floor 
 Used to buzz 'em in then meet him right by the first door 
 That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour 
 Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces 
 He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers 
 Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains 
 Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting 
 Nothing but old pictures of old sixes 
 Old BM's with the kids, old snitches 
 Two sides, both wishes 
 Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches 
 See there's a story in my life 
 There's a story in my pain 
 There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh 
 There's a story in me 
 Yeah, for life 
 Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends 
 And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends 
 'Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance 
 Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn 
 Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told 
 I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile 
 Knew him since a child, man this game so foul 
 But niggas made vows to a code I never break 
 Ridin' in the heavy weight 
 Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight 
 Never on time, when I show up I be ready late 
 Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate 
 And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full 
 If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull 
 We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store 
 On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for 
 Hah! 
 My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told) 
 All the success that I'm suffering from 
 Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know) 
 My family fucks with me 
 And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way) 
 That's why I don't trust nobody 
 And I doubt you'll ever see that day 
 'Fore I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender) 
 Surrender to you, surrender to you 
 Which I will never do 
 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around) 
 Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah) 
 And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down) 
 Cold world (cooooold), a cold cold world 
 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender) 
 Surrender to you, surrender to you 
 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender) 
 Surrender to you, surrender to you 
 Which I will never do 
 Oh-ohohhhwhooooa 
 Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh 
 See there's a story in my life (Surrender) 
 There's a story in my pain (Surrender) 
 There's a story in my tears (Surrender) 
 There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no)
