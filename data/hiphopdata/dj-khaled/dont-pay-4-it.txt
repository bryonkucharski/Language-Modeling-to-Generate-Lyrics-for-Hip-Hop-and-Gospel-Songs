Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Man I'm too playa for that 
 Too many bitches in the world right now 
 That'll fuck around and pray for that 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 I don't pay for no pussy 
 I won't pay for no pussy 
 And I ain't buyin' no Gucci 
 Say I ain't trying to pay for it 
 I'm a motherfucking G 
 And I should make these bitches pay me 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Hell naw man I'm too throwed 
 Niggas stay getting shows 
 Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes 
 Pay for that, not me, no hell 
 Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out 
 This is K.O.D., now they wait on me 
 'Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show 
 Wale, Wale 
 Hear you talking, but I cannot stay 
 Chicks evolve but I cannot stay 
 I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late 
 Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great 
 Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date 
 Throw the bait, ain't no John 
 You done broke the safe just to get those broads 
 You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers 
 And I poke her face and let her hold no cards 
 I ain't even tripping, or paying these women 
 Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious 
 And my sharp show is at 4: 15, can I use the rip in 5: 15 
 Now I 62 'cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Man I'm too playa for that 
 Too many bitches in the world right now 
 That'll fuck around and pray for that 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 I don't pay for no pussy 
 I won't pay for no pussy 
 And I ain't buyin' no Gucci 
 Say I ain't trying to pay for it 
 I'm a motherfucking G 
 And I should make these bitches pay me 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Hell naw man I'm too throwed 
 Niggas stay getting shows 
 Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes 
 Clap that ass, bitch, turn up 
 Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder 
 Swerve in the Murcielago 
 Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of 
 In the Maybach, king with my feet up 
 Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us 
 High give me lead up, work toward nigga 
 2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper 
 I was 16 with a Beamer 
 Glock with the watch on Aquafina 
 Niggas going, hyena 
 Getting pussy posted up at the deener 
 Now we pull up, post in Medinas 
 With light-skinned bitch like Gina 
 Aston, Martin 
 Man I'm motherfucking cold like Kesha 
 Stop signs, Simon says 
 We don't give a fuck, we run them 
 Like Tommy Young, been barely men 
 Man broke niggas, we don't live with them 
 I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends 
 Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz 
 And a threesome with two twenty twins 
 I'm rich, bitch 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Man I'm too playa for that 
 Too many bitches in the world right now 
 That'll fuck around and pray for that 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 I don't pay for no pussy 
 I won't pay for no pussy 
 And I ain't buyin' no Gucci 
 Say I ain't trying to pay for it 
 I'm a motherfucking G 
 And I should make these bitches pay me 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Hell naw man I'm too throwed 
 Niggas stay getting shows 
 Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes 
 (Bitch I'm Mack Ma-I-I-I-ine) 
 Trick what? Lace who? 
 Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do 
 Before I chase you, I replace you 
 Before I break you off, I'm a break you 
 Matter of fact, fuck you 
 Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus 
 Asian chicks, they adore us 
 I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus 
 (Got this drank in my cup 
 And I'm 'bout to roll up) 
 Man this bitch talking too much, dawg 
 (I done came down, hold up) 
 Heard a nigga say pimping was dead 
 I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, "Nah, niggas you're scared" 
 Now go get you some bread 
 See it's... 
 (Money over bitches, and bread over bed 
 Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head) 
 Shit 
 Shit, one go to store for me 
 Got another one that's trying to ho for me 
 Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me 
 And reverse the game and make 'em bring dough to me 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Man I'm too playa for that 
 Too many bitches in the world right now 
 That'll fuck around and pray for that 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 I don't pay for no pussy 
 I won't pay for no pussy 
 And I ain't buyin' no Gucci 
 Say I ain't trying to pay for it 
 I'm a motherfucking G 
 And I should make these bitches pay me 
 Say I ain't trying to pay, for it 
 Hell naw man I'm too throwed 
 Niggas stay getting shows
