Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down 
 Get down, get down 
 How many times I got 'em? 
 Light another for the bitch who's just only in town for the weekend 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time 
 You know how I feel about waiting in line 
 You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time 
 You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 How many times? 
 How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over? 
 How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur? 
 Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher 
 Call me when you getting closer 
 If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya? 
 Don't send me no naked pictures 
 If I can't get naked with ya 
 This dick deserve recognition 
 I don't mind paying that commission 
 Is you with the shit or nah? 
 If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage 
 How many times? I said how many times? 
 Too many times and bitch I ain't got time 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time 
 You know how I feel about waiting in line 
 You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time 
 You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride

 Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking 
 I'll pick up for you though on the second ring 
 You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun 
 And you drink for a reason 
 Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving 
 Calling shots refereeing, no drama 
 Pussy so wet I'm a need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining 
 Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning 
 I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements 
 I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas 
 Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino 
 Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina 
 B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease 
 I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya 
 Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer 
 Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn 
 I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade 
 I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way 
 She fuck me like she want the rent paid 
 Like she want that Oscar De La Renta 
 I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad 
 Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it 
 Straight up 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 How many times? 
 Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down 
 Get down, get down 
 How many times I got 'em? 
 Light another for the bitch who's just only in town for the weekend 
 I see these bitches in supperclub 
 Niggas got me throwing bottles up 
 Bottles with all of my homies 
 I'm feeling generous, throwing my money 
 She said she wanted the molly love 
 I gave her the dick but I'm not in love 
 I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning 
 Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning 
 Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open 
 Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me 
 She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up 
 You wanna fuck with a thug 
 Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing 
 Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone 
 Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free 
 I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it 
 He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks 
 Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split 
 Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit 
 I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars 
 And my niggas, they whipping the bricks 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time 
 You know how I feel about waiting in line 
 You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time 
 You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
 I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side 
 How many times?
