Money long, the night is young (another one) 
 The world is ours - DJ Khaled 
 I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now 
 But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that 
 That ain't gon' change a thing (no) 
 Still gon' do my thing 
 I'm still yeah yeah 
 Still gon' go and get mine 
 Still gon' keep on winnin' 
 Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time 
 (I'm still) I'm still eating when them niggas throw shots 
 (I'm still) I'm still still gon' end up on top 
 I'm still 
 (Pussy ass niggas stop hating) 
 Ralph, Uh 
 Niggas be women like hoes be women 
 Look at me close, there is no sympathy 
 Those with envy be throwing subliminal quotes 
 I'd rather them warring with me 
 If only I hate them (word), like Tony Montana, except, no Manolo 
 She love me for another cuelo (word) 
 These dudes is snakes these women is vultures 
 Who am I to trust, who gon' ride for me 
 Who gon' light somebody's body up when I be like "Yup", they squeeze 
 Comfortably (oh), and that new custom piece 
 My Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's 
 I talked to a bunch of G's just like a frozen tundra speech 
 And the Lambo feel what a real nigga doin' 110 skrr in it, yeah 
 And the world so ill when the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya, uh 
 Let it marinate, uh, what, let me correlate, uh, let them niggas hate 
 But never ever let a women tell a nigga "Wait"' uh, swag 
 I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now 
 But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that 
 That ain't gon' change a thing (no) 
 Still gon' do my thing 
 I'm still yeah yeah 
 Still gon' go and get mine 
 Still gon' keep on winnin' 
 Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time 
 (I'm still) I'm still eating when them niggas throw shots 
 (I'm still) I'm still still gon' end up on top 
 I'm still 
 (Pussy ass niggas stop hating) 
 Most of these niggas ain't raw most of these ain't poppin' (ain't poppin') 
 Most of these niggas ain't balling most of these niggas they starving 
 Talking cars and, what the fuck 
 They don't even got em 
 So high don't see no problems 
 Bitch I'm on them trees like Tarzan 
 Aw man (aw man), I want all my cheese like Robin 
 Shrimp or calamari I'm a young nigga with options 
 Mm, and you close but you ain't close enough 
 In the VIP call me the poster child from posting up 
 Top floor suite we going up; D.A.F. I'm dope as fuck 
 Woo, hundred bottles comin' that mean a hundred bottles gettin' opened up 
 Rolex face all frozen expect y'all to hate you ain't supposed to love it 
 She backing up, like a Tonka truck {*echoes*} 
 I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now 
 But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that 
 That ain't gon' change a thing (no) 
 Still gon' do my thing 
 I'm still yeah yeah 
 Still gon' go and get mine 
 Still gon' keep on winnin' 
 Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time

 Fuck boy, I kept it real, came up 
 Wake up, feeling blessed, pockets full, no stress 
 At the shop, we the best 
 Cutting checks, eating good 
 Loving life, projects all night 
 (I'm still) I'm still gon' shine bright in that limelight 
 Ok now it's no more Mr. nice guy 
 If you niggas couldn't see me in the day time 
 Girl you got a better chance getting a day job 
 Your career wouldn't blow away the napalm (boom) 
 Silly motherfucka, who knows how to win the game on the buzzer 
 I'm the type to make a whole lot of money 
 Buy a whole new crib 'cause I'm bored as a mother 
 And it's still fuck hater 
 Still gon' ball like Kobe from the Lakers 
 Still we the best, and it's still hood nation 
 And I'm still gonna smoke even if I'm on papers 
 I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now 
 But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that 
 That ain't gon' change a thing (no) 
 Still gon' do my thing 
 I'm still yeah yeah 
 Still gon' go and get mine 
 Still gon' keep on winnin' 
 Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
