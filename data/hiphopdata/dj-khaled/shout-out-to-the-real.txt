Free Boosie, real nigga 
 In the jail standing tall like Shaquille nigga 
 I used to say, "I know how you feel, nigga" 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 Had my hood hating now they came up 
 I don't know if it's the money or the fake stuff 
 Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked 
 Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up 
 Friends turn to foes when you're in a row 
 Model bitches turn to hoes cause a nigga froze 
 Got them people taking pictures, let a nigga pose 
 'Cause I get paper reading scripts, you ain't getting shows 
 Poppin' bottles it sound like a mac-10 
 Better be soaked in it when I'm back in 
 I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston 
 And I ain't got an album, man, I got these niggas falling off 
 I'm gone 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 Yeah, bought a chopper for my problems, that banana type 
 Seen a millie, now it's hard for me to sleep at night 
 I'm the type to flood the rollie like it's New Orleans 
 Bet that all my niggas ball like I'm Mr. Clean 
 From the bottom to the top, I made it out the gutter 
 I'm 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter 
 Used to run the streets, but now I'm running every summer 
 Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover 
 Feel like I'm jumping up out that phantom on my cocky ass 
 Know they hating, I just tell 'em kiss the paper tags 
 Still be with them pretty bitches, save for Stacy Dash 
 Plus my rollie cost me 80, that's gon' make 'em mad 
 Free my niggas locked, free my nigga caged 
 Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page 
 Niggas love it when you're drowning in that water, dawg 
 Hate to see a nigga shining like some marmaro 
 Loyalty over royalty that's my common law 
 We The Best: the logo, and I'm with my fucking boss 
 He just tell me murder niggas would think of Holocaust 
 Kill the hottest young'n in and what you niggas thought 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 They took a half of nigga out the bank nigga 
 If you want to whip 'em pussy nigga, blank nigga 
 And I put that red dot right where you think nigga 
 Hood nigga still wearing cuban linx nigga 
 I'm on the ave. nigga riding in a cutlass 
 You that talking nigga, you know you a pussy 
 A real nigga, real life, no rap shit 
 And I can promise you this ain't what you want, bitch 
 Dialed me and still ain't a real nigga 
 'Cause I was to busy to gutter with the real niggas 
 When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga 
 And we some kids to tell you that we the real nigga 
 And they ain't telling none of my young nigga to chill, nigga 
 We all shooters, nigga, and all us on the pills nigga 
 Ain't got a yacht, but nigga the size of Shaquille, nigga 
 And before you try anything you better write your will, nigga 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas 
 Shout out to the real niggas (Salam) 
 And shout out to the real bitches (Say what) 
 I'm popping bottles with my real niggas 
 It's like a full time job not to kill niggas
