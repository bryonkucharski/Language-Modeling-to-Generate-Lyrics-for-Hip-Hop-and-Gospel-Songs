Yeah 
 We the Best Music! 
 DJ Khaled! 
 Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me 
 Unless the said party is a rare breed 
 The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me 
 At this point now, rap is only therapy 
 President Push, I'm more Eric B 
 I ain't no joke, check out my melody 
 Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me 
 But two million in large bills is billing me 
 I was on the wrong side of the law 
 Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car 
 Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards 
 The moral is all greats been driven 
 G-Wagons are bulletproof 
 The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth 
 Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era 
 The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror 
 Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha 
 Yeah, I know who the fuck I am 
 Yuugh, tell me how you fit in 
 Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written 
 When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living? 
 I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen 
 Getting work from Detroit like a piston 
 We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin 
 I could spend a year reminiscing 
 The length of your career, reminiscing 
 We can't occupy the same space 
 We ain't even running the same race 
 When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase 
 Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste 
 Therefore, it's no comparison 
 To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing 
 I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative 
 Clear your sinus like Claritin 
 Push 
 When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga? 
 'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see 
 You peasants don't deserve my presence 
 You portraying other individuals 
 Me, I'm just weighing my residuals 
 From where success is the bare minimal 
 You a rapper, I'm a criminal 
 I had money before they found y'all 
 That's why I feel funny around y'all 
 Lord, bless those praying for my downfall 
 If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all 
 Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key 
 Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D 
 Had the whole YPD sick of me 
 Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee 
 Bet it all or bet it large 
 Now the coke or the pills or the crack, all these credit cards 
 I just laughed and I shrug at it 
 'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts 
 Kiss
