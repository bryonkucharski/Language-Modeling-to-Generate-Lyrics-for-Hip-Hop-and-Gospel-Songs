 I talk grey, I don't keep it white and black 
 Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back 
 Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back 
 Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max 
 To the max, no 
 Like the album just went platinum, yeah 
 Turnt up to the max 
 If they pop somebody's chain then we gotta get it back 
 No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that 
 Man, we lit

 Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure 
 They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher 
 Gotta keep my head up 
 Get 'em right, get 'em right 
 Excuse me, Gus 
 Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins 
 I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin' 
 My broski down to ride 
 Made a knot in the line 
 You can never break ties 
 We don't really rate those yutes there 
 That's a whole other side 
 That's a whole 'nother vibe 
 They ain't really on shit, yeah
