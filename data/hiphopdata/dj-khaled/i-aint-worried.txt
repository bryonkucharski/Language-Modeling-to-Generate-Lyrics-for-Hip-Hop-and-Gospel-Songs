This We the Best Music, WTB 
 I ain't worried, I ain't worried 
 Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried 
 Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy 
 'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em 
 Ain't worried bout 'em, naw 
 The illest nigga know this, the king has spoken 
 I run the south, you run your mouth so please quit with the assumptions 
 Niggas in the Benzo 10-4 ridin' with the chopper clip extendo 
 Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo 
 Blowing on the highest grade of indo 
 Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy, hop on the beat and I catch me a body 
 Millionaire hundred million deposit, just so my niggas, we each can divide it 
 Talkin' bout money all over the table, money all over the floor 
 Killaz they all in the Porsche, pourin' champagne on them hoes 
 All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari double donuts 
 I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha! 
 Laugh at it all, you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood 
 You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good 
 I ain't worried, I ain't worried 
 Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried 
 Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy 
 'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em (First 48, aha, yeah) 
 Ain't worried bout 'em, naw 
 I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed 
 On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil 
 The Feds tappin' my raps, got the keys to success 
 My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressured 
 Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga 
 All day he on Twitter, straight rat on a nigga 
 I'm Instagramming my Bentleys, all my folks gettin' mad 
 Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Ja 
 Swisher sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket 
 Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's 
 Ace Hood be my nigga, I make him clap through your window 
 Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender 
 I ain't worried, I ain't worried 
 Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried 
 Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy 
 'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried 
 Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em 
 Ain't worried bout 'em, naw
