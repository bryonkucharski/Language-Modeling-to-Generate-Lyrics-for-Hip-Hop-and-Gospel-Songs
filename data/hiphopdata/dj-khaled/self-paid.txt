We are going in 
 Let's go 
 Grab the money fast 
 Blow the money quick 
 Rolling in the Maibach 
 Like I am fucking rich 
 Got the class 
 Got the stacks 
 We are so great 
 Got the stacks 
 Got the racks 
 We roll pay 
 From the foreign accent 
 Know how are dealing with 
 We are next level 
 Gotta do it big 
 [?] Presidential suit 
 Call it Ross parole 
 Cops around the clock 
 [?] Thousand watch 
 I ain't gotta stop 
 These bottles pop 
 [?] I am the corner stone 
 When it comes to drop 
 [?] So high and deep 
 High [?] for rap 
 Life or dead is not like [?] 
 You can decide for that 
 [?] I am fly man 
 When I go there is no fly back 
 Back back and forth 
 Will be the jack [?] 
 15 thousand feet dog let's hang 
 We got your morble waxc 
 We won't play 
 Marble wax rose 
 Grab the money fast 
 Blow the money quick 
 Rolling in the Maibach 
 Like I am fucking rich 
 Got the class 
 Got the stacks 
 We are so great 
 Got the stacks 
 Got the racks 
 We roll pay 
 Grab the money fast 
 Blow the money quick 
 Rolling in the Maibach 
 Like I am fucking rich 
 Got the class 
 Got the stacks 
 We are so great 
 Got the stacks 
 Got the racks 
 We roll pay
