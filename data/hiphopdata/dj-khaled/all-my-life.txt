They wanna live my life 
 They wanna walk in my shoes 
 They have no idea 
 All my life 
 I've always been told 
 You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold 
 It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old 
 Never listen to 'em just go for what you know, yeah 
 All my life they told me stop tryin' 
 I never been the one to not go and get mine 
 I never been the one to not put it on the line 
 And I'm a be this way all my life, yeah 
 All my life... 
 (I take you to the gully streets, 
 With the gully god... Mavado get 'em) 
 Mavado: 
 These streets is like a jungle and we're like the lion 
 Many of times me haffi strap with me iron 
 Never scared, never fret 
 Gangsta for life till my last breath 
 Momma even if dem kill me don't cry 
 I'm a gangsta for life, I was prepared to die 
 I'm a die rich, never die poor 
 Mansions in the sky, no more sleeping on the floor 
 All my life 
 I've always been told 
 You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold 
 It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old 
 Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah) 
 All my life they told me stop tryin' 
 I never been the one to not go and get mine 
 I never been the one to not put it on the line 
 And I'm a be this way all my life (yeah) 
 All my life... 
 (From the streets of New York, 
 Where the streets don't sleep... Shyne get 'em) 
 Shyne: 
 All my life 
 I been rollin' with the B's and the C's, 13's and the kings 
 They greens in the pen 
 Steady duckin the police, ain't a friend 
 Till they take me to hang and they fill me with lead 
 Like Fred Hampton for the people I bang 
 Till it come to an end I be bleeding in red 
 I live the story that you read in the Feds 
 Daddy wasn't there but my momma was a gen 
 But I ain't trippin' though 
 That's how I kill a foe 
 We gon get it straight so tell me what it's hittin for 
 And if you didn't know 
 I really live the low 
 I got the O's and the Yo 
 Screamin really though 
 All my life 
 I've always been told 
 You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold 
 It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old 
 Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah) 
 All my life they told me stop tryin' 
 I never been the one to not go and get mine 
 I never been the one to not put it on the line 
 And I'm a be this way 
 (All my life... Shyne get 'em) 
 Shyne: 
 All my life I've been sufferin 
 Steady strugglin 
 I run the streets where they screen for the government 
 Harry Cumberland coming from the cold 
 Got it like I'm Sutherland, but this ain't 24 
 This a ode for the O's and the Loc's 
 Partna's and the cookers doin' life on the road 
 Long as you know you a part of Po 
 Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone 
 I spit the gully rap, I spend the bloody cash 
 I'm the shotta word to papa, where the money at? 
 I'm from the gully jack, where we bury rats 
 Ain't nothin' funny, put a bullet in ya skully cap 
 All my life 
 I've always been told 
 You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold 
 It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old 
 Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah) 
 All my life they told me stop tryin' 
 I never been the one to not go and get mine 
 I never been the one to not put it on the line 
 And I'm a be this way all my life (yeah) 
 All my life...
