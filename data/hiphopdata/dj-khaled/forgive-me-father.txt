Another one!

 I'm here to write my poems 
 I've made a mess again 
 I'd like to apologize 
 I'm tryna make amends 
 Forgive me, father 
 I'm only human 
 That wasn't who I am 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Forgive me, father 
 Those were my demons 
 Don't even look back on it 
 You ready for change, better act on it 
 They look up to you so don't slack on it 
 It's a blessing, you know that you're talented 
 Some people don't know what their talent is 
 What's sad is they don't know what balance is 
 I ain't been the same since I had a kid 
 Look out for him and protect where I live 
 I done got famous for what I did 
 Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same 
 Now the bank come to where I live 
 Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game 
 Did it all for the fame 
 And don't call it a game 
 Started small every day 
 We worked hard, and now they call us bosses 
 And I done seen so many people slow down 
 I can't relate, I can't relate, no 
 And I done seen so many people change up 
 I can't relate, I can't relate, no 
 When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad 
 I can't relate, I can't relate, no 
 Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past? 
 I can't relate, I can't relate, no 
 I'm here to write my poems 
 I've made a mess again 
 I'd like to apologize 
 I'm tryna make amends 
 Forgive me, father 
 I'm only human 
 That wasn't who I am 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Forgive me, father 
 Those were my demons 
 Major, yeah! 
 I got visions, I miss fortune all day 
 What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all 
 I shake these nightmares all day 
 How can I give you my mind? 
 When I try to think, it just race 
 How can I give you my heart? 
 When I call on it, it just breaks 
 I put the city on top 
 District, V.A. all day 
 PG MoCo on their sweaters 
 Guess who made their DNA? 
 Amy Wine to Cobain 
 Qur'an, Bible or fate 
 Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will' 
 Would a hook change my fate? 
 Why you make me this way? 
 I'm here to write my poems 
 I've made a mess of it 
 I'd like to apologize 
 I'm tryna make amends 
 Forgive me, father 
 I'm only human 
 That wasn't who I am 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Those were my demons 
 Forgive me, father 
 Those were my demons
