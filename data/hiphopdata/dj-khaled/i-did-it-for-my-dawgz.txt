I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)

 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 Oh Lord! 
 Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeweler 
 Top down on the car, might be riding with a shooter 
 Nigga down to do ya, I ain't fucking with a curl bar 
 Nickle plated ruger have you in a box on Worldstar 
 Duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga, 
 Duck nigga where I'm from you call the fuck nigga 
 Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa 
 Court side Sportscenter, I can make you a believer 
 Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it 
 Hundred kilo's in the beemer, boy don't make me get excited 
 Couple milli on the neck like I'm tryna get indicted 
 Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger 
 Real niggas, taking over televisions 
 Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes 
 Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire 
 What's a death sentence 'cause we all gotta die 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 Oh Lord! 
 Sittin' on them M's, now shit is gettin' realer 
 Brick of diesel got my hood looking like it's Thrilla' 
 Buying all these foreign's, I be in and out the dealer 
 Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin', it could kill 'em 
 And these suckas, I don't feel 'em 
 I don't even see 'em 
 I'm a die fly, rest in Peace Aaliyah 
 Half my dawgz dead, the rest of them is here 
 If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon' believe ya 
 Said I did it for my dawgz, did it for my dawgz 
 Everybody ridin' till you sit 'em in the morgue 
 Started with a Bonnie now I'm sittin' in a Porsche 
 With the shooters right behind me 
 Shit, you looking at a boss 
 Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless 
 Hundred bottles send 'em to the VIP, ballin' 
 Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding 
 Y'all niggas talking, fuck is y'all retarded? 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 Oh Lord! 
 I did it for my dawgz 
 Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss 
 Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt 
 Now I'm in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin 
 But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly 
 Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning 
 My dawg doing life, try to see him 'fore he hit the coffin' 
 Play with my paper, run up in your offices 
 It's the 'o twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat 
 A maniac nigga, where the paper at 
 Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit 
 50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace, Montana! 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz) 
 I did it for my dawgz 
 Oh Lord! 
 Yo, watch who you drinking with 
 Watch who you smoking with 
 1.7 in my safe when I open it 
 If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it 
 And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is 
 Love to get acquainted with you 
 Stay and tear the jail up 
 Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up 
 Get them thangs off so I haven't put the scales up 
 Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut 
 Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself 
 Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt 
 Yeah the pills is flying but the smokers is something else 
 If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt 
 The dough got 'em bringing in the broads 
 Obvious the flow got 'em screaming for the lord 
 If there's money on ya head what you think is the reward? 
 I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for? 
 I did it for my dawgz 
 Oh Lord!
