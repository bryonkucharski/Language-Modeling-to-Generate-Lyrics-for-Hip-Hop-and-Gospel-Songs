(Intro: DJ Khaled) 
 I am the streets, the future 
 I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Mills 
 Big Sean, Wale, Vado, this the future 
 They gettin' money, they makin' hit records 
 They hustlin' 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Okay now Khaled told me kill 'em 
 He just told me kill 'em 
 100 for the Beamer 
 Kudos for the dealer 
 Murder, bet I wrote it 
 Kudos to the killer 
 Chevy sittin' crooked 
 Keep the Reggie Miller 
 I'm a motherfuckin' beast 
 See me in your sleep 
 Nightmare on any street 
 Swear I will mark any beat 
 Spread this to the industry 
 Lyrics like a chopper piece 
 Flow right through your fitted T 
 Pull this through with chemistry 
 Hottest nigga 'round, they saying 
 Greatness is my tendency 
 No such thing as sympathy 
 More money, my remedy, pockets on, heavy D 
 Bitch I'm hot, 3rd degree, whip I drive? Owned by me 
 Wrists in the air, anti-freeze, can it be? 
 I'm who you dying to be' 
 Last of a dying breed, I'm Siamese 
 Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B 
 Big dog, get it, you still on your pedigree 
 Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag 
 Dead faces keep my money in the body bag 
 And the G-U-T-T-A, hop in the whip and I gotta get paid 
 Fuck them bitches, ain't trying to get laid 
 Walk in my house you can meet my maid 
 And you give a damn you can push that Lac 
 Push that Benz on, push that lade, hop to the whip, no top on mine 
 Niggas gonna hate, man fuck them guys 
 Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie 
 I been paying my secret client, talk to (?), what I resign 
 (?) Your house, about to sign 
 (Meek Mill) 
 We the motherfucking best 
 Word to my mama 
 Wild presidential, got me feeling like Obama 
 All I want is change 
 And my niggas they wanted the same 
 I wanted the money 
 And never the fame 
 I turned into something they never became 
 Through all the rain, I kept my flame 
 And I kept burning and it's my turn and 
 Real nigga my hood confirm it 
 Now it's 6 2's on closed curtains 
 And that Maybach, let me take 'em way back 
 When I was starving that was payback 
 Nigga where that cake at? 
 I want y'all to see now 
 I feel that love, I feel that hate 
 I put it to your mug, you gonna faint 
 When that thing gonna fly 
 Got a little kick, but it ain't no tire 
 Niggas talk murder, but they ain't gonna ride 
 Let me go hard like I ain't gonna die 
 Meek Mill! 
 (Big Sean) 
 Do it! OK 
 Smoke until I ain't got no lungs 
 Got it going down, no teeth 
 I call it "speaking tongues" 
 Do it! Do it! 
 Now you speaking my language 
 When they twist and talk with they fingers 
 Man this ain't no sign language 
 Fresh out of the ashes it's a 
 Detroit fucking classic from when 
 MM got the masses. Trick Trick got them passes 
 Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor 
 Yeah that motor be the fastest 
 Bitch, they call it Motor City 
 'Cause I'm most likely to crash 
 Fuck it! Good thing I got a chauffeur... 
 Going broke? No sir! 
 Bitch I'm a rap game stylist, because I gave the rap game style Bitch 
 But I overshine 
 Told 'em it's the quarter so I guess 
 We're going overtime. Dumb high, dumb high 
 Westside, bitch. I run mine 
 I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni 
 Fucking hoes, no strings attached 
 So don't ask me why they strung out 
 I'm like Jordan to you niggas 
 I might need to stick my tongue out 
 She wiggled and wobble/bobbled 
 Then landed on my throttle 
 Bitch, I might make you my baby 
 And even buy you a bottle 
 That's how they talk to you? 
 (?) People like Versace 
 My pockets got paper on paper 
 This shit just look like a novel 
 100 thousand worth of ice on me now... 
 But it don't feel half as good 
 As grandma saying she's proud... 
 (Wale) 
 Forever dedicated, my poetic genius 
 Something they close to seeing 
 Tell 'em they close, they scheming 
 You poser niggas ain't supposed to be here 
 We don't believe ya. Y'all run them? 
 We put a wreath on niggas' careers 
 We the best, Khaled 
 No need to stress, Khaled 
 Know there's a lot of artists 
 But I got the best palette 
 Multiple colors, my mind's more productive than others 
 Murray the winner, you think he really 
 Nelson Mandela 
 That's fire though. One time for the 305, though 
 That hydro make me tired, yo 
 My kicking be so Tai Bo! 
 My balance be so tight rope 
 That's hard to find 
 Hold the dough for me, I'm maestro, shit 
 That white whip shit 
 On the side, wrists slit 
 Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit 
 Right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard 
 My driver's out of this world, you playing 
 Bumper cars. You niggas under cause 
 You should be unemployed 
 All you smokers Reggie, (?) making a bunch of noise 
 Who gonna tell me that I ain't going? 
 Young Folarin, you see them puters 
 That was my influence 
 (Vado) 
 The twin towers fell 
 Turning to Ground Zero 
 Kicking like Reggie Jackson, Nicki Barnes 
 Their hero, as I play? 
 Corleone like Bob De Niro 
 Been through it here though 
 Don't move with the weirdos 
 Dress pimping like? 
 Your house is on West and 4th 
 Mine is on West 6th 
 While I ride this Maserati
