 This is a hundred Patek, 20 more for baguettes 
 Boardin' a jet with a quart on my neck 
 Make her go board a plane with a brick on her breasts (hey!) 
 I shoulda played for the Mets (Mets) 
 OG two-tone my Patek (two-tone) 
 Makin' these bitches obsessed 
 Makin' these niggas grip TECs (ah) 
 Flex on my ex (flex) 
 Like my boy Khaled say, know we the best 
 She saw the Patek and got undressed for sex ('Tek) 
 Damn I'm so dranked that I found a T-Rex 
 Unleashin' the beast and I beat on my chest 
 Ah, uh, step on the peds (step on the peds) 
 Patek on my flesh 
 Lambo wings, fly out the nest 
 We do not settle for less (who?) 
 I'm in the ghost with no head (ghost) 
 I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed 
 And some of my niggas, they dead (rest in peace) 
 Pockets on Gotti, we pull out the street in big body 
 Might pop a wheelie, Kawasaki 
 We make the profit and cop it, as soon as they drop it 
 Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)

 The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist 
 With a super bad bitch eatin' right at Phillipe 
 Know she fuckin' with a winner 
 Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender 
 Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't 
 Even if I did, I don't remember 
 Been a player since the very beginning 
 Stones in my charm, never my denim, no 
 Chain flooded like the livin' room, huh, incredible 
 Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll 
 Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh? 
 Drippin', let you know I gotta go 
 I catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed 
 I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat 
 Okay one car, two shoes 
 You in hot water like a pack of noodles 
 Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos 
 Like Wu-Tang, my cash rules, yeah 
 Brand new Richard Mille and it's tourbillion 
 'Bout to swap the Patek for the Vacheron (switch it!)
