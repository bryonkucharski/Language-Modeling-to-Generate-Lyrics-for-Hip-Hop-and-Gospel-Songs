On everything I love, it's we the best music 
 It's we the best over everything 
 Get money, mo' money 
 Every time we come around 
 Doors goin' up, panties goin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Y'all throw that money up, catch it comin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Baby let me blow a hundred on you 
 Every time we come around 
 Put your hand up, down 
 You know I got that check on me, you know I got that 9 on me 
 Play with it or get religious, these shots'll make your shirt holey 
 Say please lord, forgive a nigga, actin' up like Ben Stiller 
 Jewelry on me so fuckin' cold, I gotta wear it with a chinchilla 
 I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade 
 Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James 
 I'm hardbody, my flow sick, that Eagle on me no Mike Vick 
 I bob and weave in that pussy good and I knock it out like Tyson 
 Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound 
 Yeah, shorty, she know the deal and that's every time that I come 'round 
 This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud 
 Give my dog about 1200, in twenty minutes he goin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Doors goin' up, panties goin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Y'all throw that money up, catch it comin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Baby let me blow a hundred on you 
 Every time we come around 
 Put your hand up, down 
 It's my year, Slime here, Cartier box face, call it the time's square 
 Why year, I drive and fly Lear, V-16, need a coupe with nine gears 
 Yeah! Mob member, star agenda 
 Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (Yes!) 
 I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba 
 Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor 
 F it, you all dinners, no protection 
 Tired of hearing these deadlines, no reception 
 Need work like wi-fi, no connection 
 We The Best men be the best in, 'cause 
 Every time we come around 
 Doors goin' up, panties goin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Y'all throw that money up, catch it comin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Baby let me blow a hundred on you 
 Every time we come around 
 Put your hand up, down 
 They think I'ma gun 'em down, just 'cause I'm a motherfucking king from the underground 
 Rest in peace, Pimp, name live long as Bun around 
 Niggas know me, 100 keys, 500 pounds 
 Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down 
 Nigga try to run off with some change, I'ma hunt him down 
 All they do is run they mouth; me, I just run the town 
 'Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns 
 Circus: it hurts 'cause everybody's a boss and nobody's the workers (Real shit) 
 Shit is getting weird; all I know is when I look 'em in the eyes they be scared 
 Every time we come around 
 Doors goin' up, panties goin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Y'all throw that money up, catch it comin' down 
 Every time we come around 
 Baby let me blow a hundred on you 
 Every time we come around 
 Put your hand up, down
