I'm so serious! 
 One, two them boys coming for you 
 Three, four, better lock your door 
 Five, six, hide your bitch 
 (Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit) 
 They said, thou shall not be ill 
 Thou shall not feel 
 Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real 
 Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills 
 They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas high for real 
 Every year gon be our year 
 Every year gon be my year 
 These niggas really is out here 
 These niggas really is out here 
 The block is at war 
 Post traumatic stress 
 Ran up outta pills 
 Rob that CVS 
 Niggas getting bust over In God's We Trust 
 We believe in God but do God believe in us 
 If we believe enough, will we ever get to know 'im 
 That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen 
 I've been poppin' shit for too long

 I guess it's how I came up 
 I wish you would try to play us 
 My money on a another level 
 In the streets I hear 'em hotter than the fucking devil 
 I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel 
 G5, make it rain, I can change the weather 
 We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar? 
 Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters 
 Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order 
 Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than the quarter 
 I'm at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters 
 All my niggas still hustle consider 'em roguish 
 I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus 
 All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting 
 Hunh, my corner will scorch ya 
 Somehow my flow is the coldest 
 Money, power, respect, the only thing's truly important 
 Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused 
 God Forgives and I don't 
 Pussy niggas unnoticed 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I guess it's how I came up 
 I wish you would try to play us 
 I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga 
 You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga 
 You see these niggas'll try to play ya 
 Know how ya feel nigga 
 Eh yup, that'd be the day you wanna kill a nigga 
 But you gon chill nigga 
 Just for your kids nigga 
 Cause now there's kids doing grown man biz nigga 
 You just got home nigga 
 You tryna live nigga 
 Me I don't wanna do another 5 years nigga 
 The boss is testing yo ass 
 The feds'll question yo ass 
 They be drug testin' yo ass 
 And then they pray you don't pass 
 And then you look in the sky 
 You got some questions to ask 
 With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac 
 'Cause they've been poppin' shit for too long 
 Still reppin' where I came from 
 I guess it's how I came up 
 I wish you would try to play us 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I wish you would nigga 
 I guess it's how I came up 
 I wish you would try to play us 
 (Rozay!)
