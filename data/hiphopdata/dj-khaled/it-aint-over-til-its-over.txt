I said we the best at making this green 
 I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team 
 F is for the family that's holding me down 
 I think niggas know who run this town 
 A is for the action I'm all about 
 Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt 
 B is for the big boys with the grown money 
 And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money 
 Shots of 'Tron at like 4 in the morn' 
 It ain't over till it's over, Loso I'm gone 
 Lights stay on, they don't fade 
 Take my last call, don't hold your breath 
 Everyday make something outta nothing 
 Move a mountain and still keep running 
 Never come down, make no mistake 
 They can say oh that my end is on the horizon 
 When I wake, all I see is the sun rising 
 Just when I thought I said all there was to say 
 I get the last word, 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Just when I thought I did all there was to do 
 I give my best to you 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Ooh-oh ooh-oh 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Ooh-oh ooh-oh 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 I smoke weed, you sip on lean 
 People always sayin' what the hell is that mean 
 J is for the justice I did to the game 
 Lot of these niggas that's on is lame 
 A is for the way I airs 'em out 
 Coupes by the two's I pairs 'em out 
 D's for the dope that a nigga still pumpin' 
 12 hour shifts got the spot still jumpin' 
 Rockin' on till the block is gone 
 38′ is snub nose but the choppers long 
 And everything takes time so they say 
 But it's been on my side everyday 
 Every second gone is another way to come up 
 Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot 
 Twists and turns I can take 
 They can say they do that my end is on the horizon 
 When I wake, all I see is the sun rising 
 Just when I thought I said all there was to say 
 I get the last word, 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Just when I thought I did all there was to do 
 I give my best to you 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Ooh-oh ooh-oh 
 It ain't over till it's over 
 Ooh-oh ooh-oh 
 It ain't over till it's over
