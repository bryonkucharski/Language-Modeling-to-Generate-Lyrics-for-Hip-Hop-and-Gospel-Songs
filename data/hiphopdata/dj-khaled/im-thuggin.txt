DJ Khaled: 
 Yeah, DJ Khaled 
 Mean Mug Music 
 Waka Flocka 
 Ace Hood 
 This Gon' Fuck The Streets Up 
 This Gon' Fuck The Clubs Up 
 Police kicked my door in shawty last night 
 I'll Be Damned If I Don't Go Out With A Fight 
 My Girlfriend Says She Needs Some New Shoes And A Bag 
 I Told Her Shut The Fuck Up And Get Off Yo Ass 
 I'm Thuggin' [x4] 
 Middle Fingers To The Cops And The Judge 
 Raised by the old niggas, just mean mug 
 God Bless A Nigga So Bitch I'm Out Here 
 Wear The Wrong Color You Can't Come Around Here 
 So Get Your Mind Right And Your Pistol Close 
 Hoppin' Out That Ride Into Your Place Like A Seminal 
 All My Niggas They Thuggin' 
 My Lil Cousin Got His Chopper Chrome 
 Any Niggas Want Problems Take Your Top Off Block The Metrodome 
 It'll Make A Loud Noise Sound Like It's World War 
 Never Break A Sweat That's What Them Killers For 
 I Get Money Hoe, On Some Real Shit 
 Deck Of Hundreds On Me 
 That's Just What I Deal With 
 Waka Thorped Out And We The Business 
 See Me Off To H.A.M. I Bet Your Niggas Deal Quick 
 Mama Pray For Me, Commit A Lot Of Sins 
 And It Don't Make It Better Consumin' A Lot Of Gin 
 Blood, Sweat And Tears I Pour My Soul Out 
 Smell The Flowers Bitch I Might Just Pull A Rose Out 
 A Young Nigga Fucking Bucking With His Treads Loose 
 Middle Finger All The Fans 'Cause I Said To 
 Now Where My G's At? 
 Now Where Them Dope Boys? 
 Now Where My Niggas Who Be Thuggin' On The Corner Four? 
 Hands In The Air, Throw Your Hood Up 
 Hoppin' Out That 7 Tre, Them 6's When I Pull Up 
 Now Where My Bad Bitches Who Keep Their Ass Phat? 
 I Love A Bitch Ain't Scared To Throw That Ass Back 
 And I Keep Them Real Niggas 
 Homie That's A Fact 
 You A SuperDuck, I'm Talkin' Aflac 
 My Nigga Storped Out, Thorped Out 
 Stupid Treads In Them 
 Soles With Them Stone Mouth 
 Club stupid packed, it's a mad house 
 Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out 
 And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn 
 See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse
