If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I'm criminal minded, winter coat climate 
 Cold. Fucking up your sinus, bitches might 
 Choke, I'm giving them the heimlich, I'm a 
 Pimp in my own fucking rhyming, you my side bitch 
 UGH... Two chainz, two pinky rings 
 I like to play with Lucille's: B.B. King 
 You don't fuck with us, we don't really fuck with y'all 
 Stunna bought some Yatchs, We in the ocean playing bumper cars 
 Pocket full of money, bitch, and my crew eating 
 Got a nigga shining like a brand new nickel 
 Plated pistol, this's my last shot 
 Just left the dealership and the cashed out 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads

 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 Black shades, gold chain, and a Versace scarf 
 Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark 
 What it be like nigga? What it look like ho? 
 Still shining a nigga, two chains looking like it's lightning doe 
 No love for you bustas, keep on steady stuntin' 
 Mo' bottles of Rosé, yeah you know who run it 
 Thousand dollar shades on, all gold frames 
 Mister Fuck-your-bitch-and-leave-her, that's my code name 
 I'm blowing money in this bitch, I think I'm Birdman 
 Trapping ain't dead, getting money like the bird man 
 Bad bitches, whole lotta ass 
 Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 In the kitchen and we cooking up that raw hog 
 Dry when shining, I'm a movie star 
 Open up the bank bitch, bring 'em large 
 Flip 'em and we bust em, then we ship 'em off 
 Perpetrating'll get your head bust 
 A hundred million,'ll get you dope flush 
 A new Bentley, you get a ho rush 
 Big money shit, we popping 'cause we came up 
 Hella choppers, on them new thangs 
 Big yachts, brand new wings 
 Them hoes yapping, 'cause they know the frame 
 Cardinal, Ten Carats on my pinky ring 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads
