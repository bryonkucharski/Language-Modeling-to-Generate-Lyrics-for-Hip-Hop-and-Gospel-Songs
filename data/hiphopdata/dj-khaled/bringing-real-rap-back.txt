Lyrics to Bringing Real Rap Back: 
 (Chorus - Rum) 
 I'm tired of this bullshit 
 All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors 
 I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers 
 We tired of that bullshit 
 Getting over, make it worse for the next 
 Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah 
 (We tired of that bullshit) 
 I-I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 I'm bringing real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 I'm bringing real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 (Verse 1 - Rum) 
 I'm officially affiliated, ho's love it and niggas hate it 
 We the best, we the greatest, book a show, signing papers 
 S-S-S-Signing like old times, don't even need a whip 
 Homes for the more valuable, my son tell me I'm the shit 
 Shawty ain't going down, they let dummy pick and choose 
 Pass to the oh and boo, she down for that switcheroo 
 Might-might-might-might catch a switch or two, still the same old red 
 Chill with them youngins, but got my game from the old heads 
 Trynna then y'all niggas, killed you in college bro 
 Show's on Myspace, it ain't hard to find it bro 
 I'm bringing real rap back, for the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 Blue red every color and the G's with neeks 
 (Chorus - Rum) 
 I'm tired of this bullshit 
 All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors 
 I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers 
 We tired of that bullshit 
 Getting over, make it worse for the next 
 Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah 
 (We tired of that bullshit) 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 I'm bring real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 I'm bringing real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 (Verse 2 - Rum) 
 Look, I ain't hatin', I keep it real, I see what they don't see 
 Radio ain't the same, they play what they wanna play 
 All 'bout a budget now, fake is the new real 
 Lie about who you kill, and get you a record deal 
 Them folks take a chance with it, give ya advance with it 
 Promote you like hell man, let you make a lil' dance with it 
 You good for about a year, then you strugglin' to stay alive 
 The whole world forgot about ya, back to 9-to-5 
 Put it down all the time, put on my real jeans 
 Got 'em big, 45, can't wear no lil' skinny jeans 
 No women tendencies, plus I can really spit 
 These niggas is really bitches, go 'head, tuck your dick 
 (Chorus - Rum) 
 I'm tired of this bullshit 
 All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors 
 I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers 
 We tired of that bullshit 
 Getting over, make it worse for the next 
 Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah 
 (We tired of that bullshit) 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 I'm bring real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 I'm bringing real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 (Verse 3 - Rum) 
 I'm offended by all means, everybody rap now 
 I can't even blame 'em though, the drug game locked down 
 Determined to be the next, care less 'bout a record sale 
 Will dummies succeed or fail? Shit, only time'll tell 
 Glad to be out the sale, glad to be out the hood 
 Glad I ain't got a lot, I do what you others should 
 Boy, you're a fucking jerk, loosen up on your shirt 
 Nigga scramming out this bitch, and you feeling 'bout all this work? 
 I know nigga's mad at me, expose these clowns though 
 Niggas just claim shit, don't even know what it stand fo' 
 You pussies ain't trained to go, keep bragging 'bout hood dough 
 Your nuts don't hang low, boy he's a man-ho 
 (Chorus - Rum) 
 I'm tired of this bullshit 
 All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors 
 I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers 
 We tired of that bullshit 
 Getting over, make it worse for the next 
 Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah 
 (We tired of that bullshit) 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 I'm bring real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's 
 I-I'm bringing real rap back 
 I'm bringing real rap back 
 I-I-I'm bring real rap back 
 For the Chevy's and Cadillac's
