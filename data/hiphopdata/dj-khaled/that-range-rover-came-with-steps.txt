 Murder rate, murder rap nigga 
 Real shit, Pluto 
 Grants, Jacksons, Franklins, got 'em 
 DJ Khaled! 
 Fucked the DA on my way here 
 I made some millions on my way here nigga 
 I seen your comment on my way here 
 I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga 
 Bentayga with the brain bust open 
 That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open 
 Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar 
 Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start 
 I can't name how many times they tried to clone me 
 I can't name all the names that tried to clone me 
 This dirty money help me see the double 
 Sidity thots, know they ain't forever 
 My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs 
 Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars 
 The Maybach park itself, nigga 
 That Range Rover came with steps, nigga 
 Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon 
 He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on 
 Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on 
 They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum 
 Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb 
 The murder rate going up nigga 
 I done ran this check up nigga 
 Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah 
 The Goyard looking like a graveyard 
 Murder money, I'm in love with murder money 
 Old friends of me turned into my enemy 
 My money and fame changes niggas into enemies 
 All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy 
 Want to send a hit but too far in the industry 
 I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me 
 They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary 
 I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky 
 I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity 
 With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive 
 Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle 
 Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter 
 And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off 
 Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya 
 I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya 
 I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya 
 I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers 
 Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em 
 Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya 
 I told Future I can see the future 
 Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you 
 I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah (I'm grateful) 
 And if you diss me then I might shoot ya (brrrrt) 
 You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual (fuck you) 
 Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler (fuck 'em) 
 I was selling keys to success 
 I was coppin' keys outta Texas 
 New Wraith with the stars in it 
 New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it 
 Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it 
 Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it 
 Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin' 
 Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience 
 Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and Xans like we're patients 
 And them fed's allegations will have you pacin' 
 Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful 
 You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you 
 Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga 
 Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga 
 New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga 
 Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga 
 You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest 
 Gotta be grateful, I never break the promise, I know my plug love me 
 I know my bitch hate me, I heard my hood salty 
 I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault, it's just my blessings called me 
 But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin' 
 And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin' 
 If she ain't fuckin' first night then she just miss her callin' 
 Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial, poker face, I'm all in 
 Patek Philippe, AP, 40 mil', I'm all in 
 Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin' 
 I worked so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands 
 I'm the king of the city, my house Graceland 
 No respect for rappers, they respect the coke man 
 That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga
