Ay everybody switchin' up, I guess 
 (DJ Khaled) 
 It's just the way it is, oh 
 These niggas beat me to it 
 Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no 
 They changin', they changin' 
 And everything I got they wanna take it, oh 
 My money and my lady, no 
 They wanna separate it 
 They try and tear us down 
 They tryna tear us down 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's catch up, oh 
 I'm touchin' M's and my life is pandemonium 
 I got a re-up for you, you know I invented those 
 Everything around me trickle like sauce 
 You niggas old news like a five star 
 Every single night I got a bad bitch 
 See her comin' up, she came with another bad one 
 I done caught 'em vibin' the wave, double jeopardy 
 They know I'm the king of these melodies 
 You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key 
 You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me 
 Put it in my cup and let me medicate 
 And it all started off with foreplay 
 (With foreplay) 
 Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica 
 (Santa Monica) 
 We was best friends until the fall out 
 Now I got the lawyers goin' all out 
 It's just the way it is, oh 
 (Just the way it is) 
 These niggas beat me to it 
 Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no 
 (They changin', they changin') 
 And everything I got they wanna take it, oh 
 My money and my lady, no 
 They wanna separate it 
 They try and tear us down 
 They tryna tear us down 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, I been reaping those rewards 
 From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy 
 Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me 
 What? They write it to somebody else instead of me 
 Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up 
 They wanna see me on my last one, last one 
 They tell you things you don't wanna hear 
 They don't wanna see me with a bad one 
 No, or see you in a Benz wagon 
 With your new bag on 
 The bag that these hatin' bitches only spend a hundred plus tax on 
 The one we spent five racks on 
 And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on 
 I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on 
 Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me 
 (Another one) 
 It's just the way it is, oh 
 (Just the way it is) 
 These niggas beat me to it 
 Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no 
 (They changin', they changin') 
 And everything I got they wanna take it, oh 
 My money and my lady, no 
 They wanna separate it 
 They try and tear us down 
 They tryna tear us down 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 It's all right, yeah 
 I'll be all right, yeah 
 As long as you right here, yeah 
 I'll be just fine, yeah 
 (I'll be just fine) 
 Just fine, yeah 
 Just fine, yeah 
 We was best friends until the fall out 
 Just fine, yeah 
 We was best friends until the fall out 
 Just fine, yeah 
 Now I got the lawyers goin' all out 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 They jealous, they want us to fold 
 That will never happen 
 They want us broke, so you know what we gonna do? 
 We gonna become billionaires 
 From now on when you see me, call me Billy 
 I'm a be all right, I'm a be just fine 
 It's just the way it is, oh 
 (Just the way it is) 
 These niggas beat me to it 
 Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no 
 (They changin', they changin') 
 And everything I got they wanna take it, oh 
 My money and my lady, no 
 They wanna separate it 
 They try and tear us down 
 They tryna tear us down 
 Hey, hey, hey
