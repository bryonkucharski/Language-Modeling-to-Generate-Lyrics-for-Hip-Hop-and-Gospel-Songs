We The Best Music! 
 How many times the merry-go-round goes around 
 You come around a whole lot of times 
 DJ Khaled! 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest 
 How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 I might bust that little bitch, pass to my buddy 
 Bust that bitch and pass her to my buddy 
 How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great 
 Bust a little bitch and pass her to my buddy 
 Gin and tonic, pass that to my buddies 
 On that lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic 
 How does that feel, my nigga? I said it feel great 
 Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up!) 
 Alligator swap, we pill pop in my hood 
 Ain't no changin' that, 'cause that check we on good (straight up!) 
 9 A.M. clockin', 4 A.M. water whippin' 
 Just got to the Mo, my niggas still leanin', tippin' 
 Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days 
 Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!) 
 504, my nigga, shout my woadie 
 La Flame killin' you niggas, damn, I'm sorry 
 That's not my kid, call up my nigga Maury 
 Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story 
 I bust a nut like I bust a brick 
 Bust a band like I bust a bitch 
 Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch 
 But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up!) 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest 
 How does it feel, my nigga? 
 Damn, it feel great 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest 
 How does it feel, my nigga? 
 Damn, it feel great 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!) 
 Wayne's world, part time, excellent 
 She might be a tourist and terrorist 
 A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven sent, Lord 
 We can go sight seein' and all that 
 She can be wifey and all that 
 She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide 
 Can't see this bullshit, I hit bullseye 
 The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes 
 I told her, "Don't worry, we stay high" 
 Plus there's a bed on my tour bus 
 So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord 
 I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans 
 I pull up her skirt and get gnarly 
 She come to Wayne's world just to party 
 And all of my tourists is foreign 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest 
 How does it feel, my nigga? 
 Damn, it feel great (straight up!) 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!) 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist 
 Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest 
 How does it feel, my nigga? 
 Damn, it feel great 
 Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!) 
 Khaled, fuck with your boy 
 Bust a trip and come and be my tourist 
 Moolah! 
 God is great 
 We winnin' 
 Amen 
 Hallelujah, Hollygrove 
 Hallelujah, Hollygrove 
 I'm gone 
 Bust a trip and come and be my tourist
