Live like 9-5, I rhyme and come alive 
 My grind divides fine through my divine eyes 
 It's prime time, you wish you could buy time, but it's my time 
 Thoughts against I, blasphemy, it's like a vice crime 
 I roll 'em thick and I ignite mines 
 I don't even get high, I just get equally back in my right mind 
 I'm getting lethal with these nice lines 
 Creeping through your speakers 
 Catch you sleeping like a thief of in the nighttime 
 Young Doms, none of you niggas correspond, bitch 
 Kick the fuck out of the track on some Jean-Claude shit 
 Get the fuck out of the streets, nigga, I bomb shit 
 Shit ain't all good no more, y'all on your con shit 
 The fuck is your conscience? Testing me is nonsense 
 The whole city is mine, I'm the best up in my conference 
 Ain't feeling me, fine, ain't gotta listen to my shit 
 You can hear about me from the critics all on my dick 
 Bitch, I've been thugging since the motherfucking Ten Speed 
 Redbone on my handlebars, I like my bitches mixed breeds 
 Feel the Philly tighten with a 20 sack of stress weed 
 Educated, at the stove I'm working recipes 
 Reputation say I'm robbing just for recreation 
 Revive my enemy with gun-to-mouth resuscitation 
 Can't wait to this pussy nigga pay me, I'm impatient 
 Let's go kick in their door and strip them naked, leave 'em stinking 
 No witness, no weapon, my nigga, the case is over 
 The reaper snatched 'em, closed casket, his family needs a closure 
 And Moses had ten commandments, Huey had ten points 
 Won't see my homie for ten, dropped him off at the joint 
 Staring at my future in my rear-view 
 Family cried some tears, I got some years, it ain't no issue 
 Mama with the tissue 
 Saw her breaking down, she just might cry a river 
 Murder one, she can't believe she raised that type of nigga 
 I tried to do right, but it only got your boy fucked in the game 
 So I changed my mind, now I'm back on this grind 
 Trying to get this change 
 Niggas hate to see me getting it 
 Travelling packs with a red dot 
 Boy, it ain't your knot, trying to get what you got 
 When the rain and the pain gon' stop 
 Standing on the porch early, no shoes, selling blow in my socks 
 And I was watching for the ghetto bird 
 Ain't got no money for college 
 So all I know is how to sack and how to serve 
 I be damned if I miss another lick for the chips 
 Got me stacking, almost splurging on weed, syrup and whips 
 Niggas around my way be loving it 
 I'm Cadillac'ing, blowing good alligators with the belts to match 
 I got an ounce with an ounce to match, bust it down, get back 
 Hopefully maybe get the clique out the trap 
 I need dough like a bread baker (Amen) 
 24/7, got ready on the turf, player 
 All day 
 Make 'em hop in the new coupe 
 Nigga, but that ain't nothing new 
 Forgive me for the sinning that they be doing in this business 
 Not using their words to express truth 
 Out in the streets with a screw loose 
 On the Westside I got the juice 
 Just tell me what you trying to do 
 She loving the crew and ain't fucking with you 
 I go where the hood niggas get into it 
 I go where the bad girls go shop 
 Every window tinted but the rooftop 
 That money I'll just spend it to get you shot 
 Can they be hating, they got no reason 
 Right where they got me, the place I Delete 'em 
 We kicking on weaklings just for all of their secrets 
 I can't believe the shit that I'm seeing 
 I'm hearing the words, doing my reading, it's really absurd 
 Not enough leaders, the shit that they feed you, it's just what you eating 
 They call me young Veggies, I make it go green 
 I smash in all your teeth, the fuck is you saying? 
 You got the candy's, the niggas is spraying 
 To get away and take over the land, yeah 
 My mind on capital, I'm not just rapping, dude 
 I'm out to speak actual factual, watch how I master moves 
 Your baller fist will daggle you 
 I'm from a city clapping fools 
 You out [?] lacking while watching me fashion stools 
 Shitting styles, you never had a hot line that I didn't dial 
 Little princess always trying to fit a bigger crown 
 But don't forget I [?] some emcees 
 And just them bitches know he a pimp and even read the blimp 
 It was a good day, good day to O'Shea 
 A death certificate for anyone who lay in my way 
 You best revisit all the tombstones that lay in my way 
 Me being knowledge, be honest 
 You seen the profit get sacrificed by the Oxy 
 Get ratchet when ratchets out and they firing 
 Residue on pinata's, wonder what's up inside of 'em 
 It's sure ain't no Vicodin cause it up and excited 'em 
 But they ain't get high enough, if you ain't succeed, nigga 
 Buy again then try again 
 It's the irrational type of nigga, the John Madden tackle you 
 Steal your car keys and crash your coupe in the botanical 
 Wrap you with shackles, tangle you, pull from ever angle, dismantle you 
 Watch your blood mixed with mud and stain the gravel too 
 Grab and shoot, rib cage open like a parachute 
 Close range, Swiss blade, poke 'em if it's personal 
 Blood stains, gold fangs, mask on, no traits 
 Murder one, closed case, rolling with no plates 
 Half a body in the trunk, go to prison, no way 
 Speed off the Brooklyn bridge before I catch a cold case 
 Realize I'm the voice for those who do not have a voice 
 So I voice my fucking voice, I don't have a fucking choice 
 Cold blooded, leave some niggas, well I hope you got insurance 
 Shotgun and shorty lift 'em like the potent in my joint 
 Barrels smoking like Red Auerbach 
 Still can't believe I'm getting fed on rap 
 I don't know what's louder, the pack or the gat 
 My endorphins are morphin', absorbin' energy 
 Original copy, A Tale of Two Cities gets read to me 
 Reading Emersom novels eating some Belgian waffles 
 Some powder go up my nostrils, my dick going down her tonsils 
 What's up? Play with an abacus, I've been stressing like Catholics 
 That's the shit, a bit of that happiness in my cup 
 This generation corrupt, these people brainwashed with evil 
 My music is more cerebral, exploring just what you need to 
 So this your Exodus, church of the Methodist 
 Beating up the pussy, have her screaming like the exorcist 
 Absorbing through your pores, the Lord with horns, a world war 
 Whores are more hors d'oeuvre when it's a world tour 
 O'Doyle Rules
