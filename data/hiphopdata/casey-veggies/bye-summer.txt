Summer Summer I'm sad that you left me 
 I learned so much stuff and seen the best fees 
 Got with em' and broke up 
 Getting more mature now I'm listening to slow stuff 
 Doing style changes like a bowl cut 
 I got closer to the homies no homo 
 And jumped around everywhere like a Pogo 
 Met new people, got more creative, bought way more shit 
 And talked on the phone late night for hours like a day shift 
 And oh yeah the pool parties were the shh... hot 
 And it was hot as hell whether not you like it 
 06' till infinity I'm still prices 
 Name is Casey Veggies go and tell a friend 
 Summer I will miss you until you come back again 
 It's like 
 Believe in the little kid, I know you wouldn't believe what I done did, What I been through 
 My words go to your mind and it makes the music mental 
 Guided by many, hated by plenty 
 But really they fulfill me, but I was never empty 
 In the Toyota but why not the Bentley 
 Keep pushing until enough is in me 
 And I don't need nobody to defend me 
 Big Hof talking about how much he gonna lend me, I wish I had it 
 But money don't come like magic, and I spent it all 
 On this thing called fashion, writing these verses making a nigga tear up 
 It's my passion, young ludacris my life is just crashing 
 Skateboard P, I can do it too, now I'm skateboard c 
 And all my real niggas right by me 
 Oh, and hate is a motivator, if ya can't remember my name y'all gon know it later 
 I work hard, didn't wanna come out last night 
 Big boy, but I was always an outcast 
 So did Summer did Winter 
 Wrote so many verses got paper cuts and splinters 
 My name is Custom, check the resumes 
 Throw on some mean Nike's like every day 
 Mother I love you, you were my life is very needed 
 Whenever you say something to me I just receive it 
 All these rappers say they the truth but I don't believe it 
 Nigga give me the fame and a deal 
 Y'all gon be seeing, yeah maybe y'all won't believe it 
 Throw on some Levi's and don't forget to crease it 
 I just wanna make it one day, I wanna be something 
 Whether its writing rhymes or shooting threes on him 
 I need a chance, trust me I'll give it my all 
 To all y'all until I fall, I feel ten feet tall 
 That's what the high self esteem does for ya 
 Spitting too hard Mama I need a lawyer 
 Hot out the microwave nigga ill bore ya 
 Don't usually play games but girl ill toy ya 
 Beyonce is the best, what's up with Latoya? 
 As I get older I get harder and harder 
 Thank you Father So fresh dude, thank you barber 
 I love girls thank you barber 
 Speed it up at a faster pace, get out the way I'll spray you with mace 
 It's not everything its just a taste and I hope you all like it 
 Put the skateboard by the Nikes we all gonna eat there 
 Catch me where they sell street ware I'm telling you I'm not asking 
 Shoot a few Swisher's for my daddy 
 If we was golfing she would be my caddy 
 I can't understand you, all I hear is static 
 (It's like all I hear is static 
 Man, all I hear is static)
