You ask me what I'm been on 
 I promise I been on my grind 
 Searching for something in this world 
 A lot of things on my mind 
 Just hold on girl 
 I promise that I just need some time 
 I need a moment to myself 
 So just give me a little time 
 Yeah, like Usher girl I got it bad 
 Girl I'm your nigga, best you ever had 
 I beat it up until that pussy mad 
 I made it mine, she had to tell her dad 
 And then he asked me like what's up with that 
 And then you let him know you can't get enough of that 
 I'm the man and she into men 
 Like the bitches on the gram, bitches on the gram 
 Yeah, if she don't see me, she gon' hear me though 
 She know I ain't no fake rapper like CB4 
 Man where the girls that's ready to go 
 She went full throttle 'cause I'm on the go 
 MC Hammer, they can't touch this flow 
 Yeah that's my chick, you can look but you can't touch it though 
 They looking confused, you have to let 'em know 
 It's me and my bitch and that's just how it go 
 You ask me what I'm been on 
 I promise I been my grind 
 Searching for something in this world 
 A lot of things on my mind 
 Just hold on girl 
 I promise that I just need some time 
 I need a moment to myself 
 So just give me a little time 
 Try to take my chick, then I might take your chick 
 I'm young and rich, man I just take my pick 
 Yeah, she taking pictures, send it to my phone 
 And when I'm gone, she said she feel alone 
 I'm getting grown, I'm tryna buy a home 
 Girl we can get it all, location unknown 
 When we get together, it's a different zone 
 We upgrade each other like Beyonce's song 
 Girl I ain't thirsty for any of these R&B singers 
 But I respect your mind and I love your demeanor 
 When you spending bands, you'll get paid to love 
 I'm talking sex in the shower, candles in the tub 
 I pull up on you in a brand new car 
 Bonnie and Clyde, we against the law 
 We should start over just because 
 Meet again and then fall in love 
 Act like we didn't know each other 
 Give me your number and then we fuck 
 Don't trip, I ain't judging you girl 
 Yeah you know all we need is trust, yeah 
 You ask me what I'm been on 
 I promise I been my grind 
 Searching for something in this world 
 A lot of things on my mind 
 Just hold on girl 
 I promise that I just need some time 
 I need a moment to myself 
 So just give me a little time 
 You ask me what I'm been on 
 I promise I been on my grind 
 Searching for something in this world
