 My nigga I'm awesome 
 Everything crisp white flossin 
 I don't do this often 
 Right now I'm ??? 
 Swag, swag, sold, man, I shoulda sold it at an auction 
 Niggas still steal it as I'm walking 
 Feelin' like the next nigga here, 
 I don't care, I'ma get it 
 'Cause the way I spit this shit, so specific, 
 Couple thousand in my pocket, 
 Make sure them girls with it, 'cause I swear they ain't dealin' with no ordinary niggas 
 Right now, I got my whole city poppin', a bunch of options 
 They messin with them labels tryin' to stop shit, I got this 
 Give me my kudos now, 
 My old chick so mad at my new hoes now (swag) 
 Got them girls eatin veggies in the produce aisle (swag) 
 Ended up one time, now I know you a while (swag) 
 But I don't know you now, I saw everything I needed 
 Let me show you how
