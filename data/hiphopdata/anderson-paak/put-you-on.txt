You cold, you cold, you the coldest 
 I just wanna know who put you on it 
 How much do you teach her? 
 Knowledge is the motherfucking key 
 New move, got a lot of 'em 
 Remember when you only knew how to ride on it 
 Now you be tossing it like Serena 
 And I'mma run it back like a re-run 
 Who put you on, who put you on to that? 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that 
 Now look at you 
 Who put you on to that? 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that 
 You know, you know, you my favourite 
 I be steady drinking with you baby 
 Long strokes to the promise 
 Remember you couldn't take it at all 
 New moves, got a lot of 'em 
 Tell me when the hell you got so long winded 
 Talking and walking just like a diva 
 Now you gon' hit the news like Aretha 
 Who put you on, who put you on to that? 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that 
 Now look at you 
 Who put you on to that? 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that 
 Who put you on 
 Who put you on to that 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that 
 Now look at you 
 Who put you on to that 
 You didn't know about nothing 
 Now you know all about nothing 
 I put you on to that
