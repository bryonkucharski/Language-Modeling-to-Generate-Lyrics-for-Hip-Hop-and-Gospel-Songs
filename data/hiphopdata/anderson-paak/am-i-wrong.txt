Well I 
 Well I 
 I'm only comin' out to play 
 Nothin' more that I hate in this life 
 The wrong impression, I only have one to make 
 You can open your palm 
 Waiting to catch a break 
 The cards will fall where they may 
 And what about me? 
 I believe in fate 
 They wanna know where I'll be in five 
 What about today? 
 What about tonight? 
 Only one at a time 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 Only one at a time 
 My life, my life 
 Am I wrong to assume 
 If she can dance, then she can't ooh? 
 Am I wrong to say 
 If she can dance, then she can't ooh? 
 I never wanna waste your time, my life 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 And look at the time, my God 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 Only one at a time 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 Only one at a time 
 My life, my life 
 Smiles around tHe clock 
 Dance around tHe globe to Disco 54 
 I stare at you in tHe eyes and spin you on your toes 
 Music ain't music witHout soul 
 Feelin' tHe top row 
 SHut tHe blindfolds, pass tHe nitro 
 Rock tHe love boat, get HigH or get low 
 CHill tHe Merlot, steady your fast pour 
 Make love 
 Do tHat-tHat-tHat 
 Break you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat 
 Never seen a one tHis gorgeous 
 Pay your wHole damn mortgage 
 Will you look at tHe time? 
 Still you tHe one on my mind 
 Still you tHe top of tHe line 
 THank God tHat it's Friday 
 TonigHt let's be tHe life of tHe party 
 It's up to me 
 Get up and move your feet 
 I never wanna waste your time, my life 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 And look at the time, my God 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 I never wanna waste your time, my life 
 So precious, is yours, is mine 
 And look at the time, my God 
 So precious, is yours, is mine
