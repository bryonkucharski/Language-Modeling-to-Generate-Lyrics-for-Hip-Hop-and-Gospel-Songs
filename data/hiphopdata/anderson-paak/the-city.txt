Venice, California 
 Known then as "Venice, Slum By the Sea" 
 There's no need to wear these shades when I drive 
 I need to see the leap before the stride 
 There's so much more that can happen 
 I'm sure that you can imagine 
 I live around here 
 Let me show you how to walk it, stop the traffic 
 Them two legs will get you right for action with good brain 
 That get you all the answers 
 That get you all the cash and fashion, just bat your lashes and 
 Tell me where you wanna go 
 But I don't really think that it could get much better 
 The city I love, city I love, city I love 
 You tellin' me you wanna break free, I bet you never 
 Bet you never 
 Powder your nose, love 
 Smoke if you want to 
 Put your feet in the water 
 The city belongs to you girl 
 It's all for you 
 Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you) 
 So when you're living the dream is it hard to see 
 Does your heart beat heavenly 
 I think it's much more than the green leaf but it helps of course 
 There's only one season 
 Can you believe the way that they talk about my paradise 
 We don't need that kind of vibe, no no 
 Don't tell me where you're from girl 
 Tell me where you wanna get to 
 The city I love, city I love, city I love 
 You wanna break free on me, I bet you never 
 Bet you never 
 Powder your nose, love 
 Smoke if you want to 
 Put your feet in the water 
 The city belongs to you girl 
 It's all for you 
 Don't tell me where you're from girl 
 Tell me where you wanna get to 
 Put your feet in the water 
 The city belongs to you girl 
 It's all for you 
 Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)
