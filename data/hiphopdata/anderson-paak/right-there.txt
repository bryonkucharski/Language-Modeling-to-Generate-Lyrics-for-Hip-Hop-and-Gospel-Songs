I'm so tired of good health 
 I'm so tired of this roof and my bed 
 I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods 
 A good coup with A/C to cruise 
 So tired of myself, my word and my wealth 
 Too big is my heart, too small are my cares 
 Then she said ... 
 I'm so tired of making love 
 I'm so tired of being kissed 
 I'm so tired of making money 
 So tired of this kush and my splif, it don't make sense 
 I'm so tired of my family, my friends 
 I'm so tired of one night stands 
 So tired of living lavish 
 Two birds and one nest and being notorious 
 Even when you're gone I can still feel you 
 I want it more than air 
 And don't you care? 
 That's not fair 
 The only thing you ever really loved 
 Was right there, right there, right there 
 Even when you're gone I can still feel you 
 I want it more than air 
 And don't you care? 
 That's not fair 
 The only thing you ever really loved 
 Was right there, right there, right there, right there 
 I'm so tired of this scene 
 I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze 
 So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep 
 So tired of this dream (reoccurring) 
 Your smile, your charm, your patience, loyalty, your love 
 Ain't you tired of me? 
 To have it all but not at all complete 
 Wanting you is all that ever drives my being 
 That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over 
 All my energy... 
 It's all that ever drives my being 
 Even when you're gone I can still feel you 
 I want it more than air 
 And don't you care? 
 That's not fair 
 The only thing you ever really loved 
 Was right there, right there, right there 
 Even when you're gone I can still feel you 
 I want it more than air 
 And don't you care? 
 That's not fair 
 The only thing you ever really loved 
 Was right there, right there, right there, right there, right there
