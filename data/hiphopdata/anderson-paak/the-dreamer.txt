I enjoy some of the old and I enjoy the new 
 And if I can find a balance between it, that's where I find my satisfaction 
 Don't stop now, keep dreaming 
 Don't stop now, keep dreaming 
 Don't stop now, keep dreaming 
 Don't stop now, keep dreaming 
 Don't stop now (yeah), keep dreaming 
 I'm on my fifth brew and my rents due 
 Sixth and west roof 
 I can see it all 
 Hold on to my head, that's my little dude 
 Look at Kenzo, swagging like it's paw 
 One for the occasion and get ya good suit 
 Fuck your reservation 
 Bitch, I brought 'em all 
 Look at where you came from, Californication 
 Since a little baby skating in boogie boards 
 And raiding your cookie jar, my radio analog 
 I wanted them Nike's 
 Mama got me Lugz 
 (And all) 
 This one's for all the little dreamers 
 And the ones who never gave a fuck 
 I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch 
 Living room, watching old reruns 
 And who cares your daddy couldn't be here? 
 Mama always kept the cable on 
 I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch 
 Living room, watching old reruns 
 One for the occasion 
 Fuck your reservation 
 Call up all the haters, It's official 
 Californication, Ever since a baby 
 Radio and the cable 
 I got the dish, too 
 This one's for all the little dreamers 
 And the ones who never gave a fuck 
 I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch 
 Living room, watching old reruns 
 And who cares your daddy couldn't be here? 
 Mama always kept the cable on 
 I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch 
 Living room, watching old reruns 
 Don't stop now, keep dreaming

 This is the music that you gotta feel 
 Gave you the truth before I got a deal 
 No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield 
 More like a panther. Huey Newton, Bobby Seale 
 Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become? 
 Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked? 
 Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel 
 Yeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal 
 No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield 
 More like a panther. Huey Newton, Bobby Seale 
 Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become? 
 Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked? 
 Used to be scared of all my fears 
 Till I woke up from this nightmare 
 Now what become of a dreamer (?) 
 Now until we leave this earth 
 The music make your speakers burst 
 I always put my people first 
 It's deep how when I speak they say 
 I'm preaching like I lead a church 
 No proper opposition. Competition gonna need a nurse 
 My job as an artist is making miracles 
 To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical 
 Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you 
 And make the revolution irresistible 
 This one's for all the little dreamers 
 And the ones who never gave a fuck

 Don't stop now, keep dreaming 
 Oh my gosh guys calm down 
 Stop it 
 Now evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning 
 There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history 
 And I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again 
 Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy 
 But there are other areas that are magnificent, treasures of this world 
 And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure 
 They can find this way of living
