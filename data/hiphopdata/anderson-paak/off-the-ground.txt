 And it's on now

 Suddenly suddenly suddenly 
 Off the ground 
 I'm lifting it up 
 Sending it sending it sending it 
 Off the ground 
 I'm lifting it up 
 Cooling it cooling it cooling it 
 Cool it down 
 I'm lifting you off the ground 
 I'm getting you off 
 It's on right now

 We can live this life forever more
