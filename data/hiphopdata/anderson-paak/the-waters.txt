Yes lord, yeah 
 Tried to tell niggas, in 2012, nigga 
 Working hand to hand and no avail 
 Volume one was too heavy for you frail niggas 
 So I got leaned like codeine and pills 
 It's the visionary, in the vintage Chevy 
 It's been a while but wow you still care 
 Free Nash 'til the pass out obituaries 
 In bold caps, "your bitch-ass was not there" 
 And I can do anything but move backwards 
 The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted 
 My big sister still claim me on them taxes 
 Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this 
 Gave my momma ten racks 
 And she packed and went to Chumash with it 
 Could triple the worth and give me half of it 
 Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress 
 A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxs' 
 The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM 
 Whack niggas dropping links in my DM 
 Bad bitches up and down a nigga TM 
 I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late 
 And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof 
 If you want you could wait outside the building 
 I ain't takin' no more meetings 
 Stepped in the waters 
 The water was cold 
 Chi in my body 
 But not in my soul 
 I bring you greetings from the first church of Goon Baptists 
 United Fellowship of Free Nationals 
 Residing pastor is thy .Paak 
 And the first lady is a bad bitch 
 With slanted eyelids and sick hashish 
 Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas 
 Sweating on my Patent Leathers 
 Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella 
 I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers 
 We'll do one better 
 Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver 
 I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling 
 To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing 
 Only a handful will go the distance 
 I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing 
 While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout, what they could do 
 I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo 
 I was in the jungle running with Zulu's 
 We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast 
 You had to be shopping at Ginsu 
 To the top of the food group 
 Doing what I want and how I should too 
 Stepped in the waters 
 The water was cold 
 Chi in my body 
 But it didn't touch my soul 
 Stepped in the waters 
 The water was cold 
 Chi in my body 
 But it didn't touch my soul 
 Ladies in gentlemen, the most fantastic day in history 
 Would you boys mind explaining the cause 
 Of what made this great park go underneath this hood 
 Take a look at this
