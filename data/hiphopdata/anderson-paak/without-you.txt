Yeah 
 All the kissin', attention, the bitin', the tuckin' 
 You know I love what you do 
 You know I know you love what I do 
 And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin' 
 You know I'm only fuckin' with you 
 I bet you I was over-thinkin' 
 If I could, I'd take you everywhere 
 But you know I can't do nothin' with you 
 You know I can't do nothin' with you 
 And I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth 
 No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you 
 And I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction 
 I don't need it, I'mma slay this bitch and take ya shoppin' 
 'Cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces? 
 I would rather have no feelings, than cryin' and sobbin' 
 When I met you, I was broke as the rope on the faucet 
 I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge 
 I was hungry, I was dirty, I needed a shower 
 Since you found me, you clothed me, you packed me a sack lunch 
 Pop a zit, when I get older, get a girl like your momma 
 But I'm twenty years old and runnin' out of options 
 How I'm supposed to trust ya? 
 Ain't you one of them ones tryin' to run up, pose for the perfect picture, load and post it? 
 Question: is you with me or not? 
 I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought 
 But I'm used to having cyclones, in and out of my life so it's no biggie if you need time to figure it out 
 Yeah 
 All the kissin', attention, the bitin', the tuckin' 
 You know I love what you do 
 You know I know you love what I do 
 And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin' 
 You know I'm only fuckin' with you 
 I bet you I was over-thinkin' 
 If I could, I'd take you everywhere 
 But you know I can't do nothin' with you 
 You know I can't do nothin' with you 
 And I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth 
 No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you 
 You know you wrong, shit you out of pocket 
 Remember you was couch surfin', you ain't have a casa 
 And mi casa, I would buy you shoes from out the locker 
 And even though I heard around the town from all the gossip 
 Between they legs, and slidin' limousines in garages 
 Heard your mama cheated on ya daddy, you just like her 
 Come-a-come around, remember what happened to Tiger 
 Game over, dead wrong, Biggie Wallace 
 I was the one you counted one before you stacked your wallets 
 Talkin' 'bout me, motherfucker you the one with problems 
 Haha, you played yourself for a photo, but you ain't know though 
 I only took from niggas trying to slide up in the DM 
 And show them I was happy with the nigga I was seein' 
 But you fucked up stupid, so I guess I'll go and see 'em 
 And you contemplate how to get me back like Liam 
 No fuckin' or not, I'll be gone by the PM 
 Yeah 
 All the kissin', attention, the bitin', the tuckin' 
 You know I love what you do 
 You know I know you love what I do 
 And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin' 
 You know I'm only fuckin' with you 
 I bet you I was over-thinkin' 
 If I could, I'd take you everywhere 
 But you know I can't do nothin' with you 
 You know I can't do nothin' with you 
 And I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth 
 No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you 
 Why not, get, Why not, get any better 
 Why not, get, why not, get any better 
 Why not, get, why not, get any better
