Yeah, all of that ass you carrying 
 You gotta be shitting me 
 All that body that you came with 
 But where are you mentally 
 I know he hit all the time 
 But you ain't gonna hit for me 
 I just wanna focus on and love this 
 What's behind them tig-ol-bitties 
 They say the heart is underneath 
 Underneath and guarded in securities 
 I finally found the key 
 Underneath the garments that's the double D's 
 Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby 
 Don't turn a frown, make an ass out yourself, baby 
 Open your heart 
 What's behind them tig-ol-bitties 
 I don't mind them little bitty berries 
 You my Ju-Ju-Be 
 I don't need nothing to distract me 
 From this connectivity 
 You know I see it all the time 
 The same old shit to me 
 I just wanna know what's under 
 That tender titty meat 
 They say the heart is underneath 
 Underneath the guard of insecurities 
 I finally found the key 
 Underneath the garments that's the double D's 
 Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby 
 Don't turn a frown, make an ass out yourself, baby 
 Open your heart 
 What's behind them tig-ol-bitties 
 Before you go and pop that bottom baby 
 Before you go and get butt naked baby 
 I know you gotta little bit of baggage baby 
 Never mind I'mma look past it 
 Big cans in the cooler, let me handle it baby 
 Two jugs I'm gonna start grasping you baby 
 Separation between truth and the fake 
 You can get a new rack for five k 
 You can get a rapper by Friday 
 You gon' have to replace being cheapskate, just save it 
 Can a nigga squeeze or should I just be safe 
 (Yeah for-sure) Tell me what it reads on the expiration date 
 (Well I just got them, should be good for about ten years or so) 
 I know you feel the D when a nigga deep in the hole 
 But do you feel the peace when I'm sucking them, baby doll? 
 (Can you fuck me already?) 
 Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby 
 Don't turn a frown, make an ass out yourself, baby 
 Open your heart 
 What's behind them tig-ol-bitties 
 Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby 
 What's behind them tig-ol-bitties 
 For me I can't live in the Northern Hemisphere 
 I must live, back, back in the time 
 Where all these animals, all this sea life, all the oysters, shellfish, crustaceans, everything is part of the smell 
 Everything has come into the focus of the full experience
