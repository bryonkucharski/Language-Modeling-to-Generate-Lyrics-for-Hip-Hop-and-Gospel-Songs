You pickin' on me? 
 (No, why are you saying that?) 
 Why are you picking on me? 
 (Why would I do that? Now let me ask you this question) 
 Why you pickin' on me? 
 Shut up and sit down! I told you to sit down! 
 Don't use it all at once 
 Baby girl, your prime is about that long 
 Don't use it. Timing is all we got 
 Baby girl, your prime is about that long 
 Oh, hell no 
 I had to get back for the candy, uh 
 I flew for an hour than landed, oh 
 She live on a beautiful campus, oh 
 She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes 
 Know what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh 
 She soaking up game 
 Her brain is a series of pamphlets, wow 
 She told me a story as long as the last 
 Oh what a hopeless romantic 
 Fucking with jokers and addict 
 She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit 
 I said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even known enough to be jaded' 
 And wow, she want visual stimulation 
 Short attention span and little patience 
 I like Hennessy and record players 
 Teddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis 
 Opposites attract. I swear, we a magnet 
 Don't be fucking up your scholarship 
 I can't help you with grants 
 Word to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor 
 As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed 
 Don't use it all at once 
 Baby girl, your prime is about that long 
 (Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed) 
 I only want to do what feels right 
 I have to be gone before the midterms 
 You making up your mind, you're out of songs aren't you? 
 You wanted an encore, more tunes 
 Hey, come back to bed 
 Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah 
 Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah 
 Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah 
 Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah 
 Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah 
 Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah 
 Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah 
 Come jump in the bed 
 Don't use it all at once 
 Baby girl, your prime is about that long 
 Timing is all we got 
 Baby girl, your prime is about that long
