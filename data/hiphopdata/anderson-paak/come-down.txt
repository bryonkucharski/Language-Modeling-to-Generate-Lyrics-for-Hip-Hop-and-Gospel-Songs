You niggas got me high 
 Niggas, tell me how? 
 Hey! Well that's exactly what a nigga came for 
 Huh, you doin' shots from afar 
 Imma meet you at your front door 
 Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty 
 Huh, but don't I make it look easy 
 Don't I make it look good 
 Now you, drank up all my liquor, come on 
 What I'm 'posed to do now? 
 And you talkin' all that shit, now come on 
 You gonna have to back it up 
 If I get too high now, sugar, come on 
 I might never come down 
 You know I might never come down 
 Let me get down 
 You might not never come down 
 Now let me come down 
 You might not never come down 
 Let me get down! 
 You may never ever come down 
 It took too long to get this high off the ground 
 Don't run, just stay awhile 
 Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it with the big bad door 
 Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci pants on 
 Let me take these bitches off 
 Let me get the full scope, hold up 
 Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture 
 Let me pull it to the pre-show 
 Wow, Cool beans, cool beans 
 That's a whole lot of reefer 
 Let me help you with the pre-roll 
 You, drank up all my liquor, come on 
 What I'm 'posed to do now? 
 And you talkin' all that shit, now come on 
 You gonna have to back it up 
 If I get too high now, sugar, come on 
 I might never come down 
 You know I might never come down 
 Let me get down 
 You might not never come down 
 Now let me come down 
 You might not never come down 
 Let me get down! 
 You may never ever come down 
 It took too long to get this high off the ground 
 Don't run, just stay awhile 
 You may never ever come down 
 It took too long to get this high off the ground 
 Don't run, just stay awhile
