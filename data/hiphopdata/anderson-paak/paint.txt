Ugh, that what you need? (ugh say) 
 Ugh, you need 
 Say, is that what you need? 
 Ugh, you need 
 All I see is angels, demons 
 Soft lights a bitch sounds 
 From your first dream that be a sinner 
 Running like your running for the gold one (gold one) 
 Back and forth of course it's never no one 
 They just want to frame you in the same shit (same shit) 
 Never been afraid to let it go (let it go) 
 I just want to run it on the canvas 
 Brushes stroke is stroking but she go nuts 
 Speak of me as something you can ride on 
 Guess how many pages put you open up the gate and get it 
 All day, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Mix it, clip it, switch it then 
 Change it, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Paint, paint, paint 
 Change it 
 Paint, paint 
 Ch' Change it 
 (Eh Oh Eh) 
 All I see is angels, demons 
 Soft lights a bitch sounds 
 From your first dream that be a sinner 
 Excuse for me not to to keep you creaming 
 Creaming, creaming, creaming, creaming 
 Different, different colours that your changing (paint, paint) 
 A million ways a minute till it blows up (change it) 
 Fighting on your face, just face it (face it) 
 Take it till you say it 
 I am going to open up your place and paint it 
 All day, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Mix it, clip it, switch it then 
 Change it, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Ugh, that what you need (ugh say) 
 Ugh, you need 
 Say, is that what you need? 
 Ugh, you need 
 All I see is angels, demons 
 Soft lights a bitch sounds 
 From your first your first dream be a sinner 
 Looking like you woke up got a dreaming 
 Fishing where you living but there's no luck 
 Who can paint the picture like dale 
 Mixing different colours what I can do 
 I just want to run it on your canvas 
 Stroking but she pushes stroking but she go nuts 
 Speak of me on something you can ride on 
 Guess how many stages put you open up the gates and get it 
 All day, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Mix it, clip it, switch it then 
 Change it, no breaks 
 All day, no breaks 
 Paint, paint 
 Change it 
 Paint, paint 
 Change it
