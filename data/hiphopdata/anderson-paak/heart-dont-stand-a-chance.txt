Ooh, champagne pourin' down 
 Arms, legs wrapped around you 
 Ooh, champagne, let it fall down 
 Arms, legs keep grabbing 
 See, I be catchin' you starin', be careful 
 Though I don't mind, it's a dangerous place to be left in 
 But keep your eyes on me 
 Your heart don't stand a chance 
 It feels like it's been far too long 
 Your knees can't hold your legs 
 Your feet just want to pace 
 The eyes keep me all in a trance 
 Let me ask you 
 Would you leave it all in the back of your head 
 Or all in the palm of my hand? 
 Ain't nobody holding you back 
 Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? 
 Your heart don't stand a chance 
 Your knees just want to break 
 Your eyes keep me all in a trance 
 And let me ask you 
 I know the approach is so far from what you're used to 
 But you know it 
 And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon? 
 Baby, of course I do 
 And I'm not closing my tab 
 Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? 
 Your heart don't stand a chance 
 Ooh, champagne pourin' down 
 Arms, legs wrapped around you 
 Ooh, champagne, let it fall down 
 Arms, legs keep grabbing 
 Two-step in the corridor 
 Spinning the greatest hits of Hall and Oates 
 Open of chronic smoke 
 I know my time will flee 
 But your heart don't stand a chance 
 It feels like it's been far too long 
 The moment is all that we have 
 My meter should be up by the half 
 A ticket is the least of my cares 
 So let me ask you 
 Am I dreaming? 
 Mind on a tip of a cloud 
 Or is it real as the stone in your crown? 
 Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag 
 Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? 
 Your heart don't stand a chance 
 I'm waiting for the white flag 
 You're talking with the blunt in your hand 
 And won't you pass that? 
 I know, in the morning 
 The sunlight cover your wounds 
 But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew 
 Baby, of course, I flew 
 But I'm not over what we had 
 Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? 
 Your heart don't stand a chance 
 Ooh, champagne pourin' down 
 Arms, legs wrapped around you 
 Ooh, champagne, let it fall down 
 Arms, legs keep grabbing 
 I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was 
 And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water
