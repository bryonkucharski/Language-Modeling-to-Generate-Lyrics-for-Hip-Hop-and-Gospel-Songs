A bird with the word came to me 
 The sweetness of a honeycomb tree 
 And now my luck was taking over me 
 Couldn't fake it if I wanted to 
 I had to wake up just to make it through 
 I got my patience and I'm making do 
 I learned my lessons from the ancient roots 
 I choose to follow what the greatest do 
 A bird with the word came to me 
 The sweetness of a honeycomb tree 
 And now my luck was taking over me 
 Couldn't fake it if I wanted to 
 I had to wake up just to make it through 
 I got my patience and I'm making do 
 I learned my lessons from the ancient roots 
 I choose to follow what the greatest do 
 I'm repping for the longest cycle, mmm 
 My uncles had to pay the cost, mmm 
 My sister used to sing to Whitney, mmm 
 My mama caught the gambling bug, mmm 
 We came up in a lonely castle, mmm 
 My papa was behind them bars, mmm 
 We never had to want for nothing, mmm 
 Said all we ever need is love, mmm 
 We see the same things 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 We sing the same songs 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 We feel the same grief 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Bleed the same blood 
 You grew up in the home beside me 
 I always had a friend to call 
 How could I make it here without you? Mmm 
 I pray I leave before you're gone 
 A bird with a word came to me 
 The sweetness of a honeycomb tree 
 And now I look, what's taking over me 
 Couldn't fake it if I wanted to 
 I had to wake up, just to make it through 
 I got my patience and I'm making do 
 I learned my lessons from the ancient roots 
 I choose to follow what the greatest do 
 A bird with the word came to me 
 The sweetness of a honeycomb tree

 I learned my lessons from the ancient roots 
 I choose to follow what the greatest do 
 Hey, my little youth is crying 
 I'm almost home, almost home 
 Look no further riots, mmm 
 Working my fingers to the bone 
 See I do the best I can, mmm 
 Mama was a farmer, mmm 
 Papa was a goner, mmm
