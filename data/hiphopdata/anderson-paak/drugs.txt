She don't give a fuck 
 She don't ever stress me 
 We don't even talk 
 All we do is sex and leave 
 No there's no love 
 She don't even like me 
 But if we have drugs 
 She can be my wifey 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 I got lost up in it, got lost up in it, got high for a minute 
 Said my lust for life and these lights are bright and I love these women 
 Said we bopping slow and we do the dance like we more than winning 
 Said she off the beat but she's fine as fuck so I find the rhythm 
 No love is greater, in this whole world we made up 
 This love is made-up, it's made-up 
 It's made-up, it's made-up, it's made-up (say, aye) 
 I don't know this bitch but I love this shit and we both are splendid 
 And she loud as fuck so I grab and touch and she don't get offended 
 They goin' call the law if we don't get lost in (???) parking lot 
 She don't like me dog, she just like the drugs my nigga, don't get it twisted 
 How many more can you give to me? 
 How many more can you give to me? I know you're feelin' me 
 Grinding and biting and kissing me 
 Who gives a fuck bout your history? nobody mentioned it 
 I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog 
 Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain't in love 
 She don't give a fuck 
 She don't ever stress me 
 We don't even talk 
 All we do is sex and leave 
 No there's no love 
 She don't even like me 
 But if we have drugs 
 She can be my wifey 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 You my one and only, my one and only, I'm on one homie 
 I don't know your name I just love that ass, and I'll pull that pony 
 Said I hate the club, but I make the club when I walk into it 
 Said you hate the drink, but you take the drink when I offer fluid 
 No love is greater, in this whole world we made up 
 This love is made-up, it's made-up, it's made-up, it's made-up, it's made-up 
 I can say right now that I'll lay you down, I got lots of rubbers 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck, we was made for each other 
 Your friend ain't cute but my nigga's a trooper, he'll take the L 
 I'm high as fuck and you high as fuck so we parasailing 
 How many more can you give to me? How many more can you give to me? I know you're feelin' me 
 Grinding and biting and kissing me, who gives a fuck bout your history, nobody mentioned it 
 I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog 
 Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain't in love 
 She don't give a fuck 
 She don't ever stress me 
 We don't even talk 
 All we do is sex and leave 
 No there's no love 
 She don't even like me 
 But if we have drugs 
 She can be my wifey 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs 
 When we have drugs

 Say love, say love, say love
