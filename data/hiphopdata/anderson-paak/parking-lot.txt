You told me your whole life story in a few shorts 
 All the while, I never knew the tone of your voice 
 A half an hour, I ramble on way too much 
 (My love) 
 Alone with my own thoughts 
 (My love) 
 (1, 2, 3, come on-) Enough is enough 
 There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me 
 I'm in a communion, I got needs 
 The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong dreams 
 (Come on, you f-) 
 I don't remember the parking lot 
 I just remember it's all the same 
 (Come on, you f-) 
 (My love) 
 And it's all the same 
 (My love) 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on- 
 (Remember it's all-) 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on- 
 Bring the corners from left to right 
 I'm in the mode to take you to crossfade 
 Coming closer to midnight 
 And I'm wide awake 
 And ain't you afraid to fade? 
 Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date 
 But you made me wait 
 So it takes one to make one 
 The compromise we made 
 Please believe me 
 I don't recall the parking lot 
 I just remember it's all the same 
 And it's all the same 
 It's all the s- 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on- 
 (My love) 
 Come on, you feel me 
 (My love) 
 Come on- 
 (Remember the parking lot) 
 Come on, you feel me (My love) 
 Come on, you feel me 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love) 
 1, 2, 3, come on- 
 Come on, you feel me (My love) 
 Come on, you feel me (It's all the same) 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love) 
 1, 2, 3, come on- 
 1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me 
 Come on, you f- 
 1, 2, 3 
 Feel me 
 (Have mercy, baby! 
 Can you dig it? Can you dig it?)
