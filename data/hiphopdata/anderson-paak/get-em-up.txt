All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 Kim plays with the heart strings, 
 Late nights in the basement, 
 Kills me with them soft notes, 
 Offbeat placements, 
 So sweet with the long notes, 
 Blue dream with the light glow, 
 I'll wait for the next show, 
 But if you leave then I might roll. 
 On your marks, 
 When you're ready, 
 Let me start, 
 Okay, two shots and a slow dance, 
 We walk to your home... 
 Keep up, keep up, keep up if you can, 
 Something different ain't it, 
 Nothing like we planned, 
 This ain't complicated, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air, 
 We walk in the same directions with no common plans, 
 Just the nature of a man, prob'ly cover good good good, 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 And if it's love, then it's love, 
 And if it's not love then it's all love, 
 All up in the air, All up in the air, 
 And if it's love, then it's real, 
 And if it's not love then it's no deal, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air. 
 (Get 'em up), 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 All up in the air, 
 (Yeah), Slow dance in your compound when you're off that brown, 
 Freelance in your hometown and it's good work now, 
 Set it all down, 
 (Set it all down) 
 Set it all, set it all, set it all back down. 
 (Yeah) On your marks, 
 When you're ready, 
 Let me start, (okay) 
 Smooth talking and they stare, 
 How often are you here? 
 Keep on, keep on, keep on if you care. 
 Something different ain't it? 
 This ain't like we planned, 
 This ain't complicated, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air, 
 We walk in the same direction with no common plans, 
 Guess it's just the nature of a man, 
 Prob'ly cover good good good, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air, 
 And if it's love, then it's love, 
 And if it's not love then it's all love, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air, 
 And if it's love then it's real, 
 And if it's not love then it's no deal, 
 All up in the air, all up in the air, 
 (Get 'em up), 
 All up in the air, all up in the air. 
 All up in the air, all up in the air,
