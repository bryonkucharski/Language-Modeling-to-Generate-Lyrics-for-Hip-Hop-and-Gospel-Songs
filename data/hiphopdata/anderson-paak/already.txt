 Said 
 I'm naked down to my socks 
 Bitch I'm Anthony Kiedis 
 All this shaman I got 
 Put that right to your sneezers 
 Ride around on my block 
 VTA 2K Teasey 
 Fuck the police - 
 Okay back to my thesis 
 Hoes don't love 'em, don't treat 'em 
 I just teach 'em to stroke 'em 
 Pass that over to LODEF 
 He gon' pass it to hoder 
 He gon' lend it Nikos 
 Okay bases are loaded 
 Then she make it to Parker 
 She MVP with the trophy 
 Like get it right with the shotty 
 But it's made with a fender 
 Flavour flay with the top 
 I had no time to play pitches 
 You niggas acting like goalies 
 Yous a hatin' defender 
 I stay on Ps and Qs 
 Since the type of my sentence 
 And I'm ready 
 If I don't go 
 Don't go 
 Don't go 
 I'm ready 
 Don't go 
 Don't go 
 Don't 
 Motherfucker I'm ready 
 They oughta know 
 They oughta see 
 How you feeling, oh, that's that masterpiece 
 Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up) 
 We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up) 
 Pick on the floorda, they gonna pop that cola 
 Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga here get rolled up 
 Slow motion watch me win that corner (Win that corner) 
 Slow motion let she give me more, muh 
 I can't stand what you got 
 Girl your ass is Movado 
 I can't help but to watch 
 Collard greens in my pocket 
 All these clouds I think I finally see the top 
 And motherfucker I'm ready 
 If I don't go 
 I don't go 
 I don't go 
 I don't go 
 I'm ready 
 If I don't go 
 If I don't go 
 If I don't go 
 Motherfucker I'm ready

 If I don't go 
 If I don't go
