I can't wait for the moment you can take off 
 I pray you don't have to cut my time short 
 I would rather not say much 
 But if I do, it will be forward 
 I can't pull no punches, baby doll 
 The gods have approved 
 The universe is in tune with me and you 
 That's why we here involved 
 I'm too in love 
 What you do this for? 
 Your body moves and fluid motion 
 Hands in two and two 
 Who's it for? Ooh, it's yours 
 I don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with 
 But I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum 
 And as soon as I break down the wall 
 I'm riding the wave of your waterfall 
 As soon as I break down the wall 
 I'm riding the wave of your waterfall 
 As soon as I break down the wall 
 I'm riding the wave of your waterfall 
 Ooh, don't touch me baby 
 Don't touch me baby 
 Wait, I'm okay, I'm alright 
 Give me space, don't touch me baby
