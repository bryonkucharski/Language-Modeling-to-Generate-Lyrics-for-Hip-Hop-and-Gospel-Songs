(A little surfer music, baby 
 A blast from your golden past) 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be like that 
 You don't need me in that light 
 It's all right with me 
 Just send it off and I'll give it right back 
 Right down to the last face 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be light weight 
 You know I really can't fuss about it 
 You know I really can't funk without it 
 You know I really can't funk without it 
 You know I really can't fuss about it 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be like that 
 You don't need me in that light 
 It's all right with me 
 Just send it off and I'll give it right back 
 Right down to the last face 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be light weight 
 (You know I seen you from afar, right?) 
 You know I really can't fuss about it 
 You know I really can't funk without it 
 You know I really can't funk without it 
 You know I really can't fuss about it 
 (Thought you might've wanted to say somethin' 
 So I was comin' up to you 
 It's cool if I come up to you, right?) 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be like that 
 You don't need me in that light 
 It's all right with me 
 Just send it off and I'll give it right back 
 Right down to the last face 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 No time to be light weight 
 (Hey, you got a light? 
 Oh, yes, here you are 
 Thanks, you want a toke? 
 No, no thanks 
 This stuff is getting harder to get 
 Johnny 
 Yeah
