Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro 
 Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat 
 Had to clean up her nose, Had to dream of some goals 
 Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned 
 I was walking down sixth, She pulled up in a 6 
 She said, "Hop in this whip" 
 I said, "Bitch, you da feds" 
 She said, "Baby don't trip" 
 Then she rolled me a spliff, showed me pics of her kids 
 Then she slid me some bread like 
 It's yours babe 
 'Cause I got big money 
 So if you need something don't be ashamed 
 It's yours babe 
 'Cause you got big lovin' 
 So go and spend somethin' 
 I said, "Okay" 
 All I need is good love 
 Hey, all a nigga need is good love 
 Uh huh 
 And now I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 Swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 Dick in this bitch's stomach 
 Spending this bitch's money

 Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey

 Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey 
 Dick in this bitch's stomach 
 Spending this bitch's money 
 It's too good to be true, I ain't got nothing to do 
 I got keys to the coup, I just spent all this loot 
 She said, "Get what you want" 
 She said, "Live how you do 
 But If I catch you with other bitches your throat I'mma slit" 
 I said, "It's yours babe. I put your name on this dick" 
 But I was lyin' of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick 
 Soon as she gave me the Porche, I bang her right on the strip 
 I copped some white in the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like 
 It's yours babe 
 'Cause I got big money 
 So if you need something don't be ashamed 
 It's yours babe 
 'Cause you got big lovin' 
 So go and spend somethin' 
 I said, "Okay" 
 All I need is good love 
 Hey, all a nigga need is good love 
 Uh huh 
 And now I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey

 Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey

 Dick in this bitch's stomach 
 Spending this bitch's money 
 I got gold, I got ice 
 I got Polo and Nikes 
 I got lean, I got sprite 
 'Bout to spend a couple racks in one night 
 And muthafuckas wanna tell me take it light 
 Muthafuckas wanna tell me take it easy 
 I don't need no one's advice, Niggas all wana be me 
 I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs 
 They said, "Hop out the whip!" 
 I said, "Fuck did I do?" 
 They said, "Pop up the trunk!" 
 I'm like pop up this dick 
 They said, "Don't make us shoot!" 
 They said, "Don't make a move!" 
 I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white 
 I looked up at the light like what the fuck is my life 
 They said my plates ain't legit so they opened my shit 
 And when they opened my shit, It was snow in the fridge 
 I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea 
 She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit 
 And this bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners 
 And when I called her from my cell the only message I heard was 
 "It's yours babe" 
 "I mean you gotta do what you gotta do 
 Don't y--, don't say a fucking word 
 No, you don't say shit 
 Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane babe 
 But no you wanted to spend the money 
 You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large 
 You got new sneakers and all that 
 So now you deal with them bricks 
 Na na na na nah I can't do nothin' for you 
 I told you I'm on a G5, I'm gone 
 I'm too gone 
 I gotta go now 
 You say my fucking name you a dead man" 
 (I said okay) 
 All I need is good love 
 Hey, all a nigga need is good love 
 Uh huh
