Besides surfing, what do you think about? Love, for instance? 
 I don't think about it, I make it 
 Baby there's room in here 
 Just enough for two in here 
 Ain't nobody but you and me in here 
 Yeah, what can we do in here? 
 What can we do? What can we do? 
 I want you by my lonesome, above this counter space 
 It's easy and wholesome when no one's in the way 
 Well if no one's in the running for the part 
 I'd love to pick a day 
 To show you the main room (Whatever's a good time) 
 I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space 
 Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days 
 I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye 
 Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm 
 Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine 
 Cause baby there's room in here 
 Just enough for two in here 
 Ain't nobody but you and me in here 
 Yeah, what can we do in here? 
 What can we do? What can we do? 
 As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read 
 It's too many if's and maybe's, and not enough certainty 
 Well if no one's putting numbers on the board 
 I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you 
 But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind 
 Take a look at the moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes 
 We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline 
 Take a puff of that *exhales*, get a sip of this wine 
 Yeah, feelin' good? 
 Cause baby there's room in here 
 Just enough for two in here 
 Ain't nobody but you and me in here 
 Yeah, what can we do in here? 
 What can we do? What can we do? 
 She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean 
 Whiter than a white T, remind me of wifey 
 Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer 
 She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi 
 She had this Asian swagger 'bout her, so I call her mai tai 
 Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline 
 And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit 
 That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to 
 But I'mma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all 
 Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on 
 I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long 
 She come and see me, but she don't stay long 
 And that's the problem, she a good girl 
 Maybe it's too much smoke in the room 
 And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon 
 So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber 
 Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter 
 Ay, .Paak 
 Baby there's room in here 
 Just enough for two in here 
 Ain't nobody but you and me in here 
 Yeah, what can we do in here? 
 What can we do? What can we do?
