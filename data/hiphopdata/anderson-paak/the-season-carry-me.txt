My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town 
 (Until it's paid for) 
 Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming 'round 
 (I hear it rain and pour) 
 How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing 
 (Forever grateful) 
 If I didn't love you then I damn sure love you now 
 (Fruit of your labor) 
 Say ain't shit change but the bank statements 
 Spent the summer in the rave with the beach babies 
 Threw your chula in the buggie 
 With the top down up the PCH 
 I'm heading north, I hope it doesn't rain 
 Went from playing community ball to balling with the majors 
 (Oh, what you major?) 
 Yeah nigga I ran bases, pitch flame 
 I call plays, remove labels 
 And fuck fame, that killed all my favourite entertainers 
 (Nothing short of amazing, ooh yeah) 
 But I'm short on my patience 
 See, I don't play that shit, I don't ever forget 
 And don't forget that dot, nigga you paid for it 
 I spent years being called out my name 
 Living under my greatness 
 But what don't kill me is motivation 
 My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town 
 (Until it's paid for) 
 Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming 'round 
 (I hear it rain and pour) 
 How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing 
 (Forever grateful) 
 If I didn't love you then I damn sure love you now 
 (Fruit of your labor) 
 : Carry Me 
 Six years old I tried my first pair of Jordans on 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 It was late in the fall I caught a glimpse of my first love, my god 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord 
 Why they had to take my ma? 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morn 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morning 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 Hey, hey, hey, gather 'round hustlers 
 That is if you're still living 
 And get on down before the judge give the sentence 
 A few more rounds before the feds come and get you 
 Is you gonna smile when your date gets issued 
 You know them feds taking pictures 
 Your mom's in prison, your father need a new kidney 
 You family's splitting, rivalries between siblings 
 If cash ain't king it's damn sure the incentive 
 And good riddance 
 Q: Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group? 
 A: Yes, you might say that. Why don't you give it a try and find out for yourself? 
 'Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped 
 Before K.Dot had it locked 
 I was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy 
 Tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn't get deported 
 Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit 
 Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion 
 What about your goals? What about your leverage? 
 So they don't force you into some hole 
 What's the meaning of my fortune meeting? 
 When I crack the cookie all it said was "keep dreaming" 
 When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing 
 Generations of harsh living and addiction 
 I came to visit during the seven year stint 
 But they wouldn't let me in because my license suspended 
 Now I'm scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek 
 It's gonna be a couple weeks before I get it 
 I know you miss me 
 Six years old I tried my first pair of Jordans on 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 It was late in the fall I caught a glimpse of my first love, my god 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord 
 Why they had to take my ma? 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morn 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morning 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 Yeah, oh, oh, oh 
 And one of these is my rise 
 One of these is my downfall 
 And I'm the one to make it right 
 I wanna make it right 
 And one of these is my rise 
 One of these is my downfall 
 And I'm the one to make it right 
 I wanna make it right 
 I wanna make it right 
 I wanna make it right 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morning 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 To the early morning 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 Oh lord 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?) 
 (Momma can you carry me?)
