I wake up early in the morning 
 Round the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassup) 
 And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk 
 Everybody in ma city show me love 
 Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer? 
 Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer? 
 My speakers out of space like ET... 
 Cops watch me all day like TV 
 SOD hit da club we be so deep... 
 Mine on D and I grind like a OG 
 I got 12 diamond chains like a Ozzy 
 Follow me like de wizard of Oz 
 Girls love my style 'cause it is so mean 
 Ask about me in da streets I spit so heat 
 Ain't nobody in da game messing with my click 
 Style swift hot like itz July 10th 
 Fly chick in my whip with nice tits 
 Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn't 
 Ice game, cold as a polar bear 
 Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare 
 We gettin' money over here hands in the air 
 Y'all making it too easy!, it's not fair 
 I wake up early in the morning 
 Round the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassupp) 
 And I'm tatted up, dat bang in my trunk 
 Everybody in ma city show me love 
 Because I got ma speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer? 
 Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer? 
 I remember back in the days mayne I was broke 
 These days soulja tell 'em run a hundred spokez 
 No joke, mayne I'm balling out the atmoshphere 
 Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here 
 I gotta my speakers going hamm in my Lamborghini 
 Two door coupe, girl in bikini 
 Passenger seat and she five star she so swagg 
 She so fabolous they way she throw it in the bag 
 Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I'm popping tags 
 Back then, u could catch me in a poniac 
 Theese days droptop phantom with a 100 stackz 
 Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back 
 Girls wet like they living in a fish tank 
 I'm getting money man what the fuck a bitch think 
 Young soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer 
 Like Rick Ross bitch I think I'm MC Hammer 
 I wake up early in the morning 
 Round the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbours like wassup (say wassup) 
 And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk 
 Everybody in ma city show me love 
 Because I got ma speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer? 
 Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
