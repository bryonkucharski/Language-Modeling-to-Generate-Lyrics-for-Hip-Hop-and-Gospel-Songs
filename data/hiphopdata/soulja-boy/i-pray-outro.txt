I can't quote the Bible 
 I skipped Sunday school 
 And I can't count the times I fell, and broke the golden rule 
 So I don't know if he listens 
 Sometimes I wonder if he cares 
 But maybe I'm just wishin' 
 'Cause I can't even prove he's there 
 But I pray 
 He'll watch over my children 
 I Pray 
 Just to be a better man 
 To find the strength to rise above 
 To be there for the ones I love 
 To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day 
 I pray 
 I confess that I don't bow my head as often as I should 
 Mostly just when times are bad, rarely when they're good 
 And I don't hold with too much preachin' 
 But I was raised up to believe 
 That a man can't ever stand as tall 
 As when he gets down on his knees 
 (2nd Chorus) 
 So I pray 
 For a world that's gone half crazy 
 I pray 
 For every woman, child and man 
 To find the strength to rise above 
 To teach each other how to love 
 To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day 
 I pray 
 I pray
