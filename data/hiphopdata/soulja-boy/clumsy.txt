She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh baby) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh baby) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh baby) 
 She can't help it 
 The first time that I saw your eyes 
 Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm 
 Play it cool, but I knew you knew 
 That cupid hit me, mmm, mmm 
 You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin' 
 Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love) 
 You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin' 
 Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love) 
 So in love with you 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh baby) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh no) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh how) 
 She can't help it 
 Can't breath, when you touch my sleeve 
 Butterflies so crazy, ummm, ummm 
 Whoa now? Think I'm goin' down 
 Friends don't know what's with me, mmm, mmm 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh no) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh please) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (no, no) 
 She can't help it 
 You know, this isn't the first time this has happened to me 
 This love sick thing 
 I like serious relationships and, uh 
 A girl like me don't stay single for long 
 Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up 
 My world is crushed, and I'm all alone 
 The love bug crawls right back up and bites me 
 And I'm back 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (in love) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (oh God) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (I'm back in love) 
 Girl can't help it 
 Woo, hoo, hoo 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah baby) 
 She can't help it 
 The girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah) 
 (Chorus: Repeat x2)
