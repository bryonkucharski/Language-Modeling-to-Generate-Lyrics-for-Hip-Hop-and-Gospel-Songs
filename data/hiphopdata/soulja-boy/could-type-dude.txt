 Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool thangs 
 I'm in a cool type mood I switch them 2 lanes 
 I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings 
 24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes 
 1st verse, 
 Y'all people never have heard of me 
 Hit them blocks on them 23s, 
 24s when I go and hit the show 
 Riding clean on boats and you already know 
 Soulja Boy hit the spot make them bad girls scream 
 Hit the scene playing slot machines 
 When I hit the spot in a limousine 
 On 23s paint candy green and color spreem 
 Double D thousand hop like a trampoline 
 Hit the scene and looking clean with my team or with my queen 
 Already know how I do rock candy red or candy blue 
 Gettin' money I thought you knew 
 Stand real and stand true 
 Take a ride in the Cadillac candy black with the seat back 
 Look at your hair blow in the wind look shawty don't you like that? Take a trip over seas ride clean on double D 
 Take a ride with Soulja Boy it'll be something you won't believe. 
 Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool things 
 I'm in a cool type mood I switch them 2 lanes 
 I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings 
 24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes 
 Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool things 
 I'm in a cool type mood I switch them 2 lanes 
 I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings 
 24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes 
 2nd verse 
 I step up on the scene wit my queen 
 Once again we looking clean 
 United States all over seas 
 Man it don't really matter to me 
 Already know what they trying to do get 
 Little money they loving you 
 But when you broke they ain't nothing to you 
 I mean but when you ain't got noting they ain't stunting you 
 Said it once said it twice 
 Anything you name the price 
 Hit the room cut out the lights 
 My macking game is locked tight 
 You know my name know my game know my slang so do your thing 
 All on ma neck is platinum chain o yeah mane I must get fame got damn Ain't got no time time waisted up in this place 
 Traveling across the globe we go swimming and roller skate 
 Anythang you wanna do just let me know 
 I'm right with you 
 It's parent life that choose a life like that life style to be exact
