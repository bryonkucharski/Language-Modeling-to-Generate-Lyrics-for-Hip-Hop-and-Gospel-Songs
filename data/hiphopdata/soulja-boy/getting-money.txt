Getting money (x8) 
 Jbar: 
 You get money damn right I get money yah (x4) 
 Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2) 
 Soulja Boy: 
 I'm reading all you broke ass niggas like a book 
 Jbar should be a boxer he so fire with dat hook 
 When it come to get money nigga I'm the one to talk to with 
 I am the shit dog and you are just dog shit 
 Cause pussy ass niggas keep texting my blackberry 
 They report him on the news they would say it's a blackberry 
 Kush mixed with purple 
 Don't you smell the odor 
 Fuck with me and get your head popped like a soda 
 When it comes to this rap shit, I am the best man 
 In high school I was a senior but I had to stay fresh man 
 They doubted me in person now they feeling like dummies 
 But I never gave a fuck 'cause I was always getting money (ooh) 
 Jbar: 
 You get money damn right I get money yah (x4) 
 Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2) 
 Soulja Boy: 
 My chain gold diamonds like a mutha fucking Oscar 
 Your chain looking faded like some mutha fucking copper 
 He's dry snitching talking to the damn coppers 
 Have his ass scared leaking red like a lobster 
 2 million dollars cash in front of me like I'm a mobster 
 Their comments keep me entertained so shout out to the bloggers 
 Soulja, spit that hot shit like Ether 
 He don't like me I don't like his ass either. 
 When the beef is on, we will pull a all nighter 
 Send his head shot like I ma damn sniper 
 My nigga can't follow bitch I can go further 
 Rest in peace to this track cause this shit had been murdered
