 Boss 
 Go step to my battle field. 
 Where my niggas come from. 
 All we know is kill bill. That's right. 
 Breakin neck. We ain't showing no respect. 
 Try me. Some niggas at no will. 
 Now watch me slow it down and then I take it in slow motion. 
 And then I speed it up. And take it fast like a nigga on a top speed coaster. 
 Now where my goons at? 
 Load 'em up. Take aim and we ready to attack. 
 And ain't no backin down. 
 We go pound for pound. Round for round. We knock 'em down. 
 Now if you think you got them hands. And nigga that's the plan. 
 Ima knock yo ass down like the black Jackie chan. 
 The squad ain't losing. These bi***s keep choosing. 
 And that's why (ay, ay). 
 Smurf

 Step into my fighting stand. And then I crank that rambo. 
 Anyone can come and get it. 
 It's a war that I declare. 
 If you want a double duo. Then I bring out yogi-bear. 
 Watch us hit you left and right. 
 Combos coming once or twice. 
 We becomin stupid fast. Have yo whole clique scarred for life. 
 Flawless victory on deck.

 Mike Dingo 
 Ay. They love to see me move. 
 Me and my whole crew. 
 'Cause every time I lean they watch spectators try to do it too. 
 So they keep on hesitating and hate, I put 'em in they place. 
 I call my boy Tookie then we whoop rico in his face. 
 No time to conversate. 
 This ain't the time or place. Watch me have to whoop a nigga ass 
 Like my name was Billy blanks. 
 This left a leave ya. 
 Then my dance, we crucial like brutality. 
 We leave y'all whole click stuck. Like we stole the d**n scene. 
 Trez 
 They said 'em twice. Another third times a charm. 
 But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain't no harm. 
 He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can't do it quite like me. 
 'Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly. 
 Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flo. 
 Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show. 
 First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head. 
 Roll yo arms and show yo swagg. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yeah).
