Yea 
 Shit 
 Damn 
 Step Brothers 
 They shooting up movies 
 They shooting up schools 
 Young black fools 
 Ain't the only ones that suit up with tools 
 Exercising my 2nd amendment and pleading the fifth 
 With A fifth 
 This my second this Remy 
 I drink, I don't sip 
 And the reason is this 
 It's fucked up out here 
 So we out here fucked up 
 If you make it out then you lucked up 
 Trying to save ourselves coming from 
 What we raised ourselves 
 Stuck between a rock and a hard place with the razor and scale 
 Turn wine back to grapes and it's raising hell 
 Breaking down bales 
 Just to make bail 
 Catching sells off a cell until you in a cell 
 I'm just trying to prevail 
 But only time will tell 
 Well, niggas telling over time 
 It ain't no telling 
 I ain't lying 
 Ain't trying to go out like my homies did 
 I keep that on me and I put that on my homies kid 
 Wonder if I gonna be missed 
 If I did a lonely bid 
 Got homies in the pen who only focus keeping a phone hid 
 I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight 
 Head-on collision hope the seat belt right though 
 Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight 
 Praying to god I get a leash on life 
 Leash on tight 
 Only right that we know 
 And please don't judge us for the path we chose 
 Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs 
 Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind 
 He got that strap in his bag 
 See he get bullied at school 
 Young nigga shot dead in his class 
 He put his school on the news 
 Now put yourself in his shoes 
 Walking away didn't help 
 He got no friends to defend him 
 He got to fend for his self 
 And he to skinny to fight 
 Running away just ain't cutting it 
 His daddy ain't home 
 His momma still struggling 
 She juggle three jobs 
 And get no help from the government 
 You don't know nothing about him 
 But you trying to sucker him 
 Heart of a giant 
 I'm sorry he will never back down 
 And they gonna keep pick on him till one day he blacks out 
 And reach in that book bag and he pull that mag out 
 Now he get the last laugh and you're just the class clown 
 Tool on deck 
 Yes I can't help that 
 When momma was stressing 
 I hit my block like a tailback 
 See we trying to make it don't got no suits 
 Just got cases 
 And I need more than this dope money to leave to my babies 
 I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight 
 Head-on collision hope seat belt right though 
 Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight 
 Praying to god I get a leash on life 
 Leash on tight 
 Only right we know 
 And please don't judge us for the path we chose 
 Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs 
 Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind
