Ah, cold turkey. 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Anything's better than going backwards 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits like 
 Women with hidden agendas and better bitches in general 
 I'm being specific, nothing subliminal 
 Shawty so fly, might jet her out on a red eye 
 I want that face to face, that eye to eye 
 Since they never lie 
 Normally I don't do this, but she sweeter than a chest pie 
 Still remember meeting her, leaving up out of Best Buy 
 I was in my lolo sleek, wishing I brought my best out 
 Big chain, sticking my chest out 
 As if I'm [?] to the [?] 
 Look at her now, batting her eyes 
 Ain't shy but she acting surprised 
 All the while, capitalizing in the back of her mind 
 Gold digging hoes digging holes in a nigga's soul 
 Pretending like I didn't notice getting old 
 On my Instagram straight flexing 
 Half nigga, you get the picture though 
 You met her off of twitter, how you expect her to play a different role? 
 Always dying for attention, If I ever would've mentioned 
 Addicted to how I'm getting it, might require an intervention 
 [?] You ain't got protection? 
 Ain't this the same bitch that screen-shot your messages? 
 Conscience intervened, got me second guessing 
 Searching for a hidden camera like a weapon 
 Look, look-check this out 
 Turn that phone off, ride with me to the store, let's go 
 I'mma be damned if I have a baby by this ho 
 (No, no, no) 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Ah, that's better than going backwards 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice 
 It's difficult starting over, but that's better than going backwards 
 Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits 
 Like niggas with hidden agendas and bitches with bad attitude [up] 
 I'm sorry, that was rude 
 Waking up disgusted with somebodies misses 
 Telling my gal more lies than a politician 
 Lucky her, she's stuck at home watching the chillen 
 While I'm in another city with a flock of bitches 
 She know I'mma dog, she's just being optimistic 
 But she was down when I didn't have a pot to piss in 
 I should marry her I know 
 Instead I'll be taking something home after the show 
 They screaming with their titties out, all in the front row 
 I'm trying to bob and weave, all the pussy that's being thrown 
 Sorry, it's probably too late for an apology 
 I'm not in getting head like I enrolled in cosmetology 
 I can't help the thought of it 
 Am I the kind of man I want my daughters with? 
 Knocking 30, still talking baller shit 
 I can't say I'm proud of it 
 One can only hope, that my daughters never pay for all the hearts they father broke 
 Notchhh 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Anything's better than going backwards 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice 
 It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards 
 Anything's better than going backwards 
 Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits 
 Cold Turkey
