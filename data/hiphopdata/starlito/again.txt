I just want, I want to let it build up till they kind of forget then I'm gonna come here rappin'. Fried turkey. Re-up and do it again, re-up and do it again, re-up and do it again. 
 I'm IND, nah, I don't depend on em. If you don't put in on it then you ain't my friend. I just be counting these ends, long while I'm dating my Benz. Couple of my exes have twins now but I wasn't in on it. Bitches be thinking we left, put down this drink is on ap. Don't need no niggas around, me and my bitch out of town. I left a sip at the house, it's about ten different flavors. Yeah, I been skipping them pounds. 
 Yeah, re-up and do it again. 
 Over and over again, it drove me psycho. That paper got recycled, now my neighbors all white folks. My granddaddy purpin, OG. I got an old soul. Snooze me that's a no go. I got a fo-fo. For my fo's I'm loco. Lead talk, tell me something I don't know. Glock got a red light but I don't. I'm on go, I'm on that dro. Fuck a piss test. Fuck a PO case, 'cause if I don't feed my artist they might try to fuck the CEO. You still ain't real, and I don't give a fuck what your CD sold. It's lead talk, going for the gusto. You see before your eyes know the skies. No mask, don't pose when it flash, cause that's your ass, bang. Shoot like my last name, trash bag gang. Got a bunch of niggas that don't rap, still doing the same thing. They camera shy, don't talk on phones. I love when it ring, I'm thuggin'. Entertainment, I'm in the game. 
 Yeah, just re-up and do it again. 
 Let me hear that.
