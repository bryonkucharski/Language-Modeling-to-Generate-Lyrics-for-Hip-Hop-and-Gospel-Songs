Being enlightened is no longer enough 
 You must apply 
 Being willin' is no longer acceptable 
 You must do, make it count 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this jail shit off me 
 He ain't gon' never sell, he gon' fail shit off me 
 I gotta shake this weak shit off me 
 Keep shit off me, leave it in the streets like bitch, get off me 
 1977, July 5th 
 Conceived immaculately was me, my mom's gift 
 Unwrapped right there in the room like Christmas 
 My mind has been designed to do light distance 
 Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts 
 You ain't hold back on yours, now that's my fault 
 Now picture me fallin' all the way to the bottom 
 And I'm layin' and callin' 
 Somebody come help me find my strength to stop drinkin' this poison 
 'Fore I drown my gift and yeah it's probably unhealthy 
 'Cause I went so hard and woke up sober 
 I lost my good friend and broke up soldiers 
 Loco, goin' hard as a locomotive 
 Self-loathin' like I ain't chosen 
 Chose to bless souls, get exposed 
 Just know that I ain't foldin', huh 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this jail shit off me 
 He ain't gon' never sell, he gon' fail shit off me 
 I gotta shake this weak shit off me 
 Keep shit off me, leave it in the streets like bitch, get off me 
 September 18th, 2-O-O-6 
 I roll up in the court thinkin', "This should go quick" 
 On some couple thousand dollar suit type shit 
 From behind thousand dollar Cartier scripts 
 I witness my world tumble down like bricks 
 Two words she slurred and it sounded like this 
 One year one year, travel through the room like moonlight 
 Through the darkness, ooh, it's heartless 
 How could I beat two felonies then 
 Turn around and lose like, lose like this 
 My lawyer sayin' stay calm, people sayin' pray for him 
 They lockin' my black ass up like Akon 
 My wife at the crib goin' crazy 
 Pregnant, yellin', "I ain't havin' no more babies" 
 People sayin' Preem ain't fuckin' with me no more 
 Niggaz in the pen' lookin' homo, no 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this jail shit off me 
 He ain't gon' never sell, he gon' fail shit off me 
 I gotta shake this weak shit off me 
 Keep shit off me, leave it in the streets like bitch, get off me 
 Fresh outta jail feelin' like Christopher Walken 
 The king of my city, swingin' my dick as I'm walkin' 
 Up to the 7-50, I open the door 
 My cousin like several bitches make up the decor 
 I look in, he got a company porns 
 I tell him, "Nah I'm good, I woulda chubbed her before" 
 I'm a new man but I could fuck with a whore 
 Nigga my dick's so hard it's probably touchin' the floor 
 Ridin' round in the back of a black luxury toy 
 Gettin' sucked, like niggaz cannot fuck with me boy 
 When I look in the mirror all I see is the real 
 You niggaz shouldn't be here, R.I.P. if you will 
 I'm the moment of truth 
 I'm the only significant thing roamin' the scene 
 Soon as I go in the booth 
 I'ma do it this time, I'm feelin' really defined 
 Unsigned to signed, nigga the city is mines 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this, na, na, na 
 I gotta shake this jail shit off me 
 He ain't gon' never sell, he gon' fail shit off me 
 I gotta shake this weak shit off me 
 Keep shit off me, leave it in the streets like bitch, get off me 
 Bitch get off me, yeah, get off me 
 Bitch get off me, now do that make me a liar? 
 Get off me, get off me, get off me
