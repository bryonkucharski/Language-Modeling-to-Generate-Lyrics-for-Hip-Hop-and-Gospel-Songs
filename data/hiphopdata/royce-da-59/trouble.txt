(Royce Da 5'9") 
 Uh, yeah 
 Royce 5-9, my nigga Bow Tie 
 My nigga Cee, Six July 
 Gangsta, what, gangsta, what, uh 
 Gangsta, niggaz is gangsta 
 Yo, I'm out here all day 
 From when you hear the sounds of the car skidding 
 Then start dickin, gangsta from start to the finish 
 What's up - never socialable, nigga we too disposable 
 If I get close to you it's probably to dispose of you quicker 
 Go 'head, try something live or die by these numbers 
 I'd rather live paralyzed than to die running, you feel it 
 Stay out his path, he's chaotic and mad 
 Pull a K out and blast, and treat every day like his last 
 I'm just a street nigga rhyming some words 
 Dabble in the finest of furs, cowboy minus the spurs and saddle 
 Prefer for battle; most deserved 
 In highest level in cowboy status is not from herdin cattle 
 One strange guy, I'm ? nuttin like you mayn 
 Guns all look the same to the un-trained eye 
 Easy to find, tell me how a gorilla can hide 
 The realest nigga breathin, ain't no nigga realer alive 
 (Chorus 2X: Royce) 
 Why'all niggaz in trouble (in trouble) 
 Why'all niggaz in trouble (in trouble). 
 Why'all niggaz in trouble (in trouble) 
 Why'all niggaz in trouble, you don't want this 
 (Bow Tie) 
 It's the black Elmer Fudd, fuck a mansion and a yacht 
 I got a project buildin, weed runnin' on the block (c'mon) 
 A sweet tooth for chronic, shit got me speakin' in ebonics 
 Killer cracker, respect me for my talent 
 Sniff 'em out like a bloodhound 
 Like they bag mills out in Vegas on the Greyhound 
 I never plead guilty, come to court filthy 
 Lawyer drunk off Henny, parole violators with me 
 And still I walk 'cause it's real 
 Take they ass to trial then they lose a quarter mil', now that's a deal 
 Filthy rich at his best 
 Love hell I write, with a 7 on my chest 
 I come, real street knowledge, boulevard trade school 
 Paid dues, cause niggaz know I honor the rules 
 Left no clues, X found, case is closed 
 While you go against the grain, with a plane of fo's 
 Take that slang to go, with the rubber handle steel 
 Spit dumb-dums at labels, with a 50-50 deal 
 Explode to your guts, that part left hollow 
 Show the world your nuts, I'm the hoodlum role model 
 To all the competition that'll follow 
 Just remember damage to the 99th power 
 No one knows the hour, that the Bow will strike 
 Took the sword from Hitler, that they stuck in Christ 
 Now who's nice? ... Now who's nice? 
 (Cee) 
 Yo, you see the press is too hot (uh-huh) when you rush my flows 
 I got, three for twenty-five, rhymes flip like blows 
 What you never heard this voice, it's big Cee from the state 
 (Where you from nigga?) Where we pimp hustle hard, bang it out for the weight 
 Eyes wide, cause me and my niggaz organize crime 
 You either get it in the streets, or runnin' from the jail lines 
 My game's at command, I show the world my status 
 It's filthy to the death blastin black automatics 
 You niggaz talk pain, he will catch these shells 
 Twenty-three hours on lockdown, one out your cell 
 I know it sounds sick, when you deal in this form 
 My city, the home where the killers is born 
 Close capture, East and West, now that you have to 
 Leave a little room for this Midwest rapture 
 And there's no endin, to the words I spit 
 I sacrifice my soul for this filthy rich shit (gangsta shit) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Why'all niggaz know it's trouble, why'knamsayin? 
 I got my Detroit niggaz 
 I got my New York niggaz 
 I'm a Chi-Town nigga 
 And it's goin' down for the new millennium motherfuckers!
