(Intro skit for first 43 seconds) 
 (Royce Da 5'9"" + (Blade)) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 When the rubber band pops from the top of them stacks 
 Mami drop them tops 'fore them dollars go back 
 In my pocket or the trunk of the black Impala 
 Where the pump just sit for them punks who trip 
 But besides that, life's good - yeah 
 This my nigga Blade right here (you could call me Icewood) 
 (Ingrid Smalls + (Royce)) 
 Icewood? (Icewood) I could 
 Go home witchu baby if the pipe good 
 (Royce Da 5'9"") 
 We get a whole lot of scrilla, fo'-fives is wit us 
 Whole flight can fill us, Globetrotter nigga 
 When you see a plus sign in front of like twelve numbers 
 On your cell that's me callin to tell you 
 That I ain't at home (yeah) 
 I'm witnessin the midnight sun in Finland with the big row bone 
 With six different funds 
 Coronas, pesos, zeros, the list goes on 
 We send henchmen to wet ya 
 In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us 
 Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off Sheed (yeah) 
 Yellin' pass the ball to Rip and Billups, mami 
 (Chorus: Jay Black) 
 If you got love for me, then do your little dance for me 
 Turn that ass around, (turn around) and keep doin' what you dooooo 
 If you got a thang for me, then do your thang for me 
 Turn that ass around, (turn around) 'cause you've got it comin' 
 (Blade Icewood + (Ingrid)) 
 Turn that ass 'round, ma you know I'm a clown 
 Throw a little money 'round, do my dance to the sounds 
 Worth a whole lotta cash, so you know I got the pound on me 
 Yeah dance for my homie (damn what's the nigga name?) 
 Five-Nine (Five-Nine) 
 (Royce Da 5'9"") 
 Pimp game got it goin' from the first line 
 Chain plenty hang time, yeah 
 (Blade Icewood) 
 G-4 plane flyin, '05 Range drivin' 
 If the deal ain't least ten mil' I ain't signin 
 Heard she can make it do the "Nolia Clap" 
 It's Mr. Blade Icewood the new king of rap 
 I got these shots for you haters (c'mon) 
 Tell the waiters bring the shots, use the liquor to motivate her 
 To hop up in the whip, before she leave the lot 
 Got my dick between her lips; hand between her hips 
 On some freaky shit, yeah ain't know I did it like that 
 She thought it was all rap till she screamin on her back 
 Playa, we send henchmen to wet ya 
 In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us 
 Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off Sheed (yeah) 
 Yellin' pass the ball to Rip and Billups, mami 
 (Royce Da 5'9"") 
 Yeah, we hit makers with acres 
 We hit Vegas with chips major, we can't just 
 Ball like the usual team, we stay whylin 
 Up the challenge, fuck it, tear up the palace 
 Fuck with, nothin' but them trucks with, halogen lights 
 Did bad in his life, them cuts and calluses 
 In the G-4, in a suit, eatin souffl© 
 In the seat big get your coupe, nigga go play 
 (Blade Icewood) 
 Hey come over here! 
 Well you can have it your way, blow cabbage all day 
 Ice, everywhere, bought it from all yay 
 This ain't no spaceship, gave the Rover a facelift 
 Lift the fifth to my lips while she movin her hips 
 Yeah - side to side, I decide 
 When the time is right for us to slide 
 We ain't movin at the mansion yet, the panty's wet 
 That's how you feel off a pill, why you panickin? 
 Go away!
