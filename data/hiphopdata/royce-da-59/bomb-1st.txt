 But death is, so somebody gon' get it 
 Nigga get in ya car, if he pissin' you off 
 Get him, I don't wanna picture you pausin' 'cause 
 With you from the peddle to the floor 
 From the shovel to the fo' fo', the devil only showed up for show 
 Turn this up, turn off your phone 
 And leave the, "You wanna talk peace?" at home 
 Faces corps or face them in court 
 If you don't face 'em you gon' pay, yo safety is short 
 I got a babe to work for the courts 
 I'ma license plate number away from the front of your porch 
 Or from the side of your house, the product of a ride or die is about 
 I'm the opposite of a lot of mouth 
 It's strange y'all repent after saying my name 
 I'm about to change it like Prince call me 
 The skit master, beef with the street trash 
 The leafs, the trees, grass at ya pad, he's mastered 
 Squeeze faster, instead of beatin' his ass 
 Just let 'em have it and you can be the last one standin'

 At night or in broad day, drive by, sittin' in the bushes all day 
 However you hunt, go get 'em 
 The K, the AR, the pump, the hand gun 
 Get it done however you want, go get 'em 
 Park in the front, get out, walk and then dump 
 Pull off slow leaving no tire marks in the front, go get 'em 
 The go-rilla, know he gon' leave footprints 
 So he gets his shoes the size a soul bigger 
 I learned niggaz will turn on you young 
 Just as the gun misses it hits shit, hence the term killa 
 Stop lights are not at night, it's where you get chopped up 
 If you stop, nigga maybe the cops might 
 Surroad through and fast forward his life 
 Blow noodles on his dash board nigga, no excuses 
 I seen plenty survive, weighing a hundred and eighty five 
 In a land where the skinny niggaz die, you gotta
