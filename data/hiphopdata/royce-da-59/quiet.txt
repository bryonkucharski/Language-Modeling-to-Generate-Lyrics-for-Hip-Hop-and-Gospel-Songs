(Mr. Porter) 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh, oh yeah 
 (Mr. Porter) 
 See I done said so much (so much) 
 I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say 
 I done cried so much (so much) 
 I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away 
 Quiet 
 (Royce Da 5'9" & Mr. Porter) 
 That's how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet) 
 Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet) 
 That's how it be coming up on my block (quiet) 
 Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet) 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Hold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut 
 Them street sweepers will come through and clean your house up 
 Us Detroit niggas call that yellow-taping the scene 
 My south niggas call it chalked up, you know 
 We put money on it when it's real, they call me Mr. Fifty a head 
 I'm sending ten niggas to kill ya at ten until 
 Every man got an expiration date and a price 
 All my revolvers got the spinnin' wheel 
 I make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White 
 Them racketeering charges startin' to look like a tennis deal 
 I caught it, garden in my backyard guarding the weed and lookin' like some spinnish spiel, but still I'm dealin' raw 
 From selling to buying weed, actually I'm stealin' all 
 I'm the last of a dying breed that I'm out here killing off 
 Four of my closest friends don't know their papas so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin' off 
 Get money 
 (Mr. Porter)

 (Tiara) 
 Shhh, I should have been born deaf mute 
 Talkin' get you stripped naked 
 Shootin' at your feet, dancin', till Chippendales at your rescue 
 If there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you 
 Look, time is money, I'm on EST 
 Keep playin', light up your block like Christmas E-v-e 
 I'm the new edition of poison: BBD 
 For that bread my niggas will stamp you: EBT 
 I let a hot line sting 'em, you and the cops while I'm singin' 
 Ever since you left the city, now they hotline's blingin', hmm 
 Seen a paddy wagon cruisin' and I'm deducin' 
 That they are only movin' cause all the rumors that you in 
 If I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losing is 
 Because of the illusion, you are not in collusion 
 With the boys that's wearin' blue and it's causing all this confusion 
 And they wouldn't even know, but y'all tellin' what niggas doin' 
 (Mr. Porter) 
 See I done said so much (so much)

 I'm going on an AK-a-thon 
 Throw a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon 
 Double parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine 
 I ain't in the zone, I'm in the motherfuckin' lay-up line 
 Speaking of lay ups, we do homi's based on how we doin' 
 Last lay up line I was in was a body viewin' 
 I'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills, good 'erbals 
 First meal was milk, I milk these niggas for my first meal 
 Full circle, off of just talking I can tell types 
 But I still give that bitch my whip test 
 If she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe 
 Playin' that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ 
 I'm standing over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness 
 Man a cure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right 
 Only hand-me-down I had was inherited head lice 
 But nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice 
 E'ery day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice 
 Rest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right 
 Ask me to spell die, I'mma accidentally spell dice 
 I can shelve a label with my shelf life 
 I'm a rider, but still I steal bikes 
 Out of the field, terrorizing reptiles and field mice 
 I'm cut like I'm touched, a blind man with braille spikes 
 I'm deep, I could break up a motherfuckin' whale fight 
 (Mr. Porter)
