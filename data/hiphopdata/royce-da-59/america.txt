(A synth pad with heavy effects is heard, then a muffled drum beat that sounds like a live drummer begins. The noise and shouts of a military group are heard as they engage in what sounds like an offensive attack.) 
 I said America the beautiful 
 Land of free, home of brave 
 Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man 
 When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole 
 And soon as you die then here goes this 
 Oh, now he heroic 
 Oh, now he the coldest 
 Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it" 
 Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave 
 You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave 
 What the fuck is arrogant? 
 That's the shit they injecting into us Americans 
 How 'bout I think I was put here to push European whips 
 And so what if you don't like it, I thought you'd be inspired 
 By the way I whip it, way I whip it 
 Way I whip it, way I whip it 
 I whip it 
 Right past the pretenders, the men with no passion 
 Who think it's possible to be past your potential like life has just ended 
 The spirit broken and so the wife and kids are born into only knowing the White Castle menu 
 While the richest born into white castles 
 Attending Bar Mitzvahs, the future of us niggas is in syringes 
 We meant for the NFL, injure the NBA 
 Anyway, I take popping shots at niggas over receiving posthumous props from niggas any day 
 Maybe y'all just scared, lost in everybody saying not to floss so you go watch the Walking Dead 
 Yeah you in the 
 America the beautiful 
 Land of free, home of brave 
 Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man 
 When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole 
 And soon as you die then here goes this 
 Oh, now he heroic 
 Oh, now he the coldest 
 Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it" 
 Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave 
 You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave 
 What the fuck does humble mean? 
 Call me good at something I'll say I'm good at a bunch of things 
 I feel my whole life my fire should be lit 
 I feel my wife's pussy wet each time she sees my dick she get excited by the way I whip it, way I whip it, way I whip it 
 She likes the way I whip it 
 I whip it 
 Man look here, I've been anti-corporate since daddy told me 
 That they force me here against my will 
 Without no horses or some land 
 Of course they saying I'm supposed to just forget they throw the scrap at those that can distract with those endorsements 
 Closing doors and all of those who buy the clothes and shoes 
 And booze and albums 
 Hope you not expecting treatment by the book 
 From he who wants you to forget that you was brought over here by the boat 
 I don't know why niggas say they money funny when it's low 
 'Cause when you broke it's not a joke 
 Talk that we can't take shit with us when we die shit 
 You don't leave behind shit cause you died without shit 
 In 
 America the beautiful 
 Land of free, home of brave 
 Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man 
 When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole 
 And soon as you die then here goes this 
 Oh, now he heroic 
 Oh, now he the coldest 
 Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it" 
 Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave 
 You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave 
 If he's hot, expose him, then 
 Roll on him, we can't roll on him 
 Roll on his closest kin 
 That kind of behavior, I call that "Niggerdom, Niggerdom" 
 Mentally enslave them, taze them, then they go crazy 
 Uh, here they come 
 Everybody think a revolution coming 
 Wanna be involved in the riot 
 Everybody arguing out here, this how I feel: 
 "What in the Jiminy cracker corner fuck are we bickering for?" 
 This shit here is bigger than war 
 They sticking and sicken the shit in the food that the nigga consume so it's hidden in stores 
 Some shit that can kill your fertility, damage your thinking 
 Limit your abilities, think about that now 
 The fact that y'all living is crazy cause alcoholism got black people tapping out quicker than Savion Glover 
 And we ain't no Avión lovers 
 We dying each time that the Hennessy pours 
 Our plugs are the mothers on the other side of our umbilical cords 
 Can I talk my shit? Y'all niggas confidence dropping 
 Y'all letting people control y'all flow who don't know how y'all clocks tick 
 I'm disgusted 
 Find the money if the money don't fit 
 Do like me on this and find a different pocket 
 Only in America 
 Oh damn, I guess you is kinda talented 
 Make sure you don't forget where you came from, boy 
 Always stay humble 
 Now why don't you do that thing again with your tongue 
 You know that one thing when you go and whip it... 
 (*Whip cracking sound*)
