(Intro: Crooked I) 
 Okay! 
 What we have here? 
 It's what the game been talkin'... 
 SLAUGHTERHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUSE! {BRING IT BACK!} [scratches?] 
 Okay! 
 What we have here? 
 It's what the game been talkin'... 
 SLAUGHTERHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUSE! {Whoooooooooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!} 
 Okay! [shot] 
 Crooked I: 
 This is true! 
 Militant mind state and the villains concealing the 9 wait. - It's a zoo! [gunshot] 
 I'm chilling with primates, I'm a fool! 
 You feeling it? I ain't play gorilla I'm a real as the crime rate. [scream] 
 It's so cool! - My right jabs on the right track 
 It'll slide you sideways go get your ice pack. [shot] 
 That's what the fights bought, big, punch your lights out 
 Go pay your utility bill get your sight back. (huh?) 
 All I got is a bunch of weaponry everywhere 
 When I was a kid I used to machete my teddy bear. 
 Friday the 13th? - Nah, nigga was never scared 
 Sleeping on Elm's Street if somebody tell me Freddy there. [Vincent Price laughs] (yeah!) 
 See I'm a whole 'nother animal! 
 With a mechanical trap jaw - highly flammable [dogs growing] 
 Soon as this cannibal track yawn 
 I split your cantaloupe, Hannibal Lechter with a hacksaw. - I rap raw! [scream] 
 Go in the zone till I'm outside of my body 
 Your body get outlined in white powder when bullets [gunshot] come outside of the shotty. (ha!) 
 Try to hide in your hotel I'll Al-Qauda 
 Your lobby then I'll smile at your hotty. [Tarzan shouts] ([EM:] Whoo!) 
 Put a ride on my side like Clyde riding with Bonnie 
 Check out the way I pimp mommy! 
 After my snake charm her! 
 She get wet now I'm folding paper (paper!) that's slimy tsunami and origami. (yeah!) 
 Yes! - The best ever! 
 I'm hot as West weather when you dressed in your sweater vest and you best leather. 
 I pull buttons and press levers 
 I'm backwards as a dyslexd letter, jet setter - etcetera! [gunshot] 
 Catch you boy on planet COB, 
 Go fuck yourself give your hand a job! 
 Like Nikel 9's brother - the kids Vishis 
 I own half a beauty salon so you know I'm with splitting the wig business. {Whooooooooooooooooooooo} 
 Royce Da 5'9": 
 I got a big dick, bitch! {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!} 
 What? - That ain't no punchline, I just a got big dick, bitch! (whooo!) 
 'Bout big business, 
 Slaughterhouse! - You and your clique gettin' with this. [gunshot] 
 Y'all at the movies wearing blindfolds 
 Get, it? - That means you ain't seeing the big picture 
 I find irony in being the headed rapper decapitating 
 I'll get Rihanna on a track and won't even rap on it. 
 Just let her moan to the song whilst I'm masturbating 
 You the best rapper? Homie congratulations! [scream] 
 I'd rather be known for felonious ratchet waving. 
 (Pop, pop, pop, pop!) You deep, we deeper 
 But we married to these streets but - we don't jump brooms we just carry street sweepers! 
 Hell yeah! Detroit city? I'm felt there! 
 Leave a brain elsewhere! - It's the name on the card to my health care. 
 I'm hard! - You facades 
 Piss me off! - I put your thoughts on your broad. [scream] 
 You fucking screamer - later with your tough demeanour 
 Ya fruit! - I V-8 juice your fucking team up! 
 Give me 50 feet! (come on!) 
 Why you acting? All brand new 50's teeth! 
 Got the bullets looping I pull it the clip repeats - WITHOUT THE DJ! 
 I got more gunshots in the Glock - than Whoo Kid got [gunshot] in that instant replay. 
 Ooh, you thought that was a diss to Fif'? Than {Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo} 
 You stupider than Muslims looking for gifts on Christmas. {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!} 
 Clip-out! - 'Bout to stick my dick in, the hole 
 In the handle, how you gon' walk [gunshot] a mile in my shoes? (whooo!) 
 I'm walking on water and Moses and over sandals, 
 Giving boxers is the opposite of going commando! [Tarzan shouts] 
 That's right; I put a bunch of boxers on your ass, boy! 
 I'm fly! - ? is my handle! 
 I'm from the metropolitan [blast] rock bottom, if I spot 'em, I got 'em! 
 She wanted to swallow when I shot it - but that's not my problem. 
 She's your wife she just my concubine'n 
 She like to holla Ryan whilst I'm behind it like she my momma mind it. [scream] 
 Willing to get more physical than the lacrosse team 
 Blunt so big look like we just rolled up the swamp thing! ([EM:] Whoo Whoo!) 
 I'm high feeling like I should be higher, 
 I ride like Michael Myers, wire ride like a bike with no tires! ([EM:] Whoo! WHATTA FUCK?!) 
 No case to fight with no priors 
 Say good night! - Nickel 9 and Crooked I's on fire... 
 (Outro: Royce Da 5'9") 
 That's right! 
 Whattup B-Luv? [beat stops] [gunshot] [rewind]
