(Lincoln) 
 Baby! Baby! 
 Damn, slow down a little bit 
 I just wanna get to know you baby 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 I don't wanna bite you, it's all chicken except for the bone 
 Shit, I'm just 
 Hey, I'm getting a little money out here 
 I just wanna spread the wealth 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 I got, I got money, I got credit cards, I got PayPal cards 
 What ever you want to do, we could do EBT 
 You need groceries? 
 Shit baby, what you looking at? 
 What the fuck you see over there? 
 A Unicorn? 
 Niggas sweat bitches 
 While bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats 
 If you don't get no respect 
 It really don't matter, you could be Louis Vuitton'd up 
 You might as well have on Von Dutch and Tommy Hilfiger with a debt 
 I don't do dirt, I don't call scenes 
 I send niggas through to leave a mess 
 I'm a real nigga in the flesh 
 I will find a bitch in distress 
 I will make her feel so alive 
 Then beat her with the dick to death 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 If shit ain't right between us 
 We will leave a nigga left 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 I despise rapping niggas 
 Y'all niggas fly private, I come sky jack you niggas 
 You disrespect me, I'll get on board with three Ks out 
 And go to your PJ's pilot 
 Tell him I need those jet's keys like I'm DJ Khaled 
 Seems like every artist out there snorting coke and smoking base 
 I just opened up the briefcase and dumped out the contents 
 To close up an open case 
 If my soul shall rise then I'ma lift the hood up like Tray Martin 
 I'm a clapper, they targets 
 They trappers, I'm a convict slash escape artist 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 Finding bitches in distress 
 Make 'em feel so alive 
 Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 If shit ain't right between us 
 We will leave a nigga left 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 I'm p-o-p, you d-u-d 
 You bark up this tree, I'll make you turn over three new leafs 
 You live right by the code or get left like three two three 
 I'm A Tribe Called Quest, I'm the new G 
 Out here going dumber than Tweedledee 
 All these youngins wanna redo me, like these movies 
 'Cause I'm so Pablo Escobar-esque 
 Elephant in the room, never out my element 
 Oh, always on my P's and Q's like RSTUV, ah! 
 Never tell your intel to a gent who's intelligent 
 'Cause he'll tell a friend who then shall attempt 
 To turn bullets into shells and spin, and turn humans into skeletons, grrah 
 I'm a real nigga in the flesh 
 Finding bitches in distress 
 Make 'em feel so alive 
 Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes 
 Real nigga in the flesh 
 If shit ain't right between us 
 We will leave a nigga left 
 Real nigga in the flesh, yes 
 I'm breaking now 'cause I'm dating goddesses 
 The haters tried but couldn't feed me salt 
 'Cause I seasoned all them, now I'm raking dollars in 
 Say goodbye, I'm finna take you outta here 
 You can't deny it, I'm the H in igher 
 Here the four door Porsche or whatever vehicle 
 A nigga like Lincoln couldn't survive without made it out and over four scores and seven years ago 
 I know time flies by, yours tick-tick-tick 
 Mines went-went-went-went like eleven layers ago 
 My flow so heaven sent 
 When I go to heaven, I'ma go "Heaven here you go" 
 I'ma go tell God, "I know I promised that I'd never steal your flow," I lied 
 Ain't nothing like side pussy on my dick 
 Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik 
 Bunch of girls wanna have a bunch of relations 
 Even when a nigga wanna be they friend 
 I learned that faithful women need they men 
 They don't really wanna leave they men 
 They just don't wanna get a phone call 
 From another chick saying where he done been 
 If your bitch 'bout to leave better ask yourself questions 
 Like "fight for her? Why?" 
 You better step up and fight for her like you're fighting for Hawaii 
 Or you motherfucking B.J Penn 
 I'm a real nigga in the flesh 
 My wife almost left me but she ain't do it 
 I don't like the way "ex-wife" sound, that don't got a ring to it
