(Chorus - Royce Da 5'9") 
 (R) You niggaz can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y) 
 I'm spillin these cold raps, 'cause I am a soldier (C) 
 You shoulda been told that (E) 'cause I am a throwback 
 I'm spillin these cold raps, you feelin' the soldier 
 You niggaz could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5) 
 {*Whoever wanna get it, then you can come and get it*} 
 I'm spillin these cold raps (9) you feelin' the soldier 
 {*'Cause I'ma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it*} 
 Cause you niggaz could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback 
 {*Now if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it*} 
 I'm spillin these cold raps, I am a soldier (yeah) I... begone 
 (Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9") 
 Raps wolf is BACK, to attack crooks is BACK 
 The slap snares, and CLAP at the tracks foot (yeah) 
 I'm too vicious for him, too vicious for you 
 And my kitchen is huge, we do dishes wit dudes 
 Coldest flow of the summer, I see 'em come and they GO 
 See 'em fumble the flow, there's more goers then comers 
 Put the piece to ya dome, do you at peace wit the chrome 
 Peel ya cap, then eat you, and pick my teeth wit ya bones 
 I'm from the city of GATORS, haters I dealt wit them dudes 
 If you don't like me, then likely I'll make a belt wit ya shoes 
 Put a hole in ya soul, it trickles badder than good 
 Flow is sold, before any nickel bag on your hood 
 I'm not a hip hop nigga, don't confuse me wit them 
 Truest at the beginnin, and truer when it's do to your end 
 I'm just sellin my game, for cheddar forever 
 My intelligent brain, is clever when spellin my name, like 
 (Verse 2 - Royce Da 5'9") 
 I'm back to call the advantage, have you and on bananas 
 And hands rep, rap +Grand Theft Auto+ mechanic 
 I'm bout to tighten my plugs, bout to be fightin in clubs 
 Ya blood might give me love, and likely highten my buzz 
 Ya type is simply a bitch, and fightin wit me's a risk 
 I might empty my clip, if the hype will get me my niche 
 I'm out in front of ya, guns out 
 Bout to knock ya fronts out, boxin about to drop without Columbia 
 I spit this venom myself, my independence is felt 
 Finish wit Slim and his help, long as he winnin' I'm good 
 Long as I'm known as one of the most vicious 
 MC's spittin' from the "D", low and behold and mitten 
 This is how I rose you bitches, Rock City chosen niggaz 
 We stole this, on our road to riches 
 I'll show you the golden picture, glow, lock 
 Product is fears, I'm soda pop, like Hova, Pac, and Big 
 (Verse 3 - Royce Da 5'9") 
 I go beyond bootlegers, they slow me down, but HEY 
 I'm holdin' my ground, long as the stolen sound should PLAY 
 5'9" is a winner, I speak to keep the progression 
 My views take you to school, my piece'll teach you a lesson 
 Never been deep in the streets, I can't be somethin' I'm not 
 Test me and get to know me, I'll put you inside of a box 
 Chalked and signin off and, put ya hands on me now 
 Later they lay on ya chest, crossed inside a coffin 
 The .30 Caliber SHOT, who wanna take home 
 What'll give you wounds, you goons couldn't put a steak on 
 All them hoe ass niggaz could DO, is cry wit the children 
 And PRAY, if I was a civilian for a day 
 I'd take a glance at my daddy - another me 
 Raise my hand on the stand like Shaggy - "It wasn't me" (yeah) 
 I will melt you, smell the aroma of a coma 
 I'm comin' to get you, I will help you SPELL! 
 (Outro - Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yeah it's on, my name is Royce 5'9" 
 My nigga Ty Fyffe, we gone (echoes)
