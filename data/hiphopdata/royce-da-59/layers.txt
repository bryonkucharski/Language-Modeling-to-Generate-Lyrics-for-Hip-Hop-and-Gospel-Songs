Look at you, no pleasure in creative thinking, because you don't think creatively anymore. The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do 
 (Pusha T) 
 Tug of war and my mind's like a clash of the titans 
 Thoughts contrast so it's layers to my writin' 
 God fearin', but I'm Guy Fisher 
 Yeah, God hearin', but I'm gone fishin' 
 I'm an artist, drug dealer, foreign car keys 
 Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese 
 Birds in the trunk so these keys, now they homin' 
 Letters and numbers on the Coupe like it's Roman 
 Woo, all black like the omen 
 Kim said it, yup, BIG wrote it 
 So I'm feeling like a Greek God when I quote it 
 Light years ahead, but I was caught up in the moment 
 Moment of clarity, moment of silence 
 Burner on my waist, yet I'm saying stop the violence 
 Sitting on that white horse, look at prince valiant 
 Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents 
 I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars 
 Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows 
 Poking at my problems, I know how to solve 'em 
 With a ski mask, automatic or revolver 
 A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master. Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Them niggas wanna see me runnin', they know I won't 
 They say misery loves company, no, I don't 
 Ain't got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks 
 All I got time to do is go back in time and pose with the Unabomber 
 Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it 
 I live by a code of demonic, Illuminati, Obama, Hovanomics 
 Hold up, hurdles in life, I hop in a Turbo and roll around 'em 
 I'm Doug E. Fresh in the flesh, I beat box 
 I boo-boo-du-du between the sheets to seek the G-Spot 
 I'm in bed with three naked ladies holding hands 
 I'm in bed with three major labels 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout wearing clothing brands 
 Underground locomotive man 
 Putting on a global show that no promoter can 
 I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons 
 In my world mistakes turns to blessings 
 The hate turned to destiny 
 I'm saying Lord Jesus while the Lord's most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me 
 I got your baby momma down on all fours 
 When drama comin', I'm all for it 
 If it ain't about the money please let this be your last question 
 You players can jump if you want, but you half-stepping like Paul George 
 I make the yay invisible in like a day or two 
 That's how the players do, my nigga, there's layers to it 
 First in science, first in technology, wealthiest country on Earth, most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education. So you have all been taken and you don't even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Paranoid of poverty, hustle was the philosophy 
 I seen a kilo, I swear it became a part of me 
 Lie, cheat and steal, I had it mastered by my teens 
 Started hands on, a nigga still pulling strings 
 Hotel suites, straight selling nigga's dreams 
 Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring 
 Was a water boy, but balling always in my genes 
 Season ticket holder, nigga sitting with the team 
 Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice 
 So suspicious of the cars, tuitions for the schools 
 Labeled a mastermind, I positioned every move 
 Shots fired, now the deposition from the crew 
 Smooth operation, but the money came in knots 
 Forty million there, I dare you tell me what I'm not 
 I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more 
 Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow
