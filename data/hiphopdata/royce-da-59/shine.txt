Just shine your light on the world 
 So shine your light on the world 
 No matter anywhere you go, keep 
 Shining your light on the world 
 Don't let the money make you thirsty 
 Don't even let it be your goal 
 Just let it come and keep on working 
 And shine your light on them hoes 
 'Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here 
 I'd rather die than live a life of fear 
 I know I got to be down here 
 To shine my light on them hoes 
 Hardest nigga out here 
 I'd rather starve than live a life of fear 
 I feel like God sent me down here 
 To shine my light on them hoes 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Lost in the world when me and my girlfriend meet, bless you 
 You know they say "if you fucked her and she didn't cum 
 And you came, then she fucked you" 
 We squeeze first, nigga these ain't rebuttals 
 These street sweepers, we dump till he jump brooms 
 Like these nuptials, in the D where dreams come true 
 This is the the story of a man who's trying to break his doubts 
 Down like his cases count 
 Obsessive compulsive counting dough 
 Making sure all the numbers on the inside 
 And all the faces out 
 Lawyers on retainers like they braces out 
 Say my name wrong, I make you taste your mouth 
 Money come, money go 
 Get it but don't splurge it 
 Your boy's greed and war's needs 
 Got their own purpose 
 There's more than four speeds on that Porsche Turbo 
 It's sitting on four G's like my phone service 
 I'm out here trapping, but this here's sincere rapping 
 Dear assassin, you can't kill a signed and sealed classic 
 Cause L's and bill blasts, snake skin troops 
 Reptile enemies X'd out is what make men true 
 I'm blacking just like Jamaicans do 
 I'm running long side your coupe 
 Tapping guns upon your Wrathe window 
 Like Ox in Belly, got more Glocks and cellies 
 Than New Yorks got blocks and delis 
 Cops and boxes of pirellis, their doors' ajar 
 Exposing my maserati's guts 
 And that's what got you jelly 
 The car I'm driving got a pot belly 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 I'm out here trapping 
 With this here sincere rapping 
 I've been shooting straight 
 Since two inch tape 
 This is for real classic 
 And getting money was never part of my goals 
 It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes 
 I've been out here trapping 
 With this here sincere rap 
 For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic 
 I get money, get money money dough 
 All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Hip-hop is my house; watch these philosophies win 
 Around artists I stand out like I locked my keys in 
 I forgot my goal at twenty-three was make a classic 
 Walk away like Tiger with my nine iron then take the master's 
 They say that you get what you ask for 
 Well, I asked to be left alone with my pen, pad and passport 
 This ain't no rags to rich brag shit 
 In fact, it's more close to being a rich to rags story 
 The fabric I'm cut from's the most genuine article mankind offers 
 I'm like an underground landmine talking 
 For Storch, Hammer and Antoine Walker 
 And your boy's a tampon 
 In every store I'm anti-corporate 
 Highest exalted, call me commercial? I'm highly insulted 
 This is Royce da 5'9", mind body and soul shit 
 All I have in this fucking globe is my shotty and flow 
 I'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk 
 Than let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 I'm out here trapping 
 With this here sincere rapping 
 I've been shooting straight 
 Since two inch tape

 I've been out here trapping

 We move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming 
 I was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage 
 Y'all assembly line of rhymers really don't want it 
 I'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got y'all serial numbers 
 I'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles 
 Tell him he got the juice now 
 Call my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him 
 Perhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps 
 About a new him and Royce track 
 I'm feeling like D to the O to the C 
 When he got his voice back 
 Ha, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino 
 Rolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back 
 Streets waving to all my people 
 I'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor 
 This are what memories are made of 
 I remember each grudge, each favor 
 Each lie, each judge, each bailiff 
 Each job, cheap labor 
 Each neighbor, each caper 
 Each Mosque, each Church 
 Each pastor, pew, and casket 
 Each future bastard double dutching through the madness, singing: 
 Just shine your light on the world 
 So shine your light on the world 
 No matter anywhere you go, kid 
 Shining your light on the world 
 Don't let the money make you thirsty 
 Don't even let it be your goal 
 Just let it come and keep on working 
 And shine your light on the hoes 
 'Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here 
 I'd rather die than live a life of fear 
 I know I got to be down here 
 To shine my light on them hoes 
 Hardest nigga out here 
 I'd rather starve than live a life of fear 
 I feel like God sent me down here 
 To shine my light on them hoes
