(Hold up!) 
 Presenting to you, the President of the United States 
 The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart, Reagan is launched into the operating room, and tells his doctors, 'I hope you're all Republicans.' 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 I ain't claiming I'm street 
 I'm just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete 
 In the bubble-eyed ride all because I bubble like Don P 
 Right beside me's a dime piece, college girl looking 'bout as good as I sleep 
 That's 'cause I keep it low, the opposite of high key 
 Y'all niggas got the wrong idea 'bout what's really going on, out here 
 Y'all weird, I see, they told you, 'Keep your ears to the streets' 
 Y'all niggas laying down and y'all ears out here in these streets 
 I guess you took it literal 
 Guess the only code you live by's forget-it-code 
 Uh, if I should get my own guilty verdict 
 May the next man learn from it, then flourish 
 You could put it on the news, you could put my face on the front of a shirt, then the latest video, then blur it 
 Y'all niggas fucking with the next nigga, bitch 
 Mostly attracted to her 'cause she the next nigga bitch 
 One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas 
 Now he on the slayin' spree for Dilla niggas, I call it the nigga nitch 
 Life is set up for you to dig a ditch 
 God is looking down on all, being carried by the crisp pallbearers 
 Like, just ball, player 
 You ain't even gotta pull a trigger, you can still assist 
 Imma keep it real as this 
 Got to know when to row from the madness 
 Got to know when to give these niggas passes 
 Got to know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em 
 Got to know when to beats niggas asses 
 Got to know when the money ain't good money 
 Got to know when somebody ain't good for ya' 
 Got to know when to open and when to close 
 When being silent exposes, and when it's golden 
 Got to know all the got to knows 
 Got to know all the got to knows 
 God made us niggas, then made us all breakable 
 Then gave us all decision making that'll make or break a nigga 
 People tryna blaze with you, just so they can lace a nigga 
 All because of public sensationalism 
 With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to 
 When the place where the foundation of eating's 
 Higher population is based on popularity 
 Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom 
 All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact you're talking to an abomination 
 At the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong crime taking place 
 That'll put you away for a long grind, where it's locked 
 Where it's not safe unless you know them combinations 
 Yeah, it's just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother 
 We don't learn from each other, we learn to look the other 
 Way when one of us in trouble 
 That karma looking to catch you, it's patient 
 It'll wait till you think you would love to come get you 
 Cause it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered 
 Dearly beloved, you soul searching for nothing 
 Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with, historically 
 That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person 
 Who's living under the gun in this cold, cold world that we live in 
 That's under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants 
 More religion and more churches, doctors, more nurses 
 'Cause it's the American way to make anything that'll finish you or drop you, for purchase 
 Who said I couldn't buy my way into heaven? 
 All I need is a bottle, a couple dollars, a couple people that'll keep me company 
 And who love misery as much as me 
 You got to know your pedigree, got to be yourself at all times 
 Your true self at all times ain't gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be 
 A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride 
 Gotta know the alert signs, them butterflies as reliable as your first mind, genetically 
 Got to know when to row from the madness 
 Got to know when to give these niggas passes 
 Got to know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em 
 Got to know when to beats niggas asses 
 Got to know when the money ain't good 
 Got to know when somebody ain't good for ya' 
 Got to know when to open and when to close 
 When being silent exposes, and when it's golden 
 Got to know all I got to know 
 Got to know all I got to know
