 Porter, you a real nigga, man 
 It all started with a Starter coat 
 The starter pistol got us out the momma jokes 
 The house party finally started, now it's time to go 
 Get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap 
 I'm stealing cars, it wasn't logical 
 But on the bright side, they taught us how to drive 'em doe 
 We used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers 
 So I'm kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns, ho 
 But the Billboard list was kinda comical 
 How the fuck was it designed and chronicled 
 I can see it now for sho' 
 Bunch of blasés from a buncha artists with a timeless flow 
 Gettin' trampled over on a 20 year old blogger flow 
 If 'Pac ain't on your list then you ain't fuckin' logical 
 I'm talkin' up the shit, not no fuckin' 5 or 4 
 What you gon' tell me when I tell you 'Pac introduced me to the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat 
 It all started with a Starter coat 
 Wonderin' why Brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo' 
 On my way to cop my navy blue Starter coat 
 It all started with a Starter coat 
 The starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin' smoke 
 Without it I'd be dead or be an artichoke 
 The 9 iron armor in the heart of gold (it's that fo') 
 Nobody witchu nigga that's the Art of War (let's go to war) 
 But do not forget you fuckin' start it doe (that's my mama) 
 (Whoa, what kinda coat is that?) Starter coat 
 I grew up with three brothers 
 As soon as I was born my lungs collapsed 
 And I had to be hooked up to a ventilator 
 Now a nigga shining doe 
 Growing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners doe 
 I gave a lot of people my respect 
 Daddy taught me that one growing up 
 He threw me through a shower door 
 I used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo' 
 Crawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke 
 I found out he got a crack problem and he thought he dropped a couple particles 
 Well I'm a fucking alcoholic so 
 Who am I to judge, I'm just honorable 
 I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho 
 I'm a pure artist I don't need to see the charts to know the art is under our control 
 Highs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal 
 I guess I'm just the best at thanking God and feeling awesome doe 
 'Cause I survived the era of the Starter coat 
 It all started with the Starter coat 
 I lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat 
 I ain't graduate on time 
 I ain't go to college so 
 A couple friends of mine did 
 Other friends of mine dead 
 I'm fuckin' reminded 
 Just because I made the most money 
 That don't mean I went the farthest doe 
 I hope my college friends reminded 
 You got degrees that don't mean you the smartest doe 
 Mo' money, mo' problems 
 I lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor 
 Then I left in my Starter coat 
 What they taught us that was all a joke 
 You may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post 
 I'm arguing with Satan screaming "I don't barter souls!" 
 Please don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat 
 What kind of coat is that? Starter coat 
 What kind of coat is that? Starter coat 
 What kind of coat is that? Starter coat 
 What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
