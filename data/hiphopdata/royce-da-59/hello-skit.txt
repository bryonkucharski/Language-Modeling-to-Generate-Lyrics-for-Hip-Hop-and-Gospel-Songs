 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey 
 See, who the hell is this? 
 Calling me in the morning 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Calling me in the morning 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Bitch! 
 (Melanie Rutherford) 
 You do not know me, but I know you 
 I've been at your home, sexing your man 
 He is not happy when he's at home 
 I am his one thing, just so you know 
 Girl let me tell you, I am old-school 
 You played your part and you knew the rules 
 You classified as one thing or two 
 I am his wife so don't be confused 
 Girl let me tell you just so you know 
 You are the streets and I am his home 
 Don't confuse lust with something so pure 
 If you call again I'll be at your door 
 Don't make me act up, up out the rage 
 See I am a lady so have a nice day 
 So who the hell is this calling me in the morning 
 Who the hell is this calling me in the morning 
 (Melanie Rutherford) 
 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey, get 'em up 
 Hey 
 See, who the hell is this? 
 Calling me in the morning 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Calling me in the morning 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Bitch!
