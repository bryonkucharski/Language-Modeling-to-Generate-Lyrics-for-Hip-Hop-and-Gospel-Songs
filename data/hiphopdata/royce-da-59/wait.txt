Shoot [gunshots] 
 Trust the fuckin' shooter 
 Being feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does 
 So I play to the tune of my own eardrum 
 While I'm out on my quest, love 
 I don't speak on behalf of myself, but my impeccable rep does 
 Christmas morning I remember waking up wishin' I could just go to sleep 
 'Cause we only got like two toys a piece 
 I ask my pops did he do more for me? 
 He said "yes, I got you clothes and heat 
 And let you keep a whole two rows of teeth" 
 Ha, I'm royalty 
 I took whoopings, I took losses, but no defeats 
 Been dropped, and been shelved with no release 
 Been in jail, no commissary or relief 
 But God looks over me like a cross and rosary 
 Rifle in hand, I let niggas have it, I won't hesitate 
 Writes on the cans in the cabinet "section eight" 
 My son got on them three-fifty boots Kanye West is dressed in bape 
 Askin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base 
 Uh, wifey textin' SMH, house phone ringin' off the hook 
 Conference calls from record labels, guess I'm late 
 But, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention 
 This might just be my defining moment, let them wait 
 It's my time now, nigga; let them wait 
 Pick up the phone, tell 'em hold; let them wait 
 Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile 
 After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait 
 Wait, I'm here for that green, for that mula 
 You scheme, I see right through ya 
 I'm regal like a Akeem, father King of Zamunda 
 One thing's for sure I think they do know 
 That me, and Porter, and Jake Uno 
 We don't play no games, no, we play sumo 
 We attempt to flatten into action 
 With all these average, flacid defenseless rappers 
 I have no problem killing like sent assassins 
 They temper's bad when my temper's graphic 
 They hide or they fly while I'm high and flyer 
 I'm intergalactic, I've been spectacular 
 Flippin' like I invented spatulas, my lyrics is futuristic 
 I'm in here with my vintage ratchet with prints and scratches 
 My mental action-ly incapacitates fast as my passion 
 And pen surpasses my Aston 
 And leave a skid road in the street like I'm into smackin' 
 I fill my engine with acid 
 With my finger wrapped around a hair-trigger that resembles lashes 
 I get into bitches quick and then I get distracted 
 I'm like the stock market, just like that, my interest crashes 
 Like a cymbal, my symbol should be expensive glasses 
 She with me, she a afro-centric nympho chick with a ass did 
 She callin' me back-to-back for a second date 
 While my ex is callin' for make-up-dick -- let them wait 
 Money all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City, I weapon wave 
 Everybody, step away 
 They said that we should go our separate ways, in high school Now they wanna jump the line in my shows -- let them wait 
 My whole life, they pressured me -- let them wait 
 You rushin' me you rushin' excellence -- let them wait 
 Police in my rear-view mirror with they sirens on 
 But I'ma call my lawyer first 'fore I pull over -- let them wait 
 It's my time now, nigga, let them wait 
 Pick up the phone, tell them hold, let them wait 
 Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile 
 After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait
