I'm signing off on this 
 On the same ones the treasury prints 
 With every intent to see niggas dying off of it 
 I signed at Sony 
 A couple of years after the NBA signed Kobe 
 And he about to retire 
 So if anybody see Don Lenner 
 Make sure you tell him I ain't lost it yet 
 Somebody tell Tom Silverman "Hi" for me 
 Look in the sky there's a fly sorcerer 
 Eye-balling me from of a flying saucer 
 And my mind is like a full clip 
 And my competitions' magazines are running low 
 Like the Source and Vibe offices 
 Since '99, Hip-Hop been like my orphanage 
 Got dropped a lot 
 But every time I signed I got a million 
 A&Rs and exec's were telling me I'm not appealing 
 Trying to turn me into Nas, I'm not him but I forgive you 
 This is a Bob Marley 
 Bob Dylan spiritual vibe that I'm feeling 
 These scars are time healing 
 Clearly you lost 
 You tried to put me in a box--how dare you 
 Try to minimize a lyrical god? 
 I'll godzilla these walls 
 My prime's no time near 
 I'll improvise till my ceilings 
 Get wizard of Oz 
 I'm the illest alive 
 I'm the rose that rose 
 From the concrete with the thorn 
 And when I'm gone I shall live in a vase 
 Me and Porter just handling business 
 Boy we came a long way from blasting cannons 
 And having to throw 'em in trash cans 
 Dismantling shipments 
 I had the manager shift at my day job too 
 I laid down rules 
 No gas station past 8 mile 
 Past eight or late drive-throughs 
 Maxell tape, you play the whole B side 
 You flip it over and hear the whole A side too 
 Now we got iCloud and FaceTime basically 
 To knock down the grape vine 
 Make way as the chaos ensues 
 Niggas saving ratchets calling themselves bosses 
 But they not 
 They David Hasselhoff 
 And they bay watch 
 But I'm cool 
 Nowadays my life be lavish 
 Who I'm out with tonight 
 It might be a model or 
 Might be an actress 
 She might be a ballerina 
 She might do plays 
 She might just like theatrics 
 She might be famous 
 I must just pipe her for bragging rights 
 She might get mad at the paparazzi 
 For flashing cameras at her ass 
 As she covers her face 
 As if she's dabbing 
 She might be dragging 
 Me at some uptight fashion show somewhere 
 Where people like Madonna and Bono go 
 I might take one look up and down at the clothes 
 And say, "Hell no, It's time to go." 
 Come on it's time to go 
 I might fuck her on the kitchen table 
 At her crib in the Hamptons 
 I might lay her down gently 
 I might slam her 
 I might even fuck around and yell domino 
 My soul just sound off like "you got a pair." 
 I'm a real nigga 
 I done lost a lot of friends over the years 
 I've been losing a lot of hair 
 Been told that I'm out my mind 
 But if you only knew what was inside it 
 You too would choose to stay out of there 
 I take my hats off to the addicts 
 Going through something tragic in their lives 
 Shit even I backed off the madness 
 I had to take some time off the rap and realize 
 Now how do I stop being underrated? 
 How do I get props like, let's say, a Drake? 
 But I rap with the skill set of let's say 
 A Black Thought or an Elhzi 
 If Jay Elec can bag a Rothschild without an album then I can come back to rap after doing some jail time 
 No one cares about sales now 
 They care about Facebook status 
 It's all about gadgets and getting fatter than hell 
 And consuming shit like them Patti LaBelle pies 
 Like lunatics, speaking of, I knew this chick 
 Who used to just be happy to make it out the hood to see me 
 Then she got on some fucking Truman shit 
 She's starting asking me to do some shit... 
 (Record fades to close)
