I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary 
 Legendary 
 I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary 
 Legendary, legendary 
 The theme song to my supplier 
 Plays in the key of a key 
 I'm like a messiah crossed with The Wire 
 Rapping around the Boardwalk Empire 
 Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter 
 I'm sick enough to take my life, then take your life after 
 Don't take me light or play me light 
 We two of the same 
 God melted a Rubik's cube into fluid 
 And threw it in my intuitive brain 
 I'm eating food for moving music in a gratuitous lane 
 I threw twice, now I'm running through it 
 'Til I'm through with the game 
 You can find me under a black cloud, I'm a dark star 
 Only thing I hate worse than a mark is a marked car 
 I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell 
 If you could put a face with my style it'd be Samuel Cassel's 
 I switched the fire up like I am a tyranny from hell 
 What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell 
 'Cause it's the hammer, the cannon you can dance with the shells 
 My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail 
 I'm a heavyweight, I'm catastrophic when I set it like Fahrenheit 9/11 
 Meditate till the levees break 
 I tar and feather featherweight till my fetti straight 
 The MAC-11 will clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face 
 Uh, you ever look inside some dying eyes? 
 You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God 
 When was the last time that you heard that the iron tried? 
 Ryan vibes like cyanide, I am proud to say that 
 I've evolved, there's only one "I" in "Defying odds" 
 Small time arrogance parishes every time in giant pride 
 Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing 
 Your favorite MC could probably find themselves 
 Vibing to my lost sections, I'm legendary 
 Now everybody wanna believe me 
 But they don't really know what's in my heart 
 This time around is starting to feel easy 
 My enemies starting to fall down 
 I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary 
 My enemies starting to fall down 
 I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary, legendary 
 (Fall down) 
 I'm legendary 
 I got my noodles intact 
 You want support of Detroit rap nigga's can Google this gat 
 'Cause we the reason why you eating we put the food on the map 
 Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack 
 Just who we hitting here? This here's a different year 
 So you shouldn't assume I'm trying to measure up 
 To you when I tell you the ruler is back 
 In fact, as far as you new kids, what've you did? 
 I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past 
 But I'm happy to say that I've built a new bridge 
 As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready 
 I will make my children's peanut butter 
 And jelly sandwich with a machete 
 Uh, you marry the streets than we will kill at your wedding 
 Tell every guest at your reception 
 They gon' get more than just hit with confetti 
 Uh, now your bitch a believer 
 You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb? 
 You get the 'ghini, I'm sitting in, riding through Pittsburgh 
 While I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa 
 Black and Yellow a blunt to joint, here's the reefer 
 One minute you tough, one minute you shook 
 I know I've learned a while ago to hide power from you 
 I should just put it in a book 
 You illiterate parasites I'll kill you every time 
 Throw a nigga body around the room 
 Have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai 
 And yes, I am a firm believer that the naked truth 
 Looks a hundred times better then the best dressed lie 
 And while you nigga's is hating, I wonder is God really an atheist 
 He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan 
 Y'all need to repent because y'all been imitating 
 A statue of me to you is a statute of limitations 
 You backwards as me and a feminist dating 
 Let's tally the sales, like Gladys and Patty LaBelle 
 I'm a big wig, my straws in the hole 
 Of a volcano, I'm having a big swig 
 Everybody wanna believe me 
 But they don't really know what's in my heart 
 This time around is starting to feel easy 
 My enemies starting to fall down 
 I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary 
 My enemies starting to fall down 
 I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary 
 (Fall down) 
 I'm legendary 
 I'm legendary, legendary, legendary 
 I'm legendary 
 I'm legendary, legendary, legendary 
 I'm legendary
