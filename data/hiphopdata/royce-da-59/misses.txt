(K-Young and Royce Da 5'9") 
 I know you see me calling him 
 Yo what's up, you reached 3-1-3-7-8-9-0-5-0-9 
 Be nice bitch, be nice 
 I ain't around, leave a message 
 Hey baby I know you're busy, I just want to see how you were and see what you're doing, I know you're in the studio. I'm about to go out with my girls, but if you need me to do anything, call me. Okay? I love you, muah, muah, muah

 Me and my baby started out like two peas in a pod 
 Me and my baby, nothing can come between she and I 
 That's my lil misses, little fly, little chick, thick little thighs 
 Everything I'm into, she alright with it 
 And she on tip, she on mine 
 I'mma slide right in, get in her mind 'cause she's a keeper 
 Any time she's with me, nah, she ain't gotta lift a finger 
 She ain't gotta spend a dime, she around me all the time 
 'Cause she's so cool, even my friends don't mind 
 That's my lil misses, always so calm, always so kind 
 (K-Young) 
 Lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind 
 I look forward to her call, I enjoy when you talking 
 Lil misses on my mind 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 She never waste my time when she on my line 
 She stay on my mind 
 Oh my God when she blow me 
 She blow me good, it blow my mind 
 I'm on tour right now, now she texting me saying 
 I was out doing ecstasy, molly and coke with four of my girls 
 And I think I gotta throw up and go and lie down 
 I look at my phone like wow 
 I think about all the Patron I downed 
 Maybe that's your business, no judgement here 
 Baby that's your lifestyle 
 She said, "I'm so glad you not mad" 
 I said "No my doll, but I gotta get to stage right now 
 But please be careful hanging with the all night crowd." 
 (K-Young) 
 My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind 
 Hanging out, poppin' pills, now she sniffin', now she's real 
 Caught me trippin' on my line 
 (K-Young and Royce Da 5'9") 
 You reached 3-1-3-7-8-9-0-5-0-9 
 Ugh 
 I ain't around, leave a message 
 Baby, call me, I'm high haha 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 I came back from tour, she done got skinny with acne 
 She got her hair dyed blond and it's up in a bun 
 Her ass is flat and it's gone 
 I asked what the fuck was happening 
 She reached up and tried to slap me 
 (No, ah!) 
 I slipped and she missed it 
 And then ran in the bathroom and slammed the door 
 I was like, hell you alright? 
 All I heard through the screaming 
 Was something about me following chicks on Snapchat 
 And her having pics of me and her in the sack last 
 And she 'bout to go sell it to a site 
 She even told me she already sent an email to my wife 
 Damn, my lil misses blackmailing me and shit 
 I guess she fell for the hype 
 (K-Young) 
 My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind 
 You completely switched into another bitch 
 So now I got a psycho mistress on my line 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 For some reason I believed the bitch 
 Best thing I could do is 
 Tell my wife before my wifey see the shit 
 Maybe I can loosen her up 
 By taking her on a vacation or skiing trip 
 Maybe I can lean in for a kiss and plead the fifth 
 Damn, shit was all good just a week ago 
 Until we hit a fever pitch 
 Now I gotta go on my phone and delete the bitch 
 Then I get a text saying "I'm pregnant and I'm keeping it 
 I'mma get my child support 
 And I plan on paying my lease with it 
 You ain't never gotta worry about hearing from me again" 
 (K-Young and Royce Da 5'9") 
 Aye what up this is Royce I'm away from my phone for at least two weeks, I'm on a family trip with my wife and kids. Please leave a message 
 You didn't tell me about no family trip. Fuck that bitch, fuck your family, Ryan I need you to call me 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 It was all good, just a week ago, yeah 
 High in the sky and I played my role 
 It was all good, just a week ago, yeah 
 I understood and now I am alone, yeah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

 What would Lincoln's bitch ass do at a time like this? 
 Shit, I'mma answer my damn phone
