This one goes out to all the big willies 
 Big Will the high roller 
 Strolling through with an entoruage 
 Hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large 
 I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage 
 Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen 
 My whole auroa gleamin' 
 Who that kid in the green v 
 Envy brother schemin' 
 I ain't thinkin' 'bout them 
 Racing chicks in the pink b.m. 
 With my speakers tweakin' 
 Freakin' off this weekend 
 In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers 
 Money can't break us but the places it can take us 
 Big will in the limelight rhyme tight 
 And we gon' have some fun tonight 
 Now how we do it 
 (You know it's Big Willie style baby) 
 Now how we doin' it 
 (You know it's Big Willie style) 
 Repeat 
 I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down (boom) 
 Non bettin' willie watchers standin' around 
 Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us 
 How bad they wanna be us (parlay) 
 Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack 
 Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black 
 People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar 
 A round for everybody with these big willie cards 
 From civllians to stars they wanna know who we are 
 It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar 
 Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit 
 Verse 3: Left Eye 
 It's Left Eye with a tight crew 
 Representin' like it's ladies night 
 Comin' right through 
 Don't be spiteful 
 Plus an eyeful 
 Sportin' hot pink 
 Rocks in the link 
 In the drop with a mink 
 Like my ------ don't stink 
 Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm 
 Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot 
 Left Eye ready for action 
 The main attraction 
 I'm in the fast lane passin' 
 Breakin' you down like fractions 
 While we be rappin' about things that really happen 
 Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen 
 With mademouselle from gezals to versace 
 With a sweet smell 
 This female leadin' the posse 
 Got jokes like Cosby 
 In the lots where the cars be 
 With no apologies it's Left Eye 
 Big Will let the champagne spill 
 Is it a man's thing for real 
 Can us girls roll wit y'all 
 What the deal 
 Well now it's lookin' like a car show 
 Convoys and whips on the strip 
 Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick 
 For real 
 Big Will household name 
 Entertainer 
 Gold handle cane and matchin' gators 
 Swervin' lane 
 In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition 
 In soul poisition and can rock a whole convention 
 Movie screens to the club scene 
 My whole crew lookin' clean 
 Shine with a diamond gleam 
 Step above where the players be 
 Don't hate me 
 One is where they rate me 
 Lately you could find me 
 Behind the door marked V.I.P. 
 Eating grapes under the A.C. 
 Big willie style is how we do it 
 This one goes out to all the big willies
