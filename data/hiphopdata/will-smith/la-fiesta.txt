 Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot) 
 La fiesta (whoot, whoot) 
 If I approach you correctly 
 And step up to you respectfully 
 Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance? 
 I don't intend to offend you 
 I only intend to befriend you 
 But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me 
 With them hot pants, not a chance 
 I'mma let you go without saying something 
 A little hotter lombada mama that's all that I'm wanting 
 No frontin' if it was illegal for you to be that fine 
 I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime 
 Literally, first it'll be dancing with me 
 Then it'll be dinner with me 
 Then it'll be back to my crib 
 Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself 
 And I'm playing myself 
 The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff 
 I'm saying the stuff 
 My bad, back it up let's start with a dance 
 On good behavior, maybe later 
 Maybe your apartment, your pad 
 Sike, joke, walking a tight rope 
 My foot in my mouth 
 Look, I hope is that you'll dance with me 
 What's up? 
 Repeat 1 
 She was smiling I was kind wiling 
 Thinking I'm dialin' in 
 She gave me the impression that she was getting my message 
 So I'm testing 
 I threw it out there 'Let me buy you a drink' 
 'Cause when I buy you I think it would be fly if we link 
 What'cha think? 
 She responded with a grin and a glance 
 Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance 
 The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest 
 The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise 
 The other night I seen her dancing 
 Duty was over 
 She did a split into a spin 
 And put her leg on his shoulder 
 And he was over 
 If that was me and I was he 
 We'd probably still be dancing 
 Mami can you feel me? 
 Still she said nothing 
 Why she be fronting? 
 Never seen another mami move like you 
 Groove like you 
 I'm saying I wanna dance with you 
 What's up? 
 Repeat 1 
 To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic 
 It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help emphasize 
 Some people dance socially not emotionally 
 Closer to me, come on close as you can be 
 (Can you feel me?) 
 Come on mama cut me no slack 
 (Can you feel me?) 
 Come on mama forward and back 
 (Can you feel me?) 
 Come on mama as hard as you can 
 It's part of the plan 
 It happens when you start with the man 
 On your mark, ready set, baby let's go 
 Baby let's flow, baby let go 
 Baby no, no, gotta a lot more 
 Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that 
 *Girl yells* 
 Yeah that's it 
 Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me 
 It's better with me 
 Gain it, other girls I've dated ain't famous 
 So take it or leave it 
 Just the way that I eat it 
 I bring, I swing it 
 So you like that? 
 Tell me what's up 
 Repeat 1 till end
