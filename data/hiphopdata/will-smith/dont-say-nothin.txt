Yo (let's talk about) 
 When I released my first single back in like '86 
 People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak 
 You know then I mess around I go world trade on them 
 Bangin' out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring 
 My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing 
 Take your place allow me to flex a taste 
 As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase 
 Face me the star of stage and TV 
 My face be seen in almost every country 
 Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee 
 Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from West Philly 
 Thought I was wack 'cause I wanted to act 
 Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that 
 The ill kid 
 Hundred million dollar bill kid 
 The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid 
 Don't try to act like this summer at the greek 
 You won't be bumpin the big Willie in your jeep 
 I know y'all still feel me 
 Really don't act silly 
 Thought I feel off just because I left Philly 
 Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus 
 I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers 
 I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah 
 She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up (hell naa) 
 While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa 
 I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada to date her 
 Vertex is me the magnanimous 
 Got you saying damn I've always been a fan of his 
 Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't 
 Look here y'all don't say nothing then I won't 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Man I love being me ready to rock ya block 
 With some more hot top not ___ for you to cop 
 No more mr. nice guy 
 My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling 
 Jealousy swinging on me made his attack 
 (He soft he wack man that ain't real rap) 
 You believe that 
 It hurt me at first but it's cool 
 Took the insults fed 'em to my ego used it for fuel 
 Now everywhere I turn a dead end 
 Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens 
 And they be screaming out 
 (Oh my lord) 
 Did you see it's that 
 (Brother from ID4) 
 Now can I please get 
 (A picture and your signature) 
 Sure you can miss 
 (Oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna believe this) 
 Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic 
 Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent 
 Bangkok to Madagascar they wanna see me 
 Princepe in Spain Japan I'm kota ishe 
 I like my steaks thick and my jets private 
 And my son to ride in the cockpit 
 I know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot 
 While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips 
 Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip 
 Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic 
 Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't 
 Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers 
 Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters 
 I'm about to show you how a man like me works 
 My shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper 
 Four five chromed out former two seaters 
 Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert 
 'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probably a couple 
 Of elbows 
 Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows 
 Rock film festivals and rap shows 
 All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers 
 My so called friends who been nothing but actors 
 You're way of character but now who's the bomb 
 It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed 
 Y'all know what it is 
 Ah damn that's right y'all don't 
 But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin') 
 Don't say nothin' (don't say nothin')
