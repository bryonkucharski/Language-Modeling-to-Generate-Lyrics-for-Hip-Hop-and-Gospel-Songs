It's the Freshman 
 Big Willie 
 Uh 
 I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter) 
 You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter) 
 I don't care what you heard 
 I don't care where you been 
 A party ain't a party till I get there 
 Dance, an aphrodisiac 
 Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts 
 To stimulating musical tracks 
 I thought I was just gon' come out tonight and get a brew and relax 
 But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter 
 It's like you're on call, you're what the doctor ordered 
 It's like you gotta block the border to the door 
 And shock 'em when it's boring... 
 Git on the floor! 
 Ughh, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest 
 Tight, strapped to my chest 
 Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin' 
 And be like "Oh!", fulfillin' my callin' 
 Big! (Big), Will! (Will), that's my name! (whoop) 
 Writin' rhymes, that's my game! (whoop) 
 Ask me again and I'll tell you the same! (whoop) 
 Just write ya number down right next to ya name, girl 
 I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter) 
 You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter) 
 I don't care what you heard 
 I don't care where you been 
 A party ain't a party till I get there 
 He was raised in the days when the roof was raised 
 Every rap occasion, new and amazing 
 The back of the stage amazed and gazin' 
 Prayin' for the day they would one day praise him 
 Studied the ways of the game and made it 
 Came through the maze and the haze and played it perfect 
 Days any person hated and cursed him, he was unfazed 
 He waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated 
 He saved it, slavin', on the road blazin' 
 Days when he was low, nothin' could raise him 
 He came to the show and somethin' uncaged in him 
 Like the pope, but its party crusade 
 I'm like braids that's never gon' 
 Fade (ya heard) 
 I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave 
 Like you threw a grenade - BOOM! 
 I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter) 
 You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter) 
 I don't care what you heard 
 I don't care where you been 
 A party ain't a party till I get there 
 I call for the days of the unadulterated 
 When the artistry was cultivated 
 You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered 
 We could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn) 
 Now today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about partyin' 
 I was a mini-party starter then 
 My mind bends when I call my pen 
 The big question should I run the mind a vittle 
 Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little 
 But Will "if you come to high that'll alienate folks and they won't buy it"(yo) 
 Look, people getting trapped in the track 
 And they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack 
 Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that? 
 He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back 
 (Ya heard me!) 
 I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter) 
 You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter) 
 I don't care what you heard 
 I don't care where you been 
 A party ain't a party till I get there
