Here come the Men in Black 
 It's the M.I.B.s, uh, here come the M.I.B.s 
 Here come the Men in Black 
 They won't let you remember 
 Nah nah nah 
 The good guys dress in black, remember that 
 Just in case we ever face to face and make contact 
 The title held by me: M.I.B. 
 Means what you think you saw, you did not see 
 So don't blink be what was there is now gone 
 Black suit with the black Ray Ban's on 
 Walk in shadow, move in silence 
 Guard against extraterrestrial violence 
 But yo', we ain't on no government list 
 We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints 
 Saw somethin' strange, watch your back 
 'Cause you never quite know where the M.I.B.s is at 
 Uh and 
 Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black) 
 Galaxy defenders (oahhaooh oh) 
 Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black) 
 They won't let you remember 
 Uh uh, uh uh, now 
 From the deepest of the darkest of night 
 On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight 
 Cameras zoom on the impending doom 
 But then, like, boom, black suits fill the room up 
 With the quickness, talk with the witnesses 
 Hypnotizer, neuralizer 
 Vivid memories turn to fantasies 
 Ain't no M.I.B.s, can I please 
 Do what we say, that's the way we kick it 
 YanawhaImean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya 
 We're your first, last and only line of defense 
 Against the worst scum of the universe 
 So don't fear us, cheer us 
 If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless 
 M.I.B.s, freezin' up all the flack 
 (What's that stand for?) Men in Black 
 Uh M 
 The Men in Black 
 The Men in Black 
 Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me 
 Just bounce it with me, c'mon 
 Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me 
 Just slide with me, c'mon 
 Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me 
 Take a walk with me, c'mon 
 And make your neck work 
 Now freeze 
 Ooaaoo 
 Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black) 
 The galaxy defenders 
 Right on, right on 
 Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black) 
 They won't let you remember (oh no) 
 All right check it, let me tell you this in closin' 
 I know we might seem imposin' 
 But trust me, if we ever show in your section 
 Believe me, it's for your own protection 
 'Cause we see things that you need not see 
 And we be places that you need not be 
 So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap 
 Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the men in 
 That's the men in 
 Here come the Men in Black (here they come) 
 The galaxy defenders (galaxy defenders) 
 Here come the Men in Black (oh, here they come) 
 They won't let you remember (won't, let you, remember) 
 Here come the Men in Black (oh, here they come) 
 Galaxy defenders (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) 
 Here come the Men in Black 
 They won't let you remember
