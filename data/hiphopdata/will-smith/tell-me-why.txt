(INTRO) - Why, why, why, why, why. Why 
 I really wish I could explain it baby (why), 
 It's just the world is kinda crazy baby (why), 
 Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby (why), 
 Don't cry, dry your eyes 
 September 11th, I woke up about 7am, west coast time, French toast and my 
 Turkey bacon, taking my time, awakin', turning my TV on 
 To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw 
 Me and my children, images were chillin' 
 My son said, "Daddy were there people in that building?" 
 A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest 
 I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say "Yes" to him 
 That night at my son's side, he cried and prayed 
 For the one's who died in the World Trade 
 His palms to God, seeds and qualms with God 
 He just kept on pressin' me, wanna know why 
 Then one week later our bombs were dropped 
 We seein' them on CNN, they just won't stop 
 The infrared images of brutal attack 
 He said, "Daddy now we killin' 'em back"; (right, right) 
 (BRIDGE - Mary J. Blige:) 
 Mmmmm, souls are captured 
 Dreams are stolen, hearts are broken 
 Evil blatantly rewarded 
 Hate surrenders, Love exalted 
 Hope elated, negativity is shorted 
 Why is the bomb always getting the last word 
 And why did her uncle have to molest her 
 And why did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill 
 And why did all them priests have to act so ill 
 Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched 
 Tell me why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us 
 Tell me why did that sniper make the little boy shoot 
 And why is human life always denied for loot 
 Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage 
 Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age 
 Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate 
 And why the f*@k can't love seem to defeat hate 
 Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat 
 Why did Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street 
 Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way 
 Please what am I supposed to say to my kids when they say 'Why?' 
 Can't explain it baby, life is just really crazy 
 I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby 
 We got more stores than they got rice under Buddha lazy 
 You live four scores and still it be driving you crazy 
 But for me I try to see the bright side 
 Sometimes it'd be like the goodness be tryin' to hide 
 Then try to flee, but it can't it's deep inside 
 Sweetie, you be the light for the others, make 'em believe in God
