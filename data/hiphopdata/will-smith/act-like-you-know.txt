Uh 
 Big Will and Tra-Knox 
 Yo yo yo yo jump 
 When I tell you make your way up to the front 
 Addicted to the way I kick it I know what you want 
 The don jiggy catering to what your feeling 
 Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling 
 Shake 
 What ya momma gave you baby don't let nothin' break 
 Yo watch 'cause we don't care how much time it's gonna take 
 Dance floor packed and it's lookin' like a lake 
 It's obduction here's your instructions 
 Slide 
 Get up off that wall girl stop tryin' to hide 
 Trackin' afrodesiac won't be denied 
 Chill with that cigarette take it outside 
 Messin' with my vibe 
 I don't like that 
 Bounce 
 I'm a press your player when it counts 
 Party like a lamb and a wolf about to pounce 
 The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling 
 Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling 
 Bring it on the nothing 
 Ain't no time for fun things (come on) 
 Just let it flow (jump on) 
 Act like you know 
 The only floor is jumpin' 
 Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on) 
 Just let it flow (jump on) 
 Act like you know 
 I-I-I-I called Jazzy Jeff on the phone 
 I said, "I'm downstairs waitin' Jeff come on" 
 I told him there's this hot spot we gotta burn 
 He said, "Man after last weekend haven't you learned?" 
 Yo look here last week was a mistake 
 That mommy tryin' to dish out what she couldn't take 
 Come back me dancin' like wow like this thing is a game 
 One little move on her and she bust into flames (whoosh) 
 The whole club runnin' tryin' to ruin my night 
 I told her roll around little she'll be all right 
 Then everybody mad at me all up in my face 
 Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place 
 You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya 
 And hopefully your burnt guci dress will remind ya 
 Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy y'all 
 But if you wanna play hunny go get a baby doll 
 Holla at me 
 Bring it on the nothing 
 Ain't no time for fun things (come on) 
 Just let it flow (jump on) 
 Act like you know 
 The only floor is jumpin' 
 Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on)

 Check and make sure I'm packin' lute for huh 
 'Cause I'm about to shut down the bar for huh 
 And later open up my car door for huh 
 7 PM I leave the set and then 
 No more actin' back to rappin' again 
 Red carpet hectic gettin' me in 
 What happened last week sure it could happen again 
 Mos def full funk when ya lookin' at the front lookin' like a jet magazine beauty of the month 
 Shades low layin' liggy low on the cut 
 Told myself you're the one to shake it up with 
 Bounce 
 Over to your table can get me on announce 
 Observe the curves body fat about an ounce 
 Hormones pumpin' out dangerous amounts 
 Grabbed ya arm turn around girl 
 Jump 
 Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front 
 Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want 
 The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling 
 Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling 
 Come on
