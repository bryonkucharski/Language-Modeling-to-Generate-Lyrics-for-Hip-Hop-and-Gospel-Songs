Original - A first form from which varieties arise 
 An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation or reproduction 
 Why should I try to sound like y'all sound 
 That's what's wrong with the rap game right now 
 Man, it's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns 
 Wit a bunch of clicks I'll probably rap circles around 
 I spit heatrock and I ain't talking rollin' 
 Soon as the beat knock I'm crowd controlling 
 When I hear y'all that a awful sound 
 I don't ride beats I take them off the ground 
 Land them somewhere show them the town 
 Even on foreign ground I let them know I'm around 
 I don't follow everybody when it's time to rap 
 At one time everybody thought the world was flat 
 Sounds like you that was my intention 
 I paid dues now dudes pay attention 
 I live for it even though the flicks is hittin' 
 Cribs sick you can see the booth from the kitchen 
 Speak on it 'cause I saw it happen 
 This is hip hop dawg 
 I ain't just rappin' 
 Y'all looking at a real MC 
 Man you couldn't check a mic for me 
 Why should I try to sound like y'all sound 
 That's what's wrong wit the rap game right now 
 Why should I try to flow the way y'all flow 
 Or do a show like y'all show 
 Naw that ain't where my head at now 
 Y'all in the hip hop lost and found 
 Man, that's wrong with the rap game right now 
 It's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns 
 Wit a bunch of clicks 
 I'll probably rap circles around 
 Let's talk about rhyme capability 
 Let's talk about hip hop versatility 
 Let's talk about taking the game beyond 
 Now how the hell we gon have a battle of wits 
 Trick you ain't armed 
 Let's talk about love for the game 
 I mean real love 
 Back before there was fame 
 I'm real wit it 
 I ain't claiming to reign 
 But when y'all talk about rap 
 Y'all gon start saying my name 
 For real though I ain't playin' 
 Plenty of y'all love a brotha just scared to say it 
 Yo the first ever rap grammy 
 Let's talk about the only reason yo ass went to Miami 
 (Yup) truck wit rims (check) throw back jersey (check) 
 Champagne bottles (check) lot's of models (check) 
 Damn that's the list for 90 percent of y'all videos and songs 
 Am I wrong 
 LOST 
 When you a slave to the biz 
 Wit no care for the cost of what you sayin' to kids 
 Found 
 Is when ya lyrics are a test of time 
 And your mom hear that your spirit is blessed divine 
 LOST 
 Is when you rhyme till your throat gets sore 
 But you don't even believe what you say no more 
 Found 
 Is when you bleed heart into the mic 
 And the pain you sustain it can change a life 
 LOST 
 Is when you hide behind the freedom of speech 
 While sure you're free to do it 
 But what it mean to do it 
 Did you mean to do it 
 Did you need to do it 
 Did you take time to think about the seeds you ruined 
 FOUND Is ESCO, dead PREZ and them 
 FOUND Is Lauren Hill 
 FOUND Is Rakim 
 FOUND Can be you 
 If you felt the message and ask yourself this questioin 
 (Chorus out)
