From a distance, you can witness the glow from my entourage 
 Gravitate towards the ambiance 
 See me and my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin 
 Cause hate is the chld to greatness 
 The glue between Neo and the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang 
 It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP 
 (B section) 
 I said stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me 
 All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job 
 Stop, get out - the whole world loves me 'cause I do what I do 
 And I don't like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave 'em off 
 (I just wave 'em off, yeah) I ain't concerned with your hatin' that don't slow down my paper makin' 
 (Wave 'em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes 
 (Wave 'em off yeah) Love me, I paved the way, boys we can't behave this way come on 
 (Wave 'em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes 
 Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian and Asian faces 
 No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation 
 So demonstrating the way to be patient with life's test, through my IRS situations 
 My guess is my dedication don't phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin' 
 Why? That's so last year, that's so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me 
 I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky 
 When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can't deny 
 Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I... 
 Block 'em out, ignore 'em (wave 'em off) 
 Don't pay these jokers no mind (wave 'em off) 
 They just all mad 'cause they in the coat section of the hate train and they can't get off 
 Still flaming boy, stand clear of the hatin' is the best defense Tryin' to exceed excellence 
 Same way hope comes with fear, yo, 
 Greatness lives here, then 'hateness' lives here, Trust!
