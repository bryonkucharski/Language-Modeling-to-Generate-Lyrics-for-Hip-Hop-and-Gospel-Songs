All this excess stress I can't take it 
 Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid 
 Why you gotta be all up in her face kid? 
 The ABS will get you numbers and the name kid 
 I mean really, houndin' ol' girl, was that really necessary 
 See your itinerary is all off 
 You need to be hauled off 
 She start flippin', she ain't trippin' it's your loss. 
 This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper 
 You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper 
 That mighta got you a couple of numbers when you were younger 
 But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper 
 Be a gentleman& try to be gentle man 
 The essence of stimulation mental man 
 But if your acting like you just got out the kennel man 
 Put your foot on the pedal and pump 
 (Chorus - snoop dogg) 
 If your girl's in ya face and she's outta place 
 What you need to tell her is... PUMP YA BRAKES 
 If you're out with your girls and he's pressin' you hard 
 What you need to tell him is... PUMP YA BRAKES 
 Now if you're underage and you're actin' all grown 
 What you need to do is PUMP YA BRAKES 
 If you're offended by this record, then you know that's you 
 What you need to do is... PUMP YA BRAKES 
 Outside the restaurant Girl sees Boy, Girl likes Boy 
 Girl meets Boy, Boy doesn't know that Girl thinks he's fly 
 Boy's a nice guy, so Boy says 'Hi' 
 Boy's Girlfriend returns from going to park 
 She sees them together this ignites a spark 
 Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark 
 Now this is where the pumpin' of the brakes should start 
 Girlfriend thinks that something's going on 
 Girl tells Girlfriend nothings going on 
 Boy's in the middle of the commotion beginning 
 Girlfriend's mad cause Boy keeps grinning 
 Now, why is he grinning but that's beside the point 
 Girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint 
 Jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey 
 Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy 
 Dummy 
 (Snoop dogg verse:) 
 Rule #1, is just like 2 the who do's and what nots and what you should dizz-ooh 
 No loud talking, no back talking, If you do either, believe it, you're 
 Back walking 
 I hate to sound rude but then again, I have to 
 My rap thang and my mack game, It'll smack you, click clack you, spit at you 
 I don't do it 'cause I want to, I do it 'cause I got to 
 I got a question to ask you, would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let em 
 Smash you 
 If I was you and you was I, would you keep it G or would you stay fly 
 If you was rich in a ditch, living low, would you push the button, 
 Keep it cuttin' or would you just let it go 
 Calm down little homey and know what your dealing with before you run up on me
