Dear Lord, why did you take my mama? 
 There's so much drama in my life, didn't have to take my mama 
 To make me right 
 Now the only time that I can see my mama 
 Is after life 
 I give up everything to see my mama 
 Come back to life 
 I even Sacrifice My Life fo mama 
 Lets reunite 
 Fuck my wife, fuck this marijuana 
 I die tonight 
 Juss to get my last sight of mama 
 Up in the sky 
 My lil son, he look juss like you mama 
 Don't be surprised 
 On the other side he got my fathers eyes 
 Jesus Christ apologize to my baby son at night for takin' his grandmamas 
 Life 
 My mama was sweet when we didn't eat 
 She could still make us laugh 
 Even though our ass was livin' out on the streets 
 Cryin for weeks prayin' to the Messiah 
 While the evil get, 25 to life fo' mama dyin' in fire 
 Trapped in a house 
 Tortured in the worst way 
 I got her name tatted across my chest for her birthday 
 But, Lord... 
 Chorus *(Yukmouth)* 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life. 
 Hear me, Lord. 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life. 
 All alone in this, world. 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life. 
 Hear me, what? 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life. 
 Dear Lord, why did you take my father? 
 There's so much drama in my life, and now you take my father 
 That shit ain't right 
 All he wanted to do was be a balla 
 Sniff China white 
 After, after hours of other ballas 
 Bettin on the dice 
 Give up my life juss to see my father 
 Lets reunite 
 He was my friend, I was his little potna 
 Big brother type 
 Didn't give a fuck what my mother like 
 When y'all broke up 
 Me and my father was so fuckin' tight 
 She had to show love 
 I never knew when I grew up that I be juss like you 
 Smokin' bud 
 Sellin drugs, and hustlin juss like you 
 Nigga I'm a Terminatior 2 of you though 
 You in a grave 
 Died from AIDS, some man made shit, an still they hate I'm gettin' paid 
 I miss my father and my mother 
 So do yo sisters and yo brothers 
 My son he miss his grandmother 
 Can't even sit on his grandpas lap for Christmas 
 I got the riches 
 But got nobody to share my shit wit 
 What is this?! 
 Lord 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life. 
 Hear me, Jahova. 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life. 
 One mo time. Uh. 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life. 
 God 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life. 
 Why did you take my grandma off this earth? 
 She had to be the sweetest woman to ever walk this earth 
 It sho hurts 
 My whole earth, Queen of the Universe 
 This the first time we don't get to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner at 
 Grandma's church 
 See, when my mama died she took me in 
 Even when my mama was alive she took then, straight put me in 
 A spare room in the house to live wit her 
 Young dirty nigga didn't have no money or nothin' to give to her 
 But still I lived wit her for 6 years 
 Then she died now it's juss tears 
 It seems like I'm the only one in the family left here 
 Trapped in this cold-hearted crazy world 
 Me, my wife, and my son 
 I'm parinoid to have a baby girl 
 'Cause life is fucked up, because of your prayers, I lived up 
 Became successful 
 Now that I got the money it seems that I stress mo' 
 Sometimes I wanna let go 
 In my life, do Heaven really got a ghetto? 
 Sacrifice my life 
 God, 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my grandma back to life. 
 Hear me, Lord, 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life. 
 All alone in this, world, 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life. 
 Ya hear me, God? 
 I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my dead potnas to life. 
 One love. 
 Uh. 
 Fo all my dead potnas (yes) 
 Fo my relatives, (rest in peace) my mom's, my pop's 
 My grandma (I love you) 
 I'ma see y'all when I get there, at the Pearly Gates 
 I do this fo my nigga... from the S. and V. 
 My nigga SEAG, and my nigga Rappin' Ron 
 My nigga Tupacalypse 
 And my nigga Biggie Smalls 
 Everybody that lost a loved one... Sacrifice your life. 
 To bring 'em back to life 
 Sacrifice your life 
 We gone see 'em, don't worry 
 Eternal life... we see 'em in the next life 
 Done deal.
