 Intimidation, fuckin' with a man 
 Never seen a badder dude 
 I'm rather lude 
 My condom sucked 
 But I don't give a fuck 
 Now nigga, nigga what 
 Opposition so frightend that they vrim a shadow 
 Hot sluts in the muggship creep without a paddle 
 I'm ready willin', and able to pull a bullet in your navel 
 If you got beef bring it to the table 
 I'm unstabile, look in my eyes 
 It's showin' death 
 Fuck right, I go on livin' 
 Wanna see a mil, before I'm killed 
 Get a house on the hills if it's god's will 
 Why niggas gotta cry an o.g 
 Better motherfuckers die before me 
 Bye, bye 
 There's a better place for gangbangers 
 I take you there 
 I like the motherfuckin' stablesingers 
 My itchy finger says fuck it and I squeeze the trigger 
 Watchin' I be the one to splat this ho-ass nigga 
 I ain't feelin'

 (Caine of menace clan) 
 The sun rises in the east 
 And sets in the west 
 But I'm down with that south, 
 With an s on my chest 
 It's that loced down key cocaine 
 To bring the pain 
 >From that menace to society 
 Better known as caine 
 It's that motherfuckin' thug shit 
 I'm bustin' slugs shit 
 Young and schoolboy 
 I'm becomin' a drug dealer 
 In the streets of that west 
 I wouldn't settle for less 
 Until I got my hands on that smiff and that wes 
 Niggas try to swollow me 
 It's all about survival, g 
 Fuck these bitch niggas 
 It's off some trouble, g 
 I blow 'em in the wind 
 And then I sell again 
 I pack a 9 milli 
 Cause that's my best friend 
 Niggas, I done told ya 
 Blow 'em up like dohja 
 Your momma couldn't keep ya 
 So I ain't tryin' to hold ya 
 I'm a motherfuckin' menace 
 Give me a life sentence 
 Picture it ain't over 
 Until the nigga finish 
 With that motherfuckin' thug shit 
 Bustin' slugs shit 
 I'm straight from the west 
 Home of that crip and blood shit 
 Where niggas die at day 
 Niggas die at night 
 Niggas die whenever 
 It seems the time is right 
 These soldiers play for keeps
