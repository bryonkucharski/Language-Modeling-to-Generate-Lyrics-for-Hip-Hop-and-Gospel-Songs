Yes, yes, yes, uh! 
 Balla shit, nigga

 (Regime shit baby) 
 Flossy shit, boi!

 Rolex Rulez 
 Check it, we rock big jew-els an shit, big karats an Baggets an shit. 
 Mutha fuckas be starrin', niggas packin big thangs too nigga 
 Uh. 
 I started off wit heata shit 
 Carry a nine millameter shit 
 Rolex on my wrist 
 Never fuckin' wit Geneve shit 
 (Playboy what's Geneve shit?) 
 Somethin' like 20 g's cheaper shit 
 Tryin' to pawn this shit, but the jewelry store tell you to keep the shit 
 Look juss like a Rollie, but it really ain't Rollie 
 What the fuck you think homie, you walkin' around wit fake Rollie 
 I never knew that swap meets a-wraps could make Rollie 
 The Motra fake Rollie's, yo time an date gone break Rollie 
 The type of shit a thief wont even attempt to take Rollie 
 Go out on a date, start makin' bitches hate Rollie 
 Now pump yo brakes homie 
 Only the ballin qualified can rock the platinum, oyster, in distant 
 Rolex wear outside 
 "Stayin Alive" like Wyclef, gettin' high until my eyes shut 
 Wise steps, hands carrassin my tech 
 Rolex under my sleve nigga 
 To each nigga playa hatin', I make you mutha fuckas bleed quicka 
 I read niggas 
 Look in my eyes an die slowly 
 Meet my four-five 
 Niggas done died fo a Rollie 
 I leave yo chest over yo family outside lonely 
 They died on the stretch an take an ambulance ride homie 
 My four-five told me, that shit that crucify homies 
 If I didn't, got so many down niggas ready to ride fo me 
 Die fo me 
 Eye fo an eye homie 
 That's what you get for tryin' to rob me fo my Rollie nigga 
 Rolex Rulez. 
 Chorus *(Phats Bossalini)* 2x 
 Well an nigga wit the Rolex on 
 You best believe he packin Stretch Armstrong 
 Some kinda gat or thang on him 
 Hit you bullet rain storms 
 When you got the Rolex watch, piece an chain on 
 Listen. 
 To all my real playas 
 Throw yo Rollie's in the sky 
 Wave 'em side to side 
 Then keep yo four-five caulked to ride 
 So many mutha fuckas done died 
 Tryin' to steal a Rolex watch 
 Especially tryin' to steal mines 
 I remember the day I bought my first watch 
 The turfs hot 
 Slangin them birdies, that chirpin juss don't stop 
 Raise niggas off the block who turf hop 
 Juss got my first 5 in the world to check in the jewlery store the first 
 Spot 
 I'm wet 
 Cash the check, grab the tech an jet 
 10 G's in my pocket headed straight to Spence 
 I want my shit all baggets 
 But it cost too much 
 Had to fuck wit somethin' less 
 Ain't tryin' to floss too much 
 A straight gold Presidential 
 No diamonds down the wrist 
 Princess cabezel 
 You know 
 That's small timer shit 
 But fuck that! 
 I got the Rolex, chain an ring that match 
 Stack my scratch, until I got enough green to bring shit back 
 Exchange? Yes! 
 Give up the chain an gain a Rolex 
 Drop some G's 
 It's juss like property so invest 
 An if you ever go broke, don't feel depressed under stress 
 Pawn yo shit, I give you what you paid an not a dolla less 
 That's big timer shit 
 White colla shit, so I jet 
 I see some niggas casin the set 
 Hangin' out by my Lex 
 I grab the mutha fuckin' Tech 9 
 The first time, I get to hear that mutha fucka scream an whine 
 Rolex Rulez! 
 Uh, to all my real playas, nigga, uh. 
 Smoke-A-Lot up in this bitch. 
 Regime shit, uh. 
 Sometimes you gotta floss, sometimes keep that shit up under yo sleve. 
 Haha. 'Cause niggas tryin' to get us. 
 But I keep big heats, nigga. Uh. 
 How many holes you want in yo ass? 
 Blow-blow!

 Blow-blow! 
 Back the fuck up nigga. We do our thang, Rolex Rulez.

 Or you will get flatlined.
