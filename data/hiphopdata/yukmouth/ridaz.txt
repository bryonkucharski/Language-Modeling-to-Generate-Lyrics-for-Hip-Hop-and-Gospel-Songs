 Rootin-tootin, smokin' on blunts wit skunk until a nigga malfunction 
 Get in the coupe and punch it

 From Las Vegas to Delaware on down to there

 Section 8, Smoke-A-Lot'll stay placed in Berlin 
 By the end of 9-8, hell yeah

 Scramblin crack wit niggas who did more years than Geronimo Pratt 
 Killas wit hands on they gats, mutha fuckin' murder fo' hire 
 Mobb attire, pupils dialated, nigga hog tied in barb wire 
 Torture, squeeze a niggas nuts wit plyers 
 Put his place on fire 
 Then escape juss like McGuyver wit the get-away driver 
 Live and direct from the projects that be gated

 Baraccaded the scene, yellow tape and white chalk

 Fuck a write-off

 Deliver 'em a China up inside a Taxi honey 
 Task be lookin' at me funny

 Beat bitches like PMS 
 And flee ridin' a BMX, flippin GA checks at yo set 
 Grab the promoter by his mutha fuckin' neck 
 Don't be fooled by the Rolex! 
 Verse 4 *(DMG)* 
 Who in the mutha fuckin' hell
