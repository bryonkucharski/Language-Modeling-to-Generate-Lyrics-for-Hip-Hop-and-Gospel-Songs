Yes! 
 It's that nigga you Love 2 Hate! 
 Yes! 
 U Love 2 Hate! 
 This the song I dedicate to niggas who love to hate! 
 Look me in my face, I'm that nigga you Love 2 Hate! 
 Yes! (Fire! Fire! Fire!) 
 It's that nigga you Love 2 Hate! 
 Nigga you Love 2 Hate. 
 Stop it. 
 (Ah, ah) 
 Nigga you Love 2 Hate. 
 Nigga, I ain't fake! 
 Before this rap shit 
 I used to slang crack wit ghetto bastards 
 Pack automatic gats an kept scratch up under the mattress 
 Fuck this rap shit 
 Yay wrapped in plastic everyday practice 
 Runnin' away from task tactics 
 Hop fences leavin' 'em ass backwards 
 Before this music 
 I used to be the Ice Cream Man since 1992 biatch! 
 Don't you hear the mutha fuckin' muzik? 
 I got a head but ain't no screws in it, losin it 
 Slangin narcotics, them men two steps away from usin' it 
 Abusin it 
 I moved then it was all bad 
 It seemed like soon as a nigga moved, then it was all bad 
 Because of this music, my whole block double crossed me 
 Got shot in the ass, bra 
 But ain't no love lost see 
 'Cause now I have yo ass off the g's 
 An niggas found off the beach, wit holes up in they body for tryin' to 
 Double cross me 
 I could move across seas, and outta state 
 Smokin' weed 
 Hand yo ass an 8 to smoke to the face 
 Ya still hate nigga. 
 Chorus *(Yukmouth)* 
 'Cause I'm that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Tell yo bitch it's that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Smoke-A-Lot, Regime, nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Album to the face, nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Yes, it's that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Young nigga, wit money, U Love 2 Hate 
 Mutha fuckas lookin' at me funny, U Love 2 Hate 
 Check it. 
 What? 
 Nigga... uh. 
 Is it because I went on tour wit Biggie Smalls? 
 Or is it because yo bitch will to drop to the floor an lick my balls? 
 Or is it because a nigga sky ball, since juvenille hall? 
 To make these niggas straight talk shit, about me in front of they 
 Broads, listen! 
 Or is it because I'm ridin' around in Range Rove's? 
 4 point 6, G-S 400 on dubb mo-mo's 
 An both of my shit's got TV's in 'em, what you don't know 
 What the fuck you grind fo? 
 Juss to pay note to the nine-four 
 I'm ridin' 9-8 shit 
 Is that the reason for all the hatred 
 I flipped Townhouse, you still at mom's house basement 
 Mad, walkin' around tellin' my friends I ain't shit 
 Back when, you used to be that nigga who I smoked my dank wit 
 Rob a bank wit, because I trust you 
 Probably take a slug fo you 
 But now a nigga got no love fo you 
 Nigga! 
 Best friends became enemies for centuries 
 An jealousy juss means you mutha fuckas envy me. 
 Chorus *(Yukmouth)* 
 Hate. 
 It's that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Labled to the face, nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Drugged out, smoothed out, U Love 2 Hate 
 Poppin' Xtacy an shit, nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Uh! 
 I'm that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Tell yo potnas it's that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Playa hate all the time, U Love 2 Hate 
 What? 
 Why you hate me nigga? 
 Uh. 
 Is it because yo bitch love me? 
 Or is because I stay whipped in all the latest rugby's 
 Thugged Out, sippin bubbly 
 "Da Good, Da Bad, Da Ugly", nigga finally livin' lovely 
 Signin autographs 
 Lil kids run up an hug me 
 I'm from where they from, I was raised by crackheads an junkies 
 Highschool flunky 
 Too busy out there tryin' to get my money 
 Hungry, I had to get it myself nobody dishin fo me 
 An now my niggas mad, claim that I ain't dishin fo he 
 But fuck y'all nigga! 
 What the fuck you done fo me? 
 But talk shit behind my back, and try an smoke my weed 
 Or is it because I used to funk wit $hort an Master P 
 Hatin' niggas after me, but now won't capture me 
 Nigga you can't even go gold 
 What the fuck you sold? 
 Five thousand units, nigga my shit went platinum across the globe 
 Or is it because these fake ass hoes claim they got my baby 
 Act shady, an crazy, reverse the game an now them bitches pay me 
 The day a nigga signed wit Prince J 
 Got rid of them other niggas, became my own sensai 
 Smoke-A-Lot, I got to record lable also 
 Phats, L.Q., Maxx, KeKe, my nigga Gonzoe 
 Colloso, cheddar to make the nitros soggy 
 Ridin' Harley's, die smokin' juss like Bob Marley 
 I died in the wide open, at the Mobb party 
 Wit yo eyes open, slugs through yo hard body 
 Pick up 
 'Cause it's that nigga you Love 2 Hate 
 Sincerely yours mutha fucka 
 U Love 2 Hate! 
 Yours truly. 
 Done deal. 
 That nigga you Love 2 Hate
