Welcome! 
 Little boys and girls. 
 Makaveli! 
 (For the love of Makaveli!) 
 Lives forever! 
 (Outlawz!) 
 And ever 
 Come on. 
 Verse 1 *(E.D.I.)* 
 I remember the days we used to 
 Ride together 
 It's goin' on boi, I thought we'd 
 Die together 
 But you left befo' me homie 
 Only if I could talk to you 
 They ain't know, but you walkin' through this life of sin an stuff 
 Two days have passed 
 Since I first heard the shots blast 
 An I can still picture the scenery 
 Won't be no peace fo' me until I see ya at the crossroads 
 All of us back together again 
 Eternally "Lost Souls". 
 Verse 2 *(Napoleon)* 
 I bet I shake ya world 
 Fo' Pac, I'ma drink till I hurl 
 An pump the brakes on the hardest whoever thinkin' they thurrough 
 It's young Napoleon 
 Makaveli gave this soldier his name 
 An if you claim it the same 
 You have to prove you insane 
 Betta get ya heart right 
 In the mist of the warfields 
 Bullets gon' fly by 
 We Outlawz 
 An play the street life because it's paid right 
 It's my life, my life, my life 
 That's in the sunshine 
 Kadafi I'ma hold a sign 
 Hopin you run through one time.

 Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Congregate the Bloods and Cuzz 
 Vice Lords and Disciples 
 I got love fa thugs 
 Even the hoodrats and scrubs that we ducked in the club 
 Sucka for love 
 If I introduce a busta to slugs (what?!) 
 Hustled the drugs 
 We all lust for money and fast cars 
 The, life of a rap star 
 Floatin in Jaguars 
 Then ball wit a bad broad 
 Learn how to stack tall 
 Money longer then Shaq y'all (WESTSIDE!) 
 Holla back y'all! (Yes!) 
 I smoked out wit Redman 
 Aim an infared at the head of a rappa tryin' to make a livin' off a dead man 
 Flossin a dead man 
 I know the drama is reallin 
 They stole every song ya made and owe yo mama some millons 
 Will God's children plese stop wit ya "I can be like Pac!" 
 Raps ya rock 
 Bout, gats and glocks 
 Ya act like Pac 
 Wit all them songs you stole from dude 
 If Makaveli was alive, WE WOULDA RODE ON YOU FOOLS!

 Verse 3 *(Young Noble)* 
 We still callin 
 Everyday ta ya 
 We still believe in ya 
 We still pray ta ya 
 Now e'ry body all on Pac's heels 
 Had to wait till a soldier to die 
 Fo y'all to give him his 
 Hell nah! 
 Outlaw soldiers thug fo life 
 Half a y'all ain't never knew Pac 
 Forget the hype! 
 We used to play box wit him 
 Caulk glocks, an lick shots wit him 
 That was a crazy soldier 
 Yo I miss him 
 Taught a brotha so much 
 In "Thugs We Trust" 
 Still as soft as cream puff 
 Outlawz we "Hit 'Em Up" 
 An "Bomb First" 
 So "Hail Mary" 
 You bail scarry through this "White Manz World" 
 But I never let it bury me

 Smoke some weed 
 You an Pac get high fo me.
