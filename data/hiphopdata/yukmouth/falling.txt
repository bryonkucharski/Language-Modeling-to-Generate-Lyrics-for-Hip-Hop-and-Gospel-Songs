Do or Die in this bitch 
 Yes, do this for my soldiers (Do or Die) 
 What? I've had more up and downs then a rollercoaster (what up yo) 
 Shit but we gon ball again 
 What? If I ever stop falling 
 I got so many hustlin skills they can't fuck wit me 
 Soon as I go broke, the next day I be havin' some paper, I'm that raw 
 Breakin bitches, pullin cases, robbin niggas, selling drugs, 
 Rappin' and shit, whatever I gotta do 
 If I ever ball again, I know just what I'ma do 
 If I ever ball again, I'll never be losin 
 If I ever start fallin', ever start fallin' 
 Someday I'm gon ball again, someday I'm gon ball again 
 If I ever start fallin', If I ever start fallin' 
 But I'm gon ball again, someday I'm gon ball again 
 Nigga, If I stop ballin, dig it, I better be on top again, 
 Drinkin' Henessy on the rocks again 
 Paper choppin 10s and 20s with plenty of bitches up on my jock 
 My friends been born riders since the age of 10 
 I wanted a schwinn so I copped a schwinn 
 I wanted a benz so I copped a benz 
 I wanted to fuck her partner friend so I got 'em up in a menage a trois 
 But the consequence them broads fell in love with each other 
 Left me up out the wind
