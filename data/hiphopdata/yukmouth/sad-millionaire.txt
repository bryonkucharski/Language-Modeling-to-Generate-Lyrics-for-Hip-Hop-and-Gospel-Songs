*(Phats)* 
 All I know... is this Regime shit. 
 Chorus *(Phats, Big Lurch)* 
 I'm juss a thousandaire 
 But pretty soon I plan to be a millionaire 
 Playa hatas best beware! 
 *(Big Lurch)* 
 Don't hate on mine 
 When you want that sim to shine! 
 Don't hate on mine 
 When you want that sim to shine! 
 Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Nigga. Let's do it. 
 I'm tryin' to touch mo' money than Bill Gates 
 But know that 
 When you get the money they will hate 
 Them broads that hang around you wit the ice grill face 
 Be the broads that lay you and take you to an ill place 
 Where the doe at? 
 They know you ballin, 'cause you deal weight 
 You better show that, nigga where the safe is at while you still safe 
 'Cause, niggas will take yo life 
 Probably rape yo wife 
 If they can't say China white, now say goodnight! 
 To the bad guy 
 In a ski mask guy 
 I been gettin' cash guy 
 Ever since my dad died 
 Me and my real boys 
 In Mazda-has 
 Bitches wit, cat eyes feed me lobster y'all 
 If I wanna ride I cop it, dawg 
 If I gotta flip one for my chocolate dawg 
 Juss like we shop at the mall 
 Don't knock it y'all 
 I been ballin since the days of Genesis 
 And Benz's flipped 
 Tinted shit, while you just rentin shit 
 Pretendin it's, yours 
 Drivin' Honda Accord's and Ford Probe's 
 Niggas flossin them hoes 
 My name is known across the globe 
 See me talkin' on shows 
 Rolex rockin' them hoes 
 Knockin' on my door lookin' fo yo bitch, I put the glock to your nose. 
 Verse 2 *(Phats Bossalini)* 
 Blast the blood clot 
 My niggas makin' money non-stop 
 Off the rock 
 Another hundred to cop 
 Fiends blisterin 
 All action 
 We G's wit Mac-10's 
 Co-captian 
 Boss was sworen as a coppo 
 Take bread 
 Live like Macho, push the throttle 
 Jet black seat pushed back in a Diablo 
 Die slow 
 My niggas want it and triffle it 
 Hummer shit 
 Cover my mic 'cause it's priceless 
 Ice this 
 Rolex piece, watch and Jeep 
 Niggas lose sleep 
 Trainin my beasts how to feast 
 Where the broke eat 
 Approach yo block wit guns 
 Cops will come 
 Spread the bread in lumps son 
 My nigga John John 
 He had his head on tight 
 Hit the pipe 
 Now he tweaked, high as a kite 
 I used to shed tears 
 Knew damn deep he didn't care 
 Hope and dreams that was all that's there to be a millionaire. 
 Verse 3 *(Phats Bossalini)* 
 My niggas rock solid 
 Make the money be the object 
 Fuck a colleauge 
 I'm off the clock rockin' dollas 
 See us 
 Peep us 
 It's juss the three of us 
 Me an Yuk, plus Mad Maxx been out to get some. 
 Verse 4 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Feed it up 
 Soon as I get up 
 I got to roll a phat spliff up 
 Smoke till it burn my finger tips an lips up 
 Drinkin' liquor till I get the hic ups 
 Fuck bad bitches then we switch up 
 Fuck bad bitches then we switch up. 
 Verse 5 *(Phats Bossalini)* 
 Watch me shine in my nine-nine custom design 
 Niggas sniffin lines sayin' Boss committed a crime 
 I robbed the bomb shelter 
 Shipped the goods off the delta 
 Task asks if Phats the man wit no replica. 
 Verse 6 *(Yukmouth)* 
 No replica 
 Put the tech to ya 
 Smiff-N-Wesson ya 
 Here's the lesson to be learned, don't test the young Hugh Heffener 
 4 point 6 snatchin up yo bitch 
 An when it comes to mics I wreck this shit 
 Collectin chips 
 Disrespect yo click 
 I come wit real shit 
 From the Village Oak-Town 
 Raised a drug dealer, to be rappin' and stars Mo Town 
 On the low down, I used to blow brown, but now I blow pounds 
 Went from bein ugly as fuck, to havin' hoes now 
 You know now. 
 *(Chorus till end)*
