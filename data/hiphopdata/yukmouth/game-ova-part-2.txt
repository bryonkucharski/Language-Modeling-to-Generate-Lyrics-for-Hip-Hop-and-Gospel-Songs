 (Gonzoe) 
 It's war time, You bitches understand me 
 There's no fist fightin'; on sight I'ma blam you 
 Smash niggas' face with gun handles 
 You know me the definition of the land of the scanners 
 You pose for the camera 
 I carry my own blamma 
 Bury niggas with Chucks on with wooden pyjamas 
 On the hood you square 
 Death is a promise 
 No niggas know you from the jungles to the bottoms 
 'Cause' you had contacts tryin' to GQ model 
 I was born with Pac, in the OE-bottle 
 You're a dick rider 
 Tryin' to fuck with which crews hotta 
 Match your tongue ring to the paint on your Impala 
 You're just another fuckin' clone 
 You maricón 
 Gettin' shitted on 
 For shoes and cell phones 
 You dead wrong, nigga, sayin' Yuk ain't safe 
 From E-1-4 to the Shaws There's a price on your face, you bitch! 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Bitch Nigga! 
 You can't fuck wit us Regime life nigga?! 
 How dare you say Tha Regime on your fake ass skit?! 
 How dare you use "5 on it," you fake ass nigga?! 
 You ain't got no plaques on your wall! 
 You ain't got no money, you bitch! 
 You at yo momma house, you punk! 
 You tongue ring queen! 
 Nigga! 
 You can't fuck with me man! 
 Stay off the internet, you computer thug! 
 You don't want it, nigga! 
 You don't want war, you bitch! 
 (Chorus starts) 
 Joe Budden murdered you! 
 And Yuk gon dead yo ass, nigga! 
 I'ma whack yo bitch ass, punk! 
 You already know how we rock, nigga. 
 You just got your first tattoo 2 years ago, nigga! 
 When JT found you, you were tryin' to be a G-Q model! 
 You thought you was the next LL. 
 Remember!? 
 Remember you was saying that, you bitch?!

 Punk... 
 Fake ass blood...
