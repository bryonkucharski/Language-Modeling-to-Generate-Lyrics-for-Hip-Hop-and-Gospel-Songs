 Uh-oh, uh-oh! 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh! 
 Regime nigga! 
 Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out 
 The Regime up in this bitch! 
 Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out 
 First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out. 
 Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out 
 First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out. 
 Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)* 
 I do this for the 
 Real killas, and drug dealers 
 Affiliated wit Mobb niggas, and blood spillas 
 Put a slug through you tough niggas 
 1-800-Thugs-R-Us 
 No Dragon tattoo on you, nigga 
 No love from us 
 In thugs we trust 
 Niggas get rushed like hot whitend snuff 
 Up yo nose 
 I fuck up yo flows 
 Leave my competition ass froze 
 We tag on they toes 
 I'm as cold as Pocinos 
 Enemies get tied to a pole, blind fold then I unload. 
 Verse 2 *(Tech N9ne of the Regime)* 
 Thugged Out 
 My choppers oblivion 
 Speakin' the opposite of Caribbean in Tropolis 
 Poppin' my z-z in 
 True clocker from welfare recipients 
 Type of a crispy 
 An anamalisitc Tupac-er 
 My race Caristian 
 Jedi rhyme 
 The way I spits ahead of my time 
 Give me a Billboard, an you bet I climb 
 You mutha fuckas 
 I love rukus 
 Thug, makin' you hug crutches 
 Stayin away from you nothin' but bum bustas 
 The empire is back an we bugged out 
 Phats, Keke, Maxx, Poppa L.Q., Gonzoe an my nigga Yukmouth 
 These bitches beggin me to come to Menage 
 A Trios 
 But Muslims hear us say, "hum to Allah" 
 They fly, that's on the crew nigga 
 You cannot block the Regime from makin' knots, no matter what you do 
 Nigga 
 Ya black an blue nigga 
 Undercovers like Malik Yoba 
 Lyrically Nina's usin' a force like Yoda! 
 Verse 3 *(Madd Maxx of the Regime)* 
 Nigga this Madd Maxx 
 You cross the Regime, you get yo life took 
 We get it fuck the good book 
 True thug niggas that turned to real crooks 
 Robbin the microphone, you get yo brain shook 
 I told ya we takin' over soldier 
 A sober niggas rollin' Rover's 
 Me, Ke, Gonz, Yuk, Tech 9, an Phats on ya 
 All ready wit the caulked gage, buggin out Oklahoma 
 Fuck a Corona 
 We drinkin' 8-Balls until we fall out 
 If you got a problem wit the Regime, your souls called out 
 We all out for war 
 These niggas don't want no more 
 I'm takin' over like Michael Jordan 
 An I'm the first to score 
 So fuck you fake ass niggas who be plannin a plot 
 I take yo block over 
 Wit the nitroglycerian rock 
 They got us fucked up. 
 Verse 4 *(Phats Bossalini of the Regime)* 
 They got us fucked up 
 I've been tough 
 Since a young buck 
 Nothin' to prove 
 Lots of pain plus some war cuts 
 It ain't shit, but a thang to me 
 Dangerously 
 I play the man you claim to be 
 Niggas strike back 
 Gun fight, we had to hype back 
 This is the Phats see dream like a Fat Kat 
 They wanna funk, we get dressed in black 
 Caulk the strap 
 Screamin Regime till they bust back 
 It's Mobb-symboly, I die you remember me 
 Tatted wit Dragons in a custom coffin Bently 
 Simply 
 I'm down to blast so don't tempt me 
 I'm hella drunk, an hella blown off the geniti 
 Fuck wit me 
 See these killas in mine 
 Buildin this shrine 
 To feed these fuckin' children of mine 
 Uh 
 Look in my eyes 
 As I bleed the Regime nigga 
 (Regime nigga, Regime nigga) 
 Havin' a pile of money machine. 
 Verse 5 *(Poppa L.Q. of the Regime)* 
 No I've never been to the pen 
 But I did a county bid 
 An I ain't dumb enough to speak on the dirt I've did 
 Guess somebody caught the killer before the police did 
 Find him in the car leakin from dope over split wigs 
 Deadly lyrics to spit 
 Makin' sure the killas feelin' my shit 
 Explicit lyrics an adult content 
 Shot callas representin at all the major events 
 And gang bangin' got the streets juss way too tense 
 I learned to deal wit it 
 I'm in the Fields, windows tinted on my wheel wit the steel in it 
 We keep puffin an rollin' real wit it 
 That jury linin, showcasin our diamonds to benefits 
 Of a long time grindin, enjoyin the fruits of our labor 
 And rented suits from my tailors 
 Some young playas, strivin for greater 
 You know it's all bad 
 Let's make it all good 
 Pushin the Cavvy to touch the Navvi wit the leather an wood 
 It's Regime nigga! 
 Verse 6 *(Yukmouth)* 
 The hardest nigga from the "O" 
 My flow is certified theme music for organized crime 
 Niggas that burglurised banks, and murdered guys for they pies 
 Reach for the sky 
 Techniques like Robert DeNiro in "Heat" 
 Karl Kani's 
 No disguise, in the middle of the street 
 Buckin at police 
 Fuck police 
 Got a Range Rove jeep 
 Wit 12 open faced gold teeth 
 A Rolex piece 
 Cuban Links, crops, an bracelets 
 But that ain't shit, to leave a nigga naked, duct taped wit they bitch 
 In the basement 
 Where the safe is? 
 Big faces 
 Cops raided, but ended up gettin' they fuckin' squad car grenaded 
 You want blazed shit? 
 I spit the nitroglycerian 
 That's smoother than a pair of new cinnamon Timberlands 
 Get Benjamin's 
 But be no P Diddy 
 I'm from a city called Weed City 
 See these Regime niggas be wit me 
 Fuck Christy juss Remmy 
 True thugs do drugs an come up wit hits 
 Like Jimmi Hendricks 
 Shock the world like Snoop at No Limit 
 Yuk signed to Rap-A-Lot, yeah nigga 
 I ain't a playa, I juss mack-a-lot 
 Pack the gat 
 Tryin' to snatch yo watch in the back of the lot 
 Keep my shit for underground fragment rock 
 Jackpot J struck it rich hit the Lottery 
 The top comidity 
 Blood on wallet be from robbin sprees 
 Rock Phat Farm, wit tats all over my arm 
 Bullet wounds like a nigga fresh back from Nam 
 Yo nigga get yo mash on. (echos out) 
 *(Talking)* 
 (How old were you, Mr. Washington when you hit the streets permanatly?) 
 Maybe 10. 
 (How did you live?) 
 I became a runner. 
 (A drug runner.) 
 That's right. 
 (Could you give us a description of how you lived, the next few 
 Years.) 
 I kinda moved up. I lived where the money goes. Then I got busted, 2 and 
 1/2 in ?? 
 (And when you got out.) 
 I got a piece of turf to myself. Took it. One block at a time. Nobody 
 Stopped me.
