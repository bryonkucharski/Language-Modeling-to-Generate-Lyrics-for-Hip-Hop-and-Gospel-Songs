Yes. 
 Yes. 
 My lil shortys gonna be a thug. 
 Father like son, like son like dad. 
 My family all into makin' this cash. 
 Shorty's gonna be a thug. 
 Like father, like son, like son, like dad. 
 My family's all into makin' this cash. 
 My lil, shortys gonna be a thug. 
 Like father, like son, like son, like dad. 
 My family's all into makin' this cash. 
 Look in yo eyes 
 An I see, the reflection of me 
 My little guy 
 Thank the Lord for blessin me wit a seed 
 Before he died 
 My father taught these lessons to me 
 An before I die, I share the same lessons that he was stressin to me 
 Nigga it's in yo blood, you gone be a thug 
 No matter the cause 
 Niggas born to floss, an be the boss 
 That's how he was taught 
 I raised you in the North 
 Away from the hood where, times are hard 
 But as soon as the, grind get hard 
 You put yo time in God. 
 It's in our blood 
 Thuggin' 
 Till the days of my death 
 My last breath taken by the ATF like, David Koresh 
 My steps of life 
 My last testimony, God bless my wife 
 My lil son gone be set for life, always dressed up nice 
 And smokin' Kryponite 
 Might grow up an rip the mic 
 Or slang some chickens like his great grandpappy 
 Whatever makes the man happy 
 Grands snappy 
 But Lord forbid, he try to do the same shit that his pappy did 
 Nigga, end up in some khaki shit 
 Handcuffed, in back of the bus wit a gang of other niggas fucked up 
 Then shipped up, shit greed 
 Shit get deep 
 Niggas bleed 
 Information juss to get free 
 That's why you never see no busta niggas hangin' wit me 
 Be a loner 
 If you ain't got that fuckin' Dragon tattoo on ya 
 Knock a nigga on his ass, so fast the class makes have to use amonia 
 To wake him up 
 Nurse, pick him up 
 An take him up 
 Hit the dice game in the alley way 
 Yo nigga break 'em up. 
 Chorus *(Yukmouth)* 
 Look in yo eyes 
 An I see, a reflection of me 
 My little guy 
 Thank the Lord for blessin me wit a seed 
 Before he died 
 My father taught these lessons to me 
 An before I die, I share the same lessons that he was stressin to me 
 It's in yo blood, you gone be a thug 
 No matter the cost 
 Born to floss, an to be the boss 
 That's how he was taught 
 I raised you in the North 
 Away from the hood where, times are hard 
 But as soon as the, grind get hard 
 You put yo time in God 
 It's in our blood. 
 And send a letter to my killa 
 Whoever it my be 
 I know that death is callin, I can hear it pagin me 
 Chasin me 
 (Ch-ch... haha) 
 Like Jason be 
 But ain't no breakin me 
 Or takin' the safe from me 
 Not even a fuckin' 8 from me 
 Be ready to catch a thirty-eight to the chest straight from me 
 Even if they wasted me 
 My son will be replacin me 
 On the street makin' g's 
 Like his poppy was 
 Smokin' chronic budded 
 Sellin drugs like his poppy does 
 See his poppy was a, mutha fuckin' soldier 
 Hittin figure eights up in Nova 
 Always smokin' doja 
 Wit a pocket full of quarters 
 Went from bein a small timer, to highroller 
 To the block controller 
 Set up shop, an got it locked wit all the rocks an powdered cola 
 Now the cowards know the time 
 Taught you to grind before your time 
 I taught you how to hold a 9 
 Taught you how to stay sharper than a poker prime 
 Nigga focus yo mind, on the money 
 Fuck a big behind 
 An keep a click of down ass niggas, an then you'll be fine 
 These are the rules 
 Nigga choose to utilize or loose 
 Pay yo dues 
 If I die juss get my face tattooed 
 Up on yo shoulder, or right over your heart 
 'Cause, when it get dark 
 That's when this shit starts, an daddy didn't raise no marks!
