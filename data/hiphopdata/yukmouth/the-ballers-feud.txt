Chorus *(Phats Bossalini and Val Young)* 2x 
 That's the Ballers Feud 
 A thug changes, and love changes 
 That's the Ballers Feud 
 And best friends become strangers. 
 Verse 1*(Yukmouth)* 
 Survey says... 
 You know some fake mutha fuckas 
 I know some bustas too 
 This fake mutha fucka been causin rukus in my crew 
 Since '92 
 At first I thought he was cool like Dru 
 Always hollerin the Dangerous Crew, but if you only knew 
 Them niggas don't wanna hang wit you 
 'Cause of the thangs you do 
 Learn a thang or two 
 Talkin' bad bout yo homies, two bitches who juss be framin you 
 Niggas thinkin' bout hangin' you, the game is true 
 Everywhere we go the punk hoo bangin' you 
 Makes it kinda hard for me to swang wit you 
 That's why niggas only hang wit Dru, my pimpydoo 
 Folk-el, smoke out my Range Rove-el 
 What? What? 
 Fuck these broke-els 
 I hate it when niggas be playin' wit yo mail, because they only end up 
 Smoked out 
 Broke as hell 
 Drivin' buckets 
 I'm drivin' luxury cars and plus shit 
 Benz the Lexus the roughest to fuck wit 
 So you wanna be P-I-M-P? 
 You need to get a bitch to fuck you fo free 
 You payin' G's fo pussy. 
 Verse 2 *(Numskull)* 
 There's too many playas 
 Too many ballas 
 Too many hustlas 
 Too many killas 
 Too many pimped out mutha fuckas 
 So now we got the east coast and the west coast feudin to see who's 
 Cleanest 
 The cleanest mutha fucka is the richest and the genius 
 What if you stumbles, like buyin too many houses 
 Wit rims to put on yo shit, too many furry couches 
 Who the mouses nigga, I think you knowin' 
 Sheadin tears from bitches who take yo shit and keep goin' 
 An don't come back, 'cause they done sucked you dick and yo cabbage 
 Got 20 hoes across America livin' lavish 
 Hatin' is juss a hoe thang, yo, I gotta live like that 
 A bitch can roll wit me, or hit the track 
 You can talk about pimpin', you can talk about killin' 
 But when that shit goes down, sound minds will be revealin 
 When you die and comeback, maybe you can try again and beat me 
 But don't try now, 'cause you niggas can't see me 
 22, ready to hoo ride at moments notice 
 First to swang, hittin noses, eyes can't focus 
 Hocus pocus 
 Now 25 niggas on ya 
 Juss because you moved from California 
 Ballers Feud. 
 Verse 3 *(Kastro)* 
 We went from loved ones, on the way up 
 To no love at all 
 Time to go though, so I don't give no fucks at all 
 Cross the game 
 Don't be playin', stoned get right 
 I shed blood wit this, and that can't be gone, overnight 
 This hate 
 Man, could be a cold mutha fucka 
 Close friends, close as cat scan, love 'em like my brother 
 Now I 
 See 'em dyin' like a mutha fucka 
 Slow death, no breath 
 Man I love it like my mother 
 And that's some cold shit, I'm on some mo' swole shit 
 Listen quick 
 Fingers thick 
 Lady clit 
 Piss this shit, on yo clit 
 Niggas know I'm flossin K-Cash 
 Cash foldin 
 You want what I'm holdin', my wife an my life stolen 
 Worse enemy, authority 
 Police are all enemy 
 Richeously, this life fo' me ain't as bad as it seems to be 
 But still in all I love, all I love 
 Take my ten fingers, my ten toes, an mash outta love 
 Do it fo y'all, all y'all 
 My baby girl an God 
 This crazy world like a knife in the heart of my cause 
 Now half part of me hard 
 The other part of me scarred 
 Death wit out health, but still a nigga prayin' to God.
