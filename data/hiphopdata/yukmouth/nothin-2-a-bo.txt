(Feat. Benjilino) 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Haha... I can't believe you niggaz 
 You can't be serious 
 You really thought since 'Pac died the West coast fell the fuck off, huh? 
 You thought since Dre ain't made a album, we flopped? 
 Fuck that shit nigga! 
 Rap-A-Lot for life nigga! 
 Yukmouth nigga! 
 West Coast don nigga! 
 What's wit it punk?! 
 It's nothin' to a boss nigga! 
 We been ridin' on dubb's that spin nigga! 
 We been poppin' bottles, nigga, since 'Pac was alive nigga 
 The West Coast is back you faggot ass fucks! 
 I'm from the West Coast and never-ever crip-walk 
 I'm like the Bird Man, platinum grill, big cross 
 An I'm tryin' to sell a few mill like Kris Kross 
 I'm ultra cocky, tell a chicken get lost 
 Diss the boss an get ya lips ripped off 
 I let clips off 
 Ya whole click soft 
 What you know about a hundred on a wrist watch 
 Twenty on ya chicks watch 
 Loungin Gucci flip flops 
 And I bang in the club like Rick Rock 
 Yuk show you how to rock that real thug hip-hop 
 They ride lo-lo's 
 Yukmouth flip drops 
 Off the floor every year is a whip hop 
 Menage-a-trios all year if ya chick jock 
 With ten karats in my ear like big shot 
 Godzilla get the scrilla like Chris Rock 
 An I'ma bring the West back when my shit drop 
 (Chorus - Benjilino) 
 To roll around on 24's 
 Wit plenty millions in a vouge 
 Everything a nigga want... 
 It's nothin' 2 a boss! 
 So much ice a nigga froze 
 Custom rides wit 310's 
 Until I die it's all West coast 
 It's nothin' big to a boss! 
 Yeah... if you gon' do it, do it right 
 I'm in the blue and white 
 Rally striped Vipe leavin' Peanuts wit a crew of dykes 
 Tuesday night I got my game together 
 I'm dangerous fella 
 My rims spin like plane propellers 
 An I'm down wit Prince James forever 
 Rap-A-Lot fo' lia (life) 
 Yukmouth, Scarface an Tela 
 And y'all know Yuk is off the meter 
 For all you non-believers 
 I spark the heater 
 I'm what you call a block leader 
 Why you hatin'? 
 I roll through ya radio station wit Gary Payton 
 In a franchise Lac outside on cherry Dayton's 
 An rock the new blue Burberry 
 Make every nation feel the thug vibration, uh 
 My cars talk back like Michael Knight 
 I got a hunderd on a Roy Jones and Tyson fight 
 You wanna roll wit baller, well tonight's ya night 
 I rock ice cause the price is right 
 Step it up hater. Yeah 
 To roll around on 24's 
 Wit plenty millions in a vouge 
 Everything a nigga want... 
 It's nothin' 2 a boss! 
 So much ice a nigga froze 
 Custom rides wit 310's 
 Until I die it's all West coast 
 It's nothin' big to a boss! 
 Every day I'm poppin' a bottle, and poppin' a tag 
 Fourty G's in a Gucci bag, I'm coppin a Jag 
 Two-hundred G's in a Louie bag, I'm coppin a pad 
 Wit the dragon shaped tool in the bag 
 What you know about that?! 
 What you know about chronic an Hypnotic 
 Coppin Lamborghini's from 310 an Simbalic 
 Drop stretch Hummers, twenty-four inch rims on it 
 ??? Skin interior wit the suede trim on it, wait! 
 I came in the game wit mobsta tales 
 I hit Mr. Chow's for meals, crack lobster tails 
 At the mall wit a model who only buys Chanelle 
 You wish I fell, but I prevail, Yukmouth is ill 
 I rock the 'Wheels of Fortune' like Pat Sajack 
 In a black Maybach 
 I'm tryin' to bring the Bay back 
 In a A's throw back and a A's hat 
 Yuk a beast, and bleach couldn't fade that! 
 What?! 
 To roll around on 24's 
 Wit plenty millions in a vouge 
 Everything a nigga want... 
 It's nothin' 2 a boss! 
 So much ice a nigga froze 
 Custom rides wit 310's 
 Until I die it's all West coast 
 It's nothin' big to a boss!
