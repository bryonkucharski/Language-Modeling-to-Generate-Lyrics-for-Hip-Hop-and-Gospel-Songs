Me and You 
 (Daz) And you know that 
 Me and You 
 (Daz) 
 Who can fade it, two assassins up on the mic 
 Blastin', askin' no questions, when they catch you in a gunfight 
 Kaboom! We still mash as a team 
 As we mash for our dreams, ? hood niggaz for green 
 It's Dillinger, fulfillin, makin' a low outta killin' 
 Pullin' scandalous ? fulfillin fantasy dreams 
 Catch me on a Costa Rica, with an island full of weed 
 Money and bitches, on a boat for Sweden 
 (Numskull) 
 See when I'm yellin' 
 International help me 
 No colorlines on my 
 Ugly and fine 
 You can sell me 
 I'm glad folks think the same way as I do 
 'Cause I stab bitches way down in the Bayou 
 Would you make way for two mo' 
 Fo' blows, like you have hoes 
 Stamp a nation wide through the ghetto 
 Fore youngsters, Hennesy sponsors 
 With fore youngsters on a 
 Quarter of the map now I do 
 (Daz) 
 I spin mayor loot and khaki suits 
 Nike's and cripsacks, 
 Wetsuits and leather boots 
 I block niggaz twice with thighs 
 Buck with a .45 
 Make you open while you blast at the parking lot 
 (Numskull) 
 What you speakin' on 
 Wanna go through it 
 Drink a lot, made from fluid 
 Scrump bitch, don't you hear the music 
 My buddy, Daz Dilly and Numskull 
 You will be thanked 
 With you're petty pang petty 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 To all my niggaz... and all my bitches 
 Throw your motherfuckin hands in the air 
 And if you don't give a fuck 
 Like we don't give a fuck then 
 Throw your motherfuckin hood up in the air 
 (Kurupt) 
 Check it out 
 No bitch ass niggaz, no funny ass hoes 
 Dogg Pound Gangstas drippin' in low-lows 
 You ain't all about the homies 
 You besta check the fault 
 Pencils, playin' niggaz in the crowd style 
 Thinkin' 'bout the row outta town 
 With the heater cock bust a million rounds 
 Dogg Pound international's breakin off fools 
 While the dock can bust 
 The facility touch 
 (Yukmouth) 
 I laid this game down 
 Jumped around and kissed myself like I was James Brown 
 Spin around and hit the splits on the ground 
 Split your motherfuckin crown 
 Turn this ifs into pounds 
 Dogg Pound live around, 
 Niggas hittin' the ground 
 Fuck around and get shot up 
 I tear shit up 
 You can ask Puff 
 Lil Cease, Mary J. B. and Jodeci 
 About that nigga Yuk 
 Means the hardcore 
 Got kicked off tour 
 For piss marking on the hotel floor 
 (Kurupt) 
 G riders, We ride, DP ride 
 Get the mashin niggaz 
 Or the mat see automatic, 
 Get the blastin niggaz 
 Shakin nigga, bankin nigga 
 Quit the heater 
 Stop blankin niggaz 
 (Yukmouth) 
 I'm danked out 
 Surrounded by weed smoke 
 You See me and my niggas in the club, 
 Thugged up, suited in steet clothes 
 We roll, cut dough 
 Cause weed so 
 On triple gold, see hoes 
 With weed with me and my amigo 
 (Knumbskull) 
 Who did that, who shitted 
 Who spoke on the ghetto values, 
 Who supa-dupu fly 
 I catored to the pimps, players, hustlers and bastards 
 (Kurupt) 
 Why don't you meet me over in the O, Homie 
 'Cause when I get there, 
 The hoes will be all off on me 
 I know y'all got a gang of bitches... 
 (Daz) 
 ...Ha, ha 
 And like fabulous thangs and livin' life expensive 
 In nights machine dippin' 
 With a pocket full of c-notes 
 Cruise the block with a 9 lookin' for weed-o 
 And oh yeah, who got the gangsta shit 
 Daz and Kurupt, Numskull, Yuk for shit bitch 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Known as your playa potna 
 Slain ice cream fools and (?) 
 Rockin' Hilfiger just like kadada 
 I walk around the house of rockwilder, 
 Just like a mobster 
 The O-A-K bust and throw it away 
 Hoop out the roof down in LA 
 And then go aloof 
 Opps! and make a nigga spooked 
 With a couple of screws loose 
 And find your homie 
 Sweatin, buck naked locked up in a chicken coop 
 Why? 
 Livin' that destroy all arts 
 Zark, and blast a homes 
 Pull back and grab your mothafuckin heart out your chest 
 If you tested the best like David Koresh 
 Get ready to be 
 Reincarnated in the motherfuckin flesh 
 Yes yes
