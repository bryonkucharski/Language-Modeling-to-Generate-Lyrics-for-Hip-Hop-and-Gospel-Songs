 Check it!

 Chorus *(Fa Sho)* 
 I am a dope fiend an 
 (The ice cream factory) 
 I need my drugs 
 I bought 'em from the Ice Cream Man 
 (In '98, posted up, posted up) 
 He's my neighborhood thug 
 I know I need to stop, but 
 I say no 
 (Slang crack) 
 'Cause I'm a dope fiend an... I need my drugs! 
 Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Nigga. 
 First you cut the stove up 
 450 degrees farienhiet 
 Mix the bakin soda wit the China white 
 Sugar delight, Puruvian flake crack rock 
 Playa fill the pot up wit water, put the pot on the stove to make it hot 
 Then rock it up 
 Place the caviar in a jar full of boilin water, then shake it up 
 That's how I rock it up 
 Presice, before I chop it up 
 I sell it 
 My dope fiend test the product to see if I got the stuff 
 Packin gats incase I gots to bust 
 My cousin rode off in the wind wit two chickens, ever since then no 
 Nigga I can trust 
 Plus, family an business don't click 
 'Cause family members try to play you like a bitch 
 I'm quick to pistol whip this shit outta niggas like this 
 My niggas from the Vill killin' each other, go to jail an turn snitch 
 Like a bitch 
 Me, I slang double ups, half thangs an zips 
 Blueprints on how to bubble up, have thangs an grip 
 Digital triple beam at my lab 
 Breakin down slabs an bump a zipper 
 Nigga 28 grams wit the bag 
 Fuck it 
 Drop Jag or a Cutlass 
 My ice cream truck be the toughest. 
 Chorus *(Fa Sho)* 
 I am a dope fiend an 
 I need my drugs 
 I bought 'em from the Ice Cream Man 
 Well, he's my neighborhood thug 
 I know I need to stop, but 
 I say no 
 'Cause I'm a dope fiend an... I need my drugs! 
 Verse 2 *(007of the 5th Ward Boyz) 
 I scream 
 You scream 
 We all scream for ice cream 
 Trippin' out these dope fiends 
 Bringin' back all kinda things 
 TV's, camcorders, VCR's, stereos 
 Beepers, cell phones, any thing they get they hands on 
 Nigga I don't want this shit 
 Bring me back some cash 
 Even dope fiend bitches try to get it for some ass 
 Bitch I don't want no pussy 
 I don't want no head 
 I see they drapped the preist, creepin', violation the police. 
 Verse 3 *(E-Rock of the 5th Ward Boyz) 
 See we Mobb figgas 
 Coke dealas 
 7-4-7 straight to Oak-Town hit 'em up wit Yuk now 
 Yola snatchers 
 Made money, go-getters 
 Blood elapse ya 
 Turn around an pimp slap ya 
 I'ma make you love me bitch 
 Wit the cock or the rocks 
 Stockin up the million dolla spots 
 Rollin' in ah 
 Candy coated '98 big body Tahoe 
 Plenty dope smokers. 
 Verse 4 *(Lo Life of the 5th Ward Boyz)* 
 All I need is one bird 
 An I won't turn back 
 An I'm show you how to turn this tough, turf-Town white powder to crack 
 An I keep my clip clacked, so 
 Please don't try an jack 
 In the midst of the transact, I found where the dope fiends at 
 I over react 
 After midnight, while sellin my cream 
 A dope fiends dream is to follow me, while, smokin' out a screen 
 I drive by in my ice cream truck 
 Wit fiends run up 
 I got 'em touchin for the good stuff 
 White colored and blue 
 I got yo drugs! 
 Verse 5 *(Yukmouth)* 
 I got yo drugs 
 Heron, infedamines an crack 
 Fiends get jacked 
 Fiends get slapped 
 Fiends that rap 
 They got me back an fourth 
 I'm tryin' to shake the state 
 Bakin cakes 
 Razor blades 
 Kragen plates 
 Busta niggas they can hate 
 Slangin major weight 
 Thousand grams is a key 
 Outta town a pound of boogie brown cost a G 
 So I send it down 
 Couple a rounds, never lost to P 
 Never lost a G 
 Mutha fuckas never crossin me.
