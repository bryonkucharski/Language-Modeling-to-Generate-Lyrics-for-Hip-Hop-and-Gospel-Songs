 (Messy Marv) 
 I'm still out there my nigga you can't tell 
 Still at the kitchen table cuttin' down coke to sell 
 Still ??? still conduct business through a beeper 
 With the block under my sneakers 
 I'm still in it still rappin' still winnin' 
 Still hit the damn spot 300 I'm still spinnin 
 Still rock the mock in lenin 
 Still up the block hop out and be like 
 Yo young nigga still in the beef 
 We ride the high shit we still in the streets 
 All the gangs still come from the west 
 I'm still sendin a bitch and shoot shit 
 'Cause that muck still on my back man still gotta have it 
 Still the shit and pee pee on you faggots 
 We still unda the sun 
 Ask Dre Yuk and Numb take over my nigga 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 Yeah put us back on the map bitch 
 We put crack on the map 
 Dope fiends get slapped with a bat 
 Bitch niggaz get capped with a gat 
 Let them know where they at 
 Back to back benz's and Lac's 
 Real macs bitches on tracks 
 Real thugs get riches of crack 
 While the snitches get whacked 
 Let the know where they at 'cause 
 (Yukmouth) 
 The home of the crack owners since operation stackover 
 I've been slappin cowards with the strap holder 
 Roll with the mob and get mashed over 
 You got to find your slabs of coke from me 
 The Flower boys the metro boys nigga 
 The Richmond boys the Frisco Boys nigga 
 Sniffin boys shiftin boys click go get embroiled 
 We ride old school two's and vogues 
 We ride 2002s on hoes, and the shoes is old 22s 
 Infoced all on a bitch and we use to lose them hoes 
 Dippin yokin in the strips of oakland sippin smokin' bitches scopin 
 Wrists is glowin' mouth platinum even when my shit was golden 
 Yukmouth been the shit with flowin 
 OAKLAND stand up, wave the grams up 
 Get the keys to atlanta and hook fam up 
 In the lam truck I'm the boss like 
 Tony danza with the police scanner 
 (Mac Dre) 
 Runnin' from the blacks and whites 
 On hubcaps and whites 
 Slangin sacks at night down to the sight 
 The Bay Area more than cleavit 
 Ball capped ace dudes gold teeths 
 From fillmore to the V to the CCC (country club Crestside) 
 Pimp niggaz play bitches like mp3 
 Land of the nate shrimp and champagne 
 Fat dank blunts fresh off the plane 
 Homie of the VGF and commie 
 Messy marv, mac dre and the Luniz 
 And Vallejo there's hundreds of sales 
 Young niggaz slangin rock from the lunch pail 
 Mel got me driftin yokin and dippin 
 In the car from the 60s when I steer 
 Boy I'm goin' to yok at come out here 
 You might not go back 
 (Knumbskull) 
 I've been dope since Felix, blew weed before 5 on it came 
 And gave the whole world to me, the pay roll to regime 
 Is how the world should be 
 All make music niggaz wish they could be 
 Like numb like yuk like marv like dre gettin' loaded everyday 
 The Bay got an image that took years to earn 
 Don't come here to bullshit come here to learn 
 You think niggaz separated come see the other 
 It's three money makin' niggaz fuckin' with each other 
 I've did it with dre like we some bloods and crips 
 Better know it the Bay is on some hustlin shit 
 Who pimp like the Bay, I never seen us sippin the Bay 
 All I know is gettin' chips in the Bay 
 This Yuk this Marv this Dre I'm Knumb 
 Represent the Bay nigga FUCK WHERE YOU'RE FROM
