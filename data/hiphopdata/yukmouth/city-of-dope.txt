Gather 'round, gather 'round, hurry 
 Uh, welcome! uh, little boys and girls 
 Listen, I'm bout to lace y'all motherfuckers 
 About Oakland, the City of Dope 
 The first place in the world to ever sell base rock 
 Nigga, crack rock, they put it there to get rid 
 Of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin 
 What, what, nigga 
 Me and my niggas trying to ride drop 
 Buy rocks then we buy blocks 
 From the same dope fiends on my block who buy rocks 
 Want supply hot 
 Weight servin' cakes like IHOP 
 Ever since them last motherfuckers got shot 
 Police been hot on my spot 
 Spot cops FBI watch 
 Got fiber-optic shit up in the pole 
 Showing my whole clique on crime watch 
 We let non-stop and show our faces 
 So what the case is 
 We wide on TV but still the grind don't stop 
 Nigga this Oakland, the city of dope 
 You know where that crack shit was invented 
 And smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago 
 On Plymouth street we call the block 
 Plymouth Rock 
 The first place like the world to ever sell base rocks 
 Now check it, 
 The legendary Phoenix Mitchell put it down 
 So tough they had to make a movie about the town 
 But called it Nino Brown 
 That bullshit New Jack City 
 Is really based upon this place we call Crack City 
 Oakland, Cali we act shitty 
 Think crack's the answer 
 To get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers 
 Smokin' blow and takin' (???) like Jo-Jo Dancer 
 Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control 
 Like Tony Montana 
 House in Atlanta 
 3-car garage 
 Our ghetto superstars was hard 
 Young niggas touch a mil-ticket 
 Before they life behind bars 
 Niggas get caught with like eighty kilos 
 Hidden in the wall 
 But shit ain't hidden at all 
 From these cocaine sniffin dogs 
 Same with the law 
 Shit in your draws when they get your ass 
 And let the ballers ball, get the cash 
 Till they get to your ass 
 I've never seen a baller fall on his knees 
 And snitch so fast 
 Plea bargain run after them niggas 
 That hang out with your ass 
 No wonder why that bitch-ass nigga got out 
 So quick, so fast 
 Came on the block my niggas saw you 
 Choppin' it up with task 
 Now that's a violation 
 Nigga can't chop it up with task 
 So while the trial awaits 
 Some nigga walks up and pumped his ass 
 Because the niggas in the O are hard as fuck 
 We sell peruvian flake, get it powdered, or rocked up 
 Don't want nothin' from life but to retire from the game 
 Motherfuckin city of cocaine, 
 City of dope 
 East Oakland, yeah that's right 
 The city of dope 
 East Oakland, yeah that's right 
 Them task folks can't stop us 
 High school niggas get caught with a hundred G's 
 Stashed in his locker along with a chopper 
 Niggas be ballin like a doctor, or a surgeon 
 M.C. Hammer splurgin' 
 He bought up countless brand new helicopters 
 And suburbans, now he hurtin' 
 The feds spilled they base downtown 
 So now its curtains 
 Niggas be perpin' off 
 Certain it's gon' be a sweep 
 Dope feind came through last week 
 Told me it's gonna be a sweep 
 1991's the number nigga 
 End of the summer 
 Niggas ain't ridin' no fuckin' hummers 
 We ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder 
 I wonder, wonder what they would do 
 To a nigga who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder 
 Straight from Humboldt county, fuck that brown 
 Weed all should be green like the jungle 
 Dope fiends tryin' to warn us 
 Settin' up scene still in a bundle 
 We beat they ass and drag them from they hair 
 Just like repunzel 
 Don't fuck up our hustle 
 But anyway the day came just as predicted 
 I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin' early morning pissin' 
 Pulled down my britches, and a nigga almost shitted 
 I heard somebody walkin' on the roof 
 I cocked the fo-fitness 
 Woke my cousin Mike up 
 Could be some niggas sent to strike us 
 Cause back then so many niggas didn't like us 
 Looked out the window, all I saw 
 Was FBI and snipers 
 I let the china white flush 
 And put that motherfucking 4-5 up 
 See the dope fiend he informed us 
 Told us it's gonna be a sweep and then 
 He tried to warn us 
 But niggas out here try to make they money 
 So we 'nourmous 
 Then only a battering ram 
 Bustin' down your shit, 'nourmous 
 Highway patrols, 5.0's, ambulance and coroners 
 In case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance 
 By 9:00 they lock down each baller from every corner 
 From north to west on down to east Oakland California 
 But, but, them niggas from the O is hard as fuck 
 We sell Peruvian flake powder or get it rocked up 
 Want nothing in life but to retire from the game 
 With some change in the city of cocaine, 
 East Oakland, yeah that's right 
 City of dope 
 East Oakland, yeah that's right 
 City of dope
