Intro (Hussien Fatal): 
 ***Gun loaded and cocked**** 
 Y'all niggas throwin' ice cream, I'm throwin' hot shit 
 (Hussein Fatal) 
 Hussein, run a gank on ya, shank ya, buck 
 Then slit ya throat and drip blood on my ankle ??? 
 We gone ride for this, my niggas die for this 
 See I'm hurtin' my dogs got twenty-five for this 
 Seizure done, I run wit' Outlaw Warriorz 
 Tryin' ta B-I-G, just not Notorious 
 Frost the brick to get you niggas off the dick 
 Gotta chain out cha range and my cross is sick 
 Murda incorporated, of course ya hate it 
 Outlawz inforce the hate, you get cross created 
 From the Clair to North Bricks, that's why I talk slick 
 When I'm hungry, I try ta chop a half and get off quick 
 Shut down Junior MAF, Mobb Deep, Insane 
 You got beef with thiza, muthafuckas speak my name 
 Keep the burnas, muthafuckas sleep wit burnas 
 When I catch you nigga course you gone eat the burna 
 (Napoleon) 
 I've been bruised, battered and burned, lost in turf 
 And I've been ridin' since the cemetery claimed they dirt 
 I love that they hurt, these mark niggas, Outlawz rush niggas 
 Turn him to the side before they ass'll get crunk nigga 
 Head rush that fag ass nigga clinked Napoleon 
 Send a kite to Puffy tell 'em Pac said it's on again 
 Shoot ????? ????? in the dark in Jerz with the blood and sharks 
 Fuck the mark, there's only one Napoleon, It's me 
 Standing here strong, in a dressing room wit a tech on me 
 Ride on whoever next to me, Outlaw War, layin' 'em on the floor 
 Like the after party '99 Source Awards, I swear to the law 
 They jealous that we mash for more, I'm tryin' to ride snakes hand 
 Shake, smile and move, fuck the law, they jealous that Moonie 
 Bought a eight-fitty, a million'll send some hot shit through they panties 
 We ride nigga, it's hard 'cause they hide nigga 
 And matter fact we gone surprise some niggas... Outlawz 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Fake ass, soldier niggas wannabe Yuk 
 Y'all niggas scared severely

 But what... (It's a suicide)

 (Young Noble) 
 From Jersey City to Cali we startin the ruff 
 Representin both sides wearin camoflauge cloth 
 I'm in a line up like what ?????, Outlawin' up 
 Hog tiein' 'em up, Yuk what the fuck these niggas is weak 
 Nobility in the winter niggas feelin' the heat 
 I got this Outlawz across my belly, never surrender 
 If you cross Tha Don Makaveli we gone kill you 
 Or some lil nigga that ain't never met Pac 
 Who wanted revenge, he felt like Pac was his pops 
 A thug father, the lil nigga was young 
 Outlawz representin' ain't huggin' a slump 
 Hold my gun tight aim it at my enemy nigga 
 Say goodbye to your kin, you ain't feelin' me nigga 
 Its gone be done quick, see that you in Jepordy nigga 
 Two shots to the head you can run if yo figure 
 (E.D.I.) 
 Young Noble, we still gone ride... 
 I still sit and pray y'all, yeah y'all when we hustle 
 Can't a muthafucka touch you when the law love you 
 And we praise 'em waitin' for our chance to burn 
 Muthafuckas greedy bankin' but here's yo' chance to learn 
 Stuck in a can of worms, bad terms and all 
 Fuck it, we smash burn the ball, you heard the call nigga 
 Outlawz echo deep muthafuckas can't sleep 
 Comin' outta every jeep bitch peep this 
 Your man wasn't shit and neither is you 
 And if you think I'm actin' tough we pumpin' three into you 
 Newborn thugs (**humf**) can't hold weight but still 
 Lallygaggin in the game made room for the real 
 I see ya crew in the field, I pick 'em off easy 
 Have ya momma at the funeral queezy believe me 
 Half of you fag niggas is part time ridahs 
 Some of the time killas, wit all of the time squealaz 
 Repeat Hook 1 
 Hook 2 (Yukmouth):

 But what... (It's suicide) 
 My nigga... (We gone ride) 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Bitch we gone ride 
 Thug Lord in this bitch 
 Regime shit nigga... 
 Yuk plays and they call the fuckin' fire marshal 
 Supply the arsenal with thug shit, ice sparkle (bling) 
 The Phantom Menace take a slaughterer like Darth Maul 
 Burn 'em like charcoal, call me Draco, untouchable 
 Remarkable, drink a whole bottle of Remy and wobble 
 My clique follow, ain't no fair squabble (Regime Life!) 
 These skinny niggas don't fight light 'em up with hollows 
 Desperado got blood on the bottles make a nigga swallow 
 A bitch don't like Benny Blanco, for the crotch yo 
 Let my cock go, I let the glock blow for chedda like nachos 
 Recognize the Mob like HBO Sopranos 
 Niggas get played like pianos, dirty rotten scandal 
 Inner city plan'll scramble, wit a hundred ki-s and ammo 
 Get niggas handled, light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
 The Thug Lord has arrived wit desciples in sandals 
 Ridin' camels way across the land, supplyin' the vandals 
 My rhymes dismantle, click at foes, niggas say I act like Pac 
 Bitch nigga I don't rap like Pac, I just get dat like Pac 
 Bring the west back like Pac, make a nigga gack a glock 
 Ride strapped like Pac, but the raps I rock is all original 
 Y'all pitiful, niggas makin' millions on bitein shit 
 I get in it yo, break 'em off critical, the criminal 
 Lyrical, miracle, make niggas lose rap and turn spiritual 
 Repeat Hook 1 and 2 x2 until fade
