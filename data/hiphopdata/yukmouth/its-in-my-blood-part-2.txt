 Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Regime life 
 Shit trife nigga 
 Slangin China white at night 
 Get light nigga 
 2 point 2 pounds of white 
 My shit tight nigga 
 What yo grip like? 
 Ship like a half a million when I'm fuckin' wit mics 
 Bustin' on mics 
 Wit 5 mics to back it 
 Kick the acrofacts on the cracks while my nigga D flip it backwards 
 Regime killas nigga 
 The captain 
 The king of crack and still rappin', bubble up makin' moves 
 You niggas still jackin 
 That's why I'm livin' ill, steel packin 
 Dive on top of niggas and feel like Action Jackson, wit my 9 mill 
 Blastin 
 A real assassin, juss invite me to your mansion homie 
 I bet a nigga'll come back that same night as a mask man demandin money 
 Pandamony 
 See my fam is hungry 
 Eat a can of phony emcees, then dump they ass in San Antoni 
 'Cause niggas bologney like Oscar Myers 
 Mobb attire 
 Makin' cops retire the way I, hurdle over barber wire 
 Fence this 
 I pimp shit 
 Relentless 
 The Guinness Book World Record holder, for fuckin' over the most bitches 
 Regime shit, the thug preachable 
 Individual-ly, put niggas faces up on the obituals 
 I was taught to get the doe 
 It's In My Blood since I was crawlin on the rug 
 And pops was in the kitchen rockin' up drugs 
 Yes sir! 
 Back then, I knew who I was, a thug 
 And still a thug until they make me feel the slugs nigga 
 It's In My Blood!
