*(Yuk)* 
 Uh, uh, ah. Uh-huh 
 What? Where my ladies at? 
 Uh. Where my ladies at? 
 Let's do this... uh, Menage A Trios style. 
 It's the 90's, and regular sex is played out. 
 I need two women, at one time! 
 One time! 
 Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)* 
 What? 
 Uh. 
 Let's take it back, to the day we first met 
 I see you and your girls buyin purses 
 Lookin' like two Miss Universe's 
 Make a nigga wanna curse "Shit!" 
 Who them two bitches, let me go spit a couple of verses, see if I can 
 Work it 
 I dropped some money on purpose 
 You picked it up, an said "I dropped some" 
 Stop frontin you can tell from my watch that I got somethin' 
 An that I squat somethin' nice, pop somethin' nice 
 Up in the air so elegant 
 You can tell I pimp but that's irrelavent 
 An I can tell by the way you and yo girl hang tight 
 That y'all be doin' y'all thug thang at night 
 Somethin' like dikes 
 Ain't nothin' like... two girls makin' love to each other 
 Ain't nothin' like... two girls bustin' nuts up on each other 
 Ain't nothin' like... two girls at the club, rubbin on each other 
 Ain't nothin' like... two girls kissin' and huggin on each other 
 Ain't nothin' like... two girls juss suckin on you like a sucka 
 Ain't nothin' like... 'cause we fuckin' each other, in a Menage A Trios. 
 Chorus *(Kira)* 2x 
 Can we get freaky tonight? 
 I want you and your girl to come by 
 I like to do Menage A Trios 
 I like it when you do me, do me. 
 Verse 2 *(Tela)* 
 Me and you Menage A Trios 
 Bring along another star 
 Drinky drinky at the bar 
 We can freak it in the car 
 You know how we do it ah 
 You got to influence her 
 Let her know which two of us 
 Me and you, and her and Yuk 
 You want me to set it up 
 Get that pussy wet it up 
 Bitch you betta shut it up 
 There won't be no lettin up 
 You know what's ahead of us 
 Video tape, no editors 
 I be the executive 
 Producer while y'all sex it up 
 Kissin' up, put the pissin up 
 Pussy like that gotta switch it up 
 I know what's like dickin up 
 Dildos 
 Ticklers 
 Pickin' lips, ridiculous 
 Gotta get a lil mo' sick wit us 
 Bout this time I'm bout to bust 
 Spend up shit like steaky luck 
 Damn you know this cock is hot 
 But you know what's really hot 
 Bitch you fuckin' Rap-A-Lot 
 And this shit will never stop 
 For all my dawgs, I'm gettin' y'all in here 
 Menage A Trios, and enjoy yourself, come on, uh! 
 Spend the night wit me 
 I'll spend the night with you 
 Ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh 
 (Spend the night!) 
 Spend the night wit me 
 Don't care what we do 
 Juss as long as I'm with you. 
 Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)* 
 Now we can kick it in my 4 point 6 
 Bangin' "It's All On A Bitch" 
 You lickin' my dick, wit yo ass up in the air she lickin' yo clit 
 Now that's the shit 
 You wonder why they call me Hugh Heff 
 'Cause I keep two chicks 
 Runnin' around butt naked in my duplex 
 Screamin who's next 
 Yup in this life that I'm livin' 
 I can't escape I'm in love wit two women 
 Swimmin in two women at once 
 Or I can relax, juss hittin on blunts 
 While y'all lickin' on cunts, get shit crunk 
 I visioned it once, then tweedle-dum I'm in a threesome 
 Wit me some bad chicks, hungry fo dick so I'ma feed 'em 
 We some fools off the cool 
 Gone off Xtacy and mushrooms in the room 
 I can do it slow, or I can room-a-zoom-zoom... BOOM! 
 Into that pussy like a bullet wound 
 Put on my Fruit of the Looms 
 And then I creep out the room 
 (Ooh!) 
 'Cause if you baby daddy find out what we doin' you doomed 
 I'm out, so I'm out! 
 Spend the night wit me 
 I'll spend the night with you 
 Ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh 
 (Spend the night!) 
 Spend the night wit me 
 Don't care what we do 
 Juss as long as I'm with you. 
 *(Freak talking)* 
 Look check it out Yuk

 You know? (Girl I like it too, shit) 
 You know, doin' it wit you is cool, but umm... wit yo girl it juss makes 
 Things twice as good, she's better. 
 Umm-hmm
