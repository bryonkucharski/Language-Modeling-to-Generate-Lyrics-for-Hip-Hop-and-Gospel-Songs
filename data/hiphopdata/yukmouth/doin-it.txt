Strange Music 10 years in the makin' 
 Hey man, this feel like I'm in Miami, Florida, man 
 But reppin' Kansas City at the same time 
 Yukmouth, Chillest Illest 
 Yo, Tech N9ne! Ome, let's go! 
 I'm doin' it! 
 I can do anything go shop 
 Buy fly high no lookin' back 
 I'm doin' it! 
 Take a trip everyday 
 Livin' life all paid build an Empire State 
 I'm doin' it (doin' it) 
 I'm doin' it (doin' it) 
 I'm doin' it (doin' it) 
 Buy low, sell high! 
 Euro, pounds, crowns, get dough 
 Red Light District, hoes in the window 
 At the Green House blowin' on the indo 
 (?) At a room and the cab is the Benzo 
 Yo, then I'm on to the next 
 Jigga Man style (?) on a jet 
 High above 20 inch on a (?) 
 Got hoes on deck, got a home on my neck 
 Yup, wrist flooded in cruise ship 
 Two chicks, I'd have pop it like Whoo Kid 
 Shut 'em all down, no brand new shit 
 (?) Bitch I do's this 
 What? I get brain (?) 
 The Last Train to Paris 
 Like Diddy for them benjies 
 Black stones and a chain, black Bentley 
 All black everything flat in the frisbee

 All about my paper I'm serious like an emergency 
 Some of y'all ain't heard of me but I'm about to fix that 
 (?) 
 And no I don't pay rent partner I pay mortgage 
 Oh yeah I'm doing that 
 Sold out shows Nina make 'em go nuts 
 They get the dough cut, splittin' hella O's up 
 Close up to show rush to go to lust 
 Vegas (?) doin' for much 
 Cold days in Missouri can't stand them 
 So I take the family to Saint Martin just to tan 'em 
 Kickin' at random beaches then when I land (?) 
 Wife and kids in the Phantom 
 Real Caribbean flow to amphibious 
 Go to Disney and (?)

 Why she all up in mine? I'm Tech N9ne 
 And gettin' mo' checks, my life is so jet 
 I got a Mercedes Benz I ain't drove yet

 Haters want me to ruin and never stop the Nina 'cause it's 
 Full traffic escorts 
 New market passports 
 We're closing airports

 Okay this means we through doin' it now 
 This was the mixed plate 
 Now I'm 'bout to go to Gates and get me a president's tray 
 Y'all know what I mean, ha-ha-ha

 I don't care what nobody say 
 I love this place!
