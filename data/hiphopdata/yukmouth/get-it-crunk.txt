 Miss me with that bullshit dawg, I'm on the grind

 Bottles, chairs, whatever I get my hands on

 Look I'm a pimp 
 Mine is the 3 piece suit 
 My grill the same color as my GT Coupe 
 Gators snappin' on my feet like they fresh out the jungle 
 There's a nine in my vest, but it's a tec' in my Hummer 
 I know I make y'all niggas wonder how I'm gettin' that cash 
 'Cause when we gotta drop, I ain't spendin' my last 
 The prices jump 
 If you out of town and you need a bird jump 
 I could ban him and blow his brains on the fuckin' curve jump 
 You don't want beef wit my squad nigga jump

 You think he ballin' until you see his Honda Accord 
 And tell valet not to scratch my wheel 
 Or he gon' leave here wit a busted lip 
 Me and Crime Boss rollin' in my Coupe Deville 
 I ain't tryin' leave you in but I shoot to kill 
 Hey, I'm like Jeezy, I trap or die 
 And I don't pop, pop, I rather fire
