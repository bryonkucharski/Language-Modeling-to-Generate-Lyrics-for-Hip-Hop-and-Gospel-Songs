Ey, man 
 You know I'm datin a model chick, right 
 Man, I think I love her, man 
 I mean, she's so fuckin' beautiful, man 
 I've seen her on the videos and shit 
 I've seen all the ads and shit, man 
 She independent, she got her own condo and car 
 I think I'mma mary this bitch, man 
 For real 
 (Yukmouth) 
 You got that model chick, gucci bag 
 I've seen her in that new ad with that huge azz 
 I've seen her in the video with that new Jag 
 With that new rappin' platinum nigga that blue cast 
 On her cute azz 
 You never thought your bitch would fuck that rapper in his new pack 
 True that, but then you love her with your cool azz 
 And you always let it slide when she do bad 
 You never knew that this bitch had like eight niggaz 
 On her side, and she break and she shake niggaz 
 To get by, she get the baller, the athlete 
 The model, the actor, director, the agent, producer, the rapper 
 And other niggaz like you that keep her die for you 
 You get wrapped around the finger 
 You let the bitch smack ya 
 A nigga need to pimp slap ya 
 Wake the fuck up and quick and look like a sucka 
 (Yukmouth chorus) 
 The model chicks is the shit to me (you can't be serious 
 I married her and Let her live with free (get the fuck outta here) 
 But on the lo she suckin dick for cheese (for real) 
 Let me caught up in the beauty, oh no 
 The model chicks is the shit to me (no he didn't) 
 I married her and Let her live with free (dude, you crazy) 
 She fuckin' stars at the V.I.P. 
 Let me caught up in the beauty, oh no 
 (Yukmouth) 
 She let the director sex her 
 Told her he put her in the movie but this juice used her as an extra 
 She let the producer seduce her 
 Told her he gon put an album together and sell more than Luther 
 She let the athlete hit it 
 And when the play-offs game that bitch got the floor-seat tickets 
 She let the actor, fuck her in the trailor 
 Later he dates a bitch gettin' for some paper 
 She let the rapper attacks her with a braids and glasses 
 She fuck 'em for the backstage passes 
 She let the club owner bone her 
 V.I.P. sippin mo mosis' 
 No more Corona now 
 She fucked the model 'cause she liked his muscles (liked his muscles) 
 She fucked the baller 'cause she liked his hussles (liked his hussles) 
 She fucked 'em all 'cause she like to bubble (like to bubble) 
 But fuck a broke nigga 
 Life's a struggle 
 Cheers
