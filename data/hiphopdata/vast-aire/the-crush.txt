This is not a love song. Naa. 
 I had a crush on Tawanda she went to IS230 
 Figure eight she was so curvy 
 Had an arch in her back with mad jewelery 
 Every Neanderthal wanted that cutie 
 Good complexion not too thin 
 She got the baddest trim 
 I ain't talking about her hair cut 
 She worked at my man's job 
 She made 11th grader's wanna cradle rob 
 She got the sweet potato, I got the corn on the cob 
 Tuck your shirt in she don't take no slobs 
 If you saw her smile, she had a bad attitude and a wicked profile 
 Gorgeous face and a nice style, it make you say "Damn you can have my child" 
 Got me thinking all this is worth my while 
 With my head in the clouds screaming loud 
 I got a love Jones, for your body and your skin tone 
 Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone 
 Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own 
 So you can sit by the throne 
 She looked good in the winter, better in the summer 
 I met her at the bus stop, she gave me her number 
 Sometimes we would go out and then slumber 
 She me yours, I'll show you mine (She lift up her sweater) 
 Back then no girl could do better 
 I really dug Karen, or was it Annetta 
 Or was it Vanessa, Stacey or Tracie 
 I didn't like Jessica, she was too spacey 
 Mia's got attitude, Janice got her tittie out 
 Missy's gay, Via's got her ass out 
 But Melissa's on the bed drinking wine 
 Don't hate on me Pa, I got pimp designs 
 Pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by the empire states 
 Come on baby why wait 
 Let's make whoopee today 
 I'm a Frankenstein valentine (how's that) 
 'Cause I can separate my heart from my mind 
 You were to emotional and then about three seconds I'm about to go postal 
 In other words, crazy nigga with a gun 
 I got a crush on you but you ain't the one 
 She was using sex as a weapon 
 Her aim was precise it kept me guessing 
 It kept me stepping 
 I was on my toes until I learnt my lesson 
 My man tried to tell me I was slippin' (slippin' man) 
 I ain't even no I was trippin' 
 But this is not a love song 
 Well, maybe it is 
 Maybe I'm frontin' 
 Why don't you pull my card 
 If the deuce is wild, I'll let down my guard
