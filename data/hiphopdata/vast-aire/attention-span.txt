Every little step we take breaks the dreams 
 Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams 
 Namsayin, when I walk, I want to break concrete! 
 Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror 
 My light beams are mad bright, 
 They stay clever 
 Yo challenge an Ox member, 
 Get a vow severed 
 Found your body in the desert (scavenger's dessert) 
 Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran 
 Plus enter battles talkin' shit like 
 'Look mom, no hands!' 
 I'm tired of cats tryin' to sum me 
 You can't add that far yet, 
 That counting is far fetched 
 I treat MC like canines 
 Throwin' words at they face 
 To see if they bite when they catch 
 I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette 
 Now you standing there 
 Wit razors in your head like barrettes 
 Man, if the mic had ass cheeks 
 The sticker in my hand 
 Would say priority seating 
 And man, I dunno if it was me or you 
 But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin' 
 You play the role/roll, 
 I'll play the poppy seed on top of you 
 The godspeed is actual, 
 That doesn't mean I act usual 
 One of the first emcees to give 
 The crowd full attention 
 'Cause you need love and affection 
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
 You wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life 
 That turn the peasants into leaders 
 And we know the differences between 
 The walkers and the sleepers 
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
 You wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life 
 That turn the peasants into leaders 
 And we know the differences between 
 The walkers and the sleepers 
 I boogie with picket-a-vision, 
 Carbon based stickler 
 City piss aroma, 
 Therapy coma, clone sitter 
 Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet 
 Feelings activate 
 Passionate the germ, 
 And the book met the worm 
 I hold a book of matches captive to flashin' 
 For some need flat line 
 Be a thick fatigue episode, 
 Brewed in batches 
 Flirted curse at perked nurse, 
 Broken skeleton patches 
 One muddy veteran collapsed 
 The untapped resource center 
 Housing style pageants 
 My little limbs lassoed catered to wings 
 While mankind's baby steps 
 Break dirt and demon 
 I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of 
 Mass times weight times tame semantics 
 Encompassing that which splits lips 
 But never supply and demand it 
 To hell wit plastic, ooh yeah it's splendid 
 Tap it on the shoulder, 
 Grab it, tag it, apprehend it 
 Lend it to the devil of a friend it, 
 Wrench it back, mend it again 
 It still never renders suspended 
 But finicky picket fences 
 Now every toy dreams to manufacture hearts 
 Start with the diving parts and the blueprints 
 You follow the precedence 
 Set by war pigs of a yesteryear 
 Let the tears pray 
 Skip a stone over the reservoir 
 To shake the whole charade 
 Hmm gun play the tumors platoon 
 I couldn't see 
 I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, 
 Woke up holding a tree 
 The only bridge I ever burned 
 Along this legacy at dance 
 Was the one that linked 
 The cities of Prosperity and Chance 
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
 You wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life 
 That turn the peasants into leaders 
 And we know the differences between 
 The walkers and the sleepers 
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
 You wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life 
 That turn the peasants into leaders 
 And we know the differences between 
 The walkers and the sleepers
