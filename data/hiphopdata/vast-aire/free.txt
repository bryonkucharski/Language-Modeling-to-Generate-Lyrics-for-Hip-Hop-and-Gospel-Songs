It's time to luagh, it's time to cry 
 It's time to be what you need to be 
 It won't be long till they are gone 
 And we can be what we want to be 
 I'm gonna run from everything 
 Everything that holds me down 
 Nothing to win, nothing to lose 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 Now I'm free, Now I'm free, Now I'm free 
 I'm gonna run, I'm gonna win 
 I'm gonna do what I need to do 
 'Cause it's time to be what I need to be 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 Now I'm free, Now I'm free, Now I'm free 
 I want hold air in my hand 
 Own the one thing you can't buy 
 Nothing to win, nothing to lose 
 I'm gonna run from everything 
 Everything that holds me down 
 Nothing to win, nothing to lose 
 It's time to be what I need to be 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 You can't tell me what to do anymore 
 Now I'm free, Now I'm free, Now I'm free
