The same motion, that moves the hip 
 Has the same efect on dominoes when tipped 
 I got two forty-five cents embedded 
 And I won't hesitate to leave your crew shredded 
 The name, is Vas Kramer 
 We been rhymin' since playn' hopscotch on top of the earth's surface 
 If you can't perform a sentence you're worthless 
 Put your hands up in the back, if you heard this 
 Yo hipster throw a scratch 
 To cover my phsyical you need six feet of tape like IMAX 
 So you can get the clear picture 
 I'm old school with new thoughts and open wounds, pour salt! 
 Can Ox is dirtier than a mudslide 
 And if you get caught, you might die 
 Let's let the sky decide 
 The speed is still right 
 After the Titans colide 
 Freestyles caught in my head 
 Starch in my head 
 Leave you with shreds 
 You wanna contest a dread 
 It's magnetic 
 Like live poets metal hands on top of my nuts that's pathetic 
 If you heard it, then I said it 
 When it rains it pours don't wet it 
 Man, you know what I'm saying? 
 There's only a billion prophocies, one of them's gotta set it 
 And only two MC's, and one of them's beheaded 
 Now you leaving the cypher retarded 
 As if you got caught, it's something you started 
 Clean this shit up! Like whatchamacallit 
 I see the sea just parted 
 And Air Vast just called it 
 Man, you ain't half as tight 
 I can bend any substance, that's metal nightlight 
 I can break any rule that's slavery type 
 I'm awful, we take no shit, that's the form we like 
 Adam's fam 
 You wanna fight styles, we got t-shirts that say we cut hands 
 Son we'll take both of 'em, the first time 
 So you can't play even play the wind chime 
 Or the piano, jazz or classical 
 I'm Vast Aire I might rip out your clavicle 
 Psh, then it's over 
 It's like that, I'm in the air, with Jehovah 
 Or in a, Range Rover 
 Or maybe in the sky holding onto the tail of a star nova 
 Crazy? I breathe on the mic if you lazy
