Give 'em some skin, a real country bumpkin 
 Get up off his property, the Villain, Fuzzy Lumpkins 
 Dumpin', enough raw lead to leave a forehead sunkin' 
 When he's on tour, keep your paws off his pumpkin dumplin' 
 Town village nympho, now it's all his, though 
 The way she got down was far from privileged info 
 Break up to make up, wake up and smell the indo 
 Just from how she liked to show her belly button window 
 Couldn't tell 'em nothin', 5200, Atari, or Sega 
 Test tube elves with the lid, Garcia y Vega 
 His tongue is like a sword that's mighty like a pen 
 And you ain't seen nothin' like The Mighty Quinn 
 All righty Then! 
 Seal the deal with the shakin' of a hand 
 People's catchin' feelings like it's Making of the Band 
 Villain have your fake man, quakin' in his Vans 
 When he do a jam, fans break dancin' in the stands 
 Chances are, he'll lose the battle and the war 
 Tryin' to go to shore with just a paddle and an ore 
 Ooh, shucks, he should have known them two schmucks 
 Would have camped through the game 
 And ?named ducks? off buku bucks 
 Vast Aire: 
 Yo, Metal Fingers, fix the beat with fire water 
 I advise all fathers to watch they daughters 
 It's goin' down tonight 
 We got monster's in the club, and they ready to fight 
 Metal Fingers, fix the beat with fire water 
 I advise all fathers to watch they daughters 
 You know we keep tricks up the sleeve 
 Comin' through with the justice league [??] 
 I used to sew army patches on my favorite coat 
 BMX got your guns, old folks got soap 
 Homeless Sally from Cali cursed, cats in the alley 
 Sounds so foul, we washed our mouths out with soap 
 I came up with cats, who never be smilin' 
 I called DOOM he sent me in on Monsta Island 
 Where the girls look good, 
 And them MC's be whilin' 
 You can catch me in Valuer Suits, stylin' 
 Little J holdin' hands with the Baroness 
 Storm Shadow and Snake eyes ain't got nothin' on this 
 I got them Go Go Gadgets 
 So when the cobra come through the floor 
 I'm puttin' snakes in baskets 
 DOOM: 
 We rhyme and do our thang 
 He's like Stimey from Our Gang 
 Ta Twang, try me, and WHA DA DA DANG 
 I don't think you want to know 
 Even if you still do 
 And want me to, I'll tell you 
 But then I'd have to kill you 
 WILL YOU? Please 
 It's like a Grilled Cheese sammich 
 Gotta bring the butter or the bread'll get damaged 
 Flip it, slice it, and give half to Vast Aire 
 If you ask nicely, and bring a glass 
 We'll share the last beer, here, 
 Vast Aire: 
 After the Cold Vein and Doomsday, we don't need no pop 
 REVOLUTION, we hit cops with Judo Chops 
 All you see is red, black, and green 
 Know I'm down for my team 
 They killed Radio Raheem! 
 Now I want to smoke a blunt, you know, blow off some steam? 
 Open my mouth like Godzilla, and all you see is light beams 
 Now this rap shit ain't all that it seems 
 You can leave it to the Supa Friendz to spill the beans
