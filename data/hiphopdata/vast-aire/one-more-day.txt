Have you heard 
 Have you tried to understand 
 It's all right 
 It gets easier with time 
 How are you 
 Are you ever coming back 
 I have changed 
 And I've realized I was wrong 
 I was wrong 
 Now I'll never see your face anymore 
 Oh my Love 
 I'd give anything for one more day with you 
 I'm getting through 
 I wish you felt the way I do 
 I have changed 
 And I've realized I was wrong 
 I was wrong 
 Now I'll never see your face anymore 
 Oh my love 
 I'd give anything for one more day with you
