Come pick me up 
 'Cause I've had it up to here 
 But that's not enough 
 A little more can't hurt so fill it up 
 Then grab yourself a beer and lift it up. 
 Heres to better days that lie ahead of us. 
 They may come soon 
 I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck 
 Our times are right 
 So here we are 
 'Cause we've been drinking, singing right here at the bar 
 And here we are 
 At first to change 
 Just hear me out 
 Lets drive out past the lights outside of town 
 Were only here so long so let it out 
 The whole world seems to shake when its coming down 
 But tomorrow you know right where I'll be found 
 We never change 
 At least when rearing when the nights are all the same 
 I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck 
 Our times are right 
 So here we are 
 'Cause we've been drinking, singing right here at the bar 
 And here we are 
 At first to change 
 Come pick me up 
 'Cause I've had it up to here but that's not enough 
 A little more can't hurt so fill it up 
 Then grab yourself a beer and lift it up 
 Heres to putting off our date with destiny 
 I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck 
 Our times are right 
 So here we are 
 'Cause we've been drinking, singing right here at the bar 
 And here we are 
 At first to change 
 To change
