It seems our Time has all run out 
 Were falling from tonight's sky 
 Trying to block this whole world out, eyelids closing 
 I've always dreamed of dying in my sleep 
 Eternities of counting sheep 
 But I... I know better now 
 The view from here is not worth the fall 
 I'm sick of landing on my head (with you) 
 My heart tonight 
 The city burns so bright 
 From this altitude that we cruise 
 Were weightless 
 Were fateless or so we thought 
 'Cause what goes up now must come down 
 Straight Down Down Down 
 The Flashing Lights 
 Looking like a runway here tonight 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 In the cold concrete, in my warm bed 
 A thousand tons of falling lead 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Lets board this flight 
 I'm sick of life right now 
 And its time to say goodbye 
 Where to? Is far too dark to tell 
 Maybe heaven, Probably hell 
 There's one thing that I know 
 And it's what goes up now must come down 
 Straight Down Down Down 
 The Flashing Lights 
 Looking like a runway here tonight 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 In the cold concrete, in my warm bed 
 A thousand tons of falling lead 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 I can't wake up 
 I can't wake up 
 I'm giving up 
 What goes up now must come down 
 And what goes up now must 
 What goes now up must come down 
 Straight Down Down Down 
 The Flashing Lights 
 Looking like a runway here tonight 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 In the cold concrete, in my warm bed 
 A thousand tons of falling lead 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing 
 Prepare for crash landing
