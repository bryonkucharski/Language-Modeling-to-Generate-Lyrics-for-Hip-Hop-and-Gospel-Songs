Start at the back of my head 
 And peel my skin away 
 I'll show you there is nothing anymore 
 I've been dead for a while 
 Don't let this smile make you think any differently 
 And what I want and what I need 
 One more chance to live 
 Well I had it but I lost it 
 I choked on my last words again 
 I hope to see you soon 
 Tell me what did you see 
 When you looked inside of me 
 Was there a doubt to all my words 
 I've been dead for a while 
 You can check my file 
 Down the hall past the infirmary 
 And what I want and what I need 
 One more chance to live 
 Well I had it but I lost it 
 I choked on my last words again 
 I hope to see you soon 
 And all those times you could have sworn that it was in my grasp 
 And all those times I could have sworn I felt you beating in my chest 
 Well I had it but I lost it 
 Well I lost it all again 
 Well I lost it all
