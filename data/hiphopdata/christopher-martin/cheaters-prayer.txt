 It's not the first nor the last, so, so much pretty girl a pass and 
 Holding out is such a task, that's why me a seh this from mi heart 
 Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, cause as far as I can see, 
 She loves only me, 
 Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, but Lord if you can't stop me 
 From cheating, just don't let me get caught 
 No, no, no, don't let me get caught 
 No, don't let me get caught (no no no) 
 Said I hope I don't get caught 
 So listen to me now, it's such a sticky situation 
 Me promise my girl fi only look inna her direction 
 But everywhere me turn me see a next one (gosh) and me body get weak and a 
 Ball fi attention

 Would understand

 Another guy (yuh mad) 
 And yo it hard, yo it hard, yo it hard to have one girl, it kinda rough fi 
 Play the part
