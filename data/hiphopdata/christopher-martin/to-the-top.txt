We can make it if we try 
 Only if we try 
 Hold your head up hold it high 
 Got to hold it high

 We can make it to the top 
 Ain't no turning back 
 What we need is unification 
 We got to find some motivation 
 Set side in your destination 
 Be more precise with your estimation 
 Put your head up on the price now 
 Elevate you're on the rise now 
 We are the element of surprise now 
 We can make it if we try 
 Only if we try 
 Hold your head up hold it high 
 Got to hold it high 
 Journey on that never stop

 We can make it to the top

 Cause the sky is the limit 
 Hold on firm and you win it

 Watch we design then 
 Nuff a dem lost and dem say we fi find dem 
 Nuff a dem a devil so you know we nuh join dem 
 Have a bag talk and no meaning behind dem

 Don't you dare to hesitate 
 Time to communicate 
 Don't you ever wait to late 
 You got so much at stake 
 Sometimes you give an take 
 No reason to debate 
 We can make it if we try 
 Only if we try 
 Hold your head up hold it high 
 Got to hold it high 
 Journey on that never stop 
 We can make it to the top 
 We can make it to the top 
 Ain't no turning back
