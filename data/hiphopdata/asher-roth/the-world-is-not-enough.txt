Thought I could save the world with the rhythm and rhyme 
 But then I came to find they had a prison in mind 
 Violence on the rise got us living in crime 
 They wanna lock us up, take your position in line 
 Well by God if this isn't a sign 
 And we have no idea what we've been visited by 
 Yeah, you bet it's real, we are mission-aligned 
 But they saying Ash chill man, this isn't the time 
 Well when is it? 
 Our people been evicted 
 From homes they grew up in but nobody cares to listen 
 Man it's pretty sick they try to vilify religions 
 And pit us against each other when nobody's really different 
 Capitalism, this is a growing issue 
 You with us or against us? 
 Pick which one is you 
 Won't be until this fucking revolution hits you 
 That they already out front, ready to come and get you 
 This world, This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 Am I the last one left? 
 Peace, love, and happiness 
 Or just another rapper mad I got a stupid ass to kiss 
 So I could get a buck while bloodsuckers live it up 
 Just give me some man, why's it gotta come to fisticuffs? 
 These drugs bad man, they snorting up bath salts 
 Heroin and crack-rock, what's in the bag dog!? 
 Stealing from my dad just to get us some cash 
 We face a tall task, dang, yo enough with the fast talk 
 Give it to me straight, there's so much I could take 
 While they multiply the problems and divide us by hate 
 And the radio, they playing only things that they pay 
 Man it's a shame cause the music was our only escape, so 
 Now we're all alone and everybody's a clone 
 Cause everybody's always on their cellular phone 
 So now we getting slow and becoming a drone 
 We missing out on really living, I just want you to know 
 This world, This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what) 
 This world is never enough 
 Man the world ain't ever enough (what what what)
