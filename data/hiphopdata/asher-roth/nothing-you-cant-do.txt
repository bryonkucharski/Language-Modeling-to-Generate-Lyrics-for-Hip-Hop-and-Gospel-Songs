This life is all that matters 
 My time is all I have and 
 I came here to prove that, 
 There's nothing that you can't do. 
 I'm so annoyed with this world that we live in, 
 Its hard enough just for us to make a liv-ing. 
 It's the same thing over and over 
 But were only getting older and older 
 So were told 'get a job that safe, 
 Cause dreams are too fake for us to chase' 
 This is my life if that's the case 
 Can't I decide to design my fate? 
 If I wanna get high and wasted 
 Then I will and no one can say shit. 
 I just hate that were caught in this matrix 
 The money we make, the government takes it. 
 Then paves highways with no exits 
 Just more ways to get caught in traffic 
 So I ask em, please do tell 
 What would you do if you could not fail? 
 Yeah for real put the job on the shelf 
 Take a deep breath spend time with yourself 
 Say hi, introduce you to you 
 If you couldn't lose then what would you do? 
 Whoopdedoo if you don't have a clue 
 None of us do when we first leave school. 
 You're a fool if you think that you're straight 
 Cause you put on a suit and a tie everyday 
 And show up to a job that you hate 
 The only reason you're there is 'cause you're gettin' paid 
 You waste your time, half awake for an employee discount and hourly wage 
 Locked in a cage like a mouse with a wheel 
 Patiently wait for an occasional meal 
 But without all the bills and the mail, 
 What would you do if you could not fail? 
 This is your life, take it back 
 Your time here is all that you have 
 And its sad that some are wasting their health 
 Working a job for somebody else 
 But someday I wanna be a dad 
 With a son to play catch with and teach how to bat 
 So with that I decided to rap, 
 And since then it ain't been that bad (cause)
