Yeah, I wrote a song and it go a little something like this 
 They say it's a cold world, yeah you got that right 
 I almost packed it all in on the spot last night 
 They want a killer instinct and I'm just that type 
 But if the fights not mine, I won't fight that fight 
 Life without struggling, yeah right 
 Make one mistake, won't make that twice 
 Out of sight out of mind, find yourself out of time 
 Buy your own pants, get your hands out of mine 
 An advance ain't a promise you will make it 
 There's work to be done, you must grind to shine 
 Every second is a blessing, yes it is precious 
 Suggest you get off instant message 
 The aggression when your finding your direction 
 Then heading non stop just to find that the road is blocked 
 You wanna pop, flip your lid and stomp 
 But settle down and work it out, 
 Its really all you've got, so I tell em 
 When I can't take it, I can't take it no more 
 This is what I say 
 La Di Da Da Da, La Di Da Da Da, Over 
 When you can't take it, When you can't take it no more 
 This is what you say, 
 La Di Da Da Da, La Di Da Da Da Over 
 And yeah I'm frustrated, fuck this, what's this, how much 
 Who what, where when, why man, how come 
 So many questions unanswered, I don't understand 
 Could you please explain sir 
 I'm in a phase, I believe I can change 
 In exchange for an explanation, estimation, hesitation 
 Is it as visible dealing with digital? 
 Fidgeting through e-mail when the issue is pivotal 
 Critical condition, My heads in 
 I'm heading in the wrong direction 
 Book me a session, Let it off my chest 
 Ill invest in a (Cannon) 
 Just so I can blow with my flow as my right hand man 
 Van Dam ass kickin' with Ash spittin' 
 I'm that different just ask Jigga (Ask Jigga) 
 He listened and witnessed the birth of a star 
 Emerging and surging his way up to the top 
 Of the charts, now sing along 
 When I can't take it, I can't take it no more 
 This is what I say 
 La Di Da Da Da, La Di Da Da Da, Over 
 When you can't take it, When you can't take it no more 
 This is what you say, 
 La Di Da Da Da, La Di Da Da Da Over 
 When I'm trying to come up, they wanna bring me down 
 When I'm trying to come up, they wanna bring me down 
 When I'm trying to come up, they wanna bring me down 
 When I'm trying to come up, they wanna bring me down 
 When you trying to come up. they wanna bring you down 
 When you trying to come up. they wanna bring you down 
 When you trying to come up. they wanna bring you down 
 When you trying to come up. they wanna bring you down 
 When you trying to come up. they wanna bring you down 
 All the kids sing along
