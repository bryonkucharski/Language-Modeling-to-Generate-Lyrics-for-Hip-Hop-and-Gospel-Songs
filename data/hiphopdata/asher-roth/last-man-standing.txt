(Intro: Akon) 
 Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey! 
 Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey! 
 Akon and Asher Roth 
 (Verse 1: Asher Roth) 
 They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more 
 Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more! 
 Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more 
 Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword 
 So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce 
 Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours 
 Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor 
 Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war 
 Guessed, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure 
 Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore 
 World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace 
 What's behind the door, the allure something strange? 
 Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed 
 No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change 
 Course is unphased, contorted or concave 
 I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang 
 Got me feeling like 
 (Hook: Akon) 
 I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes 
 My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive 
 The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside 
 Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing! 
 Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey! 
 Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey! 
 (Verse 2: Asher Roth) 
 I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself 
 I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health 
 When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt 
 Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help 
 So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real 
 So most of 'em I approach 'em with a Slomin's Shield 
 Keep my enemies close 'cause they prone to steal 
 When friends become foes know you're doing it well 
 Just keep it going 
 I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker? 
 Group homes and tombstones to feel safer 
 Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying 
 Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in 
 Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it 
 Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it 
 Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is 
 Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like
