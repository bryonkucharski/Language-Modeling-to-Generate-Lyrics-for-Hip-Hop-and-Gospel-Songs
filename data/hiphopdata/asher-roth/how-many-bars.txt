 Baseball adjustable cap backwards 
 Walk by your crew, you're like, "that nerd's 
 On my last nerve", but it's all good, doggie 
 'Cause I had your girlfriend with my coffee 
 That's twice a day, yeah, twice today 
 Girls would be abstinent if I was gay 
 When I talk to her I just keep it brief 
 Walk down the street with my peen out my briefs 
 Yeah, I'm a monster socially 
 Private counselors teach girls to get over me 
 Barracuda semen, swimming past ovaries 
 All y'all thought white boys said was "totally" 
 If you're looking for me I'll give you a noogie 
 Yeah I get more head than a hoodie 
 You're gonna get it, how much you wanna bet? 
 Drop my pants, what you see is what you get 
 (Asher Roth) 
 Slim fitted, dim witted, get with it (get with it) 
 See your Benz dented, me and my friends did it (yeah we did it) 
 Committed the dumb shit, dum-ditty 
 I did it in one sitting with just a dum-ditty 
 Come get it, I'm coming to some city 
 This summer the sun's gonna feel suddenly strong, ain't it? 
 Goddammit the planet be so damaged 
 I can't even go roll without my suntan lotion 
 No, son, take a look up out the ocean 
 All over the globe what was frozen is now erosion 
 And being pulled to the coast with your mom's best friend 
 And her son called ozone holes and 
 Sippin a mamosa 
 Mama in the back yard baking up a loaf of 
 Something so soulful 
 Hoping this banana bread 
 Gimme any hand full of that and I'll dismantle it 
 Had to hit up Cannon when I landed in Atlanta and 
 Told him how we about to go ahead and save the planet and 
 Da-da-tantling, back up with my DJ 
 We be cleaning house now, put this one on replay 
 All right um...
