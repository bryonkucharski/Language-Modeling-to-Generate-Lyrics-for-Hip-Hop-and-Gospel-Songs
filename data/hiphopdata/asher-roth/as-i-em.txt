 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 (Asher Roth) 
 I was in seventh grade when I heard The Slim Shady LP 
 Yeah, my mom brought it down when I was ironing; irony 
 Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school, 
 Sink my teeth in anything to think I'm cool, riding the bus 
 I feel the rush from I "Still Don't Give A Fuck" 
 Yeah, I wish I could agree but I've already had enough 
 I've already given up from playing the same game 
 Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like 
 Em was great, yeah, he paved the way for me 
 He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z 
 But they keep relating me, I can't get away 
 Chasing me (all day long) I hear it (all day long) 
 And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers 
 They say, "Asher's not a rapper, nah, he's actually just a actor" 
 'Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection 
 It's easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection 
 Each second, every minute, each hour of everyday 
 I'm constantly on the fence defending my own name 
 Explaining we are not the same 
 Not much that I can say, except I'm sick of it, 
 Critics arrantly sparked up a flame, it's on 
 (Chester French) 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 (Asher Roth) 
 Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefitted 
 It's like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I be spitting 
 It's so different, the image they don't get it 
 It's simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living 
 But Em was in it way before I committed 
 And his lyrics were the shit so I really got to come with it 
 But each critic been picking apart my writtens 
 And if it's not up to par then Asher's Paul is just a gimmick 
 Is it my fault must I be more convincing? 
 Y'all talk all you want, never halt me from my mission 
 Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me? 
 (All day long) I hear it (all day long) 
 And yeah, the haters want to hate because I made it and I'm famous 
 But until you take my place you'll never know 'bout what it takes to make a record for respect, take a second to inspect 
 When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect? 
 I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game 
 But it's harder for an artist creating his own lane 
 That's synonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing 
 All the time all that's declining and about to explode 
 (Chester French) 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 (Asher Roth) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say 
 If I don't confront the problem it will never go away 
 Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do 
 It's impossible rejecting an elephant in the room 
 Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived 
 So long to all the blogs, could have swore they knew me 
 If you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts 
 Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth... gone 
 (Chester French) 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 Take me as I am my friends, ain't going to change 
 Won't be no Em, rock these songs 
 Rock these shows, only good life I know 
 Yeah, yeah
