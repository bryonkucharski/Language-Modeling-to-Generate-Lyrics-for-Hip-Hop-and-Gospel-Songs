Sticky Fingaz f/ Choclatt 
 (Sticky Fingaz - Talking) 
 I think one right here... 
 Is long over due 
 All y'all 
 All y'all 
 To all my sisters all across the world 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 I applaud you 
 I know nothing can't erase the pain we caused you 
 I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you 
 Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you 
 Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you 
 Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you 
 Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed ya 
 I was thinking "Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?" 
 You never feel it, till it hits home 
 We abandoned you, left you all alone 
 With our babies in your hour of need 
 Left you all by yourself to raise our seed 
 And all the times we made you go wild in court 
 And had to fight us just to get child support 
 Its only a handful of us that handle our responsibility 
 I'm from a broken home; you know this shit is killing me 
 How a man can make a woman a mother and a father 
 If men got it hard, then women got it harder 
 And I represent every man on earth when I say this: 
 Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness 
 Sister I'm sorry 
 (Chorus- Choclatt) 
 For all the wrong I've done 
 Sister I'm sorry 
 Sister I'm sorry 
 I'm telling everyone 
 Sister I'm sorry 
 Nothing can change the past 
 Your forgiveness is all I ask 
 I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 I ain't recognize the goddess that's inside of you 
 I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith 
 But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl 
 Made me over-stare, hope it's not to late 
 And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world 
 I don't want my child being ashamed of me 
 Swear to life I don't know how y'all made it all these years 
 Like "Mommy, where's daddy?" Wonder what became of me 
 Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears 
 You my sister, I respect and love you 
 And he came from she 
 You woman, men came from you 
 Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me 
 All men ain't the man that they claim to be 
 Sister, I'm so sorry 
 (Choclatt) 
 Please forgive me 
 I'm so sorry for hurting you 
 I'm so sorry 
 For mistreating you 
 For not loving you 
 I'm so sorry
