(Featuring Blackchild) 
 (Chorus 1) (Sticky) 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 Verse 1: (Sticky) 
 My dogs is my guns, 
 They attack any nigga that comes or any niggas that rings 
 If my glocks on safe that means my dogs on the leash 
 Twenty shells in the clip, each bullet's the teeth 
 Keep my dogs starvin', they ain't ate in days 
 Keep my guns loaded, they can't wait to spray 
 My glock is a Rot, my Four-Fifth is a Pit 
 My D.E. a bullmaster, who wanna get bit? 
 When my guns spark that means I let 'em loose in the park 
 Now let's see if your bite is as big as your bark 
 My Nine against your Nine to the death, have a dogfight 
 Foamin' at the mouthpiece, run the streets all night 
 My dogs turn to razors up North 
 They don't wear collars, scratched the serial off 
 No owner, no dogtag, my dogs is illegal 
 They bite a hole in you so big you can see through 
 My dogs will even bark at this whole click 
 This a K-9, it eats it's own shit 
 They tried to put him to sleep, kids scared to pet 'em 
 I just say "sick 'em" and it pulls of and gets 'em 
 (Bridge) (Sticky) 
 My fuckin' guns, my fuckin' guns! 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 Rob you doggystyle with the gun in your back! 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 (Chorus 2) (Blackchild) 
 My dogs is my guns, they'll chase you if you run 
 Clear out the party, and bite somebody 
 They got niggas goin' to war for the cause 
 And you don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 You don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 You don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 A dog ain't a Man's best friend, it's a Mac Ten 
 And my Mac Ten is my best friend 
 It got niggas goin' to war for the cause 
 And you don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 You don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 You don't want my dogs to bark at y'all 
 Verse 2: (Sticky) 
 I got two dogs, one named Nigga, one named Bitch 
 Bitch is the one with the pretty gold clip 
 Nigga's the one with the taped up grip 
 I'll make 'em empty simultaneous till you get hit 
 Fuck fightin' in the streets, life is a struggle 
 Put on a silencer, now they're wearin' a muzzle 
 I hate Puppies, little guns, I need power 
 You small time, a .22, you a Chiwauwa 
 Teeth growin', bullets we never run out of 
 My dogs mate with new guns, I feed 'em gun powder 
 They ain't home trained, nor house broken 
 Mouth open, droolin', that means the barrel is smokin' 
 I walk my dogs every night, prime-meridian 
 Bust under water, they can swim, amphibian 
 Turn 'em to a sawed-off, get their ears chopped off 
 My automatics a Pit with the locked jaw. 
 (Chorus 2 2x) (Blackchild) 
 (Chorus 1) (Sticky) 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 My dogs is my guns 
 (Bridge 2) (Sticky) 
 My dogs is my guns, I walk wit' 'em, talk wit 'em 
 Go to court wit 'em, always in Newyork wit' 'em 
 I never leave 'em, eat wit' em, sleep wit' 'em 
 Sit 'em on the sink nigga, take a leak wit' 'em 
 (Bridge 1) (Sticky) 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 My dogs is my fuckin' guns! 
 Bust your dogs, it's your fuckin' guns!
