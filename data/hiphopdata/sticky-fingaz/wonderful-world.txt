Now a days it's easier to get a gun than a education 
 That's why kids in trench coats shoot up they schools 
 And parents out live they kids 
 And sex, the thing that bring life also take it away 
 When you say this is a wonderful world, ha-ha-ha-ha 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 I've seen trees of green, red roses too 
 I seen 'em bloom for me and you 
 And I think to myself 
 What a wonderful world 
 I've seen skys of blue and clouds of white 
 The bright blessed day 
 The dark sacred night 
 And I think to myself 
 What are wonderful world 
 The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky 
 Are also on the faces of people going by 
 Sayin' How do you do? 
 I've seen friends shaking hands 
 I hear babies cryin' 
 They're really sayin' "I love you" 
 I watch them grow 
 They'll learn much more than I'll ever know 
 And I think to myself 
 What a wonderful world 
 Yes, I think to myself 
 Oh, yeah 
 What a wonderful world
