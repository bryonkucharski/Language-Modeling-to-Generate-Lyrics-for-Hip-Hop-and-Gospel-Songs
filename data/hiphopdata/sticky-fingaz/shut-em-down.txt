 Onyx featuring dmx 
 Shut 'em down 
 Shut 'em down 
 Shut 'em down [4x] 
 Yo shut 'em down start the violence 
 We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found 
 Washed up on coney island 
 When I rolled up, this niggas heart slowed up 
 That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump 
 Thirty-two shots and ducked out 
 So look out 
 Left that cat for dead his body smoked out 
 'Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid 
 I'm goin' all out 
 Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it 
 Gmae play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted 
 Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest 
 Have you layin' with a dead rest 
 Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death 
 And I swore forgiveness when I did this 
 There was not no witness but he should understand 
 Cause even God got a shit list 
 Beat downs anonymous 
 I spit like a shiny silver nanabus (?) 
 Niggas fond of us 
 We the kind that rush, those that hold back 
 Takin' your whole stack 
 Grimy street cats 
 Niggas bald head like kojak 
 Go gat for gat 
 Coat that 
 You could smoke that 
 Or cut black dust 
 Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack 
 Betta know me 
 1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony 
 I'l tear you homey 
 Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down 
 Shun sees takin' your time 
 Makin' your mind 
 Got this nigga on the low 
 Defecatin' with rhymes 
 Breakin' your spine 
 Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry 
 I'ma bury the bullshit 
 I'ma bury the bullshit 
 I'ma bury the bullshit 
 Feel my full clip 
 (Verse 3: dmx) 
 Aiyyo I bet you this muthafuckin' double barrel will blast his face 
 Be on the look out for a basket case 
 Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat 
 Had you thinkin' shits sweet 
 Now you up shit's creek 
 Cause your shits weak 
 How mich is your life worth to someone important 
 'Cause I be extortin' 
 Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in 
 From back in the days of gordon 
 Niggas was gettin' robbed 
 The guy from rikers height stayed on his job 
 With his own little mob 
 Was it worth goin' back to the earth so soon 
 Worth makin' my shit go boom 
 To your own doom, from the graveyards 
 Till there's no room 
 Fuck you know about a pine box 
 Money goin' out with nine glocks 
 On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots 
 Feel like killin' for your crew 
 I ain't gon' rest 
 It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best 
 Then watch your loins spill out your vest 
 You best get on some act your age shit 
 You a little kid 
 That run for faces 
 More niggas get killed like that 
 (Verse 4: sticky fingaz) 
 Mad man sticky f-I-n-g-a-z 
 The crazy cajun blazin' bullets for days and days 
 Grazin' amazin' I'm the glazin' ason purple hazin' 
 Hard to be pahsin' lord with all this hell I'm raisin' 
 God of the underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound 
 We gonna shut 'em down 
 We turn we gonna shut 'em down 
 We turn we gonna shut 'em down 
 We turn shit dumb quick gun click 
 Lyin' in the vine 
 Persed the line on your dick 
 In the morgue admit it dogs 
 I'm the rottweiler my glock holler 
 Fuck cocaine killer I sniff gun powder 
 So all you real willies throw your roleys in the sky 
 And all the crooks rob the place outside 
 I'm so hype, I take your life, betta have my doe right 
 Fuck my life, I don't need no mic! 
 The new album
