Who are you to question, how I live 
 When the whole entire world is negative 
 I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive 
 Keep my hustle in the street till the day I die 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 From NY, Southside where guns hide 
 Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high 
 Got one eye, you get wet and hung dry 
 Leave you tongue-tied, mothers watch their young die 
 Nig' you wan' die? Fuck a car through run by 
 I'll be waitin at your crib for my money till the sun die 
 Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie 
 A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by 
 Squeeze this rap shit till the well run dry 
 I never spoke to one time not even one time 
 Look at my brain it's every rapper combined 
 I'm bout to OD on some shit like Sublime 
 Who are you to question, how I live 
 When the whole entire world is negative 
 I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive 
 Keep my hustle in the street till the day I die 
 I'm just another face from a movie screen 
 A tough little nigga from a magazine 
 I said you're lookin' for trouble if you want his cream 
 Remember everything ain't what it seem 
 Now can you feel me? Can you feel me? 
 Can you feel me? Can you feel me motherfucker? 
 Can you feel me? Can you feel me? 
 Can you feel me? Then get it right motherfucker

 Your life flashback, you was born out the asscrack 
 A'yo pass that, niggaz like that get blast at 
 You mad wack, walk around with that gas pack 
 You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at 
 15.3 match that, coupe hatchback 
 I'm a class act, got assets, where the ass at? 
 I do you like I did them niggaz on the last track 
 We like dice, if you gon' roll don't ass bet 
 I won't rest in peace, even in my casket 
 Had the '03 hum' in '02 and I crashed that 
 I rap slash act, seven digits I cash that 
 Niggaz wan' dead the beef now but it's passed that
