Yo, yo, yo, check it 
 I make the past dash for the post to most indeed 
 My dough speeds approve feed, what I believe top seed 
 I write scrolls like Judei Sensei, my tongue real sharp 
 On the target shit, that your mind can't shield 
 Most can't feel, the appeal I set upon the mass 
 Niggaz speakin' ?, one point seven grams of vocal hash 
 I splash like Hank and Bank flows in many waters 
 Shamed your game even before the fourth quarter 
 My order is brief, I chant meaning for demeanor 
 With my cleaner outlook, my moves advancin like a rook 
 Took, time to design, but I incline, intertwine my 
 Shit upon your mind, check, for my warnin signs cause 
 I'm a hazardous graduate of the schools of fatness 
 My inner flows like, water in a cactus 
 But y'all can't see the science in this - I'm like 
 The day you bought you first LP, from Kane or Blastmaster Kris 
 Twist trees, the ordinary nig would never toke 
 Well over here we catch a tree but overseas we catch a boat 
 I wrote these degrees for the backpacks, travellin on foot 
 The low Guess sag, Walkman and a notebook 
 And Goddesses with their ear to the norm 
 Cause the new generation got this whole shit wrong... 
 Who's the fool? My tools only used to bring elaborate 
 Shit on ?, activist servin' my addicts (why?) 
 Fuck up those who dance by chance a champ be fly 
 Smack that ass that go by and she won't ask me why 
 I'm tokin never gun totin I'm potent with the word spoken 
 Leak the speak nigga, pass that, you're chokin 
 With a minimum dose, toast for taste, for your liking in advance 
 Enhance thoughts so, comp take a chance 
 In my world, only the true stand in my circumfrence 
 They're bumpin shit, with lyrics so much they're mad abundence 
 I'm like the first Dutch of your day, Sensai 
 I'm rallyin carry the load, as my pen explode 
 My tech shows no weakness, behold my uniqueness 
 Daily Rap News messenger, Under Pressure 
 I raise the stakes on fakes like chips to, a gambler 
 You're catchin my phrase like, I passed to Wes Chandler 
 My style not the R&B code, but the true category 
 Concoting flows in Dexter's Laboratory 
 Switching up styles like teams of Robert Horry 
 It'll take me days to tell my tales of fame and glory 
 Been down long roads leadin through, the Swiss Alps 
 Where every chick in town got blonde hair in they scalp 
 What I'm about, is still refreshin your mind, guys are blind 
 'Cause what you find is the shit, is the downfall of rapkind 
 Askin the same question, all the time whassup with yo' shit? 
 Yo sit back and focus, beginners notice: 
 My speech is never an impediment 
 Always a step of it to show I have intelligence 
 So, MC El Da Sensei, O-you-T 
 For the nine-eight season we be, out...
