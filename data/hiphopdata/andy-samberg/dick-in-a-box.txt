Hey, girl 
 I got something real important to give you 
 So just sit down 
 And listen 
 Girl, you know we been together 
 Such a long, long time 
 (Such a long time) 
 And now I'm ready 
 To lay it on the line 
 Wow, you know it's Christmas 
 And my heart is open wide 
 (Open wide) 
 Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind 
 (What's on my mind) 
 A gift real special 
 So take off the top 
 Take a look inside 
 It's my dick in a box 
 (It's in a box) 
 Not gonna get you a diamond ring 
 That sort of gift don't mean anything 
 Not gonna get you a fancy car 
 Girl, you gotta know you're my shining star 
 Not gonna get you a house in the hills 
 A girl like you needs something real 
 I wanna get you something from the heart 
 (Something special, girl) 
 It's my dick in a box! 
 My dick in a box, babe 
 It's my dick in a box! 
 (Ooh) 
 My dick in a box, girl 
 See, I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs giving, girl 
 And I got just the one 
 Something to show you that you are second to none 
 To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress 
 It's easy to do 
 Just follow these steps: 
 One: 
 Cut a hole in a box 
 Two: 
 Put your junk in that box 
 Three: 
 Make her open the box 
 And that's the way you do it 
 It's my dick in a box! 
 My dick in a box, babe 
 It's my dick in a box! 
 (Ooh) 
 My dick in a box, girl 
 Christmas 
 Dick in a box 
 Hanukkah 
 Dick in a box! 
 Kwanzaa 
 A dick in a box 
 Every single holiday, a dick in a box 
 Over at your parents' house, a dick in a box 
 Midday at the grocery store, a dick in a box 
 Backstage at the CMAs, a dick in a box 
 Yeah 
 A dick in a box 
 Dick in a box 
 Dick in a box...
