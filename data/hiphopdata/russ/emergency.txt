Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah 
 I been climbin', the view's spectacular 
 Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger 
 Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible 
 As of late, I been feelin' responsible 
 For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should 
 Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood 
 Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite 
 Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages 
 Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas 
 Hits them like tequila when they see me in arenas, yeah 
 It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for it 
 Bein' devils in disguise is everythin' I pray for 
 I learned a lot though from all the above 
 I guess God got a job at the comedy club 
 But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin' 
 'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon 
 I been travelin' a lot now 
 Got to find the time to 
 Take it in and take a step back 
 Kick it with the family 
 I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision 
 All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency 
 I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though 
 Always moving with a sense of urgency 
 Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore 
 I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before 
 Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts 
 And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her 
 I gotta conquer and collect 
 Every fuckin' check, gotta pay a couple tuitions 
 Write 'em off as an expense 
 Let the takeover commence 
 If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success 
 I stay awake to achieve it, this crazy seeing 
 Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs 
 Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on 
 Flights bitchcoastal, everythin' paid for 
 That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for 
 Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace 
 Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease 
 This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms 
 I don't wish for shit, I desired and acquire 
 I been travelin' a lot now 
 Got to find the time to 
 Take it in and take a step back 
 Kick it with the family 
 I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision 
 All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency 
 I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though 
 Always moving with a sense of urgency 
 No failure is final, no success is permanent 
 It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament 
 Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights 
 Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price 
 At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight 
 If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8 
 Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed 
 He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed 
 Monitor what Russ' makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin' 
 Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it 
 Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was 
 Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up 
 Myself every time I let the chips fall, where they may 
 I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah 
 People stumble on stones that I used to step on 
 The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself 
 I been travelin' a lot now 
 Got to find the time to 
 Take it in and take a step back 
 Kick it with the family 
 I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision 
 All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency 
 I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though 
 Always moving with a sense of urgency
