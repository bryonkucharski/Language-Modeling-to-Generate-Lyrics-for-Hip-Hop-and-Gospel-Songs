Yeah, yeah, there's a difference 
 Oh yeah, there's a difference 
 Oh, Yeah, there's a difference 
 There's a difference, yeah 
 There's a difference 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Me, got it out the mud, they respect that 
 Me, always spread the love when I get back 
 You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move 
 You, always complaining like a bitch do 
 Me, still right here with who I came with 
 Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit 
 You, got a different crew every weekend 
 You, don't wanna dap back, keep sleeping 
 Yeah, you wished for it, me, I worked for it 
 Everyone passed on me like Kurt Warner 
 A search warrant needed, your career went missing 
 This ain't overnight, this is year ten visions 
 Peers listen and they know that I'm up next 
 That's your girl? Why she always does what Russ says 
 Success is something that I'm blessed with mentally 
 I got plaques for my raps and my melodies 
 Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret 
 Real shit affection, pledge your allegiance 
 I was gone for so long, now I'm on though 
 Bitch I'm talking, don't you interrupt this God flow 
 Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me 
 Because of you, I did it myself, so it means more to me 
 Did so many free shows and now they can't afford the fee 
 No one gave a fuck and now the whole world's recording me 
 Me, got it out the mud, they respect that 
 Me, always spread the love when I get back 
 You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move 
 You, always complaining like a bitch do 
 Me, still right here with who I came with 
 Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit 
 You, got a different crew every weekend 
 You, don't wanna dap back, keep sleeping 
 Lately, I been trying minimize all my stresses 
 Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessing 
 Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song 
 PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on 
 Get it on your own or I can't respect it 
 See me in person, don't call, don't text it 
 Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it 
 Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it 
 Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be 
 No rap name to hide behind, this the real me 
 Before the plaques, I was certified 
 I do business, I keep my income diversified 
 I counted 35 thousand with my family last night 
 And another 35 before this verse 
 I be laying wide awake in my thoughts at night like 
 "God damn, motherfucker this worked" 
 Me, got it out the mud, they respect that 
 Me, always spread the love when I get back 
 You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move 
 You, always complaining like a bitch do 
 Me, still right here with who I came with 
 Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit 
 You, got a new crew every weekend 
 You, don't wanna dap back, keep sleeping
