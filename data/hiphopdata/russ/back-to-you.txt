 Fell in love with a girl from PR, kept up online like PR 
 Had me waitin' like a DR, stretch her out in her room like ER 
 I stumbled on your page got liquor in my thumbs 
 I see you followin my path, my thought, and actions left crumbs 
 I thought that I left you in Atlanta 
 I thought that I'd never see you busy 
 I thought that without me you'd go down 
 I thought that you would never leave the city 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could 
 And you know that this drink got me talkin', late night callin, yeah 
 Out of state got a couple shows gettin' money 
 Hotel room with a ten and twenties 
 Scoop her, Uber, tryna manoeuvre, tryna test me but I studied 
 Got a little bit a hesitance, keep one eye on you like a wink 
 Sunset Boulevard, Moonlight, 10, off the sauce like ooh I slipped 
 I thought I left you in Los Angelas 
 I thought I'd never see you busy 
 I thought without me you would go down 
 I thought you would never leave the city 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could 
 And you know that this drink got me talkin', late night callin, yeah 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 I'm comin' back to you, back to you 
 And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could 
 And you know that this drink got me talkin', late night callin, yeah
