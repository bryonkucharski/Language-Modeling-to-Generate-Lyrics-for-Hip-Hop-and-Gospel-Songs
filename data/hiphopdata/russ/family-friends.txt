Yeah 
 I just wanna, yeah, yeah 
 I just wanna, mmm 
 Yeah, still goin' 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend 
 Uh, bitch tryna play me for a fool 
 Life's too good, I don't give a fuck 
 Don't really know what's up with you 
 Everybody know what's up with Russ 
 New sex symbol, plus he's rich 
 'Cause a hit song, that young boy lit 
 Got a couple plaques, I just showed up 
 Give me some time, no rush 
 I ain't gon' lie, this patience paid its toll 
 Mmm, fuck my actions, I got A-lists on my phone 
 Mmm, I got money but I spend it on the memories 
 I don't pipe, girl, I'm gon' be here for a century 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend 
 I keep to myself, I don't get too close to strangers 
 You might see me comin' but you cannot see the gangsters 
 That's all I'ma say, 100k when it's show time 
 I did this myself, I'm my own co-sign 
 Dropped so many singles, I ain't never take a word break 
 You ain't hit a triple, lot of rappers born on third base 
 I just got plaques for my family and my friends too 
 Just to let them know success is possible for them too 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend 
 Whoa, I don't wanna bitch 
 I just wanna help the people that I came up with 
 That includes my family, that includes my friends 
 If you not with us then don't pretend
