I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 Yeah, a lot's changed but I'm still the same me 
 I'd still rather make a song than go to KOD 
 I'm still a boss, I make everyone wait on me 
 I'm still tellin' mom and dad to put the weight on me, I got it 
 But according to the haters, they're a cheat code 
 But if they were rich, then why'd the cars get repo'd 
 Fuck the rappers who pretend to be amigos 
 But want to see me finito like Pacino and Carlito 
 Plus these women want exploitable dick 
 I can't let the pussy drive me off avoidable cliffs 
 I been there, done that 
 Got the T-shirt and burned it 
 I studied for this shit, I did the research and learned it 
 Everything I'm getting right now, I deserve it 
 Everything that's bottled up is coming to the surface 
 I can look and see that the world is malnourished 
 They're hungry for some real shit, and bitch I'm about to serve it 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 Yeah, every week when the stats come in 
 All these bass and recorders turn to plaques and M's 
 I had to devise a plan for us to get high standards 
 I like wire transfers and (?) dancers, yeah 
 Gettin' on was hard, stayin' on is strenuous 
 Paranoid, I'm thinkin' everyone's disingenuous 
 Shots from the outside keep gettin' sent to us 
 We don't give a fuck about cliquein' up, y'all ain't friends to us 
 This is not pretend to us, this is non-fiction 
 I been makin' beats since y'all were bumpin' Sean Kingston 
 Never gave a fuck about my high school test score 
 Just bought a mansion and my high school's next door 
 Wave to the principal, wave to the teachers 
 I ran on the field, haters stayed in the bleachers 
 Now my show's louder than the football game 
 Now I'm goin' apeshit, I'm on my Jane Goodall wave 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I'm tryna clear my head more, I know that I don't sleep enough 
 I should call my dad more, I know that we don't speak enough 
 Adjustin' to the fame, sometimes he's not discreet enough 
 I'm tryna run the game, I hope me will be enough 
 But fuck y'all 
 Most of y'all talkin' ain't got the balls to do what I do 
 Don't worry about me, all my homies want to fight you 
 Power's omnipresent, I'm the stranger right beside you 
 The universe sees everything, trust me, it'll find you 
 Path to the billions in the road that I'm walkin' on 
 Rappers playin' dress-up, the game looks like Comic-Con 
 Y'all ain't sayin' shit, na na na, na na na 
 I'm Badu with the hits, on and on, on and on 
 Bet your girl's car got Russ in the system 
 You don't feel yourself unless there's drugs in your system 
 I'ma be 80 makin' hits, I'm not lyin' 
 I see a lot of people get rich and stop tryin' 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty 
 I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me 
 I keep the same people that's been 'round me 
 I keep my wits 'bout me 
 Especially right now, I got a rich bounty
