Guess I'm finally right here 
 Guess there's no turning back 
 Pop star of the year, still a God with the raps 
 Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it 
 There's no turning back, back, back 
 Couple million tucked away, 25 to touch the stage 
 When I'm in L.A I'm probably in a Bentley or a Wraith 
 People tryin' to bring me down 'cause they see me goin' up 
 If you try and blame my life I'm sending people with some guns 
 I don't fuck around with that, anybody can get touched 
 Got the family on my back, you fuck around with the wrong one 
 Hope the people still relate but my music is my life and my life just changed but 
 There's no turnin' back, no 
 Guess I'm finally right here 
 Guess there's no turning back 
 Pop star of the year, still a God with the raps 
 Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it 
 There's no turning back, back, back 
 Wonder where I'm flyin next 
 Got my dad on private jets 
 Everybody got a number I might go and buy my ex 
 Sellin out across the globe, if you really want to know 
 I just made 8 figures and I'm talkin', and I'm talkin' gross 
 Not bad for a dropout, see me rollin' in a droptop 
 I can't stop no not now, 10 years I finally got hot 
 Hope the people still relate but my music is my life and my life just changed but 
 There's no turnin' back, no 
 Guess I'm finally right here 
 Guess there's no turning back 
 Pop star of the year, still a God with the raps 
 Whole family know I got it, guess I'm too rich to hide it 
 There's no turning back, back, back
