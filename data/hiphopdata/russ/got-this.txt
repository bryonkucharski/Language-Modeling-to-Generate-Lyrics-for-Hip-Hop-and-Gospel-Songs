Yeah, ever since, ever since, yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this 
 All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit 
 This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense 
 Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit 
 I made everything come true, I feel like my own genie 
 You would think I got middle-eastern blood by the way the girls call me habibi 
 Thirty racks just popped up in my email damn what a life 
 I just did arenas, then I had a threesome, then I counted 40 bands damn what a night 
 This is that shit I asked for, I don't take shots with squares you a backboard 
 Fuck your stance, I want stamps in my passport 
 Dance on my diss though we all want platforms 
 That's a 80s reference 
 A lotta rappers only hot for like 80 seconds 
 Don't pay me less than the promoter's makin' 
 Carry myself yeah my shoulder's ache-in 
 Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this 
 All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit 
 This is for my team though we ain't with the nonsense 
 Keep it 103 though, all we do is top shit

 I'ma get a jet, call it Netflix 'cause I'm done with commercials, yeah 
 Imma go Diemon, but I still got love for my circle, yeah 
 When I land, hotel suite, king bed with a handful of queens 
 When I make it to the top elevator goes right back down to the team 
 That's OG bossed up wisdom, no sleep insomnia 
 Talkin' to myself don't put us at the end that's obvious 
 Hope you catch that, Kylie showin love on Snapchat 
 21 hits on the way like Blackjack quicker than a flashback 
 Ever since I got this you been tryna knock this 
 All you do is pop shit you ain't really on shit
