Yeah, it's crazy 
 Yeah, I need y'all to listen 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't give up 
 Know it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't 
 Yeah 
 My parents' marriage in shambles 
 I won't lie, it hurts 
 I thought money would fix it, but it just made it get worse 
 See my dad was the man, till his job cut ties 
 He went broke, I got rich, that shit fucked with his pride 
 Yeah, I recognize it was disturbing to see 
 The family stopped turnin' to him and started turnin' to me 
 Going through it, I know he tried to hide the pain 
 If he gave up and got a job, his dad died in vain 
 'Cause his dad ran a business 
 So my dad tried to run one too but there's a difference 
 No income, my dad started losin' his confidence 
 Meanwhile everyday I got brand new accomplishments 
 At the height of my career was his lowest 
 And that's a lie, 'cause we both still goin' 
 Me up, him down, it caused a lot of angst 
 Argument got out of hand, had to call Frank 
 All my efforts ignored, he threw it all in my face 
 There's not a song long enough where I can say what I gave 
 Shit's crazy, mom couldn't believe it 
 I mean she's cried in the past, you know, threatened to leave him 
 But she never had the money to, but I got it now 
 It's bittersweet that this is how I bought my mom a house 
 Oh well, guess I should have seen it comin' 
 All the tears, all the threats, all the fightin' and fussin' 
 Hardly any lovin', way too much hate 
 Finally tried to change, mom said it's too late 
 Move out day came and went, still in shock, shit 
 Doesn't even know where my mom's new spot is 
 Wasn't the first time but this was the worst time 
 Curved by your own family is the worst kind 
 All this shit been happenin' while I was blowin' up 
 And it's still going on, now you know what's up 
 Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't give up 
 Know it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't 
 Yeah 
 I got way too much stress for any more bad press 
 Especially another lie that they make up and stretch 
 Damn, I can't lie, shit is takin' a toll 
 So much hate sent to me, some stays in my soul 
 To the point that when I walk into the booth, that's what I let out 
 Makes for good songs but mentally I'm tryna get out 
 Tryna focus on the good, not the evil 
 Can't complain, this how I always greet people 
 I'm exhausted, exasperated from the pain that I'm facin' and masquerading 
 Don't get it twisted, I'm grateful for everything 
 But the devil's still asking for a wedding ring 
 I declined, tried to focus on love 
 Tried to focus on fans, tried to focus on Russ 
 Everyday another lie, sometimes it feels like a curse 
 Sometimes it feels like necessary preparation for first 
 Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't give up 
 Know it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't 
 Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, don't give up 
 I know it rains sometimes even when it shines 
 Don't give up, no
