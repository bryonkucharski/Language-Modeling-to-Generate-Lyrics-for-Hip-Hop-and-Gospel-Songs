They let us in the rap game 
 I swear they let me in the motherfucking rap game 
 Got a chick. I call her Lola 
 She feel like the ocean 
 Likes to drink and smoke some doja 
 And I feel like smoking 
 Plus she good at charming cobras 
 I feel like I'm chosen 
 But she ain't the only one no 
 Got a chick. I call her Catia 
 She be acting bougie 
 Then she came through and topped me off 
 Now she just a groupie 
 Got the aura of the mafia 
 Her friends wish they knew me 
 But they ain't the only ones, no 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Dollar signs 
 Yeah, I know it's what they want 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Y'all ain't fooling me at all 
 I been at this shit for 9 years 
 Now they're starting to call 
 I'm a DIY pioneer 
 They tryna get involved 
 Yippee Kiyay, ah, yeah 
 'Bout to set it off 
 I'm probably the only one, yeah 
 Come correct when you approach me 
 I can size you up 
 Taking all the shots like Kobe 
 Almost 81 
 Guess I gotta play the goalie 
 And go and save me something 
 I'm probably the only one, yeah 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Dollar signs 
 Yeah I know it's what they want 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Y'all ain't fooling me at all 
 Who wants my money? I'll tell you: who I don't fuck with 
 Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets 
 What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets 
 I'm smart as fuck 
 They be talking like I'm the dumbest 
 But I know what they want from me 
 Dollars lot of stock in me 
 It ain't nothing personal 
 It's business, and I'm a commodity 
 But honestly 
 Pop Pop would be turning in his grave 
 The day I let someone else become the boss of me 
 When there's a boss in me 
 I'll be damned 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Dollar signs 
 Yeah, I know it's what they want 
 What they want, what they want, what they want 
 Y'all ain't fooling me at all
