I'm here 
 Yeah, the cash came I ain't trippin' on a past flame 
 Even if they were dimes, yo how many 10's what my last name 
 Is this the rap game or high school politics? 
 Boss could be on Maury 'cause they got a little poppin' 
 Before I show up, that's when the deposit hits 
 You only want me now, that's what I have problems with 
 Five-star sweets, Trojan wrappers on the floor 
 That's the aesthetic when you getting half a mil' on tour 
 Now I'm back for six weeks, plus I should receive my plaques soon 
 Shitting on the game, I'd probably hang it in my bathroom 
 Last June I was broke, this June I made a hundred 
 Before and after, didn't change me, though I stayed a hundred 
 Show me someone else who's doing what I'm doing 
 Singing, rapping, mix and mastering, engineer, and producer 
 That's every song with no exception, plus the catalog longer than a lot of veterans 
 Mention me amongst myself 'cause I'm the first of my kind 
 You live a Semi-Charmed Life, cause your third eyes blind 
 I'm a shepherd, not a sheep, but I heard it's my time 
 Was in the shadows for so long, I deserve all my shine 
 Got some women you would love to fuck, left her on read 
 Got some homies 'bout that arm leg, leg, arm, head 
 I should call it a night, too many women can be dangerous 
 You let 'em behind the scenes, all of a sudden they start framing us 
 I make enough to alter her perception of me 
 The older you get, the more expensive lessons will be 
 Gotta tighten up, move a little bit more militant 
 Coming down your block, looking like we copped the whole dealership 
 Penthouse suites, but couldn't tell you what city 
 Same ones who stayed down with me gon' be up with me 
 See that's the code you uphold when you know what it took to really grow into the star you all know so 
 When Bugus touch down, I got the Bentley waiting for him 
 In L.A., the next time I'd probably play the forum 
 But for now, catch me selling out the Novo 
 No debut, no openers, I'm solo 
 You're trapped in the club 'cause you can't sell tickets 
 Your album flopped and you went ahead and fell with it 
 But fuck y'all, I'm a business man 
 I'm smoking caviar off cones in my sprinter van 
 On the phone with my lawyers talking about eight digits, yeah 
 Just to be safe, even my safes got a safe in it 
 False accusations, think I'm done with the groupies 
 'Cause one bad scene can fuck up the whole movie, so 
 Fuck these hoes, man I'm out the game 
 Plus they jump around quicker than House of Payne 
 Break the bank for the family, take everyone to Waikiki 
 My homies up big in Africa, knock you out in dashikis 
 To my family, I'm Russell, to these women habibi 
 Ex's know they played themselves when they see me on TV 
 Big money offends, small minds too bad 
 I give my girls a new life, you give your girls a new bag 
 Doing interviews with Forbes 'cause the come ups amazing 
 I got a new fetish for jewelry and expensive vacations 
 I got the industry shook 
 Like "how's he's popping like this? 
 I don't know him, but he's still got 60K on his wrist" 
 Now I can't go to the mall, 'cause I'll probably get mauled 
 And I lie, I wasn't busy 
 I'm just ignoring your call 
 'Cause maybe I feel like you don't really deserve a response 
 'Cause you were curving me crazy when I was trying to get on 
 Now I'm fresh up in the game, and I already went gold 
 'Cause I gave them what they want now they losing control 
 Had to do it myself, pull the trigger on my dreams 
 Always knew that this what happen, manifested everything 
 Now they gon' write about me 
 Like they were right about me 
 Some people looking like they wanna snatch the white up out me 
 That's new to me, forgive me for being jaded to my race, but I been color blind 
 That wasn't just a mixtape 
 Yeah, one of eleven, I put out eleven 
 Produced, mixed, mastered, and engineered, written by me 
 Yeah, this just the beginning though 
 Yeah, debut shit
