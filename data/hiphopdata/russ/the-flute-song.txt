Legend 
 People keep talkin' 
 I don't believe (yeah) 
 I do whatever I want, whenever I want, I love it 
 People keep talkin', I just keep winning 
 I'm just like "Fuck it" 
 They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they're bluffin' 
 They just want clout, I'm just so poppin' 
 I'm just like "Fuck it" 
 Everybody tryna get a rise out of me (yeah) 
 Ex girls tryna get a "Hi" out of me (yeah) 
 I don't talk back 'less you're worthy (no) 
 Hangin' plaques up like jerseys (sauce) 
 25 actualized, I'm me 
 My family relies on me 
 Treat 5 stars like my home though 
 Walk around in slippers and robes though 
 They ain't upholding the code, the industry full of some hoes 
 They lettin' like anything go 
 People are shady as fuck 
 I keep to myself, but I feel the energy though 
 None of these people are friends to me though 
 I don't put anything past them 
 I don't see none of y'all next to me though 
 I think they mad that I passed them 
 I do whatever I want, whenever I want 
 I love it (woo, woo) 
 People keep talkin', I just keep winning 
 I'm just like "Fuck it" 
 They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they bluffin' (they just be talkin') 
 They just want clout, I'm just so poppin' 
 I'm just like "Fuck it" (yeah, yeah) 
 I do whatever I want, whenever I want 
 I love it (woo, woo) 
 People keep talkin', I just keep winning

 They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they bluffin' (they just be talkin') 
 They just want clout, I'm just so poppin'

 I been goin' hard on my Kobe number 8 shit 
 Course they're gonna hate but I signed up for greatness 
 That comes with the territory, ain't no way around it, I know that 
 I been way up in the Hills reflectin', I cannot go back 
 Beverly Hills, skyline view 
 I move smart, got a high IQ 
 Right next to me where you find my crew 
 All of them fight, bitch, I fight too 
 Highlight moves every time I play 
 I get what I want every time I pray 
 I be doin' good but they don't wanna talk about it 
 If you really got a grip with my life I say 
 I do whatever I want, whenever I want 
 I love it (woo, woo) 
 People keep talkin', I just keep winning 
 I'm just like "Fuck it" 
 They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they bluffin' (they just be talkin')
