Take my hand and rock it real slow 
 I wanna feel your love tonight 
 Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights 
 I'm all about us tonight 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again 
 Yeah, tried to give you everything, I was thinking wedding ring 
 You were cheating every chance you got while I was faithful 
 Then you went with who you, told me not to worry 'bout 
 Now you got a baby with him, damn, that could've been me 
 Can't say that I hate you, if I had the money 
 That I have now, would've taken you away from 
 Everything that killed us, would have seen the real us 
 Now I'm scared of falling in love again 
 Take my hand and rock it real slow 
 I wanna feel your love tonight 
 Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights 
 I'm all about us tonight 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again 
 Yeah, tryna help you see the truth 
 But you prolly won't look 
 I just wanna hear your story 
 Like a audio book 
 You knew me before my ex, yeah 
 We stayed at the W, yeah 
 Better now fuck my name up 
 Like a substitute, yeah 
 I can tell you wanna do it but you don't know how to do it 
 'Cause you're scared to death 
 You can tell I wanna do it but I don't know how to do it 
 'Cause I'm scared to death 
 We should grab each other's hands and take a jump off the cliff 
 And hope we fly 
 Then you pause and I pause and we look at each other 
 But we both know why 
 Take my hand and rock it real slow 
 I wanna feel your love tonight 
 Let's put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights 
 I'm all about us tonight 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again 
 Ooh, I'm scared to fall in love again
