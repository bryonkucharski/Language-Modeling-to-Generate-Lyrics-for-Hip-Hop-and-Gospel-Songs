Yeah 
 Just 'cause I don't say anythin' doesn't mean I don't see it 
 Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah) 
 It's funny how they change up quick 
 It's funny how they act now 
 It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit 
 I'm laughin' like lalalalalala 
 Nanananananananana 
 Nananananana 
 It's funny how they act now 
 Yeah, I'm tryna go on my phone less and less these days 
 And I don't talk to women 'less it's sex these days 
 I'm on my second presidential Rolex these days 
 I could chill but I would rather flex these days 
 Man, I'm blessed these days, never forget these days 
 Took a lot of long nights, just to get these days 
 And to be honest, I think I'm the best these days 
 You got now but I think that I'm next these days 
 Follow my gut, I never second guess these days 
 I pass my test 'cause all I see is checks these days 
 Say it direct these days with your chest these days 
 Got some real life monsters on the text these days 
 I saw the gross but I wonder what you net these days 
 A few legends but way too many trends these days 
 I'm not impressed these days, I invest these days 
 Runnin' the game but you won't ever see me sweat these days 
 I might attend these days, I invent these days 
 I do me at all times, I don't regret these days 
 I be gettin' everybody's girl wet these days 
 People quiet 'cause they know I'm a threat these days, yeah 
 Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah) 
 It's funny how they change up quick 
 It's funny how they act now 
 It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit 
 I'm laughin' like lalalalalala

 It's funny how they act now 
 Yeah, uh, I'm diplomatic when I have to be 
 I got like 20 women mad at me, damn 
 150 on me casually 
 Didn't happen over night, I had to do this shit up gradually 
 Hope they see the truth is what I tell myself 
 No one felt me until I felt myself 
 These poppin' girls got way too many rapper bodies 
 I can't wife a girl who's fucked half of my colleagues 
 This is for every dude that hates me 
 'Cause women wanna date me 
 I put in work, I earned my stripes 
 I'm like the Yankees 
 I swear lately I been tryna wrap my head around this life 
 Used to sleep on couches, now it's thousand for the night 
 I'm winnin', you losin', I know that it irks you 
 European flag shit, I got stars in my circle 
 Look at my life, look at my come up, look how far that I made it 
 Honestly, if you don't feel inspired by it, you hatin' 
 Your first and last name don't mean shit 
 So I got women that I only know by zip code 
 I was down to stunt with you, now I gotta stunt on you 
 Nanananananana 
 Mmm, it's funny how they act now (yeah) 
 It's funny how they change up quick 
 It's funny how they act now 
 It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit
