She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl 
 She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl 
 She's falling but she doesn't think you'll catch her 
 Cause her last relationship was a disaster 
 Accusations everyday she didn't know why 
 All her calls would be ignored he's on his own time 
 Shoulda' ended it before it started 
 All she ever got was broken hearted 
 He was cheating on her tryna' flip it 
 Back on her like a victim 
 Now she's all alone and starting over 
 Now she's got baggage on her shoulder 
 But the new guy really loves her 
 She loves him but she doesn't trust herself anymore 
 She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl 
 She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl 
 Despite her past she can't help the attraction 
 He tells her that he's nothing like the last one 
 He redefines in every way what love is 
 She fell for him and hasn't gotten' up since 
 Every now and then she goes off though 
 Beating on his chest like a bongo 
 He understands she's coming from a hurt place 
 Answers all the questions on her survey 
 Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust 
 Doesn't call a hoe after hang ups 
 Gives her everything she ever wanted 
 And even though she still feels haunted 
 She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl 
 She's fallin' in love now 
 Losin' control now 
 Fightin' the truth 
 Tryin' to hide 
 But I think it's alright girl 
 Yeah, I think it's alright girl
