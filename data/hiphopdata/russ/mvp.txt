Yeah 
 Make money off of bein' myself 
 Get a glimpse of my potential, I believe in myself 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams 
 The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep 
 I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit 
 Hooks, beats and verses, every song I score a hat trick 
 Always said I'd never sign but lately, I been tempted 
 'Cause my dad just asked for gas money, my mom just said she spent it 
 It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life 
 But desperation breeds a beast, the truth won't always be polite 
 So I'm fresh up off the flight, headed towards a life boat 
 Hope their word has good credit like a FICO 
 Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time 
 How long you gonna keep your star player on the sidelines? 
 But, I'm the coach, guess God is the owner 
 Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder 
 Tellin' me to go in, I'ma stop the game 
 Blow the whistle like Snowden, young Terrell Owens 
 Makin' noise, still one of the greats though 
 I never RIP, I want MVP written on my gravestone 
 Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show 
 One man army, when I sing, I get Tank hoes 
 Yeah, you know that R&B freak love 
 Weed so loud, I need you all to speak up 
 I hope every album that I drop has Carter 3 buzz 
 Wake up, I'm tryna live a life you couldn't dream of 
 I'm careful with who I include in all of this 
 'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships 
 Went to college for a semester 
 All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone 
 I'm not like everybody, so I left 
 My mom still supported but she was upset 
 Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset 
 She got to watch her son light up the whole spot 
 Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot 
 Different women, different offers every day now 
 I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now 
 'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer 
 Made 100 thousand in the past hour 
 It's been a whirlwind, let me hit the blunt with you 
 Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues 
 Damn, or maybe past relationships, did that 
 I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back 
 But, fuck it, 'cause I'm on to new things 
 I looked up at the sky, long enough, I grew wings 
 Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you 
 God forbid that happens, breakdowns create break throughs 
 I'm sittin' on the debut, sounds like your greatest hits 
 Labels tryna eat, so of course they want a stake in it 
 And of course they talk of money, so of course I entertain this shit 
 Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit 
 I'm patient with my process, weighin' all my options 
 Y'all talkin' way too much, all these phone calls sound like auctions 
 Funny 'cause you used to laugh when I would say I'm ready 
 Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me 
 When I'm standin' where I knew I would, number 1 spot 
 Another year, another rapper, yeah, another one flop 
 Y'all barely fuckin' the game, you on the scene for 5 minutes 
 Then you bust and it's over, I'm a movie, you're just a snippet 
 This that '89 Pistons, fuck the game up, get rings shit 
 Name your favorite rapper, bet I got him on my hit list 
 Name your dream girl, bet I end up on her wish list 
 Tell me how you want it, beast raps, or I could sing shit 
 It's time to wake up, industry full of hypnotists 
 I speak for myself, I don't need a ventriloquist 
 I need a vacation to where the real people live 
 You just stay on vacation, havin' real ego trips 
 You don't wanna admit, that without you I'd be fine 
 But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride 
 That goes for the girls I swooped in on 
 Made their brain drool, they gave top with a bib on 
 Always keep my switch on, watch me illuminate 
 Up at the studio, Drake is just a room away 
 Maybe I should barge in, maybe I should wait 
 This gon' be a funny story couple months from today 
 When I tell it, and it's like 
 Damn, yup
