Yeah. This beat is crazy, shout out to me. All you little fuckin', uh, D League, peasant, tier 98-ass rappers and little clickbait-ass journalists and shit, y'all can suck my dick. I never even met y'all man, y'all so fuckin' obsessed. I'm on some kill everybody shit, fuck y'all 
 Yeah, I've been withholdin', I really feel like explodin' 
 People pokin', provokin', I'm suffocating, I'm chokin' 
 The feeling that no one gets it, I just try to suppress it 
 I really need to express it, I really should reinvest it and go off 
 Off, off on you bitches 
 I wonder why these fuckin' grown men always talkin' like bitches 
 Y'all so obsessed with me, I've never even talked to you bitches 
 I'd run you over with my Lambo, wouldn't stop for you bitches 
 I'm at my breaking point, I can wave and point 
 And you'll start breaking joints so loudly, exclamation point 
 Rappers takin' bribes, they be shavin' points 
 I see the game from every game, I be playin' point 
 I be playin' coach, I be playin' owner 
 I be playin' fan, and I play promoter 
 Gettin' great exposure from all the hate, y'all are hustling backwards 
 This goes for anybody and any bum-ass rapper, pussy 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Yeah 
 Any rapper can get it, I'm sending headshots, headshots 
 You can't talk to me if you can't sell out Red Rocks, Red Rocks 
 That's ten thousand, watch your mouth when you speak 'bout your superiors 
 Premeditated murder, I'm plottin' with my Nigerians (Yes, oh) 
 Peekin' through you, chiefin' and eating fufu 
 We see what this dreamin' grew to, arenas in Honolulu 
 Doin' streams like I'm Hulu, label talks via Bluetooth 
 People tryna do voodoo, this zoo is making me coo-coo 
 And fuck the media and the politics in this industry 
 The snakes and the lies and the gossip in this industry 
 And fuck these WWE-ass rappers 
 High school mentality, glee-ass rappers 
 Fake family ties, y'all say brother too much 
 Y'all get played by the same women, y'all say you love her too much 
 And y'all be runnin' from the truth, y'all take cover too much 
 I'm gettin' tired of this shit, man, enough is enough 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Yeah 
 Rappers dissin' for attention that the music ain't gettin' 
 I understand, it's frustratin' watching my (?) 
 Watching arenas sell out, watching my plaques multiply 
 When you don't headline a tour, and when you drop they don't buy 
 But you got followers though, but what they followin' for 
 But that's 'cause most of them are fake, let me let your followers know 
 That y'all be payin' social media agencies twenty thou' every month 
 Just to comment, like, and follow your account 
 It's all a front, y'all are glorified Instagram entertainers 
 Got millions of followers, but can't even sell out your basement 
 Y'all droppin' antics and skits 'cause you can't drop a hit 
 Flashin' jewelry, posting lean, poppin' Xanax for clicks 
 Infatuated with designer, costume shop carollers 
 Bunch of crackheads and clowns, bunch of Boondocks characters 
 Damn, y'all not scarin' us with your Internet loose lips 
 I be at the same festival and y'all don't do shit 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Now you leave me no choice 
 I have to kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Kill 'em all (kill 'em all) 
 Man, I don't even like that it's this easy to write whole songs and shit about this type of shit. Sometimes you just gotta get it off your chest though. I hope the fans understand that sometimes I really be tryna leave this shit, man. I miss my old shit sometimes. Fuck it
