I wanna go down with you, baby 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Wanna pull the trigger with you 
 I wanna slow dance while they're screaming 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Wanna take you with me 
 You are all that I need 
 And you are all I believe 
 'Cause everything fine 
 'Cause you ain't gotta leave 
 I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you 
 Yeah, she said love me when you're ready, not when you're lonely 
 I don't know myself, so there's no way you know me 
 But if I hold you down, then you better hold me 
 But if I call your bluff, then you better fold me 
 'Cause I can't risk it all for you 
 If you don't see that I'm all for you, oh 
 You are all that I need 
 And you are all I believe 
 'Cause everything fine 
 'Cause you ain't gotta leave 
 I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you 
 Oh, bad girl 
 Why is everything going backwards? 
 Drinking, rolling up a couple Backwoods 
 Every day we argue, that's a bad look 
 Yeah, song in the key of hope, sing it for me 
 Cup full of love, drink it for me 
 I rather deal with oh wells than what ifs 
 You got me addicted off of one hit 
 You are all that I need 
 And you are all I believe 
 'Cause everything fine 
 'Cause you ain't gotta leave 
 I wanna go down, down, down, down, down with you
