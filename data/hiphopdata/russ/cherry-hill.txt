You know what I'd do for you 
 I know what you'd do for me 
 You will see 
 The truth in me 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Feelin' lonely in this room since I was seventeen 
 Thought this bottle was supposed to drown my memory 
 But I'm still swimmin' in your vision and it's temptin' me 
 But next time that I call I'm hopin' that you answer me 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 You know what I'd do for you 
 I know what you'd do for me 
 You will see 
 The truth in me 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 I'm looking for the place 
 Where I was falling into you 
 Dressed in sunlight, warmed the cold 
 That lived inside me 
 We shouldn't be here 
 What we said 
 When we were 
 The top of Cherry Hill 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 You know what I'd do for you 
 I know what you'd do for me 
 You will see 
 The truth in me 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Maybe I'm a fool for you
