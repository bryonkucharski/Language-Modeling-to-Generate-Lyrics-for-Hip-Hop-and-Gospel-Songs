 Oh, uh-oh, you ready L? Aight, let's go 
 Uh, uh, uh... 
 Ladies shout my name 'cause I'm sweet like sugar water 
 Some call me daddy 'cause I treat 'em like my daughter 
 They'll rush out my name and refer to me as Posi' 
 When I make love I come with like a kamikaze 
 I don't return till the mission is completed 
 And that's a treat when you're properly treated 
 Now don't - say I'm conceited, say I'm convinced 
 My momma called me nasty and I was ever since 
 At school they voted me the one most likely who would 
 But never realized that I'd be so damn good 
 Swift and interchangeable, yet remaindable 
 Rhymes intoxicate ya when it spins on the turntable 
 And get you high, higher than a skyscraper 
 When I gets rough, it's rougher than sandpaper 
 The brother's still frontin, still front to flex 
 Wouldn't squeeze the trigger, on a bottle, of Windex 
 Uh, and ya don't stop
