 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers 
 Speak on it now 
 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers 
 Uh, uh! I call girls carhoppers 
 'Cause I make 'em hit notes like they was singin' at the operas 
 May I say, on anyday, yeah they with it 
 They're in a Yugo, if you got the Yugo kitted (say what?) 
 Stand by your man, yes that's what they all claim 
 You don't have a car? Then you're fucked up in the game 
 They'll walk by ya, and say hiya 
 Is he drivin' 'cause he cute? Oh no, his shit is tired (oh no) 
 And they'll turn like you got the virus 
 Cause you didn't have a car, or the one had there wasn't flyest 
 But for the record I'm not trickin 
 But you can call me Timex, 'cause I'll still take the lickin' 
 So if you're hot and bothered, or in a frenzy 
 I'll pop _The Mack_ soundtrack in the Benzy 
 And you can tell me how you choose me baby 
 Baby, this no time for you, to act crazy 
 You can't play me, not like Play-Doh 
 Don't leave me for the kid honey, in the Laredo (speak on it) 
 But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her 
 That's the lifestyles of the carhoppers 
 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (uh!)

 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (yeah) 
 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers 
 Mmm, uh! A yeah baby, things is kinda swivey 
 Ever since my dad put me up on his Rivi-era 
 Now I see things much clearer 
 When I'm in my ride, women wanna be nearer to the 
 Showstopper, yeah the profiteerer 
 Uh, excuse me honey, it's not nice to stare 
 Dare, if you wanna get with this here 
 Put on your best gear, and step to the rear 
 I'll be there, say about 10:30 
 And know that don't be late honey cause my beeper, is loaded 
 And, if you're not there, by the toot of the horn 
 [BEEP] (kick it) Uh, I'm gone... carhoppers! 
 Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (hey)

 Uh, now you think things is right; 'cause she's on 
 The next man's gooseneck and suckin his exhaust pipe 
 She's got him and he's got an erection 
 Just because of his fuel injection, system 
 All before yeah she used to diss him 
 Now she knows money on down to his pistons 
 And his engine, or let's say his chassis 
 Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie 
 Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo 
 If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo (once again, break it down) 
 They got more promises than Thomases 
 And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous 
 But I know, where to send em 
 Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem
