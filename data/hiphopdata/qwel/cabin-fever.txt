Just when I can't take no more 
 Staring in the face of when it rains it pours 
 The snake scraping straight through the stains 
 To sores like fade ain't weight 
 But tryin' to break my door 
 It's like the more I shake, the more I hate this floor 
 I hate this life with ice my main supports 
 Ignore inner advice to slice my veins for sport 
 Denying my pride just like I ain't the sort 
 When that's a lie I'm as weak as the pay reports 
 Thirty days on the road, ain't made a buck 
 And tryin' to save my voice 
 Hoist away at my ego, me my favorite choice 
 Just like we made our graves but probably blame our boys 
 As I turn this graying page, gaining fame to avoid 
 Today the same day again just like I anchored this void 
 Can't measure all the treasures that this pain done destroyed 
 I painted it, avoided naming it for blame it'd employed 
 Came and hit me like a gypsy, tipsy, claiming it's coin 
 Did me like windy city misery with grace of the ancients 
 Prayin' for Nathan but the will to see the will for the faithless 
 Gave it to me as a gift to do the will of the faithless 
 And gave it to me as a gift if you want it take it 
 I couldn't leave it, how those motherfuckin' cheeibum sang it 
 Bangin' in my soul, takin' it's control, total freedom 
 A man within this whole, not shown alone 
 But shone the kingdom and Jesus sacred throne 
 Over cherebum singin' and here I am a man 
 Just to stand and receive Him 
 And all I am is a man in the flash in this pan 
 We wallow in depression, stressed to face the odds 
 That's 'cause while we in this flesh, we away from God 
 Heads will hollow out your blessin's, lessons they been taught 
 Came from guessin' ass professions that them laymen bought 
 It's outta reason how them demons try to stray you off 
 Ain't got a thing that they believe in save the way 
 That they walk, it's bullshit like any men claiming 
 That they ain't wrong like it's all the same, it ain't 
 When we done sang new songs 
 I hold it closer than my name and my life 
 Than I cling to my wife and know it's higher 
 Than the rain at it's heights messiah's throne 
 Who shone it brighter than a ray of froze light 
 Kept me going on the longest of roads and 
 On the coldest of nights and then it showed me 
 This mic just like it told me to write and dog 
 You owe it your life like you control it 
 Just notice if it wasn't for his light no one would notice 
 The light that you opposin' is the life that you holdin' 
 Playin' with his might in handing frost bite to the frozen 
 See in his works within the earth or universe if your chosen 
 Teachers learnin' freezer burner lurkin' fumes to the focus 
 When we searched it seen it perfect just remember who spoke it 
 We wallow in depression, stressed to face the odds 
 That's 'cause while we in this flesh, we away from God 
 Heads will hollow out your blessin's, lessons they been taught 
 Came from guessin' ass professions that them laymen bought 
 It's outta reason how them demons try to stray you off 
 Ain't got a thing that they believe in, save the way that 
 They walk, it's bullshit like any men claiming 
 That they ain't wrong like it's all the same 
 It ain't when we done sang new songs
