For when it all falls down around the shoulders of soldiers 
 And preachers and leaders and teachers y'all can tell 'em who told 'em 
 We wore our souls like the sneakers that keeps our feet from the embers 
 They swept the streets with our scars, the starving body remembers 
 Recollect upon his corners, gotta get it if it's possible 
 But lots of little fools just fell in December 
 Whatever, opt to stop and rob him cruel 
 Same shit kept him out of school 
 Movin' rocks or swoopin' cops that kept him chained to the weather 
 It never changes it seems, this hole keeps burrowing deeper 
 Dirty heaps getting higher messiah dying to reach us 
 The leaders hiding behind us, pretend their minds are on Jesus 
 When miles of fetuses dying between the lies that they feed us 
 Teachers buyin' it and sellin' it, pin naive to the genius 
 The child's eyes ain't seen the wind but his mind can perceive it 
 Receive the secrets of life and be a light through this bleakness 
 Use the teachin's of right and truth to fight through this weakness 
 When all passes to ashes with the cash that we gathered 
 Can cats imagine reactions after we add up what mattered 
 Man the chatter among us will numb our ears to the shatterin' 
 Rattlin', nashin' of teeth resounding ringing like Saturn 
 Patterned, circling excuses used as tools would just shatter 
 Because we knew the truth but humans wanted proof on a platter 
 With loosened grips that grabbed for dollars hollered oops from the ladder 
 Scattered the youth at the bottom amidst the bruised and the battered 
 With twisted music and rappers preoccupied with his fashions 
 And cynic lying politicians tied and blinded with taxes 
 Actin' thugs, cuttin' in winding lines to climb in his casket 
 Madness the sign of the times, messiah dyin' to catch us 
 Why we tryin' eye on the prize and dyin' to ask it 
 If cats is fine with it, fine if not then why ain't we after it 
 It's like we rather just laugh or pass and nap or rap a bit 
 Or haggle over trash and die to try and cash it in
