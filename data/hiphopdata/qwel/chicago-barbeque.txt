UHH 
 Qwel 
 Summer heat stroke 
 Have a heat stroke 
 So this one joe goes there was this flow that boasts he totes a gun 
 Don't know his promo caught some fingers up till he saw both of them 
 But now his shit is jaded 
 Played himself, hes gonna see me 
 Checked me once, stepped, said what's up, and copped another CD 
 Me be hell breathing back 
 He needs to ask to spar with qwel 
 Start to scar your shell toes 
 I suppose its hard to tell 
 The battles half the lesson 
 The cats strapped with automat four sevens 
 Beat you half to death twice 
 Send white light back for seconds 
 Rest when less than me ain't good enough 
 Hoods and thugs rough wont cut it 
 What if all this tough rug thug stuff ain't really what what is 
 Is it my job to own this fucking mic until it starts to melt 
 The dark starts to yell 
 I suppose its hard to tell 
 Start to yell back 
 But there's not enough mics to rock 
 He likes to flow 
 But the dikes are locked 
 On his writing spot 
 There's too many MC's 
 And not enough mics to rock 
 He like to flow 
 But the dikes he like to strike with mics are locked a lot 
 There was this other joe once 
 Covered in gold front ego 
 I'm butter with mics 
 He stutters with ice 
 And wonder where that weed go 
 He showed prose in his time 
 Compose lies his rib cage 
 Hungry not just for my mic 
 Blocked every blow with his face 
 And now he spits with a limp 
 And thinks his shits a zeplin 
 The blimps his head wet to the ground gassed 
 Drowned, and unleaded 
 Found his rep, disconnected 
 His best shit was pantomime! 
 Jagged his chance to shine impressed 
 He left a fan of mine 
 Grab the mic for sale 
 And barter rap to use 
 But lost to qwel again 
 Who had to snag an autograph for proof ... 
 Just one more time ... 
 Just one more time ... 
 For the last time ... 
 Caught a heat stroke ... 
 Man second hand contact is cancerous 
 The trouble with guessin is 
 Doublin questions is 
 All the answers did 
 Ask your man to spit, shit 
 We bendove 
 No shenanigans 
 Brandishin claims you fucked inannimate 
 Nope the pen broke 
 But ain't it grand makin' mannequin 
 Canned amusement 
 And all the while, man 
 The fans can't stand the music 
 The producers credits is 
 With the critics rappin' crevices 
 Offensive 
 Get in line 
 We help design them flippin fetishes 
 The measurements are evidence ain't nobody tight 
 'Cause when he spit veterans bite like, oh but hes right 
 Insight precise incisions witness witty wisdom like 
 The system bustin' out the seams with dreams are lived in this mind
