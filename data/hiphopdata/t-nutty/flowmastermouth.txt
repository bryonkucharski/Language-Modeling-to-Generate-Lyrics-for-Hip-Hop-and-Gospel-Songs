Aww man... whattt 
 That nigga said he gassed T-Nutty 
 Awww man them niggaz is... awww 
 Should I enter the battle mode 
 And spit like a calico weapon 
 With the definition of mic checkin' 
 And rippin it to the last second 
 My nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth 
 Now first of all, I got a verse for y'all 
 And I'm a serve it raw, well now my nerve are calm 
 Fixin to switch into battle mode, and drop a bomb 
 Yellin' Geronimo, look out for y'all 
 Like troops we shoot 
 Lyrical bullets and poop gas, for the loot 
 Every syllable fully produced 
 Rap on you dudes, 'cause we mentally bullies 
 Who thinks you could fuck wit me 
 When I get my ass off the curb 
 And get to rappin' fast with the words 
 I'm just a little bastard concerned 
 So I stall on niggaz 
 And stick to the bottom, of bottle 
 To feel my thirst, rock with me 
 I'm figna to bring the knock, to the street 
 Like a trunk bringin' knocks, to the beats 
 Knockin' niggaz of they feet 
 When they walk they walk 
 'Cause they say that talk is cheap 
 I think you better watch, how you talk to me 
 I come from the block, where they cock the heat 
 With a passion, lookin' up to niggaz that be gastin 
 Givin' up the neighborhood, and other niggaz kiss our asses 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck about you 
 All my buddies do the nutty kung fu 
 Choppin niggaz down, from the town 
 Where the kings were a crown 
 Gettin' money, 'cause we love who we do 
 Sometimes I laugh 
 'Cause I'm the one, that dumpin through the lynchin 
 Because of my tongue, back flippin, they trippin' 
 'Cause I got more heat, than the fifty with me 
 Seekin' me, rippin these niggaz, with a sentence 
 I'm a go nuts, when it start to get intense 
 Flippin the script, steady comin' with the viscous 
 Ty gone cut you, like barb wire fences 
 Should I enter the battle mode 
 And spit like a calico weapon 
 With the definition of mic checkin' 
 And rippin it to the last second 
 My nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth 
 Recognize I got the antidote 
 To get you amped, and locced 
 You niggaz rap, I hope 
 You got to practice folks, I'm like a master 
 Givin' up the nut factor, if you askin hoe 
 Fast or slow, I'm a gas the whole spot 
 You might be a hog, but you live in the pork chop 
 That I feed my dogs, ????????, and young bop 
 And the flowheekin, named fleezo 
 Hot with the lyricals, cop you the minerals 
 Eat up the spot, like a fat boy 
 Invite her to dinner bro 
 Even if we shined identical 
 I'm a, hit 'em with the flow, master mouth 
 I'm dirty like, down south 
 I murder you, when I pronounce south 
 Every verbal feud, I'm a bounce south 
 Get to serve a fool, 'cause I refuse to lose 
 'Cause I'm a nigga from cali, so peep game 
 Throwin' up the w, trouble, who wanna bang 
 As if I'm in a diskette, this some shit 
 That make niggaz, flip you off 
 And try to rip you off, sit and floss 
 Like they spittin' raw 
 But they never go against, the boss 
 Because I rip the bar, and if ya gettin' lost 
 I'm too sick for y'all 
 Run up on me, and the clipse are tossed 
 Then I'm dippin off 
 'Cause I'm tryin' to stay ahead, of the game 
 Gettin' breaded, for my name 
 Fuckin' with the, black armor 
 I'm attackin harder, with the gat to harm ya 
 So watch, yo mouth 
 'Cause I'm takin' off, on you woofin 
 I know that you soft, as a cushion 
 You floss, when the hoes lookin' 
 But scared to go, two can come to the flow 
 When you step into, a cold whoopin 
 Should I enter the battle mode 
 And spit like a calico weapon 
 With the definition of mic checkin' 
 And rippin it to the last second 
 My nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth 
 When its bumpin, like this 
 Its hard, to stop it 
 Humpin like a, hound dog 
 When home girl, pop it 
 Ready to knock it 
 I done shocked it 
 I'm T-Nutty 
 But my buddies, call me cutty 
 With the 350, rocket 
 I put my money, deep in my pocket 
 At the same tame, poppin' my collar 
 When the party is on, listen, madam 
 Do you mind, double touchin the bone 
 I wasn't tryin' to, start trouble 
 By touchin ya thong, I'm gone 
 Should I switch into, battle mode 
 And spit, like a calico weapon 
 With the definition, of mic checkin' 
 And rippin it, to the last second 
 I got 'em thinkin', of stabbin 
 Or rippin, the session 
 Excuse me, if I make it a mess 
 But guess what, its T-Nutty 
 I'm one of the best 
 And yes, I'm gonna confess 
 Like the rest, of my people 
 My niggaz, that be runnin' niggaz over like a diesel 
 Got everybody humpin, the same way the beat go 
 Makin' it a gangsta party 
 Cause there's nobody wit us, but hoody rats and killaz 
 Actin' silly, I'm a philly 
 Accidently spill you apart 
 Excuse my pardon, turn my car to garden 
 Turf is deeper, than the black man's million march 
 I'm perved, ready to twerk 
 I'm legal with betty first 
 But I'm not stickin to the chevy with her 
 'Cause she don't got her purse, and first of all 
 I'm sippin the pommason, blowin' the bomb 
 I'm in the middle of the pond 
 And can't tell the different between, a duck and swan 
 Homegirl shake it on, but after the break it down 
 I gotta be out, further down the road 
 Drop the bomb and it might explode 
 T-Nutty's nut, cuttin' up 
 Switch into battle mode 
 Should I enter the battle mode 
 And spit like a calico weapon 
 With the definition of mic checkin' 
 And rippin it to the last second 
 My nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth
