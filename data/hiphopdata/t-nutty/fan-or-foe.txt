Back up wait a minute 
 Why you looking at me like that 
 Do you really wanna trip or you flip in the script 
 Do you wanna rap with a nigga 
 Or bang is a whoop in a rip 
 I don't eva want us to come the bust and shots, nigga misery can't produce enough cops and a' 
 Don't know if you wallin' or what? 
 All you wanna do is free stopping cop 
 Fan or Foe I don't really know 
 Off at the show niggas they know 
 But I look light, was a good night and I was looking like a mutha fukka wanna jack all me doe 
 Come up to me 
 My kids would be chillin' 
 Betta think twice I'm a 5-6 villain 
 All they wanna talk about 
 I did it 
 When I did it 
 Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute 
 You Should be care full how you walk upon us 
 Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it 
 I know they wait for Tecca Ninna moments 
 Till the opponent be poppin' up and he's you don't it 
 We don't if they be tripin' or not (NO) 
 Probably 'cause all of them live on the block 
 When you rapping niggas know what you got 
 Toughest ever, when you up on the top 
 Show some respect when you approach me 
 Don't you be mugging me 
 Might have that drug in me 
 Plug in a nigga, for nearly shrugging me 
 Ain't nothing wrong with people peeping, Geeking 
 Where the man hoe 
 But the grandma so bama, stama 
 I don't know if you fan or foe 
 (Chorus Repeat 2X) 
 We be tripin', we can go 
 Peeping like he's seeking doe 
 Want the doe or want to go 
 I don't know if you fan or foe 
 I don't know if you fan or foe 
 I don't know if you fan or foe 
 Easy, hang and speak and brawl 
 I don't know if he fan or foe 
 Now easy how they speak 
 With broken teeth 
 That they did, young flow he can dope be choken 
 So yo' ass and you be walking off with it broken 
 Run up poor muthafukas in the open 
 Making them shut up 
 Woofing with that cold shit 
 Can't that shinanigans 
 Thinking you makes it the manikans 
 Thinking you silking the lotion 
 Back up wait a minute why you looking at me like that 
 I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame but if you get the tripin' than I'm giving up my game 
 Never catch me sliping 
 You can get it out yo brain 
 Maine Fan or Foe! 
 Fuck a nigag try to get his hands on my doe 
 But if you really want come on 
 Try to get a, you can feed the unpulla 
 Tuck my hands on your throat 
 Man I'm a Low 
 Want a background for sack town 
 Better watch out from the Blao Blao 
 BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT (braararararaa ttataaaaa) 
 Stay with my kimers, stepping nockle doodle 
 Waicking there game on blood goca doodle 
 Think you gon catch me slip at a show 
 No factor slick Oh slack, shock a zoolu 
 Watch me do you 
 With all that fake shit 
 You fill with hate trade 
 Hoping wishing you wre my replacement 
 Courage so viciouse you gon' have to face it 
 They try to taste it 
 'Cause I laced it like a tennis shoes and I've been a fool 
 Like Zeepo bitch and X-Raided 
 But this is a different interview 
 (Chorus Repeat 2X) 
 Living a bee a bad idea 
 If it never go home again 
 Nigga looking at me 
 Like imma chicken dinner 
 Looking back at niggas 
 Like a shot of hennessy 
 So I gotta carry the four 
 I don't really know though 
 'Cause they walking past me 
 Giving me the eye 
 When they past me they be asking 
 When you new shit coming out 
 At tha picture house 
 They be huddled up and I think I might pick one out get tha nigga bigger than me 
 For tha trigger to see 
 If he tough enough 
 Make it what he trying to be 
 But he ain't bad though 
 Don't know how to approach a vulture 
 Get to close how I'm post up 
 Can't even live in peace 
 And when I eat with my peeps In the place 
 You in my face with your mix-tapes 
 And if I try to listen to it 
 We get it to it 
 And fo' all that fue it 
 Then its time to do it 
 Uh... 'Cause a nigga from out south out the mouth 
 Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth 
 (Yeah) 
 But it ain't fair that the music gotta do on what you wanna do when you ain't there. 
 And if too softly, softy when you see me out you betta get out off me 
 (Chorus Repeat 2X)
