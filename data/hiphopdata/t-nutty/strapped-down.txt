 It's my prerogative to cock a glock have you not to live 
 Get to dumppin on yo relatives 
 If they start to fussin 
 I'ma get to bustin' 
 On anybody out of line 
 Hennessy in my body and a .9 
 Rotty shotty doin' naughty crimes 
 Wit a quarter pokin out a dime 
 When you ride in the coupe deville itch 
 Use to kill like a rider not a manakin 
 Nigga posted wit a automatic steady panicin 
 Instead of scramblin I'm damagin 
 Any nigga take me for granted 
 Have that figured cause that nigga'z bigger 
 I won't hesitate to let'em have it 
 I'ma addict 
 Addicted to rappin' weed in blunts and dope in plastic 
 Wen the gun and the clip attaches 
 Niggaz get lit like a book of matches 
 But hustlaz takin' action cause nigga gotta get paid 
 Quick to put a snitch niggaz in a ditch for the fact they bitch made 
 For a big face $20 bill 
 There's plenty of niggaz that I'll peal 
 Like a banana in south sacromental sicc wit cliff and I'll back up 
 I don't give a fuck bout where we at CUZ 
 Longs we in the city of sac you just betta watch yo bro 
 Call me T NUTTY 
 For the green money I'll leave you leakin bloody red 
 Creepin' up like last flowheakin tweakin off what my cuddy said [cuddy said Nutty man] 
 These niggaz think that we dummies man 
 Posted up like Al Bundy wit a blondy off bom we rapped up like a mummy 
 It's do or die nigga got me strapped down wit a gun (wit a gun) 
 Strapped down wit a gun (wit a gun) Strapped down wit a gun (wit a gun) 
 Fam its do or die nigga got me strapped wit a gun 
 They say I need to stop it but I'm cocky 'cause I'm on one 
 Do to the fact that I'm off that yac 
 Right now I'm feelin' on sympathy 
 Fuck a timonthy or anyone callin they-self my enemey 
 Off the hennessy lost my energy 
 'Cause I was smokin' inner city bom wit my folk 
 Most of the niggaz is Locs crush you wit a open paw 
 Give up the dope or nigga get choked 
 Matter a fact snatchback by throat strangled wit rope 
 Now tangled up in the game wit out yo coke 
 'Cause you prevoked a nigga wit scope snipe a nigga from the scova 
 Hand it over man empty yo pocket I wonder knock you out yo nova 
 'Cause of the doja and sova gettin' over on me 
 'Cause on my street we don't play that runnin' gay cats up a tree 
 So wen there's beef I be stealin like a thief straight to the mouth like Keith 
 'Cause I'm that nigga dats slicker than grease 
 Pull out the weapon and sweat'em like Keith 
 Fucc the police if they after me tryna capture but they can't 
 Wen I arrive I got five on the fate 
 My nigga nate get the dank 
 And if it stank cause of that sticky icky 
 Blow it let's get stupider 
 The bom I smoke is nuclear 
 It'll have you higher than Jupiter 
 The gardens my neck of the woods and gonna be there for good 
 So all you wannabe niggaz there's only 1 Nutty-Nut so fucc yo hood 
 I give it like a nutt shood 
 Dumpin wen them peckerwoods comin' after me 
 The reason why I be buzzin 'cause I'm runnin' wit cuzzin Anthony 
 So pass the weed so I can be thinkin' of another tragedy 
 Instead of aonther brother I rather smother the police academy 
 But niggaz is always mad at me 
 Stare at Nutty wit an attitude 
 But it don't matter lil bitty dude 
 I'm not Mr. T but I pity fooz 
 If you getty rude part of the game maintain wen it rain 
 You betta be doin' thang its tryna pass if you can't hang 
 You'll be beggin that bitch for change 
 I'll be changin my step from right to left 
 I'm like a pit that I'll fight to the death 
 Kickin it wit killa sqiderz kept 
 Don't try to creep 'cause I already crept 
 Up on ya and I'd tried warn ya that gun 
 Bigger than that nigga Panther nigga run 
 Watch yo step cause niggaz these days get hurt 
 It be them scary fellows wearin fairy yellows 
 That get tooken off the turf 
 Lookin' up at the dirt 
 Guy's voice: 
 Now I was tryna figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hitt'em 
 No matter how big a guy mite be, Nicky will take'em on 
 Yo beat Nicky wit fist, he comes back wit a bat 
 You beat'em wit a knife, he comes back wit gun 
 And if you beat'em wit a gun you betta kill'em 
 'Cause he'll keep comin' back and back until wanna of you is dead 
 Why you actin' like you know me homie 
 Bite like arachnophobia 
 Hold it right bro 'cause I'm that nigga on the terria 
 Right now if not a nutty get out of here if you loud after the rotty shottysta 
 Swollow the bottle of Vodika 
 Feelin' like pullin a lick on the Mafia 
 Remind me up on a cop 
 Like Mr. Officer lick cock 
 This is how we setup shop 
 Load up tec and wet up a glock 
 And a bitch nigga I respect not 
 Kiss my ass from Sac to Albany 
 All the niggaz that you saw wit me was mothafuckin G 
 A N G S T A tryna do betta than yesterday 
 Chasin chedda instead of stressin betta cop you a weapon 'cause we bang 
 In a strange world where we hang out together 
 Fuck what they talkin' bout nigga whatever 
 Look it's my nigga Keith Sweat we all got the weapon for dumppin we dumppin for pepper 
 Nigga from peter piper 
 Most of my 24th streetaz liferz 
 Maybe they stayin for shereddin gettin' locked for case 
 Earn stripes like Tony the Tiger

 But the rest of us wen we checkin' punks
