Watching the stars... till they're gone 
 Like an actor all alone 
 Who never knew the story he was in 
 Who never knew the story ends 
 Like the sky reflecting my heart 
 All the colors become visible 
 When the morning begins 
 I'll read the last line 
 Owaranai ame dakishimeta yoru ga asa wo mukaeru 
 Kokoro wa mada nureta mama 
 In endless rain, I've been walking 
 Like a poet feeling pain 
 Tryin' to find the answers 
 Tryin' to hide the tears 
 But it was just a circle 
 That never ends 
 When the rain stops, I'll turn the page 
 The page of the first chapter 
 Kizu tsuku dake kizu tsuite wakatta hazu no kotae wo 
 Doushite mada toikaketeru? 
 Am I wrong to be hurt 
 Am I wrong to feel pain 
 Am I wrong to be in the rain 
 Am I wrong to wish the night won't end 
 Am I wrong to cry 
 But I know, it's not wrong to sing THE LAST SONG 
 Cause forever fades 
 Ki ga tsukeba mata hitori yoru no sora wo mitsumeteru 
 Sukoshi zutsu kieteyuku our memories 
 Kizu tsuku dake kizu tsuite wakatta hazu no kotae wo 
 Doushite mada toikaketeru? 
 I see red 
 I see blue 
 But the silver lining gradually takes over 
 When the morning begin 
 I'll be in the next chapter 
 Owaranai ame dakishimeta yoru ga asa wo mukaeru 
 Kokoro wa mada nureta mama 
 Kizu tsuku dake kizu tsuite wakatta hazu no kotae wo 
 Doushite mada toikaketeru
