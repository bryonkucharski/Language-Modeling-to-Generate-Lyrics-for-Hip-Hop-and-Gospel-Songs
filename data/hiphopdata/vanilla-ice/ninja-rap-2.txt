Yo! It's the green machine 
 Gonna rock the town without being seen 
 Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down? 
 Slammin' and jammin' to the new swing sound 
 Yeah, everybody let's move 
 Vanilla is here with the new jack groove 
 Gonna rock, And roll this place 
 With the power of the ninja turtle bass 
 Iceman, Ya know I'm not playin' 
 Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin' 
 Ninja, Ninja, rap! Ninja, Ninja, rap! Go go go go! 
 Go Ninja, go Ninja, go: Go Ninja, go Ninja, go! 
 Go Ninja, go Ninja, go: Go Ninja, go Ninja, go! 
 Go go go go! 
 Lyrics, fill in the gap 
 Drop that bass and get the Ninja rap 
 Feel it, if you know what I mean 
 Give it up, For those heroes in green 
 Just flowin', smooth with the power 
 Givin' it up, hour after hour 
 'Cause in this life there's only one winner 
 You better aim straight so you can hit the center 
 In it to win it, with a team of four 
 Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the 
 Villans you better run and hide 
 Because one day you might not slide 
 So choose, your weapon but don't slip 
 Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip 
 Rockin' the crowd the way it should be rocked 
 With the Miami drop that you like a lot 
 You know it's hittin', like a Ninja Turtle 
 When the bass kicks in, you better check your level 
 The power of the ninja is strong 
 Fightin' all crooks until they're all out cold 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2X)
