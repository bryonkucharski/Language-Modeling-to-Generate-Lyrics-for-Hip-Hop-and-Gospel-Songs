Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this 
 Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this 
 I got a nation of millions to capture 
 Lyrical disaster pass the ganja 
 Choppin' shit like a bladerunner 
 Huntin down my opponents like the predator 
 Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st 
 Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent 
 Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin 
 They're on my trail like the bone collector 
 Select the sense from my sixth 
 Inject the fluid of the wickedness 
 Fuck the world! is my motto 
 I just can't understand why they point the finger 
 When they see me doing my thing 
 Bitches swing when they see me pass by 
 In the GS4 with the Cane plates bought from my last tour 
 It's amityville horror on haters block 
 For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top 
 Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness 
 I'm true to kicking this 
 Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this 
 Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this 
 Like Manson dismantling MCs who oppose a threat 
 You really don't want to get into some shit that you'll regret 
 Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation 
 Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith 
 (Is it safe to come out and play now) is he gone? 
 Man I don't understand what kind of high this dude is trippin' on 
 Pure ICE with a twist of vanilla thriller 
 Captivating souls like the body snatchers 
 Its return of the living Caucasians 
 Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics 
 Causing havoc bringing the pain 
 Flaming up like in Backdraft 
 Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion 
 Many aren't true to what they're busting 
 (From the depths) 
 I'm coming through like the Hell Raiser 
 It's the end of days there's no escape from the detonator 
 Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this 
 Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm 
 I'm coming through with the wickedness 
 Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this
