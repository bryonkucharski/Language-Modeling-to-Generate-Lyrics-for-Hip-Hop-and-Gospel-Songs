I need a woman that's sexy 
 Straight up and erotic 
 I gotta have her. 
 Yes a beautiful sex goddess 
 The kind of girl who rocks my world. 
 Doin' those crzy things 
 With whipped cream an' ice cream. 
 An' everything from grapes to honey, 
 Andif you ask me 
 I wan her for 9 1/2 weeks money, 
 Straight stranded on a beach "G". 
 While she climbs up and down 
 This tall coconut tree, 
 An' doin' wild things with 
 Her tongue and lips, 
 An' her thighs, includin' them hips, 
 She comes equipped to lead. 
 The I.C.E. stuck, the kind of woman who 
 Can make my volcano erupt. 
 I need a woman that drives me crazy 
 When I look at her, 
 And make the Ice Man melt 
 When I look at her. 
 Yeah, she's the one to make Vanilla's blood boil, 
 Open up that hood, 
 And let me check that oil. 
 I got the right dip stick for the job honey. 
 Watch me swing, while you're edancin' in your G-string. 
 And let me pull up to your bumpa, 
 And if your battery is dead, 
 I'll pull my cable out and jump ya' 
 Pump ya' with he juice 
 To keep the engine runnin' 
 Oh yes, you've got the body work 
 To keep the Ice man comin' 
 Again and again 
 In any type of weather, Baby, 
 I need you - Now, Now and Forever 
 I'm the type of man that 
 Likes to get it off. 
 I'll pour some champagne all 
 Over your baod, and then I'll lick it off. 
 Uh an' I have to tell you somthin' 
 I want to kiss your neck, 
 And take my tongue around your belly button. 
 I need a woman not a hooka 
 To take rides on my love boat. 
 Yes, my 53 fotta, 
 So let's sink in my hot tub or ja'causezi 
 And do those crazy wild things, 
 That amuse me. 
 Oh yes baby, I'll be your sex slave 
 And with my head gear on, 
 I wanna go and explore your cave, 
 See you can make the Ice cream. 
 Come here girl, and take a lick of this ice cream
