If you're wondering who I am 
 Well I'm a girl who can handle a man 
 I don't have time for little boys 
 I want a man with man size toys 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 Oh yeah baby, you're so hot 
 Yeah, right 
 Have a drink and throw me down 
 I'm the sluttiest girl in town 
 Leather pants and high heeled shoes 
 Lipstick markings on your tattoos 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 Oh baby, oh yeah, oh 
 Yeah, right! 
 Yo, I'm Vanilla Ice and I'll be your dream 
 So won't you open up your legs and I'll make you cream 
 Just like a waterfall 
 You know I got it all 
 A long white dick almost ten inches tall 
 M-hmm 
 Pull it out and I'll be the judge 
 I'll let you know if you're well-hung 
 I'll feel you up and I'll check for size 
 If it's puny don't waste my time 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me 
 Hey stud boy standin' there at the back of the bar 
 I bet you think you're real well hung 
 Yeah, right! 
 Oh, yeah, stick it in 
 Oh, give it to me baby
