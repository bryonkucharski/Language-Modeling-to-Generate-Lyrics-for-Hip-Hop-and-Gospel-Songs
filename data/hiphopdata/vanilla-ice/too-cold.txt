(Vanilla ice, earthquake, m. smooth) 
 All right stop, collaborate and listen 
 Ice is back I got a brand new invention 
 Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
 Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly 
 Will it ever stop? yo-i don't know 
 Now turn off the lights (huh) and I'll glow 
 And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal 
 Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold 
 But you be talkin' that shi*(repeating until next verse) 
 Dance, bum rush the speaker that booms 
 I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
 Deadly, now as I play a dope melody 
 Anything less than the best is a felony 
 Love it or leave it, you better gain way 
 You better hit the bull's eye, the kid don't play 
 And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 
 Ice ice baby, ice ice baby 
 Ice ice baby, ice ice baby 
 Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 
 Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it 
 My town, that created all the bass sound 
 Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
 'Cause my style is like a chemical spill 
 Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel 
 Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept 
 We make it hype and know you wanna step with this 
 Swamp plays on the fade, slice like a ninja 
 Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJ's say "damn" 
 If rhyme was a drug, you know I'd sell it by the gram 
 Keep my composure when it's time to get loose 
 Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice 
 And if there was a problem, you know that I would solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. 
 Ice ice baby (throw your hands in the air, let me know you're out there) 
 Ice ice baby, ice ice baby (throw your hands in the air, let me know you're out there) 
 Ice ice baby, too fuc*in' cold 
 Too cold, too cold, too cold, too cold 
 Ice ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold
