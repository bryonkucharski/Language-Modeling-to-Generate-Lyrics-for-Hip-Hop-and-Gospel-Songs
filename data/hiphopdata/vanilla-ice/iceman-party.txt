Get on down to the sound and a good rhyme. 
 With a song that should climb 
 Yo straight to the top with a bullet on the charts again 
 Another #1 hit to deal with 
 I gotta fist full of junkies of hip hop sucka's 
 That get in the way have to get dropped. 
 Forget pop goes the weasel 'cause I ran over them punks 
 Like a mac truck diesel. 
 An' I'm playin' all the ladies 
 And I know not a sucker can fade me. 
 So watch me get buck wild 
 Yo and just pump the crowd and everybody say. 
 Ain't no party like an Ice Man party 
 Now gettin' back to the track with the bass - uh! 
 Watch it unfold in your face 
 I waste no time makin' your body move 
 Makin' this party groove. Yo. 
 This is somethin' real funky to dance to 
 Bringin' ya more raps to keep the dance floor packed 
 So get off the bozak. 
 An' like Cool J said don't call it a come back. 
 One track made a killin' 
 An' my first LP went way over 11 million 
 So don't front 'cause I know you were an Ice Fan. 
 So get down with the Ice Man 
 Everybody thought that the Ice was gonna fade out. 
 But you was wrong 'cause I never get played out. 
 An' that's stright up reality 
 I wanna say what's up to my homies in Miami 
 An' to Dallas all across the United States. 
 An' everybody who bought Vanilla Ice tapes. 
 An' everybody overseas, my man - 
 All of Europe, Australia and Japan. 
 No matter where you reside, I'm in evere record store 
 'Cause The Ice is like world wide 
 Come on and catch the vibe 
 'Cause the sky's the limit 
 An' I'll never quit makin' hits 
 So get on down with the progrm 
 Folks it's 92 an' I'm back and it's no joke - 
 So you know the Ice won't steer you wrong. 
 Now everbody just sing along
