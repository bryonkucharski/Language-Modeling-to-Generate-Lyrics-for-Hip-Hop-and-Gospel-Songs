I had a zig zag story just the other day I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see? 
 Those motherf__kers still wanna 
 I-C-E 
 To blaze up a sac of that green bombay 
 And when I reach my peak, I explode like 
 Dante 
 Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin' 
 In the music, I use it, and don't abuse it 
 And true, it gets me high like the sky I will buy till the day that I die 
 You ain't gotta ask me why I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny 
 Got a lifetime supply 
 And I wanna get you high 
 Get you high all night 'Cause I wanna get you high 
 Get you high all night 
 And I wanna get you high 
 Bang another joint

 Zig zag stories 
 This is a zig zag story that I had last night 
 A six-pack, a joint, and I was feeling all right 
 Lit up tha chronic, and what did I see? 
 This bad-a__ bit_h creeping up on me 
 She had the look that could get the 
 Ice cooked up in a second I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked 
 She walked up to me and said her name was 
 Mary 
 Jane 
 Ain't no shame in my game, down to do anything 
 Took me by the hand, ask me if I'd like to fly 
 You know I like to fly 'Cause I wanna get you high 
 Get you high all night 'Cause I wanna get you high 
 Get you high all night 
 And I wanna get you high 
 Bang another joint

 Gotta get myself together 'cause some sh_t is goin' down 
 Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now 
 Hit you people off with my new 
 CD 
 Hard 
 To 
 Swallow, like saying "F__k the industry!" I'm stompin' through the bayou with my black boots laced 
 And takin' out you motherf__kers acting two-faced 
 For the people out there gonna blaze till I die 
 Blaze up the thai 
 Get you high all night 'Cause I wanna get you high 'Cause I wanna get you high 
 Get you high all night 
 And I wanna get you high
