Yo, Vanilla, kick it one time, boy! 
 Yo, VIP, let's kick it! 
 Ice Ice Baby 
 Ice Ice Baby 
 All right stop 
 Collaborate and listen 
 Ice is back with my brand new invention 
 Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
 Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly 
 Will it ever stop? 
 Yo, I don't know 
 Turn off the lights and I'll glow 
 To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal 
 Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle 
 Dance 
 Bum rush the speaker that booms 
 I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
 Deadly, when I play a dope melody 
 Anything less that the best is a felony 
 Love it or leave it 
 You better gain way 
 You better hit bull's eye 
 The kid don't play 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo, I'll solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 
 Ice Ice Baby Vanilla [4x] 
 Now that the party is jumping 
 With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' 
 Quick to the point, to the point no faking 
 I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon 
 Burning them if they're not quick and nimble 
 I go crazy when I hear a cymbal 
 And a hi hat with a souped up tempo 
 I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo 
 Rollin' in my 5.0 
 With my ragtop down so my hair can blow 
 The girlies on standby 
 Waving just to say HI 
 Did you stop? 
 No, I just drove by 
 Kept on pursuing to the next stop 
 I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block 
 That block was dead 
 Yo, so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. 
 Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis 
 Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis 
 Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine 
 Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine 
 Reading for the chumps on the wall 
 The Chumps
