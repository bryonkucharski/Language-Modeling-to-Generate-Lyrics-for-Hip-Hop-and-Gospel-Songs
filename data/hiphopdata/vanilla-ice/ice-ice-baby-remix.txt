All right, stop 
 Collaborate and listen 
 Ice is back, I got a brand new invention 
 Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
 Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly 
 Will it ever stop? 
 Yo--I don't know 
 Turn off the lights and I'll glow to the extreme 
 I rock a mic like a vandal 
 Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Dance 
 Bum rush the speaker that booms 
 I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
 Deadly, when I play a dope melody 
 Anything less that the best is a felony 
 Love it or leave it 
 You better gain way 
 You better hit bull's eye 
 The kid don't play 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo, I'll solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 
 Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it 
 My town, that created all the bass sound 
 Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill 
 Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel 
 Conducted and formed 
 This is a hell of a concept 
 We make it hype and you want to step with this 
 DJ plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja 
 Cut like a razor blade so fast 
 Other DJs say, "Damn" 
 If my rhyme was a drug 
 I'd sell it by the gram 
 Keep my composure when it's time to get loose 
 Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo--I'll solve it! 
 Check out the hook while DJ revolves it 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too fuckin' cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold
