Coolin in the shade 
 Sippin on lemonade 
 I hear a knowck on the door who is it? 
 Kim, ocmin' to pay me another visit 
 She tells me that I'm on her mind 
 And a player like me is very hard to find 
 I like the way she licks her lips starin' in my eyes 
 I must admit she's got some juicy thighs 
 I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit 
 That's why I got her in my mix 
 All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin' 
 That's why I'm mind blowin' 
 Mind blowin', blowin' my mind... 
 Ten minutes past, I got my eyes on her ugh... 
 She's shaped like an hour glass 
 I like the red lipstick, she took a popsicle out 
 And put it in her mouth quick 
 She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only 
 A mac would like to hear 
 You see, I like a girl that really turns me on 
 Twist with her walk, and sexy on the telephone 
 She tells me she dreams of me, she wants to be with me 
 And not another memory 
 But for now we can hit the sheets baby 
 And keep it goin' now I'm mind blowin' 
 Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair 
 Now she's reaching for my underwear 
 I'm thinking I should make her wait 
 For another day, oh I forget, sherri's on the way 
 Off came the top, she's looking in my eyes 
 Here we go with the big surprise 
 I guess I can't resist it, hands all over my body 
 As she puckered up and kissed 
 Uh, off came the pumps, I'm checkin' out the rump 
 She's got a lotta junk in her trunk 
 And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin' 
 Now I'm mind blowin'
