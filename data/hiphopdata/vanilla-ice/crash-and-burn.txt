Phone Message from Ross Robinson 
 "Hey dude it's Ross 
 Just callin to say hey 
 I'm much better now 
 I fractured my spine 
 It was fucked up 
 I did a triple over a double 
 And landed on my head 
 So um... I did it on the 426 
 Yep... wasn't to fun 
 But before that dude I was fuckin' totally in tune 
 And feelin' kick ass on the track 
 It was like the best I've ever felt 
 So maybe that's why I started gettin' all cocky and shit 
 Uh... All right man, just workin away super hardcore on Slipknot 
 And I'm about 5 days left and take like a week off 
 Or somethin' like that and start the next one 
 Hope your doin' good dude 
 Talk to ya later"
