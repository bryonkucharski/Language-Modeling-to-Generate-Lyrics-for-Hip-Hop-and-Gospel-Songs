Guess who's back... 
 OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit 
 OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some sick shit 
 Raisin' up from my tomb 
 Time warp on a dime off the shrooms 
 Zoom in let me take your mind on a journey 
 See what I see visions of bodies burnin' 
 Like turnin' a pistol and pointin it to your dome 
 Cock it back squeeze the trigger blow and it's on 
 Brains gone, thrown out the back of your cranium 
 Trippin' on your shorts, left your ass a corpse on your Ma's front porch 
 About to torch down the house 
 Caught your mama and her spouse fuckin' on the couch like south 
 Bout to make moves off your fam bam 
 Madman lyrically from rap to seran next plan 
 Let me expand on my artwork genius in my reality 
 Pure insanity can it be the angel dust that turns your brains to dust 
 Bust lyrics strangle us no one is insane as us 
 OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit 
 OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some sick shit 
 Takin' puffs on the smoke I call the Anti-Christ 
 Got me seein red and purple lights 
 Mixed with black dots 
 Peep the backdrop of the crime scene 
 Niggas seein' 19 I'm seein' widescreen 
 So much red Visine can't get it out 
 From the rage of the slugs as the iron spit it out 
 It is I Psycho palmin' the Desert Eagle 
 Creepin' through your blocks in the crypt colored Reagal 
 Pure evil bumpin brother Lynch season of the sick 
 How you gonna reason with the Psycho I'm the desolate 
 Watch the devil spit, call the exorcist 
 Satanic messages, got me wearin nigases for necklaces 
 Yes it is the messenger of death watch yo step 
 I'm quite wicked 
 Make a motherfucker leak his life liquid 
 So why risk it it's a suicide 
 When it comes to you and I 
 Do or fly nigga you will die
