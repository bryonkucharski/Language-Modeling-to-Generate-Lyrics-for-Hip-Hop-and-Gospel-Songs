Now, the industry has got me thinking twice 
 Thinking with the treble mix, gotta shake 'em like dice 
 Let the whole world know I can't go for that 
 Girls know that I got gold and stacks 
 In every cul de sac from the streets to the clubs 
 I'm making hits and everybody's showing love 
 Fact is I'm back and I'm rolling like Jackson 
 Won't stop until I'm back at multi platinum 
 So I start with some action, I'm the main attraction 
 Here to lie down to the west crackin' 
 Stackin big chips, holmes, gotta get em 
 Hauling in lots of residuals, what you got 
 You can't choose me 
 Bring it to you live for the year 2G

 Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me 
 Yeah - And I'm going crazy 
 Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me 
 No - You never ever made me

 No - I'm all fu_ked up 
 Yo, Ice it's Jim splice me in - no, stop 
 Begin, pause, 'cause I gotta call the next of kin 
 Tell 'em where you been, tell 'em that you're ok 
 DOA, here say, no way, won't say 
 Dead yes, dead all, not dead and gone 
 Like a multi-leader, a little bit withdrawn 
 Time and go like a vicious cycle 
 Then wham, make 'em think that you are coming out like George Michael 
 On par to make people to turn in no sooner 
 Hook, line, and sinker; like Charlie the Tuna 
 Drop the hero and get with the zero 
 I'll try to keep it clean like Mr. Belvedere 
 Fu_k me, fu_k you, fu_k the single 
 Don't want to take it in the can, you're not pringles 
 But once you pop you can't stop 
 So don't interrupt - situation normal all fu_ked up

 Round and round we go, where it stops nobody knows
