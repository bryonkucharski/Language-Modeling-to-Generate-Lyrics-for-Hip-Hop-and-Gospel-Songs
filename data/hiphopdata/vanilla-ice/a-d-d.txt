Through-out my dream these hands are tied 
 You wear your mask, but I see inside 
 Never a vision I haven't seen 
 All these lies spurred from dreams 
 All these lies left me blind 
 Whether yours? is all in time 
 With these hands built this life 
 Hands of mine now I'm alive 
 Just can't hide from my self (x2) 
 I just can't hide from my self 
 Just can't hide from my fuckin' self 
 I can't hide (x2) 
 And I can't hide (x2) 
 'Cause I just can't be myself 
 'Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself 
 And I just can't hide from myself 
 Everytime it's just myself 
 I can't hide from my fuckin' self 
 I wanna peel my skin hang it on the shelf 
 Die from no pain 
 A minimal brain 
 Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane 
 Too impulsive too impatient 
 Anxiety's got me screamin this hatred 
 Still I strive to stay alive 
 Gotta get mine 'cause I just can't be myself 
 'Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself 
 And I just can't hide from myself 
 Everytime it's just myself 
 Is there some future? contemplate 
 I need gratification before it's too late 
 The cravings are dry, drive me through 
 Self destruction can always be true 
 Islands of fire keep me alive 
 No drugs around can fill me inside 
 I can't hide 
 And I can't hide 
 I know I can't hide 
 And I can't hide 
 I just can't be myself 
 And I just can't fuckin' be my self 
 I just can't hide from myself 
 Everytime it's just my self
