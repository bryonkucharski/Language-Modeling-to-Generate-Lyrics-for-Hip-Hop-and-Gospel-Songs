Hip hop rules 
 And if ya didn't know 
 Hip hop rules 
 Kick the ill flow 
 Hip hop rules 
 I'm breakin all the news 
 Hip hop rules 
 From the old to the new school 
 Big black skinny nigga 
 6'4" with the .44 
 Got the slow flow it sound like coke dough 
 In the Benzo smokin' on Coco 
 My blood niggas say I'm true Vatos loco 
 For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal 
 Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set 
 Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex 
 Shootin Tex at sets make a ho clits wet 
 Now I cash big checks tryin' to own assets 
 Built like the Aztecs 
 Why you niggas ass bet 
 Remember Ice Ice Baby 
 Drove you crazy then I was big as Jay-Z 
 I got paid and I got swayze 
 Eatin' shrimp with my feet up made me lazy 
 I bought about 10 cars and about 5 cribs 
 Out in the woods nobody knows where I live 
 Got a beautiful wife and two kids 
 But I'm married to hip hop and that's how it is 
 Cause 
 Hip hop rules 
 And if ya didn't know 
 Hip hop rules 
 Kick the ill flow 
 Hip hop rules 
 I'm breakin all the news 
 Hip hop rules 
 From the old to the new school 
 It's been a long time since you seen me 
 On the TV V-Ice is here for sheezy 
 Takin' what's mine 
 'Cause it's my time to hit y'all with a new style of rhyme 
 Yeah 
 This is hip rock it can't be stopped 
 Bomb tha system 
 Straight to the top 
 Millions of dollars I been spendin' em 
 I love rap, I paved the way for Eminem 
 Needless to say I rap back today 
 Y'all forgot about me like y'all forgot about Dre 
 But I'm still here 
 With no fear I say what I want and make sure its clear 
 Yo 
 I play ball break jaws break all types of laws 
 Militant haters wanna kill me with a cause 
 Feel me 
 I been nice since the P was free back when KRS was runnin' shit 
 Wit BDP 
 I spit rapnology wack rappers follow me 
 Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be 
 Studying astronomy and the world's prophecy 
 Giving sight to the blind enabling them to see 
 It's me GOD equal 4 plus 3 
 Coped a 6 with the V for the year 2G 
 Stay blowin' on trees, how many guns? 23 
 But it only take one to make you history 
 My clan hold me nobody control me 
 So fuck a PO and being parolee 
 I write solely light grey Roley 
 Not the Bible but I lead a church of niggas Holy 
 Because 
 Hip hop rules 
 And if ya didn't know 
 Hip hop rules 
 Kick the ill flow 
 Hip hop rules 
 I'm breakin all the news 
 Hip hop rules 
 From the old to the new school 
 I've got dawgs up north 
 I've got dawgs down south 
 I've got dawgs that'll smack blood out of your mouth 
 Then lick they hand 
 It's the Darkman brother number 12 from the Wu-Tang Clan 
 You heard me on Gza you heard me on Deck 
 That was me with ODB that bust a Tek 
 La and Vanilla want money like Rockfeller 
 If not I'll have to pop a fella 
 I'm the illest Caucasian, rhymes blazin' 
 I went 17 platinum, amazin' 
 Now just listen to the sound I kick 
 Chillin' with my man La, watchin gangsta flicks 
 Don't ask why? I cheer for the bad guy 
 Maybe it's the hydro, I'm so high 
 Or maybe it's the Xtasy gettin' the best of me 
 The industry keeps on testin me 
 But I won't fold I'm just too bold 
 One thing about Ice I stay cold
