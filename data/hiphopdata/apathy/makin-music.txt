(Sample) 
 You are listening to the sound of music. 
 The simple and complex rhythms. 
 And the fills, and the solos. 
 They're all compiled by a leading performer and writer... 
 Lexicon! 
 In addition, you will apply what you have learned almost immediately by playing along with the rock group of this record. 
 (Verse 1 - Big Oak) 
 In my '99 Saturn, switchin four lanes 
 Nah, fuck it, I'm gettin' sick of rollin' in a bucket 
 So I dumped in a ditch, got a truck with leather 
 Figured out why I've been feelin' under the weather 
 Rolled around for three years with a broken tape deck 
 Bumpin commercial radio, it made me sick 
 I got used to it man, it that made me sick 
 Got it fixed, but some underground, it made me sick! 
 So now I only listen to shit, that's good for my health 
 Like styles of beyond, Apathy and Celph 
 4-zone, Sandman, JaySon plus Jay-Z, anything old and rock 'n' roll 
 I'm feelin' too old, from bein twenty-two 
 Gettin' nostalgic with songs like my dad used to do 
 It's pathetic, but I don't mean to start a revolution 
 I'm just makin' music, makin' my contribution 
 (Verse 2 - Celph Titled) 
 I'll be deep in the lab, cookin up some gourmet rap shit 
 At the chrome depot, where we lay the tracks with 
 Bangin' beats, we masters of the sample surgery 
 With rhymes so dope they have to be heard hypodermically 
 All over the world I'm famous for instrumental treats 
 But really I'm just a rapper that decided to make some beats 
 Don't ever call me a producer on the mic 
 I'm an MC behind the boards you'd better get it right 
 And nigga's around my way be knowin' me for havin' mad quotes 
 But I find it funny cause punch lines are just bad jokes 
 I'm a monster in this industry, who stays scheming 
 On Halloween I dress like a human being 
 I make the type of music you could nod your head to 
 Entire albums you could play till the cassette's through 
 I talk a lot of thug shit in these rap songs 
 But that's what happens when you put a raw nigga's track on 
 We're making music, you'd better learn how to use it 
 You got the skills, better step up and prove it 
 If you got a title, pretty soon your going to lose it 
 Cause the L is here to stay, okay? 
 We're makin' music, not that underground trash 
 That floods the record racks and makes no impact 
 All-right, okay, they can't take all the blame 
 But it's not us, we're just here to save the day 
 (Verse 3 - Nick Fury) 
 Yo 
 We're makin' music while you write that abstract crap 
 Talkin' 'bout the periodic table in a rap 
 C'mon, what the fuck are y'all doin'? 
 You'd better go back and listen to some "juice crew" and 
 Understand that no one wants to hear that bullshit 
 Silly verse about your lyrical science experiment (nope) 
 Save it for your little internet geek sessions 
 With your beats that will cure insomnia in seconds 
 See while ya pack forty words in a bar and think 
 We pack forty girls in a bar and drink 
 'Cause it's like that 
 The distortion off the ?? and demigodz are here to strike back 
 I'm somewhere in-between stunts, bloods and hip hop 
 And sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, now that's music 
 I've got my word and I'm not afraid to use it 
 The hell with rap, I'ma sing the blues kid 
 (Verse 4 - Apathy) 
 I'm tryin' ta make joints till it gets played by Flex and Angie 
 And you can hear it comin' out an Ap, Lex or Camry 
 Fuckin' groupies until I only smell sex and candy 
 And if the girls don't jock I keep my ex's handy 
 I'll be rappin' till my little kids are playin' candy land 
 And I'm a family man, with car seats inside a family van 
 I'll be changin their diapers, while I'm hangin' in ciphers 
 And hit you with their shitty drawers if your raps ain't tighter 
 I'm a demigod, you motherfuckers don't know the half 
 About this white boy speakin' five percent of math 
 With polo's to ? and hoes I mack easily 
 Control their sub-conscious with subliminal frequencies 
 Fuck young chicks, visiting dorm's too frequently 
 They don't blow up my spot, they're all sworn to secrecy 
 They stay on the dick, when chicks hear my new shit 
 And even keep a box of toothpicks to pick the pubics 
 It's music 
 We're making music, you'd better learn how to use it 
 You got the skills, better step up and prove it 
 If you got a title, pretty soon your going to lose it 
 Cause the Ap and Celph is here to stay, okay? 
 We're makin' music, not that underground trash 
 That floods the record racks and makes no impact 
 All-right, okay, they can't take all the blame 
 But it's not us, we're just here to save the day
