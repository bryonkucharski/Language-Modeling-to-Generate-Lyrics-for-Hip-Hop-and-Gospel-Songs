(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 I remember in the '90s it was all about forties and blunts 
 Nas cassettes, Das EFX and Reebok pumps 
 Punk motherfuckers that were claiming they got TECs 
 And rockin' ski masks like Q-Tip in Hot Sex 
 Before them underground rappers with complex 
 When Mobb Deep and Jay still lived in the projects 
 There wasn't Escalades flooding the streets 
 It was all about Lexus Coupes and the Jeeps 
 Yup, what I wouldn't give to see it again 
 Doing stupid-ass shit, just me and my friends 
 Like calling up bitches, if they fathers got pissed 
 We'd pop shit cause caller ID didn't exist (Click) 
 I can still remember dancing to Kane 
 Every day with Dewayne, LJ and Charmaine 
 Life's changed, but this is how it be till the end 
 Still doing dumb shit, just me and my friends 
 (Hey hey hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play, say say say) 
 It's just me and my friends 
 (Hey hey hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play, say say say) 
 It's just me and my friends 
 (Hey hey hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play, say say say) 
 It's just me and my friends 
 (Hey hey hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play, say say say) 
 (Dumbing out, just me and my crew) 
 (Verse 2: One Two) 
 Yo, the crew I roll with - cold as hell 
 We own the streets like OGs own the jails 
 Mack college bitches, they know us well 
 But now that I'm 23 I feel old as hell 
 Suave motherfuckers with the fliest of hoes 
 Peepin bitches (Yo Ap, keep your eyes on the rooooad) 
 Nothin's really changed, we work fast on it 
 Since hats with silver plaques that said 'RAP' on it 
 Ignorant little punks provokin a fight 
 Kinda like stickin a pipe through the spokes of your bike 
 Cruisin down Franklin, tappin the brakes 
 Hey yo Rube, put that dutch down, we passin the jakes 
 Spot didn't get hot or jump until we came 
 A fridge full of forties like Nothin' But a 'G' Thang 
 Rap pack of Godz and we willin' to pop 
 And stick together like waffles when they still in the box 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 You couldn't tell me nothing back in '92 when I was wilding duke 
 Rocking British Knights, gold chains and Cross Colors suits 
 Me and Joey boosting bikes out of front yards 
 We'd smack you up just for doing nothing, we was dumb hard 
 Known from Armenia Ave and back down to Egypt 
 Like in Tampa you either showing your balls or you don't show your face 
 Strictly Miami Bass hits playing from Disco Rick 
 And gangsta shit from the Geto Boys, they minds was playing tricks 
 We used to load up at Manuel's then 
 And launch bottle rockets at people's houses until we'd burn our hands 
 "I Got A Man" was the jam 
 I remember like, "Damn! 
 I'm so proud to be a hip-hop fan" 
 Started making beats and writing raps, that's when the bug got in me 
 Flipped out when my man [Name] pulled an armed robbery 
 I ain't seen him since he went to prison, wonder how he's living 
 Heard he's out the pen, so one love to you my old friend
