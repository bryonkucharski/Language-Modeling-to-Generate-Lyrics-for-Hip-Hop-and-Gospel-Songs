(Scratch Hook) 
 "One gun, two gun, three gun, four 
 Your mind is all about crime" 
 "One gun, two gun, three gun, four" 
 "Clips are inserted into my gun" 
 "One gun, two gun, three gun, four 
 Your mind is all about crime" 
 "One gun, two gun, three gun, four" 
 "So I can take the money, never have to run" 
 (Verse One) 
 It's been all about (CRIME!) 
 Pretty much since the beginning of time 
 Early men killed each other for objects that shine 
 Now business men do it with progress in mind 
 It ain't all about sweeps, projects and nines 
 This is (CRIME!), a very complex design 
 As long as motherfuckers got checks to sign 
 As long as they connects got a Lex to shine 
 Find the money or these cats got tecs in mind 
 This is (CRIME!) 
 Ain't nobody new to it 
 Everybody been through it 
 Shit, even Martha Stewart do it 
 White collar, not a lot of time 
 Tell 'em what you got in mind, stock times to Glock clips 
 There's a whole lot of crime 
 (Scratch Hook) 
 (Verse 2: Apathy) 
 And now they configure their secrecy in dollar signs 
 All the time trying to increase they bottom line 
 By any means, any schemes, any product lies 
 Buying bullets and then go bowling for Columbine (CRIME!) 
 Con men, congressmen with they concubines 
 Condoleezza Rice types confound in the conscious mind (CRIME!) 
 They fronting with they witty facade 
 But more kids got guns than The City Of God 
 When Cube copped heat from Sweets with little cash supply 
 "Damn baby, tell your mother Jackie said 'Hi'." 
 They're easy to cop 
 Hard to stop 
 Even rappers are turning gangsta shit to pop 
 (Scratch Hook) 
 (Verse 3: Apathy) 
 There's even thugs running things in the slums of London, England 
 Drug rings, king pins, stay smuggling things in 
 Invest in a vest, chest protected with metal 
 A way of life from broken down to the molecular level 
 It's like one block, two blocks, three pounds of product 
 Four story building where that work gets knocked up 
 Powder got more power when cooked with flower 
 So these motherfuckers hustling till the 25th Hour 
 From the east to the west to the place you least expect 
 From the gangsters we respect to the snakes police protect 
 From the Criminal Minded like KRS-One 
 To the criminal minded like gangsters with guns 
 (Scratch Hook) 
 (Scratching) 
 "Yours, mine" 
 "It's all about crime"
