I got Wolverine claws that'll slash through steel 
 Proton beams that'll blast through shields 
 Ap got a fetish for hoes in high heels 
 And my favorite hip hop beat is Mass Appeal 
 From the era of cassettes and The Reign Of The Tec 
 Every place that I step I would gain their respect 
 And the state that I rep, I put it on the map 
 Now Connecticut is known cause of Ap' it's a fact 
 I could fracture your back, manufacture a rap 
 That'll stab you in half before you factor the wrath 
 Of a psycho-path, paragraphs full of nitro- 
 Glycerin a missile from the pistol of the rifle 
 Blows off, show off, rap is super femi 
 Fuck giving dap duke I'm not that friendly 
 To another MC, I let the clip empty 
 And stay underground like Gobo and Wembley 
 Wow, what a change hip hop is so emo 
 Soft ass rap with a gassed up ego 
 I don't really care though, Ap's on a mission 
 Fuck the transition, interrupt the transmission 
 This is warfare 
 I dropped out the sky with my wings burnt off 
 Came to save Earth but it's much worse off 
 Would've fucked your girl but was too turned off 
 So I went home, thought of your mom and jerked off 
 Just saying, this is how much I'm not playing 
 Every verse that I'm laying is a demon that I'm slaying 
 And every rap that I read is like lead ricocheting 
 To your head till the red, admit it's obliterating 
 And literally a little bit of it in the litigation 
 As exhibit A, shit that they say is incriminating 
 I don't give a fuck all the fucks are taken 
 You can huff you can puff till the fluctuation 
 And your lungs caves all of your brains in your face in 
 I slice your throat tell 'em you cut yourself shaving 
 Hold you underwater till my fingers turn to raisins 
 I'm raising a murder of crows to kill ravens 
 Wow, what a change hip hop is so feminine 
 Fuck boys need to show respect to the veterans 
 I don't really care though, y'all ain't doing nothing 
 But pushing on my buttons and that's self destruction 
 It's warfare
