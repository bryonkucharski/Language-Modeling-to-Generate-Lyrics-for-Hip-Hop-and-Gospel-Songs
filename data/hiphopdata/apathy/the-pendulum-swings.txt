(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 More time flies by as the pendulum swings 
 She be talking 'bout having my baby and buying rings 
 A decision like prison but it's been a few years 
 Man my face should be full of those tattoo tears 
 'Cause now I'm domesticated, no more bagging bitches 
 I'm stressed when she bitching, 'cause I ain't washed the dishes 
 And my clothes all over the floor starts a war 
 Who's that whore on your Facebook I never seen before? 
 Now I'm Main Source status staring at the front door 
 But she's so real I really couldn't ask for any more 
 So I fight with this bitch 'cause she worth fighting for 
 Even if we beef 'cause I didn't open up her door 
 But, you don't know this chick like I know this chick 
 She would probably wipe my ass if I'm old and sick 
 And if I shit my pants, right in the ambulance 
 We still be holding hands, that's true romance 
 We're like Dan and Rosanne or Jack and Diane 
 Everything'll work out, even if there's no plan 
 And that's how we'll live, put family before biz' 
 I just wish that my father could've saw our kids 
 That's a pain I can feel straight through my ribs 
 Every time I shop for bibs, bottles and cribs 
 Is it a boy or a girl, I'm so eager to see 
 I dedicate songs to you for believing in me 
 You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings (4x) 
 (Verse 2: Blacastan) 
 More time flies by as the pendulum swings 
 You know the rhyme, live today but never know what it brings 
 Peace my lord, I'm striving for a better blessing 
 Plus I spent too much time in the department of corrections 
 Trying to change my direction like catching interceptions 
 Easier said than done, word up son 
 My life now, I couldn't picture before 
 Music got a nigga hopping on planes for tours 
 Fuck CO's, I'm staying up late eating Doritos 
 Writing flows, to check all these local nigga's egos 
 A hero to some but a villain to most 
 Fam' witnessing the change, now they feeling the growth 
 For another safe flight, lets put up a toast 
 'Cause tomorrow night I'll probably be on the left coast 
 And most shows that I do is dedicated to crew 
 So rest in peace Mom Dukes, this one is for you 
 And a love so true, in your stomach I grew 
 Into fruition, poof, appear like a magician 
 Composed ill bars like a classical musician 
 To show you where my heart's at, I know you still listen
