I know it turns you on when I bury the needle 
 Got your hands on your face, and you're scared to peek through 
 That speed does something to your body that excites you 
 The NOS gets you off, the nitrous ignites you 
 There's lights in my rear view, and streets I steer through 
 With woofers up so loud, what, I can't hear you 
 Lets skip the chit chat, shut up and sit back 
 I'm a teach you how to drive stick, now grip that 
 Amateurs hit the door, can't get it if you slow 
 Why I need a chick who can't handle it like a pro 
 Workin those curves that can flip my whip 
 Grip them hips like my tires grip the strip 
 You hear my speakers pump, makin' you scream when I beat it up 
 I got your engine revin just to heat it up 
 Hit it fast till whiplash affects your neck 
 This ain't bout racin it's all bout um um 
 I know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I give gas to the ass and spin it around 
 And the centrifugal force is pinnin you down 
 A lot of these broads are brainless, barely an acquaintance 
 Who'll probably give me brains if I pull up in a vanquish 
 Advanced and tricked out when I pull the whip out my garage 
 She's like oh my gosh and flipped out 
 Get out the car, activate the alarm 
 Pimped out, incognito, and tinted out 
 A superstar in the car, people tryin' to figure out 
 Got you in the back seat, make it rock, two shocks squeak 
 We'll freak in the parkin lot, spot two cops creep 
 If you wanna ride, I wanna know how it feel inside 
 Rotate the bass so you feel it side to side 
 Shift into fifth, so she quickly reached down 
 She needs more speed now 
 I know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it 
 I push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it 
 I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it
