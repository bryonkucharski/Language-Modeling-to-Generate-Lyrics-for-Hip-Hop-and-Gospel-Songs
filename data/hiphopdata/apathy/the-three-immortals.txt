 The hologram sends you to the abode of the damned 
 Immortal like vampires 
 Setting fires in the caverns of the unholy 
 Oh the ancients, a hope of Abraham 
 Send you to the sacred land 
 To change form, preforming rituals that leave you scorned 
 Crown of thorns adorns the unborned in which you spawned

 The planetary hologram 
 Blowing your chakras to oblivion 
 Digital man 
 Biblical man, like silian 
 Vanishing breed 
 The holy throne 
 Presidents of the united states are now clones 
 The zones of the virus 
 The eye of Sirus

 Annuni, seven signs 
 Let the Dolphin be the Baptist 
 With self contained underwater breathing apparatus 
 In Atlantis Digital image screen enhances 
 Photographs of alien ships upon ya planets 
 Emerge from Volcanoes, Dreadlocks and Halo's 
 Presto- changeo, I Morph to tornadoes 
 And tear up ya major metropolis
