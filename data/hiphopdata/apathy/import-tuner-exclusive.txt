Apathy, Celph Titled, Lexicon 
 Another cheap shot banger 
 (Code Name?) Ap 
 (How You Roll?) Acura 
 Your wack quips inferior 
 My interior is immaculate 
 Rims spinnin' and glimmerin' in the sun 
 With an air freshener the scent of a cinnamon bun 
 Got a girl in the passenger seat, a passionate freak 
 And while I'm passin' the jeep, I'm blastin' a beat 
 I told her put down that import tuner and face Ap 
 Head to head in my lap like we was racin' a track 
 (Code Name) Celph 
 (How you roll?) Navigator 
 Aggravated assault, we spittin' laughin' at you haters 
 Find me out on the pacific coast 
 With fly Philippine mommies 
 9mm launch the shells behind me 
 Highly civilized in a civic with chrome rims 
 Opponents drop gems you get around in old Tims 
 In New York Celph Titled's like a sewer rat 
 Push up on your girl till she's like "STOP DOIN' THAT!" 
 (Code Name?) Nick 
 (How you Roll?) A Saturn 
 With a cracked windshield that forms a pattern 
 So when the lights hit it, it looks just like ice 
 But the scratches on the side make the chicks look twice 
 I'm sittin' on 14's, factory stock 
 Watch me throw it in 5th and make the whole whip block rattle 
 Shimmy and shake the shocks till they crack (it's whack) 
 But super-powered by the L on the back 
 (Code Name?) Oak 
 (How you roll?) In a Civic (How you livin'?) 
 So-so, my boy dinged the door but all's forgiven 
 Plus my hubcap kinda looks absurd 
 From that time I was high, misjudged, and drove up on the curb 
 Now I'm flippin' through the pages of an import tuner 
 Gettin' jealous, lookin' at two things I need sooner 
 Than later, now I'm droolin' so I grab a tissue 
 I need a new car and that honey from the May issue
