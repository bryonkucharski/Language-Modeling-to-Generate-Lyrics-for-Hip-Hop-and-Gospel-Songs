I dedicate this to you for believing in me 
 I dedicate this to you 
 I dedicate this to you for believing in me 
 I dedicate this to you 
 Back in '97 had a fucked up year 
 Weighed a buck-eighty wet and had fucked up gear 
 Drove a blue Buick Century filled with cassettes 
 I was broke as shit, more bills than cheques 
 I met you at the mall and you was working with Claire's 
 It's kinda crazy cause you wasn't even supposed to be there 
 I remember it all, that was 14 years 
 Then we stayed together 5 then the moment I feared 
 Now here comes the tears, here comes the hell 
 Here's the part of the story that's still hard to tell 
 When we had to split cause you had to grow 
 And I didn't understand, it just crushed my soul 
 You moved away, I toured the world 
 Year after year still missed my girl 
 You dated some dude, I swore to God it was wrap 
 I thought you'd get married and I'd never get you back 
 Even when I had a chick I would tell you I loved you 
 Calling late at night and getting you in trouble 
 Then things fell through with your man like a part of some plan 
 That got me stacking dough to put a wedding band on your hand yeah 
 Always [?] when you tell me that you'd be going back on the road again 
 Tears of mine tell me that you're the man some day I'll be marrying 
 I dedicate this to you for believing in me 
 I dedicate this to you 
 Dear us, if anything should ever go wrong 
 Just remember all the reasons why I wrote this song 
 When I hit rock bottom almost lost my mind 
 You were right by my side telling me I'll be fine 
 When my own group tried to treat me like Syd Barrett 
 You got me cleaned up, let me stay with your parents 
 And you always came back with the physics of a boomerang 
 I guess the human heart's smarter than the human brain 
 When we were young I turned you into a freak 
 Having Cape Cod sex seven days of the week 
 From the Ocean Mist shows you were there from the start 
 You're like the left ventricle, the biggest piece of my heart 
 Kept your old love letters and them naked pics 
 Even when I dated other chicks they wasn't shit 
 Fantasizing about fucking you and used to pretend 
 But now I got you back, I'll never lose you again, you said 
 Always [?] when you tell me that you'd be going back on the road again 
 Tears of mine tell me that you're the man some day I'll be marrying 
 I dedicate this to you for believing in me 
 I dedicate this to you
