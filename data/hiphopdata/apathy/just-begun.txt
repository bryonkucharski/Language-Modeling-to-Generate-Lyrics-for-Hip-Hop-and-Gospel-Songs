(Funkmaster flex sample) 
 (Celph Titled) 
 Yo what the fuck are y'all thinkin' 
 Lettin Apathy get on the mic 
 That's like unleashing a fucking atomic bomb 
 Yo this is Celph Titled the mutherfuckin mother molester 
 Yo Apathy rip the spines outta these mutherfuckers 
 (Apathy) 
 I'm gonna spit an incredible verse 
 Your head'll reverse and BURST 
 Till blood chemicals squirts all over medical shirts 
 Professional works of arts spark exceptional words 
 SHORT CIRCUIT MICS and cause an electrical surge 
 Rhymes shine like lights off of pieces of ice 
 My speech is precise 
 Psyche like telekinesis in fights 
 Rhymes reaches heights of beacons and satellites 
 What man can scan Venus and find pieces of mics 
 My fetus type was genius like 
 Spit with the speed of light 
 Strike in the night 
 Strip you of your adidas stripe 
 You see this indy white 
 Cause you couldn't be this tight 
 I'ma torture your wife while my fist squeezes the vice 
 Which unleashes the spikes 
 Brains leeches and mice 
 Right on the beaches in spice 
 Till she screeches with fight [ah] 
 The meanest to recite reaches for the weakest device 
 And releases to the people saying JESUS HE'S NICE 
 I'm a bad man 
 Managed to damage an amateur 
 While I slap slackers and backpackers 
 My raps shatters you wack matter FOREVER 
 Clever and still better with skill to sever your head 
 So BET THAT I'M ILL 
 On the best records erected and ripped it in record 
 I erupted and ruptured your wack label built into wreckage 
 Respect this Apathetic is magnetic electric effected 
 And known to charge negative when I set it 
 1, 2, 3, to the 3, 2, 1 so hot with the tongue I can melt down the sun 
 Stack raps and tons 
 I pack gats and guns 
 For tryna test Ap but I've just begun 
 (Apathy) 
 I'm electrically charged like jumper cables got attached to the mic 
 Jackin you white 
 I got a black gat with a sight [blau] 
 I sat up on a satellite last Saturday night 
 Beefin with a space rapper till we BATTLE FOR MICS 
 I can think about you makin' shatter platinum and ice 
 You try flattery and Apathy will flatten you twice 
 Just to obtain the fame or be half as nice 
 You'd have to train everyday twice a day for HALF YOUR LIFE 
 Every emcee I see wanna be as live as me 
 I'm at the level of perfection that prescribes to be 
 I got insight 
 Don't even need my eyes to see 
 All knowin' 
 Nothin' on earth surprisin' me 
 I'm on some fly shit 
 Some ol' open up your eyes shit 
 Superhero for rap 
 Never be the sidekick 
 Cats try to see in my mind like they was psychic 
 By I kick the lines that spine shatter when I spit 
 Spectacular 
 Spectators are left spellbound 
 Helpless like women rape victims being HELD DOWN 
 I'm like a nuclear facility in meltdown 
 Radiate your physical makin' your spirit HELLBOUND 
 Comin' from CT 
 Rockin' in 3d 
 Throwin' rootbeers in your fridge for tryna see me
