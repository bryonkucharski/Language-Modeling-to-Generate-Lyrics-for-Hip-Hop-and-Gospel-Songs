"Three, two, one, contact!" 
 (Apathy:) "Representin' like what" 
 (Biggie:) "1,000 grams of uncut to the gut" 
 I'm the type that'll keep my Nikes extra white 
 Like seein' God's girls in fluorescent light 
 Plug camcorder cords in electrical fixtures 
 Take sensual kisses with identical sisters 
 (And they better give up the ass) Celibate bitches 
 Are gettin' held under water like developin' pictures 
 Incredible spittin', got your skeleton twitchin' 
 Your head'll be twistin' like a demonic medical condition 
 Till you vomit and your body is liftin' off of the bed 
 In position of a crucifixion with your arms spread (You're all dead) 
 I'm hip-hop's apocalypse, let up and Ap claims the crown 
 Faggots, step up your rap game 
 Suckas get shook from shoves, chick checks 
 You're a bitch, you'll be cleanin' my kicks with Windex 
 I'm a gigolo, get a ho bitch that's rich 
 Or a little thick chick in a 626 
 I'm consistent, you know when Ap spits it's sick 
 Yeah, you're different... more like a chick with a dick 
 I'm a Pisces, addicted to girls, clothes, and Nikes 
 Material and spiritual, both worlds excite me 
 Flows fracture foes' flak jackets and rip fabric 
 A rap addict badder than you backpack faggots 
 Ap's a beast, the cake's like crack on streets 
 You swear that you deep, but you can't rap on beat, bitch 
 Stop the muthafuckin' pressure 'fore the pipes all burst, the mic's don't work 
 The blows that I throw lift you right off Earth 
 You'll get... clocked in the face and rocket through space 
 Shout out your hood, watch your whole block get erased 
 A superhuman supersoldier, hotter than a supernova 
 Money multiplies like ??? with Super Soakers 
 A true rap addict, y'all don't never want static, homey 
 You'll be at home gettin' that homeopathic 
 Listen... I don't care if you Christian, Muslim or Catholic 
 God got a whole iPod filled with Ap's shit 
 Y'all came for cream but get very little 
 'Cause Ap reign supreme, y'all barely drizzle 
 Metaphysical, still count cheddar better than digital 
 Money machines runnin' the scenes, summon the fiends, I'm lovin' it though 
 Makin' an abundance of dough 
 Runnin' the show, pumpin' blow till I'm numb in the soul 
 A child from the 80's era, you couldn't paint it clearer 
 Grew up with moms snortin' cocaine off a mirror 
 Those are all the little things that make me me 
 Couldn't focus my brain and blamed A.D.D. 
 On the contrary, Ap is like mental level 
 Hence the mental state rate grows exponential 
 But, if y'all wanna brawl, better call Paul Wall 
 To fix all them teeth Ap knocked outta your jaw, punk
