(Feat. Vinnie Paz) 
 (Verse 1: Vinnie Paz) 
 I'm the American Taliban 
 I love my weaponry, it's from Japan 
 If I don't know you, don't converse with me just slap my hand 
 Or else your forcing me to cock it fucking back in blam 
 It ain't a loss to me, you soft as fucking bags of sand 
 I stay with the heavy metal like merciful fate 
 Until I see the separation of church and the state 
 They take advantage of dying lives and seldom 
 So fuck the liars and the lying liars who tell em' 
 And fuck everybody who say that I'm not on my dean (?) 
 And fuck the Catholics, supported the Nazi regime 
 I'm the reason that logic in the philosophers dream 
 And the reason that I deposit a shot in your splean 
 And while you worry about the second coming of your Jesus 
 There's a connection to vaccines and other diseases 
 They hurtful procedures and use the tools well 
 That's why they try to keep you from the water fuel cell 
 I feel like putting a gat to my dome 
 'Cause they faggots and they liars like the Vatican throne 
 I bring the life into a track like I'm Lazarus Home 
 So never fuck around with me, I'm a statue of stone 
 (Verse 2: Apathy) 
 Digging rings by the moonlight 
 Walk through mud in new Nikes 
 Gonna raise my son by the way of the gun; and have him shoot right 
 Elevate the mental state and take him to new heights 
 It might not kill him if you drop him from two flights 
 Breaking down your molecules quicker than transporters 
 Decepticon, Kublai Khan, conquering transformers 
 The fourth-quarter quarterback 
 Got a quarter? Call the coroner and tell em' that 
 Ten gee's to get the corpses back 
 Heavy-metal, metamorphic, meditate to slay your tapes 
 Radical rhythm with nuclear raps when it radiates 
 Fuck loading glock clips, Ap is on some cosmic shit 
 Aim Cape Canaveral at ya, shoot you with a rocket ship 
 Shock em' with a shotgun shell 
 I'm Johnny Rotten as hell 
 With big business like Sid Vicious on shit cell 
 You faggot back packers, rap on computers 
 Get Martey McFly, I'll send you back to the future
