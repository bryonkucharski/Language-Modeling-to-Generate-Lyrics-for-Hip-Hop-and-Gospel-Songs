"Me and my crew walk the streets at night 
 Like lookin' for the right one, baby" 
 (Verse 1: Apathy) 
 You better watch your mouth 
 Get carried away and you'll be carried out 
 It's the king of Connecticut, looking very Sperry-ed out 
 You just gotta buy the album to find out my whereabouts 
 And you can tie me to a sail and still never air me out 
 Summertime I let the Beemer out, make 'em scream and shout 
 You the type of ratchet bitches they be making memes about 
 Throw some holy water on 'em, gotta get them demons out 
 Pat these bitches on the back, spit a little semen out 
 Bang bang shots fired but you scared to say my name 
 Suckas try to block my lane like drink service on a plane 
 Groupies trying to give me brain like the Beatles penny lane 
 Every lame trying to play me their songs, it's all the same 
 And it's funny how these trashy bitches call each other basic 
 Like Medusa with a mirror, because they're terrified to face it 
 Bitch go get a face lift, better yet go get a spaceship 
 I'll shoot you to the moon with one boom when the bass hit 
 Bukkake till your face drips, so go ahead and taste it 
 That's a million children I just wasted, so don't waste it 
 These white girls is wasted, flaky, Space Cases 
 They dropping N-bombs like they racist 
 All day, while... 
 "You and I could be together for..." 
 (Verse 2: Suave-Ski) 
 Rolling downtown trying to find another bird 
 Watch the whip swerve, observe the suave flow of words 
 Pull up to the curb, curvy made her curtsy in a summer dress 
 Unimpressed, I just want to see shorty come undressed 
 Cumming on her breasts, 'cause I heard that cum on the flesh 
 Is way better than lotion, I'm so cunning and fresh 
 An now that Suave's on the job, trick slob on my knob 
 Y'all are frogs on a log trying to swallow pollywogs 
 I'm a problem for blogs, bust globs on a blonde 
 Make her ass jiggle like fat blobs get a job 
 Take some groupies to the movies then to Ruby Tuesdays 
 An make them do me two ways, I'm too blazed 
 I get away like a ghost, that's how it's supposed to go 
 I see it, I want it, I beat it, I'm running 
 Man I never ever host these hoes 
 I dick 'em, I diss 'em, dismiss 'em, don't miss 'em 
 Play your position, I'm fixing the system 
 Bitches don't listen, tuck in your lip and quit tripping 
 Just strip and get tipped, and listen to me rippin' this shit 
 The illest to spit, I'll evict a video 
 Vixen out the crib like the rents late 
 The anti-Drake, the asshole all your friends hate, cause...
