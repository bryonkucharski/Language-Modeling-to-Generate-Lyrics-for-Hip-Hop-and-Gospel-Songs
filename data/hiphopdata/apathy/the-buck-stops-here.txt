"I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I get the paper so, I don't care" <- Milk-D 
 You ever have a dollar sittin' in your pocket? 
 Pull it out and take a deeper look at this object 
 Think of all it's seen, from the jeans of crack fiends 
 To doctors' Docker pants, stop to glance, see what I mean? 
 Same dollar bill that's stuffed in a stripper's thong 
 Could be the same dollar bill that's out shoppin' with your mom 
 Same dollar bill buyin' drugs for junkies 
 Is the same dollar bill for your kid's lunch money 
 Think about it, a dollar bill slips through stores 
 Everybody's touched one, whether rich or poor 
 You probably got a dollar in your birthday card before 
 But days before, it coulda been used to pay for whores 
 Still can't see it? Let me set you straight 
 The dollar grandmothers place on collection plates 
 Politicians roll for blow on Election Day 
 Hold to their nose until 5-0's investigate 
 It's underneath pillows when kids lose their teeth 
 The reason why crews'll beef and lose their teeth 
 It fuels deceit, breathe it in deep, the dollar's oxygen 
 Imagine seein' life through the eyes of George Washington 
 (Chorus) (Milk-D samples) 
 "I get money, money I got" 
 "I get money" 
 "I get money, money I got" 
 "I get the paper so, I don't care" 
 Handed to a man in the corner store for lottery 
 Taken from that man in the store in a robbery 
 Given to some kid on the block for a rock 
 Which is stacked in the pile and gets rolled up in the knot 
 Then it's given to a man in a van for a Glock 
 But that man in the van just got caught by the cops 
 So it's given to the cops so the man isn't locked 
 Then the cops split it up so the cash isn't hot 
 The dollar bill's just a small percentage of the whole 
 It's better to spend that excess cheddar slow 
 Keep it very basic, gotta be sure to cover your bases 
 Pull it from the money clip, a tip for the waitress 
 The waitress is an actress, she wants to be famous 
 Her teeth are fucked up, so she goes to get braces 
 She screams for a taxi, hops in the back seat 
 The cab has an accident and crashed on the back street 
 She's flung to the concrete, her purse explodes 
 Leavin' several single dollar bills scattered in the road 
 A breeze lifts a dollar in the air where it's blown 
 In front of a child's home, where she plays alone 
 Now she walks down the street, happier than before 
 Ringin' bells on the door when she enters the store 
 And with a smile from the clerk when the transaction's done 
 In steps a man with a gun... 
 (Chorus) (Milk-D samples) 
 "I get money, money I got" 
 "I get-get, mo-mo-mo-money I got" 
 "I get money, money I got" 
 "I get the paper so, I don't..."
