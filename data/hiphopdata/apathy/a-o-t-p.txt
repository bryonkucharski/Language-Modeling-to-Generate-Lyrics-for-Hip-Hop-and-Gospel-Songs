Army of the Pharaohs! We'll always get paid 
 We'll take the wackest shit, and make it better 
 Remember, we ain't doin' shit for free 
 Pay us some G's... and we'll start... rhymin', rhymin', rhymin! 
 It's the A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 From hell we came, help us spell the name! 
 It goes A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 A! (dot) O! (dot) T! (dot) P! (dot) 
 Say it out loud, start fights in the crowd! It's the... 
 Apathy attacks like asteroids or avalanches 
 An apparition who appears, but is apt to vanish 
 In the air like alien aircraft 
 Droppin' atom bombs, hold your breath while the air last 
 Out of oxygen, time's up, ask O-z 
 Flow's Oxycontin, overdo it and OD 
 Ho's wanna orgy, they open then, "Oh no! " 
 Quickly orgasm when they pussy get ooh-cho 
 Tight little teens try to make me trick 
 I'm telepathic, you can't tell what makes me tick 
 From Texas to Tel Aviv, tongues tickle the testicles 
 Can't top this text, 'cause the topic's too technical 
 Paragraphs of wrath, more passion than Christ 
 I'm never passive, I'm pissed off and don't pass mics 
 Press the digitator, better prep or prepare foes 
 For A-O-T-P, Army of the Pharaohs!
