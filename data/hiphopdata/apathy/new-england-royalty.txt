My legacy can't be beat cause my victories outshine every defeat 
 I used to blow dough for clothes now I'm reachin' the peak 
 Of tax write-offs cashin' in sneaker receipts 
 I'm a creature from the deep got freaks that'll creep 
 Drop knowledge in raps but most people are sheep 
 Grim reaper to beats, I put speakers to sleep 
 The way I speak muthafuckers won't sleep for a week 
 Insomniacs like a Saudi soldier sittin' on third shift 
 Words lift objects and make the whole earth shift 
 Was birthed with a gift when these earthlings riff 
 I'm like Galactus, comic nerds catch my drift 
 I'm spectacular, time traveler from the old days 
 I'll blow the power grid and put us back in the Stone Age 
 A million clones were made from flows I made 
 Leave more skulls displayed than the Bones Brigade 
 I disintegrate brains leavin' domes decayed 
 Military robotic dogs and drones invade 
 The homes they raid are combed and opposers slayed 
 Folks enslaved for info the hopeless trade 
 I'm from where the average'll get ripped up and ravaged 
 Even a crazed savage prays for safe passage 
 Somebody call the ambulance 
 I keep a gun in my jeans, and call 'em hammer pants 
 Use a sledgehammer for ants so cancel ya plans 
 You'll have a better chance with cancer implanted in ya glands 
 I'll tackle and stab up a woolly mammoth 
 Skin 'em and stretch the pelt for belts 
 An fresh canvas write raps and manage 
 To pull off the outlandish 
 I'm tryin' to figure how to exist without planets 
 God in training, God I'm amazing 
 A God who's gazing through telescopes and raising 
 Life forms and worlds of beings who look to the sky 
 And pray to the A-P-A-T-H-Y 
 As far as rap, I tap into the hearts of millions 
 Got it locked like wi-fi in apartment buildings 
 I'm so resilient, y'all are so reptilian 
 Bunch of snakes and villains 
 You're a waste of billions of molecules 
 I'm volatile, video tapin' women with hands taped 
 Even though you can't rape the willin' 
 I was considered a jabberwocky before them suckers were dancin' 
 Imagine enhancing the insanity of Charles Manson 
 A fast learner who studied the madness of mass murderers 
 It's like you passed a burner to someone with Aspergers 
 I'm back with a bag of the baddest automatic macs with the mags 
 Massive as a mastodon tusk to bust crabs 
 Ya flags get burned, turn 'em into dust in a urn 
 Y'all don't know when to keep ya mouth shut, but trust me you'll learn 
 You're about as gully as Fern Gully buddy 
 So I'ma leave ya body bloody 
 Stab ya stunt double, injure ya under study 
 Understand me? I'm like the step father up in ya family 
 Fuck ya mother, eat ya food and I'm rude and ya can't stand me 
 And ya momma should'a opted for "Plan B" 
 I paint vivid images I'm a mutant not a human like Stan Lee 
 Official pistol packin' pussy poppin' Posse poppin' 
 More flashes than paparazzi or Miley poppin' an Oxy 
 I'm body rockin' like Rocky with Russians 
 Erruptin' rippin' production 
 Y'all are typical as political corruption 
 I'm literally disgusting as wounds scabbing and pussing 
 From blades stabbing and thrusting 
 The Hulk smashin' and crushin', I'm buggin' 
 How did y'all really expect me to feel? 
 When y'all are sweatin' Kendrick like he reinvented the wheel 
 Don't get it twisted it was ill, he definitely got skill 
 But y'all were remixing Control like it would get you a deal 
 Crazy gay, trying to get some shine this way 
 Is like bein' a solar panel on a rainy day 
 As valuable as naked photos of Macy Grey 
 Y'all are disrespectful pissin' in the place we pray
