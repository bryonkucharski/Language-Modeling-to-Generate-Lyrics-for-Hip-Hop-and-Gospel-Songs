Make your troubles go away, blow away (x2) 
 Make your troubles... 
 (Verse 1: Suave-Ski) 
 No car, no license, I still got drive 
 And I'm still on fire when it's cold outside 
 Trying to survive, my enemies don't want me alive 
 But I'm not gonna sit back while these particles all collide 
 I'm about to pick up all the pieces, and put them back together 
 Just to floss all my thoughts, to ones that told me never 
 The water starts to rise, and collect like a debt 
 By the time, that it get to your neck, you're a wreck 
 And I bet, that you let, anybody pull you down 
 Pressure all around, muffled out sound as you start to drown 
 I'm breathing underwater like the Loch Ness 
 With old pirates' gold that's locked in wooden boxes 
 Twenty thousand leagues, where mermaids are topless 
 I'm one with the agua, like H2O droplets 
 Slave to the wave, I belong under pressure 
 I bet you never expected I'd turn you into a specter 
 Body parts on the stretcher, heart darker than Dexter 
 Snatch the varsity letter off a Harvard professor 
 My money's marketed better than stock market investors 
 You're at the Walmart register next to child molesters, ew 
 (Verse 2: Jus 'Cause) 
 If one of my old niggas tell me that life is a promise 
 It makes a liar out of everyone, just to be honest 
 Don't judge my wits on stupid shit, 'cause I'm speaking ebonics 
 I read you dumb motherfuckers, you niggas is phonics 
 Don't get hooked on, just for the days that was overlooked on 
 So let it rain, no umbrella for pain 
 I feel it down to the marrow, the skeleton what remain 
 This shit is Robert DeNiro, a raging bull in the game 
 I'm Allah, so read this like a scripture 
 I shook the whole world, think we need a new Richter 
 My own mindframe that's as vivid as a picture 
 Watch me captivate as I decapitate the victor 
 I'm all crews, man you artists are just all in my way 
 Bury you alive and watch your body just rot and decay 
 Look me in my eyes while you die and I shock in your face 
 Make you wish it wasn't Pac gone and instead it was Drake 
 Democratic pockets, campaigning with head of the states 
 With bitches who ain't giving head, but I'm fucking their face 
 It's like I'm trapped inside a scale, I'm stuck in my ways 
 Devil want my soul, I just hoping he willing to pay 
 (Verse 3: Apathy) 
 This sound fly like a Charlie Brown Christmas 
 Although it's more vicious 
 I'm all about my business, I'm calling out you bitches 
 I'm rapping then we scrapping, then I'm pulling out the stitches 
 Vanilla Godzilla, Ap's burning all his bridges 
 I travel underwater like I'm suicidal, soaking in the tub 
 Eyes open feel the motion of the flood 
 Drag me out into the ocean, buried deep under the mud 
 I'm Moses with the flow, turn the water into blood 
 Like Carrie on the stage, y'all are barely of age 
 You should be very afraid, cause Ap carries a gauge 
 And Ap carries grenades, an adversary that raids 
 And invades, I'm enraged, none escape, no one saved 
 I'm a wave, I'm a typhoon and everyone die soon 
 Saloon gun slinger, pulling triggers at high noon 
 The rising moon that makes all of the tides move 
 I'll fuck a rich cougar, I'm just one of her side dudes 
 I'm in one of my moods you'll never survive through 
 Ap is so driven, you just work in a drive-through 
 So write a diss record that I'll never reply to 
 I'll say a voodoo spell and put a devil inside you 
 Make your troubles go away, blow away (x2)
