I sit upon a cloud of nuclear waste, this haste 
 The orgasmic juice of a goddess with her lips spread on my face 
 As I speak in space touching a damaged piece of a satellite 
 Resembling wrecking remnants of a 2010 soliloquy 
 Entity, centuries from the time of man designed a plan 
 Of a time span of seconds to an immortal 
 Transport immortals in portals toward an Egyptian land 
 To then erect complex architect structures and pyramids 
 Melted parted rock with acidic chemical blood samples 
 From reptilian females' periods, I travel like the Iliad 
 But my ship sails amongst cosmic whales and intergalactic pirates 
 Telling tales of trails left by the gods 
 Through the center of the sun when they passed the spot 
 Jesus Christ was really an ancient astronaut 
 I attacked mastodons when I crashed upon thrown in the Ice Age 
 And twice laid men's caves with a system of sound waves 
 And psycho-kinetics, you can't escape the wrath of APATHETIC 
 The time has come for man to die, not project prophetic phonetics 
 Fugitive prosthetic limbs for hairy ??? rejects 
 Exoskeleton extensions of cybernetic inventions 
 Moving swiftly like a Thundercat, my hunger tracks rats on the train tracks 
 And when I rap on tracks I attract tremendous energy sources 
 Changing force through metamorphous 
 I travel darkened corridors with orbs of light and torches 
 We ride away on apocalyptic bear-horses 
 And disappear as shadows in the forest 
 And disappear as shadows in the forest 
 Non-conceptual, non-exceptional 
 Your whole aura is plexiglas 
 I take hold of truth eludes me like sand through the cracks in my hands 
 Retaliatory silhouettes in apocalyptic lands 
 Nomadic by the second, but I can't let this stress get the best of me 
 Though it test me on a daily basis 
 And traces the tracks of my tears down my cheeks and over my lips 
 Taste the freedom though it seems like gravity 
 As we're chained to this pathetic land like Satan's left burning in Chaos 
 But yet I continue on with no tendencies in my subconscious 
 So right there's a contradiction, because I'm aware of these tendencies 
 So that ain't my subconscious anymore 
 More like forces that I conversate with, halves thirds and fourths 
 That I sliced my soul into a percentage 
 I know you wouldn't recommend it, so I wrote this letter and never sent it 
 'Cause my pain, is my pain, I won't trouble you with my own 
 Now I swim through waves of asphalt with no place to call home 
 Yan on the lonely island and see a plastic smile speaking gibberish 
 At varying frequencies, burn out the radio and television transmissions 
 Or simply audible voices who wear the robes of righteousness 
 Equilibrium is fucked up from data overload 
 Enhanced by the fact that I walk on a narrow road 
 That's more like a tightrope between wisdom and insanity 
 Seems like clarity is the ever elusive goal 
 When insanity has the help of the omnipotent force of gravity 
 On the battleground you can go to war like Sudan 
 But I'm half-man and so you have to ovastand 
 That the other half of me is made of liquid and steel 
 Ain't you sick and tired of people screaming "keep it real?" 
 I'm powered by the ancients, spirit in the soul 
 It's war, and Ikon carries crossbows 
 But I toss foes through the center of the planet 
 When you battle me, you best be praying like a mantis 
 I will send you, through the depths of the Atlantic 
 To study transcripts of rhymes by the enchanted 
 Hologram, the verbal war paradigm 
 Traveling back in time to change the way y'all wack rappers rhyme 
 If I don't succeed you will bleed 
 The just punishment of the Apostle's Creed 
 This is hip-hop kid, shit is straight from the heart 
 You's a actor with a record deal trying to play the part 
 Like that, like that one time like that one time like that one time 
 Uh, my man Stoupe in the house like that one time like that one time 
 My man, Chico in the house like that one time like that one time 
 My man Yan the Phenomenon, in the house, like that one time one time 
 Ikon the Verbal Hologram, up in the muthafucka 
 Open up that third time before I open it for you 
 Word is bond, Jedi Mind, '97, '98 
 Rappers, I decapitate like that 
 Fuck all y'all!
