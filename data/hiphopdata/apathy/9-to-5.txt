(Feat. Emilio Lopez) 
 (Lady voice Sample:) 
 I can tell it must've... 
 (Jay-Z sample:) 
 9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive 
 I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive 
 (Emilio Lopez:) 
 Picture Emilio plotting cashing checks 
 Living life is a square taking average thefts 
 I can't see that, multibillionaire, I wanna be that 
 Fooling bitches on the beach, tell me where the weed at 
 Never liked school, college, I don't wanna do that 
 Some niggers told me I was nice thinkin' that I do raps 
 Still live amongst fiends, so I might move that 
 Swallow pride 9 to 5, I ain't going through to that 
 (Apathy:) 
 It's something about knowing my mother is still working 
 And it's certain that her back hurting, and it'll probably worsen 
 That lengthens my hustle, strengthens my struggle 
 Stacking up dough until the banks are in trouble 
 So call me a capitalist, consider us savages 
 'Cause we rob and kill and live lives lavishness 
 Broke mind state only get me mad 
 I rather be a sugar daddy than a deadbeat dad 
 (Apathy and Emilio together:) 
 No matter how hard it gets I won't stop till I'm gettin' it 
 (Lady voice Sample:) 
 I can tell it must've...

 9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive 
 I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

 Check this, gotta have dough to pull a bad bitch 
 Some cats swish, others throw a fast pitch 
 Motherfuckers like me, just prefer a fast flip 
 Life get bigger, the bigger the cash get 
 (Apathy:) 
 Cash get, motherfuckers in trouble like asbest 
 Past depths, put expensive suits in caskets 
 Cause some cats get gats and blow their ????? 
 When it comes to getting money, study all the aspects 
 (Emilio Lopez:) 
 Assets liabilities, gotta get business wise 
 Labels wanna jerk us, don't get victimized 
 Records gotta sell so the raps gets simplified 
 But I do what I gotta, as long as the chips are high 
 (Apathy:) 
 I know better but I want the nice whips and buy 
 Mansion enhanced with wifey and the kids inside 
 MTV would think the crib is too big and wide 
 I strive to be rich, always throw some chips aside 
 (Apathy and Emilio together:) 
 No matter how hard it gets I won't stop till I'm gettin' it

 (Bridge x4: Apathy and Emilo Lopez) 
 'Cause when the money comes slow 
 Life moves slow 
 When the cash comes fast 
 Put your troubles in the past 
 (Apathy:) 
 I used to never really sweat it, now wifey got me fixing my credit 
 Cause in the long run, you live to regret it 
 (Emilio Lopez:) 
 Then you bank is pathetic, your schedule is hectic 
 And 9 to 5 is always the state of being perfected 
 (Apathy:) 
 As a child we were living off government cheese 
 (Emilio Lopez) 
 As a teen I was living off hustlin trees 
 (Apathy:) 
 Nowadays being broke is a fucking disease 
 (Emilio Lopez:) 
 So I stay clutching them G'z 
 (Apathy:) 
 And brushing my sleeves 
 (Apathy and Emilio together:) 
 No matter how hard it gets I won't stop till I'm gettin' it 
 (Lady voice Sample:) 
 I can tell it must've...
