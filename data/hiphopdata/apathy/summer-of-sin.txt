Forces of good and evil seem to reach their peak 
 Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil {x4} 
 Another 
 Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil 
 Summer 
 Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil 
 Full of 
 Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil 
 Sin 
 Cape Cod, Block Island 
 Got your whole block whiling 
 Richport to Newport 
 Nothing funny stop smiling, money piling 
 Sun shining, unwinding, water blinding 
 Ray-Bans polarize, no disguise, summertime 
 In New England, on a boat with a few woman 
 Who's swimming? 
 Start sniffing talking quicker than the Fu-Schnickens 
 Get out my Beamer bitch your bathing suit is still dripping 
 Why you tripping, can't you see I'm on a mission 
 Girls kissing, this is cool 
 Stay sipping till I'm pissing in the pool 
 Last day skipping school as a teen 
 Now I'm all about cash and vagine 
 Maybe fuck her in the ass with a lil' vaseline 
 In the bubble, don't struggle 
 Get your money and hussle 
 I'm chilling at the Oyster Club 
 Princet with island mussels 
 And I radiate cool like the Fonz 
 But I'm hotter than the sun 
 Fucking blondes till their skin turns bronze 
 With a bom-bom puking liquor on the homies lawn 
 People quoting they songs like they were holy Qurans 
 You want a Boston Whaler or Skiff, inhaling a spliff 
 Dick stiff, getting throat while your little boat drift 
 That's New England lifestyle homie 
 Peep the pedigree 
 My Ouija board channels energy from dead Kennedy's 
 Like Caroline's dad got a maritime flag 
 On the cover for the summer with designer travel bags 
 I'm... 
 Beats everyday and pray for heavy waves 
 Got a bitch named Becky who dress like Bettie Page 
 Better chill, 'fore I chase her around like Benny Hill 
 Fuck her in Poision Ivy patch, where's the Benadryl? 
 Summers magic, back and forth 
 You can find me at the shore 
 Arguing if we should take the born on the Sagamore 
 Foul mouth Falmouth kids are loving my rap 
 'Cause I represent the East 
 Putting New England on the map 
 From Stonington Borough all the way to North Truro 
 In like, less than three hours with the Audi Turbo 
 It's like, I like loud music 
 Party invader 
 That's word to your mothers black dog wind breaker 
 I'm so nautical, Nautica's not an option 
 And jocking the J Crew that I'm rocking 
 I'm so popping I'm popular 
 Pop shots at the rappers who rap regular 
 Retina scans the infrared signature like a predator 
 Ap for president preference of people who represent 
 The place of my residence 
 And you can see evidence 
 All the way from Connecticut out to Venice with Evidence 
 My sentence will shake up the oceans floor and stir the sediments 
 Bodies bobbing on the water surface like a buoy 
 Hootchies with the coochie cut her shorts showing booty 
 This is not a movie, this is really and truly an East Coast summertime, so unruly I'm...
