(Feat. C-Murder, Master P) 
 (Master P) 
 Can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till our tank's on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 (Mafia talking) 
 Today, I'd like to welcome a few souljas (welcome) 
 To this No Limit world (No Limit world). 
 A world where we've been preachers (huh Bro) 
 Harassed (harassed) and even incarcerated for making it (fuckin' FBI) 
 And chasing the finer things (fuckin' government) 
 Even though we legit, (you fuckin' cockroaches) 
 Ghetto millionaires (millionaires man) 
 Society still tryin' to cage us in (open the big bin man) 
 But today, (today) today I say fuck the world (fuck the world) 
 As we made it, Silkk the Shocker (Silkk the Shocker) 
 C-Murder (C-Murder, bossalinie) 
 And Master P... Made men (da last don) 
 (Master P) 
 Ughhhhhh... 
 We can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 I got a pawn for the week, meet me up the street 
 See momma gotta eat, how much for a key 
 See my bank from ghetto blood, when my homies show me love 
 When hotboys run the streets, it was tanks and hugs 
 Niggas ain't gotta hustle no more, easy come, easy go 
 No limit should be platinum before the shit hits the store 
 With my cutless he could get his mind right 
 And (trey hamm?) loved the lime light 
 Big boys pushin' dimes right, 
 And y'all hatas y'all don't wanna fight 
 Ughhhhhh... 
 We can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 (C-Murder) 
 I visualize gettin' shot by the bullets of my enemies 
 Rest in peace, to all my fallen homies 
 Young souljas turned victim at the full moon 
 I still shiver when I glance at my war wounds 
 Niggas feel my justice, and facial expression 
 So many mother's shed tears I guess they learned they lesson 
 Cause TRU niggas make the world go round 
 The world ain't never been the same since the last don put it down 
 T-R-U, M-O-B, till the day we die 
 We represent the intercity, the dark side 
 We made men, made from the realest niggas thoughts 
 With the game from our veins straight to the heart 
 Nigga, feel it, know what I'm sayin' 
 We represent the made men till the day we die 
 Silkk the Shocker (Made Men) 
 (Master P) 
 Riders, Ughhhhhhhhhhhh... 
 We can't stop till our tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tanks on the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Made man, y'all motherfuckers know me 
 It's like the world is mine, you livin' in it, y'all niggas owe me 
 'Cause I see death before I see life, death before I see white 
 Death for a price, by the shotty left of the vice 
 My only advice is I'm a thug, nigga, now ride once killas 
 See you don't wanna test my tank doggs, you don't wanna test me nigga 
 It's like I, beef with the top, sleep with a glock 
 One hollow be paranoid, just like I, sleep at watch 
 It ain't my fault, if we had to take it to war 
 Might not be that serious, but you x-ed out if I take it to heart 
 I'm a made man, that means y'all can test it anytime, 
 And so many niggas wanna see me not make it 
 I'm a ball till I fall, all of us, me, P, C, 
 The whole No Limit nigga, I'm a made man, ha ha... 
 (Master P) 
 Ughhhhhh... 
 We can't stop till the tank's at the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tank's at the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tank's at the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We can't stop till the tank's at the wall 
 'Cause we made men and we goin' ball till we fall 
 We goin' ball till we fall nigga, 
 From the south, to the east, to the west, 
 And up north nigga, and to my little young nigga, 
 Free, in New York, keep your eyes open nigga, 
 Think with your mind and not with your soul, 
 That's how you free your pain, 
 That's how you become a made man...
