Steped out my house wit some Daniel Greens on 
 House wit Versace and shit but I just throw some jeans on 
 Picked up my phone, called my niggas but they wasn't at home 
 Shit mo like this (beep, beep) leave a message after the tone 
 Front back side to side in my 64 just 'cause I rap everyboby see me everybody 
 Start to hit the floor 
 I be like ugn ugn dog I don, t do that shit no mo 
 Everybody come on everybody get they jewels and wallets and shit ev'rybody get 
 Up of the floor 
 See I got a benz I can choose either the white or the black one 
 Dollar billz I stack um 
 Hallz full of platnium 
 Ugh un and y'all don't want to try to jack son 
 Last nigga that tried, he died 
 Wish you could ask him 
 Use to walk In the bank be like I know he a thief 
 Now I walk to cash my checks with no I.D. 
 Everything I drop picture this It got to be sick 
 Like he ain't far from C.E.O. so that nigga got to be rich 
 Put It like this every week of the year cop me a six 
 Do the sports year one year then cop two lottery picks 
 I'm tryin' to ball I could give a fuck what y'all got 
 My motto Is why get a car when I can buy the car lot 
 If It don't make dollas It don't make sense 
 If It don't make dollas then It just don't make sense 
 If It don't make dollas It don't make sense 
 I'm bout to represent I'm to get presidents 
 It's like mo money mo money mo money 
 No Limit the only way to go know why cause that's foshow money 
 I went from, holdup I'm trippin' ah oh yeah I know I went from rolex's 
 To better rolex's 
 The plane kind to the kind with big head bezel's 
 Cutlass to benzes to a house on the hill 
 Worth more than a mill and I still keep It reel 
 I got more style nigga than haircuts 
 Let my nuts hang to the floor they bigger that beer nuts 
 Now you can ask p when you she him he'll tell ya dog I'm priceless 
 That's why my jewel's and shit will remain iceless 
 Now either you're with me or against me dog 
 You did'nt like me before you really ain't gone like me no why I ain't 
 Beginning to ball 
 I did charge It to the game nigga In less than two weeks 
 So I'm a take my time on made man and do It In 3 
 Now when I rap y'all gone to have to feel my flow 
 Other rap niggas make one hit and never hear them no mo 
 That could never be me though 
 Before I stop silk the shocker then turn C-E-O 
 Money money money that's all I know 
 I'm trying to figure out I'm trying to have enough to get all my dogs up out 
 The ghetto 
 It's like mo money mo money mo money no limit the on way to go 
 Cause that's foshow money 
 If It don't make dollas then I don't want to make It 
 If it don't have four or five zero's behind it I don't wan't to take It 
 If it's a lexas why get a three when I can get a four 
 Why drive a five when I can drive a six 
 If It's the dope game why buy a once when I can buy a brick 
 Instead of buying a four I brought a four five so I can hide my wrist bitch 
 See most of my time Is spent up in the air 
 I'm on a airphone talking down to the mayor
