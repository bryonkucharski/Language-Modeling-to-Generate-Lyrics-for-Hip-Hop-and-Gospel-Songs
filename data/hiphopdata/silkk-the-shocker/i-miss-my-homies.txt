(Featuring Pimp see Silkk The Shocker) 
 I want y'all to play this at funerals in the hood. 
 Till all this black on black crime stop. 
 Some say the blind lead the blind. 
 But in the ghetto you never know 
 When it's gon be yo time. 
 (Sons of Funk Mo B. Dick O'dell) 
 Sittin' at the ghetto thinkin' bout 
 All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!) 
 Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold 
 That's how me and my boys rolled 
 How could it be? 
 Somebody took my boy from me 
 My best friend's gone 
 And I'm so all alone 
 I really miss my homies 
 Even though they gone away 
 I know you in a better place 
 And I hope to see ya soon someday 
 (Master P) 
 I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy 
 Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy 
 We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds 
 In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt 
 The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin 
 Still blowin' dolja fo ya 'cause I know you up there workin 
 Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight 
 But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face 
 From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall 
 In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall 
 In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star 
 But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car 
 A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried 
 You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire 
 Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain 
 Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change 
 Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall 
 The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals 
 Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!) 
 Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli) 
 All my homies who done made it to the crossroads 
 (Biggie Smalls) 
 (Sons, Mo B. O'dell) 
 How could it be? 
 Somebody took my boy from me 
 (It's like I can't believe you gone) 
 My best friend's gone 
 (Sometimes I feel like I can't go on) 
 And I'm so all alone 
 (Everytime I see something you done left 
 I really miss my homies 
 (It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg) 
 Even though they gone away 
 (I just keep reminiscin) 
 I know you in a better place 
 ('Cause I know you all right) 
 And I hope to see ya soon someday 
 (And I keep smilin', knowin' I'm a see you in the crossroads] 
 (Pimp C) 
 We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys 
 But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy 
 Off in the club smokin' weed till 3, hollerin at the hoes 
 Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes 
 When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game 
 Nigga told me, "see, leave that dope, cause rappin' is yo thang" 
 I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry 
 Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die 
 So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind 
 I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time 
 I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs 
 For all the niggas in the game that be sellin ki's 
 I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong 
 But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone 
 (Sons, Mo B. O'dell) 
 Even though you gone away 
 (Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten) 
 I know you in a better place 
 (Cause as long as I'm here 
 You gon live through me and other TRU playas) 
 I really miss my homies 
 Even though they gone away 
 I know you in a better place 
 And I hope to see ya soon someday 
 (Silkk) 
 I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' bout all the times we had 
 Thinkin' the past, some was good and some was bad 
 Remember Dante? 
 It was a group of us, just a group of five 
 Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive 
 To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace 
 When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies 
 He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me 
 Wishin I could rewind time like demos 
 Me and you gettin' girls, writin down numbers like memos 
 Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos 
 Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry 
 But if I close my eyes and visualize me together 
 Then I suddenly want to smile 
 To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up 
 You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us 
 Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true 
 You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos 
 See me and see and P forever gon be ridin' and thuggin' 
 Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it 
 And rest in peace to my brother 
 We gon miss you 
 (I love these fools) 
 I know you in a better place 
 (Every time I get on my knees) 
 And I hope to see ya soon someday 
 (I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place 
 I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin' 
 Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)
