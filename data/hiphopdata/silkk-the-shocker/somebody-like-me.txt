(Al, I know we from different sides and all 
 And I ain't even gon lie, I'm a thug 
 But I got a guestion for you 
 Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me 
 What's up? 
 (Mya) 
 So what you wanna do 
 A girl like me, a guy like you 
 What we could do 
 It's whatever baby anything that we want to 
 Will I fall for a thug like you 
 (Silkk) 
 Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um 
 In fact if you could 
 I got money now 
 Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood 
 Now during sex lay there I'ma have to ask if it's good 
 This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods 
 When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like 
 Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type 
 But I'm ready to change, 
 I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it 
 Put powerful things on it 
 Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it 
 Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash 
 And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad 
 I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship 
 A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with 
 Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with 
 You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead 
 Take the six 
 Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right 
 You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life 
 What's up 
 (Mya) 
 You keep, keep on askin me 
 If I, say if I wanna be with you 
 The tough part is to think I could 
 Fall for some body like you 
 (Silkk) 
 You advanced, took a couple chances and shit 
 Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin' in 
 Mansions and shit 
 You done gambled with this thug and won 
 You know what I'm sayin' it's thug life 
 Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run 
 I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me 
 Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 
 Then sky's the limit 
 We on the west on the beach, we takin' trips to the east 
 Takin' shoppin' sprees till they damn near hurt our feet 
 Got you a five when you like smashed the four 
 Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door 
 Step out the house it's more like a fashion show 
 Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta 
 Ask no more... imagine that 
 (Mya) 
 It never really mattered too much to me 
 That you were just too damn ghetto for me 
 All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you 
 So now I try to sneak away to be with you 
 (Silkk) 
 Every woman need a down man 
 (Mya) 
 Every man need a down chick 
 (Silkk) 
 Watch your so-called friends 
 (Mya) 
 Watch them niggas you hang around with 
 (Silkk) 
 I need somebody I can be serious with 
 (Mya) 
 I need somebody I can clown with 
 (Silkk) 
 It's thug love and I think I found it 
 (Mya) 
 Will I fall 
 For this thug 
 Will I fall for a thug like youSilkk) 
 For re
