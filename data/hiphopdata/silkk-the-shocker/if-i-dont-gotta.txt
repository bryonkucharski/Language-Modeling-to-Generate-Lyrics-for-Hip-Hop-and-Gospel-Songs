Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "If I Don't Gotta" 
 (Feat. Fiend, Master P) 
 (Silkk and Master P talking) 
 Yo, P was happening dog 
 Ah man, it's still a dross you know, but the game then change these 
 Youngstas than made it bad, you know we all about our paper but some of 
 These fools just make and take murder. 
 They want it the easy way. 
 See I don't want to be here, 
 If I don't gotta, 
 My weed habit, is so close to snorting powder, 
 Got a few bitches, but it's all about a dollar, 
 And they don't holla, unless you moving narcota 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 I'm just sitting in my Cadillac 
 Riding on some triple gold 
 Smoking octamos, nigga 
 Shining up my vogues 
 Thanking this hoe called me, 
 And she was tripping out 
 Say I had a baby by her, 
 Figuring I was taking out 
 I'm just trying stack a meal, no what I'm saying 
 That shit real, trying to hide and dodge, 
 But I can't seem to hid my fucking bill 
 On how to cook dope, and chop a key 
 My brother showed me that 
 I only live once, guess what 
 A dope fiend told me that 
 These hoes be trying to holla 
 It seems that I got riches 
 When I got money, I got bitches 
 I got friends that want to get it 
 Can he hit it, then quit it 
 To try to survive and stay alive 
 It's a everyday struggle, every day hustle 
 You can see it in my eye, but I don't want to die 
 I don't want to be here 
 If I don't gotta 
 I got friends and bitches, but they don't holla 
 If I don't got narcotas or dollars, I 
 (Master P talking) 
 Damn, check this out Elror 
 It's real out here, you heard me, huh bro 
 (Fiend) 
 Man I might have a daughter 
 No money, no life 
 Check it shocker, just bills, hanging because 
 Not giving, a fuck, and I'm telling you what's real 
 You want to know what kill 
 Most of these niggas on these streets, is jive 
 I don't know why, these you cats out here 
 Thank they got nine lives 
 I die for me, with pride 
 And I then lost the closes thing to me 
 Pretty fucked up trading, 
 Or I got some killas that want to do me 
 Them girls trying to blue me 
 What all I trying do, is what I love 
 Let my people know I feel them,(?) 
 And then go smoke some bud 
 I got a habit with drugs 
 Which I ain't suggesting for beginners 
 In my hood, ain't no winners, 
 Just some thugging ass sinners 
 Presenta, my life, my life, and take a good view 
 My bad days, I wouldn't dare 
 Wanna wish them upon you. 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Now see I didn't ask to come here 
 I guest untwisted faith of luck 
 15 minutes of unprotected sex, 
 In a heat of moment, came a quick ass nut 
 Now if I wouldn't been born 
 I wouldn't grew, I wouldn't knew 
 Never had to go through, half the tangs a nigga went through 
 I'm in the projects hearing gunshots 
 Right before I close my eyes 
 All I heard was one shot 
 And they only sent one cop when he died 
 I got some questions 
 That I couldn't really understand for awhile 
 They say rain brang pain 
 But what brang smiles 
 And see I guess I was to caught up in those fake niggas 
 And bitches to know 
 I guess I was blind by the fast money, 
 And switches on the 64 
 They gotta, gotta be a better way out, 
 Then hell or jail 
 I know I'm wrong for selling dope to my family 
 Just to get mail 
 Some get high off of sess 
 To relieve their stress 
 But no matter, how much success 
 You can't cheat death 
 Where yal at 
 (Master P talking) 
 Heard that, can't get no realler than this 
 I don't want to be here if I don't have to.
