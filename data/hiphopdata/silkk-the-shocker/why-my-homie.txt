Master P) 
 Damn. I never thought I'd be wearin a suit and tie so many times a year, but 
 Like Bone said, to all my homies ain't here, see ya in the crossroads, fool 
 Imagine this, me dressed in all black 
 At a funeral strapped with a chrome gat 
 Who died P, I guess it was my homie, black 
 Somebody rolled up and shot him in the back 
 It was sad, my homie took a damn fall 
 Sort of like the TLC video, "Waterfalls" 
 But this was the real deal, this ain't no movie 
 Niggaz drove up and blasted my homie with a oozie 
 Now me and Silkk got to ride 
 After the funeral 'cause it's sad on my side 
 Cause in the ghetto, it's one big black moon 
 I mean people dyin' everyday, we all are doomed 
 My mama look at me and say, "Boy, watch yoself!" 
 But I can't trip, mama, 'cause I live for myself 
 And if I die on the streets, then it's my time to go 
 But if I live to see another day, another funeral 
 It's sad, I look into they eyes 
 Damn, everybody's got to die 
 But one day, I guess we gon to wake up 
 When they puttin' me in that black truck 
 It could be you, it could be her 
 But in the end everybody gets did up 
 Cause in the ghetto everybody live like Jesse James 
 I still question God for callin my homie name 
 Chorus I (2X): Why my homie had to die? 
 Now somebody mama gonna cry 
 (Silkk) 
 Now when my grandfather died, I was like 5, it never really touched me much 
 But seein my brother layin dead on floor really kinda fucked me up 
 I never thought he could be here then he could be gone 
 I never thought the day he left the house he wouldn't be comin' back home 
 I wonder when it's yo time to go, who gon protect you 
 See someone died in my family, didn't even much affect you 
 I wonder why my homie died at such a young age 
 I wonder why my homie death didn't make the front page 
 'Cause it's a trip, and life ain't even worth to live 
 See ya gotta watch out for all us killa kids 
 Belive me, I be a youngsta tryin' to spit the game 
 But it's a damn shame, all of the shit done changed 
 Through all the strivin and strugglin I try to stay hard 
 But look at Mr. President in the White House tryin' to play God 
 Put us all in one big ole boat 
 They call it housin projects, I call it one big ghetto 
 Damn. Looks like the Statue of Liberty is cryin 
 I guess that mean the whole world is fuckin' dyin'
