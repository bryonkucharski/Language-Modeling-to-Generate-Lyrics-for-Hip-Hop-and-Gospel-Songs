 Yo Snoop, you and Silkk remember that shit called dumb girl?

 Where they at, where they at, where they at

 Where they at, where they at, where they at

 I heard you jocking Master P 'cause he got a Mercedes 
 And you want to be his lady and probably have his baby 
 You just want to ride and get inside 
 So y'all can roll around town like Bonnie and Clyde 
 But we don't trip we just pack that heat 
 How many thug nigga bitches want to ride with me 
 Thug girl 
 Where they at, where they at, where they at 
 Where they at, where they at 
 I'm looking for a thug girl 
 Where they at, where they at, where they at

 Hey yo P, trip, these Hollywood hoes is cute 
 But they braids is ?????, I don't know 
 I'd rather fuck with a thug girl 
 'Cause they're minus some steady, so here we go 
 I had one named Valore she owned a clothes store 
 And she wanted to roll with a nigga like me on tour 
 I said look here girl, are you so sure 
 And she said Doggy Dogg, there's nothing I want more 
 Your the best thing I ever had 
 I want to love you forever and make you my babies dad 
 I ain't mad but I ain't glad 
 Besides, I rise a bitch and I can't be had 
 She wanted to take the ring off my finger 
 So I slapped the bitch up like we was on Jerry Springer 
 I had to teach her 'cause she loved to tangle 
 Don't you know that thug girls love gangbangers 
 I'm looking for a thug girl 
 (Master P) 
 I'm looking for a thug girl

 I'm looking for a thug girl 
 Where they at, where they at, where they at

 (Silkk The Shocker) 
 They wish they knew why a girl like you 
 Would do all the things that you do 
 But they should understand that you our biggest fan 
 And you don't want to sweat, you want to thug for a man 
 Now every nigga need a thug girl and miss you're mine 
 I wrote this rhyme just for your kind 
 Now you the flyest girl up in the whole place 
 Cause you walk around with that thug look on your face 
 Now since I'm a thug I keeps it cocked back 
 Ain't no love I'm a thug nigga and real thug girls jock that
