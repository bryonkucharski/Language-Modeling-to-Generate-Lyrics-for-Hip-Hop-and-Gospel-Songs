See y'all niggas think I'm tripping 'cause I'm on that doja 
 See y'all true niggas 
 One reason I'm spiitin' this game to y'all niggas 
 Nigga cause 'I want y'all niggas to watch ya motherfuckin' self 
 Motherfuckin' f-e-d's be followin' niggas out in the projects 
 All in a niggas car, all on planes and boats 
 Just like deez niggas and deez hoes 
 Tired of motherfuckers followin' me man take another route 
 Nigga somebody else, keep ya eyes open fool 
 I always feel like somebody's watchin' me 
 I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in this dope game 
 I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man 
 I ain't never had nothing in my whole life 
 I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice 
 I'm paranoid, I can't sleep 'cause I done stole a key 
 Peep out the window unmarked car after me 
 My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0 
 But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks 
 I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck 
 So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk 
 The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back 
 That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac 
 They said p where ya going man get in 
 Put the gat to his head said interstate 10 
 Play it off, play it off while I do a trick 
 Take me to the project to meet my bitch 
 100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like 
 Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west 
 I was pullin up out the driveway 
 Car been parked since Friday 
 I looked and look back it wasn't there 
 But I saw him followin on the highway 
 And I today know that I'm gonna blast 
 See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted 
 And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there 
 But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there 
 But be seen in places without even bein there 
 And it seems like I'm in a different time zone 
 This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone 
 Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep 
 I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me 
 It got me noid, it got me noid 
 It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid 
 I beez more paranoid than a fugitive 
 Because I choose to live pro life 
 When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock 
 For all them haters with the scandolous plots 
 The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots 
 But I forgot the way they did ya boy 
 That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy 
 They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth 
 Torture me until I tell 'em about my man and point the dope house out 
 I used to be about the same drama game 
 That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains 
 You know the name mia x the biggest momma 
 Ghetto sara lee at the store 
 Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho' 
 The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always 
 Tryin' to get in the best players spot and knockin' 
 Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin 
 Throw in mo salt than martin 
 When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones 
 They try to get me slung on my back 
 Got to watch the jealousy acts so black 
 My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin' 
 For all them crooks that be out creepin' 
 I feel they watchin' me 
 They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply 
 Keep an open eye for all them haters
