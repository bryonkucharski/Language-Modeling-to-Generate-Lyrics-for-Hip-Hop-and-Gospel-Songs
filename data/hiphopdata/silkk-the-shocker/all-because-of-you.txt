Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do 
 Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do 
 Mia X: It's all because of you I know what hot boys do 
 Silkk: And it's all because of you I know what hot girls do 
 (Mia X) 
 It's all because of you 
 I know what hot boys do and that's why I don't trust 'em 
 I make sure it's all about me ain't even trying to love 'em 
 'Cause I know you're type hot boys don't wanna do right 
 Screwing everything then have the nerve to wanna have a good wife 
 Nah bump that baby get ya sneakers and ya beeper 
 Let the door knob hit ya 
 I bought this house ya heard me I'ma shine without ya mista 
 It's the biggest Mama Mia X independent bringing weight to 
 The table I'm financial stable and able 
 To let you know what I'm not gone tolerate 
 Pay for everything I got you can't throw shit 
 In my face wait a minute let me finish my name ain't Sparkle 
 No promises from ten years ??? Sees nothing but the chase 
 Sees one kind of mista on a mission 
 Paper chasing building things with a sister 
 I get caught up in my rapture ??? got you like a groupie 
 Gimp but you ain't getting inside ride with me 
 Oh no floss of my dough floss me on your arm 
 Boo I don't think so fantasize about the sex 
 Even lie on your I suck what rode who nah 
 I ain't that chick think y'all can screw beaucoup hoes same time 
 Have a wife giving broads two bills they think they living the life 
 I rather stack my own digits make my world and spin in 
 And call you just another citizen living in it ya heard me?

 (Silkk) 
 It's all because of you I know what women they do and umm... 
 Everything my homie said turned out to be tru 
 Either ya too easy or ya too greedy I can't figure it out 
 I'm like forget it who need it 
 If I wasn't Silkk the Shocker would like really try to sweat me 
 I always had girls but not like Halle and Vanessa 
 Calling me on three talking about how they gon' do me 
 Shit I love my fans but I ain't gone be messing with y'all groupies 
 Or either you hoochies 
 Coming to my concert talking about 
 Silkk if you 'bout it you would and showing me they coochie 
 I'm like back up but see I might mess with 'em put my trust in em 
 I just trust 'em to be women ya heard me? 
 Now see my car and she was like I ain't got no plans 
 See my crib and stuff and she was like I ain't got no man 
 If I give her a gift she be like girl that fool is laying 
 If I give her a kiss she be like that's my man he love he just be playing 
 So I might give you a gift but don't think I'm a trick 
 I just like to treat real women like they my number one chick 
 But I know when a women ain't tru black 
 So when she mess up Ibe like I already knew that 
 You why 'cause women do that ya heard me?

 And everything homie said 'bout you was tru what
