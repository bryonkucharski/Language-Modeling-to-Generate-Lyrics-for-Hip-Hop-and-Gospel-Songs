Yo and this is No Limit records 
 I am Snoop D O motherfuckin' double G 
 Partyin' with my [unverified] Silkk The Shocker 
 You a made man now nigga, yeah 
 Year round party 
 Y'all get 'em up, get it up 
 What up Snoop? 
 Wake up, jump out of bed and get dressed 
 My life is a mess, nah better yet it's a test 
 I snatched the chopper from the coppers then put on my vest 
 Life's a baseball game out west 
 Oh yes, you rockin' with the best 
 The S N double O P, your grandmama know me 
 So for all my homegirls and all my homies 
 Ain't no limit picnic and it's on me 
 Our world is G, so roll with me 
 And Silkk The Shocker and grab some gin for this vodka 
 Got summertime rockin' for your jeeps and trucks 
 Big June Bug in the house, what up? 
 Got a jar full of dope and a box of blunts 
 Hoes in the house, if you see 'em turn 'em out 
 Bitches walkin' by sayin' 'hi' to me 
 And niggas givin' dat 'cause they ride with me 
 We goin' throw a party so my homies come and chill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All the hoes invited so you know we goin' get ill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 We goin' throw a party so ladies come and chill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All my dogs invited so we gotta keep it real 
 Yo, yo, yo it ain't nothin' but a N O L I M I to the T 
 Party, so all my dogs could ride with me 
 Hopped out the drop, the drivers side of course 
 You seen me somewhere before, you did 
 Probably was in the Vibe or the Source 
 You know what I do when it's time to floss 
 I'm a do it, you know I ain't got time to talk 
 But I see somethin' in the corner and she lookin' kinda fly 
 I tell my dog Snoop 
 (Psst psst) 
 Man you might as well go ahead and stop me 
 (Lemme holla at you dog) 
 She done met up with a star, eye contact 
 I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar 
 I told her I keep ice on my wrist, tight keep ice on my chin 
 And I'll still respect you tomorrow and tonight I hit it 
 But you only got a couple minutes to choose 
 And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose 
 In a minute I'm a hop in my ride, if you in this cool 
 If not ya gotta make a decision by the time I finish my food 
 Now what? 
 We goin' throw a barbecue so niggas light the grill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All my dogs invited so you know we goin' get ill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 We goin' throw a barbecue so ladies light the grill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All my dogs invited so you got to keep it real 
 Now I used to be on the block, 
 Now I'm in the drop chillin' with Snoop 
 But I walk through the door I feel animosity 
 (Oh, you feelin' it too) 
 Probably 'cause we say our name we could be stealin' they booth 
 Probably 'cause I'm platinum, we dark, could be chillin' at two 
 (The South West connect, big chains on our neck 
 Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck) 
 Aight Snoop, you got the weed 
 (Yeah) 
 And I got the liquor 
 (Fa sho) 
 Meach got the food but who got the strippers 
 (I don't know) 
 'Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove 
 (Whassup) 
 And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove 
 And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold 
 When we give somethin', call us, it's outta control 
 So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall 
 (Look for somethin' big from Silkk and Top Dogg 
 We party with nothin' but bud, nothin' but thugs) 
 East to West, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin' but love 
 (Yeah) 
 Fuck 
 We goin' throw a barbecue so niggas light the grill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All my dogs invited so you know we goin' get ill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 We goin' throw a barbecue so ladies light the grill 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 All my dogs invited so you got to keep it real 
 (Give it up, get it up) 
 Ain't nothin' but a party, baby 
 G'z out here goin' crazy 
 How the world goin' even fade us 
 Either love or hate us 
 Ain't nothin' but a party, baby 
 Two low down G'z goin' crazy 
 Yeah, ain't nothin' but a, huh 
 And my cell phone goin' off in this bitch, what 
 Yeah, ha, we ain't even trippin' dog 
 Shout out to the whole world 
 What this the end 
 Till next time, I'm out
