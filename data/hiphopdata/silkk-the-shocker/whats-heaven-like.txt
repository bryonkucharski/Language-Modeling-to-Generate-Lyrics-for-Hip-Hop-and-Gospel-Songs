Yeah... 
 I Don't Know What Heaven Like 
 But I know what it is to be here 
 And While I'm here, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to survive 
 And hope that, when God judge me 
 He judge me by my heart and not by my actions 
 Shhh let them know what heaven like. 
 I really wanna know what's Heaven Like 
 (Wanna know what's heaven like) 
 If I closed my eyes, will I see a better life 
 (Gotta be a better place than this) 
 Is there no more pain suffering or strife 
 (I need to know, I need to know) 
 Lord, please see me cry and tell me what's heavens like 
 (What's heaven like) 
 Dear God I wrote you a letter, but I know it's not needed 
 See I'm cool and all, but could you help out all my people (please) 
 There are kids dying and starving, I wish somebody would feed em 
 Nobody playing their part, everybody being greedy 
 I got letters from jail with my homies tears on it (tears on it) 
 Put his last years on it 
 Sometimes I feel haunted 
 Is Heaven a place like I ain't never been 
 And is Heaven a place where we don't ever sin 
 And if there is a Heaven, what answers will find us best 
 So I can tell my auntee with cancer she can finally rest (rest in peace) 
 Through it all I'm just trying to remain bein a soldier 
 ??? 
 I thought I saw you but it was night time 
 I don't know if I was woke or dreamin' or was I in my right mind 
 I wonder how many people have questions like mine 
 Is Heaven for everybody and all of my people 
 And everybody who left us on earth so we get finally meet em. 
 I just wanna know why, I be missin' my block 
 And I wonder what happened to people like Biggie and Pac. 
 'Cause if there is a Heaven, I'm sure everbody wanna know. 
 And if there is a place like this, I'm sure everyone wanna go. 
 I'm tired of struglin and husslin not knowing where to go... 
 I'm tired of struglin and husslin not knowing what for... 
 'Cause see this life will get you fed up (fed up) 
 Picture me telling my mom and dad to keep their head up 
 Telling them it's gonna be all right, when I knowing it's not 
 Telling my homie he's gonna be all right, when I knowing he's shot 
 I wonder what he saw before he died that would leave him shook 
 And should I believe everything I read in books 
 God, just gimme some time 
 If not, gimme a sign (lemme know) 
 What's Heaven like 
 There's so many question I wanna ask 
 But one day ain't enough (for real) 
 I just wanna help my people out man 
 Money ain't about nothing 
 I just want y'all to know how I feel 
 (Chorus (repeat 3x))
