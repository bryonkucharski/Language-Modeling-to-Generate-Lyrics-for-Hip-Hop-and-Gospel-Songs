(Silkk da Shocker) 
 Yo Mya 
 I know you got a man and all 
 But uh I been watchin y'all 
 And if he ain't treatin you right 
 'Bout time you move on 
 Now I'm not trying to get in between y'all two, 
 But you gonna move, move this way 
 (Mya - Verse 1) 
 I'm so confused 
 I don't know what to do (gonna be aiight, gonna be aiight) 
 But I gotta be a woman 
 I gotta get over you (yeah aiight, yeah aiight) 
 I think I saw your baby's mother 
 Creeping at your back door (Yeah-ee Yeah-ee) 
 And your lying ass been cheatin' 
 And I can't take it no more oh oh 
 I'm movin on (move on) 
 On 
 (Movin on) (and move my way) 
 On 
 (Movin on-on) (move on) 
 Oh-on 
 I'll be movin on (and move my way, say what say what) 
 (2x's) 
 (Mya - Verse 2) 
 Whose drawers are these 
 You know I wear a size four (huh what, say what) 
 And if you say that you've been faithful 
 Who was at your back door 
 You ain't got no money (it don't matter about all that, I got some) 
 I should've left you long ago (Yeah-ee Yeah-ee Yeah-ee) 
 And you stroke ain't strokin no more 
 So I've been sleepin' all alone 
 (She shouldn't have to sleep by herself you know what I sayin') 
 If you know what I mean 
 I'm movin on (move on) 
 Chorus (2x's) 
 (Silkk) 
 Well now I'm a No Limit Soldier 
 Known to keep it rowdy 
 You know one's that make you say uh 
 And Bout It, Bout It 
 Now one to the two 
 Two to the three 
 I ain't sayin' leave him 
 But you need to like roll wit me 
 'Cause I can see you ain't happy here 
 When I look in your eye 
 You a bird 
 You gotta spread your wings 
 So now it's time to fly 
 You ain't never gotta trip 
 Or remind me 
 I'm trying to live ghetto fab 
 Like takin' baths 
 In bottles of Don P 
 But I ain't perfect 
 Just imagine me with no flaws 
 Like a parking lot 
 Wit no cars 
 Cell block 
 Wit no bars 
 World wit no wars 
 L.A.wit no stars 
 Check this out 
 I can heal your broken heart 
 So don't be so fast 
 To react so quick 
 Or get all mad 
 And try to scratch up my 6 
 Now you know I get paid 
 For bustin' all kind of tight verses 
 See I need a girl 
 That I can see on top 
 Like Silkk and Mya 
 Or vice versa 
 Chorus (w/o I'll be movin on)
