 Haha 
 Ungh! Once a-muthafuckin-gain, me an my nigga Silkk 
 We gon' show y'all how we mobb 
 No Limit for life, how we do this shit 
 West Coast style nigga, from down South, to the muthafuckin hills 
 Y'all niggas better recognize, y'all better fuckin' recognize 
 (Master P) 
 I'm tru to da game, Masta P'll be da name 
 I'm in it for the money, fuck these bitches an the fame 
 'Cause when you broke bitches get ghost like sideways, 
 Like gold daytons rollin' up the highway 
 On my way to the town to take some cizash, 
 An if you shizort bitch you in the bizag 
 I got fifteen in the tank, on my way to Burbank 
 Fist stealin 5, ready till 5, blowin' dank 
 An still tryin' to make a dollar outta fifteen cents 
 Got the Cutlass full of coffee for no evidence 
 It's a drought but I got ice cream 16 five, everyday, all day 
 Hit me on the door knob 
 'Cause we be ballin, bitch we be haulin, 
 Got chickens up the highway from New Orleans 
 An y'all foo's can't stop the real deal, 
 An when you see the Tank fool you better guard yo' grill 
 'Cause No Limit in this to win this, 
 An got a million soldiers ready to handle business 
 6 deep is how we mobb, an we tru (Ungh!) 
 But we'll kill if we have to 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Been on the block in the Bay, nigga hop by the tre 
 Nigga stop at eight, early chop the cake, but not today 
 Cock the K, 'cause these busta ass niggas know we not to play 
 Say hello to the Richmond nigga, East Bay killa 
 Down South thrilla, quick to fill ya, wit more shells than the sea 
 More mail than the post office, 
 These lyrics an dope keep me stayin up like it was coffee 
 Now stop, pause, take a look 
 East Bay nigga crook, seven E deuce cut 
 Ready to buck on any nigga that steps up 
 I be the man, understand this, skanless niggas get fucked up 
 Number one on Billboard, bitch, y'all niggas still tryin' to come up 
 Y'all niggas soup, I'm gumbo, ready to rumble, ready to tumble 
 Yo' girlfriend outta line, I'ma catch her like Columbo 
 Tongue twistin like an Uzi, y'all niggas can't do me 
 (Boo-yah, bad man) 
 Y'all watch too many fuckin' movies
