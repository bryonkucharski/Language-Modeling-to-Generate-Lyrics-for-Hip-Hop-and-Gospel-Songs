(Featuring Mystikal, Silkk) 
 Nigga, and we don't give a fuck 
 If you don't give a fuck 
 Then we don't give a fuck 
 If you don't give a fuck 
 Then we don't give a fuck 
 You got a problem with us 
 We'll shoot this bitch up 
 (Big Ed, Silk) 
 My entourage be some souldiers 
 Fool I thought I told ya 
 Nigga we bust at the rollers 
 And knock your head up off your shoulders 
 Cause you don't want to see us 
 'Cause if you do 
 Glock cocked with ski masks nigga 
 A bunch of killers with tattoos 
 (Silk) 
 Ah atten hut 
 About face to his head 
 Nigga in charge 
 Label full of killas and drug dealas 
 Convicted thug niggas and tank doggs 
 How you like me now bitch 
 Got to run it with a whole gang of hard hittas 
 Y'all have to check us or respect us like 
 Motherfuckin guard sentence 
 Better duck when I bust you 
 Ya killed numb 
 I'm in a rush so don't touch me 
 Sayin' fuck y'all feel it 
 Blowin' out the past though 
 But I be playin' you assholes 
 Startin wars like Castro 
 Enemies casket close ask my foes 
 Look knock 'em down like back door to the end 
 Like I'm ten fold 
 Never go to war with us niggas 
 Unless you can last hoe 
 Look I stay muggin therefore I stay thuggin' 
 Look fuck who you with I lose you bitch 
 You mean nothing to me like my fuckin' play cousins 
 Now we heartless sleep in the dark 
 Cause you don't want to start shit 
 Told you I'm a soldier bitch 
 I come to get you if I'm mobile like I was cordless 
 Like a phone let it be known 
 I'm from the land of the trigga slangers 
 Nigga bangers 
 That's why in the morning 
 I sign nothing with my trigga finger 
 So don't test me 
 (Big Ed) 
 Now if you see me 
 Ski mask glock cocked 
 17 shots hit your whole block 
 Oh you're not when your ladies panties drop at the hotel spot 
 Lock now load tank doggs explode 
 See the whites of their eyes unload 
 For the automatics empty magazines, then reload 
 Nigga what, nigga wet who them bustas be with 
 I got a 120 round clip for situations like this 
 I'm makin' gangstas move wearin gangsta shoes 
 My entourage is 'bout it 'bout it makin' gangstas groove 
 Silkk the shock what's that on your stomach 
 (Silk) That's my TRU tattoo 
 Well I'll be god damned nigga 
 'Cause I got that on my stomach too 
 No Limit Soldier, military steppin 
 Cock back your weapons 
 Glocks, Hechler Kochs, Sig Sauers, Rugers, and Smith and Wessons 
 Big Ed be the captain of this army who pops 
 Me and another killer fuse here 
 So you really didn't harm me 
 Murderous onslaught, my entourage keeps blastin 
 Nigga the only way you can see me is inside the outcome 
 Assassin 
 (Mystikal) 
 Fool if I aimin at your motherfuckin head 
 Bitch I ain't gonna miss you but your people gonna miss ya 
 My heart colder than the air conditioner 
 They breakin and duckin and dodgin to get out the way 
 From the fuck of my picture 
 It just a ridiculous 
 I'm prove it to you 
 If it's cool, then it's cool 
 If I say move, then you better move 
 I done told you we No Limit Soldiers we ballers we on a mission 
 Now can't nobody hold us we outta control on you bitches 
 That's what we remainin 
 Maintainin, y'all ain't hangin' 
 From what we brangin 
 We put that jock in the knock and it's bangin' and sangin 
 I know what you thinkin' 
 But before you can do you screamin Don't shoot 
 That's your ass options are limited 
 Now whatcha gon do 
 If you're a bitch, you gon cry like a pissy baby 
 If you're on your shit, get your skinny let 'em fry like bacon 
 If you're scared, say you're scared (I'm scared) 
 Then know I'm breakin your neck and breakin that leg 
 As soon as I put this shit down for Big Ed 
 This entourages is vicious that's my dog 
 That's my niggas, that's my fuckin' cool edition
