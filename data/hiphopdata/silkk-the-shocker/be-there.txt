Sup Ma, I-I know I ain't really been there for you and shit like I was supposed to be, but, I'm ready to make that change, you know I was like runnin' tha streets for my niggaz and shit not makin' no time for you, you the only one who really had a nigga back, but, uh-huh, (I always, I love you), yeah, I know you do... 
 I know you care for me, I know you really do care for me 
 'Cause through thick and thin, you always was there for me 
 I know you care for me, I know you care for me 
 Through thick and thin, you always was there for me 
 (Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you) 
 I know sometimes you get sick of me sayin' "sorry" 
 But this time I really mean it, maybe I took it too far 
 I know, some things I did was cold 
 When you called, my boys called, I just put you on hold 
 And my fault, I thought I'd just tell you that 
 I know I'm wrong, I've put you through Hell and back 
 But look, I'm back from Hell tryin' to take you to Heaven 
 I know I fucked up in tha past, I'm tryin' to make shit better 
 And, you never stressed when I went out 
 You just stood through the hard times and just blessed me when I went out 
 You leavin' me, wasn't part of my plan 
 I don't want you leavin', but if you decided to, I'd understand 
 'Cause you was there through tha rain and tha sunny days 
 Stood by me when most chicks would run away 
 That's why you get respect when you're around my crew 
 One day I'ma change, I just hope that you're around when I do (yes) 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you 
 To be there for me 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you 
 Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you 
 I need a chick if I get locked up, she'd come visit 
 If I ain't got a ride, then she'd come get me 
 I need a chick who'd hold me down if I gotta do a year flat 
 Her girls tell her "move on" but she ain't tryin' to hear that 
 She with me just for me 
 Not that I could have her seein' jewels like she worked at Tiffany's 
 Not that I could get her everything she wish she had 
 Spend nights on tha yacht, spend days on Fifth Ave. 
 Or that I could turn her Winter's into Summer 
 Show her accounts that look like telephone numbers 
 'Cause, if you tha one, they gon' know you tha one 
 It's really nothing we ain't gonna be able to do for fun 
 Beverly Hillbillies, country like tha Clampett's 
 Put you in a neighborhood, tha south version of tha Hampton's 
 Um, some are about this, no doubt it's strange 
 And what's your last name, it's not mine, that's why we change it, I got you 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you 
 To be there for me 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you 
 To be there for me 
 Sometimes she like to fight and she likes to fuss 
 'Cause she likes what happens after we make up 
 Shit, she wake up to a kiss 
 And if I get her real mad, she wake up to a gift 
 And, she don't do much, sometimes she might pout 
 At tha most she'll slam a couple of doors in tha house 
 But then it's back to whatever 
 That's tha way to get attention, not to mention make tha love much better 
 And, she's secure so when I look 
 And tha only time we go out to eat is after I cook 
 'Cause sometimes she be buggin' 
 Hard for her to trust me, 'cause she heard about all tha days I was thuggin' 
 But now she know that it ain't nothin' but gossip 
 You know they jealous, you could tell how they watch us 
 And ma, all they tryin' to do is stop us 
 But you ain't gotta trip no more, if you need me, I got ya 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you, baby, I need you 
 To be there for me 
 Baby, I love you, baby, I want you 
 Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you 
 Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you
