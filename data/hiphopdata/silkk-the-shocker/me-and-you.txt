Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "Me And You" 
 (Feat. Master P) 
 (Master P- (mumbling)) 
 (Silkk) 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh 
 Me and you together had plans on making the day, having cash 
 As time passed tryin' to make it all last 
 You know we struggle 
 Hope we can see better days 
 And the time different dreamers is to go our separate ways 
 (Verse 1 - Silkk) 
 See you was always good 
 I was always bad 
 You was always in school 
 I was always to cuttin' class 
 Cheatin' on my tests knowin' I wouldn't pass 
 Told me slow down nigga I was movin' too fast 
 They always told me? 
 I wish you well one day 
 If you could be spent up, shot at, get me out of jail some day 
 Yah, I was told to be like you 
 And at times I tried 
 Realized the only way I can beat these streets 
 The only way I knew to survive 
 I remember comin' home high and drunk 
 Smellin' just like a alcoholic 
 Tryin' to sneak you in 
 They damn near caught us 
 We be down to rock the block party's all night 
 Even thought we clown, we be down to fight, all night 
 Hangin' with the big homies 
 Askin' what they hittin' fo' 
 I remember stealin' junk food out the neighborhood liquor sto' 
 Sittin' back remeniscin' on all the things we had 
 Even thought it was rough, it never seemed so bad 
 Our destiny, we can't shape 
 I know we made mistakes 
 Even thought I wonder why He took you 
 I can't question fate 
 I guess it was written 
 (Master P) 
 But check it out 
 You still hear 'cause you gon' live through me, C, and Silkk 
 (Chorus: Silkk) 
 Me and you I always thought we'd be together 
 I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever 
 And see I, destiny, we can't shape it 
 Even thought I wonder why we die 
 I can't question fate 
 Me and you I always thought we'd be together 
 I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever 
 And somehow I always thought you'd be there 
 Get a deg on the mark, it's cold, but it's fair 
 (Verse 2 - Silkk) 
 See man, right now I just gotta watch my step 
 No matter how many homies I lose 
 I can't get used to death 
 I remember us 5, runnin' wild 
 Just tryin' to get paid 
 It wouldn't seem like a jail 
 Put some rose on Dante's grave 
 (No reason you gon' die) 
 Gimme for thinkin' that 
 You were my brother 
 I'd pay millions to know I was safe 
 A million to bring ya back 
 Y'all my family, as well as my friends 
 And if I had to bring ya back that mean I havta lose ya again 
 Your memory's gonna live on even though ya' gon' 
 I'm sittin' hear contemplating where it all went wrong 
 We had an argument, I said some things I shouldn'ta said 
 Never got a chance to apologize when you didn't come home that day 
 I'm thinkin' about memories every time I lay down 
 I wish I woulda known 
 I woulda apologized 
 But I guess I gotta say it now 
 So I see you when I get there 
 But for now I'ma pour out liquor 
 Till I'm up there wishin' 
 (Silkk) 
 And if this song don't hit home 
 Picture the person you love the most 
 And, you wake up, they be gone 
 (Master P) 
 Damn, Kevin Miller 
 See you when I get there fool 
 Till then you gon' live on through us 
 Huh, we riders baby, you know that 
 Down to handle our business 
 Silkk can handle his business 
 We 'bout it 'bout it, rowdy rowdy 
 Love nigga
