Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "Mama Always Told Me" 
 (Feat. C-Murder, Eightball, Master P) 
 Mama always told me (told me) 
 But papa never showed me (showed me) 
 So I live the life of a thug 
 And all I wanna do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs 
 Mama always told me it'd happen 
 But she never told me when 
 She said probably happen when I get much older 
 But I kinda wish it would of happened then 
 'Cause I had my mind on gettin' some money 
 Nigga I'm tryin' get rich 
 Mom told me never trust these niggas 
 And ummm never put your faith in the bitch 
 See I hang with a bunch of grave yard villians 
 Nigga robbin' sprees we stealin' 
 Choppin' keys with drug dealers 
 Click like pistol with killers 
 They tried to preech to me, couldn't preech to me 
 Tried to teach me, couldn't teach me 
 See I've gotta learn the hard way on my own 
 'Cause nobody else could give me a reason 
 They always told me I'll probably end up dead 
 Or in the pen see me and P some outcasts 
 Can't arrest the family tellin' the kids not to be like him 
 And see it was ruff some times but it had to be 
 Enough trippin' on Cess go hand your back and pass the weed 
 I ran wild deep in the game off of change 
 Nigga bitch won't fuck 'em nigga won't kill me 
 But it's all in the game 
 See pop was too busy doin' his own thing to try to show me 
 But mom told me Silkk watch your paper 
 At the top it gets lonely, mama told me 
 Mama always told me (told me) 
 But papa never showed me (showed me) 
 So I live the life of a thug 
 And all I wanna do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs 
 Token guns on my side, no limit niggas gone ride 
 Paper chasin' for millions Tru niggas won't die 
 Make time for some dope nigga fuck bein' broke 
 I live my life on the ropes nigga fuck the P.O. 
 I leave you dead with the bustas 
 Real niggas gone love us 
 We make crack with the killers and sell dope to the country 
 Nigga, nigga outlaws and dealers tattoo and killers 
 Niggas 'bout it with millions now the world gone feel this 
 I'm staying TRU to the game you bitches callin' my name 
 Mama told me to change its ghetto blood in my vein 
 See I got love for thugs never mix sex with drugs 
 My enemy in blood when I come bury me a thug 
 Henessy and weed be a ball with desert 
 These shirts and kakis is how we work 
 Hypnotized by change after fortune and fame 
 I roll 20's and thangs rolex and change but uh... 
 Mama always told me (told me) 
 But papa never showed me (showed me) 
 So I live the life of a thug 
 And all I wanna do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs 
 Right from the edge killer nigga gone off coke 
 Brown sticky dope makin' niggas turn on their folks 
 Ain't now rules, fools rush in but don't come out 
 So many niggas round my way die runnin' their mouth 
 Fairy tales are for children we ain't story book livin' 
 South streets be bloody from all the shootin' and killin' 
 Villians ride for similac and crack and smack 
 And it's a fact all killers ain't inner city blacks 
 My homies have to serve on blocks that's hot with cops 
 With rocks and stacks and be packed to get their scraps 
 I don't knock it 'cause if my pocket starts to lose weight 
 You can find me on I-10 tryin' move weight 
 My mama on her knees prayin' givin' god her time 
 While I'm on the streets hustlin' tryin' gettin' what's mine 
 Am I wrong am I right got can only determine 
 I can only live my life and life is for learnin' check it 
 Mama always told me (told me) 
 But papa never showed me (showed me) 
 So I live the life of a thug 
 And all I wanna do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs
