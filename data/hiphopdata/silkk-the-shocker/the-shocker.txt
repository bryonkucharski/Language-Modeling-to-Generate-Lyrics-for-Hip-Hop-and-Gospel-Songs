 Niggas gonna lay back, flat 
 'Cause I ain't the nigga ta fuck with 
 So you niggas need tah step the fuck off 
 Before I leave y'all niggas in a bag 
 Talkin' that trash, you get hauled off in a black truck 
 Nigga back up, stacks up 
 When I blast I'm never gonna miss 
 Nigga hollow tips in yo' shit

 Strapped with a infrared pump

 And now all her girls have been fuckin' light 
 (Master P) 
 What's yo' name homie? (SILKK)

 (Master P) 
 It's time to flip a script 
 And turn a half into a million 
 And turn a hoe 
 Into a zillion 
 My game be tight like the bulls 
 And after my shows there ain't NO LIMIT to the hoes I can pull 
 Girls be sweatin' me like I'm'a bandana 
 My lyrics so gangsta the police keep them on the radar scanner 
 But I be tight like the Titanic 
 While y'all suckas sellin' wammys 
 We on our way to the Grammys 
 3rd ward brothers that came up 
 Keep my name out yo' mouth 
 Like Messy Marvin I'm gonna wipe you up 
 And yo' game better be tight 
 'Cause ain't no luv where I'm from from morning to night 
 Fools be 'bout it they be rowdy 
 Still puttin' money in the bank like Uncle Sam 
 And taxin' fools, dead 
 All y'all suckas on the block are tryna stop me 
 Can't fade me 
 And me and Silkk be livin' large 
 Sippin' on mo wet but strapped with the plastic toys 
 Down South we be hustlin' 
 Settin' the line behind bustas that we ain't trustin 
 Y'all better wake up and smell the aroma 
 'Cause we doin' this from Down South to California 
 (Master P) 
 The Shocker, haha 
 Ain't nothin' change with No Limit 
 Straight up Ice Cream 
 We got some mo ice cream fo' y'all
