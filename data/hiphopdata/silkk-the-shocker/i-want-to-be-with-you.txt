 'Cause you know I have 2 tickets to the game and I wanted to see did you want 
 To go)

 (Silkk/(Female 2))

 (Naw Naw forget it just stay where you at and when 
 You do decide 2 come home bring me a ring or something) 
 I might change this bullshit man bye man 
 (O'Dell) 
 Girl I think I wanna be with you 
 But it's something that I just can't do 
 I wanna be faithful 
 See that's just me what I'm going through 
 I know I ought to be with you 
 Know I need you but I can't keep you 
 I got to maintain my cool 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 Can't keep you 
 (Silkk The Shocker) 
 Yo Yo Yo I never was the type to stress 
 Get It off my chest 
 Y'all can deal 
 If y'all was real 
 Y'all can fill in the rest 
 We both say yes 
 Guess we were both like phony 
 Jumped in too quick 
 Ideally 'cause we both was lonely 
 We go 2 stores and you never peek at the price 
 Treat you right had a bad day I just greet you with ice 
 You know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers 
 Wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings 
 I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad 
 Some was good 
 Matter fact it was all that' 
 Sometimes I feel like we just didn't match 
 Found a friend 
 But only friend till then you alwayz came first 
 Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work 
 What What 
 (Silkk The Shocker) 
 I wanna be with you but I can't hope you understand and all 
 Tried to make this thang work 
 Got knocked you'll be the first person I call 
 Now with you can be myself 
 With her it's like I'm living a lie 
 I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied 
 If I give her 3 karats then she probably want four 
 If I wanna go places then she probably just don't wanna go 
 Now sometimes I feel like we settled 
 In the back of our minds 
 We all feel like we can find something better 
 Now with you it' like you know me 
 Like her she really don't understand me 
 I know I live the way I live 
 But she's all for changing me 
 I don't care for girl with no money 
 When I come home I ain't tryin' to cuss 
 Am I asking for much? 
 But I can't sit here and pretend 
 I don't care 
 To have both y'all along 
 That wouldn't be fair 
 So if it's a puzzle 
 I think I maybe just missing a clue 
 Leave or Stay? 
 God tell me what's a nigga to do 
 What What What 
 Chorus till fade
