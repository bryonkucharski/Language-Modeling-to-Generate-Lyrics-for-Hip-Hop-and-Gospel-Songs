Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "You Ain't Gotta Lie To Kick It" 
 (Feat. Big Ed, Mia X) 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it to be with me, 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, what's it gonna be, it's gonna be you 
 Ain't gotta lie to me (2X) 
 (Silkk) 
 Now you ain't gotta lie to me, or try to be somethin' you ain't, well 
 Obviously, you tryin' to be me, but you can't, niggas wanna be local, 'cause 
 Some regional stars, type of nigga that got a little somethin', but guess 
 What nigga lease on his car, watch out for these bustas, or should I say 
 Fake phonies, type of nigga that buy a Timex, put a Rolex face on it, I 
 See niggas be talkin' to me, but I can't do nothin' bout what he's sayin', 
 Type of nigga don't get a beep all day but act a fool when uh he 
 Finally get page, nigga walk around stuntin, on a cellular phone, when I 
 Ask to use it why the battery low, 'cause it's always on roam, now see 
 This, or should I say peep this, type of nigga that get a Benz wanna 
 Change the sign from a 3 to a 6, now ain't that funny, or should I say 
 Ain't that nothin', shit where the hummer, where the money, shit where 
 The 600, type of nigga that buy dope for shit, an sell it cheaper then 
 What he got it, wanna admit everbody in the story an everybody he be 
 Knowin', where the mills at, where the house on the hill at, nigga kill 
 That, on the real black shit where the record deal 
 At, shit lookin' like you stole somethin', shit you owe somethin', look 
 Everytime I see you talkin' bout Silkk let me hold somethin', see don't 
 Compare shit how I spit, but guess what if the shoe fit, go ahead, 'cause 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it. (That's real bitch) 
 (Mia X) 
 See I saw clean through that ass since day one uno, the main bitch to 
 Flaunt show, but ain't got pocket piss an no window, to throw it out, to 
 Talk about this one an that one, pinnochio sister let me paint a clearer 
 Picture, she once went around sayin' she was engaged, she even had a lil 
 Ring, said her nigga did his thang, come to find out she traded her 
 Necklace an paid the difference, then gave your boy credit knowin' she 
 Struggles tryin' to get it, sports fake designer bags, brags on her 
 Clothin price tags, sayin' she got 'em from her man, but bitch credit card 
 Scams, got a Lexus key chain, on her cabinet car key, talkin' bout she 
 Had a 420, bitch you tryin' to be me, tellin' everybody how nice her crib 
 Is, but every week she split out then back at her hoes house, I can't 
 Stand this type of bitch cussin off nothin' why try, we can never kick it 
 Or be down but you still ain't gotta lie. 
 (Big Ed) 
 Now you say you got hoes, yeah there be holes in yo socks, you say you 
 Got dollas, but 10 ones make you not, wit the hundred on top, these 
 Bustas gotta stop, you said you bowl for bricks to dime rocks an 
 Payrolls got judgement on cops, where you 93 Benz, man this is a shock, 
 First it was a four door big body now it's a 2 door drop top, tell the 
 Truth bro, did you eat that strip of ???, nah, havin' dinner in bed, tie 
 You up an pop it in yo mouth, say you get the down an, have 'em yellin' an 
 Screamin but you told my tank dawg nigga that you was straight on the 
 Drownin, bout to be down ass nigga, I mean clown ass nigga, wanna hang 
 Wit down ass niggas wit big nuts, an big triggas, figga, how many 
 Rappers, frontin in this hip-hop game, straight up by sections playin' it 
 Straight like it ain't no thang, (word) my claim to fame, is Big Ed be 
 Puttin' it down like that, messin wit the hoe games on the realer, 
 Assasin said. 
 (Silkk) 
 Niggas be flossin, if you see these niggas around yo block, or you see 
 These bitches around yo block, actin' like they have all this, tell em 
 What they lyin' for, I don't see none of it, I see you talkin' 'bout you 
 Got all these cars but why you catchin the bus? You have all this money, 
 Why you askin me for money?
