 In a situation about makin' my green 
 First impression nigga back down

 Style funkin than a big pot of chitilins in yo kitchen 
 Some slang in yo shit ain't hittin

 Rough lines and hard rhymes 
 Consider me an asset 
 Slow down 'cause I got some more rhyme ambush ya ass set 
 Nigga that's how it is and I'ma make sure it stay that way 
 I did what they thought that I wasn't gonna do 
 And said what they thought that I wasn't gonna say

 Cause you can smell it 
 To a buckshot from a pellet 
 Here I Go!

 Spray you bitches like apes

 Put a crack in yo exo-skeletan 
 Shake this bitch like a bowl of gelatin 
 We soldiers no limit soldiers ugh there ain't no limit 
 Acceptin you can deliver title material 
 Somethin' got your mind all blocked up 
 I be sexually exited when I'm writin

 Creative bails been unclogged up 
 I keep my elbow in your back 
 To keep yo ass cocked up 
 Ain't no fuckin' wit me 
 Ain't no fuckin' wit shit I did 
 26 and been through it

 To make your girlfriend love me 
 Hunt me like playin' rugby 
 Been a star since smokin' puffies 
 And 
 I'm that type of nigga that come through this bitch 
 Now I stay down like it ain't nothin' 
 My position is a matter of graphs 
 My title is not for uppin 
 Seem like I can take a little bit more that what you put out to harm me 
 Gotta continue to line my style to take 
 Formin a fort (You really will) 
 I writes 'em line for line 
 Take my time till the shit is all tight 
 Focusing mind 
 For most definitive could take all night 
 All right 
 Fuckin' right 
 Unlike nobody else 
 I'm a one man show 
 Like havin' sex with yourself

 Mix mastered and marked
