Yo! 
 Its your boy! 
 Daddy Yankee! 
 All my Latinos stand up! 
 Marcando la historia 
 Caminen comigo en esta! 
 Holla back.  You know how we do man! 
 (Chorus) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 (Verse 1) 
 Straight up, you's a bad ass, baby you hot 
 In the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block 
 Thats the reason you mujers got me, believe it or not 
 Me and you can run the world like Biggie and Pac 
 Cause you my main homie, my main shorty 
 Cock back hammers and bang homie, protecting our gauge slowly 
 With a girl like you, forget the nonsense 
 We'll be the most talked about like the chicos and gossip 
 Dime! 
 (Daddy Yankee is shining right now) 
 Come on cop me now, I got this game locked down 
 What you know about big things, strong wheels, strong bills 
 Me and you holding it down, its so real 
 Come On! 
 (Chorus) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 (Verse 2) 
 Yo!  La negra tiene tumbao 
 Cuando camina de'lao 
 Por la calle ocho sin miedo we be wildin out 
 Switching lanes on the freeway, corriendo por miles 
 A little four play like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen 
 Touching you is not a felony 
 How am I a playa, ma? 
 Do I look like Bill Bellamy? 
 No te molestes yo soy tuyo na' mas 
 I'm not a player, I just crush a lot 
 Tu eres la chica ideal para mi (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Como tu nadie nadie me a hecho sentir (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 O! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you) 
 O! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you) 
 O! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you) 
 O! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you) 
 (Chorus) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you) 
 It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you) 
 Yeah! 
 All my Latinos stand up! 
 Caminen conmigo! 
 On the floor bussing 
 Daddy Yankee!  Barrio Fino! 
 And I'm proud to be Latin man. 
 Letting you know this is real.
