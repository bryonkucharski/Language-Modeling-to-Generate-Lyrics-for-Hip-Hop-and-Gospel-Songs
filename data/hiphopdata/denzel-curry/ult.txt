This is the wrath of Aquarius 
 I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison 
 Humanitarian, bitch I'm a veteran 
 Better than anyone comprehend 
 Snake in the grass, Cut the copperhead 
 Hollow-tips point at a copper head 
 Drop a head Popping the Glock till the copper dead 
 But Bishop killed Radames 
 That is the biggest hypocrisy 
 I don't see nobody stopping me 
 Boy, your whole life is a mockery 
 A militant mind of the million 
 Civilian, I am the realest bitch 
 No Gilligan put me on an island 
 Smoking on an island till a nigga look Thailand 
 Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus 
 Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers 
 Federation in your area 
 If I'm a bitch then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier (WOOF) 
 Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper 
 Dominating common denominator 
 Aftermath you can just do the math later, as a teenager 
 I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player 
 Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion 
 Satisfaction with the lack of compassion 
 It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually 
 I am that nigga entirely 
 The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga 
 In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist 
 When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist 
 When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Mystical miracle, I build imperial, I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be 
 Off to the clinical, now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical 
 Serve, fuck the cops they the opposition and these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes wanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show 
 But be the main ones that be hating on the low 
 Wait, that's just irrelevant, they got the fact when you look at my melanin, whoa 
 'Cause killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other, Don't know, where the fuck they came from 
 We the ones that paid dues 
 I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly 
 Find a little white girl, but let you die 
 Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist 
 Better get caught with it than without it if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I 
 Put them on paper, send them to prison and give them free labor 
 Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors 
 Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later 
 Fuck all my haters 
 I raise up black fists as black as the raiders 
 Arming the gators 
 Federation is my organization 
 All relation, no religion, no races 
 Black to Asian we the nation of U.L.T 
 True to you so keep it true to me 
 Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga 
 In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist 
 When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist 
 When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear) 
 Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Polar Bear)
