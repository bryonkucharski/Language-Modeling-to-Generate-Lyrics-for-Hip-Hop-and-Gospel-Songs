Moving up like escalators 
 I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater 
 Free bands cash flow 
 Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall 
 In my Wonderland, I'm back on my Alice 
 Back in my palace, I'm fly like Aladdin 
 Serving my fans all my dope, 'cause they addicts 
 Haters mad 'cause I'm on top like an attic 
 And if it's beef then we're shooting sporadic 
 Game is like Disney, my words are like magic 
 I like Black Beatles, but act like Black Sabbath 
 I smoke the O-Z when shit gets erratic 
 You see my future, but you cannot have it 
 I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit 
 Balance my chi so I could tame the savage 
 Getting so throwed till my thoughts are in fragments 
 Moving up like escalators 
 I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater 
 Free bands cash flow 
 Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall 
 Moving up like escalators 
 I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater 
 Free bands cash flow 
 Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall 
 Life is so golden that's how I'm living 
 Look at my trunk jumping out like it ribbit 
 Devil gon' hate, blurring my vision 
 That's me at my lowest, no Peter Griffin 
 Young, black and gifted, I'm bout to get lifted 
 Now all my troubles and problems have shifted 
 After my fifth hit it seems I'll be drifting 
 I'm never slipping, I'm forever pimping 
 You see my future, but you cannot have it 
 I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit 
 Balance my chi now, I'm feeling fantastic 
 Getting so throwed till my thoughts are in fragments 
 Moving up like escalators 
 I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater 
 Free bands cash flow 
 Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall 
 Moving up like escalators 
 I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater 
 Free bands cash flow 
 Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall 
 Cash maniac, cash maniac, cash maniac 
 Babe, I'm on a roll 
 'Cause I like to run it 
 Summer doesn't linger 
 Babe, I'm on a roll 
 'Cause I like to run it 
 Summer doesn't linger 
 Ooh
