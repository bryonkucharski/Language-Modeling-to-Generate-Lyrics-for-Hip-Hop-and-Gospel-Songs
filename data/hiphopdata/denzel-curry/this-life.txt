Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I've changed 
 Not the same since my younger days, so far I came 
 Feel my pain till; I can't complain, 'cause I'ma slide for a minute 
 Till I rise in the business, make a billion show my niggas what up 
 In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95 
 I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie? 
 I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die? 
 You down, then would you ride for me? 
 Beause this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me 
 You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me 
 And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me 
 She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me 
 Like, she a sign to me, but you are designed for me 
 And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me 
 And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me? 
 And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me? 
 I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be 
 But luckily, we (?) 
 1 
 That's the end of my cover leaf, wouldn't care if you know it's me 
 Keep away until you notice me 
 Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I've changed 
 Not the same since my younger days, so far I came 
 Feel my pain till I can't complain, 'cause I'ma slide for a minute 
 Till I rise in the business, make a billion show my niggas what up 
 In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95 
 I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie? 
 I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die? 
 Are you down, then would you ride for me? 
 Beause this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me 
 You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me 
 And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me 
 She not my main bitch, ima tell you she's a side to me 
 She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me 
 L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week 
 Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet 
 But silly me, now we are the same, (?) 
 Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine 
 You were a part of me, part of me, parts of me died 
 Idolized you when (?) unite 
 You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now 
 You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I've changed 
 Not the same since my younger days, so far I came 
 Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause Imma slide for a minute 
 Till I rise in the business, make a billion show my niggas what up 
 In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95 
 I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie 
 I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die 
 You down, then would you ride for me? 
 Beause this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me 
 You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
