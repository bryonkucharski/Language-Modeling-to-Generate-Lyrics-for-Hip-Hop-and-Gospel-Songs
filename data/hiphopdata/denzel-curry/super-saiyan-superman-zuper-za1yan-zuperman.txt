Super Saiyan, yuh 
 Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh 
 You the man, nah 
 Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh 
 Ricky Tan, uh, I'ma catch flight like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh 
 Nigga playin', uh 
 Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh 
 Little bitch ride, I don't fuck with anyone that kill my vibe, uh 
 If she slide then she better be clean like Tide, uh 
 Laundry, detergent 
 I'ma get up in that body like a surgeon 
 Pussy wetter than a damn sea urchin 
 Denzel be a fuckin' legend like urban 
 Legendary shit, you on your secondary shit 
 I'm on my Yes Julz mixed wit' Katy Perry shit 
 White on white, while I'm on this beat 
 Make a masterpiece like Mona Lisa 
 Shout out to the reaper, I drop ether 
 Drop mo' crack than eggs on Easter 
 I don't need a feature, boy you either 
 Leave it to me, but you leave it to beaver 
 Killin' these niggas like shots on the evil 
 I am a god nigga, call me young shiva 
 Look at the testament, better than ever been 
 Makin' an estimate for all my paper, run like a Mexican 
 Servin' the rest of it, buyin' a resident on a new day 
 In a new house with the same girl 
 But she got a new blouse, pussy runnin' to me, but ain't no mouse 
 Curry be on point like a motherfucking joust yuh, yuh 
 Lemme turn into a Super Saiyan real quick 
 Kill shit, kill shit, my navy seal shit 
 Yuh, Super Saiyan, yuh 
 Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh

 Nigga playin', uh 
 Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh
