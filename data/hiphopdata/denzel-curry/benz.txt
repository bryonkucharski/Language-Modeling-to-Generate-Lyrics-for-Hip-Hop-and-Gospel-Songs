I ride down 27 with a mixed bitch 
 Looking like LisaRaye 
 My bitch is in the passenger 
 Like dracula and Carmen Hayes 
 Who blow me like cocaine 
 With a little propane 
 King of the Hill 
 I keep it real 
 She drop that top like Rogaine 
 So slide wit ya boy 
 If you ain't talkin' bout Benz 
 Then I don't wanna ride with ya boy 
 Come over here get high with ya boy 
 Glide with ya boy 
 Side with ya boy 
 I do it how I wanna do it 
 Run that pussy Carl Lewis 
 Now she thinking she my wife 
 Oh my god, are you stupid 
 Talkin' about all I need is love and affection 
 But baby I'm a *dog barks* 
 And I am not the type to mess with 
 I'm cruisin in that Lexus 
 With a chick named Alexis 
 And later in the night 
 She gone earn herself 
 A pearl necklace 
 I'm that nigga countin' figures 
 Bumpin to that 69 
 Your bitch on that ecstasy 
 That??? grind 
 Drinking off of dollar signs 
 She all on the dick 
 And she clappin her thighs 
 Finesse at expense 
 With my face on her breasts 
 And she poppin' that pussy 
 Just like a .45 
 Now, when I recline 
 I'm in my zone 
 Bitch nigga I'm fine 
 Bruh bruh just vibe 
 She done with her twerking 
 Damn she tired 
 Ride, I told ya chick lets slide 
 In order to dive in the passenger 
 A nigga just had to just fuck with her mind 
 Dick and desire in her temple 
 Now she thoughts are caught in her mental 
 Now she wants to ride my beep 
 Like singers ride instrumentals 
 But I bump that little key 
 And she told that girl to bust it 
 Man she do it like a stripper 
 When she lay it down and then touch it 
 So rub it, similar to vapor rub 
 For your chest, make those panties 
 Tsunami, mixed with false Viagra wet 
 Now it's a family reunion 
 When my mini-me is down her neck 
 Rubbin Miagi, a curious killer 
 That nigga that never take kindly to threats 
 Benz Benz 
 Bitch I got a Benz 
 Benz Benz 
 Bitch I got a Benz 
 Benz Benz 
 Bitch I got a Benz 
 And I got them Bands 
 So I'm makin' Ends 
 Bitch I got a Benz 
 Bitch I got a Benz 
 And I got them Bands 
 So I'm making Ends

 And I got them Bands 
 So you know I'm making Ends
