Baby 
 Are you pure enough 
 To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh? 
 Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough? 
 Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us 
 You said you had enough 
 Are you pure enough? 
 To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror 'cause? 
 When you all alone girl are you sure enough? 
 Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us 
 You said you had enough 
 Girl are you sure enough: 
 February sixteenth, is the day I regret my birth 
 Most times I thought about ending when I came into this Earth 
 Compared to Dracula, the man I see in the mirror is nothing reflecting on all of the bitches I got but none of them love me 
 Like the moment I donated my heart too without the surgery 
 Charity, short-term goals is longevity 
 Keeping it G is the key, and I told you that's the cure for us 
 When the tears fall down your eyes you ask yourself 
 Are you pure enough 
 To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh? 
 Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough? 
 Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us 
 You said you had enough 
 Are you pure enough? 
 To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror 'cause? 
 When you all alone girl are you sure enough? 
 Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us 
 You said you had enough 
 Girl are you sure enough: 
 February fourteenth is just the day to repopulate 
 I never have no love south side of the Florida state 
 Love me for who I am, never love me for what I make 
 I travel around the world and yes I drove on the interstate 
 Niggas what though I was fraudulent? 
 Everything is politics 
 When coal turn into diamonds people want to praise and acknowledge it 
 Always quick to polish it 
 But quickly let me go 
 Happened to that young nigga with the nappy afro 
 He died around the same time that Lotto did 
 Now it's 2016 and I know what the motto is and 
 I don't need no Aubrey Graham just to make a hit 
 That's just another view from my iPhone 6 
 Free Mr. Zone 6 
 I know GUWOP is coming home 
 Just another Aquarius that you hate to the bone 
 You wanna be a thug 
 But you won't live in harmony 
 Crazy, I'm crazy I'm wishing that a nigga start with me 
 Last year just made a nigga less friendly 
 Approaching my adversaries 
 I know that people envy 
 My soul is still empty 
 All I see is pussies talking shit with they homeboys 
 That's a modern day Ren and Stimpy 
 Girls wanna be classy but still dress skimpy 
 Not giving a fuck simply 
 Then wonder why people think your an escort 
 Keeping it G is the key and you know that be the cure for us 
 Mirror pieces fall and reflect on your life and ask
