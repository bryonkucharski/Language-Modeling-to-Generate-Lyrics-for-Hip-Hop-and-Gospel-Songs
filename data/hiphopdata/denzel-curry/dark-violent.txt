Fang life 
 You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside 
 You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside 
 Welcome to the land 
 You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside 
 What it's 'bout? 
 It's 'bout a young nigga, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker 
 Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams 
 Settling angry stomachs up in his fam 
 So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate 
 Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven 
 The pimps is the prophets, not prophets for reverends 
 This is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent 
 So here's a lesson of a teen that survived Rikers 
 But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas 
 Touch 
 You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside 
 You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside 
 You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside 
 You ain't have a fucking name on the darkside 
 You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside 
 You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside 
 You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside 
 You ain't have a fucking name on the darkside 
 Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his Nina strap 
 And steadily scheming, barely sleeping, but dreaming of pretty bitches and beamers 
 But when he awake, he sees his fate 
 And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his fucking salary 
 Any niggas a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em 
 Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started 
 When he was, welcomed into our fucked up world, the son of a fucked up girl 
 And his father was just a blur, his life had took a curve 
 When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation 
 Of the gang relation, he was young, a kid, a baby 
 And yet to realize the pollution of the nation 
 Now he 18 life in jail is what he facing 
 Shit, murder was the case that they gave him 
 Shit, murder was the case when they raised him 
 Mind stuck in the all black prison 
 You think he give a fuck about the system? 
 (Car driving) 
 Nigga we gotta get this money 
 Damn right 
 We gotta get this money, I got the plans 
 Everything's set up 
 Just got to go in there 
 Got the banger man, as long as you got the hammer man, we out 
 Go by the book 
 You ready to do this shit or what? 
 Yeah, yeah, 'this what I got to do 
 Out on the gank, rolling the dank 
 As he cased out the bank, he was catching that shank 
 Getting loaded the stick, trying to major his rank 
 Thugging was how he was brought in the paint 
 Rush the security, no longer pure was thee 
 Soul turned it cold for the love of the gold 
 Bust in the air, everyone hit the floor 
 Not giving a fuck, loc-ing off of the 'dro 
 Bodied a nigga, riding in a dropped 'Lac 
 Top back, cruising them twenty fours 
 So I went crazy, my vision got hazy 
 I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold 
 Clutching that pistol grip 
 The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped 
 The bitch, he was twitching, bust at a civilian 
 And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin' 
 Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental 
 Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple 
 That's engraved, leaving corpses 
 In graves, Glock 17 cutting fades 
 Barber, we dumped the security in the harbor 
 Then we switched the identity, chose the name Leroy Carter 
 The bank teller looking short and squeamish 
 Steve pistol-whipped the bitch; she kept screaming 
 Shut up, ho, before a nigga nut up, ho 
 Steve said he couldn't take the shit 
 So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MAC 
 Then he put it to her head, and then he ripped the bitch 
 Boy, we gotta do a job or we might get toast 
 13 shots rung out and it left two ghost 
 Tales from the dark side, jack move, riding 
 Trials and tribulations of the dark and violent
