Yesterday I had a talk with my reverend 
 About how I traded my soul to get a skeleton 
 Of Lucifer, so a nigga can mount it on his wall 
 Hella high, hella high so an angel can never fall 
 Smoking on the mystical chronic from a shaman 
 Disguised as Andre Young with razor blades under the tongue 
 Hopefully his speech impediments might call upon, petchulants 
 So he can rip the wings off Cosmo, and Pegasus 
 Eating Flapjacks with a cannibal Captain K'nuckles 
 Kamakaze, jeepers creepers, read the power, ate his tonsils 
 Threw it up, gave it to an asthmatic 
 Swapping spit with crack addicts, Complex magazine and mathematics 
 Dilated with the ganja and peripherals 
 I look at things as cynical, I put the fun in funeral 
 A misty, mystic, mischievous one 
 Burning papers of the book, Fahrenheit 451 
 Can you see, what I see? 
 Look at life, in 3D. (Widescreen) 
 Can you see, what I see? 
 Look at life, in 3D. (Widescreen) 
 Can you see, what I see? 
 Look at life, in 3D. (Widescreen) 
 Can you see, what I see? 
 Look at life, in 3D. (Widescreen) 
 Trying to achieve the same color as pawn tyler scalp forest 
 I see everything like I'm Horus 
 So watch man, like I'm into Rorschach 
 STD's and bullets, that's what happens when them guns clap 
 Wickedly sticking these bitches, g, I'm Ice Cube Jackson 
 5 fingers of death, I'm packing 
 Something that will make you feel like a paraplegic 
 Paralyzed when folks no habla murder thesis 
 Told based god I'd give him a virgin sacrifice 
 And stepped into a Pantheon and said "Yo, which one you like?" 
 Step to Aphrodite with an amethyst rock 
 Crystal, get it dog? nah that's a Shih Tzu 
 If you don't really get the moral of the song 
 Basically I see crazy shit, when I grip the bong 
 So maybe right now, you know what that means 
 My eyes are dilated, all 3 in HD
