Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well 
 Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell 
 Back in the dark, I'm mysterious 
 Laughing away till I do something serious 
 Attitude only imperious 
 Rest all my enemies like I'm insidious 
 These times I'm feeling so hideous 
 Fuck everybody, I murder you idiots 
 I am a little perfidious 
 Fuck a civilian, we're not equivalent 
 I am a little delirious 
 Suck my balls, stomach, drop balls 
 Islamic flow so dead, sonic 
 I hear that life is a bitch 
 I hear that life is a beast 
 Life is a freak on a leash 
 I got the mark of the beast 
 Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well 
 Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell 
 Tortuously, killin' my infidels effortlessly 
 Want them to be my P-R-O-P-E-D-E-A-D 
 Dead 'em, I do it professionally 
 Assassin's Creed, your majesty 
 Your after is not "happily" 
 Her body in factories while others lean on tragedy 
 I'm that joke, say that's a Periscope, fuck a telescope 
 Careful my angel a higher hope, I desire rope, uh 
 I'm gonna live by my confidence 
 I'm gonna die by my arrogance 
 Heaven and hell is irrelevant 
 I be the black metal terrorist 
 Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well 
 Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel 
 I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell 
 Jackal in a jack mood (Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel) 
 Everything that I say will be taboo (I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well) 
 In a bad mood, but I'm back too (Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel) 
 Everything that I say will be taboo (I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell) 
 I be the black metal terrorist 
 I be the black metal terrorist 
 Send 'em to hell
