Lights out 
 If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears 
 Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers 
 Apparently I will watch the whole world collapse and appear 
 No tears, my intuition tells me that the end is near 
 The only thing I should fear is fear itself 
 Learn that being afraid of God is being afraid of yourself 
 So go to church nigga, but I won't go 'cause I don't know 
 Where all the money and the collection plate go 
 If the church still owe, then you know, read your bible at home 
 I'ma read it myself, all the stories that I'm reading show me how to prevail 
 The guard came in the other day and gave me some mail and said that I got a phone call 
 When I get out we gon' go harder than Medusa, building stone walls out of human flesh 
 Dave Koresh, burn that shit down even though I'm not around 
 I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out 
 If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here 
 If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here 
 So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be? 
 Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see 
 If tomorrow's not here 
 Let's all jump out the window 
 Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked 
 Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close 
 Oh, gotta do a little soul searching 
 Let's all jump out the window 
 Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked 
 Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close 
 Oh, gotta do a little soul searching 
 If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears 
 Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers 
 We, been afraid of something that is out of my control 
 Like a verse from Duckworth make a silly rapper's butt hurt 
 Sodomized through the eyes of a troubled youth 
 Talking between the bars, you tell them within the booth 
 Way back in 2012 when a nigga was 22 
 Passed you the Tropicana now my niggas got the juice 
 For millennias to come, go Millennium Falcon 
 Fuck a hand out, I'd rather leave my hands solo 
 The smartest thing you ever did, Curry, was going solo 
 While I'm in the county blues, lofty bout to take over the promo for the fam 
 I'm here because I never gave a damn, like an angry beaver 
 Smoking dust and reefer 
 Live life, smoke a pound, even though I'm not around 
 I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out 
 If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here 
 If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here 
 So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be? 
 Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see 
 If tomorrow's not here 
 Let's all jump out the window 
 Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked 
 Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close 
 Oh, gotta do a little soul searching 
 Let's all jump out the window 
 Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked 
 Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close 
 Oh, gotta do a little soul searching 
 Yo, I'd like to dedicate this track, to my nigga Ruben Thompson and my nigga Darnell Butler 
 ULT, ultimately till infinity 
 We gon' make sure y'all niggas straight when y'all get out 
 Shout out to all my niggas that's been locked down 
 Rest in peace to anybody that ain't here with us right now 
 RIP Chinaman, RIP Lotto, man... RIP Bo 
 I wish all y'all niggas could enjoy the luxury that we've got right now 
 It's not too many real niggas left out here 
 Everybody is claiming they true but they show they true colors at the end of the day 
 Niggas is chameleons to me, just blending in with they surroundings 
 ULT for life
