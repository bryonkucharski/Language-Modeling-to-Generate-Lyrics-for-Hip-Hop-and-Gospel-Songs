Hot pink, Valentine red 
 Black balloons, over my head 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Inside this paper plane 
 Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote 
 Taboo and I are in the same boat 
 What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float 
 Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute 
 Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not the mission 
 See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad 
 Translated my thoughts and feelings I pivot into the pad 
 Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes 
 Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold 
 Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated 
 Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated 
 Ten thousand feet, a thousand steps 
 I let it all sink to a thousand depths 
 Soon black balloons pop 
 That'll be the day the pain stops 
 Hot pink, Valentine red 
 Black balloons, over my head 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Hot pink, Valentine red 
 Black balloons, over my head 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh? 
 We gotta go and figure it out 
 I ain't tryna tell you that this life isn't it 
 And I just wanna be the rightest I could be 
 Show my son to think so he could fly high as could be 
 Always show examples how they kill niggas like me 
 Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy 
 Sign is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z 
 Andele, andele, my intelligence for threes 
 Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C 
 Cancel me like I ain't the number one G 
 Cancel me like you don't like "Dance On Me" 
 Quickly they forget how you changed on these lies 
 You flashing on these lights and you savin' these kids lives 
 And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit 
 Take your turn and fire with a pitchfork, bitch 
 Hot pink, Valentine red 
 Black balloons, over my head 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Hot pink, Valentine red 
 Black balloons, over my head 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me 
 Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float 
 Let it float, let it float by me
