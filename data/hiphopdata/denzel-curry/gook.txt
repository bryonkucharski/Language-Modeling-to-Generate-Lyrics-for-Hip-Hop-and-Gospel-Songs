 Back in high school, I admit I was a goon, but the way I rap had niggas fooled

 Hopping the fence by Carol City park, fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart 
 Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair 'cause I look like the nigga from Roots 
 Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook, nigga that ain't nothing new

 From the days, I've seen thus far 
 People tell me that I dip on the daily 
 One day, I'm gon' be a star, I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me 
 New chains and brand new cars 
 People tell me that it's all gonna change me 
 But for now, my mind's on mars 
 Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily
