 Yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Welcome to the darker side of taboo 
 All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos 
 Take another step in your path that you choose 
 Make a bad choice in your path then you lose 
 Welcome to the darker side of taboo 
 All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos 
 Take another step in your path that you choose 
 Make a bad choice in your path then you lose 
 Gorgeous beautiful taboo, always with a lot on her mind 
 You giving me all of your stories in the littlest amount of time 
 You loving me is forbidden, loving you back is a crime 
 I wrote this poem for you, forever remain in my rhymes 
 I knew you wasn't normal ever since the age of nine 
 I heard you were molested when you hit the age of five 
 So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died 
 You swallowing all of your pride, won't let anybody inside 
 As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say 
 Everything's gonna be okay 
 I'ma hold tight till I see the next day with you 
 Stay with you, play with you 
 Pray with you and pray to you 
 Curry kill the pussy hoping that I can kill the hate in you 
 Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you 
 Even if it's too late for me, forever I will wait for you 
 Watching your destiny fold in the grip of my palms 
 Paper planes being thrown on the side of the lawn, it said 
 Welcome to the darker side of taboo 
 All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos 
 Take another step in your path that you choose 
 Make a bad choice in your path then you lose 
 Welcome to the darker side of taboo 
 All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos 
 Take another step in your path that you choose 
 Make a bad choice in your path then you lose
