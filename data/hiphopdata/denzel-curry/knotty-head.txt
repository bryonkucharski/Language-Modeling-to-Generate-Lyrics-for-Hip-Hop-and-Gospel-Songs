It's history right here (Tote a 4 and pour some liq') 
 Wassup my nigga? (I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen) 
 It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city 
 (This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live) 
 We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me? (Knotty headed niggas) 
 Hair is nappy, knotty 
 Fuck karate, I got me a shotty 
 Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze 
 Origami if the neighbors saw me 
 But I won't fold, oh no 
 That's how the young boy's ass got smoked 
 But they got jacked like MK4 
 Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out 
 This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out 
 Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out 
 Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind 
 211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime 
 Get the product then we out the door 
 Mama I've been twistin' weed 
 And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro 
 Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us 
 Bitch I can't be touched 
 Get the product then we out the door 
 Mama I've been twistin' weed 
 And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go 
 Call me knotty head and if I ever go 
 Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure 
 I would never know 
 Tote a 4 and pour some liq' 
 I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen 
 This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live 
 Knotty headed niggas 
 Tote a 4 and pour some liq' 
 I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen 
 This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live 
 Knotty headed niggas 
 Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party 
 Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly 
 Bitches be givin' me sloppy 
 My pockets on Andy Milonakis 
 Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz 
 Rico's Story when I see the coppers 
 Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree 
 Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me 
 Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin' 
 Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace 
 Get the product then we out the door 
 Mama I've been twistin' weed 
 And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro 
 Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us 
 Bitch I can't be touched 
 Get the product then we out the door 
 Mama I've been twistin' weed 
 And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go 
 Call me knotty head and if I ever go 
 Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure 
 I would never know 
 Tote a 4 and pour some liq' 
 I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen 
 This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live 
 Knotty headed niggas 
 Tote a 4 and pour some liq' 
 I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen 
 This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live 
 Knotty headed niggas 
 Found another body in the lake 
 Same day another tattoo on his face 
 Obituary on his mother's fireplace 
 Baby motherfuck another sucker on a blind date 
 Shots fired every night I'm tryna mind mine 
 Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline 
 Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline 
 Hatin' on his dawg, shit I'm tryna find mine 
 Calm nigga, when I'm lit up I get Von Miller 
 Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us 
 Educated reading books I'm talkin' Art of War 
 Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors 
 I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes 
 Came to put my city on that's if I'm right or wrong 
 Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars 
 And I'm thinking of my dawgs since I'm livin' wrong 
 Jehovah's witness swear to God I done seen it all 
 Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark 
 You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off 
 D.C.C.C. we came to warn y'all 
 Motherfucker damn right we came to warn y'all 
 Motherfucker damn right we came to warn y'all 
 Curry what's up! Double M 
 It's futuristic shit
