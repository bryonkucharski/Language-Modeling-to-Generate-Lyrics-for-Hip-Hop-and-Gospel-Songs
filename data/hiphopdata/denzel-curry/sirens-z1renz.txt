Babe, when you hear the siren sounds 
 When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down 
 Babe, there's a time to stand your ground 
 Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down 
 Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate 
 With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yellin' "Mayday" 
 With a good girl gone bad girl who ain't gay cause her date rape 
 That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state 
 State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize 
 Revolution will never be televised 
 For the enemy, they never empathize 
 And I never voted, never sugar coat it 
 With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded 
 When the fire open, let it be your moment 
 When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! 
 This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic 
 Speakin' honestly, we livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies 
 Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States 
 Talkin' about let's make a fort, talkin' about let's make it great 
 If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot 
 Time to run with lions on the road to Zion 
 In this age of violence, time to grab the iron 
 When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when 
 Babe, when you hear the siren sounds 
 When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down 
 Babe, there's a time to stand your ground 
 Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down 
 Uh, look, okay 
 Ba-aby, I'm a fool because I thought you would stay whether I win or I lose 
 They already think we dead 
 But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head 
 I need to duck and I move, I bust a move when I 
 Find a way to get on and get up, get out the crib 
 I was just looking into the mirror, tryna dislocate my fear 
 'Cause you broke my heart, let me dry my tears 
 So serious, I'm so neglected 
 In the wrong direction with a long erection, got no protection 
 But it's, "fuck the world" 
 When she bend it over, being over-sensitive 
 But did I mention what my real intentions are? 
 Really dealin' with the consequences 
 And I see your tone is very condescending 
 When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it 
 And I pity the fool, been tryna to vent, but you ain't tryna hear it 
 Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it 
 Just how much you mean off to the side (oh, shit) 
 Oh say can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street 
 Bite the dust early like double Sprite, and a R.I.P. tee 
 So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blow in the night time 
 Of the slum house, little drum bump of the 1,000 
 (Come, come here they come) 
 Babe, when you hear the siren sounds 
 When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down 
 Babe, there's a time to stand your ground 
 Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down 
 Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons 
 Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin' 
 Historic prophets praise Muhammad 
 Diff'rent Strokes, Philip Drummond 
 Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin' 
 Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin' 
 Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London 
 Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin' 
 President in abundance, president is a puppet 
 Gotta hate it, gotta love it, Pass a class, I rise above it 
 Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' "fuck it" 
 Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference? 
 Now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned 
 What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition? 
 Not a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion? 
 Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin' 
 I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn
