Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Came up in this game now my idols is my rivals 
 Childhood friends end up pulling guns on you 
 Hoes wanna fuck because you carry funds on you 
 Like a blind man in church homie I don't see none of that 
 Still can't believe that I made it off rapping 
 Baby bottle blue (?) spitting blue magic 
 How the fuck the rap game, become a beauty pageant? 
 Fugazi ass rapper trying to sound like Atlanta 'cause they got no identity 
 I'm off the top like O-Ren Ishii vs Uma Thurman 
 Gasoline, in my thermos and I'm 'bout to make a furnace out you niggas 
 (?) Make the make believers call it Easter I am Jesus with a blacker penis that is fucking genius 
 Who said Jesus can't be a black guy? Even Luke Skywalker's father was on the dark side 
 Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Praying for my rivals let the church say (ay!) 
 Everything is vital, hand up on the rifle 
 (?) Let the case say (spray!) 
 Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Praying for my rivals let the church say (ay!) 
 Everything is vital, hand up on the rifle 
 Just like a 
 Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Started from the bottom where they wear bikini bottoms 
 Dig even deeper all you see is crabs in a bucket 
 When shit hit the fan niggas up it like "fuck it" 
 Spitting colder shit over cold shit my diamond you cold bitch 
 You like N64 go buy my old shit 
 I keep a AK on my Issa Gold shit 
 3 
 That's how it goes down on the lower East Coast bitch 
 South Florida (?) getting older mind of a marine ever since I was a teen 
 Blowing up smithereens, living a broke man's dream 
 Follow the roots of the prince till they crown me king 
 It seems, these niggas acting less than G's 
 This ain't the place that I choose to be 
 Where friends become strangers, everybody wants to be a gangsta 
 It's going down on the block, no anchor, STORY WITH NO TITLE! 
 Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Praying for my rivals let the church say (ay!) 
 Everything is vital, hand up on the rifle 
 (?) Let the case say (spray!) 
 Story with no title, everything is vital 
 Praying for my rivals let the church say (ay!) 
 Everything is vital, hand up on the rifle 
 Just like a 
 Story with no title, bullet with no name 
 I was brought up inside a city that was built of cane 
 Even during my sunny days I am still a hurricane I just wanna make it rain ain't no aim ba-bay 
 Watching babays, kids, we all babays kids 
 Little badass jit that's where the story begins 
 'Fore the end of the timeline, on to the crime crimes 
 Out here beefing ain't no working at Five Guys 
 It's wild, convicted felon put on trial 
 It's sad, a mother outlives her child 
 And that's bad, especially because we're black 
 When the revolution start that's when the niggas attack 
 I'm looking at the liars that say you ain't come from riches 
 Stop calling out women bitches fried chicken and watermelon 
 Stop a diet, I'm everything you fear and what defies 
 And if I die today it's not surprising, story with no title
