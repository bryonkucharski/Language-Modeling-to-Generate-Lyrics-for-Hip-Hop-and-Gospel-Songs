Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me, catch me 
 Catch me on the zenith, that's the only time you'll see 'em 
 Televised, paralyzed, thoughts are paraplegic 
 Sit yourself down, let us smoke up the ounce 
 Bounce till I'm leaking semen on your couch and then I'm out 
 Catch me on the zenith, from the Southern region 
 Federation is my motherfucking legion, we don't believe in 
 False prophets, fake gods and we never trust niggas 
 Two rules in my house, no shoes, no fuck niggas 
 Catch me on the zenith, fuck a TV screen, bitch, let it die 
 Look at your reflection, and ask "Who am I?" 
 I internally extinguish the evil so I look externally to a place I can see you and still 
 Catch me on the zenith, devastation several nations 
 Singing that my nation is the king, it's all praying on a better day 
 Bumping hay shit, fades away 
 Day by day, night by night, no iron, no sight 
 Catch me on the zenith like I'm Hercules and Xena 
 Or Trick Daddy or Trina with the victims of Katrina 
 When the levees broke, there was never hope 
 Turn the TV off, I'm out the door 
 'Bout to make some dough, on a lighter note 
 Catch me on the zenith getting jailed for misdemeanors 
 That's until I change the channel to an ad for Neutrogena 
 On the TV screen, before my very eyes, I know that revolution will never be televised, but 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em, nigga 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em, nigga 
 Catch me on a zenith that at the top holdin' my penis 
 While I'm screaming "Fuck the world!" that's the only time you'll see him 
 Bitch, niggas hate but wanna be him 
 'Cause I'm at the colosseum 
 Internationally known, you are known in your home 
 Catch me on a zenith, looking, down from my nimbus cloud 
 Just thinking aloud, "The sky's the limit", how nigga? 
 I'm in it now and, Still I Rise, and as crazy as it sounds we gon' get more high 
 Catch me on a zenith astral projecting to Venus 
 Woke up in a European with a singer 
 She said she just can't wait to get home and cook me dinner 
 Curry chicken for the soul, man I'm feeling like a winner 
 Swear I love that bitch 
 Catch me on a zenith, anything I say I mean it 
 Sorry if it hurt your feeling man, focused on my millions 
 Stacks piling past the ceiling, tryna get the future right for my future children 
 Like hol' that 
 Yeah, catch me on a zenith on the side the grass is greener 
 While I'm rolling up the reefer reeking louder than the speaker 
 Used to hate all of my teachers, now they in my bleachers 
 Cheering on my every move, now that I'm eating 
 Catch me on zenith channelling a fucking genius 
 While I catch the way these demons try to catch me while I'm sleeping 
 Won't slip, won't fall even if I did get back up and stand tall 
 Tell 'em suck my dick and catch me on a zenith bitch 
 For the last time, with my nigga D. Curry from the fucking C9 nigga 
 We done toured the whole globe two damn times 
 It's safe to say this shit is mine, man we run it 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em, nigga 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith 
 Catch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em, nigga
