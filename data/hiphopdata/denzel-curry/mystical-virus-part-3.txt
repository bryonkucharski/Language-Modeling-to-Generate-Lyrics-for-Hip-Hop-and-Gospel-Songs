Gold bullet that's trapped in his temple 
 Was just the beginning of a deranged mental 
 The mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle 
 They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple 
 To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom 
 With black on black tints, they jet in the rental 
 The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel 
 With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be? 
 The fetus of a demon 
 Semen from the tip 
 Of the penis I'm the only thing 
 That you see when you're dreaming 
 Armageddon and aftermath 
 This may blog in paragraphs 
 Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones 
 Blowing smoke and I laugh 
 Turning sinners like you 
 Into my personal acid tabs 
 Let me put you up on game 
 I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and 
 Still ain't deceased 
 I carry the mark of the beast 
 Now can you tell me 
 Who the fuck I be? 
 Damien, as the kid replies 
 Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes 
 Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies 
 As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life 
 And now that nigga scream like he Sindel 
 Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell 
 Running with them demons since the age of 12 
 Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein 
 He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position 
 Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in 
 Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in 
 And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions 
 He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness 
 Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance 
 Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions 
 He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference 
 He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit 
 And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment 
 Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat 
 He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth 
 But pops went to prison back in '03 
 So lil man never got to listen to a OG 
 Never got to tell him other options that you don't see 
 So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly 
 And now that nigga scream like he Sindel 
 Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell 
 Running with them demons since the age of 12 
 Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein 
 For the scene, see the best is never seen 
 They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience 
 I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation 
 Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga 
 Never compete, much less be winner at it 
 Seven days a week, I found my sinister 
 I control my perimeter, control isn't giving up 
 Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough 
 They talk around you, but you know you can't give in 
 And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them 
 Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen 
 Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah 
 I roll with what every character should have 
 That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast 
 Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun 
 I am Genesis 1, this is God's work done
