 Slide for the free, kill for the fee 
 Pull out the stick then I pull out the ski 
 Put a motherfucker face on a white tee 
 That's what a nigga get being P.I.E 
 Sweet, nigga you D.I.E 
 Sleep, motherfucker that's six feet 
 Deep, no tender, no love, no care 
 But a nigga here still gon' creep 
 T.L.C. put it to ya Lisa Lo' that's a nigga left 
 Eye, kill a nigga, get ghost, that 
 Patrick Swayze, come equipped with a vest 
 I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck 
 K's all in my trunk 
 So you best to get a chopper 
 It's nothing but goon action 
 I ain't talking Waka Flocka 
 That 2.7.5. goons 
 Bout' to do a fucking Gank 
 Bumping Waka Flocka Flame 
 In a underwater tank 
 Cause nigga die right now 
 Bullet or a fucking shank 
 Niggas always tryna' be 
 The hardest in the fucking paint 
 Never take kind to the threats 
 I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie 
 Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me? 
 Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up 
 Whole bunch of niggas if you run up 
 Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up 
 Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed 
 That's a one up, I'm a young gutta 
 Dog I mutter, Curry said cut 'em with his brudda 
 Leave them boys wet like water 
 Off with his neck, posted with the set 
 I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats 
 Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I'm good 
 Bust a nigga head for the cake 
 Jumping over gates can't wait 
 Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

 Savage life nigga 
 You don't wanna see me live 
 Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece 
 "Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man 
 I know your bitch love me 
 I know your bitch want me 
 She let me pillow pet that kitty 
 When she climb under this Snuggie 
 Bitch, South Florida 
 I only smoke mid in Broward 
 But end the flame of that Magic Dragon 
 And kill that Charmander, bitch 
 Gone on you niggas 
 Two phones on you niggas 
 Think I made it? 
 You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch
