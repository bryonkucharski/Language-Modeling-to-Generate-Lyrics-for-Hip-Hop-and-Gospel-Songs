Okay, all y'all niggas fuh as fuck 
 I'm ULT and I don't fuck with you if you ain't us, in me I trust 
 I turn these niggas into cosmic dust 
 I'm Loaded Lux with a loaded K, cock back I'll spray y'all bust 
 That playa shit, that Raider shit's been runnin' through my blood 
 These brand new niggas took my name and drug it through the mud 
 I get the hammer, I be the judge like Dredd 
 Police judge my dreads, fuck your favorite artists 
 Make sure they all dead 
 Shang Tsu, my son, broke it apart ran wit it 
 Weak shit, peep shit, stay dark, so tinted 
 Fuck around and get your dope fitted 
 New flows invented, shoot shit Cole Bennett 
 Rap game, don't get it 
 With these dumbass niggas, and they don't say shit 
 Sound like "Durr, durr, durr", you like "Oh, that's lit" 
 With yo' poof ass hips, I'ma fuck yo' bitch 
 I just popped two xans, nigga, fuck that shit! 
 On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On me, industry niggas the worst 
 Actin' like they from the dirt 
 On me, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed 
 Tryna put me in a hearse 
 On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On me, industry niggas the worst 
 Actin' like they from the dirt 
 On me, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed 
 Tryna put me in a, yuh, yuh, yuh! 
 Maybe I should go to jail to get my name up 
 Then get out and show you how to fuck the game up 
 Keep my name out yo' mouth, keep yo' chain tucked 
 Keep yo' dame cuffed, I could make her famous 
 She's a plain slut that loves it in the anus 
 I should rap about some lean and my diamond cuts 
 Get suburban white kids to want to hang with us 
 It's your friendly neighborhood, I don't give a fuck 
 Getting straight I innovate, you ad-libs on that 808 
 Don't need a tattoo on my face cause Denzel is a different race 
 I don't even try to hate, I'm just saying what I ain't 
 People sleeping on me hard and I'm the hardest in the bank 
 Eight years in the game and I never rode a wave 
 I may be overlooked, but I'm never underpaid 
 And when I win a Grammy I'ma take it back to Dade 
 You signing to a label where they treat you like a slave 
 On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On me, industry niggas the worst 
 Actin' like they from the dirt 
 On me, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed 
 Tryna put me in a hearse 
 On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On me, industry niggas the worst 
 Actin' like they from the dirt 
 On me, I do not fuck with the percs 
 I barely fuck with the Earth 
 On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed 
 Tryna put me in a 
 Finish him Zel
