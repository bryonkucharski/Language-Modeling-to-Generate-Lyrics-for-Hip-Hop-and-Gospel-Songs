Tell me what you niggas know bout niggas like me 
 Rolling K.O.D. while on LSD 
 Tell me what y'all niggas know bout niggas like me 
 Rolling K.O.D. while on LSD 
 I'm fried, I'm in my zone 
 I got that kush, I got Patron 
 I got that weed, and LSD 
 And your bitch just popped a molly 
 I'm fried, I'm in my zone 
 I got that kush, I got Patron 
 I got that weed, and LSD 
 And your bitch just popped a molly 
 I be the universe gangster, runnin' through your damn block 
 Click, clack, poppin', that's the sound of the grey matter Glock 
 So I be Aquarius killa, that nigga guerrilla when runnin' up 
 Alaska in my heart so who gon' tell me that I give a fuck 
 Or what Goddess that I'm smashin' when I leave the club 
 Angel, soarin' through the dancefloor like a kokita 
 God damn, really when the mother nature got us up in my galaxy 
 Lavishly, livin' in the mansion where we play Grey's Anatomy 
 Doctor, I am so proper, look at the posture 
 I'll cross her, and finally caught her but then I lost her 
 Found her, a close encounter, over-the-counter 
 I bounce her, I wouldn't play her 'cause I'm not Bowser 
 Arouse her, gave her a heart, drop dollars and browsers 
 Amped up, I think we stamped up, she's in my trousers 
 Wowsers, she's at the tower, peek in the shower 
 The flowers become the power within the hour 
 Cowards, spaces to outer, green as the outer 
 Glow, after I'm stickin' my dick in this ho, beggin' for mo', whoa 
 Whoa, slow down, she thought I was destroyin' her 
 She likes the way it feels when she's searchin' for euphoria 
 Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida 
 On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria 
 Estefan back in 1985 
 Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
