Your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit 
 And then you realize that life is a bitch 
 With a dirty white tee and some dirty ass kicks 
 And you got no money so you can't feed the jit 
 Your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit 
 And then you realize that life is a bitch 
 Got no education so you got to be the chick 
 That strip for a living cause you gotta pay the rent 
 Pity, pity, pity, first you showing off them titties 
 Letting niggas lick the clittie to a flower or some witty comment 
 Witty, now you shitty with those saggy tig ol' bitties 
 And a flabby old ass, trying to look like Ms. Nicky 
 Picky, 'cause I say you look like Ms. Piggy 
 It's a damn shame that we the same pigment 
 First you act like Bobby, now you look like Whitney 
 If a nigga know the chorus then please say it with me 
 Nigga, nigga, nigga, let a nigga level with you 
 How the hell you gon' be broke and always be the bigger spender? 
 Stories sweeter than the splenda thrown inside the blender 
 So you wanna get crunk while you mix it with the liquor 
 Nigga, people like you, I don't get ya 
 Claimin' you a baller but your momma living with ya 
 Better look inside the picture, cause you ain't getting richer 
 Now it's hard to see his son cause his momma took him with her 
 Let 'em do whatever, it's whatever 
 Now you never from the streets 
 To the clubs, to the guns, to the cheader 
 Till you get a phone call, e-mail, or a letter that your jit locked up 
 Or he dead on the stretcher? 
 Better 
 Parenting is the main pressure 
 Your daughter got kissed but wasn't taught about pleasure 
 Your kids are the treasure, the love you couldn't measure 
 Will end up in the hole if you don't get it together
