It's like a blaze when I say your name 
 Because your body is just striking 
 Enlightening 
 Like lightning 
 The storm here, is quiet 
 I bite it 
 When hearing the moans and groans as I dip deep 
 Your knees weak 
 But don't speak 
 When my spirit 
 Is in sync 
 Along with you 
 I lust for you like London Jones 
 If you my ride or die 
 Would you ride or grip the chrome? 
 In a Mercedes Benz 
 With fine clothes we roam 
 Just like the traveler, no? 
 Till we entered inside your home 
 It's known 
 That Denzel can give you the mo' better 
 Adrenaline rush 
 As I proceed to get you wetter 
 I bless her 
 Just like a pastor seeing someone sneezing 
 Good evening 
 The way you look just blossoms as the season 
 Spring 
 Meaning you're clean, which is next to godliness 
 Thank the good Lord he blessed the earth with beautiful goddesses 
 Dropin' it 
 To the surface, like a fallen angel 
 The devil has a new dress 
 My butterflies are painful 
 Tame you 
 So that I can pet the pussy cat 
 Soft and heavy moaning when I hit it from the back 
 Skies are looking kinda misty as the scene faded black 
 Both hands on the wheel ain't no thing as turning back 
 You can search, the whole world 
 Just to see 
 And I'll pay, for your trip 
 It's on me 
 You might go, your whole life 
 Just to find 
 Out it was, a complete 
 Waste of time 
 'Cause there ain't no one like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga no 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga no 
 'Cause there ain't no one like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga no, there a nigga 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga 
 It's just, you and I 
 And God watching over 
 Kissing on my neck and hands going down my shoulder 
 Closer and closer 
 You're feeling a little colder 
 My mind is saying stroke her but I wanna console her 
 Hold her 
 Love is in the eye of the beholder 
 She could be my Sade and I could be her soldier 
 Told her 
 Once when we get a little older 
 Hopefully we'll push a little baby in a stroller 
 Lower 
 Is the tone she whispered in my ear 
 She said "I love you Denny and I love you near and dear" 
 Never knew Nasir 
 But the words were sincere 
 When I went inside her mind, it was like Revista Leer 
 I read between the lines 
 In her eyes I spot a tear 
 I uttered to her softly, girl you have nothing to fear 
 I kiss her on the lips 
 Then she told me to come here 
 As she climbed to the top 
 She became my chandelier 
 Not knowing 
 Created another life this very moment 
 The future of my very insistence's got me open 
 It's potent 
 Like the smoke, when its in my lungs 
 It's a fire in the air 
 With the greeting of the tongues 
 But none 
 Will ever come between me and her bond 
 So leave my sanctuary don't come back and don't respond 
 This my garden of Eden 
 But as one this is our temple 
 My miniature moral is more than just being central 
 You can search, the whole world 
 Just to see 
 And I'll pay, for your trip 
 It's on me 
 You might go, your whole life 
 Just to find 
 Out it was, a complete 
 Waste of time 
 'Cause there ain't no one like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga no 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga no 
 'Cause there ain't no one like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga no, there a nigga 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me, no 
 Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga
