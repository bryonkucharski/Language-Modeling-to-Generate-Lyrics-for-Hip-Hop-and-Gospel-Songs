Equalizer, synthesizer 
 Ultimately I will brutalize ya 
 I got the shit that could take out New York 
 I do not fuck with the population 
 Contemplation killing competition 
 Confrontation, reevaluation 
 You don't want to see the revelation 
 Straps looking like I left the ozone 
 Stop, doctor said he couldn't hold on 
 Cut, motherfucker I am Logan 
 N-I-G-G-A Attila The Hun 
 Mixed with Bishop Magic Juan 
 I got the fuckin' magic wand 
 I am the ugly, I am so ugly 
 With the face only a mother could love me 
 Nothing is lovely, only get loneliness 
 Phoniness, only resides on the tongue 
 Sun, is never radiant, come in the gun 
 So instantaneous it is begun 
 No way escaping the dough 
 Suicide thoughts with the murder I wrote 
 Tears from anonymous poking my promises 
 Fiending it I will return later on 
 Fuck it, it's halo I wouldn't respawn 
 Equalizer, synthesizer 
 Ultimately I will brutalize ya 
 I got the shit that could take out New York 
 I do not fuck with the population 
 Contemplation killing competition 
 Confrontation, reevaluation 
 You don't want to see the revelation 
 Straps looking like I left the ozone 
 Stop-
