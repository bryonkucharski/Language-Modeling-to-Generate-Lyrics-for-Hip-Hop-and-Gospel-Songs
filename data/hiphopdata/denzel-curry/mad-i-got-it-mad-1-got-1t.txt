Big cheese pilin' 
 You speed dialin' 
 You talk shit, but I keep smilin' 
 That's your chick, but not my chick 
 'Cause she got mileage 
 That's your head, but not my head 
 'Cause I drop knowledge 
 You glad when I never had shit 
 But mad I got it 
 Niggas wanna turn their back, spine 
 She don't wanna fuck no more, fine 
 I'ma be that nigga some day, time 
 Lost some couple friends on the way, crime 
 Even in the end you could never end me 
 Still in the hood and I still sip tea 
 When I go in, I'ma go for the win 
 On point like syringe and it's like that 
 Living life full of sin, gotta cup full of Hen' 
 Put my tears in a pen and I write back 
 Ice pack cause' my heart lost 
 I'm so cold that I Jack Frost 
 I'm 'bout be on the upper echelon 
 Niggas gonna hate on the man that I become 
 Big cheese pilin' 
 You speed dialin' 
 You talk shit but I keep smilin' 
 That's your chick but not my chick 
 'Cause she got mileage 
 That's your head, but not my head 
 'Cause I drop knowledge 
 You glad when I never had shit 
 But mad I got it 
 Niggas wanna take my life, stripes 
 Police never read my rights, right 
 Only wanna fuck me for the fame, ight 
 Another rapper hit it in the same, night 
 Niggas ain't shit and the hoes ain't loyal 
 Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you 
 Then expect the royal treatment 
 Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin' 
 Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken 
 Venomous words, watching the poison leakin' 
 Bandana on my motherfuckin' face 
 .38 on my motherfuckin' waist 
 When you see me better man up 
 Better make like a roller coaster put your hands up 
 Big cheese pilin' 
 You speed dialin' 
 You talk shit, but I keep smilin' 
 That's your chick, but not my chick 
 'Cause she got mileage 
 That's your head, but not my head 
 'Cause I drop knowledge 
 Mad I got it 
 Mad I got it 
 Hate the government, capital punishment 
 I keep a heater on my hip, don't need an oven mitt 
 I'm on some other shit, mind is twisted 
 I wear this mask every day, Stanley Ipkiss 
 Realistic views, a pessimistic blues 
 I sing along, who's got me on my crip shit 
 Lipstick, long kiss from the devil lips 
 Moonlit, two hits from the cannabis 
 Death knocking at my door, who could it be? 
 Life not sweet like suit wit' an E 
 Try to read me, would it be, Stephen King 
 Big cheese only bring me Misery 
 Insane with no brain, I'm low zane 
 No fame and no thangs is so strange 
 Do things that I don't see violent 
 Stick a nigga up because I'm mad he got it 
 Got it, got it, 'cause I'm mad he got it, got it
