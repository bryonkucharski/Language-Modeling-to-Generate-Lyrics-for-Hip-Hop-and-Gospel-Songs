I do this for my niggas 
 I do this for myself 
 Enter my mind 
 That's all I can say nigga 
 Five in the morning turn to six 
 My life has turned into a bitch 
 With the fucking wettest clit in the galaxy 
 Rapidly tripping and rapping and snapping 
 And killing my niggas that coming through blasting 
 And looking for money and looking for magic 
 We sticking together like metal and magnets 
 Lutrashious, me and Mercedes up in the condo 
 On the phone for 9 months, we sparked the conver-sation 
 Enter the void, mind escaping 
 Racing, plus my heart rate went blazing 
 Ganja, as I ponder on graduation 
 Threats hit a nigga the points where I could make it 
 Not a contract could take what I created 
 Not on paper my clan name erased it 
 Down nigga since day one, I never hate shit 
 Same nigga tat 275 on the pavement 
 Got highs and lows on one path of greatness 
 18 years live life larger than basic 
 Marquis, Andrew, Darnell, etcetera 
 Its still my niggas, know things will get better but 
 Things take time, and all things change 
 Some people venture off and make they own lane 
 But the place is just the same from the F.L.A 
 But my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the 8 
 From the clip 
 And my nigga William had his last trip 
 When he hung his self in his room, roll up the spliff 
 As I puff one, puff two for my niggas 
 Then three for the niggas that be hating 
 Nigga I don't care 
 Aquarius Killa, the Mack 
 Talk your girl up out her underwear 
 Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear 
 Suicidal thoughts I'm on my head to make it clear 
 Another life in day, hallucinate got me in my rear 
 Lamborghini dreams, Freddy Krueger is my shooter 
 Raider still the klan but C9 is the future 
 Bitch 
 Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game 
 Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game 
 Synthesize, and realize, life's no game 
 No game 
 No game 
 No game 
 I should have said it's no game 
 No game 
 No game 
 No game 
 Synthesize, and realize, life's no game 
 Synthesize, and realize, life's no game 
 No game 
 Synthesize, realize, life's no game 
 Synthesize, realize, life's no game 
 (Game over man)
