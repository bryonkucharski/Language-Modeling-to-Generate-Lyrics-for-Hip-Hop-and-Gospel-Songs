B-Legit: 
 I clear the corners like homers with the bass is strong (?) 
 They can't stand to see me with it so I fakes no funk 
 No punk in my bloodline 
 Just killas and shit 
 Ride to town like the biggest dope dealers with grip, bitch 
 It ain't easy being wealthy 
 Staying healthy 
 Knowing sucka muthufuckas they want to melt me 
 But I ain't ice cream, butter, or the cheddar cheese 
 You better peep the Berreta of a nigga sleep 
 Big Bone: 
 'Cause they be knowin' about the city that I'm comin' out of 
 Check your shit 
 You might come up short of your hefty grip 
 We nightcrawlers straight underground 
 Jackin' you for your shit nigga 
 What you gonna do now? 
 When you see us niggas comin' through 
 Grab your bitch and your kids 
 We want 'em too 
 Yeah, 'cause playaz come out when it's sunny 
 But when night time comes 
 Those playaz turn into gangstas and get they money 
 D-Day: All the time I'm pumpin dope 
 For those who underestimate the propa shit 
 And won't quit until I accumulate the propa grip 
 So don't trip 
 As we get with these fools who thought they knew 
 From the gate 
 Keep it straight when fuckin' with my crew 
 'Cause I'll be going up out my way to keep this shit straight 
 Mobb down about the town like a pancake 
 Earthquake I'm shakin 'em up like my hurricane 
 Applying pressure whenever and it's a damn shame 
 We spit the superfly shit 
 Makin' a bitch say hey 
 Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money 
 We keep them pistols and gats 
 Down for peelin' them caps 
 'Cause them niggas from my camp get's down like that 
 D-Day: 
 Keep on hearin' niggaz hollin 'bout they ass gotta go 
 And where they gotta be 
 One more time I kick rhymes and they don't wanna see 
 Do Rae Me 
 Rippin' shit on this M-I-C 
 Down with two more muthafuckas 
 Who finna spit it see 
 Big Bone: Fuckin' with this rap could be bubblelicous 
 Clear the industry of guppies and goldfishes 
 We spit the super fly raps 
 Makin' a bitch say shit 
 Who the fuck could it be 
 A-1 and B-Legit 
 B-Legit: 
 They got me twisted as hell 
 It seems I see some females 
 Some long ass weaves guess jeans and lee nails 
 But I can't tell 
 The corbel ain't got me brainy 
 Bitches all stuck to my paint 'cause I'm candy 
 Hand me the muthafuckin' blunt ba-by 
 I do's a bird 35 down I-Eigh-ty 
 I'm tryin' to get this bitch to the show now 
 Oh you know it go down 
 Fuckin' with the t-nown bitch 
 We spit the superfly shit 
 Makin' a bitch say hey 
 Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money 
 We keep them pistols and gats 
 Down for peelin' them caps 
 'Cause them niggas from my camp get's down like that 
 Big Bone: 
 I'm clowin' muthafuckas givin' 'em away 
 Got your whole block flooded with meth and yay 
 Tell the asian man I'm on my way 
 I need major hook 
 Niggas hog moggin' 
 Tryin' to keep the whole book 
 But it don't go down like that 
 I bring the heat 
 Leave a nigga relaxing in his front seat 
 Head back like he asleep 
 With the reak of a muddy lake 
 Caught a man code 3 bring the yellow tape 
 D-Day: 
 As I get in where I fit in 
 Some funky ass shit 
 Down with niggas in my click 
 To let 'em know who they be fuckin' wit' 
 Got the shit locked down like up in SQ 
 Comin' new in '96 is what you best do 
 I test 1, 2 and then I straight run through 
 Up in the V-A double where you best come true 
 'Cause I'll be choppin' up on this game like a ginsu 
 And all you bitches and tricks know what a nigga like me into 
 B-Legit: 
 Some thousand gram units with the cash around 'em 
 I'll pour 'em out the window 
 And the task they found 'em 
 They try to get a nigga 
 But it's too much scratch 
 And fools from my camp get's down like that 
 We spit the superfly shit 
 Makin' a bitch say hey 
 Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money 
 We keep them pistols and gats 
 Down for peelin' them caps 
 'Cause them niggas from my camp get's down like that
