 Hold up... 
 It's the motherfuckin Corruptor! Since I came I was a hustler 
 It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains 
 To make these motherfuckers peep my game, I let 'em hang 
 To the flo', snot on the snow, and full of kicked on rivals 
 It's for survival, in the intestines of the city 
 Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll 
 So they can't bust us 
 And we shine like diamond clusters, 'cause we some made motherfuckers 
 (Bun B) 
 Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin' 
 I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen 
 I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin 
 Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution) 
 (It's the Corruptor's execution)

 I be workin and twerkin' 
 My portable digital triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter! 
 (Teeter-totter!) Kind of like a see-saw, up and down (up and down!) 
 A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that there soft white 
 Baby powder, equals a ? up the Valley 
 Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?" 
 All the tiffles and po'po' (and what happened) I got it back 
 (BITCH!) Don't make me do ya (don't make me do ya..) 
 I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu

 I'm havin' small change, with gats and hundred sacks 
 I got to ball main (ball main) with thangs, I let 'em hang 
 It ain't at all strange (at all strange) with game, remain the Savage 
 And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one 
 I come with guns smokin' (guns smokin') leave you croakin in Oakland 
 Without no words spoken (words spoken) put the Chevy in drive 
 And ride the block hopin (block hopin) not to choke up in? 
 With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that

 Now we get the cash the stash and bash your brains 
 All over this dashboard 
 Give up the hash, and get you some gas 
 Who'll blast you main in man's sport 
 Now BRRRR stick 'em I kick em, Bobby you lick em 
 We stole 'em and brick 'em to death 
 K.S.'ll go left, finger flick em, bitches is breathin 
 They last motherfuckin, breath 
 On the real how you feel about caps get peeled 
 I just baby deal with the talk 
 You backin the guns and all the law 
 So just hopin these bastards know that we strong 
 Fuckin' 'em quick in the back with the dick then 
 Make sure ? don't know throw a trick in 
 Keep yours eyes on Nich-en 
 'Cause we stickin the Bic in, any sick then
