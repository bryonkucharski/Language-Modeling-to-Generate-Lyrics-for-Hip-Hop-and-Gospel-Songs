Gouda, sick wid it records 
 BME, Warner Brothers, the machinery 
 Ooh, look out pimp 
 Heavy on the grindin' entertainment 
 Stovetop productions 
 Ooh, hustlers are us 
 My game sharper than an elephant's tusk 
 Me, myself and I the only that I can trust 
 Sleep with one eye open finger on the pistol clutch 
 I got my hands and everything, I'm real instrumental 
 I'm as real as they come and don't need no bitch potential 
 When I was comin' up there certain things we don't allow 
 Like long fingernails and men arching they eyebrows 
 Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve 
 How all of a sudden snitchin' became cool? I dunno 
 Gamed up I be chewin' on this mack granite 
 OG Jay be stomped that laced that niggas posted never can 
 I brought the baddest broad in the whole facilitation 
 All by way of mouthpiece just by my manipulation 
 I can make it look like I'm at my best when I'm at my worst 
 Persuade the broad to put on the dress and break her for her purse 
 Ten wraps and a rubber band 
 (Gouda) 
 Three or four more in my other hand 
 (Gouda) 
 Five, ten, fifteen, twenty 
 (Gouda) 
 Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty 
 (Chalupa) 
 Gettin' money, I'm a stunna, man 
 (Gouda) 
 In a Lac shootin' box like a hundred grand 
 (Gouda) 
 Forty-five, fifty-five, sixty-five, seventy-five 
 (Gouda) 
 Eighty-five, ninety-five, wait, what am I doing? 
 (Chalupa) 
 A day in the life on the soil in caliscrillya 
 Take the wrong turn and these youngstas out here kill ya 
 Well, I ain't concerned, they love us hustlas and dealers 
 They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some ikeas 
 Ooh, just tryna get my point across 
 Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos 
 Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches 
 Where I'm from we do it bare-faced instead of ski masks 
 Ooh, no more talking on them cells 
 I heard the federal went ahead and bought Nextels, what? 
 Ooh, over crowded jails 
 They got us sleepin' in the gym instead of our own cells 
 Ooh, put our yeti together 
 Me and my investors, we flippin' ten or better 
 I got some Gouda, got a little bit of cheddar 
 My medallion got more colors than a peacock feather 
 Ten wraps and a rubber band 
 (Gouda) 
 Three or four more in my other hand 
 (Gouda) 
 Five, ten, fifteen, twenty

 Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty

 Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man 
 With bitch like I do little whips about the stunna van 
 My advice she a runner man 
 Off top, I'ma boss, shoe box full of rubber bands 
 Contraband on the other hand 
 Big girls, big quips, turn around, roll center man 
 On the real, I'm a gentleman 
 Put the scrilla, I'm a killa, man, hit it like a little man 
 What you doin' with that? 
 From the scratch, we can load up the Lac 
 A 1, we can bring that back from day 1, we get them wraps 
 Big stacks from the back of the shack 
 I buy the weed man 
 Hella turkey bags just to put my weed in 
 Oh, we gettin' Chalupa 
 Wrapped cheese in a rubber band and call it the Gouda 
 Ten wraps and a rubber band
