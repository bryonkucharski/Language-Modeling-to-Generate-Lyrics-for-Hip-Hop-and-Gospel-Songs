 You niggas better expect retaliation feel the playa hation 
 Yeah you the next to get dropped I don't hide the glock 
 Real niggas don't stop pop pop 
 Put him in the mud nigga and your body rot 
 Top closing down on your caskets 
 Wanna make these bastards think we got mercy 
 Putting in work since a nigga thirteen 
 Sending niggas like yourself off in a hearse 
 See I won't hesitate to kill you wanna fill you with a couple of my slugs 
 Fucking with my thugs and I'm needing my love nigga what 
 Bone niggas fin to do a little damage 
 Take over the planet with my daily tortures 
 Of course it's the nigga that's takin' no shorts 
 Smokin' on the newports your ghetto resource 
 And bitch you wanna dig your own ditch 
 And hit you with levels beyond your control 
 My momma never raised no punks and hoes 
 Just relear niggas comin' up snatchin souls for dough 
 I know y'all motherfuckers out there somewhere ain't nowhere to hide 
 Makin' motherfuckers feel the vibe for life 
 In the midst of the twist I'll be down to ride 
 (Bizzy) 
 We're ready for war 
 (Majesty) 
 Ridin' with death 
 (Layzie) 
 We niggas rappin' but still we actin' like criminals 
 (Bizzy) 
 I'ma relent and furiated that you hated and pap pap can't fade it 
 We stay heavily sedated comin' now back up my buck get shaken 
 Deeply dreaming about this demon my daddy told me it was comin' 
 Trapped in the form of a bad omen it's wicked it was written I'll be 
 Runnin' while turnin' around and blastin back to buck 'em fuck 'em 
 They came back and moved and like I'm ready for war is that all you got 
 Heard the mack was talkin' this and that bout some of my incidents 
 Said I smoke and snatchin purses you heard this lil EZ told me 
 Bitch clonin little EZ's niggas so fuck you you weren't original 
 Mono why mono ain't no subliminal Hey 
 When I regime in fatigues we ready to bleed even when they sleepin' 
 Catch me caught me must have seen 
 And they're gonna get your ass next weekend 
 (Majesty) 
 My mental seduction run your whole sound suction abduction of lyrics 
 Is the loss of life love and spirits 
 Capital offense for generics lost in the prison 
 Lieutenants overseeing the barracks checkin' in 
 Mark ass copy cat incoherance is crucial 
 Smokin' hay that bite shit like microchips 
 I watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom 
 When you're fate rotten, bitch, when I spot 'em I'ma drop 'em 
 (Layzie) 
 Surrounded bby violence my nigga I'm bound to just live a lifetime 
 And this shrink wanna get inmy head 'cause I'm amongst the walking dead 
 All I really said if you niggas don't fled you gone bleed bloody red 
 Nigga shoot the spot and got ghosts fuckin' with the mastermind of all time 
 Letting niggas know we off in our prime 
 It'll be that way to ninety-ninety-nine 
 Criminal-minded niggas been blinded 
 Looking for a style like Bone but can't see me 
 Just like mike everybody wanna be me 
 Study every movie nigga makin' on TV 
 Easy does it do it easy what it is number one better check the score 
 Here we go nigga don't wanna fight no more 
 But I'm ready for you hoes and that's for sure 
 (Bizzy) 
 When the ghetto needs me I'll be grippin to the scripture picture 
 Little Ripsta can I get critical 
 And I'm seldom seen in the henessey when I ride up on my enemies 
 Zero one of my heroes Jesus blessed me to be lethal 
 With my automatic let you have it you don't wanna see any evil 
 Motherfuckers I'll take it to the people 
 Then I will meet you at the funeral 
 Get 'em up Bizzy Mafiaso no witness is the usual 
 Further mo murder mo ready with guns I'll serve you hoes 
 When they call niggas hit the road 
 And when they get killed I'ma get your soul 
 (Krayzie) 
 You thinkin' I'm slippin with niggas that itchin to rob me 
 Yes they want to give me bloody body 
 By pumping a couple of slugs inside me 
 But I'll be damned we won if it comes to guns and I'm 
 Stacking them thangs so you gets none statics automatic fun 
 Want some come come come execution redrum rum 
 See what you see in my eyes murder murder death defied 
 Burnt alive fried when they die 
 No one was able to find them 'cause they're bodies went up in a fire 
 Fuck they family try to creep 
 But you think I'm asleep 'cause I'm pumpin beats 
 Nigga better believe we keep much heat up under my seat yeah 
 Shoot 'em up quick in a minute and within a minute 
 You already suckas I bet that you bent it we sent it 
 We'll atest for the murder we should we dealt it 
 You thought you was flippin but got K.O.D'd 
 Ring-a-ling-a-ling get that ass up outta there 
 The undisputed thugs in harmony proved it 
 Kicked a couple of niggas asses 
 Gotta take off and stay still blastin 
 Locked in the state penatentiary but dog that ain't shit 
 Better make your money baby and pick up a couple of guns on the side 
 So when you ride and you get high don't let them haters run up your side
