(Feat. B-Legit, Niki Scarfo, Rame Royal, Richie Rich) 
 (Verse 1: Rame Royal) 
 I let the dark metal bark wit no emotion 
 Sharply focused 
 Tearin through yo heart like a shark in the ocean 
 What gave you the notion that you could slow my hustle 
 Take a share my business 
 I make you bear witness to this Oakland quarter sack vandall 
 Runnin' a quarter panell 
 An you can order that on any rap channel 
 Wit enough ammo an a black flannel 
 To bury Rambo 
 Writin plans fo my camary land flow. 
 (Verse 2: B-Legit) 
 I swang loose at night 
 Sav-el wit stripes 
 Train in mist to be a killa 
 9-8 Vern Miller 
 Fill it to the top wit the Aiwa duce 
 An no game niggas get the fuck cut loose 
 7-duce tonight 
 I roll one right 
 A vet on a set still trumped up tight 
 Work streets at night 
 Supreme so clean 
 Gettin' money from the block like a slot machine. 
 (Verse 3: Niki Scarfo) 
 I turn the blocks to war zones 
 Hin and juice fills my cantine 
 I'm at home when I blast chrome to keep the pressure on beam 
 Murder scenes 
 He got hit when he crossed the grain 
 No time to explain 
 Two in his brain, that's the game 
 Fuck the fame 
 I want the fortune 
 The best place is outta town 
 The Vill was scorchin 
 Years an years of drama 
 Creeps, murder beef 
 Seems niggas lost sleep over freaks caught up between the sheets. 
 (Chorus: Richie Rich) 
 Niggas need the money and the muscle 
 Picture that 
 A hog, a pimp, an two dogs wit no muzzles 
 In an everyday struggle 
 We had to hustle 
 My camp 
 Stay amped about the stamp spender. 
 Chick getter 
 Hard hitter 
 Got a bitch in the club, Stick Wit Her 
 Nigga, 'cause if we get her 
 We gon' have it our way 
 Hard times an connected wit the Bay. 
 (Verse 4: Richie Rich) 
 I'm screamin "Silence peeps" 
 Come down them streets 
 4 point 4 pounds of blow is two ki's 
 Sticky finger 
 Hit each kick for 6 zips 
 Slick nigga paintin my town in new whips 
 The coke bouncer 
 Low number announcer 
 12 zones short nigga finna take him court 
 It's my click 
 I know they notice, we evict 
 We on some mo fuck a bitch, slang rock shit 
 Check this. 
 (Verse 5: Rame Royal) 
 I slang a bomb of quarter back like Randall 
 Drop back 
 Caulk back the gat 
 Blow out yo candle 
 To hot to hold 
 To hard to handle when I unload 
 Still knockin' jumbo 
 Watchin for Columbo 
 Rock it to the top of the pot like gumbo 
 Paparazzi spot feds wit Royal to crumble 
 Been breakin bread an tryin' to count much more 
 Makin' big heads till my pockets look like Mount Rushmore. 
 (Verse 6: Niki Scarfo) 
 My games uphold 
 To push a Rolls puffin doe 
 While I'm seen sellin soda goes beyond golden flows 
 From the Vill to weight holders 
 Weighed his vest down 
 An still got touched jumpin' outta Range Rovers 
 5 g's to a soldier 
 And 5 after 
 Fuck the feds 
 And he finally got a chapter 
 'Cause juss the heat the streets be crucial 
 So believe when you face this killa the feelin' mutual. 
 (Verse 7: B-Legit) 
 I gots 2 pits wit me an they tone the pimp 
 Go hard 
 A nigga disregard that lip 
 Pump it down in yo hole 
 The green in yo doe 
 Got bitches movin shit out department stores 
 It's H-O-Z dedicated to work 
 Like to pull on my colla when I pimp it work 
 If it's yo skirt 
 She choose ya lose 
 Either that or the d-boy blues. 
 Biatch. 
 (Verse 8: Richie Rich) 
 Nigga refer to the hook see the clothes by the bitch 
 It's real shit 
 Remember the muscle an same hustle 
 Wants free hustle put yo mind at ease 
 Smoke weed 
 A nigga do whatever he please 
 Two dogs 
 One hog 
 An one pimp 
 Pushin heir-ron, coke, ex an hemp 
 Niggas got this game at a stand still 
 Keep the land filled wit leaves of coke until my hands filled.
