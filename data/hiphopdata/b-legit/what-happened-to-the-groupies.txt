 Short, Short, what's up man, this Captain man check this out 
 I know you and be -Legit finna get in here and get down on this song right? 
 But y'all can't be talkin' bad about broads, man, you know? 
 Y'all in here talkin' bout "suckin this" and "suckin that" 
 Aww shit, here come be pullin up in his 600 blowin' big weed, y'all be cool man 
 (Verse 1: be -Legit/Too $hort) 
 Legit: 
 I blaze blunts all day get keyed all night 
 Be the one to take flight if the smoke ain't right 
 I'm tight, nicknamed Ike for the drama 
 It's baby and her mama, naked in a sauna 
 Down with the gang 'cause them flows be hard 
 Blue mink, Short, and my St. Brenard 
 Super bad man all around Hoo-J 
 Tell me what the fuck happened to the groupies 
 Too $hort: 
 What happened to the groupies, I thought they was comin' through 
 To do everything we want 'em to 
 Supposed to be all good when they get here 
 Break niggas off, bitch we real playas 
 Baby in the red said "It's coo'" 
 She gonna give me some pussy, and some head too 
 I ain't trippin' though, these bitches takin' too long 
 I'm bout to call some other hoes on the phone 
 Legit: 
 Tell 'em I'm a hog nigga, need a triple-X bitch down to stick 
 Turn tricks switched the dick 
 There's hips outside and I'm fo' sho' dat 
 And the finest ho she know where mo' at 
 Gotta show that, nigga tuck my jewels 
 Can't be slippin with a bitch, niggas know that shit 
 Hit me at the room when the hoes come 
 It be at 301 we callin for some 
 Too $hort: 
 Where they at be -Legit where they at? (where they at) 
 Let these bitches know there's some real playas back 
 Told her meet me in room 510 on the mattress 
 If you do it right then I'll be back bitch 
 Another showdown, in yo' town 
 Let everybody know you my ho now 
 I'm feelin' way too cool off the gin and juice 
 I'm bout to fuck my bitch and her friend too (and her friend too) 
 Captain Save-A-Hoe: 
 Damn, see man y'all niggas is trippin' man, 
 Niggas this '98 y'all actin' like its still '88 
 Short cussin, and all this bullshit, 
 Check this out--see baby and them leavin' see? 
 Baby come here, c'mon, baby don't even trip, just kick it for a lil while 
 You know what I'm sayin'? I'll take you to Sizzler to go eat after awhile 
 I'll make 'em stop trippin', don't even trip baby it's all good 
 Verse 2: Too $hort/B-Legit 
 Too $hort: 
 I'm feelin' good, everything hooked up right 
 Before it's all over I'ma be in som'n tight 
 Looked down at my hip to check my pager 
 Tryin' to find me a bitch, fresh off the stage 
 Nigga ain't hungry, fuck the after party 
 Told a cute groupie "Bitch meet me in the lobby" 
 You know how we do it, told her bring all her friends 
 Next weekend we gonna do it all again 
 Be -Legit: 
 I said it out my mouth on the mic real loud 
 We at the Holiday-Inn, room 510 
 Bring all the bitches even if they dikes 
 We hyped, hoes eatin pussy tonight 
 Seen her in my mug, peepin my game 
 Lookin' like she could take dick in the brain 
 We all champagne and Cali green 
 I need a bitch like that on a pimp team 
 Too $hort: 
 It's after midnight, can't find the right women 
 Can't be slippin while you're late night pimpin' 
 Way too many niggas got stuck like that 
 Waited too late then fucked a rat 
 Wake up in the mornin, mad as hell 
 With the wrong bitch in the wrong hotel 
 Shoulda gave up when you first struck out 
 Now you tryna get the fuck out 
 Be -Legit: 
 Man I was drunk when I went out, blow when I woke up 
 Didn't get to fuck 'cause these hoes is ducks 
 Niggas like me need the head lay on 
 From bad ass bitches who prefer red bones 
 Rock microphones, later count G's 
 Could always spot a rat chasin niggas with cheese 
 Please, put it on freeze, it don't suit me 
 What happened to the muthafuckin groupies? (muthafuckin groupies) 
 Captain Save-A-Hoe: 
 What happened? nigga they all left, that's what happened 
 Y'all muthafuckas gonna be sittin' around all night talkin' to each other 
 Oh that's cool, y'all got some muthafuckin Playboy magazines 
 So I guess that's why y'all ain't trippin', check this out man 
 Y'all niggas gotta understand one thing man 
 Bitches don't love to be talked to like that, y'all gotta break down 
 Be cool with a bitch, ya know what I'm sayin'? 
 Show her some caring and shit, understand me? 
 Verse 3: be -Legit/Too $hort 
 Be -Legit 
 I remember when the shit first began 
 I used to fuck the dog shit out my biggest fans 
 Four in the mornin we hit the waffle spot 
 Then its back to the telly for some more cock 
 Shit was non-stop, don't choose too fast 
 There's a gang of more bitches with way more ass 
 Up and down the hall with the bad-ass body 
 Groupies lookin' for the after party 
 Too $hort: 
 I used to be wild as fuck, get my dick sucked 
 On the back of the tour bus with two or three sluts 
 Check into my suite, order somethin' to eat 
 Knockin' at my door, its another lil freak 
 Right up the hall on the same flo' 
 You could stand in line and run a train on the ho 
 Top-notch or rat, skinny or fat 
 Be -Legit, where all the groupies at? (groupies at) 
 -Legit: 
 In the room with the tricks gettin' big faces 
 But they really want to know how the dick tastes 
 I used to get fucked, fall asleep, wake up 
 Kick the bitch out and bump a freak 
 But nowadays, you gotta watch your route 
 Niggas savin' hoes need to cut that out 
 So what they talkin' bout, they shoulda been done came 
 I think they scared of a nigga with this real game 
 Too $hort: 
 What happened to the groupies, don't point your finger 
 They're all backstage chasin R&B singers 
 At the other concert, on the other side of town 
 I seen a few hoes but they wasn't down 
 Where the groupies at, I'ma ask y'all later 
 Probably out tryna fuck basketball players 
 Silly hoes, rappers got mansions 
 But we ain't tryna get into these tramp bitches 
 Captain Save-A-Hoe: 
 Y'all niggas is trippin' man, 
 Y'all need to sit down and re-evaluate your morals man 
 Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this shit, 
 Y'all gonna be sittin' around in the club 
 Tryna figure out who goin' home with ya old ass 
 You need to find ya a good woman, snatch her up, get her a BMW 
 She got kids, only do what you do, tell her "I got you"
