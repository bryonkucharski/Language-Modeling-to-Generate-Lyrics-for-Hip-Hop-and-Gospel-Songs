 B-Legit: 
 It ain't cell in this town that can hold 
 And fuck the task force 'cause them suckas tried to fold me, scold me 
 Told me if I move that they was blastin 
 Got me to the station, hella questions they be askin 
 Who's the Big Balla, Who supply your crew 
 Who got the big birdies in the box is it you? 
 I never said a word 'cause nigga I don't do so 
 You fools got some question better ask the lawyer Rouseau 
 Kurupt: 
 I'm so international 
 All about my cashional 
 18 million rational (speak mice)??? 
 What you want fool dogg tell me what you need 
 'Bout a couple pints of Hennisse an eighth of weed 
 Seems time gettin' shorter 
 Time to elevate from nickels, dimes up to quarters 
 Kurupt, B-Legit, and 40 water 
 Niggaz oughta 
 Get to Swervin' 
 Take a hit, hit the strip and then get to pervin' 
 E-40: 
 Squa, Squa, Squab music 
 Mobb Music 
 Right on a muthf**ka and draw down on his ass music 
 The 213 the 41510 
 Pull a ho without a muthafuckin tug of war 
 40 Water your playa patna 
 Ever since the womb 
 I been a tycoone 
 Actin' up (Actin' up) 
 Actin' tough (Actin' tough) 
 Actin' bad with all kinds of guns and stuff

 Kurupt: 
 I got a half a ounce 
 And a 'four to bounce 
 Half a brick to flip 
 Large amount accounts 
 Live as a young nigga with loot don't count 
 Live as a young nigga with loot turned out 
 You know it ain't nothing to it but to do it 
 Flow like fluid 
 You's inlcuded 
 Pursue it 
 Subdue it 
 And run through it 
 Doin' what I do is hard to maintain my composure 
 Ah man they came through with no douja 
 B-Legit: 
 The muthf**kin county ain't no place for the savage 
 A Cock hound dank smokin' nigga 'bout his cabbage 
 But if I'm ever caught I'm a ride my shit 
 Divorce my broad 
 But nigga keep my bitch 
 Bury my mail in my momma backyard 
 Steeady poppin' chyme to correctional guards 
 They fucks wit my crew 'cause they claim that we be trouble 
 Them niggaz from the V to the H-I Double 
 I'm tryin' to get this party tonight at this motel 
 A gang a bitches there 
 Some more on my voice mail 
 Bathtub full of the ice and the fifths 
 My homey K-1 rollin' blunts at the crib 
 First I take a hit 
 Strolls like a pimp 
 The muthafuckin savage with the million dollar limp 
 Another big day for this timin ass balla 
 Hit the block stock in my ninety fin impala 
 Let them pipes holla 
 I know I'm looking saucy 
 19 shots sittin' next to my 40 
 Snatch my knot 
 Shake the spot and gets far 
 Bitch, I'm a muthafuckin rap star

 E-40: 
 I open shop with sixteenth of powder to a whole zip 
 To a half ham now I'm sitting kilograms 
 Niggaz 'spect me to the upmost 'cause I'm highly spoken 'bout 
 Niggaz love me because I'm all about my paper route 
 I keep my lawyers and my bail bondsmen paid shiiiit 
 For all I know they might decide to raid shiiiit 
 Back in the day po-po was easily out-smarted 
 But now they got some new and improved state of the art 
 B-Legit: 
 Now it's going down am I living in the past 
 This modern day slavery takin' toll on my ass 
 You either take me in or let's this timer go 
 Or if you got some charges nigga let this timer know 
 I told you I'm a rapper 
 Love to entertain 
 Catch me on the stage with a mic spittin' game 
 Legit's my name and you can even ask your daughter 
 About Kurupt, B-Legit and 40 Water
