Cool beans x alot 
 Rap starts - b-legit 
 Cool beans in the place 
 40 cal in my waist 
 I point it at your face 
 If you really wanna taste 
 6 shots with no chase 
 Invade my space 
 And get your king crowned fuck around with tha ace 
 I blast masks off in that 7-duece cutty 
 Me and my buddies situations get ugly 
 Niggas wanna bug me when gas is on 
 Can't hit what they can't see my mask be on 
 Chitty chitty bang bang 
 Nigga this is block game 
 Move around, hit 'em up, pitch it up like a boomerang 
 Fitted like wolverine, MSU 
 Yellow and dark blue like hub 1 and hub 2 
 Nigga I cut you, you bleed on yo own 
 Go home write a song about how I did you wrong 
 How I drink petron, and blow a lotta green 
 And they's playas on my team like b-la and cool beans
