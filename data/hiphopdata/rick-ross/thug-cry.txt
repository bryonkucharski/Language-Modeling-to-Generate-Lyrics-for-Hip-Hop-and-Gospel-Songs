I just wanna be the one 
 I just wanna be the one you love 
 I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down 
 I just wanna, I just wanna fly 
 I'mma show you tonight 
 That I'mma put it on you baby 
 Take you past the sky... 
 Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga 
 Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers 
 On them corners it gets better as you go 
 Grind that motherfucker till it's yellow brick road 
 Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse 
 On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church 
 Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat 
 I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next? 
 Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job 
 Another country boy they want back on the farm 
 So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids 
 Thug cry for Mac Dre throwin' up the Thizz 
 I just wanna be the one 
 I just wanna be the one you love 
 I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down 
 I just wanna, I just wanna fly 
 I'mma show you tonight 
 That I'mma put it on you baby 
 Take you past the sky... 
 Well let me light one for my problems 
 Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume 
 Get it crackin' like an eggshell in this motherfucker make omelettes 
 Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments 
 They don't know what I been through, don't know what I'm goin' through 
 As long as I get through that's what I look forward to 
 Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to 
 Let these niggas play with me; need to be remorseful 
 I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9 and I kill these niggas with silence 
 My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant 
 Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas 
 Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers, that 
 Ain't a threat that's bet 'cause they coming at my neck 
 Like the best a man can get 
 To make a long story short, I need a shoulder cause the devil on one 
 The other one, I'm lookin' over 
 Tunechi... 
 I just wanna be the one 
 I just wanna be the one you love 
 I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down 
 I just wanna, I just wanna fly 
 I'mma show you tonight 
 That I'mma put it on you baby 
 Take you past the sky... 
 Niggas hatin' like it's Salt Lake City 
 No tints on that pretty ass Bentley 
 Want you to know that them comments don't offend me 
 Cause your baby mama so friendly 
 I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand 
 Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan 
 Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith 
 Double M, we handle business 
 Cause them niggas getting raped 
 Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated 
 200 acres estates, a young nigga made it 
 Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed 
 Still lemon pepper on my motherfucking waaangs 
 I just wanna be the one 
 I just wanna be the one you love 
 I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down 
 I just wanna, I just wanna fly 
 I'mma show you tonight 
 That I'mma put it on you baby 
 Take you past the sky... 
 Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?
