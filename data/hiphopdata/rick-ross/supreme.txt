I just left the New United States, embassy 
 Somewhere in Georgia it's 109 rooms 
 I saw 30 bitches and 30 rooms and I was on the wrong side of the house 
 Anytime me and Scott Scorch get together you gotta call us the Illuminati 
 Whenever you see the G it represents God and geometry 
 That's what the stencil's for 
 I'ma tell you never be with them 
 Nah, I'm just fuckin' with you 
 Aye, Scott, I'm just fuckin' with you, baby 
 Yo 
 Speedin' in the Ghost on the phone with jewlers 
 My new bitch out of D.C., call me Ricky the Ruler 
 Gotta gather my concentration while countin' my stacks 
 I got eight car notes and just lost me a pack 
 On the beach, I'm up and down, women jockin' my ride 
 300 horses in this bitch, need a jockey inside 
 False floors for firearms is how you should ride 
 Tried to murder me while in mine so that's how I survived 
 My deal with Def Jam just set me for life 
 Wanted to chapel the the BM, man, I'm just rollin' the dice 
 Big numbers, I'm John Wall, I'm ballin' tonight 
 Just joking, my sense of humor is like one of a kind 
 Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind 
 Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind 
 Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind 
 Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind 
 Tell me it's real 
 Tell me this is real, baby 
 How does it feel? 
 How does it feel? 
 Geechi Liberace, I'm rich as a bitch 
 Charm city boys get a whole city of brick 
 Through the wire we wettin' niggas, set the shit on fire 
 My bitch smilin' I wanna bet, now we on Fisher Island 
 Panamera with Tony Jacob, BK's full of paper 
 MMde a killin' on Martin Luther James you're a shooter 
 My niggas, we grew apart, they joined the rival gang 
 Caught them slippin', gave them a pass throwin' pistols at survivin' gang 
 Next time boss gotta turn his back on 'em 
 Lettin' young boys *brrrrat* on 'em 
 Facts, never find me with the fake look 
 Trappin' little Davis, bitch, just take me to the cakebook 
 Black bottles, boy, that's how our case of ace look 
 Your chick, homie, hit homie on the Facebook 
 Damn, she hit homie on the motherfuckin' Facebook 
 Tell me it's real, I wanna know 
 How does it feel, yeah, how does it feel? 
 Clean Maybach, but it's filthy as shit 
 They partitionin' for the women, how busy we get 
 From the scotch, the large mop, bet the linking feel 
 It's all a dream and never wake me up until it's real 
 Duffle bags, that's for the homie when he comin' home 
 He never told and he never used the telephone 
 He on swole and that nigga need a telephone 
 In a Range Rover and a real nigga got it for him 
 You wanna know how does it feel 
 I know, I bet it must feel so real 
 Tell me it's real, I wanna know 
 How does it feel to be so real 
 You know when hangin' with billion dollar niggas 
 One of the perks is gettin' to meet all these billion dollar bitches 
 I just met a bitch who never gets jetlag 
 And spent 10 thousand dollars on not her best bag 
 You underdig that
