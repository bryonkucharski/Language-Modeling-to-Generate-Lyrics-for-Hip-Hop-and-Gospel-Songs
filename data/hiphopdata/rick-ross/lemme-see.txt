Usher, baby 
 I hear you, yeah 
 Rock with me 
 Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home 
 Should I take you home? 
 I don't mean to keep you waiting 
 But I just gotta know 
 If you're ready 
 She say she wanna take her skirt off 
 Be my guest 
 I decided to take my shirt off 
 And show my chest 
 And we been sipping on that Merlot 
 So you know what's next 
 The perfect intermission, switching positions 
 We so explicit oh 
 You been saying all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see 
 Girl I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see 
 I'll be anticipating 
 What you would do to me 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Sex babe is the occasion 
 Hands on when you're with me 
 Give your heart to me, yeah 
 She say she wanna take her skirt off 
 Be my guest 
 I decided to take my shirt off 
 And show my chest 
 And we been sipping on that Merlot 
 So you know what's next 
 The perfect intermission, switching positions 
 We so explicit oh 
 You been saying all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see 
 Girl I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Quit talking about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see 
 Got on all my ice, talkin' cash shit 
 Been ballin' all my life, Lamborghinis, fast whips 
 She down to ride and she deserves a boss who's down to provide 
 We run the streets but on G5s, I'm talkin' fly 
 Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, Louis rings 
 You wit' a big boy so we do the big things 
 Had the valet parking, Chanel hoodie on 
 Looking like Trey Von Martin, joys in the mid morning 
 She on my wanted poster, still rocking my Mimosa 
 I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shoppin' in Milan 
 The four fifty-eight Ferrari, I park it on the lawn 
 I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb 
 The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic 
 She my new addition, I swear I'm through it 
 Rosé and Usher Raymond, girl we the hottest 
 Rockin' the most ice, I say we the hottest 
 You been saying it all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see 
 I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Let me see, let me see, let me see
