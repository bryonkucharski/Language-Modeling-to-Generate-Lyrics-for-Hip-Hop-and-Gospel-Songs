(Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 She fell in love with a dope boy 
 Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy 
 Big body Benz for that dope boy 
 Love every tattoo on that dope boy 
 She sheds tears for that dope boy 
 Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy 
 Handle minor biz for that dope boy 
 But the reward is major, so on and so forth 
 She can tell you by the Greyhound 
 She can show you how to stay down 
 I can tell you 'bout to break down 
 VS1's all in my bitch watch face now 
 Straight G's for your low esteem 
 A.P's for the whole team 
 As I run away from my obituary 
 Walking in the shit that'll get you buried 
 Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley 
 Baselines shoot at niggas, act wisely 
 Get the picture, niggas getting richer now 
 Living next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle 
 Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa 
 Come to the coca, callate la boca 
 They let shit slide when my nigga won't 
 Remember God forgives and them triggers don't 
 (Hook: Omarion) 
 Aw baby it's just how it goes 
 Can't feel it but I know you know 
 'Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl 
 And I keep it on the outside of you, girl 
 And I'm reaping just what I sow 
 My heart's beating but it still stay froze 
 And y'all waiting on the inside for me, girl 
 And y'all waiting on the inside for me, girl 
 Arms wide open 
 (It's warm in here) 
 She fell in love with the lifestyle 
 Paper tag now her neck all iced out 
 Lear jets to the fights now 
 Belagio crap table with the dice out 
 Floor seats at the Heat game 
 Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game 
 South beach making love on the rooftop 
 Fucking to the rhythm, got her singing like she Jill Scott 
 I'm just a nigga with a attitude 
 Earning revenue through different avenues 
 One of my soldiers died in Attica 
 Anything other than a ride is out of character 
 Top down and it feels right 
 I could tell you what a dope boy feels like 
 I could tell you that he never sleeps 
 He may smile but it's never sweet 
 Swisha burning at his fingertips 
 Tears on the inside but they never drip 
 God forgives and the courts don't 
 Seeking an appeal when the courts won't
