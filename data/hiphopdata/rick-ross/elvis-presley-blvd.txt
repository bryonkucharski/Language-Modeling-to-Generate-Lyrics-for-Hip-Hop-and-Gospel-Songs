(Intro: Rick Ross) 
 Hood Billionaire 
 Nigga need that quinine 
 I'm making more with the baking soda, don't hate on me 
 You know where I'm at though 
 (Hook 1: Rick Ross) 
 I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
 I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
 Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard 
 You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs 
 (Hook 2: Rick Ross) 
 I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
 Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
 Got the boy, got the girl and I got the heart 
 Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs 
 I got Priscilla, I got Priscilla 
 I got vanilla, boy, I got vanilla 
 I been that nigga, I been that nigga 
 I bend that corner, I'm stacking scrilla 
 My face familiar, my face familiar 
 Half a milli for the whip, this bitch'll hurt your feelings 
 I could fly Priscilla, send her in the mail 
 She got Meek Milly cellphone in the county jail 
 I'm at the car wash off on Elvis Presley BLVD 
 That nina hit your van, your ass gon' holla 
 good God 
 You feel that itch, you feel that itch 
 That heroin moving fast, boy, I'm getting rich 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Run up in the trap, I push the panic button 
 Lil' 'Toine snorting coke, he ain't scared of nothing 
 Bumping Playa Fly until a player die 
 Charged 'em for the nine gram, but I gave 'em five 
 My baking soda fine, I'm baking over dimes 
 I got them brown bags, I bet they know it's mine 
 I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
 Can I park an airplane in a nigga yard? 
 (Verse 4: Project Pat) 
 Crushing them sleepin' pills up, I'm steppin' on the dawg 
 Bringing down a half a thing, mane, get these puppies off 
 Hard work pays off, get more if you selling soft 
 Catch you slipping out here though, my dog, we knock your melon off 
 They cannot stunt, shoot them rifles long like African 
 Got them young boys shooting shit up like Africans 
 Me gold in me mouth, 'round my neck like leprechaun 
 Lamborghini or Ferrari, watch these bitches come 
 Stacking funds off the drugs, me go quick to rob the clubs 
 Nigga mouth was full of slugs, left these bodies full of slugs 
 Met me on the south side of the city with the whole thing 
 Iced 'em with the heater, took his shit, it's a cold game 
 His niggas know I done it, now it's rumors they want my head 
 Got my Russian bitch sleeping with me right in the bed 
 My niggas killing about this shit, for realling about this shit 
 Fuck around and get a hundred years, dawg, about this shit
