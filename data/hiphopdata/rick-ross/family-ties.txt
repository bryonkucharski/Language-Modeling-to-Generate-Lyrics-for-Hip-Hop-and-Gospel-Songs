Some things you have to see for yourself 
 Francis Ford, fuckin' with them hoes 
 You niggas still can't afford 
 Made so many mistakes I know that my niggas relate 
 Just to rattle my cage, so much shit they sat on my plate 
 She know me through records, but she don't know me too well 
 All this game is for sale was priceless, I keep for myself 
 Shots fired, man expired in his Jordan 3's 
 Small talk, turn that page, that's all they ever read 
 You graduated, you still unemployed 
 Taken for granted, love is null and void 
 No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes 
 Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues 
 Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni 
 Your paper chasin', can't see that it's runnin' from you 
 My homies from the block, they labeled me cunnin' 
 No excuse for my success, so they say I'm Masonic 
 I keep it one hundred, fuck her, I keep the car runnin' 
 How she fuck on the back, that's to keep food on the stomach 
 Look at me, look at me 
 Realest shit you niggas ever seen 
 Look at me, look at me 
 Look at me, look at me 
 Playin' for keeps, and that's just to say at the least 
 Had a few seizures, nigga refused to get me some sleep 
 I let shit slide, I should see the sparks 
 Now I think about my moms when I jot these songs 
 I think of certain niggas when I mention guns 
 Heavy artillery, death to enemies number one 
 Francis Ford, flows you niggas can't ignore 
 Shoppin' with them hoes you niggas can't afford 
 Bellaire Rose, they thought I'd go gold, wouldn't sell anything more 
 They thought I'd fail, they thought I'd fold 
 Go to hell, any nigga wanna buy my soul 
 Double-M, extend my hand, I see you stumblin' 
 Francis Ford films budget, double-forty M's 
 Godfather money, filmin' part four again 
 Butterball, Magic City, so you know it's him, me 
 I blaze J's, fuck the Dutch slave trade 
 Fuck a net worth when I'm just trynna maintain 
 Tennessee, I felt like Mr. Wendal, nigga 
 When ain't nobody starin' out that window with you 
 Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated 
 Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas 
 It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture 
 Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figuers 
 Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I 
 Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial 
 But I see the gems, I see the stars 
 Diabetes and all, your name will carry on 
 I pray this legacy is what is left of me 
 Corporate cannabis givin' me leprosy 
 Look at me, look at me 
 Double-M, fuckin' G
