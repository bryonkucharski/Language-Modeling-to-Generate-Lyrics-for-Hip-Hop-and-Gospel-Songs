I think a nigga phone tapped 
 Wanna give me time for my old raps 
 Indict me for my own raps 
 I think a nigga phone tapped 
 I think a nigga phone tapped 
 If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped 
 My phone tapped 
 Got a feelin' that my phone tapped 
 18 nigga wildin', trafficin' with a pilot 
 Crazy net worth, Miami bred the tyrants 
 First day of trial, courtroom was silent 
 Till the wiretap replayed back the dialect 
 Had tears in my eyes as you took your oath 
 Sweaty palms have on niggas who be touchin' dope 
 Open the doors, smell the Pyrex in the air 
 I'm dealin' raw, D-boys so debonair 
 In the barber shop, it's known that I can sell a pair 
 Count to forty-five before that man could shave his head 
 Pistol underneath the apron as I'm in the chair 
 Raise it to my neck, I tip a hundred for the beard 
 My right hand, I knew him since fourth grade 
 '88, afros with no fades 
 Fist fights, the box Chevys on blades 
 Chief all they gave us the rules to play 
 They trynna paint a picture of a hungry nigga 
 Another lion runnin' in the jungle with us 
 Told the bitches we was brothers, shared the same people 
 Introduce you to my mother, made sure you eatin' 
 Now you hangin' out with different people on the weekend 
 Quotin' different numbers nigga, like I wouldn't peep it 
 If it's war, here come murder, cause that come the cheapest 
 Call me on my sister phone, keep it on some G shit 
 Niggas tellin' cause the jealous, look at what I'm wearin' 
 They want me in the prison when I'm just apparent 
 Quarter million in Atlanta, boy I had some talent 
 Throw a stack in Magic City, make a hater panic 
 305 nigga, ridin' in the Chevy 
 Count a half a milli in a couple seconds 
 Fuck two bitches then I want seconds 
 Richest nigga in the city, boy I broke some records 
 Puttin' spinners on your cars, suspendin' on the smoke 
 What your spendin' on your home, spendin' on the boat 
 Everybody watchin', everybody tellin' 
 When your days numbered, nigga, cherish every second
