God forgives... I don't 
 In other words, retaliation is a must! 
 (Gun sounds) 
 I bow my head, I pray to God 
 Survival of the fittest: help me hold my chopper lord! 
 If I die today, on the highway to heaven 
 Can I let my top down in my 911? 
 In my 911? 
 In my 911? 
 In my 911? 
 In my 911? 
 Financial fanatic, 40 bricks in my attic 
 400K in my baggage, 80 round automatic 
 You can't stop a bullet, this one for the money 
 Secret indictments, Porsche costs me 200 
 Fuck all these broke niggas cause all I do is ball 
 Ain't no more off days, my crib look like a mall 
 Fired the stylist, went and bought a big and tall 
 Niggas still scheming, but we sliding on 'em all! 
 I remember picking watermelons 
 Now the Porsche cost me a quarter million! 
 If I die tonight I know I'm coming back nigga 
 Reincarnated: big black fat nigga! 
 Fuck your investigation, started my elevation 
 Cherry red 911 straight to my destination 
 Mayweather got a fight, make me some reservations 
 Knew I flew private nigga, strapped with no hesitations 
 Gucci Pucci money long, he got 20 cars 
 Graduated from them blocks, now it's stocks and bonds 
 Hoes wanna know, hoes wanna show 
 They know a nigga's name, they know a nigga's strong 
 Fuck wit me! 
 Fuck your insinuation, work come from Venezuela 
 Love me some skinny bitches, fat boy just 'bout his paper 
 Hustle while niggas gossip, hating, that switch the topic 
 Jump in my 911, 2 bricks in my compartment! 
 She let me smell her pussy! 
 I know you smell the money! 
 Still smell the gunpowder 
 911: 100 miles and running
