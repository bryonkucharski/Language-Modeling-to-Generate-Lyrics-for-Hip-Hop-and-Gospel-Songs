Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone 
 Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone 
 Stretch limousine sippin' Rose all along 
 Double-headed monster with a mind of his own 
 Cherry red chariot excess is just my character 
 All black tux nigga the shoes lavender 
 I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders 
 Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired 
 Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder 
 We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter 
 Uh hater talkin' never made me mad 
 Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag 
 Therefore G4s at the Clearport 
 When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy 
 When it came to dope I was quick to export 
 Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport 
 New Mercedes sedan they'll export 
 So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud 
 Different traps I was gettin' mail from 
 Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne 
 Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms 
 Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns 
 I shed a tear before the nights over 
 God bless the man I put this ice over 
 Gettin' 2Pac money twice over 
 Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater dice roller 
 I'm makin' love to the angel of death 
 Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps
