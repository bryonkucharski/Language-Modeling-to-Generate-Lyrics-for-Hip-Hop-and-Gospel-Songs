(Verse 1: Rick Ro$$) 
 I needs a real bitch, 365 
 Let her count the cheese let her see the pies 
 Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond 
 She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond 
 All the death threats 'cause I owed niggas 
 She told me get rest, those are hoe niggas 
 That's a real bitch she had to show niggas 
 'Cause I was blind to the fact she was a hoe, nigga 
 I'm countin' dough, nigga she'll double count 
 Somethin' come up short she'll point it out 
 Niggas try to holla she'll point it out 
 She'll catch a flight she'll run a route. 
 [Hook: Rick Ro$$] + (Ebony Love) 
 We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some.

 (Verse 2: Rick Ro$$) 
 She a real bitch so she gotta stunt 
 She get her weave done at least 5 times a month 
 She don't call 'em purses, bitch call 'em bags 
 I don't know the names I know they cost some stacks 
 She deserves this she serves her purpose 
 She saves her juice box till it looks perfect 
 Fuck the Aston Mar, fuck wit a astronaut 
 I'm in the gulf stream nuts in my ashy watch 
 I needs a real bitch, I needs a real bitch 
 Ass like Trina and the brains is the business 
 I needs a real bitch she get you what you need 
 She get you what you want she'll even roll your...

 We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some.

 (Verse 3: Rick Ro$$) 
 I needs a real bitch 365 
 Let her count the cheese can't believe her eyes 
 Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond 
 She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond 
 Cop the big range let her move in it 
 The condo round the corner with all the tools in it 
 Take her 2 minutes she'll be there and back 
 So when you see that pretty face you better lay it flat.
