Walk with a real nigga 
 Self-made millionaire 
 What more could you ask for, huh? 
 I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati 
 I'm a John Gotti, got my own army 
 Worth fifty million and it's all on me 
 Fifty on my Rollie knowing yours phony 
 Last problem I had, a nigga head-shot him 
 Say the word on the street is that my man got him 
 If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him 
 I got Lears and all, don't need Aaliyah problems 
 May she rest her soul, I got a sleeping problem 
 All my CDs gold but the Visa darker 
 Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars 
 Double-M G this little thing of ours 
 Take it to the door, motherfucker, plea 
 Niggas layin' on your crib while your momma sleep 
 Home-cooked meals for the real niggas 
 Hot Tec 9 for you little niggas 
 Want to shoplift? Come and boost this 
 We run the fucking game, nigga, truth is 
 Cargo pants and my red bottoms 
 Talking 'bout birds you know the boy got 'em 
 No clothes in the closet, it's all birds 
 No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds 
 No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds 
 And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first 
 Anything you need know I get it cheap 
 My nigga Rozay makes millions while he can't sleep 
 Cars European come and see the fleet 
 We're commercial; come and see us if you need the street 
 I'ma bring it home nigga bet the bank 
 Sierra Leone all up in the link 
 'Bout to double up, some Mason Betha shit 
 Huddle up, round table, King Arthur shit 
 Shorty ass fat, she can't stand straight 
 Spent your down payment on my landscape 
 Niggas sideways like the Phantom door 
 Hundred round drum sound like round of applause 
 Slicker than a can of grease 
 Paid the state in the ice, hundred grand a piece 
 Coke, boy, I'll be thirty for sure now 
 Coke damn near same price as dope now 
 No clothes in the closet, it's all birds 
 No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds 
 No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds 
 And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first
