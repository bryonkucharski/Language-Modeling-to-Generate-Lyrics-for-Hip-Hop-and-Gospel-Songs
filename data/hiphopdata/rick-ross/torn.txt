A part of me wanna stay and chill 
 With you 'cause I feel it's real 
 But when you start trippin' 
 I can't stay girl I'm out of here 
 See all that fussin' up in my ear 
 Gone make me just disappear 
 Part of me wanna mess around 
 Part of me wanna keep it real 
 Part of me wanna hold you close 
 And love you from head to toe 
 Part of me wanna change my mind 
 Say fuck it just let it go 
 Cause all that trippin' you doin' 
 Is ruinin' everything that I had in mind on pursuing 
 I need to get my mind straight so we stay separate 
 If so you can be replaced, if so you can be replaced 
 I need to get my mind straight so we stay separate 
 If so you can be replaced, if so you can be replaced 
 Holla! 
 A part of me wants to leave you alone 
 A part of me wants for you to come home 
 A part of me says I'm livin' a lie 
 And I'm better off without you (C'mon Toya) 
 A part of me says to think it through 
 A part of me says I'm over you 
 A part of me wants to say goodbye 
 A part of me is asking why 
 A part of me wants to leave 
 But a part of me wants to be here with you 
 And every time I think that we're over and done 
 You do something that get me back lovin' you (All the lady say) 
 And you got me just torn 
 Torn in between the two 
 'Cause I really wanna be with you 
 But something is telling me that I should leave 
 You alone, leave you alone, leave you alone 
 And you got me just torn in between the two 
 'Cause I really wanna be with you 
 But something is telling me that I should leave 
 You alone, leave you alone, leave you alone 
 What hurts the most is when we started out 
 It was cool it was everything that love's about 
 But something happened 
 'Cause I'm feeling so burned out 
 Because I can't understand you now 
 I just can't understand you now 
 A part of me says it's all my fault 
 A part of me says it ain't what you want 
 A part of me says to get my bags 
 A part of me says I can't do that 
 A part of me wants to leave 
 But a part of me wants to be here with you 
 And every time I think that it's over and done 
 You make me fall back in love 
 You got me just torn

 I met her like a month ago, South Beach bungalow 
 We rollin' in that white thang, I'm rolling up one of those 
 She lookin' like my wife thang, boy I need one of those 
 Girl it's not a slice thang, ask 'bout me runnin' 
 My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind 
 But when I got you in my lap, we be far from killing time 
 And they say that opposites attract, but we both on our grind 
 I love to touch you from the back, tell what's up and never mind

 Tell me how bad, how bad do you want me? 
 'Cause I don't know if I should stay or I should leave 
 How bad, tell me how bad do you want me? 
 'Cause I don't know if I should stay or I should leave 
 How bad, tell me how bad do you want me? 
 'Cause I don't know if I should stay or I should leave 
 How bad, tell me how bad do you want me? 
 'Cause I don't know if I should stay or I should leave 
 Huh huh 
 I'm torn
