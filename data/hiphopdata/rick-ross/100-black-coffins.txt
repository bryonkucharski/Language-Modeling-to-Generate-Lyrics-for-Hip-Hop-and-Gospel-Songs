Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger 
 You gotta listen to your boss white boy 
 Oh I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you 
 You wanna hold my hand? 
 I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men 
 A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in 
 I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell 
 From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!) 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!) 
 Black coffins! (I need a hundred) 
 I seen a hundred niggas die 
 I put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn't tell a lie 
 Unless it had to do with mine in the middle of the night 
 Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine? 
 I broke off the chains only the realest remain 
 I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain? 
 Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change 
 Yet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Kane 
 Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house 
 A lotta scars on my back, get tattoos all around 
 Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins 
 Money on his head, bitch, I'm trying to make a fortune 
 I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men 
 A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in 
 I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell 
 From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!) 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!) 
 Black coffins! (I need a hundred) 
 I seen a hundred women burn 
 As they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ 
 What did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm 
 Pigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm 
 Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Jack Django 
 Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal 
 All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!) 
 On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer 
 Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch 'cause I'm coming 
 Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!) 
 Hundred dead bitches, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?) 
 12 gauge, shotgun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom) 
 I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men 
 A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in 
 I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell 
 From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!) 
 I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!) 
 Black coffins! (I need a hundred)
