(Intro - Rick Ross) 
 Regardless of how it goes down 
 Life goes on 
 Am I right? 
 (Hook - John Legend) 
 On the way we shed some tears 
 Every day we sacrifice 
 So we can be standing here 
 Oh what a hell of a life 
 Been winning so many years 
 And the future is bright 
 Now it's very clear 
 That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever 
 We gon' be rich forever 
 We gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever 
 (Verse 1 - Rick Ross) 
 I remember being blind to it 
 Till the day I put my mind to it 
 Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it 
 I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it 
 Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it? 
 Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent 
 Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin' 
 Back of the phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student 
 Grandfather deal for the Godfather 
 Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders 
 And he told me I was rich forever 
 And he showed me I was rich forever 
 They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank 
 Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks 
 Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape 
 RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade 
 White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at 
 Count a million cash, can you blog that? 
 Me and my niggas your type never exchange numbers 
 Want to conversate and steal game from us 
 See the watch, now you want to know the name of it 
 Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded 
 Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen 
 Your shit pushed back 'cause it ain't buzzin' 
 Now these thugs actors all of a sudden 
 Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden 
 Can't talk snow, where the soft at 
 Your man got murked, but you squashed that 
 Hope you know what we call that 
 I think you know just what we call that 
 All you pussy boys fall back 
 Big face Rollie, rose gold cost 40 
 Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty 
 You only live once I'm screaming YOLO in the VI 
 Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I 
 Ciroc, no glass, smiling women in my presence 
 Tall supermodels always fall in my possession 
 Atlanta housewives taking pictures in my section 
 But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression 
 Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves 
 Rich forever in my D-Boy ways 
 So dope, blue jeans, new J's 
 Sold dope by any means all day 
 (Hook - John Legend) 
 Been winning so many years 
 And the future is bright 
 Now it's very clear 
 That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever 
 We gon' be rich forever 
 (Verse 2 - Rick Ross) 
 100 mil ain't enough 
 Got 100 women, gotta deal with it, love 
 Worth 40 m's is he still dealing drugs 
 Cigarette speedboats, but he's still with the thugs 
 Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday 
 Grinding, even be legit one day 
 Order some more bottles because I'm on one 
 I know her pussy wet, and she wanna cum 
 She wanna cum, maybe come over 
 Stop dealing with them niggas you need one soldier 
 Keep you as my bitch forever 
 'Cause you know a nigga rich forever
