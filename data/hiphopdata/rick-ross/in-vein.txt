I don't got a single sober vein in my body 
 I don't got a single sober vein in my body 
 Don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy 
 I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy 
 And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy 
 So ride it out for me, and take it off for me 
 It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe 
 Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time 
 She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it 
 But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide 
 Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it 
 Private elevator goin' straight to my unit 
 All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy 
 All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy 
 Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless 
 Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is 
 Tour bus like a National Geographic 
 Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom 
 It makes me smile, it makes me smile 
 'Cause I got it 
 It makes me smile, it makes me smile 
 'Cause I got it 
 All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece 
 But now we got it 
 Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me 
 I don't got a single sober vein in my body 
 Fuck it like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari 
 Old money, I just 'fraid the lord with us 
 Condo blow money, like it's all dope money 
 Come short wet niggas, like a speed boat coming, oh lord 
 Mo money, mo money, these rich young niggas ain't ever know money 
 Bel-Air running down the Rollie on her arm 
 Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it 
 I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield 
 Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib 
 25 mil, I'm doing 25-to-life 
 100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night 
 Every chandelier rented, one-mil 
 20 chandelier's moterfucker who real 
 I just wanna show her what I live like 
 Wearing a white burqa on a winter night 
 Fuck a burqa now she in the Bentley 
 That's when she went and tatted double M G 
 Now I ballin' deep, deeper than the rap 
 She give me brain she a mastermind to be exact 
 I give her game and she give it back 
 Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more 
 Gotta grind till your eyes close, stay strapped till the trap close 
 They scream Maybach on the cell blocks 
 All my dogs who used to sell Glocks 
 They say the niggas in the jail talk 
 How your homies commissary fell off, what make it worse he get an elbows 
 25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone 
 It makes me smile, it makes me smile 
 'Cause I got it 
 It makes me smile, it makes me smile 
 'Cause I got it 
 All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece 
 But now we got it 
 Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me 
 I don't got a single sober vein in my body
