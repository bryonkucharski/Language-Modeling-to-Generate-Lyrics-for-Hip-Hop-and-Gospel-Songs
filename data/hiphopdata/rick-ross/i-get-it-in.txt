Yeah, na, na, na, na 
 Yeah, na, na, na, na 
 Now me, I'm the life of the party 
 A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin 
 A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose 
 Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in 
 Now me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Now me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Look as soon as I step in the club 
 I swear, my nigga, you can feel the attention shift 
 Started around twelve, ended up around two 
 I better leave with more hoes than I came here with 
 I can't be responsible for what I say 
 Or I do when I talk intoxicated 
 Shorty say I told her I love her 
 I put her out the next mornin' 
 Sayin' bitch I must have been faded 
 I don't know what you heard about me 
 But the word about me is that I'm no trick 
 I'm no sucker, I'm no chump 
 I be in the VIP with my niggaz 'round me 
 Sayin' y'all can have whatever you want 
 Me, I get it in, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday 
 That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in 
 I need a drink, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink 
 I hate to say I told you so 
 But I told you so, I go hard when it's time to play 
 Shorty get to droppin' it low 
 Like the dancers do in the Go Go in front of me 
 She know I like to see her dance 
 She get to breakin' it down, we get the bouncin' outta control 
 Because I got a hell of a flow 
 We got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore 
 It's no secret the hood done peeped it 
 When we come through, son, we look like bread 
 My '89 grind make my old nine shine 
 Like we been movin' bricks 'round this bitch for years 
 I say, I get it in it's because I get it in 
 Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten 
 I finna spend my G, she fuck with me, I'm in to win 
 I'm cooler than her ma, then we do this shit again 
 Me, I get it in Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday 
 That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in 
 I need a drink, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, give me a drink 
 I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink 
 Na, na, na, na, now me, I'm the life of the party 
 A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin 
 A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose 
 Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in 
 Now me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Now me, I get it in, I get it in 
 Me, I get it in, I get it in
