Hey dog, we always been self made men you feel me? So you know what I'm sayin', Ross could stand on his own you feel me? So just keep goin' dog hit that billionaire status. And you know when I get there dog, you know what I'm sayin', we're gonna sit back and eat fish dinners. No crab meat, you know what I mean? 
 (Hook: Big KRIT) 
 I say lord, lord lord lord lord 
 I pray I don't be here 
 When it all goes down, when it all goes down 
 I say lord, lord lord lord lord 
 I pray I don't be here 
 When it all goes down, when it all goes down 
 There'll be hard times, and then song 
 Fire, and brimstones 
 Devil world from which you came 
 I pray that God will know my name 
 There'll be hard times, and then songs 
 Fire, and brimstones 
 Devil world from which you came 
 I pray that God will know my name 
 I say lord, lord lord lord lord 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Lord lord lord lord 
 I remember hard times always found a way to smile 
 It was quiet, Christmas time, no pretty lights around the house 
 They told me I was loud, didn't fit into they crowd 
 Mama need a spouse, Daddy always in and out 
 Age 15 so the caged bird sings 
 One year later seen a straight bird clean 
 All glitters ain't gold 
 These evil niggas prayin' for your soul 
 Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth 
 Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say church 
 (Hook 2: Big KRIT) 
 Lord, lord lord lord lord 
 I pray I don't be here 
 When it all goes down, when it all goes down 
 There'll be hard times, and then songs 
 Fire, and brimstones 
 Devil world from which you came 
 I pray that God will know my name 
 I say lord, lord lord lord lord 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Lord lord lord lord 
 I'm sittin' in the trap and now done did it with the best 
 Pull a double shift its time to get your boy some rest 
 Money on my mind, alcohol on my breath 
 On the road to riches as I stumble every step 
 Gold on my arm, gold on my neck 
 But what's in my heart I will cherish till the death 
 Same rainy days, but things never change 
 Prayin' to my maker just to take away this pain 
 Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth 
 Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say church

 And I'd love to see that movie man, I know your only gonna get bigger. You know so, when y'all see me in the pictures on the yacht though, when I'm lookin' at the pictures on the yacht and I'm seein' my homies on yachts that they own you know what I mean? It's like okay, this what the movies been about from day one. You know a lot of times people misinterpret it, as far as the Carol City Cartel, the [?] and think it was just violence. It wasn't never about violence, it was all about survival and gettin' that position. So now, you know this the platform we had to use - this call is from a federal prison - now dudes get in position and we love that position because we love to win. And we gonna continue to win, as long as we breathin'. You know what I'm sayin'? And our kids gon' win, and they kids gon' win because this what its bout'. You know what I mean? So you already know fam, the big homie, its just, you know what I'm sayin', a product of his environment who used his environment to get in position and if a person don't like that then they don't like success dog. Because, you know, we ain't gon' never stop. You know, and that's what I like about Rick Ross and all his music - beep beep - picture with words. Tell everybody I send my love man, and Carol City [?] for live dog. Carol City Cartel too, you hear me?
