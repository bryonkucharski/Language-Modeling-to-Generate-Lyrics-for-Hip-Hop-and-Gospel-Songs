 Kilo in the kitchen, pussy niggas Merry Christmas 
 Bitches taking pictures 'cause we keep on getting richer 
 Say a nigga name you know you fucking with them killers 
 Walking through the club only salute the real niggas 
 Ain't no bottles on your table, pussy boy go get your gwolla 
 Hoes don't credit pussy so you can't pay her tomorrow 
 Bitch just bought a house she can't afford to run her mouth 
 I run all these fields, I run the game, not just the South 
 Bow down to the biggest, Belaire I be spilling 
 Counting all this paper, no games with these pussy niggas 
 Double M, we poppin', shoppin' buying new clothes 
 Heard your shit keep flopping and your crib got foreclosed

 Can't play no games with these lames, I'm getting money like Tony 
 Three chains on my neck these bitches brushin' up on it 
 Hundred grand on my watch, you don't feel me then fuck 'em 
 If you playin' with work, we either feed 'em or touch 'em 
 I play no games with these hoes, get a ticket a show 
 Fed follow a nigga like it's a brick at a show 
 VIP choppa, Rollie be matchin' 
 Ho know we fuckin', so don't even ask em 
 I play no games at the bar, all I see is Ciroc 
 Three bottles for Diddy, three hoes in the car 
 No love for these skeezers, we party and fuck 'em 
 Every day is a party so every day we like fuck 'em

 Niggas sellin' dope just tryin' to come up in the game 
 Say it's for the fam but spendin' a hundred on the chain 
 Niggas go for self when they caught up in the fame 
 Run back to a nigga when them shots get to sprayin' 
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! 
 Now we holdin' hands 
 Success another gamble, bitch I took a chance 
 Jumped straight off the porch, jumped right in the kitchen 
 Then I got a Porsche, my bitch wanted a Bentley
