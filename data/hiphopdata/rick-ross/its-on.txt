(Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 You know I speak from my heart like my mouth in my chest 
 It's the South the the West 
 Suave house at its best 
 Went from crumbs to brick (lay down), the other shit 
 Respect the game (Jiggolo) behind the Southern hits 
 The fam type [?] still light shit down 
 No [?] cartel Tef, white wrist now 
 Funny shape ice (uh), my money made twice 
 Still pull guns [?] holes, roller blade dice 
 Still flip ones rise spokes, razer blade white 
 Still walk blocks, call shots, I'm livin' that life 
 I'm the future of the south, isn't that nice 
 [?] Soul, I'm shipping that twice 
 I plan to call your names, when I'm giving them right 
 I'm a little more vocal on the internet site 
 Until then, I'm living 
 Cock sucked on the yacht 
 Hot scotch rolling rocks 
 Time to sing the hook c'mon 
 (Hook: Jiggolo 2x) 
 It's On, it's on 
 We here (we here) 
 Nothin' to lose (nope) 
 No fear (no fear) 
 Still standing, they can't stand it 
 Suave house too bitch that's my family 
 (Verse 2: Noah) 
 The Suave house booted out all the shisty thieves 
 Now it's just icey sleeves and nice MCs 
 The youngest in the pack, still running with the pack 
 You know shining bird bath stil pumping in the lack 
 Where you want these slugs, in the stomach or the back 
 Bad contracts but I'm still coming for a plaque 
 I suggest y'all niggas start covering your hat 
 Ross climbing through the front, I'm covering the back 
 Cover with the black, bubbling the crack 
 Hustling at that, [?] with the rats 
 Slugging for the scratch and the bucket 
 Puffin on batch, where my hustlas at 
 Noah, the ladies remember the dimples 
 Puttin' nipples on the windows, of the Limos 
 Climb through the sunroof, y'all niggas want who 
 Give me another bad bitch that I can run through 
 The [?] to representing 
 Fuck y'all say the hook 
 (Hook: Jiggolo) 
 (Verse 3: Jiggolo) 
 There's, nobody fly, Nodoby hotter so 
 It's only right I hold the torch and I provide the dope 
 I get to 'em raw, like the pure coke 
 Turn me up and hear me bubble like that baking soda 
 Uh, but niggas they scared of it 
 They close but can't see me like some impaired cousins 
 Blind to the fact that nigga I'm buzzing 
 My whole clique with me and niggas I met up 
 With one click, and one aim 
 We get bread, and we fuck dames 
 You can, play with us if you wanna 
 Try us like a pussy and you sure to be a gonner 
 A bitch with me and the chicks stay on one 
 But sex free to watch her do the Jackie Joyner 
 Curse he, curse me but hurt me never 
 Chevy same color Hershey heavy on the pedal 
 (Hook: Jiggolo)
