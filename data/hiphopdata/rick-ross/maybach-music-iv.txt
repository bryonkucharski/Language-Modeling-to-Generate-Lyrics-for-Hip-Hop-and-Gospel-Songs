Yeah, no finales around here, baby 
 No finales 
 Yeah, such a breath of fresh air 
 Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear 
 Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year 
 Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear 
 Count new money, peeling out a venue 
 New Maybach after it was discontinued 
 Never question mine, my mind is so inventive 
 Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives 
 Maybach IV the allure that I adore 
 All money game, we got ones in the floor 
 See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game 
 Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames 
 Bow to the boss in the presence of a don 
 Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin 
 Playing my position for a club that I can join 
 Never in the draft, but that boy know he going 
 Throw me a bone, get me a brick 
 That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips 
 Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch 
 She's showing some potential, so we taking trips 
 Nigga, assets last while memories fade 
 I'mma bust that ass, I don't get paid 
 I'm a Mike Tyson type of typewriter sniper 
 Double M life till a nigga pay the piper 
 I love when the beat dip 
 Same way I love to see a key flip 
 Go and pay your mama house off 
 Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off 
 I'm alive, you could never write the South off 
 South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw 
 Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth boi 
 Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw 
 Pulling up slow, look at that boy 
 Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour 
 Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me 
 All the g's with me, Maybach Eazy-E 
 The good times don't last long 
 Just rewind the last song 
 We all shared some great times 
 As I read some great rhymes 
 (Ne-Yo) 
 What we does, is what dreams are made of 
 Come and get your love, all of this love 
 500 for the car that I got on the strip 
 That's another 100, what I got on my wrist 
 800 for the jar that I'm about to twist 
 It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch 
 As I get high, move my curtains to the side 
 Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die 
 Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State 
 Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate 
 (Ne-Yo) 
 Dreams, everything that we are 
 The life that we're living, baby it's ours 
 Dreams, money, homes, and cars 
 Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy 
 Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooh, oh 
 Baby come with me and live the dream 
 It's a whole nother different element 
 It's Maybach roman numeral four 
 You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this 
 You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 You'll be making it come true 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 You'll be making it come true 
 I'll be dreaming of you 
 (LA Reid) 
 Yessir 
 This is LA Reid 
 It takes a boss to know a boss 
 It takes greatness to recognize greatness 
 Ricky Ross, the boss, Maybach IV
