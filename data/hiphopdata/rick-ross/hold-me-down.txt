If you ridin' with your female acquaintance, explain this one to her girl 
 When you wake up in the mornin' go mail your man some pictures and a 20 dollar money order 
 I gotta tell you somethin' else though 
 I remember the days when I used to jack my dick 
 And had to catch a bus, to go check a flick 
 Unless it was one of those nights I stole my sisters car 
 I brought it back on empty, simply didn't give a fuck 
 Be my guest you can call my mom 
 She's the one who gave me the nickname Teflon [?] 
 Added the don 
 Impressed by the way I kept calm when searched by cops with boy in my palm 
 Shit, I've done see a lot 
 I might crack a smile, but I'll clean your clock 
 I done did it before, matter of fact done it for free 
 If [?] was free, he would of did it for me 
 Guns spittin' for me, Better go get it from me 
 Guess that 10 year sentence wasn't fitted for me 
 But when your released, I got a few gifts for you 
 Half my record label, a quarter mill on the table 
 How many niggas you rode with will hold you down if you go to jail 
 Or put the Benz' up for your bail 
 Yeah, 'cause if its fair it war when them riders start runnin' 
 Will they have to start gunnin' 
 In God's name, free your pain 
 Sinc he was down, Carol City ain't been the same 
 Seventeen years old, floatin' on gold things 
 The same pain was my nigga [?] 
 He might buy you a sack, and let you blow the whole thing 
 And he might get you some head, won't even know the hoes name 
 God damn, I miss my nigga 
 To be honest I wanna kiss my nigga 
 Hug my nigga, talk to my nigga 
 Kick the prison door in and walk with my nigga 
 I'll stalk your nigga, chalk your nigga 
 If I thought your nigga was a cop oh nigga 
 Working for the cops came in for the talk oh nigga 
 If somebody finna' snitch, stop your nigga 
 If I spot your nigga, I gotta pop your nigga 
 I ain't aiming at his legs but at the top of your head 
 Being a black male in America is a charge 
 Pullin' together your family when your brother behind bars 
 Fantasy of nice car, wanna know who we are? 
 All I say to the crackers is "bitch I got a job" 
 No I'm lying, But I'm talking about a - 
 Would of rather, seen 'em scatter 
 Chit chatter, my pockets fatter 
 Fuck your corporate ladder 
 Bein' intelligent today is a dagger 
 Look em' in the eyes whenever you speak 
 Make em' feel you were that close to gettin' a degree 
 I already want a reason to kick your ass to sleep 
 And they know these employees are far from bein' cheap 
 I was raised in these streets 
 Still one of the coolest cats you could ever meet 
 Besides its only the heat 
 I don't give detectives reasons to fuck with me 
 I'm quiet, on the murder diet 
 I've seen flesh turn from brown to violet 
 Not one word, no need to dial it, hes expired 
 This is no longer desired 
 And last hired, until somone saw it in the streets 
 I'm the nigga [?]
