 Okay last time, this is drugs 
 This is your brain on drugs 
 Any questions? 
 Welcome home George Jung (RIP McBride) 
 The real Boston George 
 It's that Dade Country yayo shit 
 Double MOB 
 I'm finny take these pussy niggas down 
 Beat Billionaire 
 I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's, in my all white Mercedes 
 I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's 
 I got coke like the 80's, in my coke white Mercedes 
 All white, nigga, Big Ike, nigga 
 Keep shooters with me, you'll call your gravesite nigga 
 15th Ave, miracle nigga 
 Get [?], come and get a few nigga 
 John Doe nigga, you know that convo 
 Get you that weed and white, want you a combo nigga 
 Checkmate with the sticks, identify by your kicks 
 Welcome home to Skinner, already bought him a brick 
 Boobie Gang was the clique, forever changed the game 
 Bunky Brown was a legend, Wayne Parker the mane (Vonda) 
 Carol City success, 183rd still a rout 
 We live in the jungle, fishtanks in the house 
 Bo dealin' nigga, oh really nigga? 
 Bunche Park hot, it's a block full of killas 
 Lil' Trav, nigga 
 Execution upcomin', 'bout that lil' tab nigga 
 River City, they slide, aka homicide 
 Rest in peace to the Goonies, one day we'll be eye to eye 
 It is what it is, I left the vest at the crib 
 Extended the clip, I'ma give 'em the biz 
 Catch you jackin' your dick, now you fucked in the game 
 Leave you flat on your back, where you lay was a stain 
 A mil' in the hole is every real nigga goal 
 And this uncut like Ochoa, they want your crumbs off the floor 
 My new bitch, she a waitress, strip club is a trap 
 Stick my dick in her pussy when she come sit on my lap 
 Get that paper, my plug, he sent that pack from Bahamas 
 It's uncut like the 80's, 17 still my number 
 Candy paint on my donk, Jesus piece on my charm 
 [?], She just wanted a bump 
 Her man wanted a line, so I sold 'em a verse 
 Sold a quarter for 9, and I sold 'em the vert 
 Can't be takin' them trips, for that flea market whip 
 Peep this Rollie fugazy, I'm sellin' game to a pimp 
 Line up all of my bitches, head crack 'em and check 'em 
 Even if she barefooted, I bet the streets gon' respect her
