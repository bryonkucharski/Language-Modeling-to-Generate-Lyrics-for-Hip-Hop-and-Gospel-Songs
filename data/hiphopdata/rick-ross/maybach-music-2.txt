Realist shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back 
 Can you believe that? Woah you gotta see it 
 I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach 
 'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas, can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music 
 Martin Luetta King. Jr, startin' 
 All that stuntin' is gonna ruin ya 
 B I was a lie, he probably had a two tone 
 With the gray poupon, anything yay poupon 
 We'll explode 'cause I'm am the shit 
 And this is my commode, uh, oh, there they go 
 Talkin' about how ya, boy, clothes extra tight 
 I just remember that my limelight extra bright 
 I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype 
 You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke 
 We know who not gettin' no sex tonight 
 And a lap dance will probably be a blessing right 
 So all the shit you talking dead, coffin, light the weed coughin' 
 New crib loughtin' 
 Where it's at, Austin? Where's that, Texas? 
 What's in front, Benzes? What else, Lexus? 
 Well, who's Maybach is this, Mr. Westses 
 Realist shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back 
 Can you believe that? Woah, you gotta see it 
 I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach 
 'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas, can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music 
 Boss, Kush, my light controlium, grim mean custodians 
 Shades or no shades, these made erotium 
 Use to be the oldsmo, hoes call it oh lo 
 Now I got so many horses bitches call me polo 
 5762, tell me how ya wanna move 
 Yeah, you know I got them both 
 Beat your ass black and blue 
 I was barely gettin' pretty women 
 Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter 
 Any winter, Fendi denim like a slender, nigga 
 Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the real contender 
 Sellin' reefer even Gregory, I'm on my dinner 
 So what the fuck is ya tellin' me other than your gender? 
 I'm a boss and I'm ridin' like a small fault 
 Niggas, make your wheels and ride till they fall off 
 Yeah, Ross 
 Realist shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back 
 Can you believe that? Woah, you gotta see it 
 I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach 
 'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas, can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music 
 Well, alright 
 All black Maybach, I'm sittin' in the asshole 
 Classy as a mother still gutta like a bad bowl 
 Benjamin Franklin, no X in the cash row 
 That's right, the mills do like damn close 
 I eat ya mill too, we don't feel you 
 And we be strappin' up like the navy seal do 
 Sweet as banana split, every time I peel through 
 Fresher than Will Smith and uncle Phil too 
 Watchin' TV in the Maybach, in traffic 
 I'm on my feet like tough actin' tinactin' 
 I'm run in this shit, you should try tacklin' 
 Lil Wayne in one word immaculin' 
 You see the Big, you see the Jay 
 The Tupac in him, the Kurt Cobain 
 The Andre three stacks and then I'm back to doin' shit 
 Like I do say Maybach music 
 Realist shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back 
 Can you believe that? Woah, you gotta see it 
 I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach 
 'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas, can't take that 
 Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
