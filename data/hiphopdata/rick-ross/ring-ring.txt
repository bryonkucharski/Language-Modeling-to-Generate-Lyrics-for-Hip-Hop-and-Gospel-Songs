Aye, I'm bout to leave the studio bout 2:30 baby 
 You can just hit me back then, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I'ma pick up for you 
 Lemme be the one you call when it's time to be a freak 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the sheets 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the spot 
 Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up a notch 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Diamonds are forever, she my bitch forever 
 Had my back forever, I was in that trap forever 
 All the lonely nights, I was chasin' cheddar 
 Now I got her movin' white, now it's like whatever 
 Put down that bus pass she got her some Porsche keys 
 Got her a Birkin bag, earrings for 40 G's 
 Sex keep on getting better, 'cause she keep gettin' wetter 
 Got her that sexy condo, nothing can separate us 
 When I'm in Chi-Town, I'm just a call away 
 Or on the West Coast, lost like I'm Marvin Gaye 
 I put up the Phantom, time to chill in Atlanta 
 She say I'm her future before she peel off them panties 
 Lemme be the one you call when it's time to be a freak 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the sheets 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the spot 
 Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up a notch 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Diamonds are forever, she my bitch forever 
 Crib big as Turner Field so you know we rich forever 
 Diamonds in a bezel, smokin' on this leather 
 No my grind couldn't be better, and she thick as ever 
 I got killers in Decatur, as well as Dade County 
 She in cribs with elevators, as well as water fountains 
 How we move can't be debated, the hustle well rounded 
 Talking square feet, master suite, 12,000 
 Lemme be the one you call when it's time to be a freak 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the sheets 
 Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the spot 
 Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up a notch 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I'ma let my phone ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
