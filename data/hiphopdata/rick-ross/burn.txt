 These nigga wanna hate, that's why they get what they deserve 
 We only dealin' what we have, livin' and we learn 
 No more J's on the porch, days that we were poor 
 Amazed by mama boy, bumping Maze in the Porsche 
 Bulletproof vest suburban, they hatin' you when you earn it 
 Bitches be rollin' in it, they say I'm so photogenic 
 Every night is a feast, niggas be having beef

 Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'

 Her titties fake but they look real cubic, zirconia's 
 Run up in your house spare the kids and kill the grown ups

 Skinny nigga but I do it Large like a 3X
