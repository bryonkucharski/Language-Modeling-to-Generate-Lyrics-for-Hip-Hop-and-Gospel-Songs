 But may I strike down an get vengeance, 
 Murder my homeboy, Why you doin' like that, 
 Niggas getting churched up, Time for the get back, 
 Found him last night, four shots in his back, 
 No leads to the case, Triple C's will handle that, Just bought a new swo? 
 In the streets I'm sworn, 
 Its time for the murder ride, all on board, 
 Give me them sticks, s-k, s-k's, m-11's 
 When tha hammer fall, 
 Dats for the trigger pull, 
 Another maggot falls, 
 Split down in beu[?]

 Another clip of snitches, 
 While they looking at bitches, 
 Feel like I'm brainwashed,

 Caught 8 bodys in four weeks I'm on fire, 
 'Cause I want you to cry,

 Or just addicted to husslin,

 Mama fightin an fussin,

 Givin' the new pistols to hoes, 
 Graduated from [?], 
 Rappin' for waves of people,

 Rollin' down your block, 3 deep, got my pistol in my lap,

 Back on the dock, 
 Port of miami, blood hound for the rock

 The winner is me, I want you to cry, I want you to scream, just want you to die, 
 I want you to fly, I need a prayer, when I'm satisfied, just to live another day, 
 Rollin' down your block, 3 deep, got my pistol in my lap,

 Got your name on my list, 
 Ya I'm bumpin your crib, I'm fuckin' your bitch, 
 I put her to sleep, then I think of myself, 
 Call in evil things that I can do in my wealth, 
 Is that a bitch, I'm getting work, I never spare a bitch, 
 You getting murdered, in bloody gloves, with bloody shirt, 
 Tiger in my eyes, bitch you know who done the dirt, 
 When I left I had a whole hundred in the magazine, 
 Now there none in the magazine, 
 It was a guy so he died at least a hundred time, 
 Looked him in his eyes right before I made him cry
