Give me a chevy tre cheverlet let me ride 
 Half a pill just a hit it gets me high 
 Duce tre esclade that's my style 
 T double d thuggin' and raw ride or die 
 I used to be a polo kid 
 Who would have thought of all the stupid shit that I did 
 I used to sport it talk about it 
 That's the reason why shorty went in the hood and bought it 
 Mr. Rabbit like a fast from the past bone jean overalls why'all can kiss my ass 
 Thug nigga going back to the basic 
 And that Iceberg on the curve is thug animated 
 But first off this is T double 
 When I hitya with them k cutters 
 You turn bout three colors 
 Gon and get your big brother I don't care 
 I'm dade county major slash player 
 Hold up 'cause Mr. Dollar got sold up 
 Time for war now be a boy what's the hold up 
 A new candidate for the thug of the year 
 I'm the ultiment thug the rest of them busta is quitters 
 You know it's your boy are Ross, the overweight hell of a nigga so pepperlicoius 
 And we getting it 
 Sitting on serious inches 
 We dem niggas smoking coco and serious vison 
 (At the door) bouncers don't touch us 
 They know once ounces go up they hold up 
 And know what 
 I drink cris let it bubble back 
 I'm leaning on double stack ready to snap 
 Trick already know why'all ain't ready for us 
 We make a way in the club waving a slug come play with a thug 
 I can let why'all lay in the mud 
 I battle you partner 
 A spotter that's hotter with a nuff music to wake pac up 
 Keep your glocks up you can't stop us 
 True husltler chop doctors knot in pockets 
 In truly didited or god got us 
 Some of these ho's think I'm manish 
 Go head ask me were I got my manners 
 Bitch ask your mamie 
 I slap a bitch in minute 
 Seen it twice already ho I muthafucking mean it 
 Plus d bout big money get honey lauging 
 That six hundred still running 
 So what's the cause mayham or murder 
 Who is the killer shit I'll kill ya 
 Got money so I'll make it in court 
 Plus I'ma thug nigga and I'll never get caught 
 Bout to set up shop pushing caine to rocks 
 Plus my glock gon take this shit on top

 We don't eat shit smoke caine out the same damn house 
 This is thug life not a citcom 
 Plus we got big guns ready for change now
