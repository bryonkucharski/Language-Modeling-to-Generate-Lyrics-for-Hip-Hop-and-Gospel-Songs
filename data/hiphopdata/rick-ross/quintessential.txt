(Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 My paint wet, my bitch bad 
 Straight mastermind, yo' rich ass 
 My cup full, full of that pink shit 
 So shut your fuckin' mouth, fuck all that weak shit 
 This MMG shit, MMG shit 
 She fuck my whole squad, she MMG bitch 
 Just got that G-Wagon, I'm just so innovative 
 We came for the money bags, so fuck your invitations 
 This calls for a celebration, Bel-Air celebration 
 60 hoes in the basement, nigga covered all the bases 
 Jabbar gave me a quarter, I sold it on the 1st 
 I took it to my mama, "here go get what you deserve" 
 Mob ties, Genovese 
 Money trains, centerpiece 
 We started at the bottom, until I got a bird 
 I pull that pussy card, that was all ya heard 
 Haan, haan, haan 
 (Hook: Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross) 
 My whole life been based on that pimp shit 
 Haan 
 No movie, just money, real pimp shit 
 Haan 
 More cities, more bitches, real slick shit 
 Haan 
 My Maybach it matches my outfit 
 That pimp shit 
 (Verse 2: Snoop Dogg) 
 Keeping my tool, this shit so cool 
 Rule number one, ain't no rule 
 Swallow my lines, follow my grind 
 Rich white bitch with a bottle of whine 
 Word to the wise, word to mine 
 Bird a fly, certified, murder eye, dirty die 
 Never had black but she heard of my 
 D O Dub, I done it all, 20 years I bang a ball 
 91 I had a Lexus nigga 
 Ate seafood for breakfast nigga 
 Caught a few cases in Texas nigga 
 Do kushups till my chest get bigger 
 I press a nigga till I get it all 
 Real shit bitch I really do ball 
 I am the west to y'all 
 Taught y'all how to invest in ball 
 Best of all, took it on a chest for y'all 
 That's why I get more than the rest of y'all 
 It's bad enough I entertain 
 Add it up, gangbang 
 Gat 'em up, slang cane 
 Bag it up, same thang 
 (Outro: Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross) 
 Titty one, titty two 
 Haan 
 See these are essentials, essentially speaking quintessentials 
 Haan 
 I bang it all, I dust it all, I smoke with all my dawgs 
 I bang it all, I dust it all, I smoke with all my dawgs 
 My paint wet, my feet chrome 
 Fuck boys hey, but they sing along 
 The real niggas admire 
 Success makes you inspire 
 Nigga came from the jets, I just hired a pilot 
 Bitches feeding me fruit
