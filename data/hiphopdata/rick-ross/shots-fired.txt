Slow down 
 I just heard a bunch of gunshots go off my... sibling just left on her bike to go 
 Oh my God, they're turning around and coming back 
 Okay 
 I'm hanging up, I'm hiding, bye 
 Okay, m'am, how many shots did you hear? 
 I don't know, I don't know, but they're coming back. I'm hiding 
 "We're being told by people here on the scenes, specifically the manager that a famous rapper was riding in that car when someone opened fire shooting at that car, that car crashing into that building. Police cleaning up the shell-casing markings that were here just a few moments ago. This is still under investigation" 
 "There was a rapidfire 9 or 10, 9 or 10 shots. You know, rapidfire with rapid succession and odd enough it wasn't a handgun, it was some kind of a rifle." 
 "Police have leads, but no strong description of the shooter or the shooters who appeard to have targeted South Florida based rapper Rick Ross as he drove down the street"
