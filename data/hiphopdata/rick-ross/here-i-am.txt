(Intro: Rick Ro$$) 
 Ricky Ro$$. 
 It's somethin' special right here. 
 Excuse the marijuana, just tryin' to join myself. 
 We got some gangsta's in the house too. Come on! 
 (Chorus: Avery Storm) 
 I got a bunch of dollars 
 I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady 
 She can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night 
 Get right he ain't actin' right 
 Every super woman needs a super man 
 Here I Am. 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ro$$) 
 Sight seein' we might be in the codra port or that new white BM 
 Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face 
 Next semester she transfer to Florida state 
 Cookin' like home-etch for financial aid. 
 I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid. 
 Remember mean time my finance is straight 
 I even open up the doors to the panantial states, Boss 
 She used to fight with her moms 
 Till I sat 'em both down 
 Now she's tight with her moms (what?) 
 Yeah I put the ice on her arm 
 Now she know she gettin' sliced 
 Spending nights in Milan (yeah) 
 We still blow... together 
 Cheated on her but we still gon' be together 
 With the house on the water hit the beach whenever 
 She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss. 
 (Chorus: Avery Storm) 
 I got a bunch of dollars 
 I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady 
 She can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night 
 Get right he ain't actin' right 
 Every super woman needs a super man 
 Here I Am. 
 (Verse 2: Nelly) 
 Here I Am and here I go 
 Why you lookin' for that other when you got the best? 
 The previous was a test for you 
 Now you in the big leagues. 
 A black Sine brother who wouldn't wanna play for me? 
 Your last man was a chump 
 And you can tell him I said it 
 He was talkin' alot at first 
 But you can see that dead it 
 You can see I ain't sweat it 
 Hell I'll even call him myself 
 And tell him I dead it 
 Naw Please don't confuse me miss 
 I'm tryin' to see if I could put you on my Christmas list 
 I hope you ain't offended by this 
 But I think your ass fine as shit 
 And That's straight up real talk, all bullshit 
 Aside she replied 
 "I Like To Do The Wild Thing" 
 Action took place at my place 
 Now my place is her place. 
 (Chorus: Avery Storm) 
 I got a bunch of dollars 
 I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady 
 She can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night 
 Get right he ain't actin' right 
 Every super woman needs a super man 
 Here I Am. 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ro$$) 
 Mo' better mo' cheddar not the man off your clothes last sweater (what) 
 Hoe getter gorilla fuck chuffers 
 I went and got mo' killers boss 
 I rock with Niggas like Fabolous 
 'Cause He tell the truth baby like Fabolous 
 But you make it look glamorous 
 Here's spaghetti strapped heals not for amateurs 
 Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like roxy 
 Spark that broccoli walk quite aky 
 Let me sexy I will save you if you let me. 
 Fly with me, get high as me 
 Alot of alphabets girl I'm a G 
 Time will tell, Rolex watches 
 We show stoppers, hoes just watchin'. 
 (Chorus: Avery Storm) 
 I got a bunch of dollars 
 I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady 
 She can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night 
 Get right he ain't actin' right 
 Every super woman needs a super man 
 Here I Am.
