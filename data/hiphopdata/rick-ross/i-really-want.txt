Every time I call she come 
 'Cause every time I call she get to come 
 The mama love it look what this shyt done 
 When I used to keep her rollin' on them bitches like which one 
 She graduated from the school of arts 
 Now she swimming in a pool of sharks 
 Roughest niggas with the coolest cars 
 Sophomore year had her first minja 
 Met in dc lik gobra 
 Drunk it lik a fiji and blew my socks 
 Every night she comes through for me to fuck that 
 Found out she had a man I hollad fuk dat 
 Better give that boy a bus pass 
 I see no competition baby girl a must have
