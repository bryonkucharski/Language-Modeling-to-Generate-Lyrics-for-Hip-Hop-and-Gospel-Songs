I'm sittin' at the table, countin' my money 
 Ain't where I wanna be but I got a few hundreds 
 A lot of talk on the streets like a nigga crossin' me 
 Well, that's somethin' I gotta see 
 Is it how my chain swings? Tired of ma face 
 Tellin' lies, getting niggas wives tied up and raped 
 Similar to da mob, deeper than a rap 
 All you niggas gettin' robbed, all the cell phones tapped 
 Bullet in my head, bullet in my chest 
 Yeah, they want a nigga dead, they envy my success 
 To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feelin' 
 Hundred rounds in da drum 
 Niggas gettin' whacked, no sympathy for the soft 
 Niggas snitchin', I know bitches who clippin' your dick off 
 I'ma boss champagne with the steak 
 Pink rose jay sittin' ace by da case 
 Brisco line, 2 young niggas, what it do 
 He gotta pretty shone and he wanna bring her through 
 That's love, we go back to the blue house 
 And if she bad enough, may take her to da new house 
 My Maserati be da new body 
 Got your girl panties wetter than a pool party 
 I got her sleepin' in the king size 
 Last night I had tha bitch sittin' ring side 
 You wanna go that route, go there 
 I been on this road before 
 (Uh, huh) 
 I know gunplay, you know gunplay 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm shootin for the win but ready for the loss 
 Both bags on the tip on my finger 
 Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 When I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout time 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine 
 Ain't thinkin' bout dying 
 My nigga so street, my swisha so sweet 
 All this money on the table, how a nigga gon' sleep 
 Speculations on my deal, it was over ten mil 
 Blowin' herb, chauffeur plus home in New Zeal through 
 Beat the case like Gotti, we the Trill Murder Inc 
 I erased, slip and slide, they rainy in the mink 
 Look dead in her eye, it's da end of the road 
 In the purple Maybach means dat I'm getting' more dough 
 Smell the Christian Dior, I used to be poor 
 When you cross Florida lines, boy, I'm your leor 
 Boobi Boys steal, Boobi Boy's real 
 You can name a lot of lames that the Boobi Boys killed 
 Brisco line to young nigga, what it do 
 Said he gotta couple kilos and he wanna bring 'em through 
 That's love, we go back to da blue house 
 And if he brought enough I may buy me a new house 
 You wanna go that route, go there 
 I been on this road before 
 (Uh, huh) 
 I know gunplay, you know gunplay 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm shootin for the win but ready for the loss 
 Both bags on the tip on my finger 
 Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 When I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout time 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine 
 Ain't thinkin' bout dying 
 Nigga how I'm livin', damn near dying 
 For every digit I get, fuck they know 'bout that 
 I ain't never put shit on the line, just shit in they rhyme 
 I shoot a nigga shit on a rhyme 
 Wanna bet nigga, you ain't a threat nigga 
 Never seen a laptop in da projects nigga 
 Just powder, cut with comet, fuck them comics 
 Convicts and buyin' it, if they ain't coppin' or fryin' it 
 Then don't get a nigga fired up behind sum 
 Fuck shit, ma nigga don't want this 
 Who dat, who dat behind the curtain 
 I'll merk 'em, wizard of oz niggas 
 Hiding behind money, hiding behind luxury 
 I see 'em shootin' up all that fuck shit 
 It's getting' ugly, got torch on the line 
 Said he got a couple nuns, I told him 
 Grab two koo, bring 'em on through 
 You wanna go that route, go there 
 I been on this road before 
 (Uh, huh) 
 I know gunplay, you know gunplay 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm shootin for the win but ready for the loss 
 Both bags on the tip on my finger 
 Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 When I'm swingin' dat iron 
 (Dat iron) 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout time 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine 
 Ain't thinkin' bout dying
