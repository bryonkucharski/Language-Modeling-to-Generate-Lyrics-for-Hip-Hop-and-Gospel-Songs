I ride for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas 
 I slide for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas, dawg 
 (Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg) 
 I ride for my niggas 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Damn, life's so short 
 Fuck, I don't wanna go to court 
 Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though 
 Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month 
 I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it 
 My lil niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid 
 I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category 
 Double M, I got G's out in California 
 (Young Frankie Geechi Liberace) 
 (Verse 2: Drake) 
 It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads 
 Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours 
 That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all 
 I just ask them when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all 
 Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing 
 It's feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged 
 Back then if a nigga reached it was for the weapon 
 Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record 
 Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge 
 Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around 
 Might look light, but we heavy though 
 You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know 
 Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge 
 Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around 
 Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga 
 I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down 
 Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M's 
 Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him 
 Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym 
 (Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym) 
 Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", I'm tearing holes in my budget 
 Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public 
 Ordered her the filet told 'em butterfly it she'll love it 
 She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin' 
 I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical 
 You like the fucking finish line, we can't wait to run into you 
 But let me get my mind off that 
 Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap with my niggas 
 (Verse 3: French Montana) 
 From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog 
 Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog 
 Dwight Howard on the post, dog 
 My niggas got the powder through the post, dog 
 Watch the body tilt when you hit the head 
 Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds 
 10 grams off my last 250 now 
 Big ass crib, 250 down, damn 
 Gave my nigga Max 7-5 
 Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 
 Fuck it, got me thinking like I'm 7-5 
 Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30
