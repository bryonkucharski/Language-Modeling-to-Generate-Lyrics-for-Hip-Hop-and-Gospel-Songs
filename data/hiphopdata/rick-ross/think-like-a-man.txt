You gotta act like a woman 
 And think like a a man 
 Why you call me your dream bed 
 And foolish of me I believe that 
 You said every king needs his queen babe 
 That's why you needed me baby 
 Right in between lost and love 
 You go and mess things up 
 Now there's no we babe 
 There's just you and there's me baby 
 There was us, there was trust 
 There was happen and change, I know 
 Silly you, silly me, silly us, what I've wait 
 But in love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman and think like a man 
 But in love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman and think like a man 
 Now I'm gonna keep it realer with you now that I ever been 
 Wish we would never been, girl we was better friends 
 You didn't had to tell me, what went right and when 
 Um why I didn't need it 
 Cause you wasn't my girlfriend, we had a good thing 
 You were a combining hitting, ooh give me that good thang 
 Then after we were finished 
 You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever 
 Tell me what ever happens 
 Think this wanna gonna be better 
 And now I'm telling you lies 
 All because I hate to see the tears in your eyes 
 Of course I want my cake, and needed too, I'm a guy 
 And of course, you don't understand 
 But you would if you thought like a man in love 
 But in love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman and think like a man 
 But in love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman and think like a man 
 Time cost money and it's so expensive 
 Versace, lenny got these women blowing kisses 
 Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic 
 Can I take a picture, she's my mona lisa 
 Living like a princess in a fairy tale 
 You know them people up in barney show and tell 
 Bentley black and not a ninja see no poney tail 
 5 karat yellow diamond you don't know me well 
 Penthouse, set the drunks, it don't call and sell 
 She called the night at twom I had to call the cab 
 You don't understand it's altitude I'm balling at 
 I'm at the game on the wood where the owner at 
 Soldiers from 'bout the same 
 Boy you tell me everything 
 Yeah you show me how you think 
 You're the only one to blame 
 It's such a shame 
 Yeah should lost the game you tell me how to play 
 In love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man 
 But in love, love, love 
 You gotta act like a woman and think like a man 
 Act like a woman, act like a woman 
 Gotta act like a woman
