I've been lonely 
 I've been waiting for you 
 I'm pretending 
 And that's all I can do 
 The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear 
 I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal 
 You tell the truth I don't know how to feel 
 Never felt alone in a room full of friends 
 Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense 
 Pray for me, patience wait for me 
 Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin' 
 Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups 
 And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops 
 Now we lookin' at each other, sittin' in a court room 
 I'm laughin', cause its lookin' like a cartoon 
 Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo? 
 (Somebody switch) by my rules we all lose 
 You've been hiding, never letting it show 
 Always trying, to keep it under control 
 You got it down, and your well on your way to the top 
 But there is something you forgot 
 Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life 
 But they keep takin' pictures of my jewells in the light 
 100g's in the night, entertainin big timers 
 'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus 
 Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed 
 Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin mail up 
 Clothes come from big 'n' tall? 
 Got live life, tryna live life, 
 Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice 
 Convertible to the cars, 'cause I murdered all of ours 
 Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars 
 You've been hiding, never letting it show 
 Always trying 
 To keep it under control 
 You got it down 
 And your well on your way to the top 
 (Trilllllaaaaaaaaaa... ross) 
 But there's something you forgot 
 Fortune 'n' fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem 
 But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace 
 Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily 
 I know I'm under sureveillance (I look at it as a talent) 
 Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin' 
 I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen) 
 I started without a coin, not knowin' which way I'm goin' 
 Now I'm chowderin ?, n readin 'em a few poems 
 Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light 
 I never felt this way bout anythin' in my life 
 Determined to be the best, not lookin' back at regrets 
 How many people you blessed is how you measure success 
 I've been lonely 
 I've been waiting for you 
 I'm pretending, and that's all I can do 
 The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
