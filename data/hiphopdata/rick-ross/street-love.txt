(Intro: T-Low) 
 Yeah Suave House, street love 
 T-Low 
 (Hold up) 
 C'mon 
 Let's take it to the streets 
 (Interlude 1: T-Low) 
 All those beamers and Lexus, Jeeps 
 With the 12's in the trunk to make you beat 
 All my country playboys be going deep 
 All my country play girls are the stone freaks 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 I came up in the gutter, ski masks and gloves 
 Running up on different cars, flashing the drugs 
 Chasing the paper, never after the love 
 After I crush perhaps I blush 
 Blasting the truck 
 You step in the mansion, you asking to fuck 
 This is Suave House baby we ain't passing the cuts 
 Blasting the cuts, gassing her up 
 She look like her man be lacking to touch 
 (Verse 2: NEXT) 
 She can say I'm simple, I don't ask a lot 
 Catch me in the drop when it's hot, smoking pot going out and I be like what 
 When it comes to the ladies, you might call me crazy 
 I like a whole lot of street and a whole lot of freak 
 A love that can represent me 
 (Hook: T-Low) 
 I'm talking bout street love 
 Making love in the back of the truck 
 Or on the hood if it's sunny enough 
 Don't care if anybody see us 
 I'm talking bout street love 
 Life of a woman in love with a thug 
 Poppin' bottles of Cris at the club 
 A little drama but she's the one 
 (Verse 3: NEXT) 
 I got a quarter piece 
 With pretty heat that never brings [?] freak 
 A little bit of hood like me sexy 
 Ain't afraid to tip Hennessy with me, ooh 
 I used to wile out, she makes me smile now 
 Love of my life no doubt 
 She's something I can tell mom about 
 She's just... 
 (Hook: T-Low) 
 (Interlude 2: T-Low) 
 Breakin' out extensions while we drenching 
 In the rain I'm hidden on park benches 
 Love love, (love love) 
 Love love, (love love) 
 I'm talking bout at you job while your on your lunch break 
 In the car 'cause I can't wait (can't wait), love love 
 (Verse 4: Rick Ross) 
 Tef still rockin' the ballys 
 Go shopping in Cali 
 Coppin the Nally 
 Dodging the rallies 
 I'm gettin' it right, neck, swimming in ice 
 Your net worth buddy, I bet on the dice 
 Best in the light, it's simple and plain 
 Meet the coolest bitch in the game 
 Who's [?] the same 
 Yeah I might be the groupie 
 Came from the wife beater to the cool G, that's me 
 For slim I put rims on the peach Porsche 
 A place, fish tank two brims and a sea horse 
 Nice guy's what she thought 
 Till she saw my face bearing the reward, [?] 
 Passports to Honduras ain't nothin' to it 
 Flashing [?] the newest you pickin' the wild tulips 
 Still focus on the money 
 Still smoking on the gummy 
 Making sure we're not the next [?] & Ronnie 
 (Hook: T-Low) 
 (Outro: T-Low (NEXT)) 
 All my [?] beamers and Lexus, Jeeps 
 (Street street love, (street street love) 
 With the 12's in the trunk to make you beat 
 (Street street love, (street street love) 
 All my players out there who go deep 
 (Street street love, (street street love) 
 All my ladies out there who are stone freaks 
 (Street street love) 
 Suave House, you hear me 
 Uh oh
