Get Money! Get Money! 
 (Intro: Elijah) 
 Girl I think you're special 
 Strictly presidential 
 (Verse 1: Ross) 
 You know the crib on the water now 
 The Maybach stay watered down 
 Project niggas giving orders now 
 The gold presidential just to sport around 
 I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars 
 Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads 
 Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling 
 Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling 
 Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me dap 
 Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap 
 I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek 
 Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released 
 Bitches, they keep coming, Billie Jean thumping 
 I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning 
 I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something 
 I could ship her something, you know that December coming 
 (Hook: Elijah) 
 Girls and green is all you need 
 When you're a star baby, a star babe 
 We all dream of royalty 
 But that's who we are baby 
 All I ever need is girls and green 
 (Verse 2: Ross) 
 They see me leaning in some new shit 
 Now it's gold presidentials for the crew shit 
 Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship 
 I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip 
 She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch 
 Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch 
 Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit 
 Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish 
 I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master 
 I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest 
 Fishscale made me major profit margins 
 I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving 
 Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch 
 80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit 
 She on that Alexander Wang 
 Gold presidential Venus when I change the game 
 (Verse 3: Ross) 
 She wanna roll with a winner now 
 So I let her roll with the windows down 
 My nigga's up the road come and get it now 
 60-40 no we split it up the middle now 
 Shawty's said the word, I was talking that talk 
 Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck 
 I never been in love until I heard a beat 
 She never met a G until she heard of me 
 3rd floor projects, feel my point of view 
 Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you 
 Isabel Marant sneakers till the summer through 
 Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do 
 Baby girl got that wet wet 
 I repeat: wet wet 
 I'm the boss and I'm on that 
 White T, gold Rolex 
 Her shoe game remarkable 
 I feel solely responsible 
 I feel solely responsible
