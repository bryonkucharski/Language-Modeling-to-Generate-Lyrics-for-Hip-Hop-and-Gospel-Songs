(Intro: Boosie Badazz) 
 Boosie Badazz 
 Rozay, I know about that nickel rock 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 In the match box I saw my first nickel rock 
 Carol City nigga with his first nickel spot 
 Rest in peace to Arthur, boy, we gotta give him props 
 In his angel house he chopped our first nickel rocks 
 Natural-born hustler so you know the dreams grew 
 Gold D's on the Chevy what cream do 
 Front line nigga, still I was team two 
 Always ready for whatever when it came to it 
 Young nigga took an L and he chose to tell 
 All the boys over there, they never took it well 
 Do the math on the ave when your time comes 
 Have your ass on your back with your eyes stuck 
 (Hook: Rick Ross) 
 Paid mama's light bill with them nickel rocks 
 Even kept the phone on with them nickel rocks 
 Got my first pair of Jordans for them nickel rocks 
 Even felt extorted for them nickel rocks 
 Got it all, but the days on them nickel rocks 
 Got a 5 dollar sale for these nickel rocks 
 Seen a man kill his brother for a nickel rock 
 I'm a bad motherfucker with a nickel rock 
 (Verse 2: Boosie Badazz) 
 I know some niggas got popped behind a nickel rock 
 The best times was on the block, was on the nickel spot 
 Gangsta P got 30 for a nickel rock, repeated offender 
 Should've told that nigga stop 'fore they ate him for dinner 
 The church ran by a sinner since his word didn't stop 
 When he finish communion he gon' get a nickel rock 
 Lou started with a nickel rock, started flipping plenty blocks 
 30 years in 'cause he sold that first nickel rock 
 Got my first pussy for a nickel rock 
 Ain't gon' lie, that bitch was hot 
 If I had it she would have got a block 
 Rock solid over here, no question 
 Duncan owed 5 dollars and he stretched him 
 Over a nickel rock 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Put the pistol in your name and you may get the blame 
 I just wanna feel the fame and go get the chain 
 Old shooter on the team, I'm Bernard King 
 Started with a nickel rock and got a triple beam 
 What you want, code red, you the Feds 
 Put this pistol to your head, it's time to go to bed 
 On account of I just want to see my daughter fed 
 Went to the store and I came back with just a loaf of bread 
 Real when you nickel rock, you wreck your deal 
 Boosie did a nickel, back on top the nigga real 
 Double M, we get the money that you never will 
 One nickel rock in my pocket to a half a mill
