(Intro: Whole Slab) 
 Look at nigga Rozay, look at him 
 Out there with that CrossFit shit 
 Nigga think he a boxer, workin' out and shit 
 Nigga done bought Holyfield crib, nigga 
 Five hundred acres, a thousand rooms, nigga 
 This nigga think he the champ 
 Holyfield must have left a belt in that bitch for him 
 Ya dig? 
 (Hook: Rick Ross) 
 I been touchin' that set, I made my way to a key 
 I'm so in love with the trap, I bought a house 'cross the street 
 Quarter key got me livin' like I'm Don King 
 Heavyweight, I'm in the ring nigga, ding ding 
 Nigga, ding ding 
 Nigga, ding ding 
 Don't make me hit you 'cross your head, nigga, ding ding 
 Runnin' off with all your things, ding ding 
 (Verse 1: Whole Slab) 
 License been suspended, ridin' with the yay 
 I shit where I eat, I trap where I stay 
 Smokin', bottle poppin', Belaire Rose 
 And I don't give a fuck what pussy niggas say 
 Michelangelo of this trap game 
 Traded fifteen pounds of mid for a half a thing 
 We mix that eighteen, now it's thirty-six 
 Turned that midget to a brick, that's a pretty flip 
 Shout out Mally Mall, I got a few bitches 
 I don't get my dick sucked, unless it's two bitches 
 My trap Mike Tyson, nigga, heavyweight 
 I'm sleepin' in the trap, we open every day 
 I'm parkin' on my block, I'm beatin' on my street 
 Twelve all in my ass, they locked my [?] last week 
 These niggas know they pussy, talkin' bout they robbin' 
 Talkin' bout they eatin', these niggas out here starvin' 
 (Hook: Rick Ross) 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Diamonds on my pinky, women on my dizzle 
 Bulletproof the Lincoln, there go Ricky Rizzle 
 I'm the Thrilla in Manila, Belaire, my Ciroc vanilla 
 My cousin certified killer 
 When he died, I know I cried a river 
 You come and go, that came down from the Lord 
 Every night I hit Rose case like a fuckin' voice 
 Hallelujah, momma screamin' "Hallelujah" 
 Pray for your son cause momma, you had you a shooter 
 For this cocaine, they standin' in this cold rain 
 In pneumonia weather tryna move that whole thing 
 Heat game, season tickets, that's for my whole team 
 '88 Mike Tyson, that's with the gold teeth 
 Heavyweight, Don King, Robin Givens, big dreams 
 (Hook: Rick Ross)
