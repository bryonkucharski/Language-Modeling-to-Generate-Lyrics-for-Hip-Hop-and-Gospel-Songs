Got on my darkest shades, this man is made 
 Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness 
 Physical fitness, home economics 
 In the kitchen digital scales producing the product 
 Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave 
 In the coupe with the tec, it's the home of the brave 
 They wanna know names, they toting on thangs 
 Never wanted the fame, just wanted the Range 
 I needed some change, mama needed a raise 
 She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage 
 I'm feeling the same, all these criminals paid 
 Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm selling dope shameless to say 
 And maybe one day I could put this pain away 
 Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say 
 I'm ashamed to say 
 Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say 
 (Honey, it's shameless 
 Shameless, what you've done) 
 Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say 
 Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say 
 Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader 
 I mean look at my features, educated my teachers 
 I was calling them plays, you were still in the bleaches 
 Boobie gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers 
 Now I'm roaming the block, car missing the top 
 Meaning missing a roof, hope you listening y'all 
 I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows 
 Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road 
 Went from walking on gravel, now I'm riding on vogues 
 50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone 
 Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say 
 All the money in the world can't take this pain away 
 It's just another story at the campfire 
 Court side seats with the franchise 
 I think about my niggas doing 25 
 Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize? 
 I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon 
 Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling 
 Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poised 
 First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys 
 Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues 
 Better ring the alarm, 'cause we bringing them pistols 
 Heaven singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues 
 These emotional niggas, and most of them killas 
 They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters 
 These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures 
 See I live by the code that the mafia wrote 
 When he ran his mouth, me I'd rather smoke 
 I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission 
 I had to make a way, I had to act commission 
 Until this day am slanging, the commission remains 
 Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say
