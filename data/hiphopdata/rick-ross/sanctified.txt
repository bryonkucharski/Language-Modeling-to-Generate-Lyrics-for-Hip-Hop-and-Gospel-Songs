There's a few million angels movin' around me 
 I just worship thee, for all he's done for me 
 It's a new day, I have been born again 
 I've been born again, I've been born again 
 In His spirit, and His name 
 I'm sanctified! 
 Lord I testify 
 He's right by my side 
 I believe it be 
 His word is so clear to me 
 Yeah, yeah 
 All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch 
 Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage 
 Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established 
 God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status 
 Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin' 
 But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever take that nigga back to Cassius 
 So you can gon' and make them lies, but I'm so sanctified 
 I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a hankerchief 
 And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus 
 People sayin', "Ye we need another Yeezus" 
 Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wilin' out, out" 
 But who the fuck is you reachin' 
 Past me? 30 bottles champagne precession 
 That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments 
 God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive 
 Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!? 
 Feel his blessings wash away my sins 
 I'm sanctified and, I have been born again 
 Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name 
 Oh 
 All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch 
 Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage 
 Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established 
 God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status 
 Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address 
 Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress 
 Felatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best 
 Major coke figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh 
 Soldiers all in Al-Qaeda, new Mercades for cadets 
 Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest 
 Double M, that be the Army, better yet the Navy 
 Baby seen me in that rave, wanna have my baby 
 All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch 
 Now I want two hundred and menage in my palace 
 Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance 
 Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice 
 Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish 
 Till I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish 
 When we fucked again, she said "That was just some foul shit" 
 I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence 
 There's a few million angels movin' around me 
 I just worship thee, for all he's done for me 
 It's a new day, I have been born again 
 I've been born again, I've been born again 
 In His spirit, and His name 
 I'm sanctified! 
 Lord I testify 
 He's right by my side 
 I believe it be 
 His word is so clear to me 
 Yeah, yeah
