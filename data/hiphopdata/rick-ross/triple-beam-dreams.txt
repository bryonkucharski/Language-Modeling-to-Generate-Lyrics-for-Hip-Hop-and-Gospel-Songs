(Intro: Rick Ross) 
 It's time to take you to the other side 
 The side you gotta watch your A&E cable television for homie 
 But we live this shit 
 I'm not a star, well that's a lie 
 I seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testified 
 Spoke on a homicide amongst other things 
 Even share my triple beam dreams 
 (Verse 1: Nas) 
 A project minded individual, criminal tactics 
 Us black kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive 
 Mentally sex-crazed, dysfunctional they describe us 
 They liars, at the end of the day, we fuckin' survivors 
 I remember watching Scarface the first time 
 Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime 
 How could I sell this poison to my peoples in my mind? 
 They dumb and destroy themselves is how I rationalize 
 In a bastardized nation, magnum .45 carrying 
 Where I'm from ain't far from Washington Heights to cop Aryan 
 A rookie boy, the cookie didn't make no profit 
 A stranger to the block, I damn near had to make them cop it 
 It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage 
 I brought it back to papi, ain't trying to take no losses 
 He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses 
 He gives me powder, he has faith in Nas' ambitions to distribute coke 
 Had addictions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes, but I'm again broke 
 This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers, they up their orders 
 Barely at 62s, they already up to quarters 
 They out there every day, some true hustlers for you 
 I'm at it half way, none of my customers are loyal 
 Picturing piping out the seats of a Pathfinder 
 Powerful pursuit for pussy, cash to flash diamonds 
 My junior high school class, wish I stayed there 
 Illegal entrepreneur, I got my grades there 
 Blaming society, mad, it wasn't made fair 
 I would be Ivy League if America played fair 
 Poor excuse, and so I was 
 Throwing rocks at the pen just for the love 
 Before the evil, the secret life of G's 
 You seeing my blurry, triple beam dreams 
 (Hook: Rick Ross) 
 Pocket full of money, parking lot full of them haters 
 Triple beam dreaming, crib with 2 elevators 
 20 flat screens and got cameras every angle 
 Dope been coming so you know the income major 
 Rule number 1: I can't do business with a stranger 
 Contract killers coming when I feel endangered 
 Early 90s reminiscing when I had a pager 
 Triple beam dreams: now Pat Riley my neighbor 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Fuck boy talking out of turn nigga 
 In the court room, spreading like a germ nigga 
 25 on the line, them niggas dropping dimes 
 Whole operation got them rednecks dropping time 
 Khaki suits and some niggas go to acting cute 
 We was all cool, stacking in Acura coupes 
 More accurately, we acted as is if jacking was cool 
 Snatching niggas out they shoes then wear jackets to school 
 Fuck boy, you caught up in my dream 
 Counting cream on the cover of a magazine 
 I'm the source, got the plug with the uncut 
 Jay-Z Blue Magic nigga, what what 
 Brand new S Class with a meal ticket 
 Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger 
 Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high 
 Triple dream dreamin' as the cream multiples 
 Fuck boy talkin' out of turn nigga 
 'Fore you sell dope, it's shit you gotta learn nigga 
 Home invasions, duct tape 
 Fornicating, counting money with a fuck face 
 Fucking bitches that be giving up your whereabouts 
 Slow leaks, gotta air 'em out 
 Kill 'em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga, ball 
 Phantom drop head, shit I had to get 'em all 
 Niggas hate but they know they never get involved 
 Food on the plate, fuck 'em all I could send my dog 
 Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality 
 I'm from where your hustle determines your salary 
 Six figure family member, nigga forget about it 
 Low income housing, nigga trying to get up out it 
 I got a plan little nigga, just believe in me 
 Triple beam dreamin' with this thing in me
