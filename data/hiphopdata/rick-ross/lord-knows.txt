All we wanted was opportunity 
 Just Blaze, Lord Knows! 
 It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here 
 And this girl right here, who knows what she knows? 
 So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom 
 And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all 
 But that's just the result of me paying attention 
 To all these women that think like men with the same intentions 
 Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention 
 Even a couple porn stars that I'm ashamed to mention 
 But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models 
 Heffer and Jordan my only role models 
 That's why I walk around with all this gold on 
 And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems 
 Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings 
 All of the little accents that make me a king 
 I never hear the disses they try and point out to me 
 But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing 
 I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August 
 Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters 
 Get some shake a brick in the press 
 And chef it like Mrs. Fields they're making the cookie stretch 
 I know it so well, I know the hustle so well 
 Stunt like I'm workin' overnighters right by the motel 
 Drug money, outfit record clean 
 Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team 
 Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real 
 Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real 
 I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' 
 I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy 
 Mixtape legend, underground kings 
 Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things 
 With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs 
 Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams 
 They take the greats from the past and compare us 
 I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era 
 In a time where it's recreation 
 To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations 
 I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at 
 Never the flow though, they know I run that 
 Fuck you all, I claim that whenever 
 I change rap forever, the game back together, yup 
 YM, I remain that forever 
 In the same place my brother Wayne at forever 
 I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix 
 I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished 
 I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me 
 I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy 
 Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy 
 So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me 
 Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up 
 Roberson boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up 
 A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up 
 But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of? 
 Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky 
 Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies 
 In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy 
 That's why all the real soldiers salute me 
 Trill nigga, for real 
 You know I love this 
 Yolo, "You Only Live Once" 
 I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie 
 Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal 
 I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink 
 The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think 
 Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper 
 Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica 
 Villa on the water with the wonderful views 
 Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews 
 Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise 
 And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes 
 It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar 
 Every by week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car 
 Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R 
 Headlights flickin', lookin' like a fallin' star 
 Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' ye' like anime 
 I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game 
 Mink coats making women wanna fornicate 
 Rosay and Drake, I'm gettin' cake, nothin' short of great huh!
