 DJ Khaled: 
 Remix. Speedin' Remix, the movement. 
 I introduce you to the projects, I introduce you to the hood 
 I introduce you to the ghetto, I introduce you to Rick Ross 
 The boss is back. Trilla, this the remix, Speedin' remix. We the best! 
 Plies: 
 This for all my goons, reppin' on pills 
 Speedin' to make me run in your crib 
 Put they offer behind your wheel 
 Monkey suit, black mask, city boy gear 
 Slippin' got alot of niggas whacked this year 
 Been up two days straight homie no sleep 
 Ridin' with choppas lurkin' Fo' deep 
 Jumpin' out on the first thing look sweet 
 Double stacks got the goons grittin' teeth 
 Car full of throw away big boy heat 
 Two brand new K's hangin' off seats 
 Yeah it got me speedin' all week 
 Birdman: 
 G4 straight from the NO 
 We gettin' money stay fly till the next show 
 We got money stay fly till we get more 
 We got bitches high rollin' with this cash flow 
 Put the H in the hood 
 Put a 1 on the good put a slab on the wood 
 Me and Ross doin' good 
 100 million dollars nigga hangin' in the hood 
 Busta Rhymes: 
 I'm doin' donuts in the streets pedal to the glass 
 My lord of Murcielago max on the dash 
 Speedin' niggas can't see me in the blink of a flash 
 You got to slow motion to flick so you can see me when I pass 
 You know just what to do when you see me gettin' my cash 
 When I pull up drop the bags and? I'm doing the dash 
 No confusion understand no gimmicks 
 Duke is like the Autobahn disregardin' the speed limits 
 Fast life, fast broads, let's get it fast buddy 
 Fast food, fast cars we gettin' fast money 
 Fuck the talk we been doing this, heat it up 
 And when you bringin' me my cake you better speed it up 
 (Chorus: R. Kelly) 
 Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, speedin, I'm speedin' 
 I can't stop it's all I know 
 From a youngin' I was taught get doe 
 I'm speedin', speedin', I'm speedin' 
 Webbie: 
 It's all a big ricky in my brand new Bentley 
 Doing above 50 fin' to get another mill' tickets 
 I ain't bein' funny I don't see the competition 
 Since a youngin' get the money all I ever comprehended 
 Business hall ass ball till you fall yeah 
 Y'all sit on y'all ass, now I see why y'all mad 
 I'm leaving y'all ass, I ain't seein' y'all ass 
 Never cross that line put 3 in y'all face 
 Gorilla Zoe: 
 17.5 god damn liar 
 Country niggas playin' damn near 25 
 Who gon' pick them up pick up them up first flight 
 Call Ricky Ross hell yeah high five 
 Throw them in the trunk and I'll tape them to the fender 
 Scrapin' off the plate like a niggas eatin' dinner 
 I'm speedin' shorty you trippin' 
 If you see the blue lights homie I'm dippin' 
 Fat Joe: 
 Niggas want hood rep the hood back 
 Shit Joey the don they call me cooked crack 
 If you look at them wrong you get it pushed back 
 From rags to riches they never look back 
 I'm watchin' pelicans fly me and Rick racing Diddy on boats 
 Throwin' money in the air and you niggas just chumps 
 New york New York big city of dreams 
 I'm a hustla baby I'm addicted to cream 
 I'm talking money, cars, hoes, bitches 
 Cappadon suit let the feds take pictures 
 88 pose just me and my niggas 
 Thank god for that white if you feelin' religious 
 Torch: 
 I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side 
 Nickel and dimes to survive 
 Fresh out the can million dollar plan 
 Tryin' to triple up that weed money nah I'm sayin' 
 Precise with the white pirates a job my job to make it hard 
 Only way up out the hood rap crack or playin' ball 
 Ain't nobody touchin' the plate if I ain't eatin' 
 Fuck it hand me 220 on the dash let me see it 
 Gun Play: 
 Rest in peace Chad Butler, I'll see you when I get there 
 But for now I'm doin' 90 in a cigarette with bitches 
 Lookin' back on last year laughin' at the mirror 
 I'm on TV I look a little clearer 
 You look a little worried chill and smell the money in the bag 
 I'm a crash too many hundreds on the dash 
 Killah come ride with me... nah I mean... holla at me 
 Trilla, Gun Play, Triple C I'm outta here 
 Flo-Rida: 
 [? ] On the digital dash I go ghetto miles per hour no speed pass 
 I did know got my momma pregnant this fast 
 They said that he my daddy 
 It's good times junior last saw me was in a caddy 
 Speedin' this time the snitches won't tell 
 I was MTV when the ball dropped player 
 Tila in my Tequila before I struck out the 12 
 Big Apple with apple bottoms the haters can go to hell 
 Number one on billboards Mr. Rubberband boy 
 Like a boy-yoing-yoing [? ] 
 Brisco: 
 I'm livin' life in the fast lane with no L's or brakes 
 Why should I care about tomorrow when I'm doin' it today 
 No insurance on the Chevy but it's ok 
 Tell them catch me if they can while I'm speedin' away 
 Ride in HOV, I'm sprayin' nitrous so they can't see me 
 See me I'm POE 
 Everytime I come around 
 And I would if I could but I can't slow down 
 Rick Ross: 
 What they need just to give a nigga life 
 Give him 20 years just to feed a nigga rice 
 Put me in a hoe just to let me see the light 
 There's some niggas out here free ain't even livin' right 
 Five star g's my car leased 
 If you got the heat puttin' H on the streets 
 Heroin haven heroin graven 
 You would think I was a heroin baby 
 It's a new year, new year, new money 
 New Louie shoes but they cost a few hundred 
 Left the tip case still bought them new Tommy's 
 Got more scrilla for niggas with new drama 
 Lil' Wayne: 
 Young Money hookin' up with Ross 
 Top way back left foot up out the Porsche 
 Right foot flat, I'm good up in the Porsche 
 Oh there I go Shaq tryin' to pull up on the Porsche 
 But I burn that cop on my way to Opa-Locka 
 Brisco holla back I'll be at at here in fact 
 Like I left somethin' soon as I left somethin' 
 Told me go to diamonds and just go and Weezy F somethin' 
 Ferrari F run Lamborghini test run 
 Call me weather man I make it rain in my chest sunny 
 Got your honey I don't give a damn about the raps honey 
 Cash Money, Young Money never ever less money 
 All we do is get money all we do is bet money 
 All we do is let money, go and get money 
 Now that's money Young Weezzzzy Baby
