Sometimes I get so fucking paranoid 
 Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth 
 I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more 
 Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors 
 I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss 
 Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost 
 Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction 
 The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion 
 Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion 
 Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction 
 Follow my actions, came in in '06 
 Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit 
 I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies 
 I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish 
 Niggas is minor, the money manure 
 I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th 
 It was never filmed, therefore never seen 
 It was never him, that's what these haters scream 
 I wrote the script, I was sipping lean 
 Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam 
 This thing of ours 
 It's so mafioso 
 You ain't never know though 
 Never gon' know so 
 No never, no never, no never 
 No, no, no, no 
 This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper 
 They don't rap for a reason, this is rather convenient 
 Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle 
 Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing 
 Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it 
 Ain't even 5'11?, what the fuck you guys scared of 
 I'm a loose cannon, screws damaged 
 And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards 
 Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama 
 Getting up in they mental, get 'em outta their garments 
 Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama 
 Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us 
 Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber 
 I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us 
 When you young and you black, they see you as a target 
 So before them Foamposites get ya lawyer in order 
 This thing of ours 
 It's so mafioso 
 You ain't never know though 
 Never gon' know so 
 No never, no never, no never 
 No, no, no, no 
 The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something 
 All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting 
 Y'all just started pulling on Havanas 
 Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is 
 A don is one who accept things he cannot change 
 Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying 
 Gold medallion over my son chest, he'll hold it down when I sunset 
 What does death mean to me? 
 I never owned the concept, I was here 
 I'm just a spirit, let's get one thing clear 
 Everything segues into each other 
 One thing is just an extension of the other 
 My kid to me, I am my children through history 
 Upstanding men and stand up women 
 I am existing 
 I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections 
 We haven't met yet, my reputation you've stuck with 
 Until we have our formal introduction, that's enough 
 But every male is not a man 
 So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand 
 This thing of ours 
 This thing of ours 
 It's so mafioso 
 You ain't never know though 
 Never gon' know so 
 No never, no never, no never 
 No, no, no, no
