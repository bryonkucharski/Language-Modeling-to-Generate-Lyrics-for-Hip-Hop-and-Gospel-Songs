I got a feelin' nigga rillin' and my money be the root 
 Look up at da stars she like, honey where the roof? 
 Pull up, hear the dogs, canaries dey go on roof 
 Even once had a job pourin' tar up on the roof 
 Dat boy had it hard no facade, it's da truth 
 So now when I menage and get massaged just to proof 
 Proofs in dat pudding and dat bakin' sodas takin' 
 Paper dat would make take dem photos naked 
 Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wiggie Williams 
 I flip my middle finga I'm chillin' on 20 million 
 Da room has turned me on I'm masterbatin' at da top 
 These hoes so excited so dey catchin' every drop 
 I'm dodgin' the barcols like pot holes in Jamaica 
 We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the makers 
 Martin had a dream, Bob got high 
 I still do both but somehow I got by 
 Treflo prayed, Mike Vick paid 
 Bobby Brown stray, Whitney lost weight 
 Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write 
 Dat may why they money lookin' funny in the light 
 But who really cares if you just throw it in the air 
 Celebratin' wealth pourin' Moet in her hair 
 Excuse me her weave the blue is her weed 
 Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese 
 Dat boy get salad beef bow movement 
 BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin' foolish 
 Shawty sittin' low big thangs poppin' 
 Tip on da glock from a crip up in Compton 
 Shootin' at da cops, fuck 1 time 
 I gave her to da block, I fucked 1 time 
 We boys in da hood and nigga you lil trey 
 So press ya appetite we takin' ya lil tray 
 Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit 
 Banned in 1994 but I'm 2 legit 2 quit 
 99 to 6 kilos was the shit 
 But dat were batter den roofin' dat shit be bad for ya skin 
 Niggas was ruthless and Lord knows dat I've sinned 
 But I thought about my future in the loops like a pin 
 Walked out on da gig and I turned to da streets 
 Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks 
 I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically 
 I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me 
 Mothafuck 'em all and sweat from my balls 
 If I drop anotha album I did dat for my dogs 
 10 Maybachs everybody ridin' big 
 I just sit back like, look what I did 
 Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness 
 Once I said my prayer everybody back to business 
 Smokin' on a blunt in my own restaurant 
 People lookin' from a distance think I'm big daddy cunk 
 Reincarnated spirit of a G 
 Beef'll make you dinner take a seat so we could eat 
 A Farrakhan aura, paws on the port 
 You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork 
 Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered and dey coil 
 I'm laughin' at you 'cause, I kill you niggas when I'm bored 
 We steppin' on ya crew until you mothafukkas crush 
 And make da sweet love to every women dat you lust 
 I love to pay her bills can't wait to pay her rent 
 Curtis Jackson baby mama I ain't askin' for a cent 
 Burn the house down, gotta buy another 
 Don't forget the gas can, jealous stupid muthafuka 
 To another chapter, paper dat I captured 
 Caught up in da rapture off of gunshots and laughter 
 Homicide is zooming and nigga you lookin' funny 
 Women love to stare 'cause dey know dey see da money 
 I open up my mind about openin' bank accounts 
 Deposit a 100 stacks break up now take it out 
 Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live 
 I knew it wouldn't work but I just like to give 
 Used to run da street, young nigga bare feet 
 Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin' crab meats 
 Ice so right other rappers envy 
 Dey callin' all my jewelers up askin' wat he spendin' 
 Thinkin' 'bout boss, not thinkin' bout dem 
 Here's a letter to my enemies when I won't sin, amen
