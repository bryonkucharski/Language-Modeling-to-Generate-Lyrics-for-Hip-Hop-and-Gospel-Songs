What a beautiful day it's been at Beth Shalom, Miami 
 I'm rabbi Peter Rosenberg and I wanna congratulate our Bar Mitzvah Ricky Rozay 
 I've never seen a service so lavish 
 I've never seen such a spread like the luncheon provided by Wing Stop 
 So delicious and we thank you 
 Never have I seen such beautiful titties hanging out at a Bar Mitzvah service before 
 But it's appropriate because today, Ricky, you are a man 
 And you will enjoy the fruits that come with being a man 
 And that's why tonight we will all be out together with the MMG family 
 And all of Rick's friends at the beautiful King of Diamonds gentlemen's club to celebrate, 
 To have a nosh and to enjoy each other's company 
 Ricky now that you are Bar Mitzvah, what would you like to say to the community?
