 Could you knock that ho, could you blame that bitch? 
 'Cause she wanna roll with a real nigga like me that's gon' slang that dick 
 Like coke to a fiend, fuck throat on the lean 
 Take low on the Perc, now that ho on a bean 
 Still money over these hoes 
 Got YSL on my clothes 
 And blood drip on my sneakers 
 Nigga, you hating on me, she chose 
 And I ain't fuck your girl she rode 
 My stick-shift she drove 
 Did everything that she 'posed to 
 I pulled my camera out and she posed 
 And I was like, got that 
 Drop that, pop that 
 Got the top back on the drop back, I'm back 
 And the Glock at where the crotch at, I'm strapped 
 All the rocks at where the watch at, stop that 
 Could you cop that? Not that 
 I'm light send the mob at, dime sack I'm catching on contact 
 Got racks, y'all niggas ain't 'bout that, 'bout that life! 
 Poof! There go the car 
 Poof! There go the crib 
 Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield 
 David Copperfield, David Copperfield 
 Poof! There go the car 
 Poof! There go the crib 
 Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield

 Poof! Nigga fuck your life 
 Fuck your niggas and fuck your wife (Fuck 'em!) 
 Got two bad bitches with a nigga 
 And you know they gon' fuck all night (Right) 
 And I rock hard white 
 Nigga rich game pride 
 I'll pull up on whores and I'm sitting on fours, in a big boy drop 
 Call big boy shots, all clear stones in my big boy watch 
 All year long, got the strip on lock 
 Everytime we in this bitch, man, shit gon' pop 
 My hip on Glock, your hip on nothing 
 My niggas got racks, y'all niggas be fronting 
 Red Cartier, redbone bitch 
 Red bottoms on her, hair long as shit (Hold up) 
 Yellow gold Ro', yellow bone ho 
 And yellow bottles of Spades, nigga 
 Whole clique self made, nigga 
 Poof! There go the car

 Poof! There go the car
