(Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 I walk streets, speak brief to key piece 
 [?] Y'all knee deep in the streets 
 Sweet lord show me a sign and close when I open my eyes I'm hoping to find what's rightfully mine 
 Serenity and respect being the man of color 
 When addressed, most politicians ran for cover 
 We don't come out to vote, we'll run 'round with coke in the projects' third floor gun 'round with coke 
 Hustlers ballin' whore, showin' these watchin' so as a revolving door we saw it all before 
 Neighbors don't speak shit, they all at war 
 And in the gutta my nigga, that's all it was 
 I'm praying for an angel that can absorb the blood 
 I'm praying for an angel that can absorb the slug 
 I'm waiting for the blessings, just show me some love 
 When my daddy died, I came close to not giving a FUCK! 
 If ye be willing an obedient 
 Ye should eat the good of the lamb 
 But if ye refuse and rebel 
 Ye should be devoured with the sword 
 For the mouth of the lord have spoken it 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 What I did last night, lord, forgive me for that shit 
 But that 9 to five gig won't get that Benz 
 That 9 to five gig won't get that boat 
 That 9 to five gig don't impress these hoes 
 'Cause a real bitch is not impressed by clothes 
 She'll fuck you for free, depending on what you know, what you roll 
 Some back to the root, the dough baby 
 Homeboys know the hoes come before the dough baby 
 I'm ask 'em all, my passion to ball 
 To fraction ya all, caskets fall, practice the law flashin the fall eat on my necks if yours 
 And small jobs to the clean work for once 
 A dirty nigga wearing a clean shirt, it feels nice 
 Got the Cubans on hold 
 While Tony ? wash money 
 Turn the booth into the block 
 Rappers got Glocks for me 
 BANG! [Shots Fired] 
 The lord is my light and my salvation 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 When my enemies and foes came upon me to eat my flesh, they stumbled, and failed 
 (Verse 3: Scarface) 
 You see God sees it all 
 Now I wonder if God liked if he let this Jews get away with the murder of Christ 
 Is the God you're praying to the same God 'cause mine ain't white 
 With a chokehold on niggas in charge of all lightness 
 Have faith for ass nigga, I'm all prayed out 
 Got scarred up knees and I live in a crackhouse 
 Funny how people use their religion to fuck with bitches 
 Boys get molested inside the church by Archbishops 
 Preachers turn into faggots 
 And in the club gettin' lapdances 
 Bible contradicts, hands to the last chances 
 You give your life to God, you'll be forgiven for that 
 The muslims fucked around and went to prison for that 
 I guess the point I'm trynna make is if you're white you're all right 
 All the other colors they try to muscle motherfuckers 
 With that made up shit, that they fuck with 
 As far as I'm concerned [?] can get the duck sick 
 (Scarface talking) 
 All I need is one mic, one church, one God, one life, light 
 And I ain't preaching for no salary 
 I don't need no salary 
 Selling the word nigga! 
 And lead us not into temptation 
 But deliver us from evil 
 From that is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever 
 Amen
