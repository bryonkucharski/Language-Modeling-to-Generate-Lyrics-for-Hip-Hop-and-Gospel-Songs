(Pre-Hook: K. Michelle) 
 This is so all bad, nothin' good can come from this 
 Sweet but sad, I don't know love ruins a relationship 
 It will never last but it feels so good, guess I gotta deal with it 
 This is so all bad, this is so all bad 
 (Hook: K. Michelle) 
 Got me messin' 'round with you 
 You got me messin' 'round with you 
 Out here messin' 'round with you 
 What you gon' say? What you gon' do? 
 Baby if they knew? 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 I'm a G, she say the pain runs deep 
 But she can't run from me 
 I'm in these streets with the killers, thugs, and drug dealers 
 100 mil' plus, in trucks with no ceilings 
 Fuck who don't feel it, I'm feelin' like I'm the realest 
 Biggest boss in the business and really that's to infinite 
 What we doin' wrong but it feels right 
 Can't discuss what we did the whole night 
 Won't be the last time, on my cash line 
 Duffel bags so accountant is the past time 
 And for the last time, I'm not a bad guy 
 I just like what I like, now shorty act right 
 Small waist, red weaves 
 Black car, keep it flyer than them Red Wings 
 Nightmares, day dreams 
 She the one, listen how she say things 
 (Pre-Hook] + [Hook) 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 She in love with the life, champagne and all the light 
 Chanel sneakers and scarves, I want you to be my wife 
 We can run around the world and tuck with no fear 
 G4, G5, whole team here 
 Call ourselves friends, but we holdin' hands 
 Got alot of questions, am I a controllin' man? 
 I run the streets but I'm well known in Japan 
 As a G, a boss, the money coming fast 
 She from a lovin' home, I'm from a troubled home 
 One bedroom, didn't have a telephone 
 Now I'm on the corner, time to get my hustle on 
 Women recognize, and now I got a couple of 'em 
 Speedin' in the Beemer then I got a Range 
 She not a side chick, she all in my lane 
 She a quiet chick, may let her see some things 
 I'm catchin' feelin's for her, she take away the pain 
 (Hook: K. Michelle) 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Life amazin', wake up in new places 
 Big faces stuffed in suitcases 
 Played the hand I was dealt, few aces 
 Now the bedroom suite is too spacious 
 Niggas wanna kill me but I put 'em on pause 
 Broke motherfuckers better bow to the boss 
 I'm gettin' high, I'm above the law 
 Gettin' down and dirty, makin' love to her 
 Please believe in niggas that's still schemin' 
 But the ghost that floats the 4 Seasons 
 To love me baby is too easy 
 But what I need you to do is just believe me 
 She got the Range Rover, I was cool with it 
 Been the land, cruisin' girl I went to school in it 
 Green Goyard bag, it got the tool in it 
 Everytime we fuck I act a fool in it 
 (Hook: K. Michelle)
