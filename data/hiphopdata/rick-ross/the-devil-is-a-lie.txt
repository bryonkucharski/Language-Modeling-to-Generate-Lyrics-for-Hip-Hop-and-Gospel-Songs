Masterminds! We gon' get this forever 
 You know whenever we link up, my nigga 
 They think this shit comes from outer space or something 
 Nigga, let's get this money nigga 
 Masterminds, R-O-C, double M-G! 
 Jay, I got it, I got it 
 Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet 
 Car seats still smelling like 10 ki's 
 Tell a plug that I'm lookin' for increase 
 Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece 
 Say a nigga name and the car start 
 Nigga switching lane to lane like WalMart 
 Sippin Bordeaux out in Bordeaux 
 Hazard lights flashing on the four-door 
 Switch the Benzo for the Enzo 
 Back to the Benzo when the ends low 
 Switch my old bitch for my new bitch 
 Cause my new bitch something like a nympho 
 Fuck the game raw when I came in it 
 Getting money ever since I came in it 
 You couldn't stop me if you tried 
 Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie 
 Big guns and big whips 
 Rich nigga talkin' big shit 
 Double cup, gold wrist 
 Double up on that blow, bitch! 
 Two mil on that I-95 
 Bow your head 'cause it's time to pay tithes 
 Opposition want me dead or alive 
 Motherfucker but the devil is a lie 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the truth 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the proof 
 The devil is a lie, the devil is a lie 
 Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie 
 Two kings on the big screen 
 Niggas seen a 36 at 16 
 100k for the 16 
 Nigga's stick dirty but his dick clean 
 My money goin' on the deep end 
 Talkin' half a milli for the weekend 
 Contract like a nigga play defense 
 Curtains in the Maybach bitch peek in 
 Now the bitches wanna car hop 
 6 cribs for the cars in the car lot 
 Dope boys on the goal nigga 
 Went gold 6 times for a goal nigga 
 Black bottle and a bad bitch 
 Club all money where the cash is 
 Dubai I can do it like a sheikh 
 Top floor nigga Burj Khalifa 
 Big guns and big whips 
 Rich nigga talkin' big shit 
 Double cup, gold wrist 
 Double up on that blow, bitch! 
 Two mil on that I-95 
 Bow your head 'cause it's time to pay tithes 
 Opposition want me dead or alive 
 Motherfucker but the devil is a lie 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the truth 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the proof 
 The devil is a lie, the devil is a lie 
 Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie 
 Is it truth or it's fiction, is it truth or it's fiction 
 Is Hova atheist? I never fuck with True Religion 
 Am I down with the devil 'cause my roof come up missin' 
 Is that Lucifer juice in that two cup he sippin' 
 That's D'usse baby welcome to the dark side 
 Coulda got black list for the crack shit 
 White Jesus in my crock pot 
 I mix the shit with some soda 
 Now I'm black Jesus turn water to wine 
 And all I had to do was turn the stove up 
 East Coast, winnin' at life, nigga, cheat code 
 The hatin' is flagrant, hit your free throws 
 The devil try to hit me with the RICO, them black people 
 Devil want these niggas hate they own kind 
 Gotta be illuminati if a nigga shine 
 Oh we can't be a nigga if a nigga rich? 
 Oh we gotta be the devil that's some nigga shit 
 You seen what I did to the stop and frisk 
 Brooklyn on the Barney's like we own the bitch 
 Give the money to the hood, now we all win 
 Got that Barney's floor lookin' like a VIM 
 Black hoodie, black skully 
 Bravado like Mavado, boy I'm that gully 
 Gettin' white money but I'm still black 
 All these niggas claiming king but I'm still that 
 King Hova, Mansa Musa 
 Told my lot, the devil is a lie, I'm the truth ya 
 Big guns and big whips 
 Rich nigga talkin' big shit 
 Double cup, gold wrist 
 Double up on that blow, bitch! 
 Two mil on that I-95 
 Bow your head 'cause it's time to pay tithes 
 Opposition want me dead or alive 
 Motherfucker but the devil is a lie 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the truth 
 The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the proof 
 The devil is a lie, the devil is a lie 
 Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie
