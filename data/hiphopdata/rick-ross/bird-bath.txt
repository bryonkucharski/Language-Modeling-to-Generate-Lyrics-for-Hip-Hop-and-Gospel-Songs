(Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Give a nigga leg room, that's what I said to him 
 Recognize this face, we do the peace sign to 'em 
 Niggas standing and whispering, I'm like "fuck what they talking" 
 Stay cool, clutch guns while I'm walking 
 Hope they stop and duck while I'm sparking 
 Introduce their mom to a homicide sergeant 
 Flaming your apartment, slug through your carpet 
 Two bricks of scale, top shelf in your closet 
 You ratting on the cartel which was nonsense 
 A code of silence, I feel a bitch should know 
 If you open your mouth I feel a bitch should go 
 Hit the quick vote, okay, slit your throat 
 Make sure here she's not fit to flow 
 This the vote, cool, nigga 
 My fellas, this ain't something that your bitch should know 
 If they asking about me, hey, I kick the flow 
 It's hit and go, hit the do', hit the dough 
 Hit the dro, get some mo' 
 Flip a bird, but I gotta spit some mo' 
 Sip some Mo' in the 8-4, yo, bitch, lay low 
 Any debts I pay fo', spray fo' 
 Satisfying the mix with the yayo 
 And I was locked up on the 8th flo' 
 (Verse 2: Noah) 
 I'm walking out the house while it's bright and early 
 Just hung up the phone, [?] is ready to serve me 
 Gotta meet 'em by the dock, see, I buy the boatload 
 Don't trust no niggas, but my vatos loco 
 When you're me pistols are rarely needed 
 With these prices I'm strictly business and I mean it 
 Seven gram a block, I'm moving seventy in seven days 
 Got seven distributes in seven different states 
 We money mates, we never break the [?] 
 We get your tongue froze from that uncut taste 
 We millionaire thugs making exchanges in sway lucks 
 Poke us in on distribution with cassettes and drugs 
 Never ever gunplay, that's for the broke, I let my mouth teach 
 Walking with a two point three in the bag South Beach 
 Making deals, spending expensive wheels for thrills 
 Counting money so late, man, you gotta pop a pill 
 Receiving money and load, copping kilos from boats 
 Before this, you know our steelo was strictly cutting [?] 
 Extortion involving bloody ransom notes 
 Now it's kingpin folks and hundred pound cocaine quotes 
 (Hook: Noah) 
 It's a bird bath, we move a hundred a week 
 The player price which can never be beat 
 Not by a nigga on these city streets 
 Trying to push a two gram just to get on his feet 
 This is a bath of birds served by [?] 
 Prices you never heard, yeah, my flake is nice 
 So what I'm young and I keep the caine? 
 If you come up short that's a bullet to the brain 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 I could break down a brick 
 Never *snorting noises* even though I stay around the shit 
 Spray around some shit, bound to get surround your clique 
 You was looking for respect, but you found a clip 
 From the sound, shit, the fo' pound found your rib 
 Have to wet your crib so I can drown your kids 
 My nigga Jabar who down on a bid 
 Copped this bitch a Benz to get around for the kids 
 Y'all fake hustlers, busters, I'll cut ya 
 You signing to who? So fuck ya 
 Musher when I clutch the bitch boy gutter 
 Box cutter, move with every word you utter 
 (Verse 4: Noah) 
 A bird bathtub, you cats will puff herb slaps 
 By 5 pm I've been in my third [?] 
 Serving crabs, elevated to birds 
 Calimate the first, celebrated then splurged 
 On iceberg and slow, invite birds 
 More than nine birds, you saying the right words 
 My sight blurred with teflon light [?] 
 Twenty karat ice work, Prada shoes, nice shirt 
 Still know it's a pill strapped, cock back, kill tracks 
 Steel bats, peel windshields back for that crack 
 Still rap, block niggas feel that, yeah yeah, feel that
