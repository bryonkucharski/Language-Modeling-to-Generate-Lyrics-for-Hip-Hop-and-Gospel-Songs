This shit is highly sophisticated I just make it look easy nigga 
 Follow me 
 I'm so sophisticated 
 To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated 
 To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated 
 Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment 
 I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it 
 Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it 
 Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated 
 Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated 
 Counting a hundred mill so many times, I contemplated 
 You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated 
 I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation 
 Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination 
 Made another two milli just off the compilation 
 I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing 
 Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican 
 Sippin' purple and that muthafucker concentrated 
 This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated 
 This the mob so you gotta get initiated 
 If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment 
 We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton 
 The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh) 
 We so sophisticated (Ugh) 
 Shit so sophisticated (Woop) 
 Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh) 
 I'm so sophisticated 
 Smoking weed, busting open dolla liquor later 
 I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later 
 Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it's activator 
 Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading 
 We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating 
 Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating 
 So sophisticated 'cause them hits be calculated 
 Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated 
 I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty 
 Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli 
 Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating 
 I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it 
 I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET 
 My lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ 
 Breaking news and we still get them for 10 a key 
 And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas "C'est la vie" 
 This the mob so you gotta get initiated 
 If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment 
 We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton 
 The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh) 
 We so sophisticated (Ugh) 
 Shit so sophisticated (Woop) 
 Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh) 
 Shittin' on these haters, ball hard D-Waders 
 Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors 
 That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors 
 But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper 
 But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch 
 All in my whip and she all on my dick 
 With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib 
 'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit 
 'Cause I burn shit down, yea I'm in my bag 
 And these niggas so mad it's my turn now 
 And I get that cash, my bitch so bad, she know sophisticated 
 I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters 
 I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper 
 My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator 
 Boy you an imitator 
 You ain't got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount 
 Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce 
 I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce 
 And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word 
 This the mob so you gotta get initiated 
 If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment 
 We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton 
 The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh) 
 We so sophisticated (Ugh) 
 Shit so sophisticated (Woop) 
 Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh)
