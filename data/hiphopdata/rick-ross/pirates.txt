I guess there ain't no nice way to tell you niggas it's game over, huh? 
 Pray for me 
 Hallucination of money, while nigga's stomach just rumble 
 Had to fuck with the Haitians and break a kilo to crumbles 
 Nigga living in rubble, within him labelled the rebel 
 Any nigga wan' rumble, somebody hand me a shovel 
 Gotta silence the lambs, get on my Buffalo Bill 
 Stepping off the Sonoma with the black duffle bag filled 
 Got a cute bitch with me; favor Kimora, for real 
 Got Meek Mill on the celly, that nigga worth a few mil 
 I multiply what I manage, I manage to multiply 
 Witness real niggas fail, and watch you fuck niggas strive 
 Witness bitch niggas pale, Jabar just got twenty-five 
 At this point in my life, I'm just trying to survive 
 Homicide stay on my mind, Christopher Wallace of my time 
 R.I.P. to the legend, 2Pac Shakur with a nine 
 Makaveli returns -- it's God forgives, and I don't 
 Resurrection of the real, time to get the richer than Trump 
 I'm rolling the dice, four, five, six 
 Young nigga, nineteen, four or five bricks 
 Praying on you niggas, sinners full of hate 
 God forgives and I don't, only hustlers relate 
 Trying to keep my head above water, nigga 
 We pirates out here, nigga, just trying to stay afloat 
 And I ride for my niggas 
 Fascination with fortune afford me mansion and Porsches 
 Panamera abortions, marijuana imported 
 Dreams of getting cream and never to be extorted 
 Seen so many things, be preposterous not to record it 
 Product is in demand, profit not far behind 
 Got on my mother pearl, she fucking up father time 
 Babies be having babies, I'm talking 'bout how I grind 
 Niggas thinking its voodoo the way bricks be multiplying 
 Affiliated with wealth, associated with death 
 Self-made millionaire, snatch a triple beam off the shelf 
 Straight Grim Reaper, Air Jordans walking the streets 
 Blackberry boss -- one call, ya put to sleep 
 I'm rolling the dice, four, five, six 
 Young nigga, nineteen, forty five bricks 
 Praying on you niggas, sinners full of hate 
 God forgives and I don't, only hustlers relate 
 The Lord is my light and my salvation 
 But I see none of you fuck niggas 
 Fuck what you heard, nigga 
 I need to feel it 
 I need to smell it 
 I need to see it
