They say I'm comin' too hard, huh? 
 I say these niggas comin' too soft 
 All them niggas soft 
 Niggas over there are soft 
 I sold that brick soft 
 This YSL, so soft 
 My girl ass so soft 
 These Louis shoes so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 My AK for assaults 
 I'm sippin' this sauce 
 My dick won't stay soft 
 My car seats so soft 
 These Heat Tags say "boss" 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 My car seats so soft 
 Your army so soft 
 Real nigga and she like me 'cause I make sure she get off 
 These niggas claimin' they winnin' but when I'm around they lost 
 I'm in a new car, four door, double R, logo 
 Big rims, no spokes, small tires, low-pro 
 You pussies know that I'm no joke 
 How you want it? 4-O? 
 Four four for cinco, no ocho, just blow-blow 
 Still duckin' the po-po 
 I make her come back like a yo-yo 
 I'm like Ice-T with that white girl, still gettin' money off Coco 
 Still flyer than all y'all, shit tell me somethin' I don't know 
 Got a bad bitch bouncin' on my stick like a pogo, screamin' YOLO 
 My diamonds be shinin', like a snow cone, I'm so froze 
 Far as that dough goes I'm Russell Simmons, you JoJo 
 My type get real cash, your type get killed fast 
 Y'all niggas like soft booty - Get it? Real ass 
 You ho niggas so soft, why don't you ho niggas get lost? 
 I'll pay to see you gone, how much is you niggas gon' cost? 
 I sold that brick soft 
 This YSL, so soft 
 My girl ass so soft 
 These Louis shoes so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 My AK for assaults 
 I'm sippin' this sauce 
 My dick won't stay soft 
 My car seats so soft 
 These Heat Tags say "boss" 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 Right back in the hood, fresh off tour 
 Jumpin' out that new four-door 
 Bust down APR shores 
 All this stuntin' ain't called for 
 None of these bitches ain't all yours 
 None of these niggas hardcore 
 Young fly nigga, I'm fresh, man! 
 Bad bitch with me at sophomore 
 My Rolex is like Mayweather's 
 I make it rain like May weather 
 Ask them hoes at KOD 
 I don't throw paper, I spray cheddar 
 Your whip mean? Mine way better 
 Chicks they greet and love me 
 Up in the corner and hug me 
 Go all these hoes tryin' to fuck me 'cause that leather handle so soft 
 All I know is go hard 
 High as fuck, I'm on Mars 
 My pockets on black card 'Cause it ain't no limit (ain't no limit) 
 To the shit I'm spendin' (shit I'm spendin') 
 It's double-M-G (double-M-G) 
 Yeah nigga, we winnin' 
 I sold that brick soft 
 This YSL, so soft 
 My girl ass so soft 
 These Louis shoes so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 My AK for assaults 
 I'm sippin' this sauce 
 My dick won't stay soft 
 My car seats so soft 
 These Heat Tags say "boss" 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 You ho niggas so soft 
 I'm in the hood with that white thing... 
 Mister Softee 
 Tell them kids don't run up 
 Got it on me, now get 'em off me 
 Get 'em off me, get 'em off me 
 Before I make it hot like coffee 
 Just seen 'em put a hole-in-one 
 And I ain't gon' let 'em golf me 
 Got a O-Z of that loudmouth 
 My smoke never speak softly 
 Ride on that dick flow 
 My bitch never go off-beat 
 Only time that I'm off feet 
 Known to stand on my own two 
 If you 'round me, you gotta go hard 
 Soft niggas I don't do 
 These niggas ain't family 
 If you was, I would've disowned you 
 And fucked bitches that won't do 
 Call a bitch who want to 
 Gotta feel me, my texture 
 These dumb bitches too extra 
 I just kicked this bitch up off the bus, had to "next" her 
 I'm too strong in these streets, boy 
 Please don't make me flex up 
 You know nothin' 'bout this 
 I do this, I'm a expert 
 DVs go off, like the TVs in my loft 
 That's HD on my HT 
 These ho niggas so soft
