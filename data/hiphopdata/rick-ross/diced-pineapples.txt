Diced pineapple, 
 Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you 
 The highest form of my admiration 
 And I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste 
 But before the sun graze ya 
 I'm tryin' to see how deep you are 
 And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation 
 I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable 
 When I peek into your nature 
 And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure 
 I wanna, give you what's better than better 
 The better my effort, the wetter her treasure 
 The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers 
 Shorty get it together 
 Diced pineapple 
 May your love come down so my mind might have you 
 You designed my imagination 
 Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and 
 Tell me shorty you got it baby 
 If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby 
 Let it all drip baby 
 If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby 
 Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh 
 Diced pineapples that my baby tastes the best 
 I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test 
 Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex 
 Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check 
 Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex 
 Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess 
 I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uh 
 Sex all night couple shots of Ciroc 
 Crib on the water got LeBron up the block 
 Money ain't a thing, baby welcome to the Mark 
 Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar 
 Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sign her 
 Uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team 
 Double MG them other niggas fell off, 
 Baby girl I just wanna see you well off 
 Call me crazy shit at least you're calling 
 Feels better when you let it out don't it girl 
 Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment 
 When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh 
 Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set 
 I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set 
 She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex 
 Pop bottles, make love, thug passion, red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion 
 Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated, Balmain rich denim, out Vegas 
 French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip 
 I'ma trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick 
 Baby listen, this position is a blessing and with your permission 
 Hopefully you'll learn a lesson 
 I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk. 
 She so fine she ain't even gotta talk 
 Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar 
 She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star 
 Call me crazy shit at least you're calling 
 Feels better when you let it out don't it girl 
 Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment 
 When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Something about her probably can't live without her 
 Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain 
 Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate 
 And I won't ever rescue me the peak of your mountain 
 Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you 
 And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you 
 Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil 
 To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia 
 Hol' up, showing off some Asian provocateur 
 Rushing you out your draws, though patiently get you off 
 Hate when they get too anxious though, hate when they be too dull 
 Like to get too deep but I hate to get too deeply involved 
 How sweet is you, let me see some proof 
 Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune 
 All we need is we, we don't need no room 
 Right now I'm trying eat, and we don't need a spoon 
 Call me crazy shit at least you're calling 
 Feels better when you let it out don't it girl 
 Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment 
 When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right
