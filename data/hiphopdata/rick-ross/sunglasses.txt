(Feat. Shake Severs and Blood Raw) 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 So I can, so I can 
 Watch you weave 
 Then breathe your story lines 
 And I wear my sunglasses at night 
 So I can, so I can 
 Keep track of the visions in my eyes 
 While she's deceiving me 
 It cuts my security 
 Has she got control of me 
 I turn to her and say 
 Don't switch the blade 
 On the guy in shades, oh-no 
 Don't masquerade 
 With the guy in shades, oh-no 
 I can't believe it 
 'Cause you got it made 
 With the guy in shades, oh-no 
 And I wear my sunglasses at night 
 So I can, so I can 
 Forget my name while you collect your claim 
 And I wear my sunglasses at night 
 So I can, so I can 
 See the light that's right before my eyes 
 While she's deceiving me 
 She cuts my security 
 Has she got control of me 
 I turn to her and say 
 Don't switch the blade 
 On the guy in shades, oh-no 
 Don't masquerade 
 With the guy in shades, oh-no 
 I can't believe it 
 Don't be afraid 
 Of the guy in shades, oh-no 
 It kinda scared you 
 'Cause you got it made 
 With the guy in shades, oh-no 
 Oh, I say I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I say it to you now 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I cry to you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night
