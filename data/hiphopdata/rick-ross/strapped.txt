I may not have been made for this rap shit dawg 
 Niggas talkin' shit, on records and shit 
 I'ma put these hands on your ass nigga 
 You know I'm strapped with the mac 
 Try me if you want I blow a bitch bad 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Catch me on the band she playin' gloves and goggles 
 On a ? Benz V12 with a bottle 
 A hollow and a handwave?, 50 to follow 
 I put one knee on blow, your ass been swallow 
 If you bite me dog, I'ma get your ass pavo 
 Wake up the no-ribs and the friends in Chicago 
 I'm rolling in Miami with, momos on the Lac 
 Eyes ? holdin' a stolen mac 
 Aiming at the first 'O on your Polo cap 
 Find the tool at any, signed a fool 
 Got a half tuition for my daughter's private school 
 Reason for the violent moves, silent? 
 Keep birds on us like the pirate's do 
 I'm embarrassed to speak for who your signin' to 
 (??) 
 Ya, ya all niggas stupid for free, fuck 
 (Verse 2: Noah) 
 I don't know if you noticed Joe, but I grew up on focus ho 
 With nothin' to lose, it's nothin' to prove 
 No other option but bustin' the tool, runnin' to school 
 With illegal things in my locker, I flame your posture 
 I critically acclaim an Oscar, sprayin' at your Rasta 
 ? I made a mistake and hit your father 
 I ain't sued for that I shock ya, snatch your rockets, pop ya 
 Respect me or Noah ya all better 
 I'm make you an honorary pall bearer 
 For small cheddar, bet ya wet ya brung cheddar, funds-getter 
 You a chipp off a ton sniffer, Lung-filler 
 My style none iller, gun-spiller flow for fun stealer killer 
 How you gonna stand the Kelly gave up potatoes for cheese still a peeler 
 Belly hot top stealer pillar, fedi-feller big-welly dealer 
 You cheaper than a Pica Deli dinner 
 I strike like a match, put my life on a track 
 Hit ? pikes with my wife and some crack 
 When I get her for a piss, I twistin' like a sack 
 Off goes the seat belts, out comes the snacks 
 Cop from mia out comes the mac 
 Out goes your back, out comes you sad 
 It's a lot of niggas bark, but they really won't stretch 
 I have your ass like, man where we goin' at? 
 If you're lookin' for beef, I'll be too 
 Hang on your back, jumpin' like an eq 
 Can fill your waist, legs, feet, too 
 A witness film the shooter, I'm like me too 
 They went that way, I didn't see no car 
 But listen close unless you wanna to see these balls 
 In jail you'd be barred from the TV squad 
 Your soft fans, really wanna beat me hard
