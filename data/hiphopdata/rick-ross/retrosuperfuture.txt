(Rick Ross - Verse 1) 
 The minute I wake up I gotta get high 
 The homies we found us a way to get by 
 Lets call us some bitches and have a good time 
 A lot of bottles of Vodka as we forget time 
 Lets clean up the Chevy so we can ride by 
 Quick piece of pussy call it a drive by 
 I?ma slide by sippin on that high life 
 And my slippers jack triple where my five light 
 As a all-star I made so many highlights 
 Touchdown field goal this my night 
 She the wild type ready for the wild night 
 Are you the buy type, hangin' at the bar type 
 I hope you are 'cause that mean a player all right 
 Smokin' like a Taylor so the paper is all white 
 Tryna to land a plane baby are you really gain 
 Back to the future me and Wiz got this thing sayin'? 
 (Chorus - Wiz Khalifa) 
 I stay high while y'all stay low 
 Tryna tell me 'bout the smell I know 
 But I stay red form all that smoke 
 The weeds with me everywhere I go 
 And y'all can roll, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh 
 And y'all can roll, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh 
 And y'all can roll, 
 (Rick Ross - Verse 2) 
 I got yo girl diggin all in my ash tray 
 Dickin her down for the few past days 
 She asked the name of my sneakers, are they designer? 
 Shawty green as the reefer even the grinder 
 Fuckin' like it's a porn in my recliner 
 Lookin' straight in the eyes, they show vagina 
 She's a lair but damn she does it well 
 We on fire imagine what it'll sell 
 All my homies are people that I admire 
 Small click of real niggas smokin' that fire 
 Holdin' my dick until the day that I expire 
 We and Wiz in the benz gettin' higher 
 (Chorus - Wiz Khalifa) 
 (Rick Ross - Verse 3) 
 I'm in the right pair of Nike Airs 
 From gravel to marble I travel light years 
 I'm like chyea I'ma chill right chea 
 Like the Mack 11 on me nigga no fear 
 Skateboard aboard to PanAmerica 
 I make more abroad than in America 
 Waitin? for the day Bob rose from the dead 
 In HD as I take an ounce to the head 
 (Chorus - Wiz Khalifa)
