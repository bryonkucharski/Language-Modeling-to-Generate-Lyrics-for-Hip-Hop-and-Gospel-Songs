(Intro: Rick Ross) 
 This is for my rich bitches 
 Her puppy named Panamera 
 Her puppy named Panamera 
 She got a condo in the area 
 Rich bitch 
 Uh, yeah 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 She stay at her friend's and all these bitches is bad 
 Watch them lick on each other, I'm talkin' pussy to ass 
 Dope boy still at large, trackin' device on their car 
 Tattoos on her arm, Double M diamond charms 
 Chanel bag on her hip, Hermès bracelets and things 
 Let her fuck Meek Mill, told her keep chasin' her dreams 
 Get the Lexus to flip, purple Texas to sip 
 She make it rain like a nigga, we got more money to get 
 Rich bitch, call her rich bitch 
 (Hook: R. Kelly) 
 Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money (bandz, bandz, bandz) 
 Girl, you doin' somethin' to me (bandz, bandz) 
 Hell yeah, keep doin' that, doin' that 
 Keep doin' that, doin' that, oh, oh yeah 
 Keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that 
 (Verse 2: R. Kelly) 
 I be feastin' on Tinder, she taste just like peaches 
 Diamond-studded La Perla, that pussy's prestigious 
 Yeah, she remind me of somethin' but that shit ain't my Jeep 
 Matchin' Bugattis, Versace sheets when we freak 
 She be movin' that dough, quarter mil on her wrist 
 Why you niggas be slippin'? This bitch is fuckin' your bitch 
 Saks Fifth, pop tags, Neiman Mar', pop tags 
 Crocodile, python, that's a zoo on her bag 
 She on the phone makin' deals, we gettin' them checks 
 My Penelope Cruz, I let her meet my connects 
 I fuck her all on the marble, yeah, that girl is a freak 
 She like comin' in mornin', she's the female me 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Room service for weeks, a Dusit towel on the beach 
 She only wear panties once, then pass it down to her niece 
 Let's go shoppin' at Boca, sixty stuffed in the sofa 
 Can't be tweetin' locations, she postin' pics from her yoga 
 Never party with locals, niggas with them Boost Mobiles 
 VIP with dope boys, the DJ shout out to Sosa 
 Valet parkin' the Wraith, cocaine all on her face 
 Her Rolex icy as mine, throw up my gang sign 
 We goin' bottle for bottle, Belaire Rose to the Brut 
 Rich bitch is her name and she Chanel to the boot 
 Uh, I be droppin' so much, nigga 
 My bitch shoppin' so much, nigga
