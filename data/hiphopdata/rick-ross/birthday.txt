God Forgives I Don't, Gold 
 MMG Tour, Leave the money on the scale 
 How real is dat? 
 It's been a minute since I been to church 
 Psalm 27, can I spit a verse 
 Prayin' on the weak, I should send some flowers 
 I'm layin' in the sheets, I'm well endowed 
 Time to get the money Steve Forbes got 
 I'm slowly climbin' up to Lyor spot 
 Net worth nigga hoes love to google me 
 Heavy jewellery, swimmin' trunks on Laguna beach 
 Condo on Park Ave, The mansion in Boca 
 20 bedrooms, My shit bigger than Oprah's 
 Dreams and Nightmares, Yeah I'm still havin' those 
 Side effects for niggas livin' like animals 
 Tequila cupcake for a Kingpin 
 Black Bar Mitzvah niggas ain't seen shit 
 Obama Fundraiser, All Dope boys 
 Blow ya candle out so on and so forth 
 Boyz in da Hood, nigga game ain't change 
 I done made love wearin' eight chains 
 Death to my enemies, tattoo all of my memories 
 Use the project ground for my assemblies 
 I respect the tenant, don't step on my tennis 
 Follow chain and command, Gunplay my lieutenant 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty 
 Scrr... Scrr... Wrists moving, cookin' to it 
 I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere 
 Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere 
 You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath 
 Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt! hold his tech 
 Extendo clip, extendo roll 
 When your girl leave me she need a hair salon 
 Hair weave killer goin' on a trapathon 
 See I done had more bombs than Pakistan 
 Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb 
 See nigga, I'm ballin', you in will call 
 When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Truey store 
 True to my religion, 2 everything I'm too different 
 So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh? 
 It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh? 
 She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh? 
 You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on 
 Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a menage 
 'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage 
 'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib 
 Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids 
 Last birthday, she got you a new sweater 
 Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better" 
 She said, "How 'bout I get you jewellery from the West End?" 
 How 'bout she hit the Weston and get her best friend? 
 I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her 
 Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice 
 Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit 
 We in Kanye West's Benz 
 'Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 It's your birthday, it's your birthday 
 Bad bitch contest, you in first place 
 You in first place, you in first place 
 Bad bitch contest, you in first place 
 I show up with a check to your work place 
 (Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces) 
 Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on 
 (What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on) 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 When I die, bury me inside the booty club 
 Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl 
 I might switch it up and get you girl 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
 Deuce and Ye 
 We like Snoop and Dre 
 Isn't this your birthday, baby? 
 You deserve a coupe today 
 (You in first place, you in first place) 
 (Bad bitch contest you in first place!)
