 Born stunna, she's a born stunna 
 Mercedes coup for the missus if she's a born stunna 
 Born stunna, born stunna 
 Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin' 
 Born stuntin', rap huntin' 
 Flock a hundred of them things for them cheat numbers 
 Rare numbers, head huntin' 
 Hit the mall with my bitch and blow another hundred 
 Red flaggin', poppin' red bottles

 Sway linin', with my name in it

 Strapped up tight with a hundred bags 
 Money filthy bitch, we in the money lair

 Fifty whip sittin' right in front of that 
 Ocean view, top floor, blew a hundred racks

 Checker floors, tattoo tears

 Stuntin' on them niggas like the old baby 
 Bad bitch, matchin' Gucci bikes
