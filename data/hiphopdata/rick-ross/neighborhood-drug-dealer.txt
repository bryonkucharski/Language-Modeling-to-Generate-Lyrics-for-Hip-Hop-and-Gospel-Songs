 This shit crazy out here boy, don't nobody got nothing out here boy

 One, two, what it be? 
 Michael Jordan, white, bitch, 23 
 Bet you hear my pipes rev when I tip the scale 
 Rich forever, still a muscle and it never fails 
 You a house nigga so they let you get the mail 
 We in the back whippin' egg whites and crackin' shells 
 Robin jeans for my team, pocket for the sale 
 Pussy niggas gossip pray you die from gonorrhea 
 Al Capone where I'm from that Benzo bullet proof 
 Neighborhood dope boy you can get it too 
 Fuck them pussy niggas catch they ass at Smoothie Kings 
 Hundred missed calls after that new toolie rings 
 Skip South Beach bitch bring it to the ridge 
 For that change, put that thing right up to your ribs 
 Chevy SS, she heard I bump fire 
 Got row houses up and down through Pembroke Pines 
 Say the streets count, I say its bout time 
 Bail [?] on my mama been about mine 
 Still pay my child support, in all trap money 
 All 5's and 10's, can't touch my rap money 
 She won't fuck with me, I'm hatin', yeah I'm pussy stank 
 Meet your amigo mama then you crack the piggie bank 
 Dope boy dream, never lose it all 
 Montgomery Alabama know we love the send 'em soft 
 Baton Rouge's a Actavis and act a fool 
 Neighborhood dope boy you should hit me too
