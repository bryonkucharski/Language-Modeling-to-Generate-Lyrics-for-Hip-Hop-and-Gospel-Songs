Touch'n you, 
 Rose ... what's the problem with these raps 
 They don't know how to play it cool you know 
 Touch'n you, 
 Mean it's a time and place for everything 
 Been thinking 'bout you all day 
 Right now, is about that time 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Let me show you something ... baby 
 You say it's on, seeing is believing, 
 Turn the lights on 
 She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip 
 In the gallery all I get is buy me this 
 Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn 
 Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan 
 Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money 
 Well ...all the sneakers, now she touching cash money 
 So sexy in them all black and sepy heels 
 50 stacks in her bag so she know it's real 
 Top of the Ferrari now we thugged out 
 Smoking on that callie bumping 2Pac 
 It's me against the world now what's your phone number 
 Jumping in that range rover and I'm coming over 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Been thinking 'bout you all day 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Still can't get my mind off your body 
 I'm day dreaming 'bout you sure turn me on baby 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Cause nobody confess to your body 
 Every time you let me touch 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 And every time you let me 
 Nobody compare to your body, yeah 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 I think I wanna put a ring on it 
 I think I wanna tat her name on me 
 I had a lot of sexy women, but this is not the same for me 
 Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce 
 Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced 
 I love it when she speak a different language 
 I touch her in so many different ... 
 Born stunna and my baby so stunnin 
 Wanna, but she find them so funny 
 I'm getting money, living like the most wanted 
 She all I ever needed, now I think I ... 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Been thinking 'bout you all day 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Still can't get my mind off your body 
 I'm day dreaming 'bout you sure turn me on baby 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Cause nobody confess to your body 
 Every time you let me touch 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 And every time you let me 
 Nobody compare to your body, yeah 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Pink champagne for my dame piece 
 In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece 
 In the streets you know I'm eating like a lion feast 
 Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things 
 Keys to the crib, keep it treal, time to handle bizz 
 Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest 
 Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche 
 Killing all haters, showing no remorse 
 Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice 
 I'm not them other boys, she know I shine the most 
 She modeling a lot I know she on the go 
 Another bottle of Siroc, baby let's have a toast 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Been thinking 'bout you all day 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Still can't get my mind off your body 
 I'm day dreaming 'bout you sure turn me on baby 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 Cause nobody confess to your body 
 Every time you let me touch 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you 
 And every time you let me 
 Nobody compare to your body, yeah 
 Touch'n you, touch'n you.
