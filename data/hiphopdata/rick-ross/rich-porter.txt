Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin' 
 Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling 
 My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans 
 Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking? 
 My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money 
 Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money 
 Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money 
 You hear that sound? I think it's Benji, he talkin' to me 
 They got me feeling like Rich Porter, I got them hoes 
 Selling work we got them bricks, and got the most 
 If he ain't test it I don't trust em', he prolly told 
 Dimed out your homies, seen them statements, he got exposed 
 These niggas ratting and you fucking with these pussy niggas 
 I put these hoes up on the jet and bring that pussy with us 
 I bring that new thing through yo block, I see you looking nigga 
 36 up in the pot like what you cooking nigga? 
 Fish scale, I love the hustle, I'm 'bout my paper 
 And I'm fly as Alpo before he dropped a statement 
 I knew I started getting money when I got them haters 
 Boy won't you go and kill yourself and just do God a favor 
 Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin' 
 Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling 
 My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans 
 Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking? 
 My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money 
 Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money 
 Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money 
 You hear that sound? I think it's Benji, he talkin' to me 
 Don't you see a nigga ballin' like I'm Rayful Edmond?? (No snitching) 
 My DC shooter Fat Trel hold up that Mac-Eleven (Dem Bitches) 
 Nail me to the cross I swear I'll never testify (Never) 
 Never will, that Maybach murder got em' petrified 
 I'm hard to kill, I'm counting cake up with my finest bitch 
 Take off her makeup and she still look like a finalist 
 Top models, pop bottles, catch you bitches slipping 
 Do em' dirty that top dollar make a major difference 
 I bought another Phantom, cash count that at the dealer 
 It took an hour, fast money for us young niggas 
 Can't run around, marble statues in the front and back (Boss) 
 With no regard for the law, cause all I want is stacks 
 So fuck em' all 
 Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin' 
 Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling 
 My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans 
 Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking? 
 My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money 
 Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money 
 Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money
