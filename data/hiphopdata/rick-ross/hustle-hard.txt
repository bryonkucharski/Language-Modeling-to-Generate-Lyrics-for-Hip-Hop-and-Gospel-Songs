 Got but a house note in my pocket 
 I'm on south beach with the top off 
 Bad bitch and her ass soft 
 Something outta that catalog 
 She introduced to that lock jaw 
 And I think her name was Lisa 
 Or maybe it was Sheila 
 My Chevy sittin' too high

 And I'm all about them Franklins 
 Ain't talkin' Aretha

 And I'm still feeling my pockets 
 Big bass and its knocking

 Nineteen in my nina, red dot when I ride up 
 Hundred deep in that K-O-D 
 King of Diamonds that's me nigga 
 No you bitches can't hit my beat 
 Choppers only thing free niggas

 Straight drop in my pika 
 Ace knocking my speakers 
 Last night I counted one mill 
 This morning, one fifty 
 Pussy niggas can't count me out, 
 Don't make me hurt ya feelings, ah 
 V twelve bugiddy jet blue, forget it 
 Rolex embedded with princess and baguettes 
 Same old brick, but's it's different yay
