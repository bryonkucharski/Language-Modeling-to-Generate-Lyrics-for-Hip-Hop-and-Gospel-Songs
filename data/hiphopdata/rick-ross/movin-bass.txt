(Verse 1: Tink (JAY Z)) 
 I'm the plug nigga 
 I plug niggas from out of state 
 I know drug dealers who drug niggas in broad day 
 (Sellin' bud nigga, bud nigga, bud nigga 
 Sorry to inform you all I'm a drug dealer 
 I'm a...) 
 Hustler, get my percentages off the top 
 Suited like Mr. Carter, my niggas is holding rocks 
 That's a... 
 (Dope nigga) 
 I poke niggas like Pillsbury 
 Robin' them in they hood 
 Mask on me like Jim Carrey 
 Got a Spanish boy who don't speak no Ingles 
 Give him the product, he gone pack it like it's Greenbay 
 (Nigga I'm a trapstar, trapstar, tr-trapstar hero 
 Disguised as a rapstar, uh, the flows ghetto 
 Earth is not my home) 
 They find me like Bin Laden 
 ABC tellin' stories, the government steady plottin' 
 Niggas say they hustle, they in Bugattis 
 If money ain't comin' quick, we stretch it like some palates 
 Go 
 (Hook: Tink) 
 Always on that come-up, uh, still movin' bass 
 (Still movin' bass, still movin' bass) 
 Ever seen hustles you don't know about, still movin' bass 
 (Still movin' bass, still movin' bass) 
 I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler) 
 (I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top) 
 Ima hustler, get my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler) 
 (I'm a hustler, get my percentages off the top) 
 (Verse 2: Tink (Rick Ross)) 
 I enjoy the workin' 
 Drug lords and watch boys 
 Eat or be eaten every season they make a choice 
 Like Lebron James, niggas switchin for diamond rings 
 Get that 
 (Long money, short winded, let's go and get it 
 It's amazing) 
 Bang bang 
 (?)

 Junkie at the door like Jehovah's Witness 
 (20 chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that bass 
 Gave a job to the children you scared to raise) 
 But my chain swingin' 
 Now, my name ringin' 
 My niggas hate new faces so we all racist 
 (We movin' weight up at a different pace) 
 2 steps ahead so I lead 'em like I'm T.D. Jakes 
 (I'm hard to kill Dade County, Versace Hills) 
 I am the motto 
 From Dade County up to Chicago 
 (Only one man got the combination to the safe) 
 Only woman in the field movin' 'round the bass 
 (Verse 3: Tink (JAY Z) Rick Ross)
