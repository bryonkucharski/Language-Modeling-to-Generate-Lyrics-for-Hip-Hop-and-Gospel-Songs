Trae I see ya, Rose 
 You know what it is 
 My attitude is fuck it, house big as Publics 
 Shoppin' is a pleasure, pinky ring a nugget 
 Niggas like the ride, sip lean out the bucket 
 I lean to the side, white whip Michael Douglass 
 Hard times call for drastic measures 
 I call my dog, he bought a mac 11 
 Forty rounds hollerin' where are y'all at? 
 Nigga dead serious, chopper with a shoulder strap 
 Microphone, Michael ? on I know I'm wrong 
 The man up above love for me to sing them poems 
 So sing along, you know the song I sing 
 Bring them t hings along, I gotta feed the team 
 It's ROSE, I need 100 bottles 
 Yellow bitches, all of them swallow 
 H town, nigga three oh five 
 I can move them packs, each and every night 
 Ugh, chyea 
 Triple black Panamara phantom of the streets 
 Quarterbackin bricks on top of these glass cleats 
 All these stones on my my neck and wrist part of the streets 
 Used to ? and danger that was part of my? 
 I'm in the hood under surveillance buncha haters watchin' 
 Couple choppers out for dinner, failin' ain't an option 
 Reclinable seats, invisible ceilings 
 Competition is murder, haters I'm killin' 
 Fuck a money machine, I don't count it I blow it 
 Bitch my money conceited, it look good when I throw it 
 I'm a asshole, therefore my temper is reckless 
 I'm the city of Houston, you can tell them its Texas 
 The king of the streets, somewhere deep with gorillas 
 Behind something that's tinted, bitch you see the gorillas 
 These other dudes yellin' truth, they only imitation 
 And when I see them its fuck 'em minus the penetration 
 Uh huh, yeah, uh 
 Were gettin' situated, I know you bitches hate it 
 I'm in a new Aston, the one Swiss created 
 I can't give you a dime, but I can get you faded 
 Before you become a member you get initiated 
 A lot of racks, big ice, heavy weapon 
 The hood still love me 'cause I never left them 
 I distribute it, I get rid of it 
 It's all comin' back, every bit of it 
 I'm territorial, it's your memorial 
 But don't feel bad, I'm talkin' to all of you 
 This is real shit, and that's nonsense 
 I got AK's, I got Thompsons 
 I got investors, I get sponsors 
 They scared of the crew, I'm with monsters 
 It ain't nothin' forsure but we touchin' the raw 
 And they gotta let us in or we rushin' the door
