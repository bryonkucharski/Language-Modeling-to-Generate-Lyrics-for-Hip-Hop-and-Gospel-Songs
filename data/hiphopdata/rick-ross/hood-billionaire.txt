Kilo at the telly, bitch it's Makiaveli 
 Double M empire, I know these niggas fear me 
 I'm already rich, I'm tired of bein' famous 
 I done fucked all these bitches, I can't even name 'em 
 But if the bitch is bad, bring her, yellow stone on my finger 
 Mink coat, mine cheetah, before I fuck I'm gon' eat her 
 All I talk is that cash, Versace all in my bag 
 Dope all in my vein, hoes hollin' my name 
 White T still pimpin', Lenox Mall in a Bentley 
 He a fuckboy, that's simple, I ain't into what he into 
 Hoes wave to my window, keep a pile of that endo

 Carol City niggas, still 187 
 Lil' Haiti niggas, still 211 
 Open lockin' niggas, still got them quarters 
 Overtime niggas (billionaire), still movin' water 
 Let me show you how to get right, whip an ounce of that white 
 Fast forward to a brick, now you livin' that life 
 I can get you out of my hood, I'm a billionaire in my hood 
 Tryna buy a piece of the Dolphins, 5% of them good 
 Now I think I'm Don Shula 
 Pull up with 20 bitches on the hundred footer 
 All white me gusta, oh hallelujah 
 Oh hallelujah, oh I maneuver 
 Memphis niggas, still get it right (Tennessee) 
 Mississippi niggas still get it right (Las Vegas) 
 Florida boys, know we gonna get it right 
 Alabama hustlers, you gon' get it right 
 I went and bought your bitch a washer and a dryer 
 Seen it in your son's face, I'm who he admires 
 Rules of the game, jack of all trades 
 Icy on the court at the basketball games 
 Nigga, tell your pops I got a million dollar watch 
 All you fake watch bustas, I'm the one to watch 
 Rolls Royce fake and my two yachts fake 
 30 franchises, show you what this pot make 
 Make the most in the Ghost, fuck Huffington Post 
 Young brother Rolls, Belaire Rose, I'm makin' a toast 
 At the Heat game, talkin' all cash 
 Still tweetin' while y'all eatin' out of our trash 
 Chi-town niggas, we gon' get it right (Detroit)

 Hundred million nigga till I get it right 
 Hundred million nigga till I get it right
