The music gets into my party heart, party heart 
 Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start, party start 
 Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart 
 Girl, I'm just letting you know 
 Because we 'bout to party hard, party hard 
 I hope you ready to go 
 Outside, slamming Chevy doors, Chevy doors, Chevy door 
 Rims tall as John Salley though, Salley though, Salley though 
 Gold chains, mainly Figaro, Figaro, Figaro and one of them Rolex links 
 Mister T necklace, Slick Rick rings, diamonds dancing through the night 
 Pregamed all day, waiting for the night 
 I'm on the tree, she on Ketel One and Sprite 
 Told her take it light 'cause later on gon' be tight 
 6-4 low rider, solid gold pipes, stars and the stripes 
 Spangled banner cameras and the lights, stars out tonight 
 Red carpet life, standing on them couches 
 Blowing clouds at bouncers 
 Spilling champagne on my trousers, it's a party all around us 
 The music gets into my party heart, party heart 
 Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start, party start 
 Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart 
 Girl, I'm just letting you know 
 Because we 'bout to party hard, party hard 
 I hope you ready to go 
 Me and LeBron got the same whips 
 Me and Dwyane on the same strip 
 Me and Wiz burn the same piff 
 Me and Stalley need the same pick 
 Me and Meek bone the same chicks 
 Me and Wale rock the same kicks 
 Contract like I play for the Knicks 
 My crib look like I'm still playing with bricks 
 My Chevrolet shines like a marble floor 
 Baby, keep it raw, have you modeled before 
 Fontaine Bleau, Club Liv, gold bottles galore 
 We can party hard in exclusive couture 
 Starting at your toes and I'm travelling north 
 Down south boy, diabolical boss 
 Hermes belt, spent a G for it 
 The G5 ready for a D-boy 
 The music gets into my party heart, party heart 
 Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start, party start 
 Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart 
 Girl, I'm just letting you know 
 Because we 'bout to party hard, party hard 
 I hope you ready to go 
 You know I like to party hard, hard, hard 
 Use a glock for my bodyguard, guard, guard 
 Throw it to my dogs, now it's far-fetched 
 I be on the block with Ron like Artest 
 Niggas saying that they 'bout it but I'm 'bout this caper 
 Damn near, got carpel tunnel, trying to count this paper 
 Met a girl named Jamaica but she from Decatur 
 Got a brother with the work, trying to get my cake up 
 Had a crib with the lake when I was 24 
 Bought rims for the car off of ten foot four 
 Niggas 'round the city, they have been exposed 
 If you really getting money then it's really dough 
 I'm on the phone with a bitch that say she wanna smoke 
 Click on the other line, this bitch say she really broke 
 Man, what gives 
 I got ideas they don't wanna listen 
 All you gotta do is pay ties and pay attention 
 I wanna thank God for this permission with this intention 
 The music gets into my party heart, party heart 
 Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start, party start 
 Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart 
 Girl, I'm just letting you know
