(Intro: Jiggolo) 
 You know man 
 Suave House 
 Dukey asked me like 
 Why is you name Jiggolo? 
 Where did it come from? 
 I tell her, why you think? 
 She sexy, she freaky 
 I like it, she love it 
 We do it, no cuffin' 
 Foreplay and then we fuckin' 
 Then we 
 Breathe in, breathe out 
 Breathe in, breathe out 
 We get, freak deaky, fuckin' up TV screens 
 Counter tops and coffee tables, butt cheeks on magazines 
 She feel my vibe, my dick is XXL 
 So of course I'm a source of flings, call me the king 
 First I lick her and fondle her nipples 
 While I tickle her kitty kitty for fifty 
 Might even blow at it, shitty shitty 
 And yeah we bang bang 
 Next week we'll do the same thang 
 Man up that's the game game 
 Dick is what I slang slang 
 See I don't slang caine 
 But I slang wang 
 Got lucrative businesses and up is what I've done came came 
 If you're dick hung down like your buckel, you would do the same thing 
 Knock out a main frame 
 I'm too hard to tame man 
 See it's not only their head boy 
 It's fuckin' up their respiratorys 
 3 at a time, that's another day another story 
 See I'm the kind to lay ya down and have ya pussy pourin' 
 Leakin' feenin' for the d, skeetin' fuckin' up your sheets 
 Beat it how it's supposed to be 
 Beat it in the [?] 
 This is what you supposed to eat 
 Swallow it, get a load of me 
 And yeah it's good for ya, protein is sibilance 
 Got different hoes in different area dividends 
 And you can ask about me, even your ho tell ya 
 'Cause she familiar with how I pump up paraphernalia 
 Say you be short dawg, they say you a fuckin' failure 
 She asked me not to but fuck it, shit I'm gon' tell ya 
 [Break] (x2) 
 Satisfaction guaranteed baby 
 I promise I'mma give you what you need baby 
 (Tonight's the night) 
 This is the night 
 I'mma blow you mind 
 Let's get it now 
 (Breathe in, breathe out)
