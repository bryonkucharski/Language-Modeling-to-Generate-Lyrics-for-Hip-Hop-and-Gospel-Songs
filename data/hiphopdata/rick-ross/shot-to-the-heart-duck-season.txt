(Feat. Lil Wayne) 
 Lil Wayne: 
 Since I've lost you I'm lost too 
 Nigga feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe 
 Sorry for the trouble that I put you in your heart too 
 God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2 
 Hard to be friends for the day you come back to me 
 Sayin' that you forgive me 
 Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney 
 I don't want a advance 
 Give me back her hands give me back her touch 
 I don't ask for much, but I fucked up 
 I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up, but everybody fucks up 
 Now this southern nigga lucked up 
 Telling me and my click don't give a fuck 
 'Cause I'm from new Orleans, she was from Georgia 
 She was my down chick, I was a soldier 
 I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder 
 You were the pistol to my holster. Bang 
 (Hook: Lil Wayne talking) 
 You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show 
 Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control (I see you hiding it mama) 
 You Got It Down, And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (You doin' your thing) 
 But There Is Something You Forgot 
 Lil Wayne: 
 You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring 
 I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing 
 I remember the love right after the fight 
 You can't tell me you don't remember those nights 
 And if I would cry, you would cry twice 
 To me you were the brightest star under sunlight 
 Take away my title, take away my strength 
 And give me back my girl and you give me back my life 
 -Give me back my girl and you give me back my life- 
 See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice 
 Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight 
 I remember the time I wish I can bring it back 
 What she means to me is what I mean to rap 
 (Hook: Lil Wayne talking) 
 You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show 
 Always Trying (I see you hiding it mama) 
 To Keep It Under Control (But I know you know) 
 You Got It Down (I know you do) 
 And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (But I wish you nothin' but happiness) 
 But There Is Something You Forgot 
 Lil Wayne: 
 But I hope you haven't forgot about me 
 Up in the living room watchin sports center 
 You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner 
 But the lord is a forgiver 
 You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered 
 And your boyfriend is not like me 
 Why you even go and get a _ like me 
 I remember we would sit at home all day 
 You called me butter, I called you babe 
 My momma asked about you, my partners did too 
 I know your daughter will be so amazing like you 
 And I know you probably wish you never met me 
 And I just wish you never forget me 
 And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with 
 No engagement can amount to your friendship 
 And I hope that nigga know he got a queen 
 And all I can do is dream. Damn. 
 I've Been Lonely 
 I've Been Waiting For You 
 I'm Pretending, and That's All I Can Do 
 The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart 
 Rick Ross: 
 I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal 
 To tell the truth I don't know how to feel 
 Never felt alone in a room full of friends 
 Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense 
 Pray for me, patience wait for me 
 Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin' 
 Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes 
 And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops 
 Now we lookin' at each other, sittin' in a court room I'm laughin', 'cause it's lookin' like a cartoon 
 Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo? 
 (Somebody switch) by my rules we all lose 
 (Hook: Lil Wayne talking)

 Rick Ross: 
 Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life 
 But they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light 
 Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers 
 Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers 
 Smellin rose on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed 
 Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin mail up 
 Clothes come from big 'n' tall ...? 
 Got live life, I'm tryna live life, 
 Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice 
 Convertible to the cars, 'cause I murdered all of ours 
 Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

 But There Is Something You Forgot 
 Rick Ross: 
 Fortune 'n' fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom 
 But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace 
 Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily 
 I know I'm under surveillance (I look at it as a talent) 
 Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin' I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen) 
 I started without a coin, not knowin' which way I'm goin' 
 Now I'm chatering boeings 'n' readin a few poems 
 Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light 
 And I never felt this way bout anything in my life 
 Determined to be the best, not lookin' back at regrets 
 How many people you blessed is how you measure success 
 I've Been Lonely 
 I've Been Waiting For You 
 I'm Pretending, And That's All I Can Do 
 The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart
