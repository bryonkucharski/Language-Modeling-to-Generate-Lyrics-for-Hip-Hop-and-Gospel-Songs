I whip my heron with milk 
 All my boxers be silk 
 You pussy niggas should chill 
 We keep the city on tilt 
 I put on for my wolves down for my area code 
 We hit a lick, you go to prison -- gotta bury your dope 
 Respected highly, my nigga 
 Joey i.e., my nigga 
 So high with my niggas 
 Selassie ahi, my nigga 
 I recite only lethal, yet I'm labelled a poet 
 I get high in the cathedral and I feel so important 
 How I'm popping them bands, you man just won't stop 
 I fucked her in France, came out on top 
 If she wanted a bite, if she named the spot 
 But me being the boss, I took her straight to Wingstop 
 They itching, they itching, they itching for that paper 
 My fingers, they itching, they itching for that paper 
 Riding 'round the city and I got that calculator 
 I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper
