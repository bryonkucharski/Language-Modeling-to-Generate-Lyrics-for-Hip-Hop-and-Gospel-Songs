 We them niggas at the park, we just wanna ball 
 Sellin dope, we get a car and don't know what its called 
 Nniggas foul, but the referees don't get involved 
 It's the finals, and my dogs came to take it all 
 With the her-ion, nigga I'm Lebron (HUH) 
 Quarter millie for my car, and that's on the Quran 
 You running with me nigga, or you better run two 
 Ties for you pussies cause you know who number one 
 These bitches all on my dick, is it all of my cars, 
 They say my Audemar sick, just bought a? 
 This a ten million flip, so nigga fuck what you talk 
 100 million off the rip, the definition of boss 
 She can tell how I'm ballin, dat I'm just gettin' started 
 Yeah I took an advance, put 20 keys in the projects 
 Had to scoop my lieutenant, had to make my deposits 
 Niggas DIEE everyday the time choppa comes out the closet 
 And I pride myself, I'm gettin' money in the street 
 I ride myself, I'm the one you gotta see 
 I bring it straight to your door, do you like it Manolo 
 When you flashin that money, them people flashin your photo 
 Know I'm fuckin' these broads, 'cause I'm flashy as fuck 
 Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck 
 Fi-Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck

 (Meek Mill) 
 Hatin' wid dem bitchs, dats a flagrant foul 
 I'm posted with that china white, the smokers say its Yao 
 A nigga play, I want his head I'm talkin' 80 thou 
 I tell my shooters go get em, they go make a cow 
 Ridin' in a wiz a fortune, then I made a vow 
 I will never let these rapper niggas take a stow 
 My dogs karate chop them bricks, then they take a bow 
 Throw a banana in the air ak then I make a smile 
 Blake Griffin on these niggas, rookie of the year, 
 This ordinary shittin on these niggas 
 And I heard that they be hating, I ain't trippin' on these niggas 
 Make it rain all these hoes, havin' it drippin on these niggas 
 Ya

 30 pair Michael Jordans, is what they cost me

 (Gunplay) 
 My track got umps, jumpin' until it needs a crutch 
 Got birds flyin around, like mr 23 himself 
 You want to eat, I got the food 
 Nigga come and see the chef, 
 We ain't playing by the rules, put the toolie on the reps 
 Scored a foul line nigga, payin' high by the high now 
 When I get the Gucci, only 3note is the dial now 
 Skunk screamin loud, tryna speak a whole sound now 
 My heart so hard, the cookie need a powerdrive 
 I'm triple a arrogant ass attitude 
 100 down south, right down the last avenue 
 This the dead end, gotta kill to fit in 
 So pop your act and move it, if he can bring the shit in 
 Lebon 5.0's white tee, hood rich 
 I got cheerleaders too, and everyone a hood bitch 
 And a whip the color the yayo, n that mutha fucka foreign 
 Whi-whi-whip the color yayo, n that mutha fucka foreign
