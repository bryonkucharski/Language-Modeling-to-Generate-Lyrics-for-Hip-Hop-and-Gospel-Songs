I woke up working like I'm Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline 
 Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel 
 Got my drink on the rise, got my house on the hill 
 Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real 
 And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill 
 After bill, but I still pay respect to my city 
 So much man you thought I was in debt for real 
 Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill 
 I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will 
 Good music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye 
 Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay 
 I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay 
 I'm higher than day-day, no off day just pay day 
 Boy, since I was a bae-bae I swear was OG, you was a no G 
 Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's 
 When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G 
 Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares 
 About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair 
 And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled 
 You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed 
 While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes 
 Going to the same club, taking the same pose 
 Pillow talking with the same hoes 
 All day about how find 'em and Hov hit the same hoes 
 Some niggas never grew up until they grew old 
 I guess that what coming up in Detroit do 
 Finally famous is a Detroit crew 
 Fuck with me and you'll destroy fool 
 End up on the fucking Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo 
 Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this 
 Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus 
 Fuck am I saying, Jesus had Judas 
 I guess I'm alright thought if I just got you, bitch 
 You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz 
 While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin 
 That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10 
 Sean don 
 I woke up working like I'm Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline 
 They done fucked up now, haha 
 Mastermind 
 My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white 
 I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice 
 My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bi-language 
 Some call it tricking cause this bitch thicker than Trina 
 Anybody wanna motherfucking die? Come try me then 
 You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho 
 Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz 
 Coming through and I don't fuck with niggas 
 Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga 
 Good chance she done fucked a nigga 
 Turned around and said fuck that nigga 
 Stack on my belt, double M we a cult 
 Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought 
 16′s of coke, all my verses be dope 
 Fuck XXL 'cause I'm The Source to these quotes 
 I woke up working like I'm Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline 
 I've been held from ten to tens, swear I won't sin again 
 Bring the Hell to my residence, godly presence with presidents 
 My day job, it made me shit, public housing ain't got no fence 
 And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick 
 I did work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue 
 One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo 
 I got one mountain, one problem, plus the issues, I can't solve them 
 But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin' 
 Nigga please! Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred, shit 
 Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million 
 Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion 
 Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write 
 Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy 
 God damn, how you do that? 
 I woke up working like I'm Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
