(Hook: Pharrell) 
 I don't tick so I'm the shit just like a presidential, I roll around 
 The time is ours it's really ours 
 Take off the H it's really ours 
 Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high 
 Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high 
 Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high 
 Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high 
 (Verse 1: Ross) 
 You know the crib on the water now 
 The Maybach stay watered down 
 Project niggas giving orders now 
 The gold presidential just to sport around 
 I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars 
 Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads 
 Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling 
 Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling 
 Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me dap 
 Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap 
 I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek 
 Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released 
 Bitches, they keep coming, Billie Jean thumping 
 I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning 
 I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something 
 I could ship her something, you know that December coming 
 (Verse 2: Rockie Fresh) 
 I'm a young fly nigga just reppin for my era 
 I be touchin hella bread like I'm workin at Panera 
 Got a bad bitch with me good green with me 
 Travelin' round the world but I'm comin' from the city 
 Where Kanye did it, Lupe did it 
 Now Rockie Fresh is the next to get it 
 Fresh pair of Jordan's and my White Sox fitted 
 New gold Rollie that was Rick Ross gifted 
 Playin' in my mind day dreaming about a time 
 When I get a track with Pharell 
 Thinkin' that'll be dope as hell 
 I started layin' verses and makin' these rappers nervous 
 I love God, but I could never work at a Church's 
 I'm just buying chickens purses 
 Hangin' with the best set 
 Shorty love the way I be swimming in that wet-wet 
 I keep them flyin' in my bed that's where she jet set 
 Smokin' with my bitch while I'm thinking of my next check 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 They see me leanin' in some new shit 
 Now it's gold Presidential's for the crew shit 
 Three songs, weed crumbs on the cruise ship 
 I'm a boss have your ass on a news clip 
 She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch 
 Ponytail red nails still in school bitch 
 Needed some cash so she ask me could she move shit 
 Not a chance whips got her talkin' foolish 
 I was skippin them classes, but I got me a master 
 I was gifted at Math always counted the fastest 
 Fish scale made me major profit margins 
 I'm a profit stuffer from my pockets, you niggas starvin' 
 Lord forgive me for my sins I'm with this pretty bitch 
 80 grand rubber band for some silly shit 
 She on that Alexander Wayne 
 Gold Presidential VS when I change the game 
 (Verse 4: Rick Ross) 
 She want to roll with a winner now 
 So I let her roll with the windows down 
 My niggas up the road come and get it now 
 60 40 low we split it up the middle now 
 Shorty send the word I was talkin' that talk 
 Maybe link up in New York that's awesome as fuck 
 I've never been in love until I heard the beat 
 She never met a G until she heard of me 
 Third floor projects feel my point of view 
 Everything's number two that's when it come to you 
 Isabel Marant sneakers till the summer through 
 Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do 
 Baby girl got that wet wet, I repeat wet-wet 
 I'm the boss and I'm on that
