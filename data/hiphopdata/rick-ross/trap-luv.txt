(Intro: Yo Gotti) 
 I'm in a jungle 
 Lions, tigers and gorillas and shit nigga 
 It's a lot of monkey ass niggas out here too 
 'Lotta hustle nigga 
 Rules, laws, strategy 
 (Verse 1: Yo Gotti) 
 10 million dollars later I'm a blessing nigga 
 How a nigga rich but still stressing nigga 
 Glock .40, Smith and Wesson nigga 
 Streets will never ever stop testing niggas 
 Youngin' give 'em a head shot, send a message nigga 
 Part rapper, part goon, still finessing nigga 
 I believe in hustle I don't fuck with luck 
 And it's fuck 'em kill 'em all if they don't fuck with us 
 Them three letters mean a lot boy, sacrifices 
 Cocaine Mafia, double check the prices 
 Niggas killing niggas like they got a license 
 Niggas crossing over like they Allen Iverson 
 Fuck that iPhone 6, they be tracking niggas 
 I'm about to get a beeper, fade to black on niggas 
 Gotti, goodnight, I'm gone 
 I be back when they quit living through phones 
 When niggas put the gram down and pick the grams up 
 You got follows but no dollars man that shit ain't adding up 
 Nah, and all the dirt I done, all the bricks I sold 
 I can't sleep at night, paranoid it shows 
 I be strapped on stage, fuck the award show 
 'Cause I shoot this bitch up and only God knows 
 (Skit) 
 Yeah like I told you a long time ago fam, y'all gon' hold it against you. I keep fighting doing this to y'all. Every time I get something in the mail whether it's favorable or not from the courts, I keep putting it down because y'all are my motivation. I appreciate the love 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Niggas riding gold rims and they mama po' 
 And they kill a family member for that envelope 
 I'm the Lionel Richie to these Commodores 
 We flip pies to franchising Dominoes 
 I speak for dope boys every track I'm on 
 Until this day my people never rat or told 
 Posted 20 in, I'm talking fed pen 
 The line between us both have gained so very thin 
 Amongst my boys of W.E.B. Du Bois 
 Souls of black folk to hustle wasn't a choice 
 Rap game everybody skimming off the top 
 Fuck interest as long as you pull it off the lock 
 Hoes on the fuck, haters wanna hate 
 Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan 
 Double M no longer that Buick Regal money 
 Nickel rock niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it 
 Negotiating for it or either we take it 
 Niggas even shooting choppers in a fuckin' cadence 
 Fell out with some people that I still love 
 I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood 
 I remember counting cash standing in the trap 
 I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks 
 60 m's later and 300 tax 
 Still losing weight with the south on my back, nigga 
 I pray you play by the rules 
 I came so close to the edge 
 (Outro: Rick Ross) 
 Ain't no mercy young nigga 
 It's the jungle, locs 
 And I pray you rich forever 
 Gotti, I pray you rich forever 
 All my niggas I pray you rich forever 
 When you smokin' and you vibin' to this shit 
 I pray you rich forever my nigga
