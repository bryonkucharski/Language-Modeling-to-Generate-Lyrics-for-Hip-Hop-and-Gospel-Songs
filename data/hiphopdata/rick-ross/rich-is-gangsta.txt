If you don't know 
 I'm finna break it down 
 I just upped my stock, fuck them cops 
 If you love hip-hop bust them shots 
 Your man is priceless, if your man's loyal 
 Better give that man a raise your end up paying for it 
 If you cut it, call it Jam Master Jay 
 No Adidas but I rock a brick a day 
 Talk about the jewels outta reach 
 Nigga please, so I came back with a bigger piece 
 You still smokin' weed on your car chase 
 I'm pullin' off the car lot screaming: "God's great!" 
 Before the crib you gotta clear the guard's gate 
 Elevators like Frank's on Scarface 
 New Presidential had that pavé 
 Like a G, I gave the Cartier to Wale 
 Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover 
 Told Warner Brothers that the game's over 
 For me to move forward from here on I need 50 
 I ain't talking 50 Cent neither nigga, haha 
 I came back a rich nigga 
 Young mogul, Bo Jackson, I'm a switch hitter 
 They want me face down on the pavement 
 Gang members claimin' I need to make a payment 
 It's hard for a young black executive 
 Can't you see we're all fucking relatives 
 Relatively easy we can go to war 
 Fuck it, we can go to war 
 Chasing me a hundred million, that's inshallah 
 Fresh up out the Feds system, welcome home Jabar 
 I watch him pray five times a day, nigga 
 Same one that used to moved the yay' nigga 
 AK's in his heyday, nigga 
 Benz coupe, wood frames, low fade, nigga 
 Got the cubans, got the boats, got the zoes, nigga 
 Cocaine worth much more than gold, nigga 
 So what's your goals, nigga? 
 All my shit went gold, nigga 
 I remember smokin' mid grade 
 Till I went and got my shit straight 
 I'm spittin' like this bitch a mixtape 
 Till they seen a Ghost with a temp plate 
 Sittin' in the trap blowing thick smoke 
 Trafficking my dope, with a thick ho 
 Feds tore apart the squad, nigga 
 That's why I had to play the part, nigga 
 That wasn't me, it was a job, nigga 
 It gets deeper, that was just a start, nigga 
 Screamin' in my sleep, I know Lord hear me 
 Death to you fuckboys, on my 4th Bentley 
 Gangsta, nigga 
 Rich is gangsta, nigga 
 This is gangsta, nigga 
 Yeah, rich is gangsta, nigga 
 You know where we came from 
 Look where we at
