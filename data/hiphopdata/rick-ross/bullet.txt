When you say in your mind that it's all the time 
 And you hope that you floated through the larger line 
 On the gaudy side of town 
 On the gaudy side of town 
 I'm not your money man 
 A thin coated satellite 
 And you wouldn't leave me, would you dear? 
 Not tonight 
 We see your back and forth 
 Fear in the company now 
 Put some fear in the company now 
 Don't lose your cold dear 
 Fear in the company now 
 Keep it right 
 She come in alone 
 A firestorm 
 Waitin' on a spark 
 Leaving me alone she feels it after dark 
 Keep it down boys 
 The fire inside 
 Figure it out sort it out 
 Your foot in the mouth
