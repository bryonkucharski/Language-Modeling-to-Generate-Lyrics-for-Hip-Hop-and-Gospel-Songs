The day you decide to get you some money 
 Nigga fuck your friends 
 Ain't no friends we ain't even on that 
 All these niggas taking Instagrams, selfies 
 Point me to the money 
 Point me to the money 
 Business, big business 
 Maybach business 
 If you ain't with it I don't fuck with you 
 You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money 
 Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed 
 My brother caught a L and I still write him every month 
 He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk 
 I wonder why, I wonder why 
 I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why 
 I wanna shine just like the summertime 
 They say them folk gave him a heap of time 
 Nappy-headed nigga, pocket full of crack rock 
 Nineteen, living like a fucking rap star 
 Watching from my porch you thought it was a fucking film 
 One day he buy the car, next day the fucking rims 
 Curly-headed bitches, tall and they slim 
 They know I'm [?] but see I know it's him 
 Never testify, I seen it in his eye 
 Attempted murder on his life in that 360, ah 
 With my two eyes 
 Two different pistols 
 One with registered and one to get your issue 
 I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why 
 All this fame and fortune leave you traumatized 
 You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money 
 Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed 
 My brother caught a L and I still write him every month 
 He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk 
 I wonder why, I wonder why 
 I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why 
 I wanna shine just like the summertime 
 They say them folk gave him a heap of time 
 Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker 
 Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker 
 Stand your ground, stand your ground 
 Stand your ground, you gotta stand your ground 
 Got on my hoodie and my motherfucking Desert Eagle 
 You wanna do me, then you go and tell the people 
 Knock me down, temp drops as the sun rise 
 I could see a hustler in my son's eyes 
 I never knew that money bring so many enemies 
 Dreams come true, they dream of killing me 
 But it's fuck 'em and I feed 'em fish 
 Them killers coming, 'X' you off the list 
 Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker 
 Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker 
 Stand your ground, stand your ground 
 Stand your ground, you gotta stand your ground 
 You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money 
 Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed 
 My brother caught a L and I still write him every month 
 He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk 
 I wonder why, I wonder why 
 I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why 
 I wanna shine just like the summertime 
 They say them folk gave him a heap of time 
 (Okay, they're having trouble hearing you, so take your time) 
 Creepy-ass cracka 
 And then he said [bleep] 
 (And he's still following you?) 
 Yes'
