 I am absolutely positively on my grizzy 
 Even though I'm sick and I'm tired I gets busy 
 Started a 62 but it ended up a Frisbee 
 And me I like to sit at the stove until I'm dizzy 
 Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me 
 Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me 
 Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me 
 (I'm fed up, I'm fed up) 
 I give it all up before I let the fame get me 
 I got niggas tryna sue me bitches tryna do me 
 Way these niggas actin' you'd a thought they never knew me 
 But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me 
 I'm fed up probably why I'm actin' like the old me

 Get ya out the white house go back to your efficiencies (suckas) 
 Suckas feel me and I know you haters hear me

 And when they give ya they shoulders never cry on 'em 
 And when they love you to death just never die on 'em 
 And the question still remains 
 Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain? 
 Niggas dedicating overtime to damaging my name 
 And somehow I'm still the hottest mufucka' in the game

 I'm tired of these haters 
 That's why I go hard like A.C. Slater 
 Weezy Baby here, y'all prenatal

 Uh I'm sick of being criticized 
 That's why I'm higher than a Star Trek enterprise 
 I do it big don't get mad cause you minimized 
 I keep a red flag case I get penalized, uh 
 Its young money like you didn't know 
 Stop playing I hit Drizzy with the give and go
