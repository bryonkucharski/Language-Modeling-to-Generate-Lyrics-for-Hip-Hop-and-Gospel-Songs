You are really not all that dope 
 You are really not all that dope 
 No-no-no no-no-no 
 No-no-no no-no-no 
 You read me all wrong, Bello 
 You need to do your research 
 An emcee with a 4-song demo and you've got t-shirts? 
 Hell no. 
 I don't want to do a CD trade 
 I want to see your made-for-TV DJ fade 
 Into the rave scene it seems he just came from 
 Glow sticks and energy drinks 
 Gettin' hyped up on white stuff 
 Never meant to be sniffed 
 You like dust? 
 I might bust your whole family 
 But y'all ain't hippie chicks 
 And pixie sticks ain't nose candy 
 You're servin' bags with herbal magic 
 Sellin' placebos to too many people 
 Got your girl's ass kicked 
 Your lady got overpowered and you got played sellin' baby powder 
 It's over-the-counter drug trade 
 Oh, you a big shot? 
 Now you hip-hop? 
 Shall I stop? 
 Nah, I think not. 
 I rip shop like parking tickets 
 Use sling shots to target bigots 
 'Cause I don't really kill cops 
 I just want you to think I it 
 You are really not all that dope 
 You are really not all that dope 
 No-no-no no-no-no 
 No-no-no no-no-no 
 DJ Undercutter 
 He wants to feed his turntable scraps 
 To MC Hollywood who's only fly until his cable snaps 
 He's a rapper thinking battles were a meal ticket 
 Came time for the album and he couldn't write real lyrics 
 8 Mile wasn't true, shit head 
 It was a promotional tool, but not for you, shit head 
 So let me tell you exactly what to do, shit head 
 Don't be a fool, stay in school 
 Shit head 
 You are really not all that dope 
 You are really not all that dope 
 No 
 No 
 But am I really all that fresh? 
 But am I really all that fresh? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 Fake friends ain't got nothing to do with my world 
 If you ain't dead, you ain't a suicide girl 
 You can tattoo that to your back with the broken wings 
 Then hope for the best while you jump from buildings 
 I wanna levitate like the featherweights huffin' helium 
 And float outta this place if I ain't fuckin' feelin' em 
 They need to study lessons and then posse up 
 Fuck an Apprentice, I've got more firepower than Donald Trump 
 BB Gun, one hand on the pump 
 When I run outta' ammo Ima slap shot this hockey puck 
 Soccer moms are copulatin with hockey dads 
 Housewives wear maternity dresses like body bags 
 They pull out novelty dildos as a party gag and dilly dally at a women's rally where they lolligag 
 Y'all wear poetry around your neck 
 It's an outdated laminate and they can't make it to sound check? 
 You wave your new jack flags like a late pass 
 "Oh, they ain't all that bad" 
 Nah, they just fake jacks 
 They've got a new street slang? 
 Oh, I'll keep current 
 No command of language but they act like they're deep 'cause of it 
 Fuck a Def Poet and all the concessions they make 
 I just filled another pinata with demo tapes 
 I'm gunnin' for you, chump 
 With a triple barrel shotgun 
 Don't try to cover up, 
 My nipple grabs are AWESOME 
 Shooting all the midgets and I'm shooting all the midgets 
 Shooting all the giants and I'm shooting all the giants 
 Yo, peep this, Ladidadi 
 I hate party people 
 Hate the way the DJ just plays pop when he drops the needle 
 I don't want to socialize with guys that I can't speak to 
 Or women who are see through 
 'Cause I don't need to.
