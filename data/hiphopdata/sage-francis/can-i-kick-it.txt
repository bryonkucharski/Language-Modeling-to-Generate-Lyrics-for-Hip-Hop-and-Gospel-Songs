Can I kick it? (yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (yes you can) 
 Can I kick it? (yes you can) 
 Well I'm gone (go on then) 
 Can I kick it, to all my people who get wicked like Sage does 
 Before this did you know what my real name was 
 Paul Francis acting like he's on the same drugs 
 Never even felt the authects of a strange buzz 
 You never ever catch me holding a beer mug 
 Your talking shit like as if you was a real thug 
 If that's true lick a shot BUCK feel the slug 
 That's what you get for totin guns like you were Elmer Fudd 
 I'm selling tapes for three bones wanna catch a dub? 
 This shit is dope kid it makes you wanna cut the rug 
 Illuminati's got every part of my body bugged 
 The micro chip is in your wrist now give it a tug 
 Be nice to females, give a bitch a hug 
 Triple X styles comin' cleaner than your tub 
 You better tell your girl about it because she's a scrub 
 A big brow never had a nip in the bud 
 Droppin' me her seven digits while I'm in the club 
 Talkin' bout I look I need a back rub 
 Son she's a natural disaster like a flash flood 
 I ain't playin' dawg you better go test her blood 
 Until your positive she's negative don't make no love 
 With or without a glove, you know what I'm speaking of 
 The cub scouts try and jump into the briney shrubs 
 Behind the bush turn a back push into a shove 
 What you thinkin' tryin' bring the underground above? 
 AOI make you cry like a dove, for that shit, for that shit
