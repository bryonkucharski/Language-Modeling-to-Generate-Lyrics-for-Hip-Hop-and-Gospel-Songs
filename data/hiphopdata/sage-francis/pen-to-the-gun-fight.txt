(Sage Francis) 
 Condoliza Rice I don't need your lies your jittery when under attack 
 It's funny at least for you to lie through your teeth cause there's a credibility gap 
 Got big Saddam but we missed Bin Laden and Bush still ain't found no weapons 
 Headline "WE GOT 'EM" is still a big problem in Iraq there killing Americans 
 I thought the war was over we're sending more soldiers something just wasn't done right 
 Tell bush he could of, should of, would of, maybe next time bring a pen to the gun fight 
 Motherfucker 
 (Nirvana Sample) 
 Nothing on top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds 
 There's a lot up there but don't be scare, who needs actions when you got words...
