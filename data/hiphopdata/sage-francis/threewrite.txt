This is to the (uh-uh) intertwined souls 
 The hands I've been trying to hold 
 This is to the (uh-uh) love that I lost 
 And all the troubling thoughts of how I got double-crossed 
 And this is to the (uh-uh) divorce I was forced to settle with 
 And the remorse I fought off with metal fists 
 And this is to the (uh-uh) wet, watery kiss I left you with 
 On your porch while I watched your trembling lips 
 This is to the... memory of our early years 
 The first girl I shared feelings with 
 And it's the realest thing I'd experienced in my short existence 
 And I ain't afraid to admit 
 Cause love is one of the things that doesn't come with an age limit 
 Now does it? In fact I'ma have to say I'm more keen to feel such things 
 Hopeless things I'd lost in a smokescreen of meaningless fucking 
 Touching without touching, candles in the dark 
 Casting shadows on our parents battles, this is for the romantics at heart 
 It wasn't too long before I held you more then my pen 
 When I wasn't writing songs, it was something like 
 "Forever and always, whenever those songs play..." 
 I remember empty hallways 
 Or your image that descended from the top floor became an echo 
 I paid the price for those hard things, and couldn't afford to let go 
 From a passive debt, I'm past regret 
 Did you know I dreamt about you before we met? 
 Remembering our first kiss, and it hasn't even happened yet 
 Recollecting your scent, and I wasn't even given the chance to forget 
 I guess that's the magic of it 
 Now every rehashed subject's displaying what I wrote 
 On cafe napkins to the public 
 To get it over and done with, closure hath cometh 
 My shoulders have plummeted from holding these buckets 
 Hold your laughs till I go back to the tunnels of Paris 
 Where I wrote half of these paragraphs... but fuck it 
 This is to my ten year story, in another decade 
 You better be better prepared for me 
 In the first four years, you were all ears 
 Then the next six, you left me for the next exit 
 With depth to my message 
 So that began my affair with the world abroad 
 Behind the curtain with the other hurtful girls I explored 
 Until I became the monster, turning to the words that I record 
 Pardon me, if you heard it all before 
 "I didn't shake you to hurt you" 
 When you landed on the floor 
 In a room of naked virtues 
 I closed my eyes to cancel what I saw 
 Your hand made the first move to the handle of the drawer 
 Where the frail girl couldn't think to live 
 "I didn't shake you to hurt you" 
 I never planned it before 
 I can't shake off your perfume, can't wash my hands no more 
 And I'm breaking my curfew, but I can't walk 
 I'm standing at the door, I hear the wailing of a little kid 
 ...And the failure of innocence 
 His compromise eyeing the side of the kitchen sink 
 What'you think, I just let you cut you, cut me-- cut the bullshit 
 Damn, I love the hugs enough to tolerate 
 The way we made each other crazy, making it so tough to operate 
 Productively, my self esteem didn't help when I felt ugly 
 And I figured that's the reason why you wouldn't touch me 
 My ego does bleed, I shouldn't have let you test it 
 And let your arms free to follow through with your domestic slip up 
 Love is a battlefield so lick your shots quick 
 While I lick my wounds and then resume as an obvious target 
 Infatuations with the past protect my Purple Heart with 
 A faded picture I had in my shirt pocket 
 I'm going out with a bang... 
 In a blaze of glory holes, the anti-hero 
 I don't care how many ways the story's told 
 Be careful when these doolies play like drums 
 And be careful what you say, because my uzi weighs a tongue... 
 This is to the sleepless evenings that I spent next to grave stones 
 Hoping someone from beyond would grab my arm and take me home 
 I hadn't accepted I'd have to make it alone 
 After feeding everything I had into a payphone 
 And this is to the rain... 
 I felt like it was made of spit 
 My parade was an unbreakable chain of Gabe's trumpets 
 Save the buckets even though they weighed down my walking 
 You don't know the height of the steak you place your fork in 
 You look old (that's what you said) 
 I feel old (that's what I said) 
 I been through a lot since you been gone, dead, born again 
 Torn to shreads over girls who were porcelain 
 The cry-baby dolls, when we were allowed to talk again 
 I stopped accepting wake-up calls (that ring true) 
 I hate the way I fall for everything you do 
 Our fate is flawed, that's why I make these break-up songs to sing to you 
 Music is my only psychiatric drug 
 And you're a pill in human form I'd like to hide under my tongue 
 Kiss the foot that couldn't fit into the slipper of my mouth 
 The denizen in your house begging for the benefit of your doubts 
 When I got kicked out, I played the faithful puppy dog 
 Loyal to the love alost, sitting at your fucking door in utter disbelief 
 I sucked all of the skin off of my teeth 
 You pulled away, you let me choke on your invisible leash 
 You can find me hiding these screams behind my eyelids 
 She blinded me (she blinded me) with silence... 
 So my air-mail lips blew her a fairwell kiss 
 Slinking over the sink, where all the hair gel drips 
 Stairwells dip deep into her mouth where I found a cycle 
 And ever since then, I've been on a downward spiral 
 This round is final, it's time to recover 
 Because it's a porch that some dogs choose to die under 
 The first song was a breakdown, I apologize in round two 
 This version I'm certain, this shit ain't even about you 
 It's the threewrite...
