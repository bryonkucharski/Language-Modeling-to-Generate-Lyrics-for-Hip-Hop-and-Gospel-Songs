And you'll know it was me by the trail of demos 
 Spare me the details, e-mails, memos 
 Dookie-gold chain letter to whom it may concern 
 Put this around your neck until your hangin' on my every word 
 Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots 
 I'm the DIY artist with thick grass roots 
 Had a couple managers as a youth 
 I was too young to know better but I was like 
 "What does a manager do?" 
 Now one of them he saw dollar signs in my skin color 
 The other, he said to keep it undercover 
 Post-VIP posse, pre-Internet Nazi era 
 Powers of suggestion suggested I be what I'm not, and that's not me ever 
 From Lasienega to Meadowbrook Drive 
 Never looked surprised 
 Cut to the chase with metal hooks and knives 
 Now it's battle time, I stepped in the arena 
 Thirteen-year-old gladiator freak with a fever for the flavor of a fight on the mic 
 +Follow the Leader+ 
 Mr. Chuck was the surrogate father 
 KRS-One, the teacher 
 There I was, sneakin' into clubs 
 Beat an emcee to the punch over instrumentals dubbed 
 From tape deck to tape deck 
 Pause tape mix at breakneck speed 
 The only whitey in sight 
 That doesn't make me realer than you, or faker than you 
 But I'm authentic, forget it 
 Started breakin' rules 
 Ten years later still hadn't stopped 
 Won the biggest battle in a Metallica shirt before the album dropped 
 A week later, smashed the trophy at a show 
 It was takin' up the space that I needed to grow 
 Pop pop goes the weasel (the weasel) 
 Drop drop goes the easel (the easel) 
 This is hip-hop for the people 
 Stop callin' it Emo (waah) 
 I know a kid who thinks he's hip-hop 'cause he buys it 
 I know a kid who thinks he's hip-hop 'cause he never buys shit 
 Underground or mainstream 
 Some are bound to change teams 
 Y'all weren't doin' this dirt 
 When Jeru +Came Clean+ 
 Before the Freddie Foxxx conflict with DMX 
 Around the time when Jay-Z and Nas' girl had sex 
 I used to wake up every morning on a hard wooden floor 
 Livin' in Brooklyn with a car I couldn't afford 
 And if I wasn't hangin' out in front of Fat Beats records, 
 I was in the factory, mailing out my 12-inches 
 Nowadays, the DJs don't even spin wax 
 So fuck a promo copy, buddy, you can download the track 
 Seratooo promo-sexual laptop 
 A hollow existence in a bottle 
 Ya sip-sip then swallow 
 I tripped quick, then followed a path that made sense 
 Started out with a live band then worked with turn-tablists 
 Now I strike a match with the back of my front teeth 
 And light up the stage with just speech 
 I remember the days Ken and Dave let me crash on their couch 
 And I saved what I could and put the cash in my mouth 
 When I played in my hood I had a fraction of outs 
 Till Atmosphere put me on and now I'm packin' the house 
 Since the mid-80s this has been a game of cat and mouse 
 It's funny hearin' all the shit these rappers brag about 
 Knowin' all of them are walkin' around with massive doubts 
 Talkin' 'bout it's only status and platinum plaques that count 
 Pop pop goes the weasel (the weasel) 
 Drop drop goes the easel (the easel) 
 This is hip-hop for the people (the people) 
 Stop calling it Emo (wah) 
 Irony is dead, it's so motherfucking dead, I was there by its deathbed 
 And the last words that it said (Was what?) 
 Was "Whiiiiite booy" 
 I'm +Still Sick+ with an independent record label 
 I built quick just when I got +Sick of Waiting Tables+ 
 Then in the blink of an eye I +Waged War+ 
 +As a Known Unsoldier+ with a soul you can't pay for 
 I ran a business on my own two legs 
 Known to beg if I needed to with Home Grown bootlegs. 
 Cut and paste images of my face and then sloppily placed 'em in a case. 
 Strange Famous! I stayed +True when School was in Session.+ 
 Went to college to buy time-that shit was expensive. 
 So I shamelessly self-promoted 
 The radio station would open doors and opportunities 
 Eventually made it to Oakland 
 Where anticon. accepted me with open hands 
 +Journals got Personal+ on a one dollar advance. 
 Non-Prophets! We had a hope that a UK label smashed 
 So I crossed out my eyes and signed to Epitaph 
 This is the hustle of an emcee 
 The +Distrust is Healthy+ 
 In a dirty industry where the promises are empty 
 I'm more honest than friendly 
 More handsome than sexy 
 Let me bring you up to speed, +Humans do a Dance that's Deadly+
