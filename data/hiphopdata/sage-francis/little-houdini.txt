Christopher Daniel Gay was arrested on a Friday 
 In Florida at the Daytona International Speedway 
 He was a fugitive on the run, 
 Christopher made a quick escape 
 While being transported in a van 
 That was picking up convicts state to state. 
 He did it during a bathroom break, 
 He hot-wired somebody's pickup 
 In fact, 
 Christopher had a long history of theft 
 Involving trucks, 
 He was on route to Alabama 
 For stealing someone's travel trailer 
 Grand Theft Auto 
 He was a career criminal, jailbird 
 Who also had three outstanding warrants 
 In his home state of Tennessee 
 It was an outstanding performance that set him free 
 Little Houdini 
 Stole a big rig, then a tour bus that belonged to Crystal Gayle 
 To evade a five state manhunt that wanted to put that birdy back in jail 
 But they failed 
 ... 
 'Cause Christopher wasn't just running from cops 
 Christopher Gay was now racing a clock 
 His mother was dying 
 And there was no time to be held 
 Inside of a cage with locks 
 So y'all can turn up your nose 
 And suck on your teeth and wag your finger like tsk-tsk 
 But he had to take the risk 
 Little Houdini 
 There wasn't a single thing sinister in his decision 
 To break from the prison 
 His only motive was to go back to his childhood home 
 While his mom was still living 
 It wasn't a house 
 More like an old mobile camper 
 Where she was bedridden diagnosed with colon cancer 
 Sometimes, 
 The only answer we're left with 
 When the loved one's name is on the death list 
 Is to head for the exits and go home 
 Christopher got the hell out of Texas 
 His abandonment was reckless 
 It prolonged his sentence 
 Y'all can forget it 
 He had numerous convictions and none were as strong as this 
 Unless you consider the other instance 
 He went the distance 
 Similar situation, it was a bizarre coincidence 
 When he escaped from the prison the first time, 
 Not this time, but the one before 
 He visited his dad 
 'Cause he was dying inside of a mental ward 
 Suffering from Alzheimer's 
 He paid respects 
 Made his peace 
 When he was done 
 He didn't run 
 He returned himself back to the police 
 That's when his mom made her plea 
 She said: 
 "He knows what he done was wrong, 
 But he knows his father don't got long 
 He's not a fugitive on the run 
 He's not dangerous, he's our son 
 He ain't never hurt no one 
 He knows what he's done was wrong, 
 But he knows his father don't got long 
 He's not a fugitive on the run 
 He's our son" 
 This ain't no country western song. 
 Christopher wasn't just running from cops 
 Christopher Gay was now racing a clock 
 His mother was dying 
 And there was no time to be held 
 Inside of a cage with locks 
 So Y'all can go on tossing rocks 
 And talk your talk like tsk tsk 
 Meanwhile Chris is stealing a tractor trailer from Wal-Mart 
 An 18 wheeler, he's peeling rubber the bird takes flight down turnpikes 
 Three hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise, but it ain't worth her life 
 Ran it off the road, and abandoned it 
 50 yards from his moms to avoid the cops 
 That's half a football field from her feeble arms 
 After all this stuff 
 The tour bus, the pick up trucks 
 The tractor trailer, interstate chases 
 He put on the brakes and couldn't get close enough 
 The news reporters told people to lock their doors 
 Like there was a monster on the loose but there was no truth to those reports. 
 His mom had weeks to live 
 And Chris had years to serve 
 They were within shouting distance 
 But I don't think he heard her final words. 
 I don't think he heard her final words. 
 She made her plea to the TV 
 "He knows what he's done was wrong, 
 But he knows his mama don't got long 
 He's not a fugitive on the run 
 He's not dangerous, he's my son 
 He ain't never hurt no one 
 He knows what he's done was wrong, 
 But he knows his mama don't got long 
 He's not a fugitive on the run 
 He's not dangerous, he's my son" 
 This ain't no country western song. 
 The third time he escaped from a state cop at the Georgia pit-stop 
 He just slipped out of the handcuffs, he jumped ship then he took off 
 With no father to visit, no mom to go home to 
 Just an open road where he could be free 
 Little Houdini 
 With no father to visit, no mom to go home to 
 Just a wide open sky where he could fly 
 With no father to visit, no mom to go home to 
 Just an open road where he could be free 
 Little Houdini 
 With no father to visit, no mom to go home to 
 Just a wide open sky where he could fly 
 With no father to visit, no mom to go home to 
 Just an open road where he could be free
