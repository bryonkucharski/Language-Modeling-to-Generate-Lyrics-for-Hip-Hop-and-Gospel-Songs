(I talk a lot of shit, but I can back it all the fuck up) 
 I don' talk about it really, but I'm still the illest 
 Still the baddest 
 Bless the apparatus I got silverback gorilla status 
 I pull the one red string that runs through your mattress 
 And make your bed springs sing a song of sadness 
 Sad sack of shit, pack your things and go 
 I'm hopping freight trains with nothing but a bindle (no hobo) 
 Little homie said 
 YOLO 
 - no props 
 I photobomb your photo ops busting out the robocop 
 Teach me how to dougie, kid, I'd rather do the knowledge 
 Now go home and get your shine box, you got a couple shoes to polish 
 Undergrad, this ain't no humblebrag 
 I've sung one too many Johnny come latelies, now baby come to dad 
 'Cause he don't need no cheat code to go beast mode 
 All he really needs is a M-I-C to freak flow 
 (I talk a lot of shit, but I can back it all the fuck up) 
 I'm a runner up, if I'm not top billing, I'm show stealing 
 Sistine chapel vandal type, tag the whole ceiling 
 Sick of hearing rap with no feeling 
 Sick of trauma porn addicts thinking they're poets, that's not soul bearing 
 Break yourself, fix your face 
 My heartbeat breaks the 808's, now update your database 
 So many rock random tapes, but not enough functional dual cassette decks 
 Who will you sweat next? 
 Stupid, I maneuver through a school full of rednecks 
 Some people I was cool with despite a few death threats 
 Sacrificed a social life, food and some rent checks 
 So I can grab a mic where the hell ever I like, and catch wreck 
 Yeah, I've got swung on from time to time 
 Been cornered in some clubs just for speaking my mind 
 Mental midgets couldn't come up with the lyrics and rhymes 
 Now I'm back popping more shit than ever and I'm fine 
 Find me if you need me, son, I'm easy to locate 
 You finally gon' feed me then I'm eating that whole cake 
 Got license in movies and TV, that's so great 
 Don't break your coatnail trying to throw weight, okay 
 Curb stomp your enthusiasm 
 Don't expect resolutions just cause every movie has 'em 
 Don't expect revolution from the music 
 That is solely created for the sake of booty clapping 
 Fool, keep rapping 
 Release the kraken, beat back the back beat 
 Planning instrumentals, running my mouth at the track meet 
 My victory lap shows no mercy in this dojo 
 Spinning back, kick the Willie Bobo 
 Sweep the head, breaking bread with the best of 'em 
 Crumbs are left under the table for the rest of 'em 
 I don't speak in metaphysics 'cause I'm not a metaphysicist 
 I'll diss the living shit out of these so called lyricists 
 Fuck y'all 
 (Y'll don't like it, kiss my ass you don't like it, this my house 
 'Cause we don't need no cheat codes to go beast mode 
 All he really needs is a M-I-C to freak flow) 
 Excuse me for having ethics, I don't eff with little toys 
 I learned to scratch on phonographs [?] 
 A killjoy, crying over spilled soy milk 
 I destroy the shit brick house that you droids built 
 You walk tall till I kick out your stilts 
 Buff till I call your bluff and pull up your kilt 
 You've been padding your resume 
 While I've been rhyming about life like I'm rapping my death away 
 Stay well composed, figuratively, literally 
 They prefer a hashtag to metaphor, simile 
 Brag-rap to poetry, backtrack to symphony 
 Sweet talk the sour puss press and push bitterly 
 The kids are getting degraded, they ain't diminish me 
 Oh uh, but they prefer the skinny me 
 I'm an emotional leader of the emcees who sit in salt 
 Fuck being complicated, Uncle Sage is difficult 
 It's a cult of personality stuck in a false reality 
 It's all a bunch of mall punk and dance club rap to me 
 Swagger jacking, black cracker, battle rap is gone minstrel 
 Born on third base acting like they hit a triple 
 With a wiffleball bat walking pretty, talking pretty 
 With no act, in fact, it's all theory 
 I promised you death threats, don't actually kill me 
 But bite my dog, I'mma scratch your kitty 
 It's like that, y'all, it's like that, y'all 
 It's like that-that-that, it's like that, y'all 
 It's like that, y'all, it's like that, y'all 
 It's like that-that-that, it's like that, y'all 
 Talk shit
