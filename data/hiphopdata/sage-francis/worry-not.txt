Worry not, keep your stress in check 
 Anxiety's a disease, you gotta learn to live with it 
 Cancer spreads, it'll eat right through 
 There oughta be a quarantine for people like you 
 I keep clenching my jaw while I sleep 
 I ain't got no dental insurance, so I purchased a mouth piece 
 It helps me collect all my teeth, 'cause they keep falling out in my dreams 
 Repeating each step till I'm knee deep in sweat 
 Till you need deeper sleep between sheets who need sex 
 If you need to eat meat then just feed on the flesh 
 If your will power's weak seekin' ye shall find death 
 It'll rent it'll lease it'll own you 
 You can't teach new tricks to no old fool 
 I've been banned from the bible 
 But I stand on my own two 
 Runnin' from something my legs have no clue 
 Bur nin through every last nerve that I got 
 This condition is more than deserved but I'm not 
 Killing the time I'm ringin' it's neck 
 Chokin it out and I'm stealin' its breath 
 Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss 
 To the caution I tossed to the wind like this 
 Worry not, keep your stress in check 
 Anxiety's a disease, you gotta learn to live with it 
 Cancer spreads, it'll eat right through 
 There oughta be a quarantine for people like you 
 Oh you're scared of the dark? then sleep in the light 
 You came for the bark but then leave when I bite? 
 Breakin' a sweat, 
 Your faint and awake wit a fang in your neck 
 And a pain in your chest 
 Losing your power your drained and your wet 
 When you threw in the towel I caught it like rent 
 That was well played - you ain't self made 
 You went from daycare to preschool from K-12 grade 
 And that's hardwiring in your brain 
 Not to mention the rules or the house where you stayed 
 Synagogue mosque or the church where you prayed 
 As a child tamed like your wild! 
 Reprogram - DEPROGRAM 
 There ain't nothin' they say we don't know man 
 They been preyin on vulnerable people 
 And claimin that everything in us is evil 
 I see them in hell then - but until then 
 You should chill friend (Just chill!) 
 Play pretend with the forces of organized 
 Superstition and get played in the end 
 We were killing the time I was ringin' it's neck 
 Chokin it out and then stealin' its breath 
 Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss 
 To the caution I tossed to the wind like this
