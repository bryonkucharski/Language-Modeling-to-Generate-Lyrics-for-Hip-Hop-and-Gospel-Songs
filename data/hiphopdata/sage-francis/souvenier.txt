You don't want me here, now do you? 
 You don't want me here 
 You don't want me here, now do you? 
 You don't want me here 
 You don't want me here, now 
 You don't want me here, now 
 Now you don't really want me 
 From what I hear my extra baggage is a turn off 
 My carry on luggage gets smuggled in the bags under my eyes 
 I'm a travelin' man 
 Without sleep on my itenerary 
 I eat whatever's vegetarian 
 I'll live with vegan, that's my saving grace 
 I gave up chase in the human mating race 
 'Cause I can't slow down my aging face 
 Wrinkles become my road maps 
 And my one last tire is going bald 
 Rubbing it when checking messages 
 Knowing no one called 
 I trooop on 
 On the road again 
 Tired of what I wrote 
 I spend one more quarter to phone a friend 
 And hold a pen up to the receiver 
 Lettin' the ink seep into their ear 
 Waitin' for any intelligent speech, they've got to share 
 Most people can't think deep, but I don't care 
 I'm not concerned with them 
 I've learned to fend for me, my own 
 And I've got a lonely girlfriend back home 
 Who makes me feel a lot better when I return 
 I'm waitin' for that "Dear John" letter 
 I'm gettin' her a souvenir 
 You don't want me here, now do you? 
 You don't want me here 
 You don't want me here, now really? 
 You don't want me here 
 You don't want me here, now 
 You don't want me here, now 
 You don't really want me 
 Too much time all by myself 
 I've been around others I do not? 
 These personal moments feeling about as meaningless as phone sex 
 Don't stress me living in your condition 
 As still I'm that reason for that whole mess 
 I'm not in need of shelter 
 I'm just homeless 
 I'm a homeboy who's homely 
 Never known to be a homebody 
 Nobody knows the amount of body blows 
 Or head shops at they got at rest stops 
 I gotta go let's ride hip hop shows? 
 Let me download you on my desktop 
 I keep it real audio 
 Let's talk before the phone card expired 
 Or let it know I'm far from wired 
 Why? 'Cause I just rocked that show hard 
 And I'm tired 
 Use a Gold Card to buy her a silver lined dark cloud 
 When it rains, it pours, it's hard out 
 But I fear that it may have dried out, pied out 
 I lay down to earth girls who say "stop" 
 When they realize the only reason I'm outta this world is 'cause I'm a space shot 
 These relations aren't making me feel any better 
 When I return I'm handing her that "Dear Jane" letter 
 I done got her a souvenir 
 You don't want me here 
 You don't want me 
 We're all rock stars 
 We do big drugs 
 And we have big heads 
 And we have big sex 
 (Come again) 
 X3 
 You don't want me here x6 
 Cause you don't want me 
 You don't want me x5
