You gave me language as a gift, I turned it against you 
 I was stupid, I was young, I was hanged by my Judas tongue 
 You shouldn't give weapons to kids that don't know better 
 I can't possibly understand that there's no such thing as forever 
 For every letter in the alphabet 
 You said connect 'em to a happy word, no matter how bad things get 
 I did my best, but the pickings got slim 
 Once I arrived at "X" and I had to think of synonyms 
 Weight 'em against the antonyms, I was hanging with all the mannequins 
 Who are on a constant search for a person's amputated limbs 
 Almost offered up my own, trading in my arms and legs 
 You said learn to express yourself if you're gonna stand for things 
 I stood up with that expression, stood up against everything including you 
 I was stupid, I was adolescent, but I had your lessons to cling on to 
 And I want you to know how much it helped 
 Considering everything that I'd gone through 
 It was a period without periods, run on sentences were like binges 
 I was a comma with no cause, a rebel with no clause 
 Anxiety is no excuse once there's nothing left to separate 
 We could have connected, but didn't 
 I was ignorant, passed out on the spacebar 
 The further we drifted apart the closer 
 I came to realizing just how amazing you are 
 Now that you're gone I'mma say it to the stars 
 Till my words knock worlds off their axes and the universe collapses 
 Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire 
 For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass 
 For the wheel even if you didn't invent it 
 For the impact that you had on me, it's epic, thank you for the effort 
 For teaching me the ABC's even if I never make my way to "Z" 
 Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me 
 Thank you 
 I was a stupid son of a gun with initials carved into me 
 I was a stray, a runaway, afraid someday you'd shoot me 
 So I scratched off the letters with a pocket knife 
 It's how I loss my way when I was tossed into the fray 
 This is not my life, who am I kidding, it's a thank you note 
 Disguised as a written apology for everything you taught to me 
 So awkwardly I approach the open microphone with everything that I wrote 
 Clear my throat, adjust the collar on my coat 
 As I rock crowds, microphones and boats and then I stroke 
 Whatever little ego I have left, I should have left it at the alter 
 But I didn't 'cause I'm an idiot, self-deprecating author 
 With a paperback edition that isn't worth a flip through 
 If I don't give you the credit that you deserve 
 You edited the words from the grave and beyond 
 From the first sign of sun raise at dawn 
 Till the moonbeam set blaze to my lawn 
 The universe collapses on my front steps 
 So we get to share in that moment, for just one moment 
 And nobody's upset, there's no more anger, there's no more sunsets 
 So I crawl back in the chamber, you can shoot me up 
 You might as well, we had great communication before the tower fell 
 Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire 
 For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass 
 For the wheel even if you didn't invent it 
 For the impact that you had on me, it's epic, thank you for the effort 
 For teaching me the ABC's even if I never make my way to "Z" 
 Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me 
 Thank you 
 I'mma do my best, while you rest in peace
