Sage: 
 It's not that what we're doing is wrong 
 But let's try to keep this a secret 
 Between me, you, and the song 
 A menage a trois that sings to me 
 Sinfully 
 When god plays along 
 Jolie Holland: 
 What you want with a woman who won't do what you say? 
 Sage: 
 I was sweet on her 
 She was sweet on Jesus 
 We slept with a blanket barrier between us 
 Master of her craft, I had her laughin' like hyenas 
 When I asked her if she'd marry an elitist 
 Staggering genius in lace 
 With the grace of a drunken monk 
 The mask isn't seamless cause her face says something's up 
 But I don't dare ask her I just listen 
 Switchin to my good ear and adjusting my position 
 As she discusses Ginsberg I listened and learned 
 As she dispersed his words I just resisted the urge to do like he would 
 Whatever he wanted, if she allowed me to 
 She dangled that carrot then asked me: 
 "What would Bukowski do?" 
 Oh don't go there 
 He'd make you his mom and then completely lie about it in a book later on 
 Jolie Holland: 
 Got up this morning 
 Didn't know right from wrong 
 Sage: 
 Spirits were lifted when she whispered something French in my ear 
 Tension was there 
 When I responded in English it sounded less sincere 
 The sex in the air couldn't be left alone 
 So welcome to the Terrordome 
 A bedroom full of pheromones 
 Where nothing that we say is set in stone 
 If I thought it was for posterity I'd already be writing better poems 
 But I'm talking in extremes 
 Best this and best that 
 Best not regret anything that ever gets said to this hell cat 
 Creepin' on all fours 
 Ready for combat 
 With secretive wars sneaking her claws in our contract 
 Bending every which way but loose with no proof that anything that we've suggested to this day is the whole truth 
 Jolie Holland: 
 Got up this morning 
 Didn't know right from wrong 
 Sage: 
 I heard her chemical romance was a medical slowdance 
 Said my advance was sexual 
 Held my genitals with cold hands 
 Set up the Coke cans 
 Broke out the Red Ryder 
 Then one by one I tried to knock down everything that's dead inside her 
 She used to treat street dividers like a balance beam 
 Arms spread wider than the legs in her dad's magazine 
 Re-enacting the pages that she got trapped between 
 I used it for kindling and then spilled the gasoline 
 Now I'm your water boy 
 I fetch it from your cheeks just like tennis balls 
 Smell the stench of your weakness on the bedroom walls 
 Somebody careless let 'em vaporize 
 "Who let these fall to the floor from your poor vacant eyes?" 
 Disintegrate 
 This ain't a great first impression 
 But I work better on pages, they say words are my profession 
 Let me spell it out in simple language 
 Plain English 
 I want your suicide to be a book of mine that I never finish 
 Jolie Holland: 
 Got up this morning 
 Didn't know right from wrong 
 What you want with a woman who won't do what you say?
