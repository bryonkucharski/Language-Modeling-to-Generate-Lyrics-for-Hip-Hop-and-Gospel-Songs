You can't make it to heaven with a high step 
 You can't make it to heaven with a high step 
 I played both sides of the field 
 I was better at defense 
 They put me out for special teams 
 The college league wasn't impressed 
 But the press called me a work horse 
 I ignored it like the crowd 
 I had calories to burn off 
 And I made my parents proud 
 A jersey with a number that concealed faulty equipment 
 A cog in the machine but the team saw me as different 
 Old beyond my years 
 My chest hair was like a carpet sweater 
 They made me leader 
 I wore that C like a scarlet letter 
 Whether hot or cold 
 I had to avoid the loss 
 And play better then the competitor 
 Whether or not I won the coin toss 
 I watched it flip in slow motion 
 While I considered the odds 
 But it's a sin to gamble 
 So I left the risk to God 
 We had a locker room prayer 
 Where we all lobbied the lord 
 I pretended to know the words 
 Bowed my head and mouthed along 
 That was my way then 
 I was a slave to the play pen 
 Where I tried to make friends 
 And couldn't wait to say "Amen" 
 Then hit the field 
 With a shield that was dented 
 And a sword that was warped by the wars that I've entered 
 I'm a veteran 
 With all this medicine on my plate 
 Because the game that we played 
 Was "How Much Pain Can You Tolerate?" 
 Can you do it without showing signs of it? 
 Without fooling yourself so you don't know when it's time to quit 
 Hell no 
 Well, Amen 
 Give me the pig skin, kid 
 I'm head huntin for Satan 
 Throwin' elbows 
 Till they're breaking 
 The coach made 'em look normal just by the that he taped them 
 I never went pro 
 I jgot paid in admiration and respect 
 But all of that seems to be changin 
 Tried to make it heaven with a high step 
 Tried to make to heaven with a high step 
 Tried to make to heaven with a high step 
 And get get it get it done 
 Before we reach sudden death
