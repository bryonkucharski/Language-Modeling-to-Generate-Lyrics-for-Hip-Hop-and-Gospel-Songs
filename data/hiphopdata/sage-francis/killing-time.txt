Yeah 
 Yo, this is Sage representin Secret Service, yo 
 Welcome to my world kid I've been waitin for a long time 
 You come with memories and leave with a free will and a strong mind 
 It's all fine I hope your girl came prepared 
 My facial hair is like a web I'm catchin knowledge in my beard 
 Not much is kept though, I let go into the dying hunger 
 I'm catching teardrops on my tongue from the crying thunder 
 Why am I younger than you thought I was? be patient 
 Soon enough you'll see through my physical into a soul that's ancient 
 My mental age exceeds my chronological it seems illogical 
 Full comprehension remains marginal 
 Fully phenomenal wait forever for invasion 
 Time, it ain't nothin' but an unsolved equation 
 My mind is a prefound universe filled with curse words 
 My rhyme is a release of peace thought as I disperse verbs 
 Design a plan of escape into oblivion 
 Seriously I can't withstand the land that we're both living in 
 Come with me and give me support, supply assistance 
 We'll drive the distance and probably die in the persistence 
 Of breaking free from the age old constraints 
 Infinity continues, the life force curls fate 
 The energy drains from the power surges, devoured the urges 
 The fear is primal when the final hour emerges 
 Procrastinate and wait until the last minute 
 My ass is in it, to win, for an infinite 
 Number of light years as I fight fears that I felt 
 Since time began let my mind expand with no help 
 Trying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine 
 Putting a chill in my spine, ready and willing I'm 
 Killing Time 
 Couldn't be no iller crime 
 Trying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine 
 Killing Time 
 Before I reach my prime 
 Killing time, Killing time 
 I grab ahold of the hour hand that's got too much power man 
 Devouring my hopes every now and then 
 I try to break it down again Go from plan A through Z 
 Smoothly my mission turns into a murder mystery movie 
 Move me into a better rap protection witness program 
 Don't understand Time is no time to have fear for no man 
 Your whole clan could hold scams I got schemes that ain't been tried before 
 That's what you're dying for I'm hiding from the law 
 Ducking cops, aimlessly bucking shots 
 Open one day for a lucky hit and time *ucking stops 
 Line up for props I'm out to get mine with a time-seeking tech nine 
 Get the job done before my deadline 
 My schedule's tight I'm knocking off years on my calendar 
 Decades of game play without a challenger 
 My excalibur is getting cold and rusty can't get a soul to trust me 
 Time took its toll and left me old and dusty 
 Whew! Blow off the dust mites I just might bust mics 
 Put up fights throw fisticuffs and thrust strikes 
 With enough might to hold it off in the meantime 
 'Cause Time ain't nice I'm climbing for life so I don't mind the price 
 I have to pay day after day to make the laughter stay 
 And teardrops fade away 
 Understand the plan, scheme, scam, and plot 
 Remove your lips from the bottle and your hammer from the glock 
 I'm tryin' to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine 
 Putting a chill in my spine ready and willing I'm 
 Killing Time I'm killing killing time 
 Trying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine 
 I'm Killing Time
