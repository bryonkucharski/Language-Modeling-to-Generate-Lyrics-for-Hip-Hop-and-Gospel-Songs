Fuck this sage francis faggot shit 
 Is this hip hop or a starbucks coffee shop 
 This is xaul zan, I'll show you how I do it in my neck of the woods 
 It's like... 
 You don't have to write a poem 
 I guess I just hate MCs who act like they're groggy 
 Grab the microphone 
 And resuscitate the life of the party 
 I got a right to be cocky 
 The girlies want me bad 
 Throw my blows and hockey dads give me herpes 
 I'll be mad 
 You turkeys lolly-gag, emitting the worst stench 
 I got your mommy gagged 
 And she's sitting on my workbench 
 Handed her a wrench 
 I let her work my nuts a bit 
 To have her thirst quenched 
 Yeah I let her take another sip 
 For the fuck of it I freaked the funk on 45s 
 Silly suckers think I'll sit just listening to all their jive 
 I'm the sort of guy to cook your family fix for dinner 
 I'll make your daughter cry when she wakes up 
 With some fingers in her 
 Listen to lynyrd skinner 
 I'll sell your pretty heart 
 Now let's tittyfuck while I get naked like iggy pop 
 She sees my mini-cock 
 She wants no small man 
 Runnin' around the city block, yellin' out... 
 It's Xaul Zan! 
 I sip from a tall can and take big gulps 
 The dodgeball champ, I'm the reason why your kid sulks 
 Feeding the shit out adults 
 Ripping the deeds to your house 
 And I'ma fuck you in your face till you bleed out your mouth 
 Smooth, not what I am 
 Rough... Xaul Zan 
 Smooth, not what I am 
 Rough... Xaul Zan
