Oh you wrong, you gots to get right with yourself 
 Sinner please, you could never get with the god 
 Oh you wrong, you gots to get right with yourself 
 Sinner please, you could never get with the god 
 Don't wanna fake that smile, don't wanna have that talk 
 Don't wanna make that child or let the suspect walk 
 Don't wanna take it to trial or settle out of court 
 Just wanna shoot down the stork 
 Don't want a long disclaimer as a preference to your short story 
 Don't wanna sum up in one sentence why your sort bores me 
 In fact, one more word out of you and the girl gets it 
 You're so bossy in a world that has no work ethic 
 So let's shake to that, don't wanna give you dap 
 Or figure out whatever hand dance you're bringing back 
 For I am not a tween, don't wanna talk with memes 
 Or let the internet infiltrate all my dreams 
 So what do I want? Want now? 
 To exercise my right to be hostile and drop trou 
 Hey, you, get off that cloud 
 You don't know what that technology allows 
 I don't wanna weigh it out, don't wanna be more patient 
 Don't want a bank account charging me for paper statements 
 Don't want no ancient astrology stopping me 
 From boarding the spaceship once it gets to our colony cause 
 All I ever wanted was space 
 Cause all I ever wanted was space 
 Cause all I ever wanted was space 
 Cause all I ever wanted was the place she feared most 
 I could mock a killingbird without dropping a single word 
 I'd flip the middle finger till he's stoughing in the herb 
 My catapult becomes a death wing 
 To a red phone in the west wing, y'all are soon to fall 
 For the oldest-known joke in the phone book (what the fuck's the phone book?) 
 That's like a black book for fat folks who don't cook 
 Pick-up or delivery? Sick of this chivalry 
 Just tell me what you're willing to give to me and we go from there 
 Well hello there, dressed to impress but going nowhere? 
 Well let's go there 
 Grown man flirting like it hurts him that he has to bother 
 Is that your baby-baby bubba, does he have a father? 
 Don't be insulted, that was off the top freestyle 
 Still battle rappers for the custody like Cleese child 
 These styles are fatherless, motherless, marvelous
