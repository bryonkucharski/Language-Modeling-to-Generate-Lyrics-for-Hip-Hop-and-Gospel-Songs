I got rap control with a whack patrol 
 In a industry where they give me cash for soul 
 I ain't buyin' into the fashion show 
 I got a big foot, I could kick your whole asshole. 
 Spaghetti, spaghetti, tuna casserole. 
 They force all their rhymes while I grab his balls. 
 They don't care what I have to show 
 I'm lucky if a single of my albums goes Gold. 
 Talkin' 'bout Platnium Plaques you hold? 
 Like McDonalds talkin' 'bout how many Big Macs sold 
 It don't matter, Fuck Yeah I jacked your flow 
 Ask Biggie and Pac how many raps you stole fucka. 
 I'm just having some fun 
 For real, I ain't trying to have beef with anyone 
 6 million ways to die, choose none. 
 I like 99 rappers but Jay-Z ain't one HIT ME! 
 If you hate Hip Hop I feel bad for you son 
 I like 99 rappers but Jay-Z ain't one.
