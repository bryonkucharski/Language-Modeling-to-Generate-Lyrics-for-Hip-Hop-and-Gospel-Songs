(Where have you been?) 
 I've been busy, get-get-get off my nuts 
 I've been busy, busy, doing stuff 
 Copper Gone, I had to take my time 
 To get my life together, put everything in line 
 Sage Francis, no need for me to tell 'em 
 I'm from the [?], I'm steady representing' 
 Strange Famous 
 And slow and steady wins the race, fuckface 
 This is a letter to the editor sent in an envelope 
 Sealed shut by some candle wax 
 Shipped by an olden only show pony, with a carry sack 
 The only thing that I overnight express is myself through song 
 But it takes too long to reach the intended listener 
 When it gets delivered wrong 
 Never knew the words to the school bus sing along so I stayed off 
 While I organized my chaos I was like "Biotch, bring it on" 
 Pick 'em up, your stupid self-esteem is low 
 Put 'em down if they're just feeling incredible about themselves 
 For no good god damn reason though 
 Never saw the need to boast 
 They were standing on the shoulders of a giant, so defiant 
 But his feet are so, Jesus [?] 
 Barely even know if it appears as if I hate your guts 
 It's just, both sides of my bed are the wrong one, and I'm always waking up 
 Plus, I don't care to defend sides of myself that I don't like much 
 I am what I am that's all that I am, bullshit don't got that right touch 
 Let the better half I punch, and push, and scratch it's way out 
 Get on all fours put a saddle on your back and let the pain mount 
 I'm off to the races, gentlemen place your bets 
 Running in circles, turning their heads, eventually you could break their necks 
 The bookie collects, don't play the victim when it happens 
 Lower the stakes before you try to burn the witches at 'em 
 It's the business of a Madam when the brothel has a profit loss 
 The best of the best survive the cut and the rest get auctioned off 
 They serve the Molotov, so Mazel Tov 
 Forefathers of stability in this industry have ridiculously fallen off 
 Chalk it up to blackboard, fingernail, crescendos 
 That was my jam when I was ten, but I was deaf though 
 I didn't understand that I wasn't landing a deal at all, it was a death blow 
 Whistling Dixie through a hell hole then I went pro 
 Active-Retro even though I paid my dues 
 Losers hate playing a game that they can't win so they always change the rules 
 And I keep up, putting coffee into my tea cup 
 Try to cut me down when I take a stand? Good luck 
 'Cause I got legs like a tree trunk 
 They say anger is a gift, I'm very gifted 
 And if ignorance is bliss then I'm a Sado-Masochist 
 Mastered the passion for the sake of stripping it from all its pleasure 
 Got a treasure chest collapsing under pressure 
 Get-get-get off my nuts 
 I've been busy, busy, doing stuff, Copper Gone 
 I had to take a minute to get my shit together 
 Otherwise I was finished, Sage Francis 
 No need for me to tell 'em, I tried to keep from yellin' 
 But I'm steady representin' Strange Famous 
 And slow and steady wins the race, fuckace 
 I been treating a vacant lot as if it's a destination spot 
 Picked a hell of a depression to set up my shop 
 Master of tragic-comic timing 
 Mellow drama you understood, a sensei to some 
 Hyperventilating praying for the end of days to come 
 By selling survival kits, New Testament bibles to Zionists 
 And training wheels to professional cyclists, it's like this 
 Plucking petals from your frame, She-Loves-Me-Not and goes nowhere 
 I pump my tires while you pump my brakes, I thought it was no fair 
 Spent several sessions giving away precious possessions 
 During an endless recession, turned repentance to oppression 
 Pressure into a permanent first impression 
 I'm the last of my kind so I side-step your health inspection 
 There's a difference between gambling addiction and making love to Lady Luck 
 Erectile Dysfunction and being afraid to fuck 
 The pressure's always building, I simply can't wait to erupt 
 Both sides of my bed are the wrong one and I'm always waking up 
 (Always waking up, always waking up) 
 They say anger is a gift, I'm very gifted 
 And if ignorance is bliss then I'm a Sado-Masochist 
 Mastered the passion for the sake of stripping it from all its pleasure 
 Got a treasure chest collapsing under pressure
