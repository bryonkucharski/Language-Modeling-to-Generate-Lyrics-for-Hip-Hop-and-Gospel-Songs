Birds and the bees 
 Nerds and mp3s 
 Surfing the seas of watermarked promo cds that leaked 
 Like best kept secrets ain't worth art thats physical 
 Hardcopy material given a proper burial 
 Long live the satisfaction that songs give 
 Records in my attic got scratched and haunted 
 Radio stations that are captured on my tape recorder 
 A long time listener, first time caller 
 Hung up for the last time 
 Nervous and out of breath 
 My writing had no purpose it was murder and lots of death 
 Turned to god and turned godless 
 The audience beneath the surface wanted death 
 It kept me honest 
 Truth be told never made a deal with satan 
 I turned my loose leaf gold 
 Got a carton full of songs sitting on the counter of a store 
 Shut them down now 
 Only looseys sold 
 I said 
 What the hell we gonna do now? 
 How many units can we move now? 
 They wanna make money money 
 But there's a limit when you keep taking honey from the house of bees 
 A lot of shit is out of tune since the weather started changing 
 The flowers are confused don't know when they're pollinating 
 They bloom before the frost get caught depopulation 
 Ripple effect the systems connect the scene started changing 
 Bees stop behaving in a way that made sense 
 Queens disrespected while the babies raid the nest 
 No defense the record store is under attack 
 The dj's a complete hack but none of y'all beeswax 
 The colony collapse when the label got sued 
 For the pollen on the track now its losing value 
 The music press the publicist deluded bad review 
 They plundered and ask but nothing but the hunger to consume 
 Mass produce mass appeal manufacture junk products 
 Static loops lack the real so the fans would rather shoplift 
 Sold the whole thing and forgot what it was 
 Now you got no sting and you're trying to start a buzz 
 Like 
 What we gonna do now? 
 How many units can we move now? 
 They wanna make money money 
 But there's a limit when you 
 Keep taking honey from the house of bees
