The sun flies through the sky leaves darkness in it's wake 
 And now I hear the hellhounds barking at the gate 
 To be honest sometimes I want you to relate 
 This ain't up for discussion it's not a topic for debate 
 Entrepeneurs that want to bottle up the hate 
 And slap a label on the glass so hard that it'll break 
 And if you break it you buy it and we sold it by the case 
 It's ok if you just try it you can hold it to your face 
 How close can you get without touching it 
 How far removed can you get from the public 
 Can you keep a secret? 
 If not, can you tie a slipknot? 
 Can you stand high up on this brick block? 
 Listen to the clock tick tock and switch gears 
 It's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 years 
 Are they all dancing now? Are you joining the party? 
 Are just celebrating your life just by destroying your body? 
 It's a part of your psyche that I want to sightsee 
 I don't need you as a tour guide and I don't want you to like me 
 I was voted least likely 
 That's it just least likely 
 So pardon me if I seem fiesty 
 Bite my tongue like a bullet take a pull from the peace pipe 
 Push past the low expectations of me each night 
 I leave light in my wake and I moonwalk across the floor 
 Until I hear the sex kittens all purring at the door 
 There's something outside that we all want 
 But inside there's an ex who marks a soft spot 
 Till it rots and decays and then no one else cares 
 It's been 7 8 9 10 11 12 years 
 Now I sell pennies to the well-wishers 
 I fish through the coinslots 
 I fall through a girls bait participate in boycotts 
 I demonstrate a demon's trade 
 With a face void of thoughts 
 If that don't launch a thousand ships 
 Than that's a helen of troy's loss 
 There's nothing in this horse 
 It's hollow it's empty it's entry will not be forced 
 Like an eyesocket stripped clean of tears 
 It's been 13 14 15 16 years
