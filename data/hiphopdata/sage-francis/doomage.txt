Y'all know good and goddamn well 
 You're fucking with a brother who ain't never had his hand held 
 And never seemed passed out 
 Rolling baby strollers over broken floating bottles 
 In a shredded forest with a dying shred of hope inside you 
 For this respect, I sweated and bled 
 And have yet to be discredited by what a critic ever said 
 We're unaware of his racial make up 
 We know he's an albino but can't science the face up 
 Never question what I am 
 G O D knows if you don't, you can never understand 
 So you need only know that I'm unrelenting 
 Nothing breaking, never ending, seldom bending 
 Cast shadows like light descending 
 Must not discuss divorce with the case still pending 
 But I got some shit to tell you on my next record 
 For now, we and Sage Francis connected and did 
 Damage, uh 
 Damage, uh 
 Wrote this one a couple days after Christmas 
 Hope is one struggled game that's persistent 
 0 plus 1 2, for Self, no assistance 
 Pistol clear before this new year existed 
 Somebody get the door, fuck it, let 'em snore 
 It's all been said before, buried in a metaphor 
 Lucy is Hip Hop, and Jacob's a prince 
 Sean is an old man, and Slug is a PIMP now 
 They say I'm buggin' because of the way I love 'em 
 Nervous 'cause I know I'll never make the perfect husband 
 What, they treat me like LL for art fucks 
 They hang out and argue about my clown thought and snort rocks 
 From the twin cities, call it the deuce 
 Skinny grizzly bear alcoholic on the loose 
 Sing with me, show your love, give me proof 
 Flip the switch to damage and make this planet move 
 Never intended on making records that seemed too slick 
 Peeps move quick from cheap music to G-UNIT 
 Weak bullshit pulls chicks, but Joe Beats flosses every day 
 Ain't he ain't talkin' 'bout my gold teeth 
 My hobo teeth is no sleep for seeking soulmates 
 Getting cold feet, if my queen don't awake 
 My feeble bones break, spines curve 
 (Now I'm serious) 
 People don't take time to learn outside the pyramids 
 What the dilly is? I'm unsure, but so sin surr 
 Get your hurr did, that ain't a perm, yo, that's a temporary 
 That ain't a wormhole, that's a cemetery where they bury the lies 
 I'm lampin', I'm cold, cold lampin' out in the snow, campin' 
 Cuttin' wires so your phone can't ring 
 You don't know a damn thing after your city gets undertaken 
 Pass me a sissy so sucka I'll slay him 
 Damage, uh, damage, uh 
 Dances, famine 
 Damper, dancer, Francis 
 Hah, MF Doom on the beat 
 Non Prophets, Slug and Ali 
 Together at last, like cocks and cunts 
 Yeah, let's fuck it up, clip that beat 
 You know, we're pretty much humanous 
 And that's where we'd like to work from 
 From that vantage point 
 Exactly and you know Non Prophets is spelled 
 Like you know, like P O R P H E T like meaning 
 Like Non Prophets, almost like a pun in the word
