I've been patient. 
 I've been a mental patient. 
 I've been a parental replacement 
 For kids sent to the basement. 
 I'm a has-been. I've been had. 
 I've become best friends with a pen and pad 
 Understanding the logic of an inanimate object 
 Standing in the projects with a sign around my neck 
 Saying "Show me my respect!" 
 They thought it as a setup, upset. 
 I've been unusual. 
 I've been an unusual suspect. 
 You're beautiful, just check 
 To make sure that you're musical on set. 
 I'll be back in a minute. 
 React to the limit 
 And find out if ya act offended 
 Asking me if you can kick it? 
 I said "No you may not." 
 Cause your flow just ain't hot. 
 So you busters stay shy. 
 What the fuck do they got? 
 Watch your mouth. What'd that bitch say? 
 That went way out. 
 No doubt hit by the ricochet. 
 Kids today. I just don't trust em. 
 When I have mine I'm a make him speak in rhymes. 
 He'll think that it's custom 
 I'll tell him that he's Muslim every Christmas 
 So on December 25th he'll be giftless. 
 Then I'll convince this dumbass 
 He's actually a witness of Jehovah, 
 Flip mat sheets on the sofa, 
 Have him bring fat chicks on over. 
 Give 'em drinks if they're sober. 
 We'll make some noise soon. 
 If she stinks up an odor, 
 Send it to my boys room. 
 This is my house. 
 You don't like it you can get the fuck out. 
 Cause under my roof, you live by my rules, son. 
 I make you want to bounce. 
 Sage Francis makes you wanna bounce. 
 Joey Beats makes you wanna bounce. 
 Non-Prophets weathered and deep cuts. 
 We send battle rhymes to shatter minds. 
 The Secret Service Crew 
 But they'll all fall through. 
 Non-Prophets. 
 If you're jumping up and down right now 
 Stop it. 
 I've made a man mad. 
 I've been a mad man. 
 I've been a goody two shoes 
 Who walks bare footed in a bad land. 
 I've been to Madison. 
 "What's up?" to my Boston heads. 
 I came to visit y'all 
 But you know me I got lost instead. 
 I toss in bed. 
 Keep myself awake at night. 
 Worried that I might not fall asleep 
 Until I see the light. 
 My friends wanna see me fight 
 'Cause I'm a Black Belt Karate Master! 
 I'd rather have my freestyle raps 
 Sale the party's laughter. 
 Plus I'm out of shape 
 And haven't trained in months. 
 Can't count how many times 
 My face has been punched. 
 I'm feeling cranial lumps. 
 They made you a chump. 
 I left you walkin' a course of 
 Mind anguish with sign language 
 Is y'all def or what? 
 That depends. You mean the d-e-a-f kind? 
 He must've read my lips so hard 
 That he was left blind. 
 I've never been signed 
 But I've been signed off. 
 'Cause I never rhyme soft 
 Or wore designed cloth. 
 Every time I cough 
 I swear to God that it's a cardiac arrest 
 Feel my chest. 
 Make sure it's not a heart attack. 
 I'm stressed. 
 It's rest that I probably lack. 
 Yes. I'm a full fledged 
 Over the edge hypochondriac obsessed 
 With cleaning the rims on my Pontiac. 
 Rollin' through the plaza asking 
 "Where tha party at?" 
 Come in hardly last 
 But hardly fat 
 Buying oil in Iraq 
 To get him violent 
 And his car keys back. 
 My wife don't want me back. 
 I want to hold her. 
 It's a shame she ain't been the same 
 Ever since I told her 
 "This is my house. 
 You don't like it, you can get the fuck out. 
 This is my roof, you live by my rules bitch." 
 She said I had to bounce. 
 Sage Francis makes you wanna bounce. 
 Joey Beats makes you wanna bounce. 
 Non-Prophets weathered and deep cuts.

 If you're jumping up and down right now 
 You missed the topic.
