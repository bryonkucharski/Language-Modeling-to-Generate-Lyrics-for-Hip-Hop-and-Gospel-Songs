(Verse One) 
 I didn't tell anyone about what I seen or heard that day, mums the word still 
 I'm scared to plant ideas into your head while your rebellious side is fertile 
 Hurdles are getting knocked down 
 I'm running a losing race 
 Your legs aren't the only ones marked up - how many dreams have you chased? 
 If I could have said this to your face maybe you wouldn't have to write like I do, 
 Except I use paper instead of my body now; it's something you might want to try too 
 From haikus to horror stories, it's something in our blood that we share, 
 Something in our blood that appears on the surface of our skin when we bring it there 
 My facial expression said I didn't care 
 Hate and aggression must've made an impression on the little kid who stared, 
 Sitting on stairs when I would bother to bring my skates 
 My feeble attempt at being a strong, big brother doing father figure 8's 
 Ripping my cape on the ground that it dragged on 
 Tripping on fate and hearing the sounds of a sad song 
 Listen, it's great sharing time now that dad's gone, 
 But what's with the choice of words? 
 Or the body parts that you decided to tag them on? 
 I'm a vagabond, who moved to modern day Babylon and then back again 
 With minimal contact and you know I can't ask your mom what's happening 
 You've got such beautiful gifts What are you doing ruining the packaging? 
 How ironic come to think I probably put this ink on my back for him 
 I want you to laugh and sing more, 
 But you dropped anchor in a place 
 Where dreams go to die and you're keeping your ass indoors 
 I'm asking for you to stick it out and see things through 
 You're asking for me to zip my mouth and keep it just between me and you 
 If I could have been there from the beginning if I could be there right now 
 If I could promise to be there when you need me, would it raise an eyebrow? 
 How would your body be different if I still dropped by for visits? 
 Is it my place to put a smile on your face? 
 Could I erase your body language telling you it's all been said before? 
 Or change the words you wrote, exchanging your scars for my metaphors? 
 I'd add them to my collection while smiling 
 Next time you want to paint with razor blades and need a canvas use my skin 
 (Verse Two) 
 Hiding your sins well, but I see the hell that your limbs speak 
 Tongue in cheek Lying awake in bed while other kids sleep 
 The strength of evil begins to keep your grins weak 
 No matter the length of the needle 
 Marking up one's body is so much more than skin deep 
 Feel the pin prick The grim reep what they sew and you're trained to say that you're fine 
 Your threshold for pain is greater than mine 
 So I'm waiting in the lines that you give me patiently, 
 While you get cut in the lines that THEY make YOU wait inin ways that they can't see 
 If there's a vacancy as far as room in your life goes, 
 Say it to me But don't do it with a knife under your clothes 
 Because the anguish of hidden skin is letting my ghosts be shown 
 Plus the language its written in hits especially close to home 
 I'm most alone when I'm out of touch with the people who feel this type of pain 
 You might just aim for a day that its raining to strike a vein to take my name in 
 Changing your uniform and altering your mind set 
 Has your pointer finger decided if it was a fault of his or mine yet?I bet 
 I know the dialect It's nowhere I haven't been before 
 With skin that's sore Battle scars that rise from our inner war 
 Are decorative medals of honor that our father decided to pass through inheritance 
 And it is repetitive when the kids head in the direction of evidence 
 Proving the pain and hurt is relative 
 All this pain and hurt is relative... 
 Fade to black
