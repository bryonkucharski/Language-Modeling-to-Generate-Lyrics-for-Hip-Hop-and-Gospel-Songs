Call me Xaul Zan, a person cursed to remain faceless 
 In a small van with curtains and it's her fame that makes this 
 Even more grand it's all planned, the worst shame is I'm paceless 
 Her doorman and I are on a first name basis 
 I kick the worst game in cases that are up close and personal 
 I'm the utmost personable person who won't converse when I don't have my curtains pulled 
 At least that's how I picture it.
