MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume 
 What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes 
 MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 Burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain 
 Listen, a lie is just a lie if you believe that they'll believe it 
 Otherwise it's some sly legal speak so we keep our secrets 
 Our rap lineup in a silk robe 
 They prance around the home like princesses obsessed with kissing every toad 
 But ain't no prince here 
 In fact, I had to slay the dragon I was chasing for the warts to disappear 
 And dissect the frog, cut through the fog and do my thing 
 In the land of the pigs, the butcher is king 
 This is two-hundred and sixty pounds of ground meat in a town sound sleep 
 Countin' cards while they count sleep 
 Now I'm on a sacrificial lamb, it's collapsing an iron lung 
 Had to remove the mask and ask what kind of trash am I among 
 Caught in the widow's web the black spiders spun 
 Taking a beating so ancient that it's basically a tribal drum 
 I'm seeing stars and constellations 
 Seeing warning signals in the Universe's dashboard they're all saying 
 MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume 
 What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes 
 MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 We'll burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain 
 Paint me like one of your French girls 
 Use my neck as a scratch poster, rip out every last one of them red curls 
 Knit me a sweater with the intestines of attention whores 
 Of no expectations of the tribe I'll have to settle for 
 Circular logic is foul talk, mental sex for sport 
 Abuse me like customer support (I'll be your tech support) 
 I'm sorry to hear you're having problems 
 It must be difficult, let me see if I can help you like--figure 'em out 
 Have you listened to Biz Markie's "Just a Friend" 
 Have you tried turning me off and back on again 
 If you Make-A-Wish on a foundation there's maintenance required 
 All I ask is you be careful when you state what you desire 
 They say Satan is on fire without breaking a sweat 
 All that pagan shit is tired so I'm taking a rest 
 I met my date at the pyre she was shorter than I like 
 But wore a dress that's as long as the night, then I saw the light 
 MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume 
 What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes 
 MAINT REQD, push through the pain 
 What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame 
 We'll burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain 
 Yeah, I'd settle on a bed of rusty nails instead of roses 
 'Cause a song by any other name is so earnest, so forth 
 So what, I got blood on my mattress 
 Got a harem full of knife throwers who use my back for target practice 
 I fucks with them [?] types 
 Inherited this cutlery along with the scars, they all look alike 
 Used to write confessions in between the lines 
 And used to wear long sleeves so no one else could read my mind 
 Now I exercise my right to bear arms when I write words 
 The last polar bear taking a last stand on a melting iceberg 
 Where nothing is exclusive-when holding confidence 
 Sex could get abusive-but everyone consents 
 Anything that's lucrative-gets reduced to checks 
 And now you're wondering where your fair share of the bit of profit is 
 Sorry kids, the piggy banks depleted 
 Had a million dollar smile, but not the pretty face that's needed 
 I've seen torture but I've never tapped a bottle or twisted the cap whenever they passed the forty 
 I'm fat boy disorderly nothing fun about obesity 
 But recently, I toyed with it morbidly 
 Cordially invite you to the incredible, mind that bends metal 
 No spoon is safe, no fork is too special 
 Essentially we all know how the story ends 
 How heavily the plot twist depends on a little bit of 
 Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance 
 My house bitches lololololololololol
