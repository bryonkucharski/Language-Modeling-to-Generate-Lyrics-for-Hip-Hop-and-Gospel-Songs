(A Healthy Distrust) 
 The force of my love was strong. The sea lion lay down long. Song in the air. Why should singer care? When singer can be among song.

 Ma, Ma--look what I did, Ma. Look what I did to my hands, I broke 'em. 
 You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel, didn't say how to hold 'em. 
 Didn't say give away every piece of the puzzle till I was left with nothin'. 
 But I took it upon myself to crush it up and distribute the dust. 
 Get in the bus. Hop in the van. Jump in the water. Crawl to the land. 
 Build another castle out of the sand. Break it down and then I get into the saddle again. 
 Goin' city to city - I'm already lost. Tell the boss who is new in town. 
 I'ma ride this horse till it it bucks me off and I'm forced to shoot it down. 
 I'ma take him out for some gasoline. I'ma trade this cow for some magic beans. 
 Make mom proud of the deals that I made, 'cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed 
 But I'm glad that I never passed the genes, and I never put down the axe. 
 Piano man got a checkered dance floor to grace and a painful look on his face. 
 'Cause the crowd is packed and the louder they clap 
 The less he is able to make the connection between what he sees 
 When he hears certain notes and the hurt that is shown in his facial expression. Ah. 
 Don't need your "go ahead" to go ahead. Now, I know no one said it was gonna be easy, 
 But sweet Jesus who wants to sleep with me? 
 Way too many moves to learn. Not enough people to put 'em on. 
 Look it, mom! No hands. I built this suit of armor with wooden arms.
