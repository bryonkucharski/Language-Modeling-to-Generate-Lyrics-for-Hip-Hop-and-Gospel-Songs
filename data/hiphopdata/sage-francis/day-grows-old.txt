Build up your saliva and get ready to kill the fire 
 Spit in the face of figure heads, give 'em a taste of the shit I said 
 Build a place for children to escape 
 The inbred human race of living deadbeat 
 Dads milking the motherless childcare system 
 Let the sleepers have another nightmare from Christian conservatives 
 They don't fight fair and any religion would murder kids 
 If they don't quite care about the condition 
 Of the prison where we're serving bids 
 Once I escape my skin cell I won't be banging on the bars of soap 
 That I dropped into my living hell 
 The seemingly indestructible knuckles of my fists are clean 
 Keeping eyes wide open and bulging out like Mr. Bean 
 Misdemeanors made to look like felonies, the prison queen 
 Is existing in his own filth and feeling no guilt it seems 
 It's a dream with cheetah speed we're chasing after 
 Some are running quick, track teams want me to lead but face the fact 
 I can't catch up to it 
 Pace at your own pace on this race track 
 You'll eventually get lapped on your last leg while stretching 
 My aggression is just a lack of serotonin 
 Plug the jack of your telephone in to the wall 
 So I can call your bluff just to say what's up, how ya doin' 
 Now I've ruined the beautiful sound of silence 
 Won't get quiet until the voices in my head come down with laryngitis 
 Talking, talking, talking, talking, so much to say, so little sense to make 
 Bedposts get chopped off once innocence gets raped 
 Close the curtains and drapes, pull down the blinds 
 Cover your ears, block your nose and mouth, shut your eyes 
 There's a black box in my head which is actually read 
 When I crash and burn it keeps a record of every last word I said 
 It goes "one" for the finger, fuck, two for the peace sign 
 Three strikes, you're out, Casey's at bat with unloaded guns in his mouth 
 As the day grows old 
 We pave this road 
 When we take control 
 We will save your soul 
 As the day grows old 
 We pave this road 
 When we take control 
 We will save your soul 
 And it burns just like that famous ring of fire 
 Sing to inspire, try to loosen up the dirt that clings to the tires 
 Establish some traction, lingering behind the curtain of satisfaction 
 I'm certain of nothing, Mr. Knew it all 
 Late for my disorientation, fate glued to the wall 
 The pain felt could make the brain melt 
 Heard the shackles on the ankles, mistook the sound as sleigh bells 
 Remember that song called "Big pimpin'" 
 It made me want to dance around but I had no type of rhythm 
 Then I thought I should write a song called sick pimpin' 
 'Cause I know a lot of beautiful psycho inspiteful women 
 Now I'm that cat that tiptoes on this pads 
 With the gauze on track and so as not to cause damage 
 Hello, Miss Management, time decision making process 
 Trying to catch the breath I couldn't find till I lost it 
 Stand upon a rock I couldn't climb if I tried 
 With a fist full of issues, a bag full of pride 
 Well alright, I'mma write all the problems on the board 
 If anyone can answer 'em, I'll let them drive my Ford 
 I quit searching for the truth 'cause the truth can change 
 It all depends on how the furniture's arranged 
 If you don't take a moment to sit in the chair 
 Then there wasn't any point of ever puttin' it here 
 And I'm lovin' every minute as the day gets vivid 
 While I'm twistin' up the lyrics of existence 
 And it goes, one for the wife and two for the house 
 Three strikes, you're out 
 Now please remove my life from your mouth 
 As the day grows old 
 We pave this road 
 When we take control 
 We will save your soul 
 As the day grows old 
 We pave this road 
 When we take control 
 We will save your soul 
 As the day grows old 
 We pave this road 
 When we take control 
 We will save your soul
