She's a fairy with broken wings 
 I used to watch her perform 
 And if she hears me I hope she sings songs 
 That had me going right back 
 Couldn't find anyone in town to talk 
 'Bout how no one like that 
 Should be confined to the ground we walk 
 She glides but just seems like she floats 
 And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke 
 She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke 
 She cries but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope 
 On the East side hustling discussing things that we quote 
 In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats 
 We choking' on confusion 
 Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats 
 Trading in our cheap jokes for her C notes 
 I see notes being passed 
 I ask to see what these creeps wrote 
 Define silly kids and flying privileges revoke 
 Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't transcend 
 Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely can't skip down 
 She's held down by the transcripts my hands grip 
 Tried to tie her wings back on before the ones again clip 
 Panic stricken, shell remain stuck 
 On a Titanic sinking, she's trying to stay up 
 Change her plan thinking its okay 
 See this is strange but 
 Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up 
 I'd like to see 
 Her take flight into the stars 
 Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars 
 Instead of letting fly free they keep 'em in jars 
 I put my hand to the glass so hard 
 It might break the prison bars 
 It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive 
 She's naturally attractive 
 Speaks with ad-libs, she's uncommonly talented 
 Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice 
 Kids are wishing' for just a kiss and it's a mission to touch her lipstick 
 Can't trust her with 
 Freedom of movement that's a chance to lose her quick 
 If she ups and splits 
 We might as well call that discussion quits 
 We have ways to keep her down the government's underlings 
 Enslave people in this town especially if there cultures rich 
 Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks 
 With the rest of the wingless imports 
 Repeatedly told you ain't a fairy, just a bitch 
 Just a bitch, with a butt that's thick 
 So rub your tits, and thrust your hips 
 And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit 
 She's a fairy with broken wings 
 I used to go watch her perform 
 And if she hears me I hope she sings songs 
 That had me going right back 
 Couldn't find anyone in town to talk 
 Bout how no one like that 
 Should be confined to the ground 
 When I was down in New York she'd send me letters 
 And I read her passages about how I left it to the savages 
 No matter how sad it is I didn't cry 
 'Cause it was only a matter of time 
 Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride 
 I knew the scoop 
 Wish you could have seen the blueprints in my eye 
 When I flew the coop 
 Utilizing overground railroads in the sky 
 It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine 
 Me and you are different girl 
 We don't even need wings to fly 
 We don't need wings to fly 
 Me and you, we don't need wings to fly 
 Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
 Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
