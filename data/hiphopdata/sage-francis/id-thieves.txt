While taking deep, slow breaths I try to grow wings 
 Decided to stay low, the halo was a smoke ring 
 Fell around my neck, I started choking 
 My soul got stuck looking for openings 
 I thought those were supposed to sing like cage birds 
 If you're a free broken spirit let the pearly gates burn, baby, burn 
 The muted trumpets in my chest take turns 
 When I release to spit valves gag on Gabe's germs 
 Some of this is fiction written all across it 
 But this bathroom lid and I'm too busy spitting in a faucet 
 Shitting blood thinking of the quickest drug to heal me 
 But I'm not lovesick, you sick, I dare love to kill me 
 Time to pry open the truth 
 Apply pliers to my own broken tooth 
 DIY or die, no health care benefits 
 You could spare me the 
 I know, I've been there 
 sentiments 
 I sense a sentimental song coming along, run along 
 Before I ask you to dance and all you get is trampled on upon faces 
 Mainly my own though, I've lost patience 
 I'm painting over old photos, I'm new now 
 Fresh out the box all bloody 
 Somebody cut me loose, slap me, call me ugly 
 Say it how you see it, buddy, I'm a hurting hot mess 
 A constantly inconsistent work in progress 
 Fat girl in a prom dress, do more, talk less 
 They wanna assassinate your character content 
 When pressed like ab-workouts, super thin 
 The whitest looking Jew screaming 
 Jerusalem 
 (Got my ID ready) 
 Who are they? 
 They are the identity thieves 
 (Got my ID ready) 
 Who are they? 
 They speak war and pretend that it's peace 
 (Got my ID ready) 
 Who are they? 
 They are killers by association 
 (Got my ID ready) 
 Who are they? 
 They'll hurt your credits if misappropriation 
 You can't just get comfy and stand in one spot 
 Like a king of the mountain you've been planted on top 
 Surveying the land of your family plot 
 Till it's all been abandoned, you're the man till you're not 
 It happens like that when you rest on your laurels 
 Like a shot to your back, it'll mess with your morals 
 It's a matter of fact I've consulted with oracles 
 Precaution of a shaman who was dressed so informal 
 I'm a poor man with cash making points with no fingers 
 Bringing popular back till the smell of sex lingers 
 Hard bodies will stack more neatly and tidy 
 But I swallowed her visions, now she sees inside me 
 She-devil so chiesty, deceptive and sexy 
 Walk with me, I'll give your legs epilepsy 
 My game is so shaky, if you love pain but hate me 
 That's a paradox I'm unable to explain 
 Conspiracy exposed, it's the way in which we fold the bill 
 Trying to overdose, instead you just choke on your pills 
 It's overkill if you're just going for thrills 
 Seek a mountain you can punch good, expose into molehills 
 I've done this yoddle ever since I was a child 
 I've got this other yoddle I ain't done in a while 
 It goes pure Himalayan intelligence 
 Braving the elements from a man cave and haven't shaved ever since 
 Never forget, you were the sperm that made it 
 Plus the unexpected pregnancy could have been terminated 
 So thanks to chance, and romance, and dancing 
 We're headed to our own damn thing, prepare kid 
 Why you think I let you get away with doing radio-friendly versions of what I do? 
 I wouldn't chide you, out perform, out write, and out rhyme you 
 Outsmart, out heart, and out grind you 
 Out shine you with the torch that was given to me 
 Torches and I'll pass it to bastards of the little league 
 If rap was a game you'd be M.V.P 
 Most Valued Puppet of this industry 
 Get your I.D, Independent? Fuck you!
