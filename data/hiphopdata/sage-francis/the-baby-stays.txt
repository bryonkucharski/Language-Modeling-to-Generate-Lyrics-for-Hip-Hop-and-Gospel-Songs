I got nothing to teach the learnin' curve of your body 
 I got teeth that could hurt you prolly 
 With one bite 
 A tongue with spikes, a rusty knife 
 I wish you'd take it from me 
 An gut me like a fish. up tight and selfish 
 Got a lust for life and a death wish 
 They're husband and wife and they 
 Fuck like they're helpless 
 Am I a product of uninteresting sex 
 If I'm bored by your pillow-talk and Newport cigarettes? 
 She chews on fiberglass like a teething infant 
 He breathes in her stink and seems indifferent 
 She dreams of children 
 He hears the pitter-patter of little fetuses 
 He's like "stand by me, 
 There's a leech in my briefs and it's bleeding like a stuck pig 
 Come quick!" 
 Think of a baby's name, she wanted to call it Quits 
 I'mma name him Raymond and raise him 
 Like I don't know my own strength 
 And bench-press the baby naked 
 Hold it to the sky, like "look what I did! 
 It's mine, and you can't have it." 
 Until it rains, and when it rains 
 He sticks out his tongue to catch it 
 The baby stays 
 He just stares into the abyss till the abyss blinks 
 Instincts pop up to the surface like pinpricks 
 Still flinch 
 Manhandle the killswitch 
 Peg meet square, get dismantled by drill-bits 
 The deconstruction of a functional addict 
 Leaving assumptions to a bunch of fanatics 
 It's just standard procedure 
 With a automatic pilot light 
 Hide behind a white lab rain coat 'cause the water broke 
 Press eject 
 First comes the head, then the neck 
 Then the body avalanches out the tape deck 
 Flappin' on the ground like a fish out of its element 
 No one wants to acknowledge the carnage, the mess or elephant 
 That's in the room 
 Connected to the womb with a lifeline 
 Labored all day through the morning noon and nighttime 
 Then we cut the cord, fully aware 
 What we keep on the inside's too personal to share 
 Now we hold it in the air, like "look what happened!" 
 If we throw it out with the bath water 
 Will you catch it? 
 Or let it go down the drain 
 If it goes down the drain I'mma snatch it 
 The baby stays 
 The baby stays 
 And I'mma hold it to the sky, like "look what I did! 
 It's mine, and you can't have it." 
 Until it rains, and when it rains 
 He sticks out his tongue to catch it 
 The baby stays 
 The baby stays 
 The baby stays
