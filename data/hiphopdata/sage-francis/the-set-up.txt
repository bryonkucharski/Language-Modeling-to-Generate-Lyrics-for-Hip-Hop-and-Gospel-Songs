I set it up, you knocked it down, lay the foundation, I built this house 
 I feel cracks underneath my feet, I feel cracks underneath my feet 
 The walls are breathing heavy, sucking up the oxygen with no plans of leaving any 
 For as long as I've been hoarded, it's taking me forever to gather up all my belongings 
 I get attached, near attached to people who I've loved and lost 
 Even though I gotta admit, there are few who've run me off 
 But I'm under no illusion how relationships get ruined 
 How I'm ancient to this movement when I'm just stuck to a cross 
 Tossed into the underworld and give in specific info 
 Forced to find another girl, sick of living in limbo 
 But I have my songs to play so I got lost along the way 
 And now I'll never see the light of day thanks to the tinted Limo 
 I was hopelessly romantic, emphasis on antic 
 Now run hopeless along the open coast of the Atlantic 
 Bought an overcoat that says "Francis, Showboat captain" 
 Did my best to scrub it off 'cause it's utterly embarrassing 
 Every night I'd re-write my will on a sandbar napkin 
 I'd crash after sticking it to the window of my cabin 
 Once I awoke I'd notice it, read it then remove it 
 Just stunned I left nothing to my loved ones but music 
 Muses abandon me while choosing family over continued support 
 For my intuitive thought, who would've thought? 
 Worst thing I ever did to another person in this world is nothing 
 Only a few can claim that's what I did when I could have done otherwise 
 Every single last one of them sang for nothing-types 
 Made me pay the price at any cost, I've got buyer's remorse 
 How many toxins will the doctors find inside this corpse? 
 Suicidal watch it's diamond studded 
 Tells me when my time's up, trying to keep my eyes from it 
 It's so swag, I flash it at the fashion shows 
 Walks with a limp, it's so pimp, and it smacks the hoes 
 Rappers used to brag about intelligence, made me want to be smarter 
 Then I harbor no regrets, whether it sells or not is irrelevant 
 I would have sold coke if making dough was the sole motive 
 It wasn't but fuck being a broke poet 
 Without paying debts, begging friends for loose ends 
 If your so-called talent only results in loan extensions 
 There's no defenses, or buyouts, you don't get a per diem for good intentions 
 Do you want to sign now? 
 Promise that a job doesn't define you as a person 
 If your words don't carry weight, it's not the worlds burden 
 And in no certain terms am I suggesting that you shouldn't set fire to the stage and let the curtains burn 
 Just be aware of the exits 
 Keep in mind that the closest one might be behind you, the entrance 
 [?] In the event that I can't live better as an honest rapper 
 Without my past self being my benefactor 
 I set it up, you knocked it down 
 I set it up, you knocked it down 
 I set it up, you knocked it down 
 I set it up, you knocked it down 
 You laid the foundation, I built this house 
 Gamble away my better half in hopes of doubling up 
 [?] Is a double or nothing, I laughed, I was shit out of luck 
 But what have I got to lose? At least I'm whole now 
 Half man, half clone, the bad composite sketch of a one-hundred percent asshole 
 But it wasn't without help, many people did their part 
 To make me take the time to Frankenstein was ripped apart 
 And put it together again, all the king's horses and all the king's men 
 Couldn't admit that this was a predicament they put me in 
 You want a piece of this? Welcome to the eggshells 
 I'm barefoot and pregnant to my kitchen, y'll can help yourselves 
 To the feast but tippy-toe away if you can't take the heat, or over-used clichés 
 Back in the days I'd leave you heartbroken 
 These days I simply reach into your chest and tear those scars open 
 Evaluate appreciation, write you off for tax purposes 
 I'd rather be homeless than settle in that worthless nest 
 I set it up, you knocked it down, lay the foundation, I built this house 
 I feel cracks underneath my feet, I feel cracks underneath my feet 
 The walls are breathing heavy, sucking up the oxygen with no plans of leaving any 
 For as long as I've been hoarded, it's taking me forever to gather up all my belongings
