Surprising the world, with diamonds and pearls 
 But a song about a girl, ain't really about a girl 
 Got a two-way vanity mirror, I'm an amity villain 
 With a peeping tom complex 
 You're just a soul collector 
 You keep putting 'em in a trash bag 
 Push 'em in a shopping cart... 
 Go and act sad 
 When there's none left to collect 
 So you go on and make more 
 But wait, what you lose them to the state for? 
 The next time you see me 
 It'll be through plexiglass 
 There ain't no bail outs in this jail house 
 Ain't no more petty cash 
 Easy come, easy go 
 A penny saved, a penny earned 
 And I've learned life is cliché 
 One of these days you get what you deserve 
 Surprising the world, with diamonds and pearls 
 But the song about a girl, ain't really about a girl 
 Got a 2-way vanity mirror 
 Firing a blind eye I turn from an 800-pound gorilla 
 In the midst of misdirected anger 
 False blood can run thinner than icy water 
 Watch the fang-banger 
 Flirt with the Death-star 
 I cried by your bedside 
 Decided right then and there to pretend you were alive 
 Maybe, baby lie to me, invade my privacy 
 Have the decency to say bye, after taking the pride 
 Domestic piracy 
 You ran out of family plunder 
 And launch pads to crash, 
 So when you're done playing dumb, empty the trash 
 We're looking for our lives back, we wish we could have saved yours 
 There's nothing we can buy back, cause everything was paid off 
 I found you in a pawn shop, you were stuck behind a glass case 
 I watched as the cost dropped, puppy dog sad face 
 Put a down payment on my meal plan, just to see your shit eating grin 
 Save the frown for when you need to shed your skin, 
 Selling bullshit shells to yourself, the layers coming off 
 Economic failed, professional victim of sale cutting costs 
 Charity case, don't ask me to donate 
 You axe murdered your soul mate 
 My backs hurting from an tax burden 
 Pull your own weight 
 A punching bag for hire, every minute there's a sucker bet, 
 So what's the over and under you'll rise up from the debt. 
 With the complexion of a ghost 
 The resurrection was a hoax, but 2000 years later it's like nobody knows... 
 If you think you're slick enough to turn a trick and spin the story just cause Jesus is your fair-weather pimp 
 And you caught me praying with my fingers crossed 
 So I shuffled up the deck, is this the card that you picked? 
 Well if not, how about this? 
 Missionary ain't a job, it's a position, so assume it 
 A victimless crime watch dog has an owner that's abusive 
 Now isn't that ironic? With one hand in my pocket 
 And the other choking out the street corner prophet 
 Uncrossed my fingers and said look at me when I'm talking dear 
 I ain't mad at you, and that's the only miracle here 
 I ain't mad at you... 
 I'm surprising the world, with diamonds and pearls 
 But a song about a girl, ain't really about a girl
