No tricks 
 No tricks 
 It's just a flashback- 
 Now I can't even think back 
 When I reminisce on my own past I cringe 
 It gets under my skin like a syringe. 
 I binge on food for thought. 
 Avoiding memory lane on my way home 
 Get lost and have to look for a pay phone 
 It's so strange 
 I've got no change 
 I could have sworn I did when I left 
 My breath gets heavy with every theft 
 ??Y'all didn't round my childhood?? 
 If I could have smiled I would 
 Try to keep them to a minimum 
 But one got cracked while I was killing 'em 
 Back to the present here and now in modern times 
 When Satan's got me signing dotted lines 
 I pick up the phone and call 
 People in my own hometown collect 
 And tell them things change, but they just won't accept 
 That's no surprise; it's so ironic me having to ask them for directions 
 But I just got dead air, cut lines and bad connections 
 People who would help 
 Change their number to unlisted 
 411 info left me unassisted 
 Wickedly twisted happenings 
 Is it coincidence? 
 I choose to think so. 
 Deep in thought my eyes blink slow 
 Pictures appear like slideshows 
 Cause my mind knows 
 Each and every minute detail 
 Total recall is leaving me pale 
 Sick to my stomach 
 Nauseous 
 Forces of nature bring my homing instinct 
 It stinks 
 It's so distinct. 
 Now let me think a minute. 
 Huh, this is the much traveled trail from my past 
 No one unbeaten path 
 And funny memories are now making me laugh 
 Just a flash back kid, it's just a flashback 
 I'm getting laughed at mental attack, mental attack 
 I should design forts 
 To pro-tect my mind 
 From these time warps 
 'Cause I'm off course 
 Begin to rethink my final thoughts 
 Philosophies 
 My personal creations face conflict 
 You're slipping 
 By following my footsteps 
 'Cause I'm slick 
 Now I stand alone in this ghost town 
 My clothes make the most sound 
 Upside down smiles 
 Grin while folks frown 
 I feel my Sacred 
 Heart get filled with hatred 
 Ancient rituals of a teary eyed child 
 With nothing fake kid 
 The flash backs of my past acts 
 Are numerous 
 Inside the uterus 
 Other kinds haven't been so humorous 
 My laugh lines are faked for the last time 
 I'm past my prime 
 Climaxing again is a task of mine 
 I'm homeward bound; break out the map and atlas 
 I ask gas station attendants kid and they act pissed 
 I'm black listed 
 For not staying true to white lies 
 I fight guys in darkness 
 Heartless until the night dies. 
 And Then I shed some light on what's the matter 
 Reflections in the looking glass self scatter 
 When the hard stairs made it shatter 
 7 years back luck? 
 That ain't nothing new! 
 I'm searching for something true 
 But most my friends are fronting too. 
 What's up with you? 
 Only once you catch amnesia 
 Same old procedure 
 Valuable times lost at leisure 
 Plus I broke my compass 
 The needle always points backwards 
 There's no communications 
 Whack herbs 
 That cost me black words 
 Impossible 
 Facial expressions in sign language 
 Cause your mind your mind anguish 
 Misinterpretations are dangerous 
 No one knows who the stranger is 
 But still yet know my face is vaguely familiar, 
 Thinking back wouldn't kill you would it? 
 Or would it? 
 I can't catch no one's attention 
 Even Ignored by the lord 
 My mind sided dimensions 
 It's just a flashback kid, it's just a flashback 
 I'm getting laughed at mental attack; mental attack...
