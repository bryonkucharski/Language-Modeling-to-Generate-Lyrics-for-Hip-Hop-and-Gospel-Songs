This shirt is old and faded 
 All the color's washed away 
 I've had it now for more damn years 
 Than I can count anyway 
 I wear it beneath my jacket 
 With the collar turned up high 
 So old I should replace it 
 But I'm not about to try 
 This shirt's got silver buttons 
 And a place upon the sleeve 
 Where I used to set my heart up 
 Right there anyone could see 
 This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance 
 Where the boys ignored the girls 
 And we all pretended to like the band 
 This shirt was a pillow for my head 
 On a train through Italy 
 This shirt was a blanket beneath the love 
 We made in Argeles 
 This shirt was lost for three whole days 
 In a town near Buffalo 
 Till I found the locker key 
 In a downtown Trailways bus depot 
 This shirt was the one I lent you 
 And when you gave it back 
 There was a rip inside the sleeve 
 Where you rolled your cigarettes 
 It was the place I put my heart 
 Now look at where you put a tear 
 I forgave your thoughtlessness 
 But not the boy who put it there 
 This shirt was the place your cat 
 Decided to give birth to five 
 And we stayed up all night watching 
 And we wept when the last one died 
 This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton 
 Shining like the memories 
 Inside those silver buttons 
 This shirt is a grand old relic 
 With a grand old history 
 I wear it now for Sunday chores 
 Cleaning house and raking leaves 
 I wear it beneath my jacket 
 With the collar turned up high 
 So old I should replace it 
 But I'm not about to try
