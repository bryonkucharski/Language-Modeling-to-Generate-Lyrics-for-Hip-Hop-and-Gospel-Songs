Yeah, Yeah 
 New Smitty! 
 Let me know 
 If I push this maybach baby 
 Do you wanna go? 
 And (Big D we done did it again) 
 If so (we done did it again) 
 Should I roll this thing out 
 Or let it go 
 Tell me 
 To all my ladies and gents 
 In the club spending money for rent 
 Holla at me 'cause we at it again 
 Making a killing 
 Better tell 'em who you with 
 Money over bitches stick to the script 
 Drinks that we sip 
 So they feed us more litres of cris 
 Out the bottle swallow never sip 
 And this is good as it gets 
 We on some down south playa shit 
 It's a trip 
 And Imma get fresh for all my women 
 AF1's with the strap white linen 
 (?) In the back with my dollar stacked up to the ceiling 
 You will see when they show me on "How I'm Living" 
 And Imma take this time to point out 
 All my mami's and Gucci and the money 
 And we can chill on some cool shit (yeah) 
 More money than we know what to do with (for real) 
 Tell me 
 If you feeling it right 
 If you still play (put your hands way up in the sky) 
 With someone like me (let 'em know you's a playa tonight) 
 Tell Me 
 If you feeling it right 
 If you still play (all my ladies put 'em up in the sky) 
 (Let 'em know what's the deal) 
 This is for the playa in you 
 (True playa for real) 
 Who you kissin'? Who you wanna be huggin? 
 Made something from nothing 
 Out this life of crime 
 Money is time 
 So I spend mine hustlin rhymes 
 With another foot stuck in the grind 
 Now lemme ask you this 
 Have you ever been on private jets 
 With a private chef 
 First class eatin lobster tails 
 All types of exotic fish 
 Straight shit 
 (Don't know you're name) 
 But excuse me miss 
 Lemme offer you some wine 
 Pass strike the 9 (just take this) 
 Light a cigar 
 Fill my cup with the best liquor 
 Real life is what we are 
 I ain't ashamed of this 
 It's all fame 
 The money just came with this 
 True game I spit to the lamest chick 
 See my clique so big... 
 Tell me 
 If you feeling it right 
 If you still play (put your hands way up in the sky) 
 With someone like me (let 'em know you's a playa tonight) 
 Tell Me 
 If you feeling it right 
 If you still play (all my ladies put 'em up in the sky) 
 (Let 'em know what's the deal) 
 This is for the playa in you 
 (True playa for real) 
 Come with me 
 To the afterparty
