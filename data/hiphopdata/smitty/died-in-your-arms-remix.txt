Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must have been something you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight, Oh 
 New money 
 White forces 
 New money 
 White porches 
 Blue money 
 I like bosses 
 White frames 
 His name is Scott Storches 
 Cold bottles 
 Hit the forgery 
 Top models and they're gorgeous 
 And look here's a pen call me around 10 
 Ask him I'm the man girlfriend 
 She's hot, and I got her 
 New drops dun done her 
 Don't stop, more dollars 
 Twenty on the watch 
 Who you know do it hotter 
 I talk it, I live it, I do it the best 
 She on the right and you on the left 
 Now move it ya body, now you out of breath 
 Keep doing what you doing to death. 
 Two step like: 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must have been something you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight, Oh (X2) 
 I was on krys 
 She was on e 
 I was on her, she was on me 
 In the club drunk seeing off key like (oh) 
 Didn't it feel good to see niggas up on it 
 Got two coops new 
 Didn't flaunt it 
 Old work new stashes 
 Old work in the plastic 
 Money first 
 That's classic 
 Ain't a thing at the whip game master 
 She stops I spot her 
 Louis top, boots prada 
 I get it I got it I had it before 
 Eh making this money is all that I know 
 And moving ya body get back on the floor 
 Keep doing what you doing some more 
 Lets go like: 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must have been something you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight, Oh (X2) 
 The way you walk the way you move 
 The way you talk the way you move 
 On my grind I can't lose 
 'Cause I am so cool 
 The way you look, the way you stand 
 The way you say what you said 
 I can't help it, it's the way I am 
 'Cause I am so cool 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must have been something you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight, Oh (X2)
