 The B to the L, the A to the Z to the E 
 Early twenties, girls by the twenties 
 Rims buy 'em twenty, never gin slide me Henny 
 Blunts roll in twenties, got my stunts holdin' semis 
 Blaze in the Bentley; be like Jay, "Come and Get Me" 
 Straight from Q-U-E percisely 40P 
 (Rah Digga) 
 Yo you that brother that I always see on MTV 
 I ain't cop your album got it off the MP3 
 But it's hot though take it from another emcee 
 That's what I'm tryna be 
 (Casey Lee) 
 Shorty it's the M-O-N-E-Y 
 My wrists will leave your eyes B-L-I-N-D 
 My passion for poetry and parting from poverty 
 Leaves me in position to mould my own like pottery 
 (Rah Digga (Joy Bryant)) 
 Heh, ain't really sweatin' you brother, we tryna parlay see 
 (I heard A&R was short for armed robbery) 
 I heard selling records is like hitting the lottery 
 (Casey Lee) 
 All you need is talent shorty, Blaze got plenty 
 Shorty holla, come on 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 (Casey Lee) + (Joy Bryant) 
 If you start from my toes to my dome like Gators 
 Iceburg, Gucci, my head cap is Raiders 
 CD so hot you gotta play hot potato 
 And Primo won't even take me out with the fader 
 Cause my voice is laid with paper, my crib, Jamaica 
 You know the action, get planes built to go there 
 (What about your Grammy?) 
 Got it chillin' at my mother's crib 
 Right next to the Golden Globe 
 For actin' like I give a fuck 
 (Rah Digga) 
 What you talkin' 'bout? Diamond life, you livin' it 
 Benji's, Bentley's, your cash flow is infinite 
 (Casey Lee) 
 But you know there's more to life than videos 
 They're different 
 Cali is where it's at 
 And that's a wrap, my lip I'm zippin' it 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E 
 The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E
