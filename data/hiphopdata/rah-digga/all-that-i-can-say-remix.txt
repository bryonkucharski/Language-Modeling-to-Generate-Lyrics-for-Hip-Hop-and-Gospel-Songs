(Mary) 
 Ooh, ooh 
 (Rah Digga) 
 Uh, uh, uh The Rah D-I-G 
 Here to rap on behalf 
 All the females headed down the wrong path 
 Things gonna change when we hit the set 
 Put an end to the pain and the disrespect 
 My Flipmode brother gonna switch his pitch 
 Like we ain't supposed to know when he talking to a chick 
 Too fly for that to even make that an issue 
 Take little chicken head baby moms with you 
 (Mary) 
 Loving you is what I thought 
 In my mind was a miracle 
 But times have changed and you have changed with them too 
 How foolish of me 
 To think that you would be 
 Someone that I can hold on to 
 Something in my mind 
 Was warning me all the time 
 That you were no angel and neither was I 
 I tried and tried and tried 
 To bring peace into our lives 
 But you continued to flip and try to take control of my life and I 
 1 - (Mary) (Rah Digga) 
 I don't know 
 Where we went wrong 
 All that I can say 
 He never loved me anyway 
 (He didn't love you, he didn't love you, come on) 
 (Mary) 
 I have been with you 
 Through everything that you've gone through 
 But it hurts me to my heart that you don't realize 
 That I've only stayed around, not to cry tears of a clown 
 But to someday end up being your wife but you lie 
 Liar, cheater, deceiver and a woman beater 
 About to give up 
 Because you want me to sell it short 
 Boyfriend, little boy 
 I've been played like a toy 
 Wondering in your heart 
 To give someone else a brand new start 
 (Rah Digga) 
 How ill is this? 
 Playing games with my mental 
 All them other heartbreaker dealers I've done went through I'm just too fly for that 
 Now all the ladies say, I'm just too fly for that 
 And now don't be surprised 
 Catching you in all kinds of lies 
 If a honey come flip, start chasing you with knives 
 You gonna feel the wrath that's word is bond 
 Cause ain't nothing worse than a ghetto chick scorned 
 Repeat Chorus till end
