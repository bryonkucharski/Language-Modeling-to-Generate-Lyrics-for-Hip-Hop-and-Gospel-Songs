(Beyonce) 
 The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh 
 And now I think about if it's my time to die 
 I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill 
 And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven 
 I can't understand how my life changed around 
 Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground? 
 Blue skies are turning grayer it's the point of indecision 
 Believing in the cards you must respect it's every vision 
 (Wyclef) 
 Oh Girlfriend, get your mind on right 
 Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time 
 Everyday like it's your last, but you must fear divine 
 Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind 
 Love! 
 You feel it and you got to let them know it 
 Love! 
 Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with 
 If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it 
 Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over 
 (Beyonce) 
 No, No, No, No 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
 I don't wanna go 
 Just, Just, Just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn 
 No, No, No, No 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
 I don't wanna go 
 Just, Just, Just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn 
 (Rah Digga) 
 Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit 
 Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt 
 Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder 
 Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling 
 He probably should be older 
 (Wyclef) 
 But the cards never lie, I thought I told you 
 Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky 
 (Beyonce) 
 This is love 
 It's like I'm trying to throw my life away 
 Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay 
 (Wyclef) 
 Well when you finally rise 
 Then you'll realize 
 (Beyonce) 
 The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes 
 (Wyclef) 
 Oh You could wish on the stars but they dead, just the light 
 (Beyonce) 
 But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life 
 No, No, No, No 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
 I don't wanna go 
 Just, Just, Just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn 
 No, No, No, No 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
 I don't wanna go 
 Just, Just, Just let me stay home 
 Just let me live my dreams, let me see another day
