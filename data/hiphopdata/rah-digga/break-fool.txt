Yeah 
 Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha 
 Rah Digga, Dirty Harriet, Y'all 
 Ah Shit 
 Bricks 
 See me on the block with tha chromed out drop 
 Lambskin head to toe bustin' out my halter top 
 'Tight' rippin through tha hood 
 Blow up the whole spot 
 With tha system 
 TV 
 ?Foremon? 
 EASY! 
 Working the scene on the quest for lime green 
 Steady puffin on brown just for the time being 
 Battle raps on cock I get all up in your ear 
 Trying to get a record deal, battling somebody famous 
 Pounds to my girls as we slide up in the dance bar 
 Niggas in my grill like they really got a chance 
 Chicken heads trying to front like they not Digga fans 
 Say fuck y'all! 
 Groupies 
 Do Me 
 Truly 
 Shittin on MC's, what I do for a living 
 Tight takin' over spots like my name was Robin Givins 
 Anybody got a beat, then they better keep it hittin 
 Retailers put your fit in for the hottest chick spittin' 
 This for my niggas and bitches makin' moves 
 By day you play it cool, by night you break fool 
 Say flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it 
 Flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it 
 This for my niggas and bitches makin' moves 
 By day you play it cool, by night you break fool 
 Say flood it up 
 Flood it up 
 Whip it up 
 Whip it up 
 Smoke it up 
 Smoke it up 
 Trick it up 
 Trick it up 
 VIP area 
 Certain heads get in 
 Cats without wristbands steady trying to slip in 
 Weed on delivery, everybody chip in 
 Dump it, roll it, spark it, smoke it 
 Ladies where you at say 'Do you queen?' 
 Gotta krib, gotta whip, high heels, and tight jeans 
 My straight thug bitches rock Tims and tattoos 
 After one or two drinks he ready to ACT FOOL! 
 Now, this for my real live underground cats 
 Who be checkin' for the rhymes 
 Not checkin' for the track 
 Take away all the hype and a nigga straight wack 
 Say fuck dat! 
 Fuck dat! 
 Fuck Dat! 
 Fuck dat! 
 My squad hold it down passin bars, passin mics 
 Make emcees stay at home with water and flashlights 
 Ya motherfuckas crazy telling 'Git Da Git' 
 Trying to see my clique, ain't even getting past the chick 
 For those who want to whip it 
 For those who want to flood it 
 For those who want to buy it 
 For those who want to dub it 
 For those who want the sexy 
 For those who want the rugged 
 Say Digga 
 Digga 
 Hardcore 
 Sluggers 
 Comin' up fast while you're fallin' even faster 
 A blitz on a Jack handling my money matters 
 For those who want to smoke it 
 For those who want to trick it 
 For those who want to hate me 
 Niggas know where they can stick it
