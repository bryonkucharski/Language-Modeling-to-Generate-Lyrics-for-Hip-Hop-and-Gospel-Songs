I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs. 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs. 
 I close my eyes, I can't sleep, I visualize death 
 I seen my little homie get smoked like a cigarette 
 And these G's on the streets, enemies, 
 They'll take your life for a hundred see's 
 I mean a hundred dollars or less 
 The game gets so wicked that I wear a bulletproof vest 
 And now I'm grown, and they wonder why I'm crazy 
 Imagine feedin' tablets and beer to a baby 
 Never had a chance when I was 5 
 Nigga took me in the car, took me on the ghetto ride 
 Cruisin' through streets that I've never seen 
 Pull the clip off a 30 round magazine 
 Taught me how to deal with a triple beam 
 And ever since then I've been servin' dope fiends 
 I got the game in the bag that's so big 
 Nigga see my nuts it's like two figs 
 Swoll to the fullest, 
 In my heart to my vein, pump nickel plated bullets 
 And this ghetto got me stressed (stressed), 
 'Cause niggas that you know (bitches) will rob you blind and leave you to rest. 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 I hit that nigga with a are-15, do it clean 
 Back up in the lex, bumpin' Mia, with my mug mean 
 Bulletproof vest, Smith and Wess 
 For enemies fuckin' steppin' in my direction 
 I'm gonna teach these niggas a lesson. 
 Flexin' like an Anaconda, I'm stuffed like bombers 
 Hit ya step and get wet, then duck my doorway teck. 
 I holds my own like I'm pissin' 
 Beef with us is death wishing, I put to work because they didn't listen 
 They tryed to set me up, why did they push me? 
 Hook me up in the town with the killer pussy 
 Rap me up between the sheets 
 Nigga bust out the closet, but my 9 made 'em dead meat. 
 I shot the hoe who set me up 
 I'm drivin' off mad because the niggas threw off my nut 
 I'm going through a thang, ain't no thang though 
 Cause before I left, I hit the set and took all the dope 
 I'm going thorugh some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 So if it seem, point the beam 
 Since a youngster, these niggas pushed my cemetery dream 
 Lean my body if they could, 
 And wished ya die, I wished ya coward motherfuckers would 
 Everyday, I thank god for my baby, she fall asleep on my chest 
 But if her momma catch her callin' me daddy, she whoop that ass 
 I'm not scared to blast, why my momma wish she never had me? 
 She know these streets got me crazy 
 I'm hittin' my momma for some pocket change, 
 To stay one step ahead all these niggas in the game 
 My daddy, gangsterism pumpin' d up in my vein. 
 Should I kill a nigga for respect, or should I let him go? 
 And if I do, someone please close my eyes 
 When I'm layin' bleedin' on the floor 
 That's why I never trust a bitch 
 Cause now a days these bitches carry an extra clip 
 Ready to knock ya head off for that paper 
 Always down for a caper, 
 Mr. S-E-R-V 
 I'm going through some thangs, lord help me 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 I'm going through some thangs 
 These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs 
 Going through somethings, ya heard me? 
 I done made it out the ghetto 
 And every nigga that I know, that still there 
 Think I owe them something 
 And every motherfuckin' nigga that was down with me 
 Or wanted to be, wanna be just like me 
 They think I owe them something 
 Every bitch I stopped fucking with, 
 Thank I owe them something 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 Nigga can't even ride in his motherfuckin' car 
 Nigga can't even walk though the streets 
 Without a motherfucker thinkin' a nigga who think he owe him some 
 I got mine, and you can get yours 
 Motherfuckers in my family, 
 They think a nigga just got boo-coo money, 
 Just a blown on them, just to give to a motherfucker 
 That don't wanna do nothing for theyselves motherfucker 
 Be a real motherfucker, be a true nigga, get ya own 
 Damn, can't even mourn the dead anymore 
 Without motherfuckers thinking if you a big nigga in the hood 
 You must be stickin' prices on other niggas heads 
 But I'm bigger than that nigga 
 I got family in the Caliope, the Magnolia, and the Saint Bernard nigga
