Mia x hook: 
 We can tear this bitch up, how you won't do it 
 How you won't bring it, nigga step to me 
 We can tear this bitch up, how you won't do it, 
 How you won't bring, nigga step to me, 
 We can tear this bitch up, how you won't do it, 
 How you won't bring it, nigga step to me now, what 
 How you won't do it 
 Verse 1: big ed 
 I'm from a little city called wes town 
 Roll quick to blast and known to buck 'em down 
 You get killed if ya' from outta town 
 Where after dark it ain't safe to hang around 
 I hang with nothing but no limit soldiers 
 We pull our straps and knock ya' head off ya' shoulders 
 Never ever gave a fuck about the rollers 
 Cause all my niggas getting high smoking doulja 
 You can find us in the club getting rowdy 
 Move ya' ass if ya ain't 'bout it 'bout it 
 You can come and run up if ya doubt it 
 But if ya real let me hear my niggas shout it 
 Chorus: repeat 4x 
 If ya want me, nigga come and get me (come and get me) 
 'Cause I gotta gang of guns and my niggas with me 
 (And my niggas with me) 
 I went I'll put 'em in my car 
 Hold spot like I'm a superstar 
 The tank list you know who we are 
 Met a group of ho's sitting at the bar 
 Boy want 'cha know she come home with me 
 I see her man and he's looking angry 
 I know ya nigga, yo ya girl choose me 
 Don't make the scene in here get ugly 
 But the nigga kept on talking so I stuck 'em 
 And yo we nine a went outside so you can buck 'em 
 And sho a nuff me and my niggas let 'em have it 
 And I still took his lady home and stabbed it 
 Chorus repeat 4x 
 If ya want me, nigga come and get me (come and get me) 
 'Cause I gotta gang of guns and my niggas with me 
 (And my niggas with me)
