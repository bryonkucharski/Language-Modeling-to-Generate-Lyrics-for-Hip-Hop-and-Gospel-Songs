(Fiend) 
 Whomp! whomp! 
 Direct to all surviours on the battlefield 
 Let's hustle up, get blunted up and test you, what the fuck? 
 Muscle up, it's very crazy, for all the killings 
 Humble up, they don't expect like raw dealings, come winter 
 Bundle up, me and my pistols stay cuddled up 
 Gone, nigga, jones nigga, sleepy eye from that zone nigga 
 Boy they bringing lots of guns, check my home and picture 
 Besides from every crick that's gone split ya 
 Memphis I'm hypotinzed with it, means some eyes with it 
 Voice so high with it, 2005 with it 
 So ride with it or be rolled the fuck over 
 Fiend's surviving the soldier, grenade thrower 
 Chorus [big ed] (fiend) 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 (Big ed) 
 Niggas about to get fucked up 
 I guess you niggas don't know that I can bucked up 
 I'm quick to pull the gats, let 'em go, bust bust bust 
 Stampede on your ass when your fucking with us 
 I gain the strength of ten men all angeled up 
 Pcp, scared one droppin' big tank trucks 
 I'm pumpin' iron at the wake, getting all swolled up 
 Rip off my shirt, at concerts, 'cause I'm tatted up 
 Never worrying about them bustas, my niggas gatted up 
 Don't step to us, my niggas quick to tear shit up 
 We lock in down in every town 'cause we got it solded up 
 In the hood it's all good, 'cause they rolling with us 
 Doing shows at clubs 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 You can find me in that bitch fucking booted up 
 Bust a nigga in his head if he tries to run up 
 4 is 1, 8 is 0, bitch I stay one up 
 Chorus [big ed] (fiend) 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck

 Come on and let the bigger nigga through 
 Don't look for just a teardrop, 'cause him a killer too 
 South gonna make a crew, 'cause you a bitch 
 I'm callin' your ass, wanna lose my (? ?) 
 No such thing as missing business 
 Your family have to cop a pay to visti 
 Let 'em both say I did it 
 And watch how quick they lie on stage, get it? 
 (Big ed) 
 I don't give a - 
 Get that motherfucker, (where he at?), right there 
 Nigga I'm bringing drama anytime anywhere 
 Niggas scrapling in the club, but I don't care 
 I keep my gat in the club, and bust like a flare 
 See I don't give a fuck (fuck), we don't give a fuck (fuck) 
 Bitch I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, about to get fucked up 
 Chorus [big ed] (fiend) 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck 
 I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (we can get it on) 
 We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
