(Featuring Master P, Mac And O'Dell) 
 Master P (O'Dell): 
 Ya know what (I miss you) 
 It's like, uh? How many times (I really miss my homies) 
 We must go through this how many records we gotta make like this 
 (I miss you) but ya know what? 
 It seem like uh? It's a never ending game 
 All right P (I miss you) to all the fallen soldiers out there 
 (I'm prayin' for you homies) 
 And Big Ed, people, Cory Green (I miss you) rest in peace 
 Big Ed: 
 I'm fightin tears back, the lord knows it hurts 
 All my family dressed in black, cause a love one rising to ??? 
 Reminising on good times, some bad times too 
 But I gotta keep on smiling 'cause he would want me to 
 But it's hard to accept this loss 
 It's drivin' me crazy, see my aunty suffer the death of her only male 
 Baby 
 (Be strong) 
 I'm at your funeral strapped, ready to kill 
 I look in the eyes of my new born and they told me to chill 
 I will always keep you with me 
 Cory can ya hear me 
 I feel cheated but to cope I keep, pourin out henney 
 Your youngest sister took it the hardest 
 Couldn't let go of your casket 
 Begging you to come back, times are gettin' so drastic 
 I spoke at your funeral and broke all to peaces 
 Tears overflow from friends, nephews and nieces 
 Your girlfriends is pregnant, so you left your mark 
 And to al our memories I'll keep them close at heart 
 O'Dell:(x2) 
 I miss you 
 I really miss my homies 
 I miss you 
 Mac: 
 I remember we used to sit in class 
 We was either yappin bout rappin' or lookin' at some ass 
 Talkin' bout one day we was going to make it in this rap game 
 Like normal teens we was young, black and broke 
 So all we had was dreams 
 You got a record deal and that's when everything changed 
 You started, hanging with the wrong niggas and thangs 
 I wasn't trippin' when you saw me, I still smoke and say woo 
 It's funny how you never really get a chance to say good bye 
 Cause you never know when they gone go 
 We was suppose to do ??? 
 But I remember your last night 
 Some nigga told me Mac your boy, daddy all gone and I said ya right 
 Next day it was official (official), give me some tissue 
 I'm a G, but still I miss you 
 May God be with you 
 O'Dell: 
 I know it's a dream but I wish you could come back to me, homey (my 
 Homey) 
 But your long gone away, so I'm missin' you 
 I miss you 
 I really miss my homies 
 I miss you 
 I miss you 
 I'm prayin' for you homey 
 I miss you 
 (I miss you) I miss you 
 (I miss you) I really miss my homies 
 (I miss you) I miss you 
 (I miss you) (oh oh) 
 I miss you (oh oh) 
 I'm prayin' for you homies (oh oh oh) 
 I miss you (oh oh) 
 (Oh oh oh)
