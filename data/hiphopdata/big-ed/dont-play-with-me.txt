(C-murder) 
 I mean mug fake niggas that be testin' my presence 
 So duck and run, young nigga, 187 ya fellows 
 Friend or foe, you'se hoe, so dry ya eyes I'm bustin' 
 I told these bitches I'm thuggin', them ghetto niggas they love me 
 C-p-3 to h-0-v I feel no pain for real 
 I got the status of a motherfucker hard to kill 
 I walk a block and watch them fools just step to the side 
 It's open wide in my city cause these niggas be shootin' 
 Like vietnam, them niggas get the one time 
 I put ya crack on a block, I ain't hard to find 
 A million dollars is my dream till I'm dead and gone 
 Watch me relive my life through my songs, ya feeling me? 
 Chorus [big ed]

 (Kane) 
 Get the fuck on the floor don't you move an inch 
 Bitch flinch, I'll be on that ass quicker than nick 
 I done spent to much time earning my respect 
 My rights and lefts leaving you missing teeth like them rednecks 
 (Abel) 
 Yeah you think it's funny while you crackin' jokes 
 I'll be crackin' necks, if properly prevoked 
 Get chocked, playin' around niggas I don't know 
 And why you talking stupid when we around some hoes? 
 Bitch stop playing I done told you before 
 I'ma wire ya jaw, and leave you suckas sippin' through a straw 
 Or I could run ya over with my 4 by 4 
 And back up, bitch don't act up no more

 Nigga you play to goddamn much 
 Nigga you'se gonna fuck around and get your ass touched 
 You lucky you'se my boy, my dogg at that 
 'Cause if you wasn't you would have been got the gat 
 Had a hoe call my house, when I got home 
 Why you cuss a nigga out?, words out 
 My gun out, I don't know what you talking about 
 Remember that gat that got your ass strecthed out? 
 Woke up on the floor a bloody dick was in your mouth 
 You flapped on the ground like I just caught a trout 
 Now you'se my childhood nigga, but I ain't in the mood today 
 Man grow the fuck up, cause all you do is play
