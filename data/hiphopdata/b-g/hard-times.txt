Who put this shit together 
 I done done it all from jackin' and slangin' nigga trust that 
 Stealin' cars snortin' dope gettin' bust at 
 Never goin' ta school all kinda bull-shit 
 They callin' my moma in I got her lookin' unfit 
 But look it ain't Cint fault I turned out this way 
 It's my fault she told me right from wrong everyday 
 When my daddy got killed I think that's when I went a stray 
 Mark Nell L.T. and me made niggas lay on they face 
 We was about that gunplay and on the grind 
 We was on a paper chase we wanted ta shine 
 Gotta get it how you live where the fuck I'm from 
 Gotta keep it on the real where the fuck I'm from 
 Growin' up in the streets best believe its dangerous 
 They lock us up but the jail ain't changin' us 
 You'll make it how I live if you don't mind dyin' 
 Growin' up in my shoes best believe was hard times nigga 
 Hard times got a nigga in all black 
 I'm goin' jack for that silver pack where it's at 
 Hard times got the B.G. drove nigga 
 Hard times got me duckin' them white folks nigga 
 It's a hard time comin' up where I'm from like a twister spinnin' 
 Don't get caught in it 
 Its drastic drama its everyday life whoa 
 Jackin' is a way of livin' 'if you ain't on the right road 
 I move fast my people say I need ta slow down 
 Close ya nose or ya gonna go down 
 I'm beefin' with different sets I'm duckin' them white folks 
 Playin' my hoes close 
 They tied up like a rope 
 I'm slangin' tryin' ta make a million and chill 
 Buy a ten story buildin' and a football field 
 Diamonds round my neck and wrist plenty golds in my grill 
 Niggas gone get holes in they head if they don't keep it real 
 My mama cryin' 'cause she think I'ma get my head bust 
 But I tell her growin' up with no daddy is rough 
 Welfare ain't enough 
 And I wanna shine 
 So I'm goin' get mine nigga and get out these hard times whoa 
 Me and my niggas buyin' cars don't give a fuck what its costin' 
 Neighborhood superstar Hot Boy$ bout flossin' 
 Crossin any of us get that put in a coffin 
 You don't hear we loss a shoot-out very often 
 We ballin' 
 Shot callin' 
 Walkin' to the top 
 And when we get there believe we closin' shop 
 I'm lettin' my law down makin' Gs nigga 
 I done been through them hard times I'm makin' chesse nigga 
 Me and Fresh can hook up and make a hit with ease nigga 
 Fade me the B.G. pretty please nigga 
 I'm a six figure 
 Money go-getter 
 Drivin' expedition 
 Bet a bitch quick and put another hoe in her position 
 Riches is what I'm chasin' everyday nigga 
 Killin' bustas bringin' that bitch in my way nigga 
 Tryin' ta shine Ca$h Money on the grind nigga 
 Stackin' gingles 'cause we done been through hard times nigga peep me 
 (Chorus) - repeat to end
