(Intro: B.G.) 
 Its bout dat time, believe it 
 Its bout dat time, believe it 
 Its bout dat time, believe it 
 Oh yeah, we bout to do it... its bout dat time 
 Its bout dat time, look I went back in V.L. 
 With my dawg Ziggly, you heard me? 
 And we ??? down like real niggas exposely down, check it 
 (Verse 1: B.G.) 
 In 93 I hit the scene first album True Story 
 I was psyched off ghetto boys no nuts no glory 
 Then I bounced back wit the classic Chopper City 
 Had every nigga in new orleans rolling with me 
 Then I shook back with that fuckin' Volume One 
 Real street niggas was respeccin how it come 
 Then I doubled back with that fuckin' Volume Two 
 You know the name of 'em it was All On U 
 A minute after that was Chopper City In The Ghetto 
 I could'a came harder I kept it a lil' mello 
 I went to jail came home dropped Checkmate 
 And made it official B.Gizzle ain't fake 
 Left Cash Money hit 'em upp wit Livin' Legend 
 Had to bust a move baby was doin' to much reppin 
 Now I'm back again ain't a damn thing funny 
 This album number eight Life After Cash Money 
 (Ziggler the Wiggler talking)
