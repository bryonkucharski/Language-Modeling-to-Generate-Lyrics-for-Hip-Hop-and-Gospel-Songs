 It's time I bounce back 
 Y'all ain't seen me in a while 
 Close your eyes 
 I got a ridiculous smile (bling!) 
 On the left wrist 
 Think it's 'bout fifty G's (damn!) 
 And on the right wrist 
 Think it's 'bout the same thing (fuck!) 
 Now 'round my neck 
 Aw, this shit's so blue 
 Got niggas tuckin' they chains in 
 When I come through 
 I got a tight crew 
 Roll with nothin' but soldiers 
 Oh, you can run up 
 Believe, you been got ran over 
 I'm in the black Rover (Rover) 
 Phantom 'bout the chauffeur (chauffeur) 
 The comeback kid back bitch, game over 
 You ain't wanna believe me 
 I tried to told ya 
 ??? Play wit' me 
 I knocked his head off his shoulders 
 I'm a choppa toilin' 
 Get it right and keep it right 
 I feel good 'cause my whole clique eatin' right 
 I got plays that's cool so get like a man 
 I told you haters that I was gon' have a lamb

 Katrina came through 
 Flooded a nigga out (out) 
 I'm runnin' through the tray 
 Like I'm still uptown (town) 
 I told ya once before 
 My ghetto bench was worldwide (wide) 
 Without that dolla' sign 
 Nigga just a steel shine (shine) 
 I go walk through Atlanta 
 You in his zone (in his zone) 
 All alone and walk out 
 With all my jewelry on (yup) 
 I'm real to the bone (bone) 
 Don't fuck wit' me I'm a G 
 I'm even worse 'cause 
 I got soldiers slim livin' free 
 Get no sleep 
 I think I'm a miss somethin' 
 And I'm a hustler 
 So when I sleep 
 I miss money 
 And I'm a get money 
 One way or another 
 If you ain't know 
 I'm a go-gettin' muthafucka 
 But this thing ain't nothin' 
 I ain't even got started yet 
 Get yo head 
 Choppa City boys up next 
 Everybody wonderin' what's my next move 
 I'm a just tell ya 
 It's a seven-figure groove
