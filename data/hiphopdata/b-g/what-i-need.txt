(Singing Over B.G.Talking) 
 Yeah you already know how it is in the streets (uh huh) 
 You already know how it is (you already know I ain't gotta tell you) 
 You gotta stay on top of it, you gotta stay on the grind 
 You can't let them hoes get in ya way (never ever, ever, ever...) 
 You know I mean you can play with 'em but to a certain extent 
 (Chorus - Conrad) 
 What I Need in my life seems so hard to find (so hard - so hard - so hard) 
 Gotta get up on my grind 'cause I'm runnin' out of time (it's like I'm runnin' out of time) 
 Well my momma always told me only the strong survive (only the strong survive) 
 And all the pain in my eyes, gotta make it out alive 
 (Verse 1 - B.G.) 
 Look I'm hard as they come and niggaz know that 
 And if I fuck with a hoe and leave I can't go back 
 I'm too true to the game dogg I can't slip 
 My baby momma the only one got me pussy whipped 
 I got two's, and threes and they know how it go 
 Respect it or check it or they gotta hit the road 
 I chase money like niggaz chase ass in the Pen 
 And I need a few mills before the years end 
 I pop my collar in the club, get my drank on 
 And in the winter man I gotta put the mink on 
 I'm a pimp I got my picks and chooses with 'em 
 I got too many already I don't know what to do with 'em 
 But I'm a keep my head up like a big dogg 
 Get this money, fuck these hoes and say fuck all y'all 
 I gotta heart I'm a man I can get serious 
 But I'm chasin money right now man I gotta get it 
 (Verse 3 - B.G.) 
 Niggaz thought I was threw from that other click 
 Look how far I done came with this Chopper City shit 
 I gotta hold this shit down can't give it up 
 Slim will turn in his grave if I don't live it up 
 I put God first, family second, and money third 
 So my fourth option gotta be gettin' off these birds 
 My momma give me all she could, I don't know 
 How the streets just came and grabbed me by the throat 
 But I'm in them now and I ain't turnin' back 
 And I ain't turnin' no corners without it on my lap 
 Nigga I'm in the trap you can ask anybody 
 You want beef I ain't trippin' you can see me about it 
 I'm bout whatever partna believe what I say 
 If I get uncomfortable I'm a unload the K 
 My plans and dreams get bigga everyday 
 So every night I gotta get on my knees and pray
