Where my niggas at it's play it raw time baby 
 Load up the guns guerrilla war time baby 
 Light up the blunts light up the block time dawg 
 Choppers with drums ozzee's and glock time dawg 
 Whoever he with they better stay 'cause they to nice 
 And whoever and hit jump out the window and get it right 
 Then we run in his house and hit the body and haul them out 
 Then we empty the clip and let the Lord sort 'em out 
 Bust it really, it ain't no stopping me 'cause I hang up to that ville 
 And now I'm tying on my bandanna and I'm cocking back 
 Jump out the Hummer and say lil shorty wear your stocking cap 
 Dog we got automatics, two shooters, six shots, and 50 round drums 
 Hit your daddy, you suki, you son, your wife and move your momma 
 'Cause I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain 
 Got a sawd oil tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain 
 Tell em' 
 Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga 
 Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie! 
 Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga 
 Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie! 
 If drama come to me then it come 
 For that I got two glocks and a k with a drum 
 That's what I ride with not what I got got ducked off 
 The mac, sweeper, the six shot, pump that sawd off 
 I got the tillery when beef kick 
 I got soldiers ready to march when that beef start 
 I got niggas be in that zone on that heroin 
 I got niggas ready to kill when shit get real 
 I got niggas that play all out akirts of the field 
 So get caught up in that place and your brain get spilled 
 Oh it's a game but it's a game of life or death 
 You lose and can't continue if you get dome checked 
 You get blues it's all what duck gonna be next 
 Come in that water and get wet 
 Think you can fuck with me, you thoughts will get upset 
 I don't shot to hit I shot to kill 
 Believe me I don't shoot for fun when I shoot it's for real 
 Come on nigga! 
 Give me the guns, I'm ready to bust one nigga 
 My nuts hung nigga, since I was young nigga 
 I get dumb nigga, with the M-1 nigga 
 I sip some nigga, and I flip some nigga 
 A uptown stunter, what the hell you think 
 Ready for war, but I ain't no captain of no got damn tank! 
 And you can take that to vegillity boy 
 I'm burning up, I'm on fire is you smelling boy 
 'Cause I be coming with the top down 
 Letting them know how the chop sound 
 100 rounds tore the whole entire block down 
 Assault rifle with a drum and beam totter 
 38 with a speed loader in my holster 
 Mac ozze achine with a strap around my shoulder 
 But if I pop my trunk I'm might just set off a damn explosure 
 I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain 
 Got a sawd oil tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain 
 Tell em'

 You ain't gotta hollar wodie, here I come nigga!
