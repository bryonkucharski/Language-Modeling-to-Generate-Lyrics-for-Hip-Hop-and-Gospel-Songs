Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash 
 Catch me on the block in the '07 Jag 
 'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle 
 Rubber band 'round my money and my neck full of ice 
 When you see me on the block, I got it for the right price 
 'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle 
 However you gotta get it, nigga, get that dough 
 Spit that flow, flip that hoe 
 Push that dro, or pimp that hoe 
 You know the work in the house, go kick that door 
 I make that money, Jizzle, chase that money 
 Yeah, you know I ball, and I drink that money 
 All in my sleep, I could taste that money 
 I go to jail, fuck it, buy the case with the money 
 When you got the game up, you go waste that money 
 Let me spit in your face, yeah, show me that ya love me 
 At the end of the day, a gangster don't trust ya 
 For money over bitches, can't knock the hustle 
 Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash

 My hustle getting strong, gotta be strong 
 I hold my whole family down on, on 
 I'm in the rap game helpin' on as one of the thugs 
 And the faith on my click, we only smoking the drugs 
 See this year I'm doing a rave, last year I did purps 
 This year I want stick, last year I got a dub 
 Pass me the bud, let me give you a sweet 
 Pass me the cush, let me take the heat 
 Pass me a beep, I don't recall what's next 
 Ya, I left you the other day, gon' go get another chick 
 He deserves sick, but the strips okay 
 She's appreciate whenever she get K 
 Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash

 One thing for sure is a nigga gon' eat 
 One thing for sure is a nigga gon' get it 
 Show me a sweet hustle, B Gizzle gon' hit it 
 Chopper City, the business, how you think I made it double? 
 I hustled and I struggled and I hustled and I struggled 
 Can't be ending now, real niggas never stop 
 Quit, I think not, man, I do it for the block 
 I was still hot, running shit through the pot 
 Now I'm on it like, gimme that number one spot 
 Wanna learn how to grind, sit back and watch
