(B.G.) 
 Uh yeah nigga yeah-shit real round here 
 Uh yeah nigga yeah-shit real round here 
 If you want it, you can get it my nigga-cause shit real round here 
 If you want it, you can get it my nigga-shit 
 (Verse 1 - B.G.) 
 Look if you ain't know ask somebody they'll tell you 'bout me 
 Nothin' fake, nothin' fraud, nothin' bitch about me 
 I'm a G I been runnin' these streets since a youngin 
 Since fourteen I been buckin, slangin heat ain't nothin' 
 You want beef say somethin' you can get it I ain't trippin' 
 Once it's on just know you better not let me catch you slippin 
 Cause wherever we meet I'm a smash ya 
 Broad day light or around the club I'm a get at ya 
 If you let me tip down on you nigga you chaptered 
 I guarantee ya that it's gon'be a closed casket 
 I'm bout this what's understood don't need to be explained 
 Before the money and the fame I was a gangsta in the game 
 I ain't lyin' when I tell you about me and my background 
 About me or my life style I ain't never backed down 
 I ain't never froze up, I ain't never turned state 
 I ain't never missed when I empty the clip out the K, nigga 
 (Chorus - B.G.Repeat 4X) 
 However you want it nigga - you could get it 'cause shit real 
 It's get it how you live - you could kill or be killed 
 (Verse 2 - B.G.) 
 It's never die, do or get did nothin' less fuck with the kidd 
 Get tooled to the head, tooled to the chest 
 Nigga I'm the best when it come to this street shit 
 You got ya hands full fuckin' with me with this beef shit 
 I be on some all night flight, no sleep shit 
 Me, my dogg and two K's fuck that four deep shit 
 We comin' with it - hundred round drummin with it 
 You runnin' from it - we runnin' with it, you bitch ass niggaz ain't fuckin' with it 
 I'm out c'here head first ready to go head up 
 Walkin' with ya head down, bound to get ya head bust 
 Oh here the feds come I'm off the scene, off the block 
 I know to bust and move when it get hot 
 Shut down the shop open up another on the other side of town 
 Got yay and I got browns, Gizzle was a hustler and a headbuster all in one 
 Don't get it twisted I do this rap shit for fun, ya heard 
 (Chorus - B.G.Repeat Till End) 
 However you want it nigga - you could get it 'cause shit real 
 It's get it how you live - you could kill or be killed
