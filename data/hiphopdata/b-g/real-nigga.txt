(Talking) 
 It's B.Gizzle ya number one original hot boy 
 Nigga already know whassup with me 
 Nigga already know my status 
 If you don't know you better ask somebody, look 
 (Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X) 
 I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga 
 I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger 
 You never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga 
 I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga 
 (Verse 1 - B.G.) 
 You know me I'm a solider no doubt 
 My reputation already confirm what I'm about 
 I'm a hustler you can always catch me in the streets 
 Puttin' it down, makin' moves cause Gizzle gotta eat 
 Feds tryna lock me up and throw away the key 
 They know I gotta enough work well I could throw away a ki 
 If you wanna get on ya feet then holla at me 
 Can't sell 'em for ten but I can throw 'em for sixteen 
 I chase that money and I stack that money 
 Bitch nigga try to play me I'm a smash that dummy 
 I ain't playin' with you niggaz go on and run up on a G 
 They'll be callin, tellin' ya momma her son is in the street 
 How you want it, you can get - how you want it, I can bring it 
 You wanna early funeral trust me I can arrange it 
 I'm a man about my mine no reppin, no stuntin 
 New Orleans is the dungeon so what you talkin' is nothin' 
 (Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X) 
 I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga 
 I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger 
 You never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga 
 I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga 
 (Verse 2 - B.G.) 
 Okay a man always look another man in his eye 
 I'm talkin' to you - you lookin' at the ground I know why 
 You a busta, you a fake, you a bitch, you a lame 
 You should've stayed on the porch you ain't ready for the game 
 Got my first stripe at twelve, second stripe at thirteen 
 Third stripe a year later then pronounced the B.G. 
 Fourth stripe at fifteen now I'm captain of the team 
 I was suppose to be at school, but on the corner sellin weed 
 Before I made eighteen I'm a sergeant now 
 Fuckin' hoes, gettin' money sellin quarters now 
 Before I made twenty one I was a lieutenant 
 It's a war goin' on and dogg I'm all in it 
 I ain't tryna turn back this my life I'm a live it 
 I ain't gotta come now so if you trip I'm a send it 
 I'm in full command I'm the Chopper City general 
 So believe it's nothin' to get rid of you 
 (Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X) 
 I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga 
 I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger 
 You never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga 
 I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga
