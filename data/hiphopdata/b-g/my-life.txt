(B.G. Talking) 
 I was born 1980 September 3rd 
 That's the day checks come out and vics gets served 
 So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain 
 My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game 
 They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood 
 I was raised on the block my mom did what she could 
 Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo 
 But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin' dough 
 I made b's n c's up in to 5th grade 
 It went to d's n f's 'cause I didn't want to behave 
 I was the class clown Christopher raise hair 
 I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled 
 Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside 
 I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time 
 The police spotted me id break out and run 
 Make 'em run behind me that was my way of having fun 
 Somewhere in 87 might have been 88 
 I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way 
 They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh* 
 I'm a cut this boy short 'cause my moms was involved 
 (B.G. Talking) 
 You can put it together it was what it wasn't 
 Nah cakes to be baked but she had cakes in the owen 
 She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up 
 If I knew what I know now I would of took it 'n' cut it up 
 92 roll round that's when it got real 
 My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed 
 Cash Money Records was started that same year 
 That's when my thuggin' started I was gettin' it how I live 
 My moma needed help I was outta control 
 The streets took me under I was on a dead end row 
 The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up 
 Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up 
 He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin' me 
 Took me to studio from that we made history 
 (B.G. Talking) 
 In the mid east of that I was doin' my thang 
 And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne 
 That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha 
 Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him 
 Universal up to deal we went to get mills 
 That's when nigga decided to not keep it real 
 I had a idea I didn't want to believe it 
 I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy 
 I had a dope habbit and markie was on my back 
 So he turned his back but look how I shookback 
 You know how it go you get up when you fall 
 The streets all over they rooted for the underdog 
 I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team 
 And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team 
 From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville 
 Play if you want and you see how the gat feel 
 That was all in my past L.T. dog I miss ya 
 Its Uptown 4 life Chopper City Records the official
