(B.G.) 
 Uh-huh 
 Ah, Ah, Whoa, Whoa 
 I'm a guerilla, I'm a dog, I'm a beast, I'm a snake 
 The type that will walk up and put 10 hollows to your face 
 I'm a tiger, I'm a lion, I'm a bear, I'm a panther 
 If you ballin' I'ma be the one that's gonna snatch ya 
 I'm a fool, when I'm beefin I give niggaz the blues 
 Don't think twice, first mind tell me do what I gotta do 
 So I gather up my clique, load up the fucking iron 
 Gas up the creep mobile, jump in that bitch and ride 
 When I catch ya I'ma do ya, I'ma smoke ya, I'ma kill ya 
 I'ma spank ya, I'ma whack ya, Geezy gone deal witcha 
 I don't play, I don't asshole B.G. don't lollygag 
 I get these pussy niggaz ready for their body bag 
 I'ma a clown but I ain't the type that play with ya child 
 I'm the type that go chicka-blowe chicka blowe 
 Ya heard me, watch out when that thang in my hand 
 I'ma an untamed animal, straight a clean up man 
 Chorus 2X: [Juvenile] 
 I'ma animal in the jungle so you better beware 
 It ain't nothing but guerillas, lion, tigers, and bears 
 I'ma game red-nosed pit ready to scratch 
 Got you running like a bitch tryin' to avoid the attack 
 (B.G.) 
 I ain't no rabbit, I ain't no rat 
 I'ma a soldier that will give you hell 
 I ain't cat, I ain't no turtle get in beef and hide in a shell 
 I ain't no mutt, I ain't no monkie, far from being a duck 
 Believe me I can swim so come in that water, try your luck 
 You gonna drown, guarantee you go under you won't come up 
 I'm from Uptown and Uptown niggaz don't give a fuck 
 My hood is a jungle full of niggaz live that wild life 
 Picture a untamed guerilla with a K (AK) he nothing nice 
 So you know you get in his way, you lose your life 
 So reverse that, get in front of me, you lose your life 
 I'm like a alligator crocodile, quietly I lay 
 Then slip, get comfortable, I'll strike and kill a prey 
 Take the life out em', stand there and watch him stop breathing 
 Watch him fade into the other world, but one day I'll see him 
 But for now FUCK em', see ya when I see ya nigga 
 I know at this moment I wouldn't wanna be ya nigga 
 I'm a lil' creeper, quick like a cheetah, so better (?????) 
 When I tell you freeze, when I was down for my heater 
 People say I'm dangerous, I need a leash and a collar 
 'Cause I'm like a ROCK (rocwilder) but much more wilder 
 If You got it, and I want it, I'll duct tape ya 
 Gotta a lock like a pit bull, get a hold of you and shake ya 
 Ain't now way You gone stomp at me, I feel you trying to play me 
 I'm like Mike when I bite, I give ya bitch ass Rabies 
 From tree to tree, block to block I be hanging 
 Nuts swanging, thuggin', fuck it I'm looking mangy 
 I gives a fuck, I live wild life like jungle animals 
 Catch Us gettin' how we live on Discovery Channel 
 You gotta be a snake that creep and know how to survive 
 Pussy cats got nine lives, dogs like me got one life 
 So we gotta manage it 
 We feel threatened by anything we gotta handle it 
 We living scandalous 
 (Animal and jungle sounds at the end)
