(Webbie Repeat 4X) 
 I ain't no bitch (I ain't no) 
 (Verse 1 - Webbie) 
 Mayne I was raised around a bunch of niggaz who don't play around 
 Some go getter ass niggaz fuck that waitin 'round 
 Some ol'lawyer ass warriors if you hatin' 'round 
 I lay you down with about eighty rounds 
 I'm the savage, young boss knock me, get knocked off 
 Pussy nigga - bye, bye I'm finna buy another house 
 Hate on me nigga why it don't matter I'm a count big stacks 
 Ridin' Lac's - blowin' killa by the ounce 
 Hennesy, yes I'm deep fuckin' run up in yo house 
 Holdin' it down for Pimp C y'all need to let that nigga out 
 Like keep it cool nigga shit but don't mess a nigga out 
 I'm a grown man with kids I'll stretch a nigga out 
 This for my soldiers, who ain't gon'even roll it up if it ain't doja 
 If you ain't earned no fuckin' stripes you ain't rollin' 
 Play with me I'll knock ya shit wide open 
 (Chorus - Webbie) 
 I ain't no bitch (I ain't no bitch) 
 I can't let no nigga punk me 
 I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me 
 But I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played 
 From the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch 
 Just say it death around the corner 
 Run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it 
 'Cause I ain't no bitch 
 If I ain't sayin' shit I'm sayin', I ain't no bitch 
 Fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch 
 (Verse 2 - VL Mike) 
 Geezy done told you already we two for one nigga 
 Alot of shit you boys talkin' I already done it nigga 
 I got the call cause a nigga know how to dog it out 
 Blocked out twenty four hours with killers from the south 
 They don't know 'bout the real, can't even spell it nigga 
 I hate ol'bitch ass type to run and go tell it nigga 
 With or without a pistol they know I stand alone 
 Better stick to rappin' nigga I check you off ya dome 
 I'm too hard for the public, too uncut for the TV 
 You want that gangsta, guerilla shit it's already in me 
 Studio makin' I'm hard so I'm bringin'it harder 
 Yeah I'm that first degree aggrivated man slaughter 
 Me I'll get ignorant with it yeah they know how I rock 
 Pray to God, me, T, and Kev' don't ever hit ya block 
 So nigga call ya people nigga go call ya click 
 I done told you I ain't, I ain't... 
 (Chorus - Webbie) 
 I ain't no bitch (I ain't no bitch) 
 I can't let no nigga punk me 
 I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me 
 But I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played 
 From the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch 
 Just say it death around the corner 
 Run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it 
 'Cause I ain't no bitch 
 If I ain't sayin' shit I'm sayin', I ain't no bitch 
 Fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch 
 (Verse 3 - B.G.) 
 Look every since I was young I been standin my ground 
 Since eleven or twelve, Gizzle been holdin' it down 
 I come up off V - L in the heart of uptown 
 I don't get spooked I'm use to that - blucker, blucker sound 
 Any nigga wanna bring it to me - I'm a bring it back 
 They want be able to make no money where they slang that 
 'Cause everyday I'm a be spendin where they hangin' at 
 That AK 47 never stop when I'm bangin' that 
 Oh yeah it's real homey, I don't be stuntin partna 
 Be on ya P's and Q's first time you slip I got ya 
 Put it on everything I'm a break you off proper 
 That's how we roll in the N.O. this the city of choppers 
 It ain't nothin' to me beef is all that I know 
 Snatch niggaz holdin' onto they folks out they door 
 I never been a square, a busta, or snitch 
 But most important I ain't no bitch... 
 (Chorus - Webbie) 
 I ain't no bitch (I ain't no bitch) 
 I can't let no nigga punk me 
 I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me 
 But I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played 
 From the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch 
 Just say it death around the corner 
 Run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it 
 'Cause I ain't no bitch 
 If I ain't sayin' shit I'm sayin', I ain't no bitch 
 Fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch
