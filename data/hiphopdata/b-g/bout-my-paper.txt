(Talking) B.G. 
 Uh-huh I'm bout my feddi by all means 
 Look here I be on a paper chase I'm all about my cheddar 
 I ain't touching the mic if it ain't five Gs or better 
 I plan never to fall short again 
 I want game 
 Wootay I'ma tell ya no pain no gain 
 I hustle hard for what I want that's how I get it 
 I struggle hard and if its out there I'm goin' get it 
 If ya see CMR a dollar sign on the CD 
 Somewhere on there you'll see featuring the B.G. 
 Me and my nigga B like Suge and Pac 
 We gettin' our shine on all the way to the top 
 Look ain't no stoppin' us boy don't try 
 When you hear it once it ain't no secret you go and buy 
 You can lie bout this stunt bout that 
 You can't dodge these fifty shots I'm bout ta rat-tat-tat 
 Ain't nothin' change still a busta wig splitter 
 Straight hustle for my chesse I'ma money go-getter 
 Bout my paper my chesse so before my eyes close 
 I want my green ta add up ta six zeros 
 Get yo fetti nigga somebody playa hate split'em 
 Get yo fetti nigga somebody stop you kill'em 
 It's all about Benjamins that's all I wanna have 
 Ducked off in my house with a hoe takin' a bubble bath 
 Sparklin' marble coverin' all my room floors 
 A maid in a bathin' suit doin' my house chores 
 Do not disturb sign on my bedroom door 
 'Cause my dick gettin' ate by my number one whore 
 Look I'm money hungry 
 Bout actin' a donkey 
 No longer a junkie 
 I got rid of that monkey 
 I'm cheeky I don't want you fuckin' with my shit 
 My neck and my knuckles covered with crushed out shit 
 Sparklin' gold cover my muthafuckin' grill 
 Pockets filled with big head hundred dollar bills 
 Fuckin' up this rap game with these wicked rap skills 
 And ain't far from makin' Gs ta makin' mills 
 I'm a treal B.G. uptown hard hitter 
 On the real my nigga I'ma money go-getter 
 Oh I gotta get it gotta grab it 
 Gotta have it 
 Like snortin' dope but snortin' coke is a habit 
 I gotta see it gotta feel it 
 Quick ta spin it 
 Shoot dice all day with my niggas tryin' ta win it 
 I rap hustle 'cause I'm a hustlin' ass nigga 
 Also a gat totter bout bustin' some ass nigga 
 So you can play with me bout my chesse 
 You gotta go fool in a casket six feet deep 
 Sellin' tapes and CDs 
 Like sellin' pick threes 
 Ring up a million sales we done hit the lottery 
 I'm a benjamin chaser 
 Playa hata eraser 
 Police have no case 
 'Cause I do murders without a trace 
 I'm almost at home I done past third base 
 I'm playin' with five figures when I get six I'm straight 
 If I catch yo bitch down bad I'ma hit her 
 Paper chaser nigga B.G. a money go-getter
