(Talking) 
 It's like I'm the Heart Of Tha Street Knah'I'm'sayin' 
 You already know a body can't operate without a heart Knah'I'm'sayin' 
 So if the heart stop then the street stops bumpin 
 If you could catch me not strapped nigga you good 
 Come out the house without the pistol I wish I would 
 Haters would love to catch me slippin but nigga please 
 I know these streets to well they a part of me 
 I'm a fool I feel like I'm the best 
 I take ya old lady-get my name tatted on her chest 
 I leave the ass soaked, I leave the pussy wet 
 I give her back to you then move on to who next 
 I hold the block down green, white, and brown 
 Cross Martin Luther King on Velle uptown 
 I live by the code, I die by the code 
 Don't rat, don't snitch, don't bend, don't fold Let's go! 
 When I was young man I got lost in the streets 
 But now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz 
 When I was young man I got lost in the streets 
 But now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz 
 When I was young man I got lost in the streets 
 But now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz 
 When I was young man I got lost in the streets 
 But now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz 
 All the hood niggaz feel me 
 And I ain't hard to find since I got money-the hood is where I still be 
 Post up ciggerette hangin' from my lip 
 Glock in my pocket you see it I extended the clip 
 No joke-nigga no game 
 Dogg it's all real with me it's no playin' 
 I walk it how I talk it, I play it how it go 
 Only three words I tell them people is "I-Don't-Know" 
 You say you 'bout this, you say you 'bout that 
 I heard nigga bust at you and you ain't bust back 
 You say you so this, you say you so that 
 I did an investigation nigga you ain't sold jack what's that? 
 Man I sleep with the tigers, I eat with the bears 
 However you want it believe that I can take it there 
 It's real in the field dogg, kill or be killed homes 
 Pop or get popped up-walk or get walked on 
 Steal or get stole dogg-pimp or get pimped nigga 
 Shake or get shook dogg... flip or get flipped nigga 
 Step or get stepped on pop or get popped up 
 Watch what you say on the phone will get you locked up 
 Shoot or get shot dogg, do or get done nigga 
 If you a man always stand and never run nigga 
 That's how I play it man Gizzle a G 
 If you ain't know (uh oh) man I'm the heart of the street
