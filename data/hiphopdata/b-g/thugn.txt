(B.G.) 
 I be thugging and it ain't no secret 
 I run game so when it rains on me I can peep it 
 My mind frame set on stacking six figures plus 
 I let 'em hang so when shit gets real heads get bust 
 I ain't the one that gets caught up and see an early grave 
 Being all the way true to the game is how I was raised 
 Niggas I came up under got nothing but street ways 
 Niggas I came up under tote nothing but AK's 
 They sat me down schooled me where at an early age 
 So off top I lay it down when I feel played 
 Meet Lil fat Kenny, Faire and my dog schraie 
 When I catch you down bad, where you stand is where you lay 
 I don't plan for the future, I live day for day 
 Cross my path I'll execute cha, respect what I say 
 VL niggas play it raw, you could trust that 
 I got the key in the car me and Baby got the glock and map 
 We thugged out 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 I be thugging and it ain't no secret 
 I run game so when it rains on me I can peep it 
 I represent to the fullest what you bout I'm bout 
 Freedom or jail I'm always gonna be thugged out, thugged out 
 (B.G.) 
 Lil Geezy be thugging to the fullest 
 Stay strapped, so when drama kickin' ready to pull it 
 You want beef with my niggas, look here bring it on 
 I'm bout that dome checkin', and I'm gone let it be known 
 I'm a roam, through your hood when I see you duck 
 Whoevers on the block gets two 'cause I drop my nuts 
 Realism is in my nature that's how its gotta be 
 I'm a fire that can't be put out ain't no stopping me 
 They don't call B.G. a Hot Boy for nothing 
 I'm bout gangster shit, and hoes know I'm working with something 
 I was chillin' in Timbermen with my dogs thugging 
 Some niggas buckin 
 But alot of niggas button 
 The UPT is where I stunt, nigga that's my hometown 
 And everybody knows that on Sunday it be going down 
 So until I die I'ma be about that street shit 
 I'm bout mine 
 And I ain't the one you wanna beef with 
 I'm thugged out 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 (B.G.) 
 Look my block hot the law sleep every other day 
 We beefin off top, we creep every other day 
 My dog Malcolm on a charge, he gets parole up in May 
 He told me where he left the glock, K ???? 
 I run with niggas that's bout drama, well let's get funky 
 Slip I duct tape your momma, my dogs are donkeys 
 We bout are business, so you better act like you know 
 Play possum, so it's a must we play you like a fuckin' hoe 
 I'm true to the game, play it exactly how it goes 
 I lay my rep down with the Benz off the showroom floor 
 I'm swimming in a pool of hundreds 
 Lil Dougie be thuggin', but Lil Dougie got beacoup money 
 Niggas know my click had the crowd buckin' 
 Niggas know my click is the click that be on T.V. stuntin' 
 Niggas know my click is the click, play with us and we bustin' 
 Niggas know my click is the click that be straight thuggin' 
 We thugged out 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 (B.G. Talking) 
 Off top 
 It's not a doubt that I gotta floss 
 The hater wanna see me ducked out for sho 
 I ain't even much have'n that ya heard me 
 My whole click thugging 
 That's just how we do it

 Fuck that however
