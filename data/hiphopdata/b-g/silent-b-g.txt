Fuck it nigga I got two choices rap or slang 
 Yeah I choose this rap thing nigga 
 But I don't knock no nigga for they hustle play it how it go nigga 
 Nigga I cause grief and trouble, funerals 
 Trying to come up on six numerals 
 Riding high in fly with a game with no rules 
 Got a K cooked blues fore these fools 
 Slinging coke by the ton, weed by the pound 
 Her-on by the bundle, ship it on greyhounds 
 Traveling through uptown with dumbness on my mind 
 Don't wine cause play it nigga I ain't even tryin' 
 You dying beefin with these niggas I cruise with 
 Yo head get knocked loose quick 
 It's all on you bitch, choose bitch 
 My life or your life you know only God know who bitch 
 Six shot pass me a six shot 
 And I'm get turned black and work like a seventeen shot glock 
 B.G. a raising star, pass me the guard 
 I'm bout that war, and these Hot Boys going take this shit far 
 Leave yo block hot like tar, four deep in a black car 
 Mask and flames five year's on each ??? 
 Like I'm hiding out like I'm the law 
 I bring heat to yo street you paranoid 
 Can't eat or sleep 
 Can't fuck you sneaking, can't have you ducking 
 Got to watch yo back on the grind 
 Cause you know the B.G. coming 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 I'm silent B.G. and you know me from thuging 
 I'm violent B.G. make my money rap hustling 
 Me and Baby virgin thigh he beef when we creeping 
 Swerving yo Benz every night no rest and no sleeping 
 We hustle serious with this rap like we playing in the playoffs 
 Bitch nigga's lagging catch the side line and lay-off 
 We bout that paper lil daddy 
 We bout that drama lil mama 
 Ask my nigga's till after the next life living like Big Tymers 
 Chillin' like villains drinkin' like a gas tank 
 Before attemptin to check nigga thank you should of thank 
 We tossin these bitches, but ain't flossin our riches 
 Buy some t-shit with pictures 
 For my niggas and bitches still wishing they was here 
 But they gone not forgotten 
 But in memory I'm strapped up ridin', you know me nigga 
 Bout getting my figga's bigger nigga 
 And to few I'm ignorant I pull the trigger nigga 
 I'm a 9-1-1 hitter nigga 
 Oh oh a thuged out wig splitter nigga 
 Trying to sparkle in this world like glitter nigga 
 Rolexes up diamonds all over me nigga 
 I'm a thug to I'm rested, play it real till I'm dead 
 True to my blood no comin' between us no matter what nigga 
 Coke dealer, dope dealer 
 Juvenile ain't no joke nigga 
 Fuck being broke all the way out got you on scope nigga 
 But I cooled off cause now I'm chillin' 
 'Cause I got this feelin' rappin' I'm going to make a million 
 So I do my thang represent and keep it street 
 You ain't going to disrespect me 'cause I will sweep you of your seat 
 I ain't goin' to stop that late better yet

 Fade me, Juvi, B.G. 13th that where the fuck I be 
 From the week loose my high real deep chill on the block 
 With a glock glock cocked quit sellin coke 
 Fuck gettin' cough, buy the cops but fuck that 
 Strapped with the chopper or get chopped trust that

 'Cause I'm stop or get stopped so you love that

 All 17 come up out the glock 
 Oh that's a must black, all 50 come out the chop 
 Bitch nigga you bleed I'm bout cheese 
 You know what I do and that's how I proceed
