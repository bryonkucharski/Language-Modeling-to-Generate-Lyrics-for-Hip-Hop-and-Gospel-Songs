Hook: I've got problems 
 In my fucking house 
 Bitch would you please 
 Get the fuck out 
 Trust these hoes, they all slick 
 I found out, they ain't shit 
 Almost was played by my main bitch 
 Over, she tried to pull 1 on quick 
 I'm paperchasing, trying to get rich 
 On a 68 tour with my clique 
 She hit me while I'm on the road and was like 
 Babe shit bad cause moms spend a few nights 
 I say yeah, its cool 
 But now, check what this hoe do 
 Slickly moving momma in my house 
 Cause picture the whole wild she put out 
 Now dat ain't even the half of it 
 Wit moms come 2 neices, 2 nephews, 2 cousins 
 They done got comfortable in my shit 
 Churin don't flush the toilet after they piss 
 Bitches, wild kids, jumping and playing 
 Break lamps, wasting food and leaving stains 
 Mom laying in my lazy boy 
 Kids jamming tapes in my VCR 
 Flipping my TV like a light switch 
 God can only stop me from killing this bitch 
 I'm on the way back to my crib 
 I pull up, "this can't be how I live" 
 I jump out ready, to start bucking 
 I'm pissed off, mad and disgusted 
 Bitch tryna give me a excuse 
 It ain't nothing you can say or do 
 You ask the moms stay, cause shit was bad 
 You ain't said nothing bout cha whole fam 
 Look at my shit, it's fucked up 
 And it smell like a project cut 
 You ain't had the decency to clean up 
 You, ya ma, and children, can pack up 
 Please hurry before I go off 
 And mess around in here and catch a charge 
 You don showed me, you ain't shit 
 You showed me, a bitch gon be a bitch 
 Look what you don caused in my house 
 Before you get pissed (the whip) get out 
 Hook: I've got problems 
 In my fucking house

 Here's another fucked up episode 
 My cousin came to visit from Chicago 
 I ain't seen him since we was young bucks 
 I turned thug, and he wannabe with the bustas 
 So why he down visiting, he staying wit me 
 I put him under surveillance learned him in a week 
 He don't put 100% in his hygenes 
 He lied and stunned bout what he doing be in the streetz 
 He eating, he shitting, he sleeping, all for free 
 He ain't cleaning behind his self, he think it's the double tree 
 I'm almost to the point to ask him 
 What's happening? But I know, he get smart, I'ma slap him 
 Now I gotta leave him by his self for the weekend 
 I gotta fly to handle business in Cleaveland 
 I jet and this nigga go through my phone numbers 
 Call em', tell him I got him a surprise party, come over 
 So happen that I'm finished a day early 
 And decide to fly back home and check on this bitch 
 I get down, fucked up my shit packed like a nightclub 
 Sofa's ripped, tape is broke and it's full of weed smoke 
 Nigga got it coming, every tooth in his mouth 
 I'ma knock-out, I can't believe what he did to my house
