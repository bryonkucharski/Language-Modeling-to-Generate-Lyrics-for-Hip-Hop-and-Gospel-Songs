(Talking) 
 (Paul Wall) 
 What they talkin' 'bout baby - Paul Wall, Swisha House 
 (B.G.) 
 And this B.Gizzle - the heart of the streetz 
 (Paul Wall) 
 It go down knah'I'm'talkin' bout, bangin' screw 
 (B.G.) 
 H-Town, N.O. connection 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Knah'I'm'talkin' 
 (B.G.) 
 Let's go! 
 (Chorus - Yung Redd) 
 I know you hate when I get tired of that slab - then switch to another 
 My partner do the same - mayne they all differant colors 
 Got candy paint drippin, you in my trunk stutter (st - stutter) 
 It's the state I'm in that'll tell you I'm a hustler (hustler) 
 I'm throwin' up the duece and givin' dap 
 Comin' down the boulevard just holdin' slab 
 Aye I'm throwin' up the duece and givin' dap 
 Comin' down the boulevard just holdin' slab 
 (Verse 1 - B.G.) 
 You know me B.Geezy from way back 
 Before they made the Phanthom's, or they made the Maybach's 
 It was Impala this - it was 'Lac that 
 It was loud rump, wood grain, and wet - wet 
 Times changed niggaz stuntin game picked up 
 You can stay at home if ya whip ain't whipped up 
 Cause you done slipped up hoes ain't even peepin' 
 If ya shit ain't mean, and ya grill ain't blingin' 
 I'm comin' hard dogg everyday of the week 
 Black Benz, black Range, black Infinity Jeep 
 The black Porsche truck got the freak bendin over 
 The camoflauge truck it's representin solider 
 (Verse 2 - Paul Wall) 
 Move out the way baby boy here I come 
 I'm the topical discussion like that boy Vince Young 
 I'm on the boulevard holdin'workin wood grain wheel 
 Top down, sun shinin on my ice tray grill 
 The car fresh out the wash no soap, just water 
 Turnin' everybodies head with my remote control starter 
 I'm a head turner flippin in my old school dropper 
 Tippin down on 8 - 4's look, oh so proper 
 I'm flossin with my partner Memphis in that black on black 
 Wavin trunk down West Park to make the boppers attract 
 Them hoes don't know how to act - I'm hoggin lane in the Lac 
 And I'm a keep on ridin' swangers till them hoes start to clack... baby 
 (Verse 3 - B.G.) 
 If you can get it, I got it... if you have it, I had it 
 From the Lex, to the Benz, from Denali, to Caddi 
 Ridin'fly no doubt twenty - fo's and up 
 I'm ridin' slow cause purple kool aid in my cup 
 I'm a down south boy you know we shine 
 You workin with somethin' you hear them hoes holla (waaah) 
 My pockets on swoll, my whip on beam 
 I started that shit so you know my wrist bling 
 I went to H - Town to see Paul Wizzy 
 I left with my grizzy lookin' so pretty 
 Got diamonds from the bottom - to the top of my grill 
 These couple hundred thousands tryin' to turn into a mill
