First Verse: 
 Stop it right there, I dare you to cross that line 
 Do it I'ma feel you ain't respectin' my mind 
 I gets loose, backed up, with long toys 
 It's no truce fuckin' with these hot boys 
 Do whatever it takes to wipe your clique off the Earth, 
 Both cliques can't live, somebody gotta see dirt, 
 What makes you think I'ma let'cha ride first? 
 Try to hide out, that makes shit worse 
 Believe I'm comin', a hundred in the drum and, 
 I don't spanked somethin', 
 Got the set wonderin', 
 Bitch niggas runnin', 
 Cable is comin', 
 That's what'cha get THINK I ain't bout nothin', 
 You done been showed, brains blowed, 
 You should have knowed, New Orleans carry no hoes 
 Say what's up to Satan, B.G. ain't 'bout no fakin',

 You think I ain't gone split a wig? Think again, 
 You guessin' and underestimatin' "U" all "N" 
 You think I ain't gone split a wig? "U" all "N" 
 You guessin' and understimatin', think again 
 You think I ain't gone split a wig? Think again, 
 You guessin' and underestimatin' "U" all "N" 
 You think I ain't gone split a wig? "U" all "N" 
 You guessin' and understimatin', think again

 Remember I tear down both sides of the street, 
 Nigga I be, the Ca$h Money B.G., 
 Ain't no sleep if you beef with me,

 Sendin' messages, say I'ma bitch you'll leave me wet 
 I can't believe you believe I take death threats, 
 You're wrong Wootay, you're absolutely wrong 
 Now it's on Wootay, your seventeen damagin' health, 
 That's another spankin' completed under my belt, 
 Your Mom in black on the floor her seein' that her son done been left, 
 Brains cooked like a chef, too late for Doctors to help, 
 It's All On U, you brought that issue on yourself, 
 Think you could know me, got kicked off the shelf, 
 I hustle with muscle just to increase my wealth, 
 Nigga say what's up to Satan, B.G. ain't 'bout no fakin', 
 I handle mine with no debatin', stop underestimatin' 
 Think... fore you get checkmated
