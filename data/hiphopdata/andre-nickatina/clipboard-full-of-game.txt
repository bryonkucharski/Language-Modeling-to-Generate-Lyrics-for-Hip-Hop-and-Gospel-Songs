Go 'head Romeo, Do Your Thing 
 I [?] wanna wit a freaky hoe 
 Tappin' my shoulder, said let's go 
 She turned around and said oh no 
 Ima start loadin my paniseo 
 [?] Wit a freaky dang 
 Different broad, but it's all the same 
 She said she knew how to fuck and I'm to blame 
 Woulda said somethin' back but forgot her name 
 Games don't come and getcha 
 Brang the camera witcha 
 The photographer with the nudey pictures 
 A little old trick from my boy [?] 
 She said I ain't no groupy hoe 
 I said C.E already knows 
 Girls wanna try and act straight and square 
 But super freaks in their underwear 
 Walkin' just like christopher 
 Tossin to get rid of her 
 Smooth is the way I act 
 And like jackpot I'm a playboy mac 
 Back to the first night it was Hennesy 
 And on the second it was just you and me 
 On the third, my vision was blurred 
 I don't recall 
 Understandin the word 
 Panties hangin' from the light fixture 
 She stare all day at my year book picture 
 Whisper right off my shoulder 
 My spit gets [?] my age gets gets older 
 Flousey is what you are 
 Doopie smoke broke out my car 
 Spit this game like a moccasin 
 Get this broad 
 Then floss again 
 Ease go smoke heavily 
 Breath deep, till your lungs bleed 
 Ooh. I don't run the game 
 But gangsta when I do my thang 
 Change like a dollar bill 
 Strange tell ya how to feel 
 Tame but it is so real 
 Keep my hoes rotatin like a stearin wheel 
 It's like crazy when you look at me 
 It's like baby who you tryin' to be? 
 Lazy when you hit the weed 
 It's a whole nother story when you're hangin' wit E. 
 Keep my [?] spinnin like a ceilin fan 
 Keep my donkey [?] It's supply and demand 
 Gotta be the man, get to spittin' 
 Try another broad [?] doin', what you missin' 
 Gotta whole notebook full of game, game 
 Gotta roll of decks full of bitches, bitches 
 Gotta big black book full of names, names 
 If I showed it to you, you'd think it's vicious, vicious 
 Gotta whole clipboard full of game 
 And a big black book we can write your name 
 They all the same they know what I'm about 
 I'm ready for whatever [?] did shout 
 Some hoes think we made from mud 
 But I know, It's muscle and blood 
 Grab your piece like Nick and pack it quick 
 Gotta [?] my bitch gotta get 
 I'm the big Jimmy D. Sausage King 
 Like Frank [?] so much heat to bring 
 I want a bad bitch with no limitations 
 I'm a big bad wolf when it comes to relations 
 Mouth beat like this you know I score 
 16 tons like Earnie Ford 
 Like pop like a mule, hit like a bat 
 Nothin' like listen to that gangsta rap 
 I flow so smooth called watervore 
 She fuck so good, see I taught her boy 
 It only took a few lines for me to bag it 
 I bet you didn't know I'm a pussy addict 
 It's a good thing I got groupies to [?] 
 That'll make pussy gum 
 Or a pussy patch 
 Don't get attached, if you're feelin' lucky 
 I still can't fuck without my rubber ducky
