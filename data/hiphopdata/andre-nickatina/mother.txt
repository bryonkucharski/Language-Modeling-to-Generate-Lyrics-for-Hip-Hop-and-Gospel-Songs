Mother of god 
 If you know me. 
 You know I never liked the job 
 Hustle like rock, split keys from a pot 
 Outstanding demanding. Nigga deaths' a reality 
 Brainwashed brainwaves and money mentality 
 ? Prido? python in a marathon of motherfuckin demos 
 Fuck white limos I'm dippin' buckets and rentals 
 Accidental I? Scall just one inch paper scam? 
 If I don't explain to me why I'm in your program 
 Swingin' like a golfer or better yet a batter 
 Mad like a hatter, react like a badger 
 My first step over crossover remains just the same 
 So my formula on lockdown is motherfuckin game out frame 
 Da picture perfect bulldog glance, weird like a ming 
 FUCK PORKY PIG, remain like a tattoo on you and your crew 
 The things that I do, if mother only knew 
 Shit, Mother 
 Raised on chicken and watermelon 
 Catfish and snappers 
 Godfearing nigga under pressured gat clappers 
 Sportin' timbos smokin' endo 
 Hanging out of my mazda rx-7 window, Fuck you! 
 Shit... 
 Heart poundin, don't nobody give a fuck about you bitch 
 Some mornings I sit eatin' bacon eggs and grits 
 Like a bee without honey, a tycoon without money 
 A rainy day that ain't sunny. A Joke that ain't funny! 
 Cocain deals. They shoot to kill, real motherfuckers... 
 Crack raider cluckers tommy tucker cluckers 
 Chewy smoker conisourres who wear beanies in da heat 
 I'll mannerd motherfuckers with da buck in da beat 
 Lips numb, ready to shoot a dick full of cum 
 Sticky but yet picky, chewin spearmint gum. Shit, mother 
 Stingy as a motherfucker don't ask me for shit 
 And even when I'm broke bitch my mindstate is rich 
 Because no doubt, no doubt I'm gonna have gear 
 Spin the same lane in a different motherfucking viggeree?
