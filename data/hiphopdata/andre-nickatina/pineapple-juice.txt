Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice 
 Made that little bad bitch get loose 
 And oh yeah 
 It's a Fillmore drink 
 Bitch whatcha think? 
 I'm about sheer Khan and big bank 
 (2x) 
 Ya best holla back 
 The playboy with the cognac 
 You're right here 
 So who cares where your man is at? 
 If I was a singer 
 I'd prolly be El DeBarge 
 And just for you to hear my voice 
 Bitch I gotsta charge (yeah) 
 Mixed tape style 
 All in your face now 
 You're with me so you don't have to wait now 
 I triple beam scale priced my thoughts 
 I might buy something bitch 
 And don't check the cost (yeah) 
 In a plane flight 
 Ten after midnight 
 You gotta go to work bitch 
 Then Goodnight 
 'Cause there's playboys here 
 That don't play around here 
 And this is what we say around here 
 Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice 
 Made that little bad bitch get loose 
 And oh yeah 
 It's a Fillmore drink 
 Bitch whatcha think? 
 I'm about sheer Khan and big bank (2x) 
 I'm a loaded gun 
 I might bust if you try to run 
 'Cause y'all run right back to the ism 
 Prism 
 I turn around in my Makeveli hat 
 I'm something like a cat 
 I do it for the scratch 
 Ain't no games like 
 The Price Is Right 
 Bob Barker won't be seen tonight 
 Unless he does like the rest of em 
 By appointment you can undress the bum 
 You gotta 24 Karat chain around your waist 
 Don't get out of pocket 
 'Cause it's not your place 
 You make a dope fiend go from rock to base 
 And when you come back home 
 This is what you'll taste 
 Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice 
 Made that little bad bitch get loose 
 And oh yeah 
 It's a Fillmore drink 
 Bitch whatcha think? 
 I'm about sheer Khan and big bank 
 (2x) 
 Bitch by the way 
 You like to walk like a runway 
 And I bring out the Benz 
 All day on Sunday 
 Man it's something like gun play 
 Glock Tawk 
 And you try to walk your ass up a one way 
 And my mouthpiece tell you all about me 
 I like it when a broke bitch try to doubt me 
 My manicured nails 
 They like to touch mail 
 My clientele like to rent out hotels 
 No decoys here 
 Just playboys 
 And we ride around in cars that we call toys 
 Supa bad dime 
 Get a lemon lime 
 Get my drink and don't stand in line 
 Man that Hennessey and pineapple juice 
 Made that little bad bitch get loose 
 And oh yeah 
 It's a Fillmore drink 
 Bitch whatcha think? 
 I'm about sheer Khan and big bank
