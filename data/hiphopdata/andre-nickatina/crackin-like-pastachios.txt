Here is my credentials 
 Its something so essentials 
 Get the pad I'll get the pencil 
 Doing donuts like its wenchels 
 Ima kamakazee thinker ima threat 
 I roll around the block and hit up homies from the set 
 Cutting nice like its liqour 'cause I'm quicker out the box 
 I sport the stance 
 Make the 'didas with the 3 qaurter sox 
 Tiga rock non stop 
 In the car with the fast the flow 
 Telling these freaks that I'm cracking like pastachio's yo 
 The situations chemistry its hitting like the hennesy 
 Ripping through the soul of the gods in pennententary's 
 Roll a dice get the craps 
 Homie where your mind at 
 Gotta make the money so the law never find that 
 Ima make the money out the flow 
 I'm cracking like pastachio's yo 
 Maybe you didn't know 
 I'm switching 4 lanes and yo maybe it ain't no thang 
 And holla at you boy if you see me in da game 
 Its strange 
 Throwing like I'm ganon 
 With a canon for an arm 
 And yo I'm turning up the charm 
 When I see her at the bar 
 I'm like a cotton candy devil 
 Yo meanin' that I'm trebble 
 I look over the offense 
 Trying to make the playas fumble 
 Man I'm on my way to hell and a lil continental 
 And even though its mines god I'll treat it like a rental 
 In this simple yo the rearrange 
 Smack you like I'm plumber Lane 
 Fool I think your hiding thangs 
 Gold chains and diamond rangs 
 Cut the pie then divide 
 Smoking weed the supper fly 
 Do or die true or lie 
 Dirty money multiply 
 Look at me look at me greed I'm greedy 
 Telling all my homies yo god you don't want to be me 
 Wat you saw I broke the law 
 Blazing in a new car 
 Jazzy as I wanna be 
 Like I'm up in Utah 
 Twinkle twinkle little star money in the cookie jar 
 Rookies on a rookie car betting with the bookie hard
