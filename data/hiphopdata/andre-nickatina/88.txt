Since 88' been slingin tapes like cakes 
 Consult with the real and stay away from the fakes 
 Told my nigga Mike-Mike, there's money to make 
 And hes been down here since 88' 
 Fakes and snakes infiltratin skeem 
 Crack is queen and Tiger, money is king 
 Man... My nigga spanky got a hell of a beam 
 Since 88' hes been a dream to fiends 
 From state to state I gotta sling these tapes 
 CDs to make so women masterbate 
 Educated niggas with ghetto fame 
 Famous for splittin up niggas brains 
 You reap what you sew when it comes to the game 
 Swift to the fifth and now you have no name 
 Since 88' dope is escalate 
 Niggas out-run cops that's over-weight 
 The 1st and 15th are sacred days 
 Money and hoes flipped are different ways 
 Weed is smoked at an alarmin rate 
 Prepare for an attitude at the start of the gate 
 Man... My minds on the money and my brain can't escape 
 So just like cakes man, I'm a sling these tapes 
 Since 88' man, there's been a race 
 Ears, they open wide when game is laced 
 Man... This sexy hoe, she got a hell of a face 
 So I'm a use her to fly tapes across the state 
 Prices dropped and they rise like yeast 
 No shows'll have a nigga mad for weeks 
 Man... My girl just quit me and I loved that freak 
 So frustration fucks is what I have in the sheets 
 Crime and murder has escalate 
 Fun and love has just turned to hate 
 Gin is in and niggas drink it raw 
 Watch for the task cause niggas break the law 
 Don't look for trust because it don't exist 
 You talk too much to that nasty bitch 
 Man... She told your plan to a hell of a dick 
 He told his click, now for a minute they rich 
 Since 88' I been slingin tapes 
 Like keys from Cuba or the Miami state 
 Triple beam it up and see how much I'm a make 
 It's been this way man since 88' 
 Motherfuckas drive cars that alert the law 
 Finest things that you've ever saw 
 Make a bitch suck dick and come up outta that bra 
 Found out she was cheatin', damn near broke her jaw 
 Masterminds... They got skeems for cream 
 Tryin' to live that American Dream 
 Most niggas die over bitches and greed 
 Fuck the rest of this song I'm bout to smoke my weed
