I used to laugh when T seen dopefiends get beat 
 Bleedin' all out they head in the middle of the streets 
 They say pitbull fights would go on at the park 
 And like vampires niggaz come out after dark 
 You know freaks sell dope for material shit 
 And on the side gold-diggin on a ballers dick 
 Yeah, O.G. niggaz turned in to alcoholics 
 What you think about it Boo Boo? (nigga I can't call it) 
 Man little kids run around with a nose full of boogers 
 While the niggaz on the block sell that rocked up sugar 
 Touchin' they gats every time a fool pass 
 Waitin' to put slugs up in a niggaz ass 
 They say fuck school, they say fuck grades 
 They rather get paid and snort cocaine 
 On the Ave. 
 On the A-V-E 
 It's about money and D 
 Man fuck around too long and be a casualty 
 Man in the A-V-E it's about rocks and glocks 
 Don't get too close because you might get shot 
 Motherfuckers I used to go to school with 
 They look at me like man I don't give a shit 
 Man they don't even say what's up top a young loc 
 They put they hands on they guns inside they coats 
 But I'm thinkin' to myself man I ain't fearin' ya 
 I 'member back when we ate in the cafateria 
 Nigga, but them days are rested 
 I get a mary jane sack like that and keep steppin' 
 To the sto' for some zig-zags 
 Man every sto' that I know yo is owned by some Arabs 
 But I got money in my Cutty so I'm drivin' 
 Sixty-nine drop top motherfucker 
 You motherfucken bitches they ain't shit to me 
 Man you should see these freaks on the A-V-E 
 Yo, shakin' they ass man tryin' to get a grip 
 But bitch this ain't no motherfucken freak nick 
 Ho, so what nigga you got a fancy car 
 You be shootin' niggaz over that nasty broad 
 Somewhere inside you you think that's hard 
 But when you die nigga what you gon' say to god 
 They get to spittin' them ninas, nine millimeters, bust ballerinas 
 Over things from Colombia and Argentina 
 My tiga Rome got a rock face 
 That means he's facin three years for a motherfucken glock case 
 You might think you went out of space 
 'Cause motherfucker this is something that you can't escape 
 On the Ave.
