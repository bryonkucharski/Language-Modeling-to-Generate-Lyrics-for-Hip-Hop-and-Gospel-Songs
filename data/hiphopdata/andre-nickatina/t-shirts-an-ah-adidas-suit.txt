Make way for the nitty, gritty, bitty titty filler 
 City after city time and crime rap dealer 
 I don't play football, I'm not a playmaker 
 My only way deep is to throw a haymaker 
 School rule breaker 
 Makin' teachers have a fit 
 From the Goz show that's how I learn to spit 
 Man, some All Star Chuck's and some coke to sack 
 It don't matter what color as long it blue or black 
 'Cause I'm reckless 
 Cuban necklace 
 Never in the game that become wet fish 
 Two t-shirts an ah adidas suit 
 Man, I ain't peepin' what what ya speakin' 
 Homie gimme the loot 
 Man, you filled wit' truth 
 And I'm filled with lies 
 When we rap all these muthf**kas' die despise 
 Like the sparrow that narrow 
 Nigga shootin' through an arrow 
 You can see the klugg's if you look through the barrel 
 Fools use chess like a VCR 
 Worth as much as a CD-R 
 Gotta put my hands in the cookie jar 
 You got beef? 
 Let my rap den rip ya car 
 Disappear like a motherfuckin' desert mirage 
 Smellin' so good like a red crosage 
 That's the way I fuck em' down 
 Climbs around by sound 
 Like how them whistles whip through the ground 
 Get the camera, the ramela, the scramela 
 Two points the fuck with the camela, SIN 
 Who cares what mood ya in? 
 It'll sound like thunda if I lose again 
 Yeah nickatina I dun told ya the virgin of fame 
 I'm like napoleon you beat like he come in the game 
 Check's is ready to name 
 Then I pop the brain 
 Ain't a law in the world that can stop the case 
 I wear Adidas 
 Sometimes Fillas 
 They're the two leadas' 
 The boy king 
 Hit yo bowl, sack, low jeans 
 At 3am 
 Yeah the freeway mine 
 And you can tell by the ticket's I've left behind 
 You wanna get reckless? 
 Don't get checklist 
 Cops motherfucker they respect this 
 What's on the wishlist? 
 Man, I can get this 
 I freak with big lips 
 And she love the tongue kiss 
 And cold as a tundre 
 Seven's the numba 
 Split up the pie 
 Or chop it like lumba 
 Don't forget the thunda that I said 
 And all praises to Bob Marley's mighty dreads 
 We need to find someone to hunt down 
 Think of the turn around 
 The murder is murder round 
 Tryin' to burn em' down 
 Reckless 
 I all blessed it 
 I hit the stage freak with such freshness 
 Two t-shirts and ah adidas suit 
 I'm lookin' way too cute 
 You bitches raise the roof 
 You got bacardi in ya' body 
 180 proof 
 And I'm addicted to ya ass 
 Like ya' name was truth 
 I jump in the coop 
 With a couple of bloods 
 And bitch fuck ya party if the shit don't bump 
 Because I'm major fast 
 I need major cash 
 And damn your sister got major ass 
 Homie reckless 
 They won't respect this 
 I say the bitch is kinda like a necklace 
 Two t-shirts and ah adidas suit 
 I'm lookin' way too cute 
 You bitches raise the roof
