"Never get married" 
 (*Coughing*) 
 I never met a girl like you before 
 As I closed the Cadillac door, I said, "Hi" 
 She said, "Hello, you're a handsome fellow" 
 I said, "You're a pretty brown yellow" 
 She start to laugh, she said, "I'm tryin' to catch a cab 
 It's crowded Downtown and I got way too many bags" 
 Her perfume had the whole block bumpin 
 Lady can I call you or somethin' 
 Your fine no frontin, she said she was menden a broken heart 
 Her last man had it, he ripped it apart 
 She had a mind like a scientist 
 Braken down the gods, the moon, the earth, the suns and guns 
 She said, "Call me tonight it's cool 
 I just have to work a little bit, no school", man holla back 
 I watched her walk to the cab 
 She rolled down the window blew a kiss then laughed 
 I gave a wave, thinkin' I won't see her for days 
 Three hours later yo, my celly phone rangs 
 Yo what you doin'? Man what you doin' God I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
 Girl I'm thinkin' 'bout you, now what we gon do? 
 She said she's always busy, she's rarely home 
 And, the last few days she's been so alone 
 I said, "Yo, we in the same boat 
 If we were singers on stage we be probably hittin the same note" 
 She had a voice like an angel 
 Man with a touch of some game that"ll make some cats never say no 
 I said, "We should sit and eat 
 Because I really ain't no telephone sex geek", man I hit the streets 
 (*Talking*) 
 Then I found out she was a stripper and 
 My mind just wouldn't ler me call her back, Khan
