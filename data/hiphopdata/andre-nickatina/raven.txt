You know god, the devil is acting a mother fucking fool 
 Well yes, watch out for those buster 
 Busters and you never can trust them 
 Sooner or later gotta me a hafta dump them in the ocean 
 And them them girls around them we gonna get rid of them, second 
 Watch that four blown, gage on time (tragic, tragic, tragic, tragic) 
 And you know that cinnnomon bread that you didn't want to give me? 
 So when me get down, me bring my rotwilder round 
 And make them shake that thang 
 The raven in my eyes got me going against the grain 
 If you purple like the rain 
 Feel me nigga now check the grip, Get rich quick or die 
 Some can't get rich so god damn quick, so they suffer and get high 
 God fearin niggas, who sin and make they ends 
 Corner store ballas who can't think without they gin 
 Mandadory consequence if you spit this busnuiss splittin rocks 
 Bullets connect with red dots, shit this ghetto red hot 
 A vision like twelve monkeys, split the blunt and fill her up 
 We ready to cuss and dump on niggas who wanna buss 
 Spittin' 45 and newer nines mindstate on barrcudda 
 Nigga watch the heat 'cause the heat will seek and the heat will go right through ya 
 My mouth a make an attitude and hall game 
 Street chemist ghetto star dealin' with the pain 
 They say "Andre Nickatina keep it comin" 
 The game done got so thick that I can't even have a woman 
 Let me look into your eyes, witness all the lies, 
 Somewhere down the line you made a grown man cry, why? 
 Raven in my eyes put a man to test 
 Man not bullet proof, man be made of flesh 
 You know me keep on singing 
 The raven in my eyes put a man to test 
 And I say 
 Man not bullet proof, man be made of flesh 
 You know me keep on sayin' 
 A raven in my life put a man to test 
 And you know me sayin' 
 Man not bullet proof, man be made of flesh 
 B. Adams do ya still love me? 
 'Cause your first born is struggeling (tragic tragic tragic) 
 And its hard to stay drug free, mama do you love me?
