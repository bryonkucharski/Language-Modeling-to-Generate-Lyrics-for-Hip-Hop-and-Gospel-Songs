I'm Pina Colada dropped Impala 
 Rubber band the big dollas 
 Runnin' things they will remain 
 Rollin' up the weed mayne 
 Jumpin' outta a Lexus Coupe 
 M R G a kinda suit 
 Excellently tailored up 
 And don't forget the flavor, 
 What? 
 I'm super salty 
 Pretty Tony at the barber shop 
 Braggin how I'm blowin' cop 
 Listenin to Royal Rock 
 Paper chasin 
 Paper runnin' 
 Paper gunnin 
 Paper getting 
 Paper havin' 
 Paper catchin 
 Don't forget that paper grab it 
 I got it goin' on 
 Tell all them suckas go on home 
 Back up in the Lexus Coupe 
 Color man is two tone 
 Bangin' out the Nakamichi 
 Get the yayo it's on to chi-chi 
 Now we gotta deal with Frank a pig that don't fly straight 
 I'm hot boilin water 
 Cookin crack up at the Carter 
 Man you think your freak is bad 
 Man my freak is way harder 
 I'm Popeye's certified a two piece meal and some small fries 
 Man my hair is super laced I don't know about them bald guys 
 They call me Ayatollah all up in your Motorola 
 Whether it's a ring tone or a picture in your phone-a 
 A lime in your Corona 
 A glock on your corna 
 I fire up in every club because I know the owner 
 Dive just like a Navy Seal 
 My homie got a burgundy Coup De Ville 
 Girls be love takin' Skittles 
 But we know that's poppin' pills 
 I like to put it down like? 
 Man boxin bettin on every round 
 Man at the fight we be talkin' loud 
 I've been at this since Jaws was a goldfish 
 I'm a go like everywhere 
 Except maybe the electric chair 
 Man you can smell my hair 
 I'm fresh up out the shop 
 I'm back in the Lex Coupe bumpin Royal Rock 
 I'm like a new glock 
 Man or a hoop shot 
 So you can tell from the beginning that I'm trying to get you popped 
 I like fo tres I do it four ways 
 You might see me straight cursin out a meter maid 
 Lookin' like the Lion King 
 Specially when I'm buying things 
 Eatin on some onion rings 
 Talkin' shit in Burger King 
 I like to side talk all up on the sidewalk 
 All up in the shoe store and everything is getting bought 
 I roll in greenery overlookin scenery 
 She ask me what I'm thinking about 
 And, yo, I said "My jewelry" 
 She said "that's cool to me" 
 I read her like a eulogy 
 She said my party's hella crackin' 
 I said "that's how it's supposed to be" 
 I'm a Jaguar in a foreign car 
 Knockin' on the Pearly gates 
 Hittin on the marijuana 
 Money all Americana 
 I do it Das Boot watching tapes of Ronnie Moot? 
 Back up in the Lexus Coupe 
 Floatin like a parachute 
 It's my philosophy man of the entity 
 It's like I'm Kenny Parker runnin' round with B. D. P. 
 Yo homie it's after eight 
 We goin' down to the Lions Gate 
 That's the restaurant with the free Henn when you buy a steak 
 I'm like an earthquake 
 Shakin up the foundation 
 Figured out the combination 
 To your iphone application 
 I got the recipe the menu is the rest of me 
 My car does match my Jordan's and some say that was fresh of me 
 I'm like The Loch Ness sittin' up in a dropped 'Vette 
 Hangin' like a chain that you might see up on 'Pacs neck 
 I'm like the last poem 
 Tell them suckas go on home 
 How much yo is that cologne 
 I got it goin' on 
 I'm like a new glock holdin' down an old block 
 And even though it's crack rock they protect it like it's Fort Knox 
 We eattin pork chops with a real Muslim aura 
 We hit Hawaii like it's Pearl Harbor 
 Tora! Tora! 
 I might say neyamora 
 Or homie what's the score-a 
 And you can ask for what you want but I got nothing for ya
