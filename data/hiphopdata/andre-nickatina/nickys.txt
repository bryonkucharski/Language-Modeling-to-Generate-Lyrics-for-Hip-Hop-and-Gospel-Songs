Bitches take your clothes off 
 Homie let the money talk 
 I don't really care if you a baller or a big boss

 Man this is the place to be 
 Man iced up to pay a fee 
 How many girls up on the floor? 
 I'd say about like twenty three 
 They like to shake it 
 They tell you "Homie drank it up" 
 And all the white girls like the brown girls with big butts 
 The Hennessy is fillin' 
 Man it's such a gangsta feelin' 
 Look at all the bitches as they walk around it's so appealin' 
 You know your supa chillin' when your money hits the ceilin' 
 This is what you really think about

 (Yeah) 
 You wanna talk with her 
 Man then grab a drink and walk with her 
 And hit the champagne room and buy a bottle and get lost with her 
 Even my waitresses are super bad with super ass 
 Bringin' y'all the bottle 
 Askin her to join and she ain't mad 
 They like to click they heels 
 And focus on the dollar bills 
 The more they see the money is the more you see a better thrill 
 If you keep you keep it crackin' where the money keeps on stackin 
 I'm a tell you playboy 
 It's automatic

 She really wanna do it 
 Man she really wanna make it 
 Man she really wanna grab it 
 Man she really take it 
 She like to do it naked even if the club is packed 
 Man as long as all the money is all there and it's super stacked 
 You know the stage is lit with money man all over it 
 With six or seven girls that can dance and they super thick 
 They straight doin' it 
 Nothin' here can ruin it 
 This is real talk 
 Where them dollas at?
