Yeah 
 It's frisco's finest 
 And see it as a privilege when quipto rhymin 
 If ya (look in my eyes) you can see that they slanted 
 My sly samarai chopp you down with a hatchet 
 You can (look at me) and see Q in the flesh 
 Just boss like rammy moss boy and move to the west 
 You can (look in my eyes) andyou can tell where they rest 
 We blessed, the best weed goin' straight to your chest 
 C'mon (look at me) as a real MC, just know that I'm explosive like tnt 
 Cause you can (look in my eyes) and they like red as the sea 
 But still I stay two steps ahead of your freaks 
 Just (look at me) I'm still standing here living proof 
 A fucken interview,
