I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House 
 And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down 
 I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House 
 And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down 
 From the depths and the rep from a 24/7 rap cat matchin' flow is cashin' 
 The way you click your heels you like to do it with a passion 
 Don't worry about the paper 
 I can manage you precisely 
 My heart might be cold but the ism kinda icy 
 You got it goin' on now do I have to shake something? 
 She with her home girl so I don't' have to say nothin' 
 I campaign everything 
 Yeah I like to floss 
 I never shop at Ross and yo I never check the cost 
 She comin' through the door man I think chosen up 
 In all the City blazed you might see me cruisin' up 
 Man I don't say nothing, man my car do all the talkin' 
 And all it really says is, 
 "Bitch, you shouldn't be walkin', would you hop in?" 
 I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House 
 And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down 
 I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House 
 And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down 
 From the depth and the rep from a 24/7 rap cat known to match that 
 Brand new Benz yo I had to cop that 
 Straight up game and I'm known to drop that 
 A lot of money man and I'm known to count that 
 Whatcha really wanna know about that? 
 Being outta pocket is not about that 
 Six foot money maker I'm glad I found that 
 A Choosey Susie and I'm glad I clowned that 
 Man I really like to maximize 
 And somebody flies to collect the prize 
 And always looking for the best to buy 
 And clients old as Bob Barker 
 Nerdy like Peter Parker 
 Supa dupa bad when the money unfold 
 I let that bitch buy my clothes, my wife beaters my cologne 
 No new trick can take you home 
 I don't care if it's Al Capone 
 Flip the chips and flip the tricks 
 Then call another on the phone 
 Break it down like Indica 
 Man they all gonna wanna be a friend of ya 
 But makin' sure that they spending ya 
 Don't be telling people man that's kin to ya, shit 
 And do it man like a Kobe shot 
 Man it's my team winnin' you like it or not 
 You can parlay at all the new hot spots 
 With all the Bentleys, Beamers and them drop tops 
 We like the newest clothes and keep an eye out for the newest hos 
 My favorites color green and gold 
 Bitch you gotta money pose 
 I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House 
 And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down 
 I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around" 
 'Cause if you mess around 
 Bitch I'm a dip you through the town 
 About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
