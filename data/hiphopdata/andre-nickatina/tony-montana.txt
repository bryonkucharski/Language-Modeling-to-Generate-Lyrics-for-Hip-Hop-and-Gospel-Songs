This girl said I act like Tony Montana 
 When it comes to her I just can't forget the camera 
 Thick bitch but I really can't stand her 
 Somebody put on the new Jacka 
 Prime time 
 It all started with a fine dime 
 She make it warm in the winter time 
 But my heart is so cold from the wrath of the city streets 
 We might meet but we don't speak 
 Man I'm a 24/7 rap cat 
 Hair stay permed in a baseball cap 
 I slither through the town like a cobra snake man 
 The money she make be the money I take 
 I hit the bay bridge 
 NASCAR style 
 I drive so fast 
 Weed in my head 
 Foot on the gas 
 I look her in the eyes 
 But she already lookin' at me 
 She say Nicky-T I wanna be 
 Let's go 
 It's like I just won the Lotto 
 From tennis shoes to high heels is my motto 
 I got her a iPhone not a Metro 
 And once again we on the road baby let's go 
 Picture every image at the line of scrimmage 
 And all the clothes and the money that might diminish 
 And while the wheels just spin on the luxury car 
 The ho be sippin that workin at the luxury bar 
 Prime time 
 It all starts with a fine dime 
 And even on a bad day yo she still shine 
 Man it's amazing how she keep her waistline 
 The type of body that make a car run a stop sign 
 I float like a butterfly 
 I spit a fly lullaby 
 Wear fly shades when I'm high 
 You can hit me when the money is froze 
 About time you touch down it should still be cold 
 The world is mines 
 And that ain't no lie 
 Damn girl, you really like a dime 
 Your little red corvette that you be dippin solo 
 I'm your best friend and your Manolo 
 I ride through Coconut Grove 
 Lookin' for you 
 Where could you be 
 Are you hidin from me 
 I'm a junkie about the ends 
 And it's a cold dark night and I'm dippin the benz 
 With a blunt close to the window 
 Where did you go 
 All in the back of my mind I know 
 All the bread that she made for me 
 Man it's not gonna be there it's plain to see man
