Lay that body down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 Wouldn't go round and round 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I really like the way you get down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 We could play it safe and sound 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I'm stuck up in the club 
 Lookin' hella shy 
 Seen as ten ta morsel 
 And the chronic 
 Goin' rub dub dub 
 Ooh 
 Gonna take that step 
 The bar's to the left 
 Tonight and I'm not standin 
 Can I have a handle 
 Sayin' 
 Bartender 
 Straight to this time 
 And he caught my eye 
 Lookin' hella fly 
 And the motherfucker knew 
 That'd we'd be meetin at a later time 
 Slip me them digits 
 You know I'm straight up down with it 
 I'm into pimpin', hustles, caddies, daddies 
 Roll with it 
 Let's roll 
 Or is it cool 
 To hook up witchu late 
 Now creepin' 
 Sneakin on the under 
 That's what I'm always creepin' 
 You don't like the apparatus 
 And the stravis it take 
 You got that kitty cat clearance 
 So come get the cakes 
 I don't see nothin' wrong 
 With a little bump and grind 
 So drop low on the line 
 Any fuckin' time 
 Don't havin' time to rewind lately 
 Freakin you like... Brothers 
 Barnom and Baily 
 Lay that body down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 Wouldn't go round and round 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I really like the way you get down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 We could play it safe and sound 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I don't mind gettin' caught up 
 With yo big black dick trap 
 Cause niggas that I fuck with 
 Get flipped like flap jacks 
 I ain't no floosy flippin 
 No condom havin' hookin dickin nigga 
 But I'll control your tootsie roll 
 So when you knock up at 
 The round front door 
 You better come on in 
 Cause the shit don't go 
 Drop the gold and hit the heena 
 To the room on right behind ya 
 Slap you on your ass 
 Your shit looks luscious from this angle 
 Lickin' on your body 
 Foreplay 
 I Lay 
 Spread my fuckin' legs Spread 
 We can do this all day 
 Rockin' motherfuckers with these big black cheeks 
 Climb up on my titties like they mountain peaks 
 Penetration 
 Sensation 
 Doin' the motherfucker my erection is in this direction 
 I'm kickin it down 
 Hella smooth 
 Up in the fuckin' room 
 And I must see ya real soon 
 Lay that body down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 Wouldn't go round and round 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I really like the way you get down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 We could play it safe and sound 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 Lay that body down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 Wouldn't go round and round 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 I really like the way you get down 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me 
 We could play it safe and sound 
 Let me see that pussy 
 Don't push me
