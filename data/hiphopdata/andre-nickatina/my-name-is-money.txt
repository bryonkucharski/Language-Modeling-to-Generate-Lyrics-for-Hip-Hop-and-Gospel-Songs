What's crackin' everybody you probly know me my name is Money 
 And when it comes to me 
 Like all y'all want something from me 
 I got the pimps, the pushers, players, all the junkies screamin 
 'Cause if they have no Money baby then they start to feenin' 
 I'm at the gamble shack 
 Sometimes they put me in the back 
 Sometimes the D boys put me where all the guns and all they dope is at 
 I'm in your pockets, wallets, purses all your hideaways 
 I'm probly the root of everybody's very violent ways 
 (Let me hold you) 
 (Let me hold you) 
 Yo, ask Obama he say straight up, 
 "Yo, I know that Money. 
 He's in my pocket and I dare you try to take him from me" 
 I know the Mafia 
 They love me and they treat me well 
 Man, they be askin for me even when they go to jail 
 I'm in the drug game so I know about them drug sales 
 And I be all on Wall Street so I know like when your stock fails 
 Some call me "Cash Flow" and I dig it like a bad ho 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you 
 This is what they say 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Every single day 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 In a religious type of way 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Let me touch you, let me hold ya, something 
 I'm at the crap table and some might say a dice game 
 And when it comes to me people will like argue kill and fight mane 
 They call me Ben Franklin, Benjamin and Young Benji 
 They call me Blood Money yo when the gangsters come and get me 
 They like to bury me and carry me in armored trucks 
 And just the other day man some kid said 
 "I'm strictly guaped up" 
 And all the politicians like to give me to they mistress 
 And all the broke bitches mention me in all they wishes 
 (Let me hold you) 
 (Let me hold you) 
 They make me rain at strip clubs like the weathers bad 
 And some might ask for more of me if your credits bad 
 Some spend me real fast man, like they know I won't last 
 And some like to put me away in big old Hefty garbage bags 
 Some call me Cheddar Cheese and they'll die for me you best believe 
 And they don't want me from Mickey D's 
 They wanna get me out this freak 
 I'm nothing cheap you need to hear it and believe that 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 This is what they say 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Every single day 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 In a religious type of way 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Let me touch you, let me hold ya, something 
 When people have me they tell other people that they ballin' 
 And all the strippers tell they boyfriends 
 "Hey yo, Money's callin! " 
 I'm all in Vegas I'm the number one priority 
 And I know every president so don't make me show authority 
 I know the coc dealers familiar with life pushing keys 
 And one name was Montana and he stacked up a lot of me 
 I'm all in bank vaults if I'm lost it's they fault 
 And I like all the pretty women that like to tell men what they cost 
 (Let me hold you) 
 (Let me hold you) 
 Some like to steal me, yo and lie to people that they did it 
 And even on they death bed they just won't admit it 
 You can't take me with you 
 Here's the issue 
 I'll forget you 
 And depending on how much you had of me that is why people miss you 
 They call Money mane you can mix me up with that honey mane 
 And anyone can be a boss but bosses know I'm running things 
 That's why all bums be thinking that I'm spare change 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 This is what they say 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Every single day 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 In a religious type of way 
 (Let me hold you. Let me hold you) 
 Let me touch you, let me hold ya, something
