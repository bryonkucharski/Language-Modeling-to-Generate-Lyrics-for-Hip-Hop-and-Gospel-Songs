As I'm gone bitten knittin, it's too much space 
 I'm bustin' out the seams in your motherfuckin place 
 Got to dwell, oh well, My DT crew gets wrecked 
 I live my last days as if my last breath 
 All you player hatin' mother fuckers challenge our balance 
 Tricks try to get with Lo-Lo regs and scallion 
 Now can dre my dog make up the DT bitch 
 So whatcha watch 'cause we gettin' rich 
 Can I kick it with my lo-dog 
 Fill my heart you got the blunt I got the boones 
 For alls yalls so let me break it down like this 
 And if you ain't my folks don't ask me for shit 
 Biyotch! 
 I runs my flows like carl lewis, you blew it 
 Tried to step to the scene as though you knew it 
 And now 
 I'm zippin through the air waves 
 My gift of gab was given to me in my younger days 
 A bye bye to my alarmin 
 And could you refrain from please squeezin the charmin 
 Nigga, cause you got none and you get stunned 
 When I bluckha-bluckha to your motherfuckin dome 
 Then my crew played the glock glock glock 
 So let me bust this shit without the hassle, non stop 
 Smokin' fools like a mother fuckin' blunt dre gave me 
 And all you niggas talkin' bout save me 
 Chumpin 
 Say a ho oh no 
 You fuckin' wit that DT L-O L-O 
 You should know that Lo-Lo when I'm felon 
 I'm wellin in my heart I'd obey with my nigga dre 
 Biyotch 
 Is that how you're comin', well um 
 This is your boy dre 
 You boy comin' like this 
 Nigga you worser than being a gay son 
 I'm a pimp you better roll a 20 sack and don't think you can skimp 
 So if you got a glass jaw yous a caterpillar 
 So I'm a kick fucks like d treating niggas motherfucka 
 You dirty like the New York subway 
 T-run you little cunt you be good as me one day Not 
 I respect you like a racist white cop 
 So check the plastic glock that's dropped in my sock 
 Cause feelin' like the soul train 
 You knock me off the track 
 Terminator couldn't sing it better I'll be back 
 Fuck that 
 I don't forget and will not forgive 
 And don't give a fuck if you die your alive 
 As I laugh and stretch your neck like an African giraffe 
 Like a do-do a sexy ho, I'm all up in your ass 
 Then its actual I'm always in jeans lookin' casual 
 Fuck being nationwide fool I'm international 
 Like anywhere I fits in and niggas I been blessed 
 'Cause where I gets in I fits like a sun dress 
 On a 21 year old butterscotch if I have to freaknic 
 Da pussy'll have to fluff 'em up wantin me to freak this 
 Table, this hippo, Lo-Lo get the boones 
 And we're going to fuck every pussy hole in the room 
 They ain't my folks 
 Creamin in their motherfuckin face 
 I'm on the under well just have NIO 
 But I like west grand 
 An indo joint burns in my hand 
 You should have left before I thought, you had your chance 
 You think the shit got squashed cause the shit got old 
 Now your from the state necked knocked out cold 
 Motherfucka 
 Ain't my folks, ain't my folks either 
 Nigga you need to stop bringin' all those blunts in front of squeeze sometimes 
 Motherfucka
