 Scottie, scottie 
 (Andre nickatina) 
 Put the phone on ya but it's the booty call 
 And I'm comin' ta bust nuts on all y'all 
 And I'm out 
 Half a blunt hangin' out my mouth 
 Speedin' like a demon on 101 south 
 I smoke chewy like a muthafuckin' nut 
 Ya got a gram bag get the zags an' roll 'er up 
 It's Andre Nickatina tiger comin' out the cuts 
 Maximum speed drivin' I don't give a fuck 
 Garcia blunt fully hunt down the cat 
 These bitches on the street muthafucka were you at 
 Dippin' on swayze wit my niggas from tha set 
 The blunt went out but we ain't done yet 
 Get another one blaze 
 Bitch get paid 
 A welfare that check every 15 days 
 I remember highschool lowfuel and bushy 
 Cuttin' that muthafucka go gettin' pussy 
 Caught up in the madness 
 This freak was the baddest 
 I seen her baggy jeans and her ass was the fattest 
 Ooh it's jenine 
 She licked my dick clean 
 Come right away she got a twomp sac of weed 
 Nigga I'm sippin 
 My potna's got the tay' stay sippin' 
 Talkin' about money, hoes, hustlin' and pimpin' 
 I'm over 
 Doja like this fine bitch 
 Shinin' like a car or my news stands smith 
 Cut the fade 
 Hoes get wet from the wave 
 Dancin' in a cage with ass for days 
 It's like this 
 I didn't know you smoke chewy bitch 
 Now bring the yale too so we can fire up a spliff 
 About six 
 My pager's talkin' to me sayin' "shit 
 The battery's low in this son of a bitch" 
 Yeah 15's pound like this 
 15's screamin' out bitch 
 15's bumpin' gangsta shit 
 Mind on a muthafuckin' grip 
 (Shaggie) 
 A nigga graped his coat when I heard them 15"s 
 With a new 9 in the waistline of them jeans when I them 15"s 
 Heard them 15's 
 Grab my weed to get keyed when I heard them 15's 
 Fresh out the house about to pop my p's 
 My niggas done swoop me up about twelve fifteen 
 What's the first thing to do but find that weed 
 In that sedan de ville cadilac wit' the gangsta lean 
 I gots to pop me a not 
 Soon as we hit the spot 
 So I can hit the ho twice and see how much cash she got 
 Me and 'dre will hop out 
 When we hit the parking lot 
 And get to flossin' on them fools like I pooled up at the postop 
 Jumped out the car and we was feelin' like g's 
 I was broke that day but lookin' like I slang keys 
 But these hoes will neva know 
 'Cause them ones will have you fat 
 When you off in one of them clubs and dressing all in black 
 And it was cool I had juice to get in with a strap 
 In case I see one of them niggas from back in the days I done jact 
 In fact 
 My nigga shot done served that nigga a sac 
 And told me that he had 3 mo' niggas posted out back 
 Bring this on 
 'Cause right by the back door is my cuzin tone 
 And mr. blunt 
 Ready to give some nike reading lessons to a chump 
 We make them bleed 
 Then leave the seen 
 Wit them a.r. 15's 
 A.r. 15's 
 (Andre nickatina) 
 Man I don't drink cappacino 
 I'm a picses not a leo 
 Can't even strike to reno unless I tell my fuckin' p.o. 
 Drinkin' pina colata brooms staring hard at the moon 
 On the eightteenth floor hopin' I can find my room 
 Five star 
 Adictive like liquor at the bar 
 I sell tapes nigga bring it on cash or master charge 
 I gets lower than a den when I'm strikin" on a mission 
 Lookin' for competition 
 Or maybe a couple bitches 
 My style is something deadly like a newport cigarette 
 I'm a street chemist bitch 
 A money hungry pit 
 Like daffey duck I gives a fuck 
 It's mines it's all mines 
 Catch a flight in hienz 
 'Cause I'll leave that ass behind 
 Come stick with me 
 I'll bumble like a bee 
 'Cause my boo 
 We was cool 
 Back in nine two 
 But check it 
 I hit the party and these niggas holdin' weed 
 And I hold it in at my heart and don't wanna leave 
 Yeah what I think not 
 Ya know we hate cops 
 Imagine if nigga bought 
 Every donut shop 
 In the city 
 Fuck it in the muthafuckin' world 
 Greesy like a curl 
 Priceless like a pearl 
 Strikin' like a lighter 
 Bitin' like a biter 
 Bitch did you recognize my whitewall tires? 
 (Shaggy) 
 Yeah man I recognize your whitewall tires, but we got to get this over with 
 You understand me. I'm makein' moves I can't be standing around it might have 
 Been a good day for you, but I'm a tell you it'll never be right. 
 I stepped outside and I was tweaking 
 So tipsy mentally geekin' 
 I seen my nephew he had just got plug 
 He gave me credit he hooked me up with a proper dubb 
 Here come my girl I hope she got a pipe 
 It might have been a good day for you, but for me it'll never be right 
 I must have been geekin' and I stole my mama's TV 
 Now my little brother and my nephew wanna see me 
 But I ain't lookin' for them, I lookin' for a triple beam 
 And I'll be back later on 'cause I heard you niggas got ice cream 
 Something fat never that soda 
 Fuckin' wit the mexicans y'all be havin' that peruvian yola 
 Strait butt naked a dobe fiends dream 
 Nextellin' ain't no tellin' when I put it on a triple beam 
 I love that bitch if ya know what I mean 
 But I ain't talkin' bout that skanless, I'm talkin' bout that icecream
