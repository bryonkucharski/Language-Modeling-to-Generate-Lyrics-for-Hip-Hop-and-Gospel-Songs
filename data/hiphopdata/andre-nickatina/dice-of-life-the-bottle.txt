Yeah it's a picture; yeah it's a job 
 Maybe that's why I do it so odd 
 Walk around just like I was god 
 Kick it so live, when I'm with the gods 
 Freeway strikin', and weed we lightin 
 And If I die, remember the titan 
 With 22's, 25's, Chocolate 9's and 45's 
 Let 'em rip, all through the sky 
 This for the ones that hate that I'm high 
 When you see me, it's no surprise 
 Tap your brain, and blow your mind 
 Bettin on Lakers, and takers and fakers, and makers 
 And mami we do it for paper 
 You come with the vapors or capers 
 Or caper and vapors 
 Its cool, someone I'll call later 
 Me and my homies, love the bottle 
 Like Tyson loves 'Cause D'amato 
 So on them days you feelin' real bad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 Garlic tipped, and they love to hollow 
 Like Tyson loves 'Cause D'amato 
 So before you go to gettin' mad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 She like the Nikes, I like the 'didas 
 She like the Reeboks, and I like the Filas 
 She like the winners, and I like the cheaters 
 She like the lion, I like the hyenas 
 Spit some game, then hook up with Shaq 
 On the Playstation, I'm known to brag 
 Hook up with pimps that love the cash 
 Man you should see how we giggle and laugh 
 With of hearts of ice, the house is cold 
 It's like Slick Rick, without the gold 
 This right here is the life we chose 
 No excuses just go for gold 
 There's no producing, this perfect pose 
 Hit the street in the freshest clothes 
 Rip the stage, and bless the shows 
 Spit the flows, and hit the do' 
 Most of my homies, love the bottle 
 Like Tyson loves 'Cause D'amato 
 So on them days you feelin' real bad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 Garlic dipped, and they love to hollow 
 Like Tyson loves 'Cause D'amato 
 So before you go to gettin' mad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 Don't tell me twice, I'm out the door 
 Talk is not what I came here for 
 Into the night, like the star by the moon 
 The engine will rev, and the bass will go boom 
 Just like the pirate that sailed the seas 
 13 thieves I do believe 
 Yes of course they run with me 
 Flash our rings, on that there freak 
 Hot to handle, and hard to get 
 Easy to rip, and hard to fix 
 So rap your presence, I'll spit the gift 
 Man you my homie, we'll split the spliff 
 Ride like a maniac 
 All in the Cadillac 
 Tiga, whateva 
 I'm draped in leather 
 With angel wings, that rip the wind 
 And a safety grin of a p-210 
 'Cause all my homies love the bottle 
 Like Tyson loves 'Cause D'amato 
 So before you go to gettin' mad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 Guns they lust, and they love to hollow 
 So before you go to gettin' mad 
 Think of the best freak that you've ever had 
 ...Like Tyson loves 'Cause 
 (Talking) 
 This life of ours, this is a wonderful life 
 If you can get through life and get away with it, hey that's great 
 But it's very, unpredictable 
 There are so many ways you can screw it up
