(Long live the King) 
 Yo picture God a perfect cut diamond 
 Or bein the motha fucka man without even tryin' 
 Livin' like I'm dead to the world with tickets yo and refferals 
 My hair is in a perm so I can never have a curl 
 Man it's a bluebird on my shoulder can I kill it? 
 Man wakin' up the bacon toast and eggs up in the skillett 
 Man can you feel it? 
 I cut you down like a midget 
 And when you see me make you feel just like a prision visit 
 I'm such a (lizard?) 
 I want the flames in the fire 
 So there it is paint a picture fuck up my desire 
 You said you want style ill give you style with drug lord flava 
 I make a pimp dance yeah by shottin at his gatas 
 Pickin' up the nickles 'n' dimes like Jackal and Hide 
 The bounty is waitin for me up at Mt. Zine 
 Its primetime whos gon shine from the raw rhyme 
 Picture a rollercoaster up in a boss mind 
 Real playboys have wings in the sky 
 Silently cryin out man please don't die 
 Man gettin' to the thick of it all 
 Man picture the brods 
 Man tellin' ya call 
 But hopin ya fall 
 Sayin' my name like King James no pad adriatic 
 I'm paranoind but really don't panic 
 The life afta they say its colder then the packers 
 All and the damn money in the world is not a factor 
 Man true indeed 
 Upin the game with a mouth ta feed 
 I make a 360 spin homie rollin' the weed 
 Roll the weed 
 Roll the weed 
 Long live the king 
 We take a sertain situation to run an organizarion 
 Man bustin' like a (?) patient 
 Cooperation man seven years is what hes fakin 
 Now hes even more gangsta 'cause hes rollin' wit da nation 
 Now (?) yourself 
 Then I will talk like greedy Gretchin 
 Man hear the confession of my priffesion 
 Is Secession of illegal weapons 
 Up in a dot daytona 
 My Mexican girl she drank two coronas 
 And she know about the ayatolah 
 I'm movin through the clouds 
 You'd better hold me down 
 I'm smokin' weed and I'm g'd and ready ta clown 
 I love ta see you drown 
 You know I spit it 
 To get it 
 To flip it 
 To sell it 
 To air mail it to yo town 
 I'm like electical current 
 The playa reffereant 
 (??) Councourent 
 Because it's gonna hit the furnace 
 Man pitches the pictures of me 
 Picturin the bitches 
 And all up here sayin' write the scriptures 
 It gets worse 
 'Cause mentally you're cursed 
 You're livin' in a verse 
 Sometimes it hurts but baby yeah you know it works 
 Long live the king 
 Long live the king
