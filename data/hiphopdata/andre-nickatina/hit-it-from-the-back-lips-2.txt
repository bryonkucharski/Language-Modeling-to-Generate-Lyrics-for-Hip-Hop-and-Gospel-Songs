 Hehehe, wussup, ooh, that's nice what you got on, I like that 
 Girl it's after 12 oclock and we over high 
 You lookin' good enough to eat just like a slice of pie 
 And I can see I got you wet, you can't wait to fuck 
 But like the cherry that you are you're holdin' back that lust 
 Yous a sexy little caramel in a see-through shirt 
 And I'm a homie, lover, friend, ????? flirt 
 Wont you look into the mirror, baby, when you ride 
 And tell me how good it feels when I'm inside 
 'Cause that doja got dreamin', your talkin' got me fiendin 
 So keep on talkin' babygirl 'cause Ima have you creamin 
 Like ooh, yah, keep it right there, 
 Grab my ass while I pull your hair 
 It don't stop, sexy you can have every drop 
 Now turn that body over girl so I can get on top 
 And be cool with the lips, rude with the lips 
 While the covers ride down my back and off my hips 
 And you can feel yourself about to cum and just can't wait 
 With them ooh Nick it feels so good looks on your face 
 And it's workin, the nipples on your titties just a-perkin 
 We ready to do some freaky shit it ain't no use in perpin 
 The red light is on, my hands stay on your hips 
 Orgasm too I thought you knew I'm right back for the lips 
 And this is Dre

 Hehehe, wussup, you didn't um, you didn't think I could cum like that did you 
 But um, check this out, I got something else for you. 
 I'm trying to keep you wet, I'm trying to make you sweat 
 I'm trying to let you know that baby, I ain't done yet 
 Lets continue with the freaky shit, let me know I'm killin' it 
 Hittin that body from front to back, holdin' on to those caramel hips 
 Muah, ooh shit, it's something about your muffin girl that got your boy like lovin' it 
 Because it's tight, it's nice, and it feels right 
 You said I'm the best you ever had and you sure right 
 You sex fiend, caramel windows off like pumps 
 Legs on my shoulders I can feel myself about to nut 
 I slows it down, man I can't do that now 
 Big lips, a small waste, ass nice and round 
 So smack smack, I hit that booty from the back 
 You ask me do I like it but you already knowin' that 
 Your muscles tighten up, you feel your second nut 
 You want it deeper now you tellin' me to grab the butt 
 Now here comes mines, were racin for the same line 
 The person cums first they win like every time 
 Like ooh shit, I just shot out my soul 
 We sweatin like a race and barely got out all our clothes 
 That sexy dress, them high-heel pumps that don't dissect 
 Man call your boy I got your number and I got your back 
 Hehehe, it's like that, hit that booze, 
 What's your name again, I'm just fuckin' with you 
 Hehehe, thank me, THANK ME
