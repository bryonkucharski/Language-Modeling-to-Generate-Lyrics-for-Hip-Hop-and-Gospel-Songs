Oh well, all right you birds want me to make a speech? 
 Now - I'm in my leather coat 
 K-swiss new and white as coke 
 Its 2:45 and I'm on the streets 
 And I'm fillmoe down never wantin to sleep 
 Now - bitin like a wolverine 
 Tight like a group when ya hold a beam 
 My phylosophy baby is hold the cream 
 Then blow the weed then fold the g's 
 Now - cadillac rida form 
 2-27 yo the god was born 
 Cruisin through the town like a brick 
 For 4 days rich 
 But somebody snitched don't quit 
 Now- 
 The situation ? like college chicks 
 I'm gonna show you what the dolla gets 
 My homegirl say her impala hit 
 But she's a lyin' bitch 
 And I don't give a shit-now- 
 I done cracked the blunt 
 My lifes a game no time to front 
 ? 
 And we laugh like hyinas 
 Nickatina muthafucka now 
 Crooked little mind of yours 
 All in the air like a condor 
 Bust like a 44 all through a wood door 
 Replican fillmoe get paid stay paid nigga now 
 With a brand new cobra snake 
 All in your face bitch flaunt my bank 
 Watch the red devil fight as they run the tank 
 Goldfish don't have a chance to live, muthafucka-now 
 Jeans in a perfect crease 
 The homeboys say nicky give a speech 
 Money comes sweeter than a georgia peach 
 And I'm talkin' more shit in my k-swiss nigga-now 
 Now I'm in the mood for silence 
 ? Back lookin' at the city of violence 
 Filled with malice 
 Float to dallas 
 Tell the punk bitch with her dad I'm at this now 
 45 caps I spit 
 All in the car man weed is lit 
 Imagine what all them g's will get 
 And I'm a greedy motherfucker can you feel this shit now 
 Actin' like lazer tag 
 Through the airport with my polo bag 
 Touchdown now her come the gift of gat 
 Baby born to rap homie pull your gats now 
 The sound of a symphony 
 The bullets make a whistle that's harmony 
 The feelin' of the pain is agony 
 Street court done made another tragedy now
