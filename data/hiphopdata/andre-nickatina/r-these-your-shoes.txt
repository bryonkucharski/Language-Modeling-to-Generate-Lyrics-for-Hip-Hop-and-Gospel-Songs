(Verse 1: Andre Nickatina) 
 Adidas was a tiger that worshipped drank 
 Stayed drunk but he moved straight pounds of dank 
 Sweet tobacco was his cousin and his freak Han Smith 
 Knew Adidas had clout, so they watched his grip 
 Reebok's a ex-cop 
 That moved to Bangkok 
 Moved back and had a plan on how to move coke rocks 
 Disappeared he was moving hella weight throughout the year 
 Till a deal went bad 
 He hid that ass 
 And shot off his right ear 
 Kenneth Cole was a baller in the Dublin Hills 
 He loved when fine women kissed 
 That was his main thrill 
 He owned a club 
 He taught Adidas how to sell bud 
 His license plate read on the Lexus: "NoLove" 
 Stacy Adams was the brother of Tracy Adams 
 Who was doing time in Chino for gat 'n' nap (?) 
 It was a twist 
 Tracy used to fuck with K-Swiss 
 He used to fuck with Kenneth Cole way back in '86 
 Trace fell in love 
 Stacy said the freak was on drugs 
 She done licked hella nuts of my tennis shoe thugs 
 Up on his bump was a tiger named All-Star Chuck 
 Who used to drink 7-Up 
 And used to love when guns bust 
 With no fear 
 Face full of tattooed deer 
 Reebok didn't know it, Chuck shot off his ear 
 Now Nike was a pisces with first-of-kin 
 Who had a wife that packed a knife name Timberland 
 That was important 
 They always was the first with the Jordans 
 Clothes and cologne be the shit that they be sportin' 
 K-Swiss was a bitch that made bread breeding pits 
 Fine ass bitch that snorted hop and shit 
 But Stacy stay (?) made sure that her shoes was always late 
 Loved to fuck to Al Green and loved the wash car face (?) 
 With Fila 
 Now he was a tennis shoe pimp 
 Said he played high school basketball like Shawn Kemp 
 But was fascinated and demonstrated macking at its finest 
 Gift of gab loved his (?) he the flyest 
 Here's the shocker 
 The motherfucker always act proper 
 With at least nine freaks down in Lady's Footlocker 
 Tick-tock (8x) 
 (Verse 2: Shag Nasty) 
 Now Mr. Adida just got out on a misdemeanor 
 Got caught up on a violation cause Pro said she seen him 
 Creepin' up out of Reebok's house 
 The same night he got robbed 
 And got his ass took out 
 Now it's a fucked up thing 
 'Cause he got up with Reebok's rings 
 He said that he won them 
 From him in a dice game 
 So they had to acquit him 
 Because the bloody glove didn't fit him 
 A chance for Nike to bounce back like a real nigga 
 All he got to do was mention Pro 
 He never ever file again 
 And never make a trial again 
 That's when the bounce backs begin 
 'Cause he swooped up little penny under him 
 And plus his girl was Timberland 
 She had the hook on they canes 
 And hooked him up with the NBA 
 Niggas Banging Association so now they straight paid 
 But ain't that a bitch 
 They bounced too quick 
 And Mr. Adida and Sweet Tobacco can't be having that 
 Shit, the next lick is to hit they shit 
 And take they shit 
 And leave them with they wigs split 
 While Mr. Fila kicking back like he all legit 
 Until somebody get took out 
 And him and Steeltoe will be running shit 
 Tick-tock (14x)
