I'm a chameleon I change like a deceptacon 
 In the blink of an eye I'm gone 
 With the wind, I check yo? chin just like a fuckin' dentists 
 Bitch I gets my nuts I eat my steak I'm gonna finish 
 But check it Can you smell the murder 'cause it's thick 
 Killa baller in this bitch Now you filthy rich 
 Wrong! What how? It ain't that easy pal 
 I'm nickatina andre seen ya feel my drug lifestyle yeah 
 Make money big baby 
 No bitch that ain't my baby 
 I wore a Jimmy hat that day see 
 And we only fucked once is you crazy 
 So like a titanic if you panic you is guaranteed to sink 
 I make scrilla like a brink I'm rare like a mink 
 So like a picture-perfect moment, nigga say cheese 
 Why do I keep runnin' if 5-0 say freeze 
 Fresh adidas creep across the bathroom floor 
 And never underestimate a sexyass whore nigga
