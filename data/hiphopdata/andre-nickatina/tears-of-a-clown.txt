It's mines I want that give me that 
 Ricky shake the party screamin "where the remy at" 
 Spinnin like some rims on some daytons and vouges 
 And my my my how the indo goes 
 Freeze like a frosty with the cappucino taste 
 Nickname my product like cookies in the cake 
 Like damn baby I'm lovin' your beautiful face 
 But my fillmoe heart got my whole mindstate 
 So illegal like moonshine ryme design 
 Temper like a phoneix when I open my eyes 
 And mash on it crash on it blast on it 
 Count your money put your stash on it cash on it 
 Bring your lifejacket 'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down 
 Bring yo life jacket 'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown 
 Rapid fire from the empire wit no desire 
 Walking on a tightwire born again liar 
 You might not understand my love for rap 
 But until then show me where the money's at 
 And my tigers want cognac kovosia 
 Clownin on freaks anytime of the day 
 With no pause no shame no game no blame 
 Tearin' up the streets in my all star chucks 
 I'ma liquidate 'em all wit unforgettable paragraphs 
 It was all for the money so we took the wrong path (POW) 
 I got bullets that'll crack the sky 
 Hit nacys for a burger milkshake and frys 
 "Nicky why" is what they say when I hit the set 
 With no reply I'm gettin' high so they gots to geuss 
 But bring a lifejacket 'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down 
 Bring a lifejacket 'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown 
 Dot dot dotta dot 
 Dot dot dotta 
 Dot dot dotta dot 
 Dot dot dotta 
 Da messy getin crazy lookin' like a cry baby 
 Bacardi at the party for the flyest young lady 
 I told you about the frostys wit the cappucino taste 
 But what about the cats wit the gats in ya face? check it 
 Luxery weapons facsinate the brain 
 Baby get your ticket we on soul train 
 With nicky nicky raps raps nicky nicky rymes 
 Nicky nicky caps caps nicky nicky crimes 
 I mob through the city as I crank the beat 
 Fire up tuff on the gangsta streets 
 Steer to the reer like a clear alear jet 
 Hit the corner like a shadow with the grey siloette 
 Like rex what's next 
 I gotta keep it bumpin 
 I gotta clown something when the hoes start frontin 
 And why I stay high off mary j. blige 
 And when there's a drought all birds do fly 
 All through the air till they hit yo set 
 And if you talk too much then you will get wet 
 But bring a life jacket 'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down 
 Bring a lifejacket'cause you just might drown 
 Have you ever seen the tears of a clown 
 (Ohohoh oh hahahaha your killin' me man 
 Hohoho your killin' me hahahaha oh shit)
