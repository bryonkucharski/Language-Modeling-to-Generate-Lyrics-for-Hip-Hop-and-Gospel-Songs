How can sick can one nigga be 
 You think I'm off that PCP but its Chewy! 
 A lot of niggas never heard of me 
 I said beware of me 
 Now they scared of me 
 Hu... I said come to my Sunday service 
 Nigga seen who the reverend was then they got nervous 
 The niggity nasty Jim Jones 
 Boot ya in the head, 
 Steal toes to the dome 
 Poted dank, fools it's your choice 
 Niggas hate my face but they love my voice 
 And just like that, I make them ball and nob 
 Kiss the hand of a true dog god 
 Cross ya heart foo, and hope to die 
 Cause you will die when you crucify 
 'Cause I gots frisco all sewed up 
 Pitbulls in a bunch hidin in the cuts 
 'Cause when I say it, I mean no mercy 
 The frisco hitler, turnin' cali to Germany 
 I'm a down muthafucka when my homies call 
 20 rock while my dogs roll up like fog 
 This was a triple six verse not a triple four 
 And after this, I'm gonna give you some more 
 Yeah and it don't stop 
 Yeah and it won't quit 
 Dre dog is in the house 
 Fuck that muthafuckin bullshit 
 My father abandoned me, my mother couldn't handle me 
 That's why I made ill mater of my family 
 Nigga you ain't shit, I'm the lyrical lord 
 Ask what's up nigga, two plus four 
 'Cause when I catch you I'm gonna bust your dick 
 Roll up a blunt, chewy and tai stick 
 I snort caine, and do cocktails 
 Make way for the six five killa whale 
 That love to box and don't care if I die 
 With fists that will open and shut your eye 
 Niggas hate dre dog, so I'll die one day 
 But reappear like the lord on easter Sunday 
 Yeah, dankers going to call me puff daddy 
 Dippin in a caddy, pant hood a saggy 
 I don't play dead, I don't roll over 
 Turn ya back and I'll break ya shoulder 
 A voice that will sufficate your ass like plastic 
 A throat that will chug a lug battery acid 
 I'm dre dog, can you tell I'm high? 
 Nigga heres a shovel, dig deep into my mind 
 You violatin, and a blow ya a chin 
 And after this muthafucka I'll come again 
 Yeah and it don't stop 
 Yeah and it don't quit 
 Dre dog is in the house 
 Fuck that muthafuckin bullshit 
 Yeah and it won't stop 
 Yeah and it don't quit 
 Dre dog is in the house 
 Fuck that muthafuckin bullshit 
 Open up the frisco gates of hell 
 Fillmo, HP, dre, RBL 
 And the siccer I come, the more they run 
 I'm in a rage, off that indo and cocaine 
 You got my fade nigga that was my chewy 
 Fuck ya crew cause ya crew never knew me 
 And just like the world turns muthafucka that burns like mase 
 When dre dog is in ya face 
 So come nigga, but I'm a come quicker 
 Finger nails will make ya call me jack the ripper 
 And then I'll crack yo back like a flower seed 
 Punch you in the back of ya head and make ya eyes bleed 
 Dre dog won't stop 
 Cause its 187 on a muthafuckin cop 
 And ya stripes will get took quick, bust ya damn dick 
 By a reckless young black pit 
 Indo or tai, nigga let's get high 
 2 to 3 blunts and watch the red eyes 
 Plot, watch me plot 
 911,415, coughnut I'm in a hot spot 
 Get ya glock, and ya gauge your there for me 
 And fortay get the rest of OCP 
 And all the punks will pound them 
 You want to hear this with a beat nigga, buy the fuckin' album 
 But for now heres a scripture, 
 In the back of the bible you'll see my picture 
 Ill mannered, RBL, fortay, it's a triple team 
 And man I'm ghost and oh yeah sweet dreams
