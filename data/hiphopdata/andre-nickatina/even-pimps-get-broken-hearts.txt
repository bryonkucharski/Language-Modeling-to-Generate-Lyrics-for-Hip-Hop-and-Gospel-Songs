Even pimps get broken hearts 
 I spark the line stay trivia 
 Blow you to oblivia 
 To give me, a 
 Semi auto with led 
 Keep a rap in my head like ruboys keep a lock full of dreads 
 Twist like a tornado the fatal cuban jewel 
 Run around the world saying gangsta rap rules 
 Give an F finger to the flyest freak 
 While I'm sitting right there in the drivers seat 
 Smoke a blunt for the gods at the crack of dawn 
 I think them rings that I stole I'm bout ready to pawn 
 Because I grin like a P-2 10 a sun lock 
 Rapper of the cats got glocks on cock 
 Walk like a rat when it comes to the cheddar 
 And in any kind of weather with the 3 quarter leather 
 The lethal injection with the Chinese connection 
 First we amp up 
 Then we vamp up 
 Watch them other muthafuckas all clamp up 
 Baby talk to much ricky shut the tramp up 
 I enter through the back door exit through the front 
 We don't jock bitches, tiga fire up the blunt 
 Heat up ya chest like yukon jack 
 Work ya credit card the first day to the max 
 The 5 millimeter, 
 Nickatina 
 Street cleaner 
 I bounce back and forth from fillmo to korea 
 The chronic chokin rap child bustin' it loud 
 I stand still while I'll rap trying to move the crowd 
 In my koneiact lounge position 
 Bullet shots rang right before in the mision 
 Muthafuckas thought andre was going to listen 
 But my detroit roots told me hit 'em with the piston 
 Rip the compositions 
 What was yo intention? 
 No gratitude just attitude 
 Bangin' like mission 
 Kill doja 
 I thought I told ya 
 I sports leather while you wear summer clothesa 
 My boss theme 
 Andre going to get you back 
 Yeah I rap but the streets is where my heart is at 
 And my crudentials 
 No insturmentals 
 I'm like a bullet in ya face right through the window 
 What! 
 The proof is in the fudge, money, raps and drugs 
 Nigga keep your hugs 
 Nigga keep ya love 
 Billie Holiday just crossed my mind 
 Everything she sang was right on time 
 I can tell in my soul I was just her kind 
 'Cause I can see a better life when I close my eyes
