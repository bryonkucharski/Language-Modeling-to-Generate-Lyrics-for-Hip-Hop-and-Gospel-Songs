(Rob Sonic, spoken) 
 This is the sniper picnic, we got my man Creature 
 We got Hangar 18, Big Wiz on the one and two, Fred Ones behind the boards 
 And we gonna do it, a little somethin' like... 
 (Rob Sonic) 
 They want more feel to come out of it so 
 They stood there watchin' all the counterfeits show 
 Tell everybody that the pauper's here 
 And you can tell by the pellets they took out of his man 
 You're better off breakin' your analysis' nose 
 Especially if your young and your talented don't 
 The checks generally got them balances though 
 There's them stars on the helmets like they're Dallas's, go 
 One way, innocence, two way radio 
 Gateway druggie with the run down ratio 
 War time crazy, go great with my look in fact 
 Ripped shit, bill a sale, stared when I took it back 
 You on some afternoon raps for the CD- 
 Crowd (show, you're?) syndicated, trapped on repeat 
 I'm on some late night, canned if I don't eat sleep 
 Honolu Vincent Price bad luck tiki 
 Bad in-flight plan, buckle-in 
 Truck rhyme, nozzle flow, high-code government 
 Auto-response, beats made of bufferin' 
 Wildstyle, peace of mind, wheat paste puzzlin' 
 (Creature) 
 Stand out, like a midget on stilts ridin' a unicycle 
 With a rifle as big as a stilt, ready to snipe you 
 Look, your own mens say they don't like you 
 They say you act like a bitch when she's on her menstrual cycle 
 Your parents should've advised you 
 It's apparent a blind man must've guided you 
 You ain't built to do the things that I do 
 Young Muddy Waters, Creats flow like he's out the Bayou 
 Inner City Blues, make you bleed, but I'm not Piru 
 Soul food for thought for seeds and sinners, too 
 Curt Mayfield, or Kurt Cobain 
 The boy heroin, need to squirt him in your veins, YUH 
 (Rob Sonic) 
 Quickly, get to the top of the roof 
 And head behind the car where the arsenal moved 
 And right beside the well, use the operative rounds 
 To let these motherfuckers know, there's no stoppin' you now 
 It goes- Downtown, up top, all about, audio 
 New York, New York, all about, audio 
 Downtown, up top, all about, audio 
 New York, New York, all about, audio 
 (Windnbreeze) 
 (Blitz sky?), polymorphic Hangar-eight-status 
 Swerve care-free, always did, no bounds out of it 
 Cloaked down, summonin' my sumo-samurai 
 Larynx, catalyst, switch blade, carriage ride 
 Come on baby, don't cry, two-wheel spokesperson 
 Indo in your window, crack shadow where you flows circlin' 
 Boys burglin' soundscape, caught up in the scenery 
 Respond in a lounge- wait, caught up in a dream of me 
 Walkin' with a dramamine, spinnin' like I'm Seraphine 
 Afro-king dime, Lyme disease flow-er 
 One-touch, finger flooder, no quip 
 Got the Hangar bolt on the shoulderpad, star on the helmet tip 
 (Alaska) 
 Son, take a moment, catch your breath and own it 
 Home is for the heretics and Merrill-Lynch components 
 Nepotize, extra fries, five-alive, pesticides 
 Pride patriotic, gotta gobble up the exercise 
 Aerobic (class cats) phobias (abstract) 
 Fast-track race pace faith-based (scratch that) 
 Calomine or palomine, a Valentine to wash it 
 Downtown signs, why am I resigned to rock it? 
 Mechanical, arm-and-leg and beggin' for the armageddon 
 Army's gettin' ready for spaghetti western confrontations 
 Patience is a virtue that I work through as I case the joint 
 Anoint, take the apron, cut the strings, and I made my point
