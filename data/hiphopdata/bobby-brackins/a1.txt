 Hit the club with the homies, leave with three chicks 
 Please don't step on my Louis', I'm a be pissed 
 On some G shit flyer than a G6 
 Yeah, my whole crew is gettin' paid now 
 Busload of honnies', I need a grayhound 
 Haters swing from my nuts, I need a playground 
 Shawties love my voice, I got a great sound 
 Live good, is tatted on my fingers 
 I'm searchin' models and R&B singers 
 I got an actress and she don't even act right 
 You can use my pick-a-ring as a flashlight

 Plus yo girl let me poke like an eye-gouge 
 Hop in European wheels every time we ride out 
 Got a change car and money at the hideout 
 Bet I shine if it's cloudy or it's bright out 
 It's easy to get breezies all in my house 
 I got something to alleviate your dry mouth

 Made another hit for the radio station 
 Two chains to compliment my Rolex 
 Haters so stale, oh well, we so fresh

 Check it off, and then I bring the dough back in 
 Flashing lights, I'm taking pictures like Kodak film 
 I'm takin' trips, different stripper different city 
 You sayin' goodbye girl, I'm sayin' hello kitty 
 My girl's got nice toes, I gotta keep 'em pretty 
 My friends go so hard, so I keep 'em with me 
 Warm like a chimney, bring it back like a Frisbee 
 In the bed, I'm bustin' hard like a semi 
 Automatic, signed, sealed, delivered 
 Baby I'm yours turn you out like a pivot 
 I'm good, awesome, naughty fantastic 
 Gotta stay fly, I'm A1, it's a habit
