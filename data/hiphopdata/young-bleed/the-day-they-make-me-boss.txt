Hey dog, you know who this is right? 
 It's that G street shit nigga you know what I'm talkin' about 
 Come on 
 Southside, niggas make that money 
 Make that ah ah 
 Northside, niggas make that money 
 Make that hah 
 Eastside niggas make that money 
 Make that ah ah 
 Westside niggas make that money 
 Make that 
 Live life in legacy is my destiny nigga fo sho 
 You know I'd rather take it slow doe 
 Hoppin out the four door 
 Ride 
 Dramatized off in this game but it ain't no disrespecting myself 
 So it ain't no disrespectin my game 
 Can you hear me meng? 
 Better watch where ya walkin' if you talkin' that shit 
 Especially if you counterfeit 
 Fuck around and get your wig split 
 Tryna dig shit 
 But really I ain't no murderer 
 But hear me when I say 
 Nigga I ain't never heard of ya 
 Full of that weed 
 I get to bellin on the block 
 Doin' bout fo-five 
 Takin' nathen from none a y'all 
 So you know I ain't no jive 
 Nigga that's my mentality 
 Whut 
 Don't catch no casualty 
 Nigga cause in reality 
 Whut 
 It's 'bout a salary 
 Nigga I'm from a town called fresh 
 Off your motherfuckin ass 
 Steady mobbin to the gunblast 
 Take a turn in my way 
 See me playin' wit my A.K. 
 And smokin' on some hay on Valentine's Day 
 Nigga hah hear me say whut 
 See me ridin' cool as glide 
 With my thang right by my side 
 Suggesting y'all put down your pride 
 Cause only playa hatas die 
 And ain't no love for the other side 
 So ain't no way I'ma let it ride 
 I-oh I oh I 
 (x2) 
 Nigga come get some bump and put yo mug on and bitch meng 
 Playa hatas gonna get served when I put my gloves on now get right 
 When you interfere in my zone get caught up in a rapture 
 You can't capture the kick crime bones and slap it ask hops 
 Traveling through the hearts of men 
 I can see all the sin we in 
 Some of ya'l gonna pretend 
 To the end and back again 
 So it ain't no friends 
 Hey now 
 That's why I don't play nah 
 You gonna hear a nigga say hah 
 Give a fuck about none of y'all 
 Give a fuck about one time 
 That's why I stay high till I die 
 Steady countin' my fetti 
 Little nigga nuts to finally got heaven 
 See me walkin' wit a cowgirl don't know down to eleven 
 To the back of a chevy 
 Ready or not here I come 
 So can I be the chosen one 
 Noddin like a poppa don 
 Click gettin' ready to drop the bomb 
 Booya bam you were here me say damn 
 Steady walkin' and talkin' in the silence of the lambs 
 And I cram to understand 
 With a pistol in hand 
 Impress another killin' clan 
 Tryna figure how a nigga just could kill a man 
 Maybe 'cause he ain't feel the man 
 My niggas got me trippin' off the shit they play in my head 
 Fatal visions of that infrared 
 Nigga crucified on the cross 
 In the land of the lost 
 And resurrected 
 On the day they made me boss in this motherfucker 
 God bless the child that hold his own on the microphone 
 Home alone and name is Corleone 
 Tryna get it before its gone 
 Hoppin in the cadillac broham 
 And I'm on in time 
 Feelin' like the world is mine 
 Single handedly on the grime 
 Tryna stay away from one-time 
 Don't mind but a gotta figure 
 All these years if I pull this trigger 
 With niggas chestin up like their nuts got bigger 
 Cause bitches still hollerin thugs and my niggas 
 Fore score about 24 years ago just a pimp ho 
 Momma told me how the game go 
 And it's still the same skinny nigga lookin' for the rainbow 
 To the top of the world if you ain't afraid 
 Nigga let's get paid 
 Hear me holler fuck 'em all 
 If they bitch made 
 Switchin like switch blade 
 Hey naw that's why I don't play now 
 You'll hear a nigga say hah 
 Give a fuck about none a y'all 
 Give a fuck about one time 
 That's why I stay high till I die 
 Come back again to the hearts of men no longer living in sin 
 Still smokin' my weed sippin on a half pint of gin 
 With a devilish grin 
 JD's revenge 
 In the lap of luxury 
 It ain't no touchin me ho bitch 
 Fuck wit me 
 On a daily maybe 
 Bosses
