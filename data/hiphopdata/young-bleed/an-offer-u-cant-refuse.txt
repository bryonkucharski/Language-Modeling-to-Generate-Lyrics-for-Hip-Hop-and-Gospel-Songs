(Young Bleed) 
 Hey give me weed for a G and let me mob 
 And fuck what you talkin' about playa 
 'Cause I do my job 
 I never knew nothin' but hustlin 
 Struggle and strive just to stay alive 
 Never could keep a nine to five 
 So I'm making my cent 
 A proposition that you can't refuse 
 In it to win it, never lose 
 Steady payin' dues 
 I hear 'em hollerin, say bleed you got the juice now 
 Got me nerved up and ready to knock some shit loose now 
 But hold me down 
 And let me know you know for sure 
 When you see me sideways ballin out the door 
 Gone to the liquor store 
 Commin off the slab 
 Smokin' on some weed with plenty hoes to stab 
 On behalf of the Concentration Camp 
 We breaking bread for life 
 So everything gonna be all right now 
 My nigga my nerve 
 Fresh off the curb 
 Jelly, jam, and preserve 
 Nothin' but balls and my word 
 Fuck what you heard 
 Smoke something nigga
