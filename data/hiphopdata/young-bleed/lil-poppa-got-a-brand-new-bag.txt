 (Young Bleed) 
 Go get that paper Lil Pop, fuck all that drama and drag 
 Don't stop for nuttin my noggin just put it down with a sag 
 I never knew nothin' better than choppin cheddar for cheese 
 Passin my enemies, blowin' in the breeze 
 Don't make it no murder my nigga, niggaz die young where I'm from 
 Sippin on redrum, poppin' till the dead drunk 
 Make money my nigga but keep it real doe cause Soldier boyz 
 Be stompin in steel toes, with nuttin to live foe, ya heard me fool? 
 That's how I come up, that's how it go down 
 Niggaz and bitches make the world go 'round, without a sound 
 We clown low down and dirty with the Dirty Dirty flippin 
 From a nickel bag of weed, to a thirty thirty 
 Holla at ya boy, umeployed, in the welfare line gettin' mine 
 Smellin like a pound of paiyan, however we shine 
 In blind fury dodgin the judge and the jury 
 They wanna beat me but can't see me 'cause they vision too blurry 
 I ride from state to state, seein them checkin' my plate 
 It's like, everywhere you go they gotta playa hate a nigga main 
 I do my thang from here to Maine, like it ain't no thang (What? Uh) 
 Cause see you gotta let 'em hang main, fuck that shit 
 (Maxinelli) 
 Nigga, get your minnnnd right, 'cause when the timmmmme's right 
 Niggaz'll put yo' ass to sleep, I thinks deep (Huh bro?) 
 Fuck what you heard, you gots to see to believe 
 And if you blind to visualize a nigga chasin this cheese 
 Down on my knees at my bedside, sayin' my grace 
 Cause in the mornin I'll be gone a nigga makin' my way, OK 
 I keep 'em jumpin' like the jacks to little macks, my netti 
 Ready for confedi and FUCK what they tryin' to tell me 
 I'm bout to get it and the only way I know 
 Is rappin' if it don't happen I'm makin' bitches hit the flo', you know 
 Fuck block to block hoe, it's coast to coast, and it's easy 
 We G and do it legit those raps with locs 
 On the fork but game sharper than a surgeon for scalpel 
 You wanna battle no hassle come let me kick it whatcha asked foe 
 And razzle yo' ass, nut up like heaven and hash 
 As my little brain's tearin the tenament blast; they pity ass 
 But I'm flickin my ashes stickin asses of bastards 
 Fieldin shit like flea flickers and kickin it with G niggaz 
 See what you makin' with the raise at your job 
 Is what a nigga like this here can shake two days in the mob 
 And I could (do what main?) be my own boss employed by the streets 
 I'm chasin Jakes and player haitian on Friday the 15th 
 With my Air Mack splendid Nike's on my feet 
 With weed in the air, soul secluded from the police 
 'Cause I'm a little on the wild side, thuggin' and pluggin 
 That make a nigga wanna jack for the fuck of it, but see 
 I makes peace to get the shit a nigga wish he could have 
 Long as you stay the fuck out they pop a brand new bag, nigga what?
