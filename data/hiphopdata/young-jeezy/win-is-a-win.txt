I hope my words they insipre ya, spoke like a true leader 
 The first to admit life's more than two seaters 
 Man oh man how my priorities fucked up 
 Remember nights I'm passin' out in the Rari, too fucked up 
 My niggas say spend it cause you can't take it witcha' 
 Same time poppin' Cristal, posing for pictures 
 Ol' smart ass nigga, half right and half wrong 
 Only problem is he still here and the money gone 
 Oh me, oh my, give me a natural high 
 When I think about the nights we threw them Rollies in the sky 
 When I was so mother fuckin' clean on 'em, need a tie 
 Every hater in the club was just wishin' we would die 
 A hustlers life is filled with decisions he gotta make 
 Remeber when I got the news I was ready to cry late 
 Swear my levy was 'bout to break, lost religion and all my faith 
 I swear I seen the same shit happen to (?) 
 Can you imagine that look I had on my face? 
 Saw my nigga layin' still in a box with a waste 
 Got me feelin' sick, like I'm 'bout to vomit 
 I guess a loss ain't shit if you ain't learn somethin' from it 
 Got me pacin' round the room, yeah NASCAR nigga 
 See my nigga (?) in a fast car nigga 
 I'm like "Why you ridin' that? Them boys is mysteries nigga" 
 Live real or die tryin' is still a victory nigga
