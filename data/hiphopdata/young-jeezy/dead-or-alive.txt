They want it, I got it, damn right I'ma flaunt it 
 Do anything you want, just don't get up on it 
 Them O.G.'s raised, you know them streets made me 
 Equipped with the gator, drive these young bitches crazy 
 Baby that's crazy, more like a straight jacket 
 We stack it all up, and then we Greenbay pack it 
 Never in ya life seen this many rubber bands 
 Never in ya life seen this many hundred grands 
 Now dippin' in the paint, you ain't seen this money man 
 The soul I would assume, but you was in the room 
 Money so dirty gotta sweep it with a broom 
 Plus you got 'em Jigga trickin' early afternoon 
 Go hard on my liver, feel sorry for my bladder 
 I stop when I die, bitch it don't even matter 
 Dead or alive, I'm in ya top five 
 Even ask ya hoe, bet I'm in ya bitch ride 
 Everybody be cool, I ain't tryna make a scene 
 First new Camaro that the city's ever seen 
 And that bitch clean, and that bitch runnin' 
 I ain't got a bitch so I treat her like my woman 
 I tell her slow down, now baby speed up 
 Gon' show ya ass, let them haters see us 
 Red, white and blue stones, yeah the chain's like hey 
 South by say, I gave my jeweler one-eighty 
 My folks get it in like the Coast Guard lay 
 That's why my crib lookin' like a postcard baby 
 Tell 'em what you think of me, so far lady 
 Clip so long it need a chauffeur baby 
 Go hard on my liver, feel sorry for my bladder 
 I stop when I die, bitch it don't even matter 
 Dead or alive, I'm in ya top five 
 Even ask ya hoe, bet I'm in ya bitch ride 
 Everybody be cool, I ain't tryna make a scene 
 First new Camaro that the city's ever seen 
 And that bitch clean, and that bitch runnin' 
 I ain't got a bitch so I treat her like my woman 
 I tell her slow down, now baby speed up 
 Gon' show ya ass, let them haters see us 
 Red, white and blue stones, yeah the chain's like hey 
 South by say, I gave my jeweler one-eighty 
 My folks get it in like the Coast Guard lay
