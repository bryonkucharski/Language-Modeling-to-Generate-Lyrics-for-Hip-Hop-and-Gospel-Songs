(Aye aye aye aye...) 
 (Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta!) 
 (Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta!)

 Straight fool in my black bandana,

 Ain't shit changed, still rep the Ma'ia; 
 Mission impossible, 
 I still do that chore. 
 New tour, new shoes, right time I cruise. 
 I'm a boss mothafucka', yeah, I paid my dues. 
 Dance off for the white - nicknamed Alaska. 
 Ain't nothin' on your face? throw ten right at ya! 
 New Porsche truck and it's heroin-tan, 
 Got the GT coupe and it's coca-leaf-green. 
 You know I got the wheels to match. 
 Brickonometry; lets talk math... 
 Got a fresh 18 if you try payin' half, 
 And a 17.5 if you brought all the cash.

 You know me, I do what the gangstas do. 
 Give me about an hour and I'll move a few. 
 Give me another hour and I'll move a few more - 
 That's half a mil' spread across the living room floor. 
 Ain't never had a job, but I know that work; 
 Weed-man - outta kush? then I'll blow that purp'. 
 Now it's a first-class flight for my first-class ass, 
 Got a bitch from the D' with some first-class flaps. 
 Niggas in my trap with some first-class rocks... 
 Keep ya eyes on the prize, nigga, watch that scale, 
 One false move and your ass in jail - 
 Don't matter anyway, y'already goin' to hell. 
 (Let's get it!)

 Yeah my nigga's doing years, 
 But them goons still out here. 
 Better watch your mouth, yeah, them fools' still out here. 
 I'm good in the D' and I'm great in the 'Lou... 
 My niggas hold me down when I'm out in L.A. 
 I smoke good in the wild wild west, 
 With nothing but the best Cali' off my chest. 
 I'm even good in the U.K. man, 
 Brats pick me up when I step off the plane. 
 Half Turkish, other half is German; 
 Layin' in hotels, getting head in London. 
 Fresh out the club, nigga, straight to my flight... 
 8 hours non-stop I'm in Atlanta by tonight.
