I pour out a little liquor (Uh-huh) 
 RIP to my niggas (Rest in peace) 
 I pour out a little liquor 
 Evil thoughts in your mind keep running through 
 Not quite sure what you wanna do 
 Like, what is this world coming to? 
 Life goes on even if you don't want it to (Uh-huh) 
 It's a sad ride home if the good die young do the bad die old? (Let me know) 
 I'm just trying to carry my load another good nigga livin' by the bad guy code 
 Lookin' for the Lord but the devil spoke to you 
 When you lose a loved one or somebody that's close to you 
 People turning they back meaning the most to you 
 Then you find out your man is sending them folks to you 
 Maybe you shed a tear and you never cry 
 Always true to your word and you never lie 
 Got your hand on them birds you would let 'em fly 
 Yeah, cause real niggas never die (What?) 
 Somebody tell me why (why) 
 Why the good die young (why) 
 Sometimes it makes me cry (cry) 
 To know that you're gone 
 Hold on to the memories 
 Not a day goes by I 
 Hear a voice saying dry those eyes 
 'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die, no 
 Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die 
 Real niggas never die 
 I had love for this music but ain't know how to pursue it, 
 Was frustrated as a teen I needed money for Buicks, 
 My shirt was stained from the sewage, 
 Niggas rockin' the newest, 
 I dealt with it for the moment but couldn't call it the future, 
 I'm down a block from the shootin', 
 It started to sound like recruitin', 
 Seein' niggas I grew up with sleep to funeral music, 
 And I was only fifteen, 
 I parted ways with my schoolin', 
 My first seven grams of work were like my holy communion and now I'm turnt out, 
 The block hot, niggas burnt out, 
 With no heart it's cold cash that we search out, 
 We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out, 
 Retaliation, get back exactly what the turf bout, 
 And it's a gang of young niggas I was hurt 'bout 
 On the real I almost shed tears in the church house 
 Back when I thought real niggas couldn't die 
 Learnt I was wrong but still couldn't cry 
 Somebody tell me why (why) 
 Why the good die young (why) 
 Sometimes it makes me cry (cry) 
 To know that you're gone 
 Hold on to the memories 
 Not a day goes by I 
 Hear a voice saying dry those eyes 
 'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die, no 
 Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die 
 Real niggas never die 
 Since everybody real, where the fakers at? 
 Since everybody trill, where the flakers at? 
 Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at? 
 Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at? 
 Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won! 
 Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done? 
 My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard 
 Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds 
 No Illuminati never been a fan of saints 
 That's what happens when you room big as central station 
 Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with 
 We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with 
 What you know about five eatin' off a half 
 That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math 
 Oxymoron these rap niggas don't lie 
 This real nigga shit and real niggas don't die 
 Somebody tell me why (why) 
 Why the good die young (why) 
 Sometimes it makes me cry (cry) 
 To know that you're gone 
 Hold on to the memories 
 Not a day goes by I 
 Hear a voice saying dry those eyes 
 'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die, no 
 Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die) 
 They never die 
 Real niggas never die 
 I pour out a little liquor 
 RIP to my niggas
