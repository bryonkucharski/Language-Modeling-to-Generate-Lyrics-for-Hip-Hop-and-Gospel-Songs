I fucked my money up 
 I bought another Rarri' 
 That's right Ferrarium 
 Least that's what they gon' call me 
 You know what I'm thinkin' 
 Park it by the Lambo 
 But my garage is closed, it's all that it can handle. 
 Watching me some Scarface, 
 Breaking down this kilo 
 They ask me what the lick read, 1 triple 0 
 Pull up in something crazy, just like a superhero 
 Them boys they got that bullshit 
 You know that Coke Zero 
 If you ain't ridin' with me, it's 1-800-FUCK-YOU 
 Don't make me get them things out 
 You know that I would love to, love to, come through, something new, brand new 
 Aim it at the front porch hit everybody but you 
 Yeah, get into it, get into it, get into it 
 Yeah, that drug dealin' muzik 
 That's how I do's it 
 See my chain just sittin' there 
 That motherfucker lazy 
 It say shit to the girls like, 
 I know you see me baby 
 One time for my AK 
 That motherfucker crazy 
 And every nigga that owed me 
 That motherfucker paid me 
 And every day I'm iced out, gatted up, tatted up 
 Take that money right out the bag 
 Throw it on the floor then we add it up, add it up 
 G Stack Here, G Stack there 
 Sofa over there by the wall? 
 That right there my G-Stack chair. 
 Too much money I can count it better when I'm high 
 I ain't bout to miss shit so I guess I'm sleeping when I die.
