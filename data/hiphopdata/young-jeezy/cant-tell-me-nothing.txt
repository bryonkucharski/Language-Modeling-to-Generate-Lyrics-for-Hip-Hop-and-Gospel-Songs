La la la la 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven 
 When I awoke I spent that on a necklace 
 I told God I'd be back in a second 
 Man, it's so hard not to act reckless 
 To whom much is given, much is tested 
 Get arrested, guess until he get the message 
 I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny 
 And what'd I do? Act more stupidly 
 Bought more jewelry, More Louis V. 
 My mama couldn't get through to me 
 The drama, people suing me 
 I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me 
 I'm just saying how I feel man 
 I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman 
 I guess the money should've changed them 
 I guess I should've forgot where I came from 
 La la la la 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 La la la la 
 Then you can't tell me nothing right? 
 Excuse me, is you saying something? 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 You can't tell me nothing 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 Let up the suicide doors 
 This is my life homie, you decide yours 
 I know that Jesus died for us 
 But I couldn't tell you who decide wars 
 So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways 
 Old folks talking 'bout back in my day 
 But homie, this is my day 
 Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late? 
 No I already graduated 
 And you can live through anything if Magic made it 
 They say I talk with so much emphasis 
 Ooh, they so sensitive 
 Don't ever fix your lips like collagen 
 Then say something where you gon end up apolog'in 
 Let me know if it's a problem then 
 A'ight man, holla then 
 La la la la 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 La la la la 
 Then you can't tell me nothing right? 
 Excuse me, is you saying something? 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 You can't tell me nothing 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 Let the champagne splash 
 Let that man get cash, let that man get past 
 You don't need to stop to get gas 
 If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes 
 Cause how he move in a room full of No's? 
 How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes? 
 Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul 
 So when he buried in a tomb full of gold 
 Treasure, what's you pleasure? 
 Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her 
 So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada 
 I'm in between, but way more fresher 
 But way less effort, 'cause when you try hard 
 That's when you die hard 
 Y'all homies lookin' like "Why God?" 
 When they reminisce over you, my God 
 La la la la 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 La la la la 
 Then you can't tell me nothing right? 
 Excuse me, is you saying something? 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 You can't tell me nothing 
 Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing 
 La la la la 
 Wait till I get my money right 
 La la la la 
 Then you can't tell me nothing right?
