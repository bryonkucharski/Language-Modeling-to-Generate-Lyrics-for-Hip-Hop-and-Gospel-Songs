I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy 
 All these girls excited 
 Oh ya know they like it 
 I'm so icy, so icy 
 Girl don't try to fight it 
 All yo friends invited 
 I'm so icy, so icy 
 Got a house around my neck, and my wrist on chill 
 Any given time, 250 in ya grill (a quarter million?) 
 All I do is talk shit, you can even add a couple grand for my outfit 
 You better act like ya know man, in my hood they call me Jeezy the Snowman 
 Ya get it? Get it? Jeezy the Snowman 
 I'm iced out, plus I got snow, man 
 Let it marinate, y'all niggas is slow man (slow man) 
 (Man what the fuck y'all, yo dumb ass) 
 I used to get nineteen for a beat 
 Call me Ginuwine, the same 'ol G ('ol G) 
 I'm the shit biatch, I need toilet paper (damn!) 
 And some air freshener nigga, fuck a hater 
 These niggas don't like me 
 I'm wit the Gucci Man and I'm so icy 
 She diggin' my fit, she think I'm the shit 
 Is this a chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist 
 Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet 
 But she look like the type that could take a dick 
 Young Gucci Man, don't kiss me baby you can kiss my chain 
 Ya gotta be a dime piece, 
 Just to look at the rocks in my time piece 
 I come through in a drop top Jag, or Old-School Chevy 
 Wit the antique tags 
 My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady 
 Niggas coppin' ice we done done it already 
 Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie 
 I ride big Chevy's cause a nigga ain't petty 
 I'm icy, so motherfuckin' snowed up, lil' kids want to 
 Be like Gucci when they grow up 
 Me, Jeezy and Boo 
 We ain't hatin' pussy nigga 'gon and do what you do 
 'Cause we icy, so icy, we icy, so icy 
 I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out 
 You can still see my chain even when the lights out 
 'Cause that's how monsters do it 
 Spit a lil game give 'em that flosser music 
 I'm the man from the C.H.I. 
 These lames runnin' 'round thinkin' they so fly 
 Got a lil' buzz but Boo been too high 
 I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try 
 I guess when she glance at my wrist, she want to get my dick 
 I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya want to pop Cris 
 Get at Gucci Man 'cause he on some lil' shit 
 And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my 4/5 
 Like let a nigga trip, naw we ain't runnin' 
 We just takin' all ya chicks, buyin' drinks gettin' blunted 
 Groupies, show you how to do this son 
 We throwin' out hundreds while you savin' them ones 
 I got so many rocks, on my chain and watch 
 I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
 I know I'm the bomb, just look at my charms 
 I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
 I'm so icy 
 Look at my charms 
 My, chain, hang, down, to my dick
