(Hook: Ne-Yo) 
 Yeah 
 She said you ain't no good but you feel so good 
 She said would if I could but I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 She said I know you bad, but I want you bad 
 She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone 
 I got my mind on my money 
 All I need's a bad bitch 
 That I can run through the city spend this cash with 
 That I can run through this city spend this cash on 
 Wake up in the morning get my smash on 
 I want more much baby egg whites 
 Keep your stomach in your thighs and your legs right 
 While I'm out here focus getting this bread right 
 But if the head right, Jeezy there every night 
 Wake up in the morning and I'm still here 
 Wake up in the morning and I ain't gone 
 All I ask, let me just do me 
 And maybe just me and you can get along 
 Had them other bitches mad when they seen us 
 Had to match our Rolex's baby team us 
 Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world 
 Maybe even go half on a baby girl 
 (Hook: Ne-Yo) 
 She said you ain't no good but you feel so good 
 She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 She said I know you bad, but I want you bad 
 She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind 
 And when I'm done with the front, hit it from behind 
 Love a loyalty never cross the line 
 Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind 
 Show you how to get you on you won't be watching mine 
 Put you up on G show you how to shine 
 And maybe we can kick it when I got the time 
 Be my backbone every nigga need a spine 
 Gotta know you ride with me if I'm right or wrong 
 Case I wake up in the morning and it's all gone 
 Best believe I'ma get it right back 
 That's the hustler in me I know you like that 
 You probably think I'm with a different broad every night 
 When I think about it shit man you're probably right 
 The more I think about it shit you're probably wrong 
 'Cause what you didn't think about is that I'm probably grown 
 (Hook: Ne-Yo) 
 She said you ain't no good but you feel so good 
 She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 She said I know you bad, but I want you bad 
 She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 (Verse 3: Ne-Yo) 
 She said she wish she never met me 
 'Cause she just can't help but let me go ahead 
 And do whatever the hell I want 
 She said she hate how much she need me 
 Turn around, and say she don't need me 
 Always talking about she gonna leave me 
 But she don't 
 But maybe this time I'll be different 
 'Cause she shed so many tears 
 She'll remind me all the dumb shit that I've done over the years 
 But she don't be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears 
 But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah 
 (Hook: Ne-Yo) 
 She said you ain't no good but you feel so good 
 She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone 
 She said I know you bad, but I want you bad 
 She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone 
 I gotta leave you alone
