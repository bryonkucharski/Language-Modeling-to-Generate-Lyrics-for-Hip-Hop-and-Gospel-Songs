See I'm a' start off so slow yeah I said so slow 
 They love me out in D.C. just like gogo 
 I said gogo yeah I said gogo 
 See them right with Don Cannon it's a gogo 
 See I want my song like Cocoa 
 I like to heat mine up like Cocoa 
 See dem 87 Jeans see the logo 
 Every time a day, count em' baby gogo 
 You know how the drop be everything slow 
 You know how the drop be anything goes 
 Remember back then when I got the snow low 
 And I was in and out of state just like Romo 
 Lookin' out for them boys no homo 
 Can't tell 'em what your drivin' that a no no 
 I'm gonna tell you this but keep it on the low low 
 If it's number 2 then we might be the popo 
 Things are gettin' higher 
 Makes it hard on the buyers 
 Sun is all around 
 Sun rise 
 Sun rise 
 Pushup till we grind 
 Rent bein' paid late
