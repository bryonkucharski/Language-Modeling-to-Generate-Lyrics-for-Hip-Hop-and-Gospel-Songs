Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history 
 Half to a whole over night this is victory 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 A hundred ballers in a club one time, that ain't shit to me 
 So tonight everything's on me, this is victory 
 They like god damn young, nigga where that album at? 
 Niggas talking like he fell off, just imagine that 
 Know anything about young he, ain't havin' that 
 Flip a 20 to 'nother 20 more he a acrobat 
 Think I came all this way so y'all can out a nigga 
 Took them road trips, whole thangs so y'all can doubt a nigga 
 Who you think count the money up, the rubber band clan 
 Put it in the chevy turtle tops and rubberband van 
 3 9's, one 4, two deuces that's a 36, 
 Show you niggas how to cash out, bought me 30 bricks 
 Counting in my man's apartment, in his living room 
 Paper all on the TV, need some living room 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history 
 Half to a whole over night this is victory 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Hundred ballers in a club one time, ain't shit to me 
 So tonight everything's on me, this is victory 
 Still trapper of the year, where the fuck my trophy at? 
 Ever was a real nigga title guess who holdin' that 
 Poppin' rose in the club, guess who toting that 
 Standing on the stage making rain, guess who showin' that 
 And they know we took nobody to the spot, half of milli there 
 Before I ever even seen the mike, was a millionaire 
 Seen Jizzle stuntin on Gangland, Diamonds in the chain, 
 If you look a little closer, Diamonds spell his name 
 Put the hundreds with the hundreds, yeah that's right straighten up the mail 
 Got enough shit in my head to send me straight to jail 
 Welcome to a day in the life, they just talking drugs 
 Co-sign half these niggas, I'm the fucking plug 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history 
 Half to a whole over night this is victory 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Win win, win win, win win, win win, win 
 Hundred ballers in a club one time, ain't shit to me 
 So tonight everything's on me, this is victory
