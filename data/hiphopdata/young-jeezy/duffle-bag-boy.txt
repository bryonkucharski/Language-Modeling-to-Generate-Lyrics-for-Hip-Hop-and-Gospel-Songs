If I don't nothin' I'm a ball 
 I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall 
 Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy 
 Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money 
 And I ain't ever ran from a nigga and I 
 Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' 
 Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I 
 Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' get money 
 The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold 
 Walkin' to the Gucci store honey I'm home 
 I am on my shit I need a pamper on me 
 Toilet paper on the side for example homie 
 I, get, money 
 I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and 
 While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car 
 Smoking out with the doors ajar 
 Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top 
 We leave the dealership head to the rim shop 
 You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling 
 That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island 
 Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money it's my i.d 
 Don't try me and if I don't do nothin' I'm a fuckin' ball 
 And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw 
 Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us 
 We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us 
 Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game 
 Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane 
 Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough 
 Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough 
 Need a hoe break a hoe never nothin' new to us 
 Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us 
 Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up 
 Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up 
 Flows like a river the current is so rapid 
 Hit with the ratchet that's how shit happens 
 Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk 
 Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front 
 Southside I got what you want come holla at me
