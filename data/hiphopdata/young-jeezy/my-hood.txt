(Chorus) (Repeat 2x) 
 Every time I do it I do it for my hood 
 And every time I do it I do it for yo hood 
 And every time I do it I do it for they hood 
 It's understood I do it for the hood 
 The streets love jeezy and I love 'em back 
 If I still had the work I getcha sack 
 It's all gravy still reaching wit my words 
 And make 'em feel good on the first and the third 
 Take you back when I was sixteen wit a bankroll 
 Posted on a corner like a light pole 
 They used to call us trap stars 
 Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars 
 And everybody on the block got the same agenda 
 Hustle from the beginning of January till the end of December 
 Wasn't smokin' purple then it was more like bobby brown 
 On that hen dog got a nigga straight drinkin' brown (7/11 nigga you know) 
 You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go 
 Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch 
 Why the fuck you think they love me so much? (ha ha!) 
 I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights 
 It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night (bow) 
 Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run 
 White boys jump out pointing wit they guns 
 Ford Taurus leave everybody came back (hey) 
 Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack 
 Real recognize real I suppose 
 I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows 
 Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes 
 Still catch me in the jects fuckin' wit dem hoes (projects!) 
 Like coo-coo cal 
 Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now 
 Wish gold mouth was there wish mailman was free 
 A lot of niggaz crossing over dog no not me 
 Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV 
 And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully (hey) 
 Ford Taurus pull up everybody run 
 White boys jump out pointing wit they guns 
 Ford Taurus leave everybody came back (hey) 
 Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
