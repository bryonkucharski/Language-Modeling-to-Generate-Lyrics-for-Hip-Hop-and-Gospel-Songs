(Young Jeezy - Hook) 
 What you know about champagne every night 
 Bad bitches everywhere, Barry White 
 Hit the things, I could bury white 
 Countin' up a million dollars every night 
 Hit the mall blow up 
 Kinda hard when you're sleeping on Dolce 
 Wake up drinkin' Rose 
 Killin' that white bitch, OJ 
 (Young Jeezy - Verse 1) 
 Smokin' that exotic, riding that foreign 
 Million dollar round trip, I ain't talkin' bout touring 
 Yeah, countin' money till ya boring 
 Man fuck that shit (jizzle where you goin'?) 
 Flat screens on the walls, nigga iMacs 
 Michael Turners on decks, nigga half backs 
 Dirty white bitch, yeah that kat stacks 
 We don't sleep round here, we take cat naps 
 Wesley Snipes, mothafucka it's the money train 
 Swear the work came faster than the money came 
 Sometimes the money be faster than the cars is 
 Feds ain't watching and then them broads is 
 Could end anyday and you know better 
 Now you watch the frito lay, yeah you know cheddar 
 Double bags at the spot, luggage in the place 
 Louie V on deck, luggage on my waist 
 (Young Jeezy - Hook) 
 (Fabolous - Verse 2) 
 I woke up sayin' I ain't drinking no more 
 Same night in the spot drinkin' Coco 
 Loso, bad bitch think she know so 
 Got a man cuffin', nigga think he popo 
 She tryna go below the belt, thinkin' low blow 
 I'm thinking oh yeah, he thinkin' oh no 
 I'm on my high horse, thinking Polo 
 Got the 9 on me so I think I'm Romo 
 Uh, I'm about that life 
 Bring you in the game, let you meet my wife 
 Married to the, asking am I gettin' cheddar now 
 They say I do, like a wedding vow 
 That AirTran we flying for cheap 
 And you niggas sleepin' on me, hope you die in your sleep 
 OJ, yeah probably don't get it 
 I'm the best that ever did it and got away with it 
 (Jadakiss - Verse 3) 
 Italian money and everything with 'em 
 Gloves don't fit 'em so they gotta acquit him 
 Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody heard it 
 The whole town hatin', they waitin' on a verdict 
 Tell 'em niggas pop off, I'm waitin on a drop off 
 I ain't leaving the block till I knock the box off 
 Yeah taking care of the whole fam 
 Bought the Porsche gave the M to my old man 
 More money more problems 
 More grams, more real estate, more land 
 At fight night I be ringside 
 I let them things fly, just put 1.5 under my kingsize 
 I look at the world through a kings eyes 
 I was born to spit bars and sling pies 
 I ain't wealthy yet but I'm quite rich 
 I just gotta keep killin' that white bitch
