Turn Up (MikeWill made it) 
 We gon' always get money man 
 Young Jeezy, Big Sean, Juicy J 
 Boss shit nigga, let's get it 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out 
 Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring that flow out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Trippy niggas and a few hoes 
 One night, two shows 
 That's two mansions and a team expansion 
 Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin' and pantin' 
 When you getting money chicks come around 
 Niggas start hatin' who's holdin' you down 
 All this ice I'm just livin' the life 
 Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice 
 Hit club LIV in a rush 
 Pockets so swole I think they finna bust 
 Ace in my hand and a .45 tuck 
 Money coming down codeine pourin' up 
 Smokin' on some dope, always on a float 
 20 years in niggas callin' me the G.O.A.T 
 Money adding up you haters going broke 
 Still in the game while you niggas ridin' old 
 See me showin' out they muggin, I don't give a fuck 
 How I start my morning off, a zip and a double cup 
 Hating ass niggas, y'all behind me 
 Ball so hard they want to fine me 
 Juicy J, Taylor Gang

 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out 
 Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring that flow out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 All these ratchets hoes say I ain't shit 
 Well, at least I ain't broke ho 
 Stackin' paper like old folks 
 And you still stayin' with your old folks 
 She a fan, that's fantastic, poppin' zany's, that's zantastic 
 Gettin' rich, band-tastic, white girls like Anne Hatha- 
 Way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon 
 She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana 
 Ooh (Freaky) that's just how I move 
 Fast girls, fast money, no more fast food 
 Came up first class, my passport gettin' tattooed (boi) 
 Young ass playa doing everything that I have to 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out 
 Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring that flow out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out 
 Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out

 She say how many bottles do you want, I told her 50 
 She say anything else? Yeah bitch a kidney 
 Every time I go out, you know I bring that dough out 
 Finesse is on a milli, it lookin' like a blowout 
 100 bitches with me, look like I left the whore house 
 100 racks with me, look like I left the blow house 
 Now we poppin' bottles, they came with the sparkles 
 Got my niggas with me, they came with them yoppers
