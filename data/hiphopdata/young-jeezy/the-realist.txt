(Young Jeezy: Talking) 
 Ride on these niggaz 
 I ride on these niggaz 
 I ride on these niggaz (hahaaa) 
 I ride on these niggaz 
 Let's get it! 
 (Verse 1: Young Jeezy) 
 Super charger, the same color as PJ 
 (Yeah) I got a champagne range 
 Big niggaz offed, I got a night-scope aim (Bah) 
 Audio, video, you caught on tape 
 That's a way to get ya ass sent Upstate (dayyyum) 
 In '9-AY! I took them trips down to Lauderdale 
 Back and forth, like Aliyah 
 Chances of gettin' rich is like one-in-a-million 
 (Hahaaaaa) Or more like two-in-a-billion 
 Flashin' lights, my mind's playin' tricks on me 
 But the Minuteman still do tricks on me 
 Swear the feds just starin' at a nigga 
 You know, you feelin' ya heart fall into ya feet 
 Summertime niggaz still ridin' with the heat 
 Jeezy De Niro, Snowman Pacino 
 Real niggaz love me because I talk that lingo 
 (Hook: Young Jeezy) 
 And I'm the muhf**kin' realest... 
 They lies, they phonies, they fakes, 
 These niggaz ain't never sold the weight 
 And I'm the muhf**kin' realest... 
 They lies, they phonies, they fakes, 
 These niggaz ain't never sold the weight 
 And I'm the muhf**kin' realest... 
 They lies, they phonies, they fakes, 
 These niggaz ain't never touched the weight 
 And I'm the muhf**kin' realest... 
 They lies, they phonies, they fakes, 
 These niggaz ain't never touched the weight 
 And I'm the muhf**kin' realest... 
 (Verse 2: Young Jeezy) 
 Nowadayz the GT's glock black (cheaaa!) 
 The shoes on that muhf**ka 3-80 chrome 
 Gotta be careful what you say on the phone 
 I'm 36 souls away 
 From givin' the mic up and goin' back to the streetz (naww) 
 What's the difference, I still eat the same 
 A nigga paranoid, I still sleep the same 
 You niggaz rappin' 'bout blow, like it's a fad 
 Nigga this is my life, I ain't tryna set trends 
 'Cause everybody knows how that brick-road ends 
 Heartless, maybe I need to see the Wizard 
 Until then, Imma make it snow blizzards 
 (Verse 3: Young Jeezy) 
 I stay on the block, and risk my life 
 Day in and day out until a nigga sold out 
 You niggaz playin', I show you what that street shit 'bout 
 Hit you right up with them thangs, and come back with the chains 
 Might cook it in the stove, might cook it in the microwave 
 Either way it's gonna sell, still weigh it on the scale 
 You rappin'-ass niggaz ain't never sold no yams 
 I'm talkin' sucka-free Sundays and iced-out Mondays 
 Pin-up Tuesdays and body-tap Wednesdays 
 You was in the studio, I was on the block 
 In the kitchen at the spot goin' hard with the blocks 
 25 for the four ways, choppaz by the door-ways
