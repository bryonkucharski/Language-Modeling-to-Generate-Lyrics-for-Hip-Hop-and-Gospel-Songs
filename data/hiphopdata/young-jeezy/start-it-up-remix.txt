(Young Jeezy) 
 I'm just chillin' in that Phantom bumpin that Yo Gotti 
 He's the boss of the town, call him young John Gotti 
 Sittin' down with the plug, bout to order up some taco's 
 Talkin' velveeta hella chips, nachos 
 And you really gettin' money, say cheese in this muthafucka 
 Bitches on your dog like fleas in this muthafucka 
 So many chains might freeze in this muthafucker 
 Walked past a bitch like breeze in this muthafucka 
 Black and gold stones, Drew Brees in this muthafucka 
 Don't make me start talking quarter keys in this muthafucker 
 Shell cases, night vision, ain't nothing stupider 
 Clips filled up, outta space, Jupiter 
 Don't make me start it up like a new Kawasaki 
 Drop me, hit ya in ya face, you'll be chicken teriyaki 
 While I'm on that new thug passion, that Belvedere and Saki 
 Chopping bricks with some chop sticks, I told you I got this 
 You know they mad cause cause 'cause I'm hood rich 
 You ain't never ever seen good trick 
 You want a problem, 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Wait a minute

 (Lloyd Banks) 
 I'm who they be, Chronic by the P, living comfortably 
 Come with me, round and some would see why they fuck with me 
 Bentley's pulling up in three, multi-coloured fleet 
 Y'all sour me, my summers sweet 
 Kiss my mother feet 
 Hate just makes chop 'em as they creek 
 Life forever sweet 
 Life's a gamble and I play for keeps in these streets 
 Magnificant flow or magnifique 
 Rookie have a seat 
 Them lil niggas just my parakeets 
 Macking masterpiece 
 My life is good, my bitches bad 
 I'm switching pads, changing watches in my christmas bag 
 I got the gift of gab, talked my way in and took some ass 
 Whips and cash, come through half stepping and then get whipped in half 
 Southsides my heart, too hard to forget the past 
 Lost too many niggas (?) keep the liquor stashed 
 My flows off the ropes, uppercuts, stick to jabs 
 Shorty wanna grab, catch a couple nuts, hit the cab 
 You know they mad cause cause 'cause I'm hood rich 
 You ain't never ever seen good trick 
 You want a problem, 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Wait a minute

 (Kanye West) 
 We keep these G's in an alloy safe 
 And stash the weed in an altoids case 
 They say good things come to those who wait 
 So I'm gon be at least an hour late 
 I'm so fresh I should be arrested 
 New Tody Chester with my nuts on your chest b-tch 
 She said "hey 'Ye" 
 I said "Yes B-tch" 
 Damn I'm only asking you a question 
 I met this milf at the allstar getting action 
 A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson 
 Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs 
 And her booty is why God invented my balls 
 I'm a rockstar, huh, start it up 
 Start it up, huh, start it up 
 So popular you should get a shot of us 
 Niggas gon take shots at us that is only obvious 
 The first album I vomited, the second I colonic'd it 
 Ain't nobody f-cking with me, I plutonic'd it 
 Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon honor it 
 These ain't even real clothes homie I'm pajama rich 
 Banks told me homie go switch the style up 
 These b-tches on me homie only to arouse us 
 Told her I ain't paying tonight I'm only browsing 
 She pulled her blouse up, said "it's free", I said WOWZER! 
 You know they mad cause cause 'cause I'm hood rich 
 You ain't never ever seen good trick 
 You want a problem, 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Wait a minute

 (Ryan Leslie) 
 Let's get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah 
 Ladies and gentleman 
 (Fabolous) 
 Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate 
 Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate! 
 Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait 
 Where's da dinner plates? 
 BMW, ten to 8, interstate 95, passenger 
 Baddest b-tch in the states, half Spanish half trinidad 
 Complexion Henny straight 
 Y'all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state 
 Time is money and I can't afford to be a minute late 
 It's time to make a movie let the haters watch 
 Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch 
 My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch 
 She got an appetite for d-ck, I guess I place my crotch 
 That soft as tater top, long, try me not 
 Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot 
 I hear 'em talking it but they ain't really living it 
 Opinions are like assholes so who gives a sh-t 
 You know they mad cause cause 'cause I'm hood rich 
 You ain't never ever seen good trick 
 You want a problem, 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Start it up (vroom vroom) 
 Wait a minute
