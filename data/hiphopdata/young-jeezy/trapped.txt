 Yo, they still be grindin', and runnin' 
 Tryin' to get into somethin' or nothin' 
 I remember them days, when the block got hot, bullets flyin' for the what 
 It was, like, you ain't, really give a fuck 
 I'm a sister, mother, I'm your daughter, I'm your lover and I'm 
 Right here, and I'm sayin' that it's wack sauce 
 Everything that you do tryna be the boss 
 You ain't really really doin' it, (nah) 
 I mean honestly pursuin' it 
 Ca-cause, if you did you wouldn't be murdering, (your own people like) 
 Oh ya see, it's a trap, (it's a trap, that's what it's called by the way)
