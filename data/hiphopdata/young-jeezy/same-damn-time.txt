Y'all don't wanna play fair 
 Know what I mean 
 Aye, yeah 
 I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time 
 On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time 
 Selling white selling mid at the same damn time 
 Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time 
 At the same damn time, at the same damn time 
 At the same damn time, at the same damn time 
 I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time 
 On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time 
 Gucci made in Italy Bally belt I'm killing shit 
 The way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo tha word got out I'm dealing it 
 I fuck her she a immigrant don't touch her she ain't got benefits 
 Bussing down them Benjamin's fuck it up my Louie kicks 
 Dats tha way I'm kicking it Ferragamo cover me 
 Puerto Rican Japanese we laid up at the double tree 
 Yellow ice a bumble bee pinky ring a quarter key 
 IPhone a metro twerking off tha whole thing 
 My earring a jelly bean gangsta lean an Irene 
 Red eyes no visine I'm loc'd out on tha drink 
 Horseshoes on my jeans Robin jeans wit tha Wings 
 Yellow bone on my team trafficking them Yao Mings 
 Space boots wit tha spikes go to AZ on a flight 
 Mail a hundred overnight, yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Pps with the sack going crazy 
 Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazay 
 Bad bitches in the suite tryna to bathe me 
 Just a young hood nigga streets raised me 
 Working wit a unit tryna stretch it to another one 
 Drinking on that active and it's tasting like some bubble gum 
 Thumbing through a check born on a jet 
 Talking on the iPhone sipping out tha styrofoam 
 That dirty got my mind gone that money got my mind blown 
 VVS and white stones VVS and white stones 
 I'm rolling like a rolling stone 
 Free Bandz and Al Capone 
 And my cash way long (turn up) 
 I see a bunch of clones 
 Give me apartment and some water and I can swim 
 Got that Gambino jumping out the gym 
 My young nigga serving J's that's how I clear 'em 
 Jumping cross me you know your chances slim 
 In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes 
 When I cash that cash money smell like cocaine 
 Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan 
 Walk inside the jeweler drop my bail on your ring 
 Spent so much in Louis gave me free champagne 
 In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing 
 And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp 
 I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a clip 
 Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie, Future, Astronaut)
