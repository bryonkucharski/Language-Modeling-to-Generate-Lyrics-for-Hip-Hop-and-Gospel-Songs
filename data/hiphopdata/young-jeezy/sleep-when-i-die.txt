Let's get on this Rose 
 72 hours straight 
 Do it like Alpo did it back in 88 
 Step up in this bitch in an MCM suit 
 38 snub in my MCM boots 
 Young what you smoking on 
 I call it 6 c-notes 
 Got it on the westside, cost me 6 c-notes 
 Nigga sold it to me so hot call him heatstroke 
 Poured all the powder on the table make a ski slope 
 You looking at me young rich porter and some raybans 
 Bitch I'm finna blow the money trial, this my rain dance 
 I'ma have my name ringing so loud it wake the feds up 
 Tell the DA we on our way, make the beds up 
 I ain't trippin' on shit man I sleep when I get down 
 Young your going out tomorrow night, I'm like shit yeah 
 Every night the club be open bitch we in there 
 Tell 'em all the bottles on me, I broke brick for it 
 I'ma sleep when I die 
 Sleep, sleep when I die 
 Sleep when I die 
 Sleep, sleep when I die 
 I got vodka in my left, champagne in my right 
 But I do it real big, this could be my last night 
 I'ma sleep when I die 
 Sleep, sleep when I die 
 Sleep when I die 
 Sleep, sleep when I die 
 I'm gon tell y'all something right now I'm too high 
 My name is Snowman bitch I'ma sleep when I die 
 We count money all day, why you think my hands hurt 
 Know I can't serve a nigga that, that my man's work 
 You ain't a four wall on hold that's a kitkat 
 Another nigga want a heinekin that's a six pack 
 Cocaine cowboys business now horses 
 And every now you might catch us in some Porsche's 
 And sellin that soft shit as white as air forces 
 And got that rap button nigga ain't she gorgeous 
 Fall up in the spot, poppin' bottles like [?] 
 PJ [?] bitch don't bring me no Cristal 
 Veuve Clicquot Champagne like we won the World Cup 
 Pull up in that champagne thing, fuck the World up 
 What type of hood nigga wearing yellow gold rolex 
 The weight man bitch the whole hood call me Bo flex 
 Either the yellow hand Lamb or the starburst 'rari 
 I'm doing too much for you niggas I'm sorry 
 Just roll the ball till them folks come get ya 
 But you gotta spend it all 'cause you can't take it with ya 
 Just roll the ball till them folks come get ya 
 Yeah I see them boys watching, tell them niggas take a picture 
 Just roll the ball till them folks come get ya 
 But you gotta do it big 
 So when you gone the streets miss ya 
 Just roll the ball till them folks come get ya 
 I ain't never gon sleep 'cause I'm trying to get richer
