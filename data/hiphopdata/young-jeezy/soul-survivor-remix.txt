Convict 
 Akon, DAD and Young Jeezy 
 Tryin' to take it easy 
 Only way to go 
 And So... 
 (Chorus (Akon):) 
 If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block 
 With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now) 
 Cause I'm a rida (Yeah) 
 Ooh yes a Soul Survivor 
 Cause er'body know the game don't stop 
 Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped (Now) 
 If you a rida (Yeah) 
 Ooh YES a Soul Survivor 
 (Verse 1 (Young Jeezy):) 
 (Let's get it) At night I can't sleep--we livin' in Hell (Yeah) 
 First they, give us the work then they throw us in jail (Ay) 
 Won't trip yeah--I'm trafficking in the white 
 Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah) 
 Who Me?? I'm a Soul Survivor 
 Ask about 'em in the street, the boy Jeez a rida (Jeez a rida) 
 A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah life sucks (Ha Ha) 
 Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ay) 
 (Chorus (Akon):) 
 If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block 
 With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now) 
 Cause I'm a rida (Yeah) 
 Oh yes a Soul Survivor 
 Cause er'body know the game don't stop 
 Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped (Now) 
 If you a rida (Yeah)

 (Verse 2 (Young Jeezy):) 
 Another day, another dolla (dolla)-same block, same nigga, same part, same green 
 I guess we got the same dreams (Ay) 
 Or is it the same nightmares (nightmares) 
 We let the doves do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right) 
 Real niggaz don't budge 
 When Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah) 
 I'm knee deep in the game 
 So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the cane (Damn) 
 Real talk, Look, I'm tellin' you mayne (tellin' you mayne) 
 If you get jammed up don't mention my name 
 Forgive me Lord--I know I ain't livin' right 
 Gotta feed the block, niggaz starvin', they got appitites (Ay) 
 And this is er'day, it never gets old (Old) 
 Thought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code (ch'Yeah) 
 This ain't a rap song, nigga this is my life (this is my life) 
 And if the hood was a battlefield then I earned stripes (Yeah) 
 (Chorus (Akon):) 
 If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block 
 With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now) 
 Cause I'm a rida (Yeah) 
 Oh yes a Soul Survivor 
 Cause er'body know the game don't stop 
 Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped (Now) 
 If you a rida (Yeah)

 (Verse 3 (Young Jeezy):) 
 Gotta watch er' move 
 cause them eyes be on you (eyes be on you) 
 Gotta dry real cool when them pies be on you (pies be on you) 
 Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous) 
 Them alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ay) 
 (Like animals) They lock us in cages 
 The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages 
 I ain't cheat--played the hand I was dealt 
 Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself 
 (Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory) 
 My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah) 
 Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try) 
 Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay) 
 (Verse 4 (DAD):) 
 I woke up didn't know what was happenin' 
 People on me started to hit and wappin 
 Me on the back of my head 
 They hit me so much, so much felt like I was dead 
 It felt like that without first aid care 
 Because they attacked me at my bed in my underwear 
 Now for a minute I was out at the operating room 
 I saw a bright light so I went fast and zoom 
 I wasn't scared, The place I was there 
 At the place that everybody was aware 
 Of I came back on the operating table 
 I had a TV but I was sleepin' so I didn't watch cable 
 Because I was busy survivin 
 3,2,1 CLEAR! I went risin' 
 (Bridge (Akon):) 
 Cause if you lookin' for me you can find me 
 On the block disobeyin' the law 
 Real G--thoroughbred from the streets 
 Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws 
 Just to keep on movin' out 
 Just to keep on movin' out 
 Just to keep on movin' out 
 Just to keep on movin' out 
 (Chorus (Akon) 2x:) 
 If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block 
 With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now) 
 Cause I'm a rida (Yeah) 
 O yes a Soul Survivor 
 Cause er'body know the game don't stop 
 Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped (Now) 
 If you a rida (Yeah) 
 O yes a Soul Survivor
