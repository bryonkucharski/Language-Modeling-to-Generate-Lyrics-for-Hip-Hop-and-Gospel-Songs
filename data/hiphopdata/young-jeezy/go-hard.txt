Go hard or go home [x16] 
 As I get comfy on the track 
 Rather fuck wit raw wouldn't comfy wit the crack 
 Yeah, never clumsy wit the pack 
 That's prolly why a nigga so clumsy wit the stacks 
 Yeah, so clumsy wit them racks 
 Though I aim anywhere so clumsy wit the straps 
 Half a life sentence a half on my lap 
 Plus I got half of the task on my back 
 They ain't got nuttin but time, the fuck is that 
 I'd rather be in jail then broke, this shit is wack 
 Jizzle only word for ya dog, this shit is crack 
 Use to hide 'em up in my crib, the real is back 
 Peel the top off the pot jus like a lobster 
 Off white substance side 'n' it ain't pasta 
 Damn right he know what he doin' look at his posture 
 Man we jus happy we back nigga I got ya 
 What you got in ya trunk sound like an opra 
 Way you stay stuntin on niggas deserves an Oscar 
 Yo I smoke all day jus like a rosta 
 And you know its M.O.B. live like a mobster 
 Tell me how them project niggas live like the doctors 
 Studied them projects niggas we got our doctorates 
 Yeah the streets write a book I be the author 
 Think I'll call it SLP stunt like my patnas 
 Dear lord heavenly father please forgive me 
 Can't turn back on 'em now these niggas feel me 
 Never dream of lettin 'em down that shit'll kill me 
 First year the money was dirty but now it's filthy 
 Dear heavenly father you know the real me 
 The use to hide it in the attic half a mill me 
 The use to get it in before the deal me 
 Now niggas actin' like I owe 'em tell 'em bill me 
 Back up on our grind we put the worst behind us 
 No direct eye contact he might blind us 
 Risk it all everyday of the week so don't remind us 
 Street niggas we be in the streets that's where ya find us
