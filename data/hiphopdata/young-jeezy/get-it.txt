(Swizz Beats) 
 The kings back 
 I got that get it get it 
 I got that get it what you need 
 From soft parts to trees got that get it what you need 
 I got that get it 
 I got that get it what you need 
 From dope boyz and bitches who love that road 
 Come and get it hey 'cause I got it bitch 
 Tell and get you know I got It bitch 
 I got my broads if you want em 
 On the C.O.D please 5 G's 
 I don't promise but I got good numbers 
 Tote 2 thunder, sat that lumber 
 Got that guacamole holy moly you don't know me 
 See me clean as I wanna be, what these niggas wanna be 
 Shots so bright I can't see niggas standing right in front of me 
 These niggas don't want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me 
 What I look like beefing wit you nigga yousa son to me 
 Move weight out to Georgia get it cross the water 
 Rive that shit to New York coming all the way from Florida 
 Dope boy trap nigga that's what they call em 
 Summer time balla when I buy the mall up 
 Mighta seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low 
 Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting for 
 Shawty ain't bullshitin' folk he'll be out be here hitting folks 
 Stick around and try to tell polices what he did it for 
 Ain't nothing he ain't did before other niggas getting so 
 Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so 
 Long he ain't funny he got that long money 
 No money you niggas barely got hit the mall money 
 I'm the perfect example of how to hit the ground running 
 From the trap to busting up how the underground stunting 
 So you still see me down at the underground stunting 
 I'ma Westside Bankhead nigga it ain't nothing 
 I was raised off Easy, Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, Face, Pimp C 
 I'ma king just believe me, try me when you see me 
 And niggas start busting like they start busting pushups push a 
 Button shot calling niggas not balling 
 Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and not dogging 
 I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans 
 Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all that 
 You niggas better fall back, boy grab a ball bat 
 Take it to ya skull, that's gone be the end of all that 
 Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve that 
 Hit 'em in the temple then I leave 'em where they fall at
