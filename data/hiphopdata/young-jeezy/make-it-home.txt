I don't always do what I should 
 But I do what I gotta do 
 You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you 
 Don't say what you won't do 
 'Cause it can all change 
 When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane 
 See I done dodged a couple shots 
 Served a couple blocks 
 Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops 
 A broke a couple rules 
 Didn't graduate from school 
 'Cause I was busy hustling, man, I thought that shit was cool 
 See I gotta keep it real with you baby 
 'Cause the shit I used to do is what made me 
 And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap 
 'Cause we really know that we don't want that 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Tell my mama that I love her 
 Leave some flowers for my brother 
 Girl I love ya 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Take some money to my sister 
 I don't ever want her chasin after niggas 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 Niggas outchea dyin' every day 
 And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way 
 And I ain't no different 
 So if I get missin' 
 These are my last wishes 
 I hope you get them right 
 Girl if I don't make it home tonight 
 I know it's harsh 
 But this is how I feel, girl it's comin' from the heart 
 I hope it doesn't end the way it had to start 
 'Cause it started out bad but I made it this far 
 But everyone here ain't trynna see me make it 
 Or they only wanna see me win so they can take it 
 'Cause I know it's hard to find a job 
 So niggas kill and rob 
 There's a chance that I won't make it here tomorrow 
 Being honest 
 See I gotta keep it real with you baby 
 'Cause the shit I used to do is what made me 
 And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap 
 'Cause we really know that we don't want that 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Tell my mama that I love her 
 Leave some flowers for my brother 
 Girl I love ya 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Take some money to my sister 
 I don't ever want her chasin after niggas 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 Niggas outchea dyin' every day 
 And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way 
 And I ain't no different 
 So if I get missin' 
 These are my last wishes 
 I hope you get them right 
 Girl if I don't make it home tonight 
 Would you miss me? Would you miss me? 
 Would you walk up to my casket? Would you kiss me? 
 My life is schizophrenic, I'm just tryna stay sane 
 Pour a cup full, hope it take away the pain 
 I said you know I I I I 
 Came from the projects, nigga 
 Don't care if it kill me, I die, I'll stay in the projects 
 You know I'm fresh as a motherfucker, in case that I die tonight 
 Got a lot on my mind, you know that I'm high tonight 
 I left that black Hublot at home 
 So really I don't got the time 
 My nigga got by a quarter, heard that he dropped the dime 
 Failure's no option nigga, you out of yo fuckin' mind 
 Mixin my life and my freedom fool 
 So ain't none of you stopping my... 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Tell my mama that I love her 
 Leave some flowers for my brother 
 Girl I love ya 
 But if I don't make it home tonight 
 Take some money to my sister 
 I don't ever want her chasin after niggas 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 Niggas outchea dyin' every day 
 And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way 
 And I ain't no different
