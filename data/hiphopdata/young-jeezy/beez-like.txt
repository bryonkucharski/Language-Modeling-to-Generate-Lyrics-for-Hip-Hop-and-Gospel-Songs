Time for the fallen soldiers 
 Can't have a war without casualties, you know? 
 For everybody goin' through the struggle, you know 
 Real shit everyday, everyday shit is real 
 (Every hood, every ghetto, every block, every trench) 
 I know how you feel, yeah, look 
 I been out here grindin' so long 
 But still I had to find my way on my own 
 I could tell you what it beez like 
 I could tell you what it beez like 
 I'm a true hustler, all that I know 
 So I can make it anywhere that I go 
 I could tell you what it beez like 
 I could tell you what it beez like-like, beez like 
 Straight from the hood, got a get money fetish 
 Pocket full of green, nigga, like a head of lettuce 
 Put the work in a bag, make a yayo sandwich 
 Then we go and spread it through the hood like Manwich 
 One thing about it, we gon' get this bread 
 When you knew shit was real? When they found a rat dead 
 Right around the corner where us young niggas hustled at 
 Right by the stop sign, that's where they was bussin' at 
 When you come here with nothin', gotta learn how to provide 
 Carlo had a Benz 'fore he was old enough to drive 
 Losin' 10, 20 every night, gamblin' ain't nothin' 
 And ya nigga got killed takin' up for his cousins 
 When you knew shit was real? Drop outfit in the feds 
 Still 8 years and a nigga shot him dead 
 On the humbug, left him slumped in his car 
 Everybody got a day, don't matter who you are 
 Stove water, heat cold water 
 Knew I'd touch a bird when I got my first quarter 
 Sell water to a well, nigga 
 Cold nights, cold hearts, tough love, that's what it be like in jail, nigga 
 Mama crying at my visit 'cause she care for me 
 Daughter just had her period, ain't there for her 
 Know how to have a girl you know just gon' hold ya back 
 But the pussy so good you keep goin' back 
 Hurt when ya main man turned rat 
 Make the whole la familia turn hot like that 
 Any city, any block, any boulevard 
 I survive, no lie, I'm a ghetto boy 
 I could tell ya 'bout the dos and don'ts 
 I make it anywhere I go, so lose I won't 
 I can tell ya 'bout the hard time when ya really need it 
 Been grindin' so long, still had to call Jeezy 
 Straight from the bottom, tryna make it to the top 
 What the gov'meant don't give you, gotta get it from the block 
 Feel like a bad boy cause this shit don't stop 
 Street so dirty, need a muhfuckin' mop, uh oh! 
 Lil homie, stay focused, handle ya business 
 Don't talk to them niggas around you, might be a witness 
 Don't tell the dishwasher what you did wit' ya dishes 
 Don't tell these snitchin' niggas what you did wit' ya riches 
 Niggas is hopin' they see Christmas 
 But, if we just happen to don't, we hope you miss us 
 Santa raised all seven them kids, didn't miss a meal 
 She work them fingers right to the bone, didn't miss a bill 
 Niggas (?), let's make a deal 
 See, one thing bout countin' this money, it make ya feel 
 See, I used to get 'em right from the source, got 'em direct 
 The same nigga that had a connect, he in the set
