 I need a doctor, I got a sick wrist game 
 Hit the blunt twice, then I switch lanes 
 I'm ridin' on some grown men 
 What you wanna play, let the games begin 
 On the count of three, here we go 
 I don't talk fast, y'all just listen slow 
 They need glasses, they ain't seein' me 
 Stevie Wonder, ass niggers ain't seein' me 
 Four X, white tee and a wife beata 
 Got my Desert Eagle, call it senorita 
 Got a way with words, paint a picture man 
 I don't smoke phillies, I'ma swisher man 
 Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em

 Catch me in Walter's, spendin' grands, man 
 When I leave they got to help me tote my bags, man 
 Jeezy poppin' tags, you better make way 
 Drought a vouch for me, ask Kumate 
 And I don't think they heard me 
 Ain't no nigger in the league got more jerseys 
 No matter the price 
 I can wear one every day for the rest of my life 
 I ain't gon' lie, I got a lot of paper 
 So when I'm out shinin', I see a lot of hata's 
 I'm rich, bitch, I can't help but brag 
 More G's then a Gucci bag 
 Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em 
 Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em

 Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man 
 I listen to it, now it's in the trash can 
 Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man 
 I listen to it, now it's in the trash can 
 Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man 
 I listen to it, now it's in the trash can 
 Think Jeezy a liar 
 Spit the straight drop, nigger set the city on fire 
 Call the firemen 
 All you fake rap niggers better retire man 
 Real recognize, real nigger 
 Sell a lot of chickens, call me Popeye's 
 You tryin' too hard, I make it look easy 
 And all that cheap ass jewelry got ya lookin' cheesy 
 Don't make me laugh 
 See this shit around my neck, it cost a brick and a half
