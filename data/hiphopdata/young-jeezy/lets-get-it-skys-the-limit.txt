Tryin' to get Bosey George and Diego money 
 And stack it all up like Lego money 
 Played with them blocks call it Tetris 
 Real talk a hundred carats in my necklace 
 Look up in the sky and tell me what you see 
 The clouds naw nigga not me 
 I see opportunity I'm a opportunist 
 Nigga you heard what I said I'm a opportunist 
 Soft to hard white to green 
 All these free agents you better build your team 
 I come to take the game like John Madden 
 'Cause I played in the game like John Madden 
 The world is yours and everything in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah" 
 The world is yours and every bitch in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah" 
 You can do anything you put your mind to, put your grind to 
 Forgetful ass nigga must I remind you 
 Men do what the want boys do what they can 
 And it ain't no secret I'm a grown ass man 
 With my hands on the bible and I solemnly swear 
 Leave the mall with more shoes than I can possibly wear 
 Niggas still hatin' but they can kiss my ass 
 Still get a hard on when I count that cash 
 I give 'em the squares he give me the bag 
 I give 'em the squares he give me the cash 
 And that's what the fuck a call an even exchange 
 And if there's anything extra you can keep the change 
 The world is yours and everything in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah" 
 The world is yours and every bitch in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah" 
 Grind sundown till it comes up again 
 Stay down till we come up again 
 It's all in the game the ups the downs 
 It's all in the game the O's the pounds 
 The shit was all good just a week ago 
 Whole click was eatin good just a week ago 
 It's all good nigga give us a month 
 Thinking of a master plan while I smoke this blunt 
 Went to Houston and back now everybody got coupes 
 Put the word in the street that supply the troops 
 I just call 'em how I see em, 
 Serve these niggas third person dog I ain't tryin' to see em 
 The world is yours and everything in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah" 
 The world is yours and every bitch in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah" 
 The world is yours and everything in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah" 
 The world is yours and every bitch in it 
 Its out there get on your grind and get it "ay" 
 Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah"
