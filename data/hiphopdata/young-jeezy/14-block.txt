I remember being posted up on the 1st and the 3rd 
 Just re'd up, nigga got a 9 piece 
 All the while fantasizing, visualizing, comin' through in a Benz 
 With a dimepiece 
 Audemar what that time piece say 
 Audemar what that time piece say 
 Know it ain't shit, swing by the Federal boot camp 
 Shit, whip it like it's cream brulee 
 Straight drop that glass, whipped cream, watch them eat it up like dessert 
 Broad day, call it Draya 
 Almost caught me on the camera nigga makin' it twerk 
 'Magine me with the Kenmore stove 
 With the Pyrex goin' berserk 
 Show up in the khaki Dickies suit, with the Tims on like "I'm going to work" 
 That quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 Started with the rocks in a slab 
 Then I moved up on the Ave 
 Hit them up with that quarter block 
 Yeah, that quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 250 straight, 9 piece straight drop 
 Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block 
 I'm the undisputed track king, talkin' straight cash shit like Mayweather 
 I was 15 on The Money Team, whip a nigga ass like Mayweather 
 Young nigga, 14 for the half from the big homie, didn't know better 
 Old niggas taxing didn't stop shit, 'cause a young nigga got mo' cheddar 
 This work shit is in my resume 
 Brand new chickens all day like I'm Chick-Fil-A 
 Spot open up, weed given on the weekend 
 Even on Sunday unlike Chick-Fil-A 
 Don't you want a 9 piece wing my nigga? 
 Lowkey, tryna be seen my nigga 
 Run through the check, that's the protocol 
 34 walls, threw 'em a promoter dog 
 That quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 Started with the rocks in a slab 
 Then I moved up on the Ave 
 Hit them up with that quarter block 
 Yeah, that quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 250 straight, 9 piece straight drop 
 Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block 
 Said I'm sitting here 
 Staring at the bottom of this Visionware 
 And I swear I can see my dreams 
 As the water boil, see a little clearer 
 Eyes red, nigga might need some Visine 
 Game got a nigga head throbbing, nigga might need some Advil 
 Feds picked up my nigga and his baby mama 
 Last night shit was mad real 
 Scared to go to church 
 Throw him an iced out cross, then I hit the club 
 Threw both hands over both my eyes in the court room so I can't see the judge 
 I made miracles with that soda babe 
 Decibels with that yola babe 
 Cash Money in my projects, since a Juvenile 
 Like the Nolia baby 
 That quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 Started with the rocks in a slab 
 Then I moved up on the Ave 
 Hit them up with that quarter block 
 Yeah, that quarter block 
 All about getting that quarter block 
 250 straight, 9 piece straight drop 
 Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block 
 Let's Go
