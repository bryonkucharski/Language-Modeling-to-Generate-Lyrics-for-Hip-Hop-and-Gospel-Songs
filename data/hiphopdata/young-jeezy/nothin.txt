Man them young niggas killing 'bout nothing 
 Show up at the spot with the choppers like nothing 
 Full fifty shots, clear the block like nothing 
 If you made it from the bottom to the top like nothing 
 You don't owe a nigga nothing 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing... 
 You don't owe a nigga nothing 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing... 
 You don't owe a nigga 
 Put your cups in the air, I'd like to make a toast 
 In case it goes down, yeah you know I got my toast 
 And when you really from the streets that's when they hate you most 
 And when you really got it then that's when they hate you close 
 Knew him back in the day when we was gettin' money 
 Now every time I see the nigga he be actin' funny 
 Don't you niggas see it? I'm a little pressed for time 
 Wanna talk about the past, told 'em press rewind 
 And I ain't feelin' what you sayin' ho, you out of place 
 I have you feeling what I'm sprayin' yeah it's on my waist 
 I'm trying to chill, smoke a couple with my lady friends 
 So they can meet me at the telly in the latest Benz 
 Nigga you see me getting mine, you better get yours 
 Are you the one doing the serving or you gettin' served? 
 Or you the one doing the jackin', or you gettin' jacked 
 Or you the one that's goin' hard or you fallin' back 
 And I don't believe in falling back, bitch I'm goin' hard 
 They wanna see me fucked up, man I swear to God 
 They praying that I fail, I'm praying that I rise 
 I guess the hating didn't work so now they tellin' lies 
 Oh he ain't did this, and he ain't did that 
 Boy keep it real wit' ya self, you know he lived that 
 You ain't real, you don't give 'em what they asking for 
 Such a real nigga, what the fuck you askin' fo' 
 And you don't even know a nigga, what you hating for? 
 And I ain't going nowhere so what you waiting for? 
 Beat the street, this rap shit cake and ice cream 
 Fuck the selling words, bitch I sold ice cream 
 From the bottom to the top, that's a nice dream 
 How you make it out young? I had a nice scheme 
 And I don't owe a nigga shit, better get it right 
 Just know a nigga stayed down each and every night 
 Hands on, yeah I broke down my own things 
 Hands on, yeah I counted up my own chains 
 Fifties over here, twenties over there 
 You know the rest, nigga, fives and singles everywhere
