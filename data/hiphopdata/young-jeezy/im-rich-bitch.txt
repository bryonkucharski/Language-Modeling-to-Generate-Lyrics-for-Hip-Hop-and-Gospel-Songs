I don't give a fuck, I'm rich, bitch 
 3 cars and a truck, I'm rich, bitch 
 Hit the club an' tear it up 
 Chillin' at the light but my rims ain't spinnin' 
 I'm in a brand new coupe nigga, so I'm still winnin' 
 Nigga's sick with it, ain't shit you can tell 'em 
 645 mean it's quarter to 7 
 Lookin' like actin' oughta be a part of the Big Tymers 
 Black on burgundy, plush, she got the suede headliner 
 Shawty hit the club, and he lightin' up everything 
 Like the way his chain hang down to his dang-a-lang 
 (Chyuh) 
 And Jeezy what the rap game needed 
 Young rich thug nigga, and yeah I'm conceded 
 And I'm nothin' like them other guys 
 I'm the shit, bitch, you can't tell me otherwise 
 I don't give a fuck, I'm rich, bitch 
 3 cars and a truck, I'm rich, bitch 
 Hit the club an' tear it up 
 So whatchu laughin' at nigga? I don't see shit funny 
 I wasn't rappin' 'bout it dawg, I was really gettin' money 
 I was really in the streets, I was really gettin' change 
 I was really stackin' paper, I really drove a Range 
 And that's Rover, nigga 
 Young Jeezy, straight soldier, nigga 
 Rabid stripes on the cutlass, it was so clean 
 Had outta state plug when I was 17 
 A young nigga that was way cool 
 I had brick fill when I was in middle school 
 Ay, 'cause if you sellin' they buy 
 Look I ain't exaggerating dawg, I ain't lyin' 
 I don't give a fuck, I'm rich, bitch 
 3 cars and a truck, I'm rich, bitch 
 Hit the club an' tear it up 
 Ay, they say the nigga from the hood 
 If the nigga from the hood how he live so good? 
 And I love the way he shine bright 
 Spent so much paper just to tell the time 
 (Yeah) 
 You told me time is money 
 Dropped seventy on the Jacob nigga, time is money 
 I heard he never had a job 
 And if he never had a job, how he ball so hard? 
 See him throwin' grands off in magic city 
 But ain't never seen that man off on Rap City 
 He must've played in the Rose Bowl 
 'Cause he standing there, draped in all that real gold 
 I don't give a fuck, I'm rich, bitch 
 3 cars and a truck, I'm rich, bitch 
 Hit the club an' tear it up
