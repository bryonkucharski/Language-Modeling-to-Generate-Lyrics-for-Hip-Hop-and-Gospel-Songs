I said you already know nigga, you ain't gotta flow 
 Before rap, young really got dough 
 Before rap, young really seen snow 
 In the kitchen 'bout to make some magic 
 Then blow it all in magic, Pull up to my partner in traffic 
 Gave it to him, it was all in plastic 
 All I know, I ain't tryna go to jail 
 Heard that shit closest thing to hell 
 When it's stepped on make it hard to sell 
 When you been where I been, make it hard to fail 
 'Cause I'm the realest nigga in this 
 Y'all know it first nigga hitting magic in that 6-45 
 Valet say "Jizzle nigga, stay in new shit" 
 But everybody bach back 'cause that nigga can't drive 
 Doors open up I emerge with ten chains 
 Even back then they was calling me ten chains 
 Ask me what I spent, I tell 'em it's no thing 
 Even if I had to add it up, it'da cost like ten things 
 We used to take a little show money just to throw money 
 If it's on the floor nigga, it's the floor money 
 If you bought it out the blow, when you got it from the blow 
 Then that's why the fuck they call that shit blow money 
 Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it 
 Kept it one hundred till the day I came through 
 My nigga hit me up saying "going out of town" 
 So I threw him fifty thou, told him "bring me back two" 
 Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed 
 Caught his little piece up, got laid 
 Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said 
 "Fuck that shit, young nigga get paid" 
 Then I whipped the Benzo on Lorenzo 
 Stay down nigga you don't talk like ten toes 
 Hoes see me in this big pretty mothafucka 
 Bet I leave the parking lot with about ten hoes 
 I done seen it all 
 Yay stack seven feet tall 
 Swear it look white like a wall 
 What you know about thumbing through the hundreds, twenties, and the fifties 
 Spending tens and the fives at the mall? 
 I done seen it all 
 20/20 Pyrex vision 
 Catch a contact standing next to my kitchen 
 Hear the 20s, 50s, hundreds, the money machine clickin' 
 And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball 
 I done seen it all 
 Uncle died on the spot 
 Pop killed the family with heroin shots 
 Gave my life to the block 
 Figured, I get shot 'least I die on top 
 I came alive in the drop 
 Big body all white shit looked like a yacht 
 I got 'em five grand a pop 
 I had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts 
 Flew him back to the States, park 92 bricks in front of 560 State 
 Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks 
 So it's only right I'm still tossing 'round Knicks 
 Probably brought your auntie a couple bags 
 I probably front your uncle a couple halves 
 I was in the S-Class you was just in class 
 You know I was finna blow like a meth lab 
 Expanded the operation out in Maryland 
 Me and Emory Jones in the caravan 
 Took the show on the road out in VA 
 Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla!) 
 Plug got shot started slowing up 
 Took a trip down to see how he was holding up 
 The wars on now he got shot again 
 This time he was gone for good then we got it in 
 Emory got knocked we was down 10 
 The whole team hot wars closing in 
 Niggas can't tell me shit about this dope game 
 'Bout this cocaine, man I done seen it all 
 I done seen it all 
 Yay stack seven feet tall 
 Swear it look white like a wall 
 What you know about thumbing through the hundreds, twenties, and the fifties 
 Spending tens and the fives at the mall? 
 I done seen it all
