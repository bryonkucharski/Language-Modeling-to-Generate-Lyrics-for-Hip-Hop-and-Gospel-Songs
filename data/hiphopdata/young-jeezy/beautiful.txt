I got a bad bitch from Vogue 
 Told her strike a pose 
 Step to the side and look at them thighs 
 That bitch beautiful 
 I got a Lambo, two doors 
 Two seaters, two hoes 
 Yokohamas, no Vogues 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains 
 2-mile-long driveway 
 Man, that ho beautiful 
 I got a condo up in the sky 
 'Fore I fake it, I'd die 
 Foreign bitch, no lie 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Came up in the projects, dreamin' 'bout them mansions 
 Wit' the coke white walls, flow like bowlin' balls 
 Murci in my garage, course it is supercharged 
 Wake up to a ménage, they give me a massage 
 Closet filled wit' designer, Donatella recliner 
 Suede headliner, all that whip in china 
 I ain't talkin' Sprite when I say I need soda 
 Bought my first Caprice, put fifty in the motor 
 Bricks they was beautiful, yeah, Mona Lisa 
 The streets introduced me to money, nice to meet ya 
 Ray Charles in these Ray Bans, why? 
 Touched them keys with both hands? 
 If I die, remember me like Don Killuminati 
 Bury me on the left, right next to John Gotti 
 Play nothin' but that Cocaine Muzik, that Yo Gotti 
 Tombstone ready, took shit from nobody 
 I got a bad bitch from Vogue 
 Told her strike a pose 
 Step to the side and look at them thighs 
 That bitch beautiful 
 I got a Lambo, two doors 
 Two seaters, two hoes 
 Yokohamas, no Vogues 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains 
 2-mile-long driveway 
 Man, that ho beautiful 
 I got a condo up in the sky 
 'Fore I fake it, I'd die 
 Foreign bitch, no lie 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Mirror, mirror, in my garage 
 Tell me which Lambo I should park at the L'Ermitage 
 Pull up at the The Mirage, it's Phantom's and Mazi's 
 Out here, expensive taste, my car is camouflage 
 Speakin' of camouflage, RIP to Camoflauge 
 Just drove through Savannah, Georgia 
 That shit beautiful, and his .45 is unusual 
 Push your shit back like nail shops do cuticles 
 Snowman, tell these niggas that we livin' it 
 Front yard like a soccer field, and we kickin' it 
 Sick condos, pockets full of Rondos 
 Choppers wit' extended clips, long as El Segundo 
 Jeezy like Versace, so we rented out the mansion 
 Fuckin' European models, skin white as Marilyn Manson 
 Came a long way from a nigga first advancement 
 Test drive the new Bugatti, hold that bitch for ransom 
 I keep me a jet model 
 Keep a black bottle 
 Meal ticket wrapped in plastic 
 That bitch beautiful 
 Keep some rose gold on my arm 
 Bottle of Avion 
 FNH with the drum 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Baby girl she out of Broward 
 Smoove with powder 
 Tats on her neck, straight checks 
 That bitch beautiful 
 I got a condo up in the sky 
 'Fore I figured I'd die 
 Foreign bitch, no lie 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 My Chevrolet a seven trey 
 Dade County dopeboy, I'm talkin' heavyweight 
 I hustle everyday 
 We squashed the beef to get the money 
 We set examples for rich niggas in Maserati's 
 My killers in the lobby 
 Bitches keep my name ringin' (Boss!) 
 Execute a nigga; Abe Lincoln 
 200 squares for the same ticket 
 Out in LA, I'm with my main bitches 
 Tiptoein' on marble, got me trippin' on these pain killers 
 I'm still the same, I never changed, nigga 
 Went from razorbladin' rocks, no more holes in my socks 
 Fuck her like a champ, got me livin' like I box 
 Sugar Ray Leonard, nigga, I just want the drop 
 First nigga with the Wraith, underneath the stars 
 Better look me in my face, tell the tears' for my dogs 
 Fuckin' the same hoes, but we got them different cars 
 Ugh! Beautiful, are my odds 
 I got a bad bitch from Vogue 
 Told her strike a pose 
 Step to the side and look at them thighs 
 That bitch beautiful 
 I got a Lambo, two doors 
 Two seaters, two hoes 
 Yokohamas, no Vogues 
 Man, that bitch beautiful 
 Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains 
 2-mile-long driveway 
 Man, that ho beautiful 
 I got a condo up in the sky 
 'Fore I fake it, I'd die 
 Foreign bitch, no lie 
 Man, that bitch beautiful
