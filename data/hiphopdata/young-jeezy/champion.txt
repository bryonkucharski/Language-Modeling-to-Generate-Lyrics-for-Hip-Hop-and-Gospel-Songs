This a celebration, this is levitation 
 Look at how you winning now? This took dedication 
 This is meditation, higher education 
 This the official competitor elimination 
 I-I-I-I was taking trips with Web to move weight 
 Came back to Queens to hit up a new state 
 Bitches don't know the half, like they flunk they math 
 Bitches ain't half cut up crack up in the stash 
 50 Cent Italian, icy flow 
 This is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone 
 'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas 
 But my memories only happy images 
 This is for the hood, this is for the kids 
 This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids 
 This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Voila, Sharika 
 Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Iesha 
 It's a celebration 
 For the ghetto, oh 
 It's time, times like these (Ooh ooh) 
 They know who we are by now 
 They know who we are 
 Champion, the champion (champion, champion) 
 Yeah, okay, we made it to America 
 I remember when I used to stay with Erica 
 Label transferred 20 million to Comerica 
 It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character 
 Young T.O. nigga, either riding range 
 Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!" 
 Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change 
 'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know! 
 Making hits in three acre cribs 
 Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs 
 I made a couple stars outta basic chicks 
 Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish 
 Having good times, making good money 
 Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me 
 I make them do the splits for a rap 
 Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at 
 Straight like that 
 It's a celebration 
 For the ghetto, oh 
 It's time, times like these (Ooh ooh) 
 They know who we are by now 
 They know who we are 
 Champion, the champion (champion, champion) 
 Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo 
 Tell me one thing you won't do: settle 
 Give me one word for your chain: yellow 
 Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto 
 Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I 
 Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high 
 Stay putting on for the town, may I? 
 What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high 
 Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ 
 Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps 
 Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo 
 Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global 
 Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going 
 What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing? 
 Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace 
 Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate 
 It's a celebration 
 Put it up for the ghetto 
 It's times like these 
 They know who we are by now 
 They know who we are 
 Champion, a champion 
 What up Nicki? it's nasty yeah yeah yeah 
 I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23 
 I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me 
 This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ 
 Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay 
 My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, 
 You can see me on a yacht Blasting Pac, little not, I ain't greedy 
 I'm back to thugging, bitches, back to making them kiss other bitches 
 My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister 
 I just aspire your desire to be different 
 My ten year old plan is just one year to finish 
 My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover 
 The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other 
 Here's a man who clearly isn't basic 
 Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness 
 Loud laughter while writin' my next chapter 
 Fast cash life, happily ever after 
 Champions 
 It's a celebration 
 For the ghetto, oh 
 It's time, times like these (Ooh ooh) 
 They know who we are by now 
 They know who we are 
 Champion, the champion (champion, champion)
