 (1st Verse) 
 I'ma a real ghetto star, baby you ever been with one of those 
 04 Cayenne, you ever rode in one of those 
 I ain't looking for a wife, I'm looking for a fun girl 
 Dress her up and treat her nice, bring her to my fun world 
 I know you probably hungry baby, we can grab a bite then 
 Later on tonight, introduce you to my gangsta friends 
 The first time I saw ya girl, gangsta had to stop and look 
 Lately you've been on my mind, me and you a good look 
 No strings girl, no pressure, I just wanna see you smile 
 I ain't even tryna stress ya 
 And I know what ya thinkin', how can a nigga this hood 
 Just say the right things, make you feel so good 
 Look at you girl, I'm feelin' you girl 
 Let's hit the club tonight, bring ya crew girl 
 Later on I wanna see what ya taste like (what ya taste like) 
 Break the swisher down and get higher than the moonlight 
 (Step with ya favorite thug) 
 You know it's real girl 
 (Got me wanna beat it up) 
 You know the deal girl 
 I love ya caramel tone, the way you carry yourself 
 You so damn grown 
 Ya two-steppin' and it's turning me on, ya make me wanna give it to ya baby 
 All night long 
 Ya got ya "17's" on with no thongs 
 (It ain't even that serious, girl ya dead-ass wrong 
 Yeah I'm young, I know the game baby (game baby) 
 Whatever happens, I won't say a thang baby (thang baby) 
 Why you acting all tough girl, I bet you the type that like it rough girl (rough girl) 
 Or do you like it slow baby, it's all good, just let a gangsta know baby (let a gangsta know baby) 
 I love the way you moan, never have I heard my name in that minitone 
 Just keep it wet, it makes the sex better (sex better) 
 Hit the blunt, it make the sex better 
 Bed breakfast, pancakes cheese eggs bacon 
 When I'm finish wit ya, I'ma leave ya legs shakin'
