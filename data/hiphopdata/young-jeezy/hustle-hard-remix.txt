Young jumped on that G-Mix 
 100 like 3 bricks 
 O's droppin' like bird shit 
 Young back on that bird shit 
 Shoes behind me in that Benzo 
 Young pull up in that Enzo 
 Red 'Rari got two golds 
 Cost a million, want two more 
 2 seaters got three hoes 
 Foreign bitch she got 3 golds 
 Speakin' of shots, lets take one 
 20 bands in that take one 
 Young n-gga you crazy 
 F-ck ya doin' lil Haiti 
 Hundred deep maybe 8o's 
 All these muthaf-ckers crazy 
 Dunkin' blocks what raised me 
 Pride n-ggas can't fade me 
 Whole hood on that blue shit 
 While I was riding round in that new shit 
 Hundred grand in my pocket 
 50 bands in my motor 
 Dark side of my chauffeur 
 Sirred off with my toaster 
 All you see is my tattoos 
 All you see is my big chains 
 Right in front of my Versace belt 
 All you see is that big thang 
 87 be the logo 
 Been gettin' ask Polo 
 Lotta money that hurt shit 
 Two n a baby, that bird shit 
 Momma calls, she want a new place 
 Homeboy just caught a new case 
 Need rooms just bought a new safe 
 Audemar just got a new face 
 Blowin' that Obama 
 Ridin' round with that Llama 
 Solid gold's my Uzi 
 Free my n-gga Lil Boosie 'cause it's 
 Same old shit, just a different day 
 Out here tryna get it, each and every way 
 Homies need some blocks 
 Coupes need some shoes 
 Used to get it soft, this what I'mma do 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle hard 
 Hustle, hustle, hustle hard
