Ya, what's up? 
 That's what I'm saying though, 
 We gotta hurry up so we can go to the club nigga, (2 Chainz) 
 RIP We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron out the bottle almost killed a thug 
 When I'm so high, I can't feel the drugs 
 Too many haters in here, I don't feel the love 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go) 
 I'm in a brand new dropped top 'rari with three bitches 
 Tired of being in middle trial with three snitches 
 And I hit up every club in your city where niggas at? 
 I be in every club in the hood, where niggas at? 
 Pulled up, jumped out stuntin like I was Baby 
 I'm on my cocaine cowboy shit, like in the 80's 
 Who a nigga think he is? Slick Rick or Danny Dane 
 Think he Rakim or something, look at his chain 
 Why self from head to toe, I'm Dougie Fresh 
 Lookin' like I came to play Mitchell and Ness 
 Any nigga with a watch like that he need attention 
 Your man don't ball out like that, you need to bench him 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go) 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go) 
 I'm gone, don't know where I'm going 
 Pockets on extra big, they on Somalian 
 Got some bad bitches off in my section, just let some more in 
 And every nigga that came here with me, kick your door in 
 Roll up, pass it around like we Jamaican 
 Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we so Haitian 
 She got good head, good brains, good education 
 I'm drunker than a mother fucker heres the situation 
 1: 45 AM the nine broken, by the time a nigga get to the crib the mall open 
 Man the nerve of this hot ass bitch, she on the molly 
 She said she want me to call her Ms. Berry, she think she Halle 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go) 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go) 
 (2 Chainz) Got a pocket full of dead bread 
 Attached to your girl like a jpeg 
 Party scene turn to a murder scene 
 Keep shittin on niggas, need potty train 
 Turn up, colligreen 
 I'm on gasoline and I'm on that promethayzine 
 Life ain't nothin' but a G thang, switch lane, get brain 
 Hand down her g-string 
 I'm the type nigga that's built to last 
 You fuck with me, I put my foot in your ass 
 I got a million in stash, I stack my money so tall 
 That you might need a giraffe, when you was counting this cash, nigga 
 RIP, RIP, RIP (yeah) RIP (What) 
 RIP, We just killed the club, 
 Drink patron to the head, almost killed a thug (Let's go)
