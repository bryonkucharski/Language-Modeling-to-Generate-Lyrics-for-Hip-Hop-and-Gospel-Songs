 I got the urge to scream out 
 Pull out the bird, it's me now 
 And I don't know about you 
 I'm got it popping like I'm suppose to do 
 Don't want the rich girls scream out 
 Sweat out the perm pull the weed out 
 And tell the world this time and that we going to love you and hurry scream out loud 
 Say III... 
 I'm going to make it happen 
 I'm going to make you wait 
 If you've go something to prove 
 If you feel the same way 
 Say I... I 
 I'm going to keep it gangster 
 I'm going to make it hot 
 If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up 
 Say I... I 
 You want to dance then get down 
 You tryna chill then sit down 
 Do what you wanna to do 
 Don't let let nobody tell you what you re suppose to do 
 You want to go... you grinding 
 Tryna get me in bed 
 Tryna do the timing 
 I know you feel this rough 
 Hey 
 And let me see your hands up 
 I'm going to make it happen 
 I'm going to make you wait 
 If you're parent's don't approve 
 If you feel the same way

 My nephew getting known and starting to talk 
 Now my mom's gotta sit and she can't walk 
 No high school diploma But I know math 
 Ain't write one song and she still want half 
 Dad beat dad is what the media say 
 Best father in the world is what my son's saying 
 Won't stop till you roll, that's what his mom's going to say 
 But hey 
 That's the type of game you play 
 The media talk so bad about me 
 The streets doing so bad without me 
 Can't band the snowman 
 This is thug motivation is just part of the program 
 The first day of class and all you gotta do is stay class to pass 
 Don't mind me I'm just thinking out loud 
 Pert Got my head in the cloud 
 Getting to it, let's just face it 
 We can do it if we try 
 We can make it if we try, make it if we try (say I) 
 Ain't nothing to it 
 Let's just take it 
 We can make it if we try 
 Say I 
 Let's just do it 
 We can make it 
 I know we'll make it if we try 
 Say I... 
 Whoa... 
 I'm going to make it happen 
 I'm going to make you wait 
 If you're parent's don't approve 
 If you feel the same way 
 Say I... I 
 I'm going to keep it gangster 
 I'm going to make it hot 
 If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up 
 Say I... I 
 Getting to it, let's just face it 
 We can do it if we try 
 Ain't nothing to it 
 Let's just take it 
 We can make it if we try 
 I'm going to make it happen 
 I'm going to make you wait 
 If you're parent's don't approve 
 If you feel the same way 
 Say I... I 
 I'm going to keep it gangster 
 I'm going to make it hot 
 If you feel like I do, then people throw your hands up 
 Say I... I
