(Intro: Young Jezzy) 
 Fabo I gotch nigga! (yeah!) 
 REMIX! (yeah) 
 Yeah, I see you chico (let's go) 
 CTE nigga! Grand Hype what up nigga!?? 
 West Side, what it do nigga 
 East Side huh (Slick Pulla what's happenin'?) 
 You already know... Let's get it nigga 
 A Fabo, you know I do this one for love nigga 
 I don't need nothin' nigga (let's get it!) 
 (Verse 1: Young jeezy) 
 I said I'm higher than a muthafucka, right now 
 I'll shot a nigga dead in his shit, right now 
 They tought about a law, but I don't see how 
 Pull up in my car, and the bitches like WOW! 
 And was me a Fa-Bezi, he on 3 pills 
 Renegotiation, need another 3 mil 
 Bitch you better chill, can't you see I'm floss 
 Federales on me, so I pause for the boss 
 All these feds keep lookin' at me 
 Slowin' down the trap, make it hard for a G 
 Gotta bitch on Bankhead, nothin' but a Dankhead 
 Slide through on tha late night, she give good head 
 It was me and Slick P, you know we ran a train on her 
 I.O.U., you know we ran the game on her 
 Mac 11 cock, and the A R steady 
 Run up on me, muthafucka I'm ready 
 (Bridge: Fabo (of D4L)) 
 Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geeked Up 
 I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up 
 (Verse 2: Fabo (of D4L)) 
 Star Trek, Star Trek 
 Scotty don't wanna give a star back 
 I'm in tha zone, and I bought me a star gack 
 And I'm really geek'd up, that's a star fact 
 I'm startin' to see spaceships on Bankhead 
 I roll wit gangstas, pill poppas, and dank heads 
 I got partners like Worm, Lil' Boom, Buddy, and Famous 
 I got sistas like Yasmine, Chocolate, Porcha, they dangerous 
 I fly like blaze, when I'm burning purp 
 Real powder heads, the burning hurt 
 Geek music, I'm earning turf 
 While you football soft, like nerf 
 (Chorus: Fabo (of D4L)) 
 I'm in tha zone, I gotta see my doctor, Scotty's calling me (Scotty beam me up) 
 I'm in tha zone, I wanna fly morning, noon, and night 
 I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geeked Up 
 I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up 
 I'm Geek'd up, I can't make it on my own 
 I'm Geek'd up, I wish these haters leave me alone 
 Help me, help me, help me, help me 
 Help me, help me, help me, help me (I just wanna be, free) 
 (Talks while beat fades out)
