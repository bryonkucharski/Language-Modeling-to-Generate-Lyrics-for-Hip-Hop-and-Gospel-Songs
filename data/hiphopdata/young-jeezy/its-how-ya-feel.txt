Yeah, ay, jeah, ay nigga 
 If you at the light right now, nigga 
 And the nigga sweating you, my nigga 
 Looking at you 'cause you got 
 The big boy shoes on ya shit, my nigga 
 Ay, roll down ya motherfucking window, nigga 
 Blow out that dro smoke, nigga 
 Tell that nigga that's how the fuck ya feel, nigga 
 Ya feel like ya look nigga, ya feel good nigga 
 What's happening nigga? Let's get it, ay, let's go 
 Red paint, inside's peanut butter 
 They seeing me, but I don't see them suckers 
 I ain't gon lie, man my shit tight 
 Hoes jocking, got 'em stopping like a red light 
 Wake me up, this a sick dream 
 Got the Alpine with the flat screen 
 These niggaz ain't aware, mayne 
 12's in the trunk sounding like an airplane 
 A 757 jet 
 He ain't know? You dealing with a fucking vet 
 Niggaz cold like banana splits 
 That's why I cop the AR with banana clips 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 I got a project chick with a lot of kids 
 She say, she like my flow but love my ad libs 
 I was saying, "Yeah" before Usher 
 Never scared like T I and Bone Crusher 
 Any problem, Jeezy take care of it 
 Them ugly hoes say a nigga arrogant 
 Real slow is how I drive past 
 Got everybody looking, sweating like a gym class 
 I see you funny niggaz got jokes 
 Disrespect the Chevy, still riding on spokes 
 You fucking with a player 
 We don't just say, "No", we too busy saying, "Yeah" 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 I'm a motherfucking problem, who wanna solve me, dog? 
 Got six cell phones, who gon' call me dog? 
 This ain't a movie, we are not actors 
 Still use a duck ass nigga for target practice 
 Infrared beam on the Mausberg pump 
 Hit his ass with it twice, make him A-Town Stomp 
 In gats we trust 
 Niggaz play a lot of games dog, but not with us 
 Call me, 'Jack In The Box', hop out with two clips 
 Cook ya faster than a T-bone at Ruth Chris 
 You still hating, looking stupid 
 I'm in the SL, looking real Coupe-ish 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 Sitting 24 inches off the ground 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 And I got the best white in the town 
 (That's how ya feel) 
 45 on my lap, it's going down 
 (That's how ya feel)
