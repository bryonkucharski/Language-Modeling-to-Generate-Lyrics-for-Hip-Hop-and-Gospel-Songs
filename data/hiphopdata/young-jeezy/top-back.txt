Creme de la creme homie, top shelf ya know 
 I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low 
 I like my top let back, let back, let back, let back, let back, let back 
 Ay holla if ya like ya beat down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low 
 I like my top let back, let back, let back, let back, let back, let back 
 Ay holla if ya like ya beat down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low, down low 
 I like my top let back, let back, let back, let back, let back, let back 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I'm the man in my city, ain't nobody fuckin' wit' me 
 You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches 
 I'm a known drug dealer; I always have fifties 
 And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit' me 
 SS's on twenty-sixes, watchin' some television 
 Shorty, I'm never slippin', got the berretta in vision 
 And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to trippin' 
 Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whippin' 
 Pimp stolen' the automobile, and the roof for the tag missin' 
 Polices try to pursue me; it's nothin' but gas-given 
 Addicted to fast livin', yes, I'm one of my dad's children 
 Think I'm bad now, you should a seen me before I had children 
 Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and they oughta have children 
 Hope he got some insurance 'cause I definitely have some endurance 
 Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri 
 Still my wet pet drippin' while I'm woodgrain grippin' 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I got this Pimp Squad Click; I know you heard about us 
 Young niggaz filthy rich, and we ain't worried 'bout much 
 On this glock I clutch 
 In God I trust, if a punk nigga start, bet his heart I bust 
 Got ya partners and the broad in ya car fucked up 
 What ya under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust 
 I got the heart and the guts on this perp I blow 
 Move ten bricks daily, tryin' to twerk five mo' 
 Ya see the Cadillac swervin' down Hollywood Road 
 On the flyest bird in Cali, fuckin' Hollywood hos 
 On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro Dro 
 Bumpin' Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo' 
 Other rappers', old dudes, told dudes I'm a pro 
 With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow 
 (Hey), nigga, don't you hit me 'less you buyin' six or mo' 
 My twenty-four blades glistenin', and my 808 kickin' 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I wear the crown down under, man, somebody better tell 'em 
 'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailin' 
 I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy 
 And now we ridin' Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis 
 If ya ever think ya tryin' to run up on me, just forget it 
 The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded 
 Pistol way in the truck, and my knife on tuck 
 Ya think he ain't gettin' stuck, you got life fucked up 
 A couple stiches in ya hip will have ya night fucked up 
 Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up 
 Meanwhile, I'm racin' my Ferarri like a light for a buck 
 Against Lamborghini Gallardo every time I get a car 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black 
 I like my beat down low and my top let back 
 Can see me ridin' twenty-fours with a chopper in the back 
 Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back 
 If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black
