Just like that niggas don't know how to act 
 Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap 
 Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back 
 Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set 
 I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do 
 And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through 
 I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too 
 And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do 
 I say now just like that 
 Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling 
 Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggas I'm balling 
 These niggas holding they nuts as you see I ain't stalling 
 Swear these niggas are trees as you see I ain't falling 
 They want me to trip on my strings, want me to fall on my face 
 Get a lick for a hundred, damn, it fell in my safe 
 Sexy, no alcoholic but she drink like a toilet 
 Gonna do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet 
 I know just how she like it, she might think I'm a psychic 
 Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it 
 Niggas front like they know me, they must got me mistaken 
 Bitch, I'm pleading not guilty, you'll never charge me with faking 
 Just like that niggas don't know how to act 
 Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap 
 Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back 
 Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set 
 I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do 
 And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through 
 I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too 
 And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do 
 I say now just like that 
 You see my back on my Chevy, you can tell I'm swagging 
 And you know that I got it, you can tell I ain't bragging 
 Them Rollies wear big faces, drink Ciroc by the cases 
 I'm Neo out this bitch, feel like I'm stuck in the Matrix 
 I'm talking so much white, you would think I was racist 
 See I came from the bottom, I'm talking under the basement 
 Threw the roof off this bitch like we just had a tornado 
 Desert Eagles, they twins, I call 'em Cain and Abel 
 100K in my pocket, that shit as thick as a Bible 
 Superstar in my hood so that would make me an idol 
 Had a hell of a night so I'ma say me a prayer 
 In the lockout I'm balling so that would make me a player 
 Just like that, niggas don't know how to act 
 Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap 
 Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back 
 Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set 
 I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do 
 And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through 
 I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too 
 And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do 
 I say now just like that 
 I got 'em popping and leaning, I got 'em drinking and smoking 
 I told her take off her clothes, what she say? That she open 
 If you're getting to money, my nigga, ball like a dog 
 Them cigarillos so big, them bitches look like they logs 
 I'm the life of the party, bring the party some life 
 You know I'm dead-ass serious, why? 'Cause I said it twice 
 We talking straight suicide, we taking shots to the head 
 Must be drinking amnesia 'cause I forgot what I said 
 Stack up so much bread, I'ma need me a toaster 
 My partner ride with his chopper, this nigga think he a soldier 
 Why am I stand in the section when I can stand on the sofa? 
 So y'all guess what I does, you never say I ain't told ya
