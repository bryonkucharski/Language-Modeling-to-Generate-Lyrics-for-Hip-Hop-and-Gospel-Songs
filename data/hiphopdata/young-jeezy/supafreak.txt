Last night it was Kush and Ciroc: I was super geeked 
 Cash flowing, money flowing, yeah that's a super week 
 Got 'em for the 26 5, now that's super-cheap 
 Can't you niggas tell? I'm just looking for a super-freak 
 Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I want a 
 Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I need a 
 Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I want a 
 Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I need a 
 (Verse 1: Young Jeezy) 
 What it do? What it is? What you working with? 
 Every time you see me on grind: stay on that working shit 
 All I ever want's a bad bitch in a Chanel bag 
 Sweet niggas want her 'cause they know she got Chanel swag 
 Straight like that, yeah I fuck with her the long way 
 Been bragging to my partners: I been talking about her all day 
 Pull up in that Super-coupe: you know them diamonds glistening 
 Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then 
 Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet 
 Now that I got her to myself man, you know I'm tryna get that girl wet 
 Keep it one thousand with you: I really think I'm diggin' her 
 Can't hear nothing but the money so she might just think I'm big enough 
 (Verse 2: 2 Chainz) 
 Rick James, super freak 
 She got that wet-wet: now that's a superleak 
 Tell your baby daddy that he's super weak 
 Fucked your girl last night: it only took a week 
 2 Chainz chump! Cost 100 stacks 
 10,000 with my shirt off that's 100 tax 
 OK I'm done with that, you can run with that, I'ma switch it up 
 This bitch I'm with is thick as fuck, I'm rich as fuck 
 Laying in the bed and I still got my semi tucked 
 Going online like "when they gonna make that Bentley truck??" 
 My bankroll make 'em pay attention 
 The white girl like it when I whip it, whip it 
 (Verse 3: Young Jeezy) 
 She with me if I'm wrong or I'm right, yeah she my type 
 Baby girl go and get the bread, she know what I like 
 Meet her at my low-key apartment, never at the house 
 Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth 
 Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, on the chain 
 Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain? 
 Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills 
 Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil 
 Even when she going for the low, says she's not a ho 
 Yeah you know that thing is super-wet: call it sloppy joe 
 Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow 
 Even though she got a lot of names, I just call her "blow"
