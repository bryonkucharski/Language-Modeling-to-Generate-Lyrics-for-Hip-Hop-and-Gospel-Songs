If you grind strong enough 
 If you grind long enough 
 If you grind hard enough 
 Oh Lord, I woke up this morning and started praying 
 And only niggas feeling my pain, know what I'm saying 
 Dear Lord, street life ain't no game, know what I'm saying 
 It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing 
 See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist 
 Nigga me and y'all together how the fuck we gonna miss 
 Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gonna flip 
 Cut the window drop things, I swear to god they gonna trip 
 Meet the haters meet the feds, now that's gotta be a sign 
 Smoked a blunt and laughed about it, writing lose my mind 
 Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind 
 Bought a mic for these hoes, you know my mothafuckin' grind 
 Sleep is the cousin of death, and I'm alive 
 Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive 
 They tryna rob me of this success with no disguise 
 I know that shit was hard on you Young (?) 
 (If you grind hard enough) 
 You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me 
 (If you grind strong enough) 
 You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G 
 (If you grind long enough) 
 You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl 
 (If you grind hard enough) 
 You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas It's Tha World 
 I'm on deck, on point, I'm straight, I'm cool 
 Got the whole 500, drop dead old school 
 Live by the G Code nigga, I don't break no rules 
 And when I was in the streets I ain't see no dues 
 All I know, come through use the kitchen do the dishes 
 Rock hard say your prayers say your muhfuckin' wishes 
 Jizzle what you do you sick of hopping out a 'Coupe 
 Cop a four door nigga hop up out it in a suit 
 Giorgio Armani, still represent the struggle 
 I'm in Giorgio Armani, still represent the hustle 
 See a man made the clothes, clothes never made the man 
 And if a nigga tell you different he ain't seen a hundred grand 
 All I heard is what I couldn't do, All I heard is what I couldn't be 
 Yet I'm still determined on these niggas, just look at me 
 Sometimes I lay up in my bed, think till my head hurt 
 Fuck raps I'd rather stress, yeah we call that bad work

 Okay now fuck that bullshit, get off ya muthafuckin ass 
 You working with yourself you grind that muthafuckin half 
 And when you grind that half you pay your muthafuckin staff 
 And then you take the hood you do muthafuckin math 
 Fuck that ho bullshit, get off your muthafuckin ass 
 Get off your fuckin' ass nigga stack your fuckin' cash 
 And when you stack your cash you pay your muthafuckin staff 
 And then you take the world you do the muthafuckin math
