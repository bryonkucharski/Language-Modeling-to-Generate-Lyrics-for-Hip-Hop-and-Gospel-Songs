(Feat. Slim Thug and Bun B) 
 Slim Thug: 
 Yeah, Slim Thugga, the motha fuckin' boss 
 (It's southern smoke you heard me) 
 Bosshog outlawz boyz in blue 
 (Southern smoke nigga) 
 More money more problems I'm back in court 
 Baby momma tryin' to stick me with that child support 
 White folks tryin' to hang a nigga bitch make me sick 
 That's what I get for thinkin' with my dick 
 Man these hoes are scandalous 
 Niggas are snakes 
 They glidin on my pocket like I'm their big break 
 I be a damn fool to think shit all good 
 They lookin' at a nigga like they take it out the hood 
 Man big southern smoke (southern smoke) niggas jackin my slang 
 I got a feel on these niggas they ain't actin' the same 
 Album ain't even dropped still considered a rookie 
 And niggas already out here catchin that pussy 
 'Cause I'm makin' what they make in an hour 
 That's why I got the club takin' champagne showers 
 Switch cars every season hundred thousand or better 
 I got addicted to the smell of new leather 
 H-town transcend a niggas follow my lead 
 They try to catch up but can't follow my speed 
 Bosshog outlawz run the motha fuckin' city man 
 Call me down to southle with it man 
 Fuck what you think and fuck how you feel 
 We gettin' paid down here nigga it's fo real 
 The feds want a hotter nigga 'cause I'm livin' large 
 I got a million worth of cars up in the garage 
 Dope game make the same down in Texas 
 Boyz gettin' knockin' straight get to talkin' reckless 
 Quick to takin' street fame and riches 
 But can't take their charge so they quick to start snitchin 
 So excuse me if I seem a little cautious 
 But it's a lot of niggas tryin' to knock down us bosses 
 I'm dodgin crosses rollin' along 
 One deep with the chrome is the boss I'm gone 
 Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth 
 Re up on the first and again on the fifth 
 (Yeah) 
 We trap or die nigga 
 We trap or die nigga 
 And all these hoes love a nigga 'cause they know that we the truth 
 Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice 
 (Yeah) 
 We trap or die nigga 
 We trap or die nigga 
 Young Jeezy: 
 (Southern smoke) 
 [? ] On the block rain sleet no sunny 
 Slow motion don't [? ] money 
 Trap all day with no lunch breaks 
 It's to the time for the gangsta cookin pancakes 
 Rubberbands when we wrapped 'em stack 
 Time to ship it outta town you know saran's the wrap 
 Think ahead in case them k-9's get loose 
 Inner tubes like the tires on my mongoose 
 Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth 
 Re up on the first and again on the fifth 
 (Yeah) 
 We trap or die nigga 
 We trap or die nigga 
 And all these hoes love a nigga 'cause they know that we the truth 
 Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice

 Bun B: 
 (Southern smoke) 
 Yeah back up in the hood again 
 Where's it all good again 
 Ridin' candy slabs grippin on the wood again 
 Out of line niggas get back in place where you should have been 
 In case you don't understand I'm a make it understood again 
 King of the underground my gangsta will never fail 
 You bout to make me go postal for fuckin' with my mail 
 Yeah you got the connect but you ain't got the clintel 
 You a jokes and niggas know it this shit ain't hard to tell 
 Rat bitch recognize that your cheese ain't fin to sell 
 See I'm fin to break some bread with the feds you dumb as hell 
 I've been around the block before sold it off and rocked the blow 
 And I don't fuck around when them feds in town I gots to go 
 Respect my mind 'cause I'm a trill old schoola 
 Summer time get to hot I wait for winter when it's coola 
 UGK for life free the pimp you know the deal 
 If P.A.T. is trap or dyin' and we ain't down for gettin' killed? 
 Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth 
 Re up on the first and again on the fifth 
 (Yeah) 
 We trap or die nigga

 And all these hoes love a nigga 'cause they know that we the truth 
 Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice
