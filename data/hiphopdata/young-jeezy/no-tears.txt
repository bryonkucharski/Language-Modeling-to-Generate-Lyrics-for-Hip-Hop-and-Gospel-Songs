You know I come through on some boss shit every time I come through 
 I'm from the place where don't nobody make it, but you know they want to 
 You wanna see a nigga fucked in the game, nigga, don't you? 
 But I refuse to cry, shed a tear, that's the shit we don't do 
 Still this is what it sounds like when you open your soul 
 Tell the realest story that was ever told 
 Riding dirty in the West End, yes, so ambitious 
 Them chicken plates at Chanterelles was delicious 
 Po-po closing that BP, the block storage 
 If I can get them things back down South I'll make a fortune 
 Fucked around and caught dawg with a nine, now it's a wrap 
 Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap 
 And there's a whole new game, new players, I gotta grind 
 Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine 
 Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em 
 Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em 
 And that's when I traded the scale for the microphone 
 Fade a few cars, got rid of my last four songs 
 And just like that, welcome back, my nigga home 
 Don't look me in the eye, something different, what could be wrong? 
 I can never let a tear fall down my face 
 (I can never let a tear fall down my face) 
 For the niggas like you who ain't with me today 
 (For the niggas like you who ain't with me today) 
 I've been real from the beginning 
 I can never let a tear fall down my face 
 (I can never let a tear fall down my face) 
 I'm losing all my friends like every single day 
 (I'm losing all my friends like every single day) 
 I think I've been too, too real from the beginning 
 (I think I've been too, too real from the beginning) 
 They say you lose all your friends when you finally start winning 
 Hey, where the love at? 
 I guess this is what it feels like when you're royalty, holmes 
 And you wake up and the loyalty's gone 
 Them short sentence niggas come on yeah, feel in the way 
 Same niggas that were hating back then, still in the way 
 I swear these niggas think my life is just bitches and Champagne 
 Iced out, Audemar, just to go with the campaign 
 Every night Rolls Royce's doing their damn thing 
 If there was ever a reason to wear all them damn chains 
 And why you keep a cup in your hand? To numb the pain 
 Niggas see you on something different, these niggas changed 
 And I ain't one for dry snitching, won't call no name 
 So really at the end of the day I can't complain 
 Five niggas gon' be happy with you and be happy for you 
 If them niggas scheming on ya demise then they ain't for ya 
 I'm like not you too, my nigga, I could've died 
 If I had a weak bone in my body I would've cried 
 I remember them days where I thought I couldn't live without you 
 (Aye, where the love at?) 
 Now I'm driving in a coupe and I can't even think about you 
 (Aye, where the love at?) 
 We was counting millions on the living room floor 
 I forgot, niggas like you don't love back 
 And I was with you when we kicked in our own first door
