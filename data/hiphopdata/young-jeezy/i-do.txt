(Hook - Young Jeezy) 
 I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry 
 Gone of the Belvee' and 'tron it's too scary 
 Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy 
 I'll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie 
 I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (Verse 1 - Young Jeezy) 
 I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue 
 If I get you open all the things that I would do to you 
 Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down 
 Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who's ya daddy now 
 Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at 
 And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that 
 Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact 
 Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact 
 Now she's my ride or die, it's us against the world 
 You know we both hustlin' so hustlin' is our world 
 Said I must've had too much to drink I'm in my G-Mode 
 So all the ladies repeat after me 'cause it's the G-Code 
 Promise if I get locked, you'll come and pay my bond 
 If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you'll ring the alarm 
 And every time you give it to me it's gon be the bomb 
 And in these unlucky streets you're gon' be my lucky charm 
 I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry 
 Gone of the Belvee' and 'tron it's too scary 
 Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy 
 I'll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie 
 I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here) 
 (Verse 2 - Jay-Z) 
 I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh 
 I, Vito, promise to treat this game, I D-O 
 Honor the code, not bring drama to mama's peephole 
 Life's a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow 
 So la-a-dee, after the "I Do's" let's do Mercedes 
 Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby 
 Looking back, I don't know who threw this bouquet to me 
 But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me 
 I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold 
 And till the task force roll 
 To hug her every corner till I get ash from the cold 
 Or until I've amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold 
 Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever 
 Your secret's I treasure, for better or worse 
 You'll always be my first love till death do us part 
 Pull a hearse up, my verse up 
 I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry 
 Gone of the Belvee' and 'tron it's too scary 
 Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy 
 I'll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie 
 I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (Verse 3 - André 3000) 
 Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman 
 To a him and those and them been defecating on me (ughh) 
 Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen 
 Baby I'm hell, save me, don't bail 
 Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club 
 Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like "love" 
 "Friend," "rock star" and "So and so's a genius" 
 So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it 
 Her proud like her mother and ooh momma's sweet 
 So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon' fall too far from tree 
 So if we ever woop the woop 
 I want all that bleepty bleep 
 On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee 
 Say I do I do I do I do I do 
 So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon 
 Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil' cocoon 
 And maybe 2030 our baby, she'll be nerdy make the whole club swoon 
 She'll love books and cook and look just like you 
 And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you 
 We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version 
 I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry 
 Gone of the Belvee' and 'tron it's too scary 
 Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy 
 I'll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie 
 I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do 
 (You know I do) 
 I said I do I do I do I do I do
