Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What we doin'? Gettin' money 
 So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga 
 Jezzy the boss 
 I'ma psychic motherfucker, yeah, I can see ya future 
 Rap about me and a nigga might shoot ya 
 Serve the wrong nigga and the Fed's might swoop ya 
 Just bring a hundred K and a lot might coupe ya 
 Tryin' to drive me crazy like them boys Gnarls Barkley 
 Mad 'cause my paper stand is tall like Charles Barkley 
 CTE motherfucker we ain't nothin' like them other niggas 
 Try to sip it, you'll be over like that other nigga 
 I don't fuck with buster nigga either or sucker niggas 
 Loud talkin', ass pussy, motherfucker niggas 
 Licks on the wheels, same color as the car, bitch 
 Trap star shit, 'round my way, we call it lipstick 
 And you is a dipshit, for actin' like a dipstick 
 Automatics 'round here but you can get ya gearshift 
 Ballin' in charge, late bull, I'm ridin' dead on 
 White on white image, snowmizzy in the middle, what's up? 
 Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What we doin'? Gettin' money 
 So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga 
 Jezzy the boss

 Stunner like my homies

 Stunner like my homies 
 Lookin' for the rightest, tell them boys fired up 
 Pussy niggas hatin' on us, better keep that mouth shut 
 CTE the clique, bitch, still on some real shit 
 Niggas 'bout that monkey business, feed their ass banana clips 
 Standin' like I'm runnin', so we ridin' new cars 
 What they doin'? Hatin' on us, still at the Vibe Awards 
 Young nigga, filthy rich, Jezzy got a bad bitch 
 Yeah, that's my thing, homie, flippin' like a sidekick 
 Hittin' like drummer boy, hit 'em when their comin', boy 
 Panoramic sunroof, shitin' on them other boys 
 Used to come get us, charge us, what's happenin'? 
 Ridin' on 22's, we don't ride with used Magnums 
 Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em 
 What we doin'? Gettin' money 
 So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga 
 Jezzy the boss
