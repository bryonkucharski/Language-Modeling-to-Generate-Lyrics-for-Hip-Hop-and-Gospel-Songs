(Bishop T.D. Jakes) 
 Touch someone else and say, I'm still on fire 
 I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire 
 I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire 
 I got some threat, but I'm still on fire 
 I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire 
 If it's not amazing that I'm on fire 
 I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire 
 (Jeezy) 
 What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang 
 With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain 
 Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur 
 And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders 
 Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue 
 Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you 
 I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls 
 Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all 
 Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yeah, I'm talkin' to you 
 Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue 
 You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes 
 But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules 
 So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga 
 Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga 
 I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same 
 I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game 
 (Jeezy) 
 Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him 
 We lust for alcohol and we love women 
 And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin' 
 You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em 
 And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast 
 Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 (Jeezy) 
 I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal 
 Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile 
 I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road 
 We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes 
 Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted 
 Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted 
 Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack 
 'Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back 
 And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers 
 Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other 
 Woulda done anything, took a trafficking charge 
 Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large 
 Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill 
 And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it 
 You fell a victim to pressure, yeah, I know it can stress ya 
 But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya 
 (Jeezy) 
 Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him 
 We lust for alcohol and we love women 
 And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin' 
 You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em 
 And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast 
 Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 In the back of this Holy Ghost 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 I swear to Lord as my shepherd I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus 
 I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis, take this and flood my Rolexs 
 This black on black is a blessin' 
 Black on black crime on my weapon 
 I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions 
 Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting 
 Teepees and mansions I rest in 
 Two T's and Top Dawg impress with 
 TV's that play their investment 
 K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it 
 It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you 
 'Cause I like benji and boocoo bucks at my wrists 
 They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it 
 The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial 
 Nigga, Vrrrrm 
 (Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot) 
 My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful 
 It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself 
 Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond pieces in hell 
 Will I burn
