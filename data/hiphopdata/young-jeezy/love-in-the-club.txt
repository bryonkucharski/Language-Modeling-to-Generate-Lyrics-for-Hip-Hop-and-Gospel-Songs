Yeah (yeah, yeah) 
 Styles I hear you man 
 (Usher) 
 This it right here 
 I'm the King y'all know that 
 She the queen, came right back 
 (Yeah) 
 Oh Remix 
 (Usher) 
 Now baby girl there ain't no more 
 That I can say 
 You know by now I want it more than anythang 
 If I walk away and just let you leave 
 You'll be stuck in my head like a melody 
 (Beyonce) 
 I know you want it 
 But I'm hesitating 
 You must be crazy 
 I got a man 
 You got a lady 
 (Usher) 
 I know we here together 
 So this must be something special 
 You can be anywhere you wanted 
 But you decided to be here wit me 
 No coincidence it was meant to be 
 Don't be shy gon let yo boy get in 
 So you can tell all yo friends you was on the remix like 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 Ladies can I put this love up on you one time 
 If you ain't scared say what's up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 They can keep watchin 
 I ain't stoppin' 
 Baby I don't give up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 Ladies can I put this love up on you one time 
 If you ain't scared say what's up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 They can keep watchin 
 Baby I don't give up 
 In this club 
 (Beyonce) 
 Baby you know I'd be down 
 But we can't have all these people staring standing around 
 This right here is only for your eyes to see 
 But you gettin' carried away 
 Saying we can do it where ever 
 The way you touchin me like no other 
 (I'm gon make you feel insane) 
 Tryin' your hardest to make me give in 
 But I'ma be down to give you what you wanting if you keep it up 
 I strongly doubt this velvet rope will hold me up 
 And I don't want security rollin' up on us 
 I'm not hesitating I just don't wanna rush 
 You can be anywhere you wanna 
 But you decided to be here wit me 
 No coincidence it was meant to be 
 I'd mess it if I mess around if I let you get in 
 You gon tell all yo friends you was on this remix 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 Fellas can I put this love in you one time 
 If you ain't scared say what's up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 They can keep watchin 
 I'm stopping 
 I don't give up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 Ladies can I put this love up on you one time 
 If you ain't scared say what's up 
 In this club 
 In this club 
 They can keep watchin 
 Baby I don't give up 
 In this club 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 UhUh 
 Shawty want a thug 
 It started wit a hug 
 And the rest went like this 
 I gave her neck a kiss, a kiss 
 She gave my neck a kiss back 
 I said we can do it like a stack 
 I'm mean we can do it like a G 
 On the couch in VIP 
 Shawty we can get it on 
 I'm like shoutout to the DJ for playin' this song 
 Girl we can act like two damn fools 
 Have everybody thinkin' we doin' they dance move 
 Call me so I can make it juicy for you 
 Meet in the bathroom and you can be my secret lover 
 (Girl) 
 And it started wit a hug 
 But now we making love in this club 
 And we ain't gonna stop just because 
 The people in the crowd are watching us 
 'Cause we don't give a damn what they say 
 This is the- the remix baby 
 (Usher) 
 Come a little closer 
 Let daddy put it on ya 
 Need you to know what happens here stays here 
 (Beyonce) 
 I'm ready and willing 
 Almost good to go 
 Got you standing at attention 
 Keep it on the low 
 (Usher) 
 Ain't nobody watching 
 Don't worry they can't see us 
 I know I got you hot 
 Now let me in 
 (Beyonce) 
 You in the club or the car 
 Where ever you are 
 Run and tell the DJ run it back on replay
