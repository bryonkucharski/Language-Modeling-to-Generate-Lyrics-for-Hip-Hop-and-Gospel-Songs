 What you niggas know about that slow grind 
 Somtimes it don't come fast, it take time 
 What you niggas know about that slow grind 
 I ain't bullshitting at all, need a tylenol 
 So I can lay it down and go to sleep till its time to ball 
 I can do this shit I'm my sleep I ain't trying at all 
 Bitch you know I been here before I ain't lying at all 
 Had to get back up on my feet, had to grind it up 
 Took them plastic bags out that box, I was tying 'em up 
 When I get that iced out watch, they'll be dying to fuck 
 Bitch I'm talking so many coupes, I'll be dying to truck 
 So many colors on the chevy its candyland 
 Everytime I ride through the hood there go candyman 
 Three point fives and them sevens I'm hand to hand 
 Bitch I hit that brick with the hammer that handyman

 Somebody roll another blunt I ain't ready to go

 Got that glock 9 and its ready to go 
 Hustler got no time for a cut I'm just lettin it grow 
 And I don't know where its coming from I'm just lettin it flow 
 Damn right this is what I duz I'm just lettin ya know 
 ??Say empty pockets just to get?? I got bills to pay 
 So I had to add traffickin to my resume

 Then I took some time countin' cash that I had today 
 That's why I had the rari for the deal just ask jazzy phae 
 'Cause I beat that bitch with that ?fourth? just like ?Annie May?
