You got, Young Jeezy 
 Aka countin' the money in the summer 
 And we gon' talk about these bouvale cars 
 These bouvale paint, these bouvale rims 
 You know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 And if you didn't know pimpin' 
 Bouvale is Haitian for bullshit 
 You know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Let's check me out 
 Top down, still flossin' 
 I got my Tino on my lap 'cause it's talkin' 
 Semi-perfect day, got it sprayed at birdhouse 
 No runs marks, y'all, everythin's perfect 
 Got the matchin' steerin' wheel 
 Watch a nigger work, Alpine everythin' 
 Watch a nigger twirl 
 Comin' over, soundin' like an earthquake 
 Got young niggers on your corner doin' triple take 
 Where y'all from, dawg? Y'all might call, y'all paint candy 
 But where we from, dawg, see we call this shit candy 
 This shit is not a game, I don't know what a nigger think 
 I got that laffy, taffy mix with skittles, jolly rancher paint, hey 
 On your Lexus, on your Benzo 
 On your Bimmer, 22's or better 
 On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers 
 On your Hummers, 22's or better 
 On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks 
 On your Chevy's, 22's or better 
 On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks 
 And on your Harleys, 22's or better 
 Now if your ridin' on that bullshit, put it back up 
 I got the 24's on the 'lac truck 
 You see, my Aunty Bridget, she never understood this 
 See me swervin' through and be like, "Oh my goodness" 
 It's Young Jeezy, y'all, ain't no body cooler 
 When I park, all the kids just break out their rulers 
 Shit I changed the grill, so you know that bitch grilly 
 Hit one button and watch the screen straight drop out up the cielly 
 Mister, mister, how could you afford this? 
 This look like some shit that we saw, consort this 
 Gather 'round kids, I got a new word for y'all today 
 If it ain't 22's or better, then it's bouvale, hey 
 On your Lexus, on your Benzo 
 On your Bimmer, 22's or better 
 On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers 
 On your Hummers, 22's or better 
 On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks 
 On your Chevy's, 22's or better 
 On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks 
 And on your Harleys, 22's or better 
 Drunk as shit, [Incomprehensible] 
 Car can barely park but the bitch moonwalk 
 Stay strapped, y'all, keep a 9 for the jack 
 We used to call them Jordan's 
 Now we call them Michael Jackson's 
 G, G, G y'all, he be 'bout his cheddar 
 Get over 19 but they be 22 or better 
 Don't holler at the hoes 'cause the chrome is gonna get 'em 
 'Cause you chillin' with Michael Jordan, he got Emmet with him 
 See bounce, swerve, drop the top, all up in your Cutlass 
 But the only exception is, y'all, these 19 is butt nicks 
 Rap some shit before me, dawg, you must be crazy 
 I'm the same young nigger that got a credit line at Baileys 
 On your Lexus, on your Benzo 
 On your Bimmer, 22's or better 
 On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers 
 On your Hummers, 22's or better 
 On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks 
 On your Chevy's, 22's or better 
 On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks 
 And on your Harleys, 22's or better
