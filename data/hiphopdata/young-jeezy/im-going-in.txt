Hello muthafucka, hey, hi, how you, doin'? 
 It's Weezy F baby, comin' to take a shit and urine 
 On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy-ass niggas 
 Stompin' on this beat like a motherfuckin' sigma 
 Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle 
 I'm so official, all I need is a whistle 
 Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol 
 She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out 
 You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will 
 Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels 
 Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen 
 The feds tryin' a clip us, but we ain't even trippin' 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake 
 Makin' hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake 
 Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace 
 I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight 
 Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it 
 I'm just doin' me and you could never understand it 
 Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit 
 Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage 
 Blowin' purple clouds, nigga, I'm so sky high 
 I ain't cuttin' anybody slices outta my pie 
 Outta this world though, I'm so sci-fi 
 And I don't sit still, I keep it movin' like a drive-by 
 I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot 
 21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop 
 Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots 
 Cover me, I'm going in and buckin' when the hook drop 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 Hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute 
 It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenant 
 If I said I'm going in, then I motherfuckin' meant it 
 And if I brought it in the club, then Imma motherfuckin' spend it 
 Cost a few hundred Bens and I'm motherfuckin' in it 
 No need for a room, yeah, you know I'm fuckin' in it 
 She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin' 
 She said, "I seen it all", I said, "No, you fuckin' didn't" 
 You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater? 
 She said, "I can't feel my legs", I'm like, "Bitch, me neither" 
 I'm going in, where should I begin? 
 I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends 
 And Imma be a legend even when my life ends 
 And Imma a be a legend even when this life ends 
 Girl, I do my thang, hop up on it, like, bem! 
 Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard 
 And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
