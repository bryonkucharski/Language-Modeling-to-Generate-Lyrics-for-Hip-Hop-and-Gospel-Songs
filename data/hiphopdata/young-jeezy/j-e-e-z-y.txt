(Jeezy: talking) 
 It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood 
 All's well that ends well 
 People outside watering their lawn and shit 
 Birds are chirping, dogs are barking 
 It's beautiful 
 That may be your hood but this is my hood... 
 Got the red dogs trippin' and these niggas still snitchin 
 The old lady across the street still bitchin' 
 It's 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep 
 The third time she's called the police this week 
 Lookin' at my Franck Muller, it's about that time 
 The folks just left so I'm on my grind 
 Said you wanna 2-50 cause you need that nine 
 I want that bread but I don't need that dime 
 Charger fresh out the shop with that suicide doors 
 Swear it died and came back alive 
 With 22 inches all under the frame 
 Keep my pocket full of bread, you niggas know the name. 
 Jeezy like to drink 
 Jeezy like to smoke 
 Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke 
 Jeezy at the trap 
 Jeezy like to grind 
 Jeezy bout his paper 
 'Cause Jeezy like to shine. 
 Sold those squares yeah I cooked them o's 
 Guilty as charged yeah I rock them shows 
 I can't even lie yeah I fucked them hoes 
 Trapped all day spent it all on clothes 
 Shop all day till the mall is clothed 
 Then I'm back to the trap to get my pockets swoll 
 Fruitopia, smoke blueberry 
 Mix it with the purp, we call it cranberry 
 The Bin Laden clips yeah they came with the chopper 
 Got a slick mouth I hope you came with a doctor 
 The boy stacks cheese like it came with the whopper 
 Stay fly like I came in a chopper.

 Ain't shit shakin but the leaves in the trees 
 Between me and you I got a deal on the ki's 
 Six in one run, laid a mil on the trees 
 Hit the broad every night, keep a plug on the white 
 Mr. 17-5, you niggas know the name 
 Why y'all playin' y'all know it ain't a game 
 This is me muthafucker, why would I ever change 
 120 carats, you niggas see the chain 
 I'm a bathing ape fanatic 
 Red monkey junkie 
 Glass pots on the stove got the kitchen smellin funky 
 Sold a million records but I still flip them blocks 
 On the TV every day but I'm still pop them glocks.
