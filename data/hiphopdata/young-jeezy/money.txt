If you ain't talkin' money, 
 We ain't talkin' 
 This is DJ Khaled 
 Lex Luger 
 I can't even walk 
 My pockets too heavy 
 Got that forty on me now 
 Them choppers too heavy 
 Told 'em you gotta fall back 
 I can't sneak you in the club 
 Said I'm in the car you need me my nigga nothin' but love 
 Now its blunts everywhere so much smoke I can't see ya 
 Ain't over here, look I wouldn't wanna be ya 
 Talking so many bitches we got bitches on bitches 
 Way she moving that ass I think the bitch got switches 
 Pull up to this bitch Escalade full of killers 
 Now only thing realer, Escalade full of scrilla 
 Louis V to the back, half a rack for the snap back 
 Wiz Khalifa's on the coupe I'm talking black and yellow flapjacks 
 When I talk I be talking 'bout money 
 So please don't talk to me if you ain't talking 'bout money 
 Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin' bout money 
 Don't know what went wrong with me, 'cause I keep talkin' bout money 
 Talkin' bout money 
 Let the money talk (money) 
 Let the money talk (money)

 Luda! 
 I'm talkin' 'bout money you never seen hoe 
 The incredible hulk, so much paper I'm turning green hoe 
 Green giant, I want it, I buy it 
 Y'all just ballers on a budget fuck 
 Your money's on a diet 
 I'm laughing you such a riot 
 David verse your Goliath 
 Let my money talk for me 
 Hear 'em, shh be quiet 
 Hamilton said "what's happenin'?" 
 Jackson said "what it do?" 
 Grant chucked up a deuce 
 My Benjamin said "fuck you" 
 Ah 
 It cost money to fund a war nigga ah 
 I'll have you laying right on the floor nigga 
 And take you higher 
 I'm a lover not a fighter 
 But if a rappers gettin' gassed 
 Than I'm the first one with a lighter 
 When I talk I be talking 'bout money 
 So please don't talk to me if you ain't talking 'bout money 
 Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin' bout money 
 Don't know what went wrong with me, 'cause I keep talkin' bout money
