Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it 
 I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it 
 This should be addition, these niggas subtractin' 
 And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin' 
 Remember times on the highway with them ten 
 Done it all the best, 'cause I've never seen the pen 
 Still do it for the streets 'cause they taught that boy a lesson 
 You done it how I did it, man, they call that shit perfection 
 I'm from a small hood, but I had big dreams 
 My uncle Robert taught me how to use the big beam 
 That was right before he caught his life sentences 
 Do what you gotta, just put your life in it, (hey) 
 Me and (?) in this jeep, we on the road 
 All I saw was red and blue lights, I thought he told 
 Butterflies as we going through this roadblock 
 Ask yourself questions like (is this where my road stop?) 
 I'm tryna be cool, this nigga nervous 
 He sweatin' like a two dollar whore in Sunday Service 
 Got at least two blocks of hard back in this bitch 
 Right now I'm thinkin' we should've better packaged this shit 
 God works in mysterious ways and yes He do 
 Said "Mister that's a nice Cherokee" and they let us through 
 So, don't get to talkin' these records, I sold millions 
 3.5 (?), I bought billions! 
 Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it 
 I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it 
 This should be addition, these niggas subtractin' 
 And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin' 
 Remember times on the highway with them ten 
 Done it all the best, 'cause I've never seen the pen 
 Still do it for the streets 'cause they taught that boy a lesson 
 You done it how I did it, man, they call that shit perfection 
 Hit my nigga up on the chirp, said "What's the ticket?" 
 24 extra 5, nigga show you how to whip it 
 This (?) is so deep, I'm talking so deep! 
 I'm the king of the kitchen now, this is my sink 
 I'm the king of the kitchen nigga this is my stove 
 That's why I got my own lane, bitch I made my own road (That's right!) 
 Now I'm movin' weight like a trainer and a diet 
 Used to put the work in a bag and then I tie it 
 Flashbacks I can't deny, but you tell them police ass niggas "Bitch I'm retired" 
 That's why I do it for the ones in the street, ones in the cage 
 All the shit I'm goin' through, I should be askin' for a raise 
 Don't get to talkin' this work, I made millions 
 Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it 
 I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it 
 This should be addition, these niggas subtractin' 
 And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin' 
 Remember times on the highway with them ten 
 Done it all the best, 'cause I've never seen the pen 
 Still do it for the streets 'cause they taught that boy a lesson 
 You done it how I did it, man, they call that shit perfection
