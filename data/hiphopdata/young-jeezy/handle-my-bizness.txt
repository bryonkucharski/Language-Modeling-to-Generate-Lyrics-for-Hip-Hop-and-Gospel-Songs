Let me handle my bizness [x8] 
 I said young was busy counting money how dare you niggas count me out 
 Made you niggas trap stars gave you something to trap about 
 Gave you niggas streets is watchin', trap or die the inspiration 
 During the recession and the drought who gave you niggas motivation 
 Now the streets is talking niggas is plotting 
 Public enemy number 1 feel like bin laden 
 5 4 3 2 1 I'm about to blow up 
 See me off in platinum 2 1 I'm gettin' toed up 
 Take the vodka straight to the head I'm like you know what? 
 Just keep it trned up on these niggas 'cause they don't know us 
 If you never hustled don't matter now then you don't know dawg 
 That black 745 on dey ass like I'm going to show y'all 
 Let me handle my bizness [x8] 
 I said you can get with this or, you can get with that shit 
 That recompressed ready rock, never coming back shit 
 Have you whipping all day and all that's for practice 
 Bow our heads let us pray 20 years under my mattress 
 Now lay me down to sleep I had dem streets dreams 
 Why the hell do you think my song sound like a street theme 
 Never spossed shit where you stay guess that's a street theme 
 In the streets 24/7 just like a street team 
 Somewhere off in the lonely cell somewhere in prison 
 They layin' there with they eyes closed seeing my vision 
 'Cause they know we come from the same cloths perfect position 
 They jus glad I left the game when I did, perfect decision 
 Let me handle my bizness [x8] 
 Yeah! 
 All hail your trap highness, your one and only 
 You know I gotta do it for shake I'm miss homie 
 Everyday I'm out here making 'em proud he looking on me 
 Nerver thought id say this too loud good looking homie 
 He say fuck them popcorn ass niggas that shit is corny 
 And motherfuck them fake ass niggas thought you were phony 
 Gotta do it for them niggas just serve just like you're tony 
 That come from everyday flippin them birds, just like you showd me 
 Put so many miles on the bucket it needs a oil change 
 Took them bitches out the garage and left them oil stains 
 You know that shit be taking forever we call it oil face 
 Make you frown up when you see it call that the oil face 
 Let me handle my bizness [x8] 
 Yeah!
