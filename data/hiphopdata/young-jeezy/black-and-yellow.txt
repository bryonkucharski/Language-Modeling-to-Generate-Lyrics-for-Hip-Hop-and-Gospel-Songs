 Yeah uh huh, you know what it is 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is 
 Everything I do, I do it big

 When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin 
 I rep my town when you see me you know everything 
 Black and yellow [x4]

 Black and yellow [x4] 
 (Young Jeezy) 
 Brown blunts, black Nike's 
 3 red bone b-tches and they all dykes 
 Said her girl on the way, she a yellow bone 
 Said she wanna hear me on the black and yellow song 
 Told her guess what? this your lucky day 
 Smoked an ounce with Young Wiz just the other day 
 Young on the G Mix, should we change the colors 
 Tell 'em hell to the No you pussy muthaf-ckas 
 Remember cop my 1st lamb it was Black and Yellow 
 You know it had to match the watch so it matched the bezel 
 B-tch I just seen Young in a bananna peel 
 Got that 50 round clip for that bannana feel 
 They tellin' lies for a living, I so Roddy White 
 Pull the plug on them n-ggas it was nighty night 
 Outta sight outta mind, b-tch I'm in these streets 
 Next summer, helicopter, black and yellow seats 
 Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is 
 Everything I do, I do it big 
 Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin' 
 When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin 
 I rep my town when you see me you know everything 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Got a call from my jeweler, this just in 
 And women love me 'cause I'm messin' with their best friends 
 Not a lesbian but she a freak though 
 This ain't for one night I'm shinin all week bro 
 I'm sippin cleeko and rockin' yellow diamonds 
 So many rocks up in the watch I can't tell what the time is 
 Got a pocket full of big faces 
 Throw it up cause every body that I'm with taylor'd 
 Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is 
 Everything I do, I do it big 
 Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin' 
 When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin 
 I rep my town when you see me you know everything 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 Stay fly like how I'm supposed to do 
 That crowd underneath them clouds, can't get close to you 
 And my car look unapproachable 
 Super clean but its super mean 
 She wanna ride with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that 
 Real rap, I let her get high, she want she feel that, convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back 
 Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is 
 Everything I do, I do it big 
 Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin' 
 When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin 
 I rep my town when you see me you know everything 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in 
 Black and yellow [x4]
