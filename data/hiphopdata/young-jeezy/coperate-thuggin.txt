(Young Jeezy) 
 I said I'm corporate thuggin' CTE 
 Until the day I day that's the way it's gonna be 
 Thug motivation I'm bumpin number three 
 Blowin' on some killer shit that I got from zone three 
 Blowin' on the smile yeah we call it Tennessee 
 I'm good in every hood everybody know me 
 So don't wake me up I swear to God I'm dreamin' 
 Paper on the way ain't a nigga still beamin 
 Lookin' fly in the cockpit a nigga still leanin 
 Money out here so a nigga still scheming 
 And I ain't make music for the mothafuckin critics 
 They don't understand 'cause they ain't mothafuckin live it 
 And I ain't trippin' on the Source I got a mothafuckin plug 
 Give me five mics I'm still a mothafuckin thug 
 Now the question is can a nigga really rap? 
 And the answer is you ever been to the trap? 
 Bitch I make hits 
 You niggas waste time 
 And I'll be God damned if I let you waste mine 
 Life changed for the better but I'm still strapped 
 Trigga happy nigga don't make me relapse 
 Attitude like fuck it they hating anyway 
 And I could give a fuck what a nigga got to say 
 You still talking blow? You God damn right 
 What else I'm gonna say that's my mothafuckin life 
 I just left Jamaica I'm talking Nochas Rias 
 Sipping margaritas on the beach in my adidas 
 Brought a few pills but that's only for the skeezas 
 Use my black card but that's only for the reefer 
 What's Up 
 (Chorus ' Young Jeezy) 
 Not a day goes by that I ain't high 
 Hit the mall everyday nigga I stay fly (so fly) 
 26 inches yeah I'm sittin' up high (so high) 
 And I'm a keep it hood hommie that's no lie 
 Not a day goes by that I ain't high 
 Hit the mall everyday nigga I stay fly (so fly) 
 Get it how we live yeah we tryin' to get by (so high) 
 We throw it all in the air baby that's no lie
