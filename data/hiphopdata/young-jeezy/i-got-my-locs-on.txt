I got my locs on 
 I got my locs on 
 And you can't see my eyes 
 And you can't see my eyes 
 I got my locs on 
 I got my locs on 
 And you can't tell I'm high 
 And you can't tell I'm high 
 (Verse 1: Ice Cube) 
 I got my locs on welcome to the terror dome 
 I got them carrots on givin' off them pheromones 
 Women love it when the see me on that motorcycle 
 Niggas hate it 'cause they know I'm makin' more than Michael 
 Been ballin' since the word ballin played out 
 They brought it back to describe me in that Maybach 
 Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin' with our locs on 
 Smokin' somethin' good fuckin' up the ozone 
 (Verse 2: Young Jeezy) 
 Brand new Versace's ran me a buck 50 
 (They must have set you back) no baby not really 
 Switchin' lanes yes yeah the chopper's just silly 
 When it's bustin' at your ass we just laughin' at ya really 
 I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin' niggas on 
 Keep the cashmere vickis on yeah she keep them vickis on 
 Keep my locs on see you hatin' mother fuckers keep my locs on you know they match my bag suckers 
 I got my locs on cause my eyes are burgundy 
 And when I get home I don't want the third degree 
 The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me 
 They scared of the consequences comin' from my defenses 
 It ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin' fences 
 Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches 
 Next time understand what you fuckin' with its legendary status 
 Sittin' behind these glasses nigga
