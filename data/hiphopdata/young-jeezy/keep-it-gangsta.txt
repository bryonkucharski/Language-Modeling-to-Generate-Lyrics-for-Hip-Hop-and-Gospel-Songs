 You wanna know how to do it I'll give you the recipe.

 Pull it out my pants and make erbody back up, (Yeeeaaa) 
 Fuck a record deal the boy just too real,

 But keep that on da low 'cause I ain't trying to go to jail. (Ha Ha)

 They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great, (Chea) 
 Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the 8, 
 Think I start for the Braves way I rep the A, 
 Like John Smokes in his prime when I pitch the K, 
 Got the scale in my pocket on some suicide doors, 
 Yams in the strap facing suicide time, Let's go 
 Outlandish wit it man it's stupid how we shine, Aye 
 Catch me in them bunkers with the troops all the time, (Okay)

 Blood raw I keep it gangsta my nigga 
 This for gangstas I ain't talking 'bout you bustas, 
 Choppa toaters money gettas naw not you suckas, 
 Coola than a fan coola than a freezer, 
 Still in da hood ridin' sixes on the Reagal, 
 Still on MLK still got a side, 
 Still getting money and I'm still in the trap, 
 Lil mama say she like me plus she know I'm hood, 
 I'm a fool wit laying pipe plus she know I'm good, 
 I got a spot for the yay Uncle Pete keep the K's, 
 Auntie Shirley got the money if they rush then we straight,

 We ain't talking on dem phones 'cause I know you talking paper.
