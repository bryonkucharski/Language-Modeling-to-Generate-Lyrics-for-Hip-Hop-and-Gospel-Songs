(Gunshots) 
 Four shots to the chest, my niggas get at me 
 They don' fucked around and fucked up my new white tee 
 I'm just livin' my life, why they mad at me 
 Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming 
 Shit I even bust back, you ain't see me running 
 I hope heaven got a VIP line 
 Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door 
 You know I hate waitin in line 
 Paramedics on the way, but they wastin they time 
 Everybody standin over a nigga, screamin and shit 
 Damn, y'all give a nigga a second to think 
 Which one of you niggas shot me, it was one of you bastards 
 Bet my nigga KinK throw a hundred grand in my casket 
 Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans 
 A USDA top and a throw-away glock 
 Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less 
 When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh 
 (x2) 
 We Expect the worst, but hope for the best 
 But you know how it is, amen god bless 
 I can't leave now niggas owe me money 
 My nigga on the westside owe me 'bout a dub 
 And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too 
 I should'a hugged my son, should'a kissed my mother 
 Spent some time with her, show her I love her 
 Every night she was prayin' for me, I was in the streets 
 Active little nigga, should I stayed in some beef 
 Lucci go through some real shit and he really need me 
 And what about the streets, shit they need me too 
 Almost forgot Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too 
 Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans 
 A USDA top and a throw-away glock 
 Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less 
 When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh

 (Young Jeezy:) 
 I was on my way I was almost gone 
 I was almost there I was almost home 
 It was some Kanye shit tryna touch the sky 
 Jesus walks gotta testify 
 I'm a legend like John we're ordinary people 
 You only get one life there's no sequel 
 So you can't take nothing for granted 
 And don't take granted for nothing 
 So I gotta thank god for waking me up this morning 
 And giving me this air to breath 
 Please lord forgive me for 
 Every Gram I sold 
 Every glock I popped 
 Every rock I chopped 
 Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans 
 A USDA top and a throw-away glock 
 Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less 
 When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh
