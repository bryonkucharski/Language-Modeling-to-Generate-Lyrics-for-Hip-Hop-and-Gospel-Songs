Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high 
 And I luv it, and I luv it, let's go 
 We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor 
 Fresh outta work and on the way with some more 
 And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it

 Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's 
 And I luv it, and I luv it 
 Once again it's on, I'm back in the mu'fuckin' booth

 Nike's on the ground, got my head to the sky 
 Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high 
 Stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try
