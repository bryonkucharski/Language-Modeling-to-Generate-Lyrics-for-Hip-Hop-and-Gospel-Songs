(Verse 1 - Trae) 
 They like "Trae, where you been?", niggas actin' like I ran away 
 Hear not, bitch I'm still the king, check the resume 
 Asshole till they bury me or I get sent away 
 Ballin off, don't apply to me, I'm thinkin' 10 a day 
 Anyhow, anyway, niggas out here actin' gay 
 Point 'em out, line 'em up, bet they ain't gon play with Trae 
 9/11, flowin panoramic like you been away 
 (?) There she went today 
 Tell 'em that the truth is undisputed and I'm nothin' less 
 Yellow stones, ballin like I'm Kobe when I rep the west 
 Bitches out here hopin for a trick, my pockets out of use 
 I keep it G, like my nigga Chris and hit 'em with a deuce 
 Fuck em, I got somethin' with a bunch of ass skinny waist 
 Bout to catch a case the way she beat my dick up with her face 
 Ain't no use in makin' plans with me, she know I'm here for sex 
 On another note, where them haters at, I'm here to plex 
 How they talkin' talkin' guns with a pistol and a couple beans 
 Bitch I'm talkin' armageddon shit, they "Yes, you the Marines" 
 Ain't gon be no chance, you bout to go to sleep 
 Hit you where you breathe and then you feelin' like Miami Heat 
 (Verse 2 - Young Jeezy) 
 They like young where you been niggaz acting like I got goosed 
 Till I came back in that black on black phantom ghost 
 Looking better the picasso y'all should frame me 
 Killing niggaz kunta kinte y'all should hang me 
 Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me 
 See them come see them go you know how the game be 
 Snowman's back, young and too wild 
 Had to switch it up, man, niggaz tryna steal the style 
 (Verse 3 - Young Jeezy) 
 Anyway anyhow the stering wheel's black and mild 
 Make your broad back that ass up think I'm Juvenile 
 My leather too soft just like Wayne and Baby nem 
 Teacher ask me what I wanna be told dat bitch an ATM 
 Dream was to turn my whole block into a CVS 
 Can't trust them broads around the way them bitches DVS 
 Drop it in watch it make it circle like a DVD 
 62 and 125 half a quarter key 
 (Verse 4 - Young Jeezy) 
 Anyhow anyway it's snitches born everyday 
 Best thing to do is get your money and stay out the way 
 Hustla of the year damn right let's be very clear 
 If you sell them bricks to rocks and stones now it's Belvedere 
 Posted on the block with the choppers, guess it's vodka now 
 Hard slowed up niggaz switched playing soccer now 
 Do it for the killas and the dealers know you heard of me 
 Young came back to save the day see the urgency
