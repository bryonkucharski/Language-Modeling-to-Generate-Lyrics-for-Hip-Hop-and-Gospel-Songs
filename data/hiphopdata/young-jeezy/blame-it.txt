Blame it on the booze 
 Got you feeling loose 
 Blame it on 'tron 
 Got you in the zone 
 Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 
 Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol 
 Hey she say she usually don't 
 But I know that she front 
 'Cause shawty know what she want 
 But she don't wanna seem like she easy 
 I hear you saying what ya wont do 
 But you know we probably goin' do 
 What you been feigning deep inside 
 Don't lie now 
 Girl what you drinking? 
 Goin' let sink in 
 Here for the weekend 
 Thinking 
 We can 
 See what we can be if we press press forward 
 Just one more round and you're down I'll pouring 
 Fill another cup up 
 Feeling on yo butt what? 
 You don't even care now 
 I was unaware how fine you was 
 Before my buzz set in, 
 My buzz set in 
 Blame it on the vodka 
 Blame it on the Henny 
 Blame it on the blue top 
 Got you feeling dizzy 
 Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 
 Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol 
 Oopsy 
 She spilled some drank on me 
 And now I'm knowing she's tipsy 
 She put her body on me 
 And she keep staring me right in my eyes 
 No telling what I'm going do 
 Baby I'd rather show you 
 What you been missing in your life when I get inside. 
 Girl what you drinking? 
 Goin' let sink in 
 Here for the weekend 
 Thinking 
 We can 
 See what we can be if we press fast forward 
 Just one more round and if you're down I'll pouring 
 Fill another cup up 
 Feeling on yo butt what? 
 I was unaware how fine you was 
 Before my buzz set in, 
 My buzz set in 
 Blame it on the vodka 
 Blame it on the Henny 
 Blame it on the blue top 
 Got you feeling dizzy 
 Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 
 Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol 
 (T-Pain!) 
 Girl, I know you feel good 
 Just like you look, couple more shots 
 You open up like a book, I ain't trippin' 'cause I'ma read ya 
 Shawty, I ain't trippin', I jus' wanna please ya 
 I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, didn't you know 
 It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo 
 You know what I mean 
 Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream 
 So I made her say I, I 
 Now she got her hand on my leg 
 Got my seats all wet in my ride 
 All over my ride, all over my ride 
 She look me dead in the eye 
 Then my pants got bigga 
 She already knew what to figga 
 Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, I, I 
 Blame it on the vodka 
 Blame it on the Henny 
 Blame it on the blue top 
 Got you feeling dizzy 
 Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 
 Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol 
 Now to the ballas poppin' bottles 
 With they Henny in they cups screamin' 
 Money ain't a thing, if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky 
 Hold your drinks up high (high) 
 And to my independent mommas 
 Who can buy they own bottles 
 If you lookin' like a model 
 When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, bye 
 Hold your drinks up high 
 Blame it on the vodka 
 Blame it on the Henny 
 Blame it on the blue top 
 Got you feeling dizzy 
 Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 
 Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
