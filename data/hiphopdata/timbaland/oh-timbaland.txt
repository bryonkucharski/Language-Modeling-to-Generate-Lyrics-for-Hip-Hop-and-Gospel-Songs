 I ain't got no fillin' 
 I'm a let these niggas know 
 I been killin' 'em with these beats 
 Now I'm spittin' them killer flows 
 Whatcha know about me dog 
 Not damn thing 
 Gotta problem? You can see me in the streets dog 
 I'm a one man game 
 Don't take this lightly 
 If I want you dead and gone 
 I can make that happen because 
 Nigga, my bread is long 
 I done been on both sides of the tracks 
 You can say I trained the game 
 Alot of niggas tryin' to get in my lane 
 Everybody askin me the same ol' thing 
 What they say 
 Oh, Timbaland 
 Where he gon' run to 
 Nowhere 
 Oh, Timbaland 
 Where he gon' run to 
 Nowhere

 I ain't goin' nowhere dog 
 I'm a be right here in your face 
 Can't do it like me, dog 
 Your kick drum ain't got enough bass 
 Don't ever talk bad about me 
 You just might make me mad 
 And I just might see you somewhere 
 And break your ass 'N' half 
 This not the Timbaland you used to 
 Now I'm in a whole 'nother zone 
 You can let me do me 
 You can do you 
 Or get popped in ya door 
 Love on the verge to the block 
 So recognize the game 
 Timbaland ain't gonna run nowhere, baby 
 Timbaland got private planes 
 Oh, Timbaland 
 Where he gon' run to 
 Nowhere

 Sometime long ago 
 I seen the life 
 Don't act like you ain't seen it before 
 I'm listenin', dog 
 You ain't sayin' shit 
 You can keep on wishin' 
 You never make a hit 
 Yeah, I got money 
 Take it all from me 
 I'm a gon be the same 
 You can get a few whips 
 You can get a few chips 
 You still gon' be a lame 
 We ain't the same, my nigga 
 I'm on some other shit 
 I'm a say this plain and simple 
 Nigga, take this punishment 
 I'm a take y'all on a trip 
 I'm a take y'all on a ride 
 And one day I'm gon' dip 
 But I won't be hard to find
