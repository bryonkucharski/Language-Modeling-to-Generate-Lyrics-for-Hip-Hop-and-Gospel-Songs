They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit 
 They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit 
 They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit 
 They can talk that shit, they can talk that shit 
 (Verse 1: Timbaland) 
 Baby girl you saw I'm a don, let's get on one accord 
 If you misunderstanding me check me out on Forbes 
 And I got a Maybach, with the partition 
 And they call it Flat head baby, flat baby the new edition 
 It's Timbaland man beats that make you bump that 
 Over a Mill on my debit card, believe that 
 Wanna hurt a nice top, I'm talking implant 
 Bout to cop a nice watch, I'm talking Rembrandt 
 I've been around world so much I think I'm Omar 
 I met that ???, you the golder arch 
 Yeah I talk shit, nigga that deed shit 
 I bought a yacht just to see if I would get seasick 
 So why you fronting for, when you ain't got that 
 I got a Bugatti Zana, bitch you ain't got that 
 Homey your money's too young, you need to go to bed 
 It's grown man over here, nigga we talk that 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash 
 Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that 
 And I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 And I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that spitting 
 If the haters keep hating, I?ma have to come and talk that shit 
 (Verse 2: Missy Elliott) 
 Oh you think you cute huh, got a lot of money huh 
 I'm filthy rich and you can call me Donald Trump huh 
 I got big bank, I'm talking big bucks 
 And I bought a Phantom to see how the back doors open up 
 Missy E on the track, I'm make you bump that 
 I got the new Ferrari shorty you ain't got that 
 I got them whips that so sick when I spit them hating chicks 
 Wanna know how much I get two hundred grand and eat Doritos chips 
 Been around the world so much I'm like Obama 
 And I got a vacation spot in the Bahamas 
 Yeah I talk shit, talking bout that deep shit 
 I call the DJ's up and tell them go and leak this 
 'Cause I got that cash, I got that dough 
 I make my money money grow, so I'm never broke 
 You wanna know much it costs to get a Tim track 
 Man you can't afford that 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash 
 Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that 
 I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 And I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that splitting 
 If the haters keep hating, I?ma have to come and talk that shit 
 (Verse 3: Missy Elliot) 
 They call me Missy E. I got a lotta cheese 
 And you're a Nickel Bag shorty, I'm a Dime Piece 
 Don't you see the ???, got dough up everywhere 
 And the Lamborghini doors that go up in the air 
 Man look at this, I got the Bentley whip 
 I drive the sickest Benz, boy I make them haters sick 
 You I got it, I get it, I be the richest in the city 
 Talking more shit than you see up in the toilet 
 Man, you's a hater, I got the big house with the elevator 
 See the way you sit on it, 12 big acres 
 I rent movies for my movie theater 
 Now what you talking bout, bitch you ain't got that 
 I got the credit card that call a bill a jet lag 
 See the way the hater talk, a Missy don't care 
 I be your A Millie, A Milli, I'm a millionaire 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here 
 I'm in a Maybach, you in the cavalier 
 Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash 
 Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that 
 And I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 And I?ma talk, talk, talk, talk 
 Now go and give me 50 figures when I talk that spitting 
 If the haters keep hating, I?ma have to come and talk that shit
