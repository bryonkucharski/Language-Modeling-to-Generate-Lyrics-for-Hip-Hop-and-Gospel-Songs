(Intro - Timbaland) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Remember the time baby 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I ain't got no money 
 I ain't got no car to take you on a date 
 I can't even buy you flowers 
 But together we can be the perfect soulmates 
 Talk to me girl 
 (Bridge - Keri Hilson) 
 Oh, baby, it's all right now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me 
 If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free 
 We can work without the perks just you and me 
 Thug it out till we get it right 
 [Chorus] - Keri Hilson & (Timbaland) 
 Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
 Can you handle me the way I'm are?) 
 I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
 Boy I like you just the way you are 
 Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like that, I like that 
 (Verse 2 - Timbaland) 
 I ain't got no Visa 
 I ain't got no Red American Express 
 We can't go nowhere exotic 
 It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that love you best 
 Talk to me girl 
 (Bridge 2 - Keri Hilson) 
 Oh, baby, it's all right now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me 
 If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free 
 We can work without the perks just you and me 
 Thug it out till we get it right 
 [Chorus] - Keri Hilson & (Timbaland) 
 Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
 Can you handle me the way I'm are?) 
 I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
 Boy I like you just the way you are 
 Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (Verse 3 - D.O.E.) 
 Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house I rent a room in a house 
 Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat but I can float ya boat 
 So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E. you gon' want some mo' 
 So listen baby girl, when I make it I want you back, want you back, yeah 
 (Verse 4 - Sebastian) 
 Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them 
 And it's really not quite low as LSN, 
 Your body ain't Pamela Anderson, 
 It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan, 
 But listen baby girl, 
 Before I let you lose a pound I'll buy a bigger car, 
 So listen baby girl, 
 I love you just the way ya are, the way ya are 
 (Bridge 2 - Keri Hilson) 
 Oh, baby, it's all right now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me 
 If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free 
 We can work without the perks just you and me 
 Thug it out till we get it right 
 [Chorus] - Keri Hilson & (Timbaland) 
 Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
 Can you handle me the way I'm are?) 
 I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
 Boy I like you just the way you are 
 Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (Chorus] - Keri Hilson & (Timbaland) [2x) 
 Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 (I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
 Can you handle me the way I'm are?) 
 I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
 Boy I like you just the way you are 
 Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like that...
