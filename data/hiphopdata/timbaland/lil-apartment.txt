Let's go 
 We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out 
 I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me 
 I'm a have to pull the straps out 
 You don't know nothin' about me 
 You just been running your mouth 
 Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 Hey, you old pussy-assed frontin' and snitchin'-assed nigga 
 Ran up on you 'bercrome and put a Barrett on your temple 
 Got a sawed up and opened fire with me nigga 
 Ready to get a crack and come and ride with me nigga 
 I'll put some change on your head 
 Get it nigga they kill you while you layin' in the bed 
 Hey we can bring this on the floor 
 Get you sleepin' then do the same thing to your whore 
 Got a chip on my shoulder, it's getting heavy as hell 
 All the nigga had to do was pay for my meal 
 We used to be down as hell 
 Snitchin'-ass nigga sent me to the county jail 
 You shouldna lied to me dog, I would rather kill and go down and die for my dog 
 And I'm a right for my niggas 
 They 'duce an attitude and pay atten 
 We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out 
 I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me 
 I'm a have to pull the straps out 
 You don't know nothin' about me 
 You just been running your mouth 
 Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 Hey scary-ass, fake-ass, sucker-ass, shithole 
 I got plans, you wonder, find your ass in the river 
 Bobba you're going fat in the middle 
 Especially when your ass's being hunted by a killer 
 Yeah homie you know what they say, I'm gonna catch your mo'fo's ass one of these days 
 I'm gonna let loose with one of these K's 
 Your momma or your bigger momma's momma ain't safe 
 I did some shoppin' around about a couple of days 
 Now I'm lookin' for yo regular ass, esplanade 
 I wish I coulda do it back in the days, but you was a bitch-ass nigga the whole-ass ways 
 You shouldna hated on me dog 
 If I call it talkin', you should be sayin' it to me dog 
 I keep in so much debt, you look up on me on the hill is where you find me yet 
 We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out 
 I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me 
 I'm a have to pull the straps out 
 You don't know nothin' about me 
 You just been running your mouth 
 Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 Pussy-assed sucker-assed broad-assed nigga 
 Runnin' your mouth 'cause you're a broad-assed nigga 
 I look in your face and see hokay 
 Niggas it's hard to shake, they stay in your wake 
 But I move with smooth pace 
 Give a ruck about a case, put a black in your face 
 Until my mission complete I don't cease 
 How the fuck you gonna shit on my name in these streets 
 Supplied the hustle, I'll put the muscle 
 Got niggas on standby and they ready to touch 
 They ain't fuckin' with you, bitch, straight to the face 
 No shit's left on the scene, just no body to trace 
 After you checkin' in, they given the win 
 How long you got left, it really depends 
 You don't know which way to go, and you're struck outta breath 
 That's what motherfucker's get for not checking their shit 
 We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out 
 I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me 
 I'm a have to pull the straps out 
 You don't know nothin' about me 
 You just been running your mouth 
 Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope 
 Yo, it's over
