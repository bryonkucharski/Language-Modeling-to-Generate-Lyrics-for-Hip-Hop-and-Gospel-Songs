Uh uh 
 Hey baby how you 
 Why yo face lookin' all sad and blue 
 Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you 
 Why you trying to act a fool 
 Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends 
 Ask Tonya and Shirl then 
 Gimme a place and time when 
 Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets 
 You gotta remember, without you, there's no me 
 I'm just an average man 
 Tryin' to make it in this cold world 
 Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl 
 I don't want to fuss with you 
 So I'm gonna sit out on the couch 
 Don't try to talk to me 
 'Cause boy I am blocking you out 
 I don't want to hear a thing 
 Nothing you got to say 
 You should think twice 
 About the way you've been talking to me 
 Pack yo bags 
 Get on the bus 
 Ain't got no time (for) 
 Talkin' all yo stuff 
 Need to pack my stuff 
 Since this's what you want 
 I don't really care 
 There's no more 
 Go catch a cab or 
 Get on the bus 
 I ain't got no time for 
 You talkin' all that junk 
 Better get my stuff 
 Since this is what you want 
 I don't really care 
 I ain't got no words for you 
 So you can stop callin' my friends 
 Tellin' them it wasn't your fault 
 And why I ain't lettin' you in 
 Too many times before 
 I let you back in my life 
 But this is a new day 
 And this won't go down tonight 
 Mm, mm (da-da-duh-da-da) 
 Mm, mm (who) 
 Mm, mm {say what} 
 Introduce you to Dolce and Gervana 
 Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas 
 Took you from that terrible stress 
 Now you telling me that I am a bother 
 What kind of mess is that 
 To tell a man who put you on his team 
 That's just like killing a dream 
 (No no baby) That's how it seems 
 I worked hard to build up what I had for you 
 I pray to God, that there's not another man between me and you 
 So just tell me 
 There's no need to lie for 
 While you sleepin' with your eyes closed 
 Do you want to talk, aight yo
