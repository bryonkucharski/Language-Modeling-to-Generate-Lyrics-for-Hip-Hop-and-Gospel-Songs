Hey Timbo 
 Yeah 
 Don't you hate it when a dude starts actin' up 
 Like this fella over here with his hands on the scuff 
 Be muggin' and carryin' on 
 Hey JT 
 Yeah 
 Why these dudes keep starin' at us 
 I dunno but Ima bout to find out wassup 
 Be easy don't take it to rough 
 Talk to 'em 
 I'm not being cocky 
 I just noticed that she was looking at me 
 Chill homeboy be cool 
 Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me 
 Its just gettin' started 
 And there's a lot of fish around 
 Here just shakin' they jelly 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude dude but we tryin' to tear up the place come on 
 There ain't nothing to it 
 If you wanna get down then we can do it-do it 
 There ain't nothing to it 
 Get out your seat 
 Why 
 You ain't glued to it 
 Be easy and watch that, tone 
 Keep stepping with your new suede shoes, on 
 Boys and girls lets all sing along 
 Now everybody just get on the good foot 
 Get on the good foot 
 Now, how am I supposed to know that she's yours 
 She ain't got no ring on her finger 
 It ain't our fault homeboy that your girl likes to wonder and linger 
 Your actin' so serious 
 We just danced I ain't even ask for her number 
 Don't be mad 'cause we the life of the party 
 We ain't tryin' to hurt nobody talk to 'em 
 I'm not being cocky 
 I just noticed that she was looking at me 
 Chill homeboy be cool 
 Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me 
 Its just gettin' started 
 And there's a lot of fish around 
 Here just shakin' they jelly 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude dude 
 But we tryin' to tear up the place
