I'm bringing sexy back 
 Them other boys don't know how to act 
 I think you're special, what's behind your back? 
 So turn around and I'll pick up the slack. 
 Take 'em to the bridge 
 Dirty babe 
 You see the shackles 
 Baby I'm your slave 
 I'll let you whip me if I misbehave 
 It's just that no one makes me feel this way 
 Take 'em to the chorus 
 Come here girl 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Come to the back 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 V-i-p 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Drinks on me 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Let me see what you're working with 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Look at those hips 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 You make me smile 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Go ahead child 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 And get your sexy on 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 (Repeat: x8) 
 Get your sexy on 
 Go ahead, be gone with it 
 Get your sexy on 
 I'm bringing sexy back 
 Them other fuckers don't know how to act 
 Come let me make up for the things you lack 
 'Cause you're burning up I gotta get it fast 
 Take 'em to the bridge 
 Dirty babe 
 You see the shackles 
 Baby I'm your slave 
 I'll let you whip me if I misbehave 
 It's just that no one makes me feel this way 
 I'm bringing sexy back 
 You mother fuckers watch how I attack 
 If that's your girl you better watch your back 
 'Cause she'll burn it up for me and that's a fact 
 Take 'em to the chorus
