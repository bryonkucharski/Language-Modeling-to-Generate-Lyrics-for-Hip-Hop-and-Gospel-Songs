(Timbaland) 
 Uh-huh, now what we gonna do 
 Take it from the Eastside to the country 
 Ya feel me? Ya feel me? 
 Ya feel me? Tchka-tchka-tchka 
 Check the chorus... 
 (Timbaland) 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh, yeah 
 Yo, uh, yeah, yo... 
 Aiyyo, this I'll make ya head hurt 
 When the hawk take the day off 
 I make the lead work, I'll put you in the red dirt 
 Ice make 'em look like stars, they comin' through 
 On the bikes, but they look like cars, it's somethin' new 
 And Jada talk so good, but 'cha brain is 
 Nowhere next to ready for this stainless 
 It's no helpin' you when them thangs melt in you 
 And way down in Athens, Jada's a bell ringer 
 I'ma bring the hood to the farm 
 Bless 'em with some purple hay 
 Remove the wood from the barn 
 Introduce them to the yak and cranberry 
 And make sure Bubba Spark good, then I'm gone 
 Even if we run the war, I'ma still run the raw 
 You can come and see me, I got 'em for twenty-four 
 Double R and Beat Club, who hard as us? 
 R3: In The "R" We Trust, c'mon 
 (Timbaland) 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 (Bubba Sparxxx) 
 Uh, uh... 
 Boy, silly if you saw them crackers ridin' with them pigs 
 And thought I might would hit this robe for less than twenty-five a gig 
 Doin' sixty-five, I sled off acid and shitty bourbon 
 Took a minute to adjust, but right now this big shit is workin' 
 I'm white just by chance, but I'm country by God's graces 
 Nowadays I find myself doin' laundry in odd places 
 But still, I keep it Bubba even into Mr. Kiss and them 
 Brought 'em down to Athens, let 'em cut with my sister's friend 
 Now we gettin' blist again, back on the block in Yonkers 
 And Tim done laced a track, man this shit is hot as bonkers 
 Kiss, not to flaunt ya, but just tell 'em Bed has come here 
 I'm doin' for my family, but y'all are really done here 
 But Bubba is the truth and perhaps this is discussion 
 Of wither I'm that deal or a product of Tim's percussion 
 Y'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on 
 Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah 
 (Timbaland) 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 (Bubba Sparxxx) 
 How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces? 
 To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me 
 Notice how he see, the picture for it's painting 
 And poured you up of this mixture before it was tainted 
 See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted 
 And I pledge to maintain it, be damned if I'ma change it 
 This shit is anus, ain't it? Fuck 'em, Kiss bring it home 
 I ryde or die with Beat Club, won't bend for the sake of this song 
 (Jadakiss) 
 The streets is still mine, I stay with the still nine 
 And it's still long and if I'm stronger than corn like I pinkeyed 
 Niggaz pretend to be weeded, that's what the industry needed 
 Kiss flippin' his flow, enemies heated 
 But we gon' let the gats pop 
 From the old rifles on the dirt road to the handguns on the blacktop 
 Don't get the plot wrong, this ain't a black or white politic thing 
 Cocksucker, it's a hot song 
 (Timbaland) 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know 
 Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know 
 Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready 
 They don't know know know
