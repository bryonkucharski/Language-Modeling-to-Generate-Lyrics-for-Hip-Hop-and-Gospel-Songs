I was livin' in a sad time at home 
 I was hopin people would just leave me alone 
 I don't understand why everyone cares so much 
 They are all back in forth in a rush 
 Why can't I stay underground? (underground) 
 That way when they keep lookin' I'll never be found 
 Why can't they just go away? 
 They keep comin' by everyday 
 Why can't I stay underground? (underground) 
 I hope no one can find me in this empty place 
 But trust me, somehow they will find a way 
 They keep taking things I say 
 And twisting them to go the wrong way 
 Why can't I stay underground? (underground) 
 That way when they keep lookin' I'll never be found 
 Why can't they just go away? 
 They keep comin' by everyday 
 Why can't I stay underground? (underground) 
 Leave me alone 
 Leave me alone 
 Leave me alone 
 Just wanna be... 
 Underground!
