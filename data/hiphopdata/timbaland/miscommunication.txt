 Oh! Two Step! Oh! 
 Timbaland 
 Let me talk to you girl 
 Keri Hilson 
 What? 
 Timbaland and Keri Hilson 
 I'm in your part of town 
 I call your phone and you're no where to be found 
 You do this every time 
 You be in mine every single time 
 The part that kills me 
 You rather chill with your friends instead of me huh. 
 But I ain't gon' be no clown 
 I guess I call you next time I'm in your town 
 And you say to me 
 Keri Hilson 
 So what, I was out with my friends 
 I'm a grown woman 
 It's the weekend, oh 
 So what if I don't answer my phone 
 What if I'm not alone 
 I'm with him 
 What's it to you? 
 Timbaland singing "la-la lee la-la lee" 
 I need to get out 
 You you you you you 
 Are killing me, you're killing me, you're killing me 
 And I 
 Just wanna get out 
 You you you you you 
 Are killing me, you're killing me 
 Whatcha wanna do? (Do, do) Whatcha wanna do? (Do, do) 
 Timbaland stops singing 
 I cannot escape 
 No matter what I do 
 Can't get away from you, oh 
 Call me everyday 
 And that there ain't never cool 
 Getting on my nerves 
 I think it's time you knew 
 Only gave you my number cause, drinks made you cuter, plus 
 You were looking sad and lonely, oh 
 But that's all it was 
 Just put you in the game 
 And here you go complainin' 
 What's up with you? 
 Timbaland singing "la-la lee la-la lee" 
 I need to get out 
 You you you you you 
 Are killing me, you're killing me, you're killing me 
 And I 
 Just wanna get out 
 You you you you you 
 Are killing me, you're killing me 
 Whatcha wanna do? (Do, do) Whatcha wanna do? (Do, do) 
 Timbaland stops singing 
 Sebastian Cabot 
 Like whoa little mama, it's the second time I'm callin' your number 
 I ain't chasin' I ain't even no runner 
 Don't you know I push the Hummer in the summer, huh 
 How you hard to be reached 
 I can put you where you hard to be reached 
 Black sand on the balls of your feet 
 You can scream, ain't no body gon' be sleep, 
 This your own private beach, 
 And when it comes to sex, 
 Just a little bit of love and little bit of that 
 Maybe push it back where your ribs is at 
 Share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that, 
 I'm just jokin' of course, 
 I'm trying to put your sex game back on course 
 If you feelin' dry, like you don't get moist 
 If you ever get a minute holla at yo' boy
