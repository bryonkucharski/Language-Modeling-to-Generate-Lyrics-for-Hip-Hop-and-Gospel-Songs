 So listen a couple girls 
 Who was in and I mess with a couple girls 
 Magazines, you can catch me on a couple girl 
 I created my own plane to cover the Earth and cover the world 
 I spit so sick so I put 'em on girls 
 She's tryna come over 
 And she burn my perms 
 She tryna come at 
 Of all of my hurts, place to be 
 But I made at my girls 
 Now she just wanna say 
 Just wanna please, 
 She want it, so she lives on her knees 
 Jack and Jill, went up the hill 
 Each back up in a corner, you came back with 250, 
 What a working girl, now work it girl 
 Like, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah 
 Like, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah 
 Timbaland 
 Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God 
 Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God 
 Oh oh my God

 What are you doing? 
 I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor 
 I like when I see you break it down like you in control

 And one in a middle, and I'm feeling their breath
