(People, people, people) 
 It's getting so lonely inside this bed 
 Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead 
 And there's an aching inside my head 
 It's telling me you're better off alone 
 But after midnight morning will come 
 And the day will see if you will get some 
 They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough 
 Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light 
 They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough 
 Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light 
 And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down 
 'Til you see all my dreams 
 Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems 
 I looked above the other day 
 'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change 
 I live my life by the moon (by the moon) 
 If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go 
 But after midnight morning will come 
 And the day will see if you're gonna get some 
 They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough 
 Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light 
 They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough 
 Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light 
 And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down 
 'Til you see all my dreams 
 Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems 
 And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see 
 Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me 
 I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe 
 That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve 
 I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life 
 Or is it love that I'm looking to find 
 It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah 
 All in me, yeah 
 Where is your logic 
 Turn of the light, turn off the light 
 Who do you need 
 Turn off the light, turn off the light 
 And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down 
 Where can you turn 
 'Til you see all my dreams 
 Where is your logic 
 Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems 
 Who do you need 
 Follow me follow me follow me down down 
 Turn off the light, turn off the light 
 Follow me follow me follow me down down 
 Turn off the light, turn off the light 
 Where is your light, yeah 
 Turn off the light, turn off the light 
 Who do you need 
 Where can you turn 
 Turn off the light, turn off the light
