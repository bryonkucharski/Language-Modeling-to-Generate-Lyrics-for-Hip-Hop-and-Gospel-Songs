 In the crib and she sweating out a good weave 
 She know what I'm talking about 
 'Cause she know how them gangstas getting down in the south 
 To get the pizzazz up in the VIP section 
 Now she wanna do what I'm doing up in the session 
 In the studio she wanna make music 
 But she already be knowing I'm really gonna abuse it 
 And pro'ly make her stupid from all the knob that she be giving 
 Plus she be knowing the way the shit is really fitting 
 And I don't listen what she saying 
 All she gotta know is I'm fucking and I ain't never been 
 Cause everything I be getting is straight

 Sitting on the couch and I put my feet up
