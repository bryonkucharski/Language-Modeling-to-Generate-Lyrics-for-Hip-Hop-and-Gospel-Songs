Timothy I took your place 
 Timothy 'cause such a waste 
 Timothy we found your spaceship 
 Timothy it's the farthest you've ever flown 
 Put your lighters up 
 Put your lighters up y'all (y'all) 
 Put your lighters up 
 This the Timothy song if ya don't 'bout me 
 Ya they call me Tim 
 VA's phenomenon 
 I kill 'em all winter 
 Until the summer come 
 From just another name 
 All the way to number one 
 And I'm simply the best 
 When it's all said and done 
 Remember when me and Magoo was tryin' to make a meal 
 Well we did 
 And years later we got it still 
 Gave you my bio 
 Under construction 1 and 2 
 Hundred percent genuine 
 That was from me to you 
 I'm makin' moves while they ridicule 
 I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool 
 I'm cool 
 I never kept it basic 
 I been so many places 
 Been gettin' money since them honeys had them small faces 
 So many little me's 
 I can hear small traces 
 But I just ignore it 
 'Cause I'm too big for it 
 And I can hear 'em screamin (screamin) 
 Timothy where have you been 
 It's not what it seems but it is 
 Timothy where have you been 
 She cried in the kitchen to let you go 
 Timothy where have you been 
 I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxx 
 When the nights was bright 
 And all the days was dark 
 But now they all bright 
 Everything is all right 
 If you assumin life was wonderful 
 Then you all right 
 I got a bad wife 
 3 beautiful kids 
 I make the world dance 
 Ya look what I done did 
 Here's for Jay-Z 
 Nelly Furtado 
 Catch up 
 Y'all slow 
 Escargot 
 Nelly your 14 mil 
 Where's Fargo? 
 I brought a airplane 
 Fuck I need a car for? 
 Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great 
 Y'all gotta deal wit me 
 No handshake 
 Stand up N*gga 
 Rather have a stand off 
 Wit the law before I let 'em say I ran off 
 And I can hear 'em screamin 
 Timothy where have you been 
 It's not what it seems but it is 
 Timothy where have you been 
 She cried in the kitchen to let you go 
 Timothy where have you been 
 Hey some say I run away 
 But really I never left 
 They wonder where I been 
 But they can never guess 
 I been around the world 
 Here to the other side 
 And I successfully achieved what all those others tried 
 Carry my city on my back 
 Like a crucifix 
 For more than a decade 
 'Cause I can do this shit 
 A lot of people want my spot 
 But I don't hesitate 
 The track label by legacy 
 Won't appreciate 
 I stand strong 
 Everything I put my hands on 
 Me and Mr. I-Be 
 'Cause ain't no I in team 
 'Cause I can hear 'em sayin' 
 Timothy where have you been 
 It's not what it seems but it is 
 Timothy where have you been 
 She cried in the kitchen to let you go 
 Timothy where have you been 
 Timothy where have you been 
 She cried in the kitchen to let you go 
 Where have you been 
 Timothy where have you been
