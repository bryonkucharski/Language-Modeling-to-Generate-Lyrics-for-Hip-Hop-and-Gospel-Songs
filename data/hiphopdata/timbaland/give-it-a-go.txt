This is the final moment, can't let them lock me down 
 I'm ready and I know it, I gotta make it count 
 This time may never come again 
 And I'ma fight, I'm going for the win 
 There ain't no way I'm stopping, already paid my dues 
 Failure is not an option, I got too much too lose 
 Running out of energy, I come hot in the coldest way 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Watch me turn it on 
 No matter what you tell me, I will never give up 
 There's no excuse for failing, so don't hold your breath for love 
 I will never let you come and steal my joy 
 Just give up stop trying, I'm no concern of yours 
 If I'm just a pilot, won't you come fly with me 
 You're wasting so much time with this negativity 
 Let me give it to you in the coldest way 
 There's no need to hate, I will never change 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go 
 Watch me turn it on.
