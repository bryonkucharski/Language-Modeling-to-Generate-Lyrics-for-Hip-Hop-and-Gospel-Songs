<Traveled all around the world to be with you 
 You never know where the open road will lead you to 
 I crawl before I walk, still got nowhere fast 
 The other side still has the greener grass 
 Oh, you win some and you loose some yeah 
 Oh, and things look so much smarter from up there 
 I hear it's such a Long Way Down 
 And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds 
 I hear it's such a long way down 
 And the climb back up is just something I can do without 
 Something I can do without 
 I walked until I didn't have no energy 
 I bought until I didn't have no bite left in me 
 I died so that I didn't have to live in the past 
 But the other side still had the greener grass 
 Oh, you win some and you loose some yeah 
 Oh, and things look so much smarter from up there 
 I hear it's such a long way down 
 And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds 
 I hear it's such a long way down 
 And the climb back up is just something I can do without 
 Something I can do without 
 Put your hands up yeah, Put your hands up yeah 
 Put your hands up yeah, Something I can do without 
 I hear it's such a long way down 
 And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds 
 I hear it's such a long way down 
 And the climb back up is just something I can do without 
 Just something I can do without, oh yeah 
 Something I can do without, Something I can do without 
 Something I can do without, Something I can do without 
 Something I can do without, Something I can do without 
 Something I can do without, out, out, out, that's it -->
