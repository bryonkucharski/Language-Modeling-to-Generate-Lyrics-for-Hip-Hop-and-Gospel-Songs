Hello Mr. Mosley 
 I'm glad you're my maker 
 My Loyalty lies in your hands, you're my breath taker 
 Your body, your kiss is in unknown demand 
 So take command, go Timbo 
 I be the same when it all goes up 
 I be the same when it all goes down 
 Not the first one, open it up 
 I be the last one closin it out 
 Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet 
 Lil Mama I'm peepin your style 
 Do I think you're dope enough, yup 
 One way of findin it out 
 The way you came at me, boo 
 Don't care, not afraid I'm like Wild 
 Really want it from head to toe 
 Question if she gon let it out 
 Anyway the hour glass go 
 I don't worry anyhow 
 Why don't we see where it go 
 Let's figure it out 
 When the cats come out the bats come out to play Yeah 
 In the morning after 
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your way Yeah

 (Sarey Savy) 
 I got a little secret for ya 
 I never sleep when comes the night 
 But every time I smack my fingers 
 I switch back into the light 
 My moon belong to your sun 
 Your fire is burning my mind 
 Is it love or is it lust 
 Something that I just can't describe (ah) 
 Am I the one and only (ah) 
 'Cause you're the only one (ah) 
 It felt so long and lonely (ah) 
 Waiting for you to come 
 It's lookin' bright and early 
 I'm willing to close my eyes 
 This is the unusual story
