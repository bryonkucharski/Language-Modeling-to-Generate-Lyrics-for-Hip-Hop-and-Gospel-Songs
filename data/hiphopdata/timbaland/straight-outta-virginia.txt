 (Verse 1 - Timbaland) 
 I'm comin' straight outta VA (oh) 
 A nigga named Timbo, growin' up a nigga never had cash flow 
 Catch me dippin in the banana ten fo' 
 With my nigga Antoine and Theo (c'mon) 
 Probably hit the high school football game 
 Salem versus Green Run and that's the shit mayn 
 After that we gon' meet up at the food line (what) 
 Little Caesar's pieces motherfuckers ain't tryin' 
 To go against (what), probably three (uh huh) 
 Keep talkin' nigga you'll get found in that creek (oh) 
 And that's how we do it in the V (oh) 
 I can't forget my nigga Pharrell and Camsky (oh) 
 Y'all remember them house parties (oh) 
 When a nigga name was DJ Timmy T (oh) 
 Queen bread, Blackness had the Cutlass Capri (oh) 
 Look at this nigga, I'm reppin my V (uh, oh) 
 Yeah (oh)

 (Nah, nah, nah, nah) 
 Yeah (like this oh)
