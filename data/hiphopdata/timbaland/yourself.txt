Get out... Get out! You can't be in here! 
 You have to get out! 
 I implore you... Please? 
 Please? 
 You're all going to die down here... 
 Timbaland 
 It's life or death 
 Either one 
 The king is back 
 Take heed and run 
 I piss and take a shit on your beat for fun 
 The game I ain't even use a gun 
 Who better than me? 
 Don't make me laugh 
 I run this shit they just chase my ass 
 I ain't talkin' shit nigga 
 Just tellin' the facts 
 I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack 
 I be hearin' these niggas 
 What they say in they rhymes 
 I took my spot nobody gave me mine 
 I make the beats that boom boom boom! in they trunks 
 You disagree homie then go on and jump 
 You can bump your gum 
 You can say what you want 
 That's all you gon' do cause you niggas is punks 
 I'm number one you ain't nothin' but shit 
 When they need a hit I would be the one to get 
 Talk to me 
 If you got love for me I got love for you 
 If you fuck with me I fuck with you 
 We can do it however you wanna do 
 Nigga if you fuck with me I fuck with you 
 Gon' head 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 If I was you I wouldn't fail myself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 If I was you I wouldn't fail myself 
 Sebastian Cabot 
 I'm tired of niggas 
 Niggas is tired 
 You ain't a G 
 I see bitch in your eyes 
 If you close to me 
 You supposed to be 
 But most of you rap niggas is hoes to me 
 Wherever you from 
 The question I ask 
 Is if you think I give a fuck 
 Riddle me that 
 Cause in my hood and you jump into hell and back 
 This industry shit to hell with that 
 I seen 'em come, I seen 'em go 
 I doubt if you can show me somethin' I ain't seen before 
 Who supposed to be in charge? 
 I need to know 
 When I shake your hand I'm a step on your toe 
 Go getcha gun go getcha click 
 I'm a be right here chattin' with your bitch 
 You mad at me 'cause I'm gettin' rich 
 Well put the pistol to your head and empty the clip, pop nigga! 
 If you got love for me I got love for you 
 If you fuck with me I fuck with you 
 We can do it however you wanna do 
 Nigga if you fuck with me I fuck with you 
 Gon' head 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 If I was you I wouldn't fail myself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 Yourself, yourself, yourself 
 If I was you I wouldn't fail myself 
 Attitude 
 I see my heart 
 Feel my pain 
 Some is stars, some is lames 
 How they follow little trends to get they fame 
 I ain't snappin' my damn fingers to get in the game 
 You claim you rich 
 Show me son 
 If you got so many dollas then loan me one 
 Fools think they killas, they own a... 
 When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun 
 Trash your broads behind a bar 
 Like you that dude frontin' hard 
 VIP bands don't make you a star 
 Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are 
 Don't talk behind my back just call me nigga 
 Move my heart to the side 
 Make room to forgive you 
 If you still wanna hang 
 We'll come to getcha 
 Put the rope around your neck and jump my nigga! 
 You're all going to die down here! 
 Get out, get out 
 You can't be in here 
 You're all going to die down here
