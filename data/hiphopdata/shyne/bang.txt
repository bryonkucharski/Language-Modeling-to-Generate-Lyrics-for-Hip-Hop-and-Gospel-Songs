I done fucked *The Baddest Bitches* ask Trina 
 Give her coke to stuff between her, said she loved my demeanor 
 Felonies and misdemeanors, I'm villified 
 I just, rap on the side, black mafia ties 
 Prolific words, I speak for the unheard 
 Niggas who love guns, money, girls, and furs 
 Sittin' up in the man's, runnin' shit 
 On the phone moving bricks, orderin hits 
 Perfected the game, diamond infested the chain 
 Niggas think I change I just wanna watch 'em change 
 Livin' the American dream 
 Drugs, violence, sex, and loaded magazines 
 That's all I could talk about in these sixteen 
 'Cause that's all I live, ask Tibs 
 It is what is, either graveyards or consecutive life bids, shit 
 Niggas wanna bang, we could bang 
 Niggas wanna slang, we could slang 
 Niggas wanna bang we could bang out 
 Till the clip's done, or your vital arteries hang out 
 Ham a cot, Bad Boy, the black Camelot 
 Raise the price and connect the dots 
 Through life's journeys, all I need is a couple of mack mils 
 A couple of mils and good attorneys 
 Skatin on big blades, goin' out in a blaze in my last days 
 I'll probably die with a bad drug trade or an overdose 
 Without tellin' my moms, sorry it was close 
 My wife and my bitch fightin over my notes 
 All my niggas skied north makin' a toast 
 Till hell, just gimme bad bitches in Channel 
 Connects wit, Chinese cartels and that new SL 
 And the judge that's gon' set my bail 
 I'm on top of this shit, look at the wrists 
 Too much rocks in this shit, ain't that a bitch 
 Make hits, till my last breath 
 With that nigga, the P U double F 
 So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot 
 I kill niggas on the spot like a cop 
 I did it all four seasons suites to a cot 
 Give bitches nothing but breathmints and this cock 
 Call me what, there's a way to eat 
 And all we got is sports, entertainment or the streets 
 I'm in deep, think of Citibank when I sleep 
 Ching, ching like I was from Shaolin 
 Brooklyn nigga what you say, keep stylin 
 My air force ones you couldn't walk a mile in 
 I love politics, narcotics, and violins 
 Bad Boy forever, we move in silence
