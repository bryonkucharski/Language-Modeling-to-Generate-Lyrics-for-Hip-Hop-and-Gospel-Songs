The lord is my shepherd 
 Let's get this coke measured 
 And as I walk through the valley of the shadow of gangstas 
 I fears nothin' but God and bein broke 
 I stack paper and flow to fast cars in the presence of my enemies 
 Niggas waitin for me to break 
 Shit, ain't nothin' foldin but my money 
 We them niggas wit big guns and big dicks 
 We afraid of bein broke, so we shed bricks 
 This thing of ours, will never be devoured 
 Bad Boys, we move in silence 
 In the name of power, money, and glory forever and ever 
 Amen.
