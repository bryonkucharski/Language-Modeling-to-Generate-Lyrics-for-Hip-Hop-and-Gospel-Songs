Where it at Where it at 
 Uh 
 (Repeat 3x) 
 Oh you rhyme witta slur and sum shots in his face 
 He rhyme witta slur tryna sound like ma$e 
 Listened to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like Case 
 Maybe I'm juss killin', maybe he juss snitchin 
 See it a whole lot different from my cell in Clinton 
 What I see is straight bug, straight thoro 
 Yeah he be a killa, you kill wit bugs 
 Rather look at the facts not the hype 
 Like who got shot and who got knifed 
 Who keep gettin' struck, but don't neva strike 
 Hope the beef go away but the feds indict 
 I know yo card nigga, it's so clear 
 You juss wanna sell record you don't want warfare 
 You don't wanna ride you wanna get rich and hide 
 These niggaz would've died if they shot me nine times 
 Hey it's juss for the record 
 Take this mob shit serious, please respect it 
 And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart 
 'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart 
 It's murdaaah bloody homicide is what they cry 
 When they losin' their life 
 When muhfuckaz ask me how I sleep at night 
 Pretty cold witta slug with my heat held tight 
 Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like 
 It's my work by the surf when they turn off the lights 
 You ain't kill homi (cide) 'cause if you did 
 Why you ain't get the pen after all of that hit 
 You know I know, that if you live 
 That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody 
 Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut 
 Yoo pac's a nigga, nobody got shot 
 Nobody got flushed, you screamin what what 
 Okay okay killa you's a slut 
 Think about it, enoughs enoughs 
 I'm tryna show 'em who's who 
 And what is what 
 I mean how can I respect you 
 When them niggaz that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you 
 (Not one body) 
 You know where they are, where they perform 
 Bust yo gun, stop makin' songs 
 Please no more ghetto quran 
 You got money now it's time to bomb 
 And that's juss from the top 
 Take this mob shit serious please respect it 
 And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart 
 'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart (X2) 
 Death of perfection as I move witout motion 
 Ain't no nigga in this game doin' the shit that I'm quotin' 
 Take a good look 'cause you'll neva a see enough of me 
 Might be sum otha g's tryna trace 'n' color me 
 But I believe in the ways of old 
 Slice a fools throat tryna tell on po 
 That shouldn't exist, fuckin' snitch 
 Cut of his dick, put it on his lips 
 You really think I was gon' let you slide 
 Fuckin' wit me you must be outcho mind 
 You really think jail was gon' make things right 
 Nigga I will shoot you till you lose yo life 
 I was mindin' my own, word got back, niggaz talkin' bout po 
 I was like oh, god must be ready fo this nigga to go (bye bye bye bye) 
 Gangland this is the mob 
 You got yo break come finish yo job 
 Juss don't get the feds involved 
 And I'mma reunite you wit yo moms 
 Rip 
 I guess this ain't juss music 
 'Cause jail only made me much mo' ruthless (nigga) 
 And the bitch nigga knew this 
 That's why he tryed to sign me to g-unit (naaw) 
 Tell 'em how you made me offers 
 (I don't want that blood I'mma godfather) 
 Jumped on every street corner 
 Hurts yo heart that you don't get that honor 
 The feds I paid fo that 
 10 years up top 
 I sell 'em much shop 
 Both of ya was blood 
 Took the bus wit 'cause 
 Went gun fo gun 
 I earned my lug 
 You, you juss pathetic 
 You neva bg, despite yo efforts 
 Take this mob shit serious, you gon' respect it 
 Tha's juss fo the record 
 And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart 
 'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart 
 It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry 
 When they losin' their life 
 When muhfuckaz ask me how I sleep at night 
 Pretty good witta slug and my heat me tight 
 Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like 
 It's my work by the surf when they turn out the light 
 Turn out the lights lights 
 Turn out the light (4X)
