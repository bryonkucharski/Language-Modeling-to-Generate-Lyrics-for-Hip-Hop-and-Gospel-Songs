They say that I'm euphemism for a new religion 
 I'm praying that my comrades all gonna get up out of Clinton 
 I'm in prison with a system and I'm thinking that I didn't 
 Deserve to be born in the first place cause of my pigment 
 Dark than the Caucasoid complexion kind of different 
 On a Harley David is King David sayin' my tehillin' 
 Pistol in my waste and I'm wrapped in my tefillin' 
 On a camel like an Arab because Ishmael is my siblin' 
 I'm on my own thing, yes Moses 
 I don't part the sea I fly the jet across the ocean 
 Yeah, God's the one that wrote this 
 I'm just an instrument so make sure that you listen in 
 I'm from the block where there ain't no scholarships 
 Forced to do things that if she knew would make my momma sick 
 Larry Hoover was my tutor 
 Now I made tshuva from the king crown of Judah 
 Now I'm running through the trees, I got you all screaming please 
 I slay wicked with my tongue I fire missiles when I breathe 
 I'll give you all one reason to leave me be, before I bring you to your knees 
 With great catastrophes, I cast off shackles as I bleed 
 Some room I need to breathe and blast off as I please 
 With verses of praise that I slay when I sing 
 And a double edge sword that swings low by my knees 
 No need to gas a blow I stay low and then I feed 
 But when the time comes to go, I'm like Rambo 
 I got my cross bow, the cross winds blow 
 I'm so, radio, this wave activation 
 It got me living in slow mo 
 But now I'm ready to blow 
 It's getting hot, I'm heat seeking, fire breathing 
 Believing scriptures that I'm reading while you're wailing at the wall 
 I stand tall, and battle y'all 
 While them Kingdoms fall
