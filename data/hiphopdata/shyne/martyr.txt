(Talking) 
 Shit, sometimes man, a nigga be contemplating, 
 Yo, living in fuckin' hell, nigga die, might be better. 
 Walk through the shadow of death, my dick out pissing 
 Rebel, laughing at the devil, homicidal threats 
 Only if he knew, I wanna lie a coal, who the fuck wanna die old 
 On this miserable earth, forever, put me in dirt 
 It's better then living searchin treasure 
 That only brings atrocity, and treachery, baby mothers stressing me 
 Ain't no hope left in me 
 Live everyday like it's my last 
 Waitin' to meet my niggaz that passed 
 At last I could meet Christ, ask him why the fuck you died on the cross 
 Here these stupid motherfuckers, they still lost 
 I'll ask Malcolm, see what it was like to fight for civil rights 
 And nights he thought he would die, what did he do 
 Did he grab his gun and a bust shot? 
 Get on my knees praise Big and go fuck with Pac 
 Find out did he really take 5 shots 
 Ask him, who shot ya, was it the Feds? 
 Couldn't of been Big Poppa, Brooklyn niggaz ain't braille 
 Like that, ask Martin, why the fuck you ain't fight back 
 If you had a choice, life or death 
 What would you choose 
 If you had a choice 
 Life ain't real it's a dream we see tomorrow 
 Reality, shit that's pain and sorrow 
 Reality, disaster beat breaks, 
 A little girl up in the projects gettin' raped 
 Reality's a nigga gettin' rock shot 41 times 
 And you askin why I run from one time 
 I don't even get justice, 
 Nigga sometimes, no times, oh I'm bout to lose my mind 
 Reality's fucked up, like a hard workin mother, losing her job 
 The battle of good and evil 
 Like the devil, ain't losing for god, we on lucifer's squad 
 Not knowing what the fuck it all mean 
 I can't even, get a can of sardines 
 Niggaz driving bentley's, burning money, I'm yearnin money 
 Taking your shit, I'm earning money 
 Yet you call me a thief I call me a broke nigga trying to eat 
 On this earth suffering, why it's like that 
 Guess we the punished, blame Adam and Eve 
 If you had a choice 
 Hold your latex, from nuns I take sex, 
 Play chess, with the devil from the sky 
 Like rain shells drop immune to this cold world's sorrow 
 Beyond shell shock, can't you tell pop, I need some help ox 
 See them meadow officers watchin' myself rot 
 Ice pick and cell blocks 
 Hope the 12 stop on the highway to hell, switchin lanes 
 Niggaz that know, what I mean to suffer and struggle in the gutter 
 Slice birthday cakes with box cutters 
 I did not stutter, you heard me this is utter, reality 
 Observe me, on a journey puttin' niggaz on gurneys till I meet my maker 
 And I need my ama ? fuck Guiliani and Howard Seiffler 
 If you had a choice
