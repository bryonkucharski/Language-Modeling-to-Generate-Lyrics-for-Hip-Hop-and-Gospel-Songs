(Shyne) 
 In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girl 
 Just walkin' uh - in ya chin chilla fur 
 I was laid up - in the coupe back shade up 
 Lookin' at cha face, just pure wit no make up 
 A little bit a mack lip gloss, hair in a bun well done 
 Lookin' for a ring, I seen none 
 So I hopped out the coupe 
 In hot pursuit 
 To stop and introduce 
 Like I'm Shyne, and you?, you my destiny 
 And ya diamond cluster, to much just to touch ya 
 Perfume down to ya structure 
 Think I'll wait till the 2nd night to fuck ya 
 I wanna marry you, nah I'm just playin' 
 But we can start wit a few nights out in Malibu surfin' 
 Playin' up on Persian 
 Here's my number 
 Put in ya purse and call me 
 Chorus:(Barrington Levy) 
 On the telephone, she heard my voice 
 Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce 
 If my Rolls Royce is not wit ladies 
 Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes 
 If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease 
 Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird 
 If Firebird cannot take the curb 
 Girl take your ass on the damn metro bus 
 (Shyne) 
 I'm gettin' closer 
 My player days is over 
 Well maybe not completely, but stay alarmed 
 Come here huss ya head on my bed 
 And let me get between ya legs 
 Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back 
 Like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that 
 Scream wake the neighbors when they sleep 
 Grab the sheets witcha teeth 
 Wiggle ya butt cheeks 
 Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up 
 Treat you like a convenient store, stick you up 
 Take you to the balcony, pick you up 
 So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin' ya kitty 
 Then we drivin' to the sunset 
 Pull over, get up on the hood ma I ain't done yet 
 (Shyne) (Barrington Levy) 
 We've been together for a few months now 
 Did it all four seasons till the trunk 
 Beverly Hills bungalows 
 In ya underclose 
 In Paris, Eiffel Tower 
 Bubble baths and showers 
 In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seen 
 See me flip a couple things, go to magazines 
 And I - I think you might be the right one whoa (the right one) 
 Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate 
 What I do know - to you it don't matter 
 Whether my pockets is slim or fatter 
 Whether it's BBQs or Mr.Childs platter 
 Even if I slip off the success ladder 
 Even if the paragraphs didn't hit the charts and smash 
 If my car was a train I'd a service it back 
 I think you'll be right there (know you'll be right there) 
 'Cause we right there, yo cardier chaunce 
 Just you in my arms 
 No Sean don, just a bottle of avion 
 Com on uh 
 (Barrington Levy) 
 So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip 
 Should've seen me 'cause I gallop like a horse and get whipped 
 Come quick yeeeeigh, come quick whoooooooiiih 
 'Cause you I love, & not no other 
 Although some may change, but you know I will never 
 I'ma lov I'll love I'll love I'll love I'll love I'll love you forever 
 Eiyaah 
 Always be there - for me 
 Always be there 
 Be there for me 
 WhOh, ayah 
 Ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah 
 Oh 
 For me, for me
