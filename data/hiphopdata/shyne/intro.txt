It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain 
 Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?) 
 And last album, they don't like me to tell this 
 Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!) 
 That's what they tellin' me, switch up your melody 
 Through with misdemeanors, they tryin' to give rappers felonies 
 So they can lock us up one at a time 
 But true writers stay FREE in e'ry one of our lines 
 And if you not feelin' I'm the cream of the crop 
 I'll KNOCK rappers off your list till I get to the top! 
 Still you lookin' at a man that's financially stable 
 Only man gettin' checks cut from four different labels 
 That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts 
 Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as F**K 
 So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody 
 It's 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty 
 Me and Shaka still starvin and lookin' for meals 
 And HEADS UP! Shyne poe is almost out of his deal 
 I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK 
 And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK 
 Mad rappers I hear you talkin' way down at the bottom 
 Though I make big money, still handle small problems 
 The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT SHIT 
 I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT SHIT!
