Speedin' on the highway, gangsta lean 
 One-Sixteen, full steam, kna meen? 
 Bitches on my jock 'cause my flow is hot 
 Spot the watch I got filled with rocks you can see from a block 
 When the light hit, strictly fishscale, fuck that light shit 
 Menage out the garage, double pipe shit 
 Lookin' at her like "Aiyo Ma, I know you likes this" 
 Capital S, capital H, capital Y, capital N, capital E 
 Spit three at his V he survived miraculously 
 Killed the nigga who was layin' in the passengers seat 
 Flow sick, no shit, roll six 
 Head crack, walk the streets with my chain out for frontin' 
 Blow your brains out for nothin' 
 Fuck y'all niggas walkin'?round like y'all sayin' somethin' 
 What y'all know about G4's? 
 SL's with the automatic door 
 Let the automatic pour 
 And kill you niggas who act hard 
 Flee to the Hamps, Atlantic Ocean be my backyard. 
 Boys will be Boys, Bad Boys, Bad Boys 
 Boys will be Boys, Bad Boys, Bad Boys 
 Boys will be Boys, Bad Boys, Bad Boys 
 Boys will be Boys, Bad Boys, Bad Boys 
 Flow like what, princess cut, yellow rocks gleam 
 Respect the team 
 Hands tied, close your eyes, picture me rollin' 
 Gangsta literally holdin' 
 Stacks and Macs 
 I got the greyest jewerly nigga, need the plaques to match 
 To feed my Moms and my team sit back relax 
 Fuckin' with this rap, still I pimp smack 
 Fuck a bitch gap, show me where them bricks at 
 Pants saggin', spazzin' 
 Gucci, with the double G pattern 
 Nigga fuck around, put your stomach in your lap'n 
 Seven-thirty, stay dirty, respect the game 
 Got this shit locked like John T. McLain 
 Get up in that ass like Pamela Lee 
 Shot Clyde, fucked Bonnie, Thelma, and Louise 
 Fuck a dream 
 I got a Seventeen shot magazine that materialize everything to cream. 
 Gangsta life, fuck a block format 
 Put it down for my niggas who hold Macs 
 Sell bricks and catch cases, reload, spray, shoot 
 Half them them state troops 
 And that's word to Jesus' 
 Fracture bones, crack ya dome 
 We don't flash the chrome, we blast ya gone 
 Nevertheless, sell half wet, measure the rest 
 Sniff a little bit so I can mix pleasure with death 
 For my bitches princess cuts and emerald sets 
 American express, uh, whip it out 
 Fuck a price bitch, just pick it out 
 Want a little CLK? deep dish it out? 
 On your car phone headed to your bitches house 
 Pirahda gucci things, Cartier doobie pins 
 You could live, but bet I Indian give 
 Fuck your friend 
 Take your shit back and give her the gems 
 Y'all wear the same size, tell the same lies 
 Got the same cunt, bitch don't front 
 It's the best, who wan' know?
