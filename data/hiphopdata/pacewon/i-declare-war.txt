"Hey listen, I have a record I want you to play 
 Don't you think the kids would enjoy a nice song with a melody?" 
 "What you got, homez?" 
 "It is a rare, one of a kind, original pressing..." 
 This is a world premiere 
 Yo, yo, yo (Pacewon) 
 Yo, yo, yo (Pacewon) 
 (Roc-A-Bloc) yo, yo, yo 
 Yo, yo, Pacer Full clip, one up in the chamber 
 Danger, ask you what you want, what's the flavor? 
 I got thirty-five when I sign with a major 
 Invested twenty-nine point eight, spent the change up 
 Never been the type to take advice from a stranger 
 Gun next to me like my neighbor, stay tough 
 Spit the hot shit to get the paper 
 I roll with more force than Darth Vader, let's see what you made of 
 To hip hop heads, I'm like a saviour 
 Nigga that ball like Big Pun, but don't wanna be a player 
 This year I declare war on the mayor 
 Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya 
 Park your here, spark your fears 
 Man without dog gone care, walk on air 
 Check before I mark your gear, call y'all queers 
 Could rock steady for four more years, all y'all scared 
 Terrorist niggas want to bomb, I'm here 
 Quick to cop, pop me in their cd-rom and stare 
 Even if our cliques don't get along, who care 
 You still be glaring at the clothes me and my crew wear 
 You need to lighten up, digest a few beers 
 Before you end up meeting the man you do fear 
 This year I declare war on the mayor 
 Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya 
 Niggas thought they couldn't be beat, no love 
 Think it's all coming we speak, no sir 
 The fact, that I'm usually deep in most clubs 
 You know it's going down when I'm creepin' close up 
 You non-descript niggas might sneak and throw duds 
 But when the bomb go off, those who sleeping woke up 
 Pacewon, cock my heat back, and blow slugs 
 Making you gangsters with tree and grow bud 
 My Outsider posse meet and show fucks 
 When hip hop was like where we had to grow up 
 This year I declare war on the mayor 
 Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya
