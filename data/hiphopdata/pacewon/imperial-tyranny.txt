I'm disgusted and dissatisfied, I don't need to fucking advertise 
 I'm a thief, I don't read the fucking classifieds 
 I like beef, I don't chitchat and fraternize 
 With police, pastors, or rabbis 
 I'm one of the bad guys, I never apologize 
 I don't just walk around with rocks and pocketknives 
 When it comes to homicide I'm not occupied 
 Murder's like oxygen to carbon dioxide 
 I don't know a lot about science and chemistry 
 My enemies take a lot of time and energy 
 When I'm not shooting I get iron deficiency 
 And I don't wanna have the guys look at me differently 
 I would rather have a gun than an epiphany 
 Can't really rely on tricks and wizardry 
 When I get irrational, that'll be practical 
 Niggas don't believe shit it's serendipity 
 Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all 
 Turn the other way 'cause you wants no part of that 
 Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all 
 Turn the other way 'cause you wants no part of that 
 Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all 
 Turn the other way 'cause you wants no part of that 
 Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all 
 Turn the other way 'cause you wants no part of that 
 Y'all in the presence of divine science 
 We don't subscribe to y'all theory of non-violence 
 I rule with an iron fist, I define tyrants 
 I went down the wrong path, that's despite guidance 
 Yeah and y'all are soon to bleed 
 And I'm from the house of wisdom Haroon Rashid 
 A goon indeed, ras-clat, Junior Reid 
 Y'all overstayed y'all welcome, y'all refused to leave 
 Refuse to see that the universe is deathless 
 I define rhyme with divine mind efforts 
 It's grind time, I design rhyme methods 
 It's high time y'all enshrine my records 
 And I don't know why y'all would fuck with the team 
 That's like standing on the block with no junk for the fiends 
 Pazienza is in love with the deen 
 I would jump in front of bullets, shed fucking blood for my team 
 Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that 
 Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that 
 Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that 
 Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that 
 I know what violence begets, timeless regrets 
 Silently sweat bullets when you ride for respect 
 Rivalry met with the vibe you'd expect 
 Four-pounder makes you flounder only live on the net 
 You know the Internet thuggery, Internet fuck with me 
 Long enough to see my company sucker-free luckily 
 Paz heard me then scooped me, spaz early [?] 
 Clash [?] smash [?] 
 The last rapper to move me Ras Kass what he doing 
 Rap after the blood bath having a movie 
 Gats strapped to my blue jeans, [?] 
 Backpackers with Uzis, Black Sabbath and Kool G 
 Point made like I'm sharper than the shit 
 Stab wound where you think you sharper than you is 
 Charlotte's Web with the kids, only time we talk to pigs 
 I ain't talking courage when I say you getting jigged 
 'Cause you wants no part of that 
 'Cause you wants no part of that 
 'Cause you wants no part of that 
 'Cause you wants no part of that
