What we be tellin' these cats? Yo, yo. "Step up, nigga" 
 --Step Up-- *echoes* All them niggaz out there 
 Tellin' on all them niggaz violatin STEP UP 
 (Verse One) 
 Yo, yo; from the Himalays to the pyramids of Egypt 
 Pace Won flow is dumb as Forest Gump weeded 
 Lynch Mob's, Hit Squad's then I freak with 
 More Golddiggers than E or PMD did 
 (Ha!) Word like so many hoochies on my penis 
 By the time I'm twenty-nine I have more Suns than Phoenix 
 Watch the man bust, pose for the cameras 
 And have reporters running back like Barry Sanders 
 (Yo!) My habits is spray paint (tsss) and rap fresh 
 Pace Won gets more bank than NatWest 
 Walkin' 'round thinkin' which face to slap next 
 Like Latifah my Wrath is Madness 
 Ho-ha, more smooth than Billy D. 
 Drinkin' Colt 45 eyes slant like Philippines 
 Serve the baseheads, my raps kill the fiends 
 That wanna MC but don't know what it means 
 People wanna act large but can't take charge 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; Kids ask me for advice Pace on how to be nice 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If I see your sister cryin or fallin' behind 
 I tell her --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef 
 Then you can --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo, Bring 'em all, yo-yo 
 (Verse Two) 
 Since my small days always been real 
 With raps that's more fat than that ass on Kim Fields 
 I'm roastin roaches, poets think I'm Moses 
 Partin oceans, people feel me like emotions 
 Poet of truth, roll with the jewels 
 Voice of the youth (uh) 
 One a ya diehard boys that'll shoot - keep my rep up, 
 Rappers want somethin' tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 People wanna act large but can't take charge 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; Kids ask me for advice, yo, how to be nice 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If I see your sister cryin or fallin' behind 
 I tell her --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef 
 Then y'all can --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 (Verse Three) 
 Yo, yo; You look soft, I hook off and kick butt 
 Attack like Hitler, if your boys weak avoid me like I was thicker 
 Rollin' with the rich kids 
 Slick like the mac of the year, I know bitches 
 They bite you, scratch you, kick you in the groin 
 A two-headed coin that be makin' people point (look) 
 And talk soft, but I walked off, I'll remember 
 Defender of my people, makin' legal tender 
 Got it made, no more goin' to court now 
 I'm out doin' the world while my brother hold the fort down 
 He said, "Pace slit the wrist if the cross you" 
 When your hands is tied, you're only doin' what your forced to 
 Don't hate the Pace Won just cause my records sellin 
 Find a playa hater and I tell'im 
 People wanna act large but can't take charge 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; Kids ask me for advice Pace on how to be nice 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If I see your sister cryin or fallin' behind 
 I tell her --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef 
 Y'all can --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 One more time... bust it... yo 
 Act large but can't take charge 
 Tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, them little niggas ask me for advice on how to be nice 
 I tell 'em --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If I see a sister weepin' or sleepin' 
 I tell her --Step Up-- *echoes* 
 Yo, yo; If you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef 
 You can --Step Up-- *echoes*
