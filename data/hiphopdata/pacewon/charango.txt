 Yo' 
 Pull up in a all black 528 (errrr) 
 Fly new paint 
 Drive threw states 
 While you a'int 
 Can't get props 'cause your styles to fake 
 Try new thing 
 Rap like me 
 Dance like d 
 One more chance like biggy 
 Easy coast rock 
 Beats don't stop 
 Niggaz fall off mad teams go pop 
 Swing like spiderman and wall creaper 
 Pace won rocks them all the tall creature 
 You don't like me 
 I ain't feelin' y'all neither 
 Y'all need to roll your blunts with morcheeba 
 This is how the east coast rocks 
 This is how pace won rocks 
 This is how the east coast rocks 
 This is how mj rocks 
 This is how pace won rocks
