Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox 
 And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box 
 'Cause I'm Shanti and why'all know the routine 
 And here we go again, so all hail the queen 
 I left you for a while but it was worth the wait 
 Because it gave me just enough time to create 
 A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world 
 Have the party people screamin' out "Go on Girl!" 
 Just like Diana Ross I'm the boss 
 And those who disapprove you can go for yours 
 But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take 
 You should treat me like Nell Carter, Give Me a Break 
 'Cause I'm the super female that's called Shanti 
 And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away 
 Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play 
 So you best go about your way and have a nice day... 
 A lotta MC's today really know how to please 
 But I gave birth to most of them MC's 
 So when it comes around to the month of May 
 Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day 
 Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this 
 I'm Shanti the microphone grandmistress 
 A pioneer like Lola Folana 
 With a name that stands big like Madonna 
 Speakin' of Madonna some girls on the mic 
 Rap like virgins and get real tight 
 But I get loose with the rhymes I produce 
 That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice 
 'Cause I'm the super female that's called Shanti 
 And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away 
 Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play 
 So you best go about your way and have a nice day... 
 Shanti, the baddest around 
 And a name like that can be broken down 
 As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent 
 And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it 
 'Cause to me there ain't nuttin' fresher 
 For me to rock... my pleasure 
 I'll pick up the microphone and start rockin' 
 Say the funky rhymes that have the people clockin'... 
 Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E 
 Good lookin', never took'n female MC 
 I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger 
 Brown skin complexion with a nice figure 
 Yes, the super female that's called Shanti 
 And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away 
 Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play 
 So you best go about your way and have a nice day... 
 You may remember the voice from a few years ago 
 When I first came out and dissed UTFO 
 I chilled for a while, I put down my pen 
 But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again 
 Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down 
 Just a featherweight crew from that part of town 
 You made a little record and then you start frontin' 
 Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nuttin' 
 Now KRS-ONE you should go on vacation 
 With that name soundin' like a wack radio station 
 And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed 
 When T La Rock said "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name 
 So step back peasants, poppin' all that junk 
 Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks 
 'Cause I'm an All-Star just like Julius Erving 
 And Roxanne Shanti is only good for steady servin'
