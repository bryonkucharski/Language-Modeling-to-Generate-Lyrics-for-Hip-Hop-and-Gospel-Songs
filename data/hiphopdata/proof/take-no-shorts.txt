What you all about 
 (?) Call out 
 Knock'em all out 
 Real niggaz pull your mouth out 
 Punch your grill in 
 How you feelin' this is our house 
 Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' 'bout 
 Sick notes takes no shorts from no one 
 Sick notes takes no shorts from no one 
 (Bakarak) 
 Niggaz don't want to get me pissed 
 Have you waving at your people without no wrist 
 Only Nigga you know won't drink chrizz 
 For dumb niggaz I got 2 sticks and fists 
 It ain't a crew out there that could fuck with this 
 I'm Devilsish, like demon 
 Quick to bust guns and a semem 
 Ain't childish rapper with all that blingin 
 My style ain't gonna switch from rap to singin' 
 But I might rap a strangle 
 Any rap nigga I'm angle get buried 
 Give a fuck if he got kids and married 
 Shit trien to make my day, like my name was Dirty Harry 
 If the industry was a movie, I'll make the game scary 
 First nigga to put the world in the bitchuary 
 I'm the type to beat you in the face with sticks like drums and it'll 
 Sound like (Uh Uh Uh!) 
 (Jus Bounce) 
 First off, my flows is crucial 
 And the brain sergeon sayed I had the nerves to shoot you 
 Catch you in the street and front you out 
 (????????) Stomp you out 
 I'm crazy in the mouth like pac and juice 
 Catch you at the liquor store, cock and let loose 
 Make your face resemble a fruit loop 
 Have you (???????) 
 Trien' to tempt me is risky, mighty gutsy 
 Ask Dstout about Puffy 
 So when I tell you this shit trust me 
 It's not in your best interest 
 To be on my shitlist 
 Its really senceless 
 They get beat senceless 
 Change your name and relocate the menthous 
 The only way they know who you is, is by the dentist 
 (Dogmatic) 
 Fo' real, I'm the first nigga to yell "313" 
 Since 19 mother fucking 93 
 Check my stats, I'm comin' all over the track 
 Smack you in the back with some 8 Mile matic attack 
 Shit I killed K-Stone, as a matter a fact 
 We ain't forgot, Sicknotes shit be hot 
 I'm wide open like a spot you must be smoke rocks to the bit in that you 
 Can stop the matic from reachin' top 
 Beat you with a sock, stuff the combination locks 
 If I ever saw trien to open my lock 
 Kevin's all stock, nothin' unofficial 
 You can never catch me without the clip in my pistol 
 (Proof) 
 Power and PAM publics position 
 Proof beside pioneers, poetic prison 
 Pin point periodic poison playin' Picasso so 
 Perfect punk and perverted pust poe 
 Playin' punished shit to peers, or any prick 
 Passively push pain, punks panic and run frantic 
 Don't giva a fuck like minni small whores 
 Stick a mic in your paw like the dog wars 
 For the last be Boys skip here like astroids 
 Skip up on your crew, 1 by 1, blast you boys 
 Set the pool on fire (???????) 
 This year a lot of bitch ass MC's gonna die-a
