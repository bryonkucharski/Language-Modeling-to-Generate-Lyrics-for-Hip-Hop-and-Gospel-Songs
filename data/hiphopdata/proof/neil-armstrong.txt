Ayo, this motherfucker's taking the fun out of rap 
 Imma do what I wanna do, fuck it 
 That don't even count no more, commercialism 
 To do yourself no more 
 But fuck it, know what I'm sayin' 
 Imma do me, ya know I'm sayin' 
 I don't need the billboards 
 Nah, not at all 
 Better watch for me, people gon' find me where I be at 
 The other one (Derty Harry, Big Proof) 
 Spit flames, nicknames, Derty Harry 
 Big fame, twists brains, very scary 
 Hood nigga, hits better, better than y'all 
 Run up, get gunned up for your cheddar and all 
 Rob dealaz, pop kilos, coco flo-ur 
 No broth, throw a ripe hook like Biboa 
 Butt me, touch me die on the mac 
 Turn your mike upply, lying on your back 
 Black jews, tattoos, that attack you 
 Stand raw 
 Rob your Grandma at a raffle 
 She'a lie like hindsight, I want more 
 Crime write when I rhyme right, it's all raw 
 Fuck naw, hate pop, gimme my plaque 
 Bust jaws, wait stop, it's plenty whack 
 Niggas with cells, so they sell in their cells 
 Melons are swell 
 Oh well, I'll see you in Hell 
 Space Odyssey! 
 I don't know what you've been told 
 Cross over, rappers hit me, oh! 
 My beliefs will never fold 
 I will not sell my soul (x2) 
 Hip hop out 
 Drop out, no school 
 In fascinations and lacerations, assassinations 
 Threw, broke two 
 So cool, D12, we shall bank on y'all 
 No gold for rappin', man, platinum hang on walls 
 Ain't no bitch in me 
 You empty one clip, I empty three 
 Pop more than MTV 
 Lay a beat down, without an MPC 
 Them killaz in ya face, they were sent by me 
 No sympathy, tell ya kids, in ya face, it was meant to be 
 Big Proof, spit truth, never a lie 
 No individual get loose, better than I 
 Forever we high 
 Sly, but we never slurrin' my words 
 Occur in the nerves 
 I'm high? Fine 
 Bionic Super-Trooper with stamina 
 My antennas sense pussy in my parameter 
 The Janitor 
 I clean houses, in the meanwhile 
 *This is Guillotine Style* 
 Ain't nuttin' but dope in here 
 Like a fiend's mouth 
 Space Odyssey 
 I don't know what you've been told 
 Cross over, rappers hit me, oh! 
 My beliefs will never fold 
 I will not sell my soul (x2) 
 Pimpness, bitch, press, stage an' all 
 Glock fetish, hot-headed, throw a rage and brawl 
 Like Asian broad, y'all sucky sucky 
 My skills nocturnal, they super ugly 
 Y'all are fictional, I spit the real 
 I'm difficult 
 The White Sniff Inhale 
 Thug creature, teacher 
 Fill you with rap 
 Send rocks with my palm, nigga 
 And just mail you a slap 
 Smack! You won't listen, no joke 
 Please say that ain't roll 'fore your heart get broke 
 Shroom music, humour's Chasm's and Proof's 
 2 minutes and you finished, Mr. God-in-the-Booth 
 Lies to the youth, and just lies to the use 
 Fuck the truth, pass the boo 
 I'm tryna get high wit' you 
 I'll tell anyone before you got the gun n' draw 
 Y'all kill me cause rap ain't fun no more 
 Space Odyssey 
 I don't know what you've been told 
 Cross over, rappers hit me, oh! 
 My beliefs will never fold 
 I will not sell my soul (x2)
