Let me tell you about my Girlfriend, 
 My Girlfriend Mona Lisa, 
 She Let Somebody Take Her Picture, 
 So She Could Be a Fashionista 
 She says she wanna be a Model 
 But what she wanna be a Model for, 
 She told me that she wanna Travel

 But I Tell her that I Loved Her, Adored Her, I Need Her, My Lisa 
 She told me Trust Her, I Won't, I Wanna Trust Her 
 And I Dunno why it Hurts Me Hurts Me Hurts Me

 All the Fellas they be Looking Looking Looking, 
 They Lookin' at My Lisa Lisa Lisa
