Lord come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 SOS, help us out 
 Looking all around and I'm watching the world 
 People killing, people dying, people lying, people blind 
 People don't see the sign, watching money all the time 
 Get the pennies, get the dimes, get the dollars is the mindstate 
 Of the human race, people on the paper chase 
 The environment is fragile, and we been on the gradual 
 Declining in a lifetime or lose the battle 
 Get burned by volcanoes, get blown by tornadoes 
 Cause mother nature signals, is trying to warn NATO 
 We got a new terror threat, it's called the weather 
 More deadlier than chemical and nuclear together 
 It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 Jesus, or Buddha, somebody come and help us out 
 Lord come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 SOS, help us out 
 Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing 
 Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging 
 The world is dying 
 And if they say it's gonna be all right, them people are lying 
 People trapped behind the gates, ignorance in their state of mind 
 'Cause they formulate a plan just to penetrate us 
 You see they stimulate us with fear, manipulate us 
 Each year, they dominate dividing us like calculators 
 And we can't add it up cause calculators do the math for us 
 And here they come choppering down, chopping down our rainforest 
 Fucking up our air for us, they don't really care for us 
 But we can't complain, because the only one to blame is us 
 The gas is rising up but we keep on filling up 
 CO2 levels got the whole planet heated up 
 It's blazing in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 Mohammed, Jehovah, somebody come and help us out 
 Lord come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 SOS, help us out 
 Looks like we ain't gon' figure it out 
 Lord come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 SOS, help us out 
 Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing 
 Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging 
 The world is ending 
 And if they say it's gonna be okay, they just pretending 
 When the eskimo gets bit by a mosquito 
 Somebody in Miami will get swept by a tsunami 
 Rastas in Jamaica will get hit by a quake that 
 Registers something like 8.8 
 You see it's situations happening with our planet 
 Cause, 50 years ago we took it for granted 
 We should have took advantage, and reversed the damage 
 Instead of just pumping and selling and slanging the gas 
 And while we purchased the gas 
 We was watching soap operas while they steady brainwashed the masses 
 'Cause we could make a vehicle that runs off ashes 
 But they own a patent for that, and that's exactly what's happening 
 Corruption and bullshit politics 
 The planet's gonna die cause of bullshit politics 
 It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 And ain't nobody coming to the rescue to help the
