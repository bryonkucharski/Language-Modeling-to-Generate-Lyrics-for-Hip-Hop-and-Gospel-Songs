Get up and dance to the music 
 Get on up and dance to the fonky music 
 Dance to the music, dance to the music 
 Hey Greg, what? 
 All we need is a drummer 
 For people who only need a beat 
 I'm gonna add a little guitar 
 And make it easy to move your feet 
 I'm gonna add some bottom 
 So that the dancers just won't hide 
 You might like to hear my organ 
 Playing 'Ride Sally Ride' 
 You might like to hear the horns blowin' 
 Cynthia on the throne, yeah 
 Cynthia and Jerry got a message they're sayin' 
 All the squares, go home 
 Dance to the music, dance to the music
