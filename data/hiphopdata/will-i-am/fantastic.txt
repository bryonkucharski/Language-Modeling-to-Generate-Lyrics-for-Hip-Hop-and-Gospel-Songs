I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm al... 
 Nine years of lovin' you, that's now flushed down the drain 
 Six years with a bundle of joy, the last two was the pain 
 Too immature to handle love, we was just playin' games 
 You used to say I was your everything, now you can't say my name 
 I never thought that I could survive, without you in my life 
 If you was wonderin' about how I'm doin', baby I'm doin' all right 
 But it don't even look like you would cry, if I was to up and die 
 Die tomorrow, uh-huh-uh, but that's all right gi-irrrl, cause 
 I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm al... 
 Don't even worry 'bout me 
 Don't even worry 'bout me 
 I'm doin' good now, doin' super baby 
 Don't even worry 'bout me, I'm super duper baby 
 I'm doin' good now, yeah 
 Six months and a couple of weeks and not one call from you girl 
 Three months after we broke down, I moved up in the world 
 I wanna know what's goin' on, what's goin' on in your life 
 I know it's really hard to be my friend, when you were gon' be my wife 
 We used to love our relationship, but now we just can't relate 
 I understand why you had to go and change your, love for me into hate 
 And that's why I believe you wouldn't cry, if I was to up and die 
 Die tomorrow, uh-huh-uh, but that's all right gi-irrrl, 'cause 
 I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm fantastic 
 I'm al... 
 Don't even worry 'bout me 
 Don't even worry 'bout me 
 I'm doin' good now, super duper baby 
 I'm doin' good now, I'm fantastic 
 Fantastic, yeah
