I met a guy at the club, 
 I let him know I'm in love, 
 I met a girl at the bar, 
 I let her know who you are. 
 I told her you are the love of my life and, 
 One day your gonna be my wife. 
 And we are gonna have some babies together. 
 I told him you are the man of my dreams, 
 You saved me from drowning in the streams 
 And I know were really gonna last forever. (and ever) 
 It was those 3 words that saved my life. 
 It wasn't complicated, wasn't premeditated. 
 It wasn't under-rated, boy I'm so glad you stayed and
