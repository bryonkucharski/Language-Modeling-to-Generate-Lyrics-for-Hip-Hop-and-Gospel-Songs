(Intro: will.i.am) 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) word 
 (Fergie) 
 This is how we roll, when we mash out 
 There's no time for tantrum 
 {"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}} 
 (MC Lyte) 
 Yeah, I, am, that fly girl 
 Can't deny girl, nothin' I won't try one type of girl 
 Well maybe not coke, 'cause I'm dope already 
 Lyrics sharp like dart and cut like machetes 
 And I'm rockin' the shit steady 
 Like no doubt, the show's sold out 
 They know how I rolled in when I rolled out 
 Black Eyed Pea, L-Y-T 
 Slide through them bars, leave the track greasy 
 It's easy, I flow through the beat breezy 
 Hate, they used to tease me, now they wanna be me 
 Lyte's in the building, of course I'm back 
 Get that booty stuck like a cul-de-sac 
 I'm the all knowing like the almanac 
 And though your boy keep callin, I ain't callin him back 
 Uh-uh 
 (Chorus: Fergie) 
 This is how we roll, when we mash out 
 There's no time for tantrum 
 Only time of dancin, it's the party anthem 
 I call Lyte so we could mash out 
 I swooped her up and then we mashed out 
 We stepped in the club to turn the party out 
 I took some flicks and poked my ass out 
 This is how we roll, when we mash out 
 There's no time for tantrum 
 {"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}} 
 (Fergie) 
 Fergie Ferg from the burbs, keepin' shit flyer than birds 
 Concierge, valet, pulls my ride up to the curb 
 I step in the door, I said it, so listen 
 Me and MC Lyte takin' you out on a mission 
 Like a space shuttle, me and my girls huddle 
 Get back to the crib, bathtubs filled with bubble 
 Champagne, caviar, for Hollywood rock stars 
 Back on the road, them mess with {?} bar 
 F-E-R, G-I, E 
 F-E-R, to the, G 
 (Will.i.am) 
 Fergie Ferg rock hard most definitely 
 On the M-I, C with L-Y-T 
 (Chorus: Fergie) 
 I call Lyte so we could mash out 
 I swooped her up and then we mashed out 
 We stepped in the club to turn the party out 
 I took some flicks and poked my ass out 
 This is how we roll, when we mash out 
 There's no time for tantrum 
 Only time of dancin', it's the party anthem 
 (Will.i.am) 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now 
 Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) word 
 To all the cool chickens, center stage on the mic 
 We puttin' it on wax, it's the NEEEEEW STYLE~! 
 Four and three and two and one 
 And when I'm on the mic, the honies come 
 I shoot the shit without a gun 
 The rhymes I rock are more than +Action+ 
 Nothin' but that, that satisfaction 
 Action-packed like Action Jackson 
 Stand back cat, here come that blastin 
 Blastin from no other than will.i.am 
 (Outro: Fergie) 
 This is how we roll, when we mash out 
 There's no time for tantrum 
 {"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}}
