Advice for the young at heart 
 Soon we will be older 
 When we gonna make it work? 
 Too many people living in a secret world 
 While they play mothers and fathers 
 We play little boys and girls 
 When we gonna make it work? 
 I could be happy 
 I could be quite naive 
 It's only me and my shadows 
 Happy in our make believe 
 Soon... 
 And with the hounds at bay 
 I'll call your bluff 
 'Cause it would be okay 
 To walk on tiptoes everyday 
 And when I think of you and all the love that's due 
 I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand 
 'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise 
 We've got the whole wide world in our hands

 Love is a souvenir 
 Once given 
 Never forgotten, never let it disappear 
 This could be our last chance 
 When we gonna make it work? 
 Working hour is over 
 And how it makes me weep 
 'Cause someone sent my soul to sleep 
 And when I think of you and all the love that's due 
 I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand 
 'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise 
 We've got the whole wide world in our hands

 Anything that we feel like doing
