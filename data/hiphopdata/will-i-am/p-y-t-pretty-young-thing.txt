Where did you come from lady 
 And ooh won't you take me there 
 Right away won't you baby 
 Tendoroni you've got to be 
 Spark my nature 
 Sugar fly with me 
 Don't you know now 
 Is the perfect time 
 We can make it right 
 Hit the city lights 
 Then tonight ease the lovin' pain 
 Let me take you to the max 
 I want to love you (P-Y-T) 
 Pretty young thing 
 You need some lovin' (T-L-C) 
 Tender lovin' care 
 And I'll take you there 
 I want to love you (P-Y-T) 
 Pretty young thing 
 You need some lovin' (T-L-C) 
 Tender lovin' care 
 And I'll take you there 
 (Anywhere you want to go) 
 Nothin' can stop this burnin' 
 Desire to be with you 
 Gotta get to you baby 
 Won't you come, it's emergency 
 Cool my fire yearnin' 
 Honey, come set me free 
 Don't you know now is the perfect time 
 We can dim the lights 
 Just to make it right 
 In the night 
 Hit the lovin' spot 
 I'll give you all that I've got 
 Pretty young things, repeat after me 
 I said, 
 I said na na na na na 
 I'll take you there
