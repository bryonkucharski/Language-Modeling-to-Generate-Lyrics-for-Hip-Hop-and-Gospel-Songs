(Four, tres, two, uno) 
 (Will I Am) 
 Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it 
 The beat that I'm bangin' is de-li-cious 
 (Fergie) 
 Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco 
 They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo 
 You could see me, you can't squeeze me 
 I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy 
 I got reasons why I tease 'em 
 Boys just come and go like seasons 
 Fergalicious (so delicious) 
 But I ain't promiscuous 
 And if you was suspicious 
 All that shit is fictitious 
 I blow kisses (mwah) 
 That puts them boys on rock, rock 
 And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno) 
 So delicious (It's hot, hot) 
 So delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock) 
 So delicious (They wanna taste of what I got) 
 I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty) 
 (Fergie) 
 Fergalicious def-, fergalicious def-, fergalicious def... 
 Fergalicious definition make them boys go crazy 
 They always claim they know me 
 Comin' to me, callin' me Stacy (Hey, Stacy) 
 I'm the F to the E, R, G the I the E 
 And can't no other lady put it down like me 
 I'm Fergalicious (so delicious) 
 My body stay vicious 
 I be up in the gym just working on my fitness 
 He's my witness (oh, wee) 
 I put yo' boy on rock, rock 
 And he be lining down the block just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno) 
 So delicious (It's hot, hot) 
 So delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock) 
 So delicious (They wanna taste of what I got) 
 I'm Fergalicious (hold, hold, hold up, check it out) 
 (Vamp) 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 If you really want me 
 Honey, get some patience 
 Maybe then you'll get a taste 
 I'll be tasty, tasty 
 I'll be laced with lacy 
 It's so tasty, tasty 
 It'll make you crazy 
 (Will I Am)

 All the time I turn around brothas gather round 
 Always looking at me up and down looking at my (uh) 
 I just wanna say it 
 Now, I ain't tryin' to round up drama, little mama 
 I don't wanna take your man 
 And I know I'm comin' off just a little bit conceited 
 And I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it 
 But I'm tryin' to tell that I can't be treated like clientele 
 'Cause they say she 
 Delicious (so delicious) 
 But I ain't promiscuous 
 And if you was suspicious 
 All that shit is fictitious 
 I blow kisses (mwah) 
 That puts them boys on rock, rock 
 And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got (got, got, got) 
 Four, tres, two, uno
