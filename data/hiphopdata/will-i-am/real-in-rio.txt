Beginning 
 All the birds of a feather 
 Do what they love most of all 
 We are the best at rhythm and laughter 
 That's why we love carnival 
 Possibly we can sing too 
 Sun and beaches, they coo 
 Dance to the music, passion and love 
 Show us the best you can do 
 Everyone here is on fire 
 Get up and join in the fun 
 Dance with a stranger, romance and danger 
 Magic could happen for real in Rio 
 All by itself, you can't see it coming 
 You can't find it anywhere else 
 It's real in Rio, know something else 
 You can feel it happen, you can feel it all by yourself 
 Ending 
 All the birds of a feather 
 Do what they love most of all 
 Moon and the stars, sun and guitars 
 That's why we love carnival 
 Loving our life in the jungle 
 Everything's wild and free 
 Never alone 'cause this is our home 
 Magic can happen for real in Rio 
 All by itself, you can't see it coming 
 You can't find it anywhere else 
 I'm a kako wero kinga 5x 
 Birds like me 'cause I'm a hot winga 
 There's your hot winga 
 Here everybody loves samba, I like the samba 
 Rhythm you feel in your heart, I'm the samba master 
 Beauty and love, what more could you want? 
 Everything can be for real in Rio 
 Here's something else 
 You just feel it happening 
 You won't find it anywhere else
