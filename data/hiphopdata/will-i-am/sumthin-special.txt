[Intro: will.i.am] (Dante) 
 You're sumthin' special baby (you're sumthin' special) 
 You're my special lady (you're very special) 
 You're so incredible baby (you're so incredible) 
 You're sumthin' special 
 (Dante Santiago) 
 Your eyes, your vibe, they hypnotize me 
 From the second I saw you girl, I couldn't deny it 
 How you talk, your walk, your style is gracious 
 Havin' dreams of takin' you off to some tropical places 
 Exotic, erotic, just filled with passion 
 In bed is the only time that we would be clashin 
 You're honest, loyal, a heaven-sent blessing 
 Not tryna run you drag, I just had to confess it 
 Your scent, your lips, I love when you smile 
 I want to be chillin' witchu for more than a while 
 For days, months, years, and lifetime 
 You're so incredible, it's so special you're mine 
 Your mind, body, and soul is addictive 
 I can't complain 'cause you're the type I'd LOVE to have kids with 
 How you move and dance, when you're feelin' the groove 
 And when we dim the lights you do that thing that you do 
 (Pre-Chorus: Niu) 
 You're the type of girl that I just wanna be down 
 And baby girl I'm lettin you know I'm feelin' yo' style 
 And if you feel the same way, then tell me now 
 And girl don't waste no time so we can do it, do it 
 (Chorus: will.i.am) 
 You're sumthin' special baby 
 You're my special lady 
 You're so incredible baby 
 You're sumthin' special 
 You're sumthin' special baby 
 You're my special lady 
 You're so incredible baby 
 You're sumthin' special 
 (Dante Santiago) 
 You're one in a million, you and I should be building 
 Our sand castles of love to the stars above 
 And fill it up with our children, spend eternity chillin' 
 On deserted island, slow tunes and violins 
 I wanna show you just how anxious I've been 
 To tell the whole world, to HELL with my friends 
 It's me and you girl, until the whole world ends 
 I'ma stand by you as you stand by your man 
 'Cause when we together, I'm feelin' nothin' but pleasure 
 Most of these couples now don't have what we treasure 
 You're my earth, my moon, the wind, and the sky 
 The apple of my eye, you're my natural high 
 Your hair, your hips, your creamy-ass thighs 
 I pray to God that you don't end up passin me by 
 Are you down, with me even through the hard times? 
 Let's make this happen girl, you're a one of a kind 
 (Pre-Chorus + Chorus) 
 (Taboo) 
 Looka here, baby girl, you are my world 
 When I see you walk by, my head'll surely swirl 
 Over to the right side, who made that eye connection? 
 Satisfying thought when nastiness upon my section 
 Checkin' out my eyes just to see if I'm a (real man) 
 No need for you to worry, I'ma give you sexual (healing) 
 You need some understanding, I need some understanding 
 Together as a team if we are locos puffin {?} 
 Style and finesse 'em, boots match your dressing 
 You are made for me, there's no doubt, no question 
 Damn it feels good to see baby up on it 
 It's a special love and I gave you what you wanted like... 
 (Pre-Chorus + Chorus)
