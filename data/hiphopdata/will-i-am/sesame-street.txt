If what I am is what's in me 
 Then I'll stay strong - that's who I'll be 
 And I will always be the best 
 "Me" that I can be. 
 There's only one me, I am it 
 Have a dream I'll follow it 
 It's up to me to try. 
 Oh! I'm a keep my head up high 
 Keep on reaching high 
 Never gonna quit 
 I'll be getting stronger. 
 And nothing's gonna bring me down (no!) 
 Never gonna stop, gotta go. 
 Because I know 
 I'll keep getting stronger. 
 And what I am is thoughtful 
 What I am is musical 
 What I am is smart 
 And what I am is brave 
 What I am is helpful 
 What I am is special 
 There's nothing I can't achieve. 
 Because in myself I believe in oh... 
 Gonna keep our heads up high 
 Keep on reaching high 
 Never gonna quit 
 Just keep getting stronger. 
 And nothing's gonna bring us down (no!) 
 Never give it up, gotta go. 
 Because I know 
 I'll keep getting stronger. 
 What I am is super 
 What I am is proud 
 What I am is friendly 
 What I am is grouchy 
 What you are is magical 
 What you are is special 
 There's nothing I can't achieve. 
 Because in myself I believe in oh... 
 Gonna hold my head up high 
 Keep on reaching high 
 Never gonna stop 
 I'll be getting stronger. 
 Nothing's gonna bring me down (no!) 
 Never give it up gotta go, oh... yeah... 
 I'll keep getting strong--er.
