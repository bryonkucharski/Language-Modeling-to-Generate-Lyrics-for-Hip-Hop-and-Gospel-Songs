Yo, I had a hell of a night 
 I was out of my mind 
 Turned up I was high as a kite 
 A jolly fellow 
 I was showing my bright whites 
 And getting trippy under the strobe lights 
 I'm loving the nightlife 
 And getting jiggy keeping the vibe right 
 Setting my mind a light 
 Getting the party hype 
 Pretty little thing in my eyesight, 
 She's my type 
 Something's telling me 
 She ain't uptight 
 She's giving me the eyes like 
 What are you waiting for 
 I'm looking at her back like 
 Cool say no more 
 I save my jaw but I ain't playing 
 Are you fucking me? 
 I'm saying it raw 
 She didn't take no offence 
 I was straight in the door 
 I guess I hit her with an offer 
 That she couldn't ignore 
 It all happened so fast 
 Like I met her before 
 But I was so damn high 
 How could I be sure 
 Now we're in my hotel room taking a tour 
 Let's get into something really bad 
 Love me baby love me love me bad 
 I love it when the good girls act so bad 
 I love it when the bad girls do it like that 
 Let's get into something really bad 
 Love me baby love me love me bad 
 I love it when the good girls act so bad 
 I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like that 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Now it's totally on 
 Pour a couple more drinks 
 Put some Jodeci on 
 Put a towel under the door 
 And put the privacy on 
 We're stinking up the whole place 
 The weed's overly strong 
 We should be getting undressed 
 Now take off your thong 
 I'll help you with your bra strap 
 And then I hit you with the long and the strong 
 And you can make as much noise 
 Till your vocals are gone 
 It feels right 'cause it's totally wrong 
 But we're just living the good life 
 Like everyone should, right? 
 I'm giving her good pipe, 
 We're having a good night 
 I'm pretty sure one day 
 She'll be a good wife 
 And that's a good luck 
 But it's not in my foresight 
 But that don't matter now, 
 We're gonna fuck till the sunlight 
 I hit her from the back 
 Now I'm gripping the bumper tight 
 Whole lot of banging 
 I ain't bragging 
 You would think it's a gunfight 
 I'm happy that you've come 
 Now give me the light 
 Let's get into something really bad 
 Love me baby love me love me bad 
 I love it when the good girls act so bad 
 I love it when the bad girls do it like that 
 Let's get into something really bad 
 Love me baby love me love me bad 
 I love it when the good girls act so bad 
 I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like that 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Yo I come clean 
 You can swallow you ain't gotta spit 
 And you ain't gotta go home 
 But I gotta split 
 And if it's all the same 
 I'm really glad you came 
 You kept me entertained 
 I weren't doin' shit 
 I got a couple things 
 That I gotta do today 
 But I'm great and I'm really glad 
 I woke up with you today 
 I probably said a couple things 
 I don't usually say 
 And I know you're not a hoe 
 You don't usually play 
 You would never just leave 
 You would usually stay 
 Never had a one night stand 
 That's okay 
 Ain't got to explain 
 Nothing wrong with sharing long 
 It's just an exchange 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Get freaky, let's get freaky 
 Let's get into something really bad 
 Love me baby love me love me bad 
 I love it when the good girls act so bad 
 I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like bad 
 Bad, bad, bad, bad
