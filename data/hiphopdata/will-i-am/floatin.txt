Floatin', floatin' 
 Floatin', floatin' 
 Floatin', floatin' 
 Chalie wilson in the house 
 Floatin', floatin' 
 Jt 
 Floatin', floatin' 
 Will.i.am 
 Floatin', floatin' 
 Talk to me 
 I, I'm not sure just how to say this for you 
 The words just don't come out right 
 But that doesn't mean that I don't feel somethin' for ya 
 You gotta understand that love 
 Love was something I knew nothing about 
 Until I met you 
 But you, girl 
 You're the one that turned my heart around 
 And for that I love you 
 I'm walking on the sky 
 Girl you're making me high 
 My feet can hardly touch the ground 
 Oh damn I'm mesmerized 
 I'm floatin' on the sky 
 Girl you're making me high 
 My feet can hardly touch the ground 
 Oh damn I'm mesmerized 
 I tried everything I knew from before 
 She broke my technique and now my heart is sore 
 I'm on cloud nine and I want some more 
 She got me floatin' 
 I had to say do do, do do, do do do do do do 
 Say do do do do do do 
 If you're in love let me hear you say do do, do do, do do do do do 
 Say do do do do do do 
 If you're in love 
 Said hey, girl 
 I just can't seem to take my eyes off of you 
 (But who could blame me?) 
 'Cause when I look into those baby blues 
 I can feel my heart fall to the ground 
 And for that I love you 
 (Will.i.am) 
 Girl you got me walkin' on the sky 
 Sho' nuff make a brother feel high 
 And it feels like I'm floatin' 
 But I ain't smokin' dope 
 One day I hope you could tell me why 
 Why the sun don't shine when you're gone 
 Baby, you've still got that thing to turn me on 
 Like the first time I peeped ya 
 I wanted to freak ya 
 And getcha up outta your thong 
 I wanna freak ya, freak ya, freak freak ya 
 Get kinky, put your booty on a speaker 
 And when my waist go boom 
 And the bass go boom 
 Can I se-quence the beat to treat ya? 
 'Cause it's seven in the morning and it just don't stop 
 And we've been at it since eleven o'clock 
 The chocolate rabbit with the hippity hop 
 Makin' love letcha flow 
 Uncle charlie, preach
