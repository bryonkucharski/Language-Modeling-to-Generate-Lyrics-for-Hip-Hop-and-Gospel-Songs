(Intro: Planet Asia) 
 Something sorta special... powerful 
 (Will.i.am) 
 We got chu (got chu), we got chu (let's get the) 
 We got chu (party), we got chu (started) 
 Let's do this, let's do this 
 Let's do this, get this started noooow 
 (A one, two) 
 Let's do this, let's do this 
 Let's do this, get this started 
 (Planet Asia) 
 Emcees just get your bars up, believe I spit the deadliest poems 
 Steady in zoned, I cock back ready and stoned 
 Slap box rap, heavy and armed, relax ock 
 It's hardball on the blacktop, throwin' them bows 
 So lo and behold, the honorable As' rap 
 Phenomenal competition, I flatten rappers out like ham bones 
 Ya crew cut characters contain something other than first of all 
 My hip-hop is straight from the gutter position we left 
 Instantly anticity shows 
 Officially spittin' until I turn officially gold 
 And it's the hunger that I be gettin' me over 
 Just when I expose the most outlandish to my folder 
 Book binder, somethin' that I took some time on 
 To cultivate the masses with these gold chain sciences 
 (Flii) 
 It's Flii styles with the terrible parables 
 Pillage a whole village with pistol-grip paragraphs'll stare at you 
 Foolin with the vocal vigilante dog, please 
 My style's master, your style's asthma, breathe 
 Hardcore boy, I ain't givin' up no dap 
 Head peasier than pubic naps wit stupid raps 
 Who could rap? Bring that ass here to me 
 Asia hangin' them over the bridge like Nino from New Jack City 
 Who's that, kiddies? Nice and pretty witty, they can't get wit' 'ii 
 Titanium wrecking ball flows, slaughter my foes 
 Case closed, mouth closed, I don't wanna hear no babble 
 It sounds like a blisha-blasha-blah 
 See they listen to us cause you were never enough 
 And I'ma hit the people with the game on 'ii 
 If I don't represent the town, shame on me 
 (Chorus: will.i.am) 
 We got chu (got chu), we got chu (got chu) 
 We got chu (party), we got chu (started) 
 Let's do this (do it), let's do this (do it) 
 Let's do this, get this started now 
 Let's do it do it, let's do it do it 
 Do it do it, do it, and do it do it 
 Let's do this (do it), let's do this (do it) 
 Let's do this, get this started 
 Let's do it do it, let's do it do it 
 Do it do it, do it, and do it do it 
 [Asia]: Hey, yo Flii, you the illest 
 [Flii]: Man Asia, you the realest 
 [Both]: Put us both together it's the ultimate 
 We came to give the party people what they 'posed to get 
 [Flii}: Live worldwide, why you makin' local hits? 
 (Asia) 
 On the block I still post with kids 
 Have 'em on my street time 
 On some gold chains, poster biz 
 (Flii) 
 Wow, now that's real marketing 
 Spark the meeting with the label to stablely enable hits 
 (Asia) 
 Major events, daddy rich lay in the tent 
 Playin' the hit, relayin this for ladies and gents 
 (Flii) 
 Relentless with this prolific, so we said what we meant 
 We live what we did, we leave, it's weird, do it again 
 [Asia] (Flii) 
 So next time come through with your mens (you and your kin) 
 Slick with the mic, could have you slide through in the Benz 
 [Flii]: Slick with the talk and how you scoopin her and her friend 
 [Asia]: Extermin these plans for currency insurance and gems 
 [Flii]: Knowledge Wisdom, they got it with them, recitin the hymns 
 [Asia]: Enlighten the men, mic fight writin with them 
 (Flii) 
 Tight with the pen, ballpoint the thoughts that we think 
 You gotta feel it, it's sorta like we live in the ink, we got chu~!
