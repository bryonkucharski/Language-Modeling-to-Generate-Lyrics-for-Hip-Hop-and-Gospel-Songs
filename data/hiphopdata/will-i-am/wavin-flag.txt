When I get older, I will be stronger 
 They'll call me freedom 
 Just like a waving flag 
 When I get older, I will be stronger, 
 They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, 
 And then it goes back, and then it goes back, 
 And then it goes back 
 Born to a throne, stronger than Rome 
 But violent prone, poor people zone, 
 But it's my home, all I have known, 
 Where I got grown, streets we would roam. 
 But out of the darkness, I came the farthest, 
 Among the hardest survival. 
 Learn from these streets, it can be bleak, 
 Accept no defeat 
 Surrender retreat 
 So we struggling, fighting to eat and 
 We wondering when we'll be free, 
 So we patiently wait, for that fateful day, 
 It's not far away, so for now we say 
 So many wars, settling scores, 
 Bringing us promises, leaving us poor, 
 I heard them say, love is the way, 
 Love is the answer, that's what they say, 
 But look how they treat us, make us believers, 
 We fight their battles, then they deceive us, 
 Try to control us, they couldn't hold us, 
 'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers. 
 But we struggling, fighting to eat, 
 And we wondering, when we'll be free 
 So we patiently wait, for that faithful day, 
 It's not far away, but for now we say, 
 And everybody will be singing it 
 And you and I will be singing it 
 And we all will be singing it 
 When I get older, when I get older 
 I will be stronger, just like a waving flag, 
 Just like a waving flag, just like a waving flag 
 Flag, flag, just like a waving flag
