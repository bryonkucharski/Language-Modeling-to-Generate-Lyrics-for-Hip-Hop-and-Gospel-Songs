Make us fight on the hill in the early day constant chill deep inside 
 Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey on they fight for the right 
 Yes but whose to say 
 For a hill men would kill why they do not know 
 Stiffened wounds test their pride 
 Men of five still alive through the raging glow gone insane from the pain that 
 They'll surely know 
 For Whom the Bell Tolls 
 Time marches on 
 For Whom the Bell tolls 
 Take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will 
 Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky, shattered goal fills the 
 Soul with a ruthless cry 
 Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery, hears the silence so loud 
 Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be. 
 Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see... 
 For Whom the Bell Tolls 
 Time marches on 
 For Whom the Bell Tolls
