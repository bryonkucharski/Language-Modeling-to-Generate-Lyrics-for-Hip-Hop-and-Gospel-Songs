I love her, can’t leave her 
 Forever I’ll always need her 
 She lie, but I believe her 
 Lovesick I got that fever 
 Love stupid, I know it 
 Love stupid, I know it 
 I know, 'cause I’m a fool in love 
 My baby shot me down again 
 Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang 
 That girl’s a killer from a gang 
 Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang 
 And oh, I love her so 
 That’s why I gotta let her know 
 That I’ll be here for her to always love her down 
 And maybe that’s the truth 
 The clock can tick and ain’t no use 
 I wonder when my tux can see you when you’re down

 Lovesick I got that fever 
 Love stupid, I know it 
 Love stupid, I know it 
 I know, 'cause I’m a fool in love 
 My baby shot me down, down, down, down 
 Shot me down with the love and it went pow-pow (ow) 
 I love my baby’s freaky style

 But my baby’s always sneaking out

 But damn, I love her so 
 That’s why I gotta let her know 
 That I’ll be here for her, I’ll always be her man
