(John Legend) 
 Hey... hey... hey... hey... 
 Hey you, yeah you with the tight blue jeans 
 Little shorty 'bout five foot three 
 ...With the long-ass weave, girl please 
 Allow me, to come through and introduce myself 
 Let me tell you how the Legend was built 
 I look nice, and I sing real swell, damn well 
 (Will.i.am - imitating some girl name Charise) 
 Nigga please, better learn how to speak to me 
 Need to say my name properly 
 That's Charice spelled with a C, now leave 
 'Cause I don't, got time for a nigga that's broke 
 Still rockin' that Shalin coat 
 Wearin fashion that's three years old, oh no 
 (John Legend) 
 Slow down, you're dealin' with a big dog now 
 Lemme tell you how a playa get down 
 If you want to talk about my style, say wow 
 That's right, that truck over there is mine 
 And baby girl if you act real nice 
 Later on we can take it for a ride, in my ride 
 Ride ride ride ride, ride 
 Ride ride ride ride, ride 
 Ride ride ride ride, ride 
 Let's riiiiiiide 
 (Charice.i.am) 
 Say word, later on I don't know if you heard 
 It's jumpin' off at 1st and 3rd 
 Come early cause the line's absurd, yeah word 
 (John Legend) 
 Okay, hit me up later on today 
 Leave a message on my two-way 
 I'ma go get a barbershop fade, a tight fade 
 (Charice.i.am) 
 Well let's meet, at the deli on 23rd Street 
 9:30 to get a bite to eat 
 Save room for a special treat, it's real sweet 
 (John Legend) 
 Nah mean, now we's about to get obscene 
 Lemme tell you somethin' about them jeans 
 I peel 'em off like a tangerine, strip clean 
 (Charice.i.am) 
 Is that a fact? You talkin' like a real live mack 
 With the old school Cadillac 
 With three chicks and a mink in the back, I like that 
 (John Legend) 
 Well, all right, now you talkin' that language I like 
 I got a feelin' that it's on tonight 
 Buck wild till the broad daylight, that's right 
 (Outro: will.i.am) 
 La la, la-la-la-la-la
