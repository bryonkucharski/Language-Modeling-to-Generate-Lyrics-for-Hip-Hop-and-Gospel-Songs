Lady over by the bar 
 Lookin' like a movie star 
 I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name 
 I like the way you groove and glide 
 I like the way you slip and slide 
 Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me 
 And ooh, show me to another place 
 And ooh, show me how your honey taste 
 And ooh, tell me what it takes for you to 
 Swing by my way 
 Swing by my way 
 Maybe we should slow it down 
 Or maybe we should just head out 
 Or maybe I should kiss you now right here on the floor 
 'Cause baby when you move like that 
 You're givin' me a heart attack 
 But still you got me comin' back and beggin' for more 
 And ooh, show me to another place 
 And ooh, show me how your honey taste 
 And ooh, tell me what it takes for you to 
 Swing by my way 
 Swing by my way 
 And, baby ooooweee 
 Watch yourself you might be comin' home with me 
 Grab your purse and baby let me grab my keys 
 Let's get up out this place and maybe 
 Swing by my way 
 Swing by my way 
 Lady over by the bar 
 Lookin' like a movie star 
 I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name 
 I like the way you groove and glide 
 I like the way you slip and slide 
 Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me
