I've been thinking 
 Just sitting thinking 
 On why I love you 
 And all my reasons 
 And if I lost you 
 Boy, if I lost you 
 I'd lose myself 
 And I wouldn't feel the way I feel now 
 You bring me sin 
 Yes, you bring me sin 
 You make me feel like a million, billion 
 I'll let you in 
 But don't you break my heart 
 Don't you rip me apart 
 No, don't you rip me apart 
 Baby, love, it should be easy 
 It shouldn't be complicated 
 It should be easy 
 I don't know how else to say it 
 (You don't know how to) 
 I've got visions 
 Boy, I've got visions of me and you 
 Happily just living 
 Now go there out there 
 Them beautiful men 
 But you my future 
 Baby, you my right now 
 If there was a scale from 1 to 10 
 Then my love for you is a million, billion 
 Boy, I'll love you till the day I'm dead 
 So please, don't mess with my head 
 Please, don't mess with my head 
 Baby, love, it should be easy 
 It shouldn't be complicated 
 It should be easy 
 I don't know how else to say it 
 (You don't know how to) 
 La da di 
 La di da 
 It's the only way to love 
 La da di 
 La di da 
 It's the only way to love (To love) 
 I don't know how, baby love, it should be easy 
 It shouldn't be complicated 
 It should be easy 
 I don't know how else to say it 
 La da di 
 La di da 
 It's the only way to love 
 La da di 
 La di da 
 (You don't know how to)
