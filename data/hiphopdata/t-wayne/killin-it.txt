Pockets full of them bands 'cause I be killing it 
 Playing around with them bags 'cause I be killing it 
 I don't think they understand 'cause I be killing it 
 I take your girl 'cause I be killing it 
 Word around I'm the man 'cause I be killing it 
 Boys don't understand, they too illiterate 
 Trying to do it like me but I'm too different 
 Used to be on my ass but now I'm getting it 
 How the hell you gon' stunt when I don't fall 
 All up in your city at the mall 
 Blowing up my phone, I don't answer calls 
 I got these hoes pissed, go to the stall 
 They know that I kill it, I'm the coldest 
 All these other rappers bogus, I don't even got to show it 
 When I pull up to the club, cameltoe truck tow me 
 Hit your girlfriend with that okeydokey 
 Pockets full of them bands 'cause I be killing it 
 Playing around with them bags 'cause I be killing it 
 I don't think they understand 'cause I be killing it 
 I take your girl 'cause I be killing it 
 I been going in ever since I started 
 Need a straight jacket, my flow too retarded 
 I be going dumb even though I'm the smartest 
 Picasso couldn't paint a better picture, I'm an artist 
 I be with them bands, like I'm at school 
 Like a broken radio, these fuckers out of tune 
 Even in the sauna I be feeling cool 
 Got your baby mama tryna join the crew 
 I be flexing and finessing, I'm a stunner 
 Pull up in that Porsche Panamera like it was a Honda 
 I be coming through the city on For's like an iguana 
 I be killing everything, you can put that on my mama 
 And I'm cooling, back then I was fooling 
 And I remember back when I was cooling 
 I'm with the team making movies 
 And we moving 
 Pockets full of them bands 'cause I be killing it 
 Playing around with them bags 'cause I be killing it 
 I don't think they understand 'cause I be killing it 
 I take your girl 'cause I be killing it
