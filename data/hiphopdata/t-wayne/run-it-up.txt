Shopping at [?], going dumb with it 
 Drop hundreds and fiftys 
 I'mma go dumb with the sack 
 Got plenty, you know that it's with me 
 Make it rain on your bitch, I just bought out the city 
 I'mma make it rain hundreds 
 I ain't stopping till my pockets on empty 
 Fucked a check up on designer 
 Fucked a check up on a lineup 
 Fucked a check up on some strippers 
 Fucked a check up on some diamonds 
 Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up 
 Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, yes 
 Fuck up the check on designer 
 Fuck up the check on a lineup 
 Fuck the check up on a Rari 
 Fuck up the check on vagina 
 It ain't really nothing much 
 When the city right behind you 
 When you're in the MIA 
 And everybody tryna find you 
 I'm flexing like a trainer 
 If I'm on it it's a banger 
 Chain round my neck hanging just like a cliffhanger 
 I'm a fool with it 
 I'm running up that check like I'm an athlete at a track meet 
 She gone ride for me even if she was in the back seat 
 Ever since I took off it ain't been the same 
 I got too much [?], I can't ever change 
 I'mma pull up in a cool whip 
 That's the same color as cool whip 
 Your girlfriend on my to-do list 
 New bathroom, I'm on some new shit
