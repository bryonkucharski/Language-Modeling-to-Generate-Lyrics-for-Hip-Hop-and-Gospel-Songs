"We played the part of lovers 
 You gave all your love and you made it seem right 
 You made me a man oh so young in my life" 
 "Why you don't know who I am? 
 I-I'll see you, I know exactly where you're at 
 That so you don't have to wonder and try to find out who I am 
 You will SEE who I am, I will tell you who I am" 
 "Then who are you?" 
 (The Alchemist) 
 I am 
 The maestro that's composin these dope jams 
 Got fiends tappin they arms for that dope slam 
 On the low like the Witness Protection pro-gram 
 Cliques to guerillas with killas, let 'em ride out 
 Park the tank, open the latch and then I climb out 
 To the atmosphere so I could really find out 
 Who's schemin when I walk around with the shines out 
 I seen 'em, pay no attention I make boss moves 
 Pay kings no attention cause the cash rules 
 Kingpin I'm in on anything that moves 
 It's the Anchorman, I deliver the bad news 
 At least a couple thousand in my pocket, no less 
 Can't even stop to take a breather 'cause it's no rest 
 Where I'm at, my position's what I know best 
 From California, but I represent the whole West 
 (Fashawn) 
 Uh, they like god-damn 
 Who gives a fuck about them blocks, you ran 
 How you walk around with choppers like it's I-ran 
 You grew up in the burbs, you are not the man 
 I was in the kitchen, pots, pans 
 See I'm 'bout action, you plot, plan 
 Pull up to the spot, I stop, they scram 
 Got 'em out in Philly like ock's not playing 
 High definition like Com-Cast 
 Left Coast District, on smash 
 I'm the next addition, just do the math 
 The only missing link to the movement was Fash' 
 You can tell by the bass that's A-L-C 
 Ask E-V, I'm on my J-O-B 
 So it's never a drought, fiends don't sweat 
 Eastside, but I represent the whole F 
 Product of them Grizzly City pro-jects 
 I get a good sleep when my soul at rest 
 CA but I represent the whole West 
 Coast to the death, fuck you expect? 
 It's the F 
 "That so you don't have to wonder and try to find out who I am 
 You will see who I am" "Then who are you?" 
 (Evidence) 
 I am 
 Slow Flow that's controlling all these live jams 
 Use myself once again till I'm tried, and 
 Proved, but don't lose, he gets vio-lent 
 A starving student that won't move, I'm like why not? 
 Go to the place then let him ride out till I'm high -- Got 
 My name in hall of fame, CA and I'mma ride out 
 Eyes open 20/20, he's a white owl 
 No joking, money first, I'm like a tri-band 
 Cell phone on the other side of your land 
 I'm programmed, either way I hold my own cam 
 And film, ain't no fucking stand I bought my own land 
 Still never ran and never will, god-damn 
 Never gonna knock me off my throne, Plan 
 B is not an option I'm a grown man 
 Known for moving weight, so I'm pro-grams
