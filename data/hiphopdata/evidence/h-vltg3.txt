Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes... 
 Hybrid 
 I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin' in space 
 Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits 
 I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
 Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it 
 Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist 
 Many men have tried to shake us 
 But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of 
 I buckle knees like leg braces, 
 Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us 
 So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
 From now to infinity, let icons be bygones 
 I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this 
 I tried threats, but moved on to a promise 
 I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
 And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this 
 High voltage 
 The unforgettable sound 
 High voltage 
 Bringin' you up and takin' you down 
 High voltage 
 Comin' at you from every side 
 High voltage 
 Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones 
 Never satisfied my rhyme jones 
 Spraying bright day over what you might say 
 My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A 
 On highways ripe with road rage 
 Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around 
 Surround sound 
 Devouring the scenes 
 Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things 
 Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit 
 Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics 
 Fourth dimension, compact convention 
 Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention 
 Meant to put you away, with the pencil 
 Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile 
 While you risk your all 
 I pick out at your flaws 
 Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw 
 High voltage 
 The unforgettable sound 
 High voltage 
 Bringin' you up and takin' you down 
 High voltage 
 Comin' at you from every side 
 High voltage 
 Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 High voltage 
 The unforgettable sound 
 High voltage 
 Bringin' you up and takin' you down 
 High voltage 
 Comin' at you from every side 
 High voltage 
 Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 Who's the man, demanding you hand over your Land Rover 
 The man's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams you glance over 
 I am visclorosous, the most ferocious 
 When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage 
 That's why I need ruby quartz glasses, 
 'Cause when I glance there's a chance 
 That I might blast the masses 
 Subliminals transmitted through piano 
 Integrated in flow, calculated to nano 
 I use skills when I need pleas sees the rhyme 
 I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time 
 I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles 
 By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules 
 I bring the knowledge the you swallow a state that's a hologram 
 I botch your head, fatten your lip like collagen 
 The telepath deliver verses with no postage 
 Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage 
 High voltage 
 The unforgettable sound 
 High voltage 
 Bringin' you up and takin' you down 
 High voltage 
 Comin' at you from every side 
 High voltage 
 Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 High voltage 
 The unforgettable sound 
 High voltage 
 Bringin' you up and takin' you down 
 High voltage 
 Comin' at you from every side 
 High voltage 
 Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
