D-o-n-t n-e-e-d-l-o-v-e 
 Michael Connelly reminded me with Echo Park 
 Of days of hoppin' on the metro, when they let those spark 
 Back when I collected retro art 
 And since then many a dearly departed God bless they heart 
 God bless they hearts, harder living in Kane 
 Where the sun and the rain became one in the same 
 I took it as a lesson I was still learnin' 
 I'm still the will of the '84 torch burnin' 
 I been through heartbreaks to breakups to makeups to broke again 
 Not back again, my soul on the rope again 
 Took the jacket off and saw blood on my sleeves 
 When you wear your heart there, this the puddle it leaves 
 (I don't need love) It's the rebuttal of thieves 
 And chicks with crooks like you, so what'll it be? 
 She steal your heart, now she runnin' the streets 
 Don't need the pain, man, troublin' me 
 I don't need love 
 I don't, I don't need love 
 Need love, need love 
 I don't need love 
 I don't need love 
 I don't need love 
 Need love 
 While Kanye was chasing spaceships all over the nation 
 I was at the grave site, face on the pavement 
 Left college dropout, first flight racing 
 From Scranton, Pennsylvania on a prop plane praying 
 Heart 'bout to pop out my chest in Pittsburgh 
 Paranoid in first class, heard a voice, whisper (Real talk) 
 Just touched back in LAX and my phone starts buzzin' to one thousand texts 
 Out the gate and runnin' like I'm motorless 
 I still love you explained if you don't know the rest 
 I would say that's when love became an issue 
 Anybody treated me good, that's when I diss you 
 A certain chick who caught the bad end of the stick 
 And through thin and thick I still miss you 
 I've trashed every girl I've had since 
 Warm heart, cold mind is absent, imagine 
 I don't need love anymore, I need pressure 
 Pain, my veins feelin' so electric 
 Blue in the skin, choosin' my sin 
 'Til the same sins doin' me in I don't need love 
 I don't need love 
 I don't, I don't need love 
 Need love, need love 
 I don't need love 
 I don't need love 
 I don't need love 
 Need love
