(Verse 1: The Alchemist) 
 Everyday I wake up to the sound of waves crashing 
 Make moves it time to take action 
 More bread for the basket 
 No sleep, I do that when I'm the casket 
 No patience, I take no breaks and no vacation 
 I can't wait, time is money 
 Shine like California skies dead sunny after the rain 
 When it's all said and done make sure they remember my name 
 Level headed, hop off a G4 jet get on a train 
 Jump out a taxi cab and jump on the stage 
 No flash, never do shows for no cash 
 Checks come in my government name 
 But Chemistry man is what I'm known as 
 (Of course) you already know that 
 Hit up the city, hit my man up on the jack 
 Like "Where the smoke at?" (inhales) 
 My mind is free, no cage, center stage when it's time to speak 
 Drama settle nobody better, I stand next to the man that tells the weather 
 Like Goldie with the red leather I'm checking my cheddar 
 (Verse 2: Evidence) 
 Grammy family wildin' out, where the media flocks 
 To me it's a night at home, another pizza box 
 Another verse of cursing, trying to connect the dots 
 Just to hop, skip, and jump, the peddling never stop 
 Turn on my inbox, bills in my mailbox 
 As long as the beat knocks, I feel no stress 
 No chance to second guess, a feeling like this 
 No day I live twice, Venice still in the west 
 Spend six months out the year on my hustle and grind 
 The other half spent plotting what's next 
 Doubling time, ALC collaboration 
 Congratulations, I'mma bubble and shine 
 Starting the day with pardon, I'mma part this stage 
 I hope you're part at my side, when I drop this way 
 Eight point eight, shake shit up inside nature 
 LA's unstable, still chasing paper, crazy 
 (Scratches) 
 So Fresh 
 It's raining here in Houston and it's delayed a bunch of those earlier flights 
 I was gonna try to get on one of those, but that one was delayed 
 Longer than the one that I got now, so I got three hours to kill 
 I think I might go found some place to eat some wings and to hang out 
 And maybe watch Sportscenter.
