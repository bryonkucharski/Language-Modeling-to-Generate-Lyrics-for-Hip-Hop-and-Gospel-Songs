Well Runs Dry (featuring Krondon) 
 (Verse 1 - Evidence) 
 Times have dried, and the well went first 
 Starving to death - nah, I think I'm dying of thirst 
 I get inspired on a momentary basis 
 A livewire - been flown so many places 
 For various faces, like I never knew the mob I was married to the matrix 
 I'm making placements, but living in my basement 
 So what's a verse if I ain't really ain't say shit 
 I paid the mortgage, and the storage and it keep pourin' 
 Can't afford it so I gotta keep on tourin' 
 Trying to make a record in between was never foreign 
 But unfamiliar when there's no way to afford it 
 No way I was loyal to believing in cream 
 But when the well runs dry we go beyond our means 
 And above, most are really just lookin' for love 
 And shed a tear don't mean you know the sound of a dove 
 (Hook - Krondon) 
 When the well runs dry, and the people go home 
 And it's the end of the song, and ya... 
 Tears won't fall, so you just can't cry 
 When the well runs dry for ya... 
 Like the car stopped running 
 And the checks stopped coming 
 Somebody let the sun in... 
 When your card's declined give it one more try 
 Till the well runs dry 
 (Verse 2 - Evidence) 
 Mom was old school, and I was just a child 
 Never knew that when she died it would have me actin' wild 
 Have me actin' crazy, maybe out of my mind 
 But never lazy, we actin' on borrowed time 
 A leader for no reason, used to start up a cause 
 Just believing in my odds became a part of my laws 
 Went from dreaming, to receiving these screaming applause 
 Hear nothing, but believin' for no reason at all 
 A product of a parent leaving is apparently wrong 
 Fuck appearances, appear in here then 'poof' you gone 
 I took a look at my life, and my reflection long 
 And that's the same fear mirrored, when I hear this song 
 I just wanna go where I belong 
 I just wanna go to places where I feel strong 
 (For two seasons without rain) 
 And I tell them why 
 When the fame goes, the same when the well goes dry 
 (Verse 3 - Evidence) 
 Lack of sleep, sometimes I can't dream 
 Eyes so red, already tried Visine 
 Stacking cheddar, wasn't checking amounts 
 Then went from savings right back down to checking accounts (Straight up!) 
 I smacked the Miss Piggy bank with the hammer out 
 A real hammer, not the guns that they ramble about 
 Develop hardship, buying in a sellers market 
 Almost quit smoking weed, but I better spark it 
 (Like my target) Then I see no evil 
 Then weeks go by, and I see no people 
 Trapped in a home, broke with bills trying to pay for 
 Wonder why the album was late - need I say more 
 I love this rap, but I'm living in life 
 The kind that keep me up to these sleepless nights 
 And I don't need love, but I need this mic 
 To feed the energy that's keepin' me right 
 Yeah - it's till the wheels fall off 
 It's till the well runs dry 
 We gon' get it 
 Once you've been down 
 Only way to go is up 
 It's for my dog right there 
 You gon' get it
