Featuring Defari and Dilated Peoples 
 <Defari> 
 Don't front 
 So many claim the fame but never see the day 
 When lyrically they could even run in the Triple A's 
 This here's the major leagues where big hits are guaranteed 
 The Ken Griffey turbo 850 professional MC 
 One more time that cat Defari 
 With a sting operation so blatant we call it franchise 
 Man sign independent on some enterprise 
 It's time to shoot straight, innovate, and make the world realize 
 That mics get ripped, and spots get blown 
 I strive to be a Golden State all-time great, like J-Ro 
 I gets burned when the Technics turn on mix shows and mix tapes 
 That you hear when a car turns left on the street 
 You know that shit that make you bounce 
 'Nuf respect to Rasco and Evidence 
 Yo hold it down on the mound 
 I'm not like Hideo, don't got it Nomo 
 I'm more like Randy Johnson, guaranteed heat for sure 
 Yo this that where the big hits are guaranteed 
 This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues 
 You in the batter's box ready for combat (what?) 
 But when you step up to the plate better bring it fat 
 <Evidence> 
 I throw spitballs and sliders, and hit batters with attitude 
 The signal's in, and my catcher's 'Fari Herut 
 I got to risin' on the mound, talkin' at pen-point 
 Retire the side, put on a jacket, ice my joints 
 And body parts, world-wide, Evidence is known 
 Have you fallin' out the batter's box when curves are thrown 
 Precise angles, I disect the strategy, no cost 
 And just 'cause I choose to wander don't mean I'm lost 
 I got the button-up jersrey, Dilated written in cursive 
 I spill my heart to wax and put the in the open 
 Three men against nine players, yo, that shit's unheard of 
 Plus my eyes are open in takin' folks 
 One cat got on base but he didn't learn his lesson 
 I faked to first and picked him off at second 
 Patience is a virtue, yo he couldn't understand 
 That cat's out, time waits for no man 
 Bust it 
 Don't front 
 This where the big hits are guaranteed 
 This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues 
 You in the batter's box ready for combat (what?) 
 But when you step up to the plate 
 <Rasco> 
 It be the large caliber rhyme 
 Ask yourself why try 
 Microphone slash Rasco Defari 
 Evidence, rhymes that set the precedence 
 Straight out the box, MCs to bobby sox 
 Major league, set to intrigue you small fee 
 Nothin' to the game, we doused them small flames 
 Take names 
 Head for the fence, we track prints 
 Track down the scent, then fold your whole tent 
 Stay bent 
 The illest on rhymes at all times 
 Call your bullpen, Rasco just pulled into the lot 
 Be strikin 'em out with one shot 
 While your pitch be hittin the plate at one spot 
 Down the pipe 
 The major lieutenant that earn stripes 
 Bet strap in, cadet to captain 
 Stand up, better yet, put them hands up 
 And watch the triple threat come fuck them plans up 
 Smack niggas, with lyrical gems that sayin' hymns 
 Niggas still rappin' 'bout clothes and car rims 
 Man debted 
 But dishin that corn, you get spread 
 We runnin' on supreme, you runnin' on unleaded 
 Couldn't match, you out the line-up, you been scratched 
 Sittin' on the bench, not feelin' you one pinch, in the trench 
 We loadin the guns to stack funds 
 Went from stackin ones to stackin them one-huns 
 Scored runs 
 The hotter the bat, the more fat 
 It's Dilated, Ras, 'Fari, we bust back 
 Like that, like that, like that, like that 
 Like that y'all, like that, check it 
 Yo this that where the big hits are guaranteed 
 This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues 
 You in the batter's box ready for combat (what?) 
 But when you step up to the plate better bring it fat 
 Don't front 
 <Scratching, fades out>
