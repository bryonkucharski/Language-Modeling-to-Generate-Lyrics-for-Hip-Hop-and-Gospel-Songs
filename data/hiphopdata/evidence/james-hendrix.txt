"What if uh, C-A-T really spelled 'dog'?" 
 "Uh... that's heavy!" 
 (Hook: Evidence) 
 Uh, I'm commission-driven, so pay up 
 I ain't fuckin' up these Dunks or these lay-ups 
 ...And if you see me wearin make-up 
 The same day you saw Jimi Hendrix wake up 
 So those that give a fuck, I apoligize 
 Know my heart is here, never compromised 
 Those in attendance, I wanna thank ya 
 And wish this night all night, throw in the anchor 
 ("AS WE PROCEED..." <- Puff Daddy) 
 (Verse One: The Alchemist) 
 ...No introduction 
 Metal tips through hard hats, I'm into construction 
 Tip the bucket, rhythm rugged, I'm into corrupt shit 
 Big budget stay dipped like a Chicken McNugget 
 (F'real) Excellence is what you should expect 
 Runnin' without a breath (what) I'm comin' out of left (yeah) 
 Uncut like dope without a step 
 No +Brother+ without the +Step+, no show without the bread 
 My words surf crowds, go over your head 
 Took a rhythm, push 'em over the ledge 
 I'm criminal, my feet wet (uh), I'm drippin with technique sweat 
 (+Sweatin my Technique+) No more than a minute to make the beat stretch 
 Pardon the way that I speak French, gunnin from out a deep trench 
 (Ah!) Write my name on a street bench in cursive 
 Permanent ink my verses, beatdown person 
 Finish I'll bring down curtains 
 Navigatin my Surburban Expedition, Excursion 
 No lithograph, I'm the original version 
 Money duffle bag'll fit a person, punch the clock put the work in 
 Earth spin on my finger like Julius Erving 
 (Verse Two: Evidence) 
 I shine (I shine) I glow, motherfucker 
 Never doubt one second of Evidence 
 State-wide, world-wide, consecutive elegance 
 No weak shit since the first song on Weatherman 
 It's called "I Know" (I know!), total control, pressure made 
 Bling diamonds in the rough, mix created from coal (whoa) 
 My rhyme is a sign and letters are tolls 
 No pen, dip my hand in the ink and let it go 
 (+Letyourselfgo+) Touch a lot of reefer 
 No I don't spit no bullshit raps on wax, I touch a lot of people 
 I touch a lot of needles, no I don't leak dope in my veins 
 I got the psyche of created evil 
 Believe you me, cousin is pain 
 Got a brother name karma, father insane (HA~!) 
 Related to sin and sin's met Cain 
 Raising cats and dogs when Allah says rain 
 ("AS WE PROCEED..." <- Puff Daddy) 
 No game, it's Mos Def +Mathematics+ 
 Life is tragic, addin it up is more dramatic 
 Except StepBrothers back at it 
 For the very first time, center stage it's automatic 
 "As we proceed..." 
 "In Olde England, they had hang roofs on their houses and the cats and dogs once leaped on the roof 
 When it rained, the roofs got slippery and the cats and dogs would slide off of the roofs 
 Therefore, it was raining cats and dogs"
