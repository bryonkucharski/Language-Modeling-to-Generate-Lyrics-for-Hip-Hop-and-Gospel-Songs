(Evidence) 
 I started my day great, don't hate what I do 
 Instead get a plate, heh, don't hate my food for thought 
 Don't wait, don't watch (don't hate) what I got 
 Even if it's not what I wanted to view 
 I'm first up to crack the blinds (don't hate) 
 Racin time, in fact I love to smoke la-la-la 
 They couldn't tell me nada, so I burned it up hot as the sun 
 And came back a product of my environment's done 
 (Defari) 
 Yeah, yeah, (don't hate) the maker, the car 
 They international - Ah! Don't hate the actual star 
 Killer than me and E-V? No question 
 It's obvious, the homies are prosperous 
 Watch them study and follow this 
 Got love (don't hate) where I'm at 
 I never left, I holla "Don't hate, hit me back" 
 And now you seem bothered, don't hate, I'm runnin' today 
 I'm switchin my gates in London at 8 
 (Evidence) 
 One of the greats, passports stamped up, don't hate 
 Wait a minute, listen, record spinnin, don't hate 
 I-I play the game well, lanes change course, don't make the Change of the Guard 
 My pen is like I'm in the pen far bangin' these bars 
 Back from the yard, small glimpse, don't hate freedom 
 Eyes lock you in so I stay at the beaches 
 Fake chicks and leeches, I still {"don't hate) 
 I let 'em off, yellow car, then it's back to relate 
 (Defari) 
 Burn one before the wake up call 
 {"Don't hate"} the rise and the fall, I outlast 'em all 
 Don't hate the neighbor next door, I'm glad that she saw 
 Don't hate the tree that he rolled, the bag that he bought 
 The blunt that we blew, the courtesy call 
 Yeah, don't hate the live that I'm livin' 
 The gift I've been givin', don't hate the love for my children 
 I'm wheelin and dealin', don't hate, the man is just grown 
 He does for his own, he rest on the throne 
 (Hook: DJ Revolution cuts and scratches) 
 I got mine, so (don't hate) 
 I got mine, so (don't hate) 
 I got mine, so (don't hate) 
 (Don't hate these haters at all) 
 I got mine, so I show no shame 
 I got mine, so (don't hate) 
 I got mine, so I show no shame 
 I got mine, so I show no shame 
 (Don't hate these haters at all) "I got mine, so I" 
 (Evidence) 
 Don't love some, (don't hate) either though 
 Fall into a glaze on between I don't even know 
 I'm no elitist but I flow how the people treat us 
 Needless to say I ain't walking on pins and needles 
 They can't figure it out, don't hate the recipe 
 I slipped 'em ether I, don't hate them testin me 
 The message is still here, no doubt just harder to find 
 Without Evidence, each time I'm part of the crime 
 (Defari) 
 Don't hate one, don't hate self never 
 Eighty degrees in the sun, don't hate the LA weather 
 I live the meaning of fun, (don't hate) the travelling man 
 With euros in hand for trees, in Amsterdam 
 Don't get crazy, don't hate me neither though 
 The way you actin' right now, (don't hate) I'm glad you 
 Showed your true colors, can we drink one? (Don't) 
 I'm late for my people, gotta fly like an eagle 
 See you'se when I see you 
 (Evidence) 
 E, don't hate, no 
 The ratio, drop the hits without the radio 
 The lazy flow, spit quick, arrive slow (don't hate) the live show 
 The long line, the fact we on time, cloud control out my mind 
 I don't do lunch, don't hate the soloist 
 On my own terms of success, don't hate blowin' it up 
 With chicks, no handcuffs, don't hate that 
 Let my birds fly last LP, some ain't came back 
 (Defari) 
 My hat says LA, (don't hate) the downshift 
 Watch the P car getaway, don't hate the fact 
 That it's life we bed on everyday 
 Don't hate the coach seats you have to sit on, you're in play 
 Still leavin' the state, can't predict my fate 
 Don't hate the methods I use, the weapons I choose 
 Don't hate the minimal dues that you have a crew 
 Don't hate the fact that nobody's whole-heartedly vouchin for you
