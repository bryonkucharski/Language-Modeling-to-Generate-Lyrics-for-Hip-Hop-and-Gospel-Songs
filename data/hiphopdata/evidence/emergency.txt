(Sirens) 
 Yo emergency 
 "...Emergency" "...emergency" 
 "...Emergency" "...emergency" 
 First up 
 (Evidence) 
 Mighty Mi supplied the beat down 
 These raps are rent paid, four months before I leave town 
 Cat, we got the hottest shit that ain't been heard yet 
 To most I'm unknown, but to few; a war vet 
 I turn checks to cash, but no cash for checks 
 I never paid for sex, I pay girls to leave after sex 
 (Get the fuck out..) Play my cassanette then jet 
 I'm out for blood this year, flows are fangs of death 
 Specialize in fresh, M.D. veteran vest 
 There's so much to prove, you lose scoreless 
 Take Lex, Benz, Beam, convertable 'Vette's 
 Cribs and credit cards, payment plans in debt (Gimme that) 
 We present emergency, feel the pressure 
 No way out, situation gettin' closer 
 Time is tickin, walls are closin 
 Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen 
 Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure 
 No way out, situation gettin' closer (emergency) 
 Time is tickin, walls are closin 
 Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency) 
 (Evidence) 
 Yo dangerous connections, friends are kept separate 
 Enemies drive 'em off the road, rev the engine 
 Levels of suspense, more this year no doubt 
 The card that you pull, always leave yourself with outs... 
 Stick to ya guns, stick to ya plans 
 Stick and hit when ya land, witcha fist and hit a man (boink) 
 The name of my crew; Dilated Expand 
 Babu, Iriscience, and myself in Japan 
 We got international flows 
 Under the best sign, rockin' zodiac clothes 
 The strong survive in water where sharks are swimmin 
 Emergency, call the paramedics, lights are dimmin 
 Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure 
 No way out, situation gettin' closer (emergency) 
 Time is tickin, walls are closin 
 Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency) 
 Emergency, DJ Mighty Mi 
 Evidence by the mic "emer... emergency" 
 Watch out! "..mer... mer... emergency... emergency" 
 "This is an emergency" 
 (Evidence) 
 So check it out 
 The calm before the storm came 
 After that, 40 nights and 40 days of rain 
 Your weakest link, it's your crew, it stink 
 Numb ya brain, unpredictable patterns, and unpredictable pain 
 Got attack on hard, raise the game 
 Right now there's Columbian cats that's raisin 'caine 
 Los Angeles Lakers dynasty, change the game 
 Say, Defari and Phil y'all, let's clear the land 
 That's right, shit's outta control 
 Do rap music you perform to rock-n-roll 
 Got lyrics cocked back on trigger ready to pull it 
 I hitchu like the JFK mystery bullet 
 Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure 
 No way out, situation gettin' closer (emergency) 
 Time is tickin, walls are closin 
 Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency) 
 Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure 
 No way out, situation gettin' closer (emergency) 
 Time is tickin, walls are closin 
 Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency) 
 Yo emergency, emergency...
