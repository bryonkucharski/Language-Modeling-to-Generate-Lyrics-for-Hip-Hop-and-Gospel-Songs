It's everyone's interest and the weather, here it is... 
 This is the cold weather 
 So get your cloak and umbrella 
 (Hook: Evidence) 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Coats and umbrellas 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas 
 (Verse 1: Evidence) 
 Umbrellas up to the sky 
 Cats and dogs, those people who call 
 I hit back before it's twice 
 As of late these mics don't reach too far 
 So I kill each bar like it's flashing lights 
 Taylor Made Records, my mom name lives on 
 Cold weather code letters: TMR 
 It's hard to be stopped when you got a meaning like this 
 I got a plot that's meanin' to kids 
 I'm part of the rest 
 I watch Rap City get upset 
 Kick a hole in my flatscreen 
 Scream and not jet 
 Then back to the scene of the west 
 They call me Mister 
 Don't make tunes for strippers 
 I'm one of the best 
 (Hook: Evidence) 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Coats and umbrellas 
 (That's what I mean by now, I'm on my way home) 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas 
 (DJ Scratching) 
 Exhale, that was halftime 
 (Verse 2: Evidence) 
 (THIS IS) The word worth of thousand pictures 
 You gotta mock us in tryna get a thousand bitches 
 That's how we drop it, to feel regret 
 I try to fill it in baguettes 
 Stuck on the painting when I picture in the silhouette 
 I be the best 
 I be great 
 I can waste my words or I can say free Tibet 
 Or maybe not think so global, but more local 
 Like the Lakers better rip anything what's next 
 Witty with the words, they never liked it 
 So beat me down, but couldn't get the best of Michael 
 From next town I came back a new recital 
 I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle 
 They show love, but that's a part of tour 
 I play the part and maybe that's the art of war 
 Or maybe why I started for, started from 
 Either one 
 (Hook: Evidence) 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Coats and umbrellas 
 (Umbrellas up to the sky) 
 (THIS IS) The cold weather 
 Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas 
 (DJ Scratching till end) 
 Hi, I'm like an hour away from like an L.A 
 And it's snowing in California...
