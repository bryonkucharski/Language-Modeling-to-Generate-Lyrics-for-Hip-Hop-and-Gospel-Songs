It appears the driver lost control and the car went 
 *Screeching tires* 
 Heath Ledger, Griff the phoenix and AM put together 
 Cancel the skies scratch the Earth to the letter 
 E carve it with the V I'm back 
 I hit the tree when I'm running overseas on tracks 
 Pardon me, ask any of my counterparts 
 Only person running 'round streets when the town is dark 
 I move through any district proving that I've seen red-lights and already caused mischief 
 A world class traveler partial to my ways playing parliament and Gallagher 
 They treat the math like it was algebra 
 But simple shit just magician's abracadabra 
 Thank y'all for having me snack 
 My 45 was the first round and second caliber spat 
 He's a blood spiller expert, Dexter extra 
 Encore step to the stage its rest in 
 Peace 
 Oh my gosh, there has just been a major accident out here 
 In one of the most horrific crashes we have ever seen 
 The crash occurred around 11:30 
 Different way to see the same thing I'm seeing 
 Kinda like Caribbean or say Caribbean 
 I get busy with the flow I insist it 
 They say they never knew a pocket like this existed 
 I got 'em with camaraderie 
 Passed on the bottle spend a dollar on the lottery 
 Gotten 'em total control Kobe dribbling 
 Big brother watching, little brother listening 
 The coldest features drumming to the meter 
 Shoot lights at stars and media rights the media 
 But leisure time ain't spent enough I pay taxes 
 And the tegra with Tahitians on beaches with no MapQuest 
 Access granted from ca the planet 
 From a road that ain't paved the way god planned it 
 I walk with no shoes on my feet, avoid the rules of the street 
 And stay in tune 'cause the movement is weak 
 I don't crash 
 Police investigating a horrific car accident 
 Except that it was a spectacular wreck involving excessive speed 
 But not a car crash here 
 I don't crash
