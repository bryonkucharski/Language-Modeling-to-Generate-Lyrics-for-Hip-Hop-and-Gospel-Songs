"Let's get it together, no matter the weather" 
 "Rain or shine, yes in any weather" 
 (And another one) Yeah... 
 Uh, it's the joy and the pain 
 The rain and the sun, namin no names, came in the same 
 Never aimin my gun, you get one shot 
 Never waving my chance, maybe waving my chain 
 My b-boy stance is authentic 
 Mos def, universal magnetic 
 Fat beats on Vermont, I set it off 
 Uh, from the basement floor 
 Bob Dylan heard it knocking on Heaven's door 
 From across the room to when I'm out on tour 
 Reminds me of a time when my life was pure 
 It finds me at the oddest moments 
 Tried to focus but end up zoning 
 I go back, but the caption's closing 
 So cold, but the clock ain't frozen 
 It was something, December babies 
 As Christmas came, we had our birthdays lumped in 
 Layaway, one present, two holidays 
 Seen it from a mile away, you can't lie to your kids 
 I guess that makes up for no bros and sisters 
 Nothing's ever missing in the kitchen 
 Nothing, ever really went wrong 
 Until the one that raised me was the one that's gone 
 It's funny how strength comes in different forms 
 Some embrace they faith, others weather storms 
 Others tell themself that the pain moves on 
 I saw the clouds move in and when it did, they poured 
 I push away the pain, it's the sun and the rain 
 Rain or shine, I got my umbrella 
 I said it's none better, I'mma see you a-gain 
 It's worth to listen to woman's worth, it's worth everything 
 "So much to say, but I still flow slow"
