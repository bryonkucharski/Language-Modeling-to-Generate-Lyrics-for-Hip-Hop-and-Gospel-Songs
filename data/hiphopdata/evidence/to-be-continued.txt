Ten commandments, twenty-four hours 
 The thirteenth floor was missing in the towers 
 Hmm, I thought I shouldn't be here 
 I stayed an extra day because they said it's Leap Year 
 Who's the wolf in sheep's clothing? 
 Fuck it, the rabbit hit the drum and kept going 
 Each word is the church and minister 
 Approach, I coerce the listener so listen up 
 Kicking park bench rhythms up till I visual a flow 
 I stay at home sick and visit her 
 Radio, I visit station nights 
 It's kinda like their fucking visitation rights 
 This ain't the place for my face in lights 
 I'm tight driven living in the fucking shadow-less life 
 I dilate like pay attention 
 Slow flow just to? 
 I didn't die lately, I just slept on bed springs 
 Can't define people, I just see dead things 
 It ain't just rap, I body ladies in one line 
 Talking slick to three chicks on text at one time 
 My scene shattered words, they left broke in pieces 
 Lines undone, half uncompleted 
 To be continued dot dot dot 
 Cliff hanger, my life is like I'm scaling a rock 
 And it's on 
 I spit that oxygen fire, still the illest high 
 I spit that fly for now and feel it when it's live 
 Move the crowd, got tools for the reddest eyes 
 Getting cabbage my man until the letters dry 
 I'm fully up to the task to pull the woolly over my face 
 Into a masked location, don't even ask 
 It's like damn another day in the life 
 Like keep waking up from the previous night 
 Vacation, I don't take it often 
 I see parking lot stages and buses with bunks like coffins 
 Clear customs with weed in my Levis 
 The penalty was death but dodged Magnum PI 
 What up People, happy Fourth of July 
 On my street every year they fucking light up the sky 
 I get the beat nothing here, what they want me to write? 
 From the beach to the block, still banging at night
