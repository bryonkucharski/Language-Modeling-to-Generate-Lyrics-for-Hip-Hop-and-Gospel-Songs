Evidence: 
 As a kid ma hit me with the truth 
 Let me know Santa clause was never on my roof 
 When I lost a tooth, it never went under the pillow 
 I gave it to my parents' right there, they hit me with dough 
 Later on I was the all star pitcher 
 7th grade my girl hit me off, the World's different now 
 Got to whip a curve ball now 
 Plus Confidence, that's 3 strikes you're out 
 Junior high had all the Chicks was on top then 
 Got to high school shit wasn't poppin' 
 Small fish big pond Kinda got lost in 
 This new matrix started smoking weed often 
 I missed the whole 9th grade ditching class, getting no ass 
 Tryin' to get back to the past 
 The only thing I did do was make this music 
 Home Friday nights it was confusin 
 Things changed things I started to notice 
 The more work I put in, the more people focus 
 Was like "oh shit, this my ticket" 
 Enemies before, now tryin' to kick it 
 Pulled out my slump, imagine that 
 2 years I got my swagger back 
 In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make 
 Just a matter of time, that's a fact 
 On my mom's porch looking at the stars, tellin' joey child that's what we are 
 There we go, my soul, they'll never owe me 
 My crew rolled, the top, it won't be lonely 
 Planet Asia: 
 88, Malcolm x books, public enemy 
 Rockin' plain gear, same year lost my virginity 
 Packin gats we was that active 
 Middle school 7th grade pill bottles of crack in my jacket 
 89 got on some? shit 
 ? Full of Truth shit 
 Hangin' with the 8th grade n**** that chew shit 
 Back then we was still in cars 
 Give a damn if we knew you 
 Outside the neighbourhood? 
 9th grade twisted up high school better looking 
 Known as an MC 
 And I'm getting steady pussy 
 Don't hate the game, hate this player 
 Since the 6th grade I've been friends with Shake tha Mayor 
 Met Rasco in 1990 still grimy 
 Kicked out of school in 10th 
 But still graduated in 95'n 
 Remember me the kid who used to ditch school religiously 
 Who used to break-dance and centipede 
 12 years later and I'm still the same 
 This time I'm even more on top of the game 
 Here we go, my soul, they'll never owe me 
 My crew rolled, the top, it won't be lonely. 
 (The time is now, the moment that you waited for) 
 (It's time to move on I'm going for mine) 
 (I'm living for the day; this is my moment in time)
