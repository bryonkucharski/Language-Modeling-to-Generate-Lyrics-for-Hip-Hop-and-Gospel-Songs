(Evidence Talking) 
 Where I'm from they say the sun shine all the time 
 I keep seeing rain... yeah 
 (Evidence: Verse 1) 
 Uh, squeezing blood from a rock 
 Making something out nothing, that's something I got 
 That's one thing I had, while the others didn't get it 
 They was chasin the world I brought it right to my block 
 Brought it back to the (uff?) 
 Stay reppin my coast... poof, I was blowin' the spot 
 Without knowin' or not, not knowing a thing 
 Trying to prove to most, made it open my lane 
 I found my slot, they went right, E-V went left 
 So Common, one day it'll all make sense 
 Soundbombin'; no way we'll all make ends 
 Survival of the fit, a few win, but most quit 
 Or fend for themselves so here's to good health 
 Here's to drama, two up and one of 'em fell 
 "Hear, hear", to that, this is for my LA Cats 
 And Dogs who never left to the world, "We Back" *C'mon 
 Hook Aloe Black 
 Sometimes I ask myself, "Why would I need anyone else?" 
 To Be Determined 
 To make it through this life... when everything's a brand new (vibe?) 
 I had struggles in every single muscle, always on the hustle and I know... and I know I can't make it, on my own 
 (Elzhi: Verse 2) 
 Had visions of being caked up 
 On the island while the weather's freezing 
 Whether he's in the French Caribbean 
 Swimming with amphibians 
 Or in Hawaii blowing Maui Wowie, life is good 
 I dodge bullet grazes 
 Slash the nights that coulda ended my existence 
 For instance, through the persistence, the distance 
 We formed a number of statistics 
 Once a lot smaller looking up to Shot-callers, not ballers 
 We never grew up just got taller 
 Trying to find freedom in a trap 
 Hungry for success they eat up 
 There's food for thought I feed 'em in a w"Rap" 
 I'm taking trips to France 
 Make it rain where the strippers dance, dance 
 Sip in hand, grippin my money clips in hands 
 It was hell, I thought I saw demons hiding in lost souls 
 Straight out the evil books inside of my far scrolls 
 They say you should toss goals, throw away your dreams 
 That nothing go the way it seems, It's done or 
 You feelin' unsure, but that's what this one's for 
 Chorus: [Once] 
 (Aloe Blacc: Verse 3) 
 Push as hard as you want, against the wall bro 
 Push the wall, knew they be looking for you like Waldo 
 Times was harder than before, when it was fun and games 
 When we was just spittin' rhymes trying to get a bigger name 
 Now car notes involved and bills require grindin' 
 Who'd ever thought that Aloe Blacc get back to rhymin' 
 Street philosophers could theorize, "it's all timin'" 
 Economist would say, "It's kinda rough to find a diamond" 
 And all the simple lining in the clouds couldn't change 
 The simple fact that it pours when it rains 
 All more of the same 
 And my score in the game, let it reflect 
 That I earn every little bit of respect I get 
 (Aloe Blacc Singing) 
 Oh, it's time, get up off the wall cross that line 
 My momma told me that every flower needs rain shower 
 Like it need sunshine 
 I know I can make it, you know you can make it, We can make it 
 If you get on yo Grind...
