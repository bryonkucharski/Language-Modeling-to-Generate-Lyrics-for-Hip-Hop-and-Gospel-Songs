They say that when it rains it pours, they're right 
 Falling from out of the sky 
 (It's falling down on me) 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Falling from out of the sky 
 When I forgot to close the blinds I couldn't sleep 
 Kept waking up from all the shine, glare in my eyes 
 I'm off three hours, eat, sleep, repeat grind again 
 It's what he does that others don't do is what's defining him 
 I never would've thought the words wrote on a page 
 Would have me on the other side of Earth on a stage 
 I never would've thought there was a stage on Earth 
 That made me feel more at home besides my place of birth 
 I'm from gun slinging CA where every movie's watched 
 Then watched back for instant replay 
 So many days and nights with ink bleeding papers 
 Fall asleep on flights, call it sleeping with strangers 
 Now back to the City of Angels where the rain is 
 Falling from out of the sky 
 (It's falling down on me) 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 I simplify by design, my words get scribed 
 To the vinyl when they rhyme, mark it with a scribe 
 Count lessons, toes, fingers, I'm alive 
 I've passed so many lows to survive all the highs 
 I've learned some things and others learned to tolerate (like what?) 
 You can be a day short but not a dollar late 
 New day in rain, chain link, put it together 
 Beat the drum, pray for rain, we ain't the same under the weather 
 Just me against the world on the verge of relentless 
 Trying to stay apart like each word of the sentence 
 King vs. apprentice, champ vs. challenger 
 The challenger swung, the champ fell, they kicked him out of there 
 I throw raps to sea in a bottle to float 
 Like a lost SOS that the novelist wrote 
 The wind blew and popped the top, they read the letter 
 To whom it may concern, my sick words under the weather 
 Falling from out of the sky 
 (It's falling down on me) 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 So I forgot to change the time showing up early 
 With my money on my mind trying to keep from crime 
 One of a kind, I'm defined by my environment 
 For everything I did from inception to retirement 
 'Cause I be running on unleaded fumes 
 Collecting money back for sacks fronted for the rent is due 
 A daydreamer still running towards the rainbow's ending 
 Knowing damn well, the gold wasn't meant for spending 
 You ten cents from a nickel in your pocket 
 Shit, I'm thirty short of twenty dollars in my wallet, yeah 
 You might need twelve fingers for the runners 
 Maybe six on the hand, half a dozen on the other 
 I bundle up brown gloves for the summer 
 Shorts in the winter with a slicker and umbrella 
 A fella chasing cheese like he running a maze 
 But really I'm just running in place, I need the bread to start 
 Falling from out of the sky 
 (It's falling down on me) 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Praying come down, fall down 
 Falling from out of the sky
