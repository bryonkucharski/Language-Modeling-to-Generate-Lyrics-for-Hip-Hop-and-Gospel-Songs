Born in LA, it's hard to get star-struck 
 Born in LA so I always keep my guard up 
 Born in LA, must deal where I stay 
 Everyday, everyday, everyday 
 (Chace Infinite) 
 I'm from a city that breeds death, multiple shots firing 
 Home of the violent niggas wilding, half-city half-island 
 I was born in the wood, raised in the San Fernando valley 
 Where there's eses and mostly Bloods 
 Big family so I had covers from different hoods 
 That taught me the landscape of the city and I was good 
 Driven by the desire to document the lives under fire 
 Then present it to you through the wire 
 Had to struggle with gang codes and navigate a path 
 Through the maze of Los Angeles becoming a man 
 Hopes become smoking the lung up here in the can 
 These streets respect killers and I'm just a man 
 But yet it's still ? remember that Chace told ya 
 The nation is infected by LA gang culture 
 I'm an all-game reporter live from the center 
 Where respected as an artist and a thorough street, nigga 
 My birthplace, my home, and I'll be buried on Prairie across the street from where I was born in LA 
 (Evidence) 
 I'm from a place where stars are born 
 Weather is never cold, hearts are never warm 
 The gang capital, night time injection, cut life is lethal 
 And daytime is a sunny place for shady people 
 It's your boy, my father stole his son out the hospital 
 No loot wasn't stopping his joy, had it popping 
 Raised in Santa Monica till their divorce 
 Six years old, I couldn't see what was coming 
 Of course the plan, mom bounced on old man 
 Then we moved to the Venice sand 
 A young youth seen gangs firsthand 
 Faked address for school, two educations 
 Rich friends then back to my land 
 You was hard where I'm from, it's a well-known fact 
 Whether a white cat, brown, or black 
 When you heard shots it was never from starter pistols 
 Every night's Fourth of July, launch your missiles 
 LA is different since my best friend is gone 
 Some moved locations, some just moved on (Rest in peace) 
 The neighbourhood changed, new faces came along 
 Had me asking myself if this a place I belong 
 My hustle is strong, I'm up before them 
 Rap caffeine marathon long, determined 
 Venice, California, 90291, let's go 
 (Sick Jacken) 
 I got a sixth sense for danger man, a second-hand nature for war 
 The biggest rivals in my city is the law 
 I'm from that Pico Union district homie, fuckk what you thought 
 We got trees, windows, and raw, whatever you on 
 I'm just a pawn in that federal plan to get us all on 
 A nice little high, shoot each other for crumbs 
 One by one, dying from wars that's won by none 
 Some might come and make a bastard out of my son 
 So I'm strapped with a gun making sure the axis that come 
 From my body are only medicine pass through my lungs 
 I got that downtown psyche, Cortez with a Nike logo 
 Locos like me treated pipes like wifeys 
 Buying up and down the blocks nightly 
 Don't take my block lightly 
 We're screwed up like everybody in the world might be 
 Born into Union the 17th out the womb 
 In the 70's repping Lost Angels through the musical melodies
