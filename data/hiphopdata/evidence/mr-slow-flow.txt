Go, step it up 
 Hear me, feel the funk, yeah 
 I can smoke a whole eighth in a spliff 
 Some call that a problem but I call it a gift 
 Hit the clutch then I start to shift 
 Turn it up light my Dutch then start to drift 
 Lost Angel, Westside rider 
 The official, 405 Friday, sound provider 
 Underground hit man, hard to hire 
 Unsigned death threats written in typewriters 
 Poetic, I'm that type of writer 
 Got that 'don't call me-I'll call you' type of fire 
 Fake it 'til you make it, you're such a good liar 
 Headliners used to not make the flyer 
 401K and I don't mean retire 
 Chase loops, still war all day, I'm in denial 
 Peace ain't the word to play it's violence 
 I ain't have shit good to say, so here's silence 
 "I slow flows y'all to death" 
 Yeah, don't stress, emotions rest 
 'Til they wanna see my best, as good as it gets 
 Don't hold weak cards, don't hold regrets 
 Players, don't change past the seventh inning stretch 
 Learned from vets and they ain't pet doctors 
 They the type they arrest in 'Clockers' 
 We sellin' out these operas and don't mean sing 
 I mean opera house stage we rockin' 
 C-A, all day reppin' it, party time, excellent 
 It's perfection kid, I'm not affectionate 
 That's what my last girl said, "Too much estrogen" 
 (I'm in trouble) 
 Yeah, that ain't PC 
 But sometimes that ain't E-V 
 (What can I do?) 
 I just feel that way 
 Right now I'm on my J-O, issue payroll 
 Speak in codes, 'til we reach another day 
 "I slow flows y'all to death" 
 (Ay, light another one man) 
 I used to be Ice-T 'Reckless' 
 (Reckless) 
 Wild out like I'd never see breakfast 
 Nightmares, tyin' dream catchers 
 Tryin' to run breathless, outta control 
 I don't give orders, I make suggestions 
 Then walk away, I've learned my lessons 
 (Ev have patience) 
 It's simple, they neglect it 
 Win at chess, still lose at checkers 
 That ain't weakness, it's a death wish 
 Choke 'em out, another off the checklist 
 I came too far not to be respected 
 And drove too far to hear 
 They closed the guest list 
 (You gotta be kiddin' me) 
 A new rain out the smokin' bar 
 Umbrellas up, these cats are dogs 
 And just because it barely ever hails in L.A. 
 They say, I can't reign the game 
 And hail from L.A., they crazy 
 "I slow flows y'all to death" 
 When 50 roll, they say what's the MO 
 Another rapper was hit by Mr. Slow Flow 
 "By Mr. Slow Flow" 
 That's what they call me this year
