Five star general spit, hush them niggas 
 I star, why even discuss them niggas? 
 By far, I'm the shit, flush them niggas 
 Fuck them niggas, I'ma crush them niggas 
 Chrome heater, street sweeper 
 Gun shots get deeper, cough up a lung and a liter 
 Twelve shot Nine now, one of my new pets 
 And when these twins squeeze it sounds like duets 
 Nigga burn, yeah, my Fam learn to earn 
 We got shit locked with no key holes to turn 
 Platinum Navigator, easy when you earn a buck 
 It's like a big fuckin' beeper when you turn it up 
 Shit vibratin' 
 Hoes titties bouncin', rubbin' all on my shit, bitch try waitin' 
 Straight to the telly huh, Sauce got angles to hit 
 Billboards triangles and shit 
 And who's Jeter? The Don Juan for you Don Con's 
 In the double Nine Yukon, tote two arms 
 From Brooknam till death do 
 And I bet you when I spit shots they connect to dead you 
 Lil' monkeys postin' for wreck 
 They get trapped up and extorted for your toast and your vest 
 I'm no joke, so laugh and be laughin' to death 
 And if you think it's so simple, you'll be gassed and then left 
 It's the game tight nigga, chain two below 
 I'm a Gigolo Mommy, the fame I ain't fo' 
 The foes I don't hate, hoes I don't chase 
 Henny I drink straight, my money is big faced 
 For you small change niggas who playin' to ball 
 I got six digits now, what you playin' it for? 
 I'm the youngest out of Marcy and the shit don't stop 
 Steppin' up to the top 'bout to have shit locked. 
 You want hits? We got hits 
 Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop 
 Everybody's topless 
 (Sunstroke) 
 Hennessey shots and fly bitches 
 (Gun smoke) 
 The enemies plot on my riches 
 You want hits? We got hits 
 Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop 
 Everybody's topless 
 (Sunstroke) 
 Hennessey shots and fly bitches 
 (Gun smoke) 
 The enemies plot on my riches 
 My automatic stoutest be off balance 
 Gun with the silence 
 Outta state, mad mileage 
 Your crew wild but we the wildest 
 Switch my trigger finger often to prevent a callus 
 For me many Men hold malice, I react with violence 
 Since we tryin' to double the dough, we double the sins 
 Even the gnats is double now lookin' like fraternal twins 
 The rap killings be serial 
 The FEDS tried to link Da Rainjahz to the crime 
 Through the use of genetic material 
 I'm takin' all bets, who want it? 
 Wise, hard to touch, weavin' shit like Prince Naseem Hamed 
 The flow is Ten karat and your lyrics is poor 
 Big horse, plus you walk like your salads been tossed 
 Smoke the explosion, rock second hand gold that's stolen 
 Straight haul off and smack a nigga just for posin' 
 Bleed Hennessey, rhyme like there's Ten of me 
 So you remember me? 
 Every verse, I'm on should be considered a felony 
 Why the fuck niggas be hatin'? I don't even know 
 Niggas need to go ahead with them outdated flows 
 Da Rainjahz 'cause precipitation, and we rain in this bitch like 
 Hurricane Mitch 
 Fuck the fame, son, I'm in it for the dough and another whip 
 Ghetto cracked out on some other shit 
 Style switch, leave the whole city dark like the Mothership 
 Y'all know the half, I hold the Nine with the rubber grip 
 Seen less, y'all re-imported by the government 
 If I wasn't rappin' I'd be on the corners bubblin' 
 Doublin' my cream on a triple beam 
 Instead I keep the team tight and feel like ain't shit gon' divide us 
 Not even riches, not even bitches 
 Look now, niggas of the World stay paintin' pictures 
 Of the inner-city realness 
 Who can relate? roll and fat one and feel this 
 We put it down 
 You want hits? We got hits 
 Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop 
 Everybody's topless 
 (Sunstroke) 
 Hennessey shots and fly bitches 
 (Gun smoke) 
 The enemies plot on my riches
