My watch, my ring 
 Post up with drugs, with xans 
 I'm falling in love, Kirby my drank 
 Money on deck, meet me in the back 
 Remixing and pouring the drink 
 Leandoer fuck what you think 
 I'm Mind fucking these girls like a shrink 
 Cannes, Cannon, my balls make you sink 
 I'm flipping the pack, money pink 
 SBE in this bitch I got stink 
 Came through with a rug and a mink 
 I'm geeking, my Balmain all pink 
 Whitearm, smoking dope, make it stink 
 They call me up when I link 
 Bitch I just left in flight 
 I'm falling I'm falling on sight 
 I think that she might be my type 
 Prada shades on my face I'm alright 
 My chain black and my diamonds white 
 Fuck all the fame and the hype 
 Lean 
 My watch, my ring 
 Post up with drugs, with xans 
 I'm falling in love, Kirby in my drank 
 Money on deck, meet me in the back 
 My watch, my ring 
 Pass me the drugs, and xans 
 I'm falling in love, Kirby my drank 
 Money on deck, meet me in the back
