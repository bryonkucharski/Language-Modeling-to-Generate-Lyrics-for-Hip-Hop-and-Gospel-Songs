We were on the throne, living on our own 
 Hunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in) 
 She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands 
 Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect 
 Wrist, diamonds, ice, neon green lights 
 Don't care about the price, I cop it, I smash it, this size 
 Wrist, diamonds, ice, percocet, my Sprite 
 Percys in my Sprite, Louis bag, three stripes 
 As I walk through the fire with my wings 
 I could only stop for this iron like a lane 
 She just want to pop all the molly in the Benz 
 I've been getting rich, making money with my friends 
 Bitch, we off them shits, time to stay until the end 
 I'm just trynna pop all the bottles, fuck the feds 
 I got 50 pills all up in our money bags 
 She gon' watch how I spend it, like, just to get it back 
 Sitting on the field, snakes through the money tracks 
 Breaking in and entering, bitch we popping tags 
 Keep the fire burning off a blunt like candle wax 
 Burning down your money 'til it ain't nothing to stack 
 We were on the throne, living on our own 
 Hunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in) 
 She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands 
 Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect 
 Flick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite 
 Living my life, I'm alright, shawty, she my type 
 Die for this I might, chains all freeze outside 
 Flick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite 
 As I hop by the avenue with my wings 
 Baby don't stop, wanna give you everything 
 When we off them rocks, I'mma tell you everything 
 Soap on my shoes and on my heart, it's getting thin 
 But you're a butterfly riding through the desert winds 
 I'm a really bad, I love all the finer things 
 When I come close, close to you I can't sin 
 Heaven knows I'm bad, but Lord, I can't fix a thing 
 Fly too close to the sun, my wings give in 
 I gave you my whole life, don't owe you a thing 
 As I chose life and this rug made of mink 
 Burning down the Winter 'cause I'm over everything 
 We were on the throne, living on our own (Leandoer stranger) 
 Hunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in) 
 She just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands 
 Make a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect
