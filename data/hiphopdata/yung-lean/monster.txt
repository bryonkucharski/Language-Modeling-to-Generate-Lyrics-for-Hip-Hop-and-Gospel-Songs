I got electricity running through my veins 
 I got everything who am I to blame 
 Stand like the flowers in the rain 
 Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane 
 Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow 
 Time running through my hands, I have to let it go, have to let it go 
 In the shadows of the city of my mind nothing matters anymore it's just a matter of time 
 Until we fall back and meet again feed my needs again 
 Posted with my friends I resurrect to rise again 
 They call me crazy at least they talking straight 
 _ First so they listen now that's my _ 
 Cop a real estate out in winterland made it out 
 Bless my fate 
 Just be you it's never too late 
 All I do is great 
 Sprinkle the hash let me live fast 
 Show up last with the biggest bands 
 Least love for the biggest fans 
 I'm a weirdo so to the weirdos I give back 
 Roses in my bathtub, leave your blood in a black mug 
 Used to be a hobby now it's all I think about 
 That's what rap does 
 Too many lames tryna do what I've done 
 Silk print loafers I don't work for no one 
 Moving through the city and I just begun 
 Too many lames tryna do what I've done 
 Silk print loafers I don't work for no one 
 Moving through the city, Yung Lean SBE just begun
