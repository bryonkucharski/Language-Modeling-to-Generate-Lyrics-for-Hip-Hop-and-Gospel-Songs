 Shawty what you sippin' on, Gatorade 
 Shawty what you smokin' on, lemonade 
 I'm up in the sky, finna elevate 
 Mix it with some kool-aid 
 Pop 'em pills 'cause I get paid 
 Galaxy boys 
 Reality is far away 
 Liquid love got me floatin' away 
 Up in the club, Grey Goose every day 
 Stacks on racks till my mind starts melting away 
 Smoking that jay 
 Posted in the bay 
 SADBOYS sippin' Arizona day by day 
 Day by day I goes away 
 Swerving swerving on this iced tea 
 Yung Gud Shorty posted with that DMT 
 Hash in the pipe is ABC 
 Cut their wrists and lay 'em down gently 
 Leopard colored backseat in my Bentley 
 Relently I pop two pills too many 
 I don't give a fuck I brought plenty 
 (Champagne and lobster it's a rich kid party 
 You know what it do Yung Lean Doer shawty 
 Rockin' bravo bravo charlie 
 Sippin' on Barcadi) 
 Skinny bitches they die quick 
 Grim reaper on my dick 
 Fuck her from the back ain't that some shit 
 Cum in her face I ain't scared to die 
 I'm in my zone with my team I'm so high 
 I'm spaced out Arizona iced out yeah I'm that guy 
 Neon polar bears I drink iced tea all day 
 Catch me in a Hummer with your mother and Macy Gray 
 Million ways posted up in the Milky Way 
 Silky lake with a couple hundred bills to pay 
 Stuck in a Monday with Bill all day 
 Neon lights and I swerve around
