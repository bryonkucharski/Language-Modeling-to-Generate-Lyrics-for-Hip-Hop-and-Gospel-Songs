(Fade in) 
 Sun on my neck 
 I'll ride for my set 
 No remorse, no respect 
 Press play as I wreck 
 I got sun on my neck 
 I'll ride for my set 
 Big 's' on my chain 
 Everything high tech 
 I got sun on my neck 
 I'll ride for my set 
 No remorse, no respect 
 Dope in my air force 
 I got sun on my neck 
 Press play as I press wreck 
 A big 's' on my chain 
 Everything high tech 
 Put it down for Princess Peach 
 But you could never hear me preach 
 I'm in the mountains in the trees 
 I'm smoking silver - eyes Chinese 
 I'll blow and puff, and I'll pass around 
 I'll make the catch, don't make a sound 
 Fuck what you heard the city's mine 
 The city's mine, I'll put it down 
 I'll put it down for everyone around me 
 You could try and look for me 
 But you could never find me 
 Get behind me 
 I'm hearing police sirens 
 I'm smoking burnt tires 
 I got spirit flowers wasting money every hour 
 You don't like me, you a liar 
 I'm a-I'm a sacrificer 
 Get my palace like I'm Malice 
 Floating floating floating empire 
 All I do is get higher, never tired 
 You can't touch me, 'cause I'm made of wire 
 Pick my phone up call the supplier 
 I spit fire, ice-ice red vampire 
 Icy diamond sapphire 
 Bitch I am an empire 
 Flying through the dessert 
 Move I like my dress shirts 
 Face filled with dirt 
 Curren-currency convert
