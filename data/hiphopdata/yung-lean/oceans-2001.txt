Sad Boys, 2002 
 Unknown Death, 2001 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 You can find me if you look in your mind too 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 You can find me if you look in your mind too, I'ma 
 I'ma get a chopper, I'ma, get a chopper 
 Shoot that ho in the face before she try to stop ya' 
 Yung Lean, so fucking proper 
 Sad Boys, we own choppers 
 Put her in that body bag, the ocean's where I'll drop her 
 Eat her out, wipe my face with a serviette 
 Rich, feeling legs 
 Creeping in the cut, with a Tommy gun 
 I'ma stomp on your fondue 
 Face looking like Scooby Doo, the groovy one 
 Cannibus, anthrax, paid fast, get stacks 
 Count racks, cash checks, and all that 
 Bad breath, LSD right, creeping 'round like a lab rat 
 Eat her out, kit kat 
 Shorty we can take it real slow, if you wanna 
 Sex and pills, Lean got the marijuana 
 I got so much ice, and these ice creams cost one hunna' 
 You know we gon make it hot, like the summer 
 Shorty she a runner, me so smart, and I can buy you drinks 
 I got money like Obama, Internet Explorer 
 Boys, bitch, we dumb, dumber 
 Hit that cut up, fire shots, make you run up 
 Hit that club up, fire shots, make you run up 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 You can find me if you look in your mind too 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 The ocean's where they'll find you 
 You can find me if you look in your mind too 
 I'ma, I'ma get a chopper, I'ma, get a chopper 
 Shoot that ho in the face before she try to stop ya' 
 Yung Lean, so fucking proper 
 Sad Boys, we own choppers 
 Put her in that body bag, the ocean's where I'll drop her 
 Lean slice it up 
 BBC, straight, finna bust a nut 
 Sad Boys in the place, lock your daughters up 
 Smoking these greens, killing these fiends 
 Pickin' a mullet with some fucking baked greens 
 Little chain explosive, I'm fast, I'm C-4 
 Wake up in the morning and I'm married to a dinosaur 
 Her vagina's sore 
 Click clack click like the liquor store 
 Living life like we in Baltimore 
 Tell the preacher it's a folklore 
 What, for? What, for? 
 Switched out the Ferrari from the double door 
 Smoking Sherman like I'm Dumbledore 
 Humble, poor 
 Hungry hippos and we finna rob the liquor store 
 And we finna rob the liquor store 
 Lean got plenty more 
 Sad Boys, we done opened the door 
 Sad Boys smoking plenty draw 
 Shouts out to Gregar
