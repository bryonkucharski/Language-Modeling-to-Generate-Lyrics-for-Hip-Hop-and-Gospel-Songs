Get it back 
 Get it back 
 Get it back 
 Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack 
 Pull up to the club, and I'm back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack 
 Tatts on my wrist, neon coloured stacks 
 Bitch she gave me heart attack, but I'm back, yes I'm back 
 Yes I'm back 
 Yes I'm back 
 Yes I'm back 
 Yes I'm back 
 I've been around the globe so many cities, man 
 I've fucked a girl in every state but I don't give a fuck 
 I been with my man's, peach coloured grams 
 Pull up to the club and my ice gave me an ice attack 
 I be with Bladee, Sherman 'n' em 
 Pull up with Whitearmorr and we counting blue M&M's 
 I was out here in Cali 
 I was with Bally 
 Pull up in a 'Rari 
 I don't like the talking 
 I don't like the talking 
 All my dogs be barking 
 She call me yeah she stalk me 
 She call me yeah she stalk me 
 She on me 
 It's a good day 
 I just poured a 4 up in my cup 
 Spent some money then I get it back 
 Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack 
 Pull up to the club, and I'm back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Diamonds on my wrist, give me an ice attack 
 Tatts on my wrist, neon coloured stacks 
 Bitch she gave me heart attack, but I'm back, yes I'm back
