Eternal life 
 Make my city proud 
 Fuck everyone, king without a crown 
 Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up 
 Just got a check, might burn it up 
 Lost at life, I don't boost up 
 All this time flies away in my coffee cup 
 I like being alone, shut the fuck up 
 Sad Alliance ballin' out in Europe 
 I got Gucci, Louis, APC gear on 
 Live in Winterland, but I'm iced up 
 See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up 
 See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up 
 See me flying high, I got no love 
 Pull up to the spot with my Range Rover 
 See me flying high, I got no love 
 Pull up to the spot with my Rover 
 Eternal life 
 Make my city proud 
 Fuck everyone, king without a crown 
 Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up 
 Just got a check, might burn it all
