I don't want to hurt you 
 Movin' 'round in circles 
 Will do if I have to 
 All I do is work you 
 I got Gs on Gs like burgers 
 Move it 'round like lurkers 
 I lost all my urges 
 Pink polo, paint a circus 
 Insert money, insert through 
 Life is like a drive through 
 I guess I could die soon 
 I feel like a typhoon 
 Smell like weed and perfume 
 Smurf, blue pills like swirls 
 All I smoke is herbal 
 Products, them be purple 
 Mail box clean, Donald Duck lungs 
 I need a million dollars, not some bucks, son 
 Duck 1, duck 2, paint a truck, son 
 When we roll up, Gucci mags on my truck, son 
 We'll come from pop anthrax 
 Air max, we got 10 stacks 
 I be smokin' tear gas 
 Percocet, that's a fear fact 
 Yeah, I got my gear back 
 Don't hold tears from years back 
 Don't think we don't hear that 
 Fuckin' up, he don't hear that 
 I'm smokin' on nitrous oxide 
 Holdin' shit down, I got mine 
 My eyes red just like a stop sign 
 I'm number 1, not no top 5 
 I'm blood gang, cap gang, 4l 
 Pills, weed, molly, xanax for sale 
 Got shooters out South, you don't know well 
 They'll pull up right to your doorbell 
 I'm too iced out, I'm a snowman 
 Oh, ride in the foreign get low ragged 
 I'm out in Chiraq where it's cold at 
 Went two nights and blow caps 
 Yeah, glo gang I own that 
 Pull up on your block, blow your skull cap 
 And I ain't really wit no romance 
 'Cause I'm too busy callin' up the dope man 
 Shooters all on my roster 
 The whole team tryna get sponsored 
 I'm jumpin' shit, Travis Barker 
 Your blunt is like a pencil, mines a marker, whaa 
 And I see you're a talker 
 So to shut ya ass up will be a motherfuckin' honor 
 It's me and Yung Lean, no receipts 
 Smokin' dope even though it's some shrimp and lobster 
 Whaa
