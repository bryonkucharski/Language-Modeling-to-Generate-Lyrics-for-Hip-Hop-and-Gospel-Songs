Sad Boys 
 (*Coughs*) 
 Yung Sherman on the beat man, Yung Sherm 
 I don't care about money so yeah I spend it quick 
 I'm a real life mannequin, get it then I dip 
 In a percocet river I got gills like a fish 
 Look like they wanna kill me, but they can only wish 
 I hop by the whip, making rain in that fin 
 All this ice make you drip, she got blood on her lip 
 I got tired of that shit, so I erase my wish 
 Fuck being famous, I don't need all that shit 
 High! High! You high like me? 
 Why, why they stare at me? (Sad Boys) 
 Fly, fly! Get fly like me (like me) 
 Ride, ride! All time baby 
 Ravens guard that house 
 I just keep them within 
 You presume that you know me, you don't know where I've been 
 Tree house of horror tryna' heal from within 
 Everything is dusty but to me is still mint 
 Can't trust myself, I keep changing the shit 
 Keep thinking back, but I don't need what I miss 
 Aquarium of life inside my mind, this is trip (They good) 
 Much better, now I just don't understand it 
 I still love you to death, Louis V on my hip 
 Snakes around my house and my clocks don't tick 
 I still love you to death, Louis V on my hip 
 Snakes around my house and my clocks don't tick
