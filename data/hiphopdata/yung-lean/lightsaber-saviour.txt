Bitches on my dick 'cause I'm so luxurious 
 Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour 
 Optimus Prime 
 Do her from behind, 
 Police knocking on my door I've done my time, 
 Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind, 
 I'm grinding grinding, 
 Sad boys they be shining shining, 
 Focus on whining whining 
 When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying 
 Why do I gotta be alive, 
 I ain't about that life I ain't bout that life 
 Fuck all of y'all no one can tell me shit 
 I'm with my team I'm so high please get up off my dick, 
 I love nature and everything around me 
 But when an eye press into find me 
 I'm on the floor crying, crying 
 Sad boys says that I'm dying, dying 
 Rocks got me chipping 
 Pussy starts a-dripping 
 I might just have to slip in 
 Grey Goose sipping 
 Pink skies got me tripping 
 Never catch me slippin', never catch me slippin' 
 High-tec polo gear sipping 
 Up that Jack when I'm in Arizona flipping 
 Sushi bars after bars catch me whipping 
 Up that ho while she dripping 
 Glock in my Gucci belt got you equipping 
 Anime shawtys be stripping 
 I get paid by the bars but you never catch me slipping 
 No you never get me slipping 
 I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to die.
