 SBE Bitch 
 I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out 
 I hop out, roll up 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out 
 I hop out, roll up 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 Tinted windows 'round my fucking bitch 
 And I'm still riding in the 6 
 And I'm still trapping like a bitch 
 Your bitch on my motherfucking dick 
 I still ride around the town on some tents 
 Boys can't fuck with me cause they some simps 
 Come up in the booth and heat the shit 
 I serve your mommy and daddy cause I'm the shit 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out 
 I hop out, roll up 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 I'm bossed up, cashed out 
 Rocks up, stacks out 
 It's a dream, shawty you already know I'm fucking cashing out 
 Scarface bitch, now you know there ain't no backing out 
 Hit em up don't fuck around 
 All these boys wanna come around 
 They used to hear me, they don't make a sound 
 SBE in your town tonight 
 You know we bring ice out 
 You know shawty has stacks out 
 Lean just brought that pack out 
 (?) bar and we sippin' 
 I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out 
 I hop out, roll up 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 I'm flexed up, I'm cashed out 
 I hop out, roll up 
 Tinted windows on the shits, you know I got my bands up 
 Tinted windows with my bitch she riding with her xans up 
 Xans out, bands out 
 You know how we do
