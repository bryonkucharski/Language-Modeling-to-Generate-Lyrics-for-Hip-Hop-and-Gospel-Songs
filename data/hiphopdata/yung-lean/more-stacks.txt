Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker 
 We will fly high they below us 
 Bitch I'm runnin' on the road to the money bus 
 My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs 
 My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns 
 I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus 
 More cash, more stacks and there's more of us 
 Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us 
 I got bucks in my louis bags, bags under my eyes 
 Lean up in the club I'm smoking winnin' gettin' fried 
 Fuck these other guys Imma do this till I die 
 Pink polo dirty stacks 24/7, 9-5 
 I need a new ring and I need another pill 
 Still in Yoshi City rollin' rollin' down the hill 
 I need a new high I need a new life 
 I need a hundred million roses on me when I die 
 Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker 
 We will fly high they below us 
 Bitch I'm runnin' on the road to the money bus 
 My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs 
 My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns 
 I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus 
 More cash, more stacks and there's more of us 
 Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us 
 Ah, for us 
 More stacks for us 
 Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker 
 We will fly high they below us 
 Bitch I'm runnin' on the road to the money bus 
 My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs 
 My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns 
 I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus 
 More cash, more stacks and there's more of us 
 Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us 
 For us 
 For us 
 More stacks 
 For us 
 Ah Ah
