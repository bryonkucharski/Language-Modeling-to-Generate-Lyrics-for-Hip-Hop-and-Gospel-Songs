 Hurt me, you can never hurt me 
 Hurt me, you can never hurt me

 Leandoer 
 Cool wind over my face, I need peace 
 Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave 
 Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi 
 I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me 
 Cool wind over my face, I need peace 
 Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave 
 Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi 
 I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me 
 Fucking these bitches, I'm out of control 
 Walkin' the bank and got coke on my clothes 
 Robitussin on me, when I'm fuckin' a hoe 
 Trippin' on flo's, sap of them both 
 Got one Xanax, and three to go 
 Bitch, that's how it goes 
 Bitch, I'm a ghost 
 Like Bruce Willis, I am a ghost 
 (Hit it from the back, then I have to go) 
 Coppin' these Rolls, euros my nose 
 Live up the road, fuck what you know 
 I just broke up with my girlfriend, now I am back on the go 
 Gotta stack these stacks, when I'm fuckin' her slow 
 I'm single tonight, tell all your friends 
 So I got bitch hoes 
 Bitch, I'm a ghost 
 Bitch, I'm a ghost 
 Leandoer! 
 Cool wind over my face, I need peace 
 Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave 
 Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi 
 I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me 
 Cool wind over my face, I need peace 
 Cool city, crystal living, I can't leave 
 Diamonds dancing on ice, look just like Bambi 
 I'm a vampire, you can never hurt me

 Sad Boys, A$AP Mob, we're up in this bitch 
 Young Trap Lord on the block 
 Fuck with it, get money, I got a lot 
 All of my niggas is real 
 All of my niggas is trill 
 And dammit I'm taking the wheel 
 Leany is gone off a pill 
 All these diamonds on me dancin' 
 On ice like I'm Bambi 
 Pool party at the mansion 
 Trophy bitches fuck a Grammy 
 Sittin' pretty in a Bentley 
 Rest In Peace, my nigga Yammy
