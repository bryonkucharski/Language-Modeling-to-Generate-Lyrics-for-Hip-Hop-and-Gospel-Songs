 Adamn Killa 
 Bitch I'm out in Europe like I'm out here on vacation 
 But I'm doing shows touring across the nation 
 If you want it, gotta get it like it ain't no waitin' 
 Bitch I want it right now, I don't got no patience 
 Niggas be broke 'cause they got all the patience 
 Don't know the currency so I don't know what I'm paying 
 Bitch I'm Adamn, that is what I'm saying 
 All this foreign money I can't count what I'm making 
 There's me, Lean, whitearmor and we out here baby 
 I don't want no baby, killavesi is my baby 
 Bitch I'm Adamn, all the hot boys they like hating 
 I can't save no thot 'cause these bitches they got rabies

 Yung Lean 
 I be cashin 
 Shawty splashin 
 What you know about Lean, I'm getting stacks 
 I'm on the frozen throne I might just catch it 
 Angels falling in my soul, money stacking, gucci cologne 
 Got cash got bags my bros 
 Many men wanna kill me, I don't know 
 Why they trying to get me I just blow 
 Money and coke up in my nose 
 Percs in my system, I'm never slow 
 Golden noise running round the floor 
 I sit down in the frozen throne 
 She called me up and called me on the phone 
 She fucked me over once, someone that I know 
 I be getting dough 
 Soldiers from white snow 
 Moola in my rover 
 With Adamn killing my soul 
 Fuck with Lean I break your bones 
 Fuck with Lean I break your bones 
 Moola in my rover
