I don't give a fuck, I just don't do 
 Pill poppin' in the club with my whole crew 
 Billionaire Boys Club, sweater is brand new 
 Like everything I do is brand new 
 Now I'm trippin' on that cash flow 
 Still the same dude with a nice flow 
 Flex that ass, shawty drop it real low 
 Shawty goes to pick up dollars all on the flo' 
 Lean Doer with these bitches and hoes 
 I'm a nice guy and it really goes to prove 
 Now I'm trippin', all I wanna know 
 Now I'm sippin', Bacardi in the club 
 Now I'm trippin', like I always do 
 Up in the club, sippin' Grey Goose 
 Keep my Polo fitted, now I make noose 
 Turn up in the club sippin' on that Grey Goose 
 Got that vodka and that orange juice 
 Everything I do is to show I'm brand new 
 I don't give a fuck what you say 
 Suck my fuckin' dick and who will run this bitch? 
 Who will? Lean will, Lean will, Lean will, Lean, lean, lean, lean 
 Now I'm trippin' (brand new) 
 Now I'm sippin', like I always do 
 Now I'm trippin', still the same dude 
 Yeah I got that fashion with Bape shirt 
 And I'll have ya steam turned up, shawty and panties all free 
 Now I'm trippin' like I always do 
 Now I'm sippin', sippin' on Grey Goose 
 Trippin', I always seem to do 
 Go up in the club, but nothing's brand new
