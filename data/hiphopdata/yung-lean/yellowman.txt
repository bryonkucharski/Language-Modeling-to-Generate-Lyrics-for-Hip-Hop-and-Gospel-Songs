(Sadboys) 
 Walk away, I'll fade to grey, but not today 
 As long as you are here I'll be okay 
 Now, I wanna walk, wanna walk today 
 If my life not in grey I'll walk today 
 I'll, I'll be your yellowman carcosa land 
 I'll be your spaceman, your walking hand 
 But not today, want to fade away 
 But I keep going (going everyday) 
 See me moving out of foreigns slow 
 She just wanna spend my dough 
 Moving out of dungeons slow 
 Watch just how I shine and glow 
 Louis Vuitton on me, hoe 
 Draped up in silk all my 'robe 
 Shadows with me where I go 
 Bag over my face - freakshow 
 Fuck with me I'll bring you down 
 Whole crowd they don't make a sound 
 Watch the ravens fly around 
 I don't care about your sound 
 You could try and talk to me 
 Visions of reality 
 We are slow but we are clowns 
 Popping downers, no more crowns
