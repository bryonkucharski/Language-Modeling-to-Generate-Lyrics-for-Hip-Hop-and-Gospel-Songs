 I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you 
 You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true 
 When I go to sleep all I ever see is you 
 I can be your savior, everything that we've been through 
 I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you 
 You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true 
 When I go to sleep all I ever see is you 
 I can be your savior, everything that we've been through 
 I be grinding making money, it's for me and you 
 I love the way you dancing and your top is see through 
 We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through 
 Money in my pocket and you know I want you 
 I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you 
 Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you 
 When I was in the hospital I saw you 
 I know what you're feeling inside 'cause I feel you 
 I gotta stay true, my money rain blue 
 Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you 
 I know what you're feeling inside 'cause I know I feel you 
 My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon 
 I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you 
 You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true 
 When I go to sleep all I ever see is you 
 I can be your savior, everything that we've been through 
 I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you 
 You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true 
 When I go to sleep all I ever see is you 
 I can be your savior, everything that we've been through 
 Bladee 
 She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants 
 I stay up till dawn, barbwire on my arm 
 They won't see me fall, they won't see me fall 
 I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar 
 Living in the dark, living in the dark 
 Leandoer the God, we've been going hard 
 Ever since she called, I don't have a heart 
 I went to the stars 
 What you want from me? I can get it for you 
 Get it for you 
 You don't want me, do you? 
 You don't want me, do you? 
 Know what I'll do to you
