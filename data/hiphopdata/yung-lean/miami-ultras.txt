I'm not looking for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not looking for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 Pop, pop, pop, drop this top, top, top 
 I roll like a rock, rock n roll to the top 
 I don't give a motherfuck, watchin' Star Wars smokin' pot 
 I take what I got, I live till it stops 
 Chop, chop chop, all my lungs stay rot 
 I take what I got, you hate that you're not 
 Like me and me I don't give a motherfuck 
 What I am, what I'm out, polo down to my socks 
 What person, they can't stop, I fly to the top 
 F-f-fuck what you got, I'm off a pill, rollin' like a rock 
 White diamonds countin' guap, I got marble on my watch 
 I got slam doors out the front, I'll keep goin' till I'm out 
 I got pockets like the plug, I'm movin' 'round all day 
 Fade to grey, everythin' can't stay 
 I smoke so much, went away 
 I'm in leanworld, l-l-let my mind stay 
 Whichever today, I love my brothers, we gon' slay 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth 
 You think you hate me, I know that it hurts 
 Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn 
 Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn 
 I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth 
 You think I hate you, I know that it hurts 
 I burned, burned, burned, my turn, turn, turns 
 Take a way and yearn, yearn, yearn 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not looking for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 Pop, pop, pop, drop this top, top, top 
 I roll like a rock, rock n roll to the top 
 I don't give a motherfuck, watchin' Star Wars smokin' pot 
 I take what I got, I live till it stops 
 Chop, chop chop, all my lungs stay rot 
 I take what I got, you hate that you're not 
 Like me and me I don't give a motherfuck 
 What I am, what I'm out, polo down to my socks 
 I'm not looking for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not looking for you 
 I'm not for you 
 I'm not for you
