Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 I been dropping out of helicopters 
 Hopping out of buses 
 Dropped like 20 on a pinky ring 
 My stacks sure got a muscles 
 And my words are like a skeleton 
 My keychain made in Brussels 
 I got diamonds on my telephone 
 You know that Lean done hustled 
 Neck filled with rose gold 
 It look like a logo 
 Hanging like the old folks 
 Icy like the north pole 
 Live my life in slow-mo 
 Happy when I'm solo 
 Sun hotter than Togo 
 My zone is a no go 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Skis on me, it's hot, drop the fucking top 
 Keychain on my Paris Hilton dog, I've seen a lot 
 Why not come with us, xannies in the Tuss 
 I feel like Johnny Depp like from the Blow 
 Sipping on the 40, my life is a late night show 
 I can't understand it when I'm low 
 (Drop it) 
 Bitches, they come after us 
 We used to lay on the bus 
 Hours and hours of dumbing 
 Ain't no more running I'm vicious for lust 
 Lean, lost in the woods, you know I can not speak 
 My boys blowing loud, eyes looking like peeks 
 Soldiers of another world, I'm falling into seas 
 Dark counters, white shadows leaning over me 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexing with my new girl 
 When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it 
 Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger 
 When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
