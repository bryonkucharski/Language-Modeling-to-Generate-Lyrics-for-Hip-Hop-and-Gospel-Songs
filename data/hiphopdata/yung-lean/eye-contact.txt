Pull up in that Veyron goin' skrt-skrt 
 Everyday shit fuck what you heard-heard 
 I'm so high that I'm flyin' like a bird-bird 
 All of that I know is that it's her-her 
 I, I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer 
 Draped in that Gucci scarf my phone going berserk 
 I don't do no eye contact my vision blurred-blurred 
 I'm a demon like a fur-fur, they think I'm absurd-surd 
 But when I enter the galaxy they are li-like word-word 
 I'm too fucked up, she said when I heard her 
 I don't have no feelings left, I don't wanna hurt her 
 I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer 
 Look into the sky and I see myself 
 I don't wanna fall down 
 I don't need your help 
 I just popped a pill I can't control myself 
 I'm in that forest and my life is like a fairy tale 
 Diamonds in my veins, I'm sipping ginger ale 
 Hate in my heart, getting guided by elves 
 I'm a lion in this shit everyone else is stale 
 Smoke still coming out my mouth when I exhale 
 Look into the sky and I see myself 
 I don't wanna fall down, I don't need you help 
 Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well 
 Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well
