Profound sadness! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Yung Lean 
 She's my tangerine shadow, you know I got the fame 
 Shorty I'm made by Bape, blazing up in the day 
 White powder on my Chinese plates 
 Sipping gatorade somewhere up in space 
 Posted up with Bladee, pills after pills 
 Hide it in my motherfucking 
 Hi-tech nikes, bitch I'm running with blades 
 So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days 
 Hi-tech nikes, bitch I'm running with blades 
 So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 I can heal you shorty in a million ways 
 So you know I'm blade runner, smoking haze for days 
 Bladee 
 Cut you like mango 
 My iPod is nano 
 Lasers are my ammo 
 I'm shooting at your camo 
 Nike on my sandals 
 My blunts look like candles 
 Got her in darkness 
 She start lighting candles 
 GTB and Sadboys 
 It's real tears I'm sad, boy 
 I think I can heal you 
 Just call me on my Android
