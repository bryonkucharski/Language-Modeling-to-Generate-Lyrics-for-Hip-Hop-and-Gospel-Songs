Take a pill and go to sleep 
 I'm chasing witches in the street 
 I'm the last page in your book 
 Can't write a song, only do hooks 
 Watching horses in the fields 
 The dragon rests in agony 
 When I'm afraid I lose my mind 
 It's fine, it happens all the time 
 When I'm afraid I lose my mind 
 It's fine, it happens all the time 
 Isolation caved in 
 I adore you, the sound of your skin 
 So many lies that I found 
 Blood, Heaven, I stick to the ground 
 So many times I realized 
 What I seek for is right in front of my eyes 
 I'm alone in a hole in the ground 
 A Theatre of Dogs is still around 
 My furniture has come alive 
 I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight 
 Flying kites reaping outside my window 
 Smiles with fright 
 Isolation caved in 
 I adore you, the sound of your skin 
 I adore you, the sound of your skin 
 I adore you, the sound of your skin
