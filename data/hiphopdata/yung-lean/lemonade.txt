I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs 
 Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures 
 (?) Stitches 
 Turn into the neatest riches 
 Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses 
 I'm balling, balling (?) 
 (?) My hand starts twitching, twitching 
 Y'all think I'm so weird, I ain't really human I'm revered 
 Couldn't give less fucks about my career 
 Posted in a spaceship showing no fear 
 No one heard about Lean a month ago, ago 
 I was in my bedroom making music, yo 
 I make no sense, I make nonsense 
 Should've played in the window from my Benz 
 Stunting all you haters, I jumped over the fence 
 Jumped over the chase, jumped up the top of her 
 With my AK-47 in the face 
 Take you back to heaven, it's a race 
 Counting stacks, smoking (?) 
 Bey Bey-blades (?) 
 I can buy you lemonade, I can buy you drugs 
 Arizona tears, Arizona tears 
 Arizona tears, Arizona tears 
 Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur 
 Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her 
 Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures 
 (?) Stitches 
 Turn into the neatest riches 
 Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses 
 I'm balling, balling (?) 
 (?) My hand starts twitching, twitching
