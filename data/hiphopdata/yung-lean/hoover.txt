Leeaaann 
 Fattest bag around, tell the law when I don't fuck with 
 The saddest firm around, turn to dogs if they barkin' on me 
 Bag filled with white life, let's throw it in the drawer, homie 
 Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me 
 Wake up with some liquor in me 
 Wake up and the world is empty 
 Wake up, bet my bag is empty 
 Wake up, take a trip to Paris 
 Two dead rats and I see a gallon 
 Got alotta shit in my bag like Santa 
 Bitches see me, hoes gettin' tantrum 
 Rockstar person, I'm like Marilyn Manson 
 Dirt on my face, bitches think I'm handsome 
 18, but my money likes expansion 
 Me and my boys, we just styled in Aspen 
 After breakfast, people call us madmen 
 I've always been this way and I call them hasbeens 
 Never gave a fuck it's like it never mattered 
 Accept the actions, forget the sad shit 
 Blowin' smoke in your face, became a dragon 
 Money in my right and my left hand 
 Ridin' on a horse with a dead man 
 Xans in my left hand
