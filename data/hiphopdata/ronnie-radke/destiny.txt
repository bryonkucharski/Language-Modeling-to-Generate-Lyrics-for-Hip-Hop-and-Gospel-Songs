My destiny was large from the day I picked up the mic it was written in the stars 
 The day that I was born my father knew when he held me in his arms 
 Looked into my eyes, I sang my first melody came out as a cry 
 30 years have past and for the very first time 
 I realize I pour my life into every single line 
 I write until I die and I've arrived in a place where I am fine 
 'Cause 27 years ago I learned how to survive 
 Why my fucking mother left and dad was always high 
 The powers never on the bill was never on time 
 But I somehow learned to shine 
 Through the darkest nights I found the will to stay alive 
 Now every time you see me you gotta look up to the sky 
 The story of a boy who showed the world that he can fly 
 And it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 But it's safe to say that I'm all alone 
 So here I go, here I am, without you, without them 
 But it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 I made it home, I made it home 
 I'm sorry dad I never meant to hurt you anyway 
 Watching me running from the police up on the free way 
 I bet you never thought I'd end up on the news 
 Headline ridicules murderer on lose 
 Dude, that's something I'd never do 
 The skewed view of the news leaving out the fucking truth 
 Of what actually happened God damn it, it was what I had to do 
 Defend a friend's honor but I refuse to lose so I choose abuse as a muse 
 Interrogation room but I refuse to spew any information too 
 I'm a mute and I will use my right to remain booed 
 I will never talk to red and blue to a jail cell I was to, oh 
 I had to eat their fucking soup 
 Look over my shoulder every time I eat my food 
 Praying for the day that they will let me out soon 
 'Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do 
 And it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 But it's safe to say that I'm all alone 
 So here I go, here I am, without you, without them 
 But it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 I made it home, I made it home 
 Climbed so many mountains in my life 
 I've come to realize if I fight 
 I've climbed so many mountains in my life 
 I've come to realize I will fight 
 This goes out to any kid that's listening and dwindling away from the world 
 Curled up in a ball and then distancing themselves 
 Because they feel like everyone's out to hurt them 
 I'm here to help with this burden 
 I am not perfect but I'm learning to be better 
 So if I can help a kid that's in a struggle that juggles 
 With his troubles to break out his fucking bubble 
 Remove the fucking muzzle hustle out of the rubble 
 Put the pieces back to the puzzle even if it's subtle I'm humbled 
 I'm not as bad as you think I'm begging and pleading for you to believe me it stinks 
 That everyone around me thinks that I'm a fucking machine without a heart beat 
 But contrary to popular belief I've got a heart in this chest 
 And all I want is the best for everybody but it's hard when I obsess over stress 
 Anxiety stricken flashing visions of prison that I suppress 
 My hands start shaking over my quickness of breath 
 Cold sweat no regrets though it's time to fucking let go 
 Of all the pain I've harbored I am better I will revel 
 In the thought of leaving put my peddle to the metal 
 People I will let know sold my soul back from the devil 
 I will no longer eat your soup or look over my shoulder every time I eat my food 
 'Cause today is the day you will let me go too 
 'Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do 
 And it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 But it's safe to say that I'm all alone 
 So here I go, here I am, without you, without them 
 But it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 And it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 But it's safe to say that I'm all alone 
 So here I go, here I am, without you, without them 
 But it's nice to know that I've made it home 
 I made it home, I made it home 
 I made it home
