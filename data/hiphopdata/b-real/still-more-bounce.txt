 (Voice Vocoder) 
 Rest in peace, Roger 
 Bounce, more bounce, more bounce (We live this shit} 
 Bounce, more bounce, more bounce (W-we live this shit) 
 Bounce, more bounce, more bounce (W-we live this shit) 
 Bounce, more bounce, more bounce (W-w-w-we live this shit) 
 Bounce, more bounce 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Yeah yeah, more bounce to the ounce, so keep fuck a ounce, nigga 
 It's Still More Bounce to the ounce, keep fuck a ounce, heh 
 Still More Bounce, we wanna keep fuck a ounce tho 
 Yeah, Battlecat, nigga Dirty Ray listen 
 I'm like Terminator 2 askin where Sarah Connor is 
 Two side bustas kick rocks like narcotics anonymous 
 Ever since the top (ever since the top) 
 I remember dudes in Karate shoes Pop Lockin to Roger 
 Now it's 2000, a new world order 
 The birth of G-Funk, Roger created the vocoder 
 So haters slide to the side, let the riders ride 
 (Singin') Ooh ooh ooh, now I own mine (muthafucka) 
 (B-Real) 
 It's the track slayer, on your CD player 
 The Budda King, blunt smokin' the weed wayer 
 Ridin' from the EastSide of LA, who what? 
 You holdin' my nuts, like a hice cup runnin' up 
 Keep yo mouth shut 'cause you talk too much 
 You can't fold, what the hell, you need the glocks too much (bitch!) 
 Rather the way bitches betta get heavy 
 When I hit the corner all you see is the light from the Chevy 
 (Dirty Ray) 
 Chevy, yo, zzp-zzp! 
 Now can I bang bang? (bang bang) picture Roger and Zapp 
 A dominatrac cat, on Purple Haze and Conynac 
 Dirty Ray, fo fo fo microphones 
 Wolfpac shakin ya Time Zone and fadin ya home 
 (Gimme a dome) - Twenty inches hit the scene 
 Smoke screen, open the do, big gold chain gleam 
 We get low down and dirty fo that Triban Family 
 2002, Roger R-I-P, come on 
 (Spice 1: Hook) 
 We pop these collars, what we bout 
 Lets have all y'all falla, what we bout 
 Smoke up ya whole ounce, then we bounce

 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Ah hah)

 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Come on) 
 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Uh) 
 (Kam) 
 Uh check, uh uh uh 
 Watch out sucker, matter of fact duck (fuck fuck fuck) 
 Out the window of my Cadillac Truck, and what's up? 
 We rollin' paper plates, homies movin crates of tapes 
 While y'all wearin captains savin' no crapes on daytons 
 I am one of the greats, know you might be hurt 
 Baby ain't nobody retire'n in my White T-Shirt 
 As long as fools still feel, and trust I'm real 
 Ima keep bustin' big rhymes dimes nuts and steel 
 (I ain't that type of brother that Cs can walk wit) 
 Man I ain't politically correct, Ima talk shit 
 About these mucic industry characters, 'cause there ain't no debate'n 
 These record company people be hatin', females be degratin their selves 
 Thinkin' the desk gon last 
 That's why I'm quick to put these chickens on blast 
 Tryna tell me "I'm so and so, I'm this, I'm that" 
 But they all jus wick-weak-wacks 
 (Vocoder Solo) 
 (Tash) 
 Say what? uh say what? uh yo uh 
 If this was '87 when bangin' was at its peak 
 This song woulda had 'em closin clubs every week 
 'Cause we speak the really real, speak how we really feel 
 Come work for me have ya niggas stealin wheels 
 Daytons, BGs, what ever rims housin 
 I need sum 19s fo my Benz 2000 
 Work wit me homeboy, it's all luv 
 I told you 19s, you came back wit dubs 
 When push come to shove, Tash knocks 'em out the box 
 You might hear me at a club or on a boom-box in Watts 
 Jus swangin, raps over beats that hump 
 That's why a nigga like CaTash get it crunk from jump 
 I Slam-Dunk the funk like a Alley-Loop to Shaq 
 Y'all fools so wack ya prolly can't rap to Zapp 
 So slap yo'self, this is Wolfpac Records 
 Rest In Peace Roger, your music was respected 
 (Spice 1 x2: Hook)

 Smoke up ya whole ounce, then we bounce 
 Roger Zapp Battlecat, this is Still More Bounce 
 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Ah hah) 
 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Yeah yeah) 
 Jus bounce to this, jus bounce (Come on)
