{*20 seconds of kids playing*} 
 (Intro: sped-up R&B sample) 
 Late at night 
 When all the world is safe within their dreams 
 I want the shadowwwww 
 Late at night 
 An empty feeling creeps within my soul 
 I feel so lonely 
 So I go, into the darkness of the night, all alone 
 I want this peace until I find, someone who is just like me 
 Looking for some company 
 Oh yeah 
 (B-Real) 
 What's good in the hood, can you tell me 
 Hit me with the truth motherfuckers don't sell me 
 'Cause I can see a lot of things wrong with the city 
 And nobody's tryin' to fix nothin', all of our choices are shitty 
 People starvin in the ghetto and the rich get richer 
 So we hustlin for the paper - you get the picture? 
 My homey he caught ten tryin' to feed his seed 
 And nothin' supersedes a man's will to succeed 
 So we bleed and shed tears, lookin' for somethin' better 
 But nothin' is guaranteed, in this life we livin' 
 Ain't nothin' given, gotta earn your money and stripes 
 I can't sleep at night, what I'm doin' ain't right 
 Can't never let my guard down for nothin' in life 
 Your enemies see a weakness and you look ripe 
 And they don't care about who or what you're leavin' behind 
 You slip one time you a victim of crime 
 (Chorus: Bo Roc) 
 Up against the trials of life, sometimes it ain't right 
 Through all of my pain and strife, I focused upon the light 
 Though I may lose my way, I'm up for the fight 
 In hopes of a brighter day for children of the night 
 (B-Real) 
 You know I hit the ground runnin' from the day I was born 
 There ain't nothin' I haven't seen, I was born to storm 
 And if I ever have to heat it up you might get warm 
 So I urge you to sit it out, and just let me move on 
 Out of pride you won't blink, think that I'm a threat 
 Yeah you might be right, and if you are comes death 
 By the laws of the street you know what's comin' up next 
 You duckin from the glocks and the six and tecs 
 When did it all fall? We all used to cash collect 
 Instead of catchin a body homey cash a check 
 Any moment it could be over, your number's up 
 You become, a memory nobody's givin' a fuck 
 It's no wonder how we cross roads and get divided 
 There's no, compromises and drama arises 
 The streets got you clutched in the cradle of doom 
 You get out of pocket they make you invisible dude 
 (B-Real) 
 The streets are ugly and the world is goin' through changes 
 We fightin at home and out here in unknown places 
 We never know what peace is 
 We all about war for the money and the violence increases 
 I never thought about it when I was younger 
 I never thought about we all just numbers 
 I only thought about the food on the table 
 I was taught to make moves when you're ready and able 
 Sometimes you feel alone and you just simply go for self 
 And you don't care about anybody else 
 You say "Look at that trick in the flashy whip! 
 If I get my chance, you know I'm gonna jack his shit" 
 The world's cold, people sell their soul 
 For money and power then they seem to lose control 
 They can't, handle the load at the end of the road 
 They're destined to fall and we just watch the drama unfold
