Niggaz run up on ya when you live in California 
 In the home of marijuana, streets get hotter than a sauna 
 Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh 
 They run up on the side of your ride and then blast 
 When it pops off it happens that fast 
 If you soft you just won't last 
 I was born in Los Angeles city 
 Where the thugs ride low, get dough and the girls are pretty 
 It's hostile and gritty, outsiders see the beauty 
 Sun shines but sometimes it's dark and moody 
 Whatever you do to me you won't stop my grind 
 Son, when you find one you hold on and shine 
 Don't lay back, relax 'cause the minute you laid back 
 Someone takes away from your stacks 
 Nowadays it's a struggle to hustle 
 Not only in the street, the rap games and the fucked up shuffles 
 So I came with the rain to boost it back 
 Real life is a struggle but we used to that 
 No matter who you are or who you be with 
 We all want the same thangs, we all in the same gang 
 Same dope, same notes we flow for 
 Same dreams and schemes we investin' our soul for 
 Niggaz run up on ya when you live in California 
 In the home of marijuana, streets get hotter than a sauna 
 Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh 
 They run up on the side of your ride and then blast 
 When it pops off it happens that fast 
 If you soft you just won't last 
 I'm livin' that Cali life in the hundred degree heat 
 And you wonder why they found another body in the streets 
 No AC packed in a car eight deep 
 They go kamikaze, no camraderie or peace 
 And beef, homey ain't just somethin' you eat 
 But the taste of revenge is oh so sweet 
 Your boy won't sleep till I'm up in that Benz 
 E-class, heat blast leave 'em in a trench 
 And take me off the bench, I'm ready for the game 
 Your business fucked up they got you signin' for a chain 
 They callin' for a change, they callin' out my name 
 Young De, they want me to come and do my thang 
 Plain black tee, I ain't do it for the fame 
 Same black glock if you move into my lane 
 Same old blocks is the spots where I hang 
 On the stoop with the vets but your boy ain't changed 
 Niggaz run up on ya when you live in California 
 In the home of marijuana, streets get hotter than a sauna 
 Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh 
 They run up on the side of your ride and then blast 
 When it pops off it happens that fast 
 If you soft you just won't last 
 Top hat smashin' in a California fashion 
 Even the strong get chin checked tested and blasted 
 Wrapped in plastic, dumped out for weak reasons 
 I beach cruise, black T-shirts for each season 
 Come here flossin' ya knots, you're not leavin' with that 
 Now where my motherfuckin' gangsters at? 
 More single mothers than brothers than we got on the street 
 Better have you a handle whenever you keepin' the peace 
 Still 'Fuck Tha Police' at least the coast stay consistent 
 Fame is lame but life is lost in an instant 
 Hit the fence then sprint through the neighbor's yard 
 Canine is on your ass, if they catch you then you're gone 
 This is for the soldiers that's never comin' home 
 Who been crackin' for the cause candy-painted to the chrome 
 Hikin' up Cypress Hill with two bongs 
 B-Real got a pound then it's on, we smokin' 
 Niggaz run up on ya when you live in California 
 In the home of marijuana, streets get hotter than a sauna 
 Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh 
 They run up on the side of your ride and then blast 
 When it pops off it happens that fast 
 If you soft you just won't last
