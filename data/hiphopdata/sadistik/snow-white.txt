Yeah I sit beneath a plaster moon 
 Puff puff pass the gloom and watch the ashes bloom 
 Black balloons float above me singing saddest tunes 
 Like no one loves me but that can't be true 
 I never show my ugly attributes, I'd rather choose 
 To expose my sunny plastic moods, so after you 
 I know that crummy sulken frumpy, oh-so-grumpy attitude 
 Over something nobody can have but you 
 You're such a mess 
 And plus your nose is bloody 
 Does anybody ever really want to know why I 
 Always leave the party when we say bye-bye 
 With a cyanide taste and a mai tai chase 
 And another trail of blood when the pipeline breaks 
 And she's always got to listen to the rhythm of the wicked 
 When I give her my attention try to fix it but the fix is 
 Just a little bigger litter better little more to benefit 
 An addict when I can't afford the habit that you chose 
 Yeah you wait in line to take a line 
 A powdered nose and some make-up might erase the strife 
 So take your time wait until you taste the sky 
 To take your flight cloudy headed let it fade to white 
 I'd wake up night after night after night 
 While you'd take another line after line after line 
 Little little lovable drift into this puff of smoke 
 Something so innocent is getting into such a hole 
 Yeah you huff and blow to huff some blow 
 Lovely Snow White why'd I find your touch so cold 
 You look so comfortable but pretty with your bloody nose 
 And you're still thinking that nobody knows 
 You're such a mess 
 Sleep back to back in the shape of a butterfly 
 Another sign that it's time to tell my lover bye
