(Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 I used to live in static in a dream a cinematic liturgy 
 Acidic habits that I had were mixed and matched with gritted teeth 
 See, she's so enigmatic isn't she 
 I sit and sat esteemed of how her lips could match a guillotine 
 I feel the sting of her pitter-patter little feet 
 Dancing on my ribcage kicking patterns to the beat 
 Beat beat beating on my chest 
 When I'm sleeping like a baby and you're stealing all my breaths 
 Kiss me twice I'll do the rest 
 As the city lights dimming right on cue again 
 Such a pretty sight is it why you've haunted my skin 
 With your ruby red lipstick aren't you a gem 
 Yes diamond cutter eyes like a shutter blind 
 Fly like butterflies by my stomach 
 Hi I'm another guy to fall in love with 
 And they say sky's the limit 
 We can burn up in the atmosphere while we try to get it like 
 (Hook: Child Actor) 
 Like you love me 
 Don't go 
 You're coming with me 
 My baby 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 My head hangs heavy when we exchange heavy blows 
 Chest pains spreading with her red fangs setting slow 
 I feel the checkmate getting close 
 Here's the methane we can let blaze ready go 
 My room was in my room was in my room was in hell 
 Till I met up with my queen she was raised out in Brooklyn 
 I'm amazed by the way that she changed 
 All the rays from the sun to the flames in her footprints 
 Sky is a violet grey, lights in a diamond shape 
 Bright when I'm wide awake, I am a mile away 
 Eyes are a vibrant jade, cry in a tidal wave 
 Sides like a spider's legs, try to still hide her face 
 So if home is where the heart is 
 You can find me sleeping in between her bones or in her cartilage 
 And I can break your heart in two 
 And use the jagged edge that's left to go and take apart the gloom 
 For my palmreader
