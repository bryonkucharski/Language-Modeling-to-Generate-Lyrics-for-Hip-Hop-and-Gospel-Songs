First daddy died then Mikey died 
 Why am I so dead inside? 
 Maggots fill this head of mine 
 My tongue's fly-paper to catch the flies 
 I spit 'em out towards a wretched sky 
 Water tastes like insecticide 
 Watch it take out my sense of pride 
 It's a genocide of my gentle side 
 They so surgical with their masks 
 So I murder all in my path 
 No merciful in my wrath 
 I am a monster I can never be altered 
 Burning the altars 
 Watch 'em all perch with the vultures 
 Eating away 
 One day they'll all turn into sulfur 
 Dead in the head I was born like this, born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this 
 When they burned the bodies I smelled the smoke 
 From the hell below 
 Where they turned to zombies to sell their souls 
 To the highest bidder I'm high and bitter 
 In this crypt of mine no kryptonite 
 Just cryptic minds 
 Crimson-like when I draw the lines 
 A foggy life leaves me mystified 
 In this dream of mine full of Dramamine 
 Where I wanna sing but my screams are quiet 
 And my screams requite 
 Demons acquired 
 Deeming the choir all charlatans 
 Harlots in my audience 
 Watch the harlequins all get sawed to bits 
 Deadliness is next to godliness right? 
 Dead in the head I was born like this, born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this 
 Winter in hell when the wind turns to hail 
 Hailed when they win then wince when they fail 
 The wind in the sails all went to the sales 
 I'm assailing against them scaling the fence with 
 Nails in the wrists I'm impaled from the sales that they pitch 
 Which pales in comparison 
 Sinking again in the stale and the kitsch 
 Been drinking a fifth watching Tales From the Crypt 
 Yeah I lift the bar 
 Never star-struck when I hit the stars 
 Never start something I can't complete 
 These heavy hearts hung in a gallery 
 These gallows swing these gallows swing 
 They feed us shit like a Salo scene 
 These gallows swing these gallows swing 
 Sparrows sing like they're caroling my god 
 They're as spooky as ever 
 More than you could imagine 
 Beautiful black bruises intact 
 Tactile abuse induce ipecac 
 A funeral mass I won't attend 
 I choose to be absent I don't pretend 
 And I don't believe in ghosts 
 But you could be that, yeah, yeah you could be that 
 Spectres ghosts of themselves 
 But they chose it themselves 
 Made a home for the hell 
 Keep my eyes low when I know they're around 
 Spectres ghosts of themselves 
 But they chose it themselves 
 Made a home for the hell 
 Keep my eyes low when I know they're around 
 Spectres ghosts of themselves 
 But they chose it themselves 
 Made a home for the hell 
 Keep my eyes low when I know they're around 
 Spectres ghosts of themselves 
 But they chose it themselves 
 Made a home for the hell 
 Keep my eyes low when I know 
 (Dead in the head I was born like this, born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this 
 Dead in the head I was born like this) 
 Gho gho gho Ghosts all around me 
 Go go go go away 
 Gho gho gho Ghosts all around me 
 Go go go go away 
 Gho gho gho Ghosts all around me 
 Go go go go away
