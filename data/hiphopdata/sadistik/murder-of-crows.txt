(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 It's beautiful when the sky is made of blue 
 And my eyes follow suit as I try to paint the hue 
 I embrace the view, with arms wide open 
 A heart I've broken and a mind that's full of gloom 
 'Cause every single love is a piece I have to carry 
 On a back that feels broken in a sleepless January 
 Even when the seasons change into freezing rain 
 I won't be afraid, 'cause I'm leaving Canterbury 
 I walk a path that's been painted with the frozen rain 
 Whispers in the wind are still praying that it snows again 
 And even them I'm still chasing an emotion when 
 I'm searching for some beautiful but saying that it's so content 
 The ghosts pretend and they tell me that I'm different 
 Tell me I'm perfect, they tell me I'm significant 
 They tell me every single lie they conjure and barter 
 Because I am a monster 
 And everyone that I've ever loved is dead 
 They disappeared, and found a better one instead 
 And even though that December sun has set 
 I still read her lips, and I remember what it said 
 "You're not alone Cody, you're not alone 
 Just stay by my side and you'll what grace provides" 
 I start to relish, she's archangellic 
 And when she tells it, I can see its safe to fly 
 Into the wind with a murder of crows 
 So I can leave where I've been with the circle of vul-tures 
 To ascend with my personal goals 
 And I can sing to the dead till the surface unfolds... first 
 I'll sit and listen to the symphony 
 Mix it with my misery and kiss it till my lips will bleed 
 This is me, Mr. bare-boned winter 
 Who's been chasing footsteps where the scarecrows whisper 
 In a ear discreetly, still and calm with 
 Philharmonics, spoken crystal clear to teach me 
 And when the pistoleers defeat me 
 I'll just evanesce till I disappear completely 
 This is just a Monday night puppy love letter 
 To a cherub that's apparent when the things become better 
 If it's an angel with a subtle recoil 
 Then I can probably find an rainbow in a puddle of oil 
 When I surrender... 
 I watch the stars that illuminate the sky 
 Till I remunerate what the lunar state provides 
 And even when all that beauty-scape has died 
 I choose to wait until the weight accumulates inside 
 And soothes the aches... This is life beneath the monolith 
 Where I can seek a guide to see that I can reach the bottom with 
 The clocks will switch when the idle pieces ball to fists 
 'Cause all of this is just a wish that I could meet the dawn again (x3) 
 (At night I close my eyes) 
 And I pray for the sunset, wishing you were here so the day wasn't done yet 
 (At night I close my eyes) 
 When the light glares in, I'll just dream about you till the nightmares end (x2) 
 (Verse 2 - Louise Fraser) 
 I never meant to release you, I never made out alive 
 I never meant just to tease you, I never meant you to cry 
 I never meant you to cry, I never meant you to cry 
 At night I close my eyes, to be with you 
 At night I close my eyes, just to see you again 
 At night I close my eyes, to be with you 
 At night I close my eyes, just to see you again 
 I'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue 
 At night I close my eyes 
 I'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue 
 At night I close my eyes...
