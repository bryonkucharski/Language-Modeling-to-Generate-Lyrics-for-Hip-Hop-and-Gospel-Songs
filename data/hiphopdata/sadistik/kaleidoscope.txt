So much to say don't know where to start 
 I bared my heart to the bears 
 Then buried it in the barracks 
 In the most barren part I could bare 
 I'm Baron Blood Lone Wolf and Cub 
 Barely inspired by swollen cuts 
 They'll soak it up I'll sulk in ruts 
 This attitude just won't adjust 
 We go for broke 'cause we're broken 
 Light hurt my eyes so I sewed 'em shut 
 Pearl inside but won't open up 
 Turpentine in that ocean front 
 Let's burn alive till the smoke erupts 
 Turn the skies into poems 
 Once I paint my paper thin vacant skin 
 And get estranged again 
 How strange it is how strangers live 
 Their wrists injected with save-me-quicks 
 I risked my neck then they strangled it 
 Irises left in my tangled limbs 
 Mangled by my state of mind 
 Dangled by widow's spiderwebs 
 Anchors tied to my ankle sides 
 Halos lie where those liars slept 
 Let's walk to where all the Angels hide 
 Kill a cherub, call it angelcide 
 Why sell him a fate, of a lake of fire 
 I'll self-immolate those flames are mine 
 They take a tithe we pay the price 
 Want my advice? Don't take advice 
 Save us from our saviors 
 When they sanctify the same they curse 
 They say we're born alone we'll die alone 
 I say it's worth it for tonight alone 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm kaleidoscope 
 Alkalines collide inside I feel like I'm kaleidoscope 
 They say we're born alone we'll die alone 
 I say it's worth it for tonight alone 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm kaleidoscope 
 Alkalines collide inside I feel like I'm kaleidoscope
