(Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 Just because I'm absent minded doesn't mean I have to find it 
 It's my pity-party darling please don't act invited 
 I sip Bacardi just to pass the time when 
 It gets me started for the clash of titans just past my eyelids 
 I'm not a downer in the kill the party market 
 But I swallowed all my pride and yet I'm still a starving artist 
 And still I'm finding parts of all my silly life departures 
 Parts of darkness are so thrilling but it's filling my apartment 
 So please for forgive me if I overstep my boundaries 
 I keep forgetting that there's no one left to count on me 
 At least I'm living on my own and get a founder's fee 
 I'm out to see and drifting off that melatonin sound asleep 
 Wait up all alone just to dream away the time 
 Weight upon my collarbones don't seem to pay no mind 
 The day the world died I didn't even say goodbye 
 I left a love letter in a secret place to hide that said 
 I'd give concern but I'm a disconcerted immature kid 
 Insecure when I am quickly searching for a bridge to burn it 
 If I twist and turn until the blisters hurt it isn't worth it 
 If it's served with sense of urgency to see me binge and purge it 
 I've lived and learned and learned to live to misinterpret nervous twitches 
 Pistons turning hurt to bliss it's picture perfect 
 And since I've learned a circus trick of inadvertent perfect-pitch 
 To skim a surface worse than this I'm in to get deserted, when I ask 
 (Poem: Czeslaw Milosz) 
 On the day the world ends 
 A bee circles a clover 
 A fisherman mends a glimmering net 
 By the rainspout young sparrows are playing 
 And the snake is gold-skinned as it should always be 
 On the day the world ends 
 Women walk through the fields under their umbrellas 
 A drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn 
 Vegetable peddlers shout in the street 
 And a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island 
 The voice of a violin lasts in the air 
 And leads into a starry night 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 I get less comfortable with each breath stomach full of regrets 
 Each step's becoming part of running as a reflex 
 Pretend tell me something that relives stress 
 Sleepless I'd rather suffocate my weakness 
 I'm David Cronenberg mixed with David Lynch stir 
 David Berkowitz and a little David Fincher 
 They say I mince words that can paint a picture 
 Honest and true yes long live the new flesh 
 And I'm impatiently waiting to find a day that needs saving 
 I say the things that can make me seem crazy 
 I chase my dreams like I chase my drinks daily 
 I fall asleep to my existential woes 
 And the questions with the answers that'll never get exposed 
 I'm not too good with the mental episodes 
 But about as sharp as it can get with pen or pencils though 
 Evidence is shown in the sentimental prose 
 Posing pros and cons to poking on this detrimental road 
 I chose to walk walk walk on sediment and stone 
 Don't confuse my temperament as being reticent or cold 
 Just let me vent 
 (Poem outro: Czeslaw Milosz) 
 And those who expected lightning and thunder 
 Are disappointed 
 And those who expected signs and archangels' trumps 
 Do not believe it is happening now 
 As long as the sun and the moon are above 
 As long as the bumblebee visits a rose 
 As long as rosy infants are born 
 No one believes it is happening now
