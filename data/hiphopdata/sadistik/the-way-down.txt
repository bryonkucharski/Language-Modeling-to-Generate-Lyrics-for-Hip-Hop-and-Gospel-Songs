God kills the best of us 
 And leaves the rest to bury them 
 This heart of darkness is charcoal art 
 Carcas carving marble for seraphims 
 My chest is pounding like an 808 
 I get so cloudy I could fade to grey 
 Aleister Crowley with the razor blades 
 Spray flames at fakes until they fade away, aye 
 Any minute ima immolate 'em 
 My inner state stays in decay 
 Their shit is played out, my skin is splayed 
 24 ribs sit displayed 
 In a trophy case now 
 Scripted hit-lists in lowercase 
 With a Pokerface out 
 I'll show 'em the way down 
 I got money so I don't do much 
 You niggas be talking' too much 
 I go toe-to-toe with myself in a rut 
 I'm a nut give a fuck mama told me what's up 
 These niggas don't love us they out for the stunt 
 If there's funk tell them niggas to meet me out front 
 For some fame there's a whole lot of dick they'll suck 
 We do nothing but plot and do us 
 Me and some ghosts in a truck 
 We lurking for sinners who don't know the word of the one 
 I'm a son of a gun that'll bust if I'm touched 
 We get ugly and handle our stuff 
 Type of fight is you down to put up? 
 If there's beef call the cops if you ain't gone pull up 
 When it's all about drama be willing to jump 
 If there's problems then solve them be willing to dump
