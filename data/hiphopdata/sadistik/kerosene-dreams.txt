We place ourselves on pedestals 
 She loves me not my petals stole 
 A head so full of ghosts that if I open it I'll let 'em go 
 Seppuku left 'em so the exit wound's impeccable 
 Get so Heavy headed, heaven knows this is my hecatomb 
 Devil boy l second guess my efforts till the echoes roam tremolo 
 My temper trembles slow temperatures are ten below 
 Tentacles attach to temples for mementos 
 Sipping soma melanomas slowly growing on my mental 
 Defend my territory kill 'em like a teratoma 
 Murder like its Terror Firmer Troma 
 Combing through this Terra Firma 
 Tear through derma circa circumventing 
 Persons of a certain setting 
 I'm acerbic like a serpent I'm a servent 
 Come behead me 
 Any minute ima murder my reflection 
 If looks could kill I'd burn the ones who turned in My direction 
 Don't try me I'm a daily chore 
 Dying for the sake of war 
 Maybe I'm just paranoid but I see 1984 
 Inside my mind let's take a tour 
 A thousand miles away from shore 
 All my words are made of oars 
 Metal in my veins they're made of ore 
 Or I'm a bore I'm so ugly I'm abhorrent 
 I'm aborted boars chewing on my corpse 
 Yo I'm rigged with rigor mortis stored in a morgue of the tortured 
 Immortalized my scorn born on a scorched earth 
 Torrential downpours pouring on our pores 
 I'm porcelain 
 Somebody should have hung me in that orchard 
 Kerosene dreams on the things that I've seen 
 Tear off my wings then they tariff my screams 
 Careless all weak they don't care if we bleed 
 Kerosene dreams please bury me deep
