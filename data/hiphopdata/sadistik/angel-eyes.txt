(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 Try to find a place in lines that I embrace 
 While I strive to find a balance between a time and space 
 In a microphone... When I'm soundin intense 
 I feel like 'Pac on his hospital bed, countin' his breaths 
 And they still say, Ill never blow on the mic 
 Unless I spit a gimmick with some clever jokes 'cause I'm white 
 I'm forced to listen to critics just chatter they teeth 
 With all their bullshit opinions like it matters to me 
 And my closest friends stumble as they mumble and doubt me 
 While I try to hold the world as it crumbles around me 
 Feel my lungs close, strain harder for breaths 
 As the broken dreams I have match the heart in my chest 
 And the pressure builds... But without a release 
 I know that ya hope floats, but its out of my reach 
 I'm tired of the masks that we wear (if only) 
 You saw my true self you'd be scared (to know me) 
 But now I finally see what I love is worthless 
 Beautys skin deep, but its just a surface 
 My shoulders are breaking and my focus is hazy 
 Plus my teeth are chipped from biting all the bullets that you gave me 
 In the form of lies, and I mistook it as honest 
 Took the good with the losses, till the good was just lost, its 
 Hard to hold the burdens until my shoulders bleed 
 I was forced to flee, until I learned to fly with broken wings 
 Across the visions of feelins and all this violent livin' 
 Of a fucked up system insistin that I should try to fit in 
 But now I can see I'm unrelated to you 
 'Cause I took off the mask that suffocated the truth 
 (If Life) could even worsen, (Then Id) release my burden 
 (And try) to be the person, (Who writes) and speaks in perfect 
 (Advice) for people hurtin', (Who cries) and fiends for nursing 
 (And time) would be asserted, (To find) a decent purpose 
 (But I) am weak and burdened, (I cry) and seek alertness 
 (In life) to be the person, (Whos lines) are seen as perfect 
 (I try) and seem so worthless, (That life) has demons lurkin 
 (That I) defeat the purpose, (And Life) is seen as worthless 
 Watch everyday just pass me by 
 Slowly corroding and acting fine 
 Suffocating on this mask of mine 
 Till I run out of breath and I can't survive (x2) 
 Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth 
 Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth 
 Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth 
 Through my angel eyes I see... (x2) 
 I need to get a piece of inhibition (First!) 
 And speak another piece of bitter vision (Words!) 
 And get a better syndicate of vindicated few 
 And I better never let another mitigate the truth 
 'Cause I'm the better, never get a flow with flaw 
 Better with the letters, veteran know it all 
 Talk a lot in a song, better hold 'em off 
 I thought I was lost, never fold or fall 
 If I could ever get a minute trying to be 
 My life independent when I'm dying in peace 
 I might get a sentiment I write to a beat 
 My mind of a veteran, trying to see 
 That lifes beautiful, suitable to let go 
 Of anything and Ill just survive through it all 
 Inner lines intertwined, my mind is livin' life 
 Grippin mics, livin' life in trife its live and die
