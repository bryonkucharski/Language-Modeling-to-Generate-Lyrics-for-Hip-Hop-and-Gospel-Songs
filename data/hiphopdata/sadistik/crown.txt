My heart is bursting 
 My head is a hole now 
 The lines are twisting 
 And I want more 
 How'd I get so narcissistic? 
 Everything feels artificial 
 All my skin's turned inside out 
 Fishing hook all in my mouth 
 Wishing well stalling my doubts 
 Apparitions haunting my house 
 Wendigo's don't know when to go 
 And no heaven knows if I'll sink 
 Inside the reaches of Kingdom Come 
 Blind preacher told me that Jesus loves 
 My teachers made me grind teeth to dust 
 I think, that I I think too much 
 If I think too much then I can't sleep 
 If I sleep too much then I can't smoke 
 If I smoke too much then I can't dream 
 Then I can't see my father 
 He said don't you see that you're my boy 
 Afloat at sea on a search for buoys 
 In drowning pools, sounds are mute 
 Sirens sing surrounding you 
 No time for Kings, no fountained youth 
 Those minor keys I found in you 
 Grew out of tune, too out of view 
 Unatoned, don't sound attuned 
 I'm so out of it, they so counterfeit 
 I can't even count the fits 
 Leeches adorn my outer rim 
 Made a ring of thorns, no crown would fit 
 I don't wear it out, It'll wear it out 
 It's whereabouts clandestine, guess it's paramount 
 Heavy is the head that bears the crown 
 My heart is bursting 
 My head is a hole now 
 The lines are twisting 
 And I want more 
 My heart is bursting 
 My head is a hole now 
 The lines are twisting 
 And I want more 
 How'd I get so narcissistic 
 Everything feels artificial 
 All my skins reptilian 
 Left in rough dominions 
 I bet my blood's vermilion 
 Dead head above 4 living limbs 
 I'm villainous, obsidian 
 I'll burn a bridge then build again 
 I wish, these wishing wells 
 Were filled with those who wished me well 
 I mix my woes with whiskey well 
 Well whiskey whisks me whimsically 
 I disagree with the parrot crowd 
 Spinning carbons on carousels 
 Skinny, living like caracals 
 Heavy is the head that bears the crown
