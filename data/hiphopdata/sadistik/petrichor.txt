Sadistik: 
 Talk about their neighborhoods intersects and boroughs 
 But I love instead in my head William S. Burroughs in my hands 
 I burrow with my hands on a burrow in the sand 
 Till it's purple and collapsed from the digging 
 Searching for a path to the virtue that I had 
 Surfaces will crack from the circles that I've ran in the city 
 City of the Living Dead wishing they could live again 
 Rip me into little shreds I'm filthy 
 Admitting all my differences drifting into bitterness 
 Kiss me till I'm innocent and kill me really 
 I feel rosy two pockets full of poesy 
 I'm nosy that's too obvious for Cody 
 Too cautious just to hold me like the cigarette I lit 
 Just to get another hit when new monsters can control me 
 And it's an arcane parlay but hearts aren't really heart shaped are they 
 I don't really know why but today is different from the last 
 I don't want to waste no time in wishing it would last 
 I can feel it in my skin hidden in my laugh 
 That this moment doesn't seem like a symptom of the past 
 I'm alive skipping by a land mine softly 
 Ship is gonna capsize probably it's okay 
 I'll make my own way that's my hobby 
 I don't want to be a sad eyed zombie with no brain 
 And that means that I'd pay-pay no mind of grate-grateful times 
 As days-days go by and leave 
 Rather lead a grace-graceful life and say-say no lies 
 And take-take both sides of me 
 I've fallen into more pieces than are countable 
 But put 'em back in a sequence that amounts 
 I'm finding for an out that can set me free from writer's block 
 I keep forgetting to remember everything that I forgot 
 Yeah and they say when it rains it pours 
 I'll splash in puddles when I know I can't evade the storm 
 I'll burn another bridge just to make it warm 
 Then I'll throw myself inside, watch me burn myself alive 
 This is a witches hunt zip it up lips are shut 
 If I run quick enough then I'll come into some 
 Symptoms of innocence when it's crushed into dust 
 If I wasn't in love with it just give it up 
 I'm feeling cold and under pressure 
 And hide my nervousness with silence 
 But when a coal is under pressure 
 That's when it turns into a diamond 
 I've been in front of the line of fire to hold still 
 Watching all the people that try to bite through my stone will 
 Don't cross the bear with your beef or a cross to bear 
 You either take the higher road or be the road kill 
 (Talking: Sadistik) 
 On September the first 2007, I learned what it's like to feel the world collapse beneath me 
 To free fall for so long that you forget what the ground ever felt like in the first place 
 And the only thought you do have, is that when you finally land you hope it's hard enough that no piece of you will be discovered again 
 You see... 
 I watched my hero die that day my friends 
 And so far I have survived every day since 
 I have no choice but forward while being gnawed on by the birds of prey 
 Praying that I never have to take another step in the same direction 
 I am the deliverer of ashes 
 A cultivator of roses in my fathers name 
 And while I missed the pieces of myself that has been killed by my own hands 
 I celebrate the ones that I have created since 
 I have reinvented myself more times than I care to count and each one is a little less beautiful than the last which leads me to here, the now 
 The culmination of every moment of my life and I want nothing more than to tear every piece of my flesh off one by one to show you what's been hiding underneath 
 Because these are the flowers for my father
