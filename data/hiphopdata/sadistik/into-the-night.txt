Cracked ribs from the hugs that you gave me 
 A sad grin from the love that you'd take 
 The mask fits so snug and so safely 
 When I can't live with the sum of mistakes 
 Somehow, you turn silence to symphonies 
 Violence to riveting and moments to years 
 Or so it appears, when the lights of the city gleam 
 I can do anything 
 Noah's Ark, save me from open-heart mania 
 Going dark slowly like Joan of Arcadia 
 Maybe the blowing star's home is my savior 
 That I sing to through my pulled apart trachea 
 Fist-fight just to feel the touch 
 Alcohol doesn't heal the cuts 
 Needle for the heroin, feel the rush 
 There's no hero for this heroine 
 Just... Us
