(Hook: Ceschi) 
 This winter lasted far too long 
 All that we loved sunk into fog 
 If one day without rain could come 
 To just make way for warmth of sun 
 (Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 What if every drop of rain's a letter from the sky 
 And they each concealed a message if you read it you could fly 
 Who would send it would you bet that it was God? 
 Cause it doesn't really matter if it's met with an applause 
 It's a testament of flaws I'll sit and face the skies now 
 Empathize with rain to anticipate the ride down 
 To find out how they dance between the paper stars 
 To embrace the dark before they inundate the night's clouds 
 Now that's an optimistic view 
 I can script a musical while options are reviewed 
 Pieces of me tend to die but I can miss the funeral 
 I fall into the view that my life is simply beautiful 
 (Hook: Ceschi) 
 This winter lasted far too long 
 All that we loved sunk into fog 
 If one day without rain could come 
 To just make way for warmth of sun 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 I try to find a pattern in the fallen leaves I walk in 
 But I can't find if I'm inside an autumn breeze or coffin 
 All I see is dark when you own both these irises 
 I attempt to bite my lips but all my teeth are sharpened 
 It's like I like to like to fight the sight that I've become 
 Like I like to like to find the night inside the sun 
 Like I tried to write the side of life that I've abided by 
 And by and by I strive to find a sign that I'm in love 
 Love is what you find when you're circling the sky 
 While you're burning all the white feathers learning how to fly 
 Searching for a sign or a version of goodbye 
 That could perfectly describe what was pertinent inside 
 I'm not certain but if I'm a brushstroke on the canvas 
 I'm scratching all my love notes on a matchstick 
 And when it catches the smoke becomes letters 
 And it floats on forever till the sun grows romantic 
 (Hook: Ceschi) 
 This winter lasted far too long 
 All that we loved sunk into fog 
 If one day without rain could come 
 To just make way for warmth of sun 
 If you are what you eat then I will eat my heart out 
 And wear it on my sleeve so it matches my apparel 
 Up the other is a sample from the tarot 
 So I can cheat destiny and gamble with the arrows 
 That they sling when I quiver in their wake up in a blizzard when I shiver and I shake 
 Love like a sinner when it's grimmer and I play 
 Tough to be delivered from this winter 
 Another night of wondering if it's the age of innocence 
 I'll plead the fifth right before I take a sip from it 
 I'll cease desist and try to break the dissonance 
 From the demon's lips just so I can make a difference 
 In this day without the rain 
 The sky is sapphire leaving traces of the stains on my skin 
 I'll never say it was in vain 
 I'll just hold my breath and pray that I can savor it again 
 (Hook: Ceschi) 
 This winter lasted far too long 
 All that we loved sunk into fog 
 If one day without rain could come 
 To just make way for warmth of sun
