How far does this rabbit hole go? 
 Alice in a Blunderland, flammable soul 
 Animals roam and the catacomb slows 
 Searching for capital, searching for hope 
 Churning the sad into tangible goals 
 They're burning their flags to adapt to the cold 
 Ration control, happiness sold 
 Eye-for-eye habits, a cannibal cult 
 They feed me cyanide tablets 
 They breathe low at the sight of my panic 
 Heavy-hearted, mind if I stab it? 
 Depths of my sanity, height of my madness 
 I'm on prescriptions, iodine tablets 
 I don't trust the water, so why would I have it? 
 Jim Jones with the Kool-Aid, sip slow 
 Two faces, one slit throat 
 Animals pile and the ocean's a medicine 
 Alcohol files, the Coke and the Mescaline 
 Antidote style, smoke for adrenaline 
 And I don't smile, it exposes my skeleton 
 I got the soul of an elephant 
 Grieving the lost on a road that's so desolate 
 Echoes are still resonant, the ghost of the Oedipus 
 And Dear God letters that I wrote for the hell of it 
 You see the tendencies 
 For them, it's to tend and cease, but not me 
 See, I can attend and get ten degrees 
 Attention-piqued, to ten till the tenure's reached, but not me 
 Increase intensity 
 I'll walk till the tendons cease, Achilles 
 I can walk to attend Dead Seas, and drown myself in it 
 Narcissus did it, give it any minute 
 I'll admit that I am just an artist that's a part of this equation, huh? 
 Nah, I'm a part of this aphasia 
 I fucked myself, I'm so auto-nymphomania 
 I gotta make-up words, it's getting harder to explain it but 
 The particles in my brain erupt 
 The pace is up, when I'm vulnerable and caught up in the mania 
 I'm in the cut off that Indica, inner-cuts 
 Never seem to cease and so I zip it shut 
 I'm on a 50, a milli, a milli grams 
 Enough so I'm not a killi, a killing them 
 I feel a million, I'm the villain I'm 
 Antagonistic, vicious obsidian 
 But so purple inspired 
 Circlin' tired in a circus attire 
 Bumbling bumble bee, worker for hire 
 Build prisons to live in, and churches for liars 
 Perfect environments to purchase desire 
 Selling their souls for which version is higher 
 Parents used to listen to that Earth, Wind and Fire 
 But I like Cohen, bird on a wire 
 Moral compass is like, "Fuck it, I don't need it" 
 If it bleeds, then it can die, and if it dies then I can eat it 
 That includes my inner demons, platitudes and my secrets that I keep 
 Atlas with the clavicle, so creep 
 With me as I crawl through the hood, maniac 
 Lunatic, or just unimpressed, yeah I've felt a hundred deaths 
 Facing all the greatest odds, but I'm in the hunt again 
 Pacing till it makes me lost, swell until I'm puffer fish 
 Razor in an aching jaw, red all in my upper-lip 
 Take it with a grain of salt, set it in the cut you left 
 Painting on the caveman walls, sentences my lover said 
 I'll chase you down the rabbit hole until I lose my breath
