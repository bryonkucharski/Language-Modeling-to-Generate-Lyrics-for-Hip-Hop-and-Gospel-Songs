Self-fulfilling not full of myself 
 I'll show 'em my hell 
 And when I go I'll pull it myself 
 December snow all cold that I felt 
 No coal that I felt could be a diamond 
 I squeezed and mined it Inshallah 
 Gave it a shot it stayed on my palms 
 Napalms don't seem to mind it stigmata 
 Everything I touch King Midas 
 Gold ain't really worth that much it's a crutch be honest 
 They're colorblind I see violets 
 Backwards Bergman's Persona 
 Everybody humming all the hymns 
 Homonyms flooding with the fish 
 Going with the flow running with the rest 
 That lowly-lowly-low still drumming on my ribs 
 Oh no save me from my life 
 Take me on a flight 
 Isn't it interesting isn't it great? 
 We disintegrate integrate drift into space 
 Like cosmic dust I was born a star 
 A storm that started a wanderlust 
 My omnibus is a work in progress 
 Till posthumous no god I trust 
 They want us all to get fucked up 
 Free spirits 
 Free spirits 
 Free spirits 
 They want us all to get fucked up

 Fireball shots fire thy blunderbuss 
 Wounds hide inside wondrous 
 Knife juggler sliced jugular 
 They utter but I'm subtler 
 Cognitive summoner 
 Cognizant front runner 
 Running up's not an option I'm opting to run amuck 
 Not one of Arsenic's stomachers 
 Let's put the cult in culture 
 I put the volt to vultures 
 Electric birds fly over oceans 
 Open sojourn soaked in sulfur 
 Those broken bones burn the same 
 Don't you know we're to blame 
 We sold our souls over chosen flames went to search the plains 
 And maintained hope floats, it won't turn to rain 
 (So turn up) Nah motherfucker get down 
 Don't get involved head down 
 Holes that we all head down, take another shot get rounds 
 Then chase another shot get rounds 
 Round here people tattoo to count years 
 Crocodile tears drown fears 
 Dirtiest mirrors perfect appearance 
 Murder each other turn 'em to spirits yeah 
 They want us all to get fucked up 
 Free spirits 
 Free spirits 
 Free spirits 
 They want us all to get fucked up 
 Free spirits

 Free spirits 
 They want us all to get fucked up 
 Free spirits
