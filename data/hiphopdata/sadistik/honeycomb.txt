Amass a massacre pupils adjust the aperture 
 My castle's Dracula brutal with just vernacular 
 Hands are tarantulas scapulas spread my angel wings 
 Halo rings are bullet holes I made to sing 
 Marijuana I'm on has got me neurotic 
 It's awfully demonic even the odds I'm oxymoronic 
 My Rottie up on the ottoman odd I'm inside a burning bush 
 That's purple Kush it's got me talking to god 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 Conscious of anacondas and monsters inside my closet 
 My concentrations methodic a constant state of a conflict 
 Accommodate 'em with coffins it's complicating my conscience 
 Haunted on occasion and congregating with convents 
 Which is is witches? Wicked Wiccans I've weakened 
 On weekends we light the wick on the spliff and split it with demons 
 I'm fiending the evening's evil these people whisper their secrets 
 I seek written upheavals to burn churches and steeples yeah 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 It's not paranoia if you're right clairvoyant inner minds 
 Smoke a half kill the nerves stare in voids to feel the high 
 I'm a sinner but my center's fine sipping wine with dinner 
 It's divine keep it cheap I'm not the vintage type 
 Don't ask again bitch I said I'm fine 
 Don't be a witch or you'll get set on fire, get left to dry 
 When I exorcise this head of mine my flesh feels like it's petrified 
 Identify their bodies by the teeth now come and testify 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb (I hide in my honeycomb, I hide in my honeycomb) 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb 
 Surrounded by killer bees so I keep a gun at home 
 Like bang stay out of my comfort zone 
 Yeah leave me the fuck alone 
 My mentality's kill or be I hide in my honeycomb 
 Surrounded by killer bees so I keep a gun at home 
 Like bang stay out of my comfort zone 
 Yeah leave me the fuck alone 
 From way up here on setting suns 
 I hope I fall and that I land on everyone I know 
 I hope they die cause so will I 
 I'm selfish and I'm small like everyone I know 
 I don't want to go outside today 
 I don't want to have to lie today 
 Either way it's tidal waves I know 
 I'll hideaway I'll hideaway I'll hideaway
