I write in long hand to a short-term memory 
 Hopeless romantic, coarse word tendencies 
 RIght now I don't want to wake up 
 Or try to forget when the storm first entered me 
 Lately I've felt self destructive 
 Self-inflicted, self help the cuts with 
 Shellshocked, Hell's bells and trumpets 
 Self-taught to tell tales in public 
 Of this life, same shit but different day 
 I write it down, same shit in different ways 
 Fight it now, break fists against the cage 
 Until I climb on that slave ship and drift away 
 My blood boils (in cups) the sun spoils (abrupt) 
 And unloyal (with love) so come toil (with us) 
 The sun freezes (and cuts) in some seasons (and plus) 
 Its untreated (so trust) I'm done bleeding 
 In a place where I can be and touch all of the things I see 
 To find my peace and I can breathe with nobody looking back at me 
 I'll just take a breath and place my bets but never deal 
 Till I face my death with a game of chess like Seventh Seal 
 I'll still fight the stepdads and memories 
 Scream Zion till deaf dance to melodies 
 Deadpanned with setbacks and jealousy 
 Until hea-ven ex-pands the hell in me 
 Acquired conscious competence of all of my accomplishments 
 And conquered constant comments that contradicted my confidence 
 Common compliments were called upon to con me in 
 Accosted consonant comments that condescended all my common sense 
 Where I'm from, no one stays alive 
 You just die by the sword, a shogun's frame of mind 
 Walk with the rest like its Dawn of the Dead 
 And drink from the blood that the open veins provide 
 My raps are like a novel with clever style and prose 
 I'm Edgar Allan Poe, the Casque of Amontillado 
 Enter catacombs till clever palindromes 
 And letters that I wrote can capture the god Apollo 
 Hear the secret stammers time'll tell 
 I rebel, they teach me manners with Bible-belt 
 Schtick, psychadellic, dreams of banter 
 Scenes of candor I embellish 
 Like a zombie that eats through tissue 
 Until I find a heart with a beat to spit to 
 If it's not in the meat I sift through 
 I'll write it acapella on the piece I bit through 
 I'm savage, and its near the dead of night 
 Wait till the sun paints an iridescent sky 
 To head the deadened cries 
 Of an old boy given no choice but to fear the present time 
 Take the reigns, I'm sick and tired of the practice 
 Of burnin' bridges, I lit the fire with a matchstick 
 Return the image to where I'm at, 'cause thinking back 
 I've been sinking fast, and tripping wires where the sands quick 
 Across plains with bloody palms and jaw pains 
 Hiding from God's grace in fright like its Pompeii 
 And always, I'll just stay on the lost road 
 While you study crucifixes painted with barcodes 
 And this time, I'll just try my luck 
 Surrounded by these masks like it's eyes wired shut 
 And I might jump ship or I flip like it's my live bus 
 So I try trust with how it was or how it is when 
 Frowns insist sounds of love amount to this 
 Too proud to kiss so I sewed my lips shut 
 So love drowned within the open wrist cuts 
 At first its just a ride to live fast 
 Until I felt the bruises inside from whiplash 
 A purpose, I'll try to get that 
 Until I fall from grace and I die on impact 
 And intact was a single broken locket 
 With the ocean on its rustic chain and face that no one wanted 
 I'm growing nauseous from a world that never stops 
 When my center's lost hope in the ghost that haunted Pentecost 
 I stand in graveyards and dance to take charge 
 Of concepts of death that I have to base on 
 Even when my bones crack I'll pace on 
 Through the epitaphs that my pasts engraved on 
 Laugh and stay strong, embrace the day 
 Till it fades away with this mask I paint on 
 She's probably just a bitch that's casting all the shadows 
 Laughing at my battles and following a trend 
 Searching for an angel at the bottom of a fifth 
 But my hands stay empty, I swallow it again 
 It's the loss of leaves that autumn brings 
 That show me these limbs are far from wings 
 I'm far from happy, you're far from peace 
 I'll fall from grace and you'll fall for me 
 And awkwardly I'll just change the posture 
 Till the aches and pains rearrange the monsters
