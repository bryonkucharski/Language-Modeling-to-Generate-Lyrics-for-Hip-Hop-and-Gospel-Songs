(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 Beautiful and innocent, suitable and militant 
 Are scripted on the walls of the cubicle I'm living in 
 I'm different, if you take away that I'm gone 
 A heart on my sleeve, with a razorblade jacket on 
 In Babylon I would hold my breath and listen close 
 To the ghosts of death the ocean kept when the winter froze 
 Skin and bones, is what my burly bag of flesh will hold 
 Digesting hope with another thirty packing Lexapro 
 Discomposed, from all the fuckin' ghosts that follow me 
 Across a battered path of shattered glass and broken arteries 
 It's oceanography the way the blood accumulates 
 I'm rude awake, with one eye open like Homer's Odyssey 
 And honestly, I don't need to make a difference 
 I just want to live my life without a fee to pay admission 
 Apathetic bliss in these apathetic days 
 'Cause I'm apathetic mixed with the pass aggressive ways 
 Anesthetic sprays from my tongue till the pain stops 
 I'm trying to figure out if this is blood or the raindrops 
 Love or a safe spot, think twice 
 While I take another shot until the angels start to sing like... 
 I've got a bone to pick with all these skeletons in closets 
 They're breaking down the barriers, embellishing my losses 
 And under all the verses, I wonder if it's worth it 
 And whether it's irrelevant, the elements are constant 
 No sleep and apparently a pen 
 Is the perfect combination for the therapy again 
 So I scribble in a pad till it carries me within 
 All the ripples in my past that I carefully attend 
 When all I got to do is take a look into my pedigree 
 And mentally amenities will make another memory 
 The penalties are lending me a bitter loss of energy 
 A destiny of inhibition until my wings will set me free, now 
 No time for regrets, keep moving forward and hope for the best 
 It's all gone, I'll say so long and never let go of what I hold in my chest 
 This is dedicated to the dedication left behind 
 Me, a dedicated mental patient on a bed of knives 
 I meant to find a certain person worthy of current purpose 
 Searching through the epitaphs to make the dead alive 
 And edify as I watch all the faces walking by 
 Painted with perplexing looks, abrasions and awkward eyes 
 Showing me to modify broken wings I've taught to fly 
 Often I go and dream of a place across the sky 
 Where I reside and dark breaks the light 
 Never stop moving, a sharks way of life 
 Set still as sparks drape the sky 
 And debt builds, a heart pays the price with 
 Love, pain, sun, rain, (I remember when my mother used to lie to me) 
 Hate, grace, blood stains (and I remember when my father used to lie to me) 
 Life, death, time, rest, (and I remember when my teachers used to lie to me) 
 This is my breath (and then they wonder why I have no faith in this society) 
 I can't find stability I lack the right ability 
 To act inside humility and magnify the will in me 
 Every time I try to be, satisfy or feel at ease 
 I'd rather be an actor and to act than try to deal with things 
 Until I fall and I hit the rock bottom 
 And I grieve with the leaves till I pray it's not autumn 
 The blood starts to draw and it falls from the wrists 
 When the slits are across and I ball up a fists 
 So call it a gift but I'm not living for the present 
 When it all becomes the past and I can't listen to the questions 
 Isn't it a blessing when I feel like I'm alive 
 And I don't have to be another fucking cynic for a second 
 (I remember somebody once asked me if I ever thought about regret... the answers no. Because when this masquerade is finally over I want to be remembered for who I am. Not who I was or who I wanted to be, 'cause this right here, this is me, so follow this) 
 Even though I've never called it perfect 
 When I die, I want to know it all was worth it 
 I want to know that I tried my best with 
 Embracing every moment that I was blessed with 
 Every life, every death, every time that I wept 
 Every moment, every person, every line that I said 
 Every night, every day, every time every place 
 Every kiss, every wish, every side of the maze 
 Every cut, every bruise, every love that I'd lose 
 Every time that I broke and the times that I grew 
 Every drop of rain that these clouds would spew 
 To help form the man that I amounted to 
 And I'm thankful, that I am who I am 
 And I've been where I've been and I came out grateful 
 When it's finally time to make an exit 
 Just know, that I don't regret a single second 
 This is the exception to everything 
 This is the exception to everything (x6)
