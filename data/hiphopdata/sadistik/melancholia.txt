(Sadistik) 
 My body's made of cells and cells are made to keep you caged 
 I keep awake to celebrate my sweet escape 
 I've seen the flames of this hell and made it either way 
 So why be afraid, It's okay 
 It's just fire it's just love it's just us 
 It's just trust it's just this once 
 When these small talk graces keep me warm 
 Like a small-pox blanket in a storm 
 When the rainfalls and entrenches all that gets touched 
 Making evergreens to defend against the next one 
 I'll take a Redrum neat or on the rocks 
 One of these cocktails will be a molotov 
 If I keep it up eyes shut and my feet are stuck 
 Icarus wings adjust just so I can reach the sun 
 So I can sing with such ardor I deplete my lungs 
 And my heart beats so much that it starts seizing up 
 These are the symptoms of an optimist 
 Melancholia kissed him on his bottom lip 
 And here I am, a picture of accomplishment 
 Mixture of the opposites insecure and confident 
 So is this a path of glory 
 Or a dead end to a lonely saddened story 
 Where I buried my confession I married my depression 
 Now the holy matrimony's grown to owing alimony 
 Show me what I hide beneath my grin, under my deceitful skin's 
 Another guy I'd like to meet, I wonder why he seems so grim 
 Every piece of him they subdivide to equal bits 
 To pitch into the ocean told 'em love is blind so sink or swim 
 And so I oblige breast stroking side to side 
 Till the stroke inside my breast gets hold and I abide 
 And so by and by I try to fight a tide that's tidal sized 
 Until my vital signs subside and I write my goodbyes 
 To my friends that are dropping like flies 
 It's a trend that I'll follow in time 
 I pretend that I ought to be fine 
 Getting dizzy once again from these wandering eyes of mine 
 I need some R & R I think I'll drink some R & R 
 Sip spirits lift spirits then I'll raise the bar at bars 
 I bring the darkest part of myself door to door 
 Let's press our chests together then we'll have a heart to heart 
 I saw a falling star and didn't wish upon it 
 If you're not that superstitious you don't get that disappointed 
 I'll never say I'm different, 'cause I've never made a difference 
 And I've yet to pay attention to the debt that I've avoided 
 I set to write a portrait out of my emotional confessions 
 This is spring cleaning for a closet full of bone collections 
 I'm not alone the monochrome is so infectious 
 But I won't regret it if I follow all my own directions
