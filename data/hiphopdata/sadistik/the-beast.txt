(Talking: Sadistik) 
 The song is called the beast 
 It's about... feeling ugly 
 (Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 I've been whittling a niche a heart that's made of wood 
 Is feeling pitiful and sick so I'm parting ways for good 
 A minimal intent's on that could've would've should've 
 Try to look up high if I mistook the miserable events 
 I look up at the sky and I pry both my eyes open 
 So I can decide if it's worth it just to try and 
 This is what it's like when you fight all the nightmares 
 To try to find some light there and hold it all in my hands 
 And the parable is done ugly duckling swan dived into the barrel of a gun 
 I spent my afternoons alone to stare into the sun 
 To attract an opposite and go get married just for fun 
 Come undone predict another mental lapse 
 Screaming from the top of my lungs until the windows crack 
 Drinking all the vodka to hush all of my impulse that's 
 Seeking for the optimal buzz to get my limbs detached 
 And I'm a part of all the lies 
 This she loves me not mentality makes gardens all divide 
 The particle I hide is the iron in my blood 
 I'll set fire to the sun until the waterfalls are dry 
 Father son and holy ghost bottled rum and lonely folks 
 Dance within the lines so they can swallow some and Dosey Doe 
 I'm so alone I've been living in a vacant pit 
 Just another voodoo doll victim of relationships 
 I studied every single eyelash 
 On her little face and they look like Venus flytraps 
 I always knew I'd meet a nice catch 
 I didn't think that she would bite back 
 So please fail me now, you with the pitchfork hey bail me out 
 Man I act like a man-i-ac I just can't fight back 
 When this greyscale surrounds me 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 You say hello there, I say it's hell here 
 Look at my face to find trace of swell years 
 With my tongue in my cheek in spite of when I go to bite it 
 So the blood is released I try to 
 Look inside me when I summon the beast to fight him 
 So I guide him right under the sheets to hide it 
 It's a violent thrill, rhythm of a silent film 
 Cycle of the moon when it's hunt and release 
 I might've been sent to jail when I'm dead-set to fail 
 I felt it coming the death sentence braille 
 Misery loves comforting and best friends prevail 
 It's The Beauty and the Beast it's La Bete et la Belle 
 Please come and kill me with a bullet made of silver 
 Or a stake inside my chest so I can finally go to sleep 
 When these lovely feelings are so cold it makes me shiver 
 When it's breaking my defense so don't go crying over me 
 Then dream of another fortune that's not average 
 Sing with a little forked tongue like a basilisk 
 These simple days of boredom are so cancerous 
 Seems like I might be sort of like a masochist 
 I'm so enamored by the swell marks 
 Breaking all the mirrors just to crawl out of my skin 
 I'm Ester Greenwood I've been trapped inside a Bell Jar 
 Believing all the speeches from a charlatan again 
 I got lectured on the matter 
 That my topics are myopic non-sequitur and scattered 
 He uses big words complex with all the patterns 
 But maybe it's for me and not you 
 I formerly denounce my former self and form deformities 
 Conform to formations that were forced to form abnormally 
 Before I forfeit my fortress and forget my fortune 
 I'll fortify so you can burn me at the stake 
 Tricyclics with an SSRI 
 Just might fix this mix of intense hard times 
 Light gets dim when I get this dark side 
 As time tic tic tics and excess stars die 
 'Cause I'm a monster in the flesh 
 Being haunted by the topics that I conjure with my breath 
 This is how a death feels this is all that's left 
 When there's nowhere else to run and you're caught inside the web 
 Of the beast
