(Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 I ain't a killer, but don't push me 
 Revenge is like the sweetest joy, exorcise the demon's noise I got inside 
 Set my sight to "seek/destroy" and watch 'em die 
 I've yet to find a decent void, to occupy 
 So I modified my face a bit to get inside this place again 
 My voice is feeling hoarse-I let it fly and call it Pegasus 
 So you can take your pick and pick your perk or poison 
 While I play the prick again to pin your picture perfect ploy on 
 No-I won't say I'm getting stronger 
 'Cause what doesn't kill me only makes me wait a little longer 
 Play the Chupacabra when I take a few more shots of 
 All the Jamey, booze and vodka till I change into a monster 
 And somehow, it's so real to me 
 Philistine think-patterns that I fight until I bleed 
 Still I weave dreamcatchers just so I can steal your dreams 
 Eyedea told me, "Kill the king"-I don't feel a thing now 
 (Hook: Deacon the Villain) 
 I give up everything I've ever had 
 Give up everything I'll ever be 
 Throughout my life, I've done the illest things 
 To pay that price, I gotta kill the king 
 Give up everything you've ever had 
 Give up everything you'll ever be 
 Throughout your life, you've done the illest things 
 To pay that price, we gotta kill the king (kill the king) 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 Why am I alone, feeling violent inside my skull? 
 It's all golden, the silence that is mine to own 
 Dianetics, I suppose, side-effects of highs and lows 
 Ups and downs, come around, spider webs inside my home 
 I hope you miss me when I leave 
 And not beautify my path until I'm getting old and weak 
 In the suicide capital, the city full of grief breeds 
 Do-or-die passion for the vitriol I speak 
 Man I love it, come find me mastering the puppets 
 In a public-confined, I'm laughing at the others 
 Six million ways to fly, so choose one 
 I tried to wing it and failed, until I grew some 
 I'm looking at the world through these rose-colored glasses 
 And concluded that it's only full of low-budget actors 
 With their slow cuts and bad scripts, I'll play the recluse 
 Yeah I could probably show you the ropes-in the shape of a noose (so hang in there)
