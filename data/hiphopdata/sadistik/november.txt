(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 Sometimes, I can't handle the cold 
 Ill break another heart too fragile to hold 
 Love dies, I'm standing alone, 
 Painting false hopes is a habit I've grown 
 Come find, why I said I don't love you 
 And instead I was humbled and content with the struggle 
 That you gave me, and said that I was crazy 
 Words became chains and love became safety 
 I saw trust until I lost the view... 
 And then I lost faith in us like I always do 
 I refused, to complement your weakness 
 Through all our ups and downs till I was sea-sick 
 ...Flashbacks I remember so well, we both held 
 In November, when the snow fell 
 But that changed, you were not a friend to me 
 I distorted and soon I lost identity 
 And when we fought and I tried to break the innocence 
 You said lies, and I became a hypocrite 
 You tried to hold the sadness when you grabbed tight 
 (But I moved on from the shadows of our past life) 
 You said you couldn't live if I ran away 
 But part of me died, anyway, when I had to stay 
 In a storm that I saw in groundview 
 And I couldn't find the I (eye), it was all about U (you) 
 (Hook - Sadistik) 
 Year One! I felt the dear sun 
 A brand new hope before the tears come 
 Year two! I see In clear view 
 Ashamed of myself when I am near you 
 Year three! I watch the stars fade 
 I'm a zombie whos walking through a heartache 
 Year four! You're forever away and the sun now shines as my memories fade 
 (Verse 2 - Sadistik) 
 All the feelings I have are hard to word 
 I can't see the problem, my vision starts to blur 
 Into an image of a violent struggle 
 Of a slow suicide since the time I loved you 
 Id, gladly die if you'd pacify 
 But you need too many things that I can't provide, so 
 You looked for it inside another's arms 
 Lied through ya teeth and cried that nothings wrong 
 (It didn't stop) all the cryin in public 
 Or telling me I'm not the only guy you were fuckin'! 
 But I gave in to all my fears instead 
 The only thing that ran more than me (were the tears you shed) 
 When you told me you cut inside ya flesh 
 You're depressed and you'd rather die instead 
 I could feel my heart tear to bits 
 (The first time I've cried ever since my parents split) 
 And I knew, there was no you and I 
 I kissed you goodbye, it felt like suicide 
 Ob a bond that was made to sever 
 When I turned my back on you and wouldn't face the weather 
 And for a moment, it felt like nothing mattered 
 There's givers and there's takers, and you're just the latter 
 I needed help but I got a struggle 
 When I fell to pieces you couldn't solve the puzzle 
 (We wept in puddles) till we were lost at sea 
 (With regretful struggles) and a faded promise ring 
 Your hands were full 'cause you seemed to hold grudges 
 While I chased both of our dreams through rosebushes, in November 
 (Hook - Sadistik) 
 Year One! I felt the dear sun 
 A brand new hope before the tears come 
 Year two! I see In clear view 
 Ashamed of myself when I am near you 
 Year three! I watch the stars fade 
 I'm a zombie whos walking through a heartache 
 Year four! You're forever away and the sun now shines as my memories fade 
 (Verse 3 - Sadistik) 
 I couldn't think to hold a single hope 
 So I pressed on my luck until my fingers broke 
 I'm treading steps through quicksand of past love 
 To find closure from ice shoulders and hands touch 
 And my mind is still plagued with the fragrances 
 Of pain and bliss, and razorblades you made me grip 
 When Id watch ya face with teary eyes 
 And I had to cut myself so I could feel alive, but 
 I found a place where the weather is much better now 
 In greener pastures, where the rain is never out 
 And ya face is replaced by another 
 November's leaves stay, but have changed for the summer 
 (And my) hope meddles (where I) go settle 
 In the line that blurs from love to rose petals 
 And the silence hurt, so I just followed through 
 On a beaten street, never reaching peaks which I saw in you 
 And now I see that you just took me for granted 
 Had a diamond in the rough and you still took me for granite 
 'Cause in November we gazed at sea scapes 
 With each wave, symbolizing things that wed make 
 Love and war we were born as keepsakes 
 To underscore loves accord when peace breaks, In November
