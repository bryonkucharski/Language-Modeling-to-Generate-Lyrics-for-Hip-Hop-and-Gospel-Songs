(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 Tip your cups, to the late night writing binge 
 Of stagefright, another playwright dies again 
 I reach for great heights and play my violin 
 On my vocal chords where the great whites hide within 
 I'm neglectin' broken veins and the ventricles that break 
 When I'm hiding what I feel in a Texas Hold 'Em face 
 I better fold that ace, and find a past time 
 Pride has flat-lined and my pedastol's at stake 
 Reality's orphan kid, casualty abortion vict' 
 Journalist of worth, personality contortionist 
 My claws scrape the granite 
 Scratchin' pain poems in hallways I'm trapped in 
 I think of Colepaugh taking his final breath 
 And the bullets that he lodged in David McDonald's chest 
 I swear to god that I felt the bullets too 
 In a homicide, suicide I sing the ocean blues 
 Hear the sounds, of a thousand broken spirits 
 A man who wouldn't lie and a crowd who won't endear it 
 Confessions of a clown that's sounding so sincere when 
 He always faced the ground, wrote it down in quotes and lyrics 
 I've got a ghost, but he never stays in touch 
 Another hole to dig and another grave to love 
 Another fifth is gone, another day that sucks 
 Another dream is dead as the summer fades to dusk 
 I gotta find the time of day when I'm awake and no 
 I'm not afraid to migrate and hide away alone 
 And every single song I make is another piece of my 
 Peace of mind, if I fall in line and swallow pride I'll (choke) 
 On rum and cokes, I'm runnin' low on beer and weekend booze 
 Just to ink a song and singalong right here to sing to you 
 I'm out of love and tired and I'm sounding uninspired 
 When I'm drinking till I puke without a single reason to 
 With a one one two, when I con-front you 
 When I do all the things that the fuck ups do 
 Come to another place, undo lovin' mistakes 
 When I'm summonin' something abundant I'm lovin' instead of just runnin' away 
 A-way to look past this is gaze through look glasses 
 Semantics passions practiced actions and that's it when I catch wind in an-tics 
 (I wrote this for you Phoenix... listen) 
 Every single night I pray my letters form a kiss 
 And it blows through the wind until it rests upon her lips 
 A metamorphosis that the butterflies imagine 
 In undecided fashion when weather storms emit 
 She settles scores with this and I just sit enchanted 
 As fireflies dance until her wish is granted 
 I listen frantic to melodies of heartbreak 
 It feels so temporary but she's telling me it's always 
 I'd die in hell so my angel's not alone 
 And I'd swim inside her blood for a fatal drop of hope 
 Just to prove our engagements are soluble 
 And dance to the chorus when the rain hits the solitude 
 And breaks into molecules, that's her 
 Another piece of me that feels but can't hurt 
 I stand firm, in this apocalyptic breeze 
 Until I finally fall apart and then my confidence is breached 
 And I'm gone... and I'm gone...
