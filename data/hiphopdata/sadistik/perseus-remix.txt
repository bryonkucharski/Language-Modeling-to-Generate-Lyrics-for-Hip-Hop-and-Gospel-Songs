Keeping the snakes out of my circle 
 Keeping the saints out of my virtue 
 Keeping the strangers out of my personal space 
 Perseus, Perseus, Perseus, Perseus 
 Keeping the snakes out of my circle 
 Keeping the saints out of my virtue 
 Keeping the strangers out of my personal space 
 Perseus, Perseus, Perseus, Perseus 
 My DNA's a double helix 
 Looking like snakes fighting I can feel it 
 Bite like a Venus rise like a Phoenix 
 Reincarnation I die then repeat it 
 Yahweh I don't play 
 Get the fuck out my face 
 Talk in tongues charm the, snakes 
 And watch your gods all rot away 
 Every morning check my garden guarding from the garters 
 Eat your heart out I'm an artist of the scars semi-auto demigods 
 Daughters of Darkness or martyrs for the pawns? 
 I'm a dog I'm appalled pallbearer for the lost 
 Make your own wave or drown in theirs 
 Fakes that role play are bound to perish 
 Fuck devotion with bows and prayers 
 Cut me open to count the layers 
 My stomach is always full of bile and wasps (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 The brain in my skull resembles a pile of asps (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 The rest of it looks like a pomegranate 
 Heavy handed both my palms are granite 
 To touch the throat of the odd and manic 
 Still cutting cobras like it's automatic 
 I just revved up the lawnmower 
 Snakes in the grass so ima mow it 
 I keep the Gualla on top of me 
 Jump in the wallaby, jump in the wallaby yeah 
 Swallow me and you'll start calling me honestly honestly 
 I think you got a problem man 
 Aye I think I got a problem man 
 Off a couple of them Xans 
 Off the heroin again 
 What I'm off the heroin again 
 Young Slugga Slugga Perseus as fuck 
 Cut the pussy off like it's nothing 
 Yeah I got Medusa head on me 
 No I ain't wearing no 'sace 
 Slugger rounded up off a couple of them beans 
 Man Iike scream scream scream 
 Scream when they see me 
 Young Slugger glow it up 
 To bling, I'm too bling fuck none of y'all 
 Can't fuck with y'all nah fuck y'all
