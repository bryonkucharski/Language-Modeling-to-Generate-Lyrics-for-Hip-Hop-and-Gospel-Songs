(Intro (Sadistik and Astronautalis)) 
 I am the only one they made 
 Cast from charming bones and clay 
 On that cold Winter's day or so they say 
 We are the last known to exist 
 Hiding shine remote cliffs 
 We prefer it that way 
 Please leave us just like this 
 (Verse One: Astronautalis) 
 I used to hammer sheet metal till my palms bled 
 Cash my pay check at the bar then drink the whole thing 
 Catch a pheasant with my bare hands, take her home with me 
 Wake up at 5am and make it back to work to start again 
 You're sweating whiskey in your first shift 
 By lunch break you're feeling worthless 
 And soon you're cracking jokes with workers 
 By the time the final whistle blows, your body's feeling perfect 
 So let's celebrate the good times 
 Another round for the old guys 
 And to that pretty thing with glazed eyes 
 I ain't asking for a dance, I'm just hoping for a great night 
 (Hook: Astronautalis (Sadistik)) 
 'Cause when the stopwatch dies we all drop like flies, so what's the point in being free to die (Right?) 
 (You see it's not my time, I thought I lost my mind but instead it found a place to hide) 
 Keep your fucking keys, I don't need to drive (nah), I'll just run for the rest of the night 
 (Empty handle with my tongue on the edge of a knife, make me young, make me numb, till my exit arrives) 
 (Bridge: Lotte Kestner) 
 My heart it pounds, so I can't make out a sound 
 I've come this far, and I couldn't live without you now 
 If my heart beats now, then I'll go turn around 
 If you know me, nobody does 
 (Verse Two: Sadistik) 
 Damaged goods tend to hide in pretty packages 
 Saddened looks get disguised in witty adages 
 It's our dramatic twist, come watch the magic tricks 
 Abracadabra, necromancer sawed in half again 
 So I mutter some witty quips 
 If love is to give a glimpse, what's under my skinny ribs 
 A couple of whiskey sips or something to get me fixed 
 Before I'm antisocial like it's Buffalo 66 in here 
 So is it beautiful or frail? 
 I feel like Ouroboros when I'm chewing on my tail 
 The crows can form a chorus when the funeral prevails 
 It shows a glowing orange when the moon is full and pale 
 Wide awake and rueful, looking for a light to break the stupor 
 Of the types of grey that dilate my pupils 
 I can taste the sucrose on the tip of my tongue-y tongue 
 From tidal waves I'm running from but isn't it funny once it's done?
