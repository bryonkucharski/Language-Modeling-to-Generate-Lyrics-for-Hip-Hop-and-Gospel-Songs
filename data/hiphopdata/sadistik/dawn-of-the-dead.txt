[Verse 1 - Sadistik] 
 This is magic, its tragic, its passion, it's me 
 This is classic romance and its madness, its peace 
 This is masochists, catholics, addicts and activists 
 Blackness and sadness that pacifists see 
 This is close to me, focusing, ghosts that sing (Axioms!) 
 Rosary, broken wings holding me (Back-a-wards!) 
 Followed the path to to to find find find this 
 And I swallowed the wrath to un-ite my intents-tents-tents 
 Tensions will build, walls will collapse 
 Lessons instilled when I saw through the cracks 
 Cracked smiles repaired, we just crawl in our tracks 
 'Cause we live just to die, we evolve to adapt 
 To the fast food and the tattoos 
 It's like I just can't see past the bad news 
 And I can't bruise, like a statue 
 But I'm fallin' apart from the shrap-nel 
 This is casualties, atrophy, mastering (axioms!) 
 Gravity, gradually, askin' me (back-a-wards!) 
 Progress make can you when reverse in be why? 
 Feel I how just that's 'cause reverse in words speak I 
 Any and every engaging discussion 
 Of lovin's engraving a memory in me 
 Memories in me engraving the lovin' 
 Of every and any engaging discussion 
 High high high mid mid mid low low low (Next!) 
 Why try my wish if this goal I holds (Dead!) 
 Sooner or later I'll drown in regret 
 When I'm swimming in circles and holding my breath
