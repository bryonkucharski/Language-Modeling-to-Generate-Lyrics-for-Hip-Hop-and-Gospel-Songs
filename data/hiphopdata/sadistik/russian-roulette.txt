(Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 I'm a victim of an over-active limbic system 
 Follow me and you will know the madness that I live in 
 No magic, just an open casket criticism 
 Carry me inside or you can bury me alive right 
 When we met it was innocent enough 
 I said "Hi it's nice to meet you I am mister self destruct 
 I'm in your blood you're a victim of the rush 
 But you're flirting with disaster when you kiss and tell my love 
 Make more beds of nails so you can stay warm 
 Sang chords in a medley till my face tore 
 Pray for living dead that walk and pace forth 
 Rain pours in my head, it's called a brainstorm 
 This game you're playing is so tedious 
 Black out on white lies and blame it on bulimia 
 Yeah, now I'm saying all your secrets huh 
 Should've thought twice before you grazed with your demon's touch 
 No disrespect but the real love doesn't show 
 Till I kiss your neck and my steel tongue cuts your throat 
 I feel numb when the tears run uncontrolled 
 Like it's synthemesc and I steal some of your soul 
 Until the self-help starts 
 When you'd bite my heart to see if it was really made of gold 
 I extinguished flames until hell fell dark 
 And buried bodies under floorboards like Tell Tale Heart, so run 
 (Hook: Yes Alexander) 
 I will watch you pray 
 As the steel shaft enters your brain 
 Tell me baby how many times 
 One thousand tries 
 And you're still alive 
 (Verse 2: Cage) 
 I don't really think that I'm often ill 
 What would you wear to death a cross or nil 
 Should've known she was only out to fill 
 Some sort of void I was out to kill 
 Any time left was the sand that fell 
 Anything to keep me from standing still 
 Spend it like you happened to land a mil 
 Wake up throwing up random pills 
 You want to feel it under your bones in your marrow 
 You hope cupid ran off with more arrows 
 Better off in passage ways to find pharaohs 
 When the road you walk is too narrow 
 Start flying stop falling 
 Like you did when you first stopped crawling 
 Threw it all on the table and went all in 
 'Cause I knew it had to be my calling 
 (Sadistik) 
 Nothing's what it seems, life is but a dream 
 And I'm busy sleepwalking to find out what it means
