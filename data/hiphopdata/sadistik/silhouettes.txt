Silhouettes in my stomach 'til it pangs 
 Thunder reigns we think of summer when in pain 
 From windowpanes I think how some are just in pain 
 Then winter came out in the colors that I paint 
 Yea we runaway to try to find a better plain 
 In bed or plane it's fly or die in heaven's name 
 Our fliers dyed by feathered wings 
 We buy our by and bys & go wherever zephyrs aim 
 And those who don't know decide by weathervane 
 Or put a slow poke inside a weathered vein 
 Whether vain or insecure the cure's to sell the fake 
 Wrap it in cellophane sacrifice the self for fame 
 We celebrate the dead & mourn so I pour up 
 They said I'm plain & never more so I Poe em 
 I'll leave the ravens raving 'bout my poems 
 To each their own but you can read my palm 
 They're not impressed my stomachs tied in knots depressed 
 I've come to press the pressure present in my sunk-in chest 
 There's no treasure in this sunken chest 
 Under duress underdressed we can't suck in breath 
 In the breadth of the shrunken heads we call to you 
 Sonic booms is what the knocks turn to 
 We're nocturnal dizzy from the crop circles 
 Acid burns we're taciturn & non-verbal 
 Still we mill through the mildew 
 They're frail with the braille but they still say they feel you 
 What you don't know can kill you 
 That one-in-a-mill you can't come from that milieu 
 They told us we could be anything 
 They always lie through their teeth 
 They told us we could chase any dream 
 And then we died in our sleep 
 I sit upon my pedestal 
 Await the day you don't come home 
 Your shades fade into your throne 
 Your silhouette and what's soon to become 
 Your scent lingers as the sun goes down 
 Your shape fades and time goes on 
 Your body burns at the break of dawn 
 And I've lost track where we are 
 Your scent lingers as the sun goes down 
 Your shape fades and time goes on 
 Your body burns at the break of dawn 
 And I've lost track where we are 
 Your scent lingers as the sun goes down 
 Your shape fades and time goes on 
 Your body burns at the break of dawn 
 And I've lost track where we are
