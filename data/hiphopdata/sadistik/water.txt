This state of mine is made of pine 
 I pine to see your state of mind 
 Pineal lost at sea 
 The water keeps my state alive 
 I'm sanctified I'm holy 
 Made to die we're temporary 
 At best we're wary 
 And stay inside our estuaries 
 Wearing all our armor 
 Water's where we wander 
 Drowning all our daughters 
 Mounting in the harbors 
 Mountains full of martyrs 
 Monsters in reflections 
 Carcasses in ponds 
 From the narcissists that pondered 
 Conquer Kilimanjaro's my purpose 
 So I fill 'em sorrow like Goethe 
 Certain persons sneer I persevere 
 Lurking working my nerve up 
 And my body's made of carbon dates 
 Some H-2-0 astronomy 
 We on delay through modern day 
 'Cause we're all made of water 
 Sink or swim that quote is tired 
 Cling to it like a floating tire 
 Tie our knots up to the shore 
 Till we're sure there's no more fire 
 I'm no one's island ocean guided 
 So inspired soaked and silent 
 Water is thicker than blood that's why all our minutes 
 Spent lifting our chins up above the water 
 We've been on this ship forever 
 Passing by dead of night time see together 
 Storm is here torn sail can't predict the weather 
 No captain inner compass still spins sporadic 
 Glistening down on the bottom follow the glow 
 Tentacles wrapped around octopus 
 Is telepathic magnetic to hidden treasure 
 That sparkles below 
 So keep my mind right above it 
 Body sways down on the ocean floor 
 Drenched to the bone marrow suck salt open sore 
 Broken ore float hope to coast to shore 
 Sipping that soma the oldest elixir 
 Been drippin' from skies up above 
 Lost liquid drip spills from the brim 
 Down chin of god-head made of gold 
 Hung on the wall 
 Fall, tricklin' 
 Make ripples in the middle of an infinite stream 
 The only one I ever bow to is her - her 
 Feel the body I'm living in 
 Maternal matrix maker of our circuits 
 The surface tension is breaking 
 The deeper secrets are re-emerging 
 Our first reflection was naked 
 Amniotic sac inner fabric 
 Unraveling vertical axis 
 Fluctuating light light light right at light speed 
 Bright scintilla keeps flickerin' 
 Tell my shadows I'm innocent 
 Tasted it - armed to the teeth 
 With a heart that beats to a rhythm we deemed it as sacred 
 Dripping wet 
 Soaked in the sin cleansed from the smoke 
 Cloaked with the sweat ever since that anchor sank 
 Shifting waves seven billion faces vibrating in the wind 
 Walk the plank world awakened 
 Pearly gates were made to break 
 She was our first mirror, taught us how to crystalize 
 Dreams in the minds eye shining in the sky 
 Ice caps keep melting 
 Fuel to feed the fire she keeps us alive 
 We feel her inside, we fill it up higher 
 Hold her up higher, higher 
 I don't want to drown today 
 But the tide is higher than my desire 
 I think I might count the days 
 I don't want to drown today 
 But the tide is higher than my desire 
 I think I might count the days 
 I don't want to drown today 
 But the tide is higher than my desire 
 I think I might count the days 
 I don't want to drown today 
 But the tide is higher than my desire 
 I think I might count the days
