(Verse 1: Sadistik) 
 Somberly I sit alone watching while the city glows 
 Keeping to myself, walking on my tippy-toes 
 So silent but locked in with the witty prose 
 To propose as confident when talking to the pretty folks 
 And they're so awkward in their videos 
 Lost within a spinning globe, nauseous and it's getting old 
 Oh I can see it on their face I don't get a lot of praise 
 I'll bet I'll posthumously get it though 
 So I can let it go go I guess 
 Ninety-nine percent of one-percenters don't exist 
 I wine and dine with letters as a pleasure opiate 
 To bring my mind back to the center 'fore the medics open it 
 So here's another piece of me forgotten and ignored 
 Another piece I sharpened with a sword 
 The apple of my eye, she was rotten to the core 
 So I left her in the trash where she belongs and I've long since ignored 
 I know there's aphids in my chest to get 
 The butterflies I'm feeling when I strain to make the best of it 
 I run and hide to heal again from basic taste of death I'm getting 
 From the times of dealing with relationship-recklessness 
 And now I'm hiding in the night 
 'Cause it's a full moon and the lycans tend to bite 
 There's lighting in between my eyelids and it's frightening when it strikes 
 And it might get me blinded by the light 
 It's so quiet in a sense, the silence just reflects 
 There's a crisis in my head from the vices I possess 
 And the prices that I set on the diamonds I collect 
 Well I guess except one 'cause I hide it in my chest 
 Seven devils in my head saying they're a friend 
 Seven devils in my head playing their pretend 
 Seven devils placing bets, seven devils made of flesh 
 Seven devils in my head craving for attention 
 Seven devils in my head making their amends 
 Seven devils in my head waiting for the end 
 Seven devils made a pledge, seven devils playing dead 
 Seven devils in my head saying they're a friend 
 I always believe you why don't you believe me 
 (Verse 2: Sadistik) 
 I got a desk full of papers left for the tapeworms 
 Breath full of Tanqueray left from the anger 
 Head full of anchors, bed full of strangers 
 That I think I met I forget what their names were 
 So I'll smile while I grit my teeth 
 Dimethyltryptamine high I can get from dreams 
 Fine, I'll show why I'm a different breed 
 Jim Morrison tip, I am the lizard king 
 It's like A Clockwork Orange 
 Cody DeLarge show me your heart 
 A star is born okay 
 Pull me apart I can watch the gore and say 
 I'm showing your god what scars are for today 
 I write along right along a dotted line to write a poem 
 'Cause I've been on a higher height of flight to fight the tiresome 
 I am just uninspired violent fired up 
 Carcass that's been caught in constant carnage so don't try to run 
 My eyes adjust in size when the light erupts 
 I like the touch smell taste and the sight of blood 
 What I don't think that's what I meant 
 So here's a snow angel that I'll leave in the cement 
 Let's take a drink to the secrets that I kept 
 Just between us and another for the pieces that I left 
 In a sequence and I hoped that you would read it and it said 
 That there's one too many of these fucking demons in my head
