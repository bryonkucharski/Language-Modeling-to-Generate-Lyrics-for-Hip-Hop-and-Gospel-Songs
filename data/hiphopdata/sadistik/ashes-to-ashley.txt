(Verse 1 - Mac Lethal) 
 For every hole I've punched in the wall 
 Every piece of paper crumbled as we've suffer in the bloodiest fall 
 For every pulsating ego blistered into moon ripe nosebleeds 
 I nurse these festering wounds and drop rose seeds 
 But grow an orchid garden 
 Now the paint on your portrait hardens with a face that resorts to chagrin 
 Scribbled like a suicide note 
 Like I'll stop 
 I show the beauty by a profile shot 
 Freeze, don't fret for the truth 
 'Cause I'll pray till I heard footsteps on the roof 
 I swear to god I don't believe in angels 
 Ask me, atheist, ashly 
 Where's the wings in this relationship 
 Passions has passed me, cast another spell 
 Mortified, melancholy, Madness to Michelle 
 Suicide Sarah, alliterate your fate, worship the absence, and demonstrate my faith 
 (Face in the mirror on my bathroom door 
 I saw her dance in rain in the summer downpour) 
 I saw her dance till the rain put the fire out 
 Burned at the stake, Joan of Arc little anxious saint 
 I illustrate the gates of hell into my notebook her flesh burns up in the furnace 
 Ashes to Ashley 
 Urns to something earnest 
 I slit my wrist and curse with an ink pen 
 Write a revelation, burn a stack of bibles 
 Question my faith, get my churlish ass to smile 
 Find another subtle piece of confidence to muster 
 Her ministry echoes in this monolithic structure 
 Cremate the dying Christmas trees 
 The winter is full of bitter, ashy, black blizzards 
 And when the superstition delivered 
 And it came down the chimney they found her in the fire place with me 
 Ashes to Ashley 
 The fire's only half dead, how many angels can you fit on a match head 
 Count them 
 Try start a fire 
 Do it 
 Turn the volume down or write a song to her movement (x4) 
 (Verse 2 - Sadistik) 
 We walked a broken path while the sun was bleak 
 And we were holding hands on these rusted swings 
 That I called "us" and my love would sink 
 Underseas that we would drown underneath 
 When you would swim deep to catch my lip's speech 
 To try to catch drifts to catch what it means 
 And you found what would grow between us 
 So I thought about you while I wrote The Phoenix 
 And now my spine shivers from the notes that you speak 
 Of perfect pitched melodies and emotions you seek 
 That I'm composing in dreams, so you see that I love you 
 And I'll hold your broken dreams till I'm bleeding in puddles 
 She breaks bones, engraves poems in gravestones (Text!) 
 Paints quotes of pathos when pain grows (Next!) 
 Rain flows became hopes of rainbows (When!) 
 Angels with halos and saints spoke (Blessed!) 
 Death to this world now we've given enough 
 I wanna hide you from the company that misery loves 
 And so I draw blood with few strokes and our love it drew close 
 So you can draw attention with the pen that you hold 
 Reveal your energy; and we'll just get to keep 
 The radio-active I can feel your chemistry 
 When we gaze at sea waves and freebase off replays 
 That re-late to cliches to see fate will be grace 
 I find peace in our dance on ice sheets 
 To bathe your silhouette in the tears the skies weep 
 We'll burn bridges to find warmth from life's storms 
 And cross roads at the point where lives meet 
 I'll show you memories I hate to reveal 
 If you could feel what I say Then I could say what I feel 
 And I finally learned what it takes to confess 
 I'll take you to place filled with grace and sunsets
