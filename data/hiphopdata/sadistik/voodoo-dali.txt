My polar eyes are icy 
 They polarize what I see 
 While they deal lies I idealize 
 I know that I can die free 
 I know that we can die too 
 On any weekend I choose 
 In a weakened state we pray to him 
 Then we can state our praise in hymns 
 They hem and haw amen 
 Pay the Pentecost for our sins 
 It's Arsenic mixed with arson lit 
 Artifice carcasses so artific-- 
 Don't smite the tongue for you speak in them 
 Then bite the palm that they feed you with 
 Are you convinced of the Eucharist? 
 You can risk it all so the secrets kept, amen 
 Elegy readily telling elegant melodies 
 Yeah my energy is inner chi hell is my enemy 
 Entities of inner peace appease the devil that entered me 
 Men are seen as menacing but they end up in entropy 
 Yeah I'd let it be but I'm trapped with the centipedes 
 Bees in the trap claptrap rap's the revelry 
 They're wrapped in plaster plastered rapt by rapture 
 Cast in castor oil and cast beneath the casket soil 
 Into a mass grave that's what the mass crave 
 And not amass like a vast weight 
 Or a mast like a flag-state 
 More like a mass where they stand with their hands raised 
 That I pass with a masse 
 I don't care what the masks say 
 They all plastic passive and passé 
 Surpass past when I Plath pain, that's the campaign 
 Show me how all the martyrs did 
 Poke me now I don't want to live 
 Broke my crown on the stars 
 Holy vows a mirage 
 No that man's not my father 
 Hold me down underwater 
 Show me how all the martyrs did 
 Poke me now I don't want to live 
 Broke my crown on the stars 
 Holy vows a mirage 
 No that man's not my father 
 Hold me down underwater
