(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 My head aches, and feels the blunt vice grips 
 Hanging over my tequila sunrises 
 Confide and write this to de-scribe a love life 
 That's feeling love lifeless 
 I'm the type that'll cherish frozen winters 
 Stare at snowy blizzards and take it to heart 
 Then break it apart, I carry hopes and blisters 
 Cutting heart strings with a pair of broken scissors 
 I'm still trapped in a middle school slow dance 
 Stepping on toes in a mistletoe romance 
 Misanthrope, discomposed who holds hands 
 With grief... Kissing hope with no chance, but me 
 I'm just searching for some beautiful 
 A dream that I can catch And a person who's unusual 
 When I find her, I'll try to face the tide 
 Fight the hurricane, and tidal wave, goodbye... 
 And I watch all the spectrums of angels 
 Choking to death on the septums and halos 
 Bread crumbs and fables, why change? 
 I hang at the ends of the pay phone 
 With no change or number to reach 
 What blankets the sky I slumber beneath 
 Under the speech, this song's about hope, joy, love and defeat 
 All it takes is a peaceful autumn day 
 For you to be happy and me to call it fate 
 Even after a fucked up childhood, I'm still tryin' 
 To believe in God and grace 
 I try to get a piece of peace and sit and listen infinitely 
 Holdin' onto benefits, and isn't it so innocent? We 
 Try to find another time and underline the cynical 
 Its pitiful we run and hide and undermind the innermost 
 When intervals of miserable will find a figure four 
 And force the phyiscal and inner soul to find a bitter form 
 And form another time and place where you can go and be so suitable 
 When all I wanna do is go and search for something beautiful, in me 
 I died once, and I knew that it was suitable 
 I died twice, and I sang it like a musical 
 I died again when I thought that the noose would hold 
 Everything I love in the search for some beautiful (x2)
