Turn a blunt into a roach in a hundred feet of snow 
 Turn a blunt into a roach in a hundred feet of snow 
 They testify that the dead can rise 
 Pests and flies get the pesticides 
 I'm pessimistic pestilent since 
 The lightning bugs went electrified 
 Tried to run like insects in light 
 A nest that's tired unless it's tied to the 
 Hive mentality my finale seems dire 
 Why are we fine with the agony? 
 (And I know) I'm not storm chasing with wrong sails 
 (And I know) I got short patience for tall-tales 
 Ah hell it never rains, it's all hail 
 That's heavy rain on everything no heaven reigns yet all hail 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 I see fantasies of my own demise 
 Ants and fleas in my lonely nights 
 Maggots in my haggard skin 
 Mantises in Cody's eyes 
 In passages I co-designed 
 Abdomen thorax and head 
 Stab 'em with a tack or pin 
 Then resurrect me like Lazarus 
 Watch the locusts sink in my heart 
 Cockroaches think that they're gods 
 But the insects don't impress 
 I dissect their midsect 
 I find death in the sterile things 
 Bury me in kerosene 
 Get soaked in blood like a Carrie scene 
 Now open up for those roaches 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around 
 It's a nuclear winter 
 I see the roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around me 
 The roaches all around
