There's orange and yellow on the paintbrush 
 It's sort of mellow, but the same rush 
 I taste the ocean on my taste buds 
 But I can make a poem with the same tongue 
 O-range all around, Cobain stompin' ground 
 No rain's fallen down, old flames all 'a drown 
 I'm allowed a few low day fallin' outs 
 Mourning a man that my gold chain honors now 
 Mellow Yello's got the blues 
 I'm green with all this envy, cause this fellow got marooned 
 I've read all the white lies left in the twilight 
 Purrs-pulled from kitties who bellow at the moon 
 So I choose, to keep a tangerine with the tambourine 
 Apathy is absentee ballot when I crack a cheese 
 Smile, there's no masterpiece styled 
 In an afternoon, I have to use the Stanley Kubrik 
 There's no Full Metal Jacket 
 It's quite right enough to hide my own kettle's blackness 
 A low-level blacksmith, so orange it's clockwork 
 And there's no choice but onward 
 Yeah, he said whatever takes the weight off 
 Raindrops drive you crazy if they hit the same spot 
 So I go opposite of still 
 When I'm feeling blue until the opposites reveal that I'm orange 
 Although it's a dream 
 I made it up, but it's real 
 Although it's a dream 
 I want you to see, I want to believe 
 I wanted it 
 Although it's a dream 
 I made it up, but it's real 
 Although it's a dream 
 I want you to see, I want to believe 
 I wanna believe 
 There's orange and yellow in my eyelids 
 It's sort of mellow, but I like it 
 So bright and vibrant I might go blind 
 If I don't adjust to my climate 
 Mount Olympus, I'll climb it 
 No Sisyphus exists in my mindset 
 Mind set to detonate if 
 I step incorrect, expressin' my violets 
 Purple Haze and some Kurt Cobain 
 Got me doing flips like it's Cirque Soleil 
 Slow-motion at a turtle's pace 
 I'm so Punxsutawney Phil when I'm still in a recurrin' state 
 And each day is the same as the last one 
 Fatal attraction, waves to a captain 
 O-range turned grey from my atoms 
 And threw it to the skies above, April showers 
 Although it's a dream 
 I made it up, but it's real 
 Although it's a dream 
 I want you to see, I want to believe 
 I wanted it 
 Although it's a dream 
 I made it up, but it's real 
 Although it's a dream 
 I want you to see, I want to believe 
 I wanna believe
