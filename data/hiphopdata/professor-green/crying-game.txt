(Professor Green) 
 No religion, all I follow is my feet no psalms, 
 As far as holy water I would need a bath, 
 Even breathing stressing he didn't even ask, 
 So far passed stressed that I can't even see the 'r'? 
 His is as I am truly, high at times I'm ruly, 
 My minds screwed, and my moods blew as a lazuri 
 Add to that my heart isn't good I lie to these groupies 
 Like I like 'em I don't like 'em I just like to get the goodies 
 So disrespectful giving your chick a neck full, of salty water, 
 She sorta looks like she bit on a pretzle, 
 Skilled I'm passed that, I'm past them, 
 Got that lemon pass that, then you lucky if you see it passed back 
 (Mike Skinner) 
 Never trust a man with two phones, 
 You couldn't throw Pro Green like you'd throw two stones 
 And Pro Green knows, I'm in the gap in this market, 
 For the gafts and sharp wit, I laugh it off partly but, 
 Have to start to think, no parteners in this, 
 Just a part of the business, after the party is finished, 
 We part with a wish, Danny Dyer eating Paella, in that dire dwelling 
 So badly wanted out, one more try on the selling, 
 The 80's dream was the fate of our scheme, 
 Me, Ted Mayhem and team, In sport we were taught to be sporting, 
 But in law we were courting something, 
 But don't rate me in the 80's we were naughty in the noughties, 
 There's a parroty, now I see, that's between charity, 
 I beat you at your peak, I'll beat you on the beak, 
 Ask me anything, many men end here, 
 Many never made lengths, I'll tell you when your spent 
 (Now you care for me) 
 (Professor Green) 
 You see it Mike, they think I speak as nice but I don't believe the hype, 
 (Now you care for me) 
 Them man are idiots, there's no defeating us, soon they'll see that it's a *crying game* 
 (Professor Green) 
 I'm on jet fuel, them man are on fumes, dizzy, 
 I guess them man are on shrooms, 
 I'm as bad as an animal got loose 
 It's sticky in the manor 'cause man are a lot moves 
 Oh when your moving Mike, why you still moving why? 
 When they look at you like when you move, 
 Don't matter what you do with the mic, 
 But I spy the stakes even though they try to belie their hate, 
 They're not sly, they're blate I see a mate dreaming I'm wide awake, 
 If you really think you're wicked then bring it and die in shame, 
 See we can smile as winners for them it's a *crying game*
