Professor Green 
 A little birdy told me that I need to clean up 
 Remove the C, the L, the N and the A 
 Then put a D after the E and that's me, blud 
 How you mean, blud? 
 Sorry for complicating things, what I mean is I'm E'd up 
 Oh my god, Stephen, that's enough 
 Oh my lord, these are good 
 All I wanna hear now's Ebeneezer Goode 
 A little something to remind me of the 90s 
 Back when Es were good 
 I don't think I ever wanna leave the shubs 
 Professor Green 
 All I need now is somebody's daughter 
 Nothing could put me in a foul mood 
 Just lost 3 quid on a bottle of water 
 But I don't mind because I just found you 
 Whinnie Williams 
 I can't dance without you 
 You know, I never could 
 You always have this special way 
 Of making life feel good 
 I can't dance without you 
 Although I know I should 
 You always have this special way 
 Of making life feel good 
 Professor Green 
 I'm in a raving mood, wading through 
 The crowd while they're playing my favourite tune 
 Favourite tune? OK, I'm lying 
 I don't know the name of the song that I'm raving to 
 A raving loon, as long as I've got music 
 I'll be raving until I shave my gooch 
 I already saw the chick I wanna dance with 
 And I've been aiming when to make my move 
 Just when I went to move on it 
 A man popped up but I ain't too bothered 
 Because I make legs spread like the Bubonic plague 
 Come on babe, I know you want it, ay

 No pics or I'm posing a threat 
 Look at my boat, it's a mess 
 Although right now I'm in the zone and I'm bless 
 You can bet by Tuesday, I'll be an emotional wreck 
 All alone in my room with the lights out 
 Watching a rom com and crying my eyes out 
 Wondering why I bother with you 
 I wanna quit, it's just I can't dance without you

 Professor Green 
 If I'm being honest, I can't dance at all, init 
 I've got two left feet 
 I can sing though, trust me 
 No autotune needed 
 You always have this special way 
 Of making life feel- 
 Alright, maybe not
