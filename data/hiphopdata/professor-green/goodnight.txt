I kick flows, rip shows, think it switched though 
 Shit no, it ain't any different when I get home 
 I shift po to get dough, lust P's if you ain't ever been broke 
 For you to judge me's an insult, it's my life an I'm living it 
 Agreed we all have choices but mine limited mostly by my decisions 
 If I knew then what I knew now I'd a lived live different 
 I'd be a different me but I didn't so this is me 
 Me in my position, what would you have done 
 Would you of done what I did? Am I what you would become? 
 My guess, my guess is you would of succumb like I did 
 The decision was mine but I was too young 
 And I picked the wrong path, I went the wrong way 
 Left school then got the grade, banged it out, got my pape's 
 Stacked my P's, copped a cake, I'm holding weight now 
 Made a brick of a ounce and ain't been in the jailhouse 
 I intend on staying free, free for me don't mean free from stress 
 Lay in bed but I ain't asleep 
 From I need rest I just blaze the tree's 
 Drift off hearing my nan say to me 
 Goodnight, God bless 
 I'll see you in the morning 
 Goodnight, God bless 
 I'll see you in the morning 
 I'm a dreamer but can only dream as 
 Long as I'm asleep I've been having trouble sleeping 
 See nanny, Edie ain't here to say goodbye no more 
 I had to say goodbye to her, inside is where resides the hurt 
 Now all I feel is pain, after that nothingness 
 After that nothing since after that there's nothing left 
 Some of her last words were I can't fight forever 
 Like she wanted to give up and of life she was fed up 
 She had to go but I wanted her to stay 
 'Cause ever since she left, things haven't been the same 
 I need a new shelter from the rain 
 My face looking weathered, a facety looking bredder, I'm fed up 
 I know not what to do 
 See, I'd love to say that I don't give a fuck but I do 
 The gift and curse that I'm blessed with 
 The pressures on road ain't nothing to the emotions that I wrestle with 
 Stress got me in a figure four, raw is what I'm thinking 
 I wonder what I'm living for, is it only to hurt first my great nan? 
 Now I gotta put my dad in the dirt 
 Back in the earth, I wished we could have patched it up first 
 I was so angry though, I just couldn't handle the hurt 
 Now you're in the back of a hurse 
 It hurts more than it ever did 
 Sometimes I wish that I had never lived 
 Feels as if it would have been better if I never did, live 
 I don't know how I'm ever gonna get through this shit 
 I swear down blood, I'm runnin' on empty 
 My life ain't nothing to be envied, so goodnight
