I'm more than one person, lately two 
 I need someone to save me and save me too 
 A devil on my shoulder, an angel too 
 And I'm tryna figure out who I favour, who 
 Made me do the things you made me do? 
 Forever blaming you, I guess my favourite's you 
 The angel can take a pew for now, I'm cool for now 
 You ain't ever seen an adult so juvenile 
 Sicker than baby puke, dribbling days were cute 
 And I'm tryna take a lady who'll make me too 
 Though if you spill your drink on my shoes again 
 Darling, it's toys out of the pram, baby too 
 Getting a little waved and the club's getting boring 
 But I want to carry on till morning 
 Lady I'm bad, I should come with a warning 
 What's wrong with your engine? Done with the stalling, come on 
 I'm open to suggestion 
 Evolve without question 
 Won't be going to heaven 
 Without salvation or redemption 
 I need church 
 I need prayer 
 On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky 
 Wondering if anyone's there 
 I need church 
 I need church 
 On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky 
 Wondering if anyone's there, I need church 
 I know what I should and I should not do 
 But what I should do ain't always what I want to 
 If you're lucky, I'll let you have your wicked way with me 
 Come on baby, it would be rude not to 
 We were there chatting, it wasn't flirting, it was foreplay 
 She said she ain't really into music and hardly 
 Even listens to the top 40 
 Though she did say somebody should tell Danny O'Donoghue 
 To stick to the scripts, rap really isn't his forté 
 Um, Danny O'Donog-who-what? 
 I would rather listen to Rudebox 
 By Robbie Williams, that's a lie 
 I would rather not listen to either of these two knobs 
 Why don't we order a few shots? 
 Then in a few me and you hop 
 In a cab and go back to my flat 
 Where I can put you lots in my new tracks 
 Sex with me is safe baby, tamper-proof 
 And I'm a pro at pulling out, that's tamper-proof 
 I'm a mack and here's the proof, when she said her name was Honesty 
 I said I'm looking forward to tackling the truth 
 I'm open to suggestion 
 Evolve without question 
 Won't be going to heaven 
 Without salvation or redemption 
 Woke up in a bed next to a bird 
 And I hope I used protection 
 We all need a cure cause 
 We don't worry about prevention, I need church 
 I need church 
 I need church 
 On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky 
 Wondering if anyone's there, I need church 
 Hello, welcome to the voice mail of me 
 You should know who I am 
 If you're calling my phone 
 Please do leave me a voice mail because I don't check them 
 Please don't send me a text because then I have to have an excuse for not getting back to you 
 Bye 
 Green, it's Robbie Williams 
 I've just heard your album. I-I- listen. 
 A, keep my name out of your mouth 
 B, why did you have to go and mention Rudebox? 
 It was a pretty shitty time of my-- 
 And C, C is fuck you Green
