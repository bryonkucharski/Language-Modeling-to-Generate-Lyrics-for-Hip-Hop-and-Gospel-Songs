(Hello?) 
 Hello babe, what's happening, you cool? 
 (Ah yeah you all right? What's happening?) 
 Yeah I'm good, what's goin' on? 
 (Yeah, nothing er chillin') 
 All right, what you up to later? 
 (Oh yeah about that, um, dya know what I'm really busy can I call you back?) 
 This ain't so stereotypical man, not for a stereotypical man, It should be me that wants to get rid of you instead it's you that don't give a damn (what?) It was meant to be a one night 'ting, nothing more than a little one night fling, now when I'm in need you're the one I ring I (I need you tonight) 
 But she's playing hard to get, brunette with such class she's hard to forget, see at first I wasn't after her heart but I couldn't stop thinking about her after I left. I'm beginning to lose my cool, it appears in love I have fallen (whoops!) I'm ready to put my all in and all she does is ignore my calls! 
 She's everything I want, but all that I don't need 
 How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me 
 How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right 
 I wish I never, but I need you tonight! 
 This lady is driving me crazy, she blows hot and cold like the AC. I just can't figure her out next time I'm with her I'm pinning her down (Oi) I'm gonna' find out if she's on it or not (not, not) 'cause all of this shit is long (long, long) See I front like I'm okay but I'm not, I'm being played at my own game and it's long (long blud). I ain't no eidiot, I'm pro I'm no intermediate so next time she phones me I ain't even gonna pick up the phone to speak in it (ring) nope, swear down, (ring) wait a minute, that's her now... 
 (Hello?) 
 (I really wanna' see you today) 
 (All right, just give me a time and a place and I'm there) 
 She's everything I want, but all that I don't need 
 How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me 
 How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right 
 I wish I never, but I need you tonight! 
 I need you, I need you 
 I need you, I need you 
 I need you, I want you, 
 Won't stop until I've got you, 
 There's nothing that I won't do, 
 I need you tonight, 
 Look, I ain't never been the type to be this (no) I ain't never been the type to be with, she's exposing a side of me that, I'm tryna' fight, I'm tryna' hide! My pride, I'm tryna' find it, but ain't seen it I'm an edjit, I know I can't help it I'm fiending! 
 (I need you tonight) 
 She's everything I want, but all that I don't need 
 (I am... in a bad place) 
 How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me (this stuff don't happen to me, I'm me!) 
 How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right 
 I wish I never, but I need you tonight! 
 (Swear down, It's just a song, in real life this would never happen to me, I am a pimp, women chase me, I do not chase women) 
 I need you, I need you 
 (I swear down) 
 I need you, I need you tonight...
