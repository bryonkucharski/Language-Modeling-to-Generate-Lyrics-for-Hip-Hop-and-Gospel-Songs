Sing, shout 
 Scream 'til the words dry out 
 Put it in all of the papers 
 You can read all about it 
 Sing, shout 
 Scream 'til the words dry out 
 Put it in all of the papers 
 Read all about it 
 It's been a couple years since your eyes closed 
 I used to wanna know the answers, now I don't 
 I don't ever wanna be where you been 
 I already see enough of you and me 
 Fright, what if I'd grown up to be just like you 
 But isn't what, what all kids should aspire to 
 Even for all of of the shit I admired you 
 I could have drowned in a pillow while I cried to 
 All I ever wanted was a little time with you 
 But that's time I ain't ever gonna get now 
 How am I ever gonna get my head 'round this? 
 When I get down the whole world's great to me 
 There isn't anything that anyone can say to me 
 I couldn't care less what people make of me 
 What they never gave to me 
 They can never take from me 
 Sing, shout 
 Scream 'til the words dry out 
 Put it in all of the papers 
 You can read all about it 
 Sing, shout 
 Scream 'til the words dry out 
 Put it in all of the papers 
 Read all about it
