Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these 
 I'm as high as a eagle, I'm taller than the trees 
 And I can't turn back, I tell my heart relax 
 Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes 
 And suddenly everything is gone 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Reach up for the light 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Devil can't catch me tonight 
 I'm not afraid, and I'm not alone 
 Even if I'm dancing on my own 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 All I hear is music, I'm losing all control 
 I have no excuses, can't say I wasn't told 
 If the sky turns black, I'll tell my heart relax 
 Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes 
 And suddenly everything is gone 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Reach up for the light 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Devil can't catch me tonight 
 I'm not afraid, and I'm not alone 
 Even if I'm dancing on my own 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Feels like I finally finally found it 
 More than I, than I could have ever imagined 
 After all this waiting and this holding on 
 Suddenly everything was gone 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Reach up for the light 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted 
 Devil can't catch me tonight 
 I'm not afraid, and I'm not alone 
 Even if I'm dancing on my own 
 I'll be lifted, lifted, lifted
