Professor Green 
 I felt like I was going crazy 
 Thought I was losing my mind, I did 
 I even convinced myself it was all in my mind, all of this time 
 I think it's high time 
 That some truth comes of this lie I've lived 
 We've lived or we live together 
 At least we did when we were together 
 All of the things that we did together 
 Tainted, jaded 
 The first sign of temptation, you gave in 
 First heard when you tripped up, stumbled over 
 And did something that I'd never even contemplated 
 Stick your story, save it 
 Thought it was a mistake, were you sober 
 Or were you wasted? 
 Did you show him all of your little faces? 
 Mr Probz 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 Mr Probz 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 The amount of times you'd had me believe it 
 You were pulling the wool over my eyes 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 And now I'm starting to put all the pieces 
 Together in my mind, together in my mind 
 Professor Green 
 Did I ask too much of you? 
 Did I expect too much? 
 Could I have given you a little extra? 
 Would it have made you a little less of a strut? 
 And you walk wherever you walk 
 Dress barely holding on for the ride 
 Guess I knew we'd always end premature 
 I can't say it didn't come as a surprise 
 So tell me, was it good, was it? 
 Was it worth it? Did you work it? 
 Would you be as kind as to 
 Tell me what it was I did to you to deserve it? 
 Cause nah, I ain't perfect 
 But I ain't ever shown nobody where you sleep 
 Are you gonna have somebody in my bed? 
 Guess I better get new sheets 
 Mr Probz 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 The amount of times you'd had me believe it 
 You were pulling the wool over my eyes 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 And now I'm starting to put all the pieces 
 Together in my mind, together in my mind 
 Together in my mind 
 I found out that you've just been hiding the truth 
 Now it's yours, oh 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 If everyone knows 
 Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me? 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 The amount of times you'd had me believe it 
 You were pulling the wool over my eyes 
 Found out all your little secrets 
 Uncovered all your little lies 
 And now I'm starting to put all the pieces 
 Together in my mind, together in my mind
