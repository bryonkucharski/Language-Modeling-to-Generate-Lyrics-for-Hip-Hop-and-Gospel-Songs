Professor Green: 
 I want me a Vegas girl 
 I don't like the song but I'd love me a Vegas girl 
 How do I have the audacity to say this? 
 I'm a little bit of a sadist, girl 
 I say this, I say that 
 Whatever I say, I never take back 
 I've got no respect 
 Ask Dream Mclean and his enormous head 
 I ain't got the heart to care 
 Ask him how long he spends in the barbers' chair 
 I wouldn't wanna be your barber 
 Picture me on a sheep in a barber 
 I'm Green like a frog and I ribbet 
 No, I've not lost it, I'm just being silly 
 Really need an ump and I'm going on millie 
 I don't mean I'm going on Millie 
 How much longer could he go? 
 My mind can only be described as unhealthy 
 No, I wasn't made in Chelsea 
 I'm just living it up real tosh 
 James Craise: 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 Professor Green: 
 I've had an idea, who knows how 
 We can raise the national IQ? I do 
 Take every member of every reality TV show 
 For a little trip on a ship and then sink the boat 
 Thank God Millie quit the show, I'm unbiased 
 It's simple, Millie would've been on the ship too 
 A prick to anybody and everybody 
 There ain't a woman alive that I wouldn't be a dick to 
 But you came into my life 
 And now everything's so sweet 
 I found my perfect match in a woman 
 Who gives more hugs than me, Millie 
 Me and my bird are barmy 
 Two peas in a pod, edamame 
 Couldn't care less what the whole world thinks of me 
 As long as the in-laws think I'm charming, darling 
 James Craise: 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 Professor Green: 
 In a couple of years, I'll be speaking posh 
 "He ain't hood anymore, he's a tot" 
 Picture hearing me speaking in a posh accent 
 Like "come hither now, clean my cock"? 
 "What did you say, young man?" 
 "Is this the way young people behave nowadays, young man?" 
 That was when she hit me with her walking stick and said 
 "That ought to teach you for talking shit" 
 I don't even know who she was, this is what the weed does 
 Millie, I'm gonna be with you forever 
 Only till the day that we divorce and I get taken to the cleaners 
 Probably for getting caught fondling the clean-er 
 It's never gonna happen! 
 She's 68! 
 She has had four children! 
 It would be like throwing a hotdog down a hallway! 
 James Craise: 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 I wear them dead man's shoes 
 Professor Green: 
 I wear them, I wear them 
 Them dead man's shoes, I wear them 
 I wear them, I wear them 
 Them dead man's shoes, I wear them 
 Dead man's shoes, I wear them 
 Dead man's shoes, I wear them 
 I wear them, I wear them 
 Them dead man's shoes, I wear them
