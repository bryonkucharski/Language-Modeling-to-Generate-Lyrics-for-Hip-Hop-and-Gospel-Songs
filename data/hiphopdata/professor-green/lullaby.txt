Tori Kelly: 
 All the time I have laid in your lie 
 When your love kept me safe through the night 
 All the time I was sure you were mine 
 And before time demands our goodbye 
 Can you sing me a last lullaby? 
 Professor Green: 
 It's been a while since I last dreamt 
 Barely remember what it's like to dream 
 Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed 
 And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me 
 Pretend shit doesn't get to me 
 And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting 
 A man's problems are his own 
 And it's my burden 
 Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep 
 But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working 
 I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on 
 Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering 
 Sick of pretending to be so happy 
 All the while my anxiety's away at me 
 My skin crawling, I look up to the sky 
 And it falls, the walls close in and it's 
 As if all the good in my life disappears 
 In an instant, that thing is just so distant 
 So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me 
 But I don't wanna tell 'em how I feel in case they judge me 
 It's just me, wish I could let somebody in 
 But I ain't ever been too trusting 
 Tori Kelly: 
 All the time I have laid in your lie 
 When your love kept me safe through the night 
 All the time I was sure you were mine 
 And before time demands our goodbye 
 Can you sing me a last lullaby? 
 Professor Green: 
 I've barely had any sleep when I get up 
 Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors 
 Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better 
 Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak 
 It just makes my day harder, I wonder if 
 It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew 
 Could it have helped shape the way that I grew? 
 But the point of things I never have went from 
 Being a reason for the things that I do 
 To just being an excuse that I'd use 
 I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do 
 Find something other than negativity for my fuel 
 But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered 
 I hide everything that's going on inside 
 Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help 
 But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine 
 Tori Kelly: 
 All the time I have laid in your lie 
 When your love kept me safe through the night 
 All the time I was sure you were mine 
 And before time demands our goodbye 
 Can you sing me a last lullaby? 
 I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK 
 But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't 
 To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness 
 Is hard and depression is a slippery slope 
 I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though 
 So I carry on even though it's hard to 
 The only thing that's definite is death and things always change 
 As long as you give 'em a chance to 
 All the time I have laid in your lie 
 When your love kept me safe through the night 
 All the time I was sure you were mine 
 And before time demands our goodbye 
 Can you sing me a last lullaby? 
 (Can you sing me a last lullaby?) 
 All the time I have laid in your lie 
 When your love kept me safe through the night 
 All the time I was sure you were mine 
 And before time demands our goodbye 
 Where you sing me a last lullaby?
