Thabo 
 I gave you my everything, guess that didn't mean anything 
 To you, 'cause I'm not your man 
 All the nights I spent with you, not making love, just making do 
 Ooh, I'm not your man 
 I'm swimming way out of my depth 
 I'm in way over my head 
 I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed 
 I wish I could forget 
 Professor Green 
 What you take me for? What you take me for? Gave you everything 
 Yet you're still looking at me like I could've gave you more, gave you more? 
 I ain't got anything left to give, somebody better notify my next of kin 
 Cause the stress is killing me, either you're feeling me or not 
 Either way I ain't gonna be spending any more money on Tiffany 
 I'm done with that, what do you think I rap for? 
 To buy you a bag? Are you mad? I'm a catch 
 The type of man women normally go mad for 
 Sick of love, sick of you, wish I was but I ain't though 
 Changed like a boy in trance, anything you ask for 
 I can't say no, don't give but you take loads 
 The dinners and taxis, I ain't ever been attracted to anybody as much 
 I am in love with you so madly, ain't ever treated you badly 
 But no matter what I do, you're unhappy 
 Is it cause my dick isn't as big as Dappy's? 
 Thabo 
 I'm swimming way out of my depth 
 I'm in way over my head 
 I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed 
 I wish I could forget 
 Professor Green 
 Playing a game that I'm losing so I guess you're winning 
 I should've known better in the beginning 
 When you said you were a fan of Beyoncé 
 But the only song you didn't like was "Independent Women" 
 "Bills, Bills, Bills", bet you liked that though 
 Dough with a D, yeah you like that dough 
 Gave you a key to the crib only to find 
 You'd smoked all of my weed when I came home 
 A temptress, a seductress 
 Who possessed enough pizzazz to make me obsessed 
 When you undress you wanna compete, sorry I didn't know 
 It was a contest, but guess I won 
 'Cause I came first, is that the reason that you're upset? (?) 
 Why would you keep coming back if it's just sex if it ain't no good? 
 Or is it the rest that you're interested in? 
 All of the spending in the restaurants 
 I gave you everything that you ever wanted and what did I get in return for it? 
 Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, your shoes cost 
 More than I used to earn in a month back when I used to sleep on a futon 
 Thabo 
 I'm swimming way out of my depth 
 I'm in way over my head 
 I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed 
 I wish I could forget 
 I wish I could forget 
 Wish I could forget 
 I remember 
 Everything 
 I gave you my everything, guess that didn't mean anything 
 To you
