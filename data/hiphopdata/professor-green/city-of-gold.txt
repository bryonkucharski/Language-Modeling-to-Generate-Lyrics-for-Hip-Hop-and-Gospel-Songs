We ain't got no time, in the city of gold 
 Trying to get me some sunshine 
 An avoid the patrol 
 Ah yeah 
 I'm fed up 
 All I want is a little nice weather when I get 
 A lot of people arrive zealous 
 But life here's, less than a dream, more a nightmare 
 Welcome to the city of gold, the city I roam 
 Home to the grittiest roads 
 It's hardly a party, getting our p's 
 On the same corner where women sell narni 
 I live amongst vermin I'm stuck 
 But I couldn't give a, fuck as long as I'm earning 
 Long been accustomed to the ways of the manor 
 The filth are an occupational hazard 
 Parked chilling in a car park grinning 
 It's gone midnight an I'm half past sinning 
 Got a dark heart wicked with my ras clart lyrics 
 I'm a bad boy you don't wanna start no shit with 
 We ain't got no time 
 (No time on these streets, everybody's hungry and trying to eat) 
 In the city of gold (Everybody's out for their own, it's hot round 'ere even when your out in the cold) 
 Tryin' to get me some sunshine (It's hard to find peace here, never can you be easy, always gotta beware) 
 An avoid the patrol (But that's life in the inner city, up to bother trying not to get collared by the piggies) 
 Ah yeah 
 Time's precious 
 An it moves fast in a city full of bright lights and tight dresses 
 Medusa's that'll seduce ya if ya ain't ready 
 A city that makes few and breaks many 
 The city I'm in's, less like the city of gold 
 More like the city of sin 
 Where everybody's in it to win 
 From villainous nippers to city slickers with sinister grins 
 Straight, ain't religious, never been into hynms 
 An I pushed bars before I'd ever been in a gym 
 So for my freedom I keep hoping 
 'Cause I don't wanna walk through the doors these keys open 
 I don't know if you think it's nice or something? 
 But I can show you a different side to London 
 To think you came here for the treasure? 
 But nobody ever came here for the weather 
 We ain't got no time 
 (No time on these streets, everybody's hungry and trying to eat) 
 In the city of gold (Everybody's out for their own, it's hot round 'ere even when your out in the cold) 
 Tryin' to get me some sunshine (It's hard to find peace here, never can you be easy, always gotta beware) 
 An avoid the patrol (But that's life in the inner city, up to bother trying not to get collared by the piggies) 
 Ah yeah 
 Jack the lad I put the work in 
 For the wage of sin 
 Even if by some poor sod's loss 
 I care not I will take the win 
 Many came so full of hope 
 Only to be deflated 
 The roads we walk ain't paved in gold 
 Alone is how our days spent 
 Don't think 'cause I'm polite that I'm nice g 
 Or 'cause I'm well dressed I ain't grimy 
 I got food for them city heads 
 Just another aggie yout that the city bread 
 The cloud I'm under thunders loud 
 I ain't waiting for the day the sun comes out 
 If you wonder what I'm under now 
 The same shit I was and will be till I'm underground 
 We ain't got no time 
 (No time on these streets, everybody's hungry and trying to eat) 
 In the city of gold (Everybody's out for their own, it's hot round 'ere even when your out in the cold) 
 Tryin' to get me some sunshine (It's hard to find peace here, never can you be easy, always gotta beware) 
 An avoid the patrol (But that's life in the inner city, up to bother trying not to get collared by the piggies) 
 Ah yeah
