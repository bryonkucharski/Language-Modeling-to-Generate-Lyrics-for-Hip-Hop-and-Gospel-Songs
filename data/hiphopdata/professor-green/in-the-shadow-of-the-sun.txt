They say that life is always easier 
 After you let yourself come undone 
 They say they'll give you whatever you want 
 And they'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun 
 And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun 
 Seizing time where no one's been before 
 Close the curtains, what you waiting for? 
 And I'll be keeping secrets 
 Till I'm in the ground 
 Keep your past your own, I don't care about before 
 I don't wanna know your secrets, I wanna help you keep yours 
 No one needs to, no one'll ever know what we do 
 Where we go, why don't we go to a place where only we know? 
 Where we escape from real life and it feels good and it feels nice 
 That we ain't yet but we still might 
 'Cause we go with it if it feels right 
 And it feels... feels amazing 
 We ain't ready to see the day 
 And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun 
 Seizing time where no one's been before 
 Close the curtains, what you waiting for? 
 And I'll be keeping secrets 
 And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun 
 Seizing time where no one's been before 
 Close the curtains, what you waiting for? 
 And I'll be keeping secrets 
 Till I'm in the ground 
 Let go of fear 
 This can be a secret that we both keep, that we both share 
 Hidden behind the smiles we both wear 
 As the sun creeps through the curtains 
 On the walls we become two silhouettes 
 As we close our eyes 
 Let go of the lies that fill our heads 
 Let's light it up, live life in the moment 
 Why would we worry about where we might end up? 
 They can't see us, they can't judge us, it's just us 
 They might wonder but only know where we go when the sun comes up 
 I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the the sun 
 Where I belong, girl, there's something coming on 
 I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the the sun 
 Oh, and I need you 
 Chasing it, chasing it 
 I don't know what I'm chasing is 
 All I know is I've been craving it 
 Ever since I had a taste of it 
 Life is what you make of it 
 We're just here writing our own books 
 This is just a page of it 
 Before you wave your fingers at us 
 You better make sure your hands are clean 
 We all obey, our hands are tied 
 And I don't wanna have to leave 
 I don't wanna say goodbye 
 They say life is always easier when you come undone 
 When I go, you'll know where I've gone
