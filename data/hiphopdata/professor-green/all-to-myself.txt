When I was young, I never needed anyone 
 And making love was just for fun 
 Those days are gone 
 Living alone, I think of all the friends I've known 
 But when I dial the telephone 
 Nobody's home 
 All by myself, I don't want to be 
 All by myself... anymore 
 All by myself, I don't want to live 
 All by myself... anymore 
 Hard to be sure 
 Sometimes I feel so insecure 
 And love's so distant and obscure 
 Remains the cure 
 All by myself, I don't want to be 
 All by myself... anymore 
 All by myself, I don't want to live 
 All by myself anymore 
 All by myself, I don't want to be 
 All by myself... anymore 
 All by myself, I don't want to live 
 All by myself... Anymore...
