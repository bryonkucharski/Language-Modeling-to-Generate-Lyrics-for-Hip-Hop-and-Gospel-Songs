I just woke up next to this chick who I don't know 
 And I'll probably never see her again 
 I can't remember what I did last night 
 When behind the shades is the only place you can hide 
 And your waking thought is more often than not "where am I?" 
 Still pissed, and a half-empty bottle of liquor's 
 The only liquid you can find 
 Too busy to reminisce over a time when you have time 
 And all you wanna do is chill, baby hold onto 
 Something that you can feel 
 That ain't too much to ask for, is it? 
 When you no longer look like the you in your passport picture 
 All you wanna do is turn over and find her 
 Normally turn over and you find her 
 But this time I turned over and I found you 
 Though we might not get to know what this might amount to 
 I just woke up next to this chick who I don't know 
 And I'll probably never see her again 
 I can't remember what I did last night 
 Let alone last weekend 
 I'd always wanted to live the fast life 
 Till it started speeding up 
 Now I'm here living the fast life 
 Good luck keeping up 
 A life that went from canapés to classic champagne 
 Cocktails to cigarette butts and champagne flutes 
 Rolled up notes, a few lines of coke 
 One hell of a headache and two piles of clothes 
 Room full of smoke, eyes full of sleep 
 A plane I've gotta catch and a bed I don't wanna leave 
 I don't wanna leave you, I wanna wake you 
 But I should let you sleep through, you look so peaceful 
 Tiptoeing as I'm rushing to get my things together 
 Too many pieces of puzzles for me to piece together 
 Maybe I'll leave a letter, in the hope that 
 When she wakes, she remembers me and that we fell asleep together 
 But likely she remembered nothing 
 Woke up in a rush and huffing at how Stephen kept her knocking 
 Grabbed her things, didn't see the letter, let alone open it 
 Stepped over it on her way out and never even noticed it
