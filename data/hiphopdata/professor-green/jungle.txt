Jungle: 
 I see no point in living life that right, so I just take what I can find. 
 I see no point in living life that right, when your out here in this jungle. 
 It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere, troubles what you find round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle. 
 Your always caught in this struggle 
 I see no point in living life that right, so I just take what I can find. 
 I see no point in living life that right, when your out here in this jungle. 
 It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere, troubles what you find round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle. 
 Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle. 
 But you keep asking for trouble, you love? You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way. 
 Welcome to Hackney, a place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji. 
 A Manor where man are like animals, an' they'll yam on you like they yam on food. 
 Cats with claws that'll stab a yout', act bad an' catch a slap or two. 
 We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools. 
 London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters pray, Looking lunch today, and your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape. 
 They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do, so stick to breezing through, like cheeta's do or be a piece of food. 
 When your out here in this jungle. 
 It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere, troubles what you find round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle. 
 Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle. 
 But you keep asking for trouble, you love? You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way. 
 It's blitz amidst the strife here, got kids with sticks and knives here. 
 It's hype here, we know no different prick; it's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown. 
 Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road. 
 God CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large, it's hard, not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars. 
 Jealousy's what the cheddar brings, for the cheddar it's anything goes, low enough to rob newly weds for their wedding rings 
 Everyday is warring, never give a warning, violence is the only way you settle things, everyday is hating, money that I'm making, jealous 'cause I'm moving on to better things, everyday is fighting, rolling in the night now. All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard... 
 When your out here in this jungle. 
 It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere, troubles what you find round 'ere. 
 When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle. 
 Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle. 
 But you keep asking for trouble, you love? You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.
