I wanna sing, I wanna shout, 
 I wanna scream till the words dry out. 
 So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid, 
 They can read all about it, read all about it, oh 
 Nothing to hide 
 Stifle and smother 
 Suffered and cried 
 Strife made me tougher 
 Never mumbled or shy to, 
 The trouble, I'll rise above all 
 Expectations forget rep 
 Ain't never begged yet 
 When I wanted to get pence, hustle, 
 To be, I'm exactly what my neck says. 
 Saying I tried to cash in on my Dad's death, 
 I wanted to vent 'stead I said nothing at all. 
 After all you were never kin to me, 
 Family is something that you never been to me, 
 In fact making it harder for me to see my father 
 Was the only thing that you ever did for me. 
 I wanna sing, I wanna shout, 
 I wanna scream till the words dry out. 
 So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid, 
 They can read all about it, read all about it, oh. 
 As a kid I looked up to you, 
 Only thing was I never saw enough of you. 
 The last thing I said to you was I hated you, 
 I loved you and that's too late to say to you. 
 Just didn't know what to do or how to deal with it, 
 Even now deep down I still live it. 
 To think I used to blame me, 
 I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me. 
 I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride, 
 You never even got to see me rap, 
 I just wish you woulda reached out, 
 I wish you woulda been round when I been down. 
 I wish that you could see me now, 
 Wherever you are I really hope you find peace. 
 But know that if I ever have kids, 
 Unlike you I'll never let them be without me. 
 I wanna sing, I wanna shout, 
 I wanna scream till the words dry out. 
 So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid, 
 They can read all about it, read all about it, oh 
 I write songs I can't listen to 
 Everything I have, I give to you 
 In every one of these lines I sing to you. 
 My job's more like public service 
 My life just became yours to read and interpret. 
 If you heard it it'd come across a lot different at times 
 I throw fits when I read how they word things. 
 You see me smile 
 Now you're gonna have to see me hurtin' 
 Cause pretending everything is alright 
 When it ain't, really isn't working. 
 I wanna sing, I wanna shout, 
 I wanna scream till the words dry out. 
 So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid, 
 They can read all about it, read all about it, oh 
 I ain't censoring myself for nobody 
 I'm the only thing I can be, 
 All that is good, all that is bad, all that is, me. 
 I wanna sing, I wanna shout, 
 I wanna scream till the words dry out. 
 So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid, 
 They can read all about it, read all about it, oh
