Ah, mate 
 A wise man once said 
 Just as things start looking up 
 It all goes to shit again 
 Story of my fucking life 
 I'm growing up, growing up, growing up in public 
 Growing up, growing up, growing up in public 
 Growing up, growing up, growing up in public 
 Growing up, growing up, growing up in public 
 They told me to act my age 
 Maybe one day I'll act it 
 But for now I'm going backwards, yeah 
 Lacing up my shoes, buttoning my shirt 
 I don't know why I'm bothering, you can't polish a turd 
 Is my tie straight? 
 I did it and I did it all my way 
 I told you from the get-go 
 It was my way or the high way 
 And I weren't lying then 
 Ain't lying now, never been... lying down 
 It's nothing new to me, the press ain't ever been too nice 
 I ain't surprised, the headline was about the DUI 
 Think to yourself "what would I have done?" 
 Somebody popped my watch and then tried to run 
 We got in a tussle, all the while 
 I had no idea where my wife had gone, plus I'm poignant on 
 Whether he's got a gun or a knife on him 
 Not knowing if her life was in 
 Danger why I tried to hold on to the watch and fight the. 
 Then I heard her scream, so I'm guessing he bought more guys with him 
 Fuck the watch, my priority's Millie now 
 You think what I did was so silly now you've figured it out? 
 Worked out the reason for me getting into the whip 
 Not only is this dickhead who got me kicked 
 And gotten away with my watch, he's gone and gotten me in all of this shit 
 Shame I never caught up to him in the whip, eh? 
 OK, if I'm being logical, in hindsight then probably, it is not a shame that I didn't catch up to the little toerag in the car because that could've ended with me in more trouble than I already am.
