I'm from America 'cause it's number one 
 I could take a fuckin' dump and it would look like where you're from 
 Bad men flew a jet into 9/11 
 In the greatest fuckin' country... 
 This ain't your country! 
 So many people ask "Why did you take Iraq?" 
 I'll tell you why right fuckin' now... 
 (I'll tell you right now) 
 So that every time you fuck with us, 
 We'll take some 'yer fuckin' stuff 
 So tell your homies I said 
 That all your countries have AIDS 
 Fuck you (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit) 
 Suck my balls 
 When freedom calls, it's calling collect 
 And I'll tell the operator "Yes, I accept" 
 'Cause these colors match the fuckin' carpet and drapes, 
 Let's play some fuckin' games! 
 -- 
 "At 9:11 this morning, we were given a message 
 And that message is that them folks in Iraq must not want their country very much" 
 -- 
 Yeehaw! 
 Blacks, Whites, Arabs, Jews 
 Living side by side 
 In this country, if you know another like it, you're a fag 
 Arabs mad 'cause imaginary man up in the sky told you to 
 Strap a bomb and blow yourself to shit 
 We'll take your fuckin' oil and make you suck our balls 
 And we'll rape your seven wives in the tits 
 (Bitch your pussy smells like hummus!) 
 'Cause baby, certain Muslims hate the things we love 
 Like bacon covered chicken fried steak 
 And all them suckers have AIDS 
 Fuck 'em (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit) 
 Suck my balls 
 In this game we're playing for keeps 
 So all you faggots better keep your receipts 
 'Cause it'll be a cold day in Pakistan if you think 
 You'll fuck with Toby Queef! 
 Remember when they hit them towers? 
 Man, that shit pissed me off for hours 
 So if them punks want fuckin' trouble 
 Better tell 'em they better go fuck with Mexico instead!

 "We will catch the folks who did this, sodomize them and get 'em in Guantanamo, and make 'em watch episodes of Glee." 
 -- 
 You faggot motherfuckers have AIDS 
 Fuck you (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit) 
 Suck my balls 
 When freedom calls, it's calling collect 
 And I'll tell the operator "Yes, I accept" 
 'Cause these colors match the fuckin' carpet and drapes, 
 Let's play some fuckin' games!

 "Now, I'm not sayin' everyone on the plane WAS a terrorist... but... 
 Statistics show. 
 Hell, most of the people on that plane probably had somewhere else to go. 
 But we ain't never gonna know now, will we? 
 Now, I'm-a tell you plain simple, you knock down our buildings, we'll take a couple yer countries. 
 You can tell Mr. Bin Laden and his army of 70 virgins we can play games, God dammit!"
