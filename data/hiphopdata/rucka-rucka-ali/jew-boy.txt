Yeah 
 They call me MC Meshugana 
 Niggas walk up with some pork and I'm killin' 'em 
 This is my street 
 Up in Flatbush in Brooklyn 
 Seymour Schwartz 
 I'm a certified attorney 
 Look me up 
 I'm also a doctor 
 Drink vodka on Hanukkah 
 Me and my Schwartzes run from helicopters 
 I'm the most lactose intolerant 
 Gimme some cheese with my meat and I'm gonna fart 
 I'm about five-foot-two with my shoes on 
 Turn on the TV just to see what Jew is on 
 Chinese food, I need to get me some coupons 
 I eat soup with lots of balls on my conference calls 
 All the stocks are falling 
 I lost my retirement 
 I pin on my yarmulke and go fight Sharpton 
 Bitch, I fuck more bitches than that Madoff boy 
 Rucka Rucka Ali, sing the fuckin' chorus, man 
 Jew boy 
 Posted outside, spinning your dreidel 
 Sippin' on some grape juice 
 Rocking that Jew gold 
 The world just don't understand you 
 They try to kill all of you 
 But no one can sue y'all 
 Too bad, 'cause you got, all the money 
 Catch me in my neighborhood temple where I pray 
 God, please, let me sell some diamonds on eBay 
 Usually I'm hungry, but now I need some money 
 So God, please give me couple bagels and a twenty 
 Twenty bagels with lots of cream cheese on the top 
 Gimme couple shots of Manischewitz on the rocks 
 It hits the spot 
 They should have never had Hitler done the Holocaust 
 Yo, I'm in the bakery 
 How much does that challah cost? 
 All across the trailer park, people hate Jews 
 I would too, if my father was my grandfather too 
 Fuck you 
 I hate you, you anti-Semite son of a bitch 
 If not for Jews, blue jeans wouldn't even exist 
 We invented lipstick and the atom bomb 
 So Lebanon could kiss they ass goodbye when we're bombing 'em 
 Please God, let there be peace in the Middle-East for once 
 And please let Iran bomb all these mothafuckas

 Third verse could be worse than the first couple 
 It could put you to sleep 
 Or it could be controversial 
 Shoot us! 
 I'm tired of all you so-called Jewish MC's 
 You're dumb as shit 
 Choosin' hip-hop over [?] 
 Suck my schmickle! 
 Fuck you bitches badder than Mel Gibson fucks shit when he's wasted 
 Or Louie's on stage, blamin' Jews for the slave trade 
 I hate you 
 I'll probably get killed for sayin' all this by the same guys that killed Malcolm X 
 But I don't give a shit 
 I won't throw my people down the steps like you faygolas 
 Can't we all be friends? 
 Jews and blacks are so much the same 
 We both been oppressed 
 We both got crazy mothers 
 And we're scared of them 
 We both like chicken 
 We both got weapons 
 Jews got Jewish guilt, blacks got handguns 
 Manischewitz got you actin' a meshugana 
 Everybody have a happy fuckin' Rosh Hashanavah

 Eh, looks like we 'bout at the end of the song over here 
 This song wasn't too bad 
 Eh, I've heard better 
 But look, you tried your best 
 It's OK 
 (?) 
 You know how much my bar mitzvah 
 Who sang this song in the first place? 
 Chase 
 ? 
 J-A-Y-S, am I right? 
 Chase, am I sayin' it right? 
 He's a good rapper 
 He likes college, that's good
