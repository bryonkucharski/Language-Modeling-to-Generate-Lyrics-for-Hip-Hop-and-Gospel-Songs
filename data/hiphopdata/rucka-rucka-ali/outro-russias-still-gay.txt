What's up, bitches? 
 This Rucka Rucka Ali 
 I'd like to talk to you about some of the things that people have been saying about me 
 Such as that I am racist 
 Or that what my music is, is hate speech 
 Video hosting sites shutting my shit down 
 News reports 
 (Http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/England/2698507.stm High school principal saying that my shit is "probably racist") 
 And today, I wanna talk to you, the victims, those who have been offended 
 Those who got made fun of in their school because they're a different color 
 Or that they're a different race 
 Or that their from some aspectual country where kids make fuckin' shoes, or... 
 Like one guy owns the whole fucking country 
 You know where you're from 
 I'd like to apologize 
 And announce that I'm retiring 
 No more music 
 No more parodies 
 No more full nude pictures of me 
 Nothing, I'm done! 
 So if I have offended you or hurt you in any way, 
 Please accept my apologies 
 Goodbye 
 Like hell, that's gonna happen! 
 You think I sat on my ass, and got this budget so I could quit? 
 FUCK that shit! 
 Do you know who the fuck I am?

 I got fans, in countries where bitches can't even drive! 
 Bitches can't drive in any country! 
 You sittin' there cryin'? "I got offended by it" 
 Yeah, well, fuck you! 
 I'm tired of your bullshit! 
 I just doin' my own fuckin' thing! 
 I just holdin' up a mirror to myself, and seein' a black ass MOTHERFUCKER! 
 "Oh, but what if my kids hear it?" 
 DAMN RIGHT, you kids gonna hear it! 
 I am trying to raise a generation of patriots!
