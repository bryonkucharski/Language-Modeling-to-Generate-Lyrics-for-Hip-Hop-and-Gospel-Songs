And so I ask you American people 
 To vote my ass president 
 Please 
 Thank you Dr. Carson 
 Mr. Trump, your turn to make a final statement 
 (Heh heh heh) 
 I was born in my own hospital 
 (A great hospital, the best you could imagine) 
 Delivered by the doctor that I bought 
 (And he thanked me 
 He said, "Donald thank you, this is terrific") 
 I bought at least a couple wifes 
 (3 highest paid women in America) 
 But the 3rd one doesn't speak English just right 
 (And she's great, I see her on holidays, terrific) 
 Now this country needs a good strong leader 
 I'm real busy but I may just have the time 
 If I let you elect the Trumpster 
 You're welcome 
 I'm a great leader and I can't read 
 We're being rapen by the Chinese 
 I'll make these China dogs my bitches 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 We need a hero that'll come help 
 I'll sell America to myself 
 I'll build yous highways and some bridges 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 I want to make this country great 
 (Right now we're NOT great) 
 But the Mexicans keep coming here to rape 
 (And by the way, at least rape in English) 
 I'll build a wall no one could climb 
 (No one will climb this wall) 
 And the spics could rape on their own fucking side 
 (Mexico is the new China) 
 Now I'm seeing people talk about Trumpster 
 Saying things that quite frankly aren't nice 
 When I'm in charge of our nuclear program 
 You're all bombed (and fired) 
 I'm a great leader and I can't read 
 We're being rapen by the Chinese 
 I'll make these China dogs my bitches 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 We need a hero that'll come help 
 I'll sell America to myself 
 I'll build yous highways and some bridges 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 We're losing, it's a catastrophe 
 I'll negotiate a better deal 
 I'll do a good job 
 We need a leader prez that'll get us out of our debt 
 Help the people get 
 Lower wig prices 
 We need a leader prez that'll get us rid of ISIS 
 Rip 'em all to shreds 
 Fucking towel heads 
 We need a leader prez that'll get us driving hybrids 
 Give us all some bread 
 With a side of Pez 
 And tell the Mexicans, and all the illegal migrants 
 You gotta get a license 
 I'm a great leader and I can't read 
 We're being rapen by the Chinese 
 (Rapen by the Chinese) 
 I'll make these China dogs my bitches 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 (I'm the filthy richest) 
 We need a hero that'll come help 
 I'll sell America to myself 
 (America to me) 
 I'll build yous highways and some bridges 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 And I just can't help all yous bitches 
 I'm the filthy richest 
 It's gonna be terrific 
 'Cause I'm the filthy richest
