 I go down to Jersey Shore 
 I meet some short Italian whore 
 Me and her like the same stuff 
 Gymtan and drycleaning store 
 She says "I'm 16 and pregnant" 
 We get abortion and some breakfast 
 She says, "Now I want divorce" 
 So I enter her butthole by force 
 Fist pump! With Guido wops 
 All their grandpas are in the mob 
 I fuck all the TV teen moms 
 And I toss their babies off a building

 I was raised in, the Asian part of Beijing 
 Now Snookies in my basement 
 No more Jersey Shore sensation 
 I told all, my friends in the police, that I smoke rocks 
 They said "That's all you had to say" 
 And we rolled out 
 To find some Mexicans at the border 
 We smoked their crack, and let them in California
