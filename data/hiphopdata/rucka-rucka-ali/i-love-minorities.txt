I think that every race 
 Is a-okay 
 We all have something to be proud of 
 ('Cept white people) 
 I like very country the same, 
 Even the ones where my own music's not allowed in 
 Or the ones that wanna bomb us! 
 Women are as smart as me and you 
 No! No! It's true! 
 They could be president of this country, 
 I mean who cares? 
 There's already a black! 
 I love minorities 
 Especially, people that get around in hweelchairss 
 That's hot! 
 I love everyone in the world! 
 Because no one is different than no one 
 Everyone is fuckin' like someone 
 And if you fell like I do, 
 Take your hand and touch my balls, 
 And sing along this fuckin' song! 
 Black people are good at playing basketball! 
 Asians cook Chinee food on woks 
 Mexicans are great at leaving Mexico! 
 So suck on my cock if you don't love everyone! 
 White people can tuck their shirts into their shorts! 
 They need Jews to fill their tax forms 
 Eskimos are best at hitting seals with clubs! 
 We could all learn from everyone lots of stuff 
 Sex, them Europeans 
 Do it with kids, 
 It's like their proud of it or something 
 It's legal in their countries 
 Canadians, at age fifteen 
 Can legally suck off dirty old man for money 
 No they can't! 
 OK, for free 
 That's right! 
 Everyone in the world's good 
 Because no one is better than someone else is 
 I'm down with women's circumcision 
 So if you feel like I do, 
 (You're a homo) 
 Take your ballsack and your bongo drum, 
 And sing this gay ass little song 
 Black people are good at stealing stereos! 
 They've got Jewish lawyers in court 
 Muslims are the best at flying into stuff 
 Not all Muslims, just most, and all it takes is most 
 Africans like lynching homosexuals 
 Cubans turn dildos into boats 
 Germans kidnap girls and make them prostitutes 
 Everyone's special in their own gay little way 
 Arab girls have got to be sweaty 
 They put to death if they show they tittie 
 That's baller shit, 
 I ain't even playin' 
 Lemme tell you what's the same about the 
 Swedish, Chassidish Jews, Kelly and Regis 
 They're all fuckin' crazy! 
 Except the Swedish, they're just lazy, 
 And love the penis 
 Yeah, those ladies in Sweden 
 Got enough VDs to turn those dudes around them gay 
 And Frenchmen don't believe in bathing 
 And Haitians love a good earthquake 
 Caging a Mongol? 
 Russian tradition 
 Rape in the Congo? 
 As long as it's women 
 Taking a dump on someone else's culture and making fun of them just 'cause they're different 
 And making a song calling their country stupid, mixing the absurd with the true? 
 Don't to it 
 So if you hate racist humour, 
 Get your pooper up, 
 And sing this fuckin' song! 
 Black people are good at wheelchair basketball 
 They got shot, 
 And now cannot walk 
 Pregnant girls are stupid and impossible 
 Everyone's good, 
 No one is better than someone 
 White people can show black people how to vote 
 Blacks could teach them Jews to dance good 
 Blind black men can't play hockey, 'cause they're black 
 Helen Keller can't drive because she's a woman 
 Gary Coleman's gone 
 It was so sad, 
 He was so young 
 I mean he was like fifty-one 
 But it's sad. 
 Because he looked like he was nine years old 
 Whatchu' talkin' about, Rucka? 
 His wife did it! 
 I love minorities
