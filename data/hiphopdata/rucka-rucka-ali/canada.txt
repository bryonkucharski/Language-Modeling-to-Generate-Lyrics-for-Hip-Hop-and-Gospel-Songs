Hello 
 This is a public service announcement from the Government of Canada 
 The Canada is what happens when you put French people in the woods 
 Ha ha 
 Canada 
 Is only there till they do something we don't like 
 I'd like to see them start a fight some day 
 We'd probably beat them to the ground by 6AM, eh 
 Across the bridge 
 Them lumberjacks are pulling syrup out of trees 
 They try to talk but all they know is French 
 Their claim to fame is being north of the US, yes 
 In Canada 
 The eskimos all seem to be frozen in time 
 And no one knows just who their leaders are 
 All of them hosers have a leaf for a flag, fa-a-a-ags 
 Canada 
 Is only there till they do something we don't like 
 I'd like to see them run their mouth at us one day 
 They'd probably be wiped off the map that very night, ni-i-i-ight 
 Yo it's cold 
 The royal police riding horses fighting crime 
 They funny hats and pants demand respect 
 Just break the law and you'll be fine if you can drive, dri-i-i-I've 
 I hate the queen 
 They ruined basketball with a Toronto team 
 They all statistically have smaller boobs 
 Gained independence from the queen in '82, 1982 
 Canada 
 Is kinda cold, a bomb could be kind of nice 
 They ruined bacon and they harvest ice 
 They hit baby seals and that ain't nice, not not not nice 
 Canada 
 Is only there till they do something we don't like 
 I'd like to see them start a fight some day 
 They're only there till they do something we don't like, li-i-i-ike 
 Homos 
 Seems like we should be telling them what to do 
 The metric system isn't very cool 
 Them park rangers wanna take care of a moose, moo-ooh-ooh-oose 
 Michael J. Fox 
 Your shaky ass ain't made a movie that I liked 
 Ok, I guess Back to the Future was okay 
 But Bryan Adams should have 
 But Bryan Adams should have 
 But Bryan should have stayed in 
 Canada 
 The eskimos all seem to be frozen in time 
 And no one knows just who their leaders are 
 All of them hosers have a leaf for a flag, fa-a-a-ags 
 Canada 
 Is kinda cold, a bomb could be kind of nice

 They're only there till they do something we don't like 
 They're only there till they do something we don't like
