I'm afraid downtown, 
 'Cause some people there are brown 
 And they all have guns, 
 They're like "Nigga, give me money!" 
 I'm white! 
 When the night comes, 
 They come outside 
 You might hit one with our car, 
 And yell 
 "Twenty points!" 
 They might rob your ass, 
 They might pop your ass 
 It all depends on if, 
 Your white or black 
 I'll be leaving a baseball game, 
 Might stop at the ATM 
 Someone says, "Excuse me sir, but can a cracker spare some change?" 
 And I pretend that I don't hear him 
 He says, "Please don't walk away! I need cash to buy some books and pencils" 
 I don't give a FUCK! 
 I'm afraid downtown, 
 'Cause some people there are brown 
 And they all have guns 
 They're like, "Nigga, give me money!" 
 I'm white 
 (I stay at home) 
 With my wife 
 (And kid and dog) 
 And I might drive by the hood, 
 And wave Hi to black people 
 I'm afraid to go, 
 See a game of basketball 
 It's a real dark sport, 
 And I don't mean on the court 
 I'm white 
 (I stay at home) 
 And I might 
 (Watch basketball) 
 On my 
 (Television) 
 But then my fuckin' dog would bark 
 And there was a time, 
 I wasn't scared of them, 
 Back then, I'd even, 
 Watch the Cosby Show 
 But then in an episode, 
 Theo stole his dad's car 
 I got scared and built a fence, 
 Around my back yard 
 I'll be sipping some light beer 
 I'll catch an episode of Scrubs 
 Maybe speaking with my kids, 
 Picking Jesus over drugs 
 And on the TV someone says, 
 "Send us money, we have AIDS" 
 Well I have AIDS, 
 And I don't give a, 
 I don't give a, 
 I don't give a FUCK! 
 I'm afraid downtown, 
 'Cause some people there are brown 
 And they all have guns, 
 They're like "Nigga, give me money!" 
 I'm white!

 But then my fuckin' dog would bark 
 Oh, no! 
 Someone stole, 
 All our stuff 
 (It was prolly black people!) 
 Oh, no! 
 Detroit, lost! 
 All we have is basketball! 
 Right now? 
 I stay at home! 
 Tomorrow? 
 I stay at home! 
 All my life? 
 I stay at home, 
 With my Bible! 
 Hanukkah? 
 I stay at home! 
 Ramadan? 
 I stay at home! 
 The white house,? 
 Can't go there 
 I'm afraid of black people! 
 I'm afraid downtown,
