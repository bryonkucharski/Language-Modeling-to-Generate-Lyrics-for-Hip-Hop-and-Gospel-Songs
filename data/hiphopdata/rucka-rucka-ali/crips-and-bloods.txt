Bloods and Crips, 
 Act like kids 
 They always fightin' each other, 
 And I don't like it 
 I see them hatin' on each other, and it's sad, bro 
 That's why I got a red shirt, and blue pants on 
 I wanna make nice, 
 Between Bloods and Crips 
 They could work out, 
 Through their tons of differences (See, I like red and you like blue) 
 They're the same thing, 
 But they fight in every state 
 Except Connecticut 
 But that's like the fucking whitest place 
 I never saw why, 
 Bloods don't get along with Crips (along with Crips) 
 They should be thinking about uniting 
 Let's be friends! (Yeah) 
 And I'll be wearing red kicks, with blue tube socks 
 Bloods and Crips, 
 Should all sit down, 
 And talk their problems out (There's pizza!) 
 Crips and Bloods get along (Crips and Bloods should get along) 
 Just drop the guns, 
 And play basketball 
 Put down the guns (it could be fun) 
 Crips and Bloods 
 All calm down 
 I mean, c'mon, what you fightin' for? 
 Let's go, come on 
 Put down the gun! 
 I really wanna, 
 Hear a Crip say "Y'all can wear red, and sling a couple bitches on my turf today" 
 I'd love to see you assholes agree 
 Bloods and Crips don't have to fight (Don't have to fight) 
 I would even say it to their face, 
 But then I would get shot (Oh yeah I so would get shot) 
 They would beat my ass up 
 Bloods and Crips would blast me, 
 If I tried to spread peace in the hood 
 But if that would unite them, 
 'Cause both of them don't like me 
 Wouldn't that be good, 
 Then maybe I should 
 Go in the city 
 And take a bullet 
 And win the Noble prize for peace, 
 I think I would at least win some bullshit hippie-shit prize 
 'Cause imma be the corpse to finally unite the- 
 Crips and Bloods get along (Crips and bloods should get along) 
 Just drop the guns 
 And play basketball 
 Put down the guns (it could be fun) 
 Crips and Bloods 
 All calm down 
 I mean, c'mon, what you fightin' for? 
 Let's go, come on 
 Put down the gun! 
 My name is Rucka Rucka Ali 
 And I'm some sort of cracker 
 Weird Al couldn't say half the shit that I said 
 You call me racist on Serchlite TV 
 Well, first of all, I think that I am Chinese 
 MC Serch's passed out 
 He blacked out, laughin' 
 Please stop askin' him why he co-signed my stupid ass 
 Jeez, lighten up, you sensitive pricks 
 Ayo, Paul Bakes yo girl has seen my dick 
 They pay me by the click, 
 So y'all can keep on talkin' mad shit 
 Spendin' hours trashin' my ass, while I cash in 
 Everyone goes "Yo, get out yo mama's attic" 
 You always stay at home too if folks wanted to blast you 
 I can do whatever I like 
 Whether I'm black or whether I'm white 
 I run red lights, It's an old habit 
 I smoke crack and I let babies play with matchsticks 
 Yo ladies stop yo antics 
 Don't make me smack a bitch 
 I blow up China, Filipino faggots Herro! 
 Get off the set of Home Alone, 
 Michael Jackson 
 Am I black? Or from Iraq? Or Alaskan? 
 I think my race is unknown, 
 So stop askin! 
 Crips and Bloods 
 Let's get along 
 Just drop the guns 
 And play basketball 
 Put down the guns 
 Crips and Bloods 
 All calm down 
 I mean, c'mon, what you fightin' for? 
 Let's go, come on 
 Put down the gun! 
 Crips and Bloods...
