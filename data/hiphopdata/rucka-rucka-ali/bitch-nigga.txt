I'm a unit 
 That means I got no dick 
 They cut if off 
 When I was young, 
 'Cause I was very sick 
 They're very mental 
 Thanks for fuckin' chess 
 Poppin' cherries in the schoolyard, 
 For the ultra sex 
 That shit was pretty sick 
 But it's all worth it in the end 
 To see you shit out brick 
 So fuckin' say something' 
 Go ahead and let me have it 
 By the end of the day, 
 Your still a bastard faggot! 
 Fuckin' hit it! 
 You call the rest of your clips 
 Rollin' faster than night 
 Still stuck in that Joe shit! 
 You fuckin' faggots! 
 You better sweat out piss 
 You fuck wit me, 
 Turn your light into a river of shit! 
 Rucka Rucka, to your motha, fucka! 
 Suck your momma's titties round, sucka! 
 The only bitch nigga that I seen in the room, 
 Is fuckin' you nigga 
 Is fuckin' you nigga 
 I capped your granny, 
 And ran her, 
 'Cause I couldn't stand her 
 I'm a bad man, 
 People ought' call me a bad name! 
 You ain't understand, 
 Why I cocked Michael Magnam 
 But I feel your kicks, 
 And your bitch, 
 So bitch, hand 'em! 
 You call the rest of your clips 
 Rollin' faster than night 
 Still stuck in that Joe shit! 
 You fuckin' faggots! 
 You better sweat out piss 
 You fuck wit me, 
 Turn your light into a river of shit! 
 Rucka Rucka, to your motha, fucka! 
 Suck your momma's titties round, sucka! 
 The only bitch nigga that I seen in the room, 
 Is fuckin' you nigga 
 Is fuckin' you nigga
