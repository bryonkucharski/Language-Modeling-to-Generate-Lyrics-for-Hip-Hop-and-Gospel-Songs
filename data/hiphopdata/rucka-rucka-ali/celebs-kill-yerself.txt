This is Seymour Schwartz reporting for WJOO 
 I'm outside the residence of Michael Jackson 
 All these meshuganas are throwing flowers at his house. 
 And what's the big deal? 
 He used to be a handsome black man 
 Now he looks like a holocaust survivor 
 Celebrities been dying everyday 
 I think it started with the death of Michael Jackson 
 Then that Charlie's Angel, 
 Than Billy Mays 
 He's in all those commercials, 
 His sales have doubled since he died, 
 I'd like to offer some advice 
 You washed up celebs, 
 You'll have your comeback when you die 
 That's why I'm thinking... 
 Celebrities, 
 Should commit suicide, yeah! 
 Take your own life, 
 You'll be a legend just like Biggie, 
 Or his buddy, 2Pac, man 
 Biggie, and 2Pac are, 
 The Patrick Swayzes of hip-hop 
 You should just blow your head off, 
 Like Kurt Cobain, 
 Or that guy, JFK, 
 They shot his ass in the face 
 My autopsy's, 
 Sceduled for next Friday 
 Look at the slaes 
 We selling Bernie Mac 
 Hi, kids 
 My name is Michael 
 Never had a childhood 
 (Cookies) 
 Too busy working 
 I could sing like I found Jesus 
 Hey there, kids! 
 Have you seen my Penis? 
 Come here, blanket 
 Let me spank it 
 Without kids, we'd be extinct 
 I could buy anything, 
 I bought the Beatles 
 I need needles to put me to sleep 
 I'm home alone! 
 Oh no, I'm scared 
 Macaulay, come over and hold me 
 Here, come ride my ferris whee 
 Milk and cookies 
 (Cookies) 
 I have a chimp named Bubbles 
 He likes to cuddle, 
 And never says no 
 National Many Boy, 
 Love Asscociation 
 Said they are sad, 
 About the death of Michael Jackson 
 Now he's deader than disco 
 Most them pedophiles, 
 Just go and work for the UN 
 You should just blow your head off, 
 Like Kurt Cobain, 
 Or that guy MLK, 
 Killed by the white government 
 My autopsy's sceduled for next Friday 
 Look at the sales 
 We sellin' Patrick Swayze 
 Stephanie Tanner diappeared 
 And then she was like, 
 "Hey, I quit moking meth and no one cares" 
 That's why I'm thinkin'... 
 Celebrities, 
 Should commit suicide, yeah! 
 Take your own life 
 You'll be a legend just like Biggie 
 Or his buddy Tupac, man 
 Tupac and Biggy, 
 Are the Patrick Swayzes of hip-hop 
 You should just blow your head off, 
 Like Kurt Cobain, 
 Or that guy JFK, 
 They shot his ass in the head 
 My autopsy's, 
 Sceduled for next Friday 
 Look at the sales 
 We sellin' Bernie Mac 
 How rude!
