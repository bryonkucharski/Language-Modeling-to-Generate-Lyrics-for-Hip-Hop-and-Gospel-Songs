Dear Santa, 
 This yo little cousin, Rucka Rucka Ali 
 First, I wanted to tell you, what a good ass mo'fuckin' boy I been this year 
 I raised thirty-two dollars for Haiti, 
 And a buck-fifty to help BP 
 What? A nigga needs some skittles 
 Anyway, 
 For this year's Christmas, 
 All I ask you, 
 Is a pound of purple pot, 
 The ability to seduce any bitch, 
 And for my videos to stop gettin' deleted every motherfuckin' day 
 You give me the same bullshit every Christmas, 
 And some shit I did not ask for, and don't need to be here! 
 And for this year, 
 All I ask is for you to help a motherfuckin', 
 Brother out, for once 
 Ten seconds from you on the video blog, 
 Talkin' about, "yo quit deletin Rucka's shit" 
 Will come a long way with me, sir! 
 Fuck you! 
 I'm tired of your bullshit! 
 And don't not never ask me for nothin' again, 
 If you don't come through this mo'fuckin' time 
 Merry fuckin' Christmas, bitch nigga! 
 Fuck you! 
 Sincerely, 
 Rucka Rucka Motherfucka Ali 
 PS: Ain't no cookies out, ain't none for you, 
 So keep your black ass out my cupboard, this year 
 Peace!
