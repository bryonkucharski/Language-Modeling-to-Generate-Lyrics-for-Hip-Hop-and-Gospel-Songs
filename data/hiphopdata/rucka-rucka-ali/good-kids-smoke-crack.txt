 I make them good kids smoke 
 Good kids smoke (crack)

 You take the pipe (the pipe) 
 Torch it, and give it a little twirl 
 It get's you high (now try) 
 Try to stay out of jail 
 'Cause just one rock couldn't kill no one 
 I've smoked since I was two years old 
 If you smoke crack 
 You might one day be president

 You know my type 
 I'm a nice guy 
 Everybody likes me 
 White collar crimes 
 Killing white people nightly 
 I get high with twenty nine year olds 
 I mean, there's twenty of 'em playing outside nicely 
 I got the price of the crack 
 You might be surprised how it helps you relax 
 Well, I take it back 
 You'll be dancin' and askin' the crackers for cash when they pass 
 Now your mom's comin' at me for answers 
 "Why you smokin' crack with my grandson?" 
 I don't know 
 Why is the sky black? 
 I don't know 
 Why is this guy black? 
 Why do grandmas give me handjobs for crack?

 But I care 'bout your kids

 The FCC's gonna take all my money 
 'Cause I'm teachin' kids to smoke the crack 
 But I'm not the one making songs teaching little girls how to take it in the ass 
 So please go and buy my CD for your kids, 
 Even though I have a dirty mouth 
 'Cause when you were a kid, 
 You were probably lynching my people in the south
