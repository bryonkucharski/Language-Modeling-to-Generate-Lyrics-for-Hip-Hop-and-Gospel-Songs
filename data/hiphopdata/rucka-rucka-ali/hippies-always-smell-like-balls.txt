All hippies are dirty and ugly 
 They're all covered in fleas 
 We should hang 'em from trees 
 Round 'em up with me 
 Shoot 'em once in the knee 
 Drag 'em down the damn street 
 I got two under my... 
 Trucks! 
 I hate 'em! 
 (Rapper) 
 First of all, 
 Hippies always smell like balls 
 And they're all a bunch of 
 Tree huggin', 
 Dumb fuckin', 
 Butt fuckers 
 Run, hippie, run! 
 I got twenty one guns wit me 
 Come around town, 
 And your done if you fuck with me 
 Yeah, drum circle 
 Ching Chang Chong 
 ! 
 Get some goddamn balls, 
 In your goddamn song 
 Get a goddamn jerb 
 You're a goddamn bum 
 I get drunk on rum, 
 And kill hippies for fun 
 Now I'm a nice guy, 
 But hippies are gay 
 They're always gettin' high, 
 And spreadin' the AIDS 
 I'd love to find, 
 Some hippies in my yard, 
 Playin' their guitar 
 They're gettin' sprayed 
 So listen up, 
 Hippies, 
 Gettin' shot dead, 
 In the new green 
 Yeah, 
 My name is, 
 Toby Queef 
 I was sent here by Rucker Rucker Ali 
 Yawl hippies, 
 Please stay away from me 
 You'll be dead if I see you, 
 Hangin' 'round Tennessee 
 Better run hippie, 
 Eat your LSD 
 Tell your friends 'bout me 
 Yeah, I'm comin' with a... 
 GUNS! 
 I hate 'em!

 I have a farm, 
 With plenty of grain 
 But hippies could starve, 
 That's fine with me 
 God help you all 
 When I'm president 
 Yawl hippies will be slaves, 
 And probably dead 
 Suck on my balls, 
 Hippies 
 Get your ass fucked in the booty 
 Yeah, 
 Lick on my nuts, 
 If you please 
 Go read a book, 
 For vegan revolutionaries 
 All hippies are some vegan pussies 
 Eatin' dog feces, 
 Yous hould eat a little meat 
 Always pretending, 
 To like Bob Marley 
 He sucks a big D 
 You should grow a couple... 
 NUTS! 
 I hate 'em!

 Where were you September 12? 
 I was shootin' me some hippies, 
 Real good in the chest 
 If you don't like this darn Country, 
 You suyre as hell ain't Toby Queef 
 (Rapper - Toby Queef) 
 I'm a little bit of Country 
 With a little bit of fist in your mug, homie 
 I'm a female bangin', 
 Racar wagin' 
 Jesus save me 
 I got ne teeth! 
 I'm a Decent Man, 
 I just don't like, 
 Asshole hippies dancin' 
 Without no pants on 
 Reminds me of the first time I heard rap music. 
 I was like 
 "Did he say N*****? I like this guy! 
 Yawl hippies,
