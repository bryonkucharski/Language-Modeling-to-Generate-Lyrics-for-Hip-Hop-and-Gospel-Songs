Wanna know what makes Me mad? 
 People older than seventy 
 They're always like 
 "Eh... back in my day, 
 The year was 1903" 
 They say they know everything 
 But they can't do shit without your help 
 "You kids with your sort-sleeve shirts... 
 Eh... I just crapped myself..." 
 Old ass grandpas all sit outside 
 "Ah" 
 And bitch about how shit used 
 To cost a dime. 
 "It cost... uh..." 
 They run us over, 
 Why can't they drive? 
 "Well, back in my day, 
 Negroes gave us piggy-back 
 Rides" 
 I just don't like old people 
 'Cause they want everyone to 
 Wipe their butts 
 "Wait there's more!" 
 Old people are fucking dumb 
 They always want to you tell about 
 The war 
 "Back in the war, uphill both ways" 
 Old people won't never be quiet 
 Well, I guess they will when they die 
 Because they got Alzheimers and 
 Cancer. 
 "Well, at least I don't have alzheimers" 
 They drive those high-tech scooters 
 And they can't work cell-phones 
 Or computers 
 We gotta stand in line all day 
 At the self-checkout 
 Because they think its magic 
 Old ass white boys 
 Think that they're smart 
 "Huh... I invented the wheel... and fire... and farts" 
 They're all good Christians... 
 "'Cause I knew Christ" 
 They need him now, because... 
 "I'm deaf and blind" 
 Old people, get off the road! 
 Why don't y'all 
 Ever flush the toilet bowl 
 "Eh... how do I work this thing?" 
 And the Pope is as old as dirt 
 And he lets people 
 Touch young little boys 
 "Eh... guess who's got some candy?" 
 I don't like old geezers, they think that... 
 "Russian people did that 9/11 day..." 
 They spend their life on the porch smoking their pipe, 
 And calling everyone else lazy 
 You wanna know why I really hate them? 
 Because their gonna die soon, so I get attached, ya know? 
 Let's take Grandpa out on the boat one last time and drop him off 
 To swim off peacefully into the night 
 Here you go, Gramps. 
 Ah, Grandpa sure did love the ocean. 
 That's the way he would've wanted it. 
 Ya know? I can still hear his voice... 
 I sure am gonna miss that old faggot! 
 Fuck them old people ('cause they all) 
 Take a dump in their diapers 
 "There's my raisin bran!" 
 Old people like apple-sauce 
 And they all 
 Call coca-cola, soda pop 
 "Eh... don't drink too much soda pop" 
 Old people belong in a 
 Old age home 
 They're too old to live with u 
 "But I built this house!" 
 Old people are dumb as fuck 
 All their teeth fall out 
 When they chew apples 
 "Where they go?" 
 "Eh... what's with all these sports you play these days? 
 Ski... that's a sport 
 If not for the hill, they'd be standing still there 
 Uh... 
 All these channels you have on your television 
 Back in my day, the radio had two channels 
 On---and off.
