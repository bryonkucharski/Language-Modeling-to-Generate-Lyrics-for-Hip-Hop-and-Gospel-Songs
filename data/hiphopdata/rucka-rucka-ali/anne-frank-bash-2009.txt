Yo, listen up 
 Here's a story 
 About a little girl who lived in an attic 
 And all day and all night, 
 Them Nazi soldiers were lookin' for her 
 And she sang a little something like this 
 I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die 
 Yo, get the keys to the ride 
 Homie, we gotta fly 
 We gotta flee 
 Come on I, got me some rocks 
 I got some weed in my socks 
 Homie, we gettin' high 
 Yeah, 
 I gotta army lookin' for me 
 And this attic's gettin' too crowded for me 
 Gotta go get a bus outta Germany 
 Gotta rush, 'cause if them Nazis find me, 
 Then it's on to the train and off to the camp 
 And it's not the kind of camp where you wanna be 
 It's not the kind of camp with arts and crafts 
 It's the kind where they make soap outta me 
 This attic's gettin' too whack for me 
 All I got is a bucket to crap and pee 
 It sucks when you're stuck in the attic, B 
 Ain't even got cable on this TV 
 And my little laptop's got dial-up 
 How'm I s'posed to see "Two Girls, One Cup"? 
 And I can't make a call to order some grub 
 Ain't even got service on my Blackberry 
 Hitler, might as well give up 
 'Cause I ain't comin' down 
 And I ain't gonna be found 
 It's my Bat Mitzvah 
 We gonna get drunk, 
 And get this attic bumpin' down 
 Everybody sing it now! 
 I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die 
 Yo, get the keys to the ride 
 Homie, we gotta fly 
 We gotta flee 
 Come on I, got me some rocks 
 I got weed in my socks 
 Homie, we gettin' high 
 Hey, yo! 
 Why them Nazis waste their time on me? 
 I'mma tryn'a chill with my homie 
 It's fine, don't pay no dime 
 I'mma be just fine, but keep on tryna' find me 
 Kinda started, I liked this attic 
 It's not bad, 
 I ain't even mad 
 It's rad 
 I'mma have me a little party 
 Manichewitz, instead of Bacardi 
 And you're all invited 
 Bring your posse 
 You ain't gettin' carded 
 We all gonna get retarded 
 We gonna drink until we fart it 
 And we gonna order pizza 
 We gonna be hiring a DJ 
 We gonna sing "Hava Nagila" 
 We gonna be smoking our kilo 
 This ain't something you wanna miss, man 
 This gonna be a sweet Bat Mitzvah 
 We gonna be in the VIP 
 And we might even be throwing a bris 
 Bitch Ass Nazis ain't invited 
 They try to get in, don't bother 
 This party, it can be one of a kind 
 Anne Frank Bash, 2009! 
 I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die 
 Yo, get the keys to the ride 
 Homie, we gotta fly 
 We gotta flee 
 Come on I, got me some rocks 
 I got weed in my socks 
 Homie, we gettin' high 
 I'm in an attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet 
 I'm in an attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet 
 I'm in an attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet

 It's so sweet, it's so sweet 
 (Attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet) 
 (Attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet) 
 (Attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet) 
 (Attic, an attic 
 It's so sweet, it's so sweet)
