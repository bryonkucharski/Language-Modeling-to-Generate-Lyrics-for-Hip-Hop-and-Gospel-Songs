K? Aloha, 
 You can 
 Call me Alejandro Whereizwaldo 
 Three time Latino Grammy winner 
 Two time political prisoner, Peru 
 South of Texas (is a place that's) 
 Called Mexico (Called Mehico) 
 And it goes from California to Brazil (Hell yeah) 
 They like nachos (And wear ponchos) 
 And play bongos (And like tacos) 
 And all other types of food from Taco Bell (I like those quesidillas) 
 Life is nice, south of the border 
 But they go to Arizona (Arizona) 
 To fall asleep in the truck on the lawn (that I paid them to mow!) 
 The Mexicans, are just the same as normal people 
 They brought cocaine here from the rainforests, 
 That we stole from them (Give it back) 
 They all can read 
 They like to read, great works of literature, 
 Like Malcolm X and The Fountain Head 
 And Where Is Waldo? 
 Taquitos 
 Twenty seconds in the microwave, that's all 
 Spicy chicken, jalepeno, taquitos, 
 Makes the bitches and the hoes take off their clothes 
 Do the Samba, 
 Ay caramba! 
 Taquitos (with salantro) 
 Get your diarrhea all over your clothes 
 Jalepenos 
 Here's a napkin, 
 You can crap in 
 They were Mayans, 
 And then Mexicans 
 And then Latins 
 Then back to Mexicans 
 And their calendar, 
 Says that the world will end (in twenty-twelve) 
 So not to be racist, 
 But it makes sense, 
 That if they think the world will end, 
 That some of them, don't never pay their bills (How's that racist? They're not even black) 
 Thank you, drive through, here's your order 
 Would you like two more, for quarter? 
 No thanks, I'll just have a cup of water 
 And Oh, yeah, this is all to go 
 The Mexican's land was taken, 
 From them by the Gringos 
 If they'd been Indians, 
 They'd been given small pox and casinos 
 Nacho Libre, 
 Was kinda gay 
 I don't even like Jack Black 
 Well he's OK, 
 But overrated, That's just me though 
 Taquitos, 
 You can grab a couple extra for your bros 
 Let's take Sancho, 
 To the gun show 
 Taquitos, black people are the best at the basketball 
 Alejandro, Whereizwaldo 
 Javier 
 Now you can see, man, 
 Why I sing for revolucion in Argentina in Nicaragua, 
 And Puerto Rico 
 You know that thing, they put on trucks, to make them shits look brand new 
 Yeah, well that thing 
 It has a name. It is bondo 
 The Mexicans, are no different than other types of people 
 They like to sit, out on the porch 
 Instead of drugs, they sell oranges 
 They all can read 
 They like to read, great works of literature, 
 Like War and Peace, and Who Moved The Cheese?, 
 And Where Is Waldo? 
 Taquitos 
 Twenty seconds in the microwave, that's all 
 I'm a Gringo, let's play bingo 
 Taquitos, with salantro and some packets of hot sauce 
 Habenero, for dinnero 
 The Mexicans, are just the same as normal people 
 They brought cocaine here from the rainforests, 
 That we stole from them 
 They all can read 
 They like to read, great works of literature, 
 Like Malcolm X and The Fountain Head 
 And Where Is Waldo? 
 Taquitos
