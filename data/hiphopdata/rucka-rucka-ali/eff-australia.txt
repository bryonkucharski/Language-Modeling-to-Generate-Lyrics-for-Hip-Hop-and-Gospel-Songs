 They talk like, 
 Hello, G'Day, mate! 
 I'm so much smarter than people in the United States 
 Let's start a party 
 Throw some shrimp on the barbie 
 Oh, poppycock! Now I must use the potty! 
 Have we ever told you all about how me shite country got started 
 To help you understand why we're all half-retarded 
 We got dropped off, on a boat from England 
 See, we're a bunch of criminals 
 It's in our DNA, friend! 
 The black people here, are Aborigines 
 They didn't know they're black, till they got a 
 50 Cent 
 CD 
 We celebrate summertime sometime around February 
 We freed the Aborigines sometime around 2003 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 You know what it do 
 Everybody there fuck kangaroo 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 Stupid-ass country 
 Ladies there, shave not, down under 
 Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway, 
 Fuck Australia

 So, fuck Australia

 They got a neighbor, and his name is New Zealand 
 Nobody cares about them 
 They're Canadian 
 They got some Indians, Aboriginals 
 They live in tents, with no pants on 
 You can see their balls 
 I hope Steven falls, into a pile of stingrays 
 And he could take Dundee with him, 'cause that sucker be gay 
 But I guess it don't matter 'bout Australia's gay shit 
 When it's gettin' taken over by the fuckin' Asians! 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 You know what it do 
 Everybody there fuck kangaroo 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 Stupid-ass country 
 Ladies there, shave not, down under 
 Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway, 
 Fuck Australia

 So, fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia 
 I stay as far way as I could from you 
 'Cause them koalas will attack 
 Koala bears remote-controlled by Jews 
 And when I'm droppin' Huxtables at the pool 
 I got me a handfuls of Aussie conditioning shampoo 
 And I'm thinkin' 'bout skeetin' on Natalie, cover Kylie with goo 
 Nicole kidding me, sayin' that the carpet matches the drapes 
 And Mel Gibson dunno shit about punching fuckin' tricks in the taint! 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 You know what it do 
 (This racist song only shows how ignorant Americans are...) 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 You know what it do 
 (Whatever, man, at least Hitler ain't from Amurrica!) 
 Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway, 
 Fuck Australia

 They'll never know about this song, they're so far away 
 So, fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia 
 Fuck Australia
