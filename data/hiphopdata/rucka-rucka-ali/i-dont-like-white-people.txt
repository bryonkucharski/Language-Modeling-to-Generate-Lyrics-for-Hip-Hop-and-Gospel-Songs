We are going to exterminate white people 
 Because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to 
 We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet 
 To solve this problem 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 I just don't like white people (people) 
 The Bible says they're evil (evil) 
 If honkies wanna go 
 Let's get it on (Let's get it on) 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall) 
 Sippin' mochachinos (chinos) 
 Can't we all get along 
 Hell no 
 Hey yo, 
 Have you ever wondered why white men can't jump? 
 They too busy drivin' around on mopeds (gopeds) 
 Drivin' a damn Ford Focus 
 Sittin' in the crib with they kids playin' Go Fish! 
 Goldfish and golden retrievers 
 I can't believe these idiots still wear Reeboks 
 Reba get's these retard off 
 We should keep them locked up with some coffee 
 They love coffee 
 It's always coffee 
 They watch Oprah Winfrey often 
 They all mormons 
 They all call up Dr. Lora and ask her stuff 
 They play golf with suntan lotion 
 And they all gots they shirts tucked in 
 They all wear suspenders 
 And they got bowties under they chin 
 They cannot dress 
 They always stress 
 "I need my pills 'cause I'm depressed" 
 White girls always have fake breasts 
 Like the feedin saeline to they kids 
 They drive Hybrids 
 They listen to 
 Kiss 
 They get they movies from Netflix 
 They all so rich 
 I say we jock 'em 
 They got no rhythm but they square dance 
 Maybe crackers wouldn't suck at sports 
 Spend less time in the Strarbucks with quarts of coffee 
 Private plays that are gettin' gay with the Facebook page 
 I don't like white people on the real 
 Whites been gay, they wait for years 
 Why can't we find out where they live, 
 And bust through a window into they cribs? 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 I just don't like white people (people) 
 The Bible says they're evil (evil) 
 If honkies wanna go 
 Let's get it on (Let's get it on) 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall) 
 Sippin' mochachinos (chinos) 
 Can't we all get along 
 Hell no 
 Jesus, black 
 Ronald Regan, sold crack 
 Did we pay 'em? Fuck that 
 That nigga got jacked 
 Get the facts and ask them crackers for answers 
 Put some pants on and get a buss pass 
 We the ones they be always harassin' 
 They the ones we should all be blastin' 
 Up in Aspen 
 In a mansion 
 Can't dance 'cause they got no fashion 
 And these assholes at the bash brawl, they all so white we could call them Casper 
 I command for them bastard crackers 
 Hey Barack, can we blow up Alaska? 
 Could we roll up to the NASCAR with the ass on the lassos to catch all them assholes 
 Let me talk in a way you crackers could understand 
 Hello, there. I wear blue jean pants 
 I own three dogs and thirteen cats 
 I keep my children away from rap 
 I get all my clothes at the GAP 
 I've lived in a condo most my life 
 Every now and then, I beat my wife 
 Her name is Linda 
 My name is Tod 
 Have you seen my fishing rod? 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 I just don't like white people 
 The Bible says they're evil (evil) 
 If honkies wanna go 
 Let's get it on (Let's get it on) 
 Oh (Hey!) 
 They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall) 
 Sippin' mochachinos (chinos) 
 Can't we all get along 
 Hell no 
 Oh, he-he-hello 
 Wh-wh-what are you doing here? 
 You guys makin' a hip-hippity-hop song? 
 Cool, very cool 
 My children love that shit! 
 Oh, you know, I love hippity-hop 
 Hey! But can I get on this song? 
 I-I've always wanted to get on a hippity-hop song 
 But-But my wife... my wife she, she's afraid of black people 
 I-it's not that they're black 
 It's just the color of their skin that scares her 
 And, you know, it's like my father always used to say 
 "Don't hate the cracker, hate the race" 
 *Clap, clap* 
 Guys? Wh-wh-why are the lights off? 
 I-I can't see you...'Cause you're black 
 *Punching sounds* 
 UGH! 
 AWW! 
 OH! 
 OH! 
 OH! 
 Oh, my-my head! 
 Do I taste blood? 
 That really stings! 
 I've never been stabbed before! 
 W-w-what's that?

 *Cocking Gun* 
 Oh, yeah, definitley is
