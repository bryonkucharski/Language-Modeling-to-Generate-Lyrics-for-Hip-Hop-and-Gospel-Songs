The year is 1997. 
 The world is a much different place. 
 The war between man and machine has begun. 
 Skynet began the war by dropping a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union, 
 Followed by the remainder of Europe 
 And finally, New Jersey 
 Ninety-five percent of the humans were killed in the battle, as well as some hippies 
 Only one man can save the human race from certain extinction, 
 And doom 
 That man is a noble, generous, and caring individual, 
 Also known as "Rucka Rucka Ali"
