Yo, man. 
 Yo. 
 Open up, man. 
 What do you want, man? 
 My girl just caught me. 
 You let her catch you? 
 I don't know how I let this happen. 
 With who? 
 The girl next door, you know? 
 Man... 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Say it wasn't you. 
 Alright... 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this, we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget that I had 
 Given her an extra key? 
 All this time, she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 How you fi grant the woman access to your villa 
 Trespass and a witness while you up in a your pillow 
 You better watch your back before she turn into a killer 
 Best review the situation that you're caught up inna 
 To be a true player, you fi know how fi play 
 If she say a night, convince her, say a day 
 Never admit to a word what she say 
 And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way" 
 But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me) 
 Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me) 
 She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me) 
 She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me) 
 Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me) 
 Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me) 
 She stayed until it was over 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this, we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 I had tried to keep her from what 
 She was about to see 
 Why should she believe me when 
 I told her it wasn't me? 
 Make sure knows she nuh she really on a right fi vex 
 A never you she see a make the gigolo flex 
 A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex 
 Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs 
 You know she a go bring up all of the things up from the past 
 All the little evidence you better know fi mask 
 Quick pon your answer, know how fi talk 
 But if she back a gun, you know you better run fast 
 But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me) 
 Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me) 
 She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me) 
 She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me) 
 Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me) 
 Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me) 
 She stayed until it was over 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this, we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget that I had 
 Given her an extra key? 
 All this time, she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused 
 I've been listenin' to your reason, it makes no sense at all 
 We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused 
 You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost 
 'Cause I say 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door

 Banging on the bathroom floor
