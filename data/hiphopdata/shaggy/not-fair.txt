Boy what have you done for me 
 I've been going down on you 
 You not going down on me 
 Girl that's just how rude boys play 
 I don't have to take you there 
 I can please you in other ways 
 Across the hall neighbors hear the sound 
 Squeak Mr. lover lover in town 
 Carpet burns from being on the ground 
 Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan 
 Crash oh dawn the phone 
 Baby don't stop yeah you like that Simone 
 Champion lover the best pound for pound 
 Take you to the clouds without going downtown 
 Why why don't you just change your ways 
 Won't you open up your mind 
 Boy we're living in modern days 
 Girl I'm coming from the school 
 Where if you want the job done right 
 You have to used the proper tool 
 You never been love until you've been filled 
 Filled full of pleasure from a rude boy 's skill 
 Passion and ecstasy you know the drill 
 Full up your cup till your juice's spill 
 Leave the door open just for the thrill 
 Now we're at the point where you can't keep still 
 Covered in sweat but feeling the chill 
 That's the effect of a lover man's pill 
 Tell me why you want to tease me baby (Oh yeah) 
 Don't you want to please me (baby) 
 Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind (repeat) 
 Across the hall neighbors hear the sound 
 Squeak Mr. lover lover in town 
 Carpet burns from being on the ground 
 Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan 
 Crash oh dawn the phone 
 Baby don't stop yeah you like that Simone 
 Champion lover the best pound for pound 
 Take you to the clouds without going downtown
