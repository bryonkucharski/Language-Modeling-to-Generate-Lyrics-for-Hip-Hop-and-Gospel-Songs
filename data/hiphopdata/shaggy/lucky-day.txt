Lucky Day 
 Straight up right ya know 
 Laydeeees 
 HaHaHaHaah 
 I love ya tho 
 If your man ain't takin' care of ya girl don't worry 
 I'm exactly whatcha lookin' for 
 1-800 Mr. Lovah 
 Dig dat 
 Shaaaaggy 
 Are you looking for a man to make you lose control? 
 A man who when you need a friend will fill that roll 
 Be a life blanket when you're feeling cool 
 Girlfriend this is your lucky day 
 They don't call me Mr. Lover 'cause I like ice cream 
 I am Mr. Lover 'cause I fulfill dreams 
 When last your man made you moan and scream? 
 Girlfriend this is your lucky day 
 Well, who's gonna take the heat? 
 A lot of fellows ___________ show indeed 
 But have you ever wondered why a woman will cheat 
 It takes a real man to make a woman complete 
 Fellahs out dere acting like their on speed 
 But slower can be better if you wanna succeed 
 Listen to your woman and ask what she need 
 Sometimes it can be better if you follow her lead 
 You have a man 
 ___________ That he's known 
 So if he's all of that 
 Then why are you on my phone? 
 Could it be that deep down you're feeling all alone 
 Something's telling me things aren't really great at home 
 You say you got a man 
 Well let's see what that means 
 Let's see, he pays your bills, he buys your stuff, you keep him clean 
 What does he tell you stuff to make you feel like a queen? 
 It takes more than money girl to feel like a queen 
 Love making should be fun 
 The lady should be satisfied before you're up and done 
 Ladies if your man is one who love to jump the gun 
 Let him go and call me later 
 Let a real lover show you how it's done girl
