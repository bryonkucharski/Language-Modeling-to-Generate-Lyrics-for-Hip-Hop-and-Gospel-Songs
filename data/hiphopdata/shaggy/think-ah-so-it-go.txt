Blessing again to all mi DJ friend 
 Have a mek dem know you understand 
 Hard work and dedication 
 You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard 
 Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record 
 While some people a relex a dem yard 
 Si down and a draw bad card 
 Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan 
 Have to try and elevate we young musicians 
 This is something a got to tell to everyone 
 So make we move as one 
 Wey we a do weh we try 
 Beg you listen to the Shags 
 Sit down and reminisce when me a DJ session 
 When promoter all a rob me and the singer Rayvon 
 Can't find taxi fare fi reach a Flatbush bottom 
 To beat the system me have to strong 
 Full of determination 
 Make dem know so that the DJ have to hit number 1 
 Through the grace of the almighty 
 The gift to write a song 
 My dream turn to reality when the Grammy touch me hand bim 
 No mek me settle down and pause fe a secound 
 Sting International, Robert Livingston, Gibraltor, Paul O Rossi 
 And the Ruff Entry Gang 
 Hot cold and freezing down a Long Island 
 They say many are called but the chosen is few 
 Know why is it you want to disrespect the crew 
 And you don't like fe se another DJ go through 
 I remember whem dem a express them negative views 
 And a name me as the DJ most likely to lose 
 When dem si down and give me bad album review 
 Se me a foreign DJ can't make hit tune 
 When me hit number one them find a bag of excuse 
 Se me management a mafia and me color get me through 
 Now me hit them like a puzzle mek them can't find a clue 
 And through the big broad smile I and I man see through 
 I remember when I man all a bleach a session 
 I remember when I man have no dollars in mi hand 
 I remember when I man all a fight fi Uncle Sam 
 I remember when I man all a face sentance 
 I remember all the DJ wey a chat mike fi long 
 Them time the dance use to ram and gunshot done session 
 When the DJ dem fight over the same mike stand 
 Red Foxx, Screey Dan Knight Rider, James Bond, Marshall One 
 And Corpral Tan, Mikey Slim, and Megga Man, Sleepy Wonder, 
 Floydie Wonder, GT, Pac Man, Mikey Jarrett, K-C Jockey and Bubbo 
 General, Sami Levy, Mr.Eazy Trevour Sparks, Rayvon 
 Can't forget Lloydy Stiff, Shinehead and Sluggy Rand dem de DJ a 
 The DJ who a de New York veteran
