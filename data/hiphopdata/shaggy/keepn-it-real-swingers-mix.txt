When I was young I used to dream of being rich 
 Having lots of houses and cars couldn't know which one was which 
 And finding me a chick and getting hitched 
 Living the fairytale life perfect without a glitch 
 You'd think that this would bring me happiness 
 If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest 
 But sometimes having more is really less 
 Take a look inside yourself you'll realize you're really blessed 
 No matter how you're sad and blue 
 There's always someone that has it worse than you 
 Sometimes you gotta pay you dues 
 Don't worry just push on through 
 Keeping it real 
 Gotta big up all my people who be working on a future 
 Though they know they gotta struggle 
 Keeping it real 
 To all my hommes working on the 9 to 5 
 And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble 
 Keeping it real 
 Although sometimes I know it seems impossible 
 They're ain't no need for drowning in you sorrow 
 Keeping it real 
 If things are as bad as they can be 
 You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow 
 I never got to have myself the house the mansion and the Benz 
 I'm not the kinda brother who be making mad ends 
 I got myself a girl but we be kicking it as friends 
 It's not enough but maybe that depends, again 
 Not everything you want is everything you really need 
 The standard of society's motivated by greed 
 Are you prepared to follow tell me are you prepared to lead 
 So persevere and you'll succeed 
 All the harsh realities appear to come in twos and threes 
 Don't worry cause there'll be a better day 
 One thing I can promise you just keep on keeping on 
 I swear to you there' gonna be a brighter day
