Sometimes I wonder what the future holds 
 From the way it looks it's like we don't have much control 
 Better comfortations the only other day 
 Never tought that we would end up living life this way 
 All we need is love 
 All we need is love 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 If there is hope there it should be love 
 We don't need anger we're stronger togheter 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 We can do better yes each one of us 
 My sisters and brothers love is the answer 
 What about the children think about their needs 
 We can make a different if we only just belived 
 No it won't be easey still it works we try 
 It's a revolution and it starts with you and i 
 All we need is love 
 All we need is love 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 If there is hope there it should be love 
 We don't need anger we're stronger togheter 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 We can do better yes each one of us 
 My sisters and brothers love is the answer 
 But all we need is love 
 Heey all we need is love 
 All we need is love 
 All we need is love 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 If there is hope there it should be love 
 We don't need anger we're stronger togheter 
 Where there is life there should be love 
 We can do better yes each one of us
