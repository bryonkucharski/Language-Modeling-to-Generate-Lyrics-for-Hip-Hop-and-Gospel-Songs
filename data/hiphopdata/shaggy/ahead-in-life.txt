Shaggy: 
 Uh it wasn't me... 
 Woman calling Shaggy: 
 I bet it wasn't it was your third leg, in between the other two 
 Shaggy: 
 All right Woody, you and me we neeed to have a talk 
 Cause your always gettin' me in trouble right now this, this ain't funny 
 Verse 1: Shaggy 
 Why is it you always gotta be standin up 
 Or rub a dub, you're like what's up 
 Have woman kissin' on your head and stuff 
 Why is it you never ever seem to have enough 
 Why can't you ever go to bed and just chill? 
 Actin' all ill, showin off your skill 
 Always tryin' to make me go against my will 
 Why is it you always up in someone's grill 
 Background Singers: 
 That playboy shit you did yesterday 
 Won't you know I got busted anyway 
 You went home and didn't feel her cat 
 What kind of dumb shit is that? 
 Chorus: Shaggy 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 Verse 2: Shaggy 
 Why you always gotta be the one to take the lead 
 You wanna plant a seed, good thing I wore a shield 
 You think without a brain you seem to like can't even read 
 So why you think you have the right to tell me what I need 
 Now I'm tryin' to talk to you you hold your head in shame 
 You sorry that you came, you think this is a game 
 It seems to me that I'm the one that's always bein framed 
 Cause everything you do guess who's the one to get the blame 
 Background Singers: 
 That playboy shit you did yesterday 
 Won't you know I got busted anyway 
 You went home and didn't feel her cat 
 What kind of dumb shit is that? 
 Chorus: Shaggy 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 Bridge: Woman calling Shaggy 
 You banged my friend, you pissed me off, you banged my friend, you boned 
 All fuzzy, cheap punk, hello... hello... you make me sick 
 Chorus: Shaggy 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh 
 All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life 
 To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, ooh
