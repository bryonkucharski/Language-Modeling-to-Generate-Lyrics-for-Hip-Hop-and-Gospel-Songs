First of all, I man praise the father 
 Proceed the order, who can hear feel it harder 
 Brave enough fi creep cross we border 
 Bail out fi Lord, a mercy when we ketch you pan we corna 
 We won't retaliate unless provoked 
 No need to question loyalty 'cause I defend my folks 
 I won't allow my friends to be the butt of all your jokes 
 You try pass, a this reggae pass gets revoked 
 So me know dem cah hold weh 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 Dem cah control weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 No par wid, no phoney 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 That's why dem cah hold weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 Mi neva say, nuff a dem try fi reel me, dem way beneath me 
 Still yah and dem still cah believe me 
 See say dat the business it need me, music it feed me 
 Cah have the followers a lead me 
 You notice how we live, I set the trends 
 Dem how you tink we get dem sexy gal yah pan we ends 
 We live by certain standard, certain rules we neva bend 
 A death before dishonor dat a we a defend 
 So me know dem cah hold weh 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 Dem cah control weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 No par wid, no phoney 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 That's why dem cah hold weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 Real rude boy, don't need to the order 
 Live by they code and have faith in di fada 
 Protect we ends and defend we border 
 God alone mi trust and him a new life partner 
 Neva put you trust ina no gal you was order 
 Next ting you end up on a tape recorder 
 Rub extra time, chew, you stab up du wardna 
 Stress tek you now thin dung and muaga 
 So me know dem cah hold weh 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 Dem cah control weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 No par wid, no phoney 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 That's why dem cah hold weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 So me know dem cah hold weh 
 Through thick and thruw thin nah stop till we win 
 Dem cah control weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end 
 No par wid, no phoney 
 Through thick and through thin nah stop till we win 
 That's why dem cah hold weh 
 All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end
