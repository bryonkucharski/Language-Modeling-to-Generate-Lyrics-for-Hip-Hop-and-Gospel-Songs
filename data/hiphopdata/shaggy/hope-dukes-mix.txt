I remember wasn't so long ago 
 We had a one-room shack and the living was low 
 And mama by herself, raised me and my bro. 
 Wasn't easy but she did it with the little that flowed 
 Worked hard got us off to school everyday 
 Keep our eyes on the star though the skies were gray 
 Gave us drive to survive really showed us the way 
 Now I really understand what she was trying to say 
 She said son there'll be times when the tides are high 
 And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
 Just never give up,(you can never give up) (repeat) 
 In this life you can lead if you only believe 
 In order to achieve what you need 
 You can never give up,(you can never give up) (repeat) 
 CHO: 
 And it's hope that keeps me holding on 
 It's just hope that makes me carry on (repeat) 
 Home grown couldn't have made it alone 
 I got a wonderful life, two kids of my own 
 With a strong foundation that was carved in stone 
 Thank my mother for the love that made my house a home 
 Makes me wonder sometimes if it was meant to be 
 All this for a humble little guy like me 
 All ever really wanted was a family 
 Teach my kids the same values that she gave to me 
 Hook And Chorus 
 We nah turn no stepper, things a go better 
 Never let yourself be overcome by pressure 
 Cool yah me bredda, have faith instead a 
 Sid-dung and a watch and all a fight one another 
 Blaze like fire, nah go retire 
 God nah sleep and a him inspire 
 We fi reach higher a that him require 
 Haffi mek we mark before the time expire 
 Chorus (repeat)
