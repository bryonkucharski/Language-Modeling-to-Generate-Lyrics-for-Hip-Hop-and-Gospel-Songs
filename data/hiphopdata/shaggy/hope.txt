I remember, wasn't so long ago 
 We had a one room shack and the livin' was low 
 And my mama by herself raised me and my bro 
 Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go 
 Worked hard, got us up for school every day 
 And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray 
 Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way 
 Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say 
 She said, "Son there'll be times when the tides are high 
 And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
 Just never give up 
 You can never give up," uh-uh 
 In this life you could lead if you only believe 
 And in order to achieve what you need 
 You can never give up 
 You can never give up 
 And this hope 
 That keep me holding on 
 On and on 
 And this hope 
 That makes me carry on 
 On and on 
 Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone 
 I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own 
 With a strong foundation that was carved in stone 
 And my mama for the love that made my house a home 
 Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be 
 All this for a humble little guy like me 
 And all I ever really wanted was a family 
 To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me 
 She said, 'Son there'll be times when the tides are high 
 And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
 Just never give up 
 You can never give up,' uh-uh 
 In this life you could lead if you only believe 
 And in order to achieve what you need 
 You can never give up 
 You can never give up 
 And this hope 
 That keep me holding on 
 And on 
 And this hope 
 That makes me carry on 
 On and on 
 We nah turn no stepper, things a go better 
 Never let yourself be overcome by pressure 
 Cool yah me bredda, have faith instead a 
 Sid-dung and a watch and all a fight one another 
 Blaze like fire, we nah go retire 
 God nah sleep and a within him we inspire 
 We have to reach higher for what we require 
 We have to make our mark before the time expire 
 And this hope 
 That keep me holding on 
 And on 
 And this hope 
 That makes me carry on 
 On and on 
 And this hope 
 That keep me holding on 
 And on 
 And this hope 
 That makes me carry on 
 On and on 
 There's hope, yeah 
 Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh 
 Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh 
 And it strikes an iron, uh 
 Hope keeps it alive, yeah, yeah 
 Hope keeps it alive, yeah 
 Only the strong survive, yeah 
 Keep it carry on, keep it carry on, yeah 
 Uh-uh 
 I'll keep it carry on, yeah 
 I gotta carry on, gotta carry on and be strong 
 Uh-uh-uh 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh 
 And this hope 
 That keep me holding on 
 And on 
 And this hope 
 That makes me carry on 
 On and on
