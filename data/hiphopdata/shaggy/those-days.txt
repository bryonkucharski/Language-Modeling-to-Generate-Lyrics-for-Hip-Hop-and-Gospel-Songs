(Feat. Na'sha) 
 Long time she want me change my ways 
 Knew as me a bad from back in the days 
 Those were the days my friend 
 We thought they'd never end 
 Thought we would last forever and a day 
 I took one look in his eyes and fell for all his lies 
 So why do I want this man to stay? Yeah, yeah (uh! uh! (Shaggy) 
 Wooky, wooky, when me give Angelina 
 Make she curl up, I throw them and scream 
 Feel me loving make them gal them reveal 
 Everything in them heart that them feel 
 Good loving when the woman receives 
 Sake them ehat she wants she can't leave 
 Ragga, ragga, me no pet gal feel real 
 Make them know me no romp when we a do it 
 Gal, you're hot and it shows 
 From the hair style to the pedicure toes 
 Gal, mesmerize from the lyrical flows 
 We habe the argument to con her out of she clothes 
 She knows that bavk in the days pon the ends 
 Situation used to make the wise girl tense 
 That's when she hear about me and her girlsfriends 
 Me never romp to swtich them up on every weekends

 Sherly can't do it like a me, wooky, wooky

 Man, I see you walk and all I notish your tush 
 You're well, Brazilian up on all walks of your bush, come on 
 You leave a lasting impression in my mind 
 Top shelf material, your dress well divine 
 Man, them all a look for you if you put on di whine

 We thought they'd never end 
 Thought we would last forever and a day 
 I took one look in his eyes and fell for all his lies
