Lumidee an mr. lover again 
 No girls no, ana hol ya tyt, 
 Straight till tha morning light 
 Sweetness to your delight

 Me yano I love the chase, rude boy upon ya case 
 Up an leave tha mamy with tha body an tha pretty face 
 The lumidee 'n' mr lover again 
 The lumidee 'n' mr lover again 
 Sittin' in the park watching winter turn to spring 
 (Well everytin feel so nice, gurl me wa ya2no yano ya spice up mi life) 
 Walking in the park watching lovers' do their thing

 This time I feel like makin' dreams come true 
 When ya talk to me speaking in your sexy tone 
 (Jus tha tone of mi voice, why ya bin so difficult, am the only choice) 
 When ya holdin' me I don't want ya to let go 
 (Yano ya feel mi heart rate, poundin 'n' poundin straight up an agot the shakes) 
 This time I feel like makin' love with you 
 This time I feel like makin' dreams come true 
 So here wi go pretty baby, gimme ya love, love, love 
 All night till tha mornin sweet love, love, love 
 When ya catch me in tha tub a rub, dub, dub 
 Inseprable, addictive like a drug, drug, drug 
 Ya want me life ina giv ya 'n' mi heart and mi soul 
 Love till eternally, mi ultimate goal 
 Cha, forever ina ma life to have 'n' to hold 
 No together you 'n' me can make some late night stroll 
 This time I feel like makin' love with you 
 This time I feel like makin' dreams come true
