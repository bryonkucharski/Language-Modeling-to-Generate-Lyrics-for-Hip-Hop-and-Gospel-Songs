Intro: Shaggy 
 Ultimatum, badman nuh tek ultimatum, go wey, yuh haffi stay 
 Chorus: Natasha Wilkins 
 If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play 
 Can you promise me that you will never stray 
 Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay 
 But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show 
 You have lost the best thing that you ever known 
 Guess you have to learn to make it on your own 
 Let me know stay or go 
 Verse 1: Shaggy 
 Before you go let's analyze the situation 
 I'm a typical Jamaican why you layin your frustration on me 
 When we met it was a perfect combination 
 But you know my reputation don't know what you were expecting from me 
 Fight back, you canfight get things a go if yuh nuh like that 
 'Cause I know that when you leavin' you come right back 
 Your new founded termination sounds to me like desperation 
 There's no ground for termination 
 Chorus: Natasha Wilkins 
 If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play 
 Can you promise me that you will never stray 
 Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay 
 But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show 
 You have lost the best thing that you ever known 
 Guess you have to learn to make it on your own 
 Let me know stay or go 
 Verse 2: Shaggy 
 I must admit I have a weakness for these women 
 Who a plot like them a villain try the best to separate you from me 
 I don't understand just why the hell your cussin 
 When you knew that she meant nothin' so what if she was your cousin 
 You say fight back, how the hell could I resist when she's dressed like that 
 Tell the truth I had to leave but she came right back 
 Now you heard the explanation taken to concideration it was sexual frustration 
 Chorus: Natasha Wilkins 
 If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play 
 Can you promise me that you will never stray 
 Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay 
 But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show 
 You have lost the best thing that you ever known 
 Guess you have to learn to make it on your own 
 Let me know stay or go
