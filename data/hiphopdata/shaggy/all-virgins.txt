I don't believe that virginity is as common as it used to be 
 Some of them a worth leave the nights 
 Gal a stick out pon a my night

 The gal fit lack of traffic 
 Man them burn cloche and try don't get her stick 
 Just like a cherry every man trying fi pick 
 The man a fly belt buckle and a try down-zip 
 Watch it 
 All virgins put upon your hand 
 All virgins grap up your gram

 Man them want fi see them long john 
 Gal she deh ya and the gal true commander 
 True she command, that no mean she a one 
 Wine pon the gal if the gal at divan
