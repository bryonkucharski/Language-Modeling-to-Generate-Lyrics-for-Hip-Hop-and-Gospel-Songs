Now this one goes out to the father 
 For shower of good blessings 
 Right now I gotta give thanks 
 And praise most I 
 Ky-mani 
 Thank you Lord for what you've done for me 
 Shaggy 
 To the Father I say 
 Ky-mani 
 Thank you Lord for what you're doing now 
 Shaggy 
 I go down on my knees and pray 
 Ky-mani 
 Thank you Lord for every little thing yeah 
 Thank you Lord for now you made me see 
 Sing along, sing along 
 Shaggy 
 Now when I look back in the days of all the sweat and 
 All the dues I paid 
 I go down on my knees and pray 
 And give thanks to the Father for the blessings that he shined on me 
 I sing a little song of praise 
 Though I know that everybody ain't as fortunate as I may be 
 One more time I say 
 Words cannot express appreciation what he's done for me 
 Right now I say thank you Lord 
 Shaggy 
 When I look back at all the things that the Father has done for me 
 I give thanks to the Lord and everyday I'm on my knee 
 Write the song now to please 
 No matter the color nor the creed 
 It was invested in me I'm here to do a good deed hey 
 I try to put a smile on your face 
 I write a simple song so it appeals to your taste 
 I tried to do the things that people appreciate 
 Well thanks for the music that they all embrace 
 And I say thank you Lord 
 Ky-mani 
 Say I'm in no competion 
 But I have made my decision 
 You can keep your opinion 
 I am just a calling on the wise man communion 
 Shaggy 
 I thank the Lord once again for the power of the pen 
 Yes I be making ends to feed my family and my friends 
 Push out my Benz check your lens 
 Beg you ease up off my fence 
 Mi afi push out my mother in the latest gems 
 I have to put the food upon mi table 
 Have to feed the little mouth them in my stable 
 Hail up to the Big Yard label 
 And me say thank you Massa God that I am able 
 Give thanks to the Lord 
 Ky-mani 
 Said I want to thank you 
 Shaggy want to thank you now
