A man got to do what a man got to do 
 You know a man got to do what he got to do 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Been here too long 
 And a lady like you got to be by my side at all times 
 Say a man got to do what a man got to do 
 I got a dream baby and I got to follow my dream 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Been here too long 
 Check out 
 I pack my suitcase this morning I'm ready to move 
 I finally got that courage I'm leaving soon 
 I left a note on my pillow expressing my views 
 Want you to be the first to gather the news 
 Can't deal with them tears 
 It's making me blue 
 God knows I care as much as you do 
 And to be honest my baby I'm worried 'bout you 
 Girl I'm worried 'bout you 
 I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone 
 And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find 
 My way back home 
 I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone 
 And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find 
 My way back home 
 You got me moving, got me grooving 
 Is it between you or my gold 
 I got my vibe and my pride keep my focus all on my stride 
 Need support and understanding are you with me 
 All the way 
 Need to know that you are there so I can make it 
 Through my days 
 I wanna be somebody 
 I wanna make people happy 
 And baby don't you worry 
 I'll be on my say I say girl
