Yo, I like crazy hangover, yo 
 I think you put some'n in my drink 
 Listen gal, me nah ina nah freaky stuff 
 Me nah make no old woman come trip me up 
 Look, you send a naked woman and feel me up 
 Buy me drinks all night and booze me up 
 She take three shots and it nah loose her up 
 Say Shaggy drink 'cause a me boots are up 
 Every time she go sip she tipsy up 
 Bartender go slip and switch the cup 
 Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal 
 Feel like you put something in me drink, gal 
 'Cause you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal 
 And I can't remember last night 
 I ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with my woman's best friend 
 Again I can't blame intoxication 
 Ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with a girl I considered a friend 
 I can't blame intoxication 
 Gal, a bounce pon me bed like trampoline 
 And a shake up me hip like tambourine 
 And a dive pon the pool like submarine 
 Whips and shakes, eh gal, how that come in? 
 Gal a had me pon the bed and a tie me up 
 Position ina saddle and ride it up 
 Too much of one thing, gal, we glide you up 
 She just slip on me lap and slide it up 
 Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal 
 Feel like you put something in me drink, gal 
 Now you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal 
 And I can't remember last night 
 I ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with my woman's best friend 
 Again I can't blame intoxication 
 Ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with a girl I considered a friend 
 I can't blame intoxication 
 Baby mother pon the phone say she coming early 
 Flight lands at nine, now I eight thirty 
 How me ever explain 'bout her friend Shirley 
 Lipstick pon me pants and me shirt dirty 
 While popping adieus when the sun comes up 
 Wife in on my bed, all cozy up 
 Couldn't drink and drive so me sober up 
 Never want kill nobody pon the road, come up 
 Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal 
 Feel like you put something in me drink, gal 
 'Cause you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal 
 And I can't remember last night 
 I ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with my woman's best friend 
 Again I can't blame intoxication 
 Ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with a girl I considered a friend 
 I can't blame intoxication 
 I ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with my woman's best friend 
 Again I can't blame intoxication 
 Ain't never gonna drink again 
 Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when 
 I had sex with a girl I considered a friend 
 I can't blame intoxication 
 Can't blame intoxication 
 I can't blame intoxication
