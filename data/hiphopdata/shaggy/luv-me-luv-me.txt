 Sweet, succulent and fine 
 A twinkling eye on my darling divine 
 I love the way you move and all the way you're designed 
 Your only lines are my mind, forget the corny line 
 Now let me hit you off now with this question sign 
 You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine 
 A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine 
 Well, I will hit you off now with this lyrical rhyme 
 Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin' 
 Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing 
 Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin' 
 Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing, sing girl 
 (Chorus: Janet (Shaggy)) 
 Ooh boy, I love you so

 (Luv me, luv me, luv me sex machine) 
 Ooh boy, I love you so 
 (Mmm hmm) 
 Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
 (That's right, uh) 
 I hope you feel the same way too 
 (You know dat) 
 Step in my caravan of love 
 So I can love you down and give you hot oil rubs 
 Deliver wet kissies wit' dem brazen hugs 
 And now your sweet, silky body on my Persian rug 
 While we be sippin' cocoa from da same ol' mug 
 I'm readin' fortune cookies from the Chinese grub 
 It had some great stuff written in it with some cool rub-a-dub 
 A little ol' reminisce in the hot tub, huh 
 Janet (Shaggy): 
 Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover

 You're the only girl allowed to make my heart stop beatin' 
 Make me, ha, ha, breathless, ca-ca-can hardly speak 
 To meet a lady of your calibre is an honor indeed 
 Leave a lastin' impression for weeks and weeks

 Lay you gently on my sheet and sexercise you to sleep, huh
