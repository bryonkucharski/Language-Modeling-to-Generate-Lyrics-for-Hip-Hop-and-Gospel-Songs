Let's hear a reggae vibe, yeah, yeah 
 This one called the change of style 
 Shaggy style, let me say 
 Life ah be under pressure 
 The only way to relieve the stress is musical pleasure 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm alone 
 'Cause everyday I wake up it's the same old, same old world 
 Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed 
 In the mornin', aye 
 Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed 
 Down in the evenin' 
 'Cause reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows 
 It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow 
 I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe 
 Oh, gosh 
 Reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows 
 It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow 
 I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe 
 Good mornin' Mr.Bassy, would you pluck those strings? 
 Could you play me a line for the song that I sing now 
 Let reggae music flow, 'cause from the land of wood and water 
 Where the good times roll, now roll 
 Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed 
 Now in the mornin', aye 
 Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed
