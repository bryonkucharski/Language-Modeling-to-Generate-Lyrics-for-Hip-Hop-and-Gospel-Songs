Let's do this one positively 
 This one goes out to me mislead 
 To preserve the youths of tomorrow 
 Today is the time to stop all the unnecessary blood shed 
 Life of a gangster is not sweet 
 And I'm coming to you straight from the streets 
 This could be a story about anybody 
 But let's call him John Doe 
 A rude boy get murder cops were quicker on the draw 
 Another youth get murder a victim of the law 
 Rude boy get murder cops were quicker on the draw 
 Another youth get murder a victim of the law 
 Johnny was wicked ragamuffin and raw 
 Pull off a robbery but the cops he never saw 
 He got surrounded and they crushed him like a straw 
 John Doe went out like that 
 No, no, no 
 He heard them coming but he didn't get to flee 
 Wanted by the cops was living like a refugee 
 Do no evil think no evil try it and you will see 
 Bad boy and law man don't gree 
 Wicker on the microphone that is where I get my vibe 
 Trying to hustle and make a doller ain't got no 9 to 5 
 Watching my back when going home and trying to stay alive 
 Got to strive, got to strive, got to strive 
 Johnny was a gangster well ain't life a bitch 
 Robbing with his homies then they got ditched 
 Thought he was the man but he was rolling with a snitch 
 All he wanted to do was get rich (ME)
