Girl gimmi little loving girl gimmi little loving baby come come 
 Girl gimmi little loving I want you by my side tonight 
 Girl gimmi little loving girl gimmi little loving baby come come 
 Girl gimmi little loving don't wanna be alone tonight 
 See I don't mind when you say that you're going away 
 I just don't want to be lonely 
 And I don't care if we share only moments a day 
 I just don't want to be lonely 
 (v1) 
 Girl could you hold me babe that would please me 
 Don't do this darling I hate when you leave me 
 You got me hooked girl this isn't easy 
 If you don't love me baby release me 
 Now girl we could dine pour us some wine 
 After the meal we can unwind putting my heart back on the line 
 Girl it's a fact you should be mine 
 Now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night 
 And a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight 
 No feel no way I man can't take the fuss and the fight 
 I rather make sweet love to you under the candle light 
 I don't mind when you say that you're going away 
 I just don't want to be lonely 
 And I don't care if we spend only moments a day 
 I just don't want to be lonely 
 (v2) 
 Now lissen me please I'm down on my knees 
 I'm begging you darling put me at ease 
 What's with this feeling I wish it would cease 
 My heart is held hostage I beg for release 
 Why won't reveal just what you feel 
 Let it out babe just be for real 
 Girl what you afraid of why is it concealed 
 I know what I bargained for and this ain't the deal 
 Now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night 
 And a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight 
 No feel no way I man can't take the fuss and the fight 
 I rather make sweet love to you under the candle light 
 I don't mind when you say that you're going away 
 I just don't want to be lonely 
 And I don't care if we spend only moments a day 
 I just don't want to be lonely
