Late night, wake up 
 I'm sick, I'm stuck 
 You're here, so near 
 Your dream my fear 
 Your love, my loss 
 Your dime my cost 
 My fate, your hands 
 My life, your brand 
 Living my life in spite of you 
 This is the best that I can do 
 Nothing left for me to prove 
 I give it all to you 
 Nothing's what we made it 
 And we're living like we hate it 
 I have given all I can 
 But I can't anymore 
 Freedom, I can taste it 
 And the truth, I need to face it 
 I've always been dedicated 
 But I can't anymore 
 Girl you know our love is kinda crazy 
 And no matter what you're still my lady 
 Oh 
 I know you're fienin up here weekly lately 
 Ah boy you'll find a stretch, you'll never leave me 
 Oh 
 When you woke me up and you give me the sweetest wind up 
 Take someone to loving, if you be young to time uh 
 Yea, I figured why I was so blind now 
 Even though your hurt was under surface and me ignored your signs girl 
 Limbered and teared up, can't leave me like this 
 Just give me a chance for me to right this 
 Girl I know you live my love despite this 
 Cannot let you go, I got to fight for this 
 Nothing's what we made it 
 And we're living like we hate it 
 I have given all I can 
 But I can't anymore 
 Freedom, I can taste it 
 And the truth, I need to face it 
 I've always been dedicated 
 But I can't anymore 
 It's not right 'cause you're saying this 
 I wasn't born to serve you 
 I was born to love 
 Your house, your rules 
 Keep calm, keep cool 
 Tip toe, steer clear 
 Your mask, I wear 
 Your wants, my needs 
 Loaded, good deeds 
 Your frown, my smile 
 You're up, I'm down 
 Living my life in spite of you 
 This is the best that I can do 
 Nothing left for me to prove 
 I give it all to you 
 Nothing's what we made it 
 And we're living like we hate it 
 I have given all I can 
 But I can't anymore 
 Freedom, I can taste it 
 And the truth, I need to face it 
 I've always been dedicated 
 But I can't anymore 
 Anymore 
 Baby, and you get the reason 
 Baby, and you get the reason 
 Baby, and you get the reason 
 Never let it sit so long mandita
