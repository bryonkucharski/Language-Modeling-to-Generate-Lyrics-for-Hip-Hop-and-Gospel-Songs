Rest in peace Nico Demus, yuh originate dem style yah 
 Flava di king, fi love is all I bring 
 Tell dem Mr. Lover keep dem rockin' and sing 
 More time mi have di woman pon mi bed spring 
 Tell dem Mr. Lover unda pure timin 
 Anyting mi chat mi chat it wid rhymin 
 Woman dem love how mi sing 
 Mi woman just a love mi up 
 Tek di weight up off my shoulda when she hug mi up 
 Throw mi troubles through the window when she rub mi up 
 She's the Queen that wear my ring 
 She treat a peasant like a king wid all di lovin' weh she bring
