Ya-ya man, I just got my hair braided, car waxed, put on my player face,

 Midnight to fair I'm seemin, squeemin, armed with the franklins wheelin, dealin', 
 Got a damsel I'm peepin, not for the keepin' ah oh, pagers beepin. 
 When I'm out there seekin', creepin', chicken heads weaken your girl I be freakin, 
 Since your man, he be sleepin', girl stop your weepin, later we be raisin the ceilin. 
 Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn), 
 I get my party on (yo), we gonna party till the break of dawn. 
 Mommy with the thick thighs, curvy on the hips, gotta broad tongue type, 
 Baby you the shhhh, here to give a good time. 
 Pickin' up your corsage later in the pulmaride, your the player's pick, 
 Rollin' with the big dogs, hangin' with my clique. 
 Punk you betta think twice, you don't wanna trip, put away your pistols, 
 Sip up on this crystal, catch up on the in style, watch 'em hunnies there. 
 Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn), 
 I get my party on (yo), we gonna party till the break of dawn. 
 Hot chicks and fish net stockins, fake breast and tummy tuckin, 
 Low rider jeans are rockin', know who the dudes be cockin, hot cars and roads be block n. 
 We ball so girls be flockin, a lot a cherries poppin', 
 Upstairs where boots be knockin'. 
 Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn), 
 I get my party on (yo), we gonna party till the break of dawn. 
 So come on and party with me, ain't no better place you could be, 
 When we come, stop the party, can't nobody do it like me. 
 So come on and party with me, ain't no better place you could be, 
 Loosen up and set yourself free, take a chance right here, you'll see. 
 Midnight to fair I'm seemin, squeemin, armed with the franklins wheelin, dealin',
