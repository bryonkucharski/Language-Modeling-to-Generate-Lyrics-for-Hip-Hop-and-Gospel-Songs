Respect is going on tonight aspect 
 Ward a man in a prison for all the a reason 
 Can't judge a man before you walk a mile inna him shoes 
 Shags man say so 
 Watch this 
 It bun me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 Hurt me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 A 25 years to life and 50 million dollar bill 
 Many time trying to escape and many times fail 
 And eat him bread that is stale and get him lick with gippo 
 Now the tracks are in tears, the boy face look pale 
 Man them beat him with the baton, read him personal mail 
 Him could a graduate Harvard and graduate Yale 
 But him muma have rebut it 'cause she know her son fail 
 It bun me fi see mi brother in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 Before you 
 Commit the crime make sure you can do the time 
 No bother pair with no idiot 'cause them we drop dime 
 Bank book have fi find in case you're off and bare the find 
 'Cause they will lock you in a prison 
 Away from mankind 
 Everyday you bark your face when you have no gal fi grain 
 Inna one big, dotty parlour catch up and you're behind 
 It bun me fi see mi little brethrin in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 Jamaica a the land of wood and water 
 The wood might a free but you have fi pay fi water 
 Everytime light go down they use the wood make fire 
 Ressources use up the country 
 Hand up and shout 
 Another man lick, yell help, we neither see or go 
 They here beat, be and bib well none of them no better 
 Right a now we want a new brand prime minister 
 We want a little ghetto youth with some bright idea 
 It bun me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 Youths and youths hitch up on the corner 
 Better you be a hustler than to be a smuggler 
 If you is a smuggler you 'bout go kill all danger 
 Better you sell some stockist, cough up all gleaner 
 If you is a smuggler you carry a revolver 
 You either behind the bar or six foot under 
 It bun me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see mi brethrin behind the rail 
 Bun me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 A 25 years to life and 50 million dollar bill 
 Many time trying to escape and many times fail (ME) 
 Eat him bread that is stale and get him lick with gippo 
 The tracks are in tears, the boy face look pale 
 Them beat him with the baton, read him personal mail 
 Him could a graduate Harvard, graduate Yale 
 Him muma have rebut it 'cause she know her son fail 
 It bun me fi see mi little brother in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail

 They here beat, be and bib well none of them no better 
 Right a now we want a new brand prime minister 
 Want a little ghetto-youth with some bright idea 
 Want fi make the ghetto-people them start prosper 
 Want fi make the ghetto-people them start live better 
 Come take it from Shaggy deh round mike a lecture 
 Put your hand inna the air and read the Holy Script 
 Chaka 
 'Cause it bun me fi see mi brethrin in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail 
 It bun me, another black man in a jail 
 Bun me fi see the youth stand up behind the rail
