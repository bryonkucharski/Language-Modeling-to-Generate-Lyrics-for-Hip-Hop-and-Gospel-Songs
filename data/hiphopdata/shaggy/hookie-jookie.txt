If you creep pon your man no mek no one see you 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you

 If you creep pon your man no mek no one see you 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you 
 Hookie jookie and the nookie that I'm giving to you 
 (Lady's voice) Uh, uh, uh 
 Ask a woman if she's faithful she says yes indeed 
 Can't swear for a woman when she is in need 
 Overtaken by a hunger that she has to feed 
 Whoever gives her what she wants gonna follow their lead 
 (Strange Voice) What do you think will happen when she wants the ride 
 When you won't give her and she steps outside 
 Knock on my door at a quarter past five 
 Well you know I'm going to let her inside 
 Guess what will happen when I draw those blinds 
 What was yours is now suddenly mine 
 She comes back and she's all full of smiles 
 And your too dumb to recognize these signs 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you 
 Hookie jookie and the nookie that I'm giving to you 
 (Lady's voice) Uh, uh, uh 
 If you creep pon your man no mek no one see you 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you 
 Hookie jookie and the nookie that I'm giving to you 
 (Lady's voice) Uh, uh, uh 
 When a man gives a gal bun him give her that with cheese 
 Meet a woman now and later have her on her knees 
 But to hide it like a woman isn't done with ease 
 No matter how you try to lie the truth she always sees 
 (Ladys voice) Uh... 
 (Strange voice) The guilt is written all over your face 
 She already done tried your case 
 Cause you made it so easy to trace 
 Now somebodys gonna take your place 
 So when you're out there and you're having your fling 
 Slamming and banging and bedsprings sing 
 Back home in bed like she won't notice a thing 
 Down there smells like Irish Spring 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you 
 Hookie jookie and the nookie that I'm giving to you 
 (Lady's voice) Uh, uh, uh 
 If you creep pon your man no mek no one see you 
 Can't mek nobody have no secret for you 
 Hookie jookie and the nookie that I'm giving to you
