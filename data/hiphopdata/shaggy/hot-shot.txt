They call me Mr hot shot baby can I do my thing 
 Don't stop girl I like the vibe you bring 
 Knock knock open up and let me in 
 We can do most anything tell me do you like my swing repeat 
 Well tell me if you no hear 
 How the reggae lover him a run things this year 
 New tune fi buss and me have lyrics fi spare 
 No need to fear 
 Girl if you down with Mr lover put you finger inna the air 
 I love you walk 
 And I even like the raunchy way that you talk 
 You're the kinda girl that all the fellas all a 
 Come let me discombobulate your parts 
 Well girl you better know she right ya now you is a part of the plan 
 I notice pon you finger she you wear a wedding band 
 No bother think say this is just a one night stand 
 No think I man a look you fi a slam 
 I tell you gal on top of how you look you know you have sex appeal 
 You're like a priceless gem whe every man waan fi steal 
 Expressing my emotions got to tell you how I feel 
 So baby come and let me know the deal 
 (Repeat 1st verse)
