Hey love can I get a rain check 
 Just 25 I'm not ready yet 
 Hey love let's make a deal 
 Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal 
 Hey love got more grounds to gain 
 Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain 
 Hey love I need to be sure 
 Come back and see me in two years or more 
 I remember as a kid I used to dream 
 I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister jean 
 But she was in love with dwayne 
 Been so many years but I still feel the pain 
 What about the girl across the street 
 Took the same bus I use to reserve her seat 
 But she would just sit with her friends 
 And the all talk about guys in bimmers and Benz 
 Seem like my luck took a slide 
 Then shorty came along and stood by my side 
 I couldn't give her much but she stayed 
 Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid 
 Living in style I'm getting paid 
 Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made 
 Now I'm having girl who I knew in first grade 
 Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played 
 So I'm begging you 
 Hey love can I get a rain check 
 Just 25 I'm not ready yet 
 Hey love let's make a deal 
 Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal 
 Hey love got more grounds to gain 
 Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain 
 Hey love I need to be sure 
 Come back and see me in two years or more 
 I wasn't popular in school I wasn't popular in sports 
 All the girls I love loved the guys on the court 
 I feel like I been cheated of my youth 
 Cause back in the days braces weren't so cute 
 Girls used to laugh at my suit 
 Now I got models in bed knocking boots 
 (Repeat 1st verse)
