 Let it go! let it go! you don't wanna know

 (Shaggy) (*Nicole Scherzinger) 
 How many men did you have? (Don't ask her that) 
 Can you count on one hand? (Don't ask her that) 
 Am I like your last man? (Don't ask her that) 
 (*We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know) 
 Back in the day were you a freak? (Don't ask her that) 
 In the past hey did you creep? (Don't ask her that) 
 How you so good between the sheets? (Don't ask her that) 
 (*We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know) 
 Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 Wanna know all the things that I used to do 
 When I keep it on the real you get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 You want to follow my past well it's up to you 
 When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth 
 Verse 1: Shaggy 
 Don't ask 'bout the past you should let some things be 
 No need to concern 'bout the man she has seen 
 You ask how many she tell you just three 
 Knowing that your ego can't handle thirteen 
 It's best not to ask 'bout her previous guys 
 Unless you are willin' to handle her lie 
 Especially when she's discussin their size 
 You just might be in for a bigger surprise 
 Verse 2: (Shaggy) 
 You listen to me go a you really don't wanna hear 
 Your stirrin the feelings that you know you can't really bare 
 So what if the answer you can prevent your biggest fear 
 (Now ask yourself are you really prepared? Uh!) 
 Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 Wanna know all the things that I used to do 
 When I keep it on the real you get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 You want to follow my past well it's up to you 
 When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth 
 Verse 3: Shaggy 
 An expert it seems when it comes to foreplay 
 The many positions she did made your day 
 I know you must wonder how she get that way 
 Don't ask you might not wanna hear what she'll say 
 Just look in the past and the ways you had fun 
 Would you wanna know when the things you had done 
 She might lose her cool and be tempted to run 
 So what heave you learned when it's all said and done 
 Verse 4: (Shaggy) 
 You think of the info that you really don't wanna hear 
 Your stirrin the feelings that you know you can't really bare 
 So what if the answer you can prevent your biggest fear 
 (Now ask yourself are you really prepared? Uh!) 
 Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 Wanna know all the things that I used to do 
 When I keep it on the real you get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth 
 Go 'head do what you came to do 
 You want to follow my past well it's up to you 
 When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude 
 You want the truth, you can't handle the truth
