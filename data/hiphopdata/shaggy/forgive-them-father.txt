Them say money is the root of all evil 
 But a no money 
 Some people a kill people little or nothing 
 Some say them a gangster but a studio gangster 
 Well now a gun shot lick and a marrow it fly 
 Little youth with the 45 and him say do or die 
 Now him muma she cry water run from her eye 
 And she remember when him was little bit and oh so shy 
 Forgive them father 'cause they know not what they have done 
 To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son 
 Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run 
 Too much fuss and fight (BOO) 
 And that is not right 
 You no can't blow breath in a man but still that you want take life 
 Innocent youth die bury a next guy 
 And him muma wool her belly and ask God why? 
 Well no ask me no question I tell you no lie 
 It's about time the world start to realize 
 This a revelation and it's a serious time 
 Put you're a hand inna the air and pray to the most high 
 Cha 
 Youth man a beg and you fi put down your gun 
 Me no want fi see another youth tumble down 
 This is reality no play dumb dumb 
 Some a them a thing 'bout dollars having a large sum 
 Money is the root of all evil if so me no want none 
 Wicked man them a heathen fi them fire burn 
 Whole a them shall perish inna the wicked kingdom 
 This is Shaggy one of Jah Jah son 
 Yow! yow! yow! stop talking yow 
 Mislead the youth to shoot them one another down 
 Muma what this you're talking pure foolishness 
 Can't sit down eat me Sunday ackee and salt fish 
 Can't use me tongue and lick out me pyrex dish 
 As me sit down and a wish me mouth start get peckish 
 Have fi eat me dry bread and drink the water well quick 
 Now a gun shot lick and a marrow it fly 
 Little youth with the 45 and him say do or die 
 Now him muma she cry water run from her eye 
 And she remember when him was little bit and oh so shy 
 Watch it
