Intro: Shaggy (Rayvon) 
 Straight outta Flatbush, always tek it back (Whoa oh) 
 Fi yuh peeps (Whoa whoa whoa oh) 
 Don't worry about it, it's been brought up 
 Cause you never know what your gonna turn out to be 
 (No oh ooh ooh) Life has it's funny twist and turns yuh nah mean (Yay yay) 
 Chorus: Rayvon 
 Back in the days, tried and failed but look at me now 
 How, things have changed, had no friends but look at me now 
 It, seems so strange, no one cared but look at me now 
 Fortune and fame, who would guess but look at me now 
 Verse 1: Shaggy 
 Friends, spend nuh time wid dem 
 I was the kid who never follow many trends 
 Used to wear the glasses with the soda bottle lens 
 Girls didn't like me and a few would just pretend 
 It's funny back in school the guys that were so cool 
 Are the very ones who wish them could a be walkin' inna mi shoes 
 Now tell me whose the fool, them never have a clue 
 That's why I'm here to dedicate this song to all of you, hey hey! 
 Chorus: Rayvon 
 Back in the days (The days) tried and failed but look at me now 
 How, things have changed (How things changed) had no friends but look at me now 
 It, seems so strange (So strange) no one cared but look at me now 
 Fortune and fame (Ooh wee) who would guess but look at me now 
 Verse 2: Shaggy 
 I, never realized, I could make reality di tings I fantasize 
 Stuck to my plan and to everyone surprise 
 Even those who doubt a stand before mi mesmerized 
 I bloom delay a late, I couldn't get an eight 
 Di cheerleadin chicks grew up to all be overweight 
 See now I lookin' great, I wonda what they ate 
 To that I'm really happy wid my supermodel date, hey hey 
 Chorus: Rayvon 
 Back in the days (I know) tried and failed but look at me now 
 How, things have changed (Shooby dooby doo yeah) had no friends but look at me now 
 It, seems so strange (I know I know) no one cared but look at me now 
 Fortune and fame (No no) who would guess but look at me now 
 Bridge: Shaggy 
 If you think you got it figured out well listen to me 
 Don't ever underestimate what people can be 
 Now who's the one that's most likely to succeed 
 It's usually the one's you don't see, hey 
 If you think you got it figured out well listen to me 
 Don't ever underestimate what people can be 
 Now who's the one that's most likely to succeed 
 It's usually the one's you don't see, come again 
 Chorus: Rayvon 
 Back in the days (Back in the days) tried and failed but look at me now

 It, seems so strange (So strange) no one cared but look at me now 
 Fortune and fame (Oh) who would guess but look at me now 
 Back in the days (Back in the days) tried and failed but look at me now 
 How, things have changed (How things have changed) had no friends but look at me now 
 It, seems so strange (So strange, hey) no one cared but look at me now 
 Fortune and fame, who would guess but look at me now
