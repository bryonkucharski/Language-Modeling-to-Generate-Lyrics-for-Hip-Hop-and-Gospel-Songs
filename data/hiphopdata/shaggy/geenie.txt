Shaggy 
 She definitely mine until the end of time 
 Talking about this sweet little girl 
 My darling princess 
 I gotta get Brian and Tony Gold to help me on this one 
 In the whole wide world 
 Allow me to express my love 
 Baby you're definitely mine 
 Shaggy

 She was a genie and a perfect work of art 
 She had a certain light that overcame the dark 
 Ï couldn't imagine this love to fall apart 
 Oh baby my love
