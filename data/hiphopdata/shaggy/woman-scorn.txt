Yeah, I really love this, it's time to show you who di boss 
 Wake up, get up, wake up, here, whatchu got you skin out? 
 I know what she was doin' here, I know what she was doin' 
 You can't keep it in your pants, gimme so level now 
 So hard to believe that this is how my day begun 
 Woke to find I'm staring down the nossel of a gun 
 Palm begin to sweat, imagination start to run 
 How or where or when she find out, sent mi gi ya bun 
 You got my attention, baby, tell me what's the deal 
 Take your time to explain to me exactly how you feel 
 Just showing me your side to you I've never really seen 
 No need to brandish your steel 
 'Cause we been together so long 
 You no see say we relationship so strong 
 All this drama, now where did it come from? 
 Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong? 
 It didn't have to end up like this 
 I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this 
 Have me deya all a hope say you might miss 
 There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss 
 Before you pull the trigger just remember who I am 
 I'm the man who stuck to you when no one gave a damn 
 I'm the man who dust you off and make you live grand 
 A di same one whe father the pickney inna your pram 
 May have strayed a bit but you are still my number one 
 Done pick the ring you name de pon the wedding band 
 Wear me last name, officially your husband 
 So why you woulda wan spoil the plan? 
 'Cause we been together so long 
 You no see say we relationship so strong 
 All this drama, now where did it come from? 
 Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong? 
 It didn't have to end up like this 
 I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this 
 Have me deya all a hope say you might miss 
 There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss 
 Don't say a word, 'cause all that I've heard 
 Just can't explain why you think 
 I receive more that I deserve 
 Don't even try to sell me your lies 
 You were no good from the start 
 And I'm mad 'cause I just realized 
 Moral is a woman scorn, hotter than a firestorm 
 Never sleep, never calm, never heed to the warn 
 Made her angry now she gone, never shoulda mash her corn 
 Never witness from your born, devil in a woman's form 
 'Cause we been together so long 
 You no see say we relationship so strong 
 All this drama, now where did it come from? 
 Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong? 
 It didn't have to end up like this 
 I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this 
 Have me deya all a hope say you might miss 
 There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss
