Yo this one goes out to all my immigrants, you hear 
 Live up, don't give up 
 Wait a minute let me set the record straight 
 You need to listen for a moment or two. 
 Hear the accent, don't get it twisted 
 My momma didn't raise no fool. 
 Though you think that you got me figured out 
 When you really haven't got a clue. 
 So take a lesson from this island boy 
 This coconut may be smarter than you. 
 So I say 
 Don't judge me 
 You don't know me 
 Don't think I'm some small town phony 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 I'm just one out of many 
 Hailin from a third-world country 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 Learnt my lesson from my humble beginnings 
 And I wouldn't have it no other way. 
 Became a man in the street of Kingston where 
 Survival was the art of the day. 
 I choose the best as my main competition 
 And I'm always on top of my game. 
 So don't be blinded by my race or my gender 
 'Cause we're really all one in the same 
 So I say 
 Don't judge me 
 You don't know me 
 Don't think I'm some small town phony 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 I'm just one out of many 
 Hailin from a third world country 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 No I won't stop, 
 Gotta make it to the top. 
 Hell no I won't stop, 
 Aimin for the sweet spot. 
 Powers to the bald heads and the dread locks 
 Let me make it clear 
 No we won't flop. 
 Got a plan, got to make anyway I can 
 Putting in the work with my own two hands. 
 Better check it, respect it 
 I'm a man, I'm a West Indian 
 Don't judge me 
 You don't know me 
 Don't think I'm some small town phony 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 I'm just one out of many 
 Hailin from a third world country 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 Don't judge me 
 You don't know me 
 Don't think I'm some small town phony 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 I'm just one out of many 
 Hailin from a third world country 
 Got nothing, up on me 
 You ain't walking in my shoes 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
