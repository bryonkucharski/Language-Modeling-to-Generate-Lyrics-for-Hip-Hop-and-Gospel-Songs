Uh- that's right 
 Reality check 
 You know what I mean 
 Street lifes eh 
 Scorpion yeah uh 
 When I was young 
 I use to dream of being rich 
 Have alot of houses and cars 
 Couldn't know which one was which 
 And finding me a chick and getting hitched 
 Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch 
 You think that this would bring me happiness 
 If at the end of every rainbow 
 There was a treasure chest 
 Sometimes having more is really less 
 So take a look inside yourself 
 You'll realize you're really blessed 
 No matter how you're sad and blue 
 There's always someone who has it worse than you 
 Sometimes you gotta pay your dues 
 So don't worry just push on through 
 Keep'n it real 
 Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future 
 Even though they know they gotta struggle 
 Keep'n it real 
 To all my homies working on the 9 to 5 
 And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble 
 Keep'n it real 
 Although sometimes I know it seems impossible 
 There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows 
 Keep'n it real 
 If things are as bad as they can be 
 You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow 
 I NEVER GOT to have myself the house, the mansion, and the Benz 
 I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends 
 I got myself a girl but we be kickin' it as friends 
 Is not enough for me now that depends 
 Again- not everything you want is everything you really need 
 The standard of society is modevated by greed 
 Are you prepared to follow 
 Tell me are you prepared to lead 
 So persevere and you'll succeed 
 Keep'n it real 
 Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future 
 Even though they know they gotta struggle 
 Keep'n it real 
 To all my homies working on the 9 to 5 
 And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble 
 Keep'n it real 
 Although sometimes I know it seems impossible 
 There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows 
 Keep'n it real 
 If things are as bad as they can be 
 You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow 
 All the harsh realities 
 Appears to come in twos and threes 
 Don't worry 'cause 
 There'll be a better day 
 One thing I can promise you 
 Just keep on keeping on 
 I swear to you 
 There's gonna be a brighter day 
 Back in the days 
 I USED TO dream of being rich 
 Have alot of houses and cars 
 Couldn't know which one was which 
 And finding me a chick and getting hitched 
 Living the fairy tale life perfect witout a ditch 
 You think that this would bring me happiness 
 If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest 
 Sometimes having more is really less 
 So take a look inside yourself 
 You'll realize you're really blessed 
 No matter how you're sad and blue 
 There's always someone who has it worse than you 
 Sometimes you gotta pay your dues

 That's right, see me, yeah 
 Give thanks for what you have, ya know 
 And when you think that its bad 
 There's always somebody that's worse 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 Good job listenen to me 
 Wa-wa, Wa-wa 
 Wa-wa, wa-wa
