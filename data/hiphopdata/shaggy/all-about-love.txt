Ain't seen no love like this 
 Never felt no love like this 
 I ain't seen no love like this, eh 
 It's all about love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 A little more love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I need your love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Now as I wake up in the mornin', meet the risin' sun 
 You're on my mind throughout the day 
 Could hardly get things done 
 It's that love that you give comparison to none 
 Cupid gave me a shot from a loaded gun 
 There is no love like this I've ever seen her with 
 Love strikes, got me all believe it 
 Sweaty palm and the tearful eye 
 The thought of you brings me butterflies 
 It's all about love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 A little more love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I want your love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I know I'm far from perfect, that's to my dismay 
 You complain that I'm so stuck in my ways 
 Insecurity is what I seldom display 
 It's unexplainable that love I feel for you each day 
 I told enough lies, it's amazin' that you're still with me 
 Most times my conscience gets the best of me 
 All the skirts that I used to chase 
 No one else can ever take your place 
 It's all about your love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I need your love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 It's hard to conceal it 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I need to reveal it 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 It's hard to conceal it 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It's all about love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 A little more love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 I want your love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 A little more love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Your sweet, sweet love 
 (Love, love, love, love) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 My woman, my woman
