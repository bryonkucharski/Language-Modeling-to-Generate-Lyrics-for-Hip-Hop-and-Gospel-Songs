SHAGGY: In the Summertime 
 It's a summertime affair 
 Shaggy ha 
 Ravyon 
 Sun and fun in the 
 Atmosphere, oh yes 
 In the summertime when 
 The weather is high 
 You can stretch right up 
 And touch the sky 
 When the weather is fine 
 You've got women 
 You've got women 
 On your mind 
 I'm gonna drive and ride and 
 See now what I can find 
 Now if her daddy's rich 
 Take her out for a meal 
 And if her daddy's poor 
 Then do as you feel 
 Speedin down the lane even 
 Thought the speed limit's 25 
 And when the sun goes down 
 I'll make it with my cutie pie 
 Weh me say 
 Pretty little women 
 Sexy as can be 
 Sweet as a honey 
 Sting like bumble bee 
 Shaggy say 
 Pretty little women 
 Sexy as can be 
 Sweet as honey 
 Sting like bumble bee 
 (Rap:) 
 It's a summertime affair 
 In the atmosphere 
 I man love off her attire 
 And the clothes she wear 
 Some burn off them with tyre 
 And a draw down a gear 
 Some a shine up wax up 
 Not a sign of snare 
 Got to be rolling in my 
 Christas so the girl them stare 
 This is Shaggy and Rayvon 
 As your ultimate pair 
 Taking care of our career 
 So tell the world beware 
 'Cause it's a brand new 
 Selection for your musical ear 
 We say what we want and 
 We say what we need 
 And we love everybody 
 And we do as we please 
 And when the weather is fine, 
 We go fishin' we 
 Go fishin' in the sea 
 We are happy to live life 
 That's our philosophy 
 Now if her daddy's rich 
 Take her out for a meal 
 And if her daddy's poor 
 Then do as you feel 
 Speedin down the lane even 
 Thought the speed limit's 25 
 And when the sun goes down 
 I'll make it with my cutie pie 
 Sweat a run off her body 
 With her caramel skin 
 I man smiled at her she 
 Looked at me and grinned 
 I offered her a drink she said 
 Juice and Gin 
 And I whispered in her ear 
 I asked how you doin' 
 Where was it that I reside 
 And I told her Brooklyn 
 Atmosphere filled with romance 
 Her eyes sparkling 
 Just her voice and what 
 She said let my poor head spin 
 Raggamuffin Shaggy 
 With a musical swing 
 I say 
 Pretty little woman 
 Sexy as can be 
 Sweet as a honey 
 Sting like bumble bee 
 In the summertime 
 When the weather is high 
 You can stretch right up 
 And touch the sky 
 When the weather is fine 
 You've got women 
 You've got women 
 On your mind 
 I'm gonna drive and ride 
 And see what I can find 
 Now if her daddy's rich 
 Take her out for a meal 
 And if her daddy's poor 
 Then do as you feel 
 Speedin down the lane even 
 Thought the speed limit's 25 
 And when the sun goes down 
 I'll make it with my cutie pie 
 Pretty little women 
 Sexy as can be 
 Sweet as a honey 
 Sting like bumble bee 
 Pretty little women 
 Sexy as can be 
 Sweet as honey 
 Sting like bumble bee 
 Repeat rap 
 In the summertime 
 In the summertime 
 (Repeat to fade)
