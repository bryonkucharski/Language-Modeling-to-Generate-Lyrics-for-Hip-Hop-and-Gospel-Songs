Shaggy 
 Let me hear you say, somebody say oh hoo 
 A girl like you is like a brand new automobile drive any man crazy 
 You passing around my avenue again baby 
 Your style is so repetitious it's about time Shaggy and Wayne Wonder start to get vicious 
 Wayne Wonder 
 Doing something different for a change 
 What a sexy body girl I have you in my range - SHAGGY 
 May not be sufficient but I'm doing just fine 
 Shaggy 
 When we do it different baby-love it is together 
 She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover 
 When we do it different baby love it is together 
 She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover 
 Baby love I admire the way you move the way you groove 
 I love the way you dance even when you step upon my shoes 
 It's my dream to sweep you off your feet and take you on a cruise 
 A romantic intersection I'm just here to pay my dues 
 Never see a girl that I love this right 
 It's kinda wicked it's kinda wild 
 Taking it easy under cool profile 
 You're so smooth and you're so mild 
 I don't care what your friends may say 
 I'm going to love you any way 
 Because they don't know about those days 
 When you gave good love to me downstairs

 Girl I love you I got to confess 
 My heart skip a beat I feel the pressure in my chest 
 Girl the way you got me going I wonder if you god bless 
 Are you a cut above the rest here to put me trough the test 
 I wouldn't mind love you up and give you nothing less 
 Your coca cola figure in that skin tight dress 
 Hold me in your arms with so much tenderness 
 Hmmm girl you make me breathless 
 Wayne Wonder 
 Standing vision anywhere you go 
 Every living male want to sit in your row 
 I can't afford to miss this show 
 So I got to let you know 
 Don't you worry honey don't you fret 
 Want to be all over you like sweat 
 Room full of class not to mention you got taste 
 I need next to get into your place

 The last time I say you all I got was a glance 
 I vow that day if I had another chance 
 I would (kiss) kill you with romance 
 I wouldn't even hesitate to make you jump and prance

 I love the way you dance even when you step upon my shoes 
 It's my dream to sweep you out your feet and take you on a cruise 
 A romantic intersection you don't know what path to choose 
 Electrify your love and blow your romance fuse 
 Anybody else you get you would definitely lose 
 Wayne wonder and shaggy we speaking the truth
