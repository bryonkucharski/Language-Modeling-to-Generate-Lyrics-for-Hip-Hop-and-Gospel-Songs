Now, when I'm trying to tell the truth, they always think that I'm lying 
 When I be trying to tell my girl that... her friend's trying to make moves on me 
 ('Cause they probably are) 
 Straight offa that you think I'm trying to hit that 
 Yow girl, you know that ain't my steelo 
 (Whatever) 
 SHAGGY laugh 
 What's wrong yo?...ugh... ugh... 
 Shaggy 
 First of all, give me a break 
 (Why??) 
 That's not my style that ain't how I operate 
 She's the one who had step to me 
 Tell me that she wanna do me 
 She's your friend and she didn't hesitate 
 Honey dip be dropping' mad game in my ear 
 Even telling me she be without underwear 
 (No WHAT????) 
 I don't know even know why you trippin' 
 It's your girl who is kickin' 
 Tryin' to get me in a one night affair 
 That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth 
 Talkin' to your friends lettin all my secrets out 
 How I put it on in the' morn 
 Work you over till dawn 
 **We need his line right here!** 
 Don't even stand there looking all surprised 
 Didn't take long for them all to realize 
 Boo, that you needed a hand 
 Takin' care of your man 
 You should be happy that I didn't hit the prize 
 (No you didn't!?!?) 
 Your friend made a pass at me 
 No matter what I say, you just don't believe 
 You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it 
 But I didn't, now you mad at me 
 Why? 
 (I can't believe this) 
 Wah, Your girlfriend step to me 
 No matter what I say, you just don't believe 
 You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it 
 Now you mad at me 
 Shaggy 
 Probably thought she was your friend 
 (My best friend, dammn) 
 Childhood buddies from the tender age of ten 
 Seems swapping dolls was a game that you both used to play 
 She probably thinks the same applies to men 
 (Not my man) 
 See girl, you need to know what's goin' on 
 'Cause I do believe that you got it all wrong 
 You will have no one to blame 
 Cause you didn't stake your claim 
 You never know what you got till it's gone 
 That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth 
 (So now it's my fault?!?!) 
 Talkin' to your friends lettin' all my secrets out 
 How I put it on in the morn 
 Work you over till dawn 
 **WE NEED HIS LINE RIGHT HERE, Still!** 
 Don't even stand there looking all surprised 
 Didn't take long for them all to realize 
 Boo, that you needed a hand 
 Takin' care of your man 
 You should be happy that I didn't hit the fan 
 (Whatever!) 
 Why? 
 SHAGGY laugh 
 CHORUS Here 
 Shaggy 
 I know you think you really know her 
 (Well I did) 
 Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over 
 Hey I ain't no cassanova 
 But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over 
 Though you think you really know her 
 Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over 
 Yo, I ain't no cassanova 
 (Yeah Right) 
 But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over 
 CHORUS Here 
 **Third time Girl says (I don't believe this)
