(Got to let you know) 
 (The world is one big yard) 
 (Let the ladies of the world know) 
 (Let's give thanks to the lord.) 
 No one stops to smell the roses 
 There's just too much going on. 
 Wish we'd only stop to notice 
 That the writing's on the wall 
 I can hear the people talking, 
 Longing for them olden days 
 We can choose the path we walk in, 
 If we will only change our ways. 
 We are the one's (Chorus) 
 Easily we point the finger 
 Always someone else to blame 
 We can't always be a winner 
 That's the nature of the game 
 One by one we'll make a differnce 
 There's no effort that's too small 
 Lets decide to go the distance 
 And change the writing on the wall 
 We are the one's (Chorus) 
 We are the one's 
 Who make this world whole again. 
 We are the one's 
 Who make this a home 
 Again.
