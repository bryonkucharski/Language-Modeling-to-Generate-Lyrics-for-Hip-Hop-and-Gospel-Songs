 Before you tie the knot well everything looks sweet 
 Now she wash, she cook, she clean and keep your house sparkling clean 
 Keep her body in a shape young fresh and green 
 All when she a twenty five years when she a sixteen 
 When you say "I do" you probably think it's a dream 
 All at a sudden it's like the beauty turn in the beast 
 If a me you want marry let me put you at ease 
 I rather gone roam this place like them damn lego beast
