Uh, wow, uh, hm, ya, SHAGGY! 
 Uh, yeah. 
 This one goes out to all my women, 
 My strong women, 
 Uh. 
 So amazing how this world was made, 
 I wonder if God is a woman. 
 The gift of life astounds me to this day, 
 I give it up for the woman. 
 She's the constant wind that fills my sails, 
 Oh, that woman. 
 With a smile and a style, 
 She'll protect you like a child, 
 That's a woman. 
 She'll put a smile upon your face, 
 And take you to that higher place, 
 So don't you underestimate, 
 The strength of a woman. 
 The strength of a woman. 
 Woke up this morning, 
 Got up with the scent of a woman. 
 So picture if you would what life would be, 
 ... Ain't much good without a woman. 
 She can nag and be a constant pain, 
 Oh, that woman. 
 But those hips, 
 She's got me whipped, 
 And it's just too hard to resist, 
 What a woman. 
 She'll put a smile upon your face, 
 And take you to a higher place, 
 So don't you underestimate, 
 The strength of a woman. 
 The strength of a woman. 
 Tender lips that's so so sweet, 
 Gentle words she softly speaks, 
 Such an angel when we meet, 
 God bless the ground beneath her feet, 
 She can take you on a high, 
 Be your comfort when you cry, 
 But if you look into her eyes you'll see, 
 The strength of a woman. 
 The strength of a woman 
 She'll put a smile upon your face, 
 And take you to a higher place, 
 So don't you underestimate, 
 The strength of a woman. 
 The strength of a woman.
