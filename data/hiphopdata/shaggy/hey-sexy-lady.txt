(Intro: Shaggy) 
 Sexy, hot! 
 I love your style girl, 
 Put it on me 
 Brian and Tony Gold let the ladies know, 
 They got it goin' on 
 Uh! Shaggy! 
 (Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy)) 
 Hey sexy lady, I like your flow 
 Your body's bangin', out of control! (Uh!) 
 You put it on me (That's right) ceiling to floor 
 Only you can make me scream and beg for more! 
 (Verse 1: Shaggy) 
 Her body's callin, bawlin' 
 Got me crawlin' up the wall and 
 My size ain't small, it's tall 
 And catch a glimpse her clothes be fallin' 
 Her neighbor's callin, bawlin' 
 All this noise is so appallin' 
 They must believe we're brawlin' 
 Headboards bang till early mornin' 
 (Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy)) 
 Hey sexy lady (Uh!) I like your flow 
 Your body's bangin' (Yo) out of control! Yo! (A big tune) 
 You put it on me (Uh!)) ceiling to floor (Ceiling to floor girl) 
 Only you can make me (Uh) scream and beg for more! 
 (Verse 2: Shaggy) 
 I was her father's choosin', 
 Performance left her snoozin' 
 Rug burns her knees we're bruised and, 
 She's hooked ain't no refusin' 
 (Brian And Tony Gold:) 
 I knew it all along (Uh!) 
 She was the perfect one (What!) 
 She really put it on (On me) 
 I had to write a song 
 (Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy)) 
 Hey sexy lady (She's drivin' me nuts) 
 I like your flow (Uh! Uh!) 
 Your body's bangin' (Sexy Lady) out of control! (Sweet and nice) 
 You put it on me (You know you got that figure) 
 Ceiling to floor 
 Only you can make me (Wow) 
 Scream and beg for more! 
 (Verse 3: Brian And Tony Gold) 
 Hey sexy lady you be fine, drive me crazy 
 Movin' on, and on, and on 
 Hey sexy lady you be fine, drive me crazy 
 Movin' on, and on, and on 
 (Shaggy (Brian And Tony Gold)) 
 Gal you're extra sexy like (Whoa) 
 And you make me wanna say (Hi) 
 When you shake, you shake it down (Low) 
 Gal you wicked to rahtid nah (Lie) 
 Gal I like the way how you (Flow) 
 Everytime you passin' me (By) 
 Gal you wiggly jiggly and (Oh) 
 And you wicked to rahtid nah (Lie) 
 (Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy)) 
 Hey sexy lady (Uh!) I like your flow (Whaddat) 
 Your body's bangin', out of control! 
 You put it on me (Put it on me baby) ceiling to floor (Uh!) 
 Only you can make me (Only you) scream and beg for more!
