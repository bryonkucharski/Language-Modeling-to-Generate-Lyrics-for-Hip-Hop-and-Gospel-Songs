 Shaggy, Cartel remix 
 Nucci Rayo 
 Now picture this I'm bucknaked on the bathroom floor 
 Hittin' Aaliyah raw, Henney-ed up, Mya seen it all 
 Same reason Kim and Foxy ain't speakin' no more 
 And why Britney and Christina didn't speak at the awards 
 Keys in the door, I heard a noise 
 I didn't get up 
 Next thing you know Destiny's Child split up 
 But yo I'm Cris-ed up, got Monica in Miami 
 Soon as Kobe get married 
 I'll be back with Brandy 
 (Shaggy) 
 How you fe hav yuh woman nex' a yuh villa? 
 Trepass and a witness up inna 'you pilla 
 Yuh betta watch your back before she turn into a killa 
 Interview the situation or she call the gleaner 
 To be a true playa you fe know how fe play 
 If she say a night, convince her seh a day 
 Never admit to a word wat she say 
 And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way 
 (1) - (Nucci (Shaggy)) 
 Yo but she caught me on the counter 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Saw me banging on the sofa 
 (It wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the shower 
 (It wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the Range Rover 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She saw the marks on my should 
 (It wasn't me) 
 And here's the words that I told her 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She heard the screams gettin' louder 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She stayed until it was over 
 (2) - (Richard "Rikrok" Ducent) 
 Honey came in and she caught me redhanded 
 Creepin' with the girl next door 
 Picture this, we were both buck naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 (Shaggy) 
 Mek she know seh, dat she neva hav' no right fe vex 
 A never yuh seh see, a mek the gigalo flex 
 A somebody else whey favor yuh in de complex 
 See is believing so yuh betta change yuh specs 
 Yuh know she a go bring a whole heap a tings up from de past 
 All the likkle evident you betta know fe mask 
 Quick pon yo' answer, know how fe talk 
 But if she back a run, yuh know yuh betta run fast 
 (Repeat 1) 
 (Wiz Dinero) 
 Uh-huh that's my story and I'm stickin' to it 
 What you seen and heard, I ain't admitting to it 
 It wasn't' me, you wanna call me liar, flattin' my tires 
 Seein' how you play goin' through my two way 
 You wanna tear my Polos 
 I can't stand it when you rig up them four doors 
 From Miami, me and Shaggy in the Caddi 
 Plus mami with the fatti 
 Told me, meet her backstage 
 Talkin' bout she need it badly 
 I never met her, never seen her 
 What you talkin' bout? 
 Bathroom tryna catch us when I'm walkin' out 
 Dressing room on the floor, on the table too 
 I'm telling you it wasn't me, it was Don Pooh 
 (Repeat 2) 
 I had tried to keep her from what 
 She was about to see 
 Why should she believe me 
 When I told her it wasn't me 
 (Repeat 2) 
 I had tried to keep her from what 
 She was about to see 
 Why should she believe me 
 When I told her it wasn't me
