Welcome to the mission 
 My music has got to get what it rightfully deserve 
 Shaggy 
 My music got me on a mission 
 I'm following my intuition 
 Why don't you check the composition 
 With this ya music when it hit you 
 Say you feel no pain 
 My music got me on a mission 
 I'm following my intuition 
 Why don't you check the composition 
 With this ya music when it hits you 
 My music is my mission 
 I'm here to take it around the world 
 To get the global recognition that we fully deserve 
 To every man, every woman, little boys, little girls 
 Embrace the sweet reggae culture 
 There's a lot more to learn 
 You could a be from the east 
 Could a be from the west 
 Could a be from the north 
 So could a be from the south 
 No matter where down in a the world 
 Shaggy will be at your doorstep 
 Pan you cassette down in a you deck 
 No bother think about eject 
 Better yet 
 How about you get it live and direct 
 Say mic check (mic check) 
 No sabotage mi sound check 
 You better let a lyrical genius 
 Come try intercept 
 Shaggy a say one more time 
 Vibes it a lick the reggae music them want 
 Everywhere down in a the world 
 The people jump and prance 
 Some of them no speak the language 
 But the lyrics them chant 
 Excess amount of music weh the DJ perform

 Straight up in a de place a where the people congregate 
 Say what 
 Pon the dance floor a where them love fi feel the bass

 No matter the nationality, the color, the face, the race 
 We all we want to see in a de place 
 Is nothing but a smiling face
