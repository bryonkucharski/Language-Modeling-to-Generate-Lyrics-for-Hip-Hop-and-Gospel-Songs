 Check the state of the world we live in can't you see it's a cryin' shame (Forgive them) 
 Leadership fails before it begins motivated by personal games (Forgive them) 
 Tempers flare and patience ware ten finger pointin' but who is to blame 
 Repent, repent, repent, repent 
 'Cause where two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them) 
 Two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them) 
 Fightin' for what they did not create cryin' peace while inflicting pain (Forgive them) 
 Man deciding another man's fate claiming power in their God's name (Forgive them) 
 Words of love but their actions speak hate seems like mankind has gone insane 
 Repent, repent, repent, repent 
 'Cause where two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them) 
 Two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them) 
 Bridge: Shaggy (Background Singers) 
 (They don't know) If they stick to the spot there be nothing else left to defend 
 (They don't know) Instead of finding a cure we should look for the means to prevent 
 (They don't know) We can talk to the lord ain't no need for a special event 
 Repent, repent, repent, repent 
 'Cause where two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them) 
 Two steps away from a real disaster 
 Think there a boss but a who are the master 
 Life set a pace every thing much faster 
 Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them)
