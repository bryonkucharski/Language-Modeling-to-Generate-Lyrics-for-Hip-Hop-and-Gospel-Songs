{Mmm, mmm} Enough of the break up {Yeah, hea} 
 Girl, let's deal with the make up 
 Alimony mean all the money 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha 
 Didn't I make you feel {Didn't I make you feel} 
 Like you were the only man {You were the only man} (The only man in you life) 
 Didn't I give you everything 
 That a woman possibly can {Oh, yes I did} (Mmm) 
 But for all the love I gave ya 
 It's never enough (Not enough) 
 But I'm gonna show you, baby 
 That a woman can be tough (So) 
 So come on, come on, come on, come on, and 
 So what, you have me under pressure 
 Despite the fact say in life you give me pleasure 
 I'm the only man and I possess the keys to you treasure 
 So give the contender on the trail 
 Captivate your mind, I'll make your heart grow fonder {Ooh..} 
 Still you're trying to find out whose covers that I'm under 
 So you start to wonder, heart beat like thunder {Yeah } 
 So I blow my cover 
 'Cause I'm the great pretender, girl, surrender, yeah 
 {Take it} Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
 {Oh, oh, break it} Break another little bit of my heart now, honey 
 (Hey, darling, give it up, give it up, give it up) 
 {Oh, oh, have it} Have another little bit of my heart now, baby 
 You know you got it if it makes you feel good 
 You play detective boo, want a new suit 
 Going through my pockets, searchin' for clues 
 Trying to follow me, you and your desperate crew 
 The end of this relationship was long over due 
 Now what you did was cute, girl, you spent the loot 
 Easy on the tears, oops, man, you soil my suit 
 Do yourself a favor and find a new recruit 
 And don't take it personal because you got the boot 
 You're out on the streets {Looking good} (Absolutely) 
 And you know deep down in you heart that that ain't right (Come on, come on) 
 And, oh, you never, never hear me when I cry at night {Oh oh oh oh oh } 
 I tell myself, that I can stand the pain 
 But when you hold me in your arms (Yeah) I sing it again {Say it again} 
 So come on, come on, come on, come on (So what?) and 
 {Take it} Take another little piece of my heart now, baby {Why don't you} 
 {Oh, oh, break it} Break another little bit of my heart now, honey (I don't think you know) 
 {Oh, oh, have it} Have another little bit of my heart now, baby 
 You know you got it if it makes you feel good 
 I can make you {Ooh}, you can make me {Ah} 
 Anyway you want it, baby, we can do it right 
 Jump out a the frying pan and straight down in a the fire 
 I'm Mr. Gigolo, your most notorious liar 
 Ex-amount of loving you get what me did require {Ooh } 
 Your personal attendant, well, my love is not for hire 
 Girl, search yourself, 'cause I'm you heart's desire 
 25 girls in a my life, don't want a wife, I need a lover, yeah 
 {Take it} Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
 {Oh, oh, break it} Break another little bit of my heart now, honey 
 (I got your heart, I got your heart, girl) 
 {Oh, oh, have it} (Shoop) Have another little bit of my heart now, baby 
 You know you got it if it makes you feel good 
 {Ooh, ah} 
 Rock, baby
