Uh-huh 
 Now this one goes out to my lady 
 I want me and you to go on this wonderful love rondezvous baby, 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 One on one 
 Give you a little love escapade, 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Mr. Lover 
 Candlelight, dinner for two 
 Just me and you 
 Under the moon, 
 Sailing on a summer night cruise 
 I'm here to rock your whole world baby 
 I'm da man allowed to drive you crazy 
 Set the motion to the ocean, 
 Cause some commotion 
 Girl surrender to my love potion 
 I'll hit you off now with some hot oil lotion 
 I play it safe so let me break out my Trojan 
 Leave it to me, baby 
 We can turn on the heat, baby 
 And wrinkle the sheets, baby 
 Whatever you need, lady (X2) 
 Now let me plan a day real fine 
 Hot tub, jacuzzi, caviar with some white wine 
 That's right, I'm livin' millonaire style 
 Mansion in the hills and not another house for miles 
 Now let me take you and show off my pet reptile 
 Intruders I'm gonna feed it to my rottwiler 
 No interruptions today 
 Leave it to me and have things my way 
 Leave it to me, baby 
 We can turn on the heat, baby 
 And wrinkle the sheets, baby 
 Whatever you need, lady (X2) 
 'Cause I like the way you do the things you do 
 I wanna make sweet love to you (X2) 
 I wanna send chills up your spine 
 I let you feel good inside 
 And explode just like a land mine 
 I'm here to conquer and thrill and that's my mission 
 Love-making with timing and precision 
 My skills is kickin' 
 An' like breakin' 
 Proper lovin'; leave you hummin 
 Sweet melodies of future come 
 Prepare to get soaked in sweat, yeah, girl 
 'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet 
 Leave it to me, baby 
 We can turn on the heat, baby 
 And wrinkle the sheets, baby 
 Whatever you need, baby (X2)
