What is cinco cervezas I really don't know 
 But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed 
 What is venga mi casa I really don't know 
 From the way that she smiled I could tell how the story would go 
 Chica bonita you pretty like a rose 
 Mi senorita mi love how you a pose 
 Dame un beso you hot and it shows 
 Toca mi vida and everybody knows 
 (Repeat) 
 Baby baby baby 
 Tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go 
 Ain't no need to rush it baby we can take it slow 
 I swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow 
 I notice in your eyes a certain glow 
 Have me wondering now 
 Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same 
 I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name 
 I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame 
 Your love is like an everlasting flame 
 (Hook chorus) 
 Lovely lady would you 
 Please give me a signal so I know you understand 
 Maybe I should start by making gestures with my hand 
 Girl you're like a rising star and I'm your biggest fan 
 My sweet bonita diva with the tan 
 Got me thinking baby 
 We could make a life together on the ocean shore 
 Paradise is where you are I'm ready to explore 
 Can never get enough of you it's all about amour 
 And happiness is knocking at your door 
 (Hook chorus)
