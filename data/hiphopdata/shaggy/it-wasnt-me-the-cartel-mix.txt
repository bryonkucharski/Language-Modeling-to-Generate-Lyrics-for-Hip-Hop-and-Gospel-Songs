(Feat. Ricardo Ducent) 
 (Yo man) Yo 
 (Open up man) What do you want man? 
 (My girl just caught me) 
 You let her catch you? 
 (I don't know how I let this happen) 
 With who? 
 (The girl next door, you know?) Man... 
 (I don't know what to do) Say it wasn't you 
 (All right) 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget 
 That I had given her an extra key 
 All this time she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 How you can grant the woman access to your villa 
 Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow 
 You better watch your back before she turn into a killer 
 Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner 
 To be a true player you have to know how to play 
 If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay 
 Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim 
 And you tell her baby no way 
 But she caught me on the counter 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Saw me banging on the sofa 
 (It wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the shower 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She even caught me on camera 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She saw the marks on my shoulder 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Heard the words that I told her 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Heard the screams getting louder 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She stayed until it was over 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget 
 That I had given her an extra key 
 All this time she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see 
 Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me 
 Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on 
 Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex 
 As funny as it be by you, it not that complex 
 Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs 
 You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past 
 Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass 
 Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun 
 You know you better run fast 
 But she caught me on the counter 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Saw me banging on the sofa 
 (It wasn't me) 
 I even had her in the shower 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She even caught me on camera 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She saw the marks on my shoulder 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Heard the words that I told her 
 (It wasn't me) 
 Heard the screams getting louder 
 (It wasn't me) 
 She stayed until it was over 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget 
 That I had given her an extra key 
 All this time she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 How could I forget; 
 That I had given her an extra key 
 All this time she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me 
 Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused 
 I've been listenin' to your reasonin' 
 It makes no sense at all 
 We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused 
 You may think that you're a player 
 But you're completely lost 
 Honey came in and she caught me red-handed 
 Creeping with the girl next door 
 Picture this we were both butt-naked 
 Banging on the bathroom floor 
 How could I forget 
 That I had given her an extra key 
 All this time she was standing there 
 She never took her eyes off me
