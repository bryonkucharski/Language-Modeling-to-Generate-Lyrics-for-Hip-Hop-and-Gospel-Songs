She's definitely mine until the end of time 
 (Talkin' 'bout the sweet little girl, hmm) 
 My darling princess (Huh, huh) 
 I gotta get Brian and Tony Gold on this one 
 (In the whole wide world) 
 Allow me to express my love 
 Lady, you're definitely mine, Shaggy 
 She was a geenie and a perfect work of art 
 She had a certain light that overcame the dark 
 I could imagine this love to fall apart 
 My baby, my love, one who won my heart 
 She's mine 
 She's mine (Ooh, mine) 
 She's mine (Oh, the girl is mine) 
 She's mine (Oh, mine) 
 I say forget the tricks, let my feelings intercept, yes 
 Let them know you hold the status of a princess 
 My love, my love, you have the key to my fortress 
 Refer to you as your royal highness, yes 
 God bless, simply flawless 
 Me alone fi put the egg them in a you basket 
 Another woman in a mi life, there's no contest 
 Girl, you got my heart, you know I got to confess 
 Huh, the way that she moved was like she guided through the breeze 
 With every step she took she made my poor heart freeze 
 Sweetness she portrays 
 Girl, my love gets stronger day by day 
 She's mine (Till the end of time) 
 She's mine (My baby love, you are mine) 
 She's mine (Girl they say she's mine) 
 She's mine 
 I say goodness gracious me 
 She's got me on my knees, now I am beggin' please 
 Why don't we take a trip down to the Florida keys 
 Let's spend some Gs and set your mind at ease, ugh, yeah 
 I'm here to make your life better, yeah 
 Express yourself in all your love letter, yeah 
 I'm here to give you extreme pleasure, Jah 
 I'm the man you wrote about down in your ledger, Jah 
 Hey, she was a geenie and a perfect work of art, huh, huh (Yeah)
