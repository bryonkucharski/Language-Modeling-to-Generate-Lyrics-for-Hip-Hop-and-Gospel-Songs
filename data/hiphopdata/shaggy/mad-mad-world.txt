It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 (What's wrong with us?) 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 Rough life, nuff crime, youth them a do hard time 
 No guides, no sign, walking on a thin like 
 Sentenced, no trial, victim of a profile 
 No hope, more fight, wonder why we're hostile 
 False prophet make profit, focused on them pocket 
 White collar false docket, door open, can't lock it 
 Politics, polytricks, equal econometricks 
 (Where is the justice?) 
 Death toll rising, sex commercializing 
 Barely surviving, future jeopardizing 
 No compromising, hope paralyzing 
 Rules need revising, why is it surprising? 
 Got to heed the warning, see the storms are forming 
 Not the time for stalling, look around it's so appauling 
 It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 (Mad, crazy you know) 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 Nuclear warfare, satellites everywhere 
 Mothers on welfare, what about medicare? 
 Ethnic cleansing, freedom pending 
 Government spending, who are they defending? 
 Bankrolls on poles, anything to enroll 
 Spotlight's their goal, price paid their soul 
 Step back, retrack, notice where your life's at 
 (Where was it worth it?) 
 Got to heed the warning, see the storm that's forming 
 Not the time for stalling', look around it's so appauling' 
 Poor is the mentality that disregard humanity 
 Say no to this insanity, create a new reality 
 It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 It's a mad mad world that we're living in 
 Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in 
 Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High 
 'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive 
 Rough life, nuff crime, youth them a do hard time 
 No guides, no sign, walking on a thin like 
 Sentenced, no trial, victim of a profile 
 No hope, more fight, wonder why we're hostile 
 False prophet make profit, focused on them pocket 
 White collar false docket, doors open can't lock it 
 Politics, polytricks, equal econometricks
