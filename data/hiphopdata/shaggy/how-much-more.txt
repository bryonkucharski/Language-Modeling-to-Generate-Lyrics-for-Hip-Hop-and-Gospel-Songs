Now everyday another youth hitch up in a gutter, mmm 
 Now I man talk and I man stutter 
 Can't understand say you fi try and help the youth them make them get big, what 
 Say how much more ghetto youth have fi suffer 
 How much more live without bread and butter 
 How much more body we a go discover 
 Have fi live together every brother and we sister 
 Stop suffer 
 Me say 
 Mm, Jah pan the land a so we live a so we die 
 Can't find the answer to the question why 
 Me say the sky is the limit so you try touch the sky 
 Put your trust in the God now Jah rasta for I... selasi 
 ...Hear how me cry and give me a bly 
 Never trouble you so why you want shoot the i 
 Too much wicked man deh 'bout ya oh me oh my 
 Now feel it inna me heart when a siren a cry 
 How much more ghetto youth have fi suffer 
 How much more live without bread and butter 
 How much more body we a go discover 
 Have fi live together every brother and we sister 
 Stop suffer 
 Me say 
 Easy no youth you love fi shoot 
 Now you deh a prison a suck off man flute 
 Mama say you brut you living like a coot 
 Jah Jah never send no life pan no parachute 
 Bad company make the I take the wrong route 
 Now you de behind the bar in a crisp stripe suit 
 And everyday another man a try pick your fruit 
 Now them have you pan them nosel like a brand new recruit 
 Like a butter pon a piece of hot bread 
 A so your blood run when a shot lick your head 
 Don't you think it's better living than it is to be dead 
 And in the Bible it is written and so it should be said 
 Thou shall not kill neither blood must shed 
 And yet still you wouldn't mind full me up the lead 
 And tell me if your conscience no burn you when you go a bed 
 And now you can't sleep you de a think 'bout the dead 
 Life it rough inna the ghetto 
 Everyday me neighborhood a run like soweto 
 Over the badness is like you no let go 
 The other day them shot me bredrin in front of esso 
 Take away him wallet with about twenty peso 
 After them shot him them dump him over there so 
 And all me a warn is like me never say so 
 Me say 
 Mm, Jah pan the land a so we live a so we die (ME) 
 Can't find the answer to the question why 
 Me say the sky is the limit so you try touch the sky 
 Put your trust in the God now Jah rasta for I... selasi 
 ...Hear how me cry and give me a bly 
 Never trouble you so why you want shoot the i 
 Too much wicked man deh 'bout ya oh me oh my 
 Now feel it inna me heart when a siren a cry
