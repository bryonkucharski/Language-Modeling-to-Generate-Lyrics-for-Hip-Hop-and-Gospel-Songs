 (Verse 1: Fat Joe) 
 Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, woo, yeah, slow down baby 
 Let you know from the get go I don't go down lady 
 I wanna chick with thick hips 
 That licks her lips 
 She can be the office type or like to strip 
 Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye 
 But you talk too much man your ruinin' my high 
 Don't wanna lose the feelin' 
 Cause the roof an ceilin 
 Is on fire and you lookin' 
 Good for the gettin' 
 I'm a rider 
 Hooker in a hoodie or a linner I'm a provider 
 You should see the jewelery on my women 
 And I'm livin' it up 
 The squad stay feelin' the truck 
 With chicks that's willin' to triz with us uh 
 You say you gotta man and you're in love 
 But what's love 
 Gotta do with a little menage 
 After the party 
 Me and you 
 Could just slide for a few 
 And she could come too 
 What's Love 
 (Verse 2: Fat Joe) 
 Yeah, uh, yeah, yo, mommy, I know you got issues 
 You gotta man 
 But you need to understand 
 That you got somethin' with you 
 Ass is fat, frame is little 
 Tatoo on your chest with his name in the middle 
 Uh, I'm not a hater I just crush a lot 
 And the way you shake your booty I don't want you to stop 
 You need to come a little closer 
 (You need to come a little closer) 
 And let me put you under my arm like a Don is 
 Supposed ta (supposed ta) 
 Please believe 
 You leave with me 
 We'd be freakin' all night like we was on E 
 You need to trust the God and jump in the car 
 For a little hard 8 at the Taj Mahal 
 What's Love 
 (Verse 3: Fat Joe, Ashanti) 
 (Fat Joe) 
 Yeah, uh, yo, I stroll in the club with my hat down 
 Michael Jack style (he he) 
 Hot 7 who the Mack now? 
 Not my fault 'cause they love the kid 
 Might be the chain or the whip 
 I don't know what it is 
 We just party and bullshit 
 Come on mommy put your body in motion 
 You gotta nigga open 
 You came here with the heart to cheat 
 So you need to sing the song with me 
 All my ladies come on 
 (Ashanti) (Fat Joe) 
 When I look in your eyes there's no stopin' me 
 I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me (Uh-huh) 
 Don't want your stacks (Yeah) 
 Just break my back (Uh) 
 Gonna cut you no slack (Whoo) 
 'Cause I'm on it like that (Uh, Come on)

 And put it (Yeah, Yeah, Y'All)

 On me (I'm a put it on ya girl)
