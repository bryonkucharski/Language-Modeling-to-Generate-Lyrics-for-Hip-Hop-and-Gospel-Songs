High heels gosh you look sexy 
 I'd steal a touch if you let me 
 I'm just dyin' to kick it with you girl 
 Hey boo show me you're ready 
 Lips looking juicy like cherry 
 I can almost taste your flavor girl 
 But it seems like you're the wrong type 
 Don't you ever get upset girl I'd like to see you sweat 
 It just feels like you're too uptight 
 Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live 
 I wanna a freaky girl somebody just like me 
 Someone who understands just what a player needs 
 Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me 
 A very naughty girl that's what I need 
 Handcuffs can you get freaky 
 How far will you go to please me 
 Whips and chains girl are you down with that 
 Strange places searching for pleasure 
 I want you to meet me wherever 
 Wearing just an overcoat and hat 
 Or was I right you're the wrong type 
 You don't ever get upset I ain't never seen you sweat 
 It just feels like you're too uptight 
 Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live 
 Want a girl to love me up hug me up give it to me right 
 Swing from me shower curtain and from me light 
 Hot piece of loving carry me right through the night 
 I can't take the pressure when you put pan me ha 
 Well me love it when you ride pan me ha 
 Really love it when you climb pam me ha 
 Cause me know you naw go hide from me ha 
 Freaky girl me hipe pan it hee
