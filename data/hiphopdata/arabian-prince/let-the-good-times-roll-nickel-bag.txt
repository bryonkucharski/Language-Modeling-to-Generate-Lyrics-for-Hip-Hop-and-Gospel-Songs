Life is a jungle, I'm a hunter who's lossin' 
 I'm not livin' a life that I'm choosin' 
 But I wake up everyday livin' large 
 'Cause I don't play 
 Games with people or names 
 And all the suckers they fear no shame 
 I'm told ... everybody here is bold 
 We let the good times roll 
 People smokin' up to lies like a nickel bag 
 Like money or cash they never had 
 Knowin' nothing about livin' in a fantasy 
 Spendin' all there time survivin' in reality 
 Streets, schools for the residents 
 Home for drugs and the people that are sellin' it 
 Kickin' back playin' the walls 
 Crusin' set 
 And let the good times roll 
 Rollin' down the streets you might get jacked 
 By another brother ... why is that? 
 Critics always puttin' the blame on the gangs of society 
 It shouldn't take the blame 
 Of the violence and the drugs and the killings 
 People in the government don't know how we're livin' 
 I'm still, 'cause I got soul... 
 I'll let the good times roll 
 Chillin' in the park shootin' hoop with the homeboys 
 It was a 3-point turn-around I hear much noise 
 Cop rolled in 
 "Up against the wall" 
 Turn around so I can get a picture of y'all" 
 I ain't in no gang, and never intended to be 
 So why in the hell you want to go and get rough with me? 
 Take a picture for your black pack 
 I'm photogenic, but I ain't with that 
 Why you want to go and mess with us anyways? 
 'Cause I'm a nigger in the park with a group on a Sunday? 
 No way... all it is is a game that you play 
 Tryin' to keep a brother like me down 
 Even though I don't mess around 
 'Cause I'm told... I'll let the good times roll
