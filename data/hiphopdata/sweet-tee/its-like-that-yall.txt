(Rolling tape) 
 Hurby, my headphones are not loud enough 
 (All right 
 Yo Dre, pump it up somethin' 
 How's that?) 
 Yeah, let's do this 
 Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move 
 It's the thriller to kill, 'cause I got nothin' to lose 
 I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin' at me 
 And oh, how they screamed (Go Sweet Tee!) 
 Just wanted nothin' but fun, 'cause I'm second to none 
 And I'm here in the flesh to show how it is to be done 
 So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop 
 And if your mom starts beefin', say, "Mom, do the Whop" 
 Hop on the dance floor, dance to the music 
 Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it 
 I write rhymes, and to the world I'm givin' 
 (Get busy, Sweet Tee) That's the way I'm livin' 
 Leather or lace as I step in the place 
 People come to say hi 'cause they know my face 
 And you know I'm stylin', nails I'm filin' 
 Standin' on stage, smilin', profilin' 
 Lean, mean, breakin' out on the scene 
 Me and the girls steppin' fresh outta Queens 
 So if you want to have a ball, give me a call 
 I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all 
 Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want 
 Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt 
 When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy 
 Some think I play games cause my name is Toi 
 Back to raise hell, I got records to sell 
 I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell 
 Never takin' a loss, weak rappers I toss 
 Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss 
 Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control 
 Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul 
 Never settle for less, god is my witness 
 Jog every day for physical fitness 
 Climbin' higher, I'll never retire 
 Rap so hot, they start three alarm fires 
 But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm 
 I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm 
 Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin' it 
 I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin' it 
 Five foot eight, standin' ten feet tall 
 And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all 
 Slam on the jam just as hard as you can 
 While I rock the mic with my all-girl band 
 And you know I'm clever, taken down never 
 Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror 
 My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set 
 'Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get 
 And I hope I'm told, when my record's old 
 That they all got sold, and my jam went gold 
 I give it all I got, and all I got I give 
 I take no shorts, that's the way I live 
 Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on 
 (Long live the queen) Well, I'm a live real long 
 I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me 
 Keep my beeper beepin', so the fellas don't lose me 
 Sly as a fox, sippin' juice on the rocks 
 When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped 
 When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better 
 Keep that in mind and don't you forget that 
 I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall 
 And you want to know why? It's like that y'all 
 Cruisin' down the street in my jett-black Volvo 
 Rockin' to the radio playin' [song name] 
 Heads all turn as I drive by 
 As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say (hi) 
 Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco 
 The music's pumpin' and the people screamin' (Ho!) 
 The place is packed and people shakin' their bodies 
 The crowd outside is screamin' (We want to party!) 
 Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began the rampage 
 They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-gauge 
 Rocked anyway, 'cause I'm bad, and I'm bold 
 Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole 
 If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz 
 Toes are tappin' while I'm rappin', 'cause I'm in showbiz 
 Autographs I sign while they stand in line 
 I remain number one till I'm 109 
 I play no games, and you know I ain't frontin' 
 Let me know if you want to start a little somethin' 
 Why? 'Cause I'm a heavyweight, I go for it all 
 I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all
