I got a thorn in my side and I wish someone would pull it 
 I'm thinking about giving this motherfucker a bullet 
 But I ain't going out like that 
 I got too much at stake 
 To let myself be brought down by these snakes 
 They fake 
 And everybody know it 
 Hell, they be tryin' they best not to show it 
 But it coming out like sweat from they pores 
 I sees 'em everywhere with these 5 dollar hoes 
 Callin' for a war but they don't want no trouble 
 If I really had my way I'd spank that ass on the double 
 These niggas mumble, Conversations with they partners 
 But, they best-a take vacations 
 Before the catch hot ones 
 They whereabouts, I always know 
 And little do they know I got niggas ready to blow up they homes 
 But I'm-a tell my niggas to freeze that 
 Ain't no need to go to jail or hell behind these fucking thieves, black 
 Fuck that (See these niggas ain't right, it's about time we all get hype) 
 We'll see 'em on the street when it's meant to be when the time is right 
 But until then, stay cool only time'll tell 
 When it's time to make these motherfuckers raise up and bail 
 Set sail 
 Get the fuck up off the block nigga 
 Or better yet, gimme what the fuck you got 
 I want everything 
 From the dope to G's, expensive clothes, elbows in vogues and Lexus keys 
 We sendin' letters to bitches who were about to get-get it 
 Sealed it with kisses and blew their brains when they read it 
 Let it 
 Be your first fuckin' lesson 
 Zero tolerance for niggas disrespecting leather connections... 
 Now I hear they got several niggas out to get me 
 Puttin' out hits G, but to me they talkin' shit, see 
 'Cause they ain't holdin' a motherfuckin' thing 
 Neither him, his hood or his motherfucking gang 
 They let gunshots ring 
 Every day and every night 
 But they ain't hittin' shit, 'cause they ain't hittin' Mike 
 They try with all their might, but I watch 'em all fall, big or small 
 I'm-a fade 'em all, fool 
 Call me crazy but I don't give a damn 
 It's obvious to me, that they don't know who I am, cause see 
 Them payback niggas don't go for no losses 
 I do some wicked ass shit and watch niggas fall in coffins, often 
 So don't try and test the Black, my knock 
 I bust back into the motherfuckin' ??New Jack?? I stack 
 Every night and every day 
 And don't give a damn to what these hoe-ass niggas say 
 (Chorus 2nd version) 
 We're sending letters to bitches who were about to get-get it 
 Sealed it with kisses and blew their brains when they read it 
 Let it 
 Be your first fucking lesson 
 Zero tolerance for disrespect leather connections 
 I'm exing 
 These motherfuckers out like wrong answers 
 Get a grip, I got a hold on your ass like cancer 
 Make 'em dance, I make niggas do gymnastics 
 Pull and try to cash this 
 Set 'em down in caskets, yeah 
 It's been a whole year and I still ain't fall down 
 My shit still circulate through y'all town 
 It's a small town but, compared to other cities 
 It really don't matter cause the situation's still shitty 
 Or will they get the motherfucking picture 
 And if I shoot and miss, then I'm-a have to get ya, hit ya 
 With something real, something harder to steal 
 Something serious nigga, that I know you'll feel, now 
 How many motherfuckers gonna fall when I come around 
 How many motherfuckers like y'all gonna hear the sound 
 I thunder on your motherfucking back 
 Like a whip when I flip 
 You'll hear that bitch crack your back 
 You bitch ass niggas don't want no static 
 I'll leave you feenin' like an addict when I work my magic 
 It's like voodoo 
 Coming from that swamp 
 I might do you 
 You'll get your ass stomped 
 (Repeat 2nd chorus)
