Don't get mad when you see me with my prostitute

 I can't believe the power I possess that make you so mad 
 If it ain't the pimp music, it's the game I have 
 You know how stupid you look at me when you hatin', my friend 
 I'll prolly have to blast yo ass if I see you again 
 You on a bus stop pushin that bitch till it came 
 You say goodbye for 30 minutes cause you gots no game 
 Who you talkin' to like that, don't question me ho 
 You the bitch in kindergarten

 Ho I'm a pimp I'm from Pomona I got game I got class

 I hear you pimpin' now, huh? Well ain't that nice 
 Ain't never sent a prostitute nowhere a day in your life 
 And tell your homies I was at a music grindin 
 With my prostitutes standin right out front 
 Then tellin' me you had two of them punk 
 Don't, fight the pimpin'

 Her name was bitch, 'cause she fucked for free 
 But now when Suga met her not after fuckin' with me 
 Oh no, cause either you gon be a run-down-the-hill-and-get-some bitch 
 Or walk-down-the-hill-and-get-em-all hustler, so come on 
 With ya bad self in high heels on, come on 
 Lips, hips, fingertips on the stroll, come on 
 Respect the game bitch, do as you're told 
 'Cause I been pimpin' prostitutes since 17 years old 
 Done seen LB, ?????, Warren Y, AY, A-Cap, Norlean Clear 
 Patrick Camp, ?????????? graduated from state 
 And got my game from all the freaks gonna wreck my case 
 It's my prerogative, run my game bitch and it's gonna come back 
 Pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp P-I-M-P positive 
 Look for the holder knock (knock) 
 Give her the sugar lock (lock) 
 Get at the ho, strip the ho 
 Now I got ho on the cock (cock) 
 Now how fine do I gotta get? 
 To have a prostitute servin' me the way she do 
 Now how fine do I gotta get? 
 If I wanna wait 5 years to give you the blues 
 Now how fine do I gotta get? 
 If I kick it with her would gettin' bang nigga what's my name 
 Now how fine do I gotta get? 
 If I jack off with a sock in the sunshine homie 
 And you see that yellow spot 
 I'm a full-fledged pimp, I made two hos faint 
 But I'ma listen to yo ass say what I can and I can't 
 Fuck that! Man this Laneway, straight from the dirt 
 And I'll beat a bitch ass till she respects my work 
 Old tired ass nigga don't see she wanna be snatched 
 And wonder why them bitches leavin' with no dap and no snacks 
 And rather sit here with no cigarettes and no beer 
 Complainin about how you can't pay yo bills 
 And the bitch right here
