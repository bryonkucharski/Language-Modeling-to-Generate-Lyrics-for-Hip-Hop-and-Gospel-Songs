Good evening, I'm Suga Free and you 
 I don't know who the fuck you man 
 But I'ma tell you like this, ain't no tricks livin' here 
 Ain't not suckas livin' here, ain't no punk ass hoes livin' here 
 'Cause you see baby we about to get paid 
 And baby we about gettin' ours the right way and the real way 
 You waste my time, I waste your time 
 You lie to me, I lie to you, fifty fifty thang right 
 So this is the gospel, Suga Frees gospel, street gospel
