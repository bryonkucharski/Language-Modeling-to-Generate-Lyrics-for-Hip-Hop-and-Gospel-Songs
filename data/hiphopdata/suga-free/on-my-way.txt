She talks to me of wisdom 
 We walk beside the sun 
 Rainy night and rainy day 
 Might as well keep away 
 I've got trouble on the run 
 Weariness 
 Weariness has left my friend 
 My head goes round 
 And round again 
 On my way and I might be late 
 I don't worry 
 Every thing can wait 
 She talks to me of feelin' 
 Feelin' good 
 And feelin' better 
 Once upon a time I thought 
 I could love around and not get caught 
 But I'd never met her 
 Weariness, waeriness has left my friend 
 Head goes round 
 And round again 
 I'm on my way 
 And I might be late 
 I don't worry every thing can wait 
 Do you mean 
 When you say you'll be mine 
 I want you to be mine 
 All mine 
 Weariness 
 Weariness has left my friend 
 My head goes round 
 And round again 
 On my way and I might be late 
 I don't worry 
 Every thing can wait 
 Every thing can wait
