Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner 
 Ain't no telling who my money for 
 Got my dope from cross the border 
 Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news 
 My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice 
 Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape 
 Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking 
 Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing 
 Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name 
 My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain 
 Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling 
 On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky 
 Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston 
 Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie 
 You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie 
 Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget 
 And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic 
 My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging 
 With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Hut one, hut two 
 Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Hut one, hut two 
 Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham 
 A new school player laced with the old gift gab 
 And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass 
 So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two 
 And anything good hurts and I cried 
 Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face 
 Or I choose to not do this around you 
 See ho you like a brain aneurysm 
 Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em 
 Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs 
 No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom 
 Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play 
 And the hard head that make a soft ass played out 
 Will forgive and forget yesterday 
 Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac 
 Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid 
 So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world 
 P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing 
 But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho 
 Keep an eye on bottom bitch too 
 Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane 
 Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid 
 Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier 
 To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle 
 This is done by choice, not by force 
 I ain't asking, I'm telling you 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Hut one, hut two 
 Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?) 
 Hut one, hut two 
 Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me) 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? 
 Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
