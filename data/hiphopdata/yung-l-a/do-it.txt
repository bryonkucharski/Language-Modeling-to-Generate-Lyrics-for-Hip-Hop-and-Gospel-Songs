Why you painted that motherfucker? You didn't have to do it 
 Why you flood yo wife? You know that you didn't have to do it 
 It was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it 
 It was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it 
 It's Gucci Mane izay, you know we overdo it 
 They back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it 
 They got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it 
 They know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it 
 Don't need no stylist, I'm so fresh, I didn't even have to do it 
 My car cost half a million dollars and I didn't have to do it 
 I paint that bitch instantly and put them Forgies to it 
 I merk a nigga instantly, this shit here more than music 
 As far as me, them niggas phony, that's balony music 
 These niggas so corny I'd be baloney if I listened to it 
 I paint my car soon as I get it, bitch I gotta do it 
 And get how many, can even a man take car paint that's on a Buick 
 I make a bitch feel insecure but she still listen to it 
 She in the car, don't know what it is but ain't like she knew 
 You with a nigga with a check, this a Rari not a Vette 
 This ain't that same little lick that he got, man this Bentley cost 3-20 man 
 It's Gucci, I got plenty, me in city, we be killin' shit 
 Soon as you take drop man it's gon be trinity and it's have her 50 
 I have my mind on a V, I'm trappin out abandoned buildings 
 They say the rims on my Charger bitch are bigger than they children

 Groupies I don't give a fuck, I'm flippin! 
 I pour lean and some blue Kool-Aid and now I'm feelin' like lipsy 
 Took my car service to Slawson, bought 10 Patriot from the 60's
