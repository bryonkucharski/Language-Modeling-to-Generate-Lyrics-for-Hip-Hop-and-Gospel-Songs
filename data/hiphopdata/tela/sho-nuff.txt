 It was this bitch that I knew back from '86 
 Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
 Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
 Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go 
 I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
 How the hell you been since I had no job 
 Hum, why don't you give me some 
 Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
 Nah, all of that was on the couch 
 No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin in gold 
 It's cold On The Outside Lookin' In (Brrrr) 
 You'd besta make yourself worthy 
 'Cause I got a click of niggaz ready to get their johnson very dirty 
 You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
 Ain't this a bitch 
 I remember when you would not give me shit 
 Now you down for them habits 
 Put your numbers on them naturals 
 Make it snappy 'cause I got to go to the bathroom 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothe sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love 
 (Eightball) 
 No different from the rest 
 She's just an ordinary hoe 
 Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
 Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin ass in the mix 
 Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
 Niggaz in love 
 Can't stay out the club 
 All in the hoe's face 
 But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 I see him in the back 
 Countin' up that chedder 
 Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
 I think I know one 
 I remember you, oh yes I do 
 Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
 What time the club close, at 3 
 What's up, you comin' with me 
 We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
 You want some cheese 
 Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
 Hoes around my nuts like knats 
 Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats 
 For real baby 
 Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho nuff 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothe sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what? 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff 
 Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love

 Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe 
 Wants to get close to me 
 A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
 Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
 Check yo' bitch 
 In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
 I can tell they freaky without three guesses 
 Oh yes it's very true 
 Your bitches be needin me, leavin' you 
 Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
 Let her loose or let her remain 
 Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
 A bigger name 
 Look, this thang with bigger game 
 And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 Tryin' to trick me 
 So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
 She still hit me 
 Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 Really just don't plan on takin' it out 'cause I 
 MJ fuckin' G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin 
 They ass with no clothes like some pros, sho nuff 
 Hoes with no clothes sho nuff
