I woke up out that coma two thousand and one 
 'Bout the same time Dre dropped "2001" 
 Three years later the album is done 
 Aftermath presents "Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One" 
 Rap critics politicking, want to know the outcome 
 "Ready to Die" "Reasonable Doubt" and "Doggystyle" in one 
 I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done 
 Dre behind that G series and "All Eyez on Me" 
 I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine 
 Working with Dr. Dre was a (dream) 
 I had visions of making a classic, then my world turned black 
 Like I was staring out of Stevie Wonders glasses 
 It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West 
 Coming back from his fatal accident to beat-making and rapping 
 But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that 
 And it's goin' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back 
 Russian and this 40 ounce, letting the ink from my pen bleed 
 Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream) 
 Aaliyah had a (dream) Left Eye had a (dream) 
 So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams) 
 ('Cause I love you, I love you, I love you) 
 (I-high love you) 
 I had dreams, of fucking, a R&B bitch like Mya 
 When I saw that ass on the front of that King 
 Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things 
 So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams 
 Good girls never give it up 
 But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica 
 Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze 
 Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze 
 Used to dream of being "Unsigned Hype", till I was crushed by Dave Mays 
 Almost let my pen fall asleep on the page 
 Daydreaming yesterday, dozing off backstage 
 I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay 
 So I walked over, heard Jam Master say 
 "It's a hard knock life, then you pass away" 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open 
 Cause a dream is kin to your last breath 
 Russian and this 40 ounce, letting the ink from my pen bleed 
 Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream) 
 Aaliyah had a (dream) Left Eye had a (dream) 
 So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams) 
 ('Cause I love you, I love you, I love you) 
 (I-high love you) 
 The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm living through 
 The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm giving you 
 Who walked through the White House without a business suit 
 Compton had jheri curl dripping on Ronald Reagan's shoes 
 Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues 
 Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazing Clue 
 It was all a dream like Big said it'd be 
 Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality 
 Rap phenomenon, defying the rules of gravity 
 Studied all the classics, start revising my strategy 
 Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it 
 Head in the clouds, wondering where the hell Marvin Gaye went 
 How do I say this, I'm living for my son 
 But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun 
 Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun 
 The war to be a rap legend, has just begun 
 Russian and this 40 ounce, letting the ink from my pen bleed 
 Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream) 
 Aaliyah had a (dream) Left Eye had a (dream) 
 So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams) 
 ('Cause I love you, I love you, I love you) 
 (I-high love you) 
 This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price 
 The sister of Venus and Serena Williams 
 Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton 
 Sunday, September 14th, 2003, rest in peace 
 (I brought you all my dreams) 
 ('Cause I love you, I love you, I love you) 
 (I-high love you)
