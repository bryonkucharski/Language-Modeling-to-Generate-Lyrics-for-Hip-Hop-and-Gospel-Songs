Girls in the club showin love 
 Shakin their ass in the club nigger what 
 (Fancy Cow Lee) 
 Shit how bout all you got damn rootin tootin rap shootin son of a bitches 
 I'm out here to tell you my name is Fancy Cow Lee 
 And got dammit I don't like rap 
 But I like that got damn Teller 
 That got damn Teller know he got himself together 
 That damn sho nuff 
 Reason why I like him 
 Cause shit I can pretty much relate to him 
 Shit I pimp hoes 
 All around the got damn county 
 Shit I go around here to ah Truckers street 
 And get my money from Samanther and and and and old Tree Selmer 
 I go on down the block two and three down the road 
 And get the rest of my money from old ah Peggy Sue and Murle 
 And I come on back round before I hit the old farm 
 And collect the rest of my cheeze from old Desaco over there 
 And shit bout time I get through with all my freakin rounds 
 I got just about a hundred and twenty-two and thirteen cent 
 Just enough to get me some treapin tards for Peggy 
 If y'all don't know everything about pimpin' 
 Y'all need to be tryin' to holler at Teller 
 Got damn Teller 
 He got his self together 
 Girls in the club showin love 
 Shakin there ass in the club nigger what

 This is Fancy Cow Lee 
 And I'll be shootin round at y'all at the bar got dammit 
 Don't matter here like y'all say it 
 Peace
