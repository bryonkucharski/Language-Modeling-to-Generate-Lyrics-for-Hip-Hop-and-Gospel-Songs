Pull your g-string to the side baby let me take a glance 
 The way you shake it baby girl you know your eyes put me in a trance 
 I'm giving you a second chance 
 To get the money in your hands 
 Baby for a table dance 
 (Tela) 
 I say baby how you doing 
 Acting like you new in 
 Town I done seen you around what you pursuin 
 All in love where you being 
 Ain't been really seeing 
 Your ass in the club 
 Say what just working weekends 
 I know you making endz 
 Got yourself a benz nah that's that lexus 
 Protected with bubble lens 
 The party's where the doe at 
 Go on and get the Moet 
 That's how it be being low key in V.I.P 
 Luckily I feel your breeze 
 Strawberries and whip cream 
 Your body is top of me 
 What time you leave 'bout a quarter three 
 Go get your girls I get my guys 
 We have an orgy 
 You feeling me that's kinda nice 
 Hurry up don't you see my niggas ready to leave 
 They been smoking since this eve and they full of remy 
 Hey baby I wanna hit that thang 
 Get that thang 
 Split that dime 
 While you lying on your side 
 You in front I'm behind 
 Bullshit jog money talks 
 I could get with any broad but I want your panties off 
 Why you having any thoughts 
 Same bitch that I knew back in 86 
 College bitch college dick just for kicks 
 Did some flicks with some chicks 
 Hold up hon you ain't slick 
 Why you gotta go and split 
 Tela's in the club won't you show a little love shit 
 Do some special shit you know like you never have 
 'Cause I'm a special playboy rap a lottin with Brad 
 I'll make you laugh if you give me ass inside of a cab 
 Better yet the limo while my niggas are there 
 What you telling me 
 You want to have sex with me 
 You and ebony and melody because I am celebrity 
 I love it when y'all all come and lick on my balls 
 Take me to the dressing room and ain't got on no draws 
 Take it out pussy blau 
 Damn girl wow! 
 I don't know really know if I can handle this without 
 A crowd of compliments 
 Bring some juice and supplements 
 'Cause we be doing other shit 
 Yeah you know that other shit 
 When I'm in it I'll be in it 
 When I hit it try to dent it 
 Not a minute 
 Where you going 
 We're not finished made her sing it 
 Oh yeah (fades)
