 My girl Cheng Chang with the gold rang 
 Half black Japanese lived in Japan 
 Just came back from greece doin' big thangs 
 Had a shoe with a lee, that's what Lidge claim 
 Sex on the beach dinner with the flame 
 What we wearin this weak lynon by Caron 
 Glarin starin' at the views in sight 
 Bermuda wit skubas gonna smash tonight 
 So I drink a little rim take a little swim 
 Make a little film can you shake it like a limb 
 No lights on him candles keep it dim 
 Take you to the gym and work you out like a pimp 
 Icing on the cake for the escape 
 Baby wait come here look at the moon make love to the lake 
 Feelin' great pas porse out the steak 
 Me and my date we some heavy weights, a steady weight... 
 I think I want to you much 
 And if you don't know what to do
