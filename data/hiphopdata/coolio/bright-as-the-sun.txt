Starlight 
 Starbright 
 First star I see tonight 
 I wish I may 
 I wish I might 
 Get this lick I try to hit tonight... 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Everytime I think about it I still can't understand 
 What night these niggaz think they don't need a plan 
 'Cause if you don't have a plan, then 
 Tell me what you got 
 The old get rich quick scheme 
 Or bust her ass Broc 
 Niggaz be punkin' out loc 
 Dyin' over nothin' 
 It's the ghetto witchdoctor with another loco potion 
 Hickory 
 Dickory 
 Thievory 
 Trickory 
 Povorty 
 Misory 
 Pleads to insanoty 
 Homocide 
 Rivalry 
 Garnd theft buglory 
 Purgory 
 Emergency surgory 
 A.P.B. 
 They lookin' for a G 
 You ran through a field 
 Hopped a fence 
 And climbed a tree 
 9-1-1 
 Here they come for him 
 Nigga wit' a gun 
 Now your ass is done 
 Ain't nowhere to hide 
 Ain't nowhere to run 
 'Cause the helicopter light's as bright as the sun... 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 It seems nowadays 
 Just to get some respect 
 Ya gots to roll a Lex and collect a fat check 
 Or come around the corner on 3 Hobbit 
 Blockin' up the street 
 Flossin' back on your keys 
 An' everybody's sayin' you're the man loc 
 Never broke 
 An' high off that pream old smoke 
 Sippin' in the seat 
 Rollin' in the ragtop Chevy '63 
 The p.i.m.p. 
 On top of the game 
 But now you're gettin' laid 
 'Cause that gak weed o' yay is playin' tricks on your brain 
 You're lookin' for a way out 
 Before your game play out 
 'Cause once you game play out 
 Ya lose all ya' kriz out 
 Late one night you was rollin' down the block 
 With a half a pint of yat and the twenty dollar rock 
 One-time got behind you and they told you to stop 
 But you kept rollin' 'cause ya said you wasn't broke 
 Out like a sucka 
 You dumb mothafucka 
 Now the chase is on 
 An' here go the song 
 How the hell do you think you can run 
 When the helicopter light's as bright as the sun 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 Lockdown since the '80 situation number three, a 
 Nigga is released from the penitentary 
 Fools betta recognize 
 An' visualize 
 Don't be surprised 
 Ya betta realize 
 They gotta plan fo' your ass, a 
 Cage for the mask, so 
 If you're rollin' dirty ya then ya betta have a stash 
 Spot in your whoopty 
 An' know the whoompty whoofty 
 When the whoompty whafty is done unto you, see 
 He don't know the new game 
 B'cause the new game ain't true game 
 Well he betta catch her quick 
 Becuz the old game is runnin' 
 Nine is his waist 
 That's the new game loc, 'cause 
 If you ain't heated then you might get smoked 
 He was walkin' down the street 
 Mindin' his business 
 Just happy to be free 
 And what do we see? 
 From the corner of his house 
 Here come one-time 
 So off he dashed 
 Like they set fire to his ass 
 'Cause if he get caught 
 It's strike number three 
 An' this might be his last day on the street 
 I bet next time you'll listen when I tell ya son 
 That the helicopter light's as bright as the sun 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Shinin' down on me 
 Bright as the sun
