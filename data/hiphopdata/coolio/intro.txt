A man is heard running and breathing fast 
 Damn! Wha... 
 The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds terrified. The devil's laughing is getting much louder 
 There is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying to hide and everything is in his way 
 What you want man? What you want from me? 
 Your soul!
