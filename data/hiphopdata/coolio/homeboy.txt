A homeboy is somebody that got your back 
 Whether you right or wrong 
 Somebody that excepts you for what you are 
 Not what you got on, what you can do for them 
 If you lucky enough to have some then 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Friends, how many of us have them 
 And not that many 
 The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny 
 But, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do 
 Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew 
 A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click 
 And if your firm ain't thick 
 Then your squad becomes vixed 
 Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna 
 'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya 
 And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts 
 And a wolf in sheeps clothing 
 Cause some of y'all ain't knowing 
 Me and you go back like roaches in the projects 
 And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet 
 A good homie is hard to come by 
 But most times you get done by the ones you trust most 
 So, I gotta raise a toast 
 To my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose 
 Pour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc 
 I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 Uh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah) 
 Thick and thin, nigga 
 You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy) 
 If I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga 
 You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy) 
 Now I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime 
 That I would of smoked if I would of had a Tek 9 
 But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say 
 I'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way 
 And the homies I grew up with 
 Locs I threw up with 
 Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with 
 Why does it seem that the good brothers die 
 And the evil brothers live 
 And prosper and multiply 
 Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side 
 Want some many dirt for the homies that expired 
 I hope you rest in peace 
 And, when it's time for my release 
 I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low 
 But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow 
 My flow on tight, and stay rollin' with the 4-0 
 This is comin' from the one and only 
 And like MC Shan said, "I'll never leave you lonely" 
 I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah) 
 Thick and thin, nigga 
 You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy) 
 If I got a quarter then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga 
 You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy) 
 Me and you is like family 
 And everybody know that we go back to back 
 And we go toe to toe 
 Comin' from the west 
 Where the sets run thick 
 Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip 
 I cross my heart and hope to die 
 I never lie 
 I run out on mine 
 Anywhere or anytime 
 Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say 
 But, if you've lost you'll receive a ass whippin with your instant replay 
 Or, deckin like Tekken 
 So, show some respect when respect is given to you 
 And, watch out for the forty too 
 Fake curve 
 And fools who got the nerve 
 To pretend that they was down 
 When last month they wadn't even around 
 West coast, East coast, and worldwide 
 My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died 
 I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside 
 And, you can call me homeboy 
 I don't fly on air or walk on water (Or walk on water, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah) 
 Thick and thin, nigga 
 You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy) 
 If I got a quarter then you got a dime 
 (If I got a quarter then you got a dime) 
 And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours 
 (Watch my back, then I'll watch yours, yours) 
 You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy) 
 I don't fly on air, walk on water (Iiii, don't walk on water, no) 
 You can count on me till the end (Count on me till the end, oh-yeah) 
 Thick and thin (Thick and thin) 
 You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy) 
 If I got a quarter then you got a dime 
 (If I got a quarter then you got a dime) 
 And, you can call me up no matter what the time 
 (Call me up no matter what the time) 
 If you (If you) 
 (Watch my back, I'll watch yours, yours) 
 You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)

 (I got your back, ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 (You can call me homeboy) 
 (You can call me homeboy)
