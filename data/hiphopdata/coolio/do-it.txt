Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it 
 Another Saturday night and I'm feelin' kinda slothy 
 I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty 
 Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry 
 I need some Kurathers 
 Peep this, but not up in my stomach 
 I wanna chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie 
 Somethings on the rise, what a surprise 
 I called up the homies and said, "Let's go the spot" 
 Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot 
 Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty 
 Rats run around the room but, wait, I spoke too soon 
 Ah, damn, look what done walked in 
 Pumps and a bump, breath smellin' like gin 
 Baby, you look good with that blue dress on 
 Maybe some day me and you can be as one 
 Let's get to know each other better 
 I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter 
 1 Baby, you can do it 
 Take your time, do it right 
 (Let's do it, get to it) 
 You can do it, baby, baby 
 (Let's do it, get to it) 
 Baby, you can do it 
 Take your time, do it right 
 (Let's do it, get to it) 
 You can do it, baby, baby 
 (Let's do it, get to it) 
 Damn, I'm feelin' frisky 
 Come and sit down wit me 
 Conversate about hanky panky 
 And a little dranky wanky 
 Tell me bout your innermost thoughts 
 Wants, needs and your desires 
 And I'll tell you about mine 
 We can spend some quality time 
 You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen 
 I wanna mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions 
 And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama 
 With love for her daddy, anytime he want it 
 Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan 
 Or, some fillet minon and still let me know I'm the
