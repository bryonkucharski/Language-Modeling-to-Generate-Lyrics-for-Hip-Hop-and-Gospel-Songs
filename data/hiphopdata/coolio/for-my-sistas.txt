Now I didn't use the word bitch a few times in a rhyme, but 
 Now it's '95 so let me drop a line 
 This goes out to the young black queens 
 On the neighborhood scene 
 Who haven't lost their dream 
 I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love 
 And to get where you go ya got to push an' shove 
 Around the way girl with hope in your heart 
 Do his five in the purse an' five in the start 
 She's the kinda woman ya take home to momma 
 The only kind you ever let get past the drama 
 Coolio know that you ain't no ho 
 And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat 
 Queen of the entire universe 
 And you know how I know that you were put here first 
 An' to every nigga that dissed ya an' every nigga that hit ya 
 Accept my apologies for my brothaz... 
 My... sista... 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 You're all I need... 
 Princess of the Nile 
 An' sweet black sexy child 
 Ooh I like your style, huh 
 First motha on the planet 
 I know it's gettin' scary 
 And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet 
 But ya gotta shake 'em off like fleas an' nigga meat 
 And use your God-given talents and abilities 
 No matta where ya from ya get much respect 
 From the top of your neck to your county check 
 I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn 
 Brick house with a face like Leena Horne 
 I ain't no cap to save a ho 
 But I got your front 
 An' your side an' your back if that's what ya want 
 So when it's time to put it down I won't be runnin' 
 Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubmanm, huh 
 No matta what ya do or where ya go 
 Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio... 
 My... sista... 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 You're all I need... 
 Hernie Dipp got the lips, finga tips, and the hips 
 Ta make mice outa the crazy-ass Bloodz and Crypts 
 Make a nigga sing a song all night long 
 Till his voice is gone 
 Wit' no music on 
 You can be a busta on a hardass low 
 An' should be down wit' your ass when your poor and broke 
 And um uh 
 Every time ya need I'll owe ya 
 Gotta do is make a phone call, 'cause 
 When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way 
 Wit' no hesitance 
 An' any type of the leg 
 I talk about my granny 
 Batana, an' Vanita 
 Jacki an' Nicole an' Grandy an' Artisha 
 I gots to give credit where credit is due 
 An' all credit that is credited is credit to you 
 I give praise to your wayz 
 An' for all my day 
 Apologies much respect to the sons I raise... 
 My... sista... 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 Give it up for my sistas 
 You're all I need...
