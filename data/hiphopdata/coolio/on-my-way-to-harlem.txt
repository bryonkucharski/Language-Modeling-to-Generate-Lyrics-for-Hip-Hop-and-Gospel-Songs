I know a place where the trees don't grow 
 Just another place where niggaz live low 
 I know a place where life is fucked up 
 Make a wrong move and your ass get stuck up 
 Time ain't nothin' but a frame of mind 
 And life is like a mountain or a steep ass climb 
 I've been lookin' for a place to leave 
 The only free place is inside of me 
 So let's take a trip, and you don't need a grip 
 But you better be equipped cause it might be some shit 
 African-American, nothin' but a nigga 
 Had our fingers on the trigger, but I pulled mine quicker 
 I know a place where there ain't no calm and 
 You better stay away if you're soft like Charmin 
 South Central, Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton 
 A nigga on the west coast on his way to Harlem 
 Now it's time to step into the light (Light) 
 Put up your dukes, there's gonna be a fight (Fight) 
 And when it's time to fight, you better fight right 
 'Cause if it don't fight right, out goes the light 
 Take a close look at what I'm freakin on 
 Niggaz think I'm tweekin, but I'm speakin' on 
 Subject matter, data 
 Information that I gather 
 Through my travels 
 Cause the hardest of the hard, hit hardcore killer 
 Can't stop the slug of a nine millimeter 
 Everybody thinks they know, but they know not 
 If they haven't caught a cap on the block *gunshot* 
 So shine up your boots and pick up the pieces 
 Grab a fresh pair of khakis with the sharp ass creases 
 Ring the alarm, here comes the storm 
 I got a firearm on my way to Harlem 
 I know a place where the sun don't shine 
 Everybody is a victim of neighborhood crime 
 I know a place where niggaz walk the line 
 One false step and they must do time 
 Since I'm in the same boat 
 I must stay afloat 
 And sing every note 
 From the quotes that they wrote 
 So, I look into the past and walk the path of the greats 
 So I won't make the same mistakes that sealed my ancestors fates 
 If I had to be a slave I'd rather be in my grave 
 If I get in how many lives could I save? 
 One, two, three, a hundred, a thousand 
 My heart is poundin, the devil keeps soundin 
 But he don't want my money, he wants my soul 
 So I reach like a tree, and like a weed I grow 
 My stomach is full, but my mind is starvin 
 Rollin' in a g ride on my way to Harlem
