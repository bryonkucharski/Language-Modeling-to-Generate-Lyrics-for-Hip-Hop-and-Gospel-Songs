Yeah yeah 
 Fuck all these niggaz 
 You know what I'm talkin' about Wino 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Two minutes and twenty one seconds of funk 
 And I ain't no punk 
 That's right that's right 
 A tisket a tasket 
 That's all you ask it 
 Snap your CD and drop the pieces in your casket 
 Like little Jack Horna' I'm still bendin' cornas' 
 Buckin' shots on your block I'm sippin' on Corona's 
 Uh your McDonald had a farm wit' a six-fo on suicide 
 Sittin' in the barn wit' no alarm 
 Straight up collected it, cool and calm 
 Crowbar in my hand and my skeleton brick still works like a charm 
 Who's the rawest? 
 My shit is flawless 
 Had to be passin' out bruises, 
 Lacerations and broken jawses 
 Emcees wanna floss you better understand who's the boss 
 Before I do a Michael Jackson and "Cut your shit off!" 
 Part of the penitentary still, penetratin' your grill 
 I keep on keepin' it right, while you keep on keepin' it real 
 I'll bring the treble and the bass to delapatate your waist 
 Coolio's on the case, get yo hoe out my face, fool 
 Lodi Dodi, I don't know karate, but I know a razor 
 And none of y'all can't fade me 
 I know you wanna try to play me 
 And busta's wanna playa hate me 
 I'm one of the dopest niggaz out I 
 Guess that's why they hate me 
 'Cause I slang hits like niggaz slang cavi 
 I remain like khakis, I guess that's why they mad at me 
 On a record you might outgat me 
 But you can't outrap me 
 My shit is fatta' 
 And yo shit need a little bit mo batta' 
 Freestyle in unrestricted manner or method 
 Free funk text readily selected, so check it 
 Uh, ?dip diver?, socializer, I've been rockin' 
 These motherfuckin' microphones since nineteen seventy-niner, 
 And by the time that this little nappy head nigga retire 
 I'ma be at the ripe ol' age of forty-eight or forty-niner 
 My shit is wise, CPT M.C. for hire 
 My name ain't Rick James but I'll burn your ass with a fire 
 So, what's your desire baby love? 
 Is it hands wrapped around mics 
 Or fingers wrapped around triggas? 
 Eitha' way it go I'm dumpin' and I'm dippin' 
 Still tennis shoe pimpin', 40 Thevz in position 
 Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum, now nigga I'm a giant 
 And yo ass is like Jack, 
 But yo magic beans is wack 
 Skills is what you lack 
 I'm like a Benz, you ain't even like Cadillac 
 You mo like a Regal 
 I'ma pit bull, and you's a Beagle 
 I'm set to strangle hangin' emcee's at all angles 
 As their legs start to dangle, 
 Dance around everybody like Mr. Bo Jangles 
 Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, and Carson Hawthorne 
 Livin' with the Watts 
 I'm sendin' out shout outs 
 I used to drink Ol' Gold 
 Now I just stroll 
 Straight to the ?exit? section of my neighborhood liquor store 
 Huh, and you know what make me laugh, bitch? 
 Even your mama want my autograph, autograph, autograph, 
 Autograph, autograph
