 1 2 3 4 Get your woman on the floor 
 Gotta gotta get up to get down 
 Gotta gotta get up to get down 
 What up everybody so glad you're here 
 It's Coolio with the flow back in your ear 
 This ain't a fantastic voyage 
 But I'm still on a mission to see if I can 
 Get your attention 
 Now I want drops some information 
 Just a little additive to your education 
 I live my life by the code of the funk 
 600 watt AMP. 18s in the trunk 
 When I'm on the streets ya gotta feel my beats 
 So throw your hands up if you're down with the C 
 Double O-L-I-O with the flow 
 I'm lookin' for the party so let a brother know 
 1-2-3 it's like A-B-C if hip-hop didn't pay 
 I'd rap for free 
 2: 
 Slide Slide but that's the past 
 I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass 
 If ya got beef then fool eat a pork chop 
 Once I get it goin' ya know it don't stop 
 I brake like anti-locks panties drop 
 From hood to hood block to block 
 Help I need somebody 
 To get it goin' on in the party 
 Baby you can do it take your time do it right 
 We can drink some yak and do it all damn night 
 My name ain't Wanda but I'll rock your world 
 I get more bounce than a Jherry Curl 
 Too many lookie-loos be lookin' for clues 
 There's a party goin' on now whatcha gonna do 
 So grab your partner do-see-do 
 If you done know who it is it's Coolio 
 Push, push in the bush 
 But don't step on the toes 'cause you might get smushed 
 It's the brother from around the way 
 And what I say I'm in the corner on three like Dr. Dre 
 Comin' at 'em with a pattern and a fresh pair adams 
 I hope he don't trip, 'cause 
 I don't wanna have to gat 'em 
 So move your body, baby, drive the homies crazy 
 Then when you sake that ass it's always amazin' 
 Ain't no party like a west coast party 
 'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
 So when you see a young nigga 
 In a Chevy hittin' switches 
 Then ya gotta give a nigga his props 
 I got sides in my rides and motion for your ocean 
 Coolio got the potion to get the party open
