Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul, my soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 You can try to throw salt, but I keep my game face on 
 And the only thing on your mind is stalkin' more digits than a telephone 
 Me and thirty-nine thieves jumpin' out of white Hummer 
 From Compton (Wooh-wooh-wooh), while your crew get dumb and dumber 
 Grew up straight out of low cash like CB fo' 
 Now I got dough and you got one night stands like gangsta, yo 
 See on the low it's all gravy 
 But the threat of this new world order is about to drive me crazy 
 And all you want is the Lex and gold Visa 
 Bomb singles and stackin' your chips like Pringles 
 While my rhymes jack for platinum plaques 
 Quicker than one time Jack Black's 
 I twist sacks and sip yac 
 Plus, the Invisible Man got my back like a spine 
 So, why you all up in mine? 
 Keep the money and the fame cause all I really wanna hold 
 Is my artistic flavor and control of my soul 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul, my soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 Ain't no tellin' 
 Most women are still waitin' and sellin' 
 Most of my homies is ex-felons (Convicts) 
 In two decades, rap went from Planet Rock 
 To crack rock 
 Now, everybody got a glock 
 And it don't stop 
 Till another brother drop 
 That's why I poured out a little drink for the homie Pac (Rest In Peace) 
 What's a thin line between love and hate? 
 A million dollars in the bank and you still can't escape 
 It's a small world, after all, you're clausterphobic, you can't breathe 
 So, store your ball like Christopher Reeve 
 It's the hater in you that makes you criticize me 
 'Cause if you handled your business then yo ass would see 
 Nineteen-ninety-seven is still crackin' 
 I'ma get the ladies out their seat like this was a car jackin' 
 They say the game is to be sold, not told 
 You can keep your bankroll, I want control of my soul 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul, my soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 My jaws flip across sixteen bars like Dominique Dawes 
 But without no flaws, never broke a m.c. law 
 See, I was servin' wack rappers at the school 
 When Bruce Lee was scrappin' with Kareem Abdul 
 You got into triple beams and guns you ain't gon shoot 
 I seen a million rappers in the same Versace suit 
 Or, the same pair of locs, that's probably why you're broke 
 And your backstage and your ghetto pass got revoked 
 Scrappin' or rappin' what you want to happen? 
 If I ever come up short you the first one I'm jackin' 
 It's thieves in the area like aircraft carrier's 
 We're launchin' F-15's 
 And Anti-Wack Maf Machines 
 Michropone, sittin' on my vocal chord 
 Sendin' busta's to the crossroads like Thuggish Ruggish Bone 
 It's the C-O-O-L-I-O, well I, wont fold 
 When I'm controllin' my soul 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul, my soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 Soul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul (My soul) 
 My soul-oul-oul
