(I got my) I got my hand on my nutsac burnin 'cross the stage 
 In a motherfuckin rage like a animal in a cage 
 I catch wrecks like a junkyard fool (fool) 
 Fuck around and get'cha holdin' that jar, Cool! 
 Yep that's me on the motherfuckin mic-a (mic-a) 
 Nova, happy to strike niggas like a viper 
 Who rules the step to the rep that I kept 
 For a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time 
 I got mor flavour then a truck load of Snickers 
 Ya punch her by the straps, ya got ta kick her, fuck it! 
 That's how it go when ya dealin' with a pro-per 
 Got my hand on the mic and I'm about to let it flow 
 Coolio locc and I'm down ta blast 
 Peter Piper picked a paper, pick a pepper's and I jacked his ass 
 Motherfuckers curse me but they can't hurt me 
 When I'm doin' dirt, that's why I show no mercy 
 I flips tha scripts and it's tha dips when I rips 
 And rock tha fuckin' house for the Bloods and Crips 
 Danger danger, ol' gangsta gangsta 
 Droppin' dogs on the ??? ??? 
 40 Thevz and the band witta plan to make some stops 
 Niggas die on the street but they don't play taps 
 Or 21 gun salute, there ain't cahoots 
 My name ain't Alex Haley but I still got roots 
 I bang bang bang to the air now ya dead 
 It was a black and white thang but now it's blue and red 
 This ain't an episode of Batman, it's more'n like a Blackman 
 Slap yo' ass up and I jacked ya for ya Walkman 
 Niggas on the top and you don't deserve nothin' 
 They fightin punks, their rags is fucked, they shouldn't even be bumpin 
 Suckas play the back 'cause I'm dope when I rap 
 And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac 
 And it's like that! 
 It's time for me to step so I'm steppin in deep (deep) 
 I was born a thief so ya know I'm on the creep 
 Sucka nigga wanna test me but he can't best me 
 Buck-buck to the chest and I guess you're death-ly 
 Now I gotta treat ya like a sucka 
 'Cause you're soft like butter, you punk motherfucker 
 C-C-Coolio but you can call me Boo 
 I drop da shit on ya lyrics 'cause ya rhyme style is doo-doo 
 Ass, faeces, you don't wanna see me 
 With a flashlight 'cause I serve dat ass (right, right, right) 
 Word to the motherfuckin homies and you know you can't hold me 
 Or throw me... so blow me 
 How many niggas must I stick 
 Before you get my d'ift and fully understand not to fuck with this 
 I never been a stoner, take ya momma home and blown her 
 One night stand and once again she's a loner 
 'Cause I won't be played out, strung out, laid out 
 She only gave it up because she thought I had some crack 
 And I won't be strayed by a lame ass dame 
 Keep my dollars in my pockets 'cause I'm hip to ya game 
 Hoes be acting like they love me but they only wanna fuck me 
 And suck me but don't touch me 
 Back up off me hooker 'cause I won't be taken 
 Go find you another motherfucker you can break it 
 I gots ta keep playin' these niggas like ping-pong 
 And hit 'em like King Kong, they singin' the same song 
 '93 is the year and yes I'm gettin' bigger 
 Gave a shot to the 121 'cause they my niggas 
 Scotty B ridin' shotgun, BOOM he got one 
 Only God knows if he'll catch a hot one 
 Knick-knack paddy-wack Wino's in the back 
 And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac 
 And it's like that 
 I got my hand on my nutsac 
 And it's like that
