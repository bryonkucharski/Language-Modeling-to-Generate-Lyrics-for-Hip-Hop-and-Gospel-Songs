Seven in the morning, standing in the line 
 Three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine 
 Two in the back of me sucking on a joint 
 And one in back of them ready for a new sport 
 There's 4-5 suckers way way in the back 
 Stooped down low with the crowd smokin' crack 
 They looking at me funny 'cause I got a record out 
 And a nigga with a record out is supposed to have some proud 
 A forth of the people in the line be hookers 
 But the other forth betta ask help themself 
 A forth of the people having good faith 
 And all of the rest all fucked up in the head 
 A bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh 
 And a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph 
 Ain't nothing changed but the time 
 I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny 
 I walked through the front door to fill out my ap 
 Here comes another sap asking if I rap 
 I don't say a word 'cause he know that I do 
 I'm down with the MAAD ass you know Hoo! 
 I take a numer and a seat 
 I'm sweating from the heat 
 Somebody got their shoes off 
 I smell their feet 
 My number is 80, it's still on 20 
 I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30 
 Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please 
 Can I get my food stamps so I can leave 
 I got money and a car but they don't really know it 
 Now they asking me a gang of questions 'cause I told them I was homeless 
 I'm living in a car drive back in the alley 
 But I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally 
 Line after line 
 Ruff is the time 
 My life is in a bomb so I'm standing in the county line 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny 
 I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker 
 She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can work her 
 -Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp 
 Rollin' that week sheets of mine 
 You have a penetentry record 
 -I said I know that BIATCH! 
 She wants to know what kind a work do I do 
 I said I haven't worked since 1982 
 I can't find a job though I looked and I looked 
 Took one hit of the crack and mistook 
 She sittin' there wonderin' what did 'cause I did 
 And the whole time I'ma watchin like I'm smokin' me a joint 
 Job search work the projects whackness 
 And in a few weeks I'd get my check 
 Now I got to wait for them to call me trough the window 
 So I can get some cash to pay for the hotel and the bathshow 
 It's 5:13 by the clock on the wall 
 Mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall 
 Shit is getting late and the time is 29 
 That why so many niggas standing in the county line 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny
