Back in the days when I was a young buck 
 Stuck like a truck gettin' shit outta luck 
 Times was rough and I didn't have a plan 
 I was barely on the edge of my life as a man 
 It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib 
 No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids 
 That's why a young nigga learned how to steal, see 
 Shopliftin laid me a whole lotta meals 
 But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and 
 Life was unfair but who the fuck cares? 
 I still hear Momma, what she used to tell me 
 That you don't get shit in this life for free 
 And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top 
 Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop 
 Not everybody can relate to what I been through 
 Even though some front and they try to pretend to 
 Know about the life of a kid and the strife 
 Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe 
 Good goes to bad, bad goes to worse 
 And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse 
 So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes 
 I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky 
 My stomach is growlin, word is born 
 'Cause all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn 
 A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn 
 All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn 
 A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn 
 Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn 
 A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn 
 I tried to get full off a can-o-corn 
 A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn 
 That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen 
 A few years later, I pledge a legions to the set 
 I'm growin' up but I ain't grown yet 
 It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain 
 Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain 
 I'm sittin' in the restaurant, guardin my food like a eagle 
 Pickin' up scraps like a seagull 
 Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip 
 So I can put it in my pocket 
 Phoney Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and the stork 
 We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork 
 And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how 
 When it come up I let you bring me down 
 So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group 
 Of gangstas and hoodlums, but you can call 'em 'scroops' 
 Give me liberty or give me death 
 'Cause a man without pride ain't got shit left, huh 
 And now that I'm older with kids of my own 
 I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone 
 Get'cha self together, word is born 
 'Cause a man can't live on a can-o-corn
