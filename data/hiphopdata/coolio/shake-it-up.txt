We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday 
 We blowing up Wednesday and Thursday 
 She shake it up Friday and Saturday 
 I beat it up all day on Sunday 
 It was on the very first time that I met her 
 That leather was fittin that ass and that skin tight sweater 
 Was curvin around that body and I painted a picture 
 In my mind I wrote a letter 'bout us getting together 
 Green eyes dark hair honey brown complextion 
 I was rollin' in a bucket she was rollin' a lexus 
 I sweat it now we can do the damn thang if she wanna 
 If she don't I'm just satisfied with bendin some cornas 
 Drink coronas just as long as she don't leave me alona 
 I can name fifty niggas now that wanted to bone her 
 But they didn't I'm happy 'bout the place that I'm sittin' 
 Didn't buy shit my name is still on her kitten 
 Written in platinum she don't just love me for rappin' and actin' 
 She love my mind the way I'm dippin in matchin' 
 My blackness, her reactions are like fatal attractions 
 She jackin and blastin and ridin' for the man that she's rackin 
 We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday 
 We blowin' up Wednesday and Thursday 
 She shake it up Friday and Saturday 
 I beat it up all day on Sunday 
 So shake it up (shake it up) 
 Do yo thang little mamma shake it up (shake it up) 
 Bend over touch yo toes and shake it up (shake it up) 
 I like the way you move now shake it up (shake it up) 
 Just shake shake shake shake shake (shake) 
 She my main squeeze only thing maintained 
 Sometime tha that shit I be sayin' she the only one that understand 
 She my boo my freak I know that I'm her main man 
 So fuck these hos and bullshit niggas with these same games 
 I let my chain hang and still claim the same thang 
 And even when she don't love me I'm the same main 
 Nigga that she call when she need somebody to talk to 
 Hit her from the back eat and walk wit her 
 She got a lot to offer look what she brought with her 
 She got brains and taps that leave niggas that start wit her 
 She don't care about houses cars sex and bling bling 
 Even though nine and half inches is a big thang 
 She ain't the type that be creepin' and sleepin' and jumpin' in other niggas jeepin 
 When I'm outta town on business 
 When I'm on a mission to put us in a position 
 Where we don't have to do nothin' but show the love and kick it listen 
 We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday 
 We blowing up Wednesday and Thursday 
 She shake it up Friday and Saturday 
 I beat it up all day on Sunday 
 We breakin up, Monday and Tuesday 
 We blowin' up Wednesday and Thursday 
 She shake it up Friday and Saturday 
 I beat it up all day on Sunday 
 So shake it up (shake it up) 
 Do yo thang little mamma shake it up (shake it up) 
 Bend over touch yo toes and shake it up (shake it up) 
 I like the way you move now shake it up (shake it up) 
 Just shake shake shake shake shake (shake)
