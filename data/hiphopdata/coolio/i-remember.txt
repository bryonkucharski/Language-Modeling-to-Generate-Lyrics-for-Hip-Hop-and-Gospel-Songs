When I was a kid I rolled crates on a skate 
 And I ate everything mama put on my plate 
 Niggas walked around packin' BB guns 
 Knock on your door and run, just for fun 
 We went to the store and sold bottles for a nickel 
 ??? Bag of Cheetohs and a pickle 
 You could get a soda for less than a quarter 
 And people used to speak even if they didn't know ya 
 We fought in the streets like little black soldiers 
 Shake hands and still be friends when it was over 
 We used to play tag or hide and go seek 
 Or hide and go get 'em if we had a few freaks 
 But now things change, kids ain't the same 
 The beg and sleg and try to blow our brains 
 I wish I could go back but wishin' is fo' suckas 
 Life was so simple then 
 I remember (I remember) 
 Oh, when we used to hang, on the porch 
 Drinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby) 
 I remember (I remember) 
 When we used to play shoot 'em ups, 
 Up and down and the gang bang (baby) 
 Well I remember yester year like it was yesterday 
 Runnin' through the streets of Vanessa, PA 
 I'll take you through me childhood step by step 
 Daddy always told me to retain my rep, though 
 Daddy was a dog and he don't raise no punks 
 In the midst of the trees we learned how to pump 
 At the tender age of nine mama put us on a plane 
 Next stop (the land of the insane) 
 Compton, California where the killas grow 
 Forced to live a life that I didn't know. 
 Wore the wrong colors 'cause I didn't know the facts 
 Caught a, caught a case, caught a slug in my back 
 But I had time to quickly, suckas try and get me 
 But now the fools be a runnin' 'cause this is Drive-By Billy 
 Little black boy from the east, forced to be a killer 
 But I can still remember 
 I remember (I remember) 
 Oh, when we used to play dominos (dominos) 
 On the porch and then the drive by (baby) 
 I remember (I remember) 
 When we used to have army fights 
 In the smoke and then the gang bang (baby) 
 Back when I was a kid 
 We used to have this game called paper ball 
 (Paper ball? What the fuck is that?) 
 Get a piece of paper, ball that mother fucker up, 
 Play with it 
 I got the alcoholic juice-ah to wake you up like a rooster 
 Back when I was young, I used to be a booster 
 Stealin' candy from the store 
 Go to school, I had the whole playground 
 Chewin on my gumma 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Playin' steel to the chest 
 And I was the best playin' kickball at recess 
 I used to play pop-gun, go the Bears and make fun of losers 
 We used to hop corners on the fresh beef cruisers 
 Playin' Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin' Reese's 
 I had all the women cause my tough skin has creases. 
 And it's been that way since day one 
 Girls of the world ain't nothin' but fun 
 I used to watch Dr. J, come through with a touch 
 Remember New Zoo Review and Starsky and Hutch 
 I remember lunch time we used to rhyme out loud 
 Peace to the whop in the hip-hop crowd 
 I remember 
 I remember (I remember) 
 Oh, when we used to hang, on the porch 
 Drinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby) 
 I remember (I remember) 
 When we used to play shoot 'em ups, 
 Up and down and the gang bang (baby) 
 Oh now, now now 
 I know you do 
 I remember yesterday (oh I remember when we play) 
 I remember yesterday, oh 
 I remember how, when we used to play (I remember) 
 I remember when we, I remember 
 (Used to play dominos, all night long, dominos, all night long.) 
 I remember yesterday 
 Do you remember yesterday? (I remember yesterday)
