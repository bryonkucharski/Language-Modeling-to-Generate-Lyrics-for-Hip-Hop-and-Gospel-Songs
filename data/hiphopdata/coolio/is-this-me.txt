Yeah 1996 
 Coolio with the flow 
 Rated R superstar 
 LV that's right 
 Mossberg Smith and Wesson 
 Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson 
 House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know 
 But I had to go they had a house full of hos 
 I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head 
 The hos is looking good so we try to make a friend for night 
 Let's get it right let's get it straight 
 But now these punkass niggas in the party want to play a hate 
 I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that 
 It's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt 
 Like American Express here we go again 
 I never leave home without it so don't even think about it 
 Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed 
 But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove 
 Back up off let's keep it soft 
 Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name 
 Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same 
 All these sucker set-trippin' killin' for no reason 
 That's why I never leave the house without my nina 
 I love my baby carry my baby wherever I go 
 For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin' 
 Stop wishin you was in my shoes 
 And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else 
 It's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet 
 The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go 
 Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work 
 I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop 
 Stop hating my life and get your own 
 Be true to this game or this game will do you cold 
 Everywhere I go I got my back 
 I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 No no ooh I can't escape this life 
 I been trying to live in piece but these fools won't cease 
 They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip 
 Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin' it's a new thing 
 One shot from a Jake .38 can make your brain ache 
 I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin' 
 But if you run up on me trippin' you best believe I'm dumpin' 
 I got bills to pay and kids to raise 
 And a whole generation of lost niggas to save 
 So I ain't got time for that yip yap 
 If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back 
 Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true 
 Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it 
 Don't start no shit and it won't be none son 
 But if you do I'm going for my gun 
 Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary 
 So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 This really ain't me no more 
 These streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside 
 This really really really ain't me 
 But the streets won't let me go 
 I can't escape this life 
 That they got me trapped inside
