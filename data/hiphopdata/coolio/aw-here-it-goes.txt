Aww here it goes 
 Everybody out there go run and tell 
 Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel 
 They keep you laughing in the afternoon 
 So, don't touch that dial or leave the room 
 'Cause they're always into something 
 It's fun and you don't wanna miss it 
 It's double K, like 2 the good radius 
 Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan 
 But you gotta watch Kenan 'cause 
 Kenan be scheming 
 With a plan or a plot 
 To make it to the top 
 But they kinda in the middle 
 'Cause they're always gettin' caught 
 This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery 
 It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity 
 Like Siegfried and Roy, Stan and Costella 
 Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller 
 Somebody's in trouble 
 Aww here goes 
 On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick
