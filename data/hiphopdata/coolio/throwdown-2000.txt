Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he walks through 
 If there be a dope beat then all y'all see 
 Get up out your seat and let me see yo technique 
 Freak yo physique and you betta not compete 
 Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep 
 Never comin' cheap, forty creep 
 And I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few things while you go to sleep 
 I steal money from the rich 
 And give it to the poor, it's 
 Coolio loco and ghetto witch doctor super, you are 
 Bring it from the back and bring it to the front 
 Cause you gotta give the people what they want 
 Now hump, do the stomp to the butt 
 Big homie shake your gut 
 As long as you get your ass up 
 It's a party over here 
 And let me make it clear 
 40 Thevz is the crew 
 So you better come anew 
 Ain't a damn thing change since the first one 
 And if you didn't hear the album go get one (One) 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he walks through. 
 Here come the thief on the old school beat 
 And I never knew the meaning of the word "defeat" 
 The master of disguise wanna see the people's eyes 
 Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly 
 Just cook 'em all up like gumbo 
 And block their ass like Mutumbo 
 Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo 
 We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes 
 Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan 
 I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga 
 It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station 
 Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall 
 And what if hip hop had to take a great fall 
 And what if rhyme was a crime 
 And each and every time 
 That you spit a dope line 
 You might have to do some time 
 Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town 
 But Coolio will be ready for the showdown 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down' like your 'posed to and pass a joint to the loc when he roll through 
 If the shoe fit, put it on and stick 
 And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check 
 Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch 
 Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich 
 From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin' wit the 4-0 
 This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe 
 It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken 
 Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open 
 You can't understand how I do it 
 I'm just true to it 
 I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent 
 Uh, let it ring, let it rip 
 Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip 
 Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop 
 Till the neighborhood watch call the cops 
 It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran 
 Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section) 
 Are you ready to throwndown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and pass the brew to the loc when he roll through 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school 
 Are you ready to throwdown? 
 Yes we are! 
 Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he roll through. 
 Fool!
