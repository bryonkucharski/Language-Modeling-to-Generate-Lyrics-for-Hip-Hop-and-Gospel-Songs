Uh, I sneak a forty like a cheetah 
 And give a call to the wild when I greet her (Meow!) 
 The coochie leader 
 Bend on over and touch your toes 
 And I can jump up on a dresser and strike a pose 
 Uh, if you want it then you're ready and you're able, girl 
 Pull up your skirt and we can do it on the pool table 
 Your nipples look so tender 
 Can I twirl 'em in my mouth like a blender, surrender 
 Cause ain't nothin' but freakin 
 I can keep it all day, all weekend 
 And have you tweekin 
 I be strokin, that's what I be doin' 
 And every position you assumin 
 Uh, all night, all day 
 If you stay 
 I can rub you the right way (Hey!) 
 If he go one time, I go three 
 Cause that's how it is in the CPT 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 'Cause I got the key to the city 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Can we go somewhere and get busy? 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 You're lookin' kinda pretty 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Can I get close to the kitty? 
 Are you sure that we alone, all alone? (Yeah!) 
 Lock the door and unplug the telephone (Telephone!) 
 Light some candles let me get a look at your handles (Ooh-wee!) 
 You got a body like a sex scandal 
 So, I puts the cotton ball in the Q-Tip patch 
 Turn around and let me see you from the back, ah shat! (Damn!) 
 You know you bring out the freak in me 
 I go deep in the peak, I hope you think of me 
 Whenever you need some sexual healing 
 We like two in a million 
 Don't fight the feelin' 
 You ain't dealin' with no rookie 
 Yes I got a lot of nuts in my Tollhouse cookie 
 Call up your bookie, put your money on the cement 
 I'm puttin' in work like a tag team free man 
 I spark through the woods like a Recon 
 And we can do it all night with the lights on 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 'Cause I got the key to city 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Let's go somewhere and get busy? 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 I hope you ain't the kind that acts a ditty 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 I'm tryin' to get close to the kitty 
 What's up on some lovin', babay? 
 We can roll in my sixty-three 
 And drink Hennessy 
 What's up on some lovin', babay? 
 Don't you wanna roll with me? 
 You and me can cream 
 We can put it on a platter, girl, it don't matter 
 I make it hot and you can pop it like a firecracker 
 In the bedroom, bathroom, livin' room 
 Outside in the yard, it's a full moon 
 In the car, in the front seat, back seat 
 On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good 
 I'll be the piece and you can be the booty 
 And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie 
 You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up 
 Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up 
 Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game 
 You never come the same if we say yo name 
 Is it real or a dream 
 You make me scream 
 When you rub my body with shaving cream 
 Stick your tongue down my throat and give me a kiss (Mmm-waah!) 
 Cause you know it don't get no better than this (That's right!) 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 'Cause I got the key to the city 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Can we go somewhere and get busy? 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Damn, you're lookin' kinda pretty 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Can I get close to the kitty 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Girl, I got the key to the city 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Can we go somewhere and get busy? 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Come and get a taste of the ribby (Ribby!) 
 Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!) 
 Now, the kitty's kinda friendly
