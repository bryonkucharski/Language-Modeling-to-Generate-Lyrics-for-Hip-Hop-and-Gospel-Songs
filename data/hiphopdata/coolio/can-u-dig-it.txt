Uh! Yeah! What Up? 
 I know y'all wanna take me down 
 I know y'all wanna see me get clowned 
 I know y'all wanna take my sound 
 And put a nigga like me in the lost and found 
 But I refuse to fade 
 I'll stay this way 
 Spreadin venom in the mic till I'm old and gray 
 And now niggaz wanna attack me 
 Flip-flop and back me 
 But fool you's a mackey 
 I'll starch your ass like some khakis 
 Your shit is tacky and you better play the backwoods 
 Me and my crew will use your CD for a hackey sack 
 Imagine that 
 And it shouldn't be hard 
 Cause your style ain't large 
 And you wanna make all the profits with crowbars 
 Can you Dig It? 
 When nothin' can save it 
 Shock your ass like a phaser 
 Burn and cut like a laser 
 Amaze you, with this flava 
 I run with a pack of tennis shoe playa's 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 The first law of age is called survival 
 That's why I'm deadly on revival 
 And it's vital 
 To my basic instinct 
 That all wack MC's become extinct 
 Because we on the brink 
 Or, should I say the edge 
 Like a schizsophrenic with seventeen personalities walkin' on a ledge 
 Then you can't see the black 'cause it's blocked by the blue and the red 
 U.F.O.'s 
 And scandalous ass hoes 
 Waist deep in the shit, it's still smellin' like a rose 
 And I suppose 
 You want me to play superstar 
 And when I see you on the street act like I don't know who you are 
 So, you can run back and tell that 
 But I won't do that 
 So, fool you can chew that 
 To all sucka MC's you better beware 
 I been conjurin up forces way back in my lair 
 And my crew don't scare 
 And we don't care 
 We act, we wear, I swear 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 It's the thrilla 
 Straight outta Compton, not Manilla 
 Got a chokehold on the mic like I was M.C. Gorilla 
 Take this to the heart for real a 
 Don't you ever try to steal a 
 Like AIDS this shit came like gin a 
 Might fuck up your liva 
 Call me Pharoh 'cause I'm floatin bustas up the river 
 When I deliver 
 Make your sister and your grandma shiver 
 Top feelin' steadily rakin up the scrilla 
 Kickin back in my easy chair sippin on some Henna 
 ?Exol? cause my whole crew is locin 
 And fools always tryin' to fix shit that ain't broken 
 I'm down with pixies so you don't wanna see me 
 So, grab everyone in your crew and disapeer like a genie 
 Never said I was the best but I ain't the one to be testin 
 Cross the line and in pieces you'll be destined 
 Don't stop, get it, get it 
 'Cause I blow up the spot every time I grab the mic and hit it, hit it 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It? 
 Can you Dig It?
