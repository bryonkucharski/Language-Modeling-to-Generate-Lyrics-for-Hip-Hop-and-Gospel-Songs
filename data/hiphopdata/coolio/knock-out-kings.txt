(Verse 1 - Coolio) 
 (1 - 2 - 3 - 4) 
 You in the ring with a thing, not a man 
 And what I bring is shots to the body 
 That'll make a fool sing, soprano 
 Fall setter, ain't nuttin better 
 Massive concussion, career over, no discussion 
 Both eyes closed, broke nose, cheeks swole 
 You can't see, vision like a peep ho 
 This ain't no slug-fest or exhibition 
 It's a disaster, cold, beat-down, tragic massacre 
 Call in the doctor 
 He's been rocked and socked-up 
 Call the police, the champ's insane and oughta be locked up 
 Pay-per-viewers have to try to not to light the whole block up 
 He's hurt and he's wobbling and he can't keep his things up 
 He's gettin' banged up 
 Uppercuts, overhead right, short left jab 
 Right into a change up 
 Big thing, he's down and canvas smell like dirt, don't it? 
 El Cool Magnifico crush all weak opponents 
 (The Replacements) 
 These combinations are taking me places 
 Knockin' my opponents outa they shoes 
 With tight laces 
 Makin' faces as they body hit the canvas in pain 
 The championship belt is what I taste and claim 
 Survivin the game 
 Pound for pound you got the best man standing right here 
 Round for round I got the cowards runnin' in fear 
 Town for town, fight fans stand and cheer 
 Your Knockout King is up in the ring 
 1 - 2 - 3, killer! 
 4 - 5 - 6, spitter! 
 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 
 4 to the body and 2 to the chin! 
 1 - 2 - 3, killer! 
 4 - 5 - 6, spitter! 
 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 
 *Ding* *ding* now it's on again! 
 (Verse 2 - The Replacements) 
 Uh, round for round and pound for pound 
 It's the king of the ring with a hundred knockouts 
 Uppercuts to the chin, knock your mouthpiece out 
 Got your corner-man yellin'
