You got me smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin' again 
 Smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin', again 
 One night of pleasure nine months of pain 
 Three days later and that's when you came 
 Two arms two legs ten fingers ten toes 
 Brown eyes like mom, with your grandmothers nose 
 Even though you're momma's baby 
 And daddy's little baby 
 My love is unconditional to one of us is swayze 
 Day or night, roll the light 
 No matter what you do 
 Like the Jackson 5 said I'll be there for you 'cause 
 My life is your life and your life is mine 
 Through thick or thin I'm your friend till the end of time 
 I'll make sure you get your props 
 You can call me pops 
 And anything you need I'll pull it out of the stops 
 Even though we're not together like we used to be 
 D-A-D-D-Y, you can count on me 
 'Cause when I'm feelin' down every now and then 
 I take a look into your eyes and then smile again 
 You got me smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin' again 
 Smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin', again 
 Forget about Batman, Superman and the Power Rangers 
 'Cause I'ma be your hero if you ever in some danger 
 This ain't the Huxtables and my name ain't Cliff 
 No matter how old you get you could get that ass whipped 
 Daddy don't take no mess 
 And I ain't gone settle for nothing less than your very best 
 When I do what I do 'cause you did what you did 
 It's 'cause I ain't the kind of father that be raising no dumass kids 
 You gosta be a leader, it's my responsibility to teach ya 
 Right from wrong, and make decisions of your own 
 I never said that I was perfect 
 But I know that you're worth it so 
 I'ma do my damnest to make sure you get some chances 
 So just listen to your daddy 'cause he tryin' to tell ya something 
 And don't let nobody tell ya I don't love ya 'cause they frontin' 
 'Cause when I'm feelin' down every now and then 
 I take a look into your eyes and then smile again 
 You got me smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin' again 
 Smilin' 
 Again you 
 Got me smilin', again 
 Every day is a struggle when life is like a puzzle 
 That we gotta put together 
 Together so and ever 
 You need a shoulder to cry on and someone you can rely on 
 Your daddy's home 
 I'm tryin'a build a foundation on which you could stand 
 When you's a grown woman and you's a grown man 
 I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear 
 When I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spirit 
 I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for 
 The knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids 
 I know it's hard growing up 'cause I used to be a youngsta 
 So we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under 
 People let me tell ya about my best friends 
 'Cause I'm down with the children all the way till the end 
 'Cause when I'm feelin' down every now and then 
 I take a look into their eyes and then smile again
