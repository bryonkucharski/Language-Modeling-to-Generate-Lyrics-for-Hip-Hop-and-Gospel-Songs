I'm seein' bodiez in the alley and blood in the valley 
 From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali 
 I'm callin' rally to the homies in the street light 
 Take a real close at what it look like 
 A young nigga in the ghetto raised up on whit 
 The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit 
 Playin' tag with body bag, 
 Bullets, 
 And bloody rag 
 And did you put the dodge on the toe tag? 
 Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow 
 'Cause life is full of hardships, pimpslaps, and sorrow 
 Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do 
 Make sure what you believe is real and true 
 Fuck the liez an' alibiez an' come to realize 
 My vision won't assault of wasted on blind lil' eyes 
 Like A T an' T ya gotta make a switch 
 O' get pushed to the side like a lil' ol' bitch... 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front 
 With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there 
 With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair 
 I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah 
 Lootin' an' shootin' 
 I'm doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in 
 Niggaz don't be doin' what they 'posed to do 
 They betta post on the corna with the busta crew 
 Playin' games I used to play back in '79 
 With the same bullshit an' the same ol' lie 
 If you want some respect ya won't be individual 
 On the nigga nuts 'cause he rollin' in the Sixty-fo' 
 Yo favorite line is fuck all a y'all 
 But one day there's gonna be a final call 
 That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep 
 Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep 
 So pull your money outa your pocket an' put it in the middle 
 This ain't no roosta ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 In my mothafuckin' self I trust... 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front 
 With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there 
 With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair 
 Way back in the dayz we used to sling 'em in the street 
 But now when niggaz get beat 
 They wanna go an' get their heat 
 Everybody know that you know how to kill 
 But tell me do you how to let a nigga live 
 I gotta dream that maybe one day 
 Niggaz can't fight then walk away 
 I'm talkin' fist-a-cuffs put the pistols up and shoot 'em from 
 The shoulders to show that you can hold yours 
 I sing the song of the fight of the black man 
 In America 
 In a state of hysteria 
 No longa will I accept the second rate 
 I plan to set the record straight b'fore I disobey 
 It's the one - two combination punch to the throat 
 There's a hole in ya boat bitch 
 That's all she wrote 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 In my mothafuckin' self I trust... 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front 
 With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump 
 When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there 
 With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair
