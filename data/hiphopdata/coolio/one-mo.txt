I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 I wear a "S" on my chest 
 I prefer my vest 
 And if the chronic run out, loc, pass the stress 
 Cause all I wanna do is just roll my things 
 Turn up the alphine and let the woofers bang bang 
 To the boogie say up jump the boogie 
 He was tryin' to get a grip on my cookies 
 I shook thee 
 I coulda took him, but he wadn't even worth a bullet 
 I had my finger on the trigger, but I couldn't pull it 
 From defamation to desimation 
 Every day is like summer vacation 
 A nigga couldn't wait for somethin' good to put in yo Kenwood 
 Turn it up to twenty-one, and bop it in your hood 
 I'm a eastside nigga (Nigga) 
 Gotta have sprilla (Sprilla) 
 Do or die, low down, real life killa (Killa) 
 They comin' through the hold on tip toe 
 You swear, so 
 I gotta get your grip, hoe 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 Yes, yes, y'all (Yes y'all) 
 40 Thevz in the house, with a fifth y'all (Fifth y'all) 
 Better recognize a tennis shoe pimp, y'all (Pimp y'all) 
 When I'm rollin' through your hood in my six, oh, that be you 
 When our four colors rock, front and ass out 
 All the riders shake and smile when they see me hit the block 
 Your sounds ain't beatin' 
 So your girls ain't freakin 
 Watch your fly, got the whole post meetin 
 Hit 'em in their eyes 
 And go suicides 
 Later, pump them on the ground just to show 'em what it's like 
 To hit the mic for a licken 
 Hell no, I ain't trippin' 
 'Cause I kinda like pimpin' 
 Bein' freer than a pigeon 
 Got your bitch down in positions 
 All kinda ways 
 40 Thevz pimpin' these suckas till they graze 
 So, come with these weak flows if you must 
 But I got a hundred and twenty-one mo rounds I can bust 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 Put the pep in yo step and the glide in your stride 
 Like Clyde 
 Drexler, this is eastside 
 Westa, recognize the routine 
 Mo jackers and packers than the Super Bowl ring team 
 So, why you tellin' me to sell a key of yayo 
 That's how you give a fellow need like Jayo 
 We lay low 
 All up in the cut 
 If it's suicide then roll the bustas up 
 And I'ma hit 'em up like uppercut 
 Better shuffle yo feet like double dutch 
 Now the party didn't start till I walked in 
 And it probably wont end till I sip Hen 
 But in the meantime 
 And in between time 
 Better tuck in your chin 
 And learn to take your lumps and grin 
 You know you can't wait 'cause I'ma stay on one 
 One switch, one sack, one sip, but I ain't done 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist 
 I got one mo switch I can hit 
 I got one mo bullet in my clip 
 I got one mo drink I can steal 
 I got one mo sack I can twist
