One dark night I need some ends 
 I got a spot cased out I'm breakin in 
 I gotta cutter that'll cut through ya window like butter 
 Suction cup, window up 
 Now I'm on the inside lookin' for some loot 
 38 special I don't wanna have to shoot 
 I ain't no young, raw fresh recruit, uh 
 Steel tote boots, black khaki suit 
 A real quick search and nobody's home 
 Just like I planned, now I'm home alone 
 I hope ya don't mind if I use tha phone 
 And fix me sometin to eat before I'm gone 
 I got the servant and the china, deuce-five and the 9 
 Rolex off the desk so I can tell the time 
 No one knows where the flow goes when the 'dults crow 
 You better take some no doughs 
 Now I'm out tha back with a sack fulla goods 
 Throw it in the truck, take it back to the hood 
 Let me be brief, I'm on the creep 
 I stole the sounds out'cha jeep, it takes a thief 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep 
 I need a lick real quick-like 
 My mind ain't wrapped tight 
 I scale like Mike Tys so call this fright night 
 You don't wanna see me comin' down the street when I'm broke and it's dark 
 So run your motherfuckin pockets 'fore they find your ass dead in the park 
 Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers 
 No I ain't the cops, I just want your rings 
 And your wallet and your watch and your fat gold chain 
 Don't try nuttin strange or I'm blowin' out'cha brains 
 I rob from the rich so I can get rich 
 I ain't got shit so I take what I can get 
 I need my mail, my snaps, my dollars, my ends 
 My grip ain't high enough so I'm robbin on my friends 
 Somebody out there's out to get me 
 The smaller the nigga, the bigger the gat be 
 I don't give a fuck about your pain and your grief 
 You shouldn't of fell asleep, it takes a thief 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep 
 There's a buster on the West Side, I heard he gotta grip 
 And he's outta town on business so I'm schemin on his shit 
 I heard he got kis and Gs and deeds 
 And guns and big trash bags full o' weed 
 I stole a brand new fresh shaft telephone van 
 So now I guess I'm the telephone man 
 The bathroom window ain't got no alarm 
 I gotta skelton brick that works like a charm 
 It didn't take long to find what I was lookin' for 
 I was damned near finished when I heard a key in the door 
 I jumped in the closet and checked my clip 
 Pulled my ski mask down, I can't believe this shit 
 I counted to five and the front door opened up 
 I counted three more and the front door was shut 
 I counted five more to give me some space 
 Then I jumped out the closet and bucked him in the face 
 I loaded up the van in broad daylight 
 'Cause Looky Lou's have their high beams on at night 
 I take the backstreets to avoid the heat 
 And never let 'em see me sweat, it takes a thief 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep 
 Oh yeah! It takes a thief 
 Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief 
 It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief 
 Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep 
 Oh yeah! 
 Yeah yeah! 
 Hey yeah! 
 Just a reminder to let you know 
 There's motherfuckers out there that want your shit 
 So you better watch out, better watch your back 
 Can't be goin' to sleep, protect your shit 
 Know what I'm sayin'?
