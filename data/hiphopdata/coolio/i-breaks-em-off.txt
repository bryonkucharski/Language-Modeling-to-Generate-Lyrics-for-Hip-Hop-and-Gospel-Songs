Yeah I run rings around your crew like a track star 
 So stay back far 
 You better understand who the macks are 
 A brand new invention is my intention 
 Been rappin' so long some say I should get a pension 
 Ain't no tension 
 If I forgot to mention 
 I rock rhymes over beats for salary and commission 
 I got it all figured out like Columbo 
 I'll drop you like Dumbo 
 Your album is weak, and so is your video 
 Or should I say wackeo 
 Your girl is a tacky hoe 
 Go back to slangin rocks and leave rappin' to Coolio 
 It's the all assmatic, tongue acrobatic, loc 
 Used to be smoked out recovered crack addict 
 I'll dip you in some sauce, fool, I'm the boss 
 And I still be sending busters to Harris and Ross 
 You, gotta pay the cost I refuse to take a loss 
 So I spit like I feel it and dust your junky ass off 
 Chorus, Repeat 3X: 
 I break 'em off 
 I break 'em all off 
 I got to keep on the real 
 With my hands on the steel 
 'Cause we all understand we got to die one day 
 But, everybody knows we got to rise to the top 
 And the mission don't stop till the casket drop 
 I'm protected by the tech 
 And the teflon vest 
 And we earn that respect 
 'Cause we worked so hard so put that needle on the record 
 And everybody check it, 'cause I never been affected 
 By what they say 
 It's been a whole lot of years since I shed tears 
 For my fears I downed case loads of beers and drank jack with my peers 
 So never let it be said that I fronted a fake 
 I keep the treble in my highs and lows in my bass 
 So feel the affect of the wine and funk 
 But you gotta have hustle which can vibrate you funk 
 City to alley to valley hood and block 
 You know I got the sound to break 'em off 
 Chorus, Repeat 7X: 
 I came back from the Congo as Return Of The Jedi 
 I smoke the spinach and you get popped in your ezzye 
 Watch me do this 
 You take a ass whoopin like Brutus 
 My rhymes will sound like Buddha, like Olive Oil is skinny and Whimpee 
 Sea Hag don't never tempt me 
 Get up on the funk so you can feel the simpy 
 I can do the rope-a-dope 
 And steal a base like Davey Lopes 
 And bring more hope back to the hood than the Pope 
 So, drink some Scope and try to feel sure 
 See, if you can endure 
 The pressure that's put on your 
 But your soggy ass don't stay crunchy in milk 
 That's why your cap get peeled, yeah, you're soft as silk 
 It's time to separate the real from the fake 
 You shaky like Jake 
 And your game always get exposed when you perpetrate 
 Check the Times and the Post 
 This is straight west coast 
 And when I break it off you know it's broke 
 (Chorus, Repeat 7.5 times) 
 This is straight west coast!
