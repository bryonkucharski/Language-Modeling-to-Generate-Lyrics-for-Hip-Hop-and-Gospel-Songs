 To plead innocence and say they never saw ya 
 But before ya ya lawyer a-get you free 
 He asks how will you pay his fee? 
 But you have no money, you're in a jam 
 Your lawyer don't give a damn, watch the cell doors slam

 They go from two to four in a row

 They go from four to six and what they bear 
 They have you spendin all your money like a millionaire 
 They go from eight to nine and then to ten 
 Your baby got'cha spendin money again 
 Wit'cha money now gone your rent is due 
 And now your landlord is houndin you 
 But you go to lay down and rest your head 
 But the bill collector done took your bed 
 And when you got twentys and fives and tens 
 Then sometimes you got friends 
 But when you only got pennys, nickels and dimes 
 Then you only got friends some of the time 
 So you make a million dollars to pay a tax 
 To keep the IRS off your back 
 Uncle Sam got his and I got mine 
 And now I got friends all o' the time
