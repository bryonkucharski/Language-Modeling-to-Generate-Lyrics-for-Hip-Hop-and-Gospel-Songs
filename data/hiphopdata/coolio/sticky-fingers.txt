Brainiac, with a zany act, cleptomaniac 
 Before I go to work I smoke me a fat sack 
 Of indo, then climb through the window 
 And eye the VCR, and load it in the Pinto, huh! 
 Yes I'm on my way to the bait 
 Or should I say the pawn shop, but I don't smoke rocks 
 Some people say I'm crazy and they think I'm on crack 
 'Cause I hock all the shit and I never get it back 
 Coolio loco, you better call Bronco 
 Stole a link from my auntie, and sold it to my uncle 
 Took the flowers from a hearse, romanced a nurse 
 Put the girl to sleep then I went through her purse 
 Bandit, underhanded, yes I'm skanless 
 Snake in the grass fool, I'm taking chances 
 If the price is right, you can call me a killer 
 Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Finger 
 ("But he's stickin you, and takin' all of you money" -- Guru) 
 ("I ain't never got gaffled like that" - JD) 
 ("Don't, you blink, or I'ma rob your ass blind" - Sticky Fingers) 
 ("What you doin' stickin in that people's window?" - Richard Pryor) 
 ("Gimme that...") big fat dope sack 
 ("Gimme that...") ca-di-llac 
 ("Gimme that...") big gold chain 
 ("That's the life, a-that I lead" -- Run-D.M.C.) 
 Coolio call me shady, janky, slick right 
 You and your crew better duck from my gunshots 
 I takes no shit, carryin no drama 
 If I can't get you I bust a cap on your momma 
 I never had a grip, so I learn how to shoplift 
 My trenchcoat is long and now I got some fresh shit 
 Yeah, buddy, sht's lookin' good 
 Gets much props and respect from the hood 
 Caps from my raps and a trunk full of hubcaps 
 Step to the crew, and you're bound to catch a pimp slap 
 But I don't pimp no bitch for my dough 
 They got somethin' I want, I just rob the hoe 
 Early birds catch the worm so I crow like a rooster 
 They follow me round the store because they know that I'm a booster 
 Tell me what you want and I'll be the stealer 
 Call me Coolio, or call me Sticky Fingers 
 ("Coolio...") 
 ("First they do' ring, now they mob ring") 
 ("Told you before, you shouldn'ta never fell asleep" - Big Daddy Kane) 
 ("Give it up, give it up, give it up") 
 I don't wanna go to jail 'cause I don't like the lockup 
 Turn out the lights and get ready for the sock up 
 One plus three equals four for the knockout 
 Got circles on that ass like a Mike Tyson PunchOut 
 You better hide your shit if you wanna keep it 
 I'm driving down the street in your 'llac while you're sleepin' 
 I was born with a sickness, that they call brokeness 
 Never said I was the best, but I'm damn sure the loc'est 
 Up, up, and away, like a rocket 
 Some fool got shot, now I'm goin' through his pockets 
 He won't be needin no dollars where he's goin' 
 And when I get to hell I'ma act like I don't know him 
 I'm takin' everything that ain't bolted to the floor 
 And before I go I steal the knocker of your front door 
 Let me be free for I'm a thief and a gangster 
 Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Fingers 
 ("Yeah we want everything... do you have any dreams, we want them too")
