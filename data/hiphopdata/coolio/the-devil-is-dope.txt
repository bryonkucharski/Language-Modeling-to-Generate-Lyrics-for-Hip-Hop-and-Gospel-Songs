If you free your mind your ass got to go too 
 Cought up in that same old pattern, trapped as a homie 
 Couldn't go through, searching for answers without no questions 
 Never thought it could happen to you and your crew 
 But your blood is no sexual, started out frontin' it was all 'bout kicks 
 And each and every kick seem to turn out to be a trick 
 Imagine this, they have no family, they got no ends 
 They got no hustle, no muscle, no car no crew, they got no friends 
 Once all in the neighbourhood bouncing tall 
 No G living life as walking dog 
 Niggas hate to admit it but they know it's true 
 They're running down the hood having kids wanna be just like you 
 Here I stand as a witness, trying saying, claiming, selling a victim 
 Get just spit 'cause it's a sick ass system 
 You can roll when I'm rolling out from the smoke 
 Somebody take a vote, the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (out of control) the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (out to get your soul) the devil is dope 
 Pain seen, only imagine in my dream 
 The same nightmare screamin' on the scene and the TV screen 
 'Cause if I told that, 'round your waste I have to tie you 
 Everything is going black, a little bit of that, picture that 
 But you still can't see the thug around is demon 
 You need cocaine if he's tripping around then scream 
 Traffic is slow so you come to work at 5 
 So you're dancing 'round your consience and try to stay alive 
 Now you try to play hockey with some chicks 
 Niggas tell you to kick that and kick back, but you did that 
 And all money ain't good money 
 But everyone wants the cream and honey 
 They can have the other side as well that is so sunny 
 But loves only jealousy, leaves people here to grieve 
 From AC to old G to BG toBC 
 How did you call when you choked from all the smoke 
 Murder he smokes, the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (out of control) the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (out to get your soul) the devil is dope 
 Sunshine on your mind but darkness revile 
 You move yourself from hotel to hotel 
 Free records and a glass from cash to ash 
 Blood shit off your whole blown personality crash 
 And as your task try to make a milk ticket 
 So you can kick in and stripp with your chickens, but 
 You's the picked man since you got your own mind 
 It ain't hard and your fault but you gotta make your own time 
 Choose your weapon 'cause you're the first to wrestle 
 Often dictators in situations that you find yourself cought in 
 If you're still blind and you can't see 
 You better obtain yourself some glasses and clear your vision like dmc 
 I remember what I told you, remember who are the soldiers 
 I wonder who are the strangers 
 'Cause there's too large amount of danger 
 Man I'm on board am I the under lord 
 Put your ass on the boat, the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (out to get you soul) the devil is dope 
 Listen, the devil is dope (oh lord lord lord) the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope, you better believe it, you better believe it 
 You better believe it, you better believe it, the devil is dope 
 The devil is dope (so much, so much pain) the devilis dope
