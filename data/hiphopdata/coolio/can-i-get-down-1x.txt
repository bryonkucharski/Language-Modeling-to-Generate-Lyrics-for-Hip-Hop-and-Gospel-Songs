I'm gettin' bunions from all the disrespectful sisters in my face 
 I give love 
 But when push come to shove 
 I'm 'posed to solo 
 Diggin me out the ditch 
 (Hey, hey, Cool, give me some chips, fool) Ain't that a bitch 
 Ain't no cash just fallin' out the sky 
 You hella high 
 But why why did she touch the tie? 
 But I start on full wit a gangsta limp 
 Morris couldn't see this pimp 
 I'm backslappin gimps 
 True, I'll be in the cut, but you notice me 
 Try to throw with me 
 Now you wanna roll with me, fate 
 I'll lead you left instead of right 
 Tonight's the night 
 So, let's get the situation tight 
 I hear 'em tryin' to playa hate me on the under 
 My momma said, "Never let a sucker take you asunder" 
 Don't be gettin' outta line where it concerns mine 
 It might be your time, but it's my rhyme 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care? 
 Can I get down one time without 
 All the criticism and media in my business? 
 Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
 And speak my mind? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 I take my picture with a smile like Jack 
 'Cause I'm back 
 You picturin all them chips in stack 
 I got love, though, don't be no stank hoe 
 I'm not fallin' for the gank, yo 
 God I thank, though 
 Enemies it's your decision 
 The gift I been givin' 
 Got you in the life I'm livin' 
 Watch your sane, sane like Marley Mike 
 Your game ain't right 
 You be slippin every night 
 I'm hoverin up in the nest with the claws out 
 'Cause he had his paws out 
 When he paused out 
 He's out, now it's in with the new 
 In with the two 
 You know how these thieves do 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care? 
 Can I get down one time without 
 All the criticism and media in my business? 
 Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
 And speak my mind? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 I can't do what I want, or how I wanna 
 This shit is drama 
 So what is it you want, huh? 
 We tryin' to make it to the tizzy 
 I'll be a hella busy bee 
 The gizzy 
 Through the frizzy, is we 
 Tryin' to have somethin' 
 We goin' off frontin 
 Cause nothin' leaves nothin' 
 And nothin' means we head bumpin 
 Pumpin, no punk can hit this, my stable 
 Twistin me a fable 
 Somethin' sweet like sable 
 You shoulda reached out and grabbed it and got his pay nice 
 Jealousy got him dropped, with his neck sliced 
 Liquor be revelain 
 The homies true feelins 
 So, I be willin' 
 To turn into a villain 
 Then if you're still with me 
 You got to chill with me 
 Bustin' lyrics with a skill when they deal with me 
 Never senseless 
 Thank you for your business 
 And I got more rhymes 
 Than L.A. Times got headlines 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care? 
 Can I get down one time without 
 All the criticism and media in my business? 
 Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
 And speak my mind? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care? 
 Can I get down one time without 
 All the criticism and media in my business? 
 Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
 And speak my mind? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care? 
 Can I get down one time without 
 All the criticism and media in my business? 
 Can I get down one time and release my rhyme 
 And speak my mind? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time? 
 Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah 
 And nobody wont care?

 All the criticism and media in my business?
