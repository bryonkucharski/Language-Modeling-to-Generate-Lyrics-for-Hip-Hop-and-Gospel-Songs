What you gonna play now 
 Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. 
 Every geto got a different name, but they all the same 
 So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game 
 We got homies who sell straps 
 Homies who sell crack 
 Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks that's a fact 
 Cause, you from the neighborhood niggas love 
 Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, ganstas, and thugs 
 To unwrap the strap before you know what 
 The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck 
 And broke all of the sills where the big G's live 
 The little homie be gettin' out on account 
 This time he might get stuck attempted 
 One eight seven and he's a minor with pride 
 So the DA want him tried as an adult 
 The big homey just had a son no joking 
 I think his baby's mom is smoking 'cause she always broke 
 And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy 
 And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense 
 To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras 
 Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders 
 Be your own good ride 
 Right right 
 These are the geto hilites 
 To the niggas who smokin' indo chocolate tired of stress 
 Niggas who got warrants out for their arrest 
 Be your own good ride

 These are the geto hilites 
 Slap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin' 
 Dead cats in the street playing craps 
 Niggas catchin dice with they feet 
 Think they got the funk that one fool got stoked out 
 'Cause he's a mark with a gun 
 The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now 
 One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch 
 Liscence and registration 
 "All I got is a drivers permit" 
 Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip 
 Welcome to Southern California 
 Liquor stores and churches on every other corner 
 Your little brother plays pop warner 
 Darks raided the dope spot 
 Eight year old kid got shot 'cause they mistook his BB gun for a glok 
 And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano 
 He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh 
 I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state 
 He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8 
 Hey the homiez kickin' it real

 Sometimes it's just like that in the hood

 To the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up 
 The house parties that's gonna always get shot up

 All the niggers who loced up during the L.A. riots 
 Be your own good ride

 The nigger with all 16 switches sitting ODs 
 Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat 
 Pulling sex in through his back 
 Now his momma ain't all black 
 And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade 
 They carried their dead homey to his grave 
 Pour out a little liquor 
 Homegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting 
 Thicker 
 Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs 
 For forty bucks so what's up 
 Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper 
 Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper 
 His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike 
 While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike 
 The little homey just tripped and stripped 
 Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped 
 That's right 
 OG's joining the nation and it's all good 
 Big G's is retaliating 'cause they enemies are crossed out the hood 
 Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks 
 Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex 
 Be your own good ride 
 Right right 
 These are the geto hilites 
 Young niggas going to school to be a doctor 
 Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters 
 Be your own good ride 
 Right right

 To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank 
 Rollin' D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks 
 Be your own good ride

 Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up.
