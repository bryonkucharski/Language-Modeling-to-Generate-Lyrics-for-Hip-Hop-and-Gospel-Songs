 I love it when we're cruisin' together 
 Baby get in we fixin' to cruise till we can't 
 You got the drink I got the denk and we done stopped at the bank 
 Sunbeamin' this weekend heading down that beach way 
 Messin' with my girl's hair one of them games that we play 
 Braids bouncin' to the beat feel me coming down the street 
 She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me so 
 Shine up your hoopty and fall in line 
 Bring your honey if she's fine and we gon have a good time 
 To the outskirts of first buzzin off the erky jerks 
 Swoopin while I puts in work now watch me skirt 
 I heard 'em callin' me but then I ball and see 
 'Cause if you're ballin' me you got your own set of keys 
 The breeze is hittin' don't think you'll catch me strippin' 
 40 Thevz Wino and gat got that back when we're dippin 
 To the west coast down south in your direction 
 Throwin' up the hood cruisin' come on we jettin'

 Cruisin' is made for love 
 Cruisin' is made for us

 Come on in my lap get in an' twist the cap 
 Hand him the jizz back clowin up the coast like that 
 Take a ray all nice in back seat pete 
 Just do a rollin' top down ready to hit the street 
 Shoulder to shoulder turn their heads 'cause it's a black thing 
 Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped won't be no jacket 
 Consider that chocolate, mixed with that tie 
 Wind be on my neck the beach caress my thighs now I hope he's high 
 Ready to get my groove on so I'm playing teams 
 Know when he's feelin' me, and what those feelin's be 
 Kinda' flossy cause tossy we do it on seat tip 
 Snuggled up freaky dick give the drink a sip 
 Leaning on his chest I feel security 
 Just my man and me against the world you understandin' me 
 Cruisin' till the sunsets yep we'll be headin out 
 Dippin' through the city me and my niggys what I'm talkin' about

 Sunday afternoons in the tape deck 
 My woman's on the right lookin' bomb for this trek deck 
 Floatin' on the freeway at a cool 65 
 Malika rolls the top so's I can feel that rocky mountain high yeah 
 Take the wheel while I shake off this hairbrush 
 Yep I'm down the bus like no one like what 
 Watchin' the sunset be the flyest with the top down 
 Park up at the spot I ain't gonna front I'm tryin' to mess around 
 Your homies still around 
 Yeah they busy though 
 That's all I need to know roll up the windows and lock the door 
 It's all that poppin' on that cooze got me worked up 
 Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some 
 Yeah that's how we do it on the western hemisphere 
 All my homies be a man cause ain't no pretendin' 
 Cruisin feel the wind blow my brain back 
 Trippin' off into the night bumpin' to a fat track yeah
