We meet every single day at the same old place 
 At the same old time 
 With the same state of mind 
 Me and her together but we know it ain't forever 
 We just happy for the time 
 The weed and the wine 
 The walks in the park, escapades in the dark 
 We knew how it had to be right 
 From the very start 'cause 
 I got obligations and she's in the situation 
 That she came to state, so this is our fate 
 Holding hands, a smile, a glimpse 
 A kiss and a dance but we can't take a chance on 
 Gettin' caught 
 So we stick to a plan 'cause 
 We both got another and they wouldn't understand it 
 Me and Mrs Jones have a thing going on 
 I wouldn't call it love but it damn sure strong 
 It ain't about doin' dirt 
 Or living like a flirt 
 But what they don't know don't hurt 
 Me and Mrs Jones 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones 
 The very first time I met her I 
 Saw her from across the room 
 And instantly we both became consumed by the thought 
 Of she and I being together so I 
 Headed in her direction for some closer inspection 
 I intentionally brushed her hand her 
 Skin had a satin texture 
 The feeling she gave me was 
 More than I could measure and 
 Right away I 
 Knew I had to have her with me 
 If not with me then maybe just to hit me 
 She got pin point skill and percision in the walk 
 And the way that she talk 
 Make my mouth turn to chalk 
 She give me everything that I don't get at home 
 And it seems like I'm a man 'cause her's is always gone, now 
 Tell me what love got to do with it 
 No 'cause we both feel good when we kickin' it 
 Some might say that I'm wrong and I should leave her alone 
 But me and Mrs Jones got a thang goin' on 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones 
 It's been about a year since we've been seeing eachother 
 And we're a whole lot more than just part time lovers 
 'Cause when I got a problem she do everything she can to solve 'em 
 But her life is not revolved around how revolving 
 I'm the Shaka Zulu and she's my fantasie, but 
 Deep down inside we know that we can never be 
 Any more than what we are, a phone call in the car 
 Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar 
 When all of a sudden right out of the blue my 
 Ladie got a clue on 
 What what we was up to and 
 Wait a minute, damn 
 From what I understand 
 It seems that my woman's been talking to her man 
 Since we both in love with the people at home 
 It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone 
 'Cause I got a woman and she got a man so 
 That's how it goes, and that's how it is 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 (We had a thang goin') 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones 
 (We got a thing going on) 
 Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones, oh yeah 
 We used to meet at the same place 
 Same time 
 Used to sit and talk it over 
 (We got a thing going on) 
 Talk it over 
 Me and Mrs Jones, Mrs Jones 
 Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
