Get your back, call tomorrow, life is borrowed 
 All your tears in sorrow and bring it back and that's a fact 
 Where would you be at, make sure you're pushin' harder to it 
 The game was changed when the bullshit was brought here 
 Our sets are fallin' now they live in love 
 We got five bucks or four reproduction of the clothing and gloves 
 You rather see me in a cell, than see me make my mail 
 And when the story he tell, he trying to make you fail 
 Trying to make some money lope but money makes no man 
 If you have no pen than you have no money in your hand 
 We're so dope, dive and steal, anything but paid for real 
 Damn you folks, if you wouldn't choked when you forgot to keep it real 
 Cops came back, rubbers in the back 
 What you snap when you couldn't lack 
 Now you feel the pressure when you didn't count your blessings 
 Now we're gone, you are alone 
 Told your mama that you was grown 
 One to the neck and three to the chest 
 When you ran for your life all alone 
 Now you're gone, now would your homies die for you, fool 
 I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 I've cacker-rouches in my black boots 
 Nigga we sued them till they were in the mud 
 We hold the coffin, it isn't possible they got away running muthafucka 
 In the dust, cought up in the ghetto tradegy 
 That makes a nigga to fall, unless he's tall 
 This is reality mixed with society 
 Families tored apart but this tearing apart was hard 
 Stand and askin' where is God, don't you try to play missunder Lord 
 And the rest has been said, say rest in peace 'cause my nigga is dead 
 Before they beginning to run and make everything go under 
 I'm gonna knock as hard as my mother not gonna wonder 
 'Cause I knew it'd be me 
 Everyone's coming gathering to see 
 Remain in flames what I used to be, this is no more R.I.P 
 You never know when they're coming to get ya 
 But have them bullets ready for protection 
 Take them bodies who has fallen as a collection 
 But when they attack, you gotta go, we're under control 
 We gather to squeese us 
 We hope many men will recover in smoke 
 'Cause we never die in casulties, and we are the casulties of war 
 We are the casulties of war, we are the casulties of war 
 I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 I saw them coming from a mile away 
 I couldn't stay I had to make my getaway, I lived to find another day 
 That's how it goes when this game we play 
 Everybody on board got a price to pay 
 You better pay attention to what I say, go to Hell if you don't pray 
 These streets are hard, walkin' down the Boulevard 
 Like walkin' through a prison yard 
 You never know when the bullets fly off 
 The pressure is on your money, boy beginning to fall 
 And your name gotta be strong to make them fools run from court 
 Oh man you're in jail but you can't call your crew 
 'Cause those niggas don't used to be a crew, now they're after you, ooh 
 People seen that you used to be a teen 
 But you ran against the Benz, niggas on the scene 
 I guess they sucked out your brain, cut you in your jeans 
 Lucky you're not what they hate but they beat up what they see 
 Don't you ever go 'round and scream it separates the boys from men 
 Cought your closest on your seat 
 And that's my dearest fairest friend 
 I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 (We are the casulties of war 
 We are the casulties of war 
 We are the casulties of war) 
 I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right 
 No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight 
 (We are the casulties of war 
 We are the casulties of war 
 We are the casulties of war) 
 We are the casulties of war
