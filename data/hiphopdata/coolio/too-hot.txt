Everybody listen up 'cause I'm about to get my speak on 
 Fools be trippin' when it's time to get their freak on 
 Runnin' round town, puttin' it down without no protection 
 For they erection 
 When it's time for selection, what's your direction 
 Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection 
 If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then 
 Let me explain now 
 Iesha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina 
 And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her 
 Javier slept wit Lupe and Lupe slept with Rob 
 'Cause he was rollin' on beads and had a good ass job 
 Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve, and 
 Steve was positive H.I.V. 
 What started off as a plan ended up in the plot 
 Ya betta cool ya ass off 'cause it's too damn hot 
 Oh-oh it's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady (too hot) 
 Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade 
 It's too hot (too hot) too hot, homie (too hot) 
 Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made 
 You're doin' everything momma told you not to do 
 Now you're tryin' to walk away cause you know it's true 
 Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed 
 To admit you both have the same last name 
 I don't have to ask you where you've been 
 Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn 
 "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," that was the slogan 
 But now it's '95, and it's "Don't forget the Trojan" 
 Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her 
 Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin' niggaz 
 Love is the word seldom meant, but often heard 
 Latex, safe sex, you better learn 
 Or get hip to the facts before you react, or 
 End up in a box on your back 
 Sometimes you ask for what you want and get what you got 
 Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot 
 Oh-oh it's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady (too hot) 
 Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade 
 It's too hot (too hot) too hot, homie (too hot) 
 Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made 
 Another day in the city and, oh, what a pity 
 Even though we did our duty, things are still lookin' shitty 
 Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin' to make some scratch 
 Walkin' in the rain, but they ain't got no hat 
 Understand how we livin' in the '90's, loc 
 Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke 
 Sex, lies, videotape and rape 
 Just a little bump-n-grind can seal your fate 
 We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin' tragic 
 And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic 
 Everybody and they momma preachin' abstinence, these 
 Kids ain't checkin' for absti-shit 
 So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust 
 Another victim of the lust, in God we trust 
 What started off as a plan ended up in the plot 
 Water can't cool it off 'cause it's too damn hot 
 Oh-oh it's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady (too hot) 
 Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade 
 It's too hot (too hot) too hot, homie (too hot) 
 Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made 
 (Listen to Coolio) It's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady 
 (This message comes from Coolio) Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade 
 (Listen to Coolio) It's too hot (too hot) too hot, homie 
 (This message comes from Coolio) Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made 
 (Listen to Coolio) It's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady 
 (This message comes from Coolio) Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade 
 It's too hot 
 Yeah, that it, J.T., that's how we do it right there
