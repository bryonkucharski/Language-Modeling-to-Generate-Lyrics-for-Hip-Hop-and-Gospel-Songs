Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 I'm sittin' at the bar with a hundred dollar bill 
 The homies is runnin' late so I got some time to kill 
 I'm peepin' out this freak in the booth in the corner 
 I think I seen her rollin' a Noble, nosin under and moanin 
 Two hookers walked in and they was lookin' for a vic 
 But they, kept on passin' me by 'cause they can recognize a trick 
 Twenty minutes later and two double shots of yak 
 I take a look up at the clock, now where the FUCK the homies at 
 I feel my pagers on my hipbone, who could it be 
 'Cause I done talked to everybody that I was 'sposed to see 
 Hahaa! Now I know, the story is told 
 And I don't even call 'em back 'cause they don't know the homie cold 
 I received a page my niggers from the phone in the back 
 I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black 
 Another double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin' 
 But that's only the beginning, god damn! 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 I take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and 
 See if I see the homies, but they still ain't there 
 There's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it 
 I was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it 
 I opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away 
 So mister policeman, you can put your chalk away 
 I mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table 
 Cause, niggaz be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal 
 The homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think 
 Homegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink 
 She's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar 
 Doing tricks with her tongue and a cherry like a porno star 
 The club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin' 
 Another double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin' 
 She's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded 
 It's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 Now I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic 
 The big homey done erected, damn I've been affected 
 By the funk in the boom and the booty in the room 
 This ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom 
 Now I'm mackin and struttin and asking baby wassup 
 My name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump 
 Let's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans 
 We can do a little drinkin', and do a little smoking 
 When all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin' 
 I hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds* 
 Ah shit, I got baby on her titties 
 I guess there go my chances of gettin' with her kitty 
 I turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with 
 Long ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's 
 Now I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk 
 'Cause I got too high and uh, got too drunk 
 Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk 
 Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball 
 (Big throw up S-P-L-A-S-H) 
 SHIT!
