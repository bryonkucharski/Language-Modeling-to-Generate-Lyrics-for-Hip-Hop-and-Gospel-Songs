When night falls over the city 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me 
 It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area 
 And every night it's gettin' a little bit more scarier 
 The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick 
 People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this 
 Death and destruction 
 With no instruction 
 Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption 
 How can I escape this mind state that I'm in? 
 I been tryin', but it seems that I can't win 
 I've fallen and I can't get up 
 And the homies that was my homies went and set me up 
 Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain 
 I tried to act a hard male runnin' cocaine 
 But it still don't ease my pain 
 Am I insane or a victim of my own fears? 
 What's goin' on we supposed to be happy here 
 God don't make no junk that's what I been told 
 But it seems to me that God ain't in control 
 When night falls over the city (When the night falls) 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Feels like somebody) 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (When the night falls) 
 When night falls over the city (When the night falls, Ooh-yeah) 
 I gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me) 
 I need assistance, but all I get is resistance 
 I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant 
 I'm scared to turn around 'cause I know somebody's watching 
 I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin on me 
 And scheamin, I wish I was dreamin' 
 If my mind was free I could chase away the demons 
 But in ain't, and they still can't understand that 
 All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man 
 The same old pattern has got me goin' crazy, loc 
 Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke 
 Is this a sequel? 
 Are all men created equal? 
 The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal 
 And now we swimmin in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!) 
 Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!) 
 And now I'm startin to feel like I might come up missin' 
 I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen 
 When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city) 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me) 
 When night falls (When the night falls, yeah) over the city 
 I gotta be ready cause it feels like (I wanna be) 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin') 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 I'm feelin' oppressed, this stifle 
 My life is trifle 
 No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle 
 And my pistol, I'm seein stars and hearin whistles 
 One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle 
 Wont stay to state side 
 Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side 
 So stay your ass on the plate side 
 There's nothin' to fear but the fear itself 
 And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth 
 Do I have power or do I have no self control? 
 These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold 
 Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G 
 And, will we fight this battle for eternity 
 I blame you cause my mind is not my own 
 So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone 
 I'm your creation 
 The product of a twisted nation 
 Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!) 
 When night falls (When the sun goes down) over the city (Over the city) 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (Somebody help me!) 
 When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city) 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Over the city, over the city, over the city!) 
 Somebody's comin' to get me 
 When night falls (When the night falls) over the city 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me 
 When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over!) 
 Gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me 
 When night falls over the city 
 I gotta be ready cause it feels like 
 Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me, get me, get me, get me, get me) 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
