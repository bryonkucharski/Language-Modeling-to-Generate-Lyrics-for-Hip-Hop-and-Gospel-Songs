5:30 in the morning and I haven't been to sleep 
 A pair of raggedly ass ProWings on my feet 
 Ten dollars in my pocket and now I'm on the creep 
 To the double-up spot 'cause the shit is comin' cheap 
 It's 1984 and the rocks is all fat 
 Southern California, LA is where it's at 
 I'm smokin' like a motherfuckin choo-choo train 
 Big cocaine inside my brain, ah 
 But nobody knows that I'm on the hype 
 Use to be in CREAM, well now I hit the pipe 
 Face sucked in, yellow tooth grin 
 No bitches, no friends, no ends to spend 
 I'm stuck like a rat in a sticky ass trap 
 And I sold everything but my motherfuckin gat 
 I got a habit like a rabbit and I wanna stop it 
 But I can't 'cause I'm locked 'n' da closet 
 Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life 
 Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life 
 Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life 
 Listen homey 
 No rehabilitation, no wantin to talk to... 
 Doin' crimes on every fuckin' place I can walk to 
 I still get props in the hood when I stroll by 
 'Cause niggas don't know that I'm smokin' like Popeye 
 Mama's in the kitchen cookin rice 
 Daddy's in the pen doin' life 
 Sister gotta husband, she's a wife 
 And I'm in the backyard hittin the pipe 
 It's been three or four months since I started usin' 
 It's a uphill battle and now I know I'm losin 
 I go to the spots where my face ain't familiar 
 And I cook here jack 'cause I don't know these niggas 
 I'm livin' like a peasant and it ain't pleasant 
 I think I need to change my direction 
 I got the five dollar piece now I'm all in the carpet 
 In the dark 'cause I'm locked 'n' da closet 
 Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell 
 Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell 
 Do me a favour, open the door and let 'em have it 
 Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 One year done passed and now I'm lookin' dusty 
 Disgusted because my own mama don't trust me 
 My sister's on the trip 'cause she knows I'm on the hit 
 And I can't take this shit 
 There's a rumour goin' round that I'm puffin heavily 
 And my neighbours is lookin' at me crazy, G 
 I guess they figured out that I broke in they house 
 And stole all they shit while they was out 
 My sister told my aunt and my aunt told Pam 
 And Pam let it slip to that bitch Roxanne 
 Roxanne told Bill and Bill told Duke 
 Now the whole hood knows that I play the flute 
 But before I lost my respect 
 I didda lick your dumb ass on a jet, SHIT! 
 Now I'm back to life, yeah I'm back to reality 
 Ain't no side effects or technicalities 
 There's one thing about it when your life is fucked 
 At the bottom the only way to go is up, ah 
 No more cocaine bitches 
 I kick the door off the motherfuckin hinges 
 I'm out the closet *screaming* 
 Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell 
 Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell 
 Do me a favour, open the door and let 'em have it 
 Let 'em have it 
 Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell 
 Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell 
 Do me a favour, open the door and let 'em have it 
 Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah
