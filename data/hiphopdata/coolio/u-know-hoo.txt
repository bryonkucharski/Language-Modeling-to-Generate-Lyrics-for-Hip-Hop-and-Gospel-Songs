Aiyo Coolio, what's up with all these fools always poppin' off at the lip 
 Talkin' about the last sucka to fuck up, and stuff like that, loc, what's up? 
 Yeah, don't believe everything you read, fool 
 Nah, they know what time it is 
 But, you know, for those who don't know 
 I think it's time that we step to the mic and set the record straight 
 Aiyo, G 
 We're gon' do it like this 
 Why don't you tell 'em who you're down with loc 
 Right 
 All you niggas run and tell a friend, um 
 Bad mutha fuckas is bad again 
 MAAD Circle's in the house for the ninety fo' and 
 If I tell I got a fo'ty four and 
 I shoot they ass up like rifleman 
 'Cause I never wore a suit made by Dapper Dan 
 Them punk mutha fuckas be hittin' me up 
 And I hit 'em right back 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 So throw your mutha fucking M in the sky 
 If the nigga next to you ain't down, bust him in the eye 
 If you leaped up your seat you met your doom 
 Big G could start a fight in an empty room 
 You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with crazy tunes 
 Wino, Billy Boy, P.S. and Spoon 
 I don't give a fuck about you or your crew 
 (I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who) 
 Brothers of the mother MAAD Circle 
 I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who 
 Nigga clear the lane, get the kids off the street 
 It's the one nine nine fo' and *sniffing* I smell booty 
 Stank ass skag mutha fucka wanna basket 
 Getting paid by you niggas from the nigga Dub' C 
 The quicker to sticker, sucka nigga killa, bust it 
 Yo Coolio, what's up with these punk mutha fuckas 
 (I don't know) 
 Don't they know, um 
 I gets busy like Illegal 
 Flow like water 
 Drop bomb shit like a seagull 
 A janky ass nigga known to sag 
 And like Old English, I'm setting mutha fuckas on they ass 
 Diggin' graves for the braves, that's a trade when I flow 
 Decapitating rappers and pissin' down they throats 
 'Cause I'm the, rusty mac pistol macking 
 And like Mike Tyson, baby, my style is (causing static) 
 And jabbin' stabbin' mutha fucka you don't want static 
 Nineteen ninety fo' and you cowards all done had it 
 These ol' whack ass niggas getting popped for record deals 
 I'm broke 'cause it take no skills to pay the bills 
 But that's all right because I gotta kill a crew 
 (I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who) 
 Brothers of the mother MAAD Circle 
 I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who 
 Another day, another dollar, I'll be there when ya holla 
 It's the skanded ass, sticky face, alleway scholar 
 I dip two sticks off a ten dollar, fold it 
 Turn it to the hook and kick in the door 
 May all the traytons be forgot 
 But if you're steppin' to the Circle we'll connect your dots 
 I, always feel like somebody's watchin' me 
 And, even though you're watchin, you can't stop a G 
 'Cause I been where you're goin' and I know what you see 
 You might build a rep, but not on the C, double O to the L to the I to the O 
 With the mutha fucking god damn flow 
 So, fuck it, fuck it, fo' niggas in a bucket 
 Wit an old ass janky thirty eight causing ruckus 
 Yo be a fool tryin' to step to the crew 
 (I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who) 
 Brothers of the mother MAAD Circle 
 I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who 
 Un huh 
 All you punk ass mutha fuckas 
 The real steel is in the heel for year feel 
 Brand new, we're nowhere a year ago, yeah 
 We're not cooking ya crew, beeyotch
