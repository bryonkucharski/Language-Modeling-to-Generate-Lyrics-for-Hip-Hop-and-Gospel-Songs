It's best you let me wander or I'll taunt 
 Ya with my brain 
 I'm the editor-in-chief, 
 The leaf-a-rap a dope shit, antique 
 Rope kits for the hang time, a 
 Heinous crime 
 'Cause I drain his mind. Open it up, 
 Oh... not 
 The same as mine, not the same ass 
 Rhyme 
 Nickel plated statements with nickel 
 Plated 
 Knuckle faded faces. No matter what 
 The Race is I hope ya cockpit got shit, 
 I stock 
 Hits. Inventory glorious. I owe me this 
 I'm on my homies shit - the homeless 
 Shown 
 This skill is real when I attack from 
 The 
 Back I'll say a rhyme then pull your 
 Spinal 
 Cord from your torso, more so or 
 Better 
 Yet more or less it's not an option 
 I'm coppin' 
 A plea seizing a shop and hopin' a 
 Cop's 
 A blow of the past. If not, I'll be 
 Blowin' 
 His ass away. J. Groove is on the cross, I'm 
 The heavyweight fader of a playa 
 Hayta 
 Analysis is deep, forever on the peep 
 And I'm 
 The best, the crest of the ho shit... 
 Yeah, 
 You can't manifest destiny unless it's 
 Me 
 Oh, you don't approve of my moves 
 But I'm not 
 Starvin' for jargon, so save it. 
 My libido is 
 The needle to the wax, I like to tax in 
 Gazebos, surviving like a mac king, 
 Clever 
 Never lacking when I'm stacking 
 Endeavors 
 I try and try to tell fools, that I've been 
 Through hell and my tools ain't the same 
 As yours. Coors Light that's what 
 They're 
 Drinkin', must be I'm wrong yours is 
 Right 
 That's why you're sinkin' in your own 
 Sight 
 Nose is in my business, witnessin' 
 Your 
 Own fate, drownin' in your own lake 
 Of hate 
 But I don't see no abstinent crabs in it 
 Perverse perpin' after the salt I can 
 Hear the rehearsal of a serpent, 
 Urgent 
 'Cause you don't use your head when 
 You 
 Shed skin - dead end... for a playa 
 Hayta 
 Charades, are played but I keep 
 Getting it in 
 Large amounts because I be doin' 
 These Hoogies' charge account like a banker 
 I'm patient and I be waiting like an 
 Anchor 
 To spank her. Then I get the softy 
 Sanka 
 Coffee drinkin' breath stinkin' 
 Cheddar cheese 
 Eatin' wheat germ, checker board 
 Pants 
 Wearin' can't dance, and you're starin' in 
 My grill. But you had a steak 
 A nervous 
 Twitch and you're a badly fake and I 
 Heard 
 His bitch is gettin' around like Tupac 
 Servin' niggas two at a time like she 
 Got 
 Two cocks. New blocks she be conquering 
 Zip codes, I rip ho's that be lappin' up 
 Mark ass lames then charge it to the 
 Game. So he next time you step to 
 Me 
 Like a defense attorney, Ha!...I'll 
 Fade ya 
 'Cause you're a playa hayta. 
 From a real playa ' 'cause I play the 
 Game 
 The same, not behind no dame, so 
 You 
 Can get these thangs
