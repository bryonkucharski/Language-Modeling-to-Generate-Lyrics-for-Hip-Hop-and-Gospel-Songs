I'm accurate secure my spot there be no hot 
 Seats don't trick sweet treats even if I'm 
 Stiffer than a swisher easy going when I'm sleep warlike 
 It's when I attack untight mike masses 
 Don't conceal ya feel breed if you're exceeded 
 By who is this myself I demean so my dream 
 Of being a hiphop master won't shatter 
 Like plaster sample savior sup shallow taste 
 It peculiar rare, file no aroma of a coma substance 
 Is vicious vile wicked you can't fuck with the twisted 
 Winding sizeable you've stumbled into hazy ill-defined 
 Room ya shrumed ya self butt naked ya nothin' but 
 Chosen prunes frozen fumes 
 Saafir will be here like landscape 
 I'll scrape ya ass off the reel 
 You've been edited I'm enriched fit 
 Full blown 11x13 it seems at first word 
 Seeing is no believing unless your vision is blurred 
 From these cutesy, cutesy new boodies on rap I'm rilin 
 Up a muthy gats being pushed in ya Saliva 
 Opening the file of a masterpiece 
 Is where I lease my space 
 I rope dope styles like cows ram them in your ass 
 Baby, oh! and this time I didn't forget the gravy 
 Pay me my respect check one hobo immovable spirit 
 I was brought here solely for the lyrics 
 I have no time for your unsubliminal earthly 
 I'll be lurkin on the b-side slidin in sideways 
 On the edge straight servin' them I'm on some reap bitch 
 Shit shut up fall silent no perfume 
 I'll stay funky musty with this custody 
 I've mastered my adrenalin sendin souls to afterlife 
 Like Mussolini I'm like Houdini who can see me 
 I'm the same color of the sun if you have no pigment 
 You'll get burned charred to a crisp 
 Refreshing drink I think you need a sip of this 
 'Cause you're this close to a lip of the wrist 
 And the thing you value the most 
 Life please let there be another entity 
 To devour proficient effective 
 When I think you should offer your feces 
 I'm going to revel and defile in the prostitution 
 Of the potency words swarmin teamin up 
 Pain will be equivalent to the unteethin of a pup 
 The force tell you don't prolong yaself 
 Ya too noticeable to the graduated continuing 
 It's amazing how your reproductive system works 
 Of art develop blossom gain grow 
 I see the unholy gain green in ya 
 Seems magnify move up I prefer ya 
 Raise ya cup why don't ya raise ya skirt 
 Well I'm pleased to see that you don't have the 
 Correct knees for the job off my nob by far 
 Sighted only in infrared ya not prepared to spar 
 With a heavyweight, dwelling repelling freshmens 
 Propelling them back to the guf look it up I'm puffy 
 Like my man from uptown for those weak 
 Don't provoke or speak or it spells an abrupt downtown 
 Trip, from the hips what's that smell of ass 
 We've past that point I have custody joint
