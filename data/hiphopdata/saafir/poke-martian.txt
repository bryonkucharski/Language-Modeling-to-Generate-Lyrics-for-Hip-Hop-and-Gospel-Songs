My septic's anti on the skeptical 
 Who jocks 
 And disavow ya actions, 
 Who's your agent 
 2nd letter 'cause you're actin' like 
 A charlatan not 
 Let's say your froidian slips 
 On transmissions kicked daily 
 Don't let perpetual lies be the reason 
 Why 
 Treason play the seasonin' 
 On the pessimism in your thoughts 
 Meager is you game - hand, no 
 Trumps 
 As teep mentat poke martian, 
 Caught 'cha frontin' 
 I peeped ya from da jump 
 I take it for true that plagiarism 
 Captivates, your vision is blurred, 
 Your head's swollen, crab 
 You irritate my scrotum 
 I recognize the pattern of your ways, 
 Your swaze 
 Portrayed on the relay, some say 
 Another one of you is born every day 
 No, better yet, I'm not one to even take it that far 
 Yo! Where's that fuckin' bluestar...
