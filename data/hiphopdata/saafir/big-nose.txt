Released I'm down count it's a 
 Lifestyle for the regular 
 No five. O you may catch me in some 
 Old British Knights 
 Some mark fives no cellular hobo 
 Brova's are ready to go 
 Concentrate fundamentals I extend 
 My defense give my man the ric some 
 Breathin' room fresh air see sparks 
 As he strikes the bounce 
 Is on 'cause brova's got runnyn' pass 
 Game the aim is for me to rip 
 Shit up I like nut in ya cup I don't give 
 A motherfuckin' fuck 
 Wit style it's the bignose the pro-file is 
 Ta rip brova's be pullin' 
 Cards it's the bignose (I'm out)
