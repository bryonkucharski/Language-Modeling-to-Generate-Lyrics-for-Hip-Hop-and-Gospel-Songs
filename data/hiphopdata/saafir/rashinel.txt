For it's Rashinel the antecdote to 
 What's wack 
 Confirmed by my urban platoon 
 Running past idle chatter 
 Leaning towards a means green trend 
 But I bend in the 
 Opposite direction like an enormous 
 Entity I'm incredible 
 But granted you can still see me 
 Victim of my own imagination 
 Hobo Junction attach the name to 
 Greatness I escalate the 
 Fat while most are just weightless 
 That eclipse the loss of 
 Gravity coming from the inner starting 
 At the bone cavity 
 Disrupting bone marrow worse than 
 The worst case of AIDS 
 I'm enclosed by the underground so I 
 Seek shade in caves 
 Hard to surpass cement see we pave 
 The way soft limericks 
 Lure me to the streets of fury if a 
 Nigga try to strike I'm like 
 The devile always open for business to 
 Bring hell on earth 
 And knock everybody senseless
