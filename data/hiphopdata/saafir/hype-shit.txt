You like classics well I'll stock that ass 
 Wit a 454 hypo, nitro hooked through the trunk, 
 I'm a flowmaster monk you'll get smobbed on, 
 I'll smoke that ass like skunk. You better 
 Rotate them drums locate that hum, 
 No alignment, 
 My rhymes remind me of ya suspension, 
 Off to the left section off the strip. 
 Let's strike a got a 7-deuce mali with sauce 
 Brandy wine gloss, releighs edelbrock manifold 
 Header chrome kit, aluminum tips and I'm 
 Assumin he'll slip and want to race me 
 For some scratch. I'll hook 'em in and pretend 
 My shit ain't tight. Let him bite then suck his ass 
 At the light - red light, smash - green light, 
 I lit up a lotta stares, now he wanna fight, 
 Nigga swing ya shit, I gets up outta there 
 Just me and him on the B & M shift kit from a rich b-, 
 You wanna ride, unlock the shicks on tha cock, 
 I'm smockin engine blocks overheatin oil level 
 Rebels 'cause I'm rollin' in hype shit. 
 High speed chase down 280, I'm 
 Lookin' at my oil gauge & 
 It read "you can't fade me." I'm floatin 
 Through traffic 
 Laughin' 'n' shit but I wasn't trippin' 'cause I had a gat 
 Wit a clip under the seat, then I heard the loud speaker 
 Speak, "pull your ass over on the offramp & 
 Don't try to vamp." Heart was on thumpa, 
 The mark was on my bumper plus I had a zip 
 Of bomb on my lap, I couldn't dump the gat. 
 Going into custody can't fuck with that, plus 
 I got a 396 with a trick in my trunk & I'm not 
 Goin' out like a punk so I bounced - fuck it, 
 The way he was in me you would think his slary poppin'. 
 But I got mallory hook up & I'm not stoppin' for shit, 
 I'm smobbin through tricks and trucks. 
 5.0's gettin' 
 Sucked and I'm caught up in the rear-view, 
 Didn't see Linda Woo tryin' to merge lanes. 
 She almost hit me. Took the Richmond turn off, 
 Hit the switch on the nitro in a lean 
 I felt my shit was Christine, 
 I'm out like a motha fuckin' fiend, in hype shit.
