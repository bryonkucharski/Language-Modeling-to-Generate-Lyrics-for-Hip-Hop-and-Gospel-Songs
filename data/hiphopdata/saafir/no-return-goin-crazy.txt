In a slow silent walk I hear tha 
 Violent talk I hear them talk half 
 Asleep as they stalk what the man 
 Is in this moon I'm punctual 
 Like a star I've harbored 
 Death that stale taste embraced by 
 My 
 Breath such mysteries in kissin' these 
 She devils tell me ya pretty by the 
 Lamp in your attire nutthin at stake 
 I must vampire her retire mint funds 
 I switch the essence when I found 
 Out my girl was not a blesson 
 Hatred seeps in she sleeps in my 
 Man draws what's wrong? I'm taking 
 Life long leaps my freak was late by 
 The hour she's in the shower with 
 Him grim thoughts to nightmares 
 Women in millions when they sleep 
 Will reep the broth wraped in 
 Mummy's cloth a blurred touching 
 Who feels that delight I'll have you 
 On emotions walkin' butt naked down 
 Streets at night stripped of 
 Your stripes around ya mind a vine 
 Of thorns terrible beauty 
 Still born the spirit of pity whispered 
 But lyrics middi blistered into babies 
 These shady ladies be hatchin hades 
 You'll burn no return goin' crazy 
 Unnatural vices are fathered when 
 Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry 
 Season 
 Pry treason out the mask upon the 
 Hills 
 Where every little creek is shot with 
 Silver bullets that is no problem I 
 Have a barrel of assorted verbs let 
 Me pluck-one 
 Fuck you much too dwindled and 
 Harsh 
 Dead on white and cloudy clear 
 Saafir 
 Oh I'm ya son I'm told oh you mean 
 The 
 One that turns copper into brass 
 Asses 
 You got a weak chassis ya blood 
 Owns 
 No bones on the cash the selling of 
 Ass pockets dribble chestnuts and 
 I'm that pimp chimpmunk soakin 
 Sponge 
 Ya funds up I still roll with game 
 But lane changing slowly irritates the 
 Fuck out of me comes my confusion my 
 Mind 
 With images voices from my 
 Education 
 Said to me he must be killed sticks 
 And stones break him off touch his 
 Ash 
 No more hate puddles covered with 
 Glass the aborted birth from a 
 Burning 
 Bowel in a distorted earth woth 
 Phrases I fell mazes concocting 
 They're 
 Not going to feel me I got 
 Cockblocking 
 Jumping off a bridge Reg a fool I'm 
 Cooler 
 Than pool I'm deep deeper than a 
 Dimple 
 But my smile is not so simple 
 Impervious insert this shit you got to 
 Be 
 High to fade me fuck it let's go crazy 
 Don't you stare at me don't glare 
 At me what do I see a wound we 
 Have the exhibit of pain rugs wit 
 Bloodstains neckties and fangs eyes 
 Brains I'm coverin roads like Vogues 
 Drink the flows I'm telegraphing 
 This punch the hunchback of 
 Oakland unloadin on the spokin 
 Unconventional the stench of the 
 Arouses the nostrils of the hostile 
 I'm strange in my untried game 
 But I'll get the same response 
 But arise the paralyzation has been 
 Lifted Ponce de Leon couldn't find 
 This flow a fountain that spans 
 Beyond the mountains of a man's 
 Limitation comes the unhygenic 
 Schizophrenic I'm shittin in it 
 Don't phase me could it be that I'm 
 Goin' crazy.
