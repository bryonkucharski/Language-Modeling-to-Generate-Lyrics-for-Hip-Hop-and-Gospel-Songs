(Intro: Chops) 
 You listening to a Chops production 
 And MB's the click, ODB, Dirt McGirt, tell 'em 
 (Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 Yeah, roof is on fire, bitch, put it out 
 Out of control, flames spinnin' out 
 When you get real deep, dig it out 
 When you rollin' up the L, pig it out 
 Pop the cork, respect, pour it out 
 White Horse in the house, roll it out 
 If it's goods on the wood, throw 'em out 
 I'll be there, pop, you can dig it out 
 (Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 Dirt Dog, want the red rug, roll it out 
 You saw the grip, and I ain't ashamed to pull it out 
 My fault, 'cause you said you gonna bring it out 
 And you know it ain't comin', till I'm singin' out 
 Oh, don't stop ma, got my legs shakin' here, don't stop ma 
 You'se a real freak girl, gotta give you props 
 'Cause I feel the bam bam when my bed rock 
 (Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 Rollin' on your stair, bitch, pick her out 
 Out of control, and can't slut her out 
 Big girls, you can get it, no doubt 
 You jumpin' off, with the pretty little mouth 
 Don't expect to trip down south 
 Uh-uh, and relay in my baby mama house 
 Let's fuck, girl, time's running out 
 Mama be home at five, on the dot 
 (Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 Fuckin' up my party, bitch, throw 'em out 
 Out of control, my name, wide 'em out 
 Fill the arenas, the Roc, sell 'em out 
 Get mad shit on the curb, and pout 
 When I left the Billboards, what drought 
 Serious thought, for those who wanna doubt 
 Move with felony niggaz, that just came out 
 And thunders that be spittin' in heavy, like four pounds
