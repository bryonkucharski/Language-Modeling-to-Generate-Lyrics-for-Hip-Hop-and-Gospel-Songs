Featuring Ghostface, RZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard 
 (Rza) 
 Yo Yo Yo doodododododo Yo pssh yo 
 Yo park the jeep on the street of the Sunset Marquis 
 Autograph sign and pass wit a gold tip sharpee 
 Permanent ink blots undrunk from velly poo scotts 
 All you faggots try to judge my shit like Ed Koch 
 Underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared 
 Plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed 
 Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home 
 Flip the track of the beat watch Bobby flip the metronome 
 High voltage, keep my seat in winsbro cultured 
 Kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage 
 I open and fold ya thought he fucked a ogre 
 I leave the cats the book of food stamps ???? 
 The box of evil a fifty sack of that lethal 
 Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu 
 [Odb] 4x 
 What party can you go to 
 And I ain't there you bitches actin' like they don't care 
 (Rza) 
 You bitches actin' like you don't care 
 You bitches actin' like you YO 
 Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks 
 Golden platinum things unstainable 
 I chew rocks 
 Slipe wit type digital soup deflect bullets 
 Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded 
 Land, like my cousin dusty dirty as dan 
 Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan 
 Tapes we dub pound you wit the ace of club 
 Climb your tree to a shub 
 Tongue kiss a lion and kidnap her cub 
 Passin it portrait 
 My bitch spread eagle wild orchid 
 Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick 
 Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin 
 I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra 
 Starks might fuck Mya 
 (Odb) 
 I'm the pussy vampire 
 (Ghostface) 
 Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out 
 One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out 
 Like I owe somethin', check they stance they frontin 
 I'm two seconds fromt wistin y'all shit over nuttin 
 All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid 
 In a minute almost hung yourself slit ya wrists 
 To the maximum hand me the forty I'll thrash and 
 Split out guests wit gash lemon goes throw his laz gone 
 Trama the block pro bar sledge slang ho 
 Runnin' from to and sharles some rap and I might blow 
 World cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley 
 Yvonne lendl ordered lamb racket wit the cam key 
 Sideline maneuver, polish wax MC remover 
 Niggaz wit long nails cuttin' me leavin' bruises 
 Candle lows tied a thousand an y'all froze 
 Came home an dust that doo tryin' to play me close 
 We've been peaked for years now Liz wants to choppin the kid 
 I might do magic make him disappear 
 Rearose that nigga Isotoner Coca-Cola holder snap the granola 
 Sprinkle ginko polish 
 Venom from a cobra lace in the come he brought older 
 Soaked through a strainer here's a doser 
 The King James version is paid just like Samsung 
 Wit effects that'll kill rogers double O seven 
 Hanna Barbera hops the opposite abandoned the deer 
 Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher 
 Or maybe captain entenail, connect and then blow the seal 
 Nice like mister whittendale your girl Chippendale 
 Shallah bridge all up in ya dog dial trench 
 When I snatched that shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back 
 And where's the key to the hatchback pop that 
 Get in throw a bag full of mice and then respect that 
 [Girl] 4X 
 What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there 
 These niggaz actin' like they don't care 
 What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there 
 These hoes actin' like they don't care
