Ooh baby I like it raw 
 Yeah baby I like it rawww 
 Ooh baby I like it raw 
 Yeah baby I like it rawww 
 Verse One: 
 Shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam shimmy ya 
 Gimme the mic so I can take it away 
 Off on a natural charge bom-voyage 
 Yeah from the home of the doge brooklyn scwad 
 Wu-Tang killer bee's on a swarm 
 Rain on your collage ass disco dorm 
 For you to even touch my skill 
 You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill 
 Now chop that downpass it all around 
 Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground 
 For any em-cee in any fifty two states 
 I get psycho, killer, Norman Bates 
 My producer slam my flow is like bamm 
 Jump on stage ah then I dip doown 
 (I like the way you talk) 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 Ooh baby I like it raw 
 Yeah baby I like it rawww 
 Ooh baby I like it raw 
 Yeah baby I like it rawww 
 (Backwards verse incorporating part of Verse Two) 
 Verse Two: (additional extended verse) 
 See, when a nigga say he likes it raw 
 He means dirty, down to the floor 
 See my name is the Ol'DB and I'll beat your ass 
 For the ladies who know me tell them who the fuck I be 
 For the niggas who know me tell them who the fuck I be 
 My style comes down on y'all like rocks 
 By the doc 
 Umm by the flock 
 By the creak by the flock 
 Got east coast locked down padlocked 
 My sulu be all all down by the flock 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 Verse One: repeat 
 Yo y'all know the lyrics come on sing with me 
 Chorus: repeat 2X
