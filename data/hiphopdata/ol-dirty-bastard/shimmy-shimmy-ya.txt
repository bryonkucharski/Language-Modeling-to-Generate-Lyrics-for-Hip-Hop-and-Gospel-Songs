(Oh, fuck, you can't even sing) 
 Ooh, baby, I like it raw... 
 Yeah baby, I like it raw 
 Ooh, baby, I like it raw... 
 Yeah baby, I like it raw 
 Sh... 
 Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay 
 Gimme the mic so I can take it away 
 Off on a natural charge, bon voyage 
 Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad 
 Wu-Tang Killer Bees on a swarm 
 Rain on ya college ass, disco dorm 
 When you didn't even touch my skill 
 You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill. Now 
 Chop that down, pass it all around 
 Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground 
 For any MC in any 52 states 
 I gets psycho killer Norman Bates 
 My producer slam, my flow is like bam 
 Jump on stage, and then I dun-dah 
 (I like the way you come) 
 Ooh, baby, I like it raw... 
 Yeah baby, I like it raw 
 Ooh, baby, I like it raw... 
 Yeah baby, I like it raw 
 The ODB won't neva quit 
 My name is OBD nigga and I'll beat your shit
