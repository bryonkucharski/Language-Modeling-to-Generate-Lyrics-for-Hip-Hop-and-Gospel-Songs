(Feat. Rude One (Ill Rahlos)) 
 (Soft spoken ad lib for 10 secs) 
 (Vin Rock) "To all my people I'm out" 
 "To all my people I'm out" 
 (Intro/Chorus x2: both) 
 Yo who can still rock a park? 
 Get in that ass if you bark 
 It's Prince Poe, hop you weather the storm 
 And don't be afraid, ma let's enjoy the day 
 Yo I can help you throw your troubles away 
 (Rude One) 
 Yo I know Prince for a minute, don't get no realer than this 
 I got love, went through some shit but now the medicine's done 
 Concocted hot shit, straight off the block like rocks did 
 Melody, you corny MCs we make smedley's 
 With no corner degrees, y'all tryin' to pass the gology 
 Check your history then I'm a Southside resident 
 Holdin' quarter bricks yo back when Reagan was President 
 (Prince Poetry) 
 We be the rugged N-Y's, Medicinemen, intelligent 
 My two's spread nights with hustlers under streetlights 
 The beat strike vital hearts as I heat mics 
 Hot lava in the form of words 
 Got you lovin' this natural high as I spit these 'erbs 
 Embrace, lace it with this impeccable taste 
 Got the club rockin', titties mad hard off the bass 
 Ya heard? A nigga gotta always make moves 
 And continue to shine like Armourall on the shoes, what? Huh 
 (Prince Poetry) 
 Yo, I'm on a mish' to get rid of dead weight, ready to bubble 
 Too much shit in this life to juggle, this for real struggle 
 I keep it movin with all three eyes open (Hah) 
 Lyrical content is potent, rather well spoken 
 I'm massin all my niggas to get it 'cause wit it 
 We all movin, without it we all lose, I'm about it 
 But we split it (50-50 nigga), if I bust shots to cover your back 
 I give it up to see where some niggas' heads are at 
 'Cause brothers do get grimy over nickels and dimes 
 And if you was my man you wouldn't be reachin' for mines 
 Damn, catch me on Liberty in the van 
 But one block over, on the corner devisin the plan 
 My niggas Rude and Nice be holdin' me down (for real) since a teen 
 Now we some veterans of this medicine, stackin the green 
 From 7-1-8, to 7-0h-2, to 5-1-Oh 
 Poe'll make ya shake the stress so act like ya know huh, what? 
 (Rude One) 
 Yo half my niggas been, sent to the essence, I make the best of a 
 Tight situation, organizin emancipation 
 To live life, rip mics, get nice without fights (Ugh) 
 Copyright my shit (ugh) and get paid in the spotlight 
 (Prince Poetry) 
 I'm still buckwild like a cock fight, take flight only to win 
 But if I fail all I know is I'm startin over again 
 Forty projects baby boy, still stickin and movin like Roy 
 Prince Poe lyrically bringin' you joy 
 What? What? What? 
 C'mon 
 (Outro: Prince Poe) 
 C'mon, uh-huh-huh-huh 
 '98 or better baby, this is how we do it 
 Ugh, to all my peoples come on 
 It's all good, gotta few words to uplift the spirits, no doubt 
 New York, outer city limits, it's all good baby boy 
 Don't hate girl, lemme holler atcha for a while 
 Uh-hah, ugh ugh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la 
 Yeah, believe me yo, get it twisted, get smacked motherfucker 
 (Laughter) But it's all love y'knowI'msayin? 
 Y'knowI'msayin I be the God, you be the thug 
 Uh-huh-hah-huh-hah-ah, one love y'all 
 It's all love, it's all love, cheers Nice it's all love 
 It's all love Big Riq it's all
