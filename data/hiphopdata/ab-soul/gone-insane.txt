I feel like, I'm affiliated with, the illuminati, bitch 
 All seein' fuckin' eye, this is your enlightenment 
 I'm lightin' this, fire my supplier always like to give 
 Higher than I've ever been these heights are mighty frightening 
 Throw ya hands up as if you wanna strike like lightening 
 Don't shoot, you can't fight a viking on vicodin 
 Can you? Hmm I would like to see you try it then 
 I be eatin' rappers that's the only way I'm bitin' them 
 That was yummy yummy, dummy dummy, nothing's funny funny 
 Give a bitch a sippy sippy, then I get some sucky sucky 
 Sucky sucky now, think the nigga must be lucky lucky 
 She's such a doll, I guess that makes me Chucky 
 Wassup with y'all other than nothing at all? 
 Bitches lickin' my balls, you ain't nuttin' at all! 
 You ain't nuttin' at all 
 Neither am I 
 Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die! 
 I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain 
 I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane 
 Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG) 
 Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O 
 Grab a bitch then grab ya dick 
 Pop a fifth and have a sip 
 Smoke a blunt, pop a pill 
 Fly nigga, fly nigga 
 Party every single night 
 Mingle with a nigga wife 
 Doggone, we all gone 
 Die nigga, die nigga 
 Life's a bitch, but she won't let me hit 
 So I just masturbate to her naked flicks 
 I ain't got change for a dolla, but I think I'm making sense 
 I do resemble my father, but do I really know I'm his? 
 Sometimes I like to go on a tangent of random shit 
 Stay with her Black 'n' Mild out with a handful of acid tips 
 Skywalker in the blunt, Darth Vader in the cup 
 You don't get lifted with us, your elevators stuck 
 I never gave a fuck, my name never came up 
 But now that I done came up, I think I'm King Tut 
 I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government 
 He probably think I'm sniffin' cocaine and some other shit 
 I'm on some other shit, Black Hippie ho! 
 Yippy ka yeee, Yippy ka yoo 
 Tilt ya head you see me in the sky 
 Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die! 
 I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain 
 I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane 
 Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG) 
 Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O 
 Grab a bitch then grab ya dick 
 Pop a fifth and have a sip 
 Smoke a blunt, pop a pill 
 Fly nigga, fly nigga 
 Party every single night 
 Mingle with a nigga wife 
 Doggone, we all gone 
 Die nigga, die nigga 
 Drownin' in Moscato, popular pothead 
 Feel like I hit the lotto, and I just got head 
 From a famous model (who?), Gloria Velez 
 Lusting for Cubana's culo you know what it is 
 I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, experience my fate 
 All I'm missin' is a band of gypsies and some purple haze 
 But now it's OG Kush and aeroinstrumentals 
 No need to insinuate, miss me with the innuendo 
 Ya outlooks lousy someone needs a new window 
 Ima win I just don't know when though you bimbos know what you in for some info to make you exercise your mental 
 A seed small as my pinkie can be your weeping willow 
 I'm so ill I'm held hostage at a hospital 
 Doin' it big like not little 
 Tivo the revolution when it's televised 
 Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die! 
 I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain 
 I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane 
 Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG) 
 Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O 
 Grab a bitch then grab ya dick 
 Pop a fifth and have a sip 
 Smoke a blunt, pop a pill 
 Fly nigga, fly nigga 
 Party every single night 
 Mingle with a nigga wife 
 Doggone, we all gone 
 Die nigga, die nigga
