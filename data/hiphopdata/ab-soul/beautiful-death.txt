(Verse 1: Ab-Soul) 
 My only fear is fear itself 
 I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself 
 Niggas looking at me like I don't hear myself 
 Like I don't know pain -- I been here myself 
 (This life will drive you crazy) 
 Only if you let it 
 I'm just an American expressin' - Just give me credit 
 Won't be surprised if before I rise, I'm beheaded 
 These are the days of our lives 
 Nightmares of a thief comin' takin' my life 
 I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up 
 In this reality, at least I keep my bed made up 
 I just wish they all could see what I can see 
 If we could stop it with the violence and apply a lil' logic I believe 
 We could thrive to be a promise, see -- Civilization 
 We may die individually, but as a nation 
 We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga 
 Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga 
 It's not time, until it's our time 
 (Don't be so afraid to die) 
 Until it's our time 
 (Don't be so afraid to die) 
 It's our time, till it's our time 
 ('Cause we'll never die) 
 (Verse 2: Ab Soul) 
 All I see is confusion and chaos 
 Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities 
 Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me 
 And got me awfully thinkin' about offin' me 
 I wake up in the morning and I ask myself 
 Is life worth living, should I blast myself? 
 I'm tired of being broke and even worse 
 The upper class acts like they want me off this earth 
 (This life will drive you crazy) 
 Only if you allow it 
 That's only if you a coward and you're sure to get devoured 
 To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power 
 Who's gonna take a stand, who's gonna be a man? 
 Who do you work for? Please help me understand 
 You could be the victor in a situation 
 We may die individual, but as a nation 
 We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga 
 Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga 
 It's not time, until it's our time 
 (Verse 3: Punch) 
 Pardon my immortality 
 I'm Martin Luther shooting back on the balcony 
 Escapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry 
 Alpha 184, oh lord, nobody blast for me 
 If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther 
 Nigga show me to the slaughter 
 I gladly sacrifice what is perceived 
 Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams 
 My spittin' image, see my stitching in his genes 
 According to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless 
 My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans 
 Penetratin' America's culture, to its very being 
 It's not political though, it's more critical 
 Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical 
 But I advise y'all to keep me alive 
 In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life 
 Beautiful death, nigga 
 (Bridge: Ab-Soul) 
 Tragedy after tragedy, it's sad to see 
 America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony 
 We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity 
 Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy 
 We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace 
 We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece 
 Put down your piece, I'm wish you all a beautiful death 
 Peace
