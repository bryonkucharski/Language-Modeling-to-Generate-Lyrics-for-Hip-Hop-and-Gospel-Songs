It's Mr Ab Soulutely 
 More drive than the fastest hooptie 
 More alive than a newborn unicorn in the sky 
 And I just get more fly by the second I wreck it 
 That immortality is not a myth or just a lie 
 'Cause every time I speak this thesis is justified 
 Sublime rhyme and reason being why 
 I am I sayonara if you can't keep up for the ride 
 Just for my 
 Just for my 
 Just for my (open up) 
 Real Thinkers (Open Up) 
 Real Thinkers (Open up) 
 And touch the sky 
 Touch the sky 
 Touch the sky 
 Real thinkers (open up) 
 Real thinkers (open up) 
 You thirsty? 
 Open Up Your Mind 
 Niggas don't think 
 Niggas don't think 
 Niggas don't 
 Understand exactly what it takes to be creative 
 And display greatness the dedication it takes 
 The time consumption the stakes if you say it ain't high 
 That's a blind assumption and open your eyes or something 
 Defy the odds 
 Multiply with nothing grip the skies 
 I open minds in hopes that you open your mind 
 Holding my fro and scoping the scene out 
 And spitting sixteens spitting my spleen out 
 Thought I had it made but ain't shit clean 
 And I been chasing this dream since Wayne made Bling Bling 
 I drift off in thought and teleport to Beijing 
 Pushing 25 but still feelin' like 18 
 With more insight than a encyclopedia 
 The Carson Arson warm enough to fight anemia 
 And I'm just warning up 
 Got 'em sweating bullets big enough to load the pump 
 Just for my 
 Just for my 
 Just for my (open up) 
 Real Thinkers (Open Up) 
 Real Thinkers (Open up) 
 Real Thinkers (Open Up) 
 You can touch the sky 
 Touch the sky 
 Touch the sky 
 Real thinkers (open up) 
 Real thinkers (open up) 
 Open Up Your Mind 
 Niggas don't think 
 Niggas don't think 
 Niggas don't 
 Strategize, just fantasize 
 They don't emulate they just antagonize 
 They don't illustrate they just be writing rhymes 
 They don't demonstrate they hide behind their lines 
 And on my rise to success 
 I'm just searching for the perfect concept 
 I swear I'll be the Einstein of my time 
 It's not E but AB equals MC squared 
 Long term mentality
