Stocks rising, fertilizing neighbourhoods with butter, butter 
 Black steel, no mass, no tags--gutta, gutta 
 Look up in the sky, no stars, helicopters hover 
 Grab my strap, kiss my mother, bust back duck for cover 
 Hit the bounty, straight hunter, main line speak ya mind 
 Where you from? Take ya time, bust a nigga no response 
 Rest a hater, respirator, no response 
 Green light, go time 
 Where yo block? I know mine 
 So you know, one time, snitch nigga, bitch nigga 
 Re-up with a seven 'cause that's all I can get, nigga 
 Small time hustler, me I'm just a governor 
 Of my city fuck with me juggle shots through ya jugular 
 Projects hold me down, A1 customers 
 A1 army guns, A1 predators 
 Pigs yellin' man down, got the law scared of us 
 Nigga we ain't scared of nothing, break it down, show me something 
 I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne 
 Burn ya whole block down like propane 
 Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change 
 If you ain't know, now you know mayne! 
 Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow 
 Finna take another trip to the liquor store 
 The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked 'cause 
 These streets ain't no motherfucking joke 
 Back on my bullshit, back on the blocks riffin' 
 Get it off re-up flippin', gettin' off his car flippin' 
 Model bitch think I'm trickin' 
 Oh no, no go 
 W-oh no 
 30 bucks, mo' mo' 
 What the fuck you thought this was? 
 All I know is doin' me 
 Flyin' spur doin' 3 
 Gutter lane, blowin' tree 
 Homie what you smokin' on? 
 I can get it dirt cheap, I can get it for the low 
 Hard rock or pure blow 
 I can show you how to whip it 
 Birdies given off a show 
 Servin' quail in the kitchen 
 Remedy for meal tickets 
 Dope game, real wicked 
 Some deals go sour 
 Real niggas locked up 
 Snitched on by known cowards 
 OG told me that's life 
 Murders keep me stressed at night 
 My daughter keep me level-headed, reason why I sacrifice 
 Story of a real nigga 
 This is how I feel, nigga 
 Come between my piece of mind, get yo ass killed nigga! 
 I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne 
 Burn ya whole block down like propane 
 Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change 
 If you ain't know, now you know mayne! 
 Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow 
 Finna take another trip to the liquor store 
 The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked 'cause 
 These streets ain't no motherfucking joke 
 My momma told me tread softly, gotta keep them feds off me 
 Gotta keep the guards on me, I know them mothafuckas want me 
 Know I gotta hold it down 
 Know I gotta run my town 
 Know tomorrows never promised 
 Know I gotta get it now 
 Know I got a job to finish 
 Know I need stock to grow 
 Know I need Lord's forgiveness 
 Know I've been through obstacles 
 Know I gotta shit on niggas 
 Know I gotta do my thang 
 Knowin' that I'm knee deep 
 Know the drama that it brings 
 Know I can't trust these hoes 
 Know I can't chase these bitches 
 Know I gotta chase this bread 
 Know I gotta push these Benzes 
 Know I gotta push these trucks 
 Know I gotta paint these pictures 
 Know I gotta give it up 
 Know you better mind your business 
 Know I gotta stay silent 
 Know I can't fall for nothing 
 Know I know hard times 
 Know I gotta stay humble 
 Know I gotta keep it gangsta 
 Know you gotta come and get me 
 Know I gotta keep it pushin' 
 Know you can't fuck with me 
 I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne 
 Burn ya whole block down like propane 
 Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change 
 If you ain't know, now you know mayne! 
 Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow 
 Finna take another trip to the liquor store 
 The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked 'cause 
 These streets ain't no motherfucking joke
