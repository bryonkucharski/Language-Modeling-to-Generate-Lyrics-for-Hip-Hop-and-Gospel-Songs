 (Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid (and Ab-Soul)) 
 Your body's calling 
 Your body's calling 
 (Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that) 
 Your body's calling 
 Your body's calling 
 (Me) Your body's calling 
 Your body's calling 
 (Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that) 
 Your body's calling 
 Your body's calling me 
 (Verse 1: Ab-Soul) 
 All right, I know what you like, I know what you want 
 I know what you need, I know how to put you out your misery 
 A-B (dash) S-o-u-l 
 Infinity when it comes to the possibilities 
 Anytime you're in my vicinity 
 And I'll beat it, yeah I'll beat it up, yeah I'll beat it up 
 Just like it's my enemy, all night 
 I can't resist, I need it like my pancreas 
 If you dismiss and no give me kiss kiss, it'll be hard digesting it 
 Gimme some of that, gimme some of that 
 That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff 
 Back it up till a nigga say that's enough 
 Mirror on the ceiling, everything looking up 
 Sweetie, I'm trying to get it in like a suite key 
 Your skin like sweet tea, I need thee 
 Look sweet thing, you remind me of my jeep, your body's calling 
 She got work but I think she finna call in, 'cause I'm all in that thang 
 And she probably think I'm in love the way I'm falling in that thang 
 Soulo 
 (Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid) 
 This strange thing got me leaning 
 This reefer keep on steaming 
 And I believe that everything happens for a reason 
 And girl you got me fiending 
 I don't care about your religion 
 'Cause I just can't resist you 
 God damn lust demons 
 (Verse 2: Jay Rock) 
 Rock, Rock 
 Leaning like a motherfucker, I be pouring 
 (Black Hippy Shit) higher than a motherfucker, I be blowing 
 I'm off that Amber Kush with a bad little bitch call it Amber Rose 
 She be loving the crew and I be loving her too 
 She got a thang for them rap niggas I suppose 
 She feeling my energy 
 I feel on her thighs, she fill up the Henessey 
 Now we on the sofa, in a minute I'm a be bending her over 
 She know my motives, tryna get behind me like a locomotive 
 She trained, she on the right track 
 Yeah she got that boomerang then I'm coming right back 
 She ratchet nasty 
 She got a ring on her tongue and a ring on her clit 
 Got my hands on my YKK, sip it down, now she all on my tip 
 She told me, look at me when I work my magic daddy 
 She pulled a rabbit out a hat 
 Made my dick disappear, in thin air 
 Then she brought it right back
