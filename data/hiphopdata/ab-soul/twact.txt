Jinx what up my nigga? 
 Soulo 
 I get turnt, I get rowdy 
 Backwood full of some of the loudy! 
 I'm fucked up! I get wasted 
 That's a hundred dollar cup I just wasted! 
 I'm Twact! 
 (I get high, she get low) 
 Motherfucker I'm Twact! 
 (I get high, she get low) 
 Motherfucker! 
 Uh, Twact out till I pass out 
 If you ain't fucking with the team then you assed out 
 Flow dope like a crack house, bitches pill poppin' 
 House poppin' like a Frat House 
 Keep 16s like a verse nigga 
 Codeine got me leaning in reverse nigga 
 I popped a Xanny then she dropped her panties 
 I get the dough and bring it home, to the family 
 See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me 
 I'm from the village baby, I'm just tryna win a Grammy 
 Uh, smoking Backwoods back-to-back 
 Double cross the squad and get popped like Cracker Jacks 
 You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped 
 A real Compton resident, yeah you know I'm that 
 I pulled up to the function with the pack 
 Turnt in this bitch to the max! 
 My nigga I'm twact (I get high) 
 Turkey bag full of that gas 
 Nigga I'm twact (she get low) 
 Styrofoam cups, no glass 
 Nigga I'm twact (get high) 
 Got them bars on me, no rap 
 Nigga I'm twact (she get low) 
 I don't even know where I'm at 
 Nigga I'm Twact! 
 I just got home boy I'm glad I made it 
 The Codeine got me activated 
 New mix alert, Soul you have to taste it 
 Know I got the lean on me, like tax evasion 
 I mixed it with a whole lot of cannabis, mind travelling, 
 Getting throwed like a javelin 
 H Town slang I done poed up a mad sure 
 The judge got me like roll I'm a Twact bra 
 And now on a mission just to get some cheeks 
 If she don't answer when I call, Imma hit delete 
 I don't love these hoes at all, boy I be with freaks 
 'Cause they know if I fall it's gone be asleep 
 And I'm back on the road sipping mud again 
 Tryna stay inside the lines like I'm coloring 
 The cops say I seen you swerving tell me why? 
 I told 'em I ain't even gon' lie 
 My nigga I'm twact (I get high) 
 Turkey bag full of that gas 
 Nigga I'm twact (She get low) 
 Styrofoam cups, no glass 
 Nigga I'm twact (Get high) 
 Got them bars on me, no rap 
 Nigga I'm twact (She get low) 
 I don't even know where I'm at 
 Nigga I'm Twact! 
 Soulo ho, well known from Del-Amo to Soho ho 
 This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe 
 I might even set up my camera too 
 Oh, do the splits on the dick like aerobics 
 Them other niggas talking shit but they don't know shit 
 No, they ain't on and ain't on shit 
 Yeah they on that, I'm on this 
 I don't need no necklace 'cause I be off the chain 
 And all they say is yes when everybody know your name 
 Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes 
 Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining 
 Seals in the cut like Navy training, 
 Along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming 
 Eh, Long Hair Don't Care, how come I'm the most favorite in here? 
 My nigga I'm twact (I get high) 
 Turkey bag full of that gas 
 Nigga I'm twact (She get low) 
 Styrofoam cups, no glass 
 Nigga I'm twact (Get high) 
 Got them bars on me, no rap 
 Nigga I'm twact (She get low) 
 I don't even know where I'm at 
 Nigga I'm Twact!
