(Featuring: Jhene Aiko) 
 This is a story about control, my control 
 Control of what I say, control of what I do 
 And this time I'm gonna do it my way 
 I hope you enjoy as much as I do 
 Are we ready? I am, because it's all about control 
 And I've got lots of it 
 (Verse 1: Ab-Soul) 
 Soulo ho, the one and only 
 You niggas know me, your bitches want me 
 Determination, I got a grip, 9-5 locs I am not a Crip 
 Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers 
 Your short term tall tales won't sell here 
 And Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here 
 Let me get a 'hell yeah' 
 Open your eyes 
 You niggas know what it is 
 It's about that time 
 Soulo ho? 
 You niggas know what it is 
 It's been a hell of a ride 
 You niggas know what it is 
 We live one hell of a life 
 So Soulo ho? 
 Manipulating minds, reciprocating times 
 Split on my 
 Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon 
 We can see you half-stepping, I should somersault 
 Some are salty that I made it in the way I did 
 'Cause I really did everything I say I did 
 Let me tell you why I'm vexed 
 The same reason why I'm stressed, the same reason why I'm blessed 
 I stopped playing, and I started planning 
 I stopped playing, and I made it happen 
 We mapped it out, and now the map is ours 
 Raised my stats off of records, check an almanac 
 Thank God punchline knew I had a knack 
 Down two die to get my point across like craps 
 Control System, cut off your radios, cut off your television
