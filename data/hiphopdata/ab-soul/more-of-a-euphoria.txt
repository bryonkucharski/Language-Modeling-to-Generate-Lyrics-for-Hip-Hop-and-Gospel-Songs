You know it feel like that though 
 Yes you were designed to fail 
 No you will never attain, everything 
 Look at your primitive brain 
 Look at your ignorant ways 
 Look at your innocent eyes 
 When the mirror look your way, look away 
 Don't take responsibility for your actions anyway 
 In anyway, shape form of fashion 
 Don't be rational for goodness sake, a-dapt 
 There's no need to stand up, act like you got bad back 
 Spasms that you can't take 
 You are not invincible, imbecile you can break 
 I pity you, pitiful and I hope you go to hell 
 Even if the pit is full 
 Let's make that a mandate 
 I hope you hate what I did to you, did I get to you? 
 Everybody, wants to, be victorious 
 We can make this (world) more of a euphoria 
 Yes you were designed to fail 
 No you will never attain, everything 
 Look at your primitive brain 
 Look at your ignorant ways 
 Look at your innocent eyes 
 When the mirror look your way, look away 
 Think of all the bad decisions you made 
 In the past even to this day 
 Drive yourself mad, run out of gas on the information interstate 
 That might be a bit much if it is in my intents to offend ya 
 And leave dents in your confidence 
 Blow your fuse, sabotage your views 
 So you can keep a funky attitude, like the parliament 
 And everyday I do, that's why you never grew 
 No you weren't designed to fail 
 Yes you where meant to attain, everything 
 What a magnificent brain 
 Such benevolent ways, look at your innocent eyes 
 When the mirror look your way, look her straight 
 In the face, come to grips with who you are and 
 Who you ain't 
 Where you going, where you been 
 Help your family, help your friends 
 Plant a seed, teach, he or she to be the, deity 
 The media will never perceive us 
 As, get your five dolla' ass up 
 Make change, make a way for today 
 Tomorrow was yesterday 
 Find a fine line between time and space 
 Contact the cosmos and you'll hear 'em say 
 The vail is being raised 
 For many, we are living in the last days 
 For us, it's only the beginning 
 One love, one conscious, one kinetic mind 
 Hiii Power!
