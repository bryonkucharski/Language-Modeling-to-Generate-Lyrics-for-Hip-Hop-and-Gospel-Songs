I had a dub sack in my bucket 
 Rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling around like "fuck it" 
 OZ in this Benzo, rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Rolling around like "fuck it", rolling around like "fuck it" 
 That shit weak, your bitch weak that's too bad, my bitch bad 
 Smoke weed, I got plenty, take your quarter back like McNabb 
 Sip lean, I got plenty, I drop a ace in a liter now I got a quinceañera 
 Ever had a chick to do it on the dick to capoeira 
 Kick game like Martial Arts kick game like Marshall Law 
 On Tekken the homies got weapons Martial Law could happen any second 
 Getting money, blowing digits only sexing sexy women 
 Only sexin' sexy women only sex is sexy women 
 That like to do them nasty things you know I like them nasty things 
 Can't fuck with them whips and chains I got a bitch that do, but I ain't got no gavel 
 Baby wanna know what's under my belt maybe 'cause I paid so much for the belt 
 Call the car service, get your ass home, but just yesterday me and Agent J 
 I had a dub sack in my bucket 
 Rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling around like "fuck it" 
 OZ in this Benzo, rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Rolling around like "fuck it", rolling around like "fuck it" 
 What's happenin'? 
 OZ in this Benz tho 
 OZ in this Benz tho 
 Just a lil' Carson, nigga 
 You're so weak, you don't know me 
 Soulo so lowkey in Lord, legends, infinity 
 Oh God showed off inventing me 
 Me and K with the promoter 
 Drop the fo' up in the soder 
 I'm unraveling backwoods 
 And he's bending corners, just thought I'd warn ya 
 What's happening? 
 I've been gone too long, but bitch I'm back again 
 Except this time I'm old 
 Had that Chevy celebrity the same age as me 
 With that gram in the glove-box, that's a 2 for 15 
 I mean 
 I had a dub sack in my bucket 
 Rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling around like "fuck it" 
 OZ in this Benzo, rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Rolling around like "fuck it", rolling around like "fuck it" 
 What's happenin'? 
 OZ in this Benz tho 
 OZ in this Benz tho 
 You still weak, you last week 
 I'm next month, twist the next blunt 
 The homie got his chain took at the Mixed Nuts 
 Now we blowing big weed, lean mixed up 
 Nigga, don't get shit misconstrued 
 We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff 
 Getting women in the mood 
 We tell the truth up in the nude 
 Breaking news, breaking news 
 I'm enlightening like Pikachu 
 All I do is what you wouldn't think to do 
 Silk, don't you remember that fresh room boo 
 South Pole Jeans, fat laces in all our shoes 
 A nigga turned into an oracle 
 Treat the damn booth like a urinal 
 Smoking a stogie in a terminal 
 I had a dub sack in my bucket 
 Rolling around like "fuck it" 
 Paul Jeremy, Doe and me trying to match a nugget 
 Pass the blunt to BC, AR, and AJ 
 King Rich, YM, Python P, I put that on me 
 I had a dub sack in my bucket 
 Capital C 
 I just might be in yo hood 
 (Fuck outta here man, you dumb ass niggas! 
 You niggas are silly out here tryin' to look cute and shit man) 
 I just might be in yo hood 
 I just might be in yo hood 
 I just might be in yo hood 
 Niggas chased my uncle there, through God's grace the gun jammed 
 I found comfort in this pleasure, meaning I slept the best through gun sounds 
 These Days it's a little different, between me and my past I put a little distance 
 Egyptian cotton, thread count vicious 
 Started as a dream, manifested into little Kendrick 
 Now everybody feel it, even niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it! 
 Selective Amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days 
 Niggas ask about pressure I grew up watching free base 
 Literally the face of my hood 
 So basically I beat the case 
 I vanished but left a trace, just in-case a nigga gotta go back 
 Yeah, it's not for games if I say that 
 I just might be in yo hood
