Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine 
 Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine 
 Gimme mine, Gimme mine 
 Uh, gimme mine, uh, gimme mine 
 Gimme mine, bitch gimme mine 
 Gimme mine, nigga gimme mine 
 Gimme mine, gimme mine 
 But I... 
 Wish I could put the B.S. behind me 
 And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing 
 And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited 
 Every time I'm arriving everybody excited 
 Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining 
 Let me get it back from the top Ali 
 Life 
 I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave 
 Where the hip hop radio don't play, what more can I say 
 I need to get away from the lights... 
 Flashing in my face like a topless model 
 And the topless bottles keep popping like a Glock 
 And it's coming non-stop, take a shot - don't worry about the price 
 Everything is paid for, you fully accommodated 
 When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated 
 Making American Pie, get you a slice 
 It's the American Dream, right? 
 So it seems I need to air out my self-esteem 
 It's so high 
 But I... 
 Wish I could put the B.S. behind me 
 And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing 
 And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited 
 Every time I'm arriving everybody excited 
 Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining 
 Can't tell who real or who lying 
 (I may just) need to 
 (Go on a hiatus) Yeah 
 Almost lost my life to the industry 
 Better yet I did, I should bury me 
 And I ain't even sell one record yet 
 And she can see I'm hanging on barely 
 And my bitch say I'm arrogant 
 'Cause when she with me I feel she should cherish it 
 Only cause you never know when I'mma perish 
 Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it 
 Stick to the script I will - Ferris 
 Nobody ever said it'll be fair so 
 When the tabloids read "Death To Ab-Soul" 
 I couldn't get up, said I'll keep it on the down low 
 You never know what's next, or know what to expect 
 Still wanted for ?, but now I'm a prospect 
 From dusk until dawn, I feel like a object 
 Under a telescope 
 But I... 
 Wish I could put the B.S. behind me 
 And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing 
 And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited 
 Every time I'm arriving everybody excited 
 Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining 
 Can't tell who real or who lying 
 (I may just) need to 
 (Go on a hiatus) Yeah 
 I loosen my tie 
 So I can drown in my drink 
 I loosen my tie 
 And give myself some space to breathe 
 I see the skyline 
 And the clouds are so at peace 
 I need some my time (my time my time) 
 (Intro plays until end of song) 
 I need a Mai Tai 
 So I can drown in my drink 
 I loosen my tie 
 And give myself some space to breathe 
 I see the skyline 
 And the clouds are so at peace 
 I need some my time (my time my time)
