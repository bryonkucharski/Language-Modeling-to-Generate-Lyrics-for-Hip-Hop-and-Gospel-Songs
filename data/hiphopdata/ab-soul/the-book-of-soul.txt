Your momma told me read the Book of Job 
 They shoulda called it the Book of Soul 
 I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health 
 Caught Stevens-Johnson syndrome when I was ten years old 
 Internal and external fever, 80% 
 Fatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit 
 Severe pink eye, my eyes swollen shut 
 For like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck 
 And I even lost my lip skin 
 Grew back darker than its original pigment 
 Skin disfigured from boils and blisters 
 Unidentifiable by my little sister 
 Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check 
 The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'm alright 
 My first years of Junior High School were not alright 
 Them dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod 
 I mean not even you. we eventually got cool 
 But I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school 
 Or the world to me, not saying that 'cause I'm your dude 
 I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed too 
 Ironic we always had the same classes 
 I copied off your work, and you ain't always had 
 The right answers but it worked, mama, thanks a lot 
 Probably wouldn't have graduated had you not 
 Somewhere down the line, we became an item 
 The love was in the air like this flight I'm lightin' 
 The first few years was so excitin' 
 Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back 
 My money got funny, you wanted to go on dates 
 I had a Sounwave beat tape tryna beat Drake 
 Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it 
 For me and you, you sing too so you knew the business 
 I know it was hard but you stayed down 
 My fam had doubts, you told me you was proud 
 I did some things, you did some things, always came back together 
 We knew the only way to make it work was work together 
 Seven whole years, seven whole years 
 It was supposed to end with our grandkids 
 Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short 
 But I'm such a nice guy, why Lord? 
 Why Lori? Why'd you have to take her from me? 
 Guess you needed your angel face for all of heaven to see 
 Your picture still on my mirror and it's so scary 
 I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary 
 So now I'm so doped up I think I'm flying 
 I hope the spliff will never finish 
 I guess the Mayans wasn't lying 
 2012 my world ended 
 You used to say that I could see the future 
 You was wrong, 'cause you was in it 
 And I was just with you the day before 
 You said you loved me, I said I loved you more 
 And as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu 
 And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you 
 I gotta stay 'cause I remember that day I looked you in the face and told you nothing can stop me 
 Not even you 
 Stick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot 
 If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost 
 Even if you forget me and everything you left behind 
 I never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time 
 I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud 
 We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about 
 I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme 
 Signed 
 Sincerely yours 
 I live to let you 
 Shine 
 Everything I love the most get taken away 
 My momma and music is next 
 And if that happens before I turn 28 
 Then I'm going out with Kurt Cobain 
 I still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke 
 Unless we talkin' symbolically, then I might agree 
 But if you really wanna look at it that way 
 Then, hey man, God don't like me 
 I refuse to believe that 
 But what's acceptable is anything's possible but nobody special 
 My ma took my TV, Clem took my radio 
 Now I'm on TV and on the radio 
 Don't be dethroned by these systems of control 
 Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul 
 Don't be dethroned by these systems of control 
 Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul 
 (Soul!)
