I am Alice 
 I'm in Wonderland 
 Where's the rabbit? 
 He is late again 
 Goodness 
 Gracious 
 I can't wait for him 
 Who has got the time? 
 Round and round and 
 Round and round we go 
 It's just like the 
 Same scenario 
 Good for nothing 
 Feels like somethin' ain't right 
 I might 
 I might've got way too high 
 I might've got way too high 
 I am trippin' 
 I keep slippin' 
 I cannot recognize 
 What's the difference 
 In pretending and 
 Living a real lie? 
 Everything is spinnin now 
 Have you seen the ground 
 I might've got way too high 
 I might've got way too high 
 Break it down, roll it up 
 Mountains and valleys 
 Seashells from Sally 
 Ego removed but still in tune exactly 
 Pride to the side 
 Third eye winking at me 
 My what a ride 
 Real trippy shit 
 I glimpse with a squint 
 But I can see a whole grip 
 My retinas red 
 My vision is crystal 
 Didn't use pencil 
 But it's true I led 
 My way to this sedated state of mind I always dread 
 My daddy did it 
 This is the state of mind I always had 
 I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man 
 I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams 
 So I take a deep breath 
 Puff, puff, pass 
 Part of my paranoia 
 I'm just a product of my past 
 I show you how to let your soul sail 
 Sparking lala 
 Talking to Allah 
 Might of got way too high 
 I might 
 I might've got way too high
