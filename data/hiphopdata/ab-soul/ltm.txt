I brought you something close to me 
 And left with something new 
 See through your head 
 You haunt my dreams 
 Nothing to do but believe 
 Just believe 
 And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different 
 Long Term Mentality, still remember them cheap wood benches 
 How could I ever forget, I never could get 
 How niggas couldn't get up and get all they could get 
 Man I done seen a thing or two of things that she or he will do 
 To fit in with each other nitpicking at each other 
 Killing each other, bringing each other down 
 Crustations in a bucket, fuck it 
 Roll your windows down in your bucket, play this loud 
 Soul brother number fucking two 
 My time on these 1's and 2's 
 I'm on this track like running shoes 
 I dedicate this one to Cletus Anderson for working harder than the average man 
 Or bend over backwards for his family 
 Doing whatever is you ask for him 
 Shit, I know he fucking tired 
 He should be somewhere retired 
 Still trying, bills still due 
 And between me and you until we get a mill 
 Life smells like mildew 
 Long term (This is long term!) 
 Long term (I'll help you suckas, 'cause I take it long term) 
 Long term (I came, I saw, and conquered) 
 Mentality, mentality, long term (And it's an honor) 
 Long term (To share this with you, wait no longer) 
 Long term (Mother fucker this is long term) 
 Mentality, mentality, long term
