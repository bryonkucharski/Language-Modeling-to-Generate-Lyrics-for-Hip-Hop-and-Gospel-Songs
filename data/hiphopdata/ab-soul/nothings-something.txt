Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good? 
 Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would 
 I wish a nigga would try to take my shit 
 Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this 
 I can't even take a piss without a nigga trying to take a pic 
 I just want to fuck a few hoes, take my pick 
 Backwoods with the hash in 'em bad bitch, skinny jeans, fat ass in 'em 
 You ain't never seen a lime of light 
 I might fuck around and do a line tonight 
 Codine cups, paint a picture so vivid 
 Fucking to the Weeknd, on the weekend 
 That ain't too provocative, is it? 
 If it's not, that's just a warning 
 You know I got it if you want 
 No, I couldn't tell you how the world function 
 But I'm headed to the function 
 This shit ain't about nothing 
 No this shit ain't about nothing 
 But it's gotta be something 
 They say I'm so selfish 
 I ain't think about nothing 
 Unless it's making me something 
 Matter fact fuck that 
 I ain't worried about nothing 
 No, I ain't worried about nothing 
 It's always something 
 The cars, the clothes, the ice 
 It's always something 
 The stars, the moon, the lights 
 It's always something 
 The cars, the clothes, the ice 
 It's always something 
 The stars, the moon, the lights 
 Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good? 
 Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would 
 I wish a nigga would try to take my shit 
 Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this 
 We in the world of material vixens in your videos 
 Hermes belt, shirt will make your ho melt 
 Issey Miyake all over my body 
 My heart beats off beat, still the life of the party 
 YSL, iPhone wireless cell 
 I'm high as hell, by the end of the night 
 I might need bail if a nigga test my mic 
 I ain't a bitch for nothing, end of discussion 
 And I couldn't tell you how the world function 
 But I'm headed to the function 
 This shit ain't about nothing 
 No that shit ain't about nothing 
 But it's gotta be something 
 They say I'm so selfish 
 I ain't think about nothing 
 Unless it's making me something 
 Matter fact fuck that 
 I ain't worried about nothing 
 No, I ain't worried about nothing 
 It's always something
