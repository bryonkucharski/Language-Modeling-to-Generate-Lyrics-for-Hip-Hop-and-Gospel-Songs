Hey Ali? Yeah that's right 
 I can hear myself good now 
 This is how it is These Days 
 You even lose when you win These Days 
 These Days, God's Reign 
 Scared to live, scared to move These Days 
 Your soul sits on your third eye, Soul sits on the throne 
 Told you I was the third wheel, that's three wheel motion on chrome 
 Three's up, three's up, all around the world 
 We ain't shooting no jumpshots, but we balling, we balling 
 I'm from where they get jumped or shot till they falling, they falling 
 They ain't heard one word from God but he calling, he calling 
 I ain't never had a whole rack, till I was 24 years old 
 At 25 I spent a hunnid' of those and still ain't got, nothing to show 
 Uh, I guess that's how it is These Days 
 Uh, I guess that's how it goes 
 Cause this world is dark and my Locs is on but I ain't afraid 
 ABC everythang, every M you end up with is Owed 
 And that's simple math, I had to balance the good and bad 
 No masters but a mastermind, Master Kush up in my bag 
 Soulo in the backseat, in a thing with some tints on it 
 With a thing with some tits on her, and every nigga in this bitch own her 
 Soul! 
 This is how it is These Days 
 You even lose when you win These Days 
 These Days, God's Reign 
 Scared to live, scared to move These Days 
 These Days, in chains 
 You even lose when you win These Days 
 These Days, God's Reign 
 Scared to live, scared to live these days 
 Fuck 
 My girl died and I lost my mind, I'm on everything except Heroin 
 Blame God, don't blame her, all I did was take gangsters to church 
 Got your lady with literature under her Louis bag 
 Got your kid studying outside of class 
 Every project that I dropped she bought em, so now she read more than she Red Bottom 
 Ab-Soul, Abstract, Asshole I'm with the shit 
 I say 'cause around Bloods and I say Blood around Crips, I'm twisted 
 Got Mary, got Lucy, got Molly, that's wifey, girlfriend and mistress 
 Ain't no going against me man make another plan, pop a Xan

 This is how it is These Days 
 You even lose when you win These Days 
 These Days, God's Reign 
 Scared to live, scared to move These Days 
 These Days, in chains 
 You even lose when you win These Days 
 These Days, God's Reign 
 Scared to live, scared to live these days
