Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be almost a star 
 Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be almost a star 
 Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be 
 If you ain't got a dollar to your name 
 Can you maintain? 
 Are you lost, are all your thoughts 
 On the same train? 
 I been ridin' it, doubt 
 Despite the amount 
 I've yet to acquire 
 In my checking account 
 They checkin' me out 
 They peepin my game 
 I paid my dues 
 I even kept my receipt and my change 
 My life is like a movie 
 If Siskel hate it then sue me 
 Fuck a Maybach, I'm straight in the back of this hooptie 
 It started out a hobby, became my life 
 Left my emotions, lonesome, hence the pain I write 
 Some call it therapy 
 Some call it rap music 
 I call it hip-hop 
 No, no 
 No trap music 
 You never seen me heat the pot 
 To whip the rock 
 You never seen me creepin' down your block 
 With the Glock 
 You never seen no diamonds in my chain 
 Or in my watch 
 You never seen me in a G5 
 Or on a yacht 
 But picture that 
 Picture this 
 Picture being poor 
 Picture being rich 
 Picture having more 
 Picture not having shit 
 Picture that 
 What a sight to see 
 Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we 
 Together at the top 
 Where we should be 
 Speaking of being at the top (Champagne, bottoms up) 
 I take that back, cause matter of fact 
 This E and J 
 Dollar shot 
 Is hittin the spot 
 Like a rave 
 My real niggas give me props 
 'Cause I ain't afraid to say 
 What I am and what I am not 
 You had her not 
 I had like seven dollars knowin' I'mma drop five 
 On that session 
 As soon as A-chizzle hit the block 
 Chocolate swisher burn slow 
 Though I hope it never stop 
 So I can get high 
 And accomplish my endeavors 
 Niggas pullin up in benzes, tellin' me that I'm the one 
 I'm guessin when my clock climaxes then my time'll come 
 I never shot a gun 
 But I be killin' all y'all raps 
 Cause all y'all wack 
 I be joggin on all y'all tracks 
 I mean so many lines that 
 I could call you all back, yeah 
 I could send you all a fax, with all facts 
 Budget tighter than my bitch's all black bra strap 
 Grab a digital camera 
 And 
 Picture that 
 Picture this 
 Picture being poor 
 Picture being rich 
 Picture having more 
 Picture not having shit 
 Picture that 
 What a sight to see 
 Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we 
 Together at the top 
 Where we should be 
 Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be almost a star 
 Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be almost a star 
 Shoot for the moon 
 Even if you miss 
 You'll be 
 In the presence of my gifted ass 
 Incredible gift of gab 
 Don't have a cent to spare 
 But pull up a chair, I'll take you back 
 To where my Christmases was full of gifts 
 I surely had 
 Left Santa milk and cookies 
 (We miss you Bernie Mac) 
 Left him a letter 
 And what do you know, he even wrote my back 
 I don't remember what it said 
 But the point is that 
 Soon as I had to take the role for my own acts 
 It seemed as though, all my presents started gradually turnin' into coal 
 I graduated with a car 
 Four years later that motherfucker's stuck in park 
 I missed the days we cut through the alley to the limo park 
 Or further than that 
 Nick at Night, Are you Afraid of the Dark? 
 I keep these memories on my mind 
 'Cause they define me like Dictionary.com 
 Bliss kisses ignorance 
 Pay them unless 
 Your intelligent 
 And her pussy be wet as shit 
 You would come in a flash 
 Please hold the flash 
 But picture that 
 Picture this 
 Picture being poor 
 Picture being rich 
 Picture having more 
 Picture not having shit 
 Picture that 
 What a sight to see 
 Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we 
 Together at the top 
 Where we should be 
 Photogenic I are 
 No need to be camera shy 
 Hand on the bible, I ain't tellin' a lie 
 We only got one, so I'm livin' my life 
 Photogenic I are 
 No need to be camera shy 
 Remember where I been, where I'm going 
 And I only got one, so I'm livin' my life
