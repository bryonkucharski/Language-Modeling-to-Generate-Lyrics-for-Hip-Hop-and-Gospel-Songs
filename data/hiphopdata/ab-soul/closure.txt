I called you back I'm glad you didn't answer baby 
 'Cause every-time we talk I always feel the static baby 
 Could be the distance, yeah 
 You spoke the truth into existence to degrade yourself 
 Told me keep it G as if you told yourself 
 Knew that I was on the move 
 I got to prove my theories to be true 
 I know it's getting hard to think about me 
 I know it's hard to see me on the TV 
 I know you wish you never met me 
 I liked you better when you didn't like me 
 Things just ain't the same no more 
 Things just ain't the same no more 
 Still think about you everyday 
 And I wish I could stay 
 But things just ain't the same no more 
 I don't regret a second that we shared, hell no 
 In fact I often wish that you was here, right now, ow, ow 
 Cause' when Lori left me you was right there 
 Lord knows you had the right care 
 I wonder if you still praying to the East 
 I wonder if you ever forgave me 
 I know it's getting hard to think about me 
 I know it's hard to see me on the TV 
 I know you wish you never met me 
 I liked you better when you didn't like me 
 Things just ain't the same no more 
 Things just ain't the same no more 
 Still think about you everyday 
 And I wish I could stay 
 But things just ain't the same no more 
 I know I said it'll be just one time 
 But it felt so good that I came back twice 
 And I take full blame 
 But in this world of selfish men 
 You keep your heart inside your chest 
 And not in someone else's hand
