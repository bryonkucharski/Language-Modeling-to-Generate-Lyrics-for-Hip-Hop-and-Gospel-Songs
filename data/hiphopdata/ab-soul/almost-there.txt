I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares 
 About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair? 
 It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet 
 And boil it in the pot make it hard to eat 
 I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps 
 Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace 
 Make my pay, take my lady on a date 
 Send my parents on a cruise - living 
 Somewhere with a killer view 
 Oh the irony I spew 
 But for now the studio couches gonna have to do 
 I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself 
 Foolish pride 
 That's what you need to survive 
 It's do or die 
 So step aside I don't mean no trouble 
 Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to 
 Oh, and just so you know 
 When I'm on the road I'm at the travel lodge not the W 
 Almost there, almost there, almost there 
 The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there 
 Almost there, almost there 
 Almost there, almost there, almost there 
 Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine 
 Almost 
 Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually? 
 So I had to break it down: 
 Don't get caught up in the now 
 Focus on the years abroad 
 Cause today you're here but tomorrow you could be gone 
 Singing the same old song 
 And who's the place to blame on? 
 Other than you 
 Whatever it is you do 
 From slanging eight balls to graduating from school 
 Just gotta see it all before it happens 
 I ain't saying see a psychic I'm just saying have a 
 Idea of what you're accomplishing 
 You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it 
 You know a little strategy, premeditation 
 Wins races nine times out of ten 
 As if losing's ever an option 
 Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was poppin' 
 (Not quite) 
 Just know your future's right around the corner 
 Opportunity galore for ya 
 More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be 
 In any event, eventually 
 Treat your first like your last time 
 Cause it might be your last time 
 That's what I learned last time 
 Look forward to looking forward in my pastime 
 You just letting time pass like "that's fine", as wine 
 Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace 
 They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed 
 Gazunteight, or bless me if you like 
 As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight 
 I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on 
 Talk my shit, drop my load on 
 Hold on, I don't think you know how close I am 
 By the time this song's done I'm already there
