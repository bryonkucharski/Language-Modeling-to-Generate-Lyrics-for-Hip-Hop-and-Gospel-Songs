I put my life on the line 
 I roll them dice and I'm fine 
 'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it 
 They ain't giving it, I'm taking it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit 
 If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice 
 Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive 
 Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building 
 Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions 
 Headed in sweatin', open that front door 
 Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes 
 Not a metaphor, then I start towards 
 That front, that's right, where you check in 
 Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor 
 All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot? 
 Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull 
 Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!) 
 Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward 
 I say third floor I'm late, paintin' Jimmy Iovine's office 
 Holding my breath 'bout to faint 
 I'm scared to death that he stops me 
 Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby 
 And see I'm breaking down if I don't make it out 
 Then I'm leaving town with that contract 
 And I'm spazzing out, grabbin' the A&R out 
 His chair and I'm taking him hostage 
 I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3 
 Now I'm headed up (Heist!) 
 What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can 
 And I'm ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate 
 Stuck in this recession, now what you think 
 If I could get signed my life is destined 
 My future depends on ink 
 And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me 
 I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink 
 I put my life on the line 
 I roll them dice and I'm fine 
 'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it 
 They ain't giving it, I'm taking it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it 
 I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit 
 If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals 
 But it's weird, it's like this room I've walked into is unusual 
 Thought it would be shiny and beautiful 
 Thought it would be alive and like musical 
 But it feels like someone died, it's got the vibe of a funeral 
 There's numbers on a chalkboard 
 CDs boxed in cardboard 
 Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores 
 Graphic designers are sitting around 
 Waiting for albums that never come out 
 Complainin' that they have nobody in house 
 Wonderin' what they make art for 
 I start thinking, am I in the right place? 
 Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall 
 Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours 
 Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent 
 Big block silver letters, read it out loud: President (nice!) 
 This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet 
 Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck 
 He said: we've been watching you, so glad you could make it 
 Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created 
 You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness 
 And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous 
 Now I'm sorry, I've had a long day remind me, now what your name is? 
 That's right, Macklemore, of course, today has been crazy 
 Anyway, you ready? We'll give you a hundred thousand dollars 
 After your album comes out we'll need back that money that you borrowed 
 So it's really like a loan, a loan? Come on, no 
 We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals! 
 We'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road 
 Along with a third of the money you make when you're out doing your shows 
 Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10 
 So shit, after taxes you and Ryan have 7% to split 
 That's not bad, I've seen a lot worse, No one will give you a better offer than us (Hmm) 
 I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted 
 Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked
