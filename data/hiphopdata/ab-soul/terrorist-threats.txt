(Featuring: Danny Brown and Jhene Aiko) 
 (Intro: Jhene aiko) 
 Kick your game, spit your flow 
 Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though 
 Kick your game, spit your flow 
 Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though 
 Kick your game, spit your flow 
 Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though 
 Kick your game, spit your flow 
 Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though 
 (Hook: Ab-Soul) 
 Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye 
 Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine 
 If all the gangs in the world unified 
 We'd stand a chance against the military tonight 
 I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight 
 I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight 
 (Verse 1: Ab-Soul) 
 Babylon, Babylon 
 At my window all I see is Babylon 
 On the news all I see is Babylon 
 And all niggas do is just babble on 
 Money and hoes, want money and hoes 
 If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows 
 I was from the projects like Jay Rock 
 I woulda more than likely slang rocks 
 All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods 
 Pimps and thugs - just to name a few 
 I do drugs, Mama say it's in my blood 
 But she don't know what the fuck I've been through 
 To creep through the back door, the typical black boy in the good old U-S-A 
 Before I pushed rhymes like weight, I used to wanna play for the NBA 
 Fuck I'm doing talking bout pineal gland 
 Ancient ways it's Sumerian 
 Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man 
 This why I had to write this man 
 For my niggas on the corner 
 Selling water to somebody's daughter 
 Fluctuating prices man 
 I ain't got no gavel 
 I ain't tryna fight nobody battle 
 I-I just wanna be free 
 I ain't tryna be nobodies chattel 
 (Verse 2: Ab-Soul) 
 Extra pills, Extra pills 
 Them AK Clips they extra peel 
 Smoking on some of that extra kill 
 Purple Urkel, that Jaleel 
 I put that on errythang 
 If we could link up erry gang 
 And niggas is willing to bear the pain 
 We'd put the White House lights out today 
 Okay-kay-kay 
 We guarded like we the black KKK 
 Don't forget my AK-a Mayday 
 Pee on your P-H-D or your AA 
 Dear Barack 
 I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props 
 You lying to the public like it ain't nothing 
 And I just love it, I hope it don't stop 
 I don't give a damn, nigga bang that block 
 I don't give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock 
 I seen an image of Hitler in the picture 
 When the twin towers dropped 
 Peep the concept 
 You've got progress, you've got congress 
 We protest in hopes they confess 
 Just proceed on your conquest 
 I ain't got no gavel 
 I ain't finna fight nobody battle 
 I just wanna be free 
 I ain't finna be nobodies chattel 
 (Verse 3: Danny Brown) 
 Extra pills, extra pills 
 Nose got a ring like Soul For Real 
 My baby some need Enfamil 
 So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill 
 Pull around, come back, oh forreal? 
 Talk blue off low for some teal 
 Get lined up like homeless meals 
 Filling, if I know how being homeless feels? 
 Okay-kay-kay 
 Don't try to stop it, get in my way 
 You'll get stomped like a Broadway play 
 AK-melee, make her obey, okay? 
 Feel my pain, going insane, I'm ashamed 
 'Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card from a fiend 
 That owe me and it's in her daughter name 
 How the fuck is they pose to eat? 
 How the fuck am I pose to eat? 
 Got a nigga in the streets, no health care 
 Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet 
 So fuck you, you don't give a fuck about me 
 Can't get a job 'cause they drug test me 
 Got a nigga stressed oppressed 
 Got a feeling in his chest 
 And the world's stripped of happiness 
 I ain't got no gavel 
 I ain't tryna fight nobody battle 
 I just wanna be free 
 I ain't finna be nobodies chattel
