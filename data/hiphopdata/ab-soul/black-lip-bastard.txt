Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt 
 Puffin' on a Black and Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out 
 Smoke till I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now 
 All black everything, Black Hippy the regime 
 Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt 
 Puffin' on a Black and Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out 
 Hot box like Pacquiao packed in the steamroom 
 That's ain't eucalyptus you sniffin' it's weed fool 
 We in this mufucker thick ass high like my bitch 
 Gimme room like a Motel 6 or meet your doom 
 And tell em' this, I got more participants that think it's just a myth 
 Adjust your mutherfuckin' stereo 
 So I can drop the bomb on you and watch your fuckin' ears explode 
 All we do is do it (x10) 
 (Nigga squadddd) 
 I'm the highest nigga at the bottom of the totem pole 
 And I ain't sweatin' shit man, I'm cooler than where sodas go 
 Fuck so and so long as Soul show up ho! 
 Tell do' po' up I'm finna go in (go in) 
 Blowin' L's not takin' L's go win 
 Do a nigga squad you will not survive 
 You ain't on this side? You are livin' lies 
 Put two and two together, I'm the one, high five 
 Mobbin' like I'm tryna catch a case 
 The dick make your chick jaw drop Ma catch your face 
 Eatin rappers on a plate like Etouffee 
 I do this everyday this verse is a 8th of ye' 
 When you look at me what do you see? 
 If I wasn't in Black Hippy I'd be the 4th Fugee 
 Unruly, seekin' redemption in light of Tookie 
 The game is all ours like violent movies 
 Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt 
 Puffin' on a Black and Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out 
 Smoke till I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now 
 All black everything, Black Hippy the regime 
 Black Panther party reincarnated, y'all hate it 
 Niggas tryna put a hex on me like the Star of David 
 Everything I say is real 
 Got a few jewels in high places you know the deal 
 Fuck you niggas talkin' bout? 
 Your run is over like the Oprah show walk it out 
 They say I'm really out my mind mane 
 All do is get high and play mind games 
 This is my game I paid off the referee 
 Been fouled since I was born like Jeffery 
 The only MC with telepathy 
 Fuck that the only celebrity in 11-D 
 I swear to God it won't be long 
 I have Tyler lightin' bongs and recitin' Psalms 
 I'm an angel wit' an angle what I mean well 
 I'm just a demon that means well 
 Hey Ali you know what they call me? 
 You know what they call me Ali? Huh? 
 Black lip bastard 
 Big bitch
