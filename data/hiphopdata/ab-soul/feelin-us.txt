6:19 In the morning nigga 
 Let me start off with this statement 
 I'm the motherfucking greatest 
 I ain't even have too many haters 
 All my niggas knew I was gon' make it 
 From performing at Pep Rallys, showcases, talent shows 
 That I had to sell tickets for, just to get up in that ho 
 Now raise your hand say Soulo Ho! 
 Raise your hand say Soulo Ho! 
 I'm rolling up in the tour bus

 Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia 
 But I'm finna continue, pass the tri to my nigga Tone 
 Couldn't find a fire but this far from home 
 But we still trying, I mean we still chiefing 
 She thinks it's cool, she took a puff, she still freaking 
 I popped a bean, fell asleep, woke up, and started thinking

 Hit the stage, then beat the case, then get the cake, then burn trees 
 Shake hands, kiss babies, show love, throw 3s 
 I was on the block with a quarter key, like what the fuck is a 16? 
 I was so anti-social, nigga wasn't outspoken 
 Till I picked up a mic, story of my life! 
 Uh, came with the piece so keep the peace 
 Uh, I ain't tryna hurt nobody 
 I ain't sweating no vendetta, champagne on my breath in the hotel lobby 
 You feel me? Damn right you feel me!

 Staying awake off this Xanny 
 Knock knock off this weed can one of y'all find another Backwood please?

 Making a way for my homies, making it easy for my family 
 So mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more 
 No mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more 
 Told me I'm smarter than you, you just gotta trust me yo
