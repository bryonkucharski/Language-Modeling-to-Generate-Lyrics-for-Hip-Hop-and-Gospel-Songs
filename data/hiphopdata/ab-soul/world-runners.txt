These days I'm so focused 
 Fast life, slow motion 
 These, these days I'm so focused 
 These days I'm so focused 
 Fast life, slow motion 
 Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 And life is but a dream 
 And I would never leave her 
 But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
 And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
 You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
 And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
 'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo 
 We run, we run, we run the world (Get high) (Yeah) 
 Yeah, can you hear it? 
 I spread love, can you feel it in your spirit? 
 When doves cry shit get serious 
 You feel like a prince in a pharaoh's pyramid 
 Scheme turned dream turned nightmare on Elm Street 
 Ye ain't got your heart in the right place 
 How the hell you plan to stay on beat, on beat? 
 Yeah, I put that on me 
 I got a gun and a good book, leave all your homies holy, moly 
 Black sheep, no miss Bo Peep 
 Motherfuck police 'til they release all of my OG's 
 You could lean on me 'til you Morgan Free 
 You don't need no sleep 
 Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 And life is but a dream 
 And I would never leave her 
 But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
 And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
 You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
 And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
 'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo 
 We run, we run, we run the world (Get high) (Yeah) 
 Can't spell Illuminati without Lu can't spell Lu without you 
 Can't spill blood without blue now ask yourself what is what I do 
 Let you put that together without glue without stue, fast life 
 Built a time machine in my past like 
 A horror story about as long as Fukushima half-life 
 And mostly I'll be ghost, and to talk about it have to rhyme into a flashlight 
 Now that's a long way from blackface track that they using for your rat race 
 Connected to a cat face, you can ask them pussies how a lap taste 
 Maybe like cookies to a monster 
 Run a mouse to the miles of meows, call me now 
 Full speed ahead, full speed ahead 
 To allow no limits, there are no limits 
 No limits allowed, no limits exist 
 There are no limits 
 Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 And life is but a dream 
 And I would never leave her 
 But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
 And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
 You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
 And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
 'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo 
 We run, we run, we run the world (Get high) (Yeah) 
 Go, go, uh 
 Yeah, no roof on the jeep with a big old chain 
 Niggas left for the sniff and came back for the base 
 You could tell he was tripping by the look on his face 
 No new jacks in my city 
 Aye, I'm feeling like G money, money, money 
 Yeah, uh, I'm feeling like G money, money, money 
 Yeah, no new jacks in my city 
 Bitch, I'm G money, money, money
