Before I exit out this motherfucker, bet you know my name 
 I'm into Swisher Sweets and five dollar champagne 
 You should join my campaign before I lose my damn brain 
 I'm chasing a winning and I don't know if I'm losing or winning 
 Damn shame 
 Shit, I ain't complaining 
 It's no limits nigga, it's only entertainment 
 So I'm in the Bugatti and got the burner too 
 Right place, right time, I'll murder you 
 Huh, I finally get it 
 What's the use in being witty ain't nobody wit' it 
 I'd rather sticky my woody in a wonder woman 
 So good I might never want another one 
 But I'mma always want another woman 
 Real nigga to the core my dude 
 Straight from the liquor store 
 From getting more sippy from me and my recipients 
 Till we stumble to the floor my dude, straight off top 
 T.D.E. till 3003 
 No scratch that, I can't calculate that exact 
 My downfall will probably never be an incident though 
 Use your mind, don't just listen to the instrumental 
 Read the signs before you end up in a pile of shit 
 You probably did 
 The least you can do is crack a window 
 You smell that? 
 And if I catch him taking a nap, I tell him that... 
 I hope it hit you like a bus done run up into ya 
 I'm only fuckin' with ya 
 I know it's nothing to ya 
 What I gotta make is something to ya 
 Slept on us long enough, you got it coming to ya 
 See me I'm from the mid, don't fuck with the kid 
 Heavy artillery, this long will split your wig 
 Put your fitted on the curb 
 You know, rip your lid 
 Brains on the sidewalks you know what it is, that is 
 I got that strict mentality 
 Razorblade in my mouth, Bitch wanna battle me 
 Huh? I slice this bitch up, I ain't playin' 
 Snare need stitches from the words that I'm sayin' 
 Name my badem, Reppin' L.A.'n 
 Tattoo's showin', mean muggin' at the way in 
 Smack you with a bottle that I picked up on the way in 
 And them niggas that rollin' with you only with you cause you pay 'em 
 And real niggas don't get extorted 
 We call for the mother ship, then we board it 
 That mean we fly like we wanna fly 
 Me and Ab comin' for you, better go runnin' high 
 Look, I'm really sick, you need to quit 
 Like quiet without the E 
 Supplyin' the D-man's 
 Sometimes it gets deep man 
 You will die in the deep end 
 Surviving to see it 
 And I'mma be here, The bible is re-writ 
 HiiiPower, you can yell it 
 But make sure it's three it's when you spell it 
 I'm at the bottom of the barrel, let them niggas tell it 
 I might have to put the barrel to a niggas melon 
 Pull up on a few hoes in the new McLaren 
 Back to the condo, condom broke, now I'm a parent 
 Still smilin' in the mirror, nigga here to think 
 Everybody got it comin' to 'em, even me 
 You only reap what you sow 
 You only get what you knit 
 My garden's grown, and I'm about to throw a fit
