See, I just wanna take my chopper 
 And aim it right at that copper 
 Just locked up my partner 
 ... They can't stop us 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 Inhale, exhale 
 Inhale, exhale 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 I'm prolly all alone on this one 
 Prolly all on this one 
 Prolly all on this one 
 Who's bold enough to rebel? 
 Rebel 
 Re 
 Who's bold enough to rebel? 
 Rebel

 That's the joint, that's the jam 
 Turn it up, play it again 
 That's the joint, that's the jam 
 Turn it up, play it again 
 That's the joint 
 That's the jam 
 Turn it up 
 Play it again 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I just wanna grab that heater 
 Run right in the cathedral 
 Aim it right at that preacher 
 For miseducating the people 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 I might all alone on this one 
 Inhale, exhale 
 Inhale, exhale 
 I just wanna take that banger 
 And aim it right at my Maker 
 For placing me 'round all this danger 
 I can't even trust my neighbor 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 Inhale, exhale 
 Inhale, exhale 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 I know I'm all alone on this one 
 Who's bold enough to rebel? 
 Rebel

 That's the joint, that's the jam 
 Turn it up, play it again 
 That's the joint, that's the jam 
 Turn it up, play it again 
 That's the joint 
 That's the jam 
 Turn it up 
 Play it again
