You would have thought I was infatuated with being underrated instead of renowned 
 Got me feeling like king david before the crown 
 I too have my views like you 
 Look what I do to stand on stages in front of crowds 
 I need food but I'd rather smoke a black and mild 
 Get back in the booth and spill my heart until I bust a valve 
 And that's the truth, hand over my left titty 
 I had faith in hip hop before she met biggie 
 Just take this shit a day at a time 
 I thought I was on after day in the life 
 But you know our shit get put on hold after reality strikes 
 You ain't know I knew how to bowl 
 How you eat when there ain't even a bowl? 
 My stomach sound like something in the jungle 
 My mind saying give it up, the people saying don't go 
 It's easier to leave when you ain't got no dough 
 Cheap champagne wishes and thirty ratchet hoes 
 All up in my videos until you niggas see the vision (I ain't playing) 
 Guess a nigga never checked out the tension 
 In my second childhood making music from the soul 
 Just so you know, crack a backwood 
 Fill it with that good and take a toke 
 On and on and on and 
 They think me and these other rappers have something in common 
 God bless them, amen 
 I ain't stressing, I'm all in 
 They in lois lane, I'm clark kent 
 Go back to what's happening 
 Jay rock finna drop and walk you all around rocks 
 Kendrick keep getting chased by cameramen 
 And for the first time you've seen a hoover crip on the charts 
 As for me I'm still an amateur, venting 
 Looking for the right cannon 
 To capture your attention, I need honorable mention 
 Most of all I need to exist in the fourth dimension 
 But niggas say I sing better than I rap 
 Who give a crap about all them damn metaphors and diction? (fuck that) 
 Took a step back to reevaluate my steez 
 Went to friendzone alone and wrote a gang of trees 
 Labels calling for everybody except for me 
 Like I ain't got the recipe 
 Like this ain't my destiny 
 You know how much my family expect from me? 
 Especially considering I'm literally chasing a dream 
 Told g-packs I'mma slip through the crack 
 Get that cream, that's a fact yo 
 Whoever thought I'd get to write for dr. dre? 
 He probably thought it was trash and threw that shit away 
 But it's a new day, new possibilities 
 My time'll come sooner enough 
 No hostility, that type of shit'll slow you up 
 Don't get caught up in all of the marketing to show you up 
 He from top dawg?, he more like a pup 
 He ain't from the streets, where the fuck he come from? 
 Who cosigning him, don't believe the hype 
 You niggas can't see me, can't call me on skype 
 I'm all bite, no bark 
 A benz to a go-kart 
 All I do is go as hard as adult film costars 
 So on and so on 
 Never lag, never that 
 You can't see?, look 
 They told me to break a leg, so now I'm an amputee 
 Give me fifty feet like g-unit's sneaks 
 Soul brother number two times whoever you bring 
 Motherfucker
