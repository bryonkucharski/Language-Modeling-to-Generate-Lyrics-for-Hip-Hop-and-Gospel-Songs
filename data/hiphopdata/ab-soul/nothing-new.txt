Hello, good morning 
 This is mourning, just a feeling I reckon 
 I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it 
 I heard I got fans and friends playing my records 
 I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it 
 Don't forget that dash in my name when you print it 
 It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice 
 Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it 
 I'm a God MC not a polytheist 
 And why is your reaction always so obvious 
 Let a reverend run in my adidas 
 You'll see that despite all these dislikes I am like Jesus 
 Don't follow 10 commandments 
 But I don't seem to break to many of them either 
 Try to understand me 
 Obama said "yes we can" 
 But that can't be 
 'Cause we was raising money for his campaign 
 T-shirt, plates, and mugs 
 But won't do the same in our own community? 
 What the fuck... 
 I said what the fuck? 
 And it ain't nothing new 
 All I do is eat, sleep, and shit 
 Reflect on my life 
 Find the perfect words to rhyme it with 
 Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed 
 And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return 
 How's it going, good afternoon 
 I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you 
 It's funny though, I could have just told a lie 
 And made it true to take the mood 
 You think I am what I ain't 
 Like a saint or fake 
 We could go toe to toe, you're choice it's no debate 
 Soul brother number 2 
 And every single one of my dreams is coming true 
 I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need 
 But it always ends up with me running out of tree 
 In sheer disbelief 
 Tell me how I can get high as the sky and keep my ear to the streets 
 At the same time, no diamonds in my watch 
 Can I still shine, will anybody watch 
 If I could hold you attention for at least a minute 
 You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist 
 Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace 
 And obviously ominous to your opinions 
 Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion 
 Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission 
 I don't mean to disrespect when I express 
 My vision was meant to connect not to reject 
 Don't press eject... 
 I said don't press eject... 
 Soul! 
 And it ain't nothing new 
 All I do is eat, sleep, and shit 
 Reflect on my life 
 Find the perfect words to rhyme it with 
 Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed 
 And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return 
 It ain't nothing new to me 
 Should be nothing new to you 
 Let's accomplish the impossible 
 Free in body, mind, and soul 
 No idea's original 
 It's nothing new under the sun 
 It's never what you do 
 But how it's done 
 If you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper 
 That means your inferior not major...
