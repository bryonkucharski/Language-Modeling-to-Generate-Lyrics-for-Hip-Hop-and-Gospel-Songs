Righteous man 
 Walk with me 
 Bear the burden 
 Yo, yo, yo, no, no 
 Don't do you dare, cast one stone in air 
 I'm cracking stone with bear hands, you're a mere man 
 I know all my stoners here, all my visionaries 
 Shades in the night, that's a scary sight 
 I'm never in the dark though, my squad the brightest circle 
 Watch with the internet alone I enlighten the whole globe 
 That's iTunes from a nigga with astigmatism 
 I got it from my moms, thank you Steve Jobs 
 You took my grandpa job and you gave me a job 
 Not just a physical but digital way of displaying my rhymes 
 And making these kind people pay a fine 
 I've been through a lot, I deserve a lot, this work's fine 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses 
 I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again 
 Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am 
 Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata 
 Yawk-yawk-yawk-yawk 
 Stigamata, stigmata, stigmata 
 From the fiery pits, on some Dead Poet's Society shit 
 Here to bring you a variety mix 
 Grab my dick, violently spit 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck about the type of shit 
 Batty boys are wrong, get your vaginas wet 
 And you shaking in your ballet shoes 
 At the restaurant we valet twos, bad news 
 Half moons on ten goons, uh 
 On the four wheeler shredding up the sand dunes 
 There's something wrong and that's quite clear 
 I smell deception in the night's air 
 That shit is sweeter than a ripe pear 
 For your love, I cut my right ear 
 I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
 I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses 
 I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again 
 Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am 
 Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata 
 Yawk-yawk-yawk-yawk 
 Stigamata, stigmata, stigmata 
 Oh no, no, no they didn't 
 Cause these ain't bars, these prisons 
 Walk with me, every step I take in these Visvims 
 Real rare breed, cut from the cloth like 
 A phoenix feather when I write, molotov, yikes! 
 You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair 
 A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there 
 My crown has been made, I just had to put it on 
 Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song 
 And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried 
 But still I am more than a man, I am a God 
 Sweetest still is pain amongst all of the thriller things 
 I been through enough and so I need all of the iller things 
 One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God 
 Read it, and will believe it 
 Then the rest of us will be embarrassed
