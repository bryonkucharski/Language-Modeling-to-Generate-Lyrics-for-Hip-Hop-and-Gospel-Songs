Ab-Soul: 
 Back when I first grabbed that pen 
 I told myself I was gon' win 
 And I ain't know when 
 But it was gon' end 
 Up happening, I want in 
 So you can take your top 5 list 
 Dead or alive and put me after Em 
 I'm a fucking genius 
 Gripping my fucking penis, living this life 
 You can't tell me nothing 
 Still ain't really got no money fucking right 
 I'm all about that real, about that real 
 This ain't no motion picture 
 I tell you how that feel, how that feel 
 Even when the odds against you 
 They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers 
 Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong 
 But that ain't me, I go too damn hard 
 I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out 
 Black lip nigga with his hair wild 
 Too damn proud 
 Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy 
 Oh boy, I'm the man now 
 TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free 
 This business is quick sand and I won't sink 
 Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think 
 Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be 
 I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, okay then 
 Further more we do this for y'all 
 Rap is stressin' but it pays great 
 That is until you lose appeal 
 And your release date gets date raped 
 Stay safe, hold your head 
 I got two fifth and a loaf of bread 
 Feed the people, food for thought 
 Because we are equal, who'd have thought 
 Ab-Soul & Kendrick: 
 They wanna share my light (Repeat x8) 
 You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light (Repeat x2) 
 Ab-Soul: 
 I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z 
 Now I feel I could run laps around Jay-Z 
 Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty 
 B.I.G. & Pac got it coming when I pass too 
 You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to 
 My niggas say my new shit past due 
 I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed 
 HiiiPoWeR on another plateau 
 I know you know we need a few plaques too 
 The brand new niggas with a attitude 
 Poppin' Compton or Timbuktu 
 I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too 
 Too ill when I jot these words 
 True eel when I shock the world 
 I know life's a bitch 
 When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl 
 Cold shit, I'm hot though 
 Like coal get, Ab-Soul 
 This is a shift in paradigm 
 I remember when I couldn't spare a dime 
 Now I step in with a pair of dimes 
 On P's, y'all know me 
 Flow like water, admiralty 
 The best author ever to breathe 
 And as we proceed to follow these dreams 
 I ain't losing no sleep 
 No, no at them no doors 
 Just know "No" if it's no dough 
 So high but I'm Soulo 
 Two cups and I sip slow 
 Taking my time 
 We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show 
 Now let's go 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 Time and time I drop line for line 
 But only time will tell 
 If I ever go Columbine 
 And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill 
 See the truth is 
 They wanna know how close me and Dre and Snoop is 
 Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to beat 2Pac 
 But truth I give two shits 'bout 
 Expectations or critics hating 
 Shit, I just put moms on vacation 
 Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations 
 Court cases get thrown out 
 So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now 
 I am ruler, I am highness 
 The Prince Zamunda 
 I am the shit like what the prune does 
 Black on black tint like Kinta Kunta 
 Black is back bitch I'm kin to coup de 
 Black on black crime resent the shooter 
 Blat, blat, blat, I intend to mute you 
 Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks 
 Without my A-game so please don't ask 
 Me about no pressure 
 Bitch with a grip of my fingertip 
 I can hold this coast together
