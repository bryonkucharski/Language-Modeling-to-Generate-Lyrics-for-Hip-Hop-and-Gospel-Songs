(Intro ? Baby D.) 
 Where my hustlers at, it's time to get down? 
 [Chorus - Blazed] X3 
 I'm about money, bitch I'm about money 
 I'm about money, bitch I'm about money 
 Bitch I'm, bitch I'm about money 
 I'm on a chase for that paper 
 (Verse 1 ? Baby D.) 
 I'm about money it's M.O.B. 
 Bens, Grants, that's all I see 
 Brown paper bag, pass that to me 
 Grab that duffle bag out the backseat 
 Die for the cheddar I carry that llama 
 Stack it in the winter so I shine this summer 
 Yeah, what you really know about that? 
 I come like self bring a little back 
 You want to build a stack? 
 Nigga what's that? 
 At least spend ten so I can get a good pack 
 I get guap, understand that 
 I'm way in the front, y'all way in the back 
 Give me my keys, you not valet 
 My Maserati, your Chevrolet 
 Haters can't stop me I'm on my shit 
 I love guap, baby that's my bitch 
 And 
 I always give back to the hood nigga 
 When I roll through they say Baby D's a good nigga 
 Feeling good nigga 
 Looking good nigga 
 Put your knot in the air if you're a money go getter 
 Ball 
 Now I'm up haters 
 Ball 
 Black stone, black chain I'm Vader 
 Fall 
 Hell naw not me player 
 Call 
 Me if you about that paper 
 (Verse 2 ? Baby D.) 
 If you about money 
 We about money 
 Throw it in the air 
 Make it rain hundreds 
 I get guap 
 Monday through Sunday 
 Never sleep on me 
 Never seen me coming 
 Check my resume, your boy top notch 
 Take it from the rainbow straight to the pot 
 Think I'm broke? 
 Nope I'm not 
 Pants on my ankles, that's that guap 
 Then, Oomp sat down with Koch 
 Made them a promise we'll never ever flop 
 Came from the bottom straight to the top 
 Nigga 
 Ain't been the same since Pac 
 Look around this motherfucker a lot of niggas shocked 
 While he out he take my spot 
 Down 
 A lot of niggas left but I stayed 
 Down 
 Make you bow down nigga give that 
 Crown 
 Never met a nigga like me 
 A-Town fresh, Gucci from my head to my feet 
 Ten toes, stunting on my Bunyan 
 I wonder how long you can keep them on you 
 Funny 
 I see a nigga laughing but ain't shit funny 
 Straight to the bank I'm counting my money 
 "A-Town's Secret Weapon", yup I'm coming 
 Big Oomp Records got to keep that bumping
