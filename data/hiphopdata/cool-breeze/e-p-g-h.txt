Who raps get weight like grams on triple beams? 
 Who got their heart on tapes and CDs? 
 He rap and she rap, but my rap - the best 
 They rap with play raps, and I ain't impressed 
 Cool raps get weight like grams on triple beams 
 Cool left with dirt and came back with G's 
 Everytime I hit the door, they fly 
 Wantin' to know the response of the people 
 On the date when my album dropped 
 The East Point headlines gon' read that 
 I ride tracks, like Dre high-ride Cadillacs 
 And came a long way from the country 
 Here all in Atlanta, and about to make some real money 
 And show brothas who a straight lane 
 Who got picked at, and talked about 
 Who followed me, and now got game 
 The first scriptures in the book, they meant 
 If you was really from this town and 'bout to do it 
 You do your own hits 
 See, it was destined that I make a print 
 In the earth, so the future knew the Lord was makin' much sense 
 Now it ain't nothin' that can worry me 
 My attitude is free and can see... 
 That you can be in Hawaii sippin' on that punch 
 Buy a house in the morning, get a Lexus for lunch 
 Sell a million of those samples and those same ol' kicks 
 It still take a ol' school hustla with a greatest hit 
 Young Cool Breeze ain't never did time 
 When the foes went to raid, I was home writing rhymes 
 Representin' the south forever, put raps together 
 Hit 'em with the salt, then come the pepper 
 You see, I represent the field 
 And only a few from the east and the west gon' really keep it real 
 And it's like a lot of them gon' start dissin' 
 But we'll make money, sell records 
 And serve 'em up like competition 
 And I be the first to crank up the spot 
 Say you don't know nothin' 'bout the south 
 And Atlanta ain't no Mariott 
 I seen a lot of brothas get they turn 
 And the way they act? 
 Respect gon' be given when respect be earned 
 Me and my boys grew up listenin' to y'all songs 
 If we can't be off city poppin' lip, we be dead wrong 
 So I just check for your release date 
 And if it's bumpin' and you snappin', I'll pick it up 
 'Cause I don't city hate 
 See, it ain't all about who you run with 
 Or the trap that you just can't front, got the biggest bricks 
 Or who you and your boys run and get 
 It just take a ol' school hustla with a greatest hit 
 "Heart..."
