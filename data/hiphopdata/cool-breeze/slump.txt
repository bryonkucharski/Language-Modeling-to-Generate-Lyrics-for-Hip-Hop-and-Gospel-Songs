(Backbone) 
 From front to back street, listen, we on a mission 
 To get right, workin street corner in the midnight 
 Picture the scene, these fiends with fire 
 Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that 
 I'm wit whateva like wheatstraw 
 Stuck servin' my cocaine raw 
 Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back 
 Twenty over now that's mo' money to get 
 Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught 
 But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short 
 Plus that crooked cop brock think we blow slangin (fuck him) 
 That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin 
 But I make moves -- shake them tricks up out they shoestrings 
 Be more precise when we do things 
 Cause life like shakin the dice, but I buck back twice 
 Like five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay 
 Chorus: repeat 2x 
 I'm strickly dressin dirty dirty 
 Gone represent it to the t-top 
 Born and bred up on the street top 
 Get to the money and the sweet spot 
 And forever hollerin 
 "Hootie hoo!" when we see cops 
 (Big boi) 
 Sheyit 
 Cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents 
 They get in a slump like baseball players 
 When they short on they rent 
 Anything goin' you ain't knowin' how much money you spent 
 But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents 
 Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed 
 And all the chicken 
 Feedin everybody, smokin' 'em out 
 When you was broke though they was missin' 
 Now you ridin' bout fo' deep, startin to tear up yo' suspension 
 And your baby mamma on child support 
 My fault, forget to mention 
 You don't even have a checkin' account 
 Wasn't thinkin' about no pension 
 I used to work at steak 'n' ale, old gold off in the kitchen 
 Had determination and graduated 
 Now I got the whole rap world fascinated 
 I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it 
 Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it 
 But legislation got this new policy 
 Three strikes and you're ruined... now where your crew at? 
 Yeah... 
 (Cool breeze) 
 Ay 
 Me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs 
 We better watch what we doin', and look out for joe nab 
 And quit re'in-up and standin on this same old block 
 Before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot 
 Niggaz talkin' 'cause they makin' some flow 
 But still ain't did nuttin that ain't been done befo' 
 You can't be tryin' to showcase, just put it down for your spot 
 And improvise and work with that little you got 
 So I think when I finish sellin my last sack 
 I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back 
 Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin? 
 And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave
