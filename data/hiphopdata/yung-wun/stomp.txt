 No problem Barry; you don't no cemetery, homes 
 Just a pine box dropped off in the woods

 Standin out in the track with a bumma hard 
 Bummin weed into the sack

 Baby, 'cause I be wilder, big BALLER, call up with quarter 
 Trying to make a few endz 
 Be runnin' from the police, never want to follow the Impala
