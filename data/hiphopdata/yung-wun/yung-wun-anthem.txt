Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, uh uh, Yung Wun in here 
 Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, back up, back up, back up 
 (We gotta problem) 
 Time and time again, I try to be on the good foot 
 But ladies don't be given me good look 
 It's hard when you livin' like us, I started the good book 
 It's just what I see that got me shook 
 Mean mugs and cold stance take a nigga down 
 And to make him fail, I'mma take it to you how 
 Lights out, closed casket, murder warn 
 Yung Wun come through with the under grudge 
 And live the life, Yung talk about it 
 Don't make beef, come walk about it 
 Everybody know my name because I play in the street 
 Not because I say I'm street, mutha fucker 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 Now I don't give a fuck, if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 All my niggas is star [unverified] 
 Well, I don't give a fuck if y'all don't give a fuck 
 They all try to sound like Pac, I don't know why, hoe 
 Sounding like Pac is a position you shouldn't try, fool 
 They don't understand what they die for 
 And tell lies about black folk, and take from they own folk 
 That type of shit heavy poppin' through the stove 
 'Cause you don't wanna show your face 'cause it's a known place 
 And I don't love her face when she take from me man 
 And I don't give a fuck what you think of me 
 'Cause what you think of me is nothin' but a mere decision 
 And they shipped my ass off ta prison 
 If I die than death is a given and if I live let me enjoy living 
 That's a wonderful feeling 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 Now I don't give a fuck, if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 All my niggas is star [unverified] 
 Well, I don't give a fuck if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 Now I don't give a fuck, if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 All my niggas is star [unverified] 
 Well, I don't give a fuck if y'all don't give a fuck 
 As a kid I had no love for life 
 Everything I've done [unverified] they said it wasn't right 
 It doesn't matter hustlers scatter, everyday from 12 in the A T L 
 So love is like the wind blowing cold off the scale 
 Tell me what's going on, two wrongs don't make it right 
 But I know two holes in your dome will take your life 
 I'm on the precious shorty, they coming after what I treasure 
 It's time we start renting out yachts 
 Yung Wun yacht masters ship out blocks 
 Hold my block why'll I hand out glocks 
 Send the niggas over the hill 
 When they done, go pop somebody for show 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 Now I don't give a fuck, if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 All my niggas is star [unverified] 
 Well, I don't give a fuck if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 Now I don't give a fuck, if y'all don't give a fuck 
 All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty 
 All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty 
 All my niggas is star [unverified]
