 Lying ass nigga, you ain't buyin me things

 I thought you ain't like rap 
 You was deceiving me 
 All you do all day is watch bet 
 Actin' like you ain't recognize when you met me in the ride 
 Mispronouncing my name, squinting your eyes 
 You shouldn't play games wit pimp like i 
 Now that I gained you, I'm supposed to sympathise 
 Yeah I know, you hait parties and you never go out 
 Yeah I know, you a nun and you stay in your house 
 Yeah I know, well can you please do me this favor 
 How you been with three rappers and six ball players, tell me that 
 Shit, we both gamin eachother 
 Lying through our teeth, both blaming eachother 
 I tried to front on you I take you to my rest 
 You tried to front on me actin' like you ain't impressed 
 I'm tryin' to see if the coochie's propa 
 You trying to score your self a gucci parka 
 And that new shit from prada 
 You tryin' to get a rich baby father 
 I'm tryin' to forget you by tomorra 
 This ain't rocket science 
 Ain't no rock buyin, just a hard rock lyin' 
 And stop frontin like your shit is real 
 You get your game from oprah and lauryen hill 
 And if you are a nice girl, and I read you wrong 
 Look, I'm sorry if I lead you on, ok 
 (Amil) 
 Nah nigga, you ain't got to apologize 
 I knew that bitch want your cousin on your father's side 
 I mean damn, you don't even let me answer your cell 
 I mean damn, why I still got to ring the bell? 
 I find girl phone numbers and you say they your man's 
 When I call you don't even know who I am 
 So you can go ahead wit all that game you throw me 
 Don't tell me, motherfucka show me
