I'm on the up and up to hot to touch nigga 
 The narcs couldn't stop the rush 
 Smuggled in the package tight 
 I'm 98 a gram leaving attics nice 
 I get 5 you don't get half a mic 
 Been known to cut ass for the added hype 
 And I pop too much shit to be the marriage type 
 Get spoiled even when I'm not acting right 
 Can't nobody come with the style I bring? 
 Piece hanging on the chain just a dangling 
 Motorola 2-way so the cell don't ring 
 Crush R&B and I don't even sing 
 No reference and no pro tools 
 Till I'm up in my hersh 
 I'm a show and prove 
 Got up in the game and made my own rules 
 Put heat on the reels until I blow the fuse 
 All Money is Legal Baby 
 And what, and what 
 All Money Is Legal Baby 
 What 'chu thing, what 'chu know abut this 
 All Money Is Legal Baby 
 The higher the price 
 The hotter the rhyme 
 Amilliyon doper than heroin 
 Shoes got to be Gucci wht the fresh pair on 
 Spend up doe till its damn near gone 
 Lay it down get spins all year long 
 You know I run through them papers quick 
 You know I rock them glaciers sick 
 Chilling waiting for these shares to clear 
 I'm the only hot bich you gonna hear this year 
 You know I ass kick with no practice 
 Any joint I'm on automatic classic 
 Niggas pay me just to do ad-libs 
 And I move the crowd like I move to Saks Fifth 
 If I'm a gonna flash rocks then I'm a stash glocks 
 If I'm a gonna talk shit 
 Then I'm a walk it 
 All money is legal now 
 I'm with Hov, Bleek and Sigel now 
 Give me my cue and I'm ready to roll 
 Take a little ghetto celebrity stroll 
 Floss with the minks to heavy to hold 
 Baggettes be whoa, I gets me doe 
 I'm an uptown swinger 
 With the light blue on the pinkie finger 
 Amilliyon 'bout to shake some ass 
 I'm crack packed in till it break the glass 
 Keep crates of papes, in the steel encased safe 
 Watch doe accumulate like real-estate 
 And you know I gotta keep tricks up the sleeve 
 Leav'em bankrupt with blue balls till the dick bleed 
 Save all receipts write it off quickly 
 If I'm a ball I'm play up in the big leagues 
 Never fold when the pressure come 
 You could put Amil up against the best of 'em
