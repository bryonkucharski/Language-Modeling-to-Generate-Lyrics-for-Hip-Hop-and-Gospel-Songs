(Feat. Cool Breeze) 
 This is what I want you to do, right? 
 Take your shoes off, goddamn ground is holy 
 I understand that 
 Give me strength Lord, Lord 
 Give me strength, Give me strength 
 Give me strength Lord 
 Witchdoctor: 
 Ugh, My choice was the streets, kinda came natural to me 
 So I'm fishin', trouble comes 
 I'm dishin' out some shots from the doctor's gun 
 Got me trapped in this world under this moon and sun 
 Shit ain't fun or funny, fuck a smile, I'ts 'bout collectin' money 
 I'm tryin' to take better care of my body this quarter 
 Docter say drink more water, but Bacardi got you bent in this bitch 
 Life sometimes is like steppin' in some fuckin' house shit 
 Seven years of tears in the game 
 Made me one of the smallest preditors on this Georgia plain 
 In the fields, in the hills, never picked no cotton 
 It's the nigga wit that golden trigga 
 I'm seein' more planes in the sky at night 
 Look like UFO's, think they transportin' dem kilo's 
 The drug cartel has swelled out of proportion 
 On the corner everyday we indorsin' 
 The street life is my life, scratchin' to stay on top 
 I'm rappin' it for my block, Atlanta 
 You betta have some game in yo' veins 
 You betta learn this southern slang 
 (Cool Breeze talking) 
 That's right, from East Point to Southwest 
 Southwest to East Piont, y'all know what it is 
 Come on in 
 Cool Breeze: 
 I'm hearin' rumors about what yo' clique gone do 
 I stepped up like it was cool and confronted his crew 
 I said "Now which one of y'al suppose to take me to school?" 
 If you see a lame nigga, nigga take his shoes 
 I'm from Eats Point, Atlanta, we don't fight by rules 
 You don't know Cool Breeze or lil Freddy Calhoun 
 In this place, the dirty south, we'll hit ya for a lick 
 Sell you dreams, nice things, and it be a box of bricks 
 Most haters, imitators, think they know Cool Breeze 
 Ain't jack but a rat on my East Point cheese 
 I know it iritates yo' ears, how I chop these trees 
 You nothin' but a lame 'round these EPV's 
 All my enemies who don't know what they jumped in 
 If the doctor came through once, he'll come through again 
 And when look and he ask me where everybody is 
 They didn't believe in your return so they ran for the hills 
 And I still got that same pain in my chest 
 My perscription stress, no cess, and wear a Teflon vest 
 And these niggas still try and test 
 Don't even know me or these Georgia plains 
 Boy these grounds are HOLYYYY!
