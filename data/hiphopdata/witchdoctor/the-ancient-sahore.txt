(Lady talking) 
 No matter how advanced medical technology becomes 
 Many people still believe in the ancient healing arts 
 (Fades out) 
 I had a dream I came up on a key 
 Busted it down, nic'ed it all up and brought back forty G'z 
 We put a big trap on the map 
 Talkin' in code in case "twelve" got the phones tapped 
 We got down wit niggas wit all types of skills 
 From gun runnin', cookin' dope, stolen wheels 
 That cheese was comin' in wit a grin 
 We all up in the club, straight to spend 
 And 'bout a hundred sippin' Mo' 
 Didn't know that cooked swine tasted that same but just cost more dollars 
 Let my nigga's ride my Impala 
 Let's see if these hoes gone choose me 
 Without thinkin' about dollars 
 Had a dream them keys cost a half a mil. 
 Moved away, found a bitch and a crib 
 Now I feel like God, talkin' like a man whose face had the scar 
 Ugh, We all know who you are 
 If I only had twelve dollars I'd still feel like a star 
 I tried to stay up in my bankin', listen close to this dream 
 Don't run off and smoke no dank-in 
 I don't use cocaine but in this dream I was totin' 
 Got ta' scrappin' at the club and went ta' shootin' 
 Blood runnin' down my nose, caught that nigga who swung on me 
 Pointed my gun and he froze, He said: (it wasn't me, it wasn't me!) 
 Ugh, It was you, pulled the trigger he was through 
 Sahore, Sahore Sahore, Feel the doctor cure-ure-ure 
 (Feel the doctor cure) 
 Sahore, Sahore, Sahore, Fell the doctor cure-ure-ure-ure-ure-ure-ure 
 Months later got rid of that bitch 
 But she wasn't no crook, got rid of her 'cause she couldn't fuckin' cook 
 I'm from the south so you know I cuss a hoe out 
 I had to tell another hoe to straight roll out 
 My outlook on female burned that summer 
 Thought every bitch was a hoe but my momma 
 The dope game got strange within seconds 
 And as the third day, done ran off wit my other package 
 I gotta do him when I see him, 
 Ain't gone ask no questions, just gone draw out and bust it 
 And wit this sixteen shot Baretta 
 Wit my initials E.J. ingraved in big ol' muthafuckin letters 
 Learn, you can have money and not be at peace wit yo' self 
 Now-a-dayz you gotta watch every muthafuckin' step 
 Every move is costly, see in this drug game any muthafucka out here can croos 
 Me 
 I told myself I gotta retire wit this eighty G stash 
 But I had a lust for makin' cash 
 A lil bit more then what I need, I think they call that shit greed, as I 
 Proceed 
 I'm southern po' nigga, but in this dream I was a fiend for cash 
 Fancy clothes had my ass 
 Was my own clan gittin' shady? Buckets, Team, Buffy, do they wanna stuff me? 
 Livin' wit a gun, never livin' at ease, almost everybody 'round that street 
 Sleez 
 You lucky if you make it out alive 
 Ask that nigga that been robbed before and didn't die 
 And that dream about them key, the police one day gone hollar freeze 
 Straight from the southwest S.W.A.T.s 
 Y'all niggas don't know what's in these, yeah 
 Collage, Collage Park, E-Pat 
 Like dis here, yeah (ah) 
 We gone do dis here like dis here wit it, yeah
