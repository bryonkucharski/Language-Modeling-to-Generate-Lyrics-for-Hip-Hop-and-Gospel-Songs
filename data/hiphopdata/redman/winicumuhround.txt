The hype's got me, I knock 'em out the box then out socks 
 Cause winicumuhround, niggaz skate like the rocks 
 My block...'s hot, so gimme all you got 
 When I'm done rockin', I leave you all doin' the Bus Stop 
 My format spins wheels like Pat Sajak 
 I rub niggaz out like Ajax now hit the playback 
 Rrrwwhwoaah, look out, roast 'em like cookouts 
 I'm smoked out, all you MC's, pull your books out 
 Word is bond it's on I get at Dawn like Marvin Gaye 
 Starvin since the days of Kindergarten 
 When I dye my ashes, flip my coffin backwards 
 Blow shit up like the 4th of July, with half sticks 
 And on and on, to the break of Rae-Dawn Chong 
 I'm Killin' You Softly with this song, with this bomb 
 I'm like the Bronx, 'cause I Boogie Down 
 I'm representin Jersey motherfucker, winicumuhround 
 Winicumuhround, homeboy watch yo nugget 
 (Aiyyo-yo-yo Redman, yo that was last album) Aiyyo fuck it, bust it 
 The top, notch, look over your sess spots 
 Get dumb like a whole bag of jumps with red tops 
 Burn more steam than carpet cleaners 
 I'm meaner then I'm iller than OJ, catchin a misdemeanor 
 Boom-bash I set it off (right right) 
 I shot up your lights while you caught up in the heights 
 My lyrics starvin, my crew runs like the mob and 
 The funk butter cup, 'cause I'm a bastard at robbin 
 I shake the valleys over Cali when I'm spliffed up 
 Rock a fifth up, that measure nine point oh on the Erichter 
 Are you tuned in to my tunes it's boom 
 Y'all niggaz couldn't see me if y'all had zoom 
 I'm accurate like Acura, my style's ninety years maximum 
 Fuel-injected like a Maxima, wheni'muharound motherfucker 
 The way I get wreck y'all niggaz call it mic check 
 I'm vexed and if I got an itchy finger like Bernard Geotz 
 With a pad and a pen I blend funky images 
 That leave your girl hemmoragin for about two million and 
 Three years move along there's nothing to see here 
 If I wasn't nice motherfucker I wouldn't be here 
 Yeah yeah put metaphors inside a bracket 
 Def Squad's in the house AND MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN BACK IT 
 Come test your skills for real with a bomb bang boom bang 
 The sound makes your brains wet 
 With The Color Purple on a freight train 
 The devil's the conductor 
 Then take a trip to the darkside motherfuckers 
 My funky pattern takes interludes around Saturn 
 I'm more diesel than evil meant evil like Sebastian 
 Don't try this at home kids, I zone with ET's 
 And other alien type of MC's 
 So throw your shit up in the sky, cause Redman's about to get live 
 Like one-two-five 
 I smoke High Times magazines when I lounge 
 And broken mics and cords is left, winicumuhround motherfucker
