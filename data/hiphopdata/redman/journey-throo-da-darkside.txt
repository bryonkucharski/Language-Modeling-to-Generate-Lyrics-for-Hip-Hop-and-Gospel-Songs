*Explosion* 
 Woo-woo-wowowowooo! 
 Lord hi-gher 
 Could somebody, turn on, da lights 
 Somebody, turn on, da lights 
 *Coughing* 
 The darkside! Yessss... 
 Verse One: Redman 
 Guess who's back when I bring funk like Zapp 
 All aboard motherfuckers! While your brains get jacked 
 I'm souped like two scoops of funk juice, word to mother 
 The way I kick you swear that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker 
 The darkside brings apartheid 
 I act wild like them niggaz from Chi-Town on the Southside 
 Sweeter than this, whoopin niggaz down like Jack Nich 
 When I backflip my tactic graphics 
 Ooh! Redman jams it in 
 Due to difficulties I won't be done by ten 
 Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz 
 And then we get the bam-ba-zee from one-ten 
 Or is it further up? Plus my style murder ducks 
 So what the fuck, you got the mic turned up fo'? 
 When I Chief Rock underground MC's drop like sheet rock 
 Here's a ride to the underground 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 To the beat y'all... 
 Ah to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all 
 I keep the buddha to last me through the week y'all 
 Verse Two: Redman 
 Come take a trip on my cosmic movie boogie flicks 
 Far beyond space so niggaz say your grace 
 It's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar 
 When a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin vapors 
 With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton 
 Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action 
 Black stars or moons eclipse the volume 
 Bang zoom I'm sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom 
 Ridiculously I will pimp an MC 
 To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis 
 I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes 
 Float like the butter, fly so what if I 
 Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin' hinges 
 Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist 
 When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror 
 Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together 
 One for the money and two for my peeps 
 Nynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets 
 For the Squad I lick two shots word to God 
 Then take y'all dreams and imaginations 
 To the darkside
