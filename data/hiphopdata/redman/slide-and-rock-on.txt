Yo, this blunt is for all the niggaz that was in the 
 Holdin' pen with me in central booking 
 Welcome to the system 
 (Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! Motherfuckers! 
 Coming to you live from Newark, New Jersey) 
 (Hey Redman would you roll that blunt and get me fucked up) 
 Fucked up (all night) all night 
 (Hey Redman would you roll that blunt and get me fucked up) 
 Fucked up (all night) all night 
 (Yeah! Coming to you live, straight out of Jersey, motherfucker) 
 Verse One: 
 Rock on, rock on, yo here comes that Funkadelic 
 I come wtter than Purple Rain, I bust brains, the funk Doctor 
 Spock, got the glock, now I'm smokin' out your sess spot 
 I rock from here to Bedstuy, I hit the spot like XY 
 Who is that nigga that's comin' six billion feet 
 I roll my funk and find tone even smoke up blues with 18th Street 
 I cut massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly 
 Look at the letter-coated afro like my man Shaft would be 
 The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food 
 I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood 
 (Jumpin' Jersey) Yeah you heard me, got more family than the Partridge 
 Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner markey 
 You're tryin' me, I'm a menace of society, right 
 (Yo yo they killed your style) Yo yo, I ain't lettin shit ride 
 Droppin' the verbs and nouns, antonyms and homonyms 
 Covering my dick, plus I'm diesel like all of them 
 Chorus: Repeat 2X 
 Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on (somebody, help 
 Meeeeee!) Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
 (You gotta rock on) Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
 Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
 Verse Two: 
 My momma used to tell me turn that shit the fuck off 
 So I had to play like Foxy and get off (get off) 
 My shit was thick I bought a clip then cocked my own grip at honeydips 
 Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeitch 
 Selling bags from uptowwwwn 
 Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down 
 31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken 
 I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open 
 I'm hopin, that they don't go inside my boots 
 'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to thai-one suits 
 And ClienTEL, I'm drinkin' Ballentine L in hell 
 So Redman rock well before our record sell 
 Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous 
 (And if ya ain't come back) Is what the base-head used to tell us 
 (Yo fellaz!) Our whole scheme sinkin like boats 
 Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we shoulda stuck to lactose 
 But every good thing comes to a end 
 With no ends, on the block, sellin weed again 
 My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen 
 Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen 
 Verse Three: 
 Whassup! I tickle your putty-cars with my loonie raps 
 On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts 
 From my city I spread it all like Jiffy 
 It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be 
 I mold like clay, and roll dice just like Andrew 
 I stay strapped just like bamboo, my crewsa got mad handle 
 Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy 
 So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept MC's 
 I keep my car underground just like the Lords 
 Even though I'm known, like all the four wheels on the course 
 So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones 
 Cause my shit be WAY off the hook like pay phonesssah! *dial tone*
