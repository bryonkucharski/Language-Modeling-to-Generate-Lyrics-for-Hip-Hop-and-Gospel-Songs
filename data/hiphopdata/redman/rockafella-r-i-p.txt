(Pop in the disc, and who the hell is this?) 
 Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time 
 For me to design the right lines 
 Make you one of a kind boy rough and tough and all that stuff 
 Sure enough I'll make the brother's change their minds 
 Then you understand my only principle 
 No need to fuck with the born invincible 
 I'm rated X like a porno feature 
 Leaving MC's dazed, and catching anesthesias 
 Even females get rocked when they try to cock 
 Block the man from doing this hip-hop 
 Techniques unique and that's my word is bond 
 Rockafella's the name but the screaming I'll rock on
