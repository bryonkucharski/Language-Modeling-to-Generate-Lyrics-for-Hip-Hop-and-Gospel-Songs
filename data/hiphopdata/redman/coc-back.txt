 Got the smith like emit. I run it back, skip town, hot 16's is the only way I'm 
 Doing a sentence. Sky's the limit think I'm bigger than wall st, Chris Wallace said

 Hip hop hands down, plan down. Clamp down like pliers this man on fire, soughta 
 Like Denzel or Marlo from the wire, the rap rowdy piper, Makhi Phifer, the D.Csniper.
