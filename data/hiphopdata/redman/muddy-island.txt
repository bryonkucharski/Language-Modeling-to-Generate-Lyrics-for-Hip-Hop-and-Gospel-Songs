This is 
 Yolonda reporting from 
 WKYA 
 Radio. 
 We're here live on the 
 Muddy 
 Island where reportedly five girls and their father were eaten alive from these horrific monsters. 
 The cause of it they say is from the 
 Muddy 
 Waters 2 album. 
 There is no official investigation being taken at this time as we are the first and the only ones here. 
 Wait what? 
 Umm, we have classmates here that have traveled by themselves to show their support. 
 Now I don't know if their parents know that they are here or not but we will keep you tuned in. 
 Oh shit, I'm out of here. 
 Everybody run!
