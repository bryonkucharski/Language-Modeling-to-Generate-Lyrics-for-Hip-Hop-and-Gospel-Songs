Yo, crack the Remy Martin 
 For niggas pumpin' weed by the mini-market 
 Bring it when you see me park it 
 I think big like Diddy office 
 I fuck a ho with a baseball cap on, like Mr. Marcus 
 Yeah, my family feud like Richard Dawson 
 The survey said I'm hot in right in your apartment 
 This Brick City, right beside New York 
 Yeah, the streets is watchin' even Mimes wanna talk 
 I run up on a DJ, smack em' on camera 
 Makin' sure I get my wax on like Daniel-san 
 Feel my geniune draft, not filla' 
 I could walk up in a church a start a Mosh Pit up 
 Yeah, I bring the pain 
 11th member of the Wu-Tang, my flow Tiger Style Crane 
 I'm back nigga, ridin' that Gravy Train 
 The rap criminal, my artifact is hard to tame 
 Bitch wanna complain, no use in barkin' 
 'Cause we can go neck-to-neck like Pam and Martin 
 And smoke like a carton of Newports nigga 
 On my New Jersey shit, and New York nigga 
 Check out the nigga flow 
 I knock out the mic like Buster Douglas, bitch leave a nigga broke 
 And Jigga know when I clutch the pen it's fuck them hens, I'm puttin' paragraphs in the figure 4 
 Fuck tryin' to take a pack of protein, 'cause when I brawl Ima' be strapped like four [?] 
 Blow smoke rings in the meetin' 
 If I ain't gettin' half of what I sell you ain't eatin' niether 
 Our leader won't take no shorts, I know betta' 
 This D-O-C, MVP for Vendetta 
 I'm always on point, never skip of slip 
 My bitch stay tryin' to kill me like Mrs. Smith 
 If I carry two cannons, no time to pull out 
 I bust through the side of my jeans like Bruce Banner 
 My dogs do it on camera, and to them 
 I'm Big Brother on my [?] for Gammafide Gamma 
 I ride like a rider should 
 And when a bitch blow Doc she be famous like Monica 
 Hardcore in the blood, get the best in line 
 Put the eye into yo' watch 'cause I'm pressed for time, nigga
