Redman in the building, everything smokey 
 Shades on, got the Ray Bans and the Oakleys 
 Hit the strip club and nobody knows me 
 I start throwing cake around like Steve Aoki 
 Now they approach me, saying I'm vicious 
 But I'm like Shaft coat, I been in the trenches 
 When I do a show, when it's over, bitches 
 And when you do a show, when it's over, crickets 
 Get a quick drill then I'm back on the oven 
 Cooking food for thought, metaphor McNuggets 
 SuperBad bad and y'all McLovin 
 I don't wrestle but even hacksaw Jim Duggets 
 It's flow after flow I keep punchlines 
 Blow after blow, I rock socks with the gold at the toe 
 I don't like to brag but my horsepower 
 What makes Samuel say "Who dat nigga on that nag" 
 Never sell out, remain true to my era 
 Masta Ace letter to the better 
 When Special Ed jumped out the Jetta 
 With Eazy-E hung with Jerry Eller 
 Before OJ said "I'm a killer" 
 I was murderin' cats and they ain't have a clue 
 Even now I turn cats to Chinese food 
 Redman on blast, my piss excellence 
 The bud I got greener than the Grinch 
 Let's get it 
 Roll your blunts and light the bud 
 And keep your gun on you just because 
 Because everybody wanna be rich as fuck 
 But when it's your time, you ain't sayin' much 
 Quiet on the set, what's really hood nigga 
 You ain't riding with a tech, what's really hood nigga 
 Nigga I'm brick city, either die or fuck with me 
 Sign me a check what's really hood
