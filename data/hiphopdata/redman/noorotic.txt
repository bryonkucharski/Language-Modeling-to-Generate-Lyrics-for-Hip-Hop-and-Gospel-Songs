Y'all motherfuckers buckle y'all motherfuckin seatbelts 
 If you need to get high, there's a mask and shit in the overhead compartment 
 I can't tell y'all what the weather's like 'cause my radio's fucked up 
 And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty 
 Don't panic, take one more hit off the oxygen mask 
 Calmly put your hands between your legs 
 And kiss your black ass goodbye! 
 I'm swift like a motherfuckin gift for Christmas 
 When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus 
 My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground 
 Let me be blunt: I like crackin' brews with bitches 
 The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatEVER 
 Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas 
 My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin' 
 I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin' the clappin 
 I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex 
 Blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex 
 Felt like menopause, I make niggaz act like beatches 
 Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin -- with they ass full of stitches 
 Woo! I just don't give a FUCK 
 I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia 
 Travel around my curse universe 
 I'm droppin' 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert 
 Droppin' the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit 
 Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it 
 Abuse niggaz verbally so call Dyfus 
 I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus 
 Noorotic, my style format rocks the project 
 I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic 
 Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your 
 Funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosing 
 Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin? 
 Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen 
 I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder 
 I'm seein a lot of happy copycat rappers actin' like they got asthma 
 They attackin me, they slowin they rhymes down actually 
 They got factories with little dolls named after me 
 But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere 
 Pressed-in, I take advantage of niggaz like I was molesterin 
 Newark New Jersey's what I represent 
 Iiiiiiiyiiiih 
 My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home 
 And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in 
 Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with 
 Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District 
 So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck 
 Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag 
 Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit 
 The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden 
 Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast 
 Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast to your breakfast 
 Voltage, I got funk for days by the buckets 
 PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers 
 Hold hold hold, wait wait wait 
 Let me school this bitch 
 Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this 
 *Sounds of sex* 
 And come back on the mic? 
 I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots 
 On blocks where your punk ass still bustin' off slingshots 
 Talkin' shit about me when I'm drivin' by slowly 
 Sayin' I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me 
 Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back 
 And let your moms give me cornrows on my crack 
 'Cause I'm nasty like that
