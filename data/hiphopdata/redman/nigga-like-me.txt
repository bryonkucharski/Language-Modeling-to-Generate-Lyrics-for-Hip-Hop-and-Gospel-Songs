Check it out 
 Redman [?] twenty two on a car tire 
 Ring bells like Hell's Diner 
 I'm sharp hair made of barbed wire 
 [?] nicotine for your menthol on Crenshaw 
 43rd fresh off the [?] 
 I got connects like SIM cards 
 I know hip-hop is part of my life 
 I love it like it's my wife 
 My credit card that I swipe 
 True Religion's all on my Nikes 
 7:30 train wreck, brain freeze 
 I'm Capo, Marvel, got the Iron Man, Stan Lee 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I can't stop like Diddy Boi when I'm grindin' 
 I hold down Brick City boy and Shaolin 
 These hoes rub they titties boy when I'm driving 
 My boys smoking that loud when we be wild'n 
 Sour diesel, medicate 
 Start a cypher, elevate 
 Fuck the hater, eliminated 
 These angry birds is feather weight 
 Hood down, street smart 
 With a cap 'n' gown, class clown 
 Failed math but graduated from a dime bag to a half a pound 
 90 era is harder 
 Orca out the water 
 'For Wayne started the Carter 
 Before T-Pain did the auto 
 I had lyrics, nigga 
 Drunk as hell, I spit the liquor, Dirk Diggler 
 I kick it off like Monday night 
 Then run it back like Emmit Mister 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that) 
 I can't stop like Diddy Boi when I'm grindin' 
 I hold down Brick City boy and Shaolin 
 These hoes rub they titties boy when I'm driving 
 My boys smoking that loud when we be wild'n 
 Copy that, copy that, copy that 
 WKYA where we support whores, hookers, thots, and [?]
