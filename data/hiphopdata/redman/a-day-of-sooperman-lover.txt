-Look! Up in the sky! 
 -It's a bird... 
 -It's a plane! 
 -Hee hee hee hee, naw! It's Sooperman Lover, baby! 
 -Daddy, Daddy! 
 -Would you please read us a story? 
 -All right, get over here and sit yo big ass down, 
 Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover... 
 Ayo, I was out to lunch and shit 
 Puffin' on a blunt to get my head read (y) 
 Boogie'n to my walkman 
 With an "S" on my chest 
 (Bust a move!) 
 Yes I'm a Superhero, don't forget 
 I smoke mad niggas 
 So to hell with cigarettes 
 But anyway, 
 Let's get back to this skit 
 You know who the fuck I am 
 So git off that ol' bull-SHUCKS 
 Lunchtime was up, (F**K!) 
 Let me jet, Or I'll collect unemployment bucks 
 On the way back, black, 
 I spotted this object, a stray cat 
 Stuck in a tree 
 With a tag that says that: 
 "If found, 
 Please return to this address" 
 (How did you see it)? 
 Nigga! Wit my X-Ray eye set! 
 Like "Pchoooooooww"! 
 I jetted to the closest phone-booth 
 Quick fast, 
 I dipped into my Sooperlover suit... 
 (I can leap, 
 Tall buildings 
 In a single bound...) 
 Booom! 
 Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling! 
 (It's a plane!) 
 Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name 
 I can slam King-Kong 
 And pick up freight trains 
 On a mission, 
 To save this cat/that was wishin' 
 He was in his litter 
 Watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n 
 Relaxin' 
 Feet cocked-up/ just a little 
 With a cod cocktail 
 And a bowl, of tender vittles 
 I snatched, him 
 Took off through the air like a pigeon 
 Quick so he won't start 
 Meowin' and bitchin' 
 The letter in cat's tag address (?) 
 Said THE PROJECTS 
 (Elevator's broke!) 
 So I had to take the back steps 
 (Knock, Knock) 
 The door opened 
 Then my eyes swole 
 From this BADASS DAME (Damn!) 
 Sippin' a quart of "Old Gold" 
 -"Yo, is this your cat?" 
 -"Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?" 
 -"He was stuck in a tree, 
 Around Uptown Manhattan" 
 -"Well how the hell did you save him? 
 Are you Police/Undercover?" 
 -"Naw baby, 
 The "S" on my chest stands for:" 
 Chorus: Sooperman Lover (Yeah!) 
 Baby call him the Sooperman Lover 
 Something wrong... 
 Something wrong, indeed 
 Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed... 
 She was grateful 
 Lookin' for ways to repay me 
 No money, 
 A donut, and some... uhm coffee maybe? 
 Of course 
 What kind of sauce (?) did I take? 
 Make my donut Jelly 
 And my coffee Sanka 
 We sat, 
 Unhooked the cape from the back 
 She felt my arms 
 'Cause my pythons looked stacked 
 "Goddamn, Sooperlover! 
 Yo shit looks thick 
 Tell me, how strong are you 
 With muscles like this? (you bad motherfucker!)" 
 (I'm stronger than a locomotive) 
 I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky 
 She ran to the room 
 And came back with a (?) 
 Negligee, high-heeled shoes, 
 Wit' a blunt in her mouth 
 Ready to roll up, 
 Hey hold up/ she had the dollar fold (ed) up 
 To mix the coke with the smoke 
 Yo, she was no joke 
 She took a sniff, 
 Some got on her top lip 
 That bitch stuck out her tongue 
 And gave her top lip a lick 
 And said: -"Here baby, hit it." 
 -"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it 
 You'd need more than a body 
 To make me wanna hit that shit!" 
 But I'll hit the blunt 
 So she took out her fronts 
 Cracked the philly 
 Opened the bag and laid out the skunk 
 Then I took a long pull 
 It was hype/ outtasite 
 We ran into the bedroom 
 So I cracked my pants for head room 
 Later, tossed the covers 
 And oh, brother! I was wit' it 
 Ready to hit it 
 Asked my dick, "YO, WHASSUP GEE?" 
 "Yo man, shit's thick" 
 Licked her down her belly 
 And kissed her on her back 
 Stuck my hands betewwn the legs 
 And I felt the bozack (!) 
 As big as mine (YO!) 
 This bitch must be craze, 
 So I threw my suit on 
 And I was Swayze... 
 'Cause I'm the:
