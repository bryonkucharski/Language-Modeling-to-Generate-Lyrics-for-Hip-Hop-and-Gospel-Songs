(All you emcees must get dissed 
 Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit) 
 I don't give a fuck nigga, you already know what it is 
 (All you emcees must get dissed 
 Cause only real...) 
 Check it out, yo 
 Like OJ let me take a stab at it 
 Inhale like asthmatics 
 The chiropractor Redman, I'm back at it 
 My sawed off by the bed, it's a craft-matic 
 The size of a Subway sandwich, ask Jared 
 Big foot givin' input 
 Every rhyme like Lisa Ray homie, fuck with it it's a good luck 
 I'm a lieutenant, the new school respect Red Menance 
 My society raised a winner 
 I set any bitch straight to restore order 
 Lift my pimp hand up like "Why I oughta" 
 I don't tolerate the nonsense 
 I tell my bitch be easy like you straight outta Compton 
 South by Southwest out in Austin 
 Tour the place down, Twitter went wild 
 Def Jam raised their eyebrow, we independent now 
 You should've took care of the cash cow 
 Moooove out my way bitch, Captain Courageous 
 Fuck you and your iPod if I ain't in your playlist 
 Bravehearted, I'm Nas in '94 
 You could say I'm your favorite rapper's favorite 
 I'm like Penny on the floor wasted 
 Pump your brakes, divorce me if you can't relate 
 I get brain when I text, I'm typin' LOL 
 Chick on her knees like SMH 
 Get it? Too slow, listen faster cause my time's a factor 
 You freestylin' dnd I ain't asked ya 
 Weak link niggas, Red'll think bigger 
 This flow hit your chick, she cry me a river 
 And you Simba lyin' like you carrying around the iron 
 Like I'm a supervisor and I'm firin' 
 (All you emcees must get dissed 
 Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit) 
 Bars, okay nigga 
 Bars, I got 'em homie 
 Bars, all day nigga 
 Bars, you can count on me 
 I'm like a cat for my life, I got nine of me 
 You think this song done, I got another round on me 
 Bars, okay nigga 
 Bars, I got 'em homie 
 Bars, all day nigga 
 Bars, wait a minute 
 (All you emcees must get dissed 
 Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit) 
 Check it out, yo 
 Yo, I'm a 90s nigga so of course I think my era the best 
 Untouchable, fucker we Eliot Ness 
 Mitchell-N-Ness it's all Jersey 
 Hoes send my while DMs, I feel I'm related to X 
 I don't be up in the trap tryna write raps 
 Just to say I'm in the trap and made it off rap 
 As the world turns, I let my L burn 
 And watch you little fish swim up in my well urn 
 Even gay bitches love me like the L word 
 And bitch niggas get a clip from a spell bird 
 I mean the Mossberg 
 The same thing, my weed got a case of gangrene when it's angry 
 I act like Scarface up in your project hallway 
 Make sure you're all covered by AllState 
 Me and them beats in your ear like Andre 
 And what I think of y'all motherfuckers, strange 
 Fuck y'all, I'm addicted like a menthal 
 I was born from the days of "yes, yes y'all" 
 My boy carrying a tech, rep call 
 So take your bitch ass home, [?] 
 I don't talk a lot, I just rap a lot 
 On this verse, I got tips from a astronaut 
 Check the forensics, we in this 
 I'll end this with Red is the best in the motherfuckin' business
