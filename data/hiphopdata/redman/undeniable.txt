(Redman) 
 Yo, I'm undeniable, I be you niggas hatin' 
 I got your home girl here so I'm renevating 
 My pen game get it on, I'm penetrating 
 And hoes come in all colors, I'm fingerpainting 
 I'm sick of makin' Lincolns, I wanna make a mil 
 I'm 360 but not your label deal 
 I get all my bread, I ain't splittin' a dime 
 I'm too tight like that leather that's fittin' the Fonz 
 I ain't grippin' a nine 
 Boy I'm a motivator, motivatin' the jungle, gettin' that crack gator 
 You irrelevant bater, Gilla House the hardest 
 The vampires of the game, start wearing your garlic 
 I ain't a alcoholic but say damn 
 He took it back to the afro and the Ray Bans 
 It's Gilla House we breaking all the rules 
 And every thing we drop is undeniable 
 (Runt Dog) 
 I'm too grown to bullshit with you broke ass niggas 
 Half on a nickel bag, I smoke ass niggas 
 Forty years old on the block still hustling 
 Head need Rogaine, bed need Just for Men 
 Bitch niggas full of estrogen 
 Dog I'm a boss but I still work hard as a Mexican 
 Grimey as hell, slimey it smells 
 Check my rap sheet, I spent most the 90s in jail 
 Off pills, I feel like George "the Animal" Steele bananas 
 With the blammer get your cantaloupe peeled 
 For the cake I push pies, my block the bakery 
 Boy I put you to work like a temp agency 
 Plus the rhymes you be writing is wack 
 I know white chicks that write shit tighter than that 
 We robbing you for the valuables 
 This the Gilla House grind, undeniable 
 (Ready Roc) 
 Look, let me list a few reasons they call me the beast 
 Cause anytime I see rappers, I think of a feast 
 And I ain't talking chicken shack, I'm thinking [?] 
 So anytime you think of Red, you think of the East Coast 
 No disrespect, I'ma rep for mine 
 And I ain't saying I'm the best but I'm the next in line 
 That's why my nickname ready 'cause I'm stretched for time 
 Nigga lock it down is on the dotted line 
 When I rhyme, it's sort of like a violent crime 
 So if you get caught with my verse, you do a 3 to 9 
 Hard minutes of ass whippin', I'm passed different 
 I play the front like the lead vocals you ad-libbin' 
 See I'm a giant who, more than liable 
 To bring the riot through and turn all beef into lion food 
 Now what I gotta prove, I passed all obstacles 
 So when it comes down to my talent, it's undeniable
