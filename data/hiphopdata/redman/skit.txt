 Thanks Bill 
 This week on NIN, Niggers In Newark 
 We're gonna take you through some glorious weed spots 
 That my camera crew and I had a chance to visit 
 During our stay in Da Bricks 
 Although we suffered minor setback this week 
 When our TV satellite van was stolen 
 We managed to get around best way possible 
 We had chances to see spots like 
 Hawthorne Ave, Hayes Homes, South Orange Ave 
 Avon Ave, 19th Ave, Chancellor and Bergen 
 19th and One-Duke; hey if you look closely right now 
 There's someone about to go for their drugs 
 Or as they would say, stash 
 Hey, hey buddy, you about to sell some drugs?

 Aiyyo man get the fuck out! *blam blam blam*

 This here, is the telephone line 
 Of one of the many top notch weed sellers out of Newark 
 Ladies and gentlemen, what I will try to do 
 Is tap into the line, and hear an actual drug deal in progress 
 Shhh...
