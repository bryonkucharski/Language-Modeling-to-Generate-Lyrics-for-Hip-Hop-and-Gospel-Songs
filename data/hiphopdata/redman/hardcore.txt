Hardcore to make the brothers act fools (4x) 
 (PMD) 
 When I turn a party out, all hands is in the air 
 Some say it's chill, New York throw chairs 
 The punk funk sound to make a sane man flip 
 Girls rush the stage, faggots cold dip 
 Low to avoid the caps and blows 
 By the gangbanners at the B-boy shows 
 Wit the cops trying to control the crowd 
 But they can't, systems crank "So What'cha 
 Saying"'s pumping loud 
 Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan Am 
 Brothers licking off like the son of Sam and 
 The bass continues to thump 
 Some brothers hit the parking lot to go pop trunks 
 Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched 
 Brothers are caught in the cross fire without no 
 Caps 
 And on my way out, I heard a sucker scream and shout 
 "Niggas, Niggas", yeah, cold turn the party out 
 (E Double) 
 Rap combat squares sat and I attack 
 Any crab MC that's down wit the wack 
 And I wreck and if I can not snap a neck 
 Throw a knock, I'll blow and look for a tech 
 I'm terror, new edition to rap era 
 I can't be beat, I'm too sweet plus clever 
 I'm smart, yes, I'm a so called genius 
 I'm equip wit the thinking cap they call 
 ?(Keenison)? 
 Yo, wit that, I can break fool 
 Especially when the posse is thick and got tools 
 Make me feel good 'cause they got steel 
 No blasters or cap guns son, the real deal 
 K-A, microphone wrecker E-D 
 The O, the U, the B, the L to the E 
 Rocking on, word is born, so abandon ship 
 My name is Erick Sermon now want some and I'll flip 
 I'm far from a chump, I'm harcore like Brooklyn 
 Mess wit me and get your manhood token
