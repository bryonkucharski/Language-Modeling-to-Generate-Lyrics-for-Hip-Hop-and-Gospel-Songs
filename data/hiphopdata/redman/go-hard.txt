Ay yo, I hop out the car 
 Women gather 'round like "Oh my God, he's in my iPod" 
 Peace to the god, sayonara bitches 
 There's no second time around like Shalamar 
 Hit the New York bar, high on the broccoli 
 Then hit Queens for a queen like King Jaffe 
 Sixteens I go off like Biz Markie 
 Sixteen rounds, I buck like Milwaukee 
 Come on ride, it sounds like homicide 
 All you marks will know it's the other guys 
 Gettin' fly while rap is in danger 
 Six guns, one man, thirty six chambers 
 Brick city on board like a campaign 
 And we ain't drinkin' 'less Don is the champagne 
 Got flows more looser than your spare change 
 Look dummy, we ain't never in the same lane 
 Either go hard or go home 
 You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome 
 [?] hittin' my phone 
 You know a nigga like me'll go hard 
 I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard 
 I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard 
 Hey, the same chick I tell you you pop lockin' 
 That's the same chick you take to go shopping 
 Young niggas [?] 
 Leave 'em talkin' through the box like Troutman 
 That's why nigga act so hood 
 I roll up looking at you like "what" 
 I can't lie but I like to floss 
 (?) 
 New Eras on, [?] in motion 
 Hot chicks love it how I kick it and coach 'em 
 They'll do whatever, I'm richer than both of 'em 
 Vegas, I may get eleven on a ocean 
 Whoa, can't do it then allow me 
 I show y'all a real cannon, body 
 I yell "Action" no [?] 
 And [?] 
 Yo, how you gonna find another nigga like me 
 Even my inner-like me doesn't like me 
 I'm so cocky wanna mock me 
 But their styles sloppy like als in ta swap meet 
 Your barbershops' gettin' faded 
 Finally the weakest links get eliminated 
 All you young boys that yellin' out "We made it" 
 How you gonna create what I [?] 
 I'm going hard
