You in my lane boy, move over 
 The blunts are bigger, the weed got a new odor 
 Get back to your job fucking up food orders 
 Me, middle finger's up rockin' new Jordans 
 The streets listenin' but I ain't listenin' 
 Unless Puffy make a Biggie album, he live again 
 White people love the flow so they river dance 
 Hoes wanna hate, I skip-skip-skip again 
 What up to Killa Kam boy I'm on that grandaddy 
 So I can look gorillawhen it's starin' at me 
 I talk cocky like Freddie Blassie 
 My backwood residue is like teriyaki 
 She said "Stop, no don't" I said "No, don't stop" 
 Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top 
 I'ma say yes, what the fuck you mean, yo 
 I'm a bad boy tryna get all in your ringtone like 
 Everybody know when you stack your bucks 
 You gotta ride around with your middle fingers up 
 Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go 
 And I'ma go head roll somethin' 
 Now if you're ridin' in your truck with your systems up 
 Blunts rolled and your girl with a big ole butt 
 Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go 
 And I'ma go head smoke somethin' 
 I hustle hard for I try to get a quick meal 
 I throw my hood up like I'm on one wheel 
 I let it go, middle finger in the air when I'm riding in my truck 
 When I see your bitch, done deal 
 That's why I'm going hard like Garnett 
 I say when it's over, until then all net 
 I ain't had a chance to shut down the mall yet 
 Ellis let's get this money, I'm on it 
 I'm jeans and hoodie maybe a little Louis 
 My family got it, think like little Stewie 
 That's why we fly to Miami just to get groupies 
 I said "Mommy, let's make a movie" 
 She said "Stop, no don't" I said "No, don't stop" 
 Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top 
 I'ma say yes, what the fuck you mean, yo 
 I'm a bad boy tryna get all in your ringtone like 
 Everybody know when you stack your bucks 
 You gotta ride around with your middle fingers up 
 Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go 
 And I'ma go head roll somethin' 
 Now if you're ridin' in your truck with your systems up 
 Blunts rolled and your girl with a big ole butt 
 Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go 
 And I'ma go head smoke somethin' 
 Put your middle fingers up in the air 
 Put your middle fingers up in the air
