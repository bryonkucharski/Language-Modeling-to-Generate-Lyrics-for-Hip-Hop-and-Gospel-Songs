Still walkin' down the streets with my hand on my black tec 
 My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts 
 I'm high, when I sag my 2 Black Guys 
 I would be brief but my Karl Kani's didn't dry 
 I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps 
 My smoke bangs like it's freshly picked from the swamps 
 So nigga how you roll a blunt? Aiyyo, how you roll a blunt 
 Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt 
 Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee 
 Then I'll be back for me, I'm Sure, like Al B. 
 Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon 
 Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba 
 Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don 
 Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number 
 Who can get swift with the microphone mist 
 Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D 
 My funk respect it, cosmic injected 
 That cause me to Set It Off just like that club record 
 Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants 
 It's gonna hurt -- no it's not a gat experience 
 The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar 
 And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all 
 There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world 
 That got good herb for all you boys and girls 
 Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
 Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
 I'm packin buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks 
 Hey yo I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat 
 Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked 
 Catch the Local to the A to the buddha to my vocals 
 And I, set the world on fire 
 Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher 
 You swore to God you was mixed in bom-ba-zee 
 The rhymer Bombs Squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee 
 I spend a knot at all the buddha spots 
 From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks 
 I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D 
 That's doin' three pack, now where I get the hash at 
 You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract 
 Past that, I'm rough like McGruff on dust 
 There's a million and one blunt spots in America 
 Yeah I'm tellin' ya 
 Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfuckin air 
 Smoked out with niggaz from North Newark to Montclair 
 I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms 
 'Cause I got soul like James Brown and rock M&M 
 One of the America's Most Blunted 
 Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted 
 Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island 
 Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin 
 I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger 
 But it didn't work, because they Lee nails got longer 
 But the weed is good for when you're mackin 
 And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened 
 I know what happened, I told her, BACK, NICK that motherfucker 
 So check! 
 My stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras 
 Leave you on your back like Godzill did Gamera 
 Props on blocks smokin' the choc and what-nots 
 I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops *needle rips record*
