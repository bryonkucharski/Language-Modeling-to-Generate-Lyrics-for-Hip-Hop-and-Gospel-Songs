(Basically) (24X) 
 Whoo, hah... ohhah, wooooh 
 Aww shit! 
 Hey dudes my interludes more fatter than most niggaz LP's 
 So don't sell me to stale cheese 
 I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama 
 Puffin on ganja, sippin on a, Cherry Bianca 
 My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy 
 Kick more bars than the penile G 
 And let my nine clap loudly 
 Click click, bee-yow, bang, booyaka! 
 What am I do to ya? It's somethin' new to ya 
 Like screwin ya, all over my studi-ah 
 Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties 
 That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips 
 B... otch, unloosen my belt thinkin' to grab the crotch 
 But before you do move my glock before it shoot my cock 
 And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word) 
 And see basically Redman album is no joke (word) 
 And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word) 
 'Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word) 
 I drop a punchline at lunchtime 
 'Cause I'm a Close Encounter of the None Kind 
 With dumb rhymes 
 I battle allay'all at one time 
 So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary 
 In your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh 
 And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you 
 Why you be acting all fly 
 When your monkey-ass work at fast food? 
 And why is it every time that a multiplatinum artist 
 Always use the underground to make a comeback? 
 Is it fair to the hardcore niggaz that rap? 
 That don't give a fuck about the radio 
 Plus the next bitch at that? 
 And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots 
 And black skelly hats? 
 And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs? 
 Think about it 
 Sip on a chocolate thai, and let your brain fall out of focus 
 This is another episode, coming live from the Funkadelic man himself 
 Yeah 
 Ah 
 Huh
