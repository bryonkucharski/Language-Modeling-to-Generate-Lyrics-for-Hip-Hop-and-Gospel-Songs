(Feat. Mellow) 
 Motherfuckin, ladies and gentleman 
 My style's rugged like Timberland 
 When I clock lyric then women give me more love than Wimbledon 
 My style flow local like New Jersey transit 
 And I can't stand it 
 And you'll need Teddy to unjam it when I cram it 
 I'm from N-to-the-E 
 W-A-R-K, Newark NJ got the AK 
 When I wave bitch you better say heey 
 I'm a Kid From the Hall 
 I got big balls to make your pussy walls dribble in my drawers 
 Hey boy this is the way the East coast swing it so bring it 
 Man I told you ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit 
 I keep the chronic patrol on the road 
 In case you're wondering why I keep my izm 
 'Cause I smoked everybody else's shit up 
 My style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka 
 One two checka 
 And I give effects to niggaz with my Black and Decker 
 So check the, manuscript, man you flipped 
 Put it down if you can't handle it 
 Got a B-R-C-G, Blunt Rollers College Graduate 
 I got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get 
 Then next I check how many niggaz that can die from my Tec 
 Cause the N-E-W-A-R-K is where the niggaz robbin and stealin 
 And fuckin' niggaz everyday 
 Now Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the lefthand side 
 Hide the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride 
 So, sliiiide, before I call the medics 
 You can bet bitch you couldn't get fly if you were FedEx 
 Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya 
 Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California 
 Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco 
 I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho 
 My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL 
 Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected 
 I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz 
 And chumps are wondering what two niggaz dropped the funk funk 
 Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees 
 And cause surgery for emergency 
 Cause Reggie Noble's known like burglary 
 I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets 
 Hey, if it take a million niggaz to stop it just like Chuck did 
 'Cause we run around Newark with the nine cock 
 Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block 
 And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter 
 So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Jaffrey center 
 I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines 
 Cops that got the hot glock stocked for when it's playtime 
 I rock around the Robin TWEET TWEET on the calendar 
 Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra 
 I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester 
 'Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of investors 
 So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast 
 'Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justic 
 Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight 
 I'm sooper like my man cat, 'cause I keep my styles jam packed 
 I wrreerawwwowww like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby 
 You could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60 
 I smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up 
 Them bones, them bones, them bones will have you fucked up 
 I blaze blunts with my nigga Mellow, yo say hello 
 (Yo whattup dogg?) 
 Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly 
 Now sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff 
 There wasn't rap when I was pickin' cotton, sayin' massa 
 Y'all y'all whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards 
 Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick 
 Watch out now, I ain't bullshittin 
 I representin the oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-G's from forty-three goddamnit 
 And if you keep on with that dirty mistreatin 
 I'm gonna whoop your ass, till your heart stop beating 
 And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic 
 You find it I'll have to rewind it where minds are blinded 
 Time 4 Sum Aksion so time to find it 
 I smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out 
 That was last album when I was bouncin' on trains like Malcolm 
 I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive 
 That's why I quit my nine to five and got live 
 Because this hip-to-the-hop shit fills my pockets 
 And I'm Audi for ninety-four because I already got my props 
 Hoes, hoes, and more hoes...
