(Feat. Ready Roc and Method Man) 
 "This should be played at high volume 
 Preferably in a residential area" 
 Gilla House niggas! 
 (Reggea adlib) 
 "Want you to know, ya" 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 "Can you understand?" 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 'Round here we blow treez 
 Redman: 
 Hey yo move out, roll in 
 Haters out, hoes in 
 Walk in the club, low brim 
 Hanging out like clothes pins 
 I hustle flow 
 Do my show 
 Attract women 
 Keep that heat and the John Lennon 
 Boy you won't catch me arguin' 
 Brick City, that's right! Hood down, hands up! 
 Red "Lord of the Ring" (clean?), lookin' for that Precious 
 I'm talking weed and women, when the trouble come I'm 'bout it 
 Shit I'd rather get caught with my gun then get caught without it 
 It's Gilla House nigga, you know we here to smoke 
 DJ keep it Kool, Reggie let me UH-HAH clear my throat 
 When I'm in yo' town man', you better act a fool 
 Turn your college dorm to Rodney Dangerfield- Back to School! 
 Ready Roc: 
 'Round here we blow treez (blow treez) 
 Till our nose bleed 
 Started with a quarter then slowly smoked up a O-Z 
 Ready keep it raw like a nigga ordered a whole ki' 
 "Nigga let me hit ya blunt" Nah, you don't know me 
 Gilla! Gilla House and Gotti click 
 Bang like karate flicks 
 Duck when the shotty spit 
 Or land in a pile of shit 
 Known to make you cowards bleed 
 Smokin' on that Sour Dies' 
 That cali weed's 
 So funky we call it cottage cheese 
 I'm in the powered V-12 
 Look at all these females 
 Jockin' me 'cause of all the records that we sell 
 Got them pounds for retail 
 Hit me on my email 
 And drop bombs dot com, yo who need L's? 
 Yo, yo my bud'll do ya 
 Method Man constant drug abuser 
 Occasional boozer 
 And I'm slick as Rick the Ruler 
 I piss in the sewer 
 Underground man, I spits manure 
 Plus make maneuvers 
 With Doc 
 That sixteen shot 
 Ruger 
 Is back on your block 
 Blastin' a shot 
 Like screw ya 
 Fuck everybody that knew ya 
 My dogs are Oogka-Dupa 
 They Bark and they bite 
 I Darken your life 
 Muthafuckas slippin' like wearing Gators Walking on ice 
 This is New Edition, I'm Hot Tonight 
 I spit it right 
 Ya Gots to like 
 Tell Sean Paul I Gots a light 
 One in the head, Stop ya life 
 Huh, my niggas stay on the block 
 Slingin' them rocks 
 Until the Cops (indict?) 
 Ya heard 
 (Hook: Reggae adlib)
