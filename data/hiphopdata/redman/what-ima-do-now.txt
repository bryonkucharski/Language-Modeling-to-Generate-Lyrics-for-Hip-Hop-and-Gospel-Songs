We be kickin' yo' fat funky ass, on WKYA 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 Yo, excuse me muh'fucka, I'm tryin' to get through 
 When Doc loaded, I'm like a stud missile 
 A stud six-two, I'm huntin' down hoes 
 With no drawers on and buttoned down clothes 
 Don't brown nose just join it 
 Ecstasy pills, with Buddha Man signs stamped on it 
 Jam on it, the 'Blair Witch' wouldn't camp on it 
 I block and shine like suntan ointment 
 You do a dance when I layer this clip in 
 Only dude with a bike with air conditionin' 
 Fuck the Feds your door, Red'll kicked in 
 So prepare to wear scuba gear equipment 
 I wet it, my tape underground leakage 
 It hit the air and you'll swear you found Jesus 
 The man who turned out the Summer Jam 
 Not with a mic, I brrr, tuck it in 
 The noise keep the helicopter hoverin' 
 Your boys is dead weight when I muscle in 
 I need a hot girl, a ryde or die chick 
 Mainly a hot chick ridin' Funk Doc dick 
 Smell it, when the odor airs in 
 The gorilla shit, hoes in polar bear skin 
 The chronic stink up the overhead bin 
 When I, yo, Redman struck again 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 Nigga, we go, oops, upside your head 
 Simon says, "Leave you hogtied instead" 
 On the floor with ya shirt like I dyed it red 
 Wild, wild bricks, eighty foot spider legs 
 Doc in, double, oh, learned to drive it 
 I'm, on the roof, guns under the armpit 
 Yellin' out, yo sawed off, hand on the pump 
 And I'll pump a cannon first man that jump 
 I got a punch that'll cut your beard up 
 Doc is like warm when you touch my earmuffs 
 I wild out, throw blows 
 Somethin' about Mary, rode me in a Ford Explorer 
 The pressure at time five remind me 
 That y'all can't eat like it's Ramadan week 
 My mascot was built for kamikaze 
 If it fails, L.O.D. right behind me 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh? 
 What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now 
 (Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy) 
 Can y'all hear me out there? Huh? Puffy 
 Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy 
 Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy 
 Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy 
 I need some weed muh'fucka 
 We need to smoke muh'fucka 
 We need weed muh'fucka 
 We need to smoke muh'fucka 
 Light it, roll it, light it up 
 Say light it, roll it, light it up 
 Say roll it, light it, light it up 
 Say roll it, light it, smoke it up 
 Say roll it, light it, smoke it up 
 Say roll that, light it, smoke it up 
 Say roll it, light it, smoke it up 
 Say roll it, light it, smoke it up 
 Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
