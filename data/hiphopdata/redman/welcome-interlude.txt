 Aiyyo this is Mad Duke callin from Da Bricks 
 I'm on the block with Uncle Quilly and Leroy Sweetdick 
 Gettin' my smoke on, for you onionhead motherfuckers 
 Hi this K-Spark from the Al Parks, dammmn! 
 Welcome to another nineteen ninety-six Funk Doctor Spock tape 
 As we take y'all minds on another journey, through the darkside 
 We uplift you! Def Squad force comin' through with the ruckus 
 Jammin for all knotty-headed peasy motherfuckers, ah 
 And for funky bitches, we got a funky thing for you 
 I said I gets down like that, who am I (Funk Doctor) 
 (As I kiss the sky) 
 I said I gets down like that, who am I (Funk Doctor) 
 (As I kiss the sky) 
 Bomb troll, funkier than Haitian underarms 
 Represent Jersey, the land of firearms 
 Hotwired cars, emptying cigars 
 Afros, mofo's, on knees with momo's 
 It's nasty as I come my shit be douche 
 I used to be the chief instructor for Bruce 
 Choose your weapon -- A FATALITY 
 Line your crew up now -- BABALITY 
 In nineteen ninety-six bitch ass niggaz all in my mix 
 On some rah rah shit, get my rah rah dick! 
 Nuts alert, first sound de alarm on de expert 
 My network, operate sharper than a Gilette works 
 Off the corner style Blinds in Knightening Armor 
 About more Facts of Life than Tudy or Blair Warner 
 Chi-Town where you at (we got your back) 
 D.C. where you at (we got your back) 
 My crew Come Strapped like MC Eiht with nickel plates 
 Gettin' mad Dead Presidents ask Lorenzo Tate 
 Ah, gettin' loot rollin' craps in the yard 
 Can't be scarred by media, SO FUCK THE MEDIA 
 Most MC's are terrible, unbearable 
 Couldn't get stupid if you were sliced cerebral 
 Ah no need to... act like he's shittin 
 Man you're funnier than Ed Griffith, it's Red's kitchen 
 My infrared's missin', damn I'm slippin 
 I'm out of ammo, yo Crossbreed, stick the clip in
