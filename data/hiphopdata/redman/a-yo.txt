Check it out, yo 
 I be like "yiggy yes y'all", Doctor on call 
 I'll rock till my name in graffiti on the wall 
 Got flow like the rappers in Great George 
 Got weed? (I got blunt) My name Jamal 
 I pause, flick the ash from my L 
 I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell 
 The emcee is me, host for the night 
 Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic 
 I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct 
 Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque 
 I love trucks but drop-tops is the best 
 From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex - watch me 
 Haha, she like "Red so cool" 
 Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu 
 Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes 
 Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it! 
 Hop in my truck and roll up the window 
 A-yo, you know what you in for 
 Once we turn the corner, light up the endo 
 A-yo, a-yo, a-yo 
 Yes she with me getting low like a limbo 
 Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough 
 Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk 
 A-yo, a-yo, a-yo 
 Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall? 
 Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog 
 Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all 
 I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws 
 That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin' floor 
 With ten per cent method, only plug something poor 
 And still I keep it funky like four plus one more 
 Get this money like "In God We Trust", trust your boy 
 It's a given, living this life it was written 
 Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing 
 Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition 
 Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and 
 Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde 
 If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride 
 Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine 
 And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime 
 Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great 
 Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases 
 I network on MySpace real late 
 Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates 
 Around my crib, look how I live 
 I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz 
 Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm 
 "So aaaaaa-ma-zing" 
 Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end 
 Another heist, another kite in the state pen 
 My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind 
 New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men 
 I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work 
 I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt 
 My aim one since day one stop 
 How many shots will it take to make son drop? 
 Hey!
