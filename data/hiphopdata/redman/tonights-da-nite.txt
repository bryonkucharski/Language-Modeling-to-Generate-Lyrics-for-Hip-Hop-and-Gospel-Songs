Who wanna have a motherfuckin orgy? 
 Word is bond, word is me 
 Smokin' mad blunts, and all the fronts and 
 Check it out, whatcha want and 
 Go on with slang, well get to bang, rockin' my thang 
 Funkadelic, hit you with irrelevant, hey 
 Micraphone check, I walk around the street with black tecs and knapsacks 
 I'm known for smokin' ass-cracks till I get ass flashbacks 
 So all my niggaz if you're fuckin' damage let me hear ya you can 
 *Bo bo bo bo bo bo bo* now did you catch a victim? hell no 
 Come back in to fatten to funky tracks 
 Blast a motherfucker until you're peekin through his back 
 Cause my brain is twisted, funky realistic on the ill shit 
 I rock it till, bitches start givin' up that punany 
 Pajamies, up the coochie, pass the clit, pass the loose shit 
 Then boo-yaa, I gave you another shot of the good shit 
 Don't believe me why your pussy breathin hard enough to pinch 
 The clitoris, dangle it from my cock I don't feel shit 
 So check me the original joe pesky freak the sexy 
 I got more gadgets than the inspector, go-go jet-skis 
 Then swoop through your troops knock the boots on your cutes 
 Grab you for your loot, wrap my fuckin' chain around your tooth 
 Cause, that's the way it goes when tonight's da night 
 The music feelin' funkadelic and the mood is right 
 I stick the nine between your eyes and blast you outta sight 
 Cause that's the way the knotty-headed nigga, rollin' right 
 Blunts by the boxes, I smuggle the chocolate thai to get me high when 
 I ran through more niggaz, than any kid that was adopted 
 Plus an ostrich couldn't swallow my cock, quick 'cause it's stopped which 
 Makes the soopaman luva get stockings by the flocks bitch, hrrrah 
 So on and on and let me kick the rab 
 That light skinned brother with mad shaft up your fuckin' ass 
 You wanna see me get cool, the original rude bwoy, fuck with the new toys 
 Like pistols, I dismiss crews, so order some new boys 
 Blast the funky buddha's lockin ash up in my body 
 For fozzy patsi I bring sad days to niggaz constant... 
 ...Ly! freak funkadelic phrases 'cause I'm true school 
 I'm fuckin' madonna down to smurfette down one down to m'bufu 
 Funks formatic, the fat shit, the wicked basket from caskets 
 Plus I'm rollin' blunts with niggaz ashes 
 Smoke on the choke, light a toke until it's proper 
 I deserve an oscar for pullin glocks out niggaz mouths 'cause 
 I kill like that, plus I roll like that 
 I'm that guy with cerebral-palsy even bo knows that 
 But fuck that, we drop the new runner to get some ganja 
 Goin' uptown, we check benny red out, he pulls the smack out 
 Then roll up the bills-nilz, or better yet the pute 
 The loo-pay, rank near my nost to rock the block 
 Hittin niggaz upside the head with rocks in socks, glock on cock 
 Back, trigger-hap, p p p rockin' that unity 
 Motherfucker! yeah yeah motherfuckers, it's on it's on it's on 
 Throw your hands in the air, and wave 'em like you just don't care 
 And if you haven't been fucked, by the soopaman luva 
 Let me hear you say, oh yeahhyeah! 
 Oh yeahhyeah! funkadelic, hit you with the irrelevant 
 Facts and max, and on and on my crew pull gats 
 Flick slaps 'em back, come on and fuckin' up tracks 
 Kick the mad wicked, bricks to stick it 
 Come on and, I get wilson like pickett then stick it 
 She wanna check me when I'm lickin' your ass 
 And lickin' ya down to your clitoris 
 Do you remember this, bitch, I know you're kinda hearin this 
 Style that I'm kickin, yes I'm mad wicked 
 Funkadelic, runs the mad train up your anus! 
 Baby, 'cause I'm famous! 
 Nope, I didn't mean that 
 The mean fat black fat tracks and old dreams at 
 I'm all teen strapped, sports a bean hat 
 Want to rhyme to be down, but homey ain't gonna bean that
