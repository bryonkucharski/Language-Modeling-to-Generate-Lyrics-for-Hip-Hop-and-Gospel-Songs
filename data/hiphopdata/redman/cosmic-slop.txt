(Feat. Erick Sermon and Keith Murray) 
 Intro: Keith Murray 
 Yeah, bout to fly that knot 
 Redman, Keith Murray, Erick Sermon with the, Cosmic Slop 
 And we all pack glocks 
 Word is Bond, word is bond 
 Fuck around and get shot 
 Verse One: E Double 
 As I flip, skip to the beat, on wax, and tax 
 I react with tons of macs, a ball, and some jumping jacks 
 Flyin expert, puttin' in work 
 No question, cosmic funk and weed session 
 Like GangStarr, step up, it's Hard to Earn 
 But I change up the mode, and blow up the globe 
 The bandit, spittin' dialect umm (UMMM) 
 Catchin wreck umm (UMMM) 
 One two micraphone check (UMMM) 
 Attention passenger's we're on a non-central journey 
 To Hell and beyond 
 Funkadelic drop the bomb! 
 Verse Two: Redman 
 Boo-yaa! 
 I'm that type of nigga to give it to ya 
 My Cosmic Slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers 
 My flow freeze the Nile, The Funk Child splits the river 
 Then I crush, like the bom-ba-zee was rushed, through my verbal lust 
 I'm spaced out, I LOST MY MIND ON CLOUD 19 
 VISINE FOR EYES, when I blow Alpines 
 Dial 9, 0-0, For the hero of the weirdos 
 I hope my brain don't bust 
 Transform into a 7-11 Slurpie Slush 
 IT'S THE FLY, My music will burn eyes 
 Twice the chemical of Clorox 
 Then I do an autopse on four cops 
 When my jaws drop, ock, I fidget my nuts alot 
 Got the two glocks, with oowops then bodies trace the chalk 
 I'm like an eclipse on a Friday, the 13th 
 With black cats and Haley's Comet, blazin' blunts in my driveway 
 Nostradamus predicted, for you funk fiends 
 That Def Squad will get the fuckin' cream like Noxem... geyeah 
 For those that remember pics and afros (it's on like that) 
 Platform shoes and bell-bottoms some got em 
 Spaced out, way out, is what I'm talkin' about 
 In the Cosmic Slop of the Ghetto 
 Zuzuzuzuzu, zuzuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu 
 Zu zuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu 
 Verse Three: Keith Murray 
 With amazing manifestations, I dictate to nations 
 More Cosmic Funk innovations in my creation 
 This Cosmic sick mic cylcicyst 
 Mega segments, be Sega, like Genesis 
 I orbits the solar system, listenin 
 Guzzlin, never sippin, or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin 
 I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin 
 Man listen, I give your whole crew a ass drenchin 
 Just for mentionin, goin' that route, runnin' yo mouth 
 You get your head smacked off towards down South 
 And your crew too will be spaced out 
 Way out, no doubt, y'all niggaz need to stop 
 And get with this Cosmic Slop 
 (Cosmic Slop, Cosmic Slop) 
 And now, we program, we program 
 Pop in the disk and who the hell is this?
