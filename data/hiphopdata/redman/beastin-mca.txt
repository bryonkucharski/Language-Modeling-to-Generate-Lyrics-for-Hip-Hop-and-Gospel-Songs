Yo, Redman got the blunts, let's get it in 
 That's why these women's asses jiggling 
 I'm like a pornstar fuckin' in my Timbalands 
 Sex drugs and money bitch get your membership 
 Watch how I [?] bro 
 Watchin' Rambo in a Lambo 
 They say a nigga hot, can't put him out 
 Smoke weed in the club, let's put him out 
 I got women gimme head on the e-pill 
 And I'm like "There you go" like Johnny Gill 
 Behind the wheel is even better 
 And if it gets warm, take off your hot sweater 
 I see your tits through it anyway baby 
 The boomin' system got 'em jingling baby 
 They said I couldn't do it but I fooled 'em all 
 Had to play Tony Danza like "Who's the boss?" 
 I'm in Jamaica mile high with a mai tai 
 Good fella with the hoes, yeah I'm a wise guy 
 That's why I act a fool 
 And I'm cool, I take these youngins back to school 
 Like yeah, I got bad women ridin' with me like yeah 
 They got their own money and they hit me like yeah 
 They buy their own car and they ridin' like yeah 
 I told 'em give me something, they was with it like yeah 
 Yeah [?] nigga like he putting in work 
 Work hard to play hard, watch how I flirt 
 Streets'll love you but they'll want you in the dirt 
 That's why I grab on my... 
 Yo, got the Ciroc and pineapple, pour it in 
 Got it flowing like the levee in New Orleans 
 Out the club to my car, ladies all in 
 Going up in iHop in the morning 
 Women love Red, they doing cartwheels 
 Even got red bottoms on their high heels 
 Your boy heavyweight, get the picture 
 Seven point zero I scale on the richter 
 Hit the gym, get a little work out 
 Grab the mic, put a little work out 
 Nwknj 
 Real hip-hop here, no DJ hittin' the replay 
 Look at that boy, he showing off 
 Go tell Biz Markie I'm goin' off 
 Radio playing that bullshit 
 So I resurrect Guru then give him a full clip 
 Give him another one then another one 
 Jersey got bank, I'ma double 'em 
 This kind of rhyme you won't find in a Target or Walmart in aisle nine 
 I be lying if I ain't saying I ain't one of the best 
 Is your career over nigga, guess what 
 Like yeah, I got bad women ridin' with me like yeah 
 They got their own money and they hit me like yeah 
 They buy their own car and they ridin' like yeah 
 I told 'em give me something, they was with it like yeah 
 Yeah [?] nigga like he putting in work 
 Work hard to play hard, watch how I flirt 
 Streets'll love you but they'll want you in the dirt 
 That's why I grab on my...
