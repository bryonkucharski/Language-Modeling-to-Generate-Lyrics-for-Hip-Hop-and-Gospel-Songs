Switch... 
 (Dr. Trevis) 
 Hahahahahahaaaa! 
 Come with us 
 Come take the elevator shift six billion feet beneath 
 Where the Def Squad dwells 
 Where your dreams and imaginations is only 
 Loose change in a motherfucker's pockets 
 This is Dr. trevis coming to you live from WFDS 
 We're From the DarkSide radio 
 Niggaz, better get your flashlights 
 'Cause it's pitchblack! 
 (Redman) 
 I travel the Milky Ways, and the stars of the Gods 
 Then return six billion feet beneath to get cigars 
 My lyrical format sounds off like gun claps 
 Underground, where you need flashlights and hard hats 
 My mind is ten levels deeper than Jacob's Ladder 
 Batter the paragraph, after your gall bladder will shatter 
 Nyphomaniac on track when I Flex like Funkmaster 
 Flex you can bet I'm not playing with a full deck! 
 I go far beyond acting hard and pullin triggers 
 I just wanna die and come back as the Nile on the river 
 Zone until I figured, how to wake up in the morning 
 And the corners of my mouth be like foamin when I'm open 
 Y'all neighborhood roughnecks, I cause a threat 
 My silhouette, who pack smacks niggaz just like Treach 
 Comin' through comin' through, put your hands on your handfun 
 'Cause I'm crazy off that chronic from my man grandson 
 I shoot to kill, puff blunts in Hooterville 
 I be murderin MC's from up here to Urbantown 
 I sweat dark, when I get off my shit ock 
 Yoyoyo that's that's E and them! 
 Yo word up? Yo what's going on? 
 Yo chill chill chill chill 
 *Car squeels, bullets fire and ricochet* 
 *Tires squeel and car crashes*
