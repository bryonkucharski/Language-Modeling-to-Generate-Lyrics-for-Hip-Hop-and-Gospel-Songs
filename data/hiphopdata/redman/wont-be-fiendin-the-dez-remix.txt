 This is WKYA 
 Funky [?] is on the mike right now 
 We taking all callers that been to the West coast 
 That smoked that West coast bomb out there 
 Call us up: 1-800-MONEY11 that's 1-800-MONEY11 
 We are WKYA 
 (Redman) 
 When you need that bomb, holla, bud lava 
 Shit to lift you up, Impala, roll that Obama 
 Redman stick like commas 
 Did I smoke the club out? 
 Yeah, your honor 
 Three strikes, my lawyer won't budge 
 Me doing time? I'm a cannabis judge 
 What up quick? When we flash the cannon 
 I clear static like rapping near antennas 
 Bananas, ape shit, bomb 
 Triggered the White House alarm 
 From inside the bracelet 
 Wordplay, it's like Thursday 
 'Cause Friday you get paid and your pockets thirsty 
 Chicks barefooted, they love to do 
 They know I can't wait on them for new shoes 
 Unless they in two, erotic nuns 
 Brainiacs raising they college funds 
 (Redman) 
 And the highs may come and go 
 But the weed gon' stay around 
 As long as I keep a blunt (long as I keep a blunt) 
 Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin') 
 WKAY nigga 
 And the bitches may come and go 
 But the weed gon' stay around 
 As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!) 
 Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin') 
 (Redman) 
 Yo, I'm Muhammad Ali with the mike 
 With a little Ike, Turner 
 Roll with Tina, my burner 
 International earner 
 Plug in anywhere I'm a 
 Worldwide converter 
 Massive to the masses 
 Take a class on longevity 
 I'll play you the track list 
 Each song like a seminar 
 So you get your snap back 
 Like epsom vinegar 
 Trunk shit, to break your neck to 
 Redman to the rescue 
 My attitude, soul food, a little bipolar 
 Boy, I'm a test tube of Dr. Jekyll 
 That's why niggas me'll last 
 Strut through the hood 
 Where you need a pass 
 I'm doing 140 on the needle dash 
 And my car, hub, like the Martin cast, nigga 
 (Redman) 
 (And as long as I keep a blunt, won't be fiendin') 
 We taking all callers that been to the west coast 
 That smoked that West coast bomb 
 (And as long as I keep a blunt, won't be fiendin') 
 Yeah, call us up 
 WKYA 
 (Redman) 
 And the bitches may come and go 
 But the weed gon' stay around 
 As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!) 
 Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin') 
 And the bitches may come and go 
 But the weed gon' stay around 
 As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!) 
 Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin')
