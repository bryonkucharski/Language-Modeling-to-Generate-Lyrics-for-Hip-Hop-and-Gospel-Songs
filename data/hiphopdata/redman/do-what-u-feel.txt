Featuring Method Man 
 Intro: Redman 
 Hahahahahaaa 
 Follow... just do what ya feel and I'ma follow 
 I'ma follow... 
 Just do what ya feel and we gon follow 
 Just do what ya feel and I'ma follow (2X) 
 Haha Meth Tical 
 Verse One: Method Man Redman 
 Who want to flip with the acrobatic 
 From ground zero all the way to attic what we be smokin' Tical 
 The reservoir is now open 
 I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style 
 We hold court and blow trial 
 You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now 
 Man's down, hands down 
 Foreground by your side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart 
 To my fucking heart 
 Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word 
 Time Time 4 Sum Aksion 
 Dreamin' bout Toni Braxton, blowin' her back out like Bob Baglin 
 I'm throwin' wrestling holds 
 Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot 
 If it don't hip it don't hop 
 If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life 
 I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through 
 That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule 
 Better move with a set of tools 
 I be doin' it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual 
 I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters 
 When I slaughter don't get caught in the water 
 Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order 
 Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her 
 Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease 
 Did more drugs than pharmacies 
 So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare 
 Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities 
 Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority 
 Of niggaz lookin' hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority 
 And when my nigga Meth shine 
 Out the inner How High mobile rollin' three dimes at a time 
 [Erick Sermon] Redman and Method Man still... 
 (Hiiiigh hiiiiiiiiigh) 
 It's that Jersey representer 
 Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter 
 Word... 
 Just do what ya feel and I'ma follow (3X) 
 Funk Doc break it down 
 Verse Two: Redman, Method Man 
 Yo, suck my dick out of animosity 
 The velocity will fly that head and freeze your camps like pottery 
 To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies 
 And shunt your million dollar investment, to economy 
 Impossibly might be the one in black leather 
 Name tag sayin' 'caution when wet by the track wetter' 
 The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit 
 Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her 
 Three years for carrying a loaded handgun 
 But it's forever when a nigga [chik-chik BLAAAOW] and he lands one 
 To your cranium 
 That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian 
 (Yo watch you say to him!) 
 You caught up in a tight situation 
 I should start erasin your whole organization for makin' 
 Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement 
 You couldn't come close if I gave you my bookin agent 
 Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger 
 Even a crowd to get you souped up, you're still wack 
 I peel caps, on the regular 
 Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator 
 Fuck you, your label moms and your editor 
 Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin 
 All on my shirt, the king of the flirt shittin 
 Bitches hit me off more than New Edition 
 (Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet) 
 I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique 
 So Iron Lung [born to wonder] 
 Get on the mic and break 'em off a sumthin sumthin 
 We moonshine and grow crops 
 Purchasin the handhelds with the sure shots, it got me spittin' 
 These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions 
 You-A-P ain't got no weapon, you lip professin 
 Next in, line, parental discretion advised 
 These explicit, street linguistics 
 Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin 
 I might know but ain't tellin', too bad you missed it 
 Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid 
 Color-safe bleach so I don't fade 
 Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp 
 Get yo' bandaids hold that 
 Like E said, Get the Bozack, show them wack niggaz where the do's at 
 On the case like I'm Kojak 
 Kissin' the grits on that Flo bitch, flip scripts take LOOONG shits 
 Raider Ruckus 
 One, I come with premeditated redrum 
 Gingivitis to your filthy ass gums 
 Bottom line either get down or get done 
 Motherfucker.
