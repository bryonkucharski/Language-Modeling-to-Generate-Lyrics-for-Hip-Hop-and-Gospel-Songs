* See the remix for the full Korean verse + translation 
 Ah! Look out, it's the Funkadelic Funk for chumps 
 Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks 
 I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip 
 I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik 
 The topnotch of the block, 'cause I carry a glock 
 Only hot rocks I'm hot, so give up the props 
 My style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up 
 Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture' 
 So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her 
 The Soopafly, Jimmy fly Snooka rips the roof off 
 Then hook off on your crew, to the check of one to two 
 It's you, who? (AGA-Ah! WWAAAAAH!) Redman with the Kung-Fu 
 Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck 
 Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette 
 But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids 
 Yo E (Whassup G?) Briiiiiidge!
