Money on my mind, Doc on the grind 
 I ain't on Billboard tryin' to climb 
 Killa on set, don't press rewind 
 I'm like the thirty-something year old Lebron 
 Boy I'm fucked up, way past tipsy 
 Smoke on my lung, Tequila on my kidney 
 Grown man but I land on the water 
 So move back before you get caught in the rotor 
 I'm like a G4 to your General Motors 
 Y'all take orders, Red in like Otis 
 Y'all game novice, Doc's a pro 
 I'm a boss like I married Diana Ross 
 Roll through the hood like, Fuck Da Security! 
 Walk in the club like, Fuck Da Security! 
 Smoke on my blunt like, Fuck Da Security! 
 If you not the hood type, You Need Security! 
 Now when I do a show 
 I rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo' 
 (Fuck Da Security) 
 Because I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd 
 Security like "fuck you yo!" 
 (Fuck Da Security) 
 That's how I roll, fuck da security 
 Their everywhere, look can't even urinate 
 I'm the last nigga that get intimidated 
 Don't get it? Then let me reiterate 
 Boy I'm hustla, throw one of them knuckles up 
 Walk in the restaurant, hand on your juggler 
 Ride in that BM better buckle up 
 Back game crumbling, bricks gon' double up 
 I tee off hoes, look how my putter up 
 Old folks say I cut her off lil sum sum 
 Only one champion and you're the runner up 
 Coo coo for cocoa puffs, watch when I perch him up 
 D O C, guzzlin' Hennessy 
 Fuck the club nigga and fuck security 
 Now when I do a show 
 I rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo' 
 (Fuck Da Security) 
 Because I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd 
 Security like "fuck you yo!" 
 (Fuck Da Security)
