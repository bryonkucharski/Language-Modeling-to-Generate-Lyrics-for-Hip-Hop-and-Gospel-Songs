Fuck outside, I'm gettin' outside 
 Fuck outside, I'm gettin' outside 
 Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride 
 My family be stoned like sly 
 Boy I don't jive, my trib gon' kick it 
 Syrup in the cup, no I ain't gon' sip it 
 Money over hoes but hoes want money 
 Better ask Bow-Wow for the lottery ticket 
 Drop my top when the sky get yellow 
 So like Pacquiao, I'm waiting for Mayweather 
 All my dogs tougher than leather 
 I fell like I hit my lil kid's inhaler 
 Franklin, Benjamins, cakes, Entamenns 
 Thirsty like Howell trappin' with Gilligan 
 Never could mimick him, I'm grade A 
 I'm battin' with bonds in my DNA, nigga 
 Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside 
 Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside 
 Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride 
 My family be stoned like sly 
 I'm so high, the chicks gon' love it 
 We so fly, the chicks gon' love it 
 Pull up to the club, I bring no luggage 
 'Cause when I leave here, I plan on fuckin' 
 Boy, I'm a winner, boy I'm a sinner 
 Got an intena on the TV dinner 
 Strip club, I got my money on Linda 
 One dollar bill pill like Gold member 
 I'll make it rain, it's a hurricane already 
 True to the game like Terry 
 Third degree burns, the house on fire 
 Hustlin, compare me to Jerry MaGuire 
 Roll that shit, light that shit 
 Then mac on the seem Skyped that shit 
 As soon as she smoke, I'ma pipe that bitch 
 Then put it in her bun like you like that shit 
 Women give me love and rappers get X 
 Hood status, I got stripes like the ref 
 Write the check and connect like nine X 
 When you do, add three more digits to the left 
 I'm like Jeter how I rock that speaker 
 Internet junkies are Wifi-ing ether 
 Look at me bro, I'm a leader 
 But I feel like the fat boys tryna get in the beaver 
 Bitches on E and my homies on percs 
 Horses on the car and a horse on the shirt 
 For now on I'ma be dirty like Mcgirt 
 So I bumrush the courts cause [?] 
 Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside 
 Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside 
 Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride 
 My family be stoned like sly 
 I'm so high, the chicks gon' love it 
 We so fly, the chicks gon' love it 
 Pull up to the club, I bring no luggage 
 'Cause when I leave here, I plan on fuckin' 
 Now I'm inside and I'm feelin' alright 
 And I'ma show people how to party all night 
 Smoke some of that, take one of those 
 Drink till the bartender yellin' "I'm closed" 
 Now I'm inside and I'm feelin' alright 
 And I'ma show people how to party all night 
 Smoke some of that, take one of those 
 Drink till the bartender yellin' "I'm closed"
