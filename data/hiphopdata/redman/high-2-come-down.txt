Yo, I just smoked me some purple 
 Now I'm waiting for my high to come down 
 This girl popped her some Bam-Bam 
 Now she waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down 
 We just waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down, come down 
 Got a zip-lock of that [?] in the backwood 
 Boy I'm up all night, I'm Dracula hustling my racks up 
 Red and Homie smoke more than Cheech and Chong homie, yeah nigga, that's us 
 When I'm out on the West Coast, my little niggas say "Yo, relax 'cause" 
 Rolling up that green crack, that grandaddy, and XO 
 Got a dancer that love my baby so I'ma leave her with strip throat 
 I'm a asshole on the mic, I think I was born as a test tube 
 Y'all fucking with Red, well here's two alphabets, FU 
 I just smoked me some purple 
 Now I'm waiting for my high to come down 
 This girl popped her some Bam-Bam 
 Now she waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down 
 We just waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down, come down 
 Yo, I smoke weed and I sold albums 
 Fuck with me, you got more problems 
 Pound of sour gettin' rolled up on my bus, that's a real low rider 
 Smoked blunt with Waka Flocka, rolled a L with Jack [?] 
 Colorado gettin' dabbed and all that bud, I'ma need tupperware 
 Brick City where I'm born at, California got the OG 
 Bay Area [?] 
 And on the West everybody knows me 
 Smoked a blunt with my boy Kurupt 
 [Illadelph] where the loud, homie? 
 You know how the East Coast gettin' down 
 I ain't talkin' weed when the pound on me 
 I just smoked me some purple 
 Now I'm waiting for my high to come down 
 This girl popped her some Bam-Bam 
 Now she waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down 
 We just waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down, come down 
 She just rolled us some purple 
 Now she's waiting for her high to come down 
 She popper her 
 Now she's waiting for her high to come down 
 Come down, come down 
 She's waiting for her high to come down
