Yeah yeah 
 Who it is Son? 
 It's the rap scholar here to make a dollar 
 Try an' follow guaranteed to make ya holler 
 Check it out, everybody everybody 
 Aiyyo my dogs hold heat control the whole street 
 And when it's time to bust they don't get cold feet 
 You know it's me cause some say the boat rocker 
 Big Mac not the Whopper peace to Big Poppa 
 The Showstopper, like Salt-N-Pepa, rhyme wrecka 
 Friggidy-front on this, I won't letcha 
 I better catch ya, stiggidy-straight out the blue 
 Diggidy Das EFX, Redman, comin' through 
 We biggidy bubblin, like some bubb-ly, love-ly 
 But what, trouble be, findin me, kid he cover me 
 I, represent my ground, so yo what up now? 
 Non-believers hatin' what the fuck now? 
 Bucktown kid, you can get struck down for that shit 
 The mack spit, accurate, make your back split 
 Sewer rats get a lotta, cheese like Ricotta 
 The three man team, the rap scholars 
 New York, everybody; Cali, everybody, c'mon 
 D.C., everybody; overseas, everybody, c'mon 
 Aiyyo, it's the rap scholar, hot around the collar 
 Pack a blaka-blaka, since I was a toddler 
 Drama, the nine-seven nigga Madonna 
 Reptile texture be the blood of an iguana 
 Sick, dick about nine inch thick 
 I make a fo'-twenty Benz-o look like a six 
 First of the month I got the bundles for the wick 
 My hands big as a catcher's mitt when I brick 
 Sucker MC's who did not learn 
 If you don't this time, from coast to coast I'm 
 The Dark Ranger, call me Don Punanna 
 So hot, my chewing gum flavor's enchiladas 
 You can tell, I don't give a fuck 
 Deliver the cold to the place that shiver the erictor 
 Fuck you and the ship you came on 
 While you sit around bitchin I get my bangs on 
 East coast, everybody; West coast, everybody, c'mon 
 Up North, everybody; down South, everybody, c'mon 
 Biggidy-Bingo, bangle, bust how the slang go 
 Change up the angle, now who want to tangle? 
 Click-clack, get back, Dunn let me rip that 
 Spit that, flip that, shit to push your wig back 
 You showboatin, get your whole frame broken 
 Found floatin, somewhere in Hoboken 
 No jokin, jump out the Benz bubble 
 Pull out the pound and bust a round in your huddle 
 Spent a lot of ghetto days learnin ghetto ways; learn the ins 
 And outs of ghetto trades still searchin for a better way 
 Niggidy-never stress it though, keep it come and go 
 Trust me if it's runnin' low, my mic still the gunner yo 
 Facin towards what's mine, so throw your hands in the air 
 Cause of the rhyme, auto-nine, up against your spine 
 Blow your spot up, cause yo I gotta, get this Ricotta 
 The three man team, the rap scholars 
 New York, everybody; Cali, everybody, c'mon 
 D.C., everybody; overseas, everybody, c'mon
