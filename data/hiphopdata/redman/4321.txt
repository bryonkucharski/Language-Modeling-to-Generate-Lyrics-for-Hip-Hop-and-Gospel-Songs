 [Redman] hah [method] hah 
 [Method] yeah [redman] yeah 
 [Ll cool j] make it butter 
 [Redman] I'm gonna bankhead bounce! 
 [Ll cool j] no doubt 
 [Redman] aiyyo watch yo mouth! 
 [Redman] aiyyo, one two three four five six seven 
 Blaze the hot 
 [Ll cool j] trizack that sound like heaven 
 Seven six five four three two one 
 My mon meth-tical come and get some 
 (Method man) 
 Playin' my position, hot nixon 
 This one, for all the sick ones, confliction 
 Posionous darts sickening, best believe 
 Finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin' 
 On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets 
 Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways 
 Gotta love me, g-o-d no one above me 
 Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw 
 From my punch, watch your son and you 
 Got you shittin in your last huggie, runnin' who? 
 Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through 
 A single shot make your knees knock, respect wu 
 (Redman) 
 Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga 
 Turnin' christian to a certified sinner 
 The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes) 
 While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe 
 Shit I kept low, petro' your metro 
 Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin 
 Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen 
 Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee 
 Kick ass till both timberlands turn shitty 
 Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see 
 When I approach rappers be takin' notes 
 I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat 
 Absolut, I love to burn to the roots 
 I keep comin' till your pour sperm from your boots 
 Vigilante hardcore to the penis 
 Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it 
 I snatch your crown witcha head still attatched to it 
 Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics 
 Beatin' niggaz to death and beatin' dead niggaz to life 
 When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts 
 If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff 
 Like, "yo, how many rhymes you got? " I think I'll go on 
 For more millenniums than mazda's got on the car lot 
 And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya 
 Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number 
 Who wanna see canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and 
 Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile 
 I take 'em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on 
 Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on 
 Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred 
 When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it 
 (Dmx) 
 Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down 
 Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down 
 When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that 
 See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that 
 Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions? 
 Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson 
 I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live 
 Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give 
 Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you 
 Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you 
 And when the lights is out, they don't come back on 
 This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong 
 You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby 
 You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby 
 So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet? 
 Want heat? one deep, leave him behind, front seat 
 [Redman] aiyyo, one [meth] two [red] three [meth] four 
 [Red] five [meth] six [red] seven 
 Blaze the hot trizack 
 [Method] shine like heaven 
 Seven [red] six [meth] five [red] four 
 [Meth] three [red] two [meth] one 
 [Redman] come on mr. smith, come get some! 
 (Ll cool j) 
 When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows 
 Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up) 
 The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers 
 You hold the rusty swords I swing the excalibur 
 How dare you step up in my dimension 
 Your little ass should be somewher cryin on detention 
 Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue 
 I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun 
 Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces 
 With one thesis ("ll cool j is hard") 
 Every little boy wanna pick up the mic 
 And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype 
 But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with mike 
 Swingin' at ken griffey or challengin roy to a fight 
 Snappin, you ameteur MC's 
 Don't you know I'm like the dream team tourin overseas 
 For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease 
 Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees (uh) 
 In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence 
 Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up) 
 Now let's get back to this mic on my arm 
 If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb 
 You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize 
 And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize 
 And I'm daring every MC in the game 
 To play yourself out position, and mention my name 
 I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name 
 Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train 
 Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line 
 Ll cool j nigga, greatest of all time
