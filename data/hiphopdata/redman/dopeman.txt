 Hey mister Dopeman you're a star 
 I like your gold chain and your fancy car, I said 
 Hey mister Dopeman you're a star

 (Redman) 
 I said "Dopeman Dopeman" that's who I am 
 I got lyrics by the pounds and I sell 'em for grams 
 I don't sell crack or sell coke bitch I'm a star 
 The lyrics I sell is dope 10 thousand a bar 
 You can wrap me in saran make sure that I'm fresh 
 Put a stamp on your product right there on my chest 
 My transporter KRS-One let's chop it up 
 Cause this product killer nigga get you a tux 
 I got crack baby rap fans after the drug 
 The more they buy chi-ching the bigger my check stub 
 Call me Mr. Pusherman it's dope in your ears 
 More money I can cut it get DJ Premier 
 You can fly me overseas and the dogs won't smell 
 London and Paris (oooow) - "you got mail"! 
 I'm the American Gangster I carry the weight 
 And when the Feds watching homie I put more on the plate 
 Let's Go!

 It's like every hood waiting for my music to buy 
 And when I'm done ears ringing like package arrived! 
 Women strung out they copping 2 for 5 
 They get a half a metaphor and a piece of a punchline! 
 Now I'm off to Canada I'm high in demand 
 My passport not working - try it again! 
 I got drug dealers waiting like 5 in a van 
 They unloading my shit getting high from their hands 
 It's the raw, uncut Eddie Delirious 
 The underground recognize, In Red We Trust 
 Even your neighborhood saying "Red you're tough" 
 Little kids idolizein' when I pull up! 
 You can call a hot-line Reggie ready for work 
 1-800-FuckWitANigga; this New Jerz 
 I'll take your credit, debit or Amex card 
 To cop the gold chain nigga and fancy car!
