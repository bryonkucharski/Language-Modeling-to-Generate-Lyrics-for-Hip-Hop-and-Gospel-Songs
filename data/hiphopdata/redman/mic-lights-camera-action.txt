Uh! You know 
 It's times like this 
 When we need change nigga 
 Yeah, and if you really look at it 
 Your life is like a movie 
 And we all in the script playin' a role 
 Let's go! 
 Mic bright, lights, camera, action [4X] 
 "You are, now, playing, a rapper" - ACTION 
 Yo, I speak clearly, for y'all to hear me 
 Rotate while I show the world like Mary 
 Sleepin' rarely, too much beast for the Aries 
 Gilla! Get cream like, Ben and Jerry's 
 Too fly to mail me, C.O.D. 
 Opened up my mind and let my ego free 
 Now the world know my government, and I'm lovin' it 
 All levels, from White House to the covenant 
 Big boy, when the mics and the lights on 
 You get a three minute glimpse of the icon 
 Your best rapper two-steppin to my song 
 When he don't know, he ask I write for him 
 Jersey lights, that's where I live 
 Where I get lost like one of Kennedy kids 
 Then I reappear when it's "Time 4 Aksion" 
 Then disappear again like LaToya Jackson, it's 
 Mic bright, lights, camera, action [4X] 
 "You must, now, protect, the President" - ACTION 
 Yo, by any means I protect my President 
 It's P.O.P., protect our president 
 A thoroughbred on the track like the meadowlands 
 The Secret Service should bring the ghetto in 
 For example, I start up a dot com 
 For terrorism, a P.O.P. hotline 
 Join the club if you're ready to rub 
 Elbows with folks who feel oh-nine is our time 
 That's the motto, yeah I know Bush 
 Made bein President one tough act to follow 
 Watch the Lewinskis that just wanna swallow 
 Remember Kobe Bryant up in Colorado 
 Lock me in asylum, your boy too ill with it 
 Your life is campaign and that's real bid'ness 
 Set up shop and group your team 
 'Cause they ain't doin' what they did to Martin Luther King 
 F'real! 
 Mic bright, lights, camera, action [4X] 
 "You will, now, save, hip-hop" - ACTION 
 Yo, they said hip-hop been gone for a minute 
 I gotta find hip-hop and tour more with it 
 That's my cash cow, wow, go hard 
 Like the ninth inning, tryin' to score for the pennant 
 Sky's not the limit, I'm on a quest 
 To bring back originality, style and concept 
 Show you how to write 16's with context 
 Mix it with a little Lil Wayne and KRS 
 That's fresh! Dummy, study the art 
 Study how it all began and see the part 
 Study how Kool Herc became King of Bronx 
 Learn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks 
 I think I found hip-hop dawg, she right here 
 Listen up homey it might help your career 
 I'm goin' to the top 'cause I'm ready for action 
 Then disappear again like LaToya jackson, it's 
 Mic bright, lights, camera, action [4X]
