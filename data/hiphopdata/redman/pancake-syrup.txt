Im on that pancake and that syrup too 
 I'm ridin' slow with them haters in my rear view 
 My check here too 
 My pockets real fat 
 Two hundred fifty grand, yeah I'm a quarterback 
 I got them bud and the blunts 
 Lets pie one 
 I got them pancakes purple and hawaiian punch 
 Come on and have lunch 
 And letch your hair down 
 Lets move like the six million dollar manow 
 I said I'm rollin' through the hood 
 Lookin' real fly 
 Everything slow when my car ride by 
 I'm on that pancake and syrup 
 I'm on that pancake and syrup 
 I said I'm rollin' through the hood 
 Lookin' real fly 
 Slow motion girl when my car ride by 
 I'm on that pancake and syrup 
 I'm on that pancake and syrup 
 I love gettin' high you can call me an addict 
 Cause that pancake and syrup I just gotta have it 
 And I know a lot of people don't know what I mean 
 That's when you pop a pill then wash it down with some lean 
 You got it nigga 
 Now its chow time 
 Next destination headed to cloud nine 
 And I never let a hater try to blow my high 
 So believe what I'm sayin' maaa 
 I said I'm rollin' through the hood 
 Lookin' real fly 
 Everything slow when my car ride by 
 I'm on that pancake and syrup
