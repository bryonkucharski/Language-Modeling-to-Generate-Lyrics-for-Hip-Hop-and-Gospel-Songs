Lets go! 
 Make her say oh my every time I ride by 
 She like the way the jet black cadillac shine 
 (Ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3 
 Yeah yo I hop out my ride I'm lookin' fly 
 Come ride the pony but I'm nuttin like genuine 
 When benitime was is style I was bendin dimes 
 Now I'm tryna smoke with Obama at the pentagon 
 Baby it's been a time and I don't eat beef 
 I know y'all niggas smell pussy 
 But it ain't me 
 Y'all should rate me 12 on the richter 
 Disapear like chappelle on his sista 
 Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine 
 (Ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3 
 Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the candy apple cadillac shine 
 (Ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3 
 Haha yeah yo I hop out my benz 
 I got my cash on 
 I'm on that kutch like ashton have some 
 When I was young it was time for some action 
 Now I'm grown an primetime (what's hapnun?) 
 Haha look atcha you on fire 
 Your toes got the sky hornier than Quagmire 
 28 on tha tire 
 Say hi to ya paper 
 Wave by to them haterz 
 See 'em later 
 Make 'em say!Oh My! 
 Chorus: make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine 
 (Ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3 
 Ha yeah I pull up to ya 
 Like what's up with ya 
 You see the cadillac girl lets cuddle up 
 I feel great 
 Baby dontchu life is like chess 
 Don't make the wrong 
 Haha but if you do 
 Don't worry 'bout it 
 Il be there like the jacksons 
 Don't worry 'bout it 
 I told my hood 
 I was gonna do it 
 Now I'm around the world reppin new wark 
 Chorus: make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine (ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3 
 Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the candy apple cadillac shine (ma-make her say) 3 (oh my) 3
