New shoes with the blue suede 
 Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede 
 Young graves get the bouquets 
 Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this 
 Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us 
 Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers 
 Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers 
 Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now 
 Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over 
 Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless 
 Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless 
 Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless 
 Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome 
 Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit 
 5-0 fucking with the yayo too 
 L-B-P-D get sprayed on too 
 Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof 
 Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy 
 Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios 
 New shoes with the blue suede 
 Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede 
 Young graves get the bouquets 
 Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that 
 Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac 
 Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's 
 Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife 
 Finna party like it's prom tonight 
 Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his mom's tonight 
 Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal 
 Best deal that the judge finna offer: life 
 Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison 
 And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin' 
 Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side 
 Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry 
 That's life, three strikes, that's life 
 Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night 
 Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches 
 Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden 
 Nigga, fuck that 
 New shoes with the blue suede 
 Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede 
 Young graves get the bouquets 
 Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 Hope I outlive them red roses 
 All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em 
 All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em 
 All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em 
 All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em 
 Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em 
 Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em
