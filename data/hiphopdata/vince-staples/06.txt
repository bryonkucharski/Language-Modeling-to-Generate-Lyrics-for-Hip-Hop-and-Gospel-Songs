Next time on Poppy Street 
 Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night 
 I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes 
 Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right 
 What you want? What you like? Your world been mine 
 There's niggas gettin' paid over there 
 And niggas got it made over there 
 I'm finna bring the gang in the buil-
