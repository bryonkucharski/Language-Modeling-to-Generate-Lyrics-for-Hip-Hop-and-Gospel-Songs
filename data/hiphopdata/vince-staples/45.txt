All the time, all the time, all time 
 All the time, all the time, all time 
 Aight, you ready? 
 What do you believe in? Die to have respect 
 I believe that the world got black neglect 
 Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks 
 Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet 
 County blues, counting days till you get set free 
 Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P 
 Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets 
 Caught a case 'cause he wouldn't catch a fade 
 Living pedal to the metal 'cause he couldn't catch a break 
 Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way 
 I'm still waiting for the day that we black and we proud 
 Till then we'll be shooting niggas down to the ground 
 Sing it loud 
 All the time, all the time, all time (all the time) 
 All the time, all the time, all time, boy 
 45 sitting side when I ride 
 If I ride for it, then I'll die for it 
 All the time, all the time, all time (all the time) 
 All the time, all the time, all time, boy 
 45 sitting side when I ride 
 If I ride for it, then I'll die for it 
 Fuck the world shit lately, black 380 
 Ready for wherever God gon' take me 
 On my momma I been out here since a young nigga 
 World tours and prison letters in my bunk, shit this life ain't yours 
 See, we fighting a chore rather, kill a nigga quick 
 Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit 
 Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate 
 Now they love to see me rattle sitting in that cage 
 'Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith 
 I was born with a heart that the streets can't break 
 Never poured one shot, never rolled one J 
 'Cause I don't need that Shawty, point me to that bank 
 I ain't never had no money, nigga 
 Young and bummy so I had to be the funny nigga 
 Got a gun, started wilding like a dummy, nigga 
 I don't care about no murder just another nigga 
 Pull the fucking trigger 
 All the time, all the time, all time (all the time) 
 All the time, all the time, all time, boy 
 45 sitting side when I ride 
 If I ride for it, then I'll die for it
