This could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, maybe 
 Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow? 
 Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone? 
 I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby 
 Open up your eyes and tell me whatcha thinkin' 
 Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein' 
 Inside of me, why we fussin', fuckin' up this evenin' 
 I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason 
 Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end 
 Is it love? I would really love to know the meanin' 
 What's the grudge that you're holdin'? 
 Hold my hand let me take you to the land 
 Where the ocean and the sands are meetin' 
 Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom 
 Open up your heart, if we don't love then we fall apart 
 This could be forever, baby, I never seen you wetter, baby 
 Than when the tears fall soakin' up your sweater, baby 
 I didn't mean harm, don't make me regret it, baby 
 'Cause if I never knew ya, I could never do this to ya 
 Hope you understand, they never taught me how to be a man 
 Only how to be a shooter, I only need the time to prove it 
 'Cause this could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, baby 
 This could be forever, maybe 
 Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow? 
 Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone? 
 I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby 
 My teachers told me we was slaves 
 My mama told me we was kings 
 I don't know who to listen to 
 I guess we somewhere in between 
 My feelings told me love is real 
 But feelings known to get you killed 
 I feel as if I'm misconstrued 
 I spend my moments missin' you 
 I'm searchin' for atonement, do I blame my darker tone? 
 I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone 
 Pick up the phone, don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world
