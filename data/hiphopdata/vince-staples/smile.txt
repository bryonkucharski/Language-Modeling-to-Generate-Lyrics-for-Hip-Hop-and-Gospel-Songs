How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day 
 Sometimes I feel all alone 
 Sometimes I can't get away 
 I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay 
 So can you do me a favor, smile for me? 
 I know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know 
 I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go 
 I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen 
 I know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege 
 I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo' 
 I made enough to know Ill never make enough for my soul 
 I turned my back on my friends 
 I turned my back on my home 
 I left the street where I've grown 
 To chase the yellow brick road 
 I heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it 
 Just like me 
 But that's all right because my soul burning please set me free 
 I hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me 
 Can't you see? 
 Every night up on my knees I pray 
 Smile for me 
 That everything will change and be okay 
 Smile for me 
 Maybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away 
 Smile for me 
 I'm holding on to what the pastor say 
 Smile for me 
 Smile for me 
 Smile for me 
 Smile for me 
 Smile for me 
 'Cause when life gets hard 
 And you just think 
 You wanna end it all 
 Smile for me 
 When life gets hard 
 And you can't breathe 
 You wanna end it all 
 Smile for me 
 Smile for me 
 How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day 
 Sometimes I feel all alone 
 Sometimes I can't get away 
 I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray 
 So could you do me a favor, smile for me? 
 I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up 
 Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched 
 People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up 
 How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Don't say you feel my pain 'cause I don't even feel myself 
 Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame 
 Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up
