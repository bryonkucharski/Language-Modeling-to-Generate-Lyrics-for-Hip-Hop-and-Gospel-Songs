I'm in that 745 
 Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45 
 Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride? 
 Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"

 All my life man I want fast cars, NASCARs 
 All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss 
 All my life I want waves at my front door 
 No green grass, no porch 
 I just want sea shores 
 All my life 
 All my life pretty women done told me lies 
 All my life pretty women done told me lies 
 All my life pretty women done told me lies 
 Told me lies, told me lies

 Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

 Eyes can't hide your hate for me 
 Maybe you was made for the Maybelline 
 Spent so much tryna park the car 
 Barely got a tip for the maître d' 
 You head straight to the oyster bar 
 I tread light each time we speak 
 Play too rough might break ya heart 
 And them glass shoes ain't made to walk 
 These lonely streets 
 Unpaved, unscathed 
 Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet 
 Said that you was comin' through after dark 
 To look at the stars and hardly speak 
 This thing called love real hard for me 
 This thing called love is a God to me 
 And we all just God's property 
 So feel free to fulfill the prophecy 
 Adam, Eve 
 Apple trees 
 Watch out for the snakes baby 
 Open streets 
 Ocean breeze 
 We should get away, baby
