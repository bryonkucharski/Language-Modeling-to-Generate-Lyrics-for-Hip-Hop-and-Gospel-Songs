Get paid 
 Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip 
 I been robbin' since a kid gettin' paid 
 Dollars for the rent, get change for the chains 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Get paid 
 Tomorrow never come 
 I'm on the block all night 'til the sun 
 Come up, I can sleep when I'm done 
 Four deep, five seats, three guns 
 Hopped out nigga, where you from? 
 Long clip, gun aimed, don't run 
 On Crip I need your funds 
 The money gettin' low, finna run up in the store 
 Freaky bitches tryna ho, I'ma put 'em on the stroll 
 Niggas snitchin' on the low, never talkin' on the phone (Hello?) 
 That's why them niggas screamin' Free Big Meech 
 Not me, nigga fuck police 
 Split a pig nigga wig for the boy, SD 
 Money motivated in the LBC, come and holla at me 
 Get paid 
 Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip 
 I been robbin' since a kid gettin' paid 
 Dollars for the rent, get changed for the change 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Get paid 
 Lemme tell you what the OGs told us 
 Money over bitches, keep your head on your shoulders 
 Pussy leave a lot of niggas dead if you notice 
 Big booty cuties be the coldest cobras 
 Sittin' in the lawn of the fortress, coolin' 
 Baby wardrobe, all award show, bougie 
 Think you could hit that, nigga you stupid 
 Better getcho racks up 'fore you start choosin' 
 Rag on my face, hat on me say Yankees 
 Safe in the floor, K to ya dome, pay me 
 Watch where you go flossin' them gold daytons 
 Come to the norf, my niggas gon' caine 'em 
 Sellin' cocaine with my daddy out the Days Inn 
 Nothin' but a G thang, dollars in the G string 
 Long as she gon' make it, she gon' shake it 
 Money puttin' niggas in the Matrix, face it 
 Get paid 
 Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip 
 I been robbin' since a kid gettin' paid 
 Dollars for the rent, get changed for the change 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Ay, get paid, get paid 
 Get paid 
 Sellin' pussy on the stroll 
 Sellin' highs for the low 
 Runnin' in somebody home 
 Money is the means of control
