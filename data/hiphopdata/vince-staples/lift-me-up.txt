Hey, I'm just a nigga until I fill my pockets 
 And then I'm Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin' 
 I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters 
 So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference? 
 My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin' on blue-waters 
 Was fadin' up in Davis, then walkin' back to Palmer 
 A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers 
 So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference? 
 I feel like "Fuck Versace", they rapin' nigga's pockets 
 And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit 
 A prophet just like Moses, if Moses look like Shaka 
 Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aimin' at Nirvana 
 My bitch look like Madonna, they starin' at katana 
 Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should have brought the chopper 
 Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer 
 But he lookin' at me crazy when we pull up to the projects 
 See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up 
 And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up 
 I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe? 
 Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 We love our neighborhood, so all my brothers bang the hood 
 I never vote for presidents, the presidents that change the hood 
 Is dead and green, was standin' on this mezzanine in Paris, France 
 Finna spaz 'cause most my homies never finna get this chance 
 All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em where my niggas at? 
 Goin' crazy, got me goin' crazy, I can't get wit' that 
 Wonder if they know, I know they won't go where we kick it at 
 Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killin', kickin' doors 
 Fight between my conscience, and the skin that's on my body 
 Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari 
 Man, I breathe in, bleed this, Poppy Street I shot them guns 'cause talk is cheap 
 Bow your head and pray, okay, now walk wit' me 
 See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up 
 And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up 
 I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe? 
 Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up 
 (Lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me lift me up)
