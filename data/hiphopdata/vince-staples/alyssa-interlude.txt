Sometimes you have to get all the 
 All the crap out the way before you hit the good stuff and you're like "OK, I'm getting good stuff now" 
 But, um, uh, I had a b- I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about? 
 I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy- uh, my ex-boyfriend, George 
 Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start 
 You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong 
 And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like... 
 And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love 
 You know what I mean? We were together, so- 
 When it- and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it- when it didn't come together, I was just like... 
 You know? It really hurt 
 But I needed enough distance from it 
 So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore 
 But not enough distance that I'd forget 
 I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess 
 I guess if you give me some material... 
 Raindrops on my windowsill 
 Longing for your nature's feel 
 Loved that song when we were kids 
 Now it makes me want you here 
 Sometimes, people disappear 
 Think that was my biggest fear 
 I should have protected you 
 Sometimes, I wish it would rain 
 Sunshine, blue skies 
 Please go away 
 Sometimes, I wish it would rain 
 The girl has found another and 
 Gone away 
 With her went my future 
 My life is filled with gloom 
 So day after day 
 I stay locked up in my room 
 I know to you
