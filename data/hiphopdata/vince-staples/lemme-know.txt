Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin' 
 Be my lover, be my lady 
 Other people drive me crazy 
 Really got me thinkin', about ya body 
 I know it was your birthday 
 I know I didn't call right away 
 I know it hurt you in the worst way 
 I know that I would trade it all if you stay 
 I know I'm not perfect 
 I know that everybody ain't 
 But if it's one thing I know that I know, I know nothing at all 
 You don't pick up when I call 
 I'll make it up by tomorrow 
 You know that love is a brawl 
 So I'll be fighting for ya, I'll be fighting for ya 
 Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin' 
 Be my lover, be my lady 
 Other people drive me crazy 
 Really got me thinkin', about ya body 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Can I hit it in the morning? Can I hit it in the night? 
 And if I told you that I love you would you know it was a lie 
 Pretty woman, how you function with the devil in your thighs? 
 I see heaven in your eyes, I love to see you cry 
 The drugs inside your mind got you thinking different 
 Why you hiding from me? Fuck your inhibitions 
 Why you crazy lover? Think that you should be my baby mother 
 Let me slow it down, think I'm kinda tripping 
 Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin' 
 Be my lover, be my lady 
 Other people drive me crazy 
 Really got me thinkin', about ya body 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Ass fat, can I take it out them jeans? Lemme know 
 Church bells sing, wedding rings, Lemme know 
 Baby girl I'm ready, whatchu' ready for? Lemme know 
 Fuck the fuss and fighting, we should let it go, lemme know 
 Feeling like I need you, I need for you to lemme know 
 Nothing come between us, I need for you to lemme know 
 Everybody looking for that special soul, is it you? 
 If you think it's true, need you to lemme know 
 Baby lemme know, if you feelin' right, you can spend the night 
 We can go, anywhere you like, nothing got a price 
 I suppose, that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it 
 Fo' sho, we can keep it on the low and take a load off 
 Soon as you walk up in the room, take ya clothes off 
 Bed to the floor, baby you know how it go 
 Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it 
 Consummating for a long time till the condom breakin' 
 Conversations in my head about some head, you got some commentary for a nigga? 
 I ain't tryna be too forward with ya, lookin' forward to ya 
 Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with ya 
 Do it all to get ya 
 So just lemme know 
 Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin' 
 Be my lover, be my lady 
 Other people drive me crazy 
 Really got me thinkin', about ya body 
 I'mma let you know, that I got that dough 
 But if you take a toke 
 You gon' be runnin' round tripping till you get your hands on more, yeah 
 You gotta be certain 'cause 'fore you consider fucking me 
 'Cause you hit this shit once I know you gon' be in love with me
