 Is your house big? Is your car nice? 
 Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night? 
 Is you well paid? Are your shows packed? 
 If your song played, would they know that? 
 How the thug life? How the love life? 
 How the workload? Is your buzz right? 
 Do the trap jump? Is the plug right? 
 Got your head right? Boy, yeah right 
 Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right 
 (Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right) 
 Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

 Pretty woman wanna slit her wrist 
 Pretty woman wanna be a rich man's bitch 
 Pretty women want a couple kids 
 Pretty women want a new ass, new lips 
 Pretty women wanna push a Benz 
 Come correct and she won't let you in 
 Thumbin' through a check, she gets it in 
 Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend? 
 Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

 Got an enemy that changes dependin' what direction 
 You're facin' 
 Got an enemy that tells you what block and what division 
 You're placed in 
 You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle 
 You're chasin' 
 Keep pretendin', make it real until every cell replaced, erased 
 Pop till it's fakin' 
 Pop till the wrist pop 
 Pop till he shakin' 
 Pop like four on the floor been in rotation 
 No allegation 
 Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation 
 New York nigga be like "deadass" 
 L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies" 
 I was off the porch like Fed-Ex 
 211, got bread on me 
 K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist 
 Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp 
 Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them 
 Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym 
 Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty 
 Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early 
 Fade like shadows, corrallin' the cattle 
 A bitches decision for you, is narrow 
 Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh 
 The physic, the chemist, the lame 
 Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange 
 Compatible for riches with more to gain 
 A sad nigga? Yeah right 
 I don't fair fight but I bear fight 
 Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight 
 Hangin' though my last four kills for the highlights 
 My life, hi life, high five, bye, bye 
 Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
