I load the 44 
 Then paint the Van Gogh 
 She rang the front door 
 She came commando 
 She came and rambled 
 I came and rolled over 
 No time for conversations cold shoulders 
 Outta my mind 
 She outta red wine 
 She woozy bitch bourgeois straight from Dubai 
 She love the hip hop and love my slick talk 
 Give head then begged the boy to crip walk 
 I write the James Joyce 
 Don't need the Rolls Royce 
 I need a straight jacket finna go bat shit 
 Sick of these rapper stealing my swagger 
 Tryna run with the penmanship practiced 
 Gangsta gone Gatsby 
 Fades with no lotion 
 Get this shit cracking 
 Crack his jaw open 
 Crack in my system 
 Daddy loved smoking 
 Like he loved smoking niggas no joking 
 Everybody get a little bit crazy 
 Seems like you've been feeling that lately 
 Everybody gets a little bit lonely 
 Keep breathing slowly slowly 
 Right place at the wrong time 
 Wrong turn in my own mind 
 Right place at the wrong time 
 Got lost in my own mind 
 It's okay, hey Vince, it's me 
 Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need 
 Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck 
 Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up 
 Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K? 
 Mama whooped that ass for 3 days 
 Parties at McDonald's for our birthday 
 It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say 
 Lemme tell ya 'bout, when a nigga went crazy 
 At the Marriott, having Kurt Cobain dreams 
 Lemme tell ya bout, when a nigga went loco 
 Ace hotel shoulda stayed at the Soho 
 Housekeeping keep knocking on my door though 
 Don't she know I'm staring in the mirror with a 44 
 Tryna get my head straight 
 She tryna get the bed straight 
 No room to think 
 Kaboom on the sink 
 Uh me tienes harta 
 (Pinche baboso abre los ojos) 
 Quien te cres eh? El muy chingon? 
 (Date cuenta de lo que tienes) 
 Tu no eres nadien 
 (Ya no eres niño) 
 Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal, eres un estupido no sabes nada 
 (You're a grown ass mutherfuckin' man) 
 Nadie te toma enserio 
 (I fuckin' hate you, just leave me the fuck alone) 
 Sabes que, vete a la chingada me caes gordo 
 (Pinche puto desgraciado) 
 Pinche vato pendejo 
 (I fuckin' hate you) 
 Everybody get a little bit crazy 
 Seems like you've been feeling that lately 
 Everybody gets a little bit lonely 
 Keep breathing slowly slowly 
 Right place at the wrong time 
 Wrong turn in my own mind 
 Right place at the wrong time 
 Got lost in my own mind 
 It's okay, hey Vince, it's me 
 Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need 
 Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck 
 Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up 
 Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K? 
 Mama whooped that ass for 3 days 
 Parties at McDonald's for our birthday 
 It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say 
 In the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming 
 Out the window 
 Tints low baby come and see 'em where the rent low 
 Been gone I don't need a shrink I need a hit song tryna show the world a nigga 
 Tweaking 
 Been a schizo crip though off of 65th though 
 Anybody killer I ain't aiming when the shit blow 
 Jumping through your window finna hit a lick mode 
 Thugging since the flip phone don't be who I flip on 
 We all waste away, what are you looking for? 
 We all waste away, what do you got in store? 
 We all waste away, 'cause I can't take much more 
 We all waste away, rather be lost and poor 
 What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe 
 What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free 
 Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve 
 Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep 
 "But you a star," they say, "You mean so much to me 
 Mean so much to me"
