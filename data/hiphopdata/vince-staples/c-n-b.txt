Oh no, oh no 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing 
 Look in the mirror like, "God damn," I know they wanna be him 
 I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking 
 So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 So watch the shit that you say, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 So watch the shit that you say 
 Okay 
 On 65 I tell the truth, no lies 
 (I tell the truth no lies) 
 The sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties 
 (They turn to suits and ties) 
 In Black America, can you survive? 
 (How well do you survive?) 
 They made a nuisance once the noose is tied 
 (Soon as the noose was tied) 
 We gentrified, we victimized, we fighting for survival 
 (Survival) 
 No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leanin' on the bible 
 They preyin' on us, prayin' for a better day tomorrow 
 Hide the fear behind this here bravado 
 (Oh) 
 I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing 
 Look in the mirror like, "God damn," I know they wanna be him 
 I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking 
 So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 So watch the shit that you say, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)

 We black skinheads for real, was bred to kill 
 (Was born and bred to kill) 
 Been leavin' niggas hangin', what you sayin'? 
 (What are you saying) 
 Don't shake my hand unless you're passin' payment 
 (Passing my payment) 
 Keep your salutations, need my forty acres 
 (Why why why) 
 Why they hate us? Why they want to rape us for our culture? 
 They greet, defeat us, bleed us, then they leave us for the vultures 
 They break the brilliant off with millions, tryna to break their focus 
 More tan the man, the more alone and hopeless 
 I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing 
 Look in the mirror like, "God damn" I know they wanna be him 
 I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking 
 So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay) 
 So watch the shit that you say, okay? 
 (Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
