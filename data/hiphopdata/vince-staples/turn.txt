Woke up walking on water 
 Ditching my alma mater 
 Made a lot of mistakes from mimicking ways of my father 
 Father can you forgive me? Sinning since I remember 
 Back when grandaddy died, that was a cold December 
 They closed his casket while my motherfuckin hope was in it 
 Soon as you come out the womb they hanging rope for niggas 
 Groomed for the stone and the tomb, going for broke and shit 
 We've been that, push shit back, the Devil coaching niggas 
 Telling 'em to shoot, like a title on the line 
 When it's judgment time I doubt that God can look me in my eyes 
 'Fore He send me down to Hell 'cause I'mma ask a Nigga Why? 
 Never played it by the book because the Book was full of lies 
 And the preacher full of shit, and the teacher full of shit 
 Used to boo me from the bleachers that I'm never gon' forget 
 Eating $5 Little Caesar's pizzas on the WIC 
 'Cause my daddy left my momma for the motherfucking pen 
 But when it come down to it, know I'm out here shooting 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 Yeah that's all a nigga got 
 When it come down to it know the basehead use it 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 Yeah that's all a nigga got 
 Find me posted on the block, 'cause it's all a nigga got 
 Couple hundred in the knot, 'cause it's all a nigga got 
 Still running from the cops 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 'Cause that's all a nigga got 
 Our Father who art in heaven 
 Seen my momma dying every day since grade 11 
 You see her age is catching up to all them years of stressing 
 Tears is falling and her son too far away to catch 'em 
 Hard to call and when she call she gotta leave a message 
 'Cause a nigga working 
 And I'm working so she worry free, guess I defeat the purpose 
 Medication cost a arm and leg, hardly even worth it 
 Doctor tripping so it got a nigga feeling John Q, wild 
 Round sitting in the gun, duck duck goose style 
 Pressure building up, nigga, what you gonna do now? 
 Brother kid too now, 12 years in the pen 
 Seen life end 'fore this shit begin 
 Sing it then 
 But when it come down to it, know I'm out here shooting 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 Yeah that's all a nigga got 
 When it come down to it know the basehead use it 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 Yeah that's all a nigga got 
 Find me posted on the block, 'cause it's all a nigga got 
 Couple hundred in the knot, 'cause it's all a nigga got 
 Still running from the cops 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 'Cause it's all a nigga got 
 'Cause that's all a nigga got 
 One for the fucking money 
 Two for the fucking show 
 .357 on me, loaded ready to go 
 I know my bitches love me 
 Know my enemies don't 
 My momma know I'm shady 
 I'm granny bastard baby 
 Look in the mirror like this is what you made me 
 I'm going crazy please somebody save me 
 Jesus way too far gone for him to reach me 
 To reach me
