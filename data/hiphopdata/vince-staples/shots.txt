Niggas die off of Poppy street 
 Bet my mama vouch, they drive by 
 We don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out 
 On my grind, Benz color of the crimes I've been committing 
 I've been fighting all my life and I ain't stopping 'til it's finished 
 Rapid fire power sound just like a helicopter engine 
 Hell ain't threatening to niggas who ain't never had religion 
 In this field you Phillis Wheatleys ain't gon' never catch me slippin' 
 Serve that brick piece, now we sneaky, sell 'til the man come and get 'em 
 Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war 
 They sending threats, we sending shots 
 They sending threats, we sending shots 
 Fuck the pigs alive and dead 'cause they ain't never had my back 
 See you black, 'fore you a man, and you a nigga 'fore you that 
 And that you'll never understand if you done seen it second hand 
 You ain't ready for that war then please don't step across them tracks 
 Rent money low and pressure high, no sellin O's just selling dimes 
 These California sunny skies done looked down on me all of my life 
 Is you really bout' what you write? Know they waitin' on my demise 
 And I been waiting too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky 
 Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war 
 They sending threats, we sending shots 
 They sending threats, we sending shots 
 Martin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better 
 Bunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us 
 To that Ghetto Promise Land, it ain't no hope for the darker man 
 Just the folks who you bump for the Arm & Hammer, the nigga prolly gone die when his mama had em' 
 That fleecy mattress fit 3 or 4, taking shit when we leave the store 
 Ain't a shoulder to lean up on, chauffeur in the back, the police been called 
 Same ol' gauge, same ol' trigger, same ol' cage, brand new nigga 
 Front page when you kill em', mothafucka pay attention 
 Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war 
 They sending threats, we sending shots 
 They sending threats, we sending shots
