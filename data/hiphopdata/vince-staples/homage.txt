Go stupid 
 Don't think too much, you gon' lose it 
 Just lose yourself in the music 
 Get off your ass and move that thang, girl 
 All my girls is my main girl 
 'Round the world in them planes 
 Still ain't changed, still slightly deranged 
 Still O.C., I won't be restrained, girl 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 Outrun my gun, I'm the bigshot now 
 Prima Donna had them like "wow!" 
 Hitchcock of my modern day 
 Where the fuck is my VMA? 
 Where the fuck is my Grammy? 
 Supermodels wearin' no panties 
 Supercars, not drivin' no Camry 
 Fresh meals on the table, no Rally's 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 My girlfriend looks like she's from Gilmore 
 Dance on my Benz like we from Fillmore 
 This my ghetto story, crescendo 
 Coupe with them same windows as limos 
 Won't no label have me in limbo 
 Too much tempo, in Richard Prince mode 
 Robert Longo, black as the Congo 
 Pay me pronto, or it's no convo 
 I'm on a new level 
 I am too cultured and too ghetto 
 If you knew better you'd do better 
 But then you would know why the world on my penis 
 Please do not treat me like I'm not a genius 
 I'm runnin' on empty, the new River Phoenix 
 I'm out in Bristol, bro from the ends got a pistol 
 The bro from the ends down to get you 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These niggas won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 These hoes won't hold me back 
 Was a pleasure to meet you 
 Long time ago I creeped through 
 Now whenever I see you 
 Can't figure where did I meet you 
 Everything see through 
 Your face, that smile, I see you 
 Nowadays I don't see you 
 Mostly 'cause I don't need to
