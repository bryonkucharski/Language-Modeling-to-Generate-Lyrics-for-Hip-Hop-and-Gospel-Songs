I ain't worried about the police 
 I ain't worried about these little niggas talking about they hold heat 
 I ain't stressing going broke 
 I don't never leave the residence alone, keep it on me 
 I'm the nigga that you quote 
 I'm the only conversation if you speaking up on Long Beach 
 Get to acting like you know 
 Don't be acting like you bold, get it cracking at a show 
 Heard the Feds taking pictures, let a motherfucker pose 
 Tryna be the only Crippin' nigga sitting in the Vogue 
 Better put me on the cover, undercovers at my home 
 Tryna catch a nigga slippin', but I'm stickin' to the flow 
 Heard these niggas flippin' coke, why the fuck these niggas broke? 
 If it's shooters in the squad, what's the bodyguard for? 
 You ain't calling me collect then I ain't pickin' up the phone 
 Got some homies from the set who ain't never comin' home 
 You wouldn't know about it 
 You a street punk 
 You a muthafuckin' street punk 
 No one know about you 
 You a street punk 
 You a muthafuckin' street punk 
 Get some dough up out you 
 Where the cash at, where the cash at? 
 Where ya pass at, where ya stash at? 
 Bet my last rack you ain't have that 
 Why? 'Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk! 
 I don't know if ya heard of me 
 But you heard them shots on the block, it's a murder scene 
 Go on, call the cops, open heart, durin' surgery 
 Now his breathing stopped, stupid niggas should've knew we tripping 
 Now he in a box, Winchester's 
 Hundred in the box, Smith Wesson 
 Stuff it to the top and we coming to your spot 
 Knocking on the door, askin' where he at 
 Playin' games then we kick it down, everybody flat 
 On the ground, kids get kidnapped, go and ask 'bout it 
 Well you know how we rocking, nigga, you know who we whackin' now 
 You ain't never caught a body, know it 'cause you talkin' 'bout it 
 Catch me off of Coronado 
 You a motherfucking street punk 
 You a street punk 
 You a muthafuckin' street punk 
 No one know about you 
 You a street punk 
 You a muthafuckin' street punk 
 Get some dough up out you 
 Where the cash at, where the cash at? 
 Where ya pass at, where ya stash at? 
 Bet my last rack you ain't have that 
 Why? 'Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk!
