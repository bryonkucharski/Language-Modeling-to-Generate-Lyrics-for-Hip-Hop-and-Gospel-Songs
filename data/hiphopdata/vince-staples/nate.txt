As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man 
 Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan 
 Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan 
 Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man 
 Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home 
 Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman 
 Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming: 
 "Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!" 
 Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time 
 But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined 
 Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that 
 Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High 
 But my daddy was the man that would be suicide 
 Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride 
 Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride 
 As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man 
 'Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot 
 With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts 
 Fuck the county building, never seen that 
 Catch him riding round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back 
 As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand 
 Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams 
 Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands 
 And it never did said it'd make me be a better man 
 Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans 
 Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand 
 Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand 
 Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand 
 Out in the alley through my window 
 Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke 
 Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows 
 Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor 
 Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch 
 Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it 
 As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand 
 'Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot 
 With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts 
 Fuck the county building, never seen that 
 Catch him riding round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back 
 No, no, no, no 
 Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense 
 25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent 
 Now they're all bound on the slave ship 
 And they left behind their patience 
 Thought that'd last them for a little 
 Pass it down for my kin, oh 
 'Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot 
 With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts 
 Fuck the county building, never seen that 
 Catch him riding round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back 
 With the seat back, with the seat back 
 Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
