New York, New York 
 Bright lights and dark skies 
 If I die today 
 Would you even know I existed? 
 Would you see my fate? 
 How I love you so 
 When you are so far away 
 You're in my skin, above my brim, and 
 If I shall pass away 
 New York, New York 
 Bright lights and dark skies 
 If I die today 
 Would you even know I existed? 
 Would you see my fate? 
 How I love you so 
 When you are so far away 
 You're in my skin, above my brim, and 
 If I shall pass away 
 Gunshot
