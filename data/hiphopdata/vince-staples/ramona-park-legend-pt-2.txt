I'm a mufuckin' legend 
 I'm a mufuckin' legend 
 And this how a nigga feel 
 And this how a nigga feel 
 I'm a mufuckin' 
 One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot (I'm a mufuckin' legend) 
 When I die build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool 
 It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard 
 It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard 
 I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend 
 One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot 
 When I die build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool 
 It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard 
 It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard 
 I'm a mufuckin' 
 I'm a mufuckin'
