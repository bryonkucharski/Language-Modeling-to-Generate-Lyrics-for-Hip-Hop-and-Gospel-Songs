What's your addiction baby? Love can make a bitch go crazy 
 Kiss, hug, fuck and then get faded, fall out and it's all out war 
 Head twirl and your vision blurry, dopeman in that kitchen stirrin' 
 Sold it, we so lit, dope burners, fuck is you so forgetful for? 
 Girl you know that you need that raw 
 Girl you know that you need Visine 
 Preem laced with that cocaín 
 Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans 
 Cop a feel, cop a half sixteen 
 Pour a deuce up and then start leanin' 
 Tryin' to die higher than Pimp C 
 And Big Moe, you know how the shit go (You know how the shit go) 
 I pray to God 'cause I need him, I need him, I need him 
 Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin' 
 Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' 
 Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin' 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 Baby girl love me, I love ya back just don't turn ya back on me 
 Though I'm borderline crazy, mama crack baby, seizures come when I sleep 
 So just hold my hand darlin', don't wanna be a part of your problem, just wanna sleep 
 Without my lungs stopping like they used to 
 I hate when you lie, I hate the truth too 
 Can't wait 'til you die, I hate that we through 
 Fuck around and get a man, leave him dead, where he stand, with the blam', I ain't playin' with a mufucka 
 I was raised at the end of the lead with the surf and the sand, get a tan in this mufucka 
 Wanna feel how you feel, if it's mine, then it's real 
 Then it's fine baby girl I don't need a rubber 
 Nothing wrong in the world with another mother (You know how the shit go) 
 I pray to God 'cause I need him, I need him, I need him 
 Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin' 
 Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' 
 Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin' 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 If I told you, that I love you, would you care? 
 If I said I need you would you be right there 
 If I told you, that I love you, would you care? 
 If I said I need you would you be right there 
 Be right there... (You know how the shit go) 
 I pray to God 'cause I need him, I need him, I need him 
 Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin' 
 Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' 
 Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin' 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof 
 On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
