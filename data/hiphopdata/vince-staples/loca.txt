Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Know you're sick of all the same old thangs 
 Same club wit' the same champagne 
 Backwoods, tryin' to burn your brain 
 Wit' a broke-ass nigga in the CarMax Range 
 You ain't nothin' but a vibrant thang 
 Ass too thick for your 5' 10" frame 
 Want to spend all night in your nine lives? 
 Get to purrin' when that liquor get to burnin' 
 Get it crackin', why you actin' like a virgin? 
 Where it come from, mama or the surgeon? 
 You paid for it, did you pray for it? Get twerkin' 
 And a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it? 
 Why I ask when I already know? 
 Don't mind me, mind already gone 
 Nigga better not keep callin' ya phone 
 Have my dogs in the yard at his home 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 Girl, you lookin' like somethin' out of King 
 Magazine, fifteen in the magazine 
 Hope a nigga don't run up tweakin' 
 I'm tryna to have a good time this evening 
 91 Freeway, eastbound, speedin' 
 Late night but the face right, I need it 
 Mando, I'm the man though, you see it 
 Niggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it 
 I ain't really into clubs, into nightlife 
 Only kick it wit' the thugs, I ain't never did a drug 
 When you doing what I does, need your mind right 
 They won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight 
 What your life like? 
 Would you ride for a nigga, die for a nigga? 
 Court room lie for a nigga? 
 Switch up to set up a snitch on a nigga? 
 Maybe, still gon' drive me crazy 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 You know you drive me crazy 
 Siempre quieres estar en la calle con tus amigos como pendejo y nunca quieres estar en la casa 
 Tienes cosas que hacer en la casa también 
 Siempre quieres estar con ellos y nunca quieres estar conmigo what the fuck 
 Yo no sé que vas hacer, but you need to get your shit together 
 Because a mí no me vas a tratar como a ninguna otra pendeja, estúpido
