I can love you 
 I can love you 
 I can love you 
 I can love you better 
 Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up 
 Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front 
 Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club 
 Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life 
 Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want 
 18 years with a check coming every month 
 Every step you take will get you closer to the paper 
 Pay attention to the ones known 
 The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward 
 Fall with the rules to bask in the glory 
 Bastard child often lost in the story 
 Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win 
 So you love and you lose it 
 She don't wanna devolve 
 Keep your heart in your chest 
 And your head in the stars 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you better 
 He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw 
 Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog 
 How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague 
 Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else 
 The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it 
 Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here 
 Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is 
 Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself 
 Scared of the future, runnin' from the past 
 Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass 
 Young, dumb in the brave heart, numb from the pain 
 Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways 
 So you love and you lose it 
 She don't wanna devolve 
 Keep your heart in your chest 
 And your head in the stars 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 Fall in love and get lost 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you better 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you (I can love you) 
 I can love you better
