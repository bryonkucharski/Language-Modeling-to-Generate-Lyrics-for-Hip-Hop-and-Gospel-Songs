We might be wrong, might be guilty 
 We might be right this time 
 You tried to warn me, this war that would kill me 
 I sacrificed 
 Die to the world, I took the money 
 (Wouldn't you) 
 So for my life 
 Can't sleep at night, you shoulda seen the crib though 
 So fucking nice 
 Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind 
 Justice is supposed to be blind 
 But continue to cross color lines 
 Hands up, don't shoot 
 Shot. Stand your ground 
 Blacks don't own no ground to stand on so we stand on our words. 
 Black and hooded is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons on 
 I can't breathe through the chokeholds and gun smoke 
 These realities drift and appear to inform black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors 
 Slain in society by sworn protectors 
 Protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends 
 No charges brought against them 
 They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us. Damn, 'cause 
 It don't even matter. You can start from the beginning... 
 We might be wrong, might be guilty 
 We might be right this time 
 You tried to warn me, this war that would kill me 
 I sacrificed 
 Die to the world, I took the money 
 (Wouldn't you) 
 So for my life 
 Can't sleep at night, you shoulda seen the crib though 
 So fucking nice 
 They searching, they searching cells 
 Hold on 'cause, (Oh it's the) there's police in this motherfucker, you ain't hear them? 
 You ain't hear the alarms? 
 Three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven 
 Another day in Ironwood 
 We might be wrong, might be guilty 
 We might be right this time 
 You tried to warn me, this war that would kill me 
 I sacrificed 
 Die to the world, I took the money 
 (Wouldn't you) 
 So for my life 
 Can't sleep at night, you shoulda seen the crib though 
 So fucking nice
