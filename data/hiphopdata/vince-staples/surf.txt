Broken home, all I had was my homeboys 
 Either build or destroy, what you going for? 
 Just a pawn and a plan tryin' to hold on 
 When the smoke clear why was the war fought? 
 Bout time you abandon the folklore 
 How you rich but your bitch in an old Ford? 
 How you black sellin' crack for the white man? 
 How you real, wouldn't kill for your right hand? 
 On the stand sworn in with ya right hand 
 It was all goin' good 'til the rave end 
 Knife scars on ya neck from ya best friend 
 Now it's talk, keep a Tec on the nightstand 
 Every nigga dead to the world 'til his life end 
 You got it, I armed it, you dreamed it, I start it 
 You're missin' the target, what more can you ask me for? 
 You want it, my dearly departed 
 I cocked back and shot it, what more can you ask me for? 
 More black kids killed from a pill than the Feds in the projects 
 In the planned parenthood playin' God with ya mom's check, you ain't even been to prom yet 
 Sixteen, heard you wanna be a star girl 
 What he charge for the dream that you bought girl 
 What's the price on a life in this dark world? 
 Couple hundred where I come from, 
 How you sleep when the sun down? 
 I ain't really tryna judge, they be lookin' for somebody you can love 
 He was lookin' for somebody he could fuck 
 Took ya body, wouldn't bother with you none 
 Spoiled rotten in the bottom of the slums 
 Caught up in the fun 
 You got it, I armed it, you dreamed it, I start it 
 You're missin' the target, what more can you ask me for? 
 You want it, my dearly departed 
 I cocked back and shot it, what more can you ask me for?
