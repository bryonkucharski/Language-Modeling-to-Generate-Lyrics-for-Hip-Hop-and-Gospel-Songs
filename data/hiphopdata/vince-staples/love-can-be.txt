Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be disheartening, darling 
 Love can be 
 Love can be a lot, so maybe not 
 You can give me all the cash you got 
 Let me take those keys around the block 
 Make some memories on daddy's yacht 
 I'm so over you 
 You talk a lot of shit, unamused 
 Ain't putting on the ritz for no dude 
 I can finish you, I can fill them shoes 
 You know my name, I'm not your babe 
 What's that you're saying? I don't speak lame 
 You know my name, I'm not your babe 
 If you're thinking of calling, kindly refrain 
 Wannabes buzzing 
 Girls love the lifestyle 
 So prone to clubbing 
 Come alive when the night's out 
 Just crashed a sports car 
 So much for fast life 
 Phone calls from loves lost 
 Tryna get back right 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be, yeah 
 Love can be so disheartening, darling 
 Love can be 
 Love can be, yeah 
 Love can be 
 Tell the world I want my Uchies 
 Dodge the groupies, them don't move me 
 Uchies moved me somewhere cozy 
 Uchies never leave me lonely 
 Call my phone, say she horny, want me 
 I can make time or I can make money 
 I'ma keep countin', count me out, shawty 
 Never let a bitch Lil Bow Wow me 
 Never finna weekend raise my seed 
 Baby mama drama on the TMZ 
 Alimony money for the nails and weave 
 Nail me to the cross like that boy JC 
 Chuckin' up the deuce like the boy Chris Breeze 
 But we don't suwoop on the six-five street 
 Riding down the shoreline, tank on E 
 No shotgun seat, this dick ain't free 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be disheartening, darling 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be 
 Love can be disheartening, darling 
 Love can be 
 Love can be
