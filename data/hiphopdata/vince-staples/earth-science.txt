Bitches born with shovels 
 Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman 
 Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you 
 Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror 
 You took a chance and I appreciate it 
 Understand that over time our word depreciated 
 But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when 
 Give it time and a place swear to god I'll attend 
 I should've took you to prom 
 Fuck whoever had did but I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym 
 And you was right there, you was always right there 
 Forwarding your calls thinking how we got here 
 But I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 No I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 Remember walking to your house everyday of the week 
 Nothing else I had to do and you was something to see 
 Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans 
 Still text you every night before I wander to sleep 
 Never told you this but you was why I went to seventh period 
 Truant student but you told me I should take it serious 
 Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with 
 Standing in your living room meeting your fam' 
 Know it hurt you when they ask you what had happen to him 
 When you see me on the t.v. know I'm glad you're my friend 
 Wish I had more but I don't 
 Never running out of hope really I'm just waiting on you 
 But I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 No I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 As for you I always think about our kids that you killed 
 Understanding at the time you didn't think we was real 
 But as a man I felt I let you down, we was on our second child 
 That you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile 
 It make me see the way y'all try to plan for us all 
 When I look back at my life I'm glad I had you involved 
 If I ever need somebody you the first I'mma call 
 Said that you would do it all just to see me alive 
 In the back seat, steel beats, tears in your eyes 
 Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie 
 But whatever help you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away 
 Sorry if you called me and told you I can't talk today 
 Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs 
 Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone 
 But I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 No I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you 
 I never said I never had love for you
