I never needed nobody to believe in 
 I seen 'em change like the seasons 
 R.I.P., you just a candle on the cement 
 Once you leave so I've been trying to live forever, dawg 
 I got a .25 Beretta in my mama car 
 Same one my brother use, same one my father bought 
 Everybody telling when they go to court 
 I'm feeling like they don't make niggas like me no more 
 I still got slaves hanging from my family tree 
 The young still gangbanging like we WC 
 And Mac 10, Mac 10's sit up under the fleece 
 Because the powers that be insist on fucking with me 
 Since back when there was white men under them sheets 
 Riding horseback, walking on the backs of the free 
 You see we in it to survive, what the fuck did you think? 
 At the blink of an eye niggas could die in these streets 
 My life a movie, hope you liking the show 
 They act, we shooting, just a part of the role 
 The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low 
 I pray for blessings, grab my weapon when I walk out the do' 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 When I'm ready to go, when I'm ready to go 
 Hey, tell these niggas let the black man shine 
 This little light of mine, a nine I hide inside of my drawers 
 Ain't nothing ancient, mama, ey lil mama, ey don't start 
 I only pray when asking Allah how we made it this far 
 But still I'm all about the dollar, pass the offering jar 
 The thoughts of niggas on the bottom what I offer to y'all 
 We from the slaveship, all my niggas ride for the cause 
 We on the same shit, tryna survive all the loss 
 Because they ain't shit, won't take shit but the charge 
 Because we can't snitch, know you niggas heard it before 
 A child was murdered before, he had a chance to mature 
 And bet the one that did it never seen outside of the bars 
 We the pride of Raymond Washington, they washing us off 
 Them baggy True's fit just like them county blues 
 Mac 10 match well with my black skin 
 Little black boy shooting up the avenue 
 My life a movie, hope you liking the show 
 They act, we shooting, just a part of the role 
 The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low 
 I pray for blessings, grab my weapon when I walk out the do' 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 Lock and load and I'm ready to go 
 When I'm ready to go, when I'm ready to go
