All the bad bitches boo when you rap 
 I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact 
 I got one in the front and two in the back 
 And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back" 
 Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk 
 While I invest stock in wet rock 
 Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock" 
 Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops 
 And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine 
 And go harder than a fucking crack intervention 
 Clown of the class and the last to attend it 
 Big Earl make you fags stand at attention 
 Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general 
 Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go 
 Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know 
 Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold 
 Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes 
 Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows 
 Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow 
 So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo' 
 All the bad bitches boo when you rap 
 I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact 
 I got one in the front and two in the back 
 And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back" 
 Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy 
 Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18 
 A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store 
 She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth 
 Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it 
 Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin 
 Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet 
 She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it 
 Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch 
 So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit 
 Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck 
 Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette 
 Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment 
 Stash her where we hide the marijuana and the condoms 
 "Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look 
 You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book 
 All the bad bitches boo when you rap 
 I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact 
 I got one in the front and two in the back 
 And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back" 
 Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night 
 They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like 
 Damn right, red light, ran right through it 
 "You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?" 
 Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising 
 And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises 
 But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music 
 I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint 
 Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue 
 With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving 
 Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused 
 As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid 
 Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit 
 Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving 
 Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted 
 As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship 
 "Aren't you a little too young to be driving?" 
 Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home 
 "Get out the fucking car with your license and registration" 
 I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience 
 Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike 
 Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife 
 Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped 
 Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit 
 All the bad bitches boo when you rap 
 I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact 
 A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back 
 And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"
