Softly as if I played piano in the dark 
 Found a way to channel my anger now to embark 
 The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part 
 God... with the signal clear as day 
 Put my Glock, put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon 
 That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay 
 Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon 
 That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay 
 Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon 
 That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 War ready, your boys lost already 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 War ready, your boys lost already 
 My bitch look like Mona Lisa 
 Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer 
 Think of heading to Ibiza 
 Need a breather from the tripping 
 Either that or my brains to the ceiling 
 Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling 
 Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit 
 Ain't a thang to a G 
 Life give you lemons, nigga hang from a tree 
 Cold game all came in a dream 
 Woke up feeling like the walls caved in 
 Fought to the death, never gave in 
 Write that on the grave that I get laid in 
 Heaven, Hell, free or jail, same shit 
 County jail bus, slave ship, same shit 
 A wise man once said that a black man better off dead 
 So I'm, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 War ready, your boys lost already 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 Born ready, war ready 
 War ready, your boys lost already 
 Learned the power of words when we was younger 
 Saying fuck the sign on his curb can make him hunt you 
 Turned the African into a nigga then they hung him 
 Said it earlier in the verse, sometimes I wonder 
 Who the activist and who the Devil's advocate 
 Or do it matter? Shit 
 They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich 
 Or got a platinum hit 
 A chain or two 
 Seem the music interchangeable 
 Raging bull, what you headed for? 
 Heaven doors, or hell below 
 I write directions for the road to let you know 
 Edgar Allen Poe 
 Tried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows 
 Feel for 'em, words, we kill for 'em 
 Leave the bitchin' to the birds, we still war'n 
 Born ready, you boys lost already 
 All in till the lord get me 
 Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon 
 That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay
