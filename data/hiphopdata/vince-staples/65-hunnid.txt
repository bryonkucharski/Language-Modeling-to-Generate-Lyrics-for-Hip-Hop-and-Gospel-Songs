Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G 
 Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees) 
 Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor 
 Gangsta God, baby get on your knees (Baby girl get on your knees) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid) 
 Runnin' to get to that check, I'm comin' 
 Jumpin' out of that back seat bustin' 
 Buss buss missions with the blower as a youngin' 
 Back when Killa Mo 
 Had 'em coppin' Crystal through the prison door 
 Feel the 4, when I'm feelin' low 
 Time to stretch a nigga 
 Ridin' through your section 
 Shit, I hope you got protection with you 
 Hop out when the cops out 
 Shit, I'm cold with my .45, brown rag, green light 
 Yoda time 
 Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G 
 Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees) 
 Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor 
 Gangsta God, baby get on your knees (Baby girl get on your knees) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid) 
 You alone 
 Car full of niggas but you alone 
 It's time to show how much you love your homies 
 One nigga outside, two niggas up inside the store 
 One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along 
 Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow 
 Don't stop 'til he drop 
 Don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes 
 I told you before 
 That niggas gotta die for this shit to survive 
 Is you with it or not? Get to knockin' then 
 Problem is lot of niggas scared of the consequence 
 Common sense missin' from your head when the pressure on 
 Niggas from my home ain't enrolled in the colleges 
 Fuck a class, junkies hittin' glass 
 Get the money long 
 Gleamin' with the tints and the stash, no tags 
 Bumpin' poison on the ave 
 Gettin' cash until a nigga's gone 
 And ain't shit wrong with the truth, got the Juice 
 Would've threw that nigga Bishop off the roof 
 Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G 
 Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees) 
 Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor 
 Gangsta God, baby get on your knees (Baby girl get on your knees) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout) 
 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)
