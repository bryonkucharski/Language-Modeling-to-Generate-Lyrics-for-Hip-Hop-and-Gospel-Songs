Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit 
 I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped 
 So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you 
 Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you 
 White high school, wasn't laughing at the black jokes 
 Daddy had us contact high off of crack smoke 
 Had to get it cracking with the 7 'cause the Mac broke 
 Wrist fucked up, couldn't make it to practice 
 Had the money in the couch and the K's by the mattress 
 Chasing senior bitches down 'cause we was hanging with Pac then 
 Sidekick thefts if he pressed him we packed him 
 Ski masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen 
 Mayfair freshman class, but I skipped them all 
 But Miss Brown 'cause that was my nigga 
 Ask me what mattered more, school or the set? 
 She can tell by the truancy I'm true to the shit 
 Couple months I was up out of there 
 Mama kicked me out of the house, but shit I didn't care 
 Hitting licks came to a drought so we was killing kids all for the buck 
 15 sitting shotgun, ready to duck? 
 Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit 
 I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped 
 So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you 
 Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you 
 I swear I'm busy every time my mama call my phone 
 No time for stressing, she can leave a message at the tone 
 I apologize for breaking up your happy home 
 And looking like my daddy, all them arguments was overblown 
 Girl, I just want you happy, that's the reason why I write these songs 
 'Cause I can give a fuck 'bout where I end up when it's said and done 
 Riding down 7 Street looking for your second son 
 Found him on Artesia with a Yannc he had a loaded gun 
 But you ain't know the difference, coming home late 
 Seen Tyson in the kitchen trying to make his own plate 
 But you love my homies like you love your only son that walk and talk 
 Think that was the reason why you afraid to see me risk it all 
 But your father told me no reward if no risk involved 
 And your father raised me, made me crazy, don't take shit at all 
 I know you miss him 'cause I miss him more and I can't quite recall 
 Knew he would be happy as the day my mama had me, see 
 Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit 
 I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped 
 So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you 
 Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
