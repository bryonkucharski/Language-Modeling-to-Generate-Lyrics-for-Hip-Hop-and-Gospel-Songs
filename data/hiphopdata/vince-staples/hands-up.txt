North Division tryin' to stop my blackness 
 I'm watchin' for them badges when out in traffic 
 Them 9-11's been a tad bit frantic 
 If lights start flashin', please don't panic 
 The DEA givin' out gang enhancements 
 Can barely even hang to build a case off cameras 
 CCAT trackin' criminal patterns 
 Trickin' niggas into takin' strikes to get out faster 
 Freedom bribery nigga, 'cause we hardly acquit 
 Social media that leave the flash photography snitchin' 
 Blame geography nigga, for the pride in these niggas 
 Take you when they fingerprint you, now you part of the system 
 This was all a part of Huey P. and Bobby prediction 
 Makin' profit off of violence, they arousin' attention 
 Leaders risin' lead to twenty-five to life in the prison 
 Better watch it 'cause I know they got a spot for you nigga 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air 
 Deangelo Lopez and Tyler Woods 
 Just a couple they gunned down around the hood 
 I guess the pigs split wigs for the greater good 
 'Cause I ain't seen them lock a swine up yet 
 At the most they reassign 'em to prevent protest 
 Just your color is enough to get you under arrest 
 Strong hand to the law got me feelin' oppressed 
 If you flippin', kill a fifty, then you get in a chair 
 Payin' taxes for some fuckin' clowns to ride around 
 Whoopin' niggas asses, scared to man up 
 Handcuffs givin' niggas gashes on the wrist 
 I used to lift my fist to fight the power with 
 Older homie told me in his day the pigs was plantin' bricks 
 In the trunks of nigga's Chevrolets them traffic stops and shit 
 Raidin' homes without a warrant 
 Shoot him first without a warning 
 And they expect respect and non-violence 
 I refuse the right to be silent 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air 
 LBPD, no they ain't 'bout shit 
 LAPD, no they ain't 'bout shit 
 LASD, no they ain't 'bout shit 
 Ridin' 'round these streets givin' out full clips 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air 
 Yeah, put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air
