All right, all right, all right 
 Man I love my bitches 
 Man they photogenic 
 Snatched 'em straight up out they Richardson mag they do my dishes 
 Man I love this Cripping 
 Man my homies with it 
 All these murders they ain't got enough ambulances with 'em 
 I ain't paying homage to nobody with no bodies 
 I don't care bout yo Ferrari I'll snatch you out that Bentley 
 Was cramming into Civics 'round 2010ish 
 Piled in the studio when not a nigga would listen 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Hands up baby don't you see this big nine 
 Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine 
 Player shit player made 
 I'm stuck in my player ways 
 I just made a play today 
 She gave me some play today 
 My Jordan was lawaway 
 I caught me a fade a day 
 Around where Janaya stay 
 My 40 go dumb in a major way 
 I come from the game where they pay to play 
 These rappers extorted like everyday 
 That Yankee I'm sporting like every day 
 Just played me a show they paid 80k 
 I put it away for a rainy day 
 You never know when you gon catch a case 
 You never know when you gon catch an opp 
 We kill ever day like where Sosa stay 
 You might get a pass 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Now we're big time, big time, big time 
 Hands up baby don't you see this big nine 
 Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine 
 Big timer like Manny and Baby 
 Don't play with that man 'cause he crazy 
 With Demon and Ocho from Bompton 
 They stomping out niggas like Stacy 
 The radio never gon play me quit if my label don't pay me 
 I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z 
 Bandana like Jayo from Daygo's 
 My temper depend how my day go 
 My girl do whatever I say so 
 She ain't got no reason to say no 
 I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich 
 You ain't seen how grimey my hood get 
 I been on some up to no good shit 
 You on that Cuba in Boyz N da Hood shit 
 I go down to Cuba and find me a plug 
 Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs 
 Sick of this industry playing these games 
 Sick of my enemies saying my name 
 Harder than niggas since Hollister nigga 
 I'll body a nigga for saying I can't 
 You should have known I go hard in the paint 
 You should have known ain't no stopping my wave 
 Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time 
 Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time 
 Next time on Poppy street 
 Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?
