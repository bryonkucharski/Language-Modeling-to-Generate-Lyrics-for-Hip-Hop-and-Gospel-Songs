You can get anything you want 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 You want that over there? 
 You want that over there? 
 I got you 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night balling 
 So far from my past misfortune 
 No sleepin', late nights no eatin' 
 Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian 
 Ramona, I was round that corner 
 Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier 
 G slide right down Sawyer 
 When we slide, you won't see morning 
 Another story of a young black man 
 Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn 
 Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans 
 If you hatin' don't shake my hand 
 Take it easy, homie 
 Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz 
 Of the 22 bus stop way back when 
 With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan 
 For the click, clack, clap 
 Or the boop, bop, bam, 'cause 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago 
 Women problems every morning like the Maury show 
 Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread 
 From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head 
 At the park politicin' with the kids 
 Tryna get 'em on a straight path, got the lames mad 
 Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash 
 In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house 
 Compensation conversations what I'm all about 
 Took the smart route, never been marked out 
 Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out 
 But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking 
 Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water 
 Mix the holy water with the Voss 
 Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost 
 Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach 
 That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand 
 I was up late night ballin' 
 Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
