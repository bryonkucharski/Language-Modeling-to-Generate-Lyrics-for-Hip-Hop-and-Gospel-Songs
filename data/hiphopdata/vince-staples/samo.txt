Way up, way up 
 Way up, way up 
 Same old thang 
 Watch me do the same old thang 
 If I wrote your ass a love song, could I make it bang? 
 If I pull up with my gun drawn, run, I make it bang 
 Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang 
 Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank 
 Never blow it on a chain, rather blow my fuckin' brain 
 Decorator came from Spain, blow the budget on an accent couch 
 What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin' 
 Daddy in and out of prison, ain't a father to my style 
 I'm the ODB of the OPB 
 When I go OT, all the shows sold out 
 And the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama 
 Tryna break a player pockets, that's a no no 
 This day forward, I ain't takin' photos 
 And we wear our own clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo' 
 Just the same old thing (way up, way up) 
 Watch me do the same old thing 
 Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up) 
 Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old 
 Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up) 
 Same old 
 Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up) 
 Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing 
 Win the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate 
 I'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G 
 I traffic 'cross the interstate 
 We cracked and launched the murder rate 
 They know who did the killin', but they didn't see 
 Want a verse? Issa price. Want a show? Issa fee 
 We don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy 
 Empty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin' 
 Eye contact is an extra five 
 No doubt in mind, we the best alive 
 No testifyin', we solid 
 Never told on my partners 
 My partna them got bodies 
 I'm tryna put 'em in 'Raris 
 They used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college 
 Put 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama 
 Just the same old thing (way up, way up) 
 Watch me do the same old thing 
 Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up) 
 Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old 
 Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up) 
 Same old 
 Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up) 
 Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing 
 Way up, way up 
 Way up, way up
