School couldn't get me into Heaven 
 And Heaven couldn't get me in a bitch bed 
 Bred 11's that I stole on a house lick 
 Got them hoes, whole Polo outfits 
 Feelin' like Young Dro, summertime '06 
 Thirteen years old runnin' my home, ya bitch 
 Believe that, we was thuggin' on the back street 
 Catchin' cases, probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 Them Yankee hats remind me of my younger days 
 Dog was a maniac 
 My momma had me where them babies havin' babies at 
 My knuckles ashy knockin' niggas on they ass 
 For smackin', never lackin', road to riches is a path 
 Mothafucka watch your ass 
 And quick race, dawg, for when cold blood like Crips 
 You dig your own grave when you fuckin' with the Lord 
 Catch a fade, probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway 
 I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
