I wake up tryin' to dodge the cops just like my momma did 
 Came home from school soon as I seen she was up out the crib 
 Criminal Minded, mind your business if you wanna live 
 Them niggas fiendin' for them luxuries they'll never get 
 I took a couple women's love for me and hit a lick 
 If she can't help me get up out the struggle, why I need the bitch? 
 I need a million dollars for starters, been sick of sleepin' on the couch 
 In this crowded apartment, them streets been in a fuckin' drought 
 I don't see the narcotics, it ain't no books up in this backpack 
 I brought the revolver, I'm asking niggas where the cash at 
 Tappin' they pockets 
 That pocket rocket make a backpacker as soon as you blockin' 
 You know the block is hot 
 Wayne tried to tell them, one case away from felon 
 Granny told me stay inside the house, a nigga should've listened 
 Been punchin' out their faces with the hands that I pray with 
 Money trees blowin' in the wind, I'm feeling the fragrance 
 Is you feeling amazing? Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done 
 Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done 
 And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 2006 I said I had to get my money right 
 Shit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night 
 Might put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind 
 Then run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine 
 College was a plan of mine until I seen them fees 
 Everything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets 
 Only price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me 
 Closely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie 
 Goals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep 
 Mom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave 
 Then this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds 
 Is what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen? 
 Played a lot of roles in life but never played the victim 
 Never paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights 
 Mac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist 
 Life is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice 
 Is you feeling amazing? Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done 
 Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done 
 And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love 
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love
