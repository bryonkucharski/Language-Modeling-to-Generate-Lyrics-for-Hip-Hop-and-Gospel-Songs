Hittin' corners, thuggin' with the blower, barrel louder than a motor 
 Keep the engine runnin' when a nigga run up on ya 
 Another day in sunny California 
 The FEDs takin' pictures and they tappin' Motorolas 
 Everybody snitchin', gotta live with paranoia 
 A soldier since the stroller, ask my mama if you doubt that 
 Homie where ya clout at? You ain't ever push nobody's scalp back 
 45, 9s 'round 9 in the AM 
 Yesterday I sat and prayed, today I'm finna take it 
 A week ago, they killed my bro, that's been the price of bangin' 
 Since my granny Alameda days, robbin' 'cause we need a raise 
 Fingers do the talkin' when the Cs do the walkin' 
 And the Cs been polluted, baptism for these shooters 
 Seventh grade, I went to OCA, hoopin' up at Lueder's 
 With my Ru from Campanella we was crashin' shit together 
 Three, two, three, zero 
 3230 Poppy St, we ain't chasin', they brought the beef 
 Used to the sounds of violence, my neighbors ain't never call police 
 Call it followin' protocols, spark it if you don't know the call 
 Got this bitch that live off of Market that's down to hold the heat 
 Turnin' water and power off, got us impatient, powered up 
 Evictions notices go unnoticed, the final hours up 
 Livin' off of borrowed time, committin' crimes that's organized 
 Fortress wasn't fortified, just tryna build my castle up 
 Dollar and a dream, at night time we maskin' up 
 The deadly game of tag, the older generations passed to us 
 I got a clip that's long enough to shoot until the casket come 
 Wait until that casket drop, they droppin' when that magnum pop
