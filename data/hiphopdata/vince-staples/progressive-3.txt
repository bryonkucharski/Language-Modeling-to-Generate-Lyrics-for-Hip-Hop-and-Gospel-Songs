Yeah, back and blacker than ever 
 Got sick of waiting for these actors to get it together 
 Still in them gutters, all my brothers is birds of a feather 
 Tried to get this money 'cause my people done struggled forever 
 Son of my father, gunning for stardom, it's worth a shot 
 They hate me like I'm fucking their mama, that's why I serve 'em hot 
 Shells they burning, as long as hell is burning I'll murder God 
 If he was trying to fuck up my paper, nigga, that's all I got 
 The black and brown been going through a holocaust 
 You see Obama just a house nigga to me 
 They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key 
 It's empty plates in this estate so shorty shit where he eat 
 He got a clip, he got a K, he 'bout to light up the street 
 They catch him slipping, now they trip him knock him right off his feet 
 His mama crying on the news like that boy was so smart 
 Wish he never start chilling with them niggas at the park 
 Been swimming with the sharks since the kiddy pool 
 Breaking all the written rules 
 Breaking the tradition of that inner-city raising fools 
 A raisin in the sun 
 They let the monkey out the cage, he got a gun 
 He got a book, he got a brain, you better run 
 Was the one that they shun 
 Baptized in the tears of the slaves as a young 
 A penny saved is a penny earned 
 So I'll be stacking up this copper as the city burn 
 Cold chain, nigga 
 Yeah, just sit and look at where they raised us at 
 Seen blacks ain't crack, so they gave us that 
 Give us hope then take us back 
 To the 1800's with these rap contracts 
 And they wonder why niggas get shot, coke sit in the pot 
 He can't get no job so he hitting the block 
 And if that nigga getting money while them niggas sitting hungry 
 Ten times out of ten bet them niggas gon' plot 
 We just struggle with survival trying to rise to the top 
 When your life is on the line fuck what's right and what's not 
 You got a right to the dream, whether it's triple beam or Martin Luther's 
 My chain heavy, is you ready for that revolution?
