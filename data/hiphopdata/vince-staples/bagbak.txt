This is for my future baby mama 
 Hope your skin is black as midnight 
 I'll take you out that Honda 
 I can put you in a Benz 
 I can balance out your chakras 
 Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless 
 Our father art in heaven, as I pray for new McLarens 
 Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion 
 Everybody think they know me now 
 'Cause I'm chicken-checkin' 
 Negro, you are not my homie 
 How dare you think it's different 
 Boy, you trippin' 
 Gas break 'n' dip, the cash came, I flipped 
 And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling 
 So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat 
 And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin' 
 Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie 
 Boy I'm buoyant, we are 
 Floating on them peons 
 Go in till they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs 
 Prison system broken, racial war commotion 
 Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin' 
 We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office 
 Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started 
 The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects 
 So till they love my dark skin 
 Bitch I'm goin' all in 
 Gas break 'n' dip, the cash came, I flipped 
 And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling 
 So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat 
 And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin' 
 Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me 
 Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie 
 They found it 
 Depth close to 3,230 feet 
 A deep dive, but within acceptable range 
 Clap your hands if the police ever profiled 
 You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now 
 Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town 
 Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now 
 We on now, we on now 
 Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now 
 Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now 
 Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now 
 We on now 
 We on now 
 We on now 
 We on now
