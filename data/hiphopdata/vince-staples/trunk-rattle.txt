My momma cried the day I got put on the hood 
 Never wished for better days, only wished a nigga would 
 Never been a pump faker, that won't do your boy no good 
 Still shoot it like a free throw, hammers that the chicos get 
 Daddy threw it off the glass like a bank shot, shit 
 I'm just trying to get the money that the bank got flip 
 Like a monster truck, banging never disturbed me 
 That's the only time I see niggas balling without a jersey 
 At apartments we used to loot, them poppy niggas'll shoot 
 Homies taught me 2N's ain't need no friends 
 I need a black panamera with the black 2-10's 
 Told my momma I would make it so the story begins 
 Begins 
 Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch 
 Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch 
 Mafuckas talkin' shit till you show up where they live 
 Mafuckas talkin' shit till you show up where they live, nigga 
 Got a whole lot of problems at the crib 
 Got a chopper at the crib since I hopped up out the crib, nigga 
 Tell me what's the deal, I'm trying to make a mil or somethin' 
 Tell me how you feel, these haters want a hundred 
 So it's cameras in the crib, cock hammers in the whip 
 Champagne for the pain, gram stacked up in the spliff 
 Blow the back out on the bitch who only want you for the dough you got 
 We know they know you know, but still we got them hoes up in the spot 
 Getting hot and bothered sinning in this sign of smoke 
 I put that on my momma, not a nigga living that stop the show 
 Promise that we did it way before we ever heard of rap 
 Niggas say they shooters, where your jersey at? 
 We catch you where you lurking at 
 Been to hell and church and back, all in granny Cadillac 
 Matter fact she had that Eldorado parked on Colorado 
 Called us if she had a problem, cousin Jerry had a rocket 
 Back when Common had you tryna to read Qu'rans and go to college 
 But forget about it 
 Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch 
 Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch 
 Mafuckas talkin' shit till you show up where they live 
 Mafuckas talkin' shit till you show up where they live, nigga 
 Got a whole lot of problems at the crib 
 Got a chopper at the crib since I hopped up out the crib, nigga
