Guns and Roses, another young boy lost, another fallen soldier 
 Younger brother tears' falling on his mother's shoulders 
 She got some tears of her own, wish she had loved him stronger 
 13, but he grown, you see the gun he holding, that was made for a man 
 The rush he get when he load it is one you won't understand unless you hold it and blow it, Granny moved from New Orleans searching for better life 
 A troubled cardiac is all she got, eating that McDonalds by the laundry mat 
 Daughter was 17, she just want to know where the party at 
 Met somebody that night, fucked him, he never called her back 
 Now her oldest bastard son sitting in that casket 
 Young victim of the guns and roses 
 Living young and hopeless 
 Guns and Roses, another young girl lost, you see her heart was broken 
 She used to love so strong till she got done wrong, ain't wanna feel no guilt 
 She blamed it all on home, but still it felt so real, and shit she lie so well 
 Her parents never could tell where she was really at 
 Now is it really love or just another lie to fuck inside his mama's truck raw like the emotions of her crying that night, her pillow soaked 
 She miss the hope she had as a kid 
 But he doing all the things that her dad never did 
 He'll be the dad of a kid if she have it, but still he'd rather not 
 Steal her mother's car, hit the bar just to grab a shot from the guns and roses 
 Living young and hopeless 
 Guns and Roses, I had it all in my home but mother never noticed 
 The neighborhood where I roamed was known for countless encounters 
 Of people pressin' they line, I try to stay in my boundary 
 When bounties placed on your head for shit you never had did 
 You just conform to survive, not tryin' to sit in no pit 
 I like me better alive, three fifty-seven's for six eleven, fit in the nine 
 I take 'em both when I dipped 'cause I ain't dyin' today 
 It's just a game that we play, what you bang ? where you stay? 
 Before you answer just spray, they'll never see it coming 
 Hit a man woman, child, or dog because it's mine before yours 
 It's two weapons in wars and that's 
 The guns and roses, young victim of the guns and roses
