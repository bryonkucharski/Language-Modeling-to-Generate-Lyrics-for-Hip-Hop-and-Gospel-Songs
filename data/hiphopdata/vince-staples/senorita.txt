 Fuck ya dead homies, run ya bread homie 
 Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia 
 Parked in my Bimmer bumping my own shit 
 I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit 
 Livin' for that True Religion is broke shit 
 I can spend that on a MAC with a long clip 
 Fly in that Benz but you hide in that Focus 
 My nigga just focus, I'm tryin' to paint you a picture 
 We stuck in the moment 
 My burner gets stuck if I shoot it too much 
 So a nigga resorted to domin' 
 That's somebody's son but a war to be won 
 Baby either go hunt or be hunted 
 We crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab 
 So I shot at him in front of the Douglas 
 I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

 What means the world to you? 
 Is it a fast life, money and clothes? 
 Probably fuckin' these hoes 
 Or what would you murder for? 
 Will your name hold weight when the curtains close? 
 Nigga caught one case and I heard he told 
 Snitch get a full clip and closed casket 
 Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet 
 Cold jumper, been shootin', no practice 
 Been tourin', whip foreign, coupe crashin' 
 Still bangin' 2 Naughty 2 Nasty 
 Still "fuck the police" they won't catch me 
 My feature too pricey, don't ask me 
 Go hard, till Goyard on my baggage 
 He mad we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him 
 Mask up at midnight and start clappin' 
 Kids crying, still snipe him, no lackin'
