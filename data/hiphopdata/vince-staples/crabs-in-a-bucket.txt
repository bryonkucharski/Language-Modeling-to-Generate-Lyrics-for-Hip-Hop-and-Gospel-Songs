Crabs in a bucket 
 Crabs in a bucket 
 Wanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it? 
 When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore 
 Sendin' shots but you at the top floor 
 Let 'em pop shit, give me some drums to go pop with 
 Need white women at the shows unconscious 
 If not that then topless, earned all this 
 Get with that or get in the moshpit 
 Where's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy? 
 Young man, you not actin' too cocky 
 Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash 
 Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash 
 If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash 
 Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag 
 Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect 
 Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet 
 Spend a lot of money on the CDG 
 Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen? 
 Battle with the white man day by day 
 Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play 
 They don't ever want to see the black man eat 
 Nails in the black man's hands and feet 
 Put him on a cross so we put him on a chain 
 Lying to me, sayin' he don't look like me 
 Rollcage on the GT3 
 How a show on stage like a DVD? 
 Put me in the MoMA when it's over with 
 I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit 
 Remember that I still got you 
 I still got you here 
 It's rare they'd come across you? 
 I kept you hidden in my head 
 Drowning in my own ocean 
 I forgot to care 
 And you can drop the anchor, baby 
 I know what's under there 
 It never really crossed my mind to think 
 Maybe you'd avert your glance at me? 
 Ever really cross your mind 
 Ever really cross your mind 
 I ain't never had no chance to breathe
