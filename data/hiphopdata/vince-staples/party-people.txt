I been fucked since my early days 
 I been stuck in my worldly ways 
 Propaganda, press pan the camera 
 Please don't look at me in my face 
 Everybody might see my pain 
 Off the rail, might off myself 
 Bored with life as I board this plane 
 Stewardess ask if I need help 
 Maybe baby, what's your last name 
 Hopefully it still ain't been changed 
 Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya 
 Awkward silence, my brain scream louder 
 Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself 
 Couple problems my cash can't help 
 Human issues, too strong for tissues 
 False bravado all masked by wealth 
 Move your body if you came here to party 
 If not then pardon me 
 How I'm supposed to have a good time 
 When death and destruction's all I see? 
 Out of sight, I'm out of my mind 
 The sound of sunshine is callin' me 
 Good vibrations is all I need 
 All I need, all I need 
 Party people, yeah 
 Party people I like to see you dance 
 Party people, yeah 
 Party people I like to see you dance 
 Party people, move 
 Party people I like to see you groove 
 This is how we do, this is how we do 
 Deja vu from my bayside view 
 I see black cats in the daytime too 
 I see black cats on the daytime news 
 With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue 
 I met God once at a rendezvous and felt star-struck 
 "Vince, the car's out front" 
 Got things to do, got to make my moves 
 I can't miss my flight and miss you too, boo 
 First class seats is overrated 
 Won't go 'less they overpay us 
 Nowadays I'm overdatin' 
 My dick is strict for procreation 
 Her lips, my lips stay well acquainted 
 Her morning moanings is callin' me 
 Good vibrations is all I need 
 All I need, all I need 
 Move your body if you came here to party 
 If not then pardon me 
 How I'm supposed to have a good time 
 When death and destruction's all I see? 
 Out of sight, I'm out of my mind 
 The sound of sunshine is callin' me 
 Good vibrations is all I need 
 All I need, all I need 
 Party people, yeah 
 Party people I like to see you dance 
 Party people, yeah 
 Party people I like to see you dance 
 Party people, move 
 Party people I like to see you groove 
 This is how we do, this is how we do
