What you thought it was nigga I'm the man round here 
 Hands down man down by my grandma crib 
 On the east 
 Riding round don't be slipping 
 Don't Blood me 'cause whole Long Beach Cripping 
 No cease 
 Firing I'm fired up tripping 
 In A NY fleece wasn't playing no Biggie 
 WCand Trey D keep shit crippy 
 No boot camp clicking we was food stamp flipping 
 Tryna eat 
 1st of the month re'd up 15th 
 Quarter punch ice cream trucks police 
 Stay tryna lock niggas up 
 Foes wacking out the set then we shot niggas up 
 No peace 
 No love not not clicking up 
 Swapmeet whites and a Glock in the trunk 
 OG's tryna tell a nigga 'bout the game 
 But it don't add up 'cause the Crippin' not the same on me 
 Yeah, it don't add up 'cause the Crippin' not the same 
 Yeah, it don't add up 'cause the Crippin' not the same 
 Yeah, it don't add up 'cause the Crippin' not the same 
 Yeah, it don't add up 'cause the Crippin' not the same 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong 
 Well I was born by the river not baptized in it 
 Loose lips sink ships who capsize quicker 
 Not we 
 Stay low-key no snitching 
 Since soul glo dripping and the sherm stick dipping 
 Tread light 
 Snakes gone bite on sight 
 Niggas battle with the judge like the gavel got a grudge 
 Face life 
 Still fight never been a punk 
 Chase dough hoe never get enough lemme tell you 'bout the flocks 
 Looking for the tents mama gotta pay the rent 
 Kicking in the back door tell me where it is 
 Come up out the safe or its coming out the clip 
 And I don't hesitate washing money like the sins 
 Attention getters hit detention centers 
 Before I break the bank, boy ill break and enter 
 Both ears to the streets listen in a drought 
 'Cause when money coming niggas get to showing out 
 When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out 
 When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out 
 When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out 
 When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong 
 Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man 
 Pimp hand strong
