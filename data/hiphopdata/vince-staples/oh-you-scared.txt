Nigga, what's the deal? Pay attention 
 Most the time that I've been living we been public housing tenants 
 Never had no pot to piss so bitch excuse me if I brag a lot 
 Niggas never had a shot unless you talking .38 that Wak had got 
 Can't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught 
 But you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still 
 So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison 
 Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby 
 My temper short, that anger made me have days in court 
 In my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse 
 Got student loans and you failed the course 
 Of course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out 
 Niggas been turnt up, no need to stop now 
 Speed up, skeet up then air the block out 
 El Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat 
 Once you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes 
 Make him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys 
 Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 You getting bread, ain't ya? 
 You getting bread, ain't ya? 
 Ain't ya? Ain't ya? 
 (Nigga, where my money at?) 
 If Illuminati buying souls and only fear was dying broke 
 God who made my life this hard so hell where we decide to go 
 Could you really judge us knowing us then close to what was given 
 Father up in prison, Jesus here, but he ain't struggle wit us 
 The church only made shit worse 
 The money we was given ain't go to God 
 Mostly nice cars that Reverends could sit in, destined for jail 
 We just some niggas facing sentence, we sitting at a standstill 
 You broke, but you the man still trying to find your plan still 
 Two kids and mo' bills, food stamps and dope deals, hood life with no frills 
 But still they swear they feel you and never been close to near you 
 Once who preach protect and serve the main ones trying to kill you 
 It ain't no path to life, no prepping for no afterlife 
 It ain't no wrong or right, it's just the shit you do and shit you don't 
 Friends that's killing niggas is the only ones you praying for 
 But words, they never stopped no bullet 
 Oh, you scared, nigga? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 Oh, you scared, ain't ya? 
 You getting bread, ain't ya? 
 You getting bread, ain't ya? 
 Ain't ya? Ain't ya? 
 (Nigga, where my money at?)
