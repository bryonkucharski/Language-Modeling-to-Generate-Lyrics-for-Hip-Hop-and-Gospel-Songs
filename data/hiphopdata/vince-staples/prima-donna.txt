Kick cack ce cool, watch a nigga get it 
 I be all around the city with the semi naughty crippin' 
 All the homies say I'm different, police say I raise suspicion 
 Buy a million dollar home and blow my dome to paint the kitchen 
 Bitches like, "Is that Venetian?" 
 Niggas salty when they meet him 
 'Cause they never finna beat him 
 And they'll never get a feature 
 I'm a star, tell Billy I'ma bill him for the sneakers 
 You conversin' with a nigga, better be about the green 
 I've been broke, I ain't goin' back 
 Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back 
 Call me King Latifah 
 If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper 
 Better keep her in the house 
 Watch your mouth 
 Don't be talkin' from the bleachers, nigga 
 Is it real? 
 Is it? Is it real? 
 Is it real? 
 Real, real 
 Is it? Is it real? 
 Is it real, real? Is it it real? 
 Real, real, real 
 Real, real, real 
 Real, real, real 
 Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Is it real? 
 I just wanna be DaVinci baby 
 Why they wanna kill me baby? 
 Feelin' like a pop star, music drive a nigga crazy 
 Think I'm finna pull a Wavves on the Primavera stage 
 On some prima donna shit, finna throw it all away 
 I don't need no accolades, boy I'm here to act a fool 
 Ask about me, had the shotty, robbin' niggas at the school 
 Me and Pac Slimm, we been shootin' since the Vans song 
 Pullin' any trigger that a nigga got his hands on 
 Lookin' at my vida, all this money, all these visas 
 All these mothafuckin' mini mes I know they wanna be him 
 Either with it or against it nigga, ain't no in-betweenin' 
 If you say you wanna kill the man then dump it when you see him pussy 
 Is it real? 
 Is it? Is it real? 
 Is it real? 
 Real, real 
 Is it? Is it real? 
 Is it real, real? Is it it real? 
 Real, real, real 
 Real, real, real 
 Real, real, real 
 Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Is it real? 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Once you get addicted to it 
 Little sunshine 
 Fed up with the gun violence 
 Fed up with the old rules 
 Fed up with the youth dyin' 
 I just wanna live forever 
 I just wanna live forever 
 I just wanna live forever 
 I just wanna live forever 
 Fed up with the songs singin' 
 Fed up with the gang bangin' 
 Fed up with the same things 
 Fed up with my life changin' 
 I just wanna show you better 
 I just wanna show you better 
 I just wanna show you better 
 I just wanna show you better
