When the sun goes down 
 When the J goes 'round 
 In the middle of the night 
 Bet your girl goes down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down (and the rain) 
 Rain come down 
 Dod ya man lay down? 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 (Rain come down) 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 (Rain come down) 
 I'm the man, ten toes in the street 
 I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose on the Sphinx 
 Where I'm from we don't go to police 
 Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat 
 I'm the back of the bus, take a seat 
 Take a ride on my side where we die in the street 
 And the cops don't come for some weeks 
 No, the cops don't come for some weeks 
 Riding in a drop top, sun where I think 
 Might get JFK'd, hope not I pray if 
 If so, ain't no thang to a G 
 I feel just like Snoop on Andre Day 
 I run North Side of the beach 
 Run these streets like Ali Bomaye 
 I'm Lou' Bourgeois on the beat 
 Best bet, try not to compete

 Did ya man lay down? 
 Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind 
 Never need a girl to love me, I just need 'em fine 
 On Parisian time, don't be trippin' on a text back 
 In another world, Covergirl, but her chest flat 
 Two page spread in the CR 
 Think it was for Wang 
 Can't remember spring or fall, read it on a plane 
 Long flights playin' with my brain 
 Long nights, long summers we in Spain 
 Car color of La Haine 
 She getting naked under covers for the fame 
 She don't wanna be another what's-her-name 
 Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James 
 Make it rain, in the club 
 Don't you dream of how it feel to be in love? 
 What, you drinking? Need a buzz? 
 Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound 
 When the sun goes down 
 When the J goes 'round 
 In the middle of the night 
 Bet your girl goes down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 Rain come down 
 (And the rain) 
 Rain come down 
 Did ya man lay down? 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 (Rain come down) 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 (Rain come down)
