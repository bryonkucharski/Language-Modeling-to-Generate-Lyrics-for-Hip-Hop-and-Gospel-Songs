Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy 
 My mama caused another problem when she had me 
 They found another dead body in the alley 
 They found another dead body in the alleyway 
 Stackin' paper, I'm a gangsta like my granny 
 It's money over everything if you ask me 
 They found another dead body in the alley 
 They found another dead body in the alleyway 
 I'm stoppin', poppin' like a shootin' guard 
 My seat is back, I'm too relaxed, not movin' out this car 
 I shot your child, so what, you know we wildin' after dark 
 The sun come down and guns come out, you know Ramona Park 
 Bandana brown, my skin is brown, I'm fightin' wit' the law 
 We runnin' 'round the city, east, west and the north 
 G check, better leap if you feelin' frog 
 You wit' the shit, getcho feet wet wit' the sharks 
 Not a choice in my heart 
 Choose to fly or fall, oh 
 So if you fall, it might hurt 
 Choose to fly or fall 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Birds and the bees, they wannabes 
 They'll never fuck wit' me 
 Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy
