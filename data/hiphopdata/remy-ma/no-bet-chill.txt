Fuck outta here, nigga 
 No bet chill 
 See the girls back home like mulberry 
 Now they call me Hag and Daaz 'cause I got ice 
 I got cream in my car cherry, Remy Ma ready 
 And not to contradict my name 
 See I don't really like to play the bar heavy 
 I'ma pothead, so even if my eyes not red 
 I ain't got an enemy that's not dead 
 Oh, you a hothead, I'll leave your head hot 
 You know, I got lead when you see that red dot 
 And plus I'm dead nice, these bitches dead not 
 My chain Flinstone, bracelet bedrock 
 And when I'm not in Miami, it's hot like Miami 
 I got twin glocks call 'em cotton and candy 
 I got cousins that get it poppin' named Tequila and Brandy 
 I spent like 10 thousand just shoppin' for panties 
 Know these bitches can't stand me, catch me hoppin' out that Cadi 
 Shawty gased up 'cause I'm frontin' and I'm callin' him daddy 
 If he ain't a nigga then I'm like no bet chill 
 If he don't keep it hood, I'm like no bet chill 
 If he ain't actin' right, if he ain't packin' like 9 inches 
 Then I'm like, yeah right, no bet chill 
 If he ain't gettin' dough then I'm like no bet chill 
 He don't want me to smoke and like no bet chill 
 He tying stupid shit like I'm a groupie bitch 
 Then I'm gon' flip yeah right, no bet chill 
 Homie, I ain't impressed 'cause you dropped 450 on a New Jersey

 But I'm from South Bronx, muthafucka, you heard me 
 I can tell you a bird 'cause you get up to early 
 You actin', askin' who's really that bitch 
 I know a fever when I see it you ain't really that sick

 Can tell you in your 40s like you pushin' 40 
 Got like 4 kids and trynna be somebody's shawty, stop 
 You really need to lay off the cock 
 Y'all bitches Bacardi Breezers and I'm Remy on the rocks 
 Watch and I ain't talkin' 'bout a chain or a watch 
 I'm talkin' sum Joey crack shit, I'm 'bout to get a match 
 And you know the summer comin' I can use another drop 
 Got the ghetto barbie but I got a lil' pop, pop 
 If he ain't a nigga then I'm like no bet chill 
 If he don't keep it hood, I'm like no bet chill 
 If he ain't actin' right or if he ain't packin' like 9 inches 
 Then I'm like, yeah right, no bet chill 
 If he ain't gettin' dough then I'm like no bet chill 
 He don't want me to smoke and I'm like no bet chill 
 He tying stupid shit like I'm a groupie bitch 
 Then I'm gon' flip yeah right, no bet chill 
 See I know how to rhyme and I'm nice on the mic 
 And I know how to ride 'cause I'm nice on them bikes 
 And not for nothin', I'm the type to wife 
 See I can cook and clean but I like to fight 
 I had this shawty like to bite I called 'em Iron Mike 
 Changed it to Jack Frost 'cause he started buyin' ice 
 If I'm lyin', I'm flyin', never catch me cryin' 
 You'd think I was down with the clipse the way I be grindin' 
 See a lot of chics is sick but I'm the sickest one 
 I got 99 problems but a dick ain't one 
 I got 99 guns and I still ain't done 
 Until this day I wish that I could bring back Pun 
 Yeah, I know you can't take it, kid 
 See, it wears the pants in this relationship 
 But you gotta love me 'cause I'm so real 
 When bitches try to hate 'em, like no bet chill 
 If he ain't a nigga then I'm like no bet chill 
 If he don't keep it hood, I'm like no bet chill 
 If he ain't actin' right or if he ain't packin' like 9 inches 
 Then I'm like, yeah right, no bet chill 
 If he ain't gettin' dough then I'm like no bet chill 
 He don't want me to smoke and I'm like no bet chill 
 He tying stupid shit like I'm a groupie bitch
