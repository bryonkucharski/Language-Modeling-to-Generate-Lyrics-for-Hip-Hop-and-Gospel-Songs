See, this ain't nuttin that you use to 
 Out of the ordinary, unusual 
 You gotta have the mind state like "I'm so great" 
 Can't nobody do it like you do 
 Miraculous, phenomenal 
 And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you 
 Show no love 'cause you wassup 
 Look at yaself in the mirror like what the fuck 
 Damn, I look good 
 And can't nobody freak it like I could 
 Yeah, OK, I got a little fat, but 
 My shorty told me that he like it like that 
 I'm happy 
 Another me there never can be 
 See, I'm so outstandin' 
 Don't care if they can't stand me 
 I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy 
 See, I look too good for this necklace 
 And I look too good to be wearing this 
 You know I look way too good to be innocent 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason 
 See, I look way too good to be driving that 
 And I look too good to be buying that 
 You know I look way too good to be trying that 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason 
 Now who's that peaking in my window? 
 Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse 
 Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy 
 And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see 
 This kid that I'm waitin' on 
 He said he love when my jeans look painted on 
 Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me 
 Probably why I'm always getting hated on 
 Now shorty trynna push up on me like a Wonderbra 
 Listen, when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong 
 Now number one, I don't need you 
 Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you 
 Listen two, you can never play me 
 (Why is that? Why is that?) 
 'Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady 
 Three, it's all about me and I don't wanna talk about it 
 If you love to hear it, here it go 
 I wrote a song about it 
 See, I look too good to be fucking you 
 And I look too good to be loving you 
 You know I look way too good to stuck with you 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason 
 See, I look too good to be gettin' with 
 And I look too good to be havin' kids 
 You know I look way too good to be in the crib 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I don't know what I'm doing 
 I can't stop, my body gone moving 
 I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music 
 He's watching me and he's about to lose it 
 I'm droppin' that hotta den drop it like its hot 
 Face down, ass up wit some new shit 
 I'm outta control wit it 
 Dip it low, pick it up slow, poke it out, now roll wit it 
 My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit it 
 Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it 
 See, I look good and I'm knowin' it 
 But I was never to proud to be showin it 
 See, I look too good for this necklace 
 And I look too good to be wearing this 
 You know I look way too good to be innocent 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason 
 See, I look way too good to be driving that 
 And I look too good to be buying that 
 You know I look way too good to be trying that 
 I'm conceited. I got a reason
