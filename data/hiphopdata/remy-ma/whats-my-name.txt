She says she love my nature 
 She don't love me, she love my gangsta 
 She don't love me, she love my paper 
 Caught me creepin' with the next door neighbor 
 It wasn't me (If it was, it was) 
 She'll still love me, cause love is love 
 He said he love my body 
 He don't love me, he love my punanny 
 I'm in love with the things that he buy me 
 Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby 
 It wasn't me, (If it was, it was) 
 He'll still love me, cause love is love 
 Now what's my name? (Daddy) 
 What's my name? (Daddy) 
 And I still love him even when I'm aggy 
 He has me wrapped around his finger 
 And in my cell phone, he got his own ringer 
 Now, sometimes he get heated 
 And I know he don't mean it 
 But as much as he accused me, 
 I should have cheated 
 And even if I cheated, he wouldn't believe it 
 Cause right after I read it, messages gets deleted 
 And I know we even but, I don't never see it 
 When I step on the scene, the groupies gotta beat it 
 He caught, it's cool, but we break up 
 New bag, new shoes, and we make up 
 He buy me diamonds, that's my darling 
 Guess I really believe that he sorry 
 As far as I can see, he called for me 
 How could I not accept his apology 
 She says she love my nature 
 She don't love me, she love my gangsta 
 She don't love me, she love my paper 
 Caught me creepin' with the next door neighbor 
 It wasn't me (If it was, it was) 
 She'll still love me, cause love is love 
 He said he love my body 
 He don't love me, he love my punanny 
 I'm in love with the things that he buy me 
 Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby 
 It wasn't me, (If it was, it was) 
 He'll still love me, cause love is love 
 Now what's my name? (Baby) 
 What's my name? (Baby) 
 And once I get it, I'm gone, I'm Swayze 
 I do the damn thang and I run 
 I knew she was a freak, 'cause she had an earring in her tongue 
 Cop a whip, I cop rims, I'm not those dudes 
 How you gonna buy a suit and don't cop no shoes 
 Put the sugarfoot inside her stomach 
 Man I have her climbing up the wall like Spider-Woman 
 She gon' ride through the hood on back of the motorcycle 
 Sexy, she got more thighs than the Bible 
 Can't tell a woman you love her, are you stupid? 
 Words don't express your love, you gotta prove it 
 A man give you his trust, you can't abuse it 
 Annalyze your choice before you choosin' 
 Ask Snoop Dogg, I let it bang 
 I got the hardest chick in the game screaming my name 
 She says she love my nature 
 She don't love me, she love my gangsta 
 She don't love me, she love my paper 
 Caught me creepin' with the next door neighbor 
 It wasn't me (If it was, it was) 
 She'll still love me, cause love is love 
 He said he love my body 
 He don't love me, he love my punanny 
 I'm in love with the things that he buy me 
 Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby 
 It wasn't me, (If it was, it was) 
 He'll still love me, cause love is love
