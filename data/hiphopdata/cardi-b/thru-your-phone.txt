Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone 
 Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click 
 And fuck your little fake ass friends 
 Come around actin' like they my bros 
 I seen y'all little group texts 
 Where you all like to brag about your hoes 
 And you can tell your little bitch 
 I screenshotted all her naked pics 
 Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man? 
 Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram? 
 Little bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus 
 I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers 
 Smash your TV from Best Buy 
 You gon' turn me into into Left Eye 
 I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy 
 I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me 
 I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me 
 How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me? 
 My heart is beating like it's bleeding out 
 (You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping) 
 You sleeping like a baby 
 Everyone was right about you now, and 
 (You creeping, you creeping, you creeping) 
 I went through your phone last night 
 I went through your phone last night 
 Saw some things I didn't like 
 I went through your phone last night 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh 
 All I can see is you and her in different scenarios 
 Beyoncé on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat 
 I'ma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach 
 Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit" 
 Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah? 
 You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar? 
 You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches 
 You don't even cheat with no badder bitches 
 This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully 
 Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbing you 
 Don't even know that you this close to dyin' 
 You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?" 
 My heart is beating like it's bleeding out 
 (You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping) 
 You sleeping like a baby 
 Everyone was right about you now, and 
 (You creeping, you creeping, you creeping) 
 I went through your phone last night 
 I went through your phone last night 
 Saw some things I didn't like 
 I went through your phone last night 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh 
 It's killing me 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh 
 It's killing me 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh 
 It's killing me 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh 
 It's killing me 
 I went through your phone last night 
 I went through your phone last night 
 Saw some things I didn't like 
 I went through your phone last night 
 It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh
