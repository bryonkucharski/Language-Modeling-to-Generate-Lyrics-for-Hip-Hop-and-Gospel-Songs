Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose 
 Used to dance in a club right across from my school 
 I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused 
 Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume 
 Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's 
 Lord only knows how I got it in shows 
 I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels 
 A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food 
 Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool 
 Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news 
 I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views 
 Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs 
 Get money, go hard, you're motherfuckin' right 
 Never been a fraud in my motherfuckin' life 
 Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right 
 Stunt on these bitches out of motherfuckin' spite 
 Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory 
 I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story 
 I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny 
 And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me 
 I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga 
 Only person in my fam to see six figures 
 The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders 
 When you gotta make sure that everybody straight 
 Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face 
 Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case 
 I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas 
 Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas 
 Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (bangers) 
 Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop) 
 The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt) 
 That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer 
 You gon' run up on who and do what? (who?) 
 I think y'all got your story screwed up (yeah) 
 I came here to ball, is you nuts? 
 I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (facts) 
 I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (hands down) 
 If you got a problem with me, say it now (say it) 
 'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (huh?) 
 'Specially not from one you weak bitches 
 I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (skrrt) 
 I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (facts) 
 So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?) 
 'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like 
 Beast, mode, that's how I give it up, nigga 
 Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up 
 Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run 
 And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo) 
 And we all know you ain't that type (no) 
 I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah) 
 I started gettin' money, bitches upset (cash) 
 They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight 
 Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced) 
 Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (shine) 
 He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case 
 Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08 
 I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch) 
 Whole life been through some fucked up shit (fucked up) 
 They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this 
 When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this (woo) 
 I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" (where the check?) 
 Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that 
 Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?) 
 I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at 
 They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild) 
 I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (bad ass child, skrrt) 
 They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (try that now) 
 Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (blap!) 
 Man, I said we gon' win 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten 
 Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten 
 Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten 
 Yeah, but I get up ten 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (woo) 
 I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (yeah) 
 Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (ah) 
 I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (grrr) 
 Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (grrr) 
 We gon' win 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten (woo) 
 Yeah, I said we gon' win 
 Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (grrr)
