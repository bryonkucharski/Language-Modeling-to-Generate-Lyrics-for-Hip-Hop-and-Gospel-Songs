Ooh, ooh 
 Ring, ring, ring, ring 
 You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh 
 You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I can't keep this on the low 
 I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Should I call first? I can't decide 
 I want to, but a bitch got pride 
 The switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with 
 I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with 
 And you ain't hit me up in a while 
 Actin' like you don't know what number to dial 
 You quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel 
 'Cause a nigga only goin' through what you allow 
 You don't want this gun smoke 
 Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke 
 I don't care if we gettin' to it and I stall on your ass 
 But I still wake up from missed calls from your ass, nigga 
 You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh 
 You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I can't keep this on the low 
 I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 Nah, nigga now you gon' have to call me (call me) 
 'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they all me (yeah) 
 Actin' like they ain't niggas that want me 
 Let another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot nigga coffee 
 You gon' be sick to your, stomach 
 Hit me when you free, 1-800 
 It's emergency, call me 911 
 'Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone 
 The ring on my phone, ring on my finger (brrr) 
 You actin' like you ain't tryna do either (yeah) 
 What's a good girl? Watch me turn diva 
 Here goes my heart, I put it on speaker (oh) 
 You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh 
 You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 I can't keep this on the low 
 I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
 You used to be on my line 
 On my tick all the time, yeah 
 Love it when you make me feel 
 Like you don't mind when I ain't got time for you 
 You know it don't go to my head, I'm only here again in bed 
 I just love to know you wanna spend time with me instead 
 Now you all caught up, yeah 
 You all caught up and you done left me alone, yeah 
 You was all fed up 
 Ready for the next step, wanna be on your own 
 Said I just miss you, I just miss us, baby 
 All I know is 
 You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh 
 You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring (you don't make it ring, baby) 
 I can't keep this on the low (yeah, yeah, oh) 
 I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring
