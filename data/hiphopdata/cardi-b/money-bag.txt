Money bag, money bag 
 Money bag, bitch, I'm lookin' like a money bag 
 Money bag 
 Cardi 
 I do the Maybach on Monday, Ferrari Friday 
 This is sweet pussy Saturday, that's just what Plies say 
 I said "Bae, it's a snack," he said it's a entrée 
 With them pretty ass twins, you look like Beyoncé 
 Lookin' like money bag, money bag, money bag, uh 
 (Money bag, money bag, money bag, yeah) 
 Money bag, money bag, money bag, uh 
 (Money bag, money bag, money bag) 
 He can tell from the front I got ass behind me 
 And I park my Bentley truck on my Versace driveway (Skrrt) 
 Lookin' like money bag, money bag, money bag, uh 
 (Money bag, money bag, money bag, yeah) 
 Money bag, money bag, money bag, woo 
 (Money bag, money bag, money bag) 
 And my bitches with me pretty, too, they look like bridesmaids 
 And they all bloody gang so don't be talkin' sideways 
 He said I'm protein thick, you look like a dope fiend, sis 
 He make sure he put Cardi down on his grocery list 
 Now why this bitch tryna look on my Snap? 
 I take your man and I won't give him back 
 I just walk into the booth and attack 
 I hit this grind, the roof gon' collapse 
 I been broke my whole life, I have no clue what to do with these racks 
 Wig be laid, waist snatched, ass fat, straight facts 
 Got lips like Angelina, Bentley truck tangerine, uh 
 Tramps jumpin' on my dick, that's why they call it trampoline, uh

 These bitches salty, they sodium, they jelly, petroleum 
 Always talkin' in the background, don't never come to the podium 
 Chef Cardi B, I'm cookin' up, I see you hoes at the stove again 
 While you hoes were sleepin' on me, I made 40 bands by 4pm 
 They be taking shots, miss miss, X and O, kiss kiss 
 Everythin' your nigga want, I'm like a walkin' wishlist 
 I don't understand what this hate is about 
 How you gon' suck yo' man dick with my name in yo' mouth?
