Yeah 
 Be careful, be careful, be careful with me 
 Yeah, look 
 I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit 
 But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit 
 Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit 
 Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit 
 Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson 
 'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts 
 I guess it's fine, man, I get the message 
 You still stutter after certain questions 
 You keep in contact with certain exes 
 Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though 
 Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo 
 And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives 
 I could've did what you did to me to you a few times 
 But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga 
 Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed 
 But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch 
 And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with 
 Don't make me sick, nigga 
 The only man, baby, I adore 
 I gave you everything, what's mine is yours 
 I want you to live your life of course 
 But I hope you get what you dyin' for 
 Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'? 
 Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'? 
 You gon' gain the whole world 
 But is it worth the girl that you're losin'? 
 Be careful with me 
 Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin' 
 Be careful with me 
 Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it 
 Be careful with me 
 Care for me, care for me 
 Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me 
 Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look 
 I was here before all of this 
 Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience 
 Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates? 
 You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga 
 Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head 
 You want some random bitch up in your bed? 
 She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain 
 You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though 
 It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met 
 Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget 
 You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different 
 Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent 
 Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt 
 It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse 
 It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up 
 Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck 
 Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt 
 'Cause you don't care about a thing except your motherfuckin' self 
 You make me sick, nigga 
 The only man, baby, I adore 
 I gave you everything, what's mine is yours 
 I want you to live your life of course 
 But I hope you get what you dyin' for 
 Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'? 
 Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'? 
 You gon' gain the whole world 
 But is it worth the girl that you're losin'? 
 Be careful with me 
 Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin' 
 Be careful with me 
 Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it 
 Be careful with me
