I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it 
 Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket 
 Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine 
 No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I think us bad bitches is a gift from God (gift from God) 
 I think you broke hoes need to get a job (get a job) 
 Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi) 
 Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex 
 I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it 
 Gucci shoes and a belt like it 
 Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance 
 I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it 
 I'm in a boss bitch mood, ay, these heels are Givenchy, ho 
 These are some boss bitch shoes, if you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay 
 For the record, I set records, record sales 
 I like niggas that been in and outta jail 
 They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell) 
 My little 15 minutes lasting long as hell, huh? 
 I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it 
 Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket 
 Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine 
 No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 Look, broke hoes do what they can (can) 
 Good girls do what they told (told) 
 Bad bitches do what they want (they want) 
 That's why a bitch is so cold 
 I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed 
 Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest 
 The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it 
 I'm provocative, it's my prerogative 
 80K just to know what time is it 
 Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it 
 Spent what I want, ain't no limit 
 I say what I want, I ain't never been timid 
 Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it 
 Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue 
 Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through 
 Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none) 
 If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum 
 I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it 
 Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket 
 Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine 
 No wonder wonder why I do whatever I like 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do 
 I do what I like, I do, I do
