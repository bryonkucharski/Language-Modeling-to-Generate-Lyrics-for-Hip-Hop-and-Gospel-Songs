I'm livin' my best life, yeah, yeah 
 I'm livin' my best life 
 Made a couple M's, you know (IGH! Huh!) 
 Said I'm livin' my best life 
 Said I'm livin' my best life 
 Made a couple M's with my best friends 
 Turned all my L's into lessons 
 You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
 Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt" 
 I'm livin' my best life 
 It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like 
 I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (yeah) 
 You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (woo) 
 Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry 
 Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh) 
 I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah) 
 Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this 
 To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this" 
 I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash 
 Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash 
 That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash 
 "#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag 
 I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad 
 They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash 
 I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh 
 Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself 
 I'm my own competition, I'm competin' with myself (brrr)

 You don't like money, I can see it your eye 
 You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie 
 Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly 
 She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night 
 But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life 
 Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life 
 We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses 
 You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike 
 God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life 
 And that guap look like Iyanla 'cause that bag just changed my life 
 Hey, y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne 
 But can we please get some more champagne? 
 Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy 
 Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yoncé 
 'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii 
 Now they hold cash, won't peak like Dante

 It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like 
 I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me 
 Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy 
 Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me 
 'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me 
 But never did I change, never been ashamed 
 Never did I switch, story stayed the same 
 I did this on my own, I made this a lane 
 Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things 
 Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets 
 Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored 
 This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit 
 I got further than them hoes said I will ever get 
 And that only goes to show that only God knows 
 I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles 
 I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls 
 I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ay 
 I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
