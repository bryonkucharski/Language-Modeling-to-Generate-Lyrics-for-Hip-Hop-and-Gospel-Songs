(K. Terroribul) 
 I get Alzheimer's listen to your biblical writers 
 And biters to fibbers like your motion picture script writers 
 Should I be pausin for a moment over lost sinners 
 Or givin' chase toward the invisible tormentor 
 Who - permitted more false allegations than a forfeiter 
 Don't get it wrong, cause existin manuscripts differ 
 Ghostly disappeared into the mountainside 
 Then reappeared to heap fear to keep the average rapper circumcised 
 How could this deal even commence nice 
 When my rhymes just to keep a cent, higher than yo' list price 
 A proefficient, most extravagant rapper imaginable and different 
 Still A&R's haven't listened and they're slow pokes 
 With audacity to be rhymin with these grown folks? 
 Y'all newcomes got jokes 
 Be polite, I was, I'm representin Bronx niggaz that's inspirers 
 Now competition seems quieter 
 Forget the clues, I got critics sayin' who's you? 
 Even rappers singin' the blues if they ain't on they P's and Q's 
 I be the uh... lyrical lord almighty 
 Top emperor want a demonstration BLAOW there you were
