Why are you looking at me like that? 
 I do not feel a very good vibe 
 Why are you pushing me away? 
 Now It's not like I really want to stay 
 Oh I, I might be small 
 But it doesn't mean I can't reach the sky 
 I, I might be weak 
 But it doesn't mean you can knock me down 
 Don't Dress me Up 
 I'm already dressed 
 Do you like my shoes? 
 Why are you turning away? 
 You haven't seen nothing yet 
 Don't Dress me Up 
 I'm already dressed 
 Do you like my shoes? 
 Why are you turning away? 
 You haven't seen nothing yet 
 Why aren't you giving me a chance 
 I have a way of my own 
 Why are you being so damn crude 
 Hey look! You are a human being like me 
 Oh I, I might trip and fall 
 But it doesn't mean I don't know how to stand tall 
 I, Don't look like her 
 But I am glad as hell I am, who I am 
 Don't Dress me Up 
 I'm already dressed 
 Do you like my shoes? 
 Why are you turning away? 
 You haven't seen nothing yet 
 Don't Dress me Up 
 I'm already dressed 
 I've got something to say 
 You don't know what I can do 
 And you don't know who I am 
 Don't Tear me Up 
 Into many pieces 
 You can't touch my soul 
 You better get used to it 
 Cause, I'm not going no where 
 Don't Dress me Up 
 I'm already dressed 
 Do you like my shoes? 
 Why are you turning away? 
 You haven't seen nothing yet
