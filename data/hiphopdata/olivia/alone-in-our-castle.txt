So the siren went off 
 It chased you out of your mind 
 Just when I started to grow a garden 
 How selfish of me 
 But I need something to build onto 
 You can't leave me here 
 Alone in our castle 
 Alone in everything we have 
 I'll never see your face 
 The way it is in our castle 
 So I kidnapped your sweet sparrow 
 So I am dancing around on your pain 
 The hallways echo your longing 
 We both know what needs to be done 
 But something's holding on 
 Alone in our castle 
 Alone in everything we have 
 I'll never feel your skin 
 The way I do in our castle 
 Love, oh love 
 I want to believe in love 
 I want to believe this feeling 
 That I feel deeply for you 
 But if you can't, turn away and go 
 Don't turn back, and I'll do the same 
 Alone in our castle 
 Alone in everything we have 
 I'll never see your face 
 The way it is in our castle 
 Alone in our castle 
 Alone in everything we have 
 I'll never feel your skin 
 The way I do in our castle
