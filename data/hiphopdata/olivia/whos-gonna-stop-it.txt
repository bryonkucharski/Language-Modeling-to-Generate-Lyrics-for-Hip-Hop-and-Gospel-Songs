Someone's heart is breaking 
 I don't think it's funny 
 Power in hands of corruption 
 Stepping on our rights 
 What about the people 
 Who lost their loved ones? 
 Unnoticed unrightfulness 
 What makes you think 
 You're better than they are? 
 'Cause to me we're all the same 
 Will this fighting ever stop? 
 Twisted pattern from the past 
 Pass it down from the parents to the young 
 When is it gonna stop? 
 When is it gonna stop? 
 Who's gonna stop it, gonna stop it? 
 Let me love you 
 I don't wanna fight no more 
 Let me touch you 
 I don't wanna fight no more 
 Let me love you, love you, love you 
 I don't wanna fight no more 
 I think the greatest thing you can learn 
 Is to be kind 
 To every person in this world, 
 To everything in this universe 
 Will this fighting ever stop? 
 One side give the other side momentum 
 To throw another hit 
 Back and forth, back and forth 
 Feed each others existence 
 It never stops, never stops 
 Who's gonna, who's gonna stop it? 
 Let me love you 
 I don't wanna fight no more 
 Let me touch you 
 I don't wanna fight no more 
 Let me love you, love you, love you 
 I don't wanna fight no more
