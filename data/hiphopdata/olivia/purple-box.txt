I trap myself into a tiny purple box 
 I stick a straw through a hole 
 So I can breathe 
 I got no other place to go, you see 
 I got no other place to go 
 This is what I learned to do 
 This is my, this is my home to me 
 I decide to cut a bigger hole with a fork 
 So I can get a view of what's going on 
 I put my ear up against the box 
 And wait till it's silent 
 Then carefully push the hole out 
 And set foot on the ground 
 But then all these ants start to crawl up my legs 
 I roll into a hole 
 Where 18 red eyed rabbits with hatchets 
 Take me prison and force feed me carrots 
 Throw me out into a river 
 I got no other place to go, you see 
 I got no other place to go 
 This is what I learned to do 
 This is my, this is my home to me 
 I got no other place to go, you see 
 I got no other place to go 
 This is what I learned to do 
 This is my, this is my home to me
