優雅に踊る in a 無傷の Diamond 
 Where it protects her 
 涙と pink marigold dreams 
 はざ間でもがく彼女は 
 太陽を振り向かせる 
 It lights the stage for her 
 Ballerina 
 Show them who you are 
 Ballerina 
 Show them who you are 
 You have been waiting for this 
 Isn't this what you wanted? 
 Why are you crying? 
 現実と glass oil paintings 
 間で生きる彼女を 
 誰も理解しようとしない 
 They are afraid of chance 
 Ballerina 
 Show them who you are

 Show them who you are 
 涙と pink marigold dreams 
 はざ間でもがく彼女は 
 太陽を振り向かせる 
 It lights the stage for her
