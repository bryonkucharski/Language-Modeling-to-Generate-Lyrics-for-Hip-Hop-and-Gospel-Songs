It is telling me that 
 I can not escape 
 It is telling me that 
 I can not forget 
 Just like a broken record, repeating it to me 
 You're getting my attention 
 It makes me weary 
 Oh you're so strong 
 You get stronger when I, 
 Stronger when I believe you 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 It is telling me that 
 I am gonna choke 
 It is telling me that 
 I am strange 
 Just like a broken record, repeating it to me 
 Comparing always comparing 
 I can't take it 
 You live off my compassion 
 I am the one 
 That keeps you alive 
 I feel you pull me under 
 Fall into your trap 
 Now you're taking control of me 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 Cut me free memorizing monster 
 When you fall asleep 
 The ropes come undone 
 I feel the wind hit my face 
 If only I can be here all the time
