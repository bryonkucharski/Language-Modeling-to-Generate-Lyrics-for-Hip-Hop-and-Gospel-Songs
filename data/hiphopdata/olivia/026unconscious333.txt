You don't fall on your face now 
 I'm gonna get out of routine 
 Say, I'm not gonna be on a leash 
 Everybody say, say 
 I wanna be 
 You don't fall on your face 
 I'm gonna get out of routine 
 Say, I'm not gonna be on a leash 
 Not gonna be on a leash 
 Spend our days in a dream 
 Getting along together 
 We won't need rules 
 Our mind will take us 
 Where we want to go 
 Find a new way to survive 
 Create a passage 
 For a world illuminant 
 Transforming our history 
 Find a new way to survive 
 Create a passage 
 For a world illuminant

 Everybody say, say 
 I wanna be 
 You don't fall on your face 
 I'm gonna get out of routine
