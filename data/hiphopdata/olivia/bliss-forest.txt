Crashing Contour 
 China Luna 
 Synchro Halo 
 Makes me tingle 
 I know that I was dragging you 
 Through unknown places 
 But you have to trust me my love, 
 Cause in my heart there's only you 
 Now I know the rain is gone 
 To a far off land 
 Now I want to bring you here 
 Towards the wishing well 
 You gotta make a wish now 
 I'm no warrior 
 Bless you candy
