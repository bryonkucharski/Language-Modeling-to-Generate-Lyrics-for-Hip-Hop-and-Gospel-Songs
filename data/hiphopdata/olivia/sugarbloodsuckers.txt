Sell your soul for cash 
 Sell your soul for life 
 Everybody needs to make money 
 Everybody needs to feed their children 
 But even though we have enough 
 We continue for more 
 Everybody wants to be rich 
 Everybody wants to rich 
 Everybody 
 We're fucking animals 
 We're fucking animals 
 We're fucking, fucking 
 Fucking animals 
 We're fucking animals 
 We're fucking animals 
 We're fucking, fucking 
 Sugarbloodsuckers 
 Look at what we do to each other for ourselves 
 Look closely 
 You think you're innocent? 
 Look closely 
 We've created a world 
 It's our world 
 Confusion 
 This can't be real 
 This can't be real
