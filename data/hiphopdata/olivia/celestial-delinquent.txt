You live in a home 
 With running water and a 
 Air conditioner and T.V. 
 You have nothing to give and 
 You have nothing to say 
 So you sing-a-ling-a-long 
 Everything is alright 
 How can one person change the world? 
 I have to pay my bills 
 I gotta go to work 
 The earth is dying 
 I am so ashamed 
 We are all to blame 
 We must raise human consciousness 
 I want to be up high up with the sun 
 Disappear completely into love 
 I want to be up high up where I can 
 See the secret roads 
 All you selfish people 
 Who think of nothing but money, 
 Realize how angry and stressed 
 You are all the time 
 When you're angry you only see things 
 From a bad angle 
 That's why you are going crazy 
 That why you feel like shit 
 You'll never find true happiness 
 In this state of mind 
 I want to be up high up with the sun 
 Disappear completely into love 
 I want to be up high up where I can 
 See the secret roads 
 What's most important is 
 Where we were born, where we grow, 
 Where we live 
 Without Earth we are extinct 
 Instead of finding ways to live on other planets, 
 We have to find a way to live on our own 
 Instead of spending so much money on sending space shuttles into space and making weapons for war, 
 Why don't we use it for making solar electricity, homes, cars, appliances 
 Someone is going to have to give in 
 Somebody is going to lose money 
 But we can't be greedy, we can't be lazy 
 We have to learn to give and help each other 
 And rise about this world we created 
 Rise above fear 
 We need to share to save the human race 
 Take the human race into a higher vibration 
 I want to be up high up with the sun 
 Disappear completely into love 
 I want to be up high up where I can 
 See the secret roads
