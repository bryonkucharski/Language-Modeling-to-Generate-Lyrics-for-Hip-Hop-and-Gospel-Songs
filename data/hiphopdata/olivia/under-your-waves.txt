Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more 
 Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more 
 Your drugs, my thrilling intake 
 I take whatever you make 
 Please make me feel our love 
 Touch me under your waves 
 Breathing under your waves 
 Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more 
 Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more 
 Soon you'll find me tipping on the edge 
 Sometimes I wonder how I'd feel 
 If you made me whole, made me safe 
 Touch me under your waves 
 Breathing under your waves 
 Touch me (you come closer to me) 
 Under your waves (when I push you away) 
 Breathing (you come closer to me) 
 Under your waves (when I push you away) 
 Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more 
 Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more
