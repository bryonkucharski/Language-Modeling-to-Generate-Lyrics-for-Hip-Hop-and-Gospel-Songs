I just want to hear a voice 
 I'm peeking through little holes 
 Can anybody hear me? 
 Did I create this on my own? 
 Where do I go? What am I looking for? 
 Where do I go? What more can I do? 
 My Dear Angel I'm crying Please make me just a little more stronger 
 My Dear Angel Can't you see that I'm seriously trying? 
 My Dear Angel 
 Show me I can run Show me that I can fly 
 And show me I can walk through walls 
 Show me I can jump off any building and be fine 
 Every one is running away from me 
 Or am I running from them? 
 Why am I invisible to what's most important to me? 
 Another lesson For me to learn 
 Don't you think I've been a good girl? 
 My Dear Angel Please show me to be happy Please show me a better me 
 My Dear Angel I promise you I'll keep believing 
 My Dear Angel 
 Show me I can run Show me that I can fly 
 And show me I can walk through walls 
 Show me I can play the grand piano with no hands 
 My Dear Angel I'm crying Please make me just a little more stronger 
 My Dear Angel Can't you see that I'm seriously trying? 
 My Dear Angel Outside I'm fine Deep down inside I really can't take it 
 My Dear Angel I'm hurtin' Hold my heart in your hands 
 My Dear Angel 
 I'm not gonna lose No I'm not gonna hide 
 I'm gonna get my ass right up and I'm gonna 
 Show you everything I can do
