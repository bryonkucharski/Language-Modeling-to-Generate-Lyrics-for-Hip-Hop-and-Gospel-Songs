Can I take your time and light on some thoughts of mine? 
 What does it matter the thoughts they think?

 We slowly lose our name trying to stick with society's parade 
 Kouhai bow to you senpai 
 On to your knees

 Your hiding under the name

 Skip to a little number 
 All that you can fade away 
 Skip to a little number

 And jump off society's merry-go-round

 Can I take you to the next stage?

 Take a seat, take it down that drink 
 Drink it down till you 
 Crack a smile up nice and proud 
 Let's all be loud 
 Play the song and 
 Sing along 
 We should 
 Skip to a little number 
 Skip to a little number 
 All that you can fade away 
 Skip to a little number 
 Skip to a little number 
 When you 
 Skip to a little number 
 Skip to a little number
