Hodoketa yume ni arashi ga furu 
 Namae wo yobu koe sagasu 
 Mou aenakute 
 You're fading bit by bit 
 Please don't go faraway 
 Hakanai kisetsu ni 
 Torinokosarete yuku 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You reflect the stronger me 
 You bring out the best in me 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You know what I'm trying to say 
 No need for words 
 Kobore sasu hikari ga yurameku asa ni hitorikiri 
 You're not here 
 Anata ga kureta sabishisa sae 
 Kogoeru hodo mada koishii 
 Tada aitakute 
 I feel your existence 
 Maybe you can feel me, too 
 Ano hi kanadeta 
 Ai no kotoba wo omou 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You are so magical 
 You turn my tears to rainbows 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You comfort me 
 With your ease and openness 
 Kobore ochita ai ga kirameku yakitsuku hodo tsuyoku 
 You're in my heart 
 I miss you 
 You turn my rainbows to tears 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You reflect the stronger me 
 You bring out the best in me 
 I miss you, I miss you 
 You know what I'm trying to say 
 No need for words 
 Kobore sasu hikari ga yurameku asa ni hitorikiri 
 You're not here
