Everyday I bicker with the city life 
 When midnight creeps I spinkle holy water on hints 
 I scrutinize people tread on city lies 
 And they don't even recognize it 
 I slip in between the cracks to hollow chase 
 A time race 
 Embraced by the demons 
 Laced up by the government 
 Feasted by humans 
 Feasted on humans 
 Sweat rush fall under the spell 
 Someone is bound to tell 
 I crucify my beauty psyche 
 Anticipate the return of heed 
 When the doesn't reflect 
 And keeps moving in one direction 
 There's no room for my tension to ease 
 Hesitation cascades 
 Into the roots that branch down 
 Into the earth 
 Magnetize look-a-likes 
 And unconsciously construct a haunted kingdom 
 With perpetual halls 
 I pray to god this is only evanescence 
 I'm riding on a blind unicorn 
 I'm riding on a blind unicorn 
 I'm going to throw up now 
 I have my own ways that I stride 
 And I'm not going to stride along the lines 
 Of your fucking guidance 
 Fuck the apocalypse stars 
 And let me follow my own natural instinct 
 Unlinked from your universe 
 And your curse 
 Immerse my diverse ways of my mind 
 You make things worse 
 When you babble on about staying positive 
 And being good 
 And keeping sane 
 And sleeping right 
 And removing my dirty nail polish 
 You don't think I fucking know that? 
 I'm riding on a blind unicorn 
 I'm riding on a blind unicorn 
 I'm going to throw up now
