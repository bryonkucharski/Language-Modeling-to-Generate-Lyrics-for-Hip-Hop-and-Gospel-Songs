 Music by OLIVIA, Jeffrey Lufkin 
 Arrangement by Jeffrey Lufkin 
 No one is around 
 Your making it all up 
 It's time to disarm yourself 
 Because when you are free 
 And act naturally 
 Something begins to happen 
 Slowly I see you 
 Wake out of a very serious snooz'in 
 Right eye, left eye 
 I feel like on the verge of a big surprise 
 I'm feeling trinka trinka 
 It's really happening 
 My heart is beating steady 
 But I want to scream! 
 Internal carousel cues an upright rainbow 
 Sending out a friendly glimmer 
 I'm feeling trinka trinka 
 It's really happening 
 My heart is beating steady 
 But I want to scream! 
 Calling out on a big shift 
 It knows we are laughing 
 Together we laugh 
 This space is open 
 You're creating in it 
 I know when you're doing it with joy 
 Because it has a shine 
 That no words can explain 
 It reaches out and touches me 
 In your rhythm 
 Some may not understand what you are doing 
 Oh! behave! now 
 All of a sudden anything seems possible 
 I'm feeling trinka trinka 
 It's really happening 
 My heart is beating steady 
 But I want to scream! 
 Possibilities inspiration galore 
 Inhale and exhale at the same time 
 I'm feeling trinka trinka 
 It's really happening 
 My heart is beating steady 
 But I want to scream! 
 Look what is found 
 So much to discover 
 It's never over
