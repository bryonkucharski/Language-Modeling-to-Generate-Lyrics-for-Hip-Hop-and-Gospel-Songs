Farmers in the mid-west need good land 
 For their work so they can grow flowers 
 Farmers in the mid-west need good land 
 For their work so they can grow flowers 
 Crouch down between the walls 
 Bundled up nice and small 
 You walk in with your graceful smile 
 And ask me to grow you a beautiful flower 
 Farmers in the mid-west need good land 
 (Please tell me you're not serious) 
 For their work so they can grow flowers 
 (It's not fair) 
 Farmers in the mid-west need good land 
 (Please tell me you're not serious)

 They want me to grow up 
 Follow the fucking laws 
 So I can live on Earth 
 So I can provide them with 
 A beautiful flower

 How's it gonna grow 
 You expect it to grow 
 How's it gonna grow
