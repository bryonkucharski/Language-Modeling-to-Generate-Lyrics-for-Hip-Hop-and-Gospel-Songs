I see you hiding with your tears 
 This song is written for you 
 It bends into your story 
 Everytime it's played over 
 Energy lifts up from the trees, my heart 
 Fitting the ears listening 
 A golden glitter thread weaving 
 Into the garment of tears 
 Spinning and releasing your thoughts 
 Untucking the moment from your heart 
 Love Love Love 
 Here they come, my lambent fireflies 
 Surrounding you, lighting up your trail 
 Love Love Love 
 Close your eyes, we're all under the same sky 
 You have me 
 Whoever you are 
 I love you. 
 Everyone is included 
 Take your time if you need rest 
 Fall asleep, I'll watch over you 
 You'll wake when you've had enough 
 Energy lifts up from the soil, flowers 
 Turning distress to strength 
 Whatever you do, don't give a damn what they say 
 You are wonderful just the way you are 
 Can't stop what's coming your way 
 Love Love Love 
 From highlands whispering out, calling your name 
 Brightening your north star 
 Love Love Love 
 Close your eyes, let's dance together all night 
 You don't need anything 
 This is real to me 
 Love Love Love 
 From highlands whispering out, calling your name 
 Brightening your north star 
 Love Love Love 
 Here they come, my lambent fireflies 
 Surrounding you, lighting up your trail 
 Love Love Love 
 Close your eyes 
 We're all under the same sky 
 You have me 
 Whoever you are 
 I love you.
