The devil is in me, in me 
 The devil is in me, in me 
 The devil is in me, in me 
 Oh no 
 I must hunt you down 
 Locate your breeding ground 
 Inject it with applesauce 
 Dislocate its shoulder bone 
 The rupture twisted my spectrum 
 Masked my reason 
 Reversed my revelation 
 I have to fish it out 
 I have to mend it up 
 And I got to throw it back 
 I have to be on my way 
 I have to be on my way 
 The devil is in me, in me 
 The devil is in me, in me 
 The devil is in me, in me 
 Oh no 
 Shadow your travels 
 To the way that you preach 
 Penetrate the vessels 
 Then detach the saddle 
 The rupture twisted my spectrum 
 Masked my reason 
 Reversed my revelation 
 I have to fight you off 
 I have to win in out 
 Can't be lackadaisical 
 I have to be on my way 
 I have to be on my way
