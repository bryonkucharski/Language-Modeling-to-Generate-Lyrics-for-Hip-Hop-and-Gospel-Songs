Kiss your trophy 
 Glazed honey de luxe 
 Your coal of instant sparkle 
 Leave all your things behind 
 They will not be of any use 
 果てしない可能性の空間で 
 躍って自分のステップで 
 Don't look back 
 Don't, don't, da-don't look back 
 Don't run ahead 
 Don't, don't, don't run ahead 
 (Come on and shake it now) 
 Let go oh baby 
 (Come on and do it now) 
 Go oh baby 
 (Come on and shake it now) 
 Let go oh baby 
 (Come on and do it now) 
 Go oh baby 
 (Come on and shake it now) 
 Mosquitos printed in your mind 
 Start asking you favors 
 As you were having discussions 
 They secretly sipped your day hollow 
 心の中に在ること 
 気付く瞬間トキハナタレル 
 Don't look back 
 Don't, don't, da-don't look back 
 Don't run ahead 
 Don't, don't, don't run ahead 
 (Come on and shake it now) 
 Let go oh baby 
 (Come on and do it now) 
 Go oh baby 
 (Come on and shake it now) 
 Let go oh baby 
 (Come on and do it now) 
 Go oh baby 
 (Come on and shake it now)
