Child of the sun 
 Changing with the sky 
 Sakura shy 
 December clouds cry 
 Illuminant light illuminate me 
 Illuminant light illuminate me 
 Play me a symphony 
 Dance with me 
 Child of the moon 
 Changing with the tide 
 Up and down 
 The seashore side 
 Illuminant light illuminate me 
 Illuminant light illuminate me 
 With you I find 
 What is me
