I am tripping out on myself 
 I am tripping out on myself 
 I have to watch my thoughts 
 Before they come to life 
 Before they come to life 
 I have to get you out of my head 
 I have to swallow my tongue 
 I have to find where I went 
 Before she comes to life 
 Before she comes to life 
 They're coming to get me 
 She's coming right towards me 
 They're coming to take me away 
 She's getting closer 
 I can't hide my secrets 
 They're listening to me 
 They're always listening to me 
 They're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me 
 She's coming to get me, coming to get me 
 They're coming, she's coming 
 They're coming, coming 
 She's coming, they're coming 
 (Thank you.)
