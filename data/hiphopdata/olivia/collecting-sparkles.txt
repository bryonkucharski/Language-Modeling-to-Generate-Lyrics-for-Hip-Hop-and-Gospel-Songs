 Darling, I'm eager 
 To know of your everlasting beam 
 My melancholy drama has 
 Ultimately puzzled me 
 What is it that you do 
 That makes you the way you are 
 I keep my eye on you 
 Watch what you do 
 Explode! 
 The ground begins to tremble 
 Everybody's screaming 
 No matter how chaotic 
 You always come to show me 
 Collect sparkles 
 In a catastrophe all you can is a shine 
 You pick it up 
 Collect sparkles 
 You find them everywhere 
 They're recognized by you 
 Giving your love to them 
 Catch a sparkle 
 Before you let a flaw 
 Steal this wondrous moment 
 Walls close in on you 
 It's easy getting caught into 
 But when you let them get to you 
 You'll only see 
 One in a million things 
 Shame! 
 That you could strip yourself from this 
 Luscious universe 
 Wake yourself to this 
 Immense luxury 
 Collect sparkles 
 I put them in my pocket 
 They melt into me 
 Feeding me shine 
 Collect sparkles 
 Twinkle in my eye and back to the origin 
 Carrying my heart to 
 Collect sparkles 
 In a catastrophe all you can see is shine 
 You pick it up 
 Collect sparkles 
 You find them everywhere 
 They're recognized by you 
 Giving your love to them
