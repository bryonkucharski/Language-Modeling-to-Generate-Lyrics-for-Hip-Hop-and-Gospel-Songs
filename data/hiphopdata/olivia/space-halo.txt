You tell me that you love me 
 I watch you look out the window 
 Into the luminous blue sky 
 With eyes of loneliness 
 As if you had to go... 
 What will it take to win your smile 
 Does it help for you to know 
 That nothing can break my love for you 
 Believe in me, if you need to believe 
 Look into my eyes 
 Deep into my eyes 
 I wish you would let go 
 Of your space halo 
 Come down here and live 
 With me, live with me 
 The fear begins to creep in 
 The distance begins to grow 
 I can't find the right words to say 
 I need to know it's okay, okay... 
 How am I supposed to hold you at ease 
 How am I supposed to know you love me 
 How am I supposed to hold you at ease 
 How am I supposed to know you love me 
 How am I supposed to hold you at ease 
 How am I supposed to know you love me 
 I wish I could make you truly happy 
 So you would never want to leave this world 
 I wish you would let go 
 Of your space halo 
 Come down here and live 
 With me, live with me
