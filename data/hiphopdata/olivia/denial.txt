Little owls bring me messages 
 Transparent envelopes 
 Given by black daisies 
 And through enormous telescopes 
 Addressed the white crow 
 Sent it out 
 Was it meant to get to me? 
 I can hear you 
 I'm just playing it cool 
 Bones quiver gently 
 Vexing blood river 
 Flux to the tip of my feathers 
 I laugh at your eagerness 
 Fruitful dandelion heartache is repelling you yet 
 How am I to turn around on my own? 
 Who's to blame 
 For what has become? 
 That makes me cry 
 That makes me cry, she says 
 She says 
 (Oh no~) 
 Do you wanna be in denial? 
 You wanna be in denial? 
 Must I sacrifice this heart 
 To live this life, the picture? 
 Keep on holding on 
 I want to be around love 
 Wondrous wondrous 
 Stars of the night 
 Make all the fury go out of sight 
 Accord me the strength 
 Send it out 
 Send it out 
 Send it out 
 Your violence is trickling inside me 
 Yet I'm to remain halcyon 
 Your mind over my body 
 You're taking over my sleep 
 You're taking over my... 
 (Oh no~) sleep 
 Do you wanna be in denial? 
 You wanna be in denial? 
 Must I sacrifice this heart 
 To live this life, the picture? 
 Keep on holding on 
 I want to be around love
