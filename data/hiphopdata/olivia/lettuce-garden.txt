You're a lolipop that I suck on 
 You melt in my mouth 
 I just swallow you down 
 They can't see me 
 Because you're in my face 
 Only I can see you 
 Tell me you know what you're doing sir 
 At least tell me you were thinking sir 
 I know you weren't thinking of yourself sir 
 Right sir? 
 Silent war, silent war, silent war 
 I'd rather die than to lick your blood 
 I'm not living in, no I'm not living in 
 Silent war, silent war, silent war 
 Silently moving with silent weapons 
 I'm not living in, no I'm not living in 
 I'm not living in your 
 Lettuce garden 
 I'm a lolipop that you suck on 
 I melt in your mouth 
 You just swallow me down 
 You can't see me 
 Because I'm in your veins 
 You can feel me 
 I know what I'm doing sir 
 I know what I'm thinking sir 
 So don't tell me how to live my life sir 
 Right sir? 
 Silent war, silent war, silent war 
 Love never fades away here 
 We've got an army of angels 
 Silent war, silent war, silent war 
 Silently bleeding, silently dreaming 
 I'm not living in, no I'm not living in 
 I'm not living in your 
 Lettuce garden 
 Silently, silently, silently
