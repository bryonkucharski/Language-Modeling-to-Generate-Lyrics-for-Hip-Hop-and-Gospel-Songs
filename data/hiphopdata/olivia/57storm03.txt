Everybody marching 
 In this fable of love 
 They're pulling on my pigtail 
 Forgetting the dream 
 Secretly I was gradually falling into 
 A deep over sleepy 
 Awkwardly comfortable cradle 
 And then, 
 The angel of spring came down and kissed me with 
 The pink of sunlight 
 I free the sound 
 Alive the sound 
 It cleaves with the wind of the violent storms, 
 Transforming my body 
 You're compelling that I am wrong 
 I aim to please your tension 
 So I keep my feet off the ground 
 I'm losing my perspective 
 How pleasing the warmth that lay on my skin, 
 Remembering where beauty exists again 
 I free the sound 
 Alive the sound 
 It grows the sound 
 Alive the sound 
 Fake it and I'm dead 
 It feels so good to be myself again 
 The storm sees 
 Transforming my body
