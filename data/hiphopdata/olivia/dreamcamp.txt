It's so easy to get lost in this 
 Lovely brutal world 
 I must go to sleep 
 So I can scream as loud as I want 
 Without attention 
 I must go to sleep 
 So I can follow the whispers 
 To my dreams 
 Come back into the world shiny and new 
 I will meet you there when everything's okay 
 We'll have a good old time together 
 I'll have new ideas 
 I'll be able to laugh 
 I'll be able to love myself 
 I float on the water 
 Trying to find a direction 
 A place meant for me 
 It's time to sleep 
 I feel tears over-flowing 
 My emotions 
 Come back into the world shiny and new 
 I will meet you there when everything's okay 
 We'll have a good old time together 
 I'll have new ideas 
 I'll be able to laugh 
 I'll be able to love myself
