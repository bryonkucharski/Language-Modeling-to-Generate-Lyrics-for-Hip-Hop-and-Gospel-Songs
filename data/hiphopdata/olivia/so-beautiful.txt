Suddenly I decided to get up and run 
 I started to run and run and run 
 I jumped over little ant-holes 
 I jumped over flowers, I jumped over trees, 
 Jumped over color, Jumped over people smiling at me 
 I jumped over March, April, May 
 I jumped over Autumn I ran past the warmth 
 I ran through his arms 
 I ran past a girl waving her hand at me 
 I ran and ran passing everything in front of me 
 I jumped over ability I jumped over my own heart 
 Jumped Mexico, jumped the clouds, 
 Jumped the moon, jumped the stars, 
 Jumped mars, jumped the truth 
 Yami ga terashita kawaita michi ni tachidomaru

 Tsunaida hikari hanatareru How Beautiful 
 Darker and Darker and Darker 
 The cold wind was sneeking inside of me 
 I didn't know if I was running away from me 
 I couldn't see anything I couldn't feel anything. no ~ 
 My hands were pulling on my legs 
 The sticky mud was sucking them down 
 I couldn't stop, I had to have the Queen Crown
