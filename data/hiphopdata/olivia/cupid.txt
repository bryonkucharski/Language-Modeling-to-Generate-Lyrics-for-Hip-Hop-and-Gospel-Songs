In emergencies 
 I close my eyes 
 And I see a ghost 
 I flutter to the light 
 And pray for lucidity 
 I can't keep waiting for you 
 I can't keep expecting you 
 Folding 
 The sun is turning inside-out of the universe so Cupid Cupid 
 Please aim your arrow at my sleeping flower 
 One time 
 Cupid Cupid 
 I, won't take it for granted 
 I wonder about 
 With my perfume puff 
 Skipping on the trails 
 Of broken candy cane 
 I can't keep waiting for you 
 I can't keep expecting you 
 Folding 
 The sun is turning inside-out of the universe so 
 Cupid Cupid 
 Please aim your arrow at my sleeping flower 
 Once more 
 Cupid Cupid 
 I can't keep waiting for you 
 I can't keep expecting you
