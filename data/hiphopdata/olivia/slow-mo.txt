Do you sense? are you aware? Love Do you care? 
 Did you enjoy your walk? 
 Move your body laugh and talk? Did you notice? 
 A message a guide an opening of a path 
 Did you hear? Fill your ears Someone Dear 
 Tremolo, taiko, arpegio, kokoro, ashiato, Radio, Piano, arigatou 
 Did you see? mabushii? Sweet and Sour Sunflower 
 Feel everydrop of your shower? ame no azabujuuban undone, no-sun 
 Communication making a connection 
 You and me Synchronicity shinjiaeta michi 
 Morning mist in the air Where were you when I was there? 
 Because I wanted to share Everything, Everywhere 
 Oh Did you see it? everyminute Did you see it? everyminute 
 Did you see it? Did you see it? 
 Let's go Slow Mo' Let's go Slow Mo' 
 It's what you make it It's how you see it 
 It's how you take it It's your own design 
 Do you sense? are you aware? Love Do you care? 
 Let's go just to see the rainbow Let's just go kake ni ikou 
 Let's forget where we have to go and go where we want to go 
 We're out of sight take a flight into light 
 That warm comforting Paradise Heaven you see 
 Aoku kagayaki utsukushii in your dreams all that you were looking for 
 Where you can't wait to arrive Is here 
 Right in front of you all that you fear disappears 
 You open to now and here 
 My rescue yellow surround we float above 
 Let's be ourselves sing dance 
 Go with what you feel, be real 
 Oh Do you see it? everyminute Do you see it? everyminute 
 Do you see it? Do you see it? 
 Let's go Slow Mo' Let's go Slow Mo' 
 It's what you make it It's how you see it 
 It's how you take it It's your own design
