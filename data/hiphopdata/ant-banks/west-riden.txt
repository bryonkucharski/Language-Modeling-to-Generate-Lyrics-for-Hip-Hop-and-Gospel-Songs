Yeah, Young jock up in this beezee 
 Claiming and representing that S-P geezee shit 
 Putting it down with my nigga the big bad ass 
 Spice 1 and King T 
 High siding and westside riding 
 Got my nigga from the feezee up in this beezee 
 We doing big thangs in the nine seezee 
 Kicking bitches in the booty and pointing out their 
 Duty 
 Yeah any motherfucker that wanna try us knows where 
 To find us 
 Motherfucker 
 King Tee: 
 This shit couldn't get no harder 
 Niggas is about to make me flip and commit manslaughter 
 All my dreams result to nightmares 
 So I walk around the hood strapped like I don't care 
 Truth or dare, I dare you to dis the west coast 
 The truth is them niggas will split your vest loc 
 With hollowpoint slugs, Crips and Bloods, we come deep 
 And roll in those Range Rover Jeeps 
 I was a made man at fifteen years 
 'Cause momma didn't raise no faggotty queer 
 I got paid fronting bad colors in the ninth grade 
 And on the westside is where I play 
 Straight sick, when my big uncle smoked dip 
 And grabbed his four four and took me with him on a 
 Lick 
 And sure as the sun will come up and just shine 
 The niggas couldn't believe the Rolex was all mine 
 Spice-1: 
 Yeah divine niggas the lexxy shine and the fetty 
 Motherfuckers ain't ready, see they won't hold their 
 Heads steady 
 When we come with the fifty caliber Desert Eagle 
 Feeling you motherfuckers over slugs equal 
 You these diamonds on the pinky, Rolex up on the wrist 
 Next nigga run up on me for my pieces is catching 
 Whole clips 
 No sucker to the G-A in me 
 You fail to realize sometimes that I dump on G-P 
 Black Bossalini, King T-E-E and S-P-I 
 Born to die, westside riding staying high 
 187 proof a ma-a-mack ten shooter 
 Hope the ba-a-black talons go right through you 
 Been mobbing since a youngster, laced like hundred spokes 
 Ain't no rules in the game, niggas die and go for broke 
 He didn't no I was strapped, he didn't no I was ready 
 Blow a hole in his chest and take off with a nigga's fetty 
 Real killers on the westside don't be fooled 
 We in the sun where the kids wear their vests to school 
 Soft niggas don't survive they be taking a dive 
 (West Side) 
 Refuse to leave them player haters alive 
 Real killers on the westside don't be fooled 
 We out west where the kids wear their vests to school 
 Soft niggas don't survive they be taking a dive 
 (West Side) 
 Refuse to leave them player haters alive 
 King Tee: 
 Ah yes all the way to niggas in projects 
 That heard about the King that be strapped with two techs 
 Rolling in a Lex with them twenty inch chrome rims 
 Trying to find a ho for some trim 
 Laid back, smoking on the doja loc 
 At the light all the hos watch me cough and choke 
 Young player, can I take a ride with you 
 Hell no, can I trust my life with you 
 You look shady just left four ??? with four babies 
 And I can hear your ass screaming save me 
 Trick I'm in a zone guns, clips and chipped up phones 
 And Vibe tapes of old love songs straight gone 
 Dipping and giving a fuck at who's tripping 
 Catch a nigga at the airport slipping 
 Huh, what a shame send his ass back from where it 
 Came in a casket 
 California love turned drastic 
 I'm come G'd up, niggas getting beat up 
 And I'm smoking all their dirt cess weed up 
 King T's G style got them hiding 
 'Cause this is what we call west riding 
 Spice-1: 
 See some of the haters try to fade you partner, but 
 Ain't nobody coming close 
 I keep some scissors up in the cut, so give me ten feet at the most 
 Ain't no generic artificial, Realer than you can imagine 
 Passing out in the back of limos with a lap full of cash and mashing 
 Dreaming of mad tales, with waterfalls in swimming pools 
 I'm living the life of a rap star 
 Eighty thousand dollar cars, jaccuzzi rooms with minibars 
 Hit the casino dropping fetty on tables smoking Cuban cigars 
 You need to quit 
 Sprinkle a motherfucker that will leave you split 
 Tore back ass out bringing you your hat 
 Flat broke, talking about fuck that nigga S-P-I 
 But you can't go one on one Spice 1 because I'm born to die 
 I gets medieval up on they ass like punk bitches in ditches 
 The gangsterism resulting in murderism 
 Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station 
 You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga 
 Where the scrilla 
 Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off my mask 
 Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash 
 Mobbing I mash out, you ass out 
 Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse 
 West side Riding while we getting higher 
 That's the way we do it 
 West side Riding while we getting higher 
 That's the way we do it 
 On the Westside
