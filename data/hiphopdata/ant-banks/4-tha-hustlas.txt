Too $hort: 
 If you're a real hustler your sure to get rich. 
 This is for the hustlaaaas, come on 
 This is for the hustlaaaas, oh 
 This is for the hustlaaaas, come on 
 This is for the hustlaaaas, oh 
 Oh, come on, come on 
 Too $hort: 
 I make money like a motherfucker 
 It ain't no thang to me 
 $Hort Dog in the house spittin' game wit Breed 
 Ain't no bust partner, that's the third week 
 I'm going to pimp these hoes, they can't work me 
 How the hell you think I get to ride a B-12? 
 The phone and TV ended with a green smell 
 I went from Oakland to Atlanta with my top down 
 $Hort Dog, my shit is nation wide now 
 You can ask Breed or Pac it don't stop 
 I ain't bull shittin make a mill when I rock 
 Three players in the game and it's a major 
 Bitch you wanna get me better hit me on my pager 
 Today I'm on the westcoast 
 Tomorrow I'm in Texas 
 Flip the Benz and Farri, sold the Lexus 
 $Horty drop the bass in the mix 
 You know what's next beitch 
 I'm sure to get rich 
 2Pac: 
 Haha 
 I'd be the thuggin' ass outlaw 
 Till my fuckin' casuct drops 
 Fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops 
 This is for the hustlaaaaas 
 Believe me coming stapped with the gak 
 When you see me 
 Label me a threat to society, but I ain't quitin 
 Thug life motherfucker ain't no bull shittin 
 Born in these projects destined to fate 
 Collecting mail on these broke bitches 
 Slanging that game 
 Now shit done changed 
 It ain't the the same 
 I ain't lyin' niggas are dyin' 
 Three strikes have you motherfuckers flyin 
 In the penatentary or in the cemetery 
 Gettin' high no need to worry 
 Last year niggas knockin' up the block and in between shots 
 Pumpin tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac 
 This year bringin' you the fix 
 Including Ant Banks in the mix 
 We're sure to get rich 
 Still I ride. 
 MC Breed: 
 I'm a cold-hearted fool 
 I mean a fool at heart, head strong 
 And I won't be headed home if he falls apart 
 Conatact niggas like a part time 
 When I ride the beat 
 Ain't no way to hide from the darkside 
 Man of many mens till the very end 
 And blend in and change my iden 
 Just to mix up with the game 
 They know me by the Breed and they don't know it's my last name 
 It's mind over matter 
 I don't mind, you don't matter 
 Pull a glock and watch the whole block scatter 
 And we can have us a gak to gak talk 
 Do it old style and do a back to back walk 
 Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends 
 And we can put the bull shit to an end 
 I figure if he plays around he lays around 
 And he's a motherfucker ?????? calls a corner when I'm around 
 Bodies are buried and found all around 
 And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true 
 Punk, fellas behave ya and it just might save ya 
 So guard your girl and pickup your pistol 
 Cause you can't get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit 
 The shit won't change as long as I'm alive 
 I gotta survive and keep it tight
