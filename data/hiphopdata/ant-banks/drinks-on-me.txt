(Feat. Captain Save M') 
 (Ant Banks) 
 A nigga bored as fuck 
 I've been sittin' here perkin since four o'clock 
 With a fifth of Remi in me, gotta get me to the club now 
 I'm feelin' freaky, I can see me makin' love now 
 Time to roll out - call Kevin it's a quarter to eleven 
 Come scoop your homey up and hit Club 227 
 It's like heaven, bitches everywhere and they dressed all tight 
 Fill my hoe up with drink and we fuckin' tonight 
 (Captain Save M') 
 I know I seen her in a magazine, but maybe I'm trippin' 
 This drink got me slidin when I'm ridin' then I'm sippin 
 Just made it to the club and already got some action 
 Maybe it's the candy 500 SL that got 'em reactin 
 Once you in girl you ain't gotta think about a drink 
 Just meet me at the bar 
 You and your partner, me and my cousin Ant Banks 
 We can do it live one time just so you will notice me 
 Drinks on me baby, all night 
 All the drinks that you need baby, drink on 
 You can drink, get your double up, drink it up 
 Drink it up, baby girl, till you ready to fuck; (I said) 
 (Ant Banks) 
 I got my Rolex glistenin and the bitches be whisperin 
 Ant Banks is gettin' the pussy and they know I be listenin 
 And I'm peepin out the haters who be hatin' my name 
 Don't hate the player motherfucker hate the motherfuckin game 
 It's a shame I'm the regulator 
 I'm at the bar buyin hoes brand new seperators, back it up baby 
 Ss-slow baby, take your time 
 After two more of these drinks, shoot, that ass is mine 
 (Captain Save M') 
 Might just be me 
 But you're movin like one of them private dancers 
 Doin' your duty, bumpin and grindin on ME, with your big-ass booty 
 Baby got me twisted, if she think it ain't all gravy 
 As much money as I spent on you, you must be my lady 
 Half-black and filipino is ingredients that I be 
 Got me holla'n UNNNNNNNGH, How You Do Dat Dere like Master P 
 I Got the Hook-Up, from XO to Alize to Hennesey 
 It's the artist formerly known as Captain Save-a-Hoe 
 Now you can have 
 (Ant Banks) 
 Bitch on the dancefloor feelin' it 
 She got a drink in her hand and the bitch spillin it 
 All over me, gotta lick it off 
 Got my hands up her coochie getcha wet and soft 
 I know you love it, youse a tramp and you know it too 
 It ain't too much shit yo' ass won't do 
 I'm playin' with the titties, now baby showin em 
 Cause bitches let the drank bring out the real hoe in them 
 You know? 
 (Captain Save M') 
 They say that Freaks Come Out at Night so let it be 
 I'm tryin' to get nationwide with these freaks like BET 
 Once again like they say the gin'll make you sin 
 So babygirl let me ask you: let's be friends! 
 Let me quench yo' thirst and I'll make it right 
 With some full-service drinks all through the night 
 Oh, you wanna show yo' ass and act bad, well scratch yo' itch 
 Yo DJ, cut the music, so I can act like 
 My other cousin Too $hort and call this babyhoe a BEEOTCH!
