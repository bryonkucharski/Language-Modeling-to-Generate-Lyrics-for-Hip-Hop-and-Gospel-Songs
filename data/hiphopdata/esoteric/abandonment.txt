When the spoken words make less sense than those unspoken 
 And resentment is all that is left to give 
 Still we go through with the facade 
 Wasting our time humouring insanities 
 And know so well 
 Sense has no place here 
 Fire, running with abandonment 
 Until there's no place left to burn 
 Did those eyes drown? 
 Did the soul slip so far down it became lost? 
 Is the only spirit left, the one that passes the lips? 
 An age of destruction 
 I watch, my disbelief waiting for change 
 The will for resolution faded fast 
 And in the end, it stands for nothing, counts for nothing 
 Tis like a funeral march 
 Driving towards the death 
 Awaiting the vultures' call
