I have a million questions. but no will to ask. 
 Through chaos. rationale speaks clearly. 
 Decay sets in amongst the fragments... 
 Such weight lies within knowledge. 
 Crippled by thought. 
 Eyes that see too much lose the will to see. 
 And the pain that spills from these walls. 
 Blasts through this withered body. 
 The circle has begun. 
 Time is not won. 
 Losing this battle to remain. 
 In this place. 
 I dare not dream. 
 For awakening the demons that will find me. 
 Blinded by madness. 
 Such endless probability. 
 And I must know every thing and every thought 
 And I must uncover all answers sought. 
 For sleep eludes when this frustration taunts. 
 And drives me to release. 
 Or travel towards end. 
 So dead inside. 
 And all but to live on. 
 Burning from within. 
 Maddened eyes. 
 Filled with boiling blood. 
 Sullen. 
 Grow sharper with the pain. 
 To rest now. 
 Until we meet again.
