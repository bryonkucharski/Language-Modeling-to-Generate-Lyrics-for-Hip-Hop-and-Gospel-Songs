(Virtuoso) 
 I'm omnipotent 
 You claim to win battles 
 So when the beat starts 
 I'll punch the tree bark 
 And pass the chainsaw to a ? heart 
 Severing every animal 
 I'm doing dirt like earthworms 
 I'm sick and original 
 Boy, I gave birth to the first germs 
 I spit the acetate 
 To make your lips evaporate 
 The Master Ape 
 Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face 
 Pass the eight, sack of shake 
 Twisted in plasma tape 
 I came for y'all through the castle gate 
 I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate 
 Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle? 
 So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate 
 Telling 7L to sratch a plate 
 In due for respect I slap your face 
 Ask to make my specs, I'm a tackle ya 
 You're a neck and I'm Dracula 
 Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura 
 Met with the, Jedi Mind Tricks 
 We rhyme sick and side ? for dime chicks 
 I'll strangle you, use my same hands to give you the Heimlick 
 So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips 
 Jus Allah prays on the minds of the young 
 Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue 
 Taste my blade sharpness 
 Ranked in no class like Marxist 
 The heartless 
 Rise out of darkness 
 I'm the last head you should ever try to fuck with 
 Be the next member in the cast of my snuffed vics 
 Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping 
 At war with the demons that live in infernal regions 
 Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators 
 Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus 
 Grabbing your leg, so you live to the heavenless 
 Drop this prejudice and follow me to Exodus 
 We ravenous 
 Exhume the tomb of Lazarus 
 You blasphemous 
 We bring war to pacifists 
 Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock 
 Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots 
 A pine box is fine for a killer to run 
 Swing from vines and rhyme like Atilla The Hun 
 Bring the gun, your tongue is what I'm slicing 
 We slap tracks and attack like M. Bison 
 Ilohem, fuck the pagans we mark them 
 And take turns to burn religious doctrines 
 Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles 
 Locked in the brain to lacerate ankles 
 Yo, I rip mics, stick lames 
 Wreck nights, spit flames 
 Lead pipes, split frames 
 Kid ain't shit changed 
 Act trife 
 I grab the mic and bag your wife 
 Sacrifice you twice 
 Motherfucker in after life 
 Decimate your paradise 
 Burn tracks like thermostats 
 My personal attacks snap back to murder cats 
 I might advise 
 You type of guys should revitalize 
 Your man power, I sabotage the fire flys 
 With a dope rhyme 
 Take control of your soul 
 Grab a forty fo' for the po's 
 Get your broken nose 
 Opponents go to shows 
 Now they know their robes damn hoes that fold my clohtes 
 I bark at these, mark emcees, park and freeze 
 My world hypothesis 
 Kill beasts like heart disease 
 Man please 
 You can never fuck with the Eso-teridactyl 
 My rap skills will thrash you 
 Motherfucker
