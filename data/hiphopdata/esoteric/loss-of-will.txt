Doubt stripping the soul 
 Unending questions driving me into insanity 
 Time took its toll, 
 Enough to ensure, 
 The mind cannot mirror the soul 
 With each tide, 
 The will corrodes further 
 Relentless grip, 
 Squeezing out the life, 
 Of this shipwrecked body, 
 Lost in the gallows of hopes and dreams... 
 Reality crumbles, 
 Shivering, as truth lay bare 
 And roads of nonchalance grew upon...
