Avert my eyes to prevent the falling, 
 Some things should not be seen 
 And if I dare glance 
 The quickening travels swiftly, 
 To take leave of my senses 
 Excess in place of sleep 
 Cathartic, 
 Still, yet restless amidst this elucidation 
 The red mist contorts, distorts, 
 Blasting through my mind 
 Destroying all rational thought 
 Reflections of dissolution 
 A malevolent labyrinth 
 Spurious, blinding 
 Unforgiving reality 
 This fantastic chaos that contains everything the mind could imagine, 
 But mostly would not care to see 
 Merely breathing 
 Searching for that elusive purpose that drives us, 
 But we know not where 
 Time will eventually scrub me from existence 
 And I will never have known it
