Over whom does infinity hold sway? 
 All the time has passed. 
 No future awaits. 
 Where there is no light. 
 I shall remain. 
 Never to diminish, nor comprehend. 
 The one absolute. 
 Within eternal twilight I exist. 
 Excised from the stream of time and being. 
 I wander. 
 Answers I seek. 
 To that which I cannot know. 
 You need not to fear now. 
 For release shall be yours. 
 Through golden fields you may walk. 
 All knowledge flowing through you. 
 Let your pain console. 
 For escape is nigh. 
 Your blood flows, your soul is released. 
 Silentium est aureum. 
 I have come to know all. 
 Yet I know not time. 
 At your death. 
 My torment is complete. 
 Horrific realisation. 
 Time demise of finality. 
 Absolutions collapse.
