I see them coming at me all the time, 
 Lashing out, killing me over and over again. 
 And I laugh for I enjoy all the deaths that I receive, 
 The pain and destruction of my flesh, 
 Killing me over and over again. 
 The blackness still comes, forever killing me. 
 I rock back and forth, staring through. 
 The blackness which slices through, 
 My scarred and dead flesh, yet still I die as I see my skin shred. 
 Dead again and still I stare at the blackness which is still there. 
 Have they not yet reached the core, of my flesh so battered and torn? 
 Maybe I have no core, maybe inside there's nothing. 
 If so what do I die for? 
 Staring, watching, willing, killing, 
 Seeing, dreaming, screaming, screaming, 
 Killing, killing, killing, killing: 
 Willing, filling what wasn't there, emptiness my despair. 
 Stuck, unable to move off my chair, 
 Rocking back and forth, with no eyes, yet still I stare. 
 At the blackness which is always there.
