Lies a broken man. 
 Festering inside. 
 Shades of light pass through this room. 
 And remind me. 
 There was once a world. 
 Outside of this stricken maze. 
 Only instincts drives on. 
 And life. 
 Our great teacher. 
 Teaches all. 
 Passing through this fetid ship. 
 With sickened feeling of what lies within. 
 Sporadic thought, spawning its messy web of insanity. 
 Living from the heart and breath alone. 
 For emotions determine all that is lost and won here. 
 And all that is dear. 
 Taken, by wind and time. 
 How many times in a lifetime must we break? 
 And have such a need to be strong? 
 So tired of this feeling. 
 Of fighting and living. 
 Wrought so completely with pain. 
 Nothing remains... 
 But a restless longing for death. 
 Hidden, beneath this face.
