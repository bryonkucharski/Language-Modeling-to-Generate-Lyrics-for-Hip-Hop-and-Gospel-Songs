"He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of 
 Great understanding, for belief in one false principle is 
 The beginning of all unwisdom." 
 Slavery: 
 Followers of the right-hand path, 
 Looking to God for comfort. 
 Enslaved by his command, 
 Controlled by priests and bishops. 
 Conceited are the followers who preach unto others, 
 Not to follow is to burn in Hell. 
 Spreading lies about Satanism, to enslave the minds of sinners. 
 Propaganda spread - mass control. 
 Pay to repent - money for their pleasure. 
 Brainwashing the weak in mind. 
 If God is good, why should you fear him? 
 All they want is the feeling of power, 
 Of having others follow their morals. 
 All they bring is pain and fear to the ones who are unsure. 
 Kill these enslavers. 
 They only want to rule and judge you to satisfy their narrow minds. 
 Satanism is a way of life, 
 It is to do whatever will please you. 
 There are no commandments just follow you instincts, 
 Never bow down to the lambs of God. 
 Question the why and wherefore of their commandments. 
 Why should they be true? 
 Man's instincts go against self-denial. 
 Instincts of indulgence and self-preservation should come through. 
 "There is no heaven of glory bright and no hell where sinners roast. 
 Here and now is our day of torment. Here and now is our day of joy."
