Although we may rationalise (sic), 
 Nurture our fate 
 Nothing can prepare or compare with 
 This immeasurable sense of loss 
 All can be calm 
 Until that thought arises 
 And plummets toward the ground 
 Time passes like the dripping of a tap 
 And sleep, becomes that time when the body can no longer be awake 
 Each morning, eyes blearier than the night before 
 But it had passed, 
 As I was there within it 
 Watching over as if through the eyes of another 
 Through conscious repetition, 
 But my thoughts were elsewhere 
 Longing, but unable to take the steps 
 That might continue this journey 
 Indignant in this bleak landscape, that no longer binds 
 Each serene moment, accompanied by another full of dread 
 And I resolve, 
 To that familiar feeling time tries so hard to bury 
 To live life, only to bear
