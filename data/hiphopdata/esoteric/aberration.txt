Staring as I prepare to leave this mortal coil 
 To pass through these portals 
 To the gateway of experience 
 I release, into this sense of falling 
 Hallucinations flood my eyes 
 Thoughts, memories pouring through 
 Racing unchartered (sic) vessels, 
 Evolving through this twisted, psychotropic journey 
 Drifting within waves of consciousness 
 Momentum gathers swiftly 
 Pulsing, gathering intensity 
 Deeper still, 
 Nausea rising from the depths, 
 Bent double with psychosis, 
 As vomit and blood spew forth 
 Time and space distort as the earth pulls me down, 
 Into a place I have never perceived 
 Clawing for reason, 
 Imprisoned within my own delusions 
 Pouring frantic visions into my eyes 
 Between drowning and burning alive, 
 Forcing each breath, 
 Through thoughts that endanger the being 
 Lost within the throes of madness, 
 Anxiety tearing the foundations of my mind 
 Drifting through the otherworld, 
 Slowly it subsides 
 Conscious returns, shaken, disinterred
