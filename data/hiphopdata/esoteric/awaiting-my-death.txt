Windows of shattered dreams. 
 Laid out before me. 
 My broken reflection hauntingly stares back, 
 As once again I pick up the pieces of my mind. 
 Rebuilding myself again. 
 And I know what is done. 
 The smaller pieces lost. 
 They used to be large, 
 But now they are gone. 
 I cannot find my hope, my joy or my life, 
 Just empty splinters embedded in my mind. 
 Causing me pain, I grimace in awe at the overwhelming pain. 
 Caused by what I've lost, by what has been destroyed. 
 My scars start to bleed. 
 From my wounds of sorrow, 
 I watch the blood run. 
 A release of my self-hate, 
 And still the blood flows: 
 Scarred all over my body. 
 With each scar comes a memory of pain. 
 Though it's hard to tell now, they all look the same. 
 Awaiting the day when my blood is no more, 
 Maybe then the pain will be gone. 
 I await my death with both relief and with fear, 
 I sense that my shattered mind knows it is near.
