Falling 
 Through empty platitudes 
 And frozen comforts 
 Drifting 
 There is no consolation 
 Obsolecense (sic) surrounds me 
 Calling 
 Unheard I scream 
 A destitute awareness 
 I had nothing 
 I have nothing 
 I watch them all 
 Smiling 
 A beautiful dream of ignorance 
 I see them all 
 Worshipping (sic) 
 Waiting for their end 
 They have nothing 
 There is nothing 
 Unheard I scream
