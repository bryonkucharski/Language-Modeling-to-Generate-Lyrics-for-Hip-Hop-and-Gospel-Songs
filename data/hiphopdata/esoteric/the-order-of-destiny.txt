The walls ripple... closing in... 
 Driven forth... transcending streams of consciousness 
 As reason oppresses instinct. 
 Departure draws near until end. 
 That first and only certainty. 
 And cause, some random inheritor of our misguided designs. 
 Not adorned with. 
 Except for the few who dare to visit this place. 
 Never to be staid in unquestioned days. 
 But to roam free. 
 Shattering the banal conclusion. 
 Difference brings disrepute. 
 All anarchic flood of rage. 
 And fate may forsake. 
 For the journey twists as you had it planted. 
 The seeds of what is ought. 
 Misfortune lurking every crevice. 
 Of this crooked quest. 
 Frameworks. 
 Paths of truth and life. 
 Nothingness. 
 Only what we may become.
