Unable to rest 
 Nothing left but angst 
 Not even one moment of tranquility awaits 
 Figures passing by, 
 Time moves on, 
 But each part at a different pace 
 Atrophied, 
 Unable to connect 
 To the paths that find peace 
 Addled to no longer feel 
 Destroying the self... 
 Consuming death... 
 Into non-being...
