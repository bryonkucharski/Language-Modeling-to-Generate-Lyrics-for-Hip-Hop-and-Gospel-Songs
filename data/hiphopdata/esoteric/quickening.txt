Hallucinations enter the shadows... 
 Losing the mind. 
 On this path to oblivion. 
 So much time lost in chaos. 
 As I descend. 
 Succumbed to the unfathomable. 
 Abandoned beyond all control. 
 Skulking, scraping, the barren wastes... 
 Formless predator of the minds' domain. 
 And as its presence draws near I sense it. 
 Knowing within its pull I can be forever lost. 
 A part of me. 
 I have become.
