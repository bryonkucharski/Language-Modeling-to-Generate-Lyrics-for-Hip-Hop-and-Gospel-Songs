Bereft promises made unto me, 
 I always remember watching them fade. 
 Upon winds of blackened torment, 
 The promises' I couldn't see. 
 For they are just words, 
 And your words are empty. 
 Lies, Lies: 
 "Ilasa micalazoda olapireta ialpereji beliore: das odo 
 Busadire Oiad ouoresa caosago: casaremeji Laiada eranu 
 Berinutasa cafafame das ivemeda aqoso adoho Moz, od 
 Maofasa. Bolape como belioreta pamebeta. Zodocare od 
 Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa. Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco 
 Mada, hoathahe Saitan!" 
 Lies are all humanity knows, 
 For if they spoke truth it would show, 
 That they are nothing but a shadow of each other. 
 Confusion and lies engulf me, 
 The bastard humans disgust me. 
 I scream alone in the mountains, venting my hate, 
 Calling forth emptiness to surround me. 
 So that I may see clearly with my mind, 
 The words they use to try to blind me. 
 I can see. 
 No one keeps their promises, 
 No one ever cares, 
 And neither do I anymore. 
 Humanities demise is what I lust for.
