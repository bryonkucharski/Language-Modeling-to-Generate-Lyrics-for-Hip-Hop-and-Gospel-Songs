I can't control them, but they control me. 
 The voices can't be heard. they're kept out of sight. 
 Hatred from within. purged from the soul of me. 
 Leads me to destruction. they need my detonation. 
 Hate... 
 Wild... 
 Pass... 
 Away... 
 Death eats away from the inside. 
 Life eats away from the outside. 
 In between... in between. 
 In between... in between. 
 Void. 
 Pointless. 
 Existence... 
 Over over over and 
 Over over over and 
 Over over over and 
 Over over over and 
 Make me see the 
 Birth of my insanity. reality. 
 A memory... 
 My mind recoils... 
 Push... down... 
 Push... down... 
 Push... down... 
 Break... down... 
 Break... down... 
 Break... down... 
 My mind makes things happen...
