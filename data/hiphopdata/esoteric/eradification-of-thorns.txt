Rage intensifies my desire for revenge. 
 Hatred flowing in my blood. 
 My veins expand to release the pure, unbridled, abhoration. 
 For those who interfere with my life. 
 They caused me sorrow, 
 But pain will be returned. 
 My mind turns to execution. 
 My sadism fed by their obliteration. 
 I laugh at their death and scorn their pathetic existence. 
 Now to non-existence. 
 The thorn in my side caused me pain. 
 My logic eradicates at the root of my problems. 
 Those who would give me pain, 
 Would also make themselves a thorn. 
 My cure is to remove the cause. 
 Remove the cause.
