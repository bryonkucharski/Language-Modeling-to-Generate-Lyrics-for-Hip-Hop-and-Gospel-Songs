Chapter what? Verse what? 
 Oh no, no, no, no, not today ladies and gentlemen 
 I'm here to tell you about Stay Hard 
 Keep your dick hard all night long 
 Back in the day they used to call me the sharp shooter 
 But right now it's all about getting your testosterone level up 
 Men, how many times you had a problem? 
 The woman out there with the legs cut open 
 You looked down and 'lil man ain't around 
 What you gotta do, fellas, is get your shit together 
 Stay hard, all night long 
 Stay up better all evening 
 Stay hard, stay good 
 Take it from me and I will lead you to where 
 Be fruitful and multiply 
 That's right ladies and gentlemen 
 By the time you get to my age 
 Your testasterone level reach so low 
 You can't look down and see it 
 Unless you lift your stomach up 
 But with new stay hard all night long 
 Oh, you can give it to her, you can give it to her 
 'Cause tell the truth fellas 
 You don't just be beatin' that pussy up like you used to 
 It is brought to you by 
 Hold up, who this mofoca made by? 
 Stay hard by who? I don't know 
 Who made the motherfucker? 
 Shit, I don't know, you don't know 
 I don't know who made this 
 He just told me to come to 
 Well, go look for in, in 
 Go look for it somewhere in CBS 
 Rite Aid, Walgreen one of you motherfuckers got it 
 Stay hard, keep your testosterone levels up, man 
 Keep your thing up hard, good and hard
