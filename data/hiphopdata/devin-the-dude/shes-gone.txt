*Devin crying* 
 *Man* 
 What's wrong man 
 Come on man hold it together man come on 
 I don't know why you crying over her anyway 
 Be strong! 
 She gave me everything I wanted from the start 
 Her mind, body and heart 
 And I just knew the two of us would never ever part 
 I used to fart under the covers and she'd just laugh 
 She even cleaned my balls when we would take a bath 
 She straightened up the bed when I was still in it 
 Get up and fix some breakfast 
 The kind of gal that makes you want to leave them other heffers alone 
 But my bone got a mind of its own 
 I continued to roam while she waited by the phone 
 Loneliness got the best of her 
 She wanted to explore 
 Her other options that she had, oh no my baby was no whore 
 Just a woman with needs, a desire to be apreciated 
 I tried to keep her in the nest, warm and incubated 
 But my heart was steady gettin' colder 
 Coming home with not enough energy to even hold her 
 And then it happened 
 One bright early morn 
 I turned around to give my baby a hug and she was gone 
 She was gone, Gone x 3 
 Callin house to house 
 Tryin' to figure out 
 Where could she be 
 She don't get up before me 
 And its damn near three 
 Its pouring down outside, raining cats and frogs 
 I know pretty soon, she's coming back to the house 
 Damn, 3:30, 4 o clock, five 
 Called her at 6, something must be wrong with the ride 
 Eyes wide, looking outside every ten minutes 
 Not realizing the relationship been finished 
 12 pack, 8 cups of coughee, 2 cups of tea 
 Hurry up and peepin out the curtain forgetting to pee 
 Telephone ring (brring) hurry up pick it up 
 I thought I heard some body say 
 "Boy, I got ya bitch, what's up" 
 But it wasn't 
 But I still almost hit the star 69 button 
 Ready to cuss out whoever answered the phone 
 But I didn't call back, to face the fact that she was gone 
 She was gone. Gone x 3 
 Like a tucket through the comb 
 Can't imagine another motherfucker makin' her moan 
 Got a call on my cell 
 It was her, what the hell 
 Wonderin what kind of story you got to tell 
 She said, she left a note under the bed 
 "Had to get up early be back to get a loaf of bread" 
 Shit, loaf of bread, why you ain't been call me 
 "I had a flat" 
 You had a flat 
 "Yes, I had a flat" 
 You didn't have enough minutes on ya phone to call me 
 "Its locked in the car" 
 Oh... oh well shit, you left it in the car while you was on foot 
 "Yes" 
 Alrite fuck it... just come on home, I'm here man 
 "I'm on my way" 
 *Phone hang up* 
 Hello 
 Hey baby it's me, I took care of everything 
 Oh yeah, he fell for that loaf of bread bullshit, didn't he? 
 As usual 
 Huha I knew it. Look, forget about that nigga 
 You need to come over here right now 
 Okay. I'm on my way 
 She was gone. Gone. x3
