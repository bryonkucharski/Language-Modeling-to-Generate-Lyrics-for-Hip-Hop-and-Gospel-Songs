(Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 Our life used to be so wonderful 
 Yeah 
 But ooh look at me now 
 (Devin the Dude) 
 Ya lookin' at me strange 
 I got my weed I got my drank and other thangs 
 I been trying to adjust and focus 
 I want to quit drinkin' this shit but, no luck 
 No bucks at the end of the night and I'm drunk 
 The crown royal Hennessy and Budweiser's no punk 
 Nobody to save me with the proper technique 
 But I can't point the finger at nobody but me 
 But now I lose, I've been used, I've been lied on 
 I used to be private but now I feel I'm being spied on 
 It used to be so wonderful and so care free 
 But now the evilness tries to run up and scare me 
 And dare me to do somethin' wrong somethin' crazy somethin' wild 
 Was I thinkin' or did I actually shoot 2 people and smile 
 Hidin bodies in the back of an ol' school 'llac 
 I forgot alot of shit but now I know for a fact that 
 (Devin the Dude) 
 It used to be no wonders about who ain't feelin' me 
 No spouse runnin' through the house aimed at killin' me 
 No love lost because emotions are deep 
 And no worries about where to go and no secrets to keep but 
 Look at me now it seems that everybody know 
 Where I been and even where I gotta go 
 And they'll try to help me out if it would benefit them but 
 If not they'll probably be like fuck him 
 But I can't get mad at em' I probably had em' by my side 
 Maybe they think my promiseswas premeditated lies 
 And at a blink of an eye somehow I'm not trust-worthy 
 The purest heart you've ever known is now just dirty 
 I used to come through wit all kinds of bags of goodies 
 Pocket full of change never have to ask for pussy 
 Gettin' the party started like lickity split 
 But now when I come through all they say is aww shit 
 (Devin the Dude) 
 How can I win when situation seems kinda sticky 
 Get relief without reachin' for me a 40 oz 
 Mickey or a pick me up would only lay me down flat 
 Noddin off wakin' up wonderin where I'm at 
 Aw shit, damn where did everybody go 
 How did I end up on the floor I can't find my bill fold and 
 I got my keys and my car's been towed 
 I'm out walkin' tryin' to find the niggas lookin' at me throwed oh 
 Always me break out the violins (get up and try again before you sin again) 
 What aww who is that I'm hearin shit 
 Gatherin my thoughts is like tryin' to build a pyramid 
 Now I'm finally realizin it's all simple 
 It's how you take it like a pimple on ya face 
 You bust it you break it you scrape it off 
 And uh what you do is what you can do 
 It's what a man do anyway anyhow 
 I'm a cool brother
