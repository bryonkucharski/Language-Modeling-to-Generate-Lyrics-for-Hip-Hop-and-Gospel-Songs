Take a seat, that nigga D is at your service 
 I never get nervous unless I'm wondering where the herb is 
 I don't sell but I purchase, I try to find the finest 
 Nowadays the weed will have you way behind the minus 
 I'm not really highly paid but they say I'm best braided 
 Still wreck the show even though I get faded 
 Have I made it? Naw, but the game is not final 
 Devin still comin' wit' his thang up in ya spinal 
 I know niggas gon' talk and the bitches gon' gossip 
 But I keep rockin' till a nigga make a profit 
 They can't stop it with the rumors 'cause the Dude make albums 
 If you don't cut the cheque suck a dick you can't have 'em 
 You gotta get yours, they gon' get theirs 
 Get some money in your hands just in case the plan fails 
 'Cause once you in you in, you can't bail, you know what 
 Gotta get what you can get and make it swell and blow up like that 
 I write a verse, do a song, sing a ringtone 
 Anything to keep you on my dingaling bone 
 D is in the house and I don't think that he is leaving 
 'Cause he's over in the corner marijuana swissa sweetin' 
 And he's feeding hoes dick, like he does everyday 
 The peach fuzz on his nuts now long in the gray 
 Say what you wanna say you're only old as you feel 
 B-boy took my soul and I can still win deal 
 And I can still send chills through yo body 
 I take it out then wipe it off and I'm Audi 
 Then I'm back again, the motor hot still hummin' 
 20 years and runnin' yeah, the nigga still comin' like that
