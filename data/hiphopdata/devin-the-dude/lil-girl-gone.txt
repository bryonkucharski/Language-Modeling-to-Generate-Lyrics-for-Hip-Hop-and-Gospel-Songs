 Ok I'm talking 'bout a 
 Good girl gone bad 
 Crooked world wrong pad 
 Right mom wrong dad 
 I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you 
 But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luther's 
 In the morning with the boosters 
 On the corner with the boosters 
 And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures 
 And I wanna talk to her 
 But her momma has to school her 
 I wanna see her better 
 She's the weather of my future 
 I don't wanna see another hurricane 
 Baby you can kill the pain 
 If you just let me explain 
 Trust me I know what I'm sayin' 
 You will end up on the track of an oncoming train 
 Stuck in the passenger seat 
 Trying do the fast lane 
 Damn... 
 Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded 
 Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it 
 She was raised good can't blame her parents 
 Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it (x2) 
 Well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad 
 Who on the outside had everything people wished they had 
 A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage 
 And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard 
 See daddy was a doctor 
 And mommy was a banker 
 Mommy's job got outsourced 
 So now mommy's drinker 
 Daddy had a malpractice suit 
 Now he's a snorter 
 And all this shits takin' place 
 Right in front of their daughter 
 She says, "Daddy what's wrong?" 
 But he's just too high 
 "Mommy what we gon' do?" 
 She just get drunk and cry 
 Caught in the middle of two wrongs trying to do right 
 Looking for answers alone in the darkness of night 
 That shit ain't tight 
 Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded 
 Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it 
 She was raised good can't blame her parents 
 Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it (x2) 
 Couldn't even fold her own clothes yet she chose to jet 
 This is shit she will always regret 
 Now she's runnin' from house to house out and about 
 All hours of the night 
 Learning hard lessons of life 
 She called home twice but she couldn't say 
 Where she was gonna lay her head the very next day 
 She gave up her body and mind way before time 
 Got nothing left to dug out and get help 
 She doesn't know what to do with herself 
 Her family's worried think she don't even care 
 (Don't even care) 
 She's livin' up her life 
 On a hope and a prayer 
 Where she'll end up in a few years who knows where 
 (Who knows where...) 
 Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded 
 Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it 
 She was raised good can't blame her parents 
 Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it [x2]
