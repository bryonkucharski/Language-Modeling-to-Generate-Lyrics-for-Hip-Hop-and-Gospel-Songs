You see I'm just a man 
 I'm trying to do all that I can 
 Don't know why you don't understand 
 The situations I've been in 
 They may have been other undercover secret lovers 
 But you're my main thing (you're my main thing) 
 I've been trying to figure this out 
 What this is all about 
 All we do is fight, scream and shout 
 There's been days that I lie to you 
 And did you lie to me too? 
 Once again (you don't trust me) 
 I know you can't (I'm not worth it) 
 I'm not worth it 
 But I think we've come too far 
 Girl you know 
 (They don't like it, she is working it out) 
 You're my main thing 
 We'll make it work somehow 
 What is said and done, it was all my fault 
 I guess I didn't ever thought 
 That you would ever put me out 
 Now I'm trying to walk a line for you 
 That's what I want to do 
 Know I wasn't true yeah 
 Tell me when, when can I talk to me 
 Show you how I can make it right 
 You know I really wasn't worth it 
 A position wasn't right 
 You see I'm just a man 
 I'm trying to do all that I can 
 Don't know why you don't understand 
 The situations I've been in 
 They may have been other undercover secret lovers 
 But you're my main thing (you're my main thing)
