I didn't come, I didn't call ya 
 Matter of fact I forgot it was your birthday 
 I didn't check my messages 
 I guess I was drinking, was thirsty in the worst way 
 I didn't realize 
 That you wanted me just as much as I want you 
 I tried to get between them thighs 
 You asked me to wait, but I just didn't want to 
 Probably should have, when I could have 
 Spending time worrying when you gon' put out 
 Thinking with my third leg with my foot out 
 Now I'm sitting round here in this shit house 
 I forgot to thank you 
 For all the things you done for me 
 I didn't bother to help you 
 With your rent when you asked me for a G 
 I can't be played a fool 
 That's what I thought - you was all about money 
 Now you with another dude 
 I want another chance, but you don't want shit from me 
 I didn't tell you how much I needed you in my life babe 
 I didn't tell you how much I care for you 
 But I 
 Probably should have, when I could have 
 Spending time worrying when you gon' put out 
 Thinking with my third leg with my foot out 
 Now I'm sitting round here in this shit house 
 And you were gone, I was all alone 
 I met a girl, she was fine and submissive 
 She was cool, she wasn't you 
 She only fuck, didn't cook, didn't do dishes 
 But that ain't what it's all about 
 Realized she was just like them other fake bitches 
 Slamming doors and throwing shit in my house 
 And now she's cutting up my shit, man what the fuck is this!?? 
 I sometimes think of you as I toss and turn at night 
 Now you're gone with someone else 
 And I lost the yearn to fight 
 Probably should have, when I could have 
 Spending time worrying when you gon' put out 
 Thinking with my third leg with my foot out 
 Now I'm sitting round here in this shit house 
 You know, most of my time is pretty much thinking of you 
 I even look at the pictures we use to take 
 Realizing that I made a huge mistake 
 I wish I could turn back the hands of time 
 I'll do a lot of things differently 
 Respect your body and your mind 
 So I can have both at the same time 
 I didn't tell you how much I needed you in my life babe 
 I didn't tell you how much I care for you 
 But I 
 Probably should have, when I could have 
 Spending time worrying when you gon' put out 
 Thinking with my third leg with my foot out 
 Now I'm sitting round here in this shit house
