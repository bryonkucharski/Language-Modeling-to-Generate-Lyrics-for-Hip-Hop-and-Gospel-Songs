Well, hello again my weed smokin' friends 
 I'm glad you came with coughee in your cups 
 If I went up I'll do the same 
 And you can pass it to someone you've never met 
 And let 'em get just as high as you 
 You're eyes red as shit, mine too 
 We 'bout to start the show who got an Optimo? 
 A swisha suite, a zig zag and the bitch that'll kiss my meat 
 This cordless mic, I know what they like 
 Continue to rockin' the show that'll slow up a fight 
 And I know of a dyke, who wouldn't mind 
 Gettin' some of this dick from behind but I'm gonna chill y'all 
 'Cause she might wanna start wearin' my draws and 
 Oh no, don't want that shit to happen 
 Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 Don't want that shit to happen 
 Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 Don't want that shit to happen 
 Admirin' my weed jar, it's rather stocky 
 At the crib, how 'bout myself lookin' at hockey 
 And wonderin' who's gonna win The Cup 
 If it was full of coughee I know the brothers will man up 
 I'll stand up to get a drink, then I get a call 
 Can you come over so I can lick your balls? 
 Well yes, I guess let me shampoo my nuts and get dressed 
 I'll be there in 20 minutes 
 Mission complete, I hit the street with the suite, some heat 
 But fuck, there's some cops on the beat 
 And there's some crooked laws 
 That'll pull you over and dig all in your draws and 
 Oh no, don't want that shit to happen 
 Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 I don't want that shit to happen 
 Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 5:30 p.m., I'm at the lab again 
 Another song, about to take another stab again 
 Drinkin' and laughin' and puff, puff, passin' it 
 To and fro' while constructin' my flow 
 And pick up some hoes, up in this motherfucker 
 Hey, whatcha wanna do girl? 
 I don't wanna tease you, I just wanna please you 
 And lick you from your neck to the top of your dick 
 And then rub my clit and grind my hips 
 Oh, that sounds like some pretty cool shit 
 But damn, might get full of weed and alcohol 
 I go to sleep, you try to dig off in my wallet and in my draws and 
 Don't want that shit to happen 
 Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 I don't want that shit to happen 
 Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 Don't want that shit to happen 
 Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin' 
 I don't want it, don't want it, don't want it 
 Don't want that shit to happen
