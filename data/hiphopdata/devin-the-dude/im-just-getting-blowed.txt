Yeah 
 Blowed 
 Yeah 
 (Tha Bizness, Tha Bizness) 
 The heresy, the talking, the chatter 
 The gossip and the rumors 
 See to me, it don't matter 
 I barely go out 
 And if you ever see me 
 It's probably at a grocery sto', but not on TV 
 'Cause when I get high - I get hungry, so I cook 
 Go get some weed and... open a book 
 Of papers, if I don't have a cigar 
 Hold up, wait - I got some blunts in the car 
 Mad dash, Brad back 
 With a fresh box of swishers 
 (I thought you said blunts?) 
 Cigarillos, what's the difference? 
 It's about what you put up in 
 Nigga, look at this spinach! 
 Roll it - nigga, hit it! 
 2 minutes, you finished 
 I'm still gettin' throwed (hee-hee!) 
 Trippin' on niggas wearin' these Rumplestilskin clothes 
 But to each his own 
 Who knows, behind closed do's 
 But nevermind, I'll mind mine 
 I'm just gettin' blowed 
 Yeah 
 Blowed 
 Yeah 
 Gettin' blowed 
 While you're mumbling, I'm crumbling erb 
 Niggas always tripping about something they heard 
 It's so easy to be thee 
 One behind the topic 
 And the subject, you won't love it 
 But there is no way to stop it 
 And ain't no need in plotting 
 Cause that shit will leave you nothing 
 But alone and rotten 
 Friends gone and forgotten 
 But there's another option 
 You can just say fuck it! 
 Pull out your dick and tell all them hoes to suck it! 
 Been through it, influenced 
 Men do some crazy shit 
 Dabbled here on different drugs 
 That fucked me up and made me quit 
 My lady bitch, slut, ho, or whatever left me 
 (Which one?) 
 Shit! All of 'em, they never kept me! 
 Marriage swept me off my feet when I was younger 
 But yet, and still at big events 
 They wonder why I brung her 
 Yes, I hunger 
 For someone to understand the code 
 You can knock three times, you'll see 
 I'm just gettin' blowed 
 Yeah 
 Blowed 
 Yeah 
 Gettin' blowed 
 Yes sir, real early in the morning 
 I be on that weed 
 In the afternoon 
 Yes, I zoom-zoom 
 Until late in the evening 
 And then at night, I just take flight 
 Up, up, and away 
 So if you see me flying by high 
 Don't mind me 
 I'm just gettin' blowed 
 Yeah 
 Blowed 
 Yeah 
 Gettin' blowed 
 Blowed 
 Yeah 
 Gettin' blowed
