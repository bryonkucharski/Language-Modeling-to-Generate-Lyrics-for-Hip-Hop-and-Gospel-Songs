I wasn't gonna come but now that I'm here 
 I'm glad I came, the club is bomb 
 Greens got a big cooler of drank, he gives me some 
 Then I step to bitches with game we try to run 
 Up in these hoes, don't even know their name 
 They have no bra, no panties, they never say no 
 They just hyper out and go on they way 
 All the way home 
 I'll just wait 'cause inside is much too stuffy 
 Gotta find some pussy 
 The club don't close till three 
 And if you're lookin' for me I'll be 
 Sittin' in front of the ride 
 Drinkin' and smokin' some weed 
 Checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can see 
 I didn't know that there were 
 So many hoes round here 
 Got a parkin' lot full 
 And I'll be checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can pull 
 I spotted this bitch that I use to hit 
 Back in the day she thinks I'm rich 
 Therefore she feels that I should pay 
 She doesn't got dick 
 Nice palm sized tits but there is no way that I can give 
 Her money for something I get for free 
 She had no bra, no panties, she's ready to bone 
 Even stock on her cock or you get ready to bone 
 I think I'll just wait, that just don't sound good to me 
 Gotta find some cheap pussy 
 The club don't close till three 
 And if you're lookin' for me I'll be 
 Sittin' in front of the ride 
 Drinkin' and smokin' some weed 
 Checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can see 
 I didn't know that there were 
 So many hoes round here 
 Got a parkin' lot full 
 And I'll be checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can pull 
 It's almost nine, it's damn near two 
 It's gettin' late and that's a sign 
 Of all the stars out on the chase, niggas be lyin' 
 Tryin' to win these hoes like it's a race and I don't mind 
 If I see a nigga all in my bitch face 
 If she has no bra, no panties 
 Look like she wanna bone 
 And it ain't no pain at all 
 Just go and take that hoe home 
 And I'll just wait for one of these freaks 
 To come with me to make whoopy 
 Find a piece of pussy 
 My watch says a quarter to three 
 And if you're lookin' for me I'll be 
 Sittin' in front of the ride 
 Drinkin' and smokin' some weed 
 Checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can see 
 I didn't know that there were 
 So many hoes round here 
 Got a parkin' lot full 
 And I'll be checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can pull 
 Sittin' in front of the ride 
 Drinkin' and smokin' some weed 
 Checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can see 
 I didn't know that there were 
 So many hoes round here 
 Got a parkin' lot full 
 And I'll be checkin' out the bitches 
 Tryin' to see what I can pull
