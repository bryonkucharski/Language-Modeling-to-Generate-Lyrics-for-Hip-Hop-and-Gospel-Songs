Once Upon the wings of love 
 I dashed up on the craft 
 Wrinkled foreheads greet me, but I'm high therefore I laugh 
 Attendants rush me, to check my bags 
 They said "hurry, 'cause we 15 minutes behind 
 We have one seat left and its way in the back 
 It shouldn't be too hard to find, go sit down." 
 I said aiite bitch, but I said it kinda low 
 It won't no problem go towards the back I go 
 Had a little weed on me didn't want it to show 
 Some helicopter took my patna 3 months to grow 
 So, I slid to the rear to find my chair 
 Hey pretty girl is this my chair here? 
 The key Y) didn't even crack a smile 
 She smelt my black and Mild 
 She think I be actin' wild 
 And she refused to move her purse 
 Out the little little seat freak trying to get the dude to curse 
 Wanted a nigga to rant and rave 
 Just because of my color, thinkin' I can't behave 
 I said, "Pardon me ma'am, excuse me miss 
 But there's no reason for you to be pissed 
 I done paid my dues, paid my bills and fees 
 Just wanna sit by the window here while I'm feeling the breeze" caise 
 Right now I feel so good that I 
 Won't let nothin' or nobody bring me down 
 Can't wait until the pilot finally levitate 
 Trying to find a way to feel just like this way everyday 
 Breezier, Breezier 
 Breezier, Breezier 
 Breezier, Breezier 
 Attendants walked the asles as if we were in some type of camp 
 I seen all my belongings, big and small things 
 Disappearing underneath on ramp 
 Man, I started feeling kinda wicked 
 Should have never bought a ticket 
 Put on my seat belt in case 
 We land in shit creek 
 I had to grit me teeth 
 But then things kinda felt in place 
 I couldn't wait, broke out my big bag 
 Put it on the tray table 
 Wheels start rolling, table wouldn't stay stable 
 Waiter walked up and said do you want a beer? 
 I said yeah, he got happy start doing a cheer 
 He gave a bag of nuts to the nigga next in line 
 Put on a gas mask and pointed to the exit sign 
 I'm checkin' it odd, I'm feeling the breeze 
 And everybody on the plane lookin' at me, cause 
 Right now I feel so good that I 
 Won't let nothin' or nobody bring me down 
 Can't wait until the pilot finally levitate 
 Tryin' to find a way to feel just like this everyday 
 Breezier, Breezier x3 
 The weather started getting rough 
 And the big ass plane shook 
 I started trippin', cause everybody was flippin and dippin 
 And even hiding pocket books from crooks 
 I'm like look 
 I know its kinda scary, it's a long way down 
 You should have had your shit together when you was on the ground 
 Ain't no time for whining and crying about dying 
 'Cause when it's your time, it's your time, but right now I'm 
 Feel so Right now I feel so good that I 
 Won't let nothin' or nobody bring me down 
 Can't wait until the pilot finally levitate 
 Trying to find a way to feel just like this everyday
