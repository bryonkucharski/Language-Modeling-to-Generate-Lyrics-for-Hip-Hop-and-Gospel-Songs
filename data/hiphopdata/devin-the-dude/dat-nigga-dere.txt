Damn, hey, nice to meet you again 
 It's been a minute since I sent you 
 And it seems that you doin' so fine 
 You know sometimes I wish you were still mine 
 'Cause all the freaky things we used to do 
 The stuff you taught other things what I can do to you 
 I never forget all of the knowledge you gave me 
 Whenever I was feeling down you knew how to raise me 
 What a lady like you doing in a place like this 
 Hey, let's go to my place right quick 
 And quickly get the party started 
 And bring back memories oh shit 
 Somebody park like holla nigga 
 Me, you, her, wharap nigga, he want you 
 You heard, hey he want you 
 Alright cool, cool

 Wish I could turn back time, girl 
 You'd still be mine, girl

 I wouldn't think twice, girl 
 To have you in my life, girl 
 Who in the hell is dat nigga dere 
 Here take my number down 
 I'll probably see you around 
 At the club somewhere right here in H-town 
 You better hurry up and leave 
 That nigga's looking kinda crazy 
 Like he drunk desperate for his lady 
 Tell him how I used to do you smack you on the butt 
 Back in your daddy buick 
 Yo, I'm just playing, but you know, all I'm saying is 
 Whenever you need something inside you 
 Call me, girl, I'll satisfy you any day or any night 
 I put this dick right in your life 
 Now if you his wife then now nevermind 
 'Cause ain't no sense for somebody dying or doing time for no pussy 
 But if you wanna give it to me that's fine 
 Then come with me and leave him behind 'cause 
 You sure looking fine, girl 
 Wish I could turn back time, girl 
 You'd still be mine, girl 
 Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

 Bumping his gums, thinking he gonna do something 
 Shit if he gonna swing at me, I'ma swing back 
 Nigga, I can hang with you something 
 But there's no way to talk motherfucker nigga 
 Ey you, I know you nigga, shit 
 Say man, I rap, man, I wanna do something 
 I've been trying to get in touch with you, man 
 You so hard to get in touch with, man 
 My girl told me that she knew you and you can put me on 
 Whenever you need something inside you 
 (I didn't knew you were with this beautiful girl right here) 
 Call me, girl, I'll satisfy you

 Any day or any night
