You thinkin' nobody care and you're in it by yourself 
 Takin' anythin', steady destroyin' your health 
 And it's almost 2 and you on ya ass 
 Lookin' at the clock, watchin' opportunity pass 
 You got a few ends, so you order some friends in 
 As soon as they come in you ready and willin' to spend 
 But back in the day you used to stay broke 
 And you had no friends because they laughed and they joked 
 And poked fun at your shoes and clothes 
 Now you got a house full of booze and hoes 
 And anything goes with no house rules 
 You need to stop, you about to lose 
 Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 I see you're car hoppin' late nights, workin' the graveyard shift 
 Could use a lift up out this hellhole you're trapped in 
 See your reflection flicker in that syringe 
 Flashback, so when your life was on the right track way back when 
 You was the homecomin' queen, now you the neighborhood fiend 
 Do anything, there is nothin' that you haven't seen 
 Your kids prayin' one day you could get clean 
 And kick the habit, leave it all behind before you lose 
 Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Chasin' dreams might be your only chance, you better make it count 
 Second guessin'll leave you assed out 
 Real life's a blessin', stressin', guessin' the best route 
 I'm still like if it don't feel right then it ain't on 
 If it don't fit don't force it, it don't belong 
 I been blessed and all of my drama forever gone, wishin' 
 Just wishful thinkin' whether I'm right or wrong 
 Listen on my mama whenever I'm all alone 
 All I hear is what don't kill you make you motherfuckin' strong 
 Proof's in the truth, so don't be scared to pray 
 For your family, friends, and enemies every day, hey 
 Might sing the blues cause shit that you go through 
 Or make you crazy and confused but don't you lose 
 Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away 
 Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away
