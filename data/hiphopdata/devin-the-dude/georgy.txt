It was a cool afternoon, the first day of school 
 Everybody wonderin' whose the new dude 
 With the Kangol sneakers with the wide shoe strangs 
 Wonderin', wonderin' where he from and how he do thangs 
 His eyes stayed red but he kept his mind clear 
 The brothers knew he wasn't from no where 'round here 
 And the girls kept whisperin' in each others ear 
 It seems they didn't care about the smell of the beer 
 They were all on his thing, a couple of 'em tried to grab it 
 Takin' their chances didn't know of his bad habits 
 A two timin' cheat and quick to make up a lie 
 Just to be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 The girls didn't take caution when they was flossin' wit Georgy 
 Porgy turn a simple party into an orgy 
 And just when they thought that they was the one that he chose 
 He get rid of them quick and get some more 
 Just when they thought that they was the one that he chose 
 He get rid of them quick and get some more 
 Just when they thought that they was the one that he chose 
 He get rid of them quick and get some more 
 No time for lames it's a shame what he do to women 
 His mouth spit game like a snake shootin' venom 
 And after he hit 'em some claim that he's no good 
 But they stick wit' him guess the pain feel so good 
 Take, take what he can get givin' up nuttin' why 
 He don't think that he should pay for the puddin' pie 
 Takin' em, breakin' em, fakin' 'em out 
 He just be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 He kept a girl on the side, he keep one at home 
 And those who wasn't smart they couldn't leave him alone 
 He'd pick one of 'em a different one, yep, each weekend 
 Undressin' 'em caressin' em, kissin' em, freakin' em 
 But last Friday night, oh, this what I heard 
 Outside his driveway parked a Thunderbird 
 Georgy couldn't hear nothin' but the headboard knockin' 
 Looked up and saw a strange woman in the window watchin' 
 Didn't know if it was Tina, Tanea or Toila 
 But whoever it was they had a gray revolver 
 They asked no question, just start bustin' 
 George was in shock couldn't say or do nothin' 
 He just laid there stiff lookin' froze 
 And all he could think about was I got too many hoes 
 And all he could think about was I got too many hoes 
 And all he could think about was I got too many hoes 
 In the bed wit' no clothesjust waitin' to die 
 Just for kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Georgy, Georgy 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry 
 Kiss the girls and make them cry
