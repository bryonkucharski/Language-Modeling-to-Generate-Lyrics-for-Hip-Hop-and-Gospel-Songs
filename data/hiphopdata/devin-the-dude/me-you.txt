Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Excuse me, I ain't tryin' to be all up on you 
 But, damn you so fine to me 
 Would offer you a drank, I see you already got two 
 Let me know when you finished those, I got you 
 I'll be coolin' in the corner, smokin' marijuana 
 With some partners of mine 
 Hey, and if you got the time 
 Maybe we can meet back at the show 
 I know a few places that we can go 
 We can just cool out, chill, relax 
 Food, wine, beer, and a sack of weed 
 That I got from Amsterdam 
 Yup, overseas, come, go with me 
 When it's time to slide 
 You oughta step inside my ride 
 You know when the club might end 
 Let's get away from your nosy ass friends 
 It'll just be 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 You say that you plan to get tipsy 
 So your home girl's drivin' 
 You been drinkin' just as much as I've been 
 We at the same level, you can speak your mind and 
 Clear your thoughts, let out the freak sometimes 
 I've met a lot of bitches, quite a few hoes 
 Ran across women and I like those 
 And I can tell the way you smell that you's a real woman 
 And the noodles that you cook are not Roman 
 But more like egg fettuccini 
 You never have to beg for a penny 
 And I just wanna know ya, I wanna try to show ya 
 Maybe I could mow yo' yard 
 And I cut well and my motor is self propelled 
 Don't worry about nothin', I won't tell 
 You know, no tools needed it'll just be 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 I see the club 'bout to close 
 Lights turnin' on, people bustin' out the do's 
 And I ain't finna' run after no hoes 
 My mind's made up, have you made up yo's? 
 You the woman I chose, I respect your mind 
 I ain't just tryin' to dick and dine 
 I'm tryin' a good time, you've been deservin' it 
 Chill at my crib, have a drank, smoke erb a bit 
 Go tell your girl you gon' be alright 
 'Cause you gonna be chillin' with me tonight 
 That's just a friendly invite 
 Curious about me? I'll give you more insight 
 A little later 
 A whole bunch of shit up in the 'frigerator 
 Aww, shit 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do 
 Me, you 
 We oughta see what we can do
