Hey baby come here 
 I got something to tell you 
 See I've been thinking a lot about you lately 
 And well... 
 We've spent a lot of time together 
 I think I'm kind of in to you 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'm feeling sort of nervous and anxious 
 To tell you what I'm going through 
 Well it might be the night 
 Or it might the bright moonlight 
 All I see is a wonderful need 
 And beautiful too 
 So precious and new 
 And this is all I want to do 
 I want to kiss you so bad 
 So bad it's driving me mad 
 I want to kiss you real good 
 Oh and I'm wishing I could 
 (I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you) 
 I have a little tiny confession 
 I don't know what to do 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Oh I have a little tiny obsession 
 With something that's attached to you 
 Well it might be your eyes 
 Or it might be your nice big ooh 
 I don't know if I want my cover blown 
 I want the truth 
 Every time I'm with you 
 This is what I want to do 
 I want to kiss you so bad 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (Can I kiss you?) 
 So bad it's driving me mad 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (I want to kiss you) 
 I want to kiss you real good 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (And I'm wishin' I could) 
 Oh and I'm wishing I could 
 (I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you) 
 Well it might be the smile 
 Or the way you look into my eyes 
 Baby ooh what to do 
 I won't know until I kiss you 
 That's why, that's why I got to have you 
 I got to have you baby 
 I got to have you 
 Oh that why I 
 I got to have you 
 I got to have you baby 
 I got to have you 
 I want to kiss you so bad 
 I want to kiss you so bad 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (Can I kiss you?) 
 So bad it's driving me mad 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (I want to kiss you) 
 I want to kiss you real good 
 (Just want to kiss you baby) 
 (And I'm wishin' I could) 
 Oh and I'm wishing I could 
 (I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you) 
 Just want to kiss you baby 
 Can I kiss you? 
 Just want to kiss you baby 
 I want to kiss you 
 Just want to kiss you baby 
 And I'm wishin' I could 
 I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
