(Chorus: L.C.) 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 (Verse 1: Devin the Dude) 
 I know I just left your crib 
 But, I'm about to make the block and come back 
 It's too hot over here, matter of fact 
 Police behind me right now and shit! 
 I'm kinda' bent 
 I'm glad I got tint 
 Damn! I hope they don't try to tow my shit! 
 I should've chilled, though 
 No, them patron shots 
 See, I drink Crown Royal 
 That's my drink! 
 Know what I'm talkin' about? 
 But, nevertheless, I gotta' stay between the lines 
 'Cause if I trip, then I dip 
 Then if I swerve one more time 
 They gonna be... 
 (Bridge: Devin the Dude) 
 On my ass 
 Like white on rice 
 Like shit on grass 
 So I grab what I have and stash it 
 I got the time for no harassment 
 (I can't make it home) 
 (Interlude: Devin the Dude) 
 Aww, shit! 
 Aww, damn, baby, I'm gonna have to call you back 
 Yeah, they're pullin' me over 
 (Excuse me, sir - you sober?) 
 (Chorus: L.C.) 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 (Verse 2: Devin the Dude) 
 Yeah, they got me 
 He tried to pull me 
 Out the car, I had to resist 
 He almost shot me 
 But, I'm cool 
 He found a blunt, it wasn't burnin' 
 But he smelled it and he checked it 
 I had a warrant in East Texas 
 So I was cuffed and stuffed 
 In the back of the car 
 He didn't report the cigar 
 I guess he thought I was a star 
 But we drove real far 
 Fo' about six hours 
 I really had to piss, my wrist no longer had power 
 Couldn't even take a shower 
 Surrounded by niggas 
 I'll only be there a couple of hours, I figured 
 As far as the weed, I think he kept it and he smoked it 
 But he got me on a DUI and I'm on some broke shit 
 (Interlude: Devin the Dude) 
 So I'm a need you to go down to the bail bondsman, y'know 
 And try to come up with a few funds 
 And hurry up and run down here 
 And get me outta this one! 
 Hello? 
 (Chorus: L.C.) 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot of a patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me 
 I might be gone! 
 I can't make it home 
 ... 
 ... 
 ... I can't make it home 
 One blunt, one more shot...
