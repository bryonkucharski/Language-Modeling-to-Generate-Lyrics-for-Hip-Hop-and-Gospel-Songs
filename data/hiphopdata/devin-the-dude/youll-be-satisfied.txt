Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be glad at the time 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be satisfied, girl 
 I know I haven't been coming around like I used to 
 Been slipping through the corn 
 Where I thought I was gonna lose you 
 I keep you mind, I'm going weeks at a time 
 I wish I could take you with me 
 'Cause I need you around 
 You second guessing, yes, distressing 
 'Cause I'm going so much 
 Realize you'll be surprised 
 How much I long for your touch 
 Sometimes I look in the skies 
 Hoping to see your eyes 
 Somewhere I stare but you're not there 
 I got thirty two days left but first thing asap 
 Right when I get back 
 You'll caress this, I'll hit that 
 I can't help but, to think 
 Somebody's holding you tight 
 And he's got you in his arms 
 When it's cold in the night 
 I get upset with just the thought of it 
 But this my fault of it 
 But when I get back, you'll gonna get all of this 
 Until then I'm just gonna keep daydreaming 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be glad at the time 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be satisfied, girl 
 Every hour that go by, I'm missing you 
 You know why because you're so freaky 
 So fine and so fly but you're so tired of me 
 Being gone so long and I appreciate 
 The way you stay strong 
 And hold on for this bond 
 'Cause I'm missing the way that you moan 
 When I put it in 
 You know it's worth waiting for 
 Ain't nothing good in ending this 
 Things that you say, that you love so much 
 I'm missing the way you be giving my nuts a rub 
 I'm at these clubs, looking at these sluts 
 But they don't matter, girl 
 It's you who I'm thinking of 
 And I'll be back in a moment 
 Go get some more wet 
 And throw it on the ground 
 'Cause I got some motherfucking crown 
 It's going down, don't worry about me 
 Looking at no whores 'cause soon as I get back 
 I'm gonna put it in yours until then I'll 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be glad at the time 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be satisfied, girl 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be glad at the time 
 Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you 
 Everyday that pass me by 
 I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you 
 And you'll be satisfied, girl
