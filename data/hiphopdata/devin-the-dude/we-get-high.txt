DJ, play that song man, play that song DJ 
 Yeah, time to roll up somethin', man 
 Smoke somethin', man 
 Grab a drank, grab somethin' to smoke on 
 Yeah, it's about that time 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 (Yo how much is that?) 
 110 to spend wit' a friend, why not? 
 My shit look like my eyelids are inside out 
 Not a dime this time but a nice sized quarter 
 We call our shit coffee but we don't dip it in that water 
 We honor it with no sugar and cream, straight green 
 Then it's chicken and ribs, baked beans, my plates clean 
 Then I find the rhythm, mind if I give 'em a little? 
 I'm kinda high right now so I'll just go and hit a McGriddle 
 Then I'll twiddle my thumbs, my direct connect is gone 
 But my middle man is 'bout to come with some more dro 
 Oh yo, you know the logo, we higher and a mofo 
 We get high 
 Like cool brown, that's what scoots round 
 Ain't no time better than this, so let's do it now 
 Put our shit together now, we got some dealer's shit 
 Call the babes all decipherin' and then we phillo shit 
 And pull our wigs back, may drink a six pack 
 Damn that bitch spent, bra let me hit dat 
 We got these hoes we got the dranks we got the dro 
 We got security and they knockin' at the door 
 They oughta know 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 Now all of a sudden I'm buzzin' 
 I only hit that hoe twice 
 But if you pass it right back 
 Shit that'll be so nice 
 Yeah, so I guess that mean the clock starts now 
 As I take a hit, that's some pretty strong shit 
 It ain't hard to admit that I'm thinkin' I can't quit 
 'Cause man I love the coughee sip, brew, laugh, fuck and trip 
 Cough one time for people that's over there 
 I'ma cough two times for ladies that's everywhere 
 We get high 
 Yeah, 'cause that's the way that it goes 
 I blow some smoke out my mouth and the rest up my nose 
 Now my new cologne smell is the smoke in my clothes 
 I'm blowin' smoke signals, now what's the opposite of low? 
 (High) 
 I'm starvin', somebody tell me where the groceries be 
 I've got the munchies, feel like I haven't ate a bite in weeks 
 Then I fell asleep, woke up wit' another sweet 
 Start that shit all over again, you see they know 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 Man, this ain't no Cheech and Chong movie 
 We smoke it into the doobie 
 If you ask who we be, we be the O Double D 
 The proof is in the puddin', the puddin' be in the booth 
 My man he got some good he said he'd be the truth 
 He ain't lyin', anytime to be buyin' a bag of hucklebee 
 Hell, you could tell the smell is always stuck on me 
 My nerves kinda bad, I need a stabilizer 
 Star Trek Enterprise with a vaporizer 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 We get high 
 All day, all day every day, smoke somethin' 
 Fasho while we fuckin' your hoe 
 Shit man, hell yeah
