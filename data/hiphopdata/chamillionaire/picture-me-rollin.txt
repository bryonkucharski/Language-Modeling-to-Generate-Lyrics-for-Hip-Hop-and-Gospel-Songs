 I didn't fall off like these niggaz was hopin, so they should 
 (Picture me rollin') 
 You should picture me rollin' 
 See me shinin, you should picture me rollin' 
 Because I'm doin' good 
 Yeah, I was just walkin' this (yes), while y'all was talkin' this 
 Burnin up the bootleg market, like I'm an arsonist (yes) 
 Had to get smart with this (yes), studied and sharpened it 
 Plot gets darker than the thoughts in a coffin get 
 Remember I walked into L.A. Reid's offices (yes) 
 Had to walk outta there feelin' like I was not the ish 
 But they didn't owe me nothin' (yes), gave me no promises 
 But the industry still gonna see me, I promise this 
 Universal Records (yes), I'm wreckin all the lists (yes) 
 The crane can't even lift all my accomplishments 
 Even when I was indie, was bringin' y'all the hits 
 Actin' like I was crazy, I got a conscience kid 
 In a interview they would say you look kinda pissed 
 Up against the world, middle finger for all the continents (yes) 
 F. Koopa, what's the best of my compliments? 
 Indie label, the hell with slavery, I'm all for this (yes) 
 Like this the damn thanks I get 
 And thank you, I'ma just focus on the bank I get 
 Used to be with Paid and Swisha, but I made my "Click" 
 The game greazy, that's the reason why I think I'm slick (yes) 
 Lets take it back to the beginning, when I wasn't winnin' 
 With women and gold grinnin, my pockets were so thin and 
 Chamillion, before the million, no candy and chrome spinnin 
 Amazing how things still go sour, with no lemon 
 I'm poor baby, of course little nigga tacky 
 My Jordans isn't matchin', of course my little hair was nappy 
 I remember how the rest of the boys was lookin' at me 
 The day that I got cut from the core, like it made 'em happy 
 Cause your spot is yours (yours), now my locker gettin' clean 
 Not good enough for my team, not good enough for my dream (what?) 
 Exactly what it is a dream, I acted like a triple beam 
 Was under the rap game and I turned it into a scheme (yes) 
 Now when they speak on me, they say it's about the 
 Time that he's got his props, hate when these niggaz doubt me 
 Now you're with your spouse, she used to diss me and now she 
 Missin' teeth, lookin' like she been kissin' on coffee (yes) 
 I should take your confidence, throw it up in the air and gun it down (down) 
 But I don't knowin' that was goes around, always comes around 
 Now everybody wanna come around, givin' a brother sound 
 Now you speak just cause you seein how Koopa run it now
