And now for a message from (Chamillitary Mayne) 
 Yours truly, haha 
 Why it sound like it sayin' my name? y-yeah 
 ChaMilli ChaMilli ChaMilli ChaMilli 
 I'm you'llin on 'em like Soulja Boy 
 Bombin' on 'em like Ice-T 
 So you better do the right thing 
 Like a throwback Spike Lee 
 Chamillionaire, the mixtape god'll answer your prayer 
 Now that the best verse on Milli is right here 
 If you ain't making a milli or more then what is you on the beat for? 
 Detour, he poor, but he say he a d boy 
 D boy? All the rappers act like they need war 
 But when it's war they equivalent to the peace core 
 I murder mixtapes for years, they probably told you "no way" 
 Everybody know the truth bout what I did in the past like OJ 
 You in the way of the paper chase when I get on the tollway 
 You better be able to jump an Aston Martin like you're Kobe 
 If you can't handle the trill then you'd better not interview me 
 Everybody's a gangsta, you fakers could never fool me 
 I live in a suave house, I stay Tony Draped up in jewelery 
 I know that I rap a lot so they leave the crib with the tooley 
 I don't really give a care about how any of these haters view me 
 Probably think he gon' shoot me, stretch me out like a dooley 
 Vivid imagination, colorful as a Coogi 
 Must of been watching Scarface and got your life out the movie 
 OKAY! I'm hearing snoring, the industry's getting boring 
 All of the millions they been enjoying, from publishing and touring 
 Write a check it's private jet, you write a check and it go boing 
 And I swear this track says milli so much that it can get annoying 
 Somebody please send a message to Bangladesh, I ain't the best 
 Today is backwards day, and that will also mean I ain't the fresh- 
 Est rapper, make a bet and I will take the bet 
 Was looking for a place to get, I pulled out a pen and placed a check 
 Somebody send a message to Dr. Dre and Eminem 
 They taking so long to drop that we jam Soulja Boy instead of them 
 And YOUUUU hear what I'm saying if you're intelligent 
 It looks to me your girl has been everywhere that my umbrella's been 
 It's raining Benjamin's, but that ain't 3k is it? 
 It ain't a Benjamin or an Andre if you ain't get it 
 You gotta rewind it, don't try to tell me that I can't spit it 
 Sick 'cause if it isn't then we just isn't in the same clinic 
 And to tell the truth, I don't know if the DJs dead homie 
 But the way it's going, Autotune will be at the ceremony 
 When it's time to hear the EULOGY, ain't no foolin' me 
 I'll make Kanye West tell you that Lupe isn't COOL as me 
 Don't put my name with beef, you nerds are such a tease 
 It's like you freakin' Alicia the way you stroke your Keys 
 And socially, no one as dope as me and they ain't supposed to be 
 I'm over free, now the F'n fee is what you owe to me 
 You know you're no debris, but you're a germ mayne 
 I got the sanitizer that'll extinguish your fame 
 I'm the villain and you Gilligan, lost if you get in the middle when 
 I'm swimming, and I'm killing them, with all my killer pen-a-men- 
 Ship, you ain't tall enough, raise your hand if you have to talk 
 Slim's belt to Ross' belly man, you half a boss 
 You'd think it was made of pig skin the way I pass it off 
 You know the cannon gon' be with me like I'm Asher Roth 
 And I'm so dysfunctional that the flow is that Britney 
 And the mixtapes is crackin', every verse is that Whitney 
 Before you gettin' online, before you try to Datpiff me 
 *Inhale* Big breath like you inherited Shaq's kidney 
 A Milli
