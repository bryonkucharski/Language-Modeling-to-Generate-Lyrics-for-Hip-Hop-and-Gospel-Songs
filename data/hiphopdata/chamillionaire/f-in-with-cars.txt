You bust the windows out my car 
 I already told you playing I wasn't with 
 So Ima come knock on your nigga, shit 
 Can't hit you so he'll ? come see me please 
 Better get your bitch before she gets you scarred 
 Best ? to tell her not to come around here 
 My gal got a 44 to keep the area clear 
 Take heater ? her somewhere I'll bury you near 
 For busting windows out my car 
 Not tripping on the whip that shit's expendable 
 But you gotta understand the principle 
 Even now I'm trying to be sensible 
 Fuck that bitch you bust the windows out my car 
 Ill come through now and put your shit up in smoke 
 Something inside your mind has got to broke 
 For you to risk everything you got 'cause you missing? 
 Gotta go bust windows out my car 
 It ain't my fault that you took it too far 
 Play by the rules guess you forgot who you are 
 Simple role play you are not the star 
 Somebody better call the law 
 Fore I call my folks to break you off 
 Niggas and bitches 
 That's doing the shit yeah you stupid 
 Stop all of that counting and stalking 
 You're not number one and you knew it 
 Now you can't even nigga fuck 'cause you blew it 
 Should have listened when you told yourself you shouldn't do it 
 Now you're in a cell face drinking fluid 
 And that's where you are for 
 Being stupid fucking with cars 
 And that's where you are for 
 Being stupid fucking with cars 
 And that's where you are for 
 Being stupid fucking with cars 
 And that's where you are for 
 Being stupid fucking with cars 
 Chamillionaire: 
 (She got like that charlie? hold up man 
 Listen up) 
 Charlie forgot to tell you after you then she called me 
 She said she got to houston so I met her at? 
 Well it's a long story but I bet you she probably 
 On the way to try to bust the window out them impaly 
 She said her exfriend was the way that she found me, 
 When I was with her she was speaking about you real hardly 
 I was really addicted to the shape of her body 
 Had her coming out her cloth stepping out the cavalli 
 She's raw a a sushi plate without the wasabi 
 Until she said she rap and chamillille could you sign me 
 Had to go our separate ways just like whitney and bobby 
 Accidently fell asleep and she was laying beside 
 Woke up to realize she already was outty 
 Then I, put on my shoes and went down to the lobby 
 Look at what she did to my car G 
 She busted your windows and now looks like she done got me 
 Oh no, not the benz, crazy girl man, all right, call them up
