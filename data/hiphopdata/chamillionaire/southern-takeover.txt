(Chamillionaire) 
 The sound of revenge, haha 
 Woo, tell 'em what it is mayne 
 Tell 'em what it is 
 (Pastor Troy) 
 Welcome to the New World Order 
 Atlanta, Georgia 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Houston, Texas, he already know 
 (Pastor Troy) 
 The south is takin' over 
 (Chorus x2 - Chamillionaire) 
 Just look over your shoulder 
 Shoulder 
 Let me see who just showed up 
 SShowed up 
 It's the southern takeover 
 It's over 
 You better tell 'em I got drinks that stand on top try and stop 
 Pop pop pop 
 (Mr. Mike) 
 It's the Mr. Falcon Toter, cook cook coke with baking soda 
 Blun roller, dro smoker, wood gripper, pistol whipper 
 Light your nigga if he figure fuckin' wit my click will make him 
 Richer, he should know instead of it will make him deader 
 Deader money, fucking with my money, get yo money 
 Stacked right out of Sunday School 
 On a bright and sunny Sunday, this ain't fun 
 I ain't joking bout my coke and package from a shaolin 
 Might kidnap your wife and daughter, bury them down deep in Georgia 
 No D.A. or fucking lawyers prosecuting witnesses 
 We executing, start to shooting, starting to do this fucking violence 
 Start a riot, get this muthafucker crunk or as crunk you can get it 
 That that dro, I'm a hit it, out of line, nigga I spit it 
 Spit it, live it, 'cause I live it, you don't walk it, you just talkin' 
 Pistol totin and they knowing that's my snow and got his dope and 
 I ain't holdin', steady slangin, right on your black-a-block 
 Hit your trap, set up shop, try and stop, blot blot block 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 Just look over your shoulder 
 Shoulder 
 Let me see who just showed up 
 Showed up 
 It's the southern takeover 
 It's over 
 You betta tell 'em I got drinks that stand on top try and stop 
 Pop pop pop 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 This ain't about a image, this ain't about a gimmick 
 Cause you stand to the side and the game gotta diminish 
 I'm damn sure that this city don't think that he the realest 
 He whooping on his ass before he finishing his sentence 
 I've only got a minute to tell you about a digit 
 You looking at a nigga like I ain't about to get it 
 I'm looking at the money like I ain't about to finish 
 So you need to mind your business if you worried bout your business 
 Uh, I'm a H-Town Soldier, I'm a come 
 With the trunk up, and don't remind cha 
 If you say your getting it, shoulda told you 'bout a 
 Nigga named Chamillionaire that's fo sho a problem 
 You don't want no problem 
 Problem 
 Got amnesia gonna let the fo-fo remind 'em 
 Yeah you tip on and ride em, We ride 4-4s when the dough beside 'em 
 6'6 taller looking like he a sinner, 10 tattoos looking like he a killer 
 Skinny ass niggas don't fight with a nigga, Pull out a billfold, put a price on a nigga 
 It's kinfolk, put a knife in a nigga from his car to his pocket then right in his liver 
 It was a big boy to put a slice in the middle, ? Mr. Mike with the killer 
 Don't mess with the south, homie that's a dream, hallucinating or imagining 
 We so XXL with the gats I mean, something ready to blow in the magazine 
 You know that them southern cash is mean, front dents smile for me when I stash my cream 
 Pull up with the candy paint that'll match my green, Killer, Pastor, they just ain't imagining 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 Just look over your shoulder 
 Shoulder 
 Let me see who just showed up 
 Showed up 
 It's the southern takeover 
 It's over 
 You betta tell 'em I got drinks that stand on top try and stop 
 Pop pop pop 
 (Pastor Troy) 
 Y'all know me as PT, well uh huh and all of that 
 Black on black with black tip, I can't help but represent 
 I content I wanna know who the fuck you take me for 
 Studio rappers without your boy's tape, drop my top and bust my ak 
 No more play in G-A, yeah that's a classic 
 Riding in the classic, totin' me a plastic 
 Send 'em to the casket, send 'em to the morgue 
 Slap me a nigga 'cause I'm muthafuckin' bored 
 Chamillionaire, I kinda fond of my surroundings 
 Get my Desert Eagle and get to muthafuckin' pounding 
 Up and down the street, throwin' heat out the driver seat 
 Riding to the beat, tell them niggas adjust they feet
