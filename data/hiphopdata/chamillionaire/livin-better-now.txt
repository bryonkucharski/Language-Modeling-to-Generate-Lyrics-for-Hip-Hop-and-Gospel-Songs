(Verse 1:) 
 They see me and they be like koopa where the heck have ya been 
 Course you wouldn't know cause where I'm at you never had bein 
 Money that I'm looking at it really ever has being 
 Pound, euro, ruppee it's whatever a yen 
 Swimsuit models at the do tell tyson tell em come in 
 Gotta have a working visa and some cheddar ta spend 
 They say revenge is really something that's embeded to sins 
 Hope god forgive me cause I got it they could get it again 
 Hold up, saw snoop n' jigga they told me to stay the humble guy 
 Saw 50 cent and he told me create a homicide 
 Them universal clowns told me I need to dumb it down 
 But crash dummies don't ride with insurance on they rides 
 Stylist and the media training is what ya have to get 
 It's your whole image just created from outta tablets 
 Fickle fans flock to these fakers like it's a magnet 
 I'm accurate stay stuntin n stackin go getcha camera trick 
 (Chorus:) 
 Cause I'm living better now 
 I'm living good 
 I'm living gooood 
 I'm living good 
 (Verse 2:) 
 Uh 
 I got the stacks, I got the plaques, I wreck the tracks 
 I'm the dopest houston artist not opinion that is fact 
 I'm running laps, all round they raps, don't ever slack 
 And if I lose it all they know I'm jus gon get it back 
 They say I changed, hell yea I changed 
 Switched up my change, switched up my range 
 But it's the fame, that's what they blame 
 I can't complain, I'm still the same 
 Ain't with the same, people that came 
 Within the game but I love it mayne 
 Some think I'm strange I thought ya knew 
 Some tried to sue, lawyers are due 
 Publicists too but who are yoouu 
 She lookin cool, her sister too 
 Her man a fool ain't gotta clue 
 That I'm bout to do a body physical 
 That's true his boo, sick with the flu 
 My ride is I'll panna mirror deadly as ever 
 It's time to kill look at the wheeels 
 It give em chills, they taking stills 
 Taking pictures, I'm askin chickens 
 How does it to feel to know I'm 
 (Chorus)
