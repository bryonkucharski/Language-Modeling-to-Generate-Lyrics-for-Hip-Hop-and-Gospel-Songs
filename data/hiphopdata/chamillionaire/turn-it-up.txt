Chamillionaire: 
 Yeah! 
 It's the name they say is runnin' the game 
 Chamilitary remain. 
 Lil' Flip: 
 Lil' Flip in the building! 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Go ahead and hand over the torch 
 Super producer Scott Storch 
 And of course. 
 Chorus: Chamillionaire 
 I'm a show you how to get your shine on 
 Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song 
 Everybody keep on callin' my phone. 
 Which one of y'all am I gon' take home? 
 I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk 
 Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk 
 Tip your cups up until you get drunk 
 Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up. 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Give me that million dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it. 
 Who that is? That's the illest rapper choppin' and screwin' it 
 Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me, so I'm provin' it 
 Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit 
 Hittin' never miss rep yo' click and throw 'em high 
 Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I 
 Middle fingers to the sky, if they don't like that reply 
 'Cause any DJ that deny is a muthaf... lie 
 So give the ladies what that want 
 Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage 
 To feel the bass and tell the DJ Turn It Up 
 Yeah Sound of Revenge sayin' Universal to go get my plaque 
 Rappin's dead so I'm a bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track 
 Check out my track record, they'll say I'm a track wrecker 
 Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga (He's Back!) 
 You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya 
 Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that back hit ya. 
 Chorus: Chamillionaire 
 I'm a show you how to get your shine on 
 Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song 
 Everybody keep on callin' my phone. 
 Which one of y'all am I gon' take home? 
 I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk 
 Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk 
 Tip your cups up until you get drunk 
 Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up. 
 Lil' Flip: 
 When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang 
 If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang 
 I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane 
 Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain 
 I got homies on the West who like to gangbang 
 And I got homies on the East who do the same thing 
 I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang 
 5 karot diamond chain VVS is in it mayne 
 You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane 
 You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank 
 Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint 
 We got that oomp spray, but it still stank 
 You a lame so your dame playin' mind games 
 I'm a pimp so I stay in that mindframe 
 Niggas talk shit until I let that nine bang 
 Me and Duke in that maybach switchin' lanes. 
 Chorus: Chamillionaire 
 I'm a show you how to get your shine on 
 Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song 
 Everybody keep on callin' my phone. 
 Which one of y'all am I gon' take home? 
 I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk 
 Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk 
 Tip your cups up until you get drunk 
 Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up. 
 Bridge: Chamillionaire 
 Headed to the bar (I'm headed to the bar) 
 You know I'm V.I.P. (You know I'm V.I.P.) 
 And since you rollin' with a star (You rollin' with a star) 
 You V.I.P. with me. (Chamillitary hey hey) 
 Chamillionaire 
 Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rapper thinkin' they doin' it. 
 Who That Is? That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big 
 Multi-colored diamonds got us shinin' They say our jewelry sick 
 Houston got a problem and you don't want nothin' to do wit it. 
 Do you kid? I ain't think so I'm tippin' slow 
 Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow 
 Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go 
 When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho' 
 Told me that she didn't care about my money Wasn't hearin' it 
 Looks can be decevin' as Chamillion paint appearances 
 You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is 
 She got turned out quicker than my power steering did. 
 Chorus: Chamillionaire 
 I'm a show you how to get your shine on 
 Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song 
 Everybody keep on callin' my phone. 
 Which one of y'all am I gon' take home? 
 I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk 
 Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk 
 Tip your cups up until you get drunk 
 Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up.
