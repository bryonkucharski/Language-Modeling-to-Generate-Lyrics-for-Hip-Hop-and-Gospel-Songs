Chamillionaire - Talking: 
 Paul Willigan, you already know 
 Look 
 You might think you got her, on lock like a locker 
 I already got her, comin' out of her boxers 
 If she's hot and got curves 
 Don't let me spot her, 'cause you will spot her hoppin' into my dropper 
 Whenever the phone rings ya girl never be home 
 *BEEP* nigga leave a message after the tone 
 "Baby, I know ya home, you were right I was wrong 
 Let it be known, Chamillion is incredibly thrown 
 You know when he show and open up his trunk when he glowin' 
 Never go over a penny of gasoline when he po' it 
 I'ma fan, Koopa's insane he's almost perfect 
 Never polite grab a wood-wheel, he always hurt it" 
 Sue me, for all my bills or my 20 inch wheels 
 If you feel that you can still say the lizard ain't real 
 After I steal you in ya grill and force you to deal 
 With the pain all you can say is that nigga to real 
 Koopa... my accountant calls me Mr. Discount 
 'Cause I throw him his money back and say take dis count 
 Me and my nigga Tigga is some thuggin' guerillas 
 Dub-Wheelers, footlocker never nothin' in Dillards
