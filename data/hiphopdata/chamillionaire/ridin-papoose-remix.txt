Sound of Revenge (Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Cheea) 
 Remix! Jae Millz, Papoose and Chamillionaire (Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Cheea) 
 Chamilitary man (Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Ch, Cheea) 
 From the dirty south to the east coast 
 Same thing folks 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 The N.Y.P.D 
 Be hatin' 
 And hopin that they goin' to catch us ridin' dirty 
 Tryna catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryna catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryna catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryna catch me ridin' dirty 
 And in my hometown 
 It's the same thing 
 You know HPD can't catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty 
 Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty (he's back) 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 I'm a millionaire (yeah) 
 I deserve some respect 
 The reason you was hired 
 Was to serve and protect (don't serve and protect) 
 But burn up your cheque 
 Take you a year to make what I earn in a sec 
 Old white lady said I was disturbin her rest (Yup) 
 Let me put you on to some current events 
 Last two times that I saw the police 
 I got served a sapina and served an arrest (Yup) 
 Who the hell said the suburbs was the best 
 He a liar I gotta bring 'em back to the streets 
 Jae millz got beef I'm comin' back to the east 
 Papoose got beef I'm comin' back with my piece (uh!) 
 I own my chrome not rentin it 
 The police know I'm gettin' it 
 I roll 4 dough Infinity 
 So they pull me over tell me show identity 
 Continental drop roll like Kennedy 
 'Cept you can minus the assassination 
 I know cats be hatin' 
 I know that you waitin' 
 To catch me slippin' 
 While I'm tippin 
 Isn't that amazin 
 Cause you Can't drink gon be tough to find 
 Police tryin' take me down like I'm Busta Rhymes 
 We're tryn'a bust da rhymes 
 That's why they bustin' down the doors 
 In the club tellin' us to touch the ground (huh) 
 (Jae Millz) 
 I know the one time watchin me 
 Cause everywhere I go they followin 
 And they stoppin' me (Why?) 
 Cause they think I'm ridin' dirty 
 But you know I'm too smart for that 
 And as far as the tint what as dark as that 
 I got 'em midnight she be black on both sides 
 Probably over city size so our boys ride 
 I know they hate to see a young G ridin' 
 Pretty ass vehicle with a neck full of diamonds 
 But get too close and I'll blind 'em 
 I'll show the strip girls what Harlem like 
 When I'm at Harlem Nights bag the wildest Divas 
 Make 'em take me shopping in the Galleria 
 From H-town to H-town we ride out 
 Burn money, shine and pull 'em rides out 
 Hit the block post up and grind out 
 When you hit cops the only time you call a time out 
 It's your boy Jae Millz in here 
 I gotta keep it trill in here 
 'Specially when I'm on the remix ridin' dirty 
 With the homie Chamillionaire 
 Put it in the air! 
 (Papoose) 
 Papoose Papoose that's who pass you 
 Bad news that dude parked dead on the strip (uh) 
 Keep a hot hun ridin' shotgun 
 When I'm makin' my runs gettin' head in the whip (uh) 
 Blow my gun till the cops come 
 Keep it on cock son put lead in the clip 
 Came to a road block, man that's a bitch 
 I can make a u-turn, fled on 'em quick 
 Automatic, won't be caught dead with a stick 
 Put the pedal to the medal I'm wreckless with this one 
 On the I-95, hand full of piff 
 Got the wild eye's why 
 I'm takin' the risk 
 You sideline guys beggin' don't snitch 
 Hope the canine can't find the bread or the bricks 
 None of y'all rappers ain't F'in with this 
 Y'all movin' backwards like 7 to 6 (uh) 
 Wheels goin' and goin' 
 I stay smokin' and blowin' 
 I'm steady blowin' and blowin' that straight Buddha 
 Sip Crys like Chris brown, Christopher Wallace, 
 Chris Reeves, Christon and Luda 
 Keep the gat cocked stashed in the stash box 
 Locked up with padlocks I'm a straight shoota 
 A future billionaire runnin' with Chamillionaire 
 I'm outta here homie here come the state troopers 
 But tell 'em to try again
