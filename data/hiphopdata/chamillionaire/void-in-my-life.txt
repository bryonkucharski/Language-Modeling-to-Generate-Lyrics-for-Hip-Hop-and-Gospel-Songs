When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right 
 I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right 
 I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right 
 Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it 
 Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it 
 The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate 
 So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis 
 I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds 
 At 17, best believe they're a beautiful breeze 
 Of fresh air when their's nothing else, I usually need 
 Just a smile look at 'em now, hoping you just believe 
 And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar 
 Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter 
 But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her 
 The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella 
 Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse 
 While you healing a nigga feelings, your's are usually hurt 
 It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth 
 Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work 
 And you put in overtime, because you know the sign 
 And most danger that I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes 
 But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time 
 Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right 
 And that's speaken like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping 
 That comfortabally ain't enough for me, anything that you needing 
 I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks 
 Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep

 How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail 
 When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell 
 Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear 
 As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail 
 Argument after argument, drama wasn't hitting well 
 Target it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell 
 God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell 
 Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails 
 Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian 
 The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking 
 The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping 
 Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching 
 Yeah they gon have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust 
 Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up 
 Take too many things for granted, right after that metal gedal bust 
 Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it 
 Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish 
 Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted 
 Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite 
 And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my coaching divided 
 So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it 
 So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it 
 Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited 
 Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me 
 Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me 
 Into pieces as deadly was dealt, was not even fair to me 
 To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly 
 Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy 
 Staying humble's the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me 
 I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me 
 Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me 
 I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me 
 No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me 
 I live life so successfully, and just show 'em the best of me 
 On another level mentally, this position was meant for me
