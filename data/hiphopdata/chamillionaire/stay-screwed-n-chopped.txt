(Intro:) 
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 I've being doing this so looong 
 Why they stay talking dowwwn 
 Like stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up 
 And slow it down one more time 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Picture a world with no hater's mayne I can only imagine 
 All this success I'm grabbing 
 Hate they don't have what I'm havin 
 I heard a clown say he mad and felt like I left screw abandoned 
 And also said that the white boy that's on my left wasn't jammin 
 And where were you when slim thugga 
 Purchased his first set of davins 
 Where were you when the world was tellin us this couldn't happen 
 Now all the wood that I'm grabbing my caddy 
 Look like a cabin and yea I did it rapping 
 Reason you didn't is yapping 
 They thought that cleving and acrum was super easy we packed in 
 A bunch of cd's with wrapping it wasn't easy to track em 
 Looks super easy we stacking but wasn't't easy what happened 
 Is all the leechers attached and they started reaching n jacking 
 Ask me how many bootleggers we had to run up n handle 
 Ask me how many flute tellers we had ta come n dismantle 
 So when you see me out standing there like a boss in the flesh 
 You ain't got to get on your knees but just know that you have blessed, I feel like 
 (Chorus:) 
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 I've being doing this so loong 
 And boys stay talking downnnn 
 Like stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up 
 And slow it down one more time 
 (Verse 2:) 
 Uh, what you mean 
 I already did my thing 
 I forever be the king 
 Just like the name on that black women in swimsuit magazine 
 Stay hopping out of my porsche puttin these boys under my wing 
 I taught you how to be safer when the industry tried to break ya, showed ya to watch out for fakers 
 And taught you how not to date her 
 I got it from master p and j. prince, d-rek, tony draper 
 Then I used it just to get paper 
 Then sit court side for the lakers 
 What the hell is ya'll saying 
 I got a ring that say kiss me 
 Only a loser would diss me 
 Like he ain't being watching history 
 I held it down for h the banner first said missippipi 
 And held it down for you losers 
 When they was in chucks and dickies 
 Rapping backwards on rap city 
 Yea that was all in the past 
 But I don't see noone right now that's bad enough to take all this cash that's right in my path 
 New artist yea they might tell ya you gifted 
 But you better not get this game twisted cause that will get you evicted get out cause 
 (Chorus) 
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 I've being doing this so loong 
 And boys stay talking downnnn 
 Like stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Stay screwed n' chopped up 
 Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up 
 And slow it down one more time 
 Ahhhhhh one more timmmmee 
 Hmmmmmm like stay screwed n chopped up 
 Stay screwed n chopped up 
 Mayne stay screwed n chopped up, chopped up 
 And slow it down one more time
