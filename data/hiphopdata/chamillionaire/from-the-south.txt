Koopa, ain't no lyin' or fiction up in me please, 
 I don't exaturate the price it was 15 G's. 
 When they ask about the color diamonds in DP's, 
 Yeah I'm one of the richest niggas in these streets. 
 I'm a candy flipper, 
 You can have a picture. 
 While I pose like a playa you can have ya candy wit ya 
 Koopa never have no time for penny pinchas 
 My nigga how come you ain't take it to Miami wit ya? 
 There's a couple haters that wont let me be, 
 I feel like yellin' at the radio like spc. 
 The movie room in my crib got an empty seat, 
 I'm wit Sway gettin' interviewed by MTV 
 Yeah I'm ill at rappin', 
 But I'm still not captain. 
 Ain't took the damn drug 
 And he still ain't trappin' 
 I don't change no sleep 'cause Chamill ain't nappin' 
 Stop actin' like platinum when it can't happen. 
 I'm a north side rider, ain't got to worry, 
 'Cause a major deal is not about to turn me, 
 And the controversy ain't about to hurt me. 
 I don't play no games like I forgot my jersey. 
 Still ride around the city wit none of my niggas wit me, 
 Still ride for H-Town if don't none of these niggas feel me, 
 Ya ain't gotta like me, I have none of these niggas hear me, 
 I'm a be the MVP if don't none of these niggas pick me 
 Alot of rumors in the street, 
 Ain't none of it really pretty, 
 Gettin' all this money makes all the drama seem itty-bitty. 
 Pick a click, 
 I don't hang none of these niggas really 
 But I'm glad 'cause the matrix runnin' up in the city 'cause...
