 I'm in the zone, let's go! 
 I don't mean to brag 
 But my cash long 
 Yeah I feel like I'm worth a million bucks 
 Yeah, I'm countin' 100's 
 Yeah-ah-ah 
 Got that corporate Swag 
 And my cash long 
 But in the streets I could make a million bucks 
 Yeah, show me the money 
 Yeah-ah-ah 
 You be local 
 Imma be in London. No lauren 
 They claim to do it for the block 'cause they the ones not tourin 
 Ain't believin in these streets rappers claim to be on 
 They really in front of ning like Alonzo Mourning (Internet) 
 At the rucca with the blucca 'cause the worth of my charm 
 Street baller, ain't no need to even work on my form 
 King of the underground feel like the mixtape Bun 
 Label don't even want to move until my mixtapes done 
 Bad Breezy in the A then do whatever I want 
 And she say that's right, ok, and yeah like she Lil' John 
 Sleepin' over in the dorm with your chick is a norm' 
 In the jacuzzi with my Black Berry on like I'm Ron 
 Look into my iPhone if a bad chick what you want 
 Height Williams sneak a peak, and big pimpin' was born 
 Swag deposit in my closet, take whatever you want 
 So many horses that my stylist call me Polow da Don 
 I be workin until dawn, ladies say I ain't fun 
 I ain't down with that complainin so right now you been warned 
 X'd out of my black booklet you don't wanna be one 
 So many X's they addresses lookin' like it's some porn 
 And that's just my x-man but she still on my arm 
 I send her to Magic City you gon' think that she storm 
 She turn over in the morn', she can bet I'll be gone 
 Shoulda known that dot com, be a member and join 
 'Cause when she hop up out the bed, Imma be gone 
 On my grind before you even wake up 
 Yeah, I know you love me 
 Yeah-ah-ah 
 I don't like no competition so I guess that I'm greedy 
 I walk in Michael Jordan's kitchen and walk out with his Wheaties 
 So much jewelry that my closet lookin' frosted as Jeezy 
 Closet freezy, lookin' like that big commercial on TV 
 Rollin' wit a chick magnet I call Arab money 
 Could wake up in your momma's bed like I'm your stepdad, dummy 
 I'm too sick another's nostrils ain't gon' get that runny 
 Pimpin' Kenneth and Hugh Hefner, I could pimp that bunny 
 Chamilli is the truth, puke is what I induce 
 I'm so sick that if I spit it look like Cranberry Juice 
 Look who's touching on the head, you could say that she loose 
 I lean backwards while your chick is playing duck, duck, goose 
 These rappers can't see me just call me the hidden truth 
 And I'm probably about to wreck it unless there's a hidden booth 
 All these rappers is fruity but don't ask me for proof 
 They so sweet, I can't name them without chippin' a tooth 
 Not in my Fave 5, not part of my business group 
 So when your chick get in the coup, she's part of my chicken coop 
 You don't know who always kill it, you need to be introduced 
 And you need to just keep one eye on me like Zeus 
 'Cause really 
 I don't mean to brag 
 But my cash long 
 Yeah I feel like I'm worth a million bucks 
 Yeah, I'm countin' 100's 
 Yeah-ah-ah 
 Got that corporate Swag 
 And my cash long 
 But in the streets I could make a million bucks 
 Yeah, show me the money 
 Yeah-ah-ah
