 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne) 
 How come 
 Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go) 
 They look at me like a criminal 
 But I'm a CEO, I'm a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO) 
 I'm not a criminal 
 Let them stay local while I'm about to hit Japan 
 The G4 get me out when I get in a jam 
 You gotta go internatonal to get with cham 
 Women on your phone I bet you switchin up yo plan 
 Let them other rappers beef while they arguein 
 Will be runnin' in with the bags to get the all the grams 
 Take it out yo hands (take it out yo hands) 
 Money talks, only language that I understand 
 I heard that puff 'n' jay were worth over 300 mill 
 That means that this year I gotta put it in 300 gear 
 You wanna treadmill homie 
 You just runnin' still 
 Yes this is the rap that all the other rappers love to feel 
 I got the plaque but now I'm back for the reload 
 We know while imma still stick to the street code 
 Tell me what the industry is lookin' at me for 
 'Cause here ya sold platinum they didn't think it would be gold 
 Now they try to tell me that there will never be mo' 
 But these flows sure to be a ***** to yo ego 
 Ya I'm from the south they try to tell me that we slow 
 But its ironic that your tryin' to keep up with me tho 
 Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go) 
 They look at me like a criminal 
 But I'm a CEO, I'm a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO) 
 I already got dough, I already got dough (but I think its time for me to get mo') 
 I'm a CEO, I'm a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO) 
 I'm not a criminal 
 Call up Universal 'n' tell them open up the vault 
 N tell them I just had another million dollar thought 
 Albums do not sell they tell me we not in a drought 
 How bought I run in these labels for the **** n break 'em off 
 Imma boss yeah yeah 
 My money is unlimited 
 Sorta like my motorola minutes is 
 Koopa bout to tell you what the business is 
 Rap with this rapper major label on I gettin' rich 
 Whatcha mean the label didn't promote 
 I put a million on a million do it till I go broke 
 Might have to run for president so give me yo vote 
 'Cause Bin Laden wouldn't be the only one in the scope 
 Get a rope 'n' duck tape there's bout to be a crime 
 Simplify yo songs I ain't simplifyin mine 
 The industry done got in the streets that's why rappers dyin' 
 Don't get it confused imma still show you how to grind 
 They tell me if I write a lullaby for the females 
 That these sales are sure to skyrocket in retail 
 Hope you got a backup plan if yo CD fails 
 I'll drown 'em like seashells 
 Till they hit these shells 
 Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go) 
 They look at me like a criminal 
 But I'm a CEO, I'm a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO) 
 I already got dough, I already got dough (but I think its time for me to get mo') 
 I'm a CEO, I'm a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO) 
 I'm not a criminal 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne) 
 How come 
 Ultimate Victory 
 I'm back for the reload 
 But we know imma still stick to the street code 
 Look at sumtin pretty in the middle of the road 
 Bouncin' on rims like a brick at a free throw 
 I told 'em tomorrow imma be on BET 
 Look at all the free clothin that they came 'n' gave to me 
 I told 'em tomorrow imma be on MTV 
 Look at all the jewelry my jeweler gave to me fo free 
 I'm winnin' so keep the hatin' to a minimal 
 Y'all need to give applause to the general 
 I'm hearin how y'all talk in yo interviews 
 Y'all really all just be talkin' like a interlude 
 Poppin' at the mouth 
 While I'm poppin' tags 
 50 thousand in my pocket pants gotta sag 
 Magazine critics always talkin' like they bad 
 But in the streets tryna hide behind a pen 'n' pad 
 But its ok 
 I know why you gettin' mad 
 I gotta lot of whatever yu neva had 
 Got a betta pad 
 Got a betta slab 
 We gonna keep it movin try ya best to get a cab 
 Remember you wer jammin master p 
 Now that houstons super how you try 'n' ask for me 
 They be askin for a verse don't even ask the fee 
 Tellin' me how many bars to spit like that's for free (EHHH) 
 Try again 
 Sorry betta luck next time 
 Unless imma sleep the only time is lets grind 
 Y'all need to stop like the words on the red sign 
 Unless I'm pointin sumtin tellin' ya get down 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low) 
 Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne)
