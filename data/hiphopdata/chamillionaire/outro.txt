Hey 
 They said no when I told them that 
 I find a way to get to the top 
 They didn't know that eventually I'd be the to worry about 
 When someone would mention me they always try to say I'm a flop 
 But this The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 Revenge. 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Yeah, on the path to find out who's true 
 The only person you can really trust is you 
 And if you feel like you can't even trust you 
 You can always trust you know who 
 And if you don't know who you know who is 
 Then I feel so sorry for you 
 'Cause that's really the only person that can judge and critics people that wanna see you fail 
 And tell you what you can do, shouldn't do, must do 
 And when you got that glow 
 Nobody's else words can really bugs you. 
 (Laugh) 
 Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin 
 And sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win 
 Sometimes it sound like... [gun shot:] It's what it could've been 
 And when you get to the gates of heaven they probably wouldn't let you in. 
 (Laugh) 
 But to change that meanin' of it success is what it is in the end 
 And instead of worryin' about what it should've could've or would it been 
 You turn you head towards the future and keep it movin'. You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Well say it again. 
 Keep it movin'. You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Screw it then. 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 If you waitin' for me to fail 
 Your time is runnin' out on the glock 
 I'm runnin' to the finish, yeah 
 When I get there I ain't gonna stop 
 Success is what I couldn't have 
 But now I tell them look what I got 
 This The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 The Sound Of Revenge 
 Revenge. 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 The Sound Of Revenge. [gunshots:]
