(Talking) 
 That's what it is, "The Sound of Revenge" 
 Summer 2005 nigga, whoooooo 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever 
 But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together 
 Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her 
 She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella 
 The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather 
 Sending gimmick niggaz to the mall, to go buy umbrellas 
 Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella 
 Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better 
 Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap 
 I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap 
 Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact 
 Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back 
 The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em 
 You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em 
 After the baptism, the black in the black hit em 
 No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em 
 Live your life like a mockery, niggaz will see the prophecy 
 Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me 
 Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me 
 Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me 
 Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty 
 Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me 
 Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see 
 I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently 
 Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston 
 The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion 
 What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion 
 You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga 
 (*Talking*) 
 I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old 
 Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material 
 On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up 
 Summer 2005, "The Sound of Revenge" 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo' 
 But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo 
 Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo 
 Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo 
 Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggaz'll never vanish 
 We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic 
 Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it 
 Rip off your chest piece, to make niggaz remember Janet 
 Ay log on the net, type in "the villain" and search 
 And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts 
 And you jerks (you jerks), is a package of skirts 
 Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha 
 That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey 
 Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me 
 You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me 
 And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me 
 I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns 
 I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs 
 I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn 
 Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn 
 So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is 
 The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid 
 DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid 
 Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid 
 What's his name, Chamillitary mayn 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ 
 Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga 
 Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn
