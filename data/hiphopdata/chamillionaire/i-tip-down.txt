(Rasaq) 
 I tip down, grippin' on pine 
 Sour apple caddie wine berry overline 
 Paint on shine, reclined on swine 
 Slab in slow-mo, but my rims on rewind 
 The block won't mind, trunk blow from behind 
 Open up the fist see the glow and design, man 
 So throw'd you can hate em', rose gold in the rotation 
 Shoulder blade and dislocation, when I'm swangin' bones is achin' 
 Boys wanna hate me but I don't borrow 
 Prolly 'cause my diamonds shinin' on they darling 
 24's crawlin', ya boy is ballin' 
 5th wheel wiggle like the fin on a dolphin 
 Sittin' on diss but the words out my lips 
 I go hard in the paint, I can make the beat skip 
 I go fed off the head, stack my bread 
 Never scared threaten me get infra-red and I throw lead 
 I'm that boy mayne, I'm in that toy mayne 
 Flip-flop paint when I slide watch that toy change 
 Stay on my grind, stay on the pine 
 That's why my gold's shine and you blind all the time 
 I be comin' down, all my girls fine 
 They call me M&M's I got red, yella's and browns, man... 
 I be comin' down, I be tippin' down 
 (Hook: Chamillionaire) 
 You can tell I'm tippin' down 
 Rims spinnin' in rewind 
 Top is up I let it down 
 From that H-Town to yo town, we tippin' down 
 You can tell I'm tippin' down 
 How my trunk is showin' surround 
 Ask them how they like me now 
 From that H-Town to yo town, we tippin' down 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 I tip down, bangin' underground 
 Clear coats on shine 
 Prisma drippin' off like slime 
 I tip down, at Action number 9 
 Tell the diamonds drip down 
 From my spine to the ground 
 When are you gon' sign 
 Stop worryin' bout mine 
 Put ya mouth to use and give my spinners a spit-shine 
 If y'all don't mind, please don't talk down 
 Put the 9 to your mind and blow ya mind outta ya mind, man 
 Niggaz gon' hate but they can't wait 
 Some claimin' they real really they fake 
 And ride in the slab spent a day shakin' 
 Speakers keep breakin' the playstation 
 It's Akeem, also known as the King 
 Zeem-Zeem sour beam my screens pop up on the scene 
 Well what are you watchin'?, tell the truth it don't matter 
 Shout out to J-Mack, Mella Mac and the Mad Hatter 
 Spreewell's standin' on the ladder 
 Squash the cheddar ain't on my level 
 The plex can't get settled 
 Pop the trunk and I get metal 
 You can leave Jamaica 
 Make a run move and I break ya 
 One-Two, breaker, breaker 
 My plane fleein' to Jamaica 
 Break ya neck I'ma day shaker 
 No luck I play with skills 
 After playin' skills after the game I'm payin' bills 
 Midwest say I'm real, the South say I'm trill 
 Step out the Cheville still holdin' my woodwheel 
 Stop at IHOP ain't never gon' pay the bill 
 Carrots in my mouth I'm already havin' a good meal 
 Northside fa'real, mm man, hold up man 
 Ro, Twin where y'all at, y'all gotta tip down with me man
