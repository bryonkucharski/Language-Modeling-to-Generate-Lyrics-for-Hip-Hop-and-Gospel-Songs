Diamond in the back with the sun roof open 
 Drivin' Down The Freeway 
 Eyes real low just singing my song 
 Drivin' Down The Freeway 
 Life already bad so I'm moving along, yeah 
 Drivin' Down The Freeway 
 Blowin' my smoke all by myself, just 
 Drivin' Down The Freeway 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Koopa 
 She said that she ain't never been in an old school car in her life 
 And you will never, not with me cause you are not my type 
 That Houston breathes be feeling nice, I had to drop top twice 
 Showin roof because they couldn't afford the top drop price 
 Marvin Gaye is gonna play 'cause what it do to the soul 
 The music probably goin' be chopped cause Watt's done screw it to slow 
 I love to see the sun come out, 'cause what it do to the 4's 
 And it's ready to bring the Lincoln out 'cause it's too new for the road 
 Key to the city with me with me as I cruise to the toe 
 And the handles never show not including with doe 
 And I swear the air up there is so populated with snow 
 A condition blowing code I'm bout to shoot 'em the stove 
 Complaining, saying I don't be in the hood chillin' with them 
 But when I pop up with the top they like "What's up, Cham? " 
 He said "let me hold something" so I took my hand out 
 And then I pulled it out and he like "stuck up man" 
 Chunk the deuce to all the haters, pictured us as a fluke 
 Haters better get on ya job like you was hired to do 
 Never open up your mouth and say that I ain't the truth 
 Cause you goin' blow it like a fluke got stuck inside in your tooth 
 Ford chicks they love a Ford crosser I ain't traduce 
 Both of them they Europeans, get inside of the coupe 
 If you goin' race me then I think you should be tying ya shoes 
 You hear that engine start roaring like a lion is loose 
 That's Right
