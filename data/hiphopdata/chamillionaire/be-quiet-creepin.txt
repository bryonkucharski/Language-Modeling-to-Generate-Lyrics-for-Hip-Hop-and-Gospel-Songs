Creepin' (solo) Chamillionaire f/t Ludacris 
 In the streets I'm peepin game 
 I can't trust you, no no 
 All up in my biness mayne 
 I stay on the low low 
 Say they really really fake 
 Can't mess wit you no mo' 
 Closest people to you hate 
 So I be rollin' solo

 Mo' money yeah mo' problems 
 What biggy said it look like it true 
 Used to be my homeboy 
 But now I'm paid so they tryna sue 
 My garage got jaguars 
 My garage look like a zoo 
 Middle finger up for the haters 
 Hope the hater here isn't you 
 Super cool, that's real cool 
 You can feel like you gotta friend 
 But I ain't trusing my money counter 
 And that's the reason I count again 
 You saw the forbes (yeah) 
 I'm suspicious 
 Thinking everybody wanna take my riches 
 Can't take my money out my account 
 'Cause my bank teller get motion sickness 
 Back and forth, b-back and forth 
 From in the streets or right back in court 
 Candy car built like a tank 
 And my crib built like a fort 
 Lets go to war 
 I ain't George bush 
 I promise y'all I'm gon be prepared 
 'Cause I ain't trusting my weapon either 
 And that's the reason I keep a spare 
 In the streets I'm peepin game 
 I can't trust you, no no 
 All up in my biness mayne 
 I stay on the low low 
 Say they really really fake 
 Can't mess wit you no mo' 
 Closest people to you hate 
 So I be rollin' solo

 I ain't hangin' with none of y'all 
 Outcast like ???? 
 Win the grammy thing 
 Guard the family 
 And all of you gon leave out 
 If you don't like it then peace out 
 Look around and I see doubt 
 I been known to get to the presidents 
 Like barack is on speed dial 
 Yeah it's all about me now 
 Don't want ya and don't need ya 
 You don't grind and get to the money 
 And you ain't hungry I won't feed ya 
 I ain't hangin' with no hater 
 No faker 
 No diva 
 I knew it big and they say they did 
 And tryna take my credit like stole visa 
 If its lonely at the top (top) 
 Id rather be alone 
 'Cause the closest people to ya 
 The ones who guna do ya wrong 
 Backstabbing me for a broad 
 I promise that I will lose no sleep 
 'Cause jenny crank can be your freak 
 But my bank account gon stay obese 
 In the streets I'm peepin game 
 I can't trust you, no no 
 All up in my biness mayne 
 I stay on the low low 
 Say they really really fake 
 Can't mess wit you no mo' 
 Closest people to you hate 
 So I be rollin' solo 
 I'm creepin' on the low low

 (Ludacris) 
 I be, creeping lower than low 
 Light another blunt I'm smoking the dro 
 Choking, loking, never provoke him 
 And a drunk will get popped and ill open the do 
 Lungs full of smoke 
 That means slower than slow 
 Feel like I'm trapped and there's nowhere to go 
 So i, just pull out the bazooka (blah) 
 Put a fuckin' hole in the flo 
 Luda! I'm so dope wid the flow 
 Trunk fulla speakers, pocket fulla ???? 
 How much would a wood chuck chuck 
 If a wood chuck could chuck wood 
 Gripping on the wheel 
 Turn it turn it 
 Blow another stack 
 I earned it earned it 
 Blow another ??? 
 Pull another tram 
 Light another blunt 
 Burn it burn it 
 Flame it up 
 Hear my flow, I changed it up 
 Everybody grab your gats 
 And hold em, load, sock em, lock em, cock em 
 And aim it up 
 Bang it up 
 Off in the sky 
 Catch me rollin' off in the ride 
 26 inches 
 Leave 'em defenceless 
 45 always tucked in the side 
 Open your eyes 
 See me cruisin 
 'Cause I keep winning and these boys keep losing 
 Plus I'm, the pimp of the year 
 Playas is hatin' and hos is choosing 
 Look at all the hos you losing 
 Then look at all the game I got 
 And you can catch me creepin' on the low low 
 Luda ridin' solo, beatin' the block! 
 In the streets I'm peepin game 
 I can't trust you, no no 
 All up in my biness mayne

 Say they really really fake 
 Can't mess wit you no mo 
 Closest people to you hate 
 So I be rollin' solo
