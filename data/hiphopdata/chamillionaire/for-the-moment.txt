(Hook) 
 I turned on her favorite song 
 I knew that would turn you on 
 Now she sayin she gon do what I want 
 She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin' 
 She took two shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn 
 Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn 
 But this the type of love that just last for the moment... 
 (Verse 1) 
 She be super freaky everytime she see the cash come out 
 Had to stash the gat 
 Every vehicle gon have a spot 
 Twenty sixes got me floatin like a astronaut 
 Lookin at my watch I don't want the hand to pass the dot 
 Money got to be the only thing I'm runnin by 
 Chasin at a lot but I'm fast so I ain't runnin out 
 Picture perfect girl it's time two get yo camera out 
 You can see the D in HD like the magnavox, baby doll 
 Swear to y'all that I got sexy tho 
 If I pull a stack and it don't turn you on jus lemme kno 
 Lemme know while I turn the deck to numba four 
 Couple numbers mo you gon be ready go 
 My destiny is to keep two chicks next to me like Kelly 
 I mean that chick from H-Town that had that head with Nelly 
 Candy paint slick as the new bottle of KY Jelly 
 I'm lookin for another jam that I can play like Felly 
 It seems like your ready to figure out a maneuver 
 It seems like I'm ready to figure out somethin newer 
 I betcha you love how I do ya I show her plus I'm approve her 
 I'm tryna do somethin to do her like I don't need no approval 
 You a hot girl if not girl don't be touchin my gwock girl 
 Every female squirrel tryna get a nutt in my world 
 And this is my world so sit back and relax 
 And let the four fifteens soothe yo back back bm such a mack 
 (Hook) 
 I turned on her favorite song

 Now she sayin she gon do what I want 
 She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin' 
 She took two shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn 
 Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn 
 But this the type of love that just last for the moment... 
 (Verse 2) 
 She checkin out my whip, she checkin in the W 
 Checkin out a flick and she jammin that because of you 
 Checkin to see if our man thats gona get you in trouble whoo 
 I show you some love but I love if you cumber too 
 Cumber too when you know yo boy got cha 
 Parmesean pasta pourin on hot stuff 
 Tellin me how his D game trash like oscar 
 Knowin that my D gona put her to sleep like boxer 
 Sugar ray hook a lay right below yo belt 
 M&M's is known to melt you cant even control yourself 
 Lookin round grabbin pillows reachin for some help 
 I could never lay my D down it's gon break the scale 
 Yeah playboy bunny got me energized 
 Energized I ain't gona need many tries 
 But I bet you gon reach the clouds many times 
 Climax then I go back to gettin money right..... 
 (Final hook) 
 I turned on her favorite song 
 I knew that would turn you on 
 Now she sayin she gon do what I want 
 She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin' 
 She took two shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnn 
 Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn 
 Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn 
 But this the type of love that just last for the moment...
