(Yung L.A. - Ain't I mix) 
 (Hook:) 
 Ain't I (x6) 
 You know I is 
 Ain't I off the chain 
 Ain't I such a pain 
 Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I known for spitting flames 
 Ain't I (x6) 
 You know my name 
 Ain't I getting change 
 Ain't I on them swangs 
 Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Throwdest In The Game 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Let's Go 
 Ay 
 I move a million tapes before my label even ship me 
 That's the reason that my donuts like a box of chip-lees 
 I wish I wish an idiot act up and try to diss me 
 Like that you ? class I used to pay you goin be history 
 When I leave rap, I know the rap world is gonna miss me 
 I heard a little busta wanna sue me youse a sissy 
 They say that it ain't tricking if you got it, but that's tricky 
 I think the person that made up that slogan try'na trick me 
 The game cost a fee and I can't say that I'm affordable 
 If she out of town then my pimpin game is portable 
 Got some haters on the sac, the plan was just ignoring you 
 But now you starting to be a pest, I gotta call a auto-bull

 (Verse 2:) 
 Yeah your shirt is ro-ho, you ain't a blood boy you fake 
 Put my knuckles on your face, so that in your shirt can cordonate 
 I'm already legendary y'all know that I'm more than great 
 Way before I got revenge you just saw it sorta late 
 Windows in my living room, toss it they just gonna say 
 They don't have enough fabric, I didn't even order drapes 
 Mixtape God you can hear the scriptures on my tapes 
 Got chicks in Atlanta offering me money more than Mase 
 Do whatever that I tell em never insupportate 
 Girl you looking super fine I know you gotta gorgoeus face 
 Tape some money to ya head and you da chick I'm gonna date 
 But soon as ya fall asleep and you know what I'm gonna take 
 Get Money
