I'm like the baddest rapper ever 
 Ever ever? Ever! 
 I always been it like I stood next to Uncle Fester 
 Swisher house professor taught y'all how to be successful 
 Used to Run a house like Rev and Diggy and Vanessa 
 Yes I got a stretcher that's for competition 
 Not in my position they ain't got a pot to piss in 
 You can call it dissin' they stay broke like it's tradition 
 Fly over the hood (man you must think you) Blake Griffin 
 Finger itching I got riching 
 My mother say she loving it 
 She took a million it took a year till I discovered it 
 I took my money out and I almost shut down the government 
 I threw it in the tub and let my main chick rubber dubbing it 
 The passcode on my bank account is Catch Me If You Can 
 I know they gay just undercover like they with the clan 
 Don't throw a rock and later say that you my biggest fan 
 Remove the mic right now so it don't break and beat you with this stand 
 Your girl be calling me like every time she grab a phone 
 I never hear 'em all her messages be rather long 
 These losers copying too much and you can't say I'm wrong 
 Wiz Khalifa hit the joint, now everybody cheech ching chong 
 A sign that's on my door that say no man but me allowed 
 Might see your woman drying off in here without a towel 
 Don't get confused just cause the twitter picture got a smile 
 ... Post where you at and I'll come show up now 
 After I beat you down, twitpic and retweet this clown 
 I bet in person all these talkers ain't gon' leak a sound 
 I travel everywhere how come your boys don't be around 
 Take trips where y'all be missing y'all must live in lost and found 
 Rap game's a female chat and all y'all do is disrespectful her 
 Can't really say you fresh cause all of y'all is whack except for 
 A few it's maybe two yeah most of y'all is pop as Ke$ha 
 I wanna grab a bottle and just turn your tap to ketchup 
 I teach 'em how to stunt, super Dave done taught a lecture 
 See me 2012 and said you fresh as when I met ya 
 I'm in my robe and slippers walking round like I'm Hugh Heffner 
 I'm dressed in red your girl is black, jump on her like a checker 
 King me
