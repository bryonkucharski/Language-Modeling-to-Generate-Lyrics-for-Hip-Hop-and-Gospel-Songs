Show a big tyma love 
 When you see me riddin' dubs 
 Platinum chain diamond up but 
 Please don't stare at us! 
 What it do I see you peepin' me I'm peepin' you 
 Find a better thang to do and 
 Please don't't stare at us! 
 Sittin' crooked on tha chrome 
 Wit a throwed yellowbone 
 I'm wit her and you alone 
 Please don't stare at us! 
 Ice tray on my teeth 
 Deep freeze around my neck 
 Betta getcha mind correct and 
 Please don't stare at us 
 When it comes to ridin' chrome, we some veteran pros 
 Matter fact I'm livin' larger than David Letterman's nose 
 Don't play stupid and act like I never said it before 
 I'd rather chase a set of them voge's Instead of them hoes 
 Whoa kimosabi find me in a denali 
 Or hoppin out the impali if I'm sweatin' it's probably 
 Not the damn sun it's this heater strapped to my body 
 Whoa kimosabi think I'm bluffin then try me 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall I'm watchin all of y'all 
 So I can see who's plottin on me when my twankies crawl 
 While you starin' at us dawg that boy Lew Hawk is not 
 The type to let some drama pop and just sit back and watch 
 Niggas just sit back and watch while we sit back in drops 
 Haters see mo red dots than a kid wit chicken pox 
 If you want it, it's whatever you haters need to go get a 
 Life we cheddas getters for 2k1 and forever! whoa kimosabi 
 Getcha done brain corrected when you see a color changin 
 Necklace you betta respect it 
 Uh
