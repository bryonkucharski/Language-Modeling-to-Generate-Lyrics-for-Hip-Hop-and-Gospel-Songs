Chamilitarymayne 
 Know I had to do it 
 Mixtape Messiah 5 
 That's right 
 Somebody need to give me a solid definition of what swag is 
 Is that when your bank account get built up so high that everybody come out trying to sue you so they can get their piece of the pie 
 Is that swag huh? 
 Or maybe it's when the major label call you and ask you when your next mixtape dropping because they know you gonna have the streets on smash 
 Is that swag? 
 Or maybe it's just a whole bunch of punch lines bragging how you ball with no purpose at all 
 You already know I can do that... I can do that 
 Chamillii! 
 Uh uh uh 
 Let me start like this try to put on skinny jeans and couldn't zip my zip 
 Nah let me be blunt real quick I don't wear skinny jeans cause my dick don't fit 
 Always keep a maggy close to me like lisa you know they keep a lot of cheese on me like pizza 
 I came y'all back was like mika y'all better keep ya eyes on me like features 
 Never be mislead, I don't care what any side-switching fickle fan said 
 Yeah still street like greg hit you with a speaker they gonna call you bass head 
 Bought a motorcycle 'cause I'm normally one deep crocodile on the seats you can call it Dundee 
 Kickers in the trunk tryna do the chung lee yup yup try to bit the wallet do the gumbee 
 Stretching my cream stretching stretching my cream cash rules everything I'm the meth of my scene 
 Come to Texas we can bet that I'm king I'm the best in real life and nothing less in my dreams 
 Cars got the screens that they have at homes cribs got the same size pillars that they had in Rome 
 Traveled way to Rome just to grab a phone I ain't even turn it on... ha 
 Paris Hilton got a man named benji and she love him I'm in Paris with the benjis maannn and we hustlinn 
 Meanwhile I'm in customs chains so big we lookin' like we munchkins 
 Ask yo bank teller 
 Bet she know a player 
 Money ova here 
 You way over there 
 You got swag? Tell me why I'm supposed to care M.O.E. is me you more like money over whereee? 
 She said she independent like she signed a cotch I told her time is money so she grab my watch 
 Got stocks, got rocks, got glocks remy isn't dusty 'cause I still ain't take it out the box 
 I keep a big whip like Indiana Jones and big size rims without my have it on 
 I be terrorizing every jamming song, y'all on T-Pain dick leave that man alone 
 Act like you don't know me, I mean the new me, forget the old me 
 I dip a bullet in syrup and you can O D on chopped and screwed bullets competition die slowly 
 I'm like the man named Pac, on a whole other level plus I'm eating that's fact 
 Matter fact you can take swag back, that's the word rapper's saying when they know they can't rap 
 But your confidence higher than the stewardess, just wanna laugh when I ask you who ya jeweler is 
 H - A - M - M - O so humorous bank getting paid don't believe me you can Google this 
 Got a major deal when the Boston green diamonds why you waste yo skrill 
 I buy green diamond it's a baseball field nothing little league about me I got major bills 
 Money like mutumbo, tall like this, money got a mumble and it talk like this 
 If money talks baby pardon my lips, Ben Franklin always with me like he part of my click 
 And I don't be in the strip club every night, but I tell her keep the tax like you Wesley Snipes 
 Even the white girls tryin' to get the pipe all the bullets last like a nestle bite 
 The industry ain't something that I feel is fair, don't care you well-rounded you just filled with squares 
 So I don't care unless there's 'bout a million shares standing on the million lookin' up like it's a billion where? 
 And I am so sincere, I'm the baddest rapper here let's just get this clear 
 And I wish I made you would kick me out my dear 'cause I been the richest independent you should fear 
 No one on the corner moves mixtapes like me but I won't tell you how many incriminate thee 
 M - I - X - T - A - P - E street money make me sound like Lil' Boosie 
 Can't get no money because he don't move no birds, can't get no money because he don't usually curse 
 Mixtape Messiah 5 baby you deserve some alphabet soup so you can eat your words
