Ft. ludacris 
 (chorus) 
 In the streets i'm peepin game 
 I can't trust you, no no 
 All up in my business mayne 
 I stay on the low low 
 Say they really really fake 
 Can't mess wit you no mo' 
 Closest people to you hate 
 So i be rollin solo 
 I'm creepin on the low low 
 Creepin on the low low 
 Creepin on the low low 
 I be rollin, i be rollin solo 
 I'm creepin on the low 
 Creepin on the low low 
 Creepin on the low low 
 I be rollin, i be rollin solo 
 I'm creepin on the low 
 Verse 1: (chamillionaire) 
 Mo' money yeah mo' problems 
 What biggy said it look like it true 
 Used to be my homeboy 
 But now i'm paid so they tryna sue 
 My garage got jaguars 
 My garage look like a zoo 
 Middle finger up for the haters 
 Hope the hater here isn't you 
 Super cool, that's real cool 
 You can feel like you gotta friend 
 But i aint trusing my money counter 
 And that's the reason i count again 
 You saw the forbes (yeah) 
 I'm suspicious 
 Thinking everybody wanna take my riches 
 Can't take my money out my account 
 Cause my bank teller get motion sickness 
 Back and forth, b-back and forth 
 From in the streets or right back in court 
 Candy car built like a tank 
 And my crib built like a fort 
 Lets go to war 
 I aint george bush 
 I promise ya'll i'm gone be prepared 
 Cause i aint trusting my weapon either 
 And that's the reason i keep a spare 
 (chorus) 
 Verse 2: (chamillionaire) 
 I aint hangin with none of ya'll 
 Outkast like 3 thou' 
 Win the grammy thank 
 God and family 
 And all of ya'll i'm gone leave out 
 If you don't like it then peace out 
 Look around and i see doubt 
 I've been known to get to the presidents 
 Like barack was on speed dial 
 Yeah it's all about me now 
 Don't want ya and don't need ya 
 You don't grind and get to the money 
 And you aint hungry i wont feed ya 
 I aint hangin with no hater 
 No faker 
 No diva 
 I made it big and they say they did 
 And tryna take my credit like stole visa 
 If it's lonely at the top (top) 
 I'd rather be alone 
 Cause the closest people to ya 
 The ones who gonna do ya wrong 
 Backstabbing me for a broad 
 I promise that i will lose no sleep 
 Cause jenny craig can be your freak 
 But my bank account gone stay obese 
 (chorus) 
 Verse 3: (ludacris) 
 I be, creeping lower than low 
 Light another blunt i'm smoking the dro 
 Choking, loking, never provoke him 
 And the trunk will get popped and i'll open the do' 
 Lungs full of smoke 
 Got me slower than slow 
 Feel like i'm trapped and there's nowhere to go 
 So i, just pull out the bazooka (blah) 
 Put a xxxxxx hole in the flo 
 (luda! ) 
 I'm so dope with the flow 
 Trunk full of speakers, pocket full of bud 
 How much would a wood chuck chuck 
 If a wood chuck could chuck wood grain 
 Gripping on the wheel 
 Turn it turn it 
 Blow another stack 
 I earned it earned it 
 Blow another amp 
 Pull another tram 
 Light another blunt 
 Burn it burn it 
 Flame it up 
 Hear my flow, i changed it up 
 Everybody grab your gats 
 And hold em, load, sock em, lock em, xxxx em 
 And aim it up 
 Bang it up 
 Off in the sky 
 Catch me rollin off in the ride 
 26 inches 
 Leave em defenseless 
 45 always tucked in the side 
 Open your eyes 
 See me cruisin 
 Cause i keep winning and these boys keep losing 
 Plus i'm, the pimp of the year 
 Playas is hatin and ho's is choosing 
 Look at all the ho's you losing 
 Then look at all the game i got 
 And you can catch me creepin on the low low 
 Luda ridin solo, beatin the block! 
 (chorus)
