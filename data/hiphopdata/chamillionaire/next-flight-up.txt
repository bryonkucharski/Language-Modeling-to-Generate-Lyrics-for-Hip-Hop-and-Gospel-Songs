(Chorus:) 
 If we ever come back down we gon catch the next flight up 
 If we ever come back down we gon catch the next flight up 
 If we ever come back down we gon catch the next flight up 
 If we ever come back down but we'll never come down 
 (Verse:) 
 Alright I'm headed back to brazil to show em how to stay paid 
 Money never funny so no need to add a h a 
 Never call me h a keem ya know ya can't say 
 That ya knew my brother or other before the 8th grade 
 Ya'll be with drama like your hanging out with kayslay 
 Or the affiliate down in the a that make the tapes play 
 Internet thugs counting the computers they spray 
 We in the atlantis going swimming for the 8th day 
 Not the atlantic ocean, the atlantis hotel 
 Ask reception about me, they'll say they know me well 
 Living like a king baby you gon have ta show yourself 
 Take of the veil a fetish for tugging pony tails 
 Let's chase money call me you know I know the trail 
 Try to get it without me and you gon probly fail 
 Why fly if it ain't no wi-fi and no emails 
 And the lobster bucket where you can throw the shells 
 Yea, we both exchanged shots on twitter 
 Difference between me n' you is you not in villas 
 Told me I'm to die for but I'm not goin kill her 
 But if she look like a rihanna how I'm not going hit her 
 Ha ha, nah I'm just playing nah I'm just joking round 
 How I'm sounding right now is how I'm supposed to sound 
 You would think I was playing poker how 
 Money doesn't fold at stacking it I'm the poster child 
 How does it feel talking tough right at your own face 
 Staring in a mirror realising that ya gold fake 
 Tryna get waves brush your hair n' seeing snowflakes 
 Only date you ever had is one you had to post date 
 Go lick a stamp and tell your tramp I'm feeling that 
 I'm a get her damp and use the stamp to send her back 
 Can't say nothing I ever said was never fact 
 Ya'll stink I listen and smell a scent of whack 
 You tryna figure out which chick I'm a take out 
 We eatin pretty good we don't ever get takeout 
 While you all on the dick looking at media takeout 
 I'm on a stakeout in a brazilian steak house 
 You know it's not a game when ya see what I be left with 
 Put it in my left fist and stack it like it's tetris 
 Freshness abroad and domestic 
 Guess it's why I'm never x'd off a guest list 
 Let's wish that ya'll knew how to get chips 
 And let's wish that ya'll were this impressive 
 Let's switch cause ya'll hop on the next dick 
 Be on so many dicks I bet ya could probly sweat piss 
 They got em and your a hater and a urinator 
 Sick of me balling I'm sorry there's not a cure for paper 
 I'm sorry I'm headed to jamaica 
 To get em wet when that's something you take em to the lake for 
 (Chorus) 
 Hmmmmm never come down 
 Never come down 
 Never come dowwwwwwn 
 Never come down
