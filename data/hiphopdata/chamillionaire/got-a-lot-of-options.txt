(Intro/Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 Uh Huuuh! 
 I got the thugs body rockin' 
 Girls body flockin' 
 I ain't trippin' still got a spot to put the glock in 
 Blades steady choppin' 
 Boppa's steady boppin' 
 Got a lot of ladies yeah I got a lot of options 
 I got the thugs body rockin' 
 Girls body flockin' 
 Clothes lookin' throwed like I just came back from shoppin' 
 Blades steady choppin' 
 Boppa's steady boppin' 
 Got a lot of ladies yeah I got a lot of options 
 (Verse 1: Chamillionaire) 
 Baby all I know is I'm on 4's 
 And this candy over silver sprayed on all my doors 
 These brauds steady tellin' me my car so throwed 
 But my patna hopped right out and picked the braud I choose 
 Beat up in a slab TV screens steady fallin' 
 Lookin' for some chicks and big business to get involved in 
 Use to be on 4's had them swangas steady crawlin' (4 real) 
 Use to hit that cappa and that classic in new orleans 
 I took the doo-rag of the braids but I can't see a thang 
 Sun is out but it look dark in my new set of versace shades 
 Boys wonderin' and tryin' to count what I done made 
 Cause my pockets lookin' pudgy and my jordan's lookin' swayed 
 Darlin' I'm afraid that somethin' isn't right 
 She keeps sayin' that I'm cool but she keeps sayin' she a dike 
 How do I persuade the braud to take the pipe 
 Tell her get off from my swangas or get plumin' in your life 
 (Verse 2: Chamillionaire) 
 Wanna be's throwin' ones tryin' to show that they makin' cash 
 Lookin' stupid than a mother all though it'll raise ya tabs 
 Cause the vehicles and jewelry we got is way mo' advanced 
 There's more colors in a watch than a set of jamaican flags 
 Pick it all up in bags the promoters like make it fast 
 Cause here comes another monsoon and these boys is goin' make it last 
 Y'all hit the club tryin' to act like ya poppin' tags 
 Hit the club and ya new clothes and you know you goin' take it back 
 I'm a fly rides owner ain't no need to take a cab 
 Cause the key ain't nothin' to me I got cars so just take the slab 
 Say you doin' it bigger it trip us so they can laugh 
 'Cause I done ran threw way mo' numbers than student's can do in math 
 40 large in my pocket's is causin' my pants to sag 
 Still in love with my money like I use to say in the past 
 Who can do it better is the question they hate to ask 
 Walk right out ya conversation and hope that it make ya mad
