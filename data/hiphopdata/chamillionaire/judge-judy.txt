They won't let me out 
 I'm locked up, they won't let me out 
 Locked up, they won't let me out (x2) 
 Ay, ay, ay, just let me out (x4) 
 Uh 
 Gettin' paper's my duty, gettin' paper's my duty 
 The police pull me over to me to jail in the tooly 
 When the law ask me why? I said my life is a movie 
 Will Smith wanted happiness, haters try'na pursuit me 
 Then I bumped into Judy, yeah I bumped into Judy 
 I ain't F-ing with apples, most of these rappers is fruity 
 Yeah, ya'll honer the industry, it's try'na pollute me 
 I just bumped into Oprah and want to feel on her booty 
 I just want a lil peace, that won't give me the cutties 
 Got a father with money, like Vanessa and Rudy (Huxtable) 
 I'm the type to get moody if you don't like it then sue me 
 Naw don't sue me, cause really I had enough of that truly 
 You dis chick she was boogie she really think she a cutie 
 She be puffin at night, getting higher than cooly 
 Bags looking like Gucci, cars smelling like? gucci? 
 I don't wanna say her name so let's just call it Suzy 
 Try'na act like she knew me, try'na act like she knew me 
 Try'na friend me on Myspace like how come you wanna prove me 
 She be lying a lot, people say she a groupie 
 She had told me she got a lot in the grease like Judy 
 So the judge looked at me, and the judge said to me 
 "Your a slick-tongue rapper, your rap could never could fool me" 
 Then she gave me my sinners like I had spoke to a ruly 
 She said "I'm goin give you LIFE, if you don't come here and do me! " 
 What? !
