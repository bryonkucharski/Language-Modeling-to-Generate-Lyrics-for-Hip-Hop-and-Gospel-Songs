(Feat. Famous) 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 All I feel is pain 
 Yeah that's what I'm about 
 You hear it every time that I talk 
 All I got is pain 
 I'm going insane I feel it in my veins 
 All I got is pain 
 If you wondering why I'm not smilin' 
 It's because I can't hide it 
 All I got is pain 
 I'm going insane I feel it in my veins 
 All I got is pain 
 Famous: 
 With so much pain 
 Some time it get hard to cope 
 And I be hidin' my emotions so it's hard to show 
 The way I feel about shit only god know 
 And he know I won't quit with so far to go 
 I wanna slab a few cribs and my squad to blow 
 A wife a few kids livin' far from broke 
 I wanna be the live kids never offered hope 
 Thinkin' the world so dirty let me offer soap 
 Feeling like you in a snow storm and lost your Coat 
 In the middle of a ocean and you lost your boat 
 Got fronted 3 keys and you lost your door 
 And you fronter ain't a fronter and he at ya' door. 
 Chamillionaire: 
 All I feel is pain 
 All I got is pain 
 All I got is pain 
 Famous: 
 Like Umbrellas better open up 
 The game shoulda soaked it up 
 Be tryin' bust you cokin up 
 Over what 
 Over what shit root of all evil 
 And I didn't see what it do to all people 
 We all equal in the eyes of the man 
 And I seech in a six 
 Shit had me like damn 
 The fuck goin' on with the nonsense 
 I wanna rap about bout ice but what about my conscience 
 Nonsense fame flow what you wanna 
 Shoot dice fuck hoes smoke marijuana 
 On the cool my generation is some gonna 
 So I fall on my knees the last days our partner 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 All I feel is pain 
 Yeah that's what I'm about 
 You hear it every time that I talk 
 All I got is pain 
 I'm going insane I feel it in my vanes 
 All I got is pain 
 If you wondering why I'm not smilin' 
 It's because I can't hidin 
 All I got is pain 
 I'm goin' insane I feel it in my vanes 
 All I got is pain
