[Female Voice Echos:] Chamillitary Mayne 
 (Chamillionaire over Gorilla Zoe's Lost instrumental) 
 Let me tell you what happen man, it going just like this 
 I'm crawling slow 
 On some new fo's 
 On the way to the mall 
 Next thing I know 
 Man here we go 
 Just got stopped by the law 
 "Hello mister hater, I mean mister officer I wasn't speeding at all" 
 And here go my papers 
 And my registration 
 How come you won't let me ball? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Calling back up now here come the dogs 
 I started losing it 
 I started losing it 
 I'm yelling loud like I hate you laws 
 Now they removing it 
 Now they removing it 
 Taking out everything they saw 
 Now you feel stupid trick 
 Now you feel stupid trick 
 All of that working you found nothing at all 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to staying on the grind 
 Can't just watch you get it 
 Dreaming bout doing it 
 I'm making most 'cause I got to get mine 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm just used to haters talking down 
 I'm never losing it 
 I'm show and proving it 
 No matter what I still got to get mine 
 My ex-homie called my homie and told her that she think I'm lonely 
 Benjamin Franklin's my rodey it's obvious that you don't know me 
 I knowing that y'all ain't goin' catch up with all these condiments on me 
 I keep toppings in my wallet what'chu call that, gawp-a-moly 
 Keep a Angela Jolie rating my tone like she own me 
 But I'm knowing that a white girl could try to do me like Kobe 
 Really just try'na get my Moby will tell you the parts that she show me 
 But soon as she show me she told me that "that's for her and me only" 
 Mistletoe on my belt 'cause I know your chick's superstitious 
 Ya misses kissing my bridges then I make ya misses do dishes 
 It's my matomble you dumbo it ain't no block on my riches 
 If the conversation is ballin' we the only one hitting swishes 
 Every mixtape's like crack, and they knowing that I'm the best D-boy 
 And if it didn't come out right, then you didn't get that from me boy 
 Who the master it's me boy and I'm feeling just like I'm Bruce Lee Roy 
 She said that money is ugly and my pockets looking like evil 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to staying on the grind 
 Can't just watch you get it 
 Dreaming bout doing it 
 I'm making most 'cause I got to get mine 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm used to it 
 I guess I'm just used to haters talking down 
 I'm never losing it 
 I'm show and proving it 
 No matter what I still got to get mine
