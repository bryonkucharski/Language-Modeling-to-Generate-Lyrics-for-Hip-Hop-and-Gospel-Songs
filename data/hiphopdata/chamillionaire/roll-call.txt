Attention, little kids 
 I know, you're fans of his 
 If it ain't no Cham, then it ain't gon jam 
 I threw it, off a bridge 
 And, if it hurts your ears 
 And you're tired, of what you hear 
 Homie have no fear, the Messiah's here 
 We gon shut it down, this year yeah 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 A.N.I. out in Cleveland, Eminem out in taller 
 Lucky Music in Abilene, waiting for my arrival 
 Music City in V.A., say hey ain't nobody tighter 
 Super Sounds in Atlanta, like where that Mix Tap Messiah 
 Colorado fa sho, they say that Koopa's on fire 
 Ask James at Eackazam, he'll tell you I'm no liar 
 Been in the game for a minute, I'm one of the biggest suppliers 
 I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of 
 How the hell you say you blew up so quick, and then rub it in 
 When you ain't seen a royalty check, and know nothing bout publishing 
 I feel sorry for the thirteen year old teenagers, who loving him 
 They try to tangle with the sharks but I'm sorry, he doesn't swim 
 I'ma rip off another limb, no need for partici-hating 
 I suggest that you get to shaking the spot, and just switch locations 
 I wouldn't stop if he told me, if him and Clark Kent was dating 
 'Cause he couldn't spit hotter than me, if that pussy was kissing Satan 
 I know the public is waiting, for Controversy to sell 
 Most of the rest of the real niggaz locked, and ain't made bail 
 Pimp, Z-Ro, 50/50 locked up behind jail 
 Cause of snitch figga ass niggaz, like Dike Jones trying to tell 
 Who (hell naw), who (hell naw) 
 He told me a different story, then the one he trying to tell y'all 
 Who (hell naw), who (hell naw) 
 I don't wan' diss my old dog, so I'ma chunk a deuce for Paul 
 Who told DSR, that he make more than me and P 
 And my nigga Slim Thee, Dike Jones could it be 
 You could of praised my whole body, and couldn't afford a sleeve 
 I don't even drop a c.d., and still clear more than forty G's 
 A month and it's just my check, and ain't even got to my savings 
 The money the bank is saving, plus the money my safe is saving 
 Let's flame him, since he say that he blazing 
 He blew up quick, and nobody was there to save him 
 Keep it cool I tried to, but you know I'm a rider 
 Get respect in Louisiana, and all the way down to 
 Florida DJ Smallz, Atlanta with DJ Drama 
 Off this money I make, I'll probably go hit the Bahammas 
 Get respect in Cali, Vallejo they popping collars 
 Get respect of the streets, you get respected to tollers 
 So what I'm trying to say is, I'ma be here regardless 
 I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of 
 (Talking: Money Mike) 
 Tha-thank you Chamillion, um 
 You hear it here first, at WKTB work your booty 
 Pimp radio station, and um 
 There seems to be an excessive amount of fraud artists out here 
 And we have a couple of artists here, that feel the same way 
 Uh, let me hear what you have to say here sir 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Let me silence all the talk, can't match up with my vault 
 You ain't getting no respect, from real G's on the North 
 You get put in duct tape, you cupcake you too soft 
 Ain't no rapper got broke off, this hard since Tha Boss 
 (Money Mike) 
 I've seen your chain, but how much did it cost 
 You can't be like E.S.G., and let your body defrost 
 Seen the studio that you was saying, was Swishahouse 
 But that was Tow Down's studio, and that was the South 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 You ain't, in the dope game 
 Real niggaz know, he wasn't moving cocaine 
 Real niggaz po' a whole cup, of that drank 
 Niggaz I know, ain't repeating your name 
 What you gonna say now, Dike is a clown 
 Come around hurr, and you gon get beat down 
 Man hold up I'm in the club, sipping crown 
 And niggaz getting tired of Dike Jones, in D-Town 
 And a one and a two, and a three nobody 
 Who he messing with, man it sho ain't nobody 
 (Pass me the Nina), don't worry I got it 
 Say whodie I'll blow his chest up, he won't have nobody 
 (Money Mike) 
 I was gripping on my steal and wood wheel 
 Music on the radio, I couldn't feel 
 Popped in a grey tape, 'cause I'm trill 
 Pussy gimmick nigga, nigga, get real (get real) 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 But nigga don't make me grab this steel 
 Pull it, I'll levitate your crew 
 Nigga you don't represent the real 
 My nigga, don't ever say you do 
 I turn that scene, to a crime scene 
 Don't make me, yellow tape your shoe 
 Cause DJ Screw, elevated Screw 
 And Screw, elevated you 
 Man bring it back, I'm with it
