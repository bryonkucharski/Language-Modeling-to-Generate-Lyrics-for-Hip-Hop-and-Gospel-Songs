 Ah it's murda, murda, murda 
 Yeah it's murda, murda, murda 
 Somebody tell 'em it's murda 
 Murder was the case and they blamed me 
 Verse 1 - Chamillionaire: 
 Officer I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this 
 Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists? 
 You can call me what you wanna but mayne I ain't a snitch 
 No cooperation is exactly what you would get 
 Till I talk till my lawyer, you get no reply 
 You've obviously been watching too much CSI 
 I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try 
 To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI 
 If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run? 
 Cause you the police and plus I saw you cocking your gun 
 And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one 
 If you think I'm believing that one, your obviously dumb 
 Huh? I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in 
 To the vehicle you was driving and ridin' 
 And you shouldn't be whining about abidin 
 By the law, nah it's obvious your lying

 Verse 2 - Chamillionaire: 
 Stop lying to me boy, it'd be best you confess 
 I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath 
 Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck 
 Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest 
 Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop? 
 Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue? 
 Look at this pic here, he standing beside you 
 Tell me his name now, I heard he was piru 
 Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes 
 For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs 
 What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs 
 I coulda sworn he said he had a pocket full of stones 
 Am I wrong? Hell yeah, I don't know who that is 
 I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich 
 And I'ma ball like James, bet I be out here quick 
 Man You ain't getting out of here, you must think that your slick 
 In the car we confiscated The Chronic and The Clipse 
 Diary that you had and all your Blueprints 
 On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints 
 Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this)

 Verse 3 - Chamillionaire/Slick Rick: 
 And you can see your screwed as the evidence pours in 
 The witness to the crime was at 3 in the morning 
 Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and 
 You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him 
 A big celebrity, a case we long for 
 You a pirate, Why you got that eyepatch on for? 
 Funny Puttin' people in a hurse what I heard for 
 Where were you the night of April 21st son? 
 Home, I think that you got your facts wrong, gats on you 
 Chamillionaire, Rob shot Couple cats on Melview 
 What? We gonna have to jail you too 
 In the line-up, don't speak until we tell you to 
 This the person who jimmied your lock, sir? 
 Well he's dark, Kinda looked like him, I'm not sure 
 Fail into nail cause a cell it's another? 
 Leave, I see an unmarked tail in the glover? 
 Hit the Bodega, not no more game 
 This chick used to be all nice, acting all strange 
 Like she was gonna get it, pathetic 
 I sell in court now they all apologetic
