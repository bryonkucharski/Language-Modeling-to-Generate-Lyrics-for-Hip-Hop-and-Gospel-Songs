(Chorus - Rasaq) 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 Uh-Ey (Uh-Ey), I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eh (Uh-Yeah), I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 I be comin' down, (1 for the 44) I be comin' down (2 for the Northside) 
 Eh-Eww I be comin' down 
 (Verse: Rasaq) 
 Excuse me, polo when I be dressed 
 Rose gold around my neck, fingers throwin' up my set eh-eh 
 Pourin' up the cut, open up the trunk 
 Strip out the inside man, I'm showin' up on buck (Aoww!) 
 I'm so cool, the paint so wet 
 Chrome women on my hood look like she divin' in a pool 
 I be ridin' with the tool, I be draped in diamond jewels 
 When it's drama I'ma dummy, look don't make me turn to fool 
 Them other boys cool, but they ain't me 
 I'm the throwdest rhyme boy that ya eyes gon' see 
 Uh, My chain look like a box of cereal 
 Lucky Charms on my arms look like some frosted material 
 Yeah... I want 300 M 
 You want the kind you sit in, I want the kind you spend in 
 Paint changin' blendin', rims swangin' spinnin' 
 Till them thangs is bendin', leavin' stains and drippin' 
 I be comin' down, boys say what does that mean 
 But they soon get the picture when they see them TV screens 
 ...These boys ain't messin' with the flow 
 Nigga, I'm the issh, like you messed up on the floor 
 Ha, you know the flow is so professional 
 Cham' is the next to go, that means that I'm the next to blow! 
 Before this, we been dressin' 24's 
 We put buttons on our rims, when we steppin' out the door 
 (Chorus - Rasaq) 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eww (Uh-Yeah), I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eh, I be comin' down 
 I be comin' down, I be comin' down 
 Eh-Eew I be comin' down
