(Chamillionaire speaking) 
 Damn 
 Rainin again 
 Big pimpin', big pimpin' 
 Ima be in the car though 
 You know I'm sittin' on 
 Sittin' on chrome 
 Bangin' screw I'm bout to get into my zone 
 You know I'm sittin' on 
 Sittin' on chrome 
 Got a lick I'm bout to hit callin my phone 
 You know I'm sittin' on 
 Sittin' on chrome 
 With a bad woman with a yellow tone 
 You know I'm sittin' on 
 Sittin' on chrome 
 Girl I know that you been waitin for too long 
 Yeah... 
 Met a lil chick her name was vicky 
 Later she met me she was tipsy 
 Just met me she said she missed me 
 She belly dancin like a gypsy 
 She lookin' for love she hit me 
 Her and her friend from Mississippi 
 She said that she loved tupac 
 She be jammin that and bangin' ipsy 
 As soon as they play that UGK she bout to take it off 
 She can make you have wet dream before you make it to your house 
 If you think you'll keep it up 
 But she gon' make it make it soft 
 She ain't really with all that talk 
 She'll make you get out like she the boss 
 You askin how much it cost 
 Them dollas rainin like its weatha' 
 But she said she did it for school 
 But she been workin here forever 
 She ain't trippin' 'bout a fella 
 She as addicted to the chedda' 
 They trickin and buyin sweaters 
 But the ben franklins treat her better 
 (Break - Chamillionaire singin' soft) 
 Sit back in my seat and chill 
 You go do your thing girl and ima wait here 
 Go stack your paper up my dear 
 Bring it all to me 
 That's a pretty good deal 
 Yeah... yeah... 
 This view lookin' spectacular 
 Whole club lookin' so packed and uh 
 (Yeah) sittin' way up in the back of the 
 V.I.P tryin' to get a lil action huh 
 When she walk by you tappin her 
 All up on her neck like dracula 
 She drivin' around in a maxima 
 But I moved her up to an Acura 
 Well my Africa 
 Credit card 
 That's black homie 
 Not that only 
 Man I gotta keep my strap on me 
 Case saw my big face stacks lonely 
 Don't act foney, don't act foney 
 Herd through the hood you tryin' to pull a jack on me 
 That ain't somethin' my gat told me when you called me up 
 Girl back for me
