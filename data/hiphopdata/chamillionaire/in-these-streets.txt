-Chamillionaire- 
 Who the trillest, 
 The answer you thought you knew it, 
 You blew it that's why they drew it, 
 The pistol soon as it hits you, 
 You wish you never do it, 
 Bang till your brain spew it, 
 Houston is full of sewege, 
 Its true it ain't nothing to it, 
 They will do it act like you knew it, 
 See I ain't really got to prove it 
 Look around and it show, 
 Cause most of these n***** we use to know ain't even around here no mo, 
 But don't drown in your flow, 
 Cause its deeper look around and hell no, 
 This ain't Cleveland it don't be frezzing but boys around here with snow, 
 Redefining my hoe 
 They think she on the side when she wit em, she ridin' and flippin in your car, 
 You see that wire that's sticking 
 Out her bra federal car right behind him is picking his ass up, 
 But damn broh (damn broh) 
 They done found them a victim, (damn) 
 Walk with me through that spaceship city 
 Where that 9 is the law 
 Channal 13 preview that scene 
 Who did that crime to that boy 
 Walk in on that red carpet 
 Ain't the kind the stars be walking on 
 Chalk is shown (is that right) 
 Outline with that scar (damn) 
 It's real on these streets 
 Niggas be toting heat on these streets 
 Puting bustas to sleep on these streets 
 Playing for keeps in these streets 
 I ougth to eat off these streets 
 Your momma weep 
 Cause now you lay dead on these streets 
 X2 n**** 
 -B.G.- 
 Where I'm from we play it raw 
 We cutthtroat and bout our business, 
 Some call it New Orleans 
 But I nicknamed it Chopper City, 
 It's the home of the Hornets 
 And the home of the Saints 
 But don't get that name twisted 
 We'll toss you off in a lake, 
 If you want work, 
 We'll tell you we got weight, 
 Tax him 22 for a burner, flour, or cake, 
 N**** ride fly in benzes on 22s, 
 Double back drop 26s under the H2, 
 I'm a fool wit it 
 Hoes be like I want him, 
 Fresh Dickie shirt over my tee with some bos and tims, 
 I'm a hot boy, 
 If you ain't know ask somebody 
 On Valence and Magnolia 
 I'm like the Don John Gotti, 
 Don't try me or you'll end up a nobody, 
 On a front of a tee 
 With your people second line, 
 And it's like that, 
 I ain't the one to size up, 
 'Cause if you do me that 
 Then I'ma have to fie up 
 -Stat Quo- 
 Track bang, (track bang) 
 Pimp ho like good game, 
 Got damn shame 
 That boy there got good aim, 
 Across the globe 
 He got pulled like hair strains, 
 Stat Quo the beast 
 Big Bread my nickname, 
 Trunk pop the show 
 My verse is spiritual, 
 Test me and your condition 
 Will end up critical, 
 Started from the A 
 Why he spit so lyrical, 
 He not right for the hood 
 He a south coast miracle, 
 For the strippers, hustlas, 
 And common criminals, 
 9 to 5 workers, lieutenants and generals 
 ? To struggle 
 The grind will injure you, 
 It takes more than crutches 
 To make it through 
 I'm telling you 
 -Soulja Slim- 
 What you're hearing is uptown 
 Is y'all fimilar with that sound, 
 A hundred rounds will gun you down 
 Put your b**** ass underground, 
 Now I want you to know, 
 See I'ma general, 
 Is there a heaven or hell 
 Tell me where the killers go, 
 My pill busting slow, 
 Fill up the dro, 
 I'm bout to tell em 
 What they need to know don't f*** wit us we creepin' low, 
 He out that 13th, he out that 17th, 
 I'm out that muthaf***in 3-9 
 Who want beef, 
 I'll be damn if grown killas stay humble, 
 I could get ya killed 
 Without uppin the bundle, 
 Magnolia that's my project 
 Never call it a jungle, 
 Keep a spot on the block 
 And a key of dope to fumble, 
 I'm down south hustlin, 
 Get paid in many ways, 
 If your lick ova a hundred g's 
 I'm comin' to bust yo head, 
 I say f*** the feds 
 And I'll say it again, 
 From the streets to the pen 
 I play the game to win
