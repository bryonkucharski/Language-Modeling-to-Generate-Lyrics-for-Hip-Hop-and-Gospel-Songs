 Hustles and my players let's talk to these haters do your boy a favor turn right to your neighbors 
 We got of the majors but still doing major nobody can save ya when Koopa bring that major pain 
 Here we go 
 Nah I won't let them turn me pop even though my little niece like Justin Beiber 
 Yeah I made that song Ridin' Dirty but that should let ya know that I clutch a heater 
 Yeah I got played by Michael Jordan and I swear MJ he such a diva 
 Moral of the story is I don't care 'cause yeah I'm still here plus I don't need ya 
 Yeah I met a girl at taco bell that slipped me her number in a fajita 
 Funny thing is ain't order that I took that hoe back and got her beat up 
 Why I gotta get back on my throne on and keep turning these fake fans to believers 
 Yeah I got a car (?) from my major label I swear hung up tha receiver 
 Do you wanna be successful so bad that you know you would do it ever? 
 Would you be the one to jump the ship to be safe or hold that ship together? 
 Would be the chicks that try to leave once you can't live like Cinderella? 
 Would you be broke and chill with god or you would be rich and with the devil? 
 What you gonna do when the music stops or would you still do this accapela? 
 That decision is really yours and it really ain't much that I could tell ya 
 What I know is that I ain't you and my words I'll be the realest ever 
 Chamillitary will rain forever just know I ain't talking about the weather 
 Right and then left right and then left march with me forever soldier take another step 
 Right and then left right and then left march with me forever soldier take another step 
 This is for you know who and don't you ever be mislead 
 I know just how I said it and I meant just what I just said 
 I feel as good as ever when I hop outta my bed 
 Baby you ain't living life you must be already dead
