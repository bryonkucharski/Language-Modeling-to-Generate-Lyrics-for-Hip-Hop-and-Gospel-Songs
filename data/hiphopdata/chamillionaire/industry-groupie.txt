Yeah, On behalf of Chamillitary Entertainment 
 I'd like to extent my deepest apologies 
 To anyone who feels they are offended by the following content 
 Now that we done with all of the nonsense 
 If you know you ain't a groupie, make some noise 
 G-R-O-U-P-I-E 
 Told me that she ain't a freak [x2] 
 G-R-O-U-P-I-E 
 Told me that she ain't a freak [x2] 
 Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me 
 Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free 
 Baby, I thought you were in love with me 
 But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!) 
 See, I got a clue when Young Dro said his girlfriend got a girlfriend 
 That girlfriend of his girlfriend had Chamillionaire as her man 
 Then T-Pain said he was sprung, said he had fell in love with a stripper 
 I shoulda known that you was the stripper that was on the pole tuggin on his zipper 
 Kanye said that you was a gold digger, You always wanted to be major paid 
 I turned on my TV and then I seen you kissin' on Flava Flav 
 We was both fans of UGK, we was both dreaming bout ridin' blades 
 While I was dreaming, you was gettin' laid on everybodys bed and I was getting played 
 Yung Joc knew that we was through, said he knew he didn't stand a chance 
 You stood still while my song played and his came on and you did his dance 
 You kept begging me for romance, I kept telling you that's enough 
 You turned on my boy Juvenile and then proceeded to back that up 
 Pitbull said 'Culo!' and I ain't even that good at Spanish 
 But I knew he was talking to you, I was down with you so I couldn't stand it 
 Don't try to lie, Don't try to cry, Ain't nothing more for us to talk about 
 Like Unk told ya take 2-Steps towards the door and just walk it out 
 G-R-O-U-P-I-E

 Baby, I thought you were in love with me 
 But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!) 
 Gave Bun B a little groupie love, you gave Pimp C a little groupie love 
 And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click and gave every member in the group a hug 
 Even messed with my boy Slim Thug, he pulled up, you had a heart attack 
 You tried to mess with Game and 50 but neither one of 'em called you back 
 Ask J.R., my car was pushed to the limit on Cool and Dre 
 Plus Rick Ross was Hustlin' that money outcha like everyday 
 You knew that I loved you was them three words that I'd never say 
 Now your business all over the radio and it's the penalty that you have to pay 
 You made the choice to go and be a freak, even Akon had been smacking that 
 Her plan was to get ran through by a linebacker or a quarterback 
 R Kelly didn't have to tell me about your bump-n-grind and your foreplay 
 I found out and I asked you if this was true, you said no way 
 Birdman said 'Believe Dat!', T.I.P. was like 'Shawty!' 
 Then Young Jeezy said 'That's Right!' and Lil' Jon said 'Okay!' 
 Heard you was messin with Ray J, you did a flick is what they say 
 I ain't even wanna look at the tape until P.Diddy said Press Play
