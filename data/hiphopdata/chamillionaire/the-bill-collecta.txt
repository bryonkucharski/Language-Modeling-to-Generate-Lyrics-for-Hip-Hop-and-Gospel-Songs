(Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 Now you're in trouble 
 Here comes the bill collecta 
 Now-now you're in trouble 
 Here comes the bill collecta 
 (Krayzie) 
 When I hang up my phone ya already know 
 It's about to go down if you ain't got my paper 
 When I hang up my phone ya already know 
 It's about to go down if you ain't got my paper 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Man... You knew that you had those warrants 
 You kept ignoring those warnings 
 You said that it was annoying 
 Like makin' them payments wasn't important 
 Yo' TV in the pawn but you tell people it's in the storage 
 And When the police pull you over you be givin' an oscar performance 
 A ticket you can't afford it 
 With Expired plates on your taurus 
 Your baby momma stay trippin' cause none of them kids is supported 
 You messed up every appointment 
 That's why you ain't got employment 
 With spiderwebs in your wallet your pockets look like they haunted 
 You always wanted to be famous, well you gonna get what you wanted 
 America's Most Wanted, they 'bout to see ya up on it 
 You normally move like a tortuise, but you get in your car and your floor it 
 But you can't even escape cause the repo man got you cornered 
 (Bridge: Chamillionaire) 
 Better pick up your phone, better pick up your phone 
 Seems like every time I call you I just get a dial tone 
 Better pick up your phone, better pick up your phone 
 Seems like every time I call you I just get a dial tone 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Betta check the check the checker you checking. you ain't gotta profit 
 And you try to hide until the repo man come and shake up dem pockets 
 I'm talkin' to you cause your rent is due and you ain't tryna drop it 
 Till the lights turned off in your crib like lamps that ain't got no sockets 
 They comin' to get what you got and you tryin' to say you ain't got it 
 You ain't paid a payment, a part of it, half a piece or deposit 
 So I suggest that its best that you use some reason or logic 
 Or the bill collect is comin' to come and see ya about it 
 Got it? 
 (Krayzie) 
 Y'all just betta have my dough because 
 I'm comin' around the corner hundred miles and gunnin 
 Finna ride by dumpin' 
 If anybody owe me somethin', then I strongly suggest you run it 
 Y'all better respect the bill collecta 
 Or you'll get chin checked like the rest of 'em 
 Never did joke when it come to the decimal 
 When it come to gettin' dough I'm a professional (fresh ya know) 
 In it to win it 
 I get to bombin in a minute 
 Any and every thing over three digits 
 These suckas they really think krayzie be slippin' 
 But I'm here to tell 'em I den already bent em 
 Money is a mission gotta have that dolla bill y'all 
 Fell its really enough to kill y'all 
 I might fall but I get right back up and still ball 
 Stil raw 
 Still get down with the buck bang 
 So give me all my change 
 Bust brains, 'cause I gotta maintain 
 Got just enough game to get me paid 
 Just enough aim to leave you laid 
 Out on the pavement 
 Down on the game 
 Believe me 
 You'll pay 'cause I got three hundred and fifty seven reasons
