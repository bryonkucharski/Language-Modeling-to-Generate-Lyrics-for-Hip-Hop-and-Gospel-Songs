Na, na, na, na, na, na, na hey 
 They said no when I told them that 
 I'd find a way to get to the top 
 They didn't know that eventually 
 I'd be the one to worry about 
 When someone would mention me 
 They always try to say I would flop 
 But this the sound of revenge 
 The sound of revenge, the sound of revenge 
 The sound of revenge, revenge 
 Yeah, on the path to find out whose true 
 The only person you can really trust is you 
 And if you feel like you can't even trust you 
 Then you can always trust you know who 
 And if you don't know who you know who is 
 Then I feel so sorry for you 
 'Cause that's really the only person that can judge 
 And critics people that wanna see you fail 
 Will tell you what you can do, shouldn't do or must do 
 And when you got that glow 
 Nobody else's words can really bugs you, ha ha 
 Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin 
 And sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win 
 Sometimes it sound like, it's what it coulda been 
 And when you get to the gates of heaven 
 They probably wouldn't let you in, ha ha 
 But to change that meaning 
 Of it success is what it is in the end 
 And instead of worrying about 
 What it should of could of or would it been 
 You turn you head towards the future and keep it movin' 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Well say it again 
 Keep it movin', you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Screw it then know what I'm sayin'? 
 If you waitin' for me to fail 
 Your time is running out on the glock 
 I'm runnin' to the finish yeah 
 When I get there I ain't gonna stop 
 Success is what I couldn't have 
 But now I tell them look what I got 
 But this the sound of revenge 
 The sound of revenge, the sound of revenge 
 The sound of revenge, revenge 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na, na hey 
 The sound of revenge
