Left wing in my crib there's a model room 
 Right wing there's a room just for Almond Spoons 
 I sing on this track that's what they assume 
 Sorry but my engineer ran out of autotune 
 You rap but I feel that you are a coon 
 And the other one's that ain't coon are a foons 
 Try me, and you will fail in the arms of doom 
 Cause that V-ve-Venom album coming soon 
 Fifty thousand dollar fresh in my living room 
 Try to steal it and I bet you won't lit a noon 
 Put the camera on ya chick like I'm Benny Boom 
 And then I hit her quick vroom, vroom 
 Ya girl say she love me 'cause I'm cool and laid back 
 Then she wanna do (what?) I said cool and lay back 
 Perpetrator vision I see through they facts 
 All these rappers sweeter than some Kool-Aid packs 
 My Lincoln longer than two Maybachs 
 My front yard longer than two race tracks 
 Hearing them but'chu know they goin' use they gats 
 I don't be hanging with none of them dudes, they wack (they wack) 
 She was speaking in a whisper like Shawday 
 Well I call her never yes I told her probably 
 Paparazzi you better do what I say 
 To me a face like a camera to Kanye 
 If you late on my team you know docked 
 If I'm late you goin' wait till I move out 
 Got'cha chick bout to take off her tube-top 
 I purchase rims like your Footlock or Shoe-shop 
 Tell her friend that I rather have a enemy 
 Money tall and your money just a mini-me 
 The class gotta S like Hennessy 
 And I gotta SS like Tennessee 
 I stay super fly like a kite, so 
 You should know that you can't see me like a white crow 
 Walk in all the women get in flight mode 
 She bout to take off all her nice clothes 
 Ha Ha
