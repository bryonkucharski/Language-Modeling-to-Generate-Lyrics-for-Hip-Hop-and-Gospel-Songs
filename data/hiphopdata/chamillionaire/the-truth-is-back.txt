Southern Smoke... 
 You hear a lot of music, but it's boring 
 You hear a lot of flows, but don't enjoy 'em 
 You hear a lot of albums, and you snoring 
 But the truth is back, now they say where you been 
 'Cause we ain't really seen you out performing 
 You back up in the streets, you hot you're boiling 
 Chamillitary click, is the click they wanting 
 You know that OG Ron C, gon screw it for them 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 A lot of DJ's, didn't wanna mess with the kid 
 But like dancers that love to strip, they back up on my dick 
 And of course, maybe it's because of the fact that I'm rich 
 And the diamonds up on my wrist, look like a package of piss 
 Looked like they pissed, in a ice cube tray 
 Put it in the freezer, so by the next day 
 They could put it on my wrist, so that I could display 
 Yellow ice looks like butter, but it isn't parquet 
 Hey, well let me tell you how I did it then 
 Stepped up the mixtapes, and put 'em in every city man 
 Send 'em Greyhound, in every other city and 
 Wallet the size of Guerilla Black's, or Biggie's hand (baby-baby) 
 And I got plenty mo' to do dog, that's true y'all 
 Chamillitary is the click, if that's what you thought 
 Yellow green red white blue, and my new jaw 
 Check out the paint, same colors cover my new car 
 When it come to getting fed, I'm the baker with the bread 
 Know exactly what they said, voices ain't just in my head 
 Get back up in the streets, so the rumors can be dead 
 'Cause I'm the rapper that they dread, like Lil' Wayne's head 
 Bumba claat watch, now watch me I'm the one to watch 
 One with a lot of colored cubes, and a bunch of blocks 
 And the watch, and them girls that be coming out 
 The closet with a friend, meet her I just wanna watch 
 Chamillion-ator's on the way, that's who saving the day 
 After the math I bust a rhyme, rapping after you pay 
 Niggaz say they songs jamming, yeah that's just what they say 
 Like Part 2 of that Kelly song, they end up being gay 
 But it ain't Weezy, it ain't even B.G 
 Because how much I push the cash money, they don't believe me 
 Turn on the DVD, and the c.d 
 Don't watch me, homeboy watch TV 
 Head rest, 7.5 Clarion 
 You ain't trying to see me shine, you could carry on 
 Haters hate, and that's the reason that I carry one 
 Make a home run and run home, like Barry Bonds 
 Yeah, I got 'em shook in a towel 
 Ron Artest of rap ha-ha, look at me now 
 Single handedly, handle the suckers up in the crowd 
 Fist to your lip you'll get whipped, while they kicking me out 
 Ouch, cause that looked like it hurt 
 And the worst part about it, is it looks like the dirt 
 Getting acquainted with your shirt, become one with the turf 
 As I watch you fall down, and tell you just what you worth 
 You no good, dirty rotten scoundrel 
 I pull these hoes, like promoters out of town do 
 I get mail, like workers in the color brown do 
 Chamillion you're the best, can't nobody out sound you 
 Chad Hugo to Pharrell, I'm the star on the track 
 Look at my diamonds, and see how many broads they attract 
 And it's true in the studio, they on my balls and my sack 
 Say it's a hit, before Chamillionaire even start on a track 
 I pull up in slow motion, like my car on a flat 
 Trunk going up, like directions that you saw on a map 
 I wear the multi-colors now, but that's part of the fact 
 That I stay throwing up the rocks, like the Carter was back 
 It's the Roc, psyche nigga it's not 
 But it's prolly a rock sized bullet, up in it's pop 
 Sorry mayn I forgot, to put the heater on lock 
 But didn't forget the underground, lock it up for my spot 
 I'm back, and I'm too hot
