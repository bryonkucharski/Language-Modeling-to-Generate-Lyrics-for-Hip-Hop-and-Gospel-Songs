(Chorus:) 
 She say she love the way I take control 
 First in slow motion, then I speed it up and smoke it now 
 Slow it down, slow it down, slowww it dowwwn 
 Now switch it up now 
 She said I always was the best before 
 With the slow motion but the difference is I'm focused now 
 Slow it down, slow it down, slowww it dowwwn 
 Then speed it up now 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Speed it up, uh 
 I gotta genie in a bottle you can rub on 
 I call it henny it I'll help you get ya love on 
 This is the closest that she gettin to a love song 
 Pull out my dick and tell her welcome to the love zone 
 In general I'm a general to you lieutenants 
 Landlord, bad women are my new tenants 
 Runnin round causing trouble like the new dennis 
 The mennace in your girl mouth like her new dentist 
 Uh, get a cavity check 
 You little internet nerds don't have any sex 
 I come n' get her in the rover, the caddy, the lex 
 She take a pic I bet I'm gettin her panties to stretch 
 Yup, I hope ya making it on my list 
 Ya'll never meet another player as cold as this 
 The second that ya ever let me control ya hips 
 I'm deadly and as venomous as a cobra kiss 
 Switch 
 (Verse 2: slowed down) 
 Slow it down, known ta spit 
 If that's your girl better grab her quick 
 Keep telling me that she the baddest chick 
 That translates till she wants my magic stick 
 Grab the whip, slab a kit 
 Wood in my slab like a cabinet 
 Tryna trap me I ain't having it 
 I keep a cap on my head like a graduate, trick 
 Graduation, congratulations 
 Beat turnt up so the slab was shakin 
 Police nah I don't add the bacon 
 Plenty of the grams that I'm tabulating 
 Gravitation, on the rise 
 Looking for a chick with some swollen thighs 
 Piece in my draws really oversized 
 If they told you it's not 
 (Verse 3: normal) 
 Then they told ya liesss 
 Switch it up in slow mo 
 I ain't sweating no mo 
 Krusty like the clown ya man looking like a bozo 
 She can get the bowzack, he can get the 4 4 
 Burn off in my whip while hitting switches like a cholo 
 Superfast and slow mo 
 I be in the zone though 
 Off universal still creeping on the low low 
 Lizard for the logo tricking is a no no 
 For me and her to kick it like some ninjas at a dojo 
 Uh, she bouce on it like a pogo stick 
 While I stick to the scipt on you lames 
 I always bein the posterchild of grippin the grain 
 I always bein the president of getting the change 
 The flow switching the change 
 Then I switch it to slow 
 Ya can't get in her mind I already got in the dow 
 To be specific I'm living the way I'm living my flow 
 When now they know I'm the playa your woman getting to know 
 Let' go 
 (Chorus) 
 (Break:) 
 Hmmmmmm this type of love so off the chain 
 Cause I ain't got a woman with your name 
 And I ain't gotta buy you anything 
 I'm a do it like a pro baby 
 I'm a take it slow cause you knowin that you ain't my dame 
 Don't think just cause you looking good 
 That I'm a be your ticket out the hood 
 Girl I think there's something you should know 
 You can't be my number 1 
 You can be my number 4 and I think that we should take it slow 
 (Verse 4: slowed down) 
 All my broads stay in search of facts 
 That mean a real man that can work the stacks 
 Me and ben franklin the birth of macks 
 Wanna double date he the perfect catch 
 Get a hair cut then reverse the cap 
 Took off the top, then convert the back 
 Black red bottoms with the skirt to match 
 I ain't talking bout her that refer to lac 
 I don't ride on no teenage wheels 
 Open my trunk you'll see 8 kills 
 She got curves but she in heels 
 Say that he her's, but she ain't his 
 I created the term c.o.d 
 I ain't seen a real rapper since p.a.t 
 I ain't heard a real rapper since p.a.c 
 Some of these other boys cool but he ain't me
