Chamillitary man! 
 Get off your couch and go get it! 
 (Chorus (K-Ci)) 
 I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin' bout gettin' this money 
 All I know's I've gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it 
 Now I'm gettin' it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 I'm Up earlier than a mutha, chasin mine 'cause I'm a hustler, 
 And tomorrow everything is gon' remind, gon' rewind 
 Only 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, 
 That ain't enough for me so I ain't wastin time, wastin time 
 Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't gettin' cheaper 
 So you know them dollar signs stay on my mind, on my mind 
 When they ask me where I'm goin', I say you already know it, 
 Bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine 
 I won't let you down 
 Dreams of havin' finer things, riding blades, dreamin' should, 
 Make you wanna wake up and get it In real life and see the wood, 
 In your grill, if you're slip and don't grab what you're seein, good 
 Only place that you gon be or ever see gon be the hood 
 (Chorus (K-Ci)) 
 I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin' bout gettin' this money 
 All I know's I've gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it 
 Now I'm gettin' it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 Boy that word ain't no excuse, you know what it mean to me, 
 Means your passin over opportunities repeatedly 
 Write it on a piece of paper, only thing I see is P 
 Paper paper paper, chaser a better thing for me to be 
 No my services ain't for free, make that money multiply 
 Up early in the mornin I'll be gone A chase with me it ain't gonna be no tie, 
 Tryna explain and give 'em game, I dunno why I even try 
 You'd do the same if you was I but you are you so you gon lie 
 Make them think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs 
 Only thing you get is laughs, you can't even bring down half of the bill that's on that tab 
 ONly thing wrong with being broke is staying broke and makin' excuses 'bout it like it ain't no thang 
 (Chorus (K-Ci)) 
 I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin' bout gettin' this money 
 All I know's I've gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it 
 Now I'm gettin' it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you dEditing Chamillionaire - Won't Let You Down - Lyrics from LyricWikiown 
 I won't let you down 
 In the hood, having nothin', wishin I was havin' somethin', 
 I remember it like it was yesterday, yesterday 
 They was talkin' down on me, and I lost a couple homies, 
 I was gettin' mine while they used to play, used to play 
 They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowin down for nothin', 
 I don't wanna let that paper get away, get away 
 So when I'm in the streets grindin ain't no need to be cryin, 
 The best way that you can help me is to play 
 I won't let you down 
 Pilots that was gettin' lazy, females that was actin' crazy, 
 Them promoters that tried to play me, Mix tape labels that didn't pay me, 
 My old homies that ain't around me, dissin rappers that came to find me 
 Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me 
 (Chorus (K-Ci)) 
 I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin' bout gettin' this money 
 All I know's I've gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it 
 Now I'm gettin' it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, wont let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down 
 I won't let you down
