 Got purp got pills got pills got purp 
 Got purp got pills got pills got purp 
 I-I-I got a pocket full of purp and that gush in my blunt 
 Yeah I'm riding down the block with that work in my trunk 
 Bun B: 
 Well it's the king of the Trill 
 Got the crown on my dome 
 With that super criss connect supply the town on my arm 
 So if you looking for that big fat sac of that lavender 
 Every hour of the day, everyday on the calendar 
 Hit me up I can hammer ya, ya orders I can take em 
 Got a sweet tooth for cake and pies well I make em 
 I mix 'em up shake it till they come back flaky 
 No I won't stop the hustle, can't nann nigga make me 
 Leave ya heart achy breaky when I come through with that girl 
 And that boy like Hannah Montana "Best of Both Worlds" 
 You see the mother of purl on the Rolex pressey 
 Don't make me pull out the shapo with two tone bessy 
 Bun B I'm representing P.A. 
 With the homie bird bigger low coming up of the Bay 
 So let a hater say whatever's on his mind 
 He ain't stopping a dime with me, he's burning on his grind
