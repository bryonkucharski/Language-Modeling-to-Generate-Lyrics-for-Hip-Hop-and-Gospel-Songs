(Intro:) 
 My toy soldier, call me when it's time to 
 Call me when it's time to playyy 
 And just tell me where to go, go, go, go 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Said that they was sisters it was keisha and amanda 
 One's a scorpio the other said she was a cancer 
 One's a bartender other says she was a dancer 
 Well I'm the general introduce me as the commander 
 What you gettin into I said nothing to substancial 
 We just asking you cause we thought you would give an answer 
 I'm like maybe baby but I think I need examples 
 That's what we tryin to do but you won't give us both a chance ta, 
 One to take the handle, one to get it damper 
 Got to be official first you know I got to stamp ya 
 Come sit on my lap and get a present like I'm santa 
 She in all black and cobbin on the wood just like a panther 
 (Chorus:) 
 My toy soldier, call up when it's time to 
 Call up when it's time to playyy, heeeyy eyy 
 Just say I'll be on my wayyy 
 My toy soldier, call up when it's time to 
 Call up when it's time to playyy, heeeyy eyyy 
 Just say I'll be on my way 
 (Verse 2:) 
 Hold up mayne, she just sit back and watch her friend 
 Do her job then she switches 
 Feel like kamasutra she massage with deep kisses 
 My genie is a bottle she say I get 3 wishes 
 Well my first is get it wet then clean it up like deep dishes 
 Knowledge super wet you can call that brainstorming 
 Always tell me I'm the best I confess it's great scrotum 
 I ain't paying for no sex ya'll get played like beethoven 
 Call her up then she collect you call that pay phone and 
 I'm like what the hel you mean she ain't trippin if I choose her 
 Gotta lot of bread that's why always keep a toaster 
 Look at these two stripper poles that I got for ya 
 You and your girl can dance on em we can call that bi polar 
 Then she turned and asked me whatchu wiping off the desk for 
 Cause I'm your professor and tonight I'm bout to test ya 
 Ice in her mouth and a cup I left on the dresser 
 Brain freeze she turned me to the nutty professor 
 Tryin to keep composure sped up like a motor 
 Her friend behind that line I make em pick just like a voter 
 Told her take it slower knew that it was over 
 When she wrapped around it and she squeezed it like a cobra 
 (Chorus:) 
 Toy soldier my, my toy soldier 
 When it goes dowwnn 
 Toy soldier, it goes go, go, go, go
