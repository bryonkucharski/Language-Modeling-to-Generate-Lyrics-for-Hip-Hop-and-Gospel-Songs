(Talking: Female) 
 We not rich like y'all that's one thing y'all goin have to understand 
 But one day this year, we will be 
 Because we have Barack Obama 
 (Hook: Chamillionaire) 
 Haters hate they can relate 
 I'm shinin and living good 
 I got haters all on my dick 
 Try to take my chips 
 I wish you would (I wish you would) 
 I know boys goin playa hate 
 But I still keep my mind on the do 
 And it don't matter cause I don't really mess with you 
 So what'cha need to do is leave me alone 
 That what it is 
 That's You 
 Playas get choose as the groupies try to pick me 
 You standing around me try'na pretend you with me 
 (I ain't F-ing with you) 
 Look at this stripper that's conversating with me 
 Ain't working but act like you ain't finna tip me (Damn skippy) 
 (That's You) 
 Calling with all of that begging on my phone 
 Like the message say "get to begging at the tone" you know that 
 (That's You) 
 Always be whining bout how I did ya wrong 
 Then your the reason I jacked this song 
 I ain't F-ing with you 
 You got dreams of being a famous artist 
 This every rapper that made it like they garbage 
 (I ain't F-ing with you) 
 Always got negative stuff to say regardless 
 That caddy clean but I don't like the way it's polished 
 (I ain't F-ing with you) 
 Always be bumpin like you finna do something to someone 
 But when they show up they do nothing, stop frontin 
 (That's You) 
 Know you a hater that's end of the discussion 
 You mad cause I got a lot and you got nothing 
 (I ain't F-ing with you)

 I'm sick and tired (I'm tired, I'm tired) 
 Of all your lies (you liars, you liars) 
 Let me live my life (my life, my life) 
 Cause I'm goin get mine 
 Don't F with cha so you get denied 
 I'm a tell you for the very last time 
 Now who am I? I am super fly 
 Super I'm bout to come out that suit and tie 
 Bout to come out that coat without that roof and I'm wishing you goodbye 
 Haters try'na bring me down, they look up and shoot the sky 
 Mixtape God cause I go hard but not one you can crucify 
 Here's a checkmate when you reply 
 Sixes got me super high 
 Buckle up your buckle bet my muffler goin palute the sky 
 Bring these rapper in the room I bet'cha one goin lose a life 
 Keep a pistol or some dice, who wanna play truth of die?
