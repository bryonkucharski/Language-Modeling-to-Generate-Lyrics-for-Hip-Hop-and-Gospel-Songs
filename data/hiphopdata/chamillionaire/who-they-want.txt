Attention, we gotta thang for cotton-candy rappers 
 That gotta be in the bed before 9:00 
 Cover ya ears, its 'bout to get ugly baby 
 Now who they want? 
 Me (6x), King Koopa 
 That's what I give em' 
 (The, Color Changin' Click) 
 (Chamillitary man) 
 Now who they hate 
 Dike (7x), then I'm gon' get em' 
 Real niggaz ain't jammin' no 
 (Dike Jones, Who?, Dike Jones, Jones) 
 (Verse 1: Chamillionaire) 
 Yeah, I handle heat like a pizza man 
 You want beef I'll unpack it for ya 
 Mike Jones, is a wack rapper but he isn't a bad promoter 
 You don't know want problems my nigga 
 My stats is way past a quota 
 'Cause I'm gettin' what Flippa says in the initial that's after Clova, G's 
 Nigga please, them commercials ain't even right (why) 
 Texas niggaz be pourin' purple, we bend and remixed that Sprite 
 Okay Koopa stick to this Dike, you right if he wanna fight 
 But this ain't no Lil' Flip beverage he won't have a Lucky Night (nah) 
 He lucky if he have a life, sayin' Cham' ain't gon' get a deal 
 Ain't no rhymer you's a vagina, it's time for some Vagisil 
 Want problems then Crank It Up, ain't no Static or Banner here (nigga) 
 I crush that lil' man career, like a Budweiser can of beer 
 Bout to dig up a deep hole, so ya album can rest and sleep 
 You can put all ya lyrics in it the gimmicks can rest in peace (Who?) 
 I bought ya CD, you was sayin' how you the best in the streets (Uh-Uh) 
 So I had to go get my quarterback like niggaz who step in them cleets 
 Hut 1, Hut 2, now you in some trouble fool 
 And my brother don't like you now, you got trouble in doubles dude 
 And you won't get to guzzle juice, no opening for ya food 
 'Cause the only way to shut you up, is a muzzle to muzzle you 
 Watch the punisher punish WHO?, nah, I don't have to ask ya 
 You said it, now you gon' get it, and I ain't gon' have a hassle 
 You ain't the King, I should know I'm the nigga that built the castle 
 I pull my back-hand and slap you, turn you 'to a dizzy rascal (WHO!) 
 That ain't hip-hop, I swear that garbage gon' get stopped 
 I'ma kill the tick-tock you got in your flea-market wrist-watch (Fuck that 
 Nigga) 
 He said I fell off, and Koopa could never get hot 
 Can't pull my dick out, 'cause he got my dick in a lip-lock 
 Man, I'm just sayin' though get off my genetalia 
 Get off my nuts, I'm bettin' ya, no you ain't no competitor 
 Mo' money and mo'record sales, etcetera etcetera 
 So I'ma delete you, and put Magno back there instead of ya (OH!) 
 Now who they want? 
 Me (6x), King Koopa 
 That's what I give em' 
 ...Now who they hate 
 Dike (7x), then I'm gon' get em' 
 Real niggaz ain't jammin' no 
 (Dike Jones, Who?, Dike Jones, Jones)
