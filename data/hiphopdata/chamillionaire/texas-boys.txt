 Texas boys roll SLAB's rollin' slow and never fast 
 'Cause we sittin' on glass, and we showin' off this cash 
 On the mash, tryna multiply the stash 
 Bump yo gums and make us mad we gon' get up in yo ass 
 Like a rash when a Texas boy act, 
 That's yo toe up in a tag, and ya body in a bag 
 We ain't usually this mad, usually we zag 
 Let the bumper-kit drag, and we blowin' on grass 
 Trunk on blast, sippin' on my last 
 Rollin' down the Ave., in I rolled down the rag 
 You see them DVD's, you see them 8 TV's 
 You see that Pioneer, Clarion and that JVC 
 You see them lad-ies on my n-u-t'z 
 Down here it's country tunes we don't mess with MC's 
 I'ma hold it down, we gon' slow it down 
 Recline and blow a pound, put this hoe up in rewind 
 - Uh, now what you know about us, (What y'all know about them Texas boys) 
 Come up in the club and we lean by the cuffs 
 Uh, now what you know about us, (What y'all know about them Texas boys) 
 5th wheel on the trunk, hit a switch and lift it up 
 Uh, now what you know about me, (What y'all know about them Texas boys) 
 S-L-A-B, sittin' on "23's 
 Uh, now what you know about T,-E to the X-A-S, 
 We some G's
