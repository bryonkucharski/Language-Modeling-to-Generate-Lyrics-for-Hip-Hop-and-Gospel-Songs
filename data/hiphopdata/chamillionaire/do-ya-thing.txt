(Hook: Magno) 
 You gotta wide body whip (whip) 
 Big mother ship (ship) 
 Trunk on lift with them golds in your lip 
 They rushing to the stage but you don't even trip 
 Cause you know they wanna hear you drop a gift 
 Let it rip! 
 Do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Ah do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Do your thang 
 Ladies represent! 
 Do your thang, girl (do your thang, girl) 
 Do your thang, girl (do your thang, girl) 
 Ah do your thang, girl (ah, do your thang, girl) 
 Do your thang 
 It's Magno, ya heard! 
 You can catch me on stage, braids with the shades 
 Stage like Beeman so I'm bout to get paid 
 I do it for the city, I do it for the state 
 And with forty-five interceural belt weighs eight 
 To the Nouf (Nouf), tracheal spouse 
 Wood wheel touf, left hand like Eddie Hoff 
 I kick it with a chick, honey gotta pass mouf 
 Hit the switch down quick, bunny hop pass douf 
 That's where I used to do, now-a-days I'm used to loo 
 Travel in a brustaloop, swang it like a hula-hoop 
 Tacoma with the deep-tents, aroma be the weed scent 
 Tear my hoes apart by persona in they neat prints 
 Everyday's spark flamer, old school dunk flamer 
 Flat upperdunk banger, part-time trunk trainer 
 I'm the ish I demand diaper 
 Coming down sand piper in a tan Viper 
 Either that or a wide body whip (whip) 
 Big mothership (ship) 
 Trunk on lift with them golds in your lip 
 They rushing to the stage but you don't even trip 
 Cause you know they wanna hear you drop a gift 
 Let it rip! 
 Do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Ah do your thang, mayn (do your thang, mayn) 
 Do your thang 
 Ladies represent! 
 Do your thang, girl (do your thang, girl) 
 Do your thang, girl (do your thang, girl) 
 Ah do your thang, girl (ah, do your thang, girl) 
 Do your thang 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Ay, put'cha in detention and don't ask for permission 
 Groupies hopping in and try'na ask what we flippin' 
 Open up the door I call it suicide mission 
 Got no door handles, they some track no edition 
 On my iPod, important on my data 
 My answers still no but she hoping I'm a date her 
 Yella as a Laker, I'm more than just a playa 
 Got dimes in the H, a couple courters in Decatur 
 Man I should of known that Mike Jordan was a hater 
 The dude on TV a real perfect imitator 
 Thinking I'm a save her, I ex-ported traitor 
 If the chick the air-head, I ain't trippin' I deflate her 
 Plus she black, white and run game like the Raiders 
 She can ask the doe but can't never say I paid her 
 I ain't chilling in the office I'm a holla at'cha later 
 I'm a be on D-block like them boys that be with Jada
