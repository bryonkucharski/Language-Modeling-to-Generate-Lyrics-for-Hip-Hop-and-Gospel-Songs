 Feeling like a rock band 
 Eighty-seven jeans and white-T when on the block man 
 Jay's still rocking 
 Forces still moving 
 Chuck Taylor's killing 
 Adidas still grooving 
 Locs on my face 
 But that's just the front 
 Take 'em off and show the haters when I wanna stunt 
 Get'cha high like a blunt 
 Rolling up the best 
 Fruity Pebbles got a hands rolling up my chest
