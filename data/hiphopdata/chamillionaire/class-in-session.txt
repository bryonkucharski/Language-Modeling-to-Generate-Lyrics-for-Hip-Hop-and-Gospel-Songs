 Class Is In Session, It's Mister Koopa Baby 
 I hear a lot of whispering about if I'm still it 
 Well if I ain't the one on fire then tell me who's lit? 
 And if it ain't MIxtape Messiah then tell me who spit? 
 You probably gonna say somebody that ain't goin' do ish [slow brake] 
 Tosin 
 I am legend but I'm betting you like who Will Smith? 
 If any of y'all goin' be the future of rap then we'll quit 
 Y'all sweet as ice cream I got a full clip 
 So mind ya manners my bananas goin' make sure you split 
 Make 'em get pissed ya call 'em some piss-gitters 
 Keep a duece-duece ya call 'em some ditch-diggers 
 Keep hard Chris Bills I call 'em my stick figgas 
 And I don't curse but God hate us a call 'em some... 
 First they try to tell me I won really repping Houston 
 My Grammy and my V.M.A. let me introduce them [slow brake] 
 First they try to tell me I won really repping Houston 
 My Grammy and my V.M.A. let me introduce them 
 Bad chicks that used to turn me down like I was gruesome 
 Now they all up on my dick cause my rim done grew some 
 Ha Ha, I'm feeling Trilla then I ever been 
 Dissinagrate hate ya left with no skeleton 
 Death ain't prejudice, race got no relevance 
 My lyrics bring back either race with two senisance 
 Yeah, and I ain't really caring who you with 
 Homies ya put on try to cross ya like a Crucifix 
 Homies ya put on are ones that were saying you the best 
 "Put on for my city" but look how quickly you forget 
 Ha Ha, and putting on I'm the king 
 Shoulda, woulda, coulda, you ain't goin' do a thing 
 Step into the room no ignoring my bling 
 I'm the Mixtape God call me Lord of the Rings 
 Retarded money, stupid paper is Koopinator 
 I told'cha it's motivation so I'm recruiting haters 
 I been the greatest you talking like you can save us 
 If you can save us, how come you can't get to the majors? 
 I'm Houston Lakers, L.A. to Houston earning riches 
 Got Houston acres, Real Estate money I'm the realist 
 They say a pic worth a thousand words I'm burning pictures 
 'Cause I ain't with all the words, I'm more concern with digits 
 The rappers is like Cadillac coupes 'cause I feel 
 You can come out but need to be dropped the same year 
 Be a lyrically ya sub name a rapper I can't kill 
 Got it lined on my bullet insert his name here 
 TOSEN or TOSIN I'd rather call 'em TOSIN 
 Cause TOSIN rhymes better with the words I use for Bow-ston 
 Like Procan, Procan's a word I use promotion 
 The way my shiny swaggers thick and way out in the ocean!
