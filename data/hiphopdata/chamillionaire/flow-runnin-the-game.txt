Chamillionaire: 
 You can lick the dick on a stick 
 If you don't think that I'm the ish 
 You mad 'cause you suck like some lips on a big tit 
 Hoe? No, I'ma laugh 
 Ice clearer then fiber glass 
 Bootleggers without a lab 
 Don't hide 'cause we'll ya ass 
 Chamillion is kinda mad 
 I'm rich like I'ma crab 
 Make niggas rewind it fast 
 Tow-trucks wanna sign my ass 
 So much... ice on my chest 
 Under my nose, on my golds 
 These hoes be thinkin' I was raised by rich eskimo's 
 I'ma walkin' Fort Knox 
 Oops, my fork dropped 
 It's okay, I ride more chops then chop-sticks and porkchops 
 At a Chinese buffet, trickin' tricks you got to get 
 No respect, never let so you can't have her set 
 Her boyfriend talkin' bout, "Hey, where that bastard went" 
 When I grab ya ass and then act like it was a accident 
 I'ma walkin' accident 'cause everywhere I go I wreck 
 I'm as throwed as what ya throw to your pet when playin' fetch 
 Wanna crawl off that wet, I see a goofy group of groupies 
 'Cause you wrapped in Coogi and Gucci don't mean you ain't a hoochie 
 Salute me when you see me, play fetch with fake breasts 
 All day at my rich swishahouse, niggas to raise the bets 
 Watch when Lil' Wayne get mad if I said I make fresh 
 Give me all his beats, lunch money and paycheck 
 Yes, damn that was what I was gonna say next 
 But nevermind rewind to where I was talkin' bout fake breasts 
 Believe I keep heat and got bullets that heat seek 
 My beeper got more beeps then a Bentley horn, *beep beep* 
 My pager got more pages then a Webster's Dictionary 
 I pull more work in a busy gravedigger in a cemetery 
 Nigga you got beef? *Powww* we ate flesh 
 Nigga who that gotta deep-hole in ya A-Virex 
 Got her bouncin' like fake checks 
 So doin' the face sex 
 'Cause I'm the throwdest to ever wreck and kill tape decks
