(DJ Screw: It's Goin' Down) 
 [Chorus - Chamillionaire] (DJ Screw) 
 Last night I had a dream, the north and south had no mo' plex 
 And Houston was the place to be 
 (It's Goin' Down) 
 Standin' taller then the rest 
 A dream and memory (It's Goin' Down), of DJ Screw gotta show respect 
 So put ya lighters in the sky with me 
 (It's Goin' Down), R.I.P. this is what was said 
 I had a dream I said, about who god said 
 Dirty south went nationwide 'cause of DJ Screw, I said 
 Is that true?, god said, yeah it's true I get 
 To do flows, and wreck show 'cause of DJ Screw I'm fed 
 But don't be mislead, you the reason we get bread 
 Please tell him when I get to heaven, it's gon' be respect 
 He the reason we get checks, ain't gotta be in debt 
 Ya music helped alot of southern families to get fed 
 They won't say what I just said (why?), 'cause some of these guys scared (oh) 
 Just tryin' to acknowledge and put it in these guys heads 
 I see, I said, then deed, god said 
 That he glad that the north and southside P.L.E.X.dead 
 I agree, I said, R.I.P., I said 
 Rest In Peace to the legend Screw and P.A.T. I said 
 Swear I still jam ya music, I won't let no one abuse it 
 Can't do it, another's foolish if he think that he the truest 
 'Cause you was the first to screw it, you rule it but I'ma student 
 I'm new at the stuff ya started, but I'll do it until I'm through it 
 Life after I lose it, go have a talk with the streets 
 And they gon' tell ya that I respected the game, Rest In Peace 
 [Chorus - Chamillionaire] (DJ Screw) 
 Last night I had a dream, the north and south had no mo' plex 
 And Houston was the place to be 
 (It's Goin' Down) 
 Standin' taller then the rest 
 A dream and memory (It's Goin' Down), of DJ Screw gotta show respect 
 So put ya lighters in the sky with me 
 (It's Goin' Down), R.I.P. this is what was said
