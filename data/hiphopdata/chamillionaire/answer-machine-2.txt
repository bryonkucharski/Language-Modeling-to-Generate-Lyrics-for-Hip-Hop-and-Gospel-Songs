(This song borrows from Trae's "Swang") 
 "Niggaz better see a nigga roll 
 Starch diamonds and I'm rollin' on 84" 
 Ay, ay, ay swang and I swang and I swang to the left 
 I pop my trunk and now she tellin' me she's so impressed (yes) 
 It's the answer machine (yes), it's the answer machine 
 Leave the message for me after the tone 
 If you callin bout some money, you say I owe you youse a bloody lie 
 That's a science fiction like that movie with the ugly fly 
 Money stackin high, got it lookin' like a money sky 
 Jam rag by your thigh, (ha ha!) baby youse a bloody lie 
 I don't care what they show you OR they tol' you, (tol' you) nigga please! 
 Tell you-know-who they shouldn'ta been bootleggin my mix CD (please!) 
 Some of y'all sucks, so keep suckin while I squirt and squeeze 
 Liftin up the muscle, like, "Hercules! Hercu-LES! " 
 Hope you don't hurt ya knees, let me grant ya next wish 
 Awkward feelin' that you got soon as you leave ya ex-it 
 Ladies, don't be shy, give it a try, you should mess with 
 The Mixtape Messiah's runnin' in, that's right you guessed it 
 Laid up with a broad (broad), help me with my message 
 It's Chamilitary mayne, you know who the best is 
 You know won't nobody in the underground can test this 
 You know who the flyest and the freshest in the flesh is 
 Nah, I got no daughter or no son, but I confess this 
 A playa in a playa that I'd know you'd be impressed with 
 I could sit here braggin about how lovely that my sex is 
 But words cannot describe my lovin' in a couple seconds 
 Enough with all the small talk, come over and undress miss 
 You won't have a small thought when you come and undress this 
 Naw, just say "ah" open up ya jaw and press this 
 Up against ya tonsils then after that I'll press this...
