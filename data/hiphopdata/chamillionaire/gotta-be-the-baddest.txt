(Intro:) 
 Owww, woow, shes so beautiful 
 Nah I'm talking about you move to the left baby 
 I'm talkin about the car, ha 
 I'm just playin baby 
 Now all my players in the house, all my players in the house tonight, come on 
 Now all my ladies in the house I can make you feel incredibly right, uh 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Now this for all the guys who tricking on all the women I know 
 Writing love notes like I paid the note on your tahoe 
 Purchasing more than nachos, chocolates and moskados 
 Say she your darling and you balling like chicago 
 You giving her d. rose you trying to be mvp man 
 Most valuable player you should throw your defeat in 
 Love her and never cheating you eating and never skeeting 
 Lean in the car and kiss me before she can get her feet in 
 Eyy, 
 That just mean that she couldn't wait 
 She tell me I smell good I tell her she looking great 
 She say that she love the car to get it what did it take 
 I say this isn't a rental it didn't come with a rate, we late 
 Let off the brakes and then we proceed to coast 
 I tell her that if she wants she can get as high as the slopes 
 She say that she doesn't smoke do you I tell her nope 
 And that one word got her wet as a bar of soap 
 Let's open an envelope we gotta give an award 
 To someone who could pull them by never saying a word 
 Before ever leaving the curb without opening liquor and never breaking an herb 
 I know this don't sound possible to some of you lames 
 Bout to strain your whole brain tryna get her ta change 
 You got to name drop names of every person you came 
 In contact with in your life that's just terrible game 
 Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living the lie 
 Just be playa you should give it a try 
 And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I 
 Then all my players put your hands in the sky, one mo time 
 (Chorus:) 
 Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living a lie 
 Just be a playa you should give it a try 
 And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I 
 Then all my players put your hands in the sky 
 You gotsta be the baddest 
 You gotsta be the baddest girl 
 You gotsta be the baddest 
 You gotsta be the baddest girl 
 (Verse 2:) 
 You know you gotsta be the baddest 
 If you really goin make me add this 
 6 dollars and 55 cents to my tab miss 
 Wait a second just do the math if 
 This equals a drink then it also equals your address 
 Haha I'm just playing nah I'm just serious 
 Object in the mirror is clearer than it appear it is 
 Every girl that's hearing this wanna ride a luxurious 
 Mercedes for ladies with the upgraded interiors 
 Yea roam with a player that got experience 
 Stuntin and feelin on all of your different areas 
 Playin spin the bottle till we both get delerious 
 Curosity killed the cat just call me curious 
 Because you know I'm bout to kill it tonight 
 All my players put your hands in the sky 
 And ladies you say you partuin with us and say you bringina freind as fine you it better not be a tie 
 Cause you gotsta be the baddest 
 Really your friend is average 
 You dope and your friend shady it's like I'm cashis 
 Really she should relax if I'm talking to you then why is she saying your ad libs (you bad miss) 
 Nah I don't trust her she got a fast lip 
 If her mouth could run I know hers would run a lap quick 
 Fast chick if she ain't a snake then she an actress 
 Leave her alone with me well see how cut that the grass is 
 (Chorus) 
 Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living a lie 
 Just be a playa you should give it a try 
 And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I 
 Then all my players put your hands in the sky 
 You gotsta be the baddest 
 You gotsta be the baddest girl 
 You gotsta be the baddest 
 You gotsta be the baddest girl 
 (Verse 3:) 
 You know I lost a little venom the lyrics are still as toxic 
 Lookin at my watch she notice it ain't a clock tick 
 None of em successful when ever they try to lock chicks 
 Cause in another life I probably coulda bein a locksmith 
 Hear boys sayin nah he ain't messin with my chick 
 Now she shotgun and that's why they call it the cockpit 
 Then I see you in your lil designer outfit 
 And look at you what is that velvet nah just ostrich 
 You fly you even bought you a tie 
 I walked right past her and didn't even say hi 
 She turned and watched me walk past and yell bye 
 I'm wondering what I said to even make her reply 
 I guess that's how it goes when your dealing with pro's 
 I'm really ssayin nothin and she know to remove her clothes 
 Ain't taking none of these hoes you know to papadeuxs 
 I'm pulling up to the curb and then I'm just popping dows 
 Get out
