(Chorus:) 
 If you ain't never spent tonight with me then try it 
 Cause she can't be too fast with too much speed and mileage 
 The ugly one always talking like she the hottest 
 But we ain't never tripping we b g's about it 
 I'm getting knowledge just like I got b's in college 
 You know she almost fainted when she seen my closet 
 And if you just like me you give her d deposit 
 So she ain't bring a friend then she should think about it 
 (Verse 1:) 
 Hold up 
 Got so many cars see em soon as I walk out a dow 
 Whole bunch of colors and my view like a calatascope 
 Women in the kitchen making grits and cutting antachokes 
 Plus they watching movies I ain't with that parry tyler tho 
 Baby girl your face is cute I don't know bout that body tho 
 I would love to stay n chat but money talks I gotta show 
 Gotta few that creo but they don't be jammin zotico 
 They be jammin that koopa and say that boy z-ro gotta flow 
 Shout out to my hoes in dallas got some girls in funky town 
 Dropped that major pain they say that pain what they be bumping now 
 They used to jam them other boys, them other boys be suckin now 
 I ain't even gonna tell em what this girl is sucking nooow 
 Bust it out then I'm gon bust it in 
 I can't stand when she tryna she can't because her friend 
 Don't be a follower just swallow up this cup of gin 
 And you know where to meet me ring the bell n I'm gon buzz ya in 
 (Chorus) 
 (Verse 2:) 
 Say she ain't a groupie but say she want an autograph 
 I just want some knowledge just point me to where your college at 
 Got some andre n 3000 it's like I was part of kast 
 If you get too drunk then get a driver and go call a cab 
 Knew that she was wasted she askin me to buy the tabs 
 Saw another bad one but her man had saw I spotted dat 
 Then she turned and looked at me and really that's what got em mad 
 He gon mess around n get beat up in need of body casts 
 When I'm gettin choose what they be expecting me to do 
 Met a bougie chick that's tellin me that she don't need a boo 
 Take a look at you then take a good look at my vehicle 
 What I'm driving make me feel like I should be conceited too 
 Got a army you know the chamillitary hold it down 
 Hit the after party call it work and call it overtime 
 You can't see how I be shining baby then ya know ya blind 
 Gotta attitude but get a pass because ya know your fine 
 (Chorus)
