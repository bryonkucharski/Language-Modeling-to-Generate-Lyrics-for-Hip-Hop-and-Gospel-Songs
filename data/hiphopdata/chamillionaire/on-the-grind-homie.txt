 Koopa!

 And she like 'Boy, you tha truth' (You tha truth) 
 And he like (yeah) 'Boy, you tha truth' (you tha truth) 
 And she like (hold up) 'Boy, you tha truth' 
 (Talking over chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 So what I'm goin' try to do is 
 Go a little faster 
 Then I'm a go a lil slow 
 Switch upt he style a lil bit, knahtalkinbout? 
 You ready? 
 I'm ready, baby 
 Turn my headphones up 
 Hear it go 
 I'm back to the bone, it feel like I'm the best and they cannot contest when I'm kicking that mess 
 Cause ya chick is undressed when she lifting her dress It's like Mannie and Fresh they be looking like flesh! 
 Anybody that's on the net, saying Chamillionaire ain't the best 
 Get off the D, get off the I and let your keyboard figure the rest 
 'Cause I impress my own self, and only the man upstairs can judge me 
 Re-tellers open ya mixtape rappers than they hug me 
 I control the market, even bootleggers be lovey dovey 
 Plus the necklace got 'em thinking that Johnny the jeweler's my buddy 
 Crash test the best, 'cause if you hate me than youse a dummy 
 Gimme a month I bet you turn the opposite of chubby 
 Ever verse is crack, and crack kids be singing they love me 
 Mix-tape Messiah 4 I bet that you become a drugy 
 They sayin' that money talks, rappers better not I make a sound 
 Walkin' a major money, is none of these rappers is found 
 Even the mayor know my papers enough to buy the town 
 Plus the wheels of fortune, so I'm a bout to buy a noun 
 Ever verse is a msterpiece, my money's still stacking like Master P's 
 Feeling like Mighty Mouse the way I be taking flights to stack the cheese 
 Please, you better not make another sound 
 Yeah, yeah I rep the Texas they just "Download my style" 
 Welcome to the garage, pick any car and the room she yells 'which' 
 Like she was staring at the lady that's on the broom 
 Can't call it a fleet (why) more like a patone 
 Different car everyday of the week from fourth of July till June 
 Look at how they change they tone, who not playa 
 In the wind I'm in Berlin, I know it's you not dear 
 Into the coat in the ATM they sound like AOL 
 Soon as I'm checkin' my account it tells me "You Got Mail" 
 Ha, ha, Merci Bocu Monname, who is cold as me? 
 Betty fresh kiss the kicks when they stick in all his teeth 
 French chick was in the whip, now she sitting on the street 
 She was looking fine till she ask me she can hold a G 
 Yeah, and if I want I'm a get it 
 And if I don't really want it, then it can leave I'm a let it 
 Used to be N Luv With My Money, now I'm in love with my credit 
 By the bar with they dollars I buy a building with debit 
 Uh, I hit that Harlem Nights, It's goin' prepare the storm 
 Look up to the roof it's reindeer, feeling like Santa's home 
 Famous bet that he could leave out with the baddest one 
 Call her dot com 'cause she lookin' like she Amazon 
 Got her suit like T.I., and I got a hundred million more to go 
 Boys in Texas D.E.Y. know they know like Shorty (Shawty) Lo 
 Lil Boosie check out the bang, getting check ya shorty know 
 Checkout my bank account they won't ever come up shorter low 
 Woo, they be like Koopa you so cocky bro 
 'Cause I did everything that they say was impossible 
 And I feel like a one man wrecking crew, what I need a posse for? 
 All this ice on me like I got hit with hockey throat 
 Duck, they say that they wanna have fun 
 Feeling like Sliverspoons in the pool of the mansion 
 See ya breast stroking in the nude and I had one 
 So I'm a 'turn the camera on the pool', like Camron 
 Had this chick in the crib, told me that I was difficult 
 Told me I should go back to the days when I had the glistening too 
 Then she tried to tell me I should go back to rap with, Who? 
 Mappala Weezyana (yeah) I bet'cha that she gonna get the boot 
 Kop, mother nature must of had a son 
 'Cause I'm flyer than the roof in the gigantic storm 
 They say Mixtape Messiah here, haters prepare better to run 
 When ya see me greemy like "Cannon" 'Cause I am a don 
 HUH!
