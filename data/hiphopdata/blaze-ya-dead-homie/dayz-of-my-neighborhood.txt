(Blaze) 
 G's up hoe's down 
 I don't give a fuck if you's a nation-wide baller or rapper from my town 
 You need to bow down, out of respect or fear 
 I ain't asking, I'm demanding, make sure the message is clear 
 Hey now player, it's all right, stop speaking my name 
 Unless you're looking to fight 
 I ain't looking to battle rap, with you 
 I'm looking to unload my gat, and bust a cap in you 
 These bitches never learn, these bitches talking shit 
 Why a man turn a bitch? that shit I'll never get 
 If my name falling out your mouth (Stop that!) 
 If my name falling out your mouth (I pop gats!) 
 In the dayz of my neighborhood 
 Do you remember what it was like when G's was real, and thug was life 
 Sands through the hourglass, and the time change 
 All bitches still act the same, you ain't thug 
 Do you remember when G's was real, like stainless steel? 
 Gats they tote, catch a bullet in your throat 
 Bitches nowadays, need to get sprayed 
 Tricks ain't on the game, and the ghetto serenade 
 My name keeps falling from out your mouth 
 Which causes me and my homies, to pull the heaters out 
 Find a bitch up in you, and we beat her out 
 Put the barrel in yo' mouth, pull the trigger, and we out 
 These bitches never learn, these bitches talking shit 
 Why a man turn a bitch? that shit I'll never get 
 If my name falling out your mouth (Stop that!) 
 If my name falling out your mouth (I pop gats!) 
 In the dayz of my neighborhood 
 Do you remember what it was like when G's was real, and thug was life 
 Sands through the hourglass, and the time change 
 All bitches still act the same, you ain't thug 
 "Damn the game's fucked up 
 Rappers want to be actors 
 Actors want to be thugs 
 And some of y'all thugs is falling in love 
 What's up, you need a hug?" 
 Back in the day respect was earned from blasting shots 
 The game changed, y'all got earnings by getting shot 
 People getting over, by sleeping with bitches on tracks 
 And others looking for them, so they labeled wack 
 And the media quick to jump on the nuts, of who's on top 
 They turn on you, as soon as someone else calls you a flop 
 It's some fucked up shit, but it happens all the same 
 But tell me do you recall, or remember them dayz? 
 These bitches never learn, these bitches talking shit 
 Why a man turn a bitch? that shit I'll never get 
 If my name falling out your mouth (Stop that!) 
 If my name falling out your mouth (I pop gats!) 
 In the dayz of my neighborhood 
 Do you remember what it was like when G's was real, and thug was life 
 Sands through the hourglass, and the time change 
 All bitches still act the same, you ain't thug 
 (Repeats over) 
 You ain't thug!
