I remember it all... 
 Man there he go right there 
 What's up now muthafucka? 
 (Gunshots) 
 Now you's dead muthafucka 
 Hey Blaze 
 Blaze wake up 
 It's time to wake up Blaze 
 Your rest is over 
 It's time for you to open your eyes and wake up 
 It's a shame you were put to rest 
 We watched you 
 You were always our favorite 
 Always willing to work for the master with such little reward 
 Well since we took over things are gonna be a little different now 
 And even though 11 years is a long time 
 It's definitely not an eternity 
 Wake up Blaze 
 There's still work to be done 
 Blaze 
 Wake up...
