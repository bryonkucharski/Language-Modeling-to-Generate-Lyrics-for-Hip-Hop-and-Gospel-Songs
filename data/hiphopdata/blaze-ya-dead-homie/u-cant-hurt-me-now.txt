You're about to hear the tale of an indestructable man 
 He's dead and he's pissed 
 He's roamin the streets at night lookin' for ways to die 
 Should you encounter him, the undead, the dead ass zombie 
 Do yourself a favor and get the fuck out 
 (Blaze) 
 B to the L to the A-Z-E 
 Bitch muhf**ka, you can't hurt me 
 If you break my legs, then I break your back 
 Relax and kick back in a bed of thumbtacks 
 Matter fact, you can slit my throat 
 Spill blood on my leather Psychopathic coat 
 I'ma laugh in ya face, you can't kill a dead man 
 You can try..., I'm serious, you can 
 Under my jersey, bullet holes 'bout the size of Milwaukee 
 You better step up off me 
 Pale faced with the maggots all around 
 I leave a couple few off in each and every town 
 My leg falls off every other day and shit 
 But I'ma try superglue, a hair apiece sticks 
 So who you lookin' at and what'chu gonna do? 
 You can try to kill me, I'ma sho' gon kill you 
 (Chorus-Jamie Madrox) 
 You, you can't, you can't hurt me now! (Ain't shit you can do) 
 Ain't nothin' stoppin' me from killin' you! 
 You, you can't, you can't hurt me now! (Ain't shit you can do) 
 Ain't nothin' stoppin' me from killin' you! 
 (Blaze) 
 I ate a pack of firecrackers (Did it Mix) 
 When I piss, sparks shoot straight outta my dick 
 Get the picture before I stab you with the knife 
 But you can't take somethin' that I don't have nothin' of, right? 
 That's right, I'm more than a ghost 
 I still slang ki's on the corner by the light post 
 I can't walk the walk 
 But I stray scarin more ho ho's than santa claus 
 I been electrocuted, it ain't do shit 
 Except ????-aca
