(Blaze) 
 Ever since back when I was alive 
 I always thought to myself what it would be like to die 
 Today I'm more dead than a doornail 
 Whether I succeed or fail, only time will tell 
 And if I ever fall short of the gold 
 I'll fall back on a nickel-plated chrome and take everything you own 
 I'm a pure-bred hustler, gang-bang affiliated 
 I pack a heater bitch, this ain't entertainment 
 If I fall only time will tell 
 And if I fall of out of control 
 My pockets is bound to swell 
 If I keep reppin the cheese, will they feel me? 
 You know you know it my nigga 
 That's treal best believe me 
 (Lavel) 
 The shadow, back up in you like a pap-smear 
 No I'm not a player, wearing sweaters made of cashmere 
 With matching boots 
 I came for the loot, I'm riding shotgun and bitch 
 I'm prepared to shoot 
 Duck low unless you want to get hit with the blast 
 I'll blow a motherfuckers hair in and out his baseball hat 
 And if I catch him hard grinding with some shit that's phat 
 I'm gonna lay him on his back, you bitches better believe that 
 If I fall only time will tell 
 And if I fall of out of control 
 My pockets is bound to swell 
 If I keep reppin the cheese, will they feel me? 
 You know you know it my nigga 
 That's treal best believe me 
 Fall down, if I fall, get back up again 
 I'm gonna get back up again, when will this ride be over 
 Did it begin, no more slipping 
 Yo' I had it up to here, 'cause I've had enough 
 This shit's all fucked up 
 When times get tough you need to pick yourself up, and brush off 
 (Blaze) 
 I'm not afraid to fall, I fell, got up 
 Kept moving while my body repeatedly got shot up 
 I even tried to stand up 
 After taking a the clip and a half from a bitch-ass rocking a ski mask 
 In a dark alleyway, I was killed on a Sunday night 
 Body recovered on a Monday 
 News covered the gunplay 
 The same dude that killed me 
 Dead body discovered in the subway 
 If I fall only time will tell 
 And if I fall of out of control 
 My pockets is bound to swell 
 If I keep reppin the cheese, will they feel me? 
 You know you know it my nigga 
 That's treal best believe me

 Madrox and I'm round like the earth 
 I done fell so many times, I'm accustomed to all the hurt 
 No work, and no jobs, and people are unemployed 
 Most of the people just filling the void 
 And I'm one of them 
 Just because I'm in front of them 
 Mean I'm ahead of the game 
 And when you clear away the shit, we basically all the same 
 All going against the grain and hope for some better days 
 In the meantime, we all just trying to mantain 
 If I fall only time will tell 
 And if I fall of out of control 
 My pockets is bound to swell 
 If I keep reppin the cheese, will they feel me? 
 You know you know it my nigga 
 That's treal best believe me
