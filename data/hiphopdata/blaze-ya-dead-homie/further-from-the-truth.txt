(Blaze) 
 My styles are Grundy, gritty and crusted with mold 
 My body is a shell, inside is a tortured soul 
 Waiting to grab a hold, of everything you that know 
 And casually throw it all right out the window 
 I return from the beyond again, with a shovel on my shoulder 
 And a photograph of him, from the dark, backwards 
 Counter-clockwards 
 A lot of the words that I said, they went unheard 
 Buried in the casket, tucked under the earth 
 For so long, with hopes that no one would get hurt 
 From this raging retard 
 Riddled with bullet holes, when you're different 
 That's how it goes 
 I understand, do you? 
 If you were in a situation, that's mine 
 You'd probably go on, pretending everything is fine 
 But that, phony feeling couldn't be further from truth 
 When your on your back, in a coffin, wearing a suit 
 When your on your back, in a coffin, wearing a suit 
 That phony feeling, couldn't be further from truth 
 Dirty like the earth, And young bitches that lift skirts 
 To pay college funds, or get they nails done 
 We all human, got to do, what we gotta to do 
 From flipping a couple birds, to turning a trick or two 
 Or slapping a trick or three, for imitating a G 
 Rapping in the mirror, while they bumping my LP 
 Imitation is flattery, that what they tell me 
 But you ain't thug, you can't sell me, nope 
 When your on your back, in a coffin, wearing a suit 
 That phony feeling, couldn't be further from truth 
 A beautiful bowl of spread with lilies and orchids 
 A mortician playing your song upon the organ 
 I'll smash in your casket in with a sledgehammer 
 At this point now the anger is all that really matters 
 Busted the clock, threw the numbers away in my dreams 
 So I'm haunted by new miracle messages, what do they mean? 
 Whatever it is, is probably wrong 
 There's a hole in my head, and thoughts do linger too long 
 And then I get branded as a walking mistake 
 And all I wanted was a piece of the cake, and some ice cream 
 Would a nice dream like a vacation from nightmares? 
 Speaking on deaf ears to people who don't really care 
 We throw it all away in garbage, bring it back 
 Clean it up after the commentary and serve us a track 
 What ever they want they gonna get, that's besides the point 
 Meanwhile many motherfuckers platinum off of club joints 
 And it's all fucked up right now 
 And it's all fucked up right now 
 And it's all fucked up right now 
 When your on your back in a coffin wearing a suit 
 When your on your back, in a coffin, wearing a suit 
 That phony feeling, couldn't be further from truth
