Life in the city, is out of control 
 (Stick ya hands up, Stick ya hands up) 
 Life in the city, is out of control 
 (Stick ya hands up, Stick ya hands up) 
 (Blaze) 
 I catch'em while they sleeping, always on point 
 Never fall off 
 Known as a black hearse, who came to haul your ass off 
 All your talking, need to stop 
 Before I get stupid, and then let the motherfuckin' gat pop 
 I got a rumor for you bitches, at the core 
 I strangle seven hoes, and I'm looking for a couple more 
 So if you get in my way, we got beef, and I'ma gut you like a fish, with my razor sharp teeth 
 I'm a pit-bull without a muzzle, held down by the Psychopathic family (Family!) 
 Checkmate motherfucker, this is Colton 
 Turn your body into dust where you standing 
 Darkness is my weapon, and caution is advised 
 I'll spit some shit 
 And draw the blood clear up out your eyes 
 Go on and stick your hands up, and empty your pockets 
 I'm leaving with our money, your rings, and your momma's life 
 Stick yo' hands up, this is a robbery 
 Stick yo' hands up, come up out your jewels and your money 
 Stick yo' hands up, you know that you done fucked up 'cause! 
 Stick yo' hands up, now you in the presence of a thug 
 Life in the city, is out of control 
 What you gonna do? Where you gonna go? How you gonna live? 
 Bloody bullet holes, should have stayed safe, in with yo' shit, and laid low 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 Raise'em up, let me see the blood rush 
 We only coming for the good shit, so give it up 
 Life's a obstacle, and the object is 
 To get with it or just get dealt with 
 So put them bitches sky-high, you think they care if you die 
 Fuck that tear in your eye (man why you crying) 
 I ain't playing, do you see my homie smiling? 
 Man, let me see the watch 
 Is this gold? Are these diamonds? (Cha-Ching) 
 Dawg, give me all your shit (Give it up) 
 And all rest of you, better sew them lips 
 Acting like I'm playing a game 
 Who wants to be the first victim, to reveal they brain 
 I suggest you keep them up, you heard what my homie said, bitch check nuts 
 Stick'em up, keep'em up, don't move 
 Cause you fucking with some killers for real (ooh) 
 Stick yo' hands up, this is a robbery 
 Stick yo' hands up, come up out your jewels and your money 
 Stick yo' hands up, you know that you done fucked up 'cause! 
 Stick yo' hands up, now you in the presence of a thug 
 Life in the city, is out of control 
 What you gonna do? Where you gonna go? How you gonna live? 
 Bloody bullet holes, should have stayed safe, in with yo' shit, and laid low 
 (Blaze) 
 Put your hands up, this is a motherfucking stick-up 
 Don't nobody move, or they gonna get they throat cut 
 I'm low on fetty, and I got to get paid 
 I want it all, so go on, and empty the safe 
 My homies in the lobby, hand on the 4-5 
 Don't even think about running, you move and you die 
 Wanna test me, no vest can protect thee 
 Am I lying ABK? 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 Man, I suggest we let them see 
 Put your backs to the wall, keep your hands where I can see'em (see'em) 
 You messed around and got caught up, best believe it (yep) 
 Back again, drive-bys, gunshot wounds 
 And if you ever doubt it, than you doomed 
 Death by us, cooperate 
 Smartness is the key factor, to give your life a whole new chapter (real) 
 Mister tough guys don't live long, 'cause I'm down to take them out with the chrome 
 You know what I mean? 
 Stick yo' hands up, this is a robbery 
 Stick yo' hands up, come up out your jewels and your money 
 Stick yo' hands up, you know that you done fucked up 'cause! 
 Stick yo' hands up, now you in the presence of a thug 
 Life in the city, is out of control 
 What you gonna do? Where you gonna go? How you gonna live? 
 Bloody bullet holes, should have stayed safe, in with yo' shit, and laid low
