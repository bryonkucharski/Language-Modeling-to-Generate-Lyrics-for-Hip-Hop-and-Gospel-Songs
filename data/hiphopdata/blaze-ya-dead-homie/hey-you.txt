"Hey!, Hey bitch! What the fuck?! You can't hear or something?! Hey look ho, you looking for a motherfucking thug?" 
 Hey you (Who me?)

 Hey bitch, do your momma know you outside 
 Hanging in the passenger window, of my hoo-ride 
 And I can barely see the ass, stacked off in the pants, and she talking real fast 
 The bitch kinda smelt like fish and chips 
 But boy did she have a set of dick sucking lips 
 Told her what she wanted to hear, so I could get all in her cat 
 Dead homie all up in her cat, now picture that

 All up in your face like a true thug 
 All in your shit, in my eyes you only worth what you come with
