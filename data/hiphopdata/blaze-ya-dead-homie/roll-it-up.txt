(Blaze) 
 I'm in the car, to the door, in the bar, to the dance floor 
 Lookin' for the ladies, with the wiggle real low 
 I see you movin' like a snake, rhythm huggin' your curves 
 Shakin, like ain't nobody shakin' better than her 
 House is packed, we're moving from front to back 
 Took my seat in VIP, and ordered a Cognac 
 Pull out my product sack, and commenced the break down 
 Here baby, you puff? grab up a seat and sit down 
 We gon' roll it up, come on girl 
 Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up) 
 You know that I came to get right (turn it up) 
 And the party don't stop till sunlight 
 Four blunts later, and two and a half bottles of Don P 
 Followed by four shots of whiskey, had me tipsy 
 But I still had game 
 And thoughts are still running up in ol' girl's frame 
 Now I don't pimp skirts, I lift skirts 
 And then serve, my dang-dang and beat it up until your 'nanny hurts 
 What do you say we leave this place, and get a bit to eat 
 And maybe after that I can toss you up, in the backseat 
 We gon' roll it up, come on girl 
 Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up) 
 You know that I came to get right (turn it up) 
 And the party don't stop till sunlight 
 Back in the car, now we on the road 
 Is when she acting all freaky, out of control 
 Said the way she worked up in the club, that wasn't shit 
 And I should see her when she butt naked, working the dick 
 Ain't no point, just imagining 
 I'm headed to the Quality Inn, to get some quality skins, from this trick 
 She put it on me, then straight fucked me to death 
 But ain't no stopping a player when there's still a blunt left 
 (Chorus repeat until end) 
 We gon' roll it up, come on girl 
 Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up) 
 You know that I came to get right (turn it up) 
 And the party don't stop till sunlight
