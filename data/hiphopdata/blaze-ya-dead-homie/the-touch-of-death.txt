The touch of death is coming, there's nowhere to escape 
 Your life is slowly fading into your hollow grave 
 You can not be saved 
 You can not be saved 
 (Blaze) 
 There was once a man that couldn't die 
 In fact to this day that man is still alive 
 He lives in the cosmos on the edge of time 
 Little kids have heard of him, in nursery rhymes (he's the dead) 
 But he walks among society carrying a sickle and a shotgun 
 With a touch of death, and death's hands 
 He's a young, dying, unstoppable, dead man, you'll know 
 The touch of death is coming 
 You'll know 
 There's nowhere to escape 
 You'll know 
 Your life is slowly fading 
 You'll know 
 Into your hollow grave 
 You'll know 
 You can not be saved 
 You can not be saved 
 When death is upon us, come with me right now, and don't be afraid 
 I've been alive for many centuries 
 Watched new kings replace old kings 
 Seen empires overthrown with war 
 Disease and sickness, for rich or poor 
 Armies form and prepare to fight 
 Damn what a battle it lasted twenty nights 
 19 days, 12 B.C. to think nobody ever heard of me 
 I'm in the afterlife that's where I grew 
 Watched a whole lot on a thang or two 
 Come to find out their afraid of you 
 If you don't die exactly the way they do 
 They knew I wasn't right from the start 
 With jet-black blood to match my black heart 
 Found out quick that the world was cold 
 'Fore anyone even had a soul, understand 
 The touch of death is coming, understand 
 There's nowhere to escape, understand 
 Your life is slowly fading, understand 
 Into your hollow grave, understand 
 You can not be saved 
 You can not be saved 
 When death is upon us, come with me right now, and don't be afraid 
 Colton Grundy past life experience 
 Different time my friend, delirious 
 All of those memories just blur together 
 So understand sometimes I don't know no better 
 But I'm kcab (back) 
 But I really ain't go nowhere 
 I sit here surrounded in dark countin' dead 
 Looking for someone to give this pain too 
 Looking for someone to feel the way that I do, like me 
 The touch of death is coming 
 Like me 
 There's nowhere to escape 
 Like me 
 Your life is slowly fading 
 Like me 
 Into your hollow grave 
 Like me 
 You can not be saved 
 You can not be saved 
 When death is upon us come with me right now and don't be afraid 
 Hey man! He done fucked yo' ride up!
