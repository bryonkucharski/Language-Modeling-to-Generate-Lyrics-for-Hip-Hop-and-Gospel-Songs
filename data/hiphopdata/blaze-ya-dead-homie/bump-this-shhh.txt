(Blaze) 
 Everybody got a song that they want you to hear 
 Spittin' overload of emotion just to get in your ear 
 Before I listen, you already know what you like 
 You don't be falling for the flavor of the mainstream hype 
 He's back, and I don't want your promo tape 
 And even if it's shrink wrapped, homeboy I'm straight 
 I'm on my own, a choosy motherfucker myself 
 And I don't settle for the first record to fall off the shelf 
 So don't tell me what to listen to, or tell me what to like 
 Don't tell me that it's banging off the hook and hella tight 
 Your opinion matters to you (come again?) 
 Your opinion matters to you (okay) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you're at wit's end and you still don't give a fuck 'cause you love it 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you got fired on your job, on your day off, what the fuck? 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you're stuck in a traffic jam, bumper to bumper, for 3 hours 
 Bump this shit right here 
 Cause you found out your love, was loving somebody besides you 
 I don't want your money, I just want your mind and your ear 
 You don't want to hear my shit well bitch it's fine, give it here 
 Fuck up out my face, let the music bump 
 All playa haters shut the fuck up 
 We ain't even got through the intro and someone pissed 
 Cause this shit don't sound quite exactly how they expected it 
 Open up your closed mind and you might see 
 'Cause you care about the music if it set ya soul free 
 Don't tell me what to listen to, don't tell me what to like 
 Don't tell me that it's banging off the hook and hella tight 
 Your opinion matters to you (come again?) 
 Your opinion matters to you (okay) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you're at wit's end and you still don't give a fuck 'cause you love it 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you got fired on your job, on your day off, what the fuck? 
 Bump this shit right here 
 When you're stuck in a traffic jam, bumper to bumper, for 3 hours 
 Bump this shit right here 
 Cause you found out your love, was loving somebody besides you 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Turn it up y'all) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Till your windows crack) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Let me see you jump) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Up with the bump, bump) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Turn it up y'all) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Let me hear the bass bump) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Turn it up y'all) 
 Bump this shit right here 
 (Till you're dead and you ain't got no air left in ya lung)
