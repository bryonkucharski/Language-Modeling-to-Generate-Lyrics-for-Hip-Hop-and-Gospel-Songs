(Blaze) 
 Allow me to introduce myself 
 I'm Colton Grundy, in effect bitch 
 No need to excuse yourself 
 A little strange, and yeah, I'm kind of a horrible sight 
 But I milk your bitches titties, like a milk this mic 
 When I get right, ain't nobody getting shit 
 'Cause I'm gonna get so right, ain't gonna be nothing left to get 
 Out cold, but I got the balance, with even heat 
 'Cause if my talents don't provide, I got a gat under the seat (and that's real) 
 Too raw for some of y'all to feel 
 But that's just life, shuffle the cards and deal 
 And the wheels'll keep spinnin' 
 Ho's keep catching too many feelin's 
 And too many men are turning into women 
 That the world that we live in 
 The world that I sit and spit in 
 And squeeze my ass where I can fit in, so just listen 
 Because I would never waste your time 
 But if you lend me your ear, then I promise to blow you're mind 
 I'm out the gate (Busted wide open) 
 Lay your money down (Put your drink on that ice) 
 Put some volume on that sound 
 Out the gate, make no mistake, the chain is severed 
 And the link's the only thing that's been holding me together 
 I'm out the gate (Busted wide open) 
 Lay your money down (put your drink on that ice) 
 Put some volume on that sound 
 (If you ain't come to party) 
 Show that ass to the door 
 (Man if you ain't come to party) 
 Then what the hell you here for 
 Better not be drama, I hate acting tight 
 Cut that ass like a director, and edit you like a re-write 
 Ain't nobody playing, filleting ya like a fish 
 So mind your own, and go attend to your drink, and your bitch 
 'Cause it's Sid the DJ, is spinning right here 
 In him seven, eight bottles of beers, inside the Everclear 
 Got me feeling far from friendly 
 Like you trying to push emotion on me 
 Becoming your new found enemy (better let it be) 
 I came to drink and ball (you're upsetting me) 
 Talking shit under your breath, little boy 
 I don't like bitches, or dudes that imitate 'em 
 So quit acting like a female, and speak up player 
 (Break x2) 
 So what you wanna do, and why you looking at me? 
 So many girls in the house, with fine asses and titties 
 Let me see you shake that ass, and break a hip for me (Come on) 
 Let me see you shake that ass, and break a hip for me (Yeah) 
 I'm out the gate (Busted wide open) 
 Lay your money down (Put your drink on that ice) 
 Put some volume on that sound 
 Out the gate make no mistake, the chain is severed 
 And the link's the only thing that's been holding me together 
 I'm out the gate (Busted wide open) 
 Lay your money down (Put your drink on that ice) 
 Put some volume on that sound 
 (If you ain't come to party) 
 Show that ass to the door 
 (Man if you ain't come to party) 
 Then what the hell you here for? 
 They call me Grim fresh, I'm like the cream of the crop 
 The shit that starts on the bottom and just rise to the top 
 Too many of y'all sound the same 
 While my style is infinity and uncapable to restrain 
 Off the chain and a short leash 
 Serving you salty on the biscuit and a two piece (soaked in chicken grease) 
 What it is, what it will be 
 You bark like a big dog, but we'll see 
 How many puppy bites, it takes to break skin 
 Well man, I'll break bread 
 While other rappers let go to their head, and wind up dead in a nightclub somewhere 
 Anywhere, ain't nothin' but thugs in here 
 I'm out the gate (Busted wide open) 
 Lay your money down (Put your drink on that ice) 
 Put some volume on that sound 
 (If you ain't come to party) 
 Show that ass to the door 
 (Man if you ain't come to party) 
 Then what the hell you here for? 
 Let me see you shake that ass, and break a hip for me (Come on) 
 Let me see you shake that ass, and break a hip for me (Yeah) 
 (Repeat until end) 
 Yeah
