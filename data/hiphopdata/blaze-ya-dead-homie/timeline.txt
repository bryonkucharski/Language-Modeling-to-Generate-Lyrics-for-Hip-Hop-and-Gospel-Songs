(Blaze) 
 Solomon was the father, the casketmaker 
 In 1920 something, he was the undertaker 
 Who outlived everyone until the day he tried to die 
 And jumped in the freezing water so starts the timeline 
 1980 something one summer evening 
 Come out that same water he came ah-creeping 
 Wtih tattered clothes soaking wet from head to toe 
 Where he happened he had not know, no boots 
 Solomon was lost and confused in different times 
 He knew he didn't belong he could see it in her eyes 
 So he fled in the alleyway like the homeless 
 Cause at this point in time his life was hopeless 
 Killing himself didn't work a bit 
 He only woke up 60 years in the future, revived his shit 
 Alive was dead still waiting to become the transformation into Blaze's son 
 I keep changing feeling strange and watch as 
 I metamorphosize, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline 
 Ticking in the 
 He is the father and I am the son 
 And together we become the great undying one, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline

 Blaze the son, was a gangsta work 
 He live by the gun, and died over trying to sell one 
 To a baby G, from a set around the way 
 Things are way different now, from way back in the days 
 Solomon would have never sold a piece 
 He'd only build a couple caskets 
 The house, alter the season 
 Blaze on the other hand, loved killing everything 
 And then what he took, to get his hands on some money man 
 From selling crack rocks, on street blocks 
 Hood famous as a dead thug 
 Always rocking a clock 
 Following numbers up the clock, making doorways 
 So anyone who would oppose, would die and just go away 
 He never died, no his wounds never healed 
 Never stopped to think, how shitty that got to feel 
 But it's okay, 'cause he's changing again 
 To fulfill the destiny, of Colton Grundy's brethren 
 I keep changing feeling strange and watch as 
 I metamorphosize, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline 
 Ticking in the 
 He is the father and I am the son 
 And together we become the great undying one, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline

 Colton is the great one, never will he perish 
 He's not concerned with the life, that so many cherish 
 Not concerned with looking for love, that they claim that is 
 He's heartless, he dead, he's proud, he's not embarrassed 
 Move back, no time, the clock is broke 
 Never had parents, he was conceived in smoke 
 Father was just a premonition of a past life 
 Or the life he never stopped living 
 His story began right, it didn't 
 Still confused and I don't get it 
 He is I, and I am him, I never had descendants 
 I never had any father, and I am like my brother 
 To sum it all up, we're all the same motherfucka 
 I keep changing feeling strange and watch as 
 I metamorphosize, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline 
 Ticking in the 
 He is the father and I am the son 
 And together we become the great undying one, well 
 Time keeps ticking in the Timeline 
 Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
