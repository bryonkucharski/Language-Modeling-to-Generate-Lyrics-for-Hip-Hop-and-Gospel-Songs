2 many bitches wanna see this thug

 Bitches call me daddy (Hey dad!) 
 They like the way a muh'fucka creep 
 Through the hood in a caddy 
 I'm a mack in my own right, like Cube said 
 Getting my dick sucked in a alleyway, by a chickenhead 
 I don't love that hoe, and I ain't handcuffing 
 Too many bitches, and they turkies needed stuffing 
 Like this bitch the other day, begging me to drive over 
 And beat it up properly 
 I'm like a young Wilt, still in his prime 
 Cause there's oh so many bitches 
 And there's oh so little time 
 They all want a piece of the dead, and they can't have it 
 Still a little picky, on which hoes that I'm stabbing 
 So if I serve dick to you, you've been blessed 
 Now go home and brag about the shit to your friends (uh oh!) 
 That's the way it goes I suppose 
 Got to hit the store, for some more rubbers 
 For these hoe's 
 2 many bitches

 When it comes to them bitches, I know a few 
 Sack chasing, blood sucking leeches with boobs 
 Ready to set it off, I keep 'em blind and lost 
 And if they getting lippy, they getting tossed 
 Just for frontin' 
 There's too many hoes actin' like some bitches 
 Not a lick of woman in them, so they get vicious 
 Calm me down, hold me back 
 Light the blunt, and let me hit it 
 Before this 'rat get smacked 
 It's like me and Grundy, can spot a chicken coming 
 Bobbling her head, ready to gobble dick or something 
 Putin' up with hoodrats for years 
 Because the streets of the D, are just oh so clear 
 But I keep on riding, say what's up 
 I'm a sucka for some titties, and a fine ass butt 
 It's the life of a killer, true tales with no glitches 
 Too much game, brings 2 many bitches for real

 My calendar's filled 
 Hoe's making appointments to get it drilled 
 Met a chick with a phat ass, couldn't wait to get in that (Who?) 
 She said her name was Karen 
 And she didn't mind sharing time 
 She stayed off I-94 and Outer Drive 
 I'm on my way to see Carol from Grandview 
 Guess I could stop through, and beat it up for a few 
 Creep in through her doorway, and told her to drop them britches 
 You ain't the only one, I got 2 many bitches (hooty hoo) 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 Hey bitch where your girls at? 
 Tell them grab they shit, and meet me in the back 
 I'm about to put them in a new situation 
 Life of luxury, you, your girls and me 
 I'm so glad that you took the opportunity 
 To come to the underground 
 And open up yourself to me 
 But there's so many others out there just like you 
 So I'm off to the next 'cause we through 
 Thanks again!
