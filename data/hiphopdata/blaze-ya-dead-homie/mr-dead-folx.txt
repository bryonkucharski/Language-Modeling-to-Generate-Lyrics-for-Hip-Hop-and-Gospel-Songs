No questions for you too ask, no gats for you to blast 
 No money, weed, no cash 
 It's time to get in that ass 
 Mr. Dead Folx, Colton Grundy Ya Dead Homie 
 Don't be acting like you don't see me 
 Believe me man you don't know me 
 (Blaze) 
 I was the first to put it down 
 Reppin' with Twiztid and the clowns kicking the gangsta sounds 
 Strictly keep it underground 
 Lotus in the family, you now how we do 
 Coming for ours and won't hesitate to ride on you 
 Record sales don't make you bulletproof 
 Big time, and we both know you don't be doing that shit that's in your rhymes 
 You ain't a G like me, you ain't the thug I be 
 You watered down, like the punks I see on MTV 
 Where you're motherfucking trees, always asking for smoke 
 Ain't it a bitch, everybody a G when wearing Loc's 
 That's a figure of speech, and I be sick in the heat 
 Whoever think he the shit, trying to claim my territory 
 I'm a motherfucking G with heaters loaded and cocked 
 You's a small time pee-on, braggin of running rocks 
 Bitch break yourself, for everything and then some 
 Hold the mic to my dick, so you can hear me when I cum 
 No questions for you too ask, no gats for you to blast 
 No money, weed, no cash 
 It's time to get in that ass 
 Mr. Dead Folx, Colton Grundy Ya Dead Homie 
 Don't be acting like you don't see me 
 Believe me man you don't know me 
 Never ever was I a bitch hoe 
 You can put that on my ten-fold 
 Ma pop Grundy and them know I sicko 
 Baby boy got banana clips for his chopper 
 Known to bring drama somethin' proper 
 Check nuts 
 Colton Grundy got handles, I got the J 
 So when I'm spiting from the big oh line, nuts' in your face 
 Dead homie on a ho-port, smoking a Newport 
 Spiting at the bitches, and bumping that new Too Short 
 Life is nothing I can even they to relate to, for real though 
 Being dead is serious, it change you 
 All I got left in this world, is my music to play 
 So you correct if you thinkin', that I'ma do my thang 
 And all the thugs that wit me, throw your shit in the air 
 And wave those motherfuckers side to side 
 Like you don't care 
 And if you feeling like I'm feeling, then it's plainy clear 
 'Cause it's a whole bunch of dead folk chilling in here 
 No questions for you too ask, no gats for you to blast 
 No money, weed, no cash 
 It's time to get in that ass 
 Mr. Dead Folx, Colton Grundy Ya Dead Homie 
 Don't be acting like you don't see me 
 Believe me man you don't know me 
 (Violent J) 
 It's me and Blaze, drunk driving in an 87 Cutlass 
 Taking turns at the wheel while the other claps motherfuckers 
 You're chick, I'm dicking that 
 Wicked shit, I'm kicking that 
 I'm hitting with the quickness, life's stinking, where the chickens at? 
 You made a wrong turn coming down my block 
 I'll stop your car like I need help, and crack your head with a rock 
 Uh, Colton Grundy the only homie I got 
 Mr. Dead Folx sparking at the burial spot 
 We about to ride on the world, leave it deserted like Marz 
 Get your wig spilt, by 40 juggalo rap stars 
 A little kid asked me if I ever killed anybody (yes) 
 I told 'em that I did and was warm and bloody 
 I'm Violent J, I'll be around until my dieng day 
 On tour smoking bud, and eating Flying J 
 Look me up under 'Juggla' and you'll find my name 
 And if you don't, then you're dictionary's lame motherfucka! 
 No questions for you too ask, no gats for you to blast 
 No money, weed, no cash 
 It's time to get in that ass 
 Mr. Dead Folx, Colton Grundy Ya Dead Homie 
 Don't be acting like you don't see me 
 Believe me man you don't know me 
 (Repeat Till End) 
 Mr Dead Folx 
 Believe me man you don't know me
