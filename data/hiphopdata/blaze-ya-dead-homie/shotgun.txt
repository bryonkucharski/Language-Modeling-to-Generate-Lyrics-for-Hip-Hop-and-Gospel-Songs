Err'ybody get your 
 Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off 
 Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off 
 Me I be a G from way back in the day 
 With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality 
 (Blaze) 
 I'll shoot you in the day, like my heater stay on toast 
 And Grundy build a casket for you as soon as you a ghost 
 I got an itchy trigger finger and I'm scratching like a DJ 
 15 shells in my pocket, who wanna see me 
 Khakis stay on fold, brew ice-cold 
 And my homeboy rapping to a chicken that he know 
 Here come a car up the street, rolling real slow 
 With a wannabe, baby G, hanging out the window 
 Looking close, like he knows me 
 Fuck set!, Buck shots splattered his ass all over his homies upholstery 
 Trying to play me closely, but my approach be 
 Buck'em all till they fall with my shotgun 
 Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off 
 Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off 
 Me I be a G from way back in the day 
 With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 If I keep my self alive, something just might happen 
 Like my gun clapping, or a motherfucker's head crackin' 
 My nerves are shot, I'm sweaty and hot 
 Always shaking, looking just like Michael J. Fox 
 Save me, help me take me out this mind frame 
 Without the choppin' on you hoes 'cause I'm insane 
 Me and Colton be getting Grundy in the hood 
 Knocking down your doorway, jacking all your goods 
 Look into the barrel of my shotgun, watch yourself 
 Fucking wit me, is just bad for your health 
 So when you see me coming, best be thinking whether you want to live or die 
 Cause my anger's increasing, so watch out 
 'Cause we ain't playing pimp, move the fuck over 
 All up our face, acting like we know ya 
 But if you really want to get that close 
 Then prepare yourself, to be filled with holes 
 Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off 
 Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off 
 Me I be a G from way back in the day 
 With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality 
 (Esham) 
 Sawed off shotgun and I'm about to dump 
 Sippin' on some syrup, speakers on bump 
 Cruising down 7 mile, cash bed of pile 
 You think my shotgun won't blast, bat a thou 
 I'm all cheddar style; throw your body off Bell Isle Bridge 
 Don't push me cause, I'm over the edge 
 Been fell off the ledge, with a hole in my head 
 Only reason Colton Grundy see me 'cause he been dead 
 Boy I'm nothing to play with; my shotgun murdered 9 federal agents 
 I kill them all ages 
 Bloodstain the front pages 
 This shit is outrageous 
 Me, Blaze, and ABK need to be locked in cages 
 Police been after me, I cause a catastrophe 
 All because my shotgun said Blasphemy 
 Now another shotgun casualty 
 Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off 
 Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off 
 Me I be a G from way back in the day 
 With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality 
 (Blaze) 
 4 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman 
 Three more people wanna test me 
 3 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman 
 Two more people wanna test me 
 2 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman 
 One more person wanna test me 
 1 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman 
 Don't nobody wanna test me 
 "Damn! Fuck! I ran outta muthafuckin ammo, unless you count the box of shells I got in the glove compartment!"
