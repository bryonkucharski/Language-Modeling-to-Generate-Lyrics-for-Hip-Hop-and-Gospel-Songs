 "Look the history lessons over motherfuckas 
 You still to learn one thing tho 
 Man life is a ladder, keep climbing that motherfucker 
 Even if there's like 52 thousand rungs 
 Man don't ever hesitate to get whatever it takes to get the motherfucking job done" 
 (Blaze) 
 There is one patch made of gravel and cobblestone 
 Filled with paying dues and laced with potholes 
 I'll never quit 
 Shit, I'll think I'll pull off to the side 
 With one foot in the game, and the other on the grind 
 Now my mind's been compared to a darkly lit alleyway 
 With too many rats and that bitch for you to tally 
 Now I'm moving on up 
 It's my timing, coming up short 
 Not for long, I'm steady climbin' 
 (Esham) 
 Climbin', rhymin' with the undying 
 Filthy, never shining 
 Always grinding, I made it three feet 
 And I got three feet to go 
 Cause been six feet under from a long time ago 
 Me and Colton Grundy, bloody money 
 Now I climb from the cemetery dirt under me 
 From dust till dawn, when the sun be shining 
 You'll see my hand come from underground 
 'Cause I'm climbing 
 I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top 
 Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop 
 And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more 
 I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop 
 (Monoxide Child) 
 It's a constant battle, for me to get to the top 
 But when the ball drops, I'm going bring the world to a stop 
 I'm a man on a mission 
 Wishing everybody would just get up off me 
 Maybe then I could breath 
 I'm on my knees again 
 Waiting for my chance to get away 
 Hoping I'll be up there one day 
 I'll never stop trying to climb, so ride my vine 
 And let me reach for mine 
 And in time 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 Hand over hand we climb, play the beat, and we rhyme 
 See us on stage, throwing the fuck you sign 
 The game is like a chain link fence 
 So I'm scaling that bitch with catlike reflexes 
 So I'm saying that, if you ain't got no grip 
 You need to find some two-way tape and get sticky with it 
 Cause our shit is like magnets the way that it attracts 
 They must be something that keeps it coming back 
 'Cause we're the shit 
 I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top 
 Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop 
 And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more 
 I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop 
 I'm gonna keep climbing y'all (climbing y'all) 
 Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring) 
 Blood's gonna keep flying y'all (flying y'all) 
 (Violent J) 
 I get bloody if I have to, pillage and stab you 
 Leave ya shredded 
 Like a pack of polar bears done had you 
 I don't give a shit, who has to die for me to fly 
 Slice your legs off under your kness, and float by 
 I'm who everybody hates, so I'm leaving the stakes 
 And I'm passing through dimensions 
 On through the pearly gates 
 I'm from beyond the sun, I come to bomb you some 
 And I'm the one to get the goddamn job done 
 (Blaze) 
 My socks are moving, ain't worried what others doing 
 Make my own path to the top, and it won't stop 
 I'm a grown man doing what a grown man does 
 Taking all you suckas back to school, so pack a lunch 
 I'm like a scholar, with knowledge too real to collar 
 Working on my next shit before I count a dollar 
 'Cause when you made it there you don't let go 
 And don't look down until you're in the ear of everyone in town 
 I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top 
 Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop 
 And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more 
 I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop 
 (Repeat until end) 
 I'm gonna keep climbing y'all (climbing y'all) 
 Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring) 
 Blood's gonna keep flying y'all (flying y'all) 
 I'm gonna keep climbing y'all (climbing y'all) 
 I'm gonna keep climbing y'all (climbing y'all) 
 Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring) 
 Blood's gonna keep flying y'all (flying y'all) 
 (At 7:30) 
 "Yeah! Damn, y'all still here?...Fuck outta here!
