[Verse One] [Bun B]: 
 They say the meek shall inherit the Earth 
 Well I'mma fuck Meek daughter 
 Marry her than kill Meek's father 
 Once his ass die and she inherit the shit 
 Man I'mma cock back the heat and straight bury this bitch 
 Bun B, carnivore, a predator 
 Wanna war get your metal up 
 I'm the victor, niggas settle up 
 Next up, bring me another competitor 
 Set him up and I'mma shut it down, bet it up 
 Straight fact, cock the eight back and wet him up 
 Shit feels so good I just might get a nut 
 No homo 
 Kill his ass for free and call it promo 
 Yo ass I'mma do you for the low low 
 Pull out the fo-fo 
 The bullet flies so fast 
 But when it hits yo' ass, you gon' die so slow 
 It'll seem like an eternity, but it was a flash 
 And then it was over and that was your ass 
 [Hook] [Bun B]: 
 We them, bad things that go bump in the night 
 And we them, boogiemen that have you jumping with fright 
 So when we come out of the shadows and black your eye 
 You better, cross your heart and hope to die 
 Cause you can 
 Talk the talk, but tell no lie 
 And you can walk the walk, just walk on by 
 'Cause we are killers by nature and that's no lie 
 You better, cross your heart and hope to die 
 [Verse Two] [Chino XL]: 
 This is the crown jewel of my symphony of an animal 
 I jump out the shadows and ravel when God is mad at you 
 I promise you, my imbalance is chemical 
 You know how many prescriptions get ran through like Karen Steffans genitals 
 Anticipating your death 
 The left side of my brain ain't thinking right 
 And in the right side there is nothing left 
 Last breath struggle 
 I think outside the box to put you inside of a box like a crossword puzzle 
 .380 with the muzzle 
 Be afraid like I'm Haiti trouble 
 Never half hustle, shoot Russel in the calf muscle 
 I'm the reason for your homies disappearances 
 But keep that off the record like songs with no sample clearances 
 All that fearless shit perishes when I'm striking 
 These niggas is so over the hill it's like they hiking 
 Hide your baby's mama 
 You don't want no drama 
 Chino got more Llamas than a middle eastern farmer 
 Damage yukata, leaving your body eviscerated 
 Committed acts ungodly, worser than you anticipated 
 No take no prisoners, nigga we just don't want 'em 
 We murder every soldier that they send until they stop coming 
 [Hook] [Bun B]: 
 We them, bad things that go bump in the night 
 And we them, boogiemen that have you jumping with fright 
 So when we come out of the shadows and black your eye 
 You better, cross your heart and hope to die 
 Cause you can 
 Talk the talk, but tell no lie 
 And you can walk the walk, just walk on by 
 'Cause we are killers by nature and that's no lie 
 You better, cross your heart and hope to die
