I know I can be 
 A little hard to deal with so I stay 
 High as I can be 
 To get through the day without screaming 
 I know I can be 
 A little hard to deal with so I stay 
 High as I can be 
 To get through the day without screaming 
 They call me Lyrical Jesus but don't make me get evil 
 If I put my hands on you it won't be to heal you 
 Sometimes I'm hoping that this life is just a bad dream 
 'Cause I don't seen things that make a dead nigga scream 
 "Where you been at?" 
 I'm questioned by my peers 
 But even Shakespeare disappeared for seven years 
 Then returned with the greatest work that a playwright ever did 
 So counting Chino out really is not a bright idea 
 Manuel Barbosa, meet your son 
 I'm half Chalino Sanchez, half Big Pun 
 And as a shorty they would call me Chino Action 
 Was 10 years old at Def Jam trying to battle Run 
 11 years old in a juvenile cell 
 Lyrically already, you couldn't tell me I wasn't LL 
 I never failed I'm still a hell of a writing machine 
 Chino raises stakes like Van Helsing 
 I'm like the pope, kiss the ring 
 How can I be anything else with so many tendencies of a king? 
 I'm like a veteran from Vietnam 
 My mind's numb, at time my grind shock you like electricians with sweaty palms 
 I met Gil Scott Heron on a long flight 
 He said, "Brother, you the type to make writers want to go and write." 
 How can I leave something I do so well? 
 I'm tired, my eyes glowing red like jewels from Hell 
 The hotels, sleepless night, the need for rifle power 
 More parasites than you can see from top of Eiffel Tower 
 They say my ego put me out of history 
 I'm so conceited I'm jealous when people envy me 
 I ain't scared to die, I'm very moody 
 Everybody gotta go sometime like jury duty 
 But why try me? 
 Even with all them Chinese, kata's who try to master you can't tie Chi 
 No 
 Yo, you know Chino from the Wake Up Show 
 The records, I Told you So 
 And Poison Pen and classic Here To Save You All 
 You ain't even a factor 
 So matter of fact I'mma mow your block down like I drive a John Deere tractor 
 Haters feel the threat 
 Cause the muscularity of Chino and an action figure are anatomically correct 
 Everybody likes to rattle a lion's cage 
 But no one wants to go in alone when his razors are displayed 
 Afraid of long scars, dim witted as Chumlee on Pawn Stars 
 Still special like 50 Tyson's report card 
 All this Vicodin, Jack Daniels and valiums 
 'Bout it blow them promos up, it's time to drop these albums 
 If I don't make it and I'm decomposing in a box 
 My influence lives on 
 I just won't be there to watch 
 Say, "He was the illest when he picked up that pen." 
 And judge me by my enemies as well as my friends 
 Gone
