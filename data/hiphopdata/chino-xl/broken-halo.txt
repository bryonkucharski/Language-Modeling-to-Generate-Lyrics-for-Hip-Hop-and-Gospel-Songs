That's me, that's me 
 The kid with the broken halo 
 That's me, that's me 
 The devil won't seem to let me go 
 It's true the letters that they sent from school to my mother 
 Chino's too wild and does not play well with others 
 Rappers blinded and brainwash and need to be reminded 
 The Puerto Rican superhero no assembly required 
 Dark and agnostic, I torture you targeting my shit 
 Bastard be careful, like a nigga with glasses in a mosh pit 
 I flow free, spit religiously with each breath 
 With more lines than there are in Kimora Lee's neck 
 I'm sick with a pencil, he's done 
 But fuck sticking a fork in him, stab him with every kitchen utensil I can find 
 The brutalist, underpunched tutelage, proving it's in my jeans like true relig 
 The odds are slim to none that you can live 
 You don't want to be me is not convincing 
 It'll be cool to be you, just to witness my beauty in three diminsions 
 Necessary, vengeance, losing my religion 
 Only five words that are worse for me to hear is 
 "Babe, I think I'm pregnant." 
 It's really nothing to murder cowards with a crowbar 
 And have them scared to leave the house for fear of death like Solar 
 I take credit for a ton of police, it's Chino's fault 
 Then carve my name in your face and fill the wounds up with table salt 
 The mission, infiltrate the system with or without guns 
 And choke you till your lungs have no air like kings with no sons 
 The world told me, "Go to Hell", all right I'll meet you there 
 Latino's don't cheat death, we defeat it fair and square 
 Tearing your faggott ass in half and laugh and try to diss me 
 You ain't worth the urine particles existing in my piss stream 
 Since the cradle a word angel with a broken halo 
 "Chino XL" 
 They say that fake's the new real 
 I'll chop them up in suitcases, let the familiy pick one like it's Deal Or No Deal 
 They try to get at me, bitter the kid out spit they bosses 
 I'll have the studio literally littered with rapper's corpses 
 Bringer of death, barbarian will impale 
 If God was a rapper than He'd be Chino XL 
 Stuck up, snotty, known to body rappers biblically 
 Leave 'em like Sampson with his eyes gouged out by the Phiilistines 
 Of my own style, I'm the father, Maury Povich 
 Chino's so tight in the booth, I'm feeling clausterphobic 
 Free of the corporate theater, my heater is coming soon 
 If I attack you on stage you will not make it to your dressing room 
 They call me brutal 'cause I don't think a cop should shoot you 
 Then get away with it, we shouldn't have it, come on, be truthful 
 My homie tried to get a grant to go to school 
 All he was granted was Fox News views of Oscar Grant in his tomb 
 Guerilla monsoon with a blow torch 
 You can't hold a candle 
 Y'all ain't no vandals wearing skinny jeans and Croc sandels 
 My art canvas will start panics 
 Will heartlessly go to the Bronx Zoo bear handed to tear apart Pandas 
 I wanna scalp these traitors and bring out my native thoughts 
 Cause revolution has never been a spectator sport 
 Chino, the muscle fill will lay you down right in a tomb 
 There will be nowhere on your body that doesn't have a wound 
 I write like someone's life inside of a cartoon 
 The fiendish, human Venus Flytrap of raps is in full bloom 
 Heaven's on the payroll even with my broken halo
