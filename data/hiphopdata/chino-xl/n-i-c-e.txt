Now it's Chino everything... 
 For the next 3 minutes plus you gotta 
 Admit when I'm rhyming it's nice your heart is my piñata 
 My word play will astound 
 I make your mom say wow ironically wow is the word mom upside down 
 Trying to separate myself from my bizarre persona like a rabid cadaver trying to stab his own organ donor 
 I walked a kilometer tried to be calm and not empty this liquid Molotov lava shot into your Yamaka 
 Pardon my LAVA algorithm stab a married coward laugh and Brandan Childress slap his wisdom this isn't sadomasochism 
 It's a crass addiction and dastardly diction 
 Have you tap out of submission 
 A beast like Batista the Puerto Rican edition 
 The script phenomenon 
 With The Smith Corona typewriter the unabomber Ted Kaczynski wrote his manifesto on 
 America better invest in its urban environment or get demolished like them London riots 
 I'm pissing on Arizona immigration laws outside of my vehicle 
 With Casey Anthony's severed head hanging from my rear view 
 I'm outta my mind that ancient from the cellar evil 
 Being blind even Helen Keller's favorite color was Chino... I'm N.I.C.E 
 Now it's Chino everything 
 I use a verse as a murder weapon word shredding 
 Sometimes living in hell's giving the best view of heaven 
 Come witness my venomous threat Chino is deaths' pet 
 Born without a heart created straight from Satans' chemistry set 
 Will I ever be out shined? still remains to be seen 
 Till I'm in a museum with a sign remains to be seen 
 You watching a man that's standing at the crossroads not a poor soul who's flow is softer than them Glee episodes [Fuck Outta Here] 
 You'd think I'm starving how hard I'm charging the scenery beautifully how you figure that the Garden of Eden would be... OK 
 Problem with a nigga I say it to they face 
 Fuck steps to perfection I am a staircase 
 Pull Bill O'Reilly's spine out 
 You figure I'm a overdose before you even get official word, Amy Winehouse 
 Mind of weaponry from the times of the Byzantines you talking metaphysically but Chino's metal physically 
 The epitome of infinity and validity of my divinity half animal activity only monster in captivity legitimately resurrect any gladiator from Sicily he won't pattern or manage to match my intensity mentally, I'm N.I.C.E 
 Now it's Chino everything 
 You could be this nice in your next life or something 
 Just die and follow the light that's white like that Oslo Gunman 
 You rhyme like a woman that's got whore ways 
 Laughter's the best medicine so your records then should cure AIDS 
 To quote my mom I'm a thick skinned son of a bitch I'd walk through rose bushes for the thorns whenever I itched 
 Was captured and branded 
 And vanquished in an ancient anguish 
 I faced embraced evasive hatred and made it my based language 
 The horror carver the angry phantasma spittin' sangre en tu cara leave your head sliced on a silver platter 
 Manana manyaca I caca on you favorite flaca rapper 
 Sick laughter witch crafter 
 This bastard is mastered 
 Six pastors took masses to access 
 The madness Monastic violence like Pontius Pilate's bandits given Jesus back whippings and lashes 
 Viva Latino when Chino do a show 
 They'll be nobody hustling outside of your local Home Depot 
 Ridiculous flow perfected inside of my raps 
 Greatness, a destination that you will not arrive at, never 
 I hear the uncomfortable silence when I drop my verses 
 It's agreed on by churches that I'm the idol you can worship 
 Brolic and hypnotical in public or in solitude 
 I'm liable to stomp and boggle the human mind to molecules 
 Not bitter with a vendetta 
 Just a mile ahead these non spitters that are considered the fittest trend setters 
 My penned sentence, like Lucifer was my baby sitter 
 Till I'm surrounded by every step daughter of Bruce Jenner's 
 Chino' significant even when I just speak and brag 
 My birth certificate is printed on a Puerto Rican flag... I'm N.I.C.E
