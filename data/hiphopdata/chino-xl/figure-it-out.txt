[Verse One]: 
 While pop radio is plotting hip hop's destruction 
 Don't worry, Chino is never at a/outta bars on some drunk shit 
 And even destruction is not advised 
 I spit in Nancy Grace's face knowing TMZ is right outside 
 I'm with this fine Columbian broad, I'm preoccupied 
 Man I don't wanna talk about what lyricist you think is fire 
 It got me mad that I even came out to this spot 
 So I'm gonna leave this party with mami after this Jaeger shot 
 Drop you like Nasdaq 
 Strapped like mercenaries were in Iraq 
 You rappers dirty teeth is your only plaque 
 Word patterns and layers, nobody compares 
 When you write the best rhyme of your life you're half way there 
 I've brought ass and kicked ass in this rap genre 
 I'm hip hop's Jim Morrison, reincarnated like Dali Lama 
 Neanderthal, outta my cave fighting raptors 
 Trying not to lose my head like John The Baptist 
 Mastered this, crafted this game for almost two decades 
 But I'm stronger and look younger than rappers that's half my age 
 I banish you to 80 hells 
 So many personalities, could do a BET Cypher with myselves 
 I got a short fuse but refuse to get upset 
 Chino's such a symbol they could put me on a drumset 
 I ain't no dunn vet, my name alone is a death threat 
 And they ain't figure out no way that they can kill me yet 
 They want me in a coffin 
 Not capable of walking 
 They threatening and talking 
 But I will never soften 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 No way to kill me yet 
 I woke up strong this morning 
 In love with California 
 Instead of trying to clone me 
 Just put the crown on me 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it 
 No way to kill me yet 
 [Verse Two]: 
 I call half of these new artists "Mondays" when they spit it 
 Cause everybody hates Monday's dawg, you get it? 
 You had a hit and got dropped, now it's bon voyage 
 You wacker than the last episode of Entourage 
 The best of this thing that was created in the Bronx river 
 Crime spitter, trying to keep myself composed like Hans Zimmer 
 I leave you dying then I forward all my calls to your cell 
 So you can witness just how popular that I am 
 Invest in a retirement 
 Home I have my foes cold souls floating in limbo like that girl on The Lovely Bones 
 Extrordinary, more the merry, blurry, bury, fortunes in the mortuary 
 Torturary, corporate vary, often carry 
 Awesome semi, auto hemi heavy weaponry 
 And couldn't be calmed by any Ativan by Conrad Murray 
 There is no counter measure for this fire power 
 Olympic word hurdler, leaping every no language barrier 
 I'm Van Halen, legend in rap, breathern hate on 
 But choose your words carefully 'cause they're going on your tombstone 
 They wanna kill hip hop I won't have it 
 They wanna stop what bumps like Pro-Active 
 You're looking up to rappers, that's looking up to me 
 Like I'm a sniper with a rifle in a tree 
 Was born in the east, but a legend that's repping the west 
 And they ain't figure out no way that they can kill me yet 
 They want me in a coffin 
 Not capable of walking 
 They threatening and talking 
 But I will never soften 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 No way to kill me yet 
 I woke up strong this morning 
 In love with California 
 Instead of trying to clone me 
 Just put the crown on me 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it 
 No way to kill me yet 
 [Verse Three]: 
 In grammar school they were concerned about my mental health 
 I trick or treat for UNICEF and kept the money for myself 
 You try to hide it, then analysing my lines in private 
 It's all "fuck Chino" till you standing in the room beside him 
 The hardest artist argument, my murder monument 
 Will document my shocking doctrine 
 Caution I'm a monster walking 
 Oh you ain't never heard me rhyme 
 You ain't being honest 
 Duct tape, I throw you in the baby pool full of piranhas 
 I am timeless, even God refused to age me 
 Uncage me, don't break bread, break the whole bakery 
 Instead of thanking me, you'd rather anger me 
 Strangle me with the red tape of this corporate system but I've existed 
 Before Interscope 
 Before Courtney Love was on dope 
 Before music downloads 
 Before this current pope 
 Before rappers stole my quotes 
 Before Heath Ledgers overdose 
 Before Sarah Palin had Glen Rice all in her throat 
 Before there was a Deathrow 
 Before Big Pimpin' and mink coats 
 Or Jay-Z owned a boat 
 Before Katt Williams told a joke 
 I've been cold 
 Before a black candidate Rocked The Vote 
 Before Lauren won Grammy's for songs that her and Vada wrote 
 Chino you can't be the best, not enough records sold 
 But turn on videos that handling these human turds like gold 
 My effect on the game is enormous, no side talk 
 Refuse to fall through the cracks like dog piss on the sidewalk 
 When I finally retire and end my career 
 There will be enough sadness to rival Jennifer Hudson's tears 
 I peel myself off the cross and the world is stressed 
 'Cause they ain't figured out no way that they can kill me yet 
 They want me in a coffin 
 Not capable of walking 
 They threatening and talking 
 But I will never soften 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 No way to kill me yet 
 I woke up strong this morning 
 In love with California 
 Instead of trying to clone me 
 Just put the crown on me 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out 
 Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it 
 No way to kill me yet
