Perfection 
 Flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes 
 Back in the 1800's I was burned at the stake 
 Metaphor Mephistopheles 
 Degrees I've achieved 
 The brain fluid it takes to believe 
 Would equal the seven seas 
 I could reveal the true name of God 
 But you would go insane upon hearing it 
 Release enough winds to 
 Blow down pyramids 
 I'm the Michelangelo of syllables 
 Since I freestyle 
 Genesis been biblical 
 That's something you got to give in to 
 Since born in my mama's vaginal sauna 
 As a sono-gram, I've been fond of phonics 
 It's ironic, even as an embryonic 
 Fed through an umbilical 
 Don't that sound biblical? 
 I've been a terror 
 Since I teareth out of the u-terus 
 Because evil plans were made to defeat us 
 As a fetus 
 Though now I walk in infamy 
 As a child they had it in for me 
 Was raised with guns in infantry 
 In diapers and in infancy 
 The childhood of a hood 
 That was raised in the hood 
 Cops said "put your hands in the hot sky" 
 I put my hands down on the hot hood 
 I can't whine or drink wine 
 Nine planets planned it 
 Till it became apparent 
 My parents shouldn't have been a parent 
 State to state we ran some 
 I wasn't worth no ransom 
 Money, won't you hand some? 
 A nigga wasn't handsome 
 Raise the mind like Charles Manson's 
 New I was some man's son 
 But which one? 
 That made me strong 
 Created my poison tongue... 
 Why you cut school? 
 Cause you ain't feel too good 
 I cut school 
 Cause my cuts ain't heal too good 
 Through all the physical abuse 
 My mind escaped 
 Through the gift of wordplay 
 I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries 
 I wrote anthems from antonyms 
 Harmonies from homonyms 
 Created cinema from synonyms 
 Was livid to eliminate 
 That illustrious life you're livin' in 
 Wrote rhetoricals in rhythms 
 I can paralyze with a parable 
 Made rhymes out of religion 
 Use a prefix as a crucifix 
 Or suffocate you with a suffix 
 Wrote lectures so infectious 
 They're known to infect the listeners 
 Who dissin' us? 
 Yo punks you wait - I punctuate 
 My karma's the comma 
 That put you inside of a coma 
 Hyphen, dot, dot, semi-colon 
 Leave you semi-swollen 
 Question mark: You pregnant? 
 Oh you're not? I love you, Period 
 To sum it up, language is my essence 
 Fucked up in all my adolescence 
 Till my Mom's was out of lessons 
 Laws, I store convenient 
 Still I rob a convenience store 
 Love Mom, Fuck Mom 
 Shit, I don't love me no more 
 Mentally it didn't register, bitch 
 Empty the register, bitch 
 You just a cashier, bitch 
 Give the cash, here 
 Or I'll shoot you in your cabbage 
 Hijack a getaway cab, bitch 
 Words ain't makin' me no loot 
 Don't change now Dow Jones average 
 Regardless, we Godless 
 They stole my innocence 
 In a sense, the judge sentenced me 
 To 3 lifetimes sentences 
 To write my life in times and sentences 
 Art my dark arch nemesis 
 They want me off the premises 
 That's what the premise is 
 Locked on a tier 
 Where you can't shed a tear at 
 I studied more Shakespeare 
 Than any African can shake a spear at 
 And the whole world fear that 
 And it hurts 
 I got caught for killing time 
 But then I got with words 
 People can say whatever they want about me 
 But agree that I am the Wordsmith 
 They can try to ignore everything that I've achieved 
 But agree that I am the Wordsmith 
 I am the Wordsmith 
 Yo, the love of words is deep in my veins 
 Must be to silence my pain 
 I am the Wordsmith 
 And even if I never move a million units 
 It's my blessing how I do it, 'cause 
 I am the Wordsmith 
 I'm in a game full of morons 
 And they keep putting more on 
 I tutor the Torah 
 I'm in the core of the Qu'aran 
 The mind's what I represent 
 And MC's better re-present 
 I'm taking this rappin' bullshit 
 To the fullest extent 
 I have reservations 
 Why Indians are on reservations 
 Told that board of education 
 I was bored of education 
 As far as this go 
 I leave you deader than Disco 
 Rocking sex and violence 
 Over sax and violins 
 Through your minds camera lens 
 You're in need of an ambulance 
 I'll knock you to the asphalt 
 It's your own ass fault 
 Your last thought 
 I'll never sell my self short to be famous 
 And taking it up the anus just ain't us 
 The world could get the penis 
 Of this classically trained pianist 
 My P.O. was p.o.'d 
 Handed me a cup, told me to "pee in this" 
 The linguist musician 
 My college position is that my intuition 
 Told me I wouldn't be affordin' tuition 
 My education's all on my own 
 I might have been born yesterday 
 But I rhyme like there's no tomorrow...
