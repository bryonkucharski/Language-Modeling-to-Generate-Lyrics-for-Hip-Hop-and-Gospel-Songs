(Refrain: Chino XL and Akili Nickson) 
 She said she should've done this 
 She should've done that 
 Pack my bags and never look back 
 Some things that I've seen I can't un-see 
 I've spent my whole life just trying to get free 
 And I'm never gonna be... without my pain and misery 
 But I remember what my mama told me (Mama told me) 
 Mama told me (Mama told me) 
 I remember what my mama told me 
 (Verse 1: Chino XL) 
 I scramble to my feet to regain consciousness 
 The floor half full of blood, I'm a pessimist 
 It makes sense for me to make my exodus 
 This scene flashing through child monic movie images 
 I was nine years old with spine hemorrhages 
 Just me and him was in the house, no witnesses 
 All I'm thinking is, how I'm a live through this 
 He unclenched his fist, my face grimaces 
 I don't reminisce, I remember the stress 
 Feeling nervousness when he came home up the steps 
 Mom he beatin' me bad first escaped my lips 
 She said that I was a fuck up and I deserved this shit 
 What could I have possibly done I was only nine 
 With fucking stitches in my eye she told me stop crying 
 I'm looking for a sign, the sun don't ever shine 
 I'm an only child; they say that love is blind 
 (Refrain: Chino XL and Akili Nickson) 
 She said she should've done this 
 She should've done that 
 Pack my bags and never look back 
 Some things that I've seen I can't un-see 
 I've spent my whole life just trying to get free 
 And I'm never gonna be... without my pain and misery 
 But I remember what my mama told me (Mama told me) 
 Mama told me (Mama told me) 
 I remember what my mama told me 
 (Verse 2: Chino XL) 
 Now in retrospect as a father looking back 
 Having my own flesh of my flesh 
 There's no excuse for that 
 I also have heard that what don't kill us make us stronger 
 But the abuse that I took, took away my hunger 
 Living inside my imagination I learned hate 
 Planning my escape, losing my personal faith 
 She blamed it on the drugs; she blamed it on the times 
 She blamed on her moms, but I'm the one with scars 
 Staring at that chipped paint wall in my room 
 I'm 13 years old now I gotta do something soon 
 It was the 6th of June inside my mouth was a bloody wound 
 My step father vowed to put in me in a tomb 
 Momma told me my real daddy didn't want me 
 I figured this new man must be special if she let him hurt me 
 Now I ain't have a mother, and he ain't have no mercy 
 Why did god curse me? Maybe I'm meant to suffer 
 (Refrain: Chino XL and Akili Nickson) 
 She said she should've done this 
 She should've done that 
 Pack my bags and never look back 
 Some things that I've seen I can't un-see 
 I've spent my whole life just trying to get free 
 And I'm never gonna be... without my pain and misery 
 But I remember what my mama told me (Mama told me) 
 Mama told me (Mama told me) 
 I remember what my mama told me 
 (Verse 3: Chino XL) 
 I finally decided that I wouldn't take it no more 
 I had a steak knife that I've been hiding in my right drawer 
 He had punch my right jaw just the night before 
 I stood silently outside his bedroom door 
 But every breath I took I felt like there was angels with me 
 Soon his death would be a mystery even to me 
 I saw a shadow move, he finally coming through 
 I swung a knife at dude, if I had only knew 
 The life slipping out a body was my mom dukes 
 I had no idea that she was in the room too 
 Wiping tears from my eyes this can't be true 
 My step father drunk in the bed still off cheap brew 
 I knelled down to momma to hear a last truth 
 She said son I never loved him more than you 
 I still hate myself, I tried to hang myself 
 The leather belt broke, that was 20 years ago 
 (Chino XL and Akili Nickson) 
 She said she should've done this 
 She should've done that 
 Pack my bags and never look back 
 Some things that I've seen I can't un-see 
 I've spent my whole life just trying to get free 
 And I'm never gonna be... without my pain and misery 
 But I remember what my mama told me (Mama told me) 
 Mama told me (Mama told me) 
 I remember what my mama told me
