(Intro: Chino XL) 
 You're not gon' believe this! 
 This is really happening, everybody stand up 
 Oh, Tech Nina! Chino XL, everybody rise! 
 (Hook: Chino XL & M.O.P.) 
 (Fire!) It's like hell on one song 
 (Fire!) It's like the whole hell on one song 
 (Untamable, nonflammable) 
 One stage, one hell, one song 
 (Verse 1: Tech N9ne) 
 Instead of hard-ass niggas they bring women 
 And they mimickin' men again, when it spin it's freakin' feminine 
 Shit is sugar and cinnamon, this is hood and it's hitting 
 Adrenaline, sinister sin again, niggas diminishing 
 Finishing puffs, let thy fags bat they eyelash 
 I clash with industry enemies, kiss my ass 
 If you think you runnin' with my cash 
 Ain't no tellin' what kind of the calibers fly past 
 So-woop in this, my loot's in it, so I'mma shoot with it 
 Boosted it, my crew spit it, like Amaru in that Juice flitick 
 Now *'s neck tie is loose fitted 
 Nina left them laying like a razor blade noose did it, who's with it? 
 Tech Nina and Chino's Katrina flow wrecking * 
 Let's team up with lingo that'll bring us more chips than Casino 
 Now everyone's paid, maybe cause the gun's played 
 Nina and Chino XL, one song, one stage 
 (Verse 2: Chino XL) 
 I'll smoke you, like a detriment to the environment 
 While you stand in astonishment wondering where the sun went 
 Abandonment in war, hesitant after the message I sent 
 You're praying that I'm catholic and murder's what I'm giving up for lent 
 The road that I'm traveling is sharper than the surgeon's scalpel 
 When the screams of death * * militant Adam's apple * 
 Acid *, feeling like a slave when he was shackled and 
 More beef than even the IRS and Willie Nelson was in 
 Making the venomous cringe in the head 
 Fortune, torture, scorching my skin, still injected into my skeleton 
 No embellishing, poison pen, prodigal protestant, modest 
 * * * With a hatchet, walking in bloody moccasins 
 Been particularly partial to hide the harsh arsenal 
 Inside a sparse hospital, spacy bars like Mars, completely orbital 
 Ain't a record company that can market you 
 Chino the narcissist, heartless hunter, I will carcass you 
 God said, "Let there be light" 
 I said, "I got you, my nigga, tonight, but that's only cause you asked nice 
 My occupation spit sick lyrics outta my mouth 
 I clocked in the job when I was nine and I'm never clocking out 
 Face it, every verse Chino basically kills 
 So I stick to the script like an actor with no improvisational skills 
 Dudes mad that what I'm recording is more important 
 Than adopted an orphan or Slick Rick being deported 
 Or the bootlegged Jordan you wore and you tore in Florida 
 Fallin' for a foreigner whore in a Porsche, now she extortin' ya 
 Sorry ya can't get my warrior formula, you're too dumb 
 Screaming 'bout money and bitches, nigga, you ain't got neither one 
 The verbal clergyman serving disturbing effects 
 With permanent Terminix for ticks that's coming out the woodwork next 
 C-Cartridge spitter, surviving the harshest artic winter 
 Lethargic winner, sinner, still centered as one of Gods' 
 Incredible carnivorous critters, sicker, killer arch 
 Chino did for lyrics what the movie Jaws did for sharks 
 Lyrical Jesus and Tech N9ne, spaz, promo 
 Pass loco, y'all rappers are mad homo, cash bonos
