[Verse One]: 
 At this time I'd like to welcome back my congregation 
 That's been waiting patient for me to distribute this information 
 About this rap game and it's quality disintregration 
 And stop blaming Waka Flaka he ain't why your shit ain't blazing 
 Maybe something about your lack of originality 
 And your content is a constant bragging right about your salary 
 Then you're mad at me when I burn a verse like a fat calorie 
 And I hurt you even worse, your woman is feeling me fanatically 
 Dramatically I push myself to the brink of this art form 
 Of course you ain't charging me, you're a rhinoceros with no horn 
 I'm monsterous at home in a conflict zone 
 My natural tone is hazardous then slash gashes through your blood and bone 
 So I answer the phone 
 "Hello. Can you call me back?" 
 I'm blowed and scribe scrolls until there's bruises in my finger folds 
 I'm mad at Rubin, spit it crude enough to start a riot 
 My mind's fried like everything in black and Latin people's diets 
 Psychotic, iconic, ironic, ? 
 I'm provided with a lot of excited exotic vagina 
 Behind the stained glass windows with pictures of angels 
 Where the holy water's been replaced with Judas blood to pray to 
 Kneeling in the pews 
 Following the father's maze 
 More crowded than Tiawan's whore houses on dollar days 
 I am past the 
 Point of being a pastor 
 Inside of this wicked church I prove master 
 Curses since the first day of my birth 
 They thirst for what my words are worth 
 Once they're heard they'll scorch the Earth 
 They tried to burn me in this church 
 Fire 
 Brimstone 
 Liars 
 By my throne 
 God bless 
 My soul 
 It hurts inside this wicked church 
 [Verse Two]: 
 I've been through a lot of things that would've made you quit 
 "Too many puchlines. Chino rhymes too quick." 
 But if your favorite garbage artist did it he's a genius 
 Monkey's dancing around, don't even speak English 
 Wonder if they'd feel me even if they can 
 I'm Rembrant 
 I'll spit into your corny camp until my lips cramp 
 Fiscally I punish them 
 Make ASCAP stand for Always See Chino XL Accumulating Publishing 
 Displaying mayhem mannerisms 
 That'll shatter your catechism 
 More written compositions than there's crucifies in the Vatican 
 Discouraging anyone's adamant arrogance 
 Shooting, strangling, cherubims riding through Heaven on chariots 
 I'm no idiot 
 Library books try to rent me 
 I'm very literate, never dressing like Farnsworth Bentley 
 I've had it up to here and there's nothing to fear 
 Except fear itself 
 And even fear fears Chino XL 
 Curses since the first day of my birth 
 They thirst for what my words are worth 
 Once they're heard they'll scorch the Earth 
 They tried to burn me in this church 
 Fire 
 Brimstone 
 Liars 
 By my throne 
 God bless 
 My soul 
 It hurts inside this wicked church 
 [Verse Three]: 
 Medically it's sickness in my mental tissue 
 Psychiatrist couldn't rescue 
 Even my issues have got issues 
 Giving every dollar I make to a major 
 I'd rather have a blind bitch shave my balls with a razor 
 My hatred's creative, berated gospel singers 
 Spit enough acid, aiming to give euthenasia to every youth in Asia 
 Savor with most wicked behavior on the Earth's soil 
 Minister tried to baptise me, the water just started to boil 
 They worship Steve Jobs for creating the Apple invention 
 Ignoring the God that created the actual apple for our nutrition 
 Rapping about what you paid for your garments 
 Till your fragile life is ripped apart by extreme violence 
 Shooting you through your temple 
 Right through the window of your E-book Kindle 
 While you're reading shamefully false Ann Coulter info 
 Skitzo, morbid, ominmous poison poems 
 Call your real estate agent I'm about to hit you close to home 
 I can't lie 
 You wearing them tight pants confuses me 
 Why would a nigga wanna give his sperm count an eulogy? 
 The Lyric Jesus spitting scriptures unmercifully 
 But born to parents that would have lost custody to Charlie Sheen 
 This industry is all wrong 
 Rap skills invisible like albino niggas hitchhiking in a snow storm 
 The wicked church is hoping hip hop will deteriorate 
 So I'm spazzing out like Michael J. Fox with a Shake Weight 
 Curses since the first day of my birth 
 They thirst for what my words are worth 
 Once they're heard they'll scorch the Earth 
 They tried to burn me in this church 
 Fire 
 Brimstone 
 Liars 
 By my throne 
 God bless 
 My soul 
 It hurts inside this wicked church
