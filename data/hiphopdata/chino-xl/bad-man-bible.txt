Chapter and verse. From the bad man bible 
 I swear 
 Massacre should be at least my middle name 
 I'm a beast with fangs, I don't maim and I am immune to pain 
 I maintain with a brain that is clinically insane 
 Biologists never seen nothing like it, it's a new strain 
 At a cellular level, cold as the Ukraine 
 And modern science is too young for Chino to be explained 
 His fame is so for the birds it feels like I'm growing wings 
 And haters look so small from where I am, in the clouds and things 
 Y'all like bitches do anything to get my attention 
 I'm inflicting brutality, banned from Genneva Conventions 
 They wanna cut me out of history but I ain't dying 
 My heart is fire, my mind is water, my body's iron 
 Sound the siren, the tyran giant that'll never tire 
 God's child out of wild, defying the empire 
 Surviving those that conspire against Ghetto Vampire 
 Sick control freaks like Beyonce's father 
 Smarter 
 To know these cowards hold they stand astounding 
 Genius level, should be performing wearing a cap and gown 
 Mentally disturbed, disturb me 
 Get your family buried 
 My heart's an empty cavity that can only be filled in by murder 
 Stomp your fucking face till you bleed from every orafice 
 Make your life a living hell till the Devil's paying me mortgage 
 Witness 
 I got a brain sickness that's twisted 
 As Lawrence Taylor in that crack hotel with underage bitches 
 Hoping God grant me leniency 
 Turned all my pain into strength 
 They could sell my tears at a GNC 
 I try to stay healthy, right and keep my physique tight 
 And black don't crack 
 No but my Puerto Rican side 
 I hate people, I shake lethal 
 The straight strange cerebral 
 Possess the trait to facilitate great evil 
 Lyric Jesus surrounded by his seven disciples 
 Singing songs of survival from Bad Man Bible 
 Bible 
 Have you ever heard about the Bad Man Bible? 
 Tell you about the killer and his 12 disciples 
 That's why we come in pumping rifle 
 Bible 
 Have you ever heard about the Bad Man Bible? 
 Tell you about the killer and his 12 disciples 
 That's why we come in pumping rifle 
 The real nightmare is here, embarrassing 
 Making your bad dreams look like nursery rhymes in comparison 
 I spit gospel when speaking 
 Rappers are angry like Superhead with lockjaw on All-Star Weekend 
 You can hear it and feel it in your spirit that death's approaching 
 My rhymes are inflamitory, someone get the Ibuprofen 
 To grow up in darkness but my time's now 
 Fuck milk cartons, they'll be stenciling your face on live cals 
 Stop Chino, they know that they better kill him 
 Or I'm finding and turning they porno movies to a snuff film 
 My scribbling is the equivalent to shivering children 
 That were trapped and sealed in a Haitian building 
 But the faith was never given in 
 My venom that I'm penning like grinning jack-o-laterns 
 Lit and flickering, niggas running like gingerbread men taking insulin 
 You don't want an incident 
 You're tripping with the wrong one 
 That's self inflicted suicide like Marie Osmond's son 
 Fear of any man breathing a feeling that divert me 
 Put that on a list of what I don't have, next to AIDS and mercy 
 I stay in controversy, that's cursed as pagan worship 
 Reverse of the perfect murder as hermit preaching a sermon 
 That's currently birthing the urban servents serving certain persons 
 Slicing and sacrificing virgins there is evil lurking 
 Blood in the sand, I'm here to fulfill God's plan 
 Write my name on your palm 
 I'm a problem on your hands 
 The most passionate, blasphemous. lyric Lazarous 
 Sew you into a snuggie with hungry rats in it 
 Apart from the partially awkward larceny 
 See this heartfelt artistry? 
 Mortally, I free the God in me 
 I give an MC instant sympathy like crippled amputees 
 From botched carpentry trying to single handedly 
 Try they hand at archery 
 Whispers in blood 
 Bad Bible bury my sinning in ink 
 I think I could inseminate a seminary 
 It's scary, walking with a pound even when not needed 
 And these stigmatas that I got, don't know how to stop bleeding 
 The heathen, heaving 
 More wicked than any man breathing 
 Articulatly speaking, you're thieving, shrinking, it ain't worth repeating 
 For any petty, measily reason I'm wild sick 
 Your body won't even have a bone left to make a wish with 
 The explicit misfit, killer instinct, mystic Christian 
 Spit at this thing, try to diss me, hang you from ceiling like P!nk 
 Picture perfect, sinister, keeping the devil nervous 
 Writing verses, making you reconsider your life purpose 
 Every time I hear your name it's from getting punked 
 You worse than a pussy cause a pussy only bleeds once a month 
 I get drunk and high 
 Take peyote, skydive 
 Hit the ground after hallucinating, thousands of lines 
 They want the lyric god dead even the best try
