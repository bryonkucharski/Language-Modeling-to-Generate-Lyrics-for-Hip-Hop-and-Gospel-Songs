From a single seed off of a man 
 A man with countless hopes and dreams 
 And as he grew he tried and refried 
 But could never concord or succeed 
 The voices of the world spoke to him and said that he would be nothing 
 That the way he thought and expressed himself 
 Was pure hatred Satan sent 
 This turned that man into a rod 
 A rod that would not bend 
 But through its entirety the confusion the chaos 
 He will be the one that will save you all
