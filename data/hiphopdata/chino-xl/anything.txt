Long, long, long look away 
 Long, long, long look away 
 I don't owe you anything 
 I don't owe you anything 
 Long, long, long look away 
 Long, long, long look away 
 I don't owe you anything 
 I don't owe you anything 
 Yo 
 Locked in a hospital, a dead nurse with big tits and slit wrists 
 Tried to administer me pills but I resist 
 I'm dangerous as crocodiles out of tanks 
 You don't need my DNA strands to recognize my killer traits 
 I lost my mind, I'm haunted by the words that I've invented 
 To the point, they're feeding me glasses of Nyquil with my dinner 
 I associate the infliction of pain with pleasure 
 Frequently insult my neighbors wearing blood stained leathers 
 People that never visit insist that I owe them shit 
 I'm repeatedly taking Rohypnol and praying I don't exist 
 Damn near wanna throw a party off exhilaration 
 That I get from squeezing the life out of a human body shaking 
 I'm a happening waiting to accident, blessed sacriment 
 Festering blasphemist, transient arrogant acrobat 
 Riding camelbacks under circus tents, nervous off Percocets 
 Possessed laughs till I'm at Bernie Mac's funeral services 
 You've got mental problems, I'm sure 
 It's just that mine is greater 
 At least you have honor to live in the time I put ink to paper 
 Over 10,000 hours of labor, limitless 
 An undeniable perfectionist that plagues the souls of lyricists 
 Hand me a scalpel I'll scribble scribes on your face 
 I make people run, that's why they call it the human race 
 XL campaign, don't owe you a damn thang 
 Tear a turtles head off, drink blood out of shells like canteens 
 I can't scream, I got the metal machines ready 
 Forever holding my piece like I'm not objecting at a wedding 
 Was manufactured in Heaven to be a horid tourist 
 Placed specifically on Earth, quantuum leaps over other artists 
 Dirty my name, the seeds of discontent were planted 
 That's grounds for murder, I'm stoned, you took me for granted 
 Damn it, you think I owe you something, get it in blood 
 Rick James last words, "Chino's verse is a hell of a drug" 
 (Get me out of here) 
 I just needed some time to get my mind right 
 Then it's back to these bitches yelling "Go Daddy" like the website 
 Run away don't cross me 
 You won't be able to walk through your house without tripping over some dead offspring 
 I'm getting stressed by the government 
 Don't even write my name down unless it has "Paid To The Order" in front of it 
 Budgeted, trying to feed your family is real 
 Gas prices looking bigger than the numbers on Adele's bathroom scale 
 My skills internal and running wild 
 I could eat a Rubix Cube and shit it out completely solved 
 I vowed my foundation is built with brick and mortar 
 Destroying peers like a tsunami tearing through a harbor 
 Consistantly ill, but still industry overlook me 
 Officially, something is fisher than mermaid pussy 
 I hate you with a perfect hate and nothing less 
 Last seven words: 
 The best ever from the best yet
