"I ain't scared of nothing" - Richard Pryor 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 [Verse One]: 
 That nigga Chino XL is a cold menace 
 That ain't scared of nothing like I got no nerve endings 
 With the sickest sentence that is known from here to Venice 
 Since Rick Rubin signed my demo, been stronger than wooly mammoths 
 Heart darker than Black Sabbath 
 A real master of words that causes Havoc like Prodigy's partner's parents 
 Syllable chemist, was 16 with my first 12" 
 Destine 
 I had no choice like an arranged marriage 
 Like an inbred, tie you up in a toolshed 
 Hang you upside down and beat you till your piss turns red 
 Make you an invalid 
 Yes I'm sick and into it 
 It makes my heart warm like hating my father when I was a kid 
 No saving grace, I'm using razor blades to slash your arms 
 You're left for days and ate by gators in the Everglade swamps 
 I ain't scared of nothing, I'm stubborn, a live wire 
 My name in sign language is a middle finger on fire 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 [Verse Two]: 
 I'm that brolic god of carnage that would body college 
 Sick as gynecologists, spit collagen at live pirahanas 
 Eat cyanide olives by a cottage in the farthest forest 
 Burning down a farmer's crops just when he was about to harvest 
 My vocal cords will murder yours from sheer power wattage 
 Your comments, "Why did the plague of Chino rain down upon us?" 
 Silence 
 I'm breaking your legs, you're nausious 
 You can't run again like a president that already served two terms in office 
 Living lawless, raw performance for the riches 
 Put you down like toliet seats when you live in a house full of bitches 
 Sicker than Caeser's syphilis 
 And Jonbenet Ramsey's killers 
 And pictures of Natalie Holloway's titties (can I get a witness?) 
 My spirit is big so I don't fear a thing 
 I'll karate kick Steven Segal in his lace front wig 
 Fuck a pig 
 Hop out the whip and shatter your ribs 
 Wearing a mask in broad daylight like Michael Jackson's kids did 
 And I'll flip and then whip you to death with a marble bar stool 
 And dig up your corpse so I can drive in the lane for car pool 
 How do you think you can threaten the metaphor weapon 
 That's responsible for inventing this industry's rebellion? 
 Hellion 
 Dark scoundrel 
 Me fearing someone? 
 Over my dead body nigga, Gary Coleman 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic 
 You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high 
 Get 'em 
 "I ain't scared of nothing" 
 [Verse Three]: 
 Lungs of a champion 
 I take one breath and start an album and don't breathe again until I'm sitting at mastering 
 Chino the ambassador, caster of the spell of a massacre 
 Hell is the task of thee assassin that does more spazing per capita 
 Serving half of the bastard rappers, inhaling cancer, breath out asthema 
 Dump your body in the back of a factory canister 
 My position is vivid, if it's a gimmick I give it 
 60 minutes than exhibit the sickest village verbal spillage 
 Worship my words 
 I got more game than Wild Life Preserves 
 I'm purging out sperm in a perma perm in a groupie birth 
 I stand firm in the stance that Chino XL is the handsomest 
 No time for romance and shit, I'm on my Charles Manson shit 
 I got so many bars that I could apply for a liquor license 
 Not the lesbian type that's dyking but Viking trips I'm writing 
 Where my similes are similar and liken to a Lycan 
 Werewolf in the night that'll have you and your Christ afterlife you liking 
 I'm fighting, managing, keeping savage at all costs 
 Fuck showers I'm dragging Mark Zimmerman through a car wash 
 I rhyme to the point of exhaust and killing everybody 
 And copied 16 and sloppy and played out like Ed Hardy 
 You started, I'm slashing, I don't wanna hear you're sorry 
 Leave your face fractured, twisted backward like Whitney's baby daddy Bobbi 
 I'm the illest is what the gossip is 
 Wanna rep your state? 
 All right, I'm beat you into the state of unconsciousness 
 Monsterous until I'm posthumous it's obvious 
 Me fearing anybody breathing, simply nonsense 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing 
 My only weakness is 
 I ain't scared of nothing
