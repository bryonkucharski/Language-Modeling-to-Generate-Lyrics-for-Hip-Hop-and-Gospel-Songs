These rappers saying lines I never quote 
 They faker than them letter that Solar be claiming that Guru wrote 
 I wanna slit they throat and go berserk and stab kids 
 I'm underground and don't give a fuck who Rebecca Black is 
 Distributing these knuckles straight across your glass chin 
 I will Manute Bol a nigga, I put 'em in a long casket 
 The monster spitter that's sinister as a witches cackling 
 H1N1 off my tongue but there is no vaccine 
 I'm brash and nocturnal and graphic like a whores journal 
 So I don't gotta rhyme till I'm turning purple to merk and serve you 
 I get more checks than my ese homie Stermal 
 When I clear you out early like a Jonas Brother's curfew 
 You try to sue the hospital 
 Couldn't be saved by breathing tubes 
 Jesus wearing a T-Shirt that saying "What Would Chino Do?" 
 I'm here to seal your doom 
 XL is a problem 
 You will never see me coming like a camouflage condom 
 The true villain, never through killing 
 My haters are just big fans, should be spinning on my bedroom ceiling 
 But Chino got ammo for every coward that's hated him 
 And a trigger finger that's twitching like Mohammad Ali's brainstem 
 I don't wanna hurt you but I will if I have too {X4} 
 It's uncanny how many are ready to end me 
 I deserve Emmys and Grammys and plenty of pennies 
 And these pretty Chevy's on hydrolics 
 Verses like they're on anabolics 
 Making rappers cry like babies when they got the colic 
 These artists wanna be me bad 
 If imitation is the highest form of flattery 
 Than my raps should be as flat as Paris Hilton's ass 
 I'm trying to bring light skin back 
 But El Debarge can't keep his path out of rehab 
 The Puerto Rican spic been sicker than Auswitch 
 Since Noah's Ark was just a pile of woodchips 
 You think you're fabulous till the savages double barrellers 
 Outside your house and it's singing like Christmas carollers 
 I spit till I'm raspy 
 I'm sicker than Raz-B 
 When Chris Stokes, nah erase that shit it's fucking nasty 
 You softer than Avril Levine shooting shrapnal at the king 
 The madder rapper that'll shatter your bladder matter and spleen 
 It's an animal thing and on your grave I will dance on 
 Your pussy CD will not go double tampoon 
 Yo 
 They try to mimic my energy, it ain't meant to be 
 Consider me Hannibal Lecter giving out food recipes 
 Your ass kicked and your path to the casket choosed 
 Bastards rubbing me the wrong way like a bad masseuse 
 Ricanstruction ain't an album it's a murder exhibition 
 Sit back and turn the skeleton key into the ignition 
 Hold hands in a senance realize that the table's risen 
 In an industry that's frail and fucking calcium deficient 
 Thank Heaven that the visionary Poison Pen has back arisen 
 Fucking every beat that I'm given in missionary position 
 My rhymes were not written for fame or to get rich 
 But therapeutically put my childhood in the electric chair and hit the switch
