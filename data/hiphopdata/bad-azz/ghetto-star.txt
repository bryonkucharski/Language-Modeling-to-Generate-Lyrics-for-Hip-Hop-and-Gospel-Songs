This is for all my Low Life thug niggas yeah, 
 Livin' they life as a ghetto star, you know (worldwide) 
 You know those days when you hear the lord calling you 
 But you don't respond 'cause you ballin' and your all in two 
 Your ghetto star lifestyles, big houses and cars 
 Million dollar phone calls to bad bitches and all 
 A nigga don't make five bucks to spend before he come up 
 Sippin' out this half a pint bout to light up this blunt 
 Just reminicin' bout past years, deaths and tears 
 So many fallin' peers I'd never though I'd see these years 
 Swallowin' my tank of beer hope the rain hide the tears 
 Pray to God I ain't scared, if they bust, hide and hit 
 And if they come fightin' shit I won't believe it 'cause I'm low 
 I'm a child of God and keep mashin' for what's good to me 
 You should recognize game when it's all in your face 
 Would you choose to lie and die mamed so you fall on your face 
 But I refuse to lose so I ball in my space 
 Live my life straight ballin' 
 I hear the penitentary callin' 
 Live my life straight ballin' 
 I hear lord Jesus callin' 
 Ghetto Star, Ghetto Star 
 I invented my own lifestyle from crumbs and dope 
 Fuck shattered dreams there's fatter things that come from hope 
 You heard 'em holla "keep ya head up" 
 I ask God to help us out 
 The world's caught a plague and everybody's weapons out 
 Shoot first, and never get to the ask questions part 
 When we blast testin' marks you ain't fit to live a day here 
 Best to keep your heat and hold your post you wanna stay here 
 It sure ain't worth askin' why I stay so high 
 You don't irritate my mind 
 And I ain't got time if it ain't about a dime 
 The fat pace, crack chase, played out with ces 
 It's gettin' rich with Low Lifes ands it's put on my chest 
 And fuck a high speed chase, gettin' laced with slugs 
 And stuck steppin' off a plane duct taped with drugs 
 I'm tryin' to live my life to the fullest extent 
 You crossed my clique noe you know what them bullets just meant 
 We keep it hittin' hard bangin' corners bouncin' up the boulevard 
 Smokin' somethin', niggas dumpin' hollerin' bout "life is hard" 
 Just 'cause we ride to live, mean somethin' gotta give 
 I don't care who you are, live like a ghetto star 
 Life is only one time, that's why we hate one-time 
 Tryin' to live my life, my life under the sunshine 
 That's why I live, when they get deep I hold my breath 
 And here's my only reply when he asks me 'bout death 
 I said, "I never could picture me dead, 
 Could only see my life is lavish and obviously 
 I can get it so I gotta have it" 
 And you can live your life forever scarred 
 But I'ma ball till I'm gone livin' life as a ghetto star 
 Bently coups, mini mansions like Snoop 
 And watch full of rocks, million dollar speed baots, yaughts 
 All the time I got. is spent on some hood shit 
 Pray when I see the break of day on some good shit 
 Hit the liquor store to get some blunts for the dope 
 Man if I ain't hight, can't cope 
 God help us 
 You hope to hear us holler his name 
 He know we stuck in all this sea and chasin dollars and fame 
 When will it end 
 The pain and the pressures of life come at once 
 And the only remedy is some drinks mixed with blunts 
 The lord knows what goes on behind closed doors 
 And it's twntey five to life with those ho's with gold ?bows? 
 Catch you at your momma's hose slippin' 
 Gang bangers from the game we ride when it's time for dippin' 
 Kill the cops, fuck they law, they ain't arresting me 
 Life is jail without bars and ghetto star is my destiny
