(Talking) 
 Check it, brrrrrow! 
 That was personal! 
 It's real with this 
 I came here right now to put a little hope in the hearts, 
 And the minds of those have-nots 
 You don't wanna be broke, you wanna be rich and famous 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 Well why would you go where everybody knows what your name is 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 I'm a product of the block 
 Selling crumbs off this fifty dollar rock 
 And my house is the dope spot 
 On the couch with the door locked 
 Shorty K's on the phone, Lil J's on the floor 
 The Jeffersons on the tube somebody knockin' at my door 
 Who is it? 
 I ain't expectin no visit 
 So shady, I answer the door with the 380 
 'Cause lately, haters been pushing my buttons 
 Frontin niggas get nothin' 
 It's like all of the sudden 
 Everybody's want a Bentley 
 Everybody got a rap 
 Everybody done been in a gang or sold a little crack 
 How's that? 
 For history on Unsolved Mysteries 
 You niggas wanna holla at Bad, you can get with me 
 In traffic I'm a hood-type nigga made good 
 I'm the chronic wit it, stress weed tastes like wood 
 And you should, recognize life is more important 
 Every second that goes by, it's only getting shorter 
 We order death at the burger stand 
 Murder stands closer to love than hate, wait 
 Drugs are more abundant than fate 
 And there some places about as safe as being nowhere 
 Close to your gun out in Kosovo 
 Run on feet from the cops, 
 With the lights from the chopper on your back 
 Ditch the strap, with the other hand throw the sack 
 If they catch me without the gun they gon' stretch me 
 Fuck a six, I'd rather deal with God and repent 
 And on this one way street of life that ends in the middle 
 There's a little time left, let's hit the liquor store and get some liqour nigga 
 Drink away the drama before it leads us astray 
 Wake up drunk and do the same thing the very next day 
 And aye aye 
 If I cane I ain't got enough money honey 
 Real sunny days make me horny, do you want me 
 To spend a little money on your panties and a movie and some candy with some doobie and some brandy, and he 
 Took her to the hotel 
 To whoop her and let her throw tail 
 All around the room, and check out about noon 
 To zoom zoom 
 And I smashed off 
 Just to drop the ass off 
 And turn the beat up, and speed up 
 'Cause this the type of shit that niggas thrash on 
 You don't wanna be broke, you wanna be rich and famous 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 Well why would you go, where everybody knows what your name 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 I can see you don't know, exactly what the game is 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 I'm just trying to give you hope, that's exactly what my aim is 
 (Bad Azz is a fool) 
 In this forsaken life of sin 
 They got a cell for you waiting at the pen 
 Your homies is there, that ain't never coming back again 
 It's silly murders in the dope game 
 Robbed and executed over cocaine 
 From Little Rock on back up to Spokane 
 And L.A.'s the same thang 
 The same place the kids play they gang bang 
 They bang bang and shoot 'em up 
 And who the fuck! 
 Got heart enough to talk to a pistol 
 Blow the whistle on your life 
 It's like craps on the dice 
 Bustin' caps on a bike 
 Flee speedin down an alley 
 Thinking 'Damn! It's somethin' bout Cali' 
 It's water or the Cavi 
 Naw maybe it's the bitches and the sunshine 
 Fool it's the palm trees, cool breeze and one time 
 This the home of ragtops and swimsuits 
 We wear Chuck Taylors, nigga we don't fuck with Timb boots 
 We 2pac wit it (what) 
 We too hot wit it (what) 
 Keep two glocks wit 'em (what) 
 Shoot two cops wit 'em (what) 
 We on the block wit it 
 Raw, nonstop wit it 
 Run up bustin', nigga 'cause we ain't cockin shit 
 We in the chamber off safety 
 You in danger if you hatin' all that envy and that drama really make me 
 Wanna take it there, make it wear 
 You ain't really safe out here 
 Comin' up on your block 
 Poppin' shots out the drop 
 Snatch my ski mask off, turn the beat up 
 And speed up, 'cause this the shit that niggas thrash on 
 Bad Azz is a fool (repeated until end)
