(Feat. Kurupt) 
 (Bad A$$:) This life of ours 
 The same thing that got a nigga here get me there 
 (Ev'rything you see, ain't always what it seems to be) 
 Yeah yeah, the same thing that got a nigga here get me there 
 Come on, Bad A$$, Kurupt, The Gang 
 (Verse 1: Bad A$$) 
 I'm just trying ta make a dollar out of nothing 
 Turn zero into somethin' 
 And it's, one life we live, with this, one shot to give 
 You got chances, we use none risking your life 
 You know we got guns, why you come and get us with knives 
 It's a cold thang, the game, just take folks under 
 It feels better if you say that god just called his number 
 When you do we kept a self situations like that 
 In situations where it's likely somebody might gat 
 No bad intentions, we all like to jump in the car 
 No destination but we all thinkin' hard to get far 
 (Chorus x2: Bad A$$) 
 Money, houses, and cars, this life of ours, goin' where 
 We came a long way, but still we got so far to go to get there 
 (The same thing that got a nigga here get me there, and if it don't, it wasn't 
 Sposed to) 
 (Verse 2: Kurupt, Bad A$$) 
 (Kurupt) 
 I got gangsta ass niggas with so much heat 
 G'd up rides with so much beat 
 G'd up apparal, dope by the barrels, gangsta ass goodfella nigga 
 Kurupt and nell??? 
 I once had a bitch that ate so much dick 
 That she couldn't do nothin' for me, but blow one of the homies 
 As I ease my way right up the streets 
 Me, D-a-z, Bad A$$, and Priest 
 We gotta hit the spot where the homies meet 
 Where all the OG's round up the fleet 
 'Cause the homies is crazy shit 
 And we all about stackin' up a grip 
 No funny ass niggas, no scandliss ass ho's 
 And we don't give a fuck about a bitch 
 (Bad A$$) 
 I can't worry 'bout a bitch 
 I'm tryin' ta get rich by next week 
 And I can get me some pussy when it ain't nuttin to eat 
 My life, this life of ours buyin nuttin, houses and cars 
 Ghetto stars, doin' our thing 
 Like bust a bitch, bust a bitch, and get rich with my gang 
 We brang, to the table, what you ain't able 
 A few pies to cut, 'cause we ride for bucks in the worst way 
 Today Tuesday, I got a date on Thursday, and fuck what you say 
 You say dirt about us when we ain't there 
 When we come around, you fuckin' clown, you act scared 
 Tupac is dead, stop questioning life 
 You had to talk to the feds, that's the test in the life 
 Goin' where, a long way from here to get there 
 You gotta mash to maintain 
 Blast that's the gang thang 
 (The same thing that got a nigga here get me there) 
 (Verse 3: Kurupt, Bad A$$) 
 (Kurupt) 
 (I, I, I, I) 
 I heard gangstas don't ride with disguises 
 But I'm quick to throw the mask on to get my blast on 
 So call it what you want, yeah yeah, that's all cool 
 But me and the homies bout to act the fuckin' fool 
 Dump if you dump 
 Nigga pull the pump 
 Lay a nigga (lay a nigga), for the homies spray a nigga 
 This ain't the Sony, so you can't play a nigga 
 The homies quick to cock, A-K a nigga 
 With no hesitation 
 Penaltants populate the population 
 A nickel plated penitration 
 Khakis, t-shirts and stars 
 Homies, busta's, riders and mark's 
 All y'all niggas here wanna be hard 
 But no nigga with heart when the heater spark 
 Just ask the homie Bad A$$ 
 He'll put you d on how it's sposed to be in the whole family 
 As I ease my way right up the streets 
 Me, D-a-z, Bad A$$ and Priest 
 We gotta hit the spot where the homies meet 
 Where all the OG's round up the fleet 
 'Cause the homies is crazy as shit 
 And we all about stackin' up a grip 
 No funny ass niggas, no scandliss ass ho's 
 And we don't give a fuck about a bitch, (bitch, bitch, bitch) 
 (Bad A$$) 
 Yeah, 1-9-9-9, the Gang, all in your face at close range 
 Mr. Bad A$$, yeah yeah yeah yeah, it don't quit, we keep it crackin' like this 
 Ugh, aww yeah yeah yeah, it don't quit 
 It ain't over till I'm done 
 Ain't nowhere to hide, so why run 
 I don't battle with rappers, either bomb or draw guns 
 You can hate me, 'cause I got skills and live real 
 And my life is well woven in these stack of dollar bills 
 I should kill, I would come and kill your ass 
 But your only mission is destruction, why get in your path 
 I'll let you kill yourself, while I chill with wealth 
 And let the story be the word on the streets, a few weeks 
 I gotta eat, fuck fuckin' with you and being broke on the streets 
 Duck duckin with you and gettin' smoked, that's a no-no 
 What you think it's fifty five or 4-4 
 Money, houses, and cars, nigga I gotta go 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 It don't quit we keep it wreckin like this, ha ha ha ha 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah it don't quit 
 Nigga you can suck a fat dick 
 Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 We keep it crackin', keep it crackin' like this (this, this, this, this)
