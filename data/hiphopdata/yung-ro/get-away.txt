(*Talking*) 
 Sometimes you get away huh, uh-huh 
 We up in this bitch, my nigga Head 
 Yung Ro, Rizzo dig these blues 
 (Yung Ro) 
 I can write forever bout my pain, till my pen run to ink about it 
 I'm a sinner dear Lord, if I ain't doing it I'm thinking 'bout it 
 Surrounded by killers, voulters and devious guys 
 So I spend most of my time, looking in my baby's eyes 
 Searching for a longer hobby, cause these drugs ain't no doing it 
 Use to have a grasp on reality, now these drugs done ruined it 
 I can't a-fford a loss, I'm paranoid and strapped 
 Bad blood with my connects, got me watching my back 
 And I know I'm doing wrong, so I'm destined to be punished 
 This mob life got me stressing, to my people one hundred 
 I can't see it another way, to survive in these streets 
 Searching for answers looking for love, and praying for peeps 
 I gotta (get away), because I'm dying at home 
 High in the zone, just me and my thoughts crying alone 
 Thinking (ooh), naw I can't I wish I could 
 Everybody up to no good, nobody's real in the hood 
 I gotta (get away), and find another place to rest at 
 A strong foundation, somewhere I can make a nest at 
 (Ooh), and the answer is no 
 Nigga nobody with nothing, I got nowhere to go 
 I gotta (get away), dear Father show me a path 
 Because this road I made myself, I'm garunteed to crash 
 My nigga (ooh), X-O is all I need 
 Taking flight with my oranges, while puffing on weed 
 Trying to (get away), still trying to get out that do' 
 But turning the knob the wrong way, and I don't even much know 
 (Ooh), man I wish I could answer that 
 I got problems, and the back of the book ain't where the answers at 
 I'm trying to (get away) got physical, spiritual and mental pain 
 Trying to get away, but it's hard when your enemy's your brain 
 (Ooh), my nigga I gotta get it 
 And I expect a small plate, and on top of that I gotta split it 
 Gotta (get away), get away to get me some cash 
 I need it fast I gotta mash, praying hope it last 
 (Ooh), I'm just trying to keep my head up 
 And a pistol from my head, but a young nigga fed up 
 (Get away), from all this pressure and pain 
 Dear Lord show me a way, for me to smile again 
 (Ooh), got me searching for that light 
 Grinding working after night, got me hurting it ain't right 
 (Yung Ro) 
 I gotta (get away), but that ain't the main issue 
 It's easy to run, my question's where I'm gon get to 
 (Ooh), too many questions I can't make out 
 Now I'm trying to escape, from what I though was an escape route 
 (Get away), I tried running tried walking 
 Use to stay to myself, this year I even tried talking 
 Asking (ooh), and in return I got nothing naw 
 Someone answered, but never understood the question how to 
 (Get away), they say I'm crazy on some mo' shit 
 I talk to God a lot, I'm one deep on some Ro shit 
 (Ooh), g'eah whatever that is 
 Don't know why I remember how, but I'm stuck with what it did 
 (Get away), so nigga what it do 
 Peep my mind, ninety percent of my thoughts is fuck you 
 So (ooh), back-back move from round me 
 I ain't friendly dude, Ro don't speak kindly 
 (Get away), matter fact far away 
 And you can take it from this song, or realize the hard way 
 (Ooh), I ain't asking no mo' 
 I'm blasting a fo', and that's for anyone who pass through that do' 
 (Get away), kick rocks bitch beat it 
 The offer was thoughtful, but your presence isn't needed 
 (Ooh), nigga leave me alone 
 'Cause I don't need you coming around, just to leave me alone 
 (Get away), I'm all right by myself 
 I fight by myself, alone sleep at night by myself 
 So (ooh), get the fuck away from me 
 I'm a nobody nigga, and I ride one deep 
 (*Talking*) 
 Just let it run I'm cool 
 You know, I use to be just like you, you 
 So far innocence, love, passion 
 And a need for serenity, preaching for a change 
 Until things change, like some'ing else got into me 
 Like when I gained something, I lose something 
 Something so precious, so essential 
 A foundation a base, started in my heart 
 And spread it to my mental, and from that 
 Led to my situation, or should I say situations that I'm in 
 Addicted to pain, drama, dope, temporary pleasure 
 A living hell, drowning in sin 
 This fast life ain't for me, but I never accomplished nothing 
 From crying, but it's so hard to fake a smile on the outside 
 When on the inside, you really dying 
 Ain't no escaping this life, and honestly 
 I couldn't picture life, without this 
 This pain shit, me without pain is like a scientist without his question 
 What if, but what if I did grow up like you 
 Across that other side of the fence, where the grass is green 
 And life is more predictable, and the unfolded mathematics 
 Actually make sense, maybe I could have been something worth speaking of 
 If I only had a chance to, or maybe I did 
 And just was a kid, unable to see so I just ran to 
 An easy way out, a shortcut, a quick route 
 Running for that oasis, and realized 
 I was actually moving backwards, further into that drought 
 Man, ha that made nothing but excuses what I think 
 Life is cursing me, like God like 
 I deserve more Father please mercy me 
 Naw, I need to take care of bidness 
 Quit letting temptation win, and the Devil use me as his puppet 
 I hear him laughing, while I'm walking on crutches 
 Man corrupts, everything he touches 
 Got me scared to drop a seed, knowing that I'm destined to be punished 
 Question is, will God punish me 
 Or will it come along, with the birth of my child 
 From a cursed stomach, hmm man I don't know 
 All I know is I'm tired, and I think I'm at the end of this road 
 And the question we all ask, what happens after this 
 Nobody knows
