(Yung Ro - Talking) 
 Sheeeit I feel what you saying

 Ya know 
 I feel that, I feel you but can you feel me 
 Listen to the song though ya know 
 Fuck the song, let's just come and do the song 
 But listen to it 
 Look, ay 
 (Yung Ro) 
 Say lil mama, I'm the type that just like to kick back 
 But Just being on the phone, I don't like to chit chat 
 I got other shit to do than just holding the phone 
 'Cause I been grown for a minute, out here holding my own 
 I got stress, niggaz plexing and I'm trying not to kill 
 But you soft and you a woman, and sometimes I wanna chill 
 I get depressed start smoking, and start wrecking my mind 
 Shit I'm just telling you some things that's on the back of my mind 
 Now some niggaz smoke, and they drink too much 
 But can you imagine a nigga who think too much 
 I got problems, multiplied by fifty 
 And I can't solve none of them, so I need you quickly 
 I want a ride or die chick, who won't know and learn fast 
 And I don't got nowhere to go, but we can ride and burn gas 
 Have you ever been to the beach, on a late night trip 
 Or had a nigga to kiss you, and slowly bite you're lip 
 Girl what you mean you don't know how to kiss 
 Do you make love, or do you just fuck his dick 
 Baby damn, you got to listen 
 Between sex and love, is a very big difference 
 Now that nigga made you, a prone of his 
 But when it come to a kiss, he won't go on ya lips 
 Close ya eyes, and picture you corressing me 
 Don't get me wrong, it ain't all about sex with me 
 Because me and you know, what my mind can do 
 But you don't know how hard it was finding you 
 Now making you understand, is what's getting to me 
 Baby close you're eyes and just listen to me 
 I know people feel, what they don't understand 
 And that's the only reason why I can't be ya man 
 And I know you got a man, and I ain't telling you to start switching 
 But I know I'm right, when I say theirs something missing 
 And I know something else, you care about him right 
 And you thinking it just wouldn't be right 
 But can you tell me what's right or wrong, and what that got to do with it 
 See what I'm saying, what love got to do with it 
 'Cause if you ain't happy, you just letting time pass 
 And you can still get any nigga with you're sexy ass 
 Ha and that's from Yung Ro, you can't lie and say you don't like the way I flow 
 So you can tell him how you feel, and come fuck with Ro 
 Or I could be ya back up, and keep it on the low 
 But if he find out and wanna cuss, fight and shout 
 Tell him to call me and I can help his dumb ass out 
 Ha don't get me wrong, I ain't gonna beat ya man up 
 But tell him what's really on ya mind, and heat ya man up 
 All I can do is tell him what I see in life 
 Tell him respect his woman, just a little advice 
 Tell him I know it's his house too, so I ain't gonna come in ya place 
 He gonna tell me to quit calling, and hang up in my face 
 Haha now what do you call that? 
 Ha you know me, I got to call back 
 Say what's up nigga, tell me how in the fuck you figure 
 I'm a quit calling, stop and ignore
