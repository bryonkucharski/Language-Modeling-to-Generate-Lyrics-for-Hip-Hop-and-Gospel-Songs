(Daddy-O) 
 One nine nine to three 
 And I wonder what kind of day Allah, has in store for me 
 So I stroll out the crib about eight 
 To go eat breakfast at Mike's, everything's all right 
 Leave out of Mike's about nine 
 Headed Uptown to the studio - everything's fine 
 Reached the studio about ten 
 Bumped into a good friend - that's what I thought then 
 But to my surprise, he was the opposite 
 When he played - tough, I had to call his bluff 
 "It's cool... to occupy your own 
 Come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome" [x4] 
 (Daddy-O) 
 Shoppin' downtown on the street 
 Lookin' for a pair of new sneaks then I went to get a bite to eat 
 I saw a guy and his lady 
 She didn't look my way, but he was lookin' at me kind of shady 
 So I asked him whassup (Yo whattup?) 
 But before "up" came out, he was pushin away his plate and cup 
 Screamin somethin' bout watchin where I look 
 Kinda caught me off guard, so at first I was a little shook 
 But when I gained my composure 
 I suggested he sit back down where he was cause brother I don't know ya 
 But he wouldn't take heed 
 So in front of his girl, and the rest of the place, I bust his face 
 "It's cool... to occupy your own 
 Come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome" [x4] 
 (Daddy-O) 
 There was a time and a day; that if I was tested and tried 
 I turned my cheek and looked the other way 
 But nowadays I don't sleep; 'cause if I try to turn away 
 Them brothers think that I'm bein weak 
 So I'm even in the odds; and whoever steps to me 
 Better be makin' sure he pray to God 
 Less he wanna be my prey; but you don't wanna go that route 
 Hahahaha... I'm out! 
 "It's cool... to occupy your own 
 Come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome" [x4] 
 ... 
 "Come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome"
