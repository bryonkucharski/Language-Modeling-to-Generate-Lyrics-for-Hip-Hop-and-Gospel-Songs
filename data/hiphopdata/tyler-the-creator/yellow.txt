Now when I first saw you 
 I could tell you was the one 
 That I've been searchin' for 
 I needed somethin' that was like the Sun 
 Now all my flowers grow 
 Right now my life, it blooms, baby 
 You're my favorite color, my favorite color 
 My favorite color's you 
 It's like the endless summer, endless summer 
 Whenever I'm with you 
 Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow 
 Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
