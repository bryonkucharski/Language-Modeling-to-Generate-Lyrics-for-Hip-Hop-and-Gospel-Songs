I like my girls skinny with brains 
 I like my hoodies fucked with lane 
 I like my friends imaginary with no names 
 And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame 
 Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round 
 Tried to find ammo but it's none around town 
 So I went Down South but I ended up North 
 Uptown sittin' on Cloud 9's white porch 
 And of course, my car's off course 
 You're so white, my blinkers don't work 
 I'm tryna let the force, be with you, I get you 
 Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce 
 You make a nigga sing songs nice 
 You make a nigga's night turn day 
 And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow 
 It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello 
 I wanna eat you out like jello 
 And mess with your body like the base and the cello 
 And tell your mom I said hello, you wanna go to prom? (Nigga hell no!) 
 Fuck (Shit) and another one, and on another one 
 Another love song about shit 
 And I'll be rich if I get another diss 
 And maybe Cupid won't miss 
 I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me 
 But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's 
 I wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement 
 Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went 
 (Tyler, what you doin'?) Shut the fuck up 
 You gon' fuckin' love me bitch 
 But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek 
 In private, not public in the streets 
 And your cupcake I will eat and your toes 
 'Cause I got a big fetish with the feet 
 I just want somebody I can see 
 You can be a gold digger, you ain't gotta love me 
 I'm serious, I don't ask for much 
 Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch 
 Now this shit is turnin' to a habit 
 I'm the Burger King, I gotta have it my way 
 And truthfully girl you really make my day 
 I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay 
 And I can't even look the other way 
 Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive 
 L-O-L laughin', you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin' 
 And I want your sin in my hole, and have our kids play supportin' role 
 Climbin' up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold 
 And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah 
 Another love song about shit 
 And I'll be rich if I get another diss 
 And maybe Cupid won't miss 
 Half your body layin' on my chest 
 The rest is in my stomach, that's includin' your breast 
 And I'mma just take another guess 
 Now you probably wishin' that you woulda said yes 
 Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately 
 Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family lookin' for you, wish 'em good luck 
 Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy 
 Now you stuck up in my motherfuckin' basement all bloody 
 And I'm fuckin' your dead body, your coochie all cummy 
 Lookin' in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me? 
 What did you want from me? What did you want from me?
