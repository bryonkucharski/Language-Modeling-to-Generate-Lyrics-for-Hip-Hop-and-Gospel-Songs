(I can't read) 
 (I got five on it) 
 (I got five on it too my niggas) 
 (You smokin' nigga?) 
 Nah, I ain't smokin' 
 (Nigga come on, just hit the fuckin' blunt) 
 Nah, y'all know I don't smoke man 
 (This nigga never wanna smoke) 
 I'm high off life nigga 
 (We should hotbox it) 
 (Straight-edge ass nigga) 
 I'm good man 
 (Fuck it, if you ain't gonna fuckin' smoke nigga, just, just rap for us nigga) 
 All right, I can hotbox it 
 Yo, yo, look 
 I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap 
 Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback 
 My self-respect I leave that in the lost and found 
 Where the black girls get their weaves back, awesome I achieve that 
 Mini, blasting "You're a jerk" in some fucking yellow skinnies 
 Looking like a fucking faggot, bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie 
 Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead 
 I like my girls smart, skinny, kinda Pop Tart when I bite into them red 
 I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist 
 I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots 
 My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem with the Future 
 You can get a death wish just like Atiba 
 Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant 
 I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent 
 Blind fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed that I'm sharing 
 In the force with the cyclops staring 
 I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever so don't ask for no motherfuckin' ride when you see us 
 Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew 
 'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes 
 Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos 
 The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you 
 Kill the jungle, let the cats loose 
 You didn't see me here if someone ask you 
 (That nigga got off) 
 Hodgy Beats 
 Hodgy Beats: 
 I want to feel her in every way 
 Mary Jane keeps me high like every day 
 Bong, vaporizer in the sack now 
 Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped 
 Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps 
 Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat 
 She ain't got time to try and relieve ya 
 But she'll get all in your head, sativa 
 Mike G: 
 We grind, these niggas asking for some promo 
 We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos 
 Square circle jerks starting OF moshpit 
 Preaching to the poets, I'm an OF prophet 
 No less profit, fiened when we drop shit 
 Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split 
 It's that crack, give you something to sell 
 Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail 
 Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than Hell 
 And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel 
 Light skinned women, all sex everything 
 Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything 
 Everything that we call flight, living life 
 This is everything that we call hype 
 I'm everything that they call nice 
 She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right 
 Intimidated by niggas you can't be 
 I'm a G, and this is something you can't see 
 Top ranked, number one my son 
 And she looking for them trees, baby we got some 
 And stay focused on the women and you get less done 
 It's ironic 'cause I always hear you talking about one 
 Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high 
 How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly 
 You're high as fuck, damn
