My father died the day I came outta my mother's hole 
 And left the burden on my soul until I was old enough 
 To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much 
 He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt 
 Bringin' pops to school today for twelve years I cheated 
 Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and 
 Bring that dude to life then he wasn't at the meeting 
 Made a U-turn on the weather like the fuck am I thinking 
 Birthdays, Christmas my only fucking wishlish was CD's 
 And a new fitted instead I got some CD's 
 I hated, some Ritalin, some white socks 
 I was hyper 'cause I didn't get attention from my real pops 
 Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail but they don't know it's me 
 Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't go be shit 
 Well I guess I had one because nigga I'm it 
 You smell that? That's the odor of success bitch 
 I know I'm not the only bastard, in America 
 So I'm gonna need some help, on this next part, scream it with me niggas 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I graduated) 
 Without you (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Nigga eighteen (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Got a car nigga (Fuck you) 
 Eat a dick nigga, bitch 
 Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts 
 'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get 
 Now my momma mentioned the day before she would like 
 'Cause she's playin' both roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right 
 I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon, I looked up to the Hugo's and Dixon's 
 The niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen 
 Pushin' keys like them niggas that were bangin' on the Keynes 
 My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie 
 He bought me hoodie a couple albums 
 Like that's gonna make up the years and the tears 
 And the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes 
 You fuckin' dicked out, I swear to God if I see you 
 I'mma get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out 
 Cause in 16 years, you let your kid down the existence, none 
 I don't give a fuck either like father like son I'm done 
 He ain't give a fuck about me 
 He ain't give a fuck about you 
 He ain't give a fuck about we 
 So what the fuck we gon' do? 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I graduated) 
 Without you (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Nigga eighteen (I'm good) 
 Fuck you (I'm good) 
 Got a car nigga (Fuck you) 
 Eat a dick nigga, bitch 
 The cold is nice, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather 
 The skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called 
 He said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck 
 Without them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up 
 Take it to the shop, then what? 
 Fuck it, mommas proud of her asmatic thin fuck 
 Luck on my brim Supreme keeps me warm 
 When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer 
 The bummer is the fact that I'm black 
 And I hang with white neos who's nero stays frio 
 Now this consulor is tryna tell me that I'm emo, she don't give a fuck 
 D-low where's the trigger, I'll let this bullet play hero
