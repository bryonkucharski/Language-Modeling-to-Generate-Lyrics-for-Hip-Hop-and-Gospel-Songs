Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio! 
 (God I love this sample) 
 We're going to dance 
 And exercise 
 And have some fun 
 I ain't got time for these niggas 
 Better throw a watch at the boy 
 Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar 
 Who the fuck you talking to motherfucker? 
 Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches 
 Better throw a clock at these hoes 
 Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a waterhose 
 Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker? 
 Boy, I ain't got time 
 Boy, I need a Kleenex 
 How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it 
 That I got this car, so I take the scenic 
 Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix 
 First... happy birthday! 
 You bitch ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty 
 Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me 
 I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place 
 I ain't got time for these niggas 
 Better throw a watch at the boy 
 Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar 
 Who the fuck you talking to motherfucker? 
 Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches 
 Better throw a clock at these hoes 
 Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a waterhose 
 Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker? 
 Boy, I ain't got time 
 Nat Turner would be so proud of me 
 'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me 
 I bet they all looking from the crowd at me 
 And if I ask them, they would bow at me 
 But you're a house nigga, so you don't know 
 How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose 
 And my big dick and my short hair 
 'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow 
 (Hey) 
 Tick tock 
 Tick tock 
 Tick tock 
 Tick tock 
 Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill 
 When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil' 
 Next line will have 'em like "Woah" 
 I've been kissing white boys since 2004 
 One me, two feet, three mmms 
 Four, five, six years ago sucked 
 Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized 
 'Cause Vans fucked up 
 I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments 
 Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada 
 You ain't important 
 I'ma keep sporting 
 All smiles over here 
 Shout out to The Garden 
 (Tick tock) 
 (And that's a fact boy!) 
 And I just handle all my business like a chess board 
 (Tick tock, tick, tock) 
 And at them Golf boys? 
 That's my motherfucking set, boy 
 Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda 
 Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda 
 With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar 
 Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola 
 I'm getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders 
 Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster 
 Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster 
 And I break orthodox like I eat kosher 
 Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of 
 Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa 
 What's that thick odor? 
 Young Millie T 
 A young, focused black boy, oh silly me 
 (I ain't got time!) 
 Better talk shit 
 'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit 
 Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down 
 I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down 
 (Boy I ain't got time!) 
 Yeah right now 
 'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown 
 And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post 
 So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue 
 (Nigga I ain't got time!) 
 Listen man, I'm that boy 
 All you little niggas clones 
 Boy I fill that void 
 You better kill that noise 
 Turn around and remap route 
 When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth 
 Bitch 
 Tick, tock 
 Tick, tock 
 Tick, tock 
 "Fuck... hello"
