I don't want you thinking I love you 'cause I stay 
 Girl I really like you and happy we got laid 
 I think about your windows like two times in a day 
 I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved 
 Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking 
 The holy grail of your body, when you be kissin', Mrs 
 This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen 
 I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa 
 You hoping I'm joking, but first 
 I'ma eat your pussy till you tell me you can't take it 
 Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it 
 Grab my camera, nine months later little Tyler, picket fence 
 But that won't happen till I blow my load 
 I'ma eat your pussy till you tell me you can't take it 
 Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it 
 Grab my camera, nine months later little Tyler, picket fence 
 But that won't happen till I blow my load 
 Your pussy tighter than door hinges 
 I munch you like sandwiches 
 But not any more 'cause I'm on tour, so 
 Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick 
 I go hard, shit, I might need an ice pack on my wrist 
 Fucking, I'm pumping, you know it's coming 
 Bust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating, I leave you slump 
 In the back of my truck, butt naked, suck it out of me 
 I leave you with nothing, get it? 
 This is what you wanted, this is what you came for 
 I'ma eat your pussy till you tell me you can't take it 
 Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it 
 Grab my camera, nine months later little Tyler, picket fence 
 But that won't happen till I blow my load 
 You blow me away 
 With your cherry 
 (Can't breathe)
