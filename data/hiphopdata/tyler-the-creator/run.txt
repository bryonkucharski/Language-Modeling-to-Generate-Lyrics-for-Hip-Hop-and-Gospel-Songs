Fuck you running for nigga? 
 Aye nigga, come here nigga 
 Let me try that hat on 
 I told you come over here stupid bitch 
 Come over here with that weak ass hat 
 All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out 
 In the car called life take the lame route 
 Going nowhere fast but you think that you not 
 Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out 
 In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop 
 At his drop top, took another lame out 
 Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga? 
 Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga 
 Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas 
 And make sure that your mama cry the pain out 
 Now that gang is out to get you 
 But you stuck in the same house 
 Nigga never came out, wow 
 It's a shame how you got sucked in that life 
 But hey man at least you got a name now 
 They say you a "real nigga" cause you kill niggas 
 Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas 
 Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out 
 For they approval boy, you can't even hang out 
 That light you hit, it was the light I held 
 That's why you never ever see me with my chains out 
 I don't need to, truth they don't feed you 
 Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you 
 They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you 
 Better look the other way if he ever see you 
 And run as fast as you can, nigga 
 That's the shit I be talkin' bout, though 
 We ain't try'na hear that shit, my nigga 
 'Cause, stay preachy 'cause 
 Like nigga come on homie 
 I don't wanna hear that shit, preachy shit my nigga 
 Yeah, we all black, who give a fuck, 'cause? 
 I don't give a fuck, nigga 
 Whatchu mean?
