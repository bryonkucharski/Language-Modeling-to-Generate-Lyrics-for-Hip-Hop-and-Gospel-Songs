Went to Six Flags, six fags came up and said, "Ayo 
 Can we get a pic?" I said no 
 And they said, "Oh, it's Wolf Gang, 'Yonkers' 
 Goblin 
 is my shit though" 
 Now I'm like, "Fuck, I don't want to be an asshole" 
 So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon 
 With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on 
 So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath 
 'Cause some kid said I was there then they caused a riot 
 Now I'm surrounded by a twenty-five hound of fuckers tryna get a photo 
 All because they noticed the top with the box logo 
 And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear 
 Bastard 
 They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo 
 I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I?" 
 No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro? 
 "But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied 
 Until I heard 'Radicals,' the last part got to me 
 See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed 
 Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be 
 My life is just like yours, no father 
 My mama must have forgot to stop with a popped condom 
 In school, I was the one thinking outside boxes 
 So everybody in them would say that I got problems 
 So when I heard you say it, I said it back like, 'Fuck 'em' 
 You're an inspiration to niggas like me 
 Not the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats 
 I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be 
 I heard the song 'Bastard' right in the moment of heat 
 Not in summer but of course I was holding a heat gun on the edge of my feet 
 I heard that first piano chord and it drew me in like predators carrying treats 
 Then I said to myself, 'Fuck, is he speaking to me?' 
 See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat 
 I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm? 
 I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard 
 On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird) 
 That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar 
 When I see you play at the Roxy (Uh) 
 Tyler, I love you, I wanna be just like you (All right) 
 I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo) 
 Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you 
 We could play Xbox and listen to 
 In Search Of... 
 and eat donuts 
 Over conversating bout what church does 
 Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs 
 I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip 
 And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch 
 You should've took me instead (Uh, that's weird) 
 See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither 
 And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either 
 No one should see you but me in your T-shirt 
 I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt 
 Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing 
 I know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob 
 But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (Yeah, you are) 
 I ain't got a job and I went out and bought 
 Goblin 
 about five times 
 'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (All right) 
 I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees 
 I like pants that's cut, I like words like 'Fuck' 
 I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out 
 Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck?) 
 And I hit you on Twitter about ten minutes a day 
 And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a, 'Hey' (Sorry) 
 And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play 'VCR' 
 In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors" 
 All right my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic 
 So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses 
 (Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit 
 And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick 
 But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar 
 After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers 
 "Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song), sick of hearing about "Yonkers" 
 I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered 
 "Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert 
 I was at the Boston one, I got a T-shirt from Sagan 
 The one that say, 'Sagan Lockhart' and when you came out to 'Sandwitches' 
 That's when my fucking boycrush got started" 
 Just take this fucking picture man, shit
