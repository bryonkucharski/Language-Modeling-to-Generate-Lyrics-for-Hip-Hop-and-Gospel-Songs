You want me to just go with it... 
 My window is a book and I'm a fuckin' crook 
 Stealin' phones to call home but the line is off the hook 
 And if my mother answer, I'll ask her 
 What she wants on 25th because I'm chillin' with prancer 
 Rudolph, adolf, hitler 
 Rollin' with nineteen 88's like it's 1988 
 But my speakers are bleedin', the doctor's in uniform 
 Fuck cars I have a damn unicorn 
 That flies me to places, with spaceships, that don't need money 
 Where I can free at hand, eat candy with easter bunnies 
 Where donuts equal water, inhalers and mushrooms 
 And we don't have cars, we have balloons and we zoom through 
 Sound and the bass is astoundin' 
 The snare plays square no roundin' 
 Major ninth chords tower synth like it's yao ming 
 Kobe, imaginary friends, fuck homies (they don't know me) 
 The tooth fairy blow me, swallow don't shit this 
 With my donald trump hair piece you're an apprentice 
 You're fired and tired, you can't stay up like a limp dick 
 If you think you can spit then I am the fuckin' dentist 
 My visions that I record, the instruments I adore 
 The happiness that I hoard (can't be bought) at liquor stores 
 You faggots can buy chains but utopia can't afford 
 And they sore on hatin' reality that I ignore 
 You can try to walk inside my brain but I close the door 
 Fuck dogs, I roll around with my pet dinosaur 
 Yeah, hodgy beats (drop it) 
 Fuck dogs, walk around with a pet dinosaur 
 Wing flaps on the back of my pet rhinosaur 
 Gold chains, 24, niggas must be shinin' more 
 The money gets closer when you seem to be grindin' more 
 And it feels better than a tongue-kiss 
 Carbonated with the flow, orange-flavored sunkist 
 We musically grow unto the world like a fungus 
 Amongst this, playin' the piano like a trumpet 
 Little guy, but his words sound so humongous 
 Eat till you obese, arteries clot, need lunges 
 Mellowhype from ralph lauren to the hundreds 
 My crew cliqued up like brady bunch is 
 The captain that crunches, invitin' you to lunches 
 My nutrition have robots malfunction 
 I suggest you stay away from the factory 
 My breath chemical, I don't know how you'll react to me 
 It's a dog-eat-dog world so I double doggy dare it 
 Hold it in my hand as I stare it 
 Down, like a magnifyin' glass to a diamond with a karat 
 I read through niggas that bluff like a tarot 
 They copy my actions, I call them fools parrots 
 I'm the pyro with one eyelid that weareth 
 Long hair for wisdom while bitch mades nair it 
 I don't care if the heat I throw is unbearable 
 Just know, it's shareable, and there I go, where I go 
 I don't know, obviously I disappear 
 Close your eyes bitch, I'm all in your ear 
 I have your hearts as if I stabbed it with a spear 
 And wrote my flows with your blood smears 
 If you can't see a legend, I'mma make it clear: nigga I'm right here 
 Golden grill, cadillac deville (drop it) nigga we pimp 
 Grill golden, chain frozen, we pimp, we pimp, we pimp
