Got the whips, got the hoes 
 Got the ice, got the clothes 
 Niggas know that keys open doors 
 Half price nigga keep the o's 
 Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's 
 Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose 
 Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's 
 Know they know me by treat your nose 
 Look, UFO, bow, land 
 Skrr landed on the ass and 
 Adidas leaf in the grassland 
 My finger got a yellow Pac-Man 
 Blow your purple, go in circles, so inertia 
 Go reverse it, no rehearsin', gold is perfect 
 Open curtain, flow inversion, golden person 
 Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving 
 Yeah you heard me 
 Got the whips, got the hoes 
 Got the ice, got the clothes 
 Niggas know that keys open doors 
 Half price nigga keep the o's 
 Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's 
 Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose 
 Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's 
 Know they know me by treat your nose 
 Got the whips, got the hoes 
 Got the ice, got the clothes 
 Niggas know that keys open doors 
 Half price nigga keep the o's 
 Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's 
 Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose 
 Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's 
 Know they know me by treat your nose 
 My garden's full from breaking these hoes 
 A hand full of green and a couple of stones 
 Your lawnmower's foreign, you rent you a home 
 But nigga, how much of that shit do you own? 
 See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments 
 Fuck your compliments, bitch I got confidence 
 I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck 
 I do not have to adjust 
 You stuck, I'm talking 
 So shut the fuck up 
 Speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel 
 You convene with that circle of demons you're hoping them niggas'll see it 
 Results may vary 
 Chain not too heavy 
 I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than crash in that Bugatti 
 Back to the garden 
 Niggas gon' do you dirty 
 Y'all already saw it 
 Killing your flowers 
 This thing's impossible 
 It's the new slave apocalypse 
 Isn't that obvious 
 All you stupid niggas got the whips 
 Got the whips, got the hoes 
 Got the ice, got the clothes 
 Niggas know that keys open doors 
 Half price nigga keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 You gotta keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 Keep the o's 
 You gotta keep the o's 
 Keep da o's 
 You gotta keep the o's (keep the o's) 
 Cause you never know when it's over 
 You want the doors that go up 
 You want the girls with the big butts 
 You want the diamonds, you want the stones 
 You gotta stunt on these niggas 
 Stunt on these niggas one time 
 Find your wings 
 Find your wings 
 Find your wings 
 And fly 
 Cause you'll find your wings 
 You'll find your wings 
 Learn how to fly (learn) 
 Let me tell you what I want you to do 
 What I want you to do 
 You'll find your wings 
 You'll find your wings 
 Learn how to fly 
 (Learn) 
 Keep the o's 
 I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now 
 What the fuck has gotten into me, man
