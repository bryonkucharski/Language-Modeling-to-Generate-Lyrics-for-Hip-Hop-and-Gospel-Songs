(Call me, call me, call me) Uh 
 (Call me, call me, call me) Uh 
 (Call me, call me, call me) Uh 
 (Call me, call me, call me) 
 (Call me) How you doin'? 
 (Call me) My name is Lonely, nice to meet you 
 Here's my number 
 You can reach me, woo! 
 (Call me) 
 911, call me some time 
 (You should call me) 
 911, call me some time 
 911 (You should call me, oh) 
 911 (Call me) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 My thirst levels are infinity and beyond 
 Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé 
 Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion 
 Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon 
 Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show 
 Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row 
 I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker 
 If you fit description, hit me on my beeper 
 At that 911 
 Call me some time (ring, ring, ring) 
 Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click) 
 Call me some time (ring, ring, ring) 
 Please bang my line 
 Call me 
 911, call me some time 
 You should call me 
 911, call me some time 
 911, (you should call me, oh) 
 911, (you should call me) 
 Chirp, chirp 
 Chirp, chirp 
 Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds 
 Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve 
 These days you gotta find time 
 Even the night line 
 Work line 
 Dial nine 
 Five car garage 
 Full tank of the gas 
 But that don't mean nothing, nothing 
 Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger 
 I'm the loneliest man alive 
 But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off 
 I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues 
 If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911... 
 Part II: Mr. Lonely 
 I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck 
 Old lonely ass nigga 
 I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck 
 Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something 
 I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck 
 Old weird ass nigga 
 I can't even lie, I've been 
 Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely 
 They say the loudest in the room is weak 
 That's what they assume, but I disagree 
 I say the loudest in the room 
 Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me) 
 Attention seeker, public speaker 
 Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely 
 Writin' songs about these people 
 Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony 
 One thing I know, is that I wanna 
 Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago 
 Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low 
 You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo 
 From the start it's been real dark 
 It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh 
 I'm playin' like Hasbro 
 I'm really Saari, call me Arto 
 Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla 
 I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt) 
 But what the fuck else do you want from me? 
 That is the only thing keepin' me company 
 Purchase some things until I'm annoyed 
 These items is fillin' the void 
 Been fillin' it for so long 
 I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh) 
 Current battle as an adult 
 My partner is a shadow 
 I need love, do you got some I could borrow? 
 Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow 
 But that never comes 
 Like a vasectomy, what have I done? 
 I got the talent, the face and the funds 
 Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who) 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall (who) 
 The loneliest of them all (me) 
 Cupid actin' stupid 
 Do you got another number I could call? 
 Never had a pet 
 I've never had a pet 
 There's more fish in the sea 
 But I never had a goldfish to begin with 
 I never had a dog 
 So I've never been good with bitches 
 'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch 
 I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet 
 Treat me like direct deposit 
 Check in on me sometime 
 Ask me how I'm really doin' 
 So I never have to press that 911 
 Oh! Damn! Damn!
