(Feat. Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Hodgy Beats and Mike G) 
 (Intro: Dr. TC) 
 Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here 
 For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper 
 But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you 
 Because, they're really worried about you 
 I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you 
 (Verse 1: Domo) 
 It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines 
 When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times 
 Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line 
 Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime 
 In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest 
 And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas 
 I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit 
 I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this 
 I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now 
 30 thousand feet gonna make it hard for me to simmer down 
 Another flight, another beat, another city, wow 
 Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out 
 Where we at? We on top of the world 
 (Verse 2: Frank) 
 And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park 
 I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back 
 Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs 
 All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact 
 Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat 
 Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through 
 And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black 
 Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at 
 Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel 
 Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt 
 Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back 
 We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat 
 Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's 
 Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? 
 (Verse 3: Hodgy) 
 Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team 
 Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green 
 Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed 
 Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds 
 We at Randy's ordering that 306 
 Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me 
 Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song 
 Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur 
 No longer, but we working, premature, immature 
 She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt 
 On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door 
 Chased an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption 
 Impregnate the dream till it has an abortion 
 Where we at? We on top of the world 
 (Verse 4: Mike) 
 Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing 
 Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend 
 Always been the most cool, they chase our shade 
 They say life switches pace when you got shit made 
 So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days 
 When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane 
 And too often they think that they could stop me 
 Now every show we makin' half a Maserati 
 And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi 
 Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me 
 Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey 
 Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard 
 I got the world saying every single Friday is black 
 Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know 
 Where we at nigga? We on top of the world 
 (Interlude: Tyler) 
 Where we at, niggas? 
 Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh 
 Where we at? 
 (Verse 5: Tyler) 
 Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh 
 Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir 
 You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt 
 Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert 
 My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook 
 Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook 
 My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either 
 I ain't signed a fucking deal yet but when I do 
 Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages that 
 Could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage 
 Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon 
 From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill 
 Shit is getting real, people begin to feel 
 Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals 
 About some shit, they bitch and pout (Can we get backstage man?) 
 No, faggot, it's sold out (Come on why you holding out 
 I though we was boys, without me, you wouldn't be Tyler the Creator 
 You're from the Derby, I can tell whenever you perform 
 A leopard can't change it's spots) But I'm a fucking unicorn 
 (Whatever man) Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty 
 Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi 
 Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be 
 And I be where, anybody cares 
 I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams, and have fun" 
 (Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some 
 (Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side 
 Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one? 
 When I'm on that stage I feel important 
 A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin 
 Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him 
 You gotta be fucking kidding me 
 At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero 
 And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics 
 Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere 
 It's smelling like teen spirit... okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building
