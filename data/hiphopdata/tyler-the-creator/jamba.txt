Papa ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you) 
 But now my balls balls deep in this broad's jaw, swallow girl, it's just nut 
 Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass 
 Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag 
 Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin 
 Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge 
 Hodgy, pass me my inhaler 
 I'm sicking of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome 
 I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense 
 Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" 
 Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty 
 Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity 
 Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience 
 Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch 
 Shut 'em down 
 Nigga, shut 'em down 
 Shut 'em down 
 G 
 Hodgy Beats: 
 I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt 
 Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch 
 Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up 
 So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss 
 You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus 
 I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up 
 I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert 
 I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt 
 I can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt 
 It's on your shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first 
 Fuck a human nurse, I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth 
 Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew 
 You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view 
 Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf 
 Then meet your kids after school and give them drugs 'cause it's cool, fucker 
 Tyler, The Creator: 
 Shut 'em down 
 Nigga, shut 'em down 
 Shut 'em down 
 Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed 
 That shit I need, be the shit that's green 
 A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets 
 About three or four more than needed be 
 I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape 
 I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes 
 You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is 
 Always covered in flakes, enough for two shake blunts, and what the fuck is this? Uh 
 I think this Mary is laced, my heart is beating at paces 
 That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients, shit, I'm stuck like tape 
 That's super glued to the center of Kelly Price first waist 
 It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary 
 The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted 
 Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm 
 Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit 
 Shut 'em down 
 Domo Genesis: 
 C'mon, my nigga, you don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga 
 You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga 
 You're as weak ass fuck, your butt my nigga 
 Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro 
 Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel
