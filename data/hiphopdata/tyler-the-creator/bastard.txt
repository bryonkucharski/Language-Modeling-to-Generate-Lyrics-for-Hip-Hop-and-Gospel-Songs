Yo, yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right and any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit 
 Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas 
 Now back to the album 
 Dr. TC: 
 Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC 
 And um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving 
 Um, it's gonna be three sessions, today, tomorrow, and the next day 
 So, just tell me something about yourself 
 Well look, if you don't talk, I mean these sessions are going to go slower 
 Tyler, The Creator: 
 This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep 
 Some food for thought, this food for death, go ahead and fucking eat 
 My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet 
 I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed 
 Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed 
 This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son 
 My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent 
 That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers 
 Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording 
 I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves 
 Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental 
 Simple but probably not, fuck 'em 
 I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck 
 Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked 
 Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort 
 Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard 
 Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on 
 'Cause this album pack enough evil 
 That you can't fit inside a Jansport 
 Go to school with this 
 I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week 
 Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?" 
 I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet 
 Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit 
 No to drugs I never spark it 
 I used to be bullied for honor classes by those that were slow as molasses 
 Take this shit to school 
 Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger 
 She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her 
 Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler 
 All because she said no to homecoming, demons running 
 Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts 
 I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught 
 Go to sleep 
 I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky 
 "Fuck me," the monster said, somehow the monster's dead 
 Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil 
 With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble 
 I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either 
 A fucking sin or too illegal 
 Play this shit in church 
 Tyler, The Creator and Dr. TC: 
 I graduated without honors or fucking father 
 He died (I'm so sorry), no bitch, don't even fucking bother 
 I wanted a brother my mother I told her 
 But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada 
 So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation 
 That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys 
 Tyler, The Creator: 
 I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me 
 But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly 
 I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch eleven 
 Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend 
 I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition 
 I created OF 'cause I feel we're more talented 
 Than forty year old rappers talking about Gucci 
 When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers 
 With the same problem, the only way to solve 'em 
 Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver 
 Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it 
 Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious 
 'Cause my mother let me do what I want 
 She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear 
 The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid 
 My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit 
 My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents 
 When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share 
 This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy 
 I'm bad for you kids to listen to, soy is not the choice 
 I'm bad milk, drink it 
 Dr. TC: 
 Well, um, it seems you had a lot to say 
 And uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating 
 Tyler, The Creator: 
 My wrist is all red from the cutter 
 Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer 
 Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah 
 Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever 
 My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing 
 But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing 
 With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen 
 'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing 
 Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries 
 Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy 
 Losers can never win me, you can never offend me 
 My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mama will attend the 
 Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal 
 This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this 
 Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email 
 So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail 
 Dr. TC: 
 Wow, um, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something 
 What would you tell him?
