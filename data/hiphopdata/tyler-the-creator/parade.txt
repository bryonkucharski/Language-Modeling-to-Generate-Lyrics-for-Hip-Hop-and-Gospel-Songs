 Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without able 
 I can make music that makes sense, but not meant to be stable 
 Eighteen with the whole world in front of me 
 Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we

 I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk 
 I skip to places, smilin' faces, while you fuckin' walk 
 My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that Twilight shit 
 You have highlights about your life, I have half of my high life bitch 
 Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid 
 Watch them grow and then you die? No, nigga fuck the system

 Good kids make bad grown ups 
 Stay gold, stray old, maturin' means that your life sucks 
 In my wolf suit, I roam where the wild things at 
 Still growin', still learnin', not knowin' that I'm Matt 
 I don't wanna grow up, I know that shit for a fact, nigga eighteen

 They say I'm immature, I say that they depressed 
 I talk to unicorns, I'm wearin' a uniform 
 Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time 
 You live your life all serious while I'm enjoyin' mine
