Niggas at the fuckin' mall, niggas where my fuckin' drawers? 
 Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch you fuckin' know my dad 
 He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick 
 You's a fag, you like that shit, O.F. is the fuckin' clique 
 I'm goin' off the top of the brain 
 Nigga don't know how to rap but I'm in the game 
 Fuck that shit, I don't give a fuck 
 I'm back up in the fuckin' club, niggas know I'm at the mall 
 Eatin' chips with my drawers, how you doing? How you fall? 
 Swag, swag, swag, swag 
 Tina perm your fuckin' weave 
 Eat my ass, lick my balls 
 Bitch I'm in the fuckin' mall, with my niggas eatin' ham 
 Bitch I got that fuckin' swag, you don't know my fuckin' dad 
 I don't know my fuckin' dad, what is this a fuckin' purse? 
 I ain't fuckin' Mexican, but we can have sex again 
 With your sister with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex) 
 What the fuck? That's your fuckin' brother? I ain't with that jerkin' shit 
 Unless it's Steve Harvey's buff sister tryna jerk my dick 
 Swag, swag, swag, swag 
 Tina perm your fuckin' weave 
 I'm with your girlfriend eatin' chips 
 Mmm, stop the beat, bitch... 
 All right, yeah, nigga, I was in the mall 
 With my niggas bustin' triggers, yeah, swag 
 Swag, swag, swag, swag 
 Tina perm your fuckin' weave 
 Bitches, hoes, weaves, leather jackets 
 Bitches, weaves, hoes, leather jackets 
 Bitches, weaves, hoes, swag
