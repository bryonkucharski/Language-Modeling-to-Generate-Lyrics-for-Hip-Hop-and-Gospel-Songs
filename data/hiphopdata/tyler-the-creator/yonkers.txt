Odd Wolf Haley, Golf Wang 
 I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no I'm not 
 Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar 
 Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars 
 Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks 
 Bedrock, harder than a muthafuckin' Flintstone 
 Makin' crack rocks outta pissy nigga fishbones 
 This nigga Jasper tryna get grown 
 About 5'7" of his bitches in my bedroom 
 Swallow the cinnamon, I'mma scribble this sinnin' shit 
 While Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men 
 (Syd, shut the fuck up) Here's the number to my therapist 
 (Shit) Tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

 Fuck you 
 Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses 
 I told him to quit bitchin' and this isn't a fuckin' hotline 
 For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh I already got mine 
 And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time (damn) 
 I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal 
 This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nines 
 This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine 
 But after bowlin', I went home to some damn Adventure Time 
 (What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Zannies (yeah?) 
 And danced around the house in all-over print panties 
 My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me 
 I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin 
 (What you think of Hayley Williams?) Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them 
 I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that faggot nigga B.o.B is in 
 And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus 
 And won't stop until the cops come in 
 I'm an over achiever, so how 'bout I start a team of leaders 
 And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver (oh) 
 Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant gold retrievers 
 All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need 'em 
 But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em 
 In some cookin' books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em 
 Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves 
 It's been a couple months, and Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave, damn

 They say success is the best revenge 
 So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in 
 Oh, not again, another critic writin' report 
 I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a Pitchfork (uh) 
 Still suicidal? I am 
 I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand 
 I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head 
 And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch 
 (What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G 
 I just wanna know if my father would ever like me 
 But I don't give a fuck so he's probably just like me 
 A muthafuckin' Goblin 
 (Fuck everythin', man) That's what my conscience said 
 Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead 
 Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement 
 Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit 
 Dead
