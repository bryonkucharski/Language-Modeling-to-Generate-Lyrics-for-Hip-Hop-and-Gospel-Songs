Okay, okay, okay, okay 
 Okay, okay, oh 
 You live in my dream state 
 Relocate my fantasy 
 I stay in reality 
 You live in my dream state 
 Anytime I count sheep 
 That's the only time we make up 
 You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 20/20, 20/20 vision 
 Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye 
 Wonder if you look both ways 
 When you cross my mind, I said, I said 
 I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing 
 You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I 
 I can only see your face when I close my eyes 
 Can I get a kiss? 
 And can you make it last forever? 
 I said I'm 'bout to go to war 
 And I don't know if I'ma see you again 
 Can I get a kiss? (Can I) 
 And can you make it last forever? (Can you) 
 I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to) 
 I don't know if I'ma see you again 
 (Uh, switch it up) 
 I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation 
 Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? - Love 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you 
 I've been looking, stop the waiting 
 'Fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic 
 You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean? 
 It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes 
 Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene 
 Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie 
 Yeugh!

 And can you make it last forever? (Oh, forever)
