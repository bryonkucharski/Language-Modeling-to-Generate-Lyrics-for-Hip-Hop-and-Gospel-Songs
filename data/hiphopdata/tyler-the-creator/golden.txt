(Intro: Dr. TC) 
 Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems 
 And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say? 
 Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more 
 Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts 
 I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work 
 They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out 
 My friends are turning into opposites 
 Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist 
 And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick 
 Harder than the white kids that copy shit 
 Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about 
 All alone, bawling till my mothafuckin' eyes bleed 
 See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting 
 When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man 
 Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance 
 For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant 
 Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him 
 See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend 
 When I say Odd, y'all say Future 
 Odd... uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck 
 (Tyler, you have a cult following) 
 To these white kids? 
 Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats 
 Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see 
 Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see 
 Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee 
 So while my wallet's piling with symbolic colored paper 
 I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age 
 20, why didn't she get that abortion? 
 Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing 
 Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan 
 Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster 
 Mom works hard, still working on her masters 
 Son lies about, taking classes at community college 
 Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard 
 Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way 
 Before he even had a mustache and cash 
 And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher 
 I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table! 
 I'm a grab the Nina and find a nice arena 
 'Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Suprema 
 And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon 
 With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back 
 And a life that's full of crap, and a finger filled with hate 
 And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract 
 I can finally be one like a marriage in a church 
 But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one 
 That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him 
 Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse 
 All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse 
 So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse 
 So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse 
 This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt 
 That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos 
 He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse 
 And then the nurse blurts 
 (What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here) 
 Why didn't anybody ask him first? 
 (I've been asking you this whole time) 
 Because nobody gave a fuck 
 (Someone gave a fuck Tyler 
 And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me 
 See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler 
 I know everything, I know everything about you 
 You've been helping yourself this whole time 
 Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination 
 Dr. TC, see Tyler, I'm your conscience 
 I'm Tron Cat, I'm Ace, I'm Wolf Haley, I'm...) 
 Me
