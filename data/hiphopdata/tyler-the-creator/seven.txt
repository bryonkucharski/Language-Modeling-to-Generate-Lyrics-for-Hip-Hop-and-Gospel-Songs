I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders 
 I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent 
 At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxin' at Happy Camper 
 It's the fuckin' financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxin', I'm taxin' 
 "Fuck 'em all!" I'm chantin', don't complain I'm just rantin' 
 Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot 
 I'm a liar like Carrey in "Liar, Liar" 
 I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, Cable guy like Larry 
 Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies 
 I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste 
 Fuck it, Odd Future some nazis, black nazis don't copy 
 We perfect, you sloppy, huddled and slightly tacky 
 Fucking lame on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet 
 Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett 
 Endotherms and jaguars, drug dealers and crackers 
 Able students and slackers 
 I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93 
 Escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl born in a ramp 
 That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS 
 Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress 
 With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny 
 Sup on my hat like that motherfucker Frannie 
 White, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie 
 She dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me 
 Fuck you bunches here, never disrespect my family 
 That's for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie 
 Wasted fuckin' youth? All you old niggas antiques 
 We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy 
 Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy 
 Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be 
 Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot 
 I guess I gotta be a fuckin' hand-me-down rapper 
 From Los Angee area anytime I'm fuckin' landing 
 Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Track 
 Them motherfuckers could never get rid of me 
 Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy 
 Get these fuckin' hip hop bloggers to start feelin' me 
 Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats 
 Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine 
 Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fuckin' skinny jeans 
 And follow in your footsteps like a motherfuckin' millipede 
 Centipede, make songs about Gucci and cigaweed 
 Jerk with my friends like it's some motherfuckin' little league 
 No I ain't no fucking hipster, mister 
 No I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me 
 Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo 
 I'm drivin' in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fuckin' drunk 
 Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk 
 My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked 
 (Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke? 
 Fuck everybody here, everybody vanish, I'll manage 
 Hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwitch 
 Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish 
 Fuck you, faggot (Fuckin' Bastard) 
 Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record 
 I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period 
 But um, I didn't mean to offend anyone, all right, I'm lying, OF
