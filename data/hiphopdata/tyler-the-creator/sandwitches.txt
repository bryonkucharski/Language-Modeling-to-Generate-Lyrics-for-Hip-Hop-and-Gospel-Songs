(Intro: Tyler) 
 Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature 
 Fuck you think I made Odd Future for? 
 To wear fucking suits and make good decisions? 
 Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang 
 (Verse 1: Tyler) 
 Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck 
 Who cries about his daddy and a blog because his music sucks? (I did!) 
 Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough 
 And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry) 
 Full of shit, like I ate that John 
 Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong 
 Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom 
 With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns 
 Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit 
 Like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playing with dick 
 I'm jealous as shit, 'cause I ain't got no home meal to come to 
 So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you" 
 I got ten of these Kennedy's 
 Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery 
 'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy 
 I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96 
 It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks 
 Surprised she hasn't taked the nasty dick inside her alley you 
 The Golf Wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again 
 And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again 
 I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me 
 Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries 
 Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be 
 Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh 
 Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang 
 It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang 
 It's the Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang 
 It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang 
 It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang 
 Wolf Gang, triple six crew 
 It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang 
 Wolf Gang kill them 
 (Verse 2: Hodgy) 
 My love is gone for you mommy, you could ride in hearses 
 I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this? 
 You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect 
 Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches 
 Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it 
 In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch 
 You told me God was the answer 
 When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer 
 I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel 
 Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle 
 Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr 
 (Verse 3: Hodgy) 
 It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now 
 I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground 
 I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds 
 "My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds" 
 'Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks 
 I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank 
 (Tyler) 
 Free Earl, that's the fucking shit 
 And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks 
 Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique 
 Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six 
 Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches 
 We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch 
 And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots 
 Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box
