They don't paint pictures, they just trace me 
 Odd Future, I'm your muthafuckin' sergeant 
 Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive 
 'Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price 
 No bargin', nigga that's a bargain 
 Cow print t-shirt like muthafuckin' dog 
 On the muthafuckin' farm with cockadoodle doodles 
 I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle 
 And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles 
 Felines on the freetime, I'm tossin' bitches' salads 
 And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan 
 We was flyin' to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok 
 Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock 
 To Soho, baby, Milo so dope 
 The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane 
 Niggas get the picture, I see, why? 
 (They don't paint pictures, they just trace me) 
 My nigga, no hook 
 No hook, fuck a hook 
 Yo, beside me, nobody likes me 
 Mainly because I am not a fuckin' HypeBeast 
 I think Supreme suck, we gnarly all our Nikes 
 I can wear some Wranglers, with a fuckin' White T 
 Doo-rags to match, and I do sag 
 In fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu poor over 
 Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range 
 And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange 
 And I'm the only fuckin' rapper without a chain 
 With a four finger ring like I can't spell my fuckin' name 
 And I go to Obama rallies screamin' out "McCain!" 
 Them ignorant thrashin' muthafuckers is my gang 
 And the dirty Ladera I can't forget where I came from 
 Nigga, you don't claim none, fan I am the teacher 
 White and black bitch like she's a muthafuckin' zebra 
 Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter 
 My nigga, no hook 
 No hook, fuck a hook 
 (It's gold) The gold is in the back 
 (It's gold) The pixels in the front 
 (It's gold) The beat's a fuckin' bully 
 (Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man 
 (Gold) The pink is in the sky 
 (That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind 
 (It's gold) The mind is in my gold 
 The beat is turnin' old, so go 
 Synthesizer, I'm the muthafuckin' master 
 Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys 
 Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song 
 And a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic 
 Nigga, you can bite this, unless you wanna bite back 
 I didn't take my fuckin' Ritalin, this is a hype track 
 HypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit 
 I had you motherfuckers eatin' salad like a fat bitch 
 Drop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.N, bangin' on your FM 
 Ace the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to HypeBeast
