If this was a game 
 I already know that I would come out winner 
 And I'm not braggin', I'mma be in her 
 But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner 
 My steak good, I got a good cut like splinter 
 Juicy and hot such a black bitch temper 
 Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender 
 But I don't give a fuck and keep her list'in like Schindler 
 She's cute but her forehead's big 
 Got stretch marks like she got four kids 
 Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco 
 That O.J. killed the white hos with 
 A wealthy white girl without the facelift 
 Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet 
 Leave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that 
 I'm a muthafuckin' sellout and a rapist 
 Baby, you're an angel 
 How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort? 
 You already know you're dead 
 Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course 
 I stuff you in the trunk, drunk 
 Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow 
 If this was a game 
 I would be considered a muthafuckin' legend 
 And I ain't tryna gas you up like Chevron 
 But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage 
 Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of uh 
 Tryna find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet 
 Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck so now 
 It's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit 
 You're very attractive, and notice that 
 My hat is always the color of cactus 
 And I hang with wolves 'cause I'm an evil Bastard 
 Pictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered 
 Met you at my school, departed at my house 
 Ended at your panties, started at your blouse 
 Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch 
 If you wanted a date, don't come 
 Now you gotta make it easy for me don't run 
 You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum 
 And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun 
 Wait now it's about eight somethin' 
 It's late and you stuck in my base-one 
 Come downstairs with nothin' but a shoe string 
 Yeah bitch this date's done 
 Baby, you're an angel 
 How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort? 
 You already know you're dead 
 Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course 
 I stuff you in the trunk, drunk 
 Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow 
 I like my girls how I like my drugs, white 
 Lord, you're so pretty, lyin' in my arms 
 I just got one request, stop breathin'
