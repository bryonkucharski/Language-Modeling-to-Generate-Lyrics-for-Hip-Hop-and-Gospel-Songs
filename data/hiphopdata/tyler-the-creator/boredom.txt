 Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious 
 I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em 
 If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em 
 I've been in this fuckin' room so long 
 My eyeballs are turning to dry wall 
 My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em 
 "Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day 
 What the fuck is the problem? Is it me? 
 'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

 Bored and getting desperate as hell 
 Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will 
 Message me with some plans that are amusing as well 
 'Cause I haven't seen the exit of these walls since before this morning 
 Morning, morning, morning, morning 
 (Morning, oh, what the fuck?) 
 Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance 
 My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order 
 But I hate eating solo 
 Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots 
 And sunsets at the border, yeah 
 Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone 
 I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone 
 So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going 
 Like I have no idea where I'm going 
 Tick tock
