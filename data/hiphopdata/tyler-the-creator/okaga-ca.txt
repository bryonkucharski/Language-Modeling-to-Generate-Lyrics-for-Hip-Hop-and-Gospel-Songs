Let's just run away from here ('cause it's not, 'cause it's not) 
 Working out on Earth, my dear (cause It's not, 'cause it's not) 
 What you really want girl (ooh) 
 My heart stops pumping blood, when I see you (I see you, when I see you) 
 But try to play it cool because (I like you, I really like you) 
 Girl, you're so special 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me... 
 Let's move to California 
 Right now (pack your bags, go pack your bags) 
 I have wings on my back, so we don't (take the plane, have to take the plane) 
 Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes 
 (Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified) 
 Oh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care 
 (When you rub my hands switching fifth gear) 
 Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby) 
 'Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (we're gonna go flyin' to the moon) 
 Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, did you pack your bags) 
 Leave your crew, bring your coat, 'cause it's cold (leave your crew, bring your coat) 
 Girl, you're so special 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me 
 To me, to me (oh) 
 (Don't you wanna go back) 
 (Let's go, let's go) 
 (Right now) 
 I think I believe you (Let me show you how girl) 
 It's nice that I need to 
 The earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff 
 What, what, what (She would love that) 
 I think I believe you 
 Take me higher 
 Let's make our way over 
 To the Okaga cave 
 Today (today) 
 There we will stay, play it cool now 
 X-Y-Z how? 
 Welcome me in 
 Then we'll begin 
 Suckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair 
 Fastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh 
 Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me 
 When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy, oh 
 Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars 
 From my fake space fog machine 
 Laying on my arm, it's dead 
 From the pressure of your head 
 I said I loved you, said it back 
 Like it was scripted, but you meant it 
 Like the flavor of that lemonade 
 That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date 
 Oh, you think you special now? 
 Other bitches trippin' now 
 'Cause we're fleeing to the moon 
 Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all 
 Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah, let's go to the moon! 
 Oh yeah, let's go to the moon! 
 Oh yeah (Let's go!) 
 Oh yeah, let's go to the moon! 
 Oh yeah, let's go to the moon! 
 (Watch this) Let's go to the moon! 
 Oh yeah 
 (Favorite director) 
 (Gonna be good) 
 Come on, baby 
 What you wanna do? 
 (I'll be okay) 
 (I really like you) 
 Take me away 
 Fuck what they say 
 To another place 
 Another day 
 We in outer space 
 We'll waste our days 
 Sade, Sade, Sade (sade) 
 Oh, right now ([?]) 
 Yes! 
 Let's go to the moon (Yes!) 
 (?) 
 (It's about to start)
