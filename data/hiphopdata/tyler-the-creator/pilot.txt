Fly with the birds in the wind 
 Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when? 
 On a scale from nine to ten 
 You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind 
 Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off 
 I got your attention, motherfucker I'm bout to take off 
 I'm the new pilot in this bitch 
 And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip 
 But I do bring a terror like I hate America 
 A brand new camera and a parachute 
 Nigga you and I are not the same, we not parallel 
 Don't talk to me 'fore I fuckin' embarrass you 
 Now sit your ass down you doin' three much 
 I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up 
 Or you'll get fucked up 
 I'm so far ahead you niggas I'm in the future 
 Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you 
 You niggas, I'm sayin', look, y'all be on the stupid shit 
 I'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess 
 I'm the fuckin' bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it 
 The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it 
 If anything happens its one door 
 If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for 
 I'mma hit a couple of 'em up this is Parkour 
 Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga 
 And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches 
 But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless 
 I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore 
 I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face 
 Till there's nothing left in the gas tank 
 I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore 
 I don't wanna crash anymore 
 I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face 
 Till there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash 
 I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah 
 Uh, 'cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah 
 Uh, 'cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah 
 It's kinda weird 
 'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach 
 I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at 
 A place where I can be 
 With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at 
 You can buy a car, you can buy many things 
 You can buy happiness but you can't buy wings 
 You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot 
 But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic 
 To stay cloud level 
 That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach 
 'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach 
 It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world but 
 You in first class but you feel like coach, damn 
 That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach 
 I don't wanna --
