(Verse 1: Frank Ocean) 
 Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets) 
 On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock) 
 New girl moved on the block (on the block) 
 She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock) 
 Last night I slept over hers (over hers) 
 During sex, I overheard (I overheard) 
 A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na 
 Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa 
 Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash 
 Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass 
 A real ninja with the blade and the mask 
 Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks 
 Now she tryna patch me up, but 
 Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust 
 If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol 
 But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude 
 (Hook: Frank Ocean) 
 The blinds wide open so he can 
 See you in the dark when you're sleepin' 
 Think about it, fresh out the shower 
 You touch yourself after hours 
 Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom 
 You're sleeping alone in your bed 
 But check your window, he's at your window 
 (Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator) 
 The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites 
 I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right 
 You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight 
 But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight 
 We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck 
 You can tell me all your problems like I really give one 
 But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want 
 Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy 
 See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front 
 But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we 
 We as including I and yourself, making three 
 Little ones (?) pretty hard if you ask me 
 You're a pretty broad in the top three 
 Of things that I've been waiting to come, so 
 Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then 
 We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time 
 (Bridge: Tyler, The Creator) 
 One, two, you're the girl that I want 
 Three, four, five, six, seven, shit 
 Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this 
 And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous 
 Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous 
 I just wanna drag you're lifeless body to the forest 
 And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with 
 You... cunt 
 (Bridge 2: Tyler, The Creator) 
 I just wanna talk, and conversate 
 'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate 
 And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date 
 So just say yes, let the future fall into place 
 I just wanna talk, and conversate 
 'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate 
 And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date 
 So just say yes, let the future fall into place... cunt
