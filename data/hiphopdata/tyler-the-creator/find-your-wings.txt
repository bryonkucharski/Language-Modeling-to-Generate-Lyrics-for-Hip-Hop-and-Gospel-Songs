Find your wings (Supposed to fly) 
 Find your wings (Find your wings) 
 Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'? 
 Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot 
 You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin' 
 The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta 
 Find your wings (Fly) 
 Find your wings (Find your wings) 
 (My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy) 
 We can go down to the rainbows 
 Don't let your high keep your brain low 
 You're a bird 
 You're supposed to fly away 
 The way you stand there 
 Don't let your wings go to waste (Go to waste) 
 The sky is your home, be free 
 Be free
