Uhm, I said, the party isn't over 
 We can still dance, but I don't have no rhythm 
 So fucking take a chance with me 
 The party isn't over, we can still dance girl 
 But I don't have no rhythm 
 So fucking take a chance with a nigga 
 Like me, like me 
 Uhm, I said, the party isn't over 
 We can still dance, but I don't have no rhythm 
 So fucking take a chance with me 
 The party isn't over, we can still dance girl 
 But I don't have no rhythm 
 So fucking take a chance with a nigga 
 Like me, like me 
 Yeah, uhm 
 All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows 
 Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned 
 I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good 
 On this brand new jacket 
 The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin 
 Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here 
 Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys 
 Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking 
 I centered the mellow over the graham 
 Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand 
 Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it 
 Camping with my niggas, it's so fucking exciting 
 We're making smores by the campfire 
 Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer 
 Sat by the fire, do witness gentle 
 Transformation cease to be mindless 
 Create your sweetness 
 You remind me of my bimmer 
 A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater 
 You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up 
 But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter 
 You remind me of my bimmer 
 See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up 
 And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em 
 But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter 
 So let me start it up and smash 
 Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame impala 
 (And it's dark outside) 
 And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow 
 You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up 
 Run my fingers through 'em as you wax and buff my muffler 
 'Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up? 
 Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill 
 (Ride for) 
 Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs 
 And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah 
 You remind me of my bimmer 
 A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater 
 You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up 
 But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter 
 You remind me of my bimmer 
 See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up 
 And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em 
 But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter 
 So let me start it up and smash 
 Mmmm, It'll get dark outside soon (ride for it) 
 Where the streetlights sing (ride for it) 
 You don't have to lie girl to kick it its cool 
 We moving slow 
 You remind me of my bimmer 
 A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater 
 You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up 
 But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter 
 You remind me of my bimmer, smash 
 You remind me of my bimmer
