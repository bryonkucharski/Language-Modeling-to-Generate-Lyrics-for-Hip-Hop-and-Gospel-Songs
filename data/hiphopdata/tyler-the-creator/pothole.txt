My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand 
 To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man 
 His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props 
 He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop 
 So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact 
 That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back 
 The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that? 
 (How I ain't see that?) 
 Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac 
 I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help 
 But what you want for some, some niggas really don't want for themself 
 Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma 
 And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt) 
 So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk- 
 -Ward, and I heard through some words that you're off it 
 I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path 
 And crash and get distracted 
 But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain 
 Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all throw so much shade 
 And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front 
 I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump 
 Just let me know, my nigga 
 I had to switch gears on 'em 
 Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!) 
 I had to switch gears on 'em 
 You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em 
 Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Snakes in the grass, but I walk 
 I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF 
 So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk 
 I left the condom in the grass so fuck off 
 Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it 
 Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted 
 I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin' 
 The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon 
 Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely 
 All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies 
 But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things 
 That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please 
 Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf 
 Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool 
 Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool 
 Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece 
 See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw 
 Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows? 
 One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay" 
 But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four 
 I just want that garden and that Batmobile 
 Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile 
 Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards 
 But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles 
 Now keep it pushin', nigga 
 I had to switch gears on 'em 
 Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!) 
 I had to switch gears on 'em 
 You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em 
 Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole 
 Fuck, okay, next one 
 Do-do-do-do-do-do 
 Gotta watch out for the potholes 
 Ooh, said watch out for the potholes 
 Haha
