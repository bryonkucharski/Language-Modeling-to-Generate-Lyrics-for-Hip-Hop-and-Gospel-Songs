Ayo 
 Let's take it back to them days 
 Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor 
 Carpet was my baby mama 
 80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured 
 Rent-A-Center calling everyday 
 Nobody home, they're knocking on the door 
 Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt 
 In toys I only dreamed that I could afford 
 Now I roll through Okaga, California 
 I ride to California 
 These frog oval goggles 
 I'm leaning out the window 
 OJ shining on me 
 Simp-Sun shining on me 
 Slick circles floating 
 Out this world 
 Yeah yeah 
 Run it, run it, run it, run it 
 I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow (I glow) 
 I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow) 
 I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow) 
 I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow 
 (Let's go!) 
 Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that may just be my ego 
 But don't be too cool, you may freeze 
 Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice) 
 Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt 
 (Stunt on these niggas) 
 Tell these black kids they could be who they are 
 Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too 
 Look, I smell like Chanel 
 I never mall grip with my manicured nails 
 I coconut oil the skin 
 I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin' 
 But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning 
 Went from statistic to millionaire 
 CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark 
 But they forget when I get in my car 
 I'm leaning out the window 
 OJ shining on me 
 Simp Sun shining on me 
 Slick circles floating 
 Vro we off this world 
 Run it, run it, run it, yeah 
 I glow (I glow) 
 I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow) 
 I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow) 
 I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I- 
 (Let's go!) 
 Flower boy T, nigga that's me 
 Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree 
 Took a little while, nigga making leaves 
 Keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat 
 Favorite color green, energy is strong 
 Giving niggas life like birdies and the beez 
 Dropping them seeds, not what you want 
 You don't know what I keep in the trunk... tree 
 Ah, shit! 
 Run it, run it, run it, run it 
 Run it 
 Run it 
 Run it
