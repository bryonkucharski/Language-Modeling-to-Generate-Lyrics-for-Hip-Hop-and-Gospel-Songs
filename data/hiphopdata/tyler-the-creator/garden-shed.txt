Don't kill a rose 
 Before it could bloom 
 Fly, baby, fly 
 Out the cocoon 
 You don't have to lie 
 I can smell it in your eyes 
 That there's something more to say, baby 
 Them words 
 Damn, run me back, yeah 
 If I could, if I could 
 If you could 
 Find the words to say 
 Find the words to say 
 Find the words 
 In the garden 
 Shed 
 Go 
 Don't kill a rose 
 Before it could bloom 
 Fly, baby, fly 
 Out the cocoon 
 Ayo 
 Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed 
 For the garden 
 That is where I was hidin' 
 That was real love I was in 
 Ain't no reason to pretend 
 Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed 
 Garden shed for the garçons 
 Them feelings that I was guardin' 
 Heavy on my mind 
 All my friends lost 
 They couldn't read the signs 
 I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location 
 And they ain't wanna walk 
 Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase 
 Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone 
 But, it's still goin' on 
 Big fan of the beige tan 
 Polka dot nose, how it goes 
 Had to keep it on the subwoofer 
 A couple butterflies wanna float 
 But I was always like, "Eh" 
 Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh" 
 This is a crucial subject matter 
 Sensitive like cookin' batter 
 'Til the temperature that's risin' 
 Steppin' on that ladder, tryna 
 Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma 
 Planet by the time you hear this 
 Shit and chatter 'bout the heat 
 It will not fuckin' matter
