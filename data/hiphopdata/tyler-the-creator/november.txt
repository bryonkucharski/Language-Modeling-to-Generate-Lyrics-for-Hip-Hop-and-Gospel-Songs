Say some more, never want to talk about it 
 Feel a way, whoa 
 Feel a way, whoa 
 Feel a way, whoa 
 Take me back to November 
 Take me back to November 
 Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water 
 Yeah, take me back to November, wassup 
 Can we go back to November? 
 Take me back to November 
 Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts 
 Naw, take me back to November, wassup 
 What if Clancy fuckin' me over? 
 What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over? 
 What if I'm hustling backwards? 
 What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes? 
 Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions 
 I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics 
 Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics 
 What if my music too weird for the masses? 
 And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or 
 All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven 
 Fuck, what if I get stuck? 
 What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty 
 What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera 
 At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America 
 Damn, I would be hurtin' 
 Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working 
 Last year in total, I put out two verses 
 But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect 
 Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy 
 Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock 
 When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him 
 They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum? 
 Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person? 
 Mine was the summer '06, I remember the (*horn*) 
 What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed? 
 What if these deep thoughts was my last? 
 Let me pull over, quick! 
 And drive back to November 
 Take me back to November 
 Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water 
 Yeah, take me back to November, wassup 
 Can we go back to November? 
 Take me back to November 
 Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts 
 Naw, take me back to November, wassup 
 My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day 
 My November was performing with Lil Wayne 
 My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film 
 My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album 
 My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform 
 My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever... 
 My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different 
 2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back 
 I ain't doin' fine, lost my motherfuckin' mind 
 Time travel back and help me find 
 Take me back, take me back to November, this I know 
 Take me back, take me back 
 Take me back, take me back to November, this I know 
 "My November is right now" 
 I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion 
 Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending 
 'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are 
 Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it 
 If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts 
 Although I already know the response you gon' say back 
 At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back 
 And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback 
 Hello, no one is available to take your call 
 Please leave a message after the tone 
 *Beep*
