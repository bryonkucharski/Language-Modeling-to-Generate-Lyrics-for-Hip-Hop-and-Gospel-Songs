I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat 
 Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek 
 We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth 
 I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby сould you meet me by the lake? 
 Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake 
 Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake 
 We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake? 
 Summer never has to end with me 
 (Verse 1: Hodgy) 
 I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time 
 I'm give it like no other 'cause she knows I'm hers 
 Damn right she's mine, we both know it 
 So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse 
 Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga 
 Come for mines in summer time, I'mma bust that trigger, nigga 
 Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping 
 Sun down after club 'cause she like to get it popping 
 Sangria on my feet ma, 'cause she likes to get it popping 
 No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping 
 Drop topping, I measure her pleasure 
 Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize 
 She is my concubine, I am her porcupine 
 I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind 
 I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake 
 Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake 
 (Verse 2: Tyler) 
 I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket 
 And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking 
 We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split 
 Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine 
 (Brigde) 
 Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset 
 Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow) 
 Grab a drink, look in the sky, we never have to leave 
 We're here, all night, school is in session 
 Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep
