For your boy 
 I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor 
 I'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors nigga 
 Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive 
 What's your name again? Nobody knows it 
 Don't speak to me nigga, you not important 
 I'm focused 
 They say I'm nutty, picnic basket 
 Not short of a sandwich 
 A peanut butter, Boyce Watkin's a faggot 
 Please come and get me 
 Said I suck him at your neck 
 Like a hickey, boy I'm sicky 
 Like a HIV victim, man nobody fuckin' with me 
 I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me demon 
 And a terrorist, God dammit I couldn't believe it 
 Ban a kid from the country, I never fall, never timber 
 But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigger 
 I clearly don't give a fuck, say you could run that shit back 
 And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat 
 Cherry Bomb, the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound 
 And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round 
 Damn, bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust 
 Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft 
 We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves 
 Tyler the Creator sweatin' Jesus juice 
 Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raisin' the stakes 
 Mom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8 
 When we ate it's the steaks, now our section is great 
 Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate 
 Ye! 
 Why, why, why? 
 Why don't they like me? 
 Cause Nike gave lot of niggas checks 
 But I'm the only nigga ever to check Nike 
 Richer than white people with black kids 
 Scarier than black people with ideas 
 Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' 
 But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding 
 They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing going for me 
 You can't Lynch Marshawn, and Tom Brady throwin' to me 
 I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of em 
 I believe you like a fat trainer takin' a bite or somethin' 
 I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds 
 I dream't of 2Pac, he asked me "are you still down?" 
 "Yeah my nigga", Its on, its on, its on, its on 
 I know they told their white daughters don't bring home Jerome 
 I am the free nigga archetype 
 I am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon 
 It's funny when you get extra money 
 Every joke you tell just be extra funny 
 I mean you can even dress extra bummy 
 Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny 
 And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me 
 Oxford want a full blown lecture from me 
 And the Lexus pull up, skrrtt like hop, I'd hopped out, wassup 
 Erg erg erg, step back, hold up, my leg'll be stuck 
 I studied the proportions, emotions runnin' out of Autobahn 
 Speed level, had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God 
 He said "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard" 
 For your boy 
 I'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors 
 I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks got a trampoline in my room 
 Damn 
 Two, Three, Four 
 Hold your fuckin' horses 
 Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it 
 Like I bet it at an auction been exhausted 
 I been workin' while y'all cylinders smoke like broken exhaust tips 
 Fuckin' losers 
 Hold your fuckin' ponies my homie 
 I whip your donkey by my lonely I eat pussy like Shoney's 
 That's Tunechi, homie, master of ceremonies 
 I knock 'em down, domino effect, no pepperoni 
 I swear 
 This them golf boys, like them hot boys 
 For the nine, 9 and 2,000, but it's the 2,000 
 When the one four and the one five, yo what up Wayne 
 (What up Slime, nigga go hard) 
 Yeah, I'mma go hard like before Cain 
 Got too much drive, need like ten lanes 
 Life is a broad and she give brain 
 That's that road head, that's a dream car 
 Got a four ten, of that same year I was born 
 That's that one nine nine one, 'nother nigga like I 
 You won't find one, 'cause nigga I'm a god, a divine one, Tune 
 My trigger finger wise but my nine dumb 
 Middle finger blind so its fuck A-N-Y one 
 Fuck, skate and die son, a hundred ways to die son 
 I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump 
 Use Adderall like alarm clocks wake my high up 
 Steaks are high well done and prime cut, eat up 
 I stick my rollie in her mouth, let the time come 
 She got hair like Shanaynay, and eyes like Wonda 
 Oh my goodness 
 Wayne them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy 
 Ye we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles 
 Bitch I'm goin' harder than yellow cabby stoppin' for Lionel 
 (Black ass nigga) 
 They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling 
 Boy let's get a scrimmage, I'll cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers 
 And a couple owners, that's kinda German 
 You bring the nooses, and a couple trees 
 Where the money grow, and (get) bodies burning 
 'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin 
 Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham 
 I need music all over the street like Erick Sermon 
 Was, fuck us, maybe we should team up 
 Anti Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either 
 I'mma liar, I'mma faggot 
 Son you need Jesus 
 But I heard he left sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus, well 
 I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys 
 And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchinis 
 I know, it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame 
 Or lame, nor strange 
 Nah faggot its Golf Wang
