Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights? 
 I don't really like all these cameras, man 
 And this shit just don't feel right 
 And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir 
 But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here? 
 And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga 
 I hope you little niggas is listening 
 Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant 
 The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision 
 And now I pay a mortgage and they stuck with tuition 
 So special the teacher asked if I was autistic 
 And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes 
 So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen 
 But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion 
 But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions 
 Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school) 
 And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs 
 I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended 
 In Search of... did more for me than Illmatic 
 That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric 
 I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours 
 Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic 
 La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers 
 When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing 
 Named the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring 
 I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must 
 I don't have any armpits 
 She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit 
 I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant" 
 And who I are isn't really important 
 My heart is as dark as a window with car tint 
 So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it 
 And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick 
 It's young T 
 I don't like to follow the rules 
 And that's just who I am 
 I hope you understand 
 And I don't really think y'all cool 
 So give yourself a hand 
 No, no, give yourself a hand 
 Better pose for that camera 
 Better pose, boy you better pose 
 And it's your life nigga I suppose 
 For the lights, for the camera, and the action 
 Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights 
 Nigga you ask for this life 
 Welcome to death camp 
 Yeah, welcome to death camp 
 Yeah, welcome to death camp 
 Kissing on my bean bag 
 Your lips high-five my tongue 
 Fingers moonwalk through your hair 
 (For the lights, and the camera, and the action) 
 This is fun I can tell 
 I don't know if you'll handle it well 
 Welcome to hell camp 
 (Lights, and the camera, and the action) 
 You should be mine in a way tonight 
 (For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
