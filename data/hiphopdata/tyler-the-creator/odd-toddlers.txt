Hello, the Hype is so Mellow 
 Bitch I'm dope and my pipe is so yellow 
 The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title 
 Nigga fuck your role model bitch, I'm my own idol and 
 If you can't face it my nigga, you can ass it 
 My accessorize accessories bring out my assets 
 Nigga they sound on acid, tablets 
 Stussy's G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses 
 I suffer from ADHD 
 I should win a fuckin' award for bein' me 
 Beat bangin' the tom-toms 
 My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons 
 Ace the Underdog, thrown 'em on the back bender 
 'Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender 
 Eating Belgium waffles with Italian biscotts 
 I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off 
 And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off 
 Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off 
 Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off 
 Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help 
 So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me 
 With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts 
 I'm so dapper man, funky fresh dapper dan 
 I'm your favorite rapper fan, it's an honor to shake my hand 
 On the wall, tall on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets 
 I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure 
 I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at? 
 They had the cooler t-shirt at Supreme 
 And they see me they play pictionary 
 I got a good way with words like a dictionary 
 And in that dictionary my name is Bob Fresh 
 They at the same spot they making no progress 
 Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy 
 Of a process, eargasms they have 'em 
 The hotels we stayin' in twelve star 
 Tyler say "Yo Casey just write a twelve bar" 
 If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars 
 You haters what up, you Gods 
 They against us, oh no
