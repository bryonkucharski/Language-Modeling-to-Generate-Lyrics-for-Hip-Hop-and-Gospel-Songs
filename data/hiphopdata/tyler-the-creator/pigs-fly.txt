I was taught to act my shoe-size, never my age 
 I always judge a book by the cover, never the page 
 I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage 
 That he felt when he dealt with physological phase 
 They say that I never cease to amaze 
 While half my mental belongs in a cage 
 The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch 
 If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit 
 Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest 
 But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession 
 She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection 
 The pigs fly away in the morning 
 But I ain't get to see you today 
 And if I wanna go outside 
 I gotta make sure that I can play here 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 Well you ain't been looking through my eyes 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly, no 
 Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes 
 Went to sleep at seven then we woke up from the dream 
 Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme 
 So I guess that's where I hide my things 
 Caged, and the wonder is seen 
 Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck 
 I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck 
 So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities 
 Hoping that once you're ready you won't be too mad at me 
 But If so, I'll take the scorn and indeed happily 
 Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet 
 Fatherless kids orphans like me and Domo is 
 A fuck that we will never give is like our pops 
 But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch 
 Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit 
 The pigs fly away in the morning 
 But I ain't get to see you today 
 And if I wanna go outside 
 I gotta make sure that I can play here 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 I bet you've never seen a pig fly 
 Well you ain't been looking through my eyes 
 And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight 
 Don't go home tonight, chill, don't go home tonight) 
 And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight, chill 
 Please stay, don't go home tonight, don't go home tonight) 
 I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow 
 The therapist said hell, oh would my mama wonder 
 I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers 
 Like Food for Thought was my father but I ain't had the hunger 
 My self esteem is like me, tall and full of flaws 
 My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall 
 I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves 
 But I wear mine on my head, Supreme
