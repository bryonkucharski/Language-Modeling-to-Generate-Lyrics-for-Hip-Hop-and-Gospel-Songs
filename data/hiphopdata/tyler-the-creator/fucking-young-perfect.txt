Day that I met you girl 
 I knew that it was something special 
 But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look) 
 We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends) 
 And this is where the story and confusion begin 
 'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't 
 There go the police man (Knocking at my door) 
 Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat) 
 Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know") 
 Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more) 
 She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored) 
 There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid) 
 Fuck, 'cause 
 Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me) 
 And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up 
 And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young 
 This is more than a crush, I just might be in love 
 A six year (Difference) is a ten year (Sentence) 
 And with the (Pigment) on my skin 
 I don't want to be another (Statistic) 
 You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy) 
 And you fill a void that was once missing 
 And (I can say I'm in love) 
 There go the police man (Knocking at my door) 
 Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat) 
 Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know") 
 Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more) 
 She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored) 
 There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid) 
 Fuck, cause 
 Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me) 
 And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up 
 And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young 
 This is more than a crush, I just might be in love 
 When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21 
 Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8 
 I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified 
 Yo this is dumb, you should find someone else 
 I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself 
 And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help 
 'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help 
 So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt 
 And I don't want no relation, shit no relation 
 Ship when my dick is longer than my attention- 
 Span, it's gonna suck your shit, it's that kitchen fan 
 It splattered on me like my dick in my hand 
 What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off 
 Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off 
 She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught 
 That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds 
 But I found my wings, fuck, (But you're too fucking young) 
 I really like you, I don't know what to do (And when temptation calls, I never pick up 
 And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young) 
 Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this 
 It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, it's T and Uncle Charlie 
 (But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young) 
 Boy I know, that we could be more 
 Than just friends, but you're scared 
 Boy I know, that we could be more 
 Than just friends, but you're scared (I know) 
 I know that there could be 
 Somethin' for you and me 
 What's your philosophy? 
 You're scared, scared 
 And I exit and wait a while 
 Just say the word 
 Can't you see the answers are all there 
 But I'm just too blind to see 
 You and I are cut from different fabric 
 I wonder why, I wonder why, girl 
 Don't be too material to see 
 But I'm just too blind to see 
 Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be 
 Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me 
 But you're too fuckin' young 
 And, girl, I know that you're the one for me 
 Fuck, cause you're too fuckin' young 
 And, girl, I know that you're the one for me 
 And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts 
 Cause you're too fuckin' young 
 And, girl, I know that you're the one 
 That you're the one, for me 
 Cause you're too fuckin' young 
 And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah 
 I rock 
 I rock 
 I rock
