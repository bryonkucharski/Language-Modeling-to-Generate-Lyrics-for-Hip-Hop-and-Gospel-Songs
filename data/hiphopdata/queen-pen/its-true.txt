Yeah, it's 97 going into 98 
 And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues 
 This is my heart, my purpose in life and finally I'm on 
 Which brings me to realize that the tough life 
 That I had only made me stronger, true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 Growin' up didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you 
 Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you 
 Wanna play you close and jump in the pool wit' you 
 I don't know what to do but this much is true 
 And in the hood, they all like to knock your career 
 And turn right around when you hot a gear 
 I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear 
 That the man upstairs, he control this here 
 And it's funny how, soon as the money piles 
 Everybody wanna play with that brother now 
 Run me down, but when the doe gets low 
 Only a few friends roll, you know 
 And mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife 
 Said, "Lynisse, please do something with your life" 
 And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue 
 All I know is this much is true, true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 And I remember when, I used to feen for calls 
 When I hit number one I had to scream out calls 
 Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work 
 Told her when I made it big she never goin'-a work 
 I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street 
 Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light 
 And see another day somehow, find another way I vow 
 To all my soldiers I hold you down 
 From standin' in the rain to the rovers now 
 I'm screamin' your name to warn you 
 That the rollers is around 
 To on-stage throwin' it down 
 No matter where you at represent your hood 
 No matter where I'm at I'm representing my hood 
 And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue 
 All I know is this much is true, true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day 
 Nobody in the block gave their life away 
 We all tryin' to take it easily 
 And everybody wanna make it seems is free 
 Today it's all good and it seems so strange 
 Since you look up in the hood now things done changed 
 Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks 
 Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks 
 And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in 
 Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin' 
 Old timers in the back playin' dominoes 
 Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows 
 Girls flow through with designer clothes 
 It's day now but you know how nighttime goes 
 And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue 
 All I know is this much is true, true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 You know it's true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 You know it's true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 A ha ha ha ha 
 I know this much is true 
 You know it's true
