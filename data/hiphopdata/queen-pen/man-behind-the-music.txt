 Step right up, step up, step up, (repeat) 
 (Teddy) 
 1 - This is how it should be done 
 'Cause this style is identical to none 
 How can I make you dance some more (TR) 
 That's what I came here for 
 This is how it should be done 
 (And now, here's the magnificent Funky Mama) 
 'Cause this style 
 Is identical to none 
 How can I make you dance some more (TR) 
 That's what I came here for 
 (Queen Pen) 
 Feel your blue flows like water 
 The man behind the music will make you jump 
 New Jack your Swing 
 Make you shake your rump 
 No Diggity tellin' me this is what you want 
 Baselines and snares that will make you funk 
 Intimidated by his 14 year run 
 At 97 here's a different kind of funk 
 We push together like a perfect hand and tongue 
 You pressed your luck and now your back to should be sunk 
 Be coming, free the future, with yo' face punked 
 Forgot about the past now what you want 
 Platinum tracks to put you on the map 
 'Cause we gotta keep it in the fam' 
 You had yo' chance to be down wit da man 
 So busy playa hatin', perpetuating, articulating 
 Balla's down four, you can't take me 
 (Markell Riley) 
 What the deal ma 
 Funkey Mama plays the track so you could feel, huh? 
 I'm Miggidy, I'm all about the dolla' bills y'all 
 Rock the diamond Lex while I sit behind my desk 
 And sign the checks 
 If you like hits baby 
 Got 'em going crazy on Blackstreet 
 You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet 
 Save all yo whack beats, QP and TR so precise with mics 
 We should be surgeons in E.R. 
 The block knows 
 Baby girl be my diamond 'cause she rocks shows 
 See my one's ain't no way that you can stop those 
 Lil' man got your breath together 
 With Queen Pen, now it's hot to death 
 So take a look back 
 What I did, what I'm doing, where I take this 
 It's kinda simple 'cause it's nothing just to make hits 
 Peep the facts, keep 'em stacked 
 When the streets are Black 
 Ladies scream he's the Mack 
 'Cause I kick (what) 
 Shit that make the fly chick you with my chick 
 And plush funds just ridiculous 
 'Cause I'm rich 
 We are TR, you see, QP, that's we, Blackstreet, go on 
 (Queen Pen) 
 You can't take it 
 (And now, here's the magnificent Funky Mama) 
 Now Teddy jam for me one time 
 Enforce that then I'd make my hips bump and grind 
 We'll just happen 
 All this shit in this 'cause of platinum hits 
 Lil' Man be the shit, Funky Mama represent 
 It ain't never been no different 
 And we got witnesses 
 You account for all of this shit 
 Just we, and get your block knocked off 
 You can keep your I-pinion till you get there 
 'Cause it don't matter 
 We don't follow chit chatter 
 We make hits 
 And calls, my situations get thick 
 Ask St. Nick, about the repertiore 
 For those in the past, they know who they are 
 If the shoe fits, trust 
 We gon' wear it 
 Can we be's the baddest clique up on this planet 
 We paid the cost to be boss guys 
 'Cause scare money don't win money, now drop it 
 (Teddy) 
 This is how it should be done 
 'Cause this style 
 Is identicle to none 
 How can I make you dance some more 
 (Little man) 
 That's what I came here for 
 Repeat 1
