I'm taking you back 
 I'm taking you back 
 Here's another one 
 (Queen Pen) 
 Uh, yeah 
 I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard 
 Back in the day in the projects 
 Chasing after him, a lil' young chick 
 Seeing him made me go back in my lab 
 And write this lil' shit like this 
 Check it out 
 Here's how it goes 
 Used to see you when I went to the store 
 Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window 
 The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with 
 The spot in the grass where you kept your stash 
 I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes 
 If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive 
 I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs 
 With hopes to get close to you 
 Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep 
 Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets 
 Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet 
 Used to pray every day for the day that we meet 
 Used to hang with your sis if she only knew 
 I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you 
 Wasn't no limit to the things I would do 
 To give all my love to you, my God 
 (Eric) 
 Can't feel myself 
 Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
 You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
 There's not a minute, hour, day or night 
 I don't love you 
 You're at the top of my list 
 'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
 (Take it to the bridge) 
 All my love 
 ('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
 A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
 (Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
 I just don't wanna stop 
 Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 
 (Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge) 
 (Queen Pen) 
 Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew 
 I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew 
 Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning 
 How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit 
 Talked about that sex like I was used to it 
 Lying about how many you used to kiss 
 In the hallways, all day, till it was real 
 In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels 
 Put your name in my notebook, we all did that 
 Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched 
 Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt 
 In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work 
 Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad 
 The only one I ever loved ever since I was young 
 Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
 My God 
 (Eric) 
 Can't feel myself 
 Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
 You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
 There's not a minute, hour, day or night 
 I don't love you 
 You're at the top of my list 
 'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
 (Take it to the bridge) 
 All my love 
 ('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
 A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
 (Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
 I just don't wanna stop 
 Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 
 (Both) 
 The breakdown, now bounce to this 
 Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right) 
 Uh, you know who you are, from the hood 
 It's all good (yeah) yeah 
 We gon' bounce ta dis 
 We make moves with this 
 'Cause all my love's to you 
 Now bounce
