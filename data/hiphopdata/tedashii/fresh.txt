Yes, on a permanent team 
 You can say I'm fresh to death, I'm eternally clean 
 Used to walk to by own beat of drum 
 Internal instinct 
 But went from enemy to intimacy, I been redeemed 
 Through the cross and now I floss in His Paternal Regime 
 No more living single 
 It's like I done turned on Regine 
 In the body I got it 
 Wha-what fraternity means 
 He prevailed my hell so there will be no burning of me 
 So keep the urn and the wreath 
 'Cause I'll return to the king 
 Accepted fully cause of the cross' conversion of me 
 So if I flex 
 It ain't in flesh 
 He bore my burden for me 
 And baby when I say I'm fresh 
 Its cause He birthed a new me 
 I'm fresh 
 Not because my swagger right 
 Not be-not because 
 Not be-not because my swagger right 
 I'm fresh 
 Cause He came and took the cross 
 I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross 
 I'm fresh 
 I'm fresh 
 Not because my swagger right 
 Not be-not because 
 Not be-not because my swagger right 
 I'm fresh 
 Cause He came and took the cross 
 I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross 
 I'm fresh 
 I'm fresh 
 Baby, cause of Adam #2 
 Crucified with Him 
 And by faith 
 Man He made me brand new 
 Point two 
 The cross was powerful in changing my view 
 Regenerate, all my boys say I'm acting brand new 
 And its true 
 So true 
 'Cause I'm not what I used to be 
 Somehow I got this boost in me 
 Truthfully, I'm not used to me 
 Please believe me I'm humble 
 But in Christ I can boast 
 See it's grace through faith that got ya boy so cold 
 So cold, and I ain't trying to be cocky 
 No confidence in compliments, I know that's opposite godly 
 See conceit is not my stronghold 
 Confidence is strong though 
 Trust on high, and I don't mean that Cheech and Chong smoke 
 I'm fresh 
 Not because my swagger right 
 Not be-not because 
 Not be-not because my swagger right 
 I'm Fresh 
 Cause He came and took the cross 
 I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross 
 I'm fresh 
 To some this makes no sense but to others its krunk 
 So dawg I pray to God you feel this like them subs in ya trunk 
 Not just the beat 
 Although I know it's got you moving ya body 
 But the message in this song 
 It should be moving the body 
 Point one, I'm elected and redeemed 
 Point two 
 'Cause I got a new position, I'm fresh, so clean 
 Point three 
 I'm the-I'm the best me that can be 
 I'm in His image so some sinner may just happen to see 
 That life is wasted if you shape it in the form of yourself 
 Or someone else besides the Son, the One who's form is this shell 
 So I'm reflecting your glory LORD 
 Man that's who I'm living for 
 Jesus is LORD so I ain't gotta please you 
 I'm fresh
