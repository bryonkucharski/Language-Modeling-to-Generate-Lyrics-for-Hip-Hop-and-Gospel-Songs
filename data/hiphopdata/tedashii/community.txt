I remember before my church started 
 A season that I called the darkness 
 Saved but still living in bondage 
 Not know the problem was not just my pride and lust, but that life was so autonomous 
 But at Epiphany I had an epiphany 
 Realizing community was the way it was meant to be 
 WHY? 
 In the beginning He who gave us identity was, eternally, co-existing as the Trinity 
 Saying 
 It's not good for man to be alone 
 It's impossible for him to model us on his own 
 He gave man a companion not a clone 
 Commanding reproduction, expansion, and a throne 
 And now 
 The new Adam is starting it all over 
 Sparking it with bride who glorifies Jehovah 
 Submit 
 You wanna know who you are then know your role 'cause 
 Your ID's in Christ and Christ is part of a whole bruh 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Oh! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Oh! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Oh! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Hey! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Hey! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Hey! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community 
 Before Real Talk were Ambassadors chopping 
 Up that milk and meat, having all things in common 
 Before church planting was an option 
 Before the albums start dropping 
 We were in community stomping 
 Patience with your boy when I was loud and obnoxious 
 Before I turned my life up in at a concert 
 Before I learned the truth over nonsense 
 Before I hit a stage they were caution 
 Accountability, yeah awesome not produce a man selfish or pompous 
 Know the process of Learning the scriptures in its context 
 Bible study sometime it made me nauseous 
 But know I never grow sick of spitting up those synoptics 
 Constantly keeping others upon my conscious 
 Being honest not just robbing them of their knowledge 
 Promise to serve one another in righteous conduct 
 Its common sense I'm something like a communist. 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Oh! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Oh! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Oh! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Hey! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Hey! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Hey! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community 
 Give me a sec just to put it in perspect 
 He's God 
 And He deserves more than just your check 
 He deserves your breath 
 Every one you'll ever get 
 We deserve death 
 Something (by grace) we'll never get 
 So, hands 
 Devoted 
 Cause He rose and beat death 
 We could be right handed but we all went left 
 See in order to redeem me He gave up Himself 
 So I'm laying on the alter till they lay me to rest 
 What you expect 
 Man we give God our best 
 Plus, 
 Knowing Him, is how we know our, self 
 So, 
 We learn of Him in the way that He set 
 Up, so we can get it 
 Christian fellowship 
 As I imitate God and conform more to Christ 
 In the bond of community 
 I look more like 
 Him (Him), Him (Him), and the image I was meant to have 
 Praise God for the Church 
 Showing me just me who I am 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Oh! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Oh! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Oh! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community 
 Back back them church boys are back 
 Hey! 
 That's that the new life is that 
 Hey! 
 FOTU with my crew till He comes back 
 Hey! 
 Live in community 
 Walk in community
