Take a seat 
 Let's get into this 
 There's been a challenge to the truth 
 But there's defense for this (2:1-2) 
 Since Paul's first letter there's been need for another one (1:3, 5, 2:1, 13, 3:1, 6) 
 Cause the other one was compromised by a cover up another one (2:2) 
 Cause some of us 
 Thought Paul was sending... wait (2:3a) 
 Slow up, lets just start from the beginning 
 First, Paul felt morally indebted just to give thanks (1:3) 
 For our faith and increased love toward the saints (1:3) 
 For this reason Paul bragged on us (1:4) 
 Because we all persevered through attacks on us (1:4) 
 And these attacks are evidence of His righteous judgment (1:5, 2:14) 
 Proof we've been proven worthy of a righteous covenant (1:5b, 1:11) 
 And don't sweat the hatters because God is just (1:6) 
 To punish them and give you rest so in God we trust (1:6-7) 
 So until the Lord comes back to take us home (2:16, 14) 
 Persevere through afflictions baby and stand strong (1:11, 5, 2:15) 
 Stand strong in the faith 
 God called you to this thing (2:14) 
 Persevere through the hate 
 Do it all in Jesus name (2:15, 1:4) 
 Cause the Lord is coming back, yep 
 The Lord is coming back, yep (2:2) 
 The Lord is coming back, yep 
 The Lord is coming back (2:2) 
 See the Lord is coming back 
 And he'll save us from this pain (2:2, 2:14) 
 Don't get lazy in the back stay disciplined in His name (3:11, 6, 14-15) 
 So stand strong in the faith, yep 
 Strong in the faith, stand (2:15) 
 Strong in the faith, yep 
 Stand strong in the faith (2:15) 
 Now there are some of us who have been tricked into believing 
 All kinds of rumors about the return of Jesus (2:2) 
 Apparently there was a letter with false intent (2:2) 
 Bent on contradicting the first letter Paul sent (2:2) 
 So this is Paul's response to end the myth (2:1-12) 
 That says the day of the Lord, is in our midst (2:1-3a) 
 Don't let anyone deceive you I beseech you (2:3b) 
 Hold fast to the lessons in which we teach you 
 Remember when Paul was with us he said these things (2:5) 
 First rebellion 
 Then comes the lawless man on the scene (2:3) 
 Then lawlessness, all of this so man would call on his name (2:4) 
 As he's exalting his name, to where the Father's is (2:4) 
 But, at this point, we've been long gone with Christ (2:1b, 2b, I Thes. 4:15, 17b, 5:1-2, 9) 
 The rapture is a snatching not Him coming back twice (I Thes. 4:16-17, II Thes. 2:1b) 
 They're separate and the day of the Lord happens after you (2:5, 12, I Thes. 4:17, 5:3a, 4-5) 
 This is not for your calendar but to strengthen your character (2:2) 
 Stand strong in the faith 
 God called you to this thing (2:14) 
 Persevere through the hate 
 Do it all in Jesus name (2:15, 1:4) 
 Cause the Lord is coming back, yep 
 The Lord is coming back, yep (2:2) 
 The Lord is coming back, yep 
 The Lord is coming back (2:2) 
 See the Lord is coming back 
 And he'll save us from this pain (2:2, 2:14) 
 Don't get lazy in the back stay disciplined in His name (3:11, 6, 14-15) 
 So stand strong in the faith, yep 
 Strong in the faith, stand (2:15) 
 Strong in the faith, yep 
 Stand strong in the faith (2:15) 
 Finally brothers, Paul evokes our memory (3:3) 
 Christ is faithful in affliction, just be genuine inwardly (3:3-5) 
 Committed to praying daily 'cause we're fighting an enemy (3:1-2) 
 Trying to take me out the battle by using the sin in me (3:6) 
 And speaking of sin, Paul charges us in (3:6) 
 Staying away from the lazy and rebellious idle men (3:6) 
 In hopes our actions would invoke some action (3:6) 
 Paul's first letter warned and they ignored his passion (3:10, 7, I Thes. 4:9-12, I Thes. 5:14) 
 Now the churches reaction has to be more drastic (3:6, 14) 
 In hopes that they grasp it/and then repent of their actions (3:15, 12, 7) 
 Let's recall Paul's behavior when he stayed with us (3:7-10, I Thes. 2:9-12) 
 And how he labored night and day and never made a fuss (3:8) 
 Man Paul is our model that we should be following (3:7) 
 If a man doesn't work then that man shouldn't eat (3:10) 
 Take note of those who disobey this command (3:14) 
 Stand strong and quote, "I wrote this letter with my own hand"(Paul) (3:16-18)
