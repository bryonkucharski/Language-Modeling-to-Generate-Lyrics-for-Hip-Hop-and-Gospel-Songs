Kingdom people, lets jump this off with a word of prayer 
 Lord, it's your boy... 
 So I trip, 'cause I don't even expect to be here Lord 
 Honestly I didn't even seek it out it seems, but, I understand what you said in 1 Corinthians 5:20, Lord, you called us to be your ambassdors so, I know this can glorify you 
 But Lord I pray I die to myself Lord 
 Even if they don't like it Lord 
 Or even if they love it, I pray I die to myself Lord 
 Because I know, this glorifies you, so use this for your glory Lord, use this as I die to myself, in Jesus name Lord, amen
