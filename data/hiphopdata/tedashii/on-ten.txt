Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 Whoop, we be rollin' no splits, we ridin' 
 You ain't seen it like this, we glidin' 
 Whips in a wave slow, we slidin' 
 Yeah we bout to start a riot 
 Silent, yeah workin' like it's a niner 
 Fightin', workin' with my usos from the island 
 Hopin' nobody will pick today to have a problem 
 Yeah we out here in the IE, prowlin' 
 Then they cone us like my lane broken 
 Movin' with me to this man and they ain't even know me 
 That don't matter, my name be empty chatter 
 We can kick it and chop it, bout to master, no last dragon 
 Whoot, oh well, we ain't takin' no L's 
 Feelin' spiffy, I ain't trippy, see the prize, Nobel 
 Show love in the West, with my blood in the West 
 With my gang, I ain't bang, we unashamed in the West (West sideee) 
 Chorus - Tedashii: 
 He on one, she on two 
 Me, I'm on my P's and Q's 
 'Cause we be on ten, say what 
 We on ten, say what 
 We on ten, say what 
 We on ten, from the end, we on ten, say what 
 We on ten, say what 
 Every time they see the clique they know what they bout to get 
 Verse 2 - Derek Minor: 
 Now I be drummin' down your block and it ain't even Christmas 
 Duh duh-duh duh duh, duh duh-duh duh duh 
 Snatch the mic like Ye, wait I'mma let you finish 
 Dun dun-dun dun dun, dun dun-dun dun dun 
 Screamin' now who that, say they wanna do that 
 One-One-Six the team, but you already knew that 
 I used to be violent and whoop you Ah-bloo-bleh! 
 And now I'm like oh, why they do that 
 Going mago de, uno uno seis 
 I'm an 808, heavy like sumo weight 
 Nashville representin' and I'm high on grace 
 So when I say I'm on ten, that ain't just my state 
 Y'all gonna have to have a whole lot of hate 
 I mean a whole lot of hate, just to rain on our day 
 'Cause we workin' with a whole lot of grace 
 And a whole lot of homies out here be yellin' unashamed 
 Verse 3 - Transparent: 
 Ya boy live from the Golden State 
 On ten, in the wind cross the Golden Gate 
 With the homie from the Lone Star 
 Bangin' the name of the King that reigns, the lone star 
 And I'm thinkin' that we need to start a riot 
 You don't agree to sit back and be quiet 
 'Cause I'm tempted to mirror that 
 Especially when I think about the cross on His back 
 A million unashamed, it is not a day to scatter from 
 From your bell is an heir, far from a lame in his thing 
 See, regardless of my situation, I'm still gonna chase Him 
 Builds high, money low, still put Him on blast every where I go 
 So until my time is done, I'mma stay on eleven minus one 
 (West sideee) Do the math
