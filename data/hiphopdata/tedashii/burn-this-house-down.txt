In my room, feelin' trapped 
 A prison without bars 
 Stay dreamin' of escape in my getaway car 
 Or a ship from outer space, maybe Venus, maybe Mars 
 I just want another place, this one seems to hard 
 Maybe another state, this one seems too large 
 For me to navigate 
 Man my compass seems wrong 
 So lighter, fire, matches if I had this 
 I would burn this whole thing down right now 
 I don't need it no more 
 Man that part of me is gone 
 Every picture, every letter, every part of this home 
 You can keep it, I don't need it 
 I'm movin', it's not a secret 
 I got a new home, and I'm goin' there to see it 
 There's a burnin in my soul and there's nowhere to go 
 So with fire in my eyes, I light up the sky 
 Let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this whole house down, let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 Cause there's too many memories, too much pain 
 Too much for me to bear I'm goin' insane 
 Let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground, let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 I can't wait till I'm out of this house that I'm in 
 Cause every single day I feel trapped inside my skin 
 Every scratch, every crack, every spot on the exterior 
 Flaws that make me pause, I feel so inferior 
 I was seven when I felt it, I couldn't conceive it 
 Age eleven felt it again and that's when I believed it 
 Advances made at me and I wouldn't receive it 
 I tried to move on, but I'm stuck like cement 
 And I felt so alone, man it's like this thing trapped me 
 I played make believe to erase that it happened 
 Every falling star, I'm wishin for a change 
 I need another place to live free from these chains 
 There's a burnin in my soul and there's nowhere to go 
 So with fire in my eyes, I light up the sky 
 Let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this whole house down, let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 Cause there's too many memories, too much pain 
 Too much for me to bear I'm goin' insane 
 Let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground, let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 If you push me one more time 
 Man I swear that it's on 
 They always pickin' on me and won't leave me alone 
 Racial slurs, hateful words, while people stand there and laugh at ya 
 Go back to where? But I'm not even from Africa 
 Hard knock life with these after school fights 
 Man I just wanna live, this doesn't seem right 
 Man it seems so wrong pain lasts this long 
 But this pain was the push to make me want a new home 
 I didn't see it but it saw me 
 Didn't seek it but it sought me 
 Didn't buy it but it bought me 
 Hope you catch it, it caught me 
 Even victims aren't innocent 
 And need answers for sinfulness 
 I understand the simpleness 
 But most still missin' it 
 There's a burnin in my soul and there's nowhere to go 
 So with fire in my eyes, I light up the sky 
 Let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this whole house down, let it burn (let it burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 Cause there's too many memories, too much pain 
 Too much for me to bear I'm goin' insane 
 Let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground, let it burn (burn) 
 I burn this house to the ground 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 I'm not gon' miss it when it's gone 
 Let it burn 
 And if you thinkin' that I'm sayin' 
 That you gotta be playin' 
 I can't wait to leave, let it burn 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 I'm not gon' miss it when it's gone 
 Let it burn 
 And if you thinkin' that I'm sayin' 
 That you gotta be playin' 
 I can't wait to leave, let it burn
