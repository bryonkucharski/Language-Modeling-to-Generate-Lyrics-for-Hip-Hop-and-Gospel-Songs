Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 My pain is real 
 Don't pretend you can feel 
 I appreciate your prayers, but I'm keeping it real 
 Kitchen and skitching I'm gripping the steel 
 Hand in my pain, and let's keep it concealed 
 Mad at the world, and I'm ready to kill 
 Hollering pain, and they letting me live 
 Making me sick, and they calling me ill 
 The mood that I'm in, I die to the fear 
 No lie, testify 
 Left hand on the Bible, right hand to the sky 
 My days be long, nights seem long 
 Calling on help and nobody is home 
 All by myself, and I feel so alone 
 Cold world, yeah, and I know it's for show 
 Worst day of my life, and it's just getting badder 
 Asking Him why and looking for answers 
 Hook - Britt Nicole: 
 Dark days and darker nights 
 Heart break dreams from this heartened mind 
 Don't understand it 
 Can't understand it

 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 Bombay and that Alizé 
 Purple Sprite with that Grand Marnier 
 Sip, slurp, sizzurp, hurl 
 Do it again the same next day 
 Hey, marijuana, ganja 
 Blown crop dust like I was a farmer 
 Mary Jane that dame I called her 
 Invested my home and living with roaches 
 Womanizing, traumatizing 
 The reason that made me despise me 
 My Savior's bringing them gifts 
 Presented as wise men trying to entice them 
 Liars all wired up 
 By the men before but I was the first 
 But this is no race or wretch 
 A mess and I'm trying to find help 
 Looking at pictures it making me sadder 
 Feeling so helpless it making me madder 
 Worst day of my life, and it's just getting badder 
 Asking Him why and looking for answers 
 Wondering if He ever gon come back 
 If He is then man can you pick up the slack 
 Cause this place that I'm in I may never come back 
 Feeling so lost and don't know where I'm at 
 Verse 3 - Tedashii: 
 Uh, I pick up on a sign quick 
 I don't know what I could find if 
 Someone could get me out the mess I'm in 
 Brain loss, gone and all it's sin 
 I know I'm hurting from my past pain 
 And people tell me I goin' insane 
 I think they lying so I keep pressing 
 The way things I used to do, trying to impress em' 
 This pain, I gotta let it go
