Ye-ye-ye-yep, yes He's Alive 
 From the dark to the light, sunrise 
 Everybody who be driven they thinkin' that He's gone 
 Gonna be in for a big surprise 
 Walla, uh huh, right there before they eyes 
 He'll be back, ain't cut no slack for the cats who try to hide 
 Lies; that's what they say I drop, cats so lost 
 Caught up with they-selves but they rebel 
 Yes sir they gon' be shocked-shock, clear 
 They dead now, can't live just on that bread, naw 
 I chokehold what He said now I'm His pupil yes no retina 
 He done preached it from the mountain and three thousand all believed it 
 And He called me on the campus, and I answered and received Him 
 From the witnesses that seen Him, to the heathens who now preach Him 
 The proof is in the change; unashamed, that's how we reach em' 
 And so I stand up, I will never stand down 
 Worship with my hands up, humbled by Him, man down 
 Yes sir, that is it, I will never call it quits 
 Pressin' on, that's how I know I'm His and that He lives 
 He lives 
 I-I-I am so glad He lives 
 My Savior He died, but He rose again 
 R-r-rose again, He's alive 
 And now that I'm dead to my sin 
 In me is a place He can live 
 I'll serve Him until He comes back again 
 B-b-b-back again, He's alive 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that He lives 
 What's that gotta do with me, huh?? 
 I'm just tryna stack my bread 
 I ain't bother nobody or robbin' nobody like I done just got out the feds 
 I heard what the preacher done said (what's that?) 
 That Jesus popped outta the grave 
 But what does that have to do with me and all of these bills that gotta get paid? 
 And all of these mouths I gotta feed? 
 Plus my old lady complainin' 
 I'm tryna live kinfolk, although I see what you sayin' 
 But if you see what I'm sayin', then you would know it is 
 Truth, positive that the God man really is, who He say He is 
 Took on human flesh and hit the Earth 
 Lived the perfect life, first, then He took that crucifix 
 Then He resurrected; that validated that He is God 
 Did you say Jesus is God? Yes I said Jesus is God! 
 So, what that means is, all, human beings is 
 His creation, we should praise Him for His patience then repent 
 All you gotta do now just confess 
 Turn from your sin put your soul to rest 
 He resurrected, you get forgiveness 
 Give Him your all and nothing less 
 He lives 
 I-I-I am so glad He lives 
 My Savior He died, but He rose again 
 R-r-rose again, He's alive 
 And now that I'm dead to my sin 
 In me is a place He can live 
 I'll serve Him until He comes back again 
 B-b-b-back again, He's alive 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that He lives 
 Three days... Just enough to make these people say He gone 
 He wrong, He on His own, He left us here, we all alone 
 But naw... You got it twisted 
 Clear like the sky but I guess you missed it 
 But we ain't done yet, till there ain't none left, be 
 Patient, hope you listen 
 'Cause when He touch down, no replay 
 You should run now, no relay 
 Who can turn down, what He say? Man I'm turned up 
 Know He lay out the grave, that's the reason I am saved 
 Not for rules so I behave, but so I can be remade 
 In His image, I am finished, period, minus the sentence 
 Through repentance in an instant 
 I'm so helped, call it Christian 
 Cause He lived, I know that's real 
 You sayin' prove it, peep the movement 
 Unashamed till the end, I'll tell em' that He lives 
 He lives 
 I-I-I am so glad He lives 
 My Savior He died, but He rose again 
 R-r-rose again, He's alive 
 And now that I'm dead to my sin 
 In me is a place He can live 
 I'll serve Him until He comes back again 
 B-b-b-back again, He's alive 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He died, I'll tell em' that He rose, and I'll tell em' He's alive 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that He lives 
 I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that, I'll tell em' that He lives
