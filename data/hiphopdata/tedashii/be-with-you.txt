Hook - Lester "L2" Shaw: 
 Uh, everything about you 
 Makes me glad I'm with you 
 The simple little things you do 
 Baby, hey 
 Can't stop thinking about you 
 One plus one makes us two 
 Thought I bit off more than I can chew 
 I just wanna be with you! 
 Oh yeah, you make me better 
 I'm great, you made me step up 
 Ain't scared to say I'm blessed up 
 Be with you, leave you never! 
 This thing is so next level 
 That's why I pin this letter 
 Hope you don't mind me sharing publicly 
 Why we're together forever 
 Prepare whatever, weather will never settle 
 Vessel will go wherever, try to get one forever, huh! 
 Same team, baby, I'm done with playing games 
 You're my main thing, baby 
 You can tell it by my ring! 
 Committed, yeah, we did it, this isn't 
 Living, flipping, we're in it 
 Till our living is ending! 
 Yeah, let's get it, I'm with it 
 Quit it, no I quit it 
 Not even when you're tripping or you're flipping 
 I don't listen, pay attention 
 Baby, I ain't going nowhere! 
 If you ain't by my side, sticking with it 
 Love at least some would leave it, but I'm gone 
 For my ride, I die tripping 
 You're the one I'm riding with 
 When these others call it quits 
 We'll still be getting it like 
 Nothing even matters, baby 
 On that Lauren heel tip 
 Others don't get it, but like the ground 
 How do you feel this? 
 You're the realest, I'm flipping like a gymnast 
 You're smiling, I start to blush 
 You don't even need that lipstick! 
 All that make-up, for you it doesn't take much 
 As far as I'm concerned 
 You look that good right when you wake up! 
 And I love the way you smirk when you try to hide your smile 
 Then you scare me, I'm a dork 
 Is how you float my butterfly 
 I wanna sweep you off your feet 
 And then catch you when you fall 
 I'm trying to be all you need 
 Yeah... through my all 
 Plus, I know you got me too 
 After all that we've been through 
 Yeah, the suffer... baby girl, that's the truth! 
 So let's show this world love, for a thug 
 Always, always good 
 Everlasting, flashing at them lies we get from Hollywood! 
 Same team is me and you 
 Girl, until is world is through 
 I'll never leave until I lead this world 
 Girl, I wanna be with you! 
 Lester "L2" Shaw": 
 Thoughts of me living without you, girl 
 That's something that I couldn't do! 
 You make me whole, baby 
 You make me strong 
 And there is nothing I wouldn't do for you, baby! 
 Lester "L2" Shaw": 
 Uh, everything about you 
 Makes me glad I'm with you 
 The simple little things you do 
 Baby, hey 
 Can't stop thinking about you 
 One plus one makes us two 
 Thought I bit off more than I can chew 
 I just wanna be with you! 
 I just wanna be with 
 I just wanna be with 
 I just wanna be with you, baby! 
 Everything about, yeah! 
 Everything that I do, baby 
 I do, I do, I do for you 
 One plus one makes us two 
 Baby, oh, oh!
