 Livin' it 
 Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away? 
 When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day 
 The last shall be first, the first shall be last (x3) 
 The last shall be...(Livin' it, livin' it in reverse) 
 And everything's in reverse 
 Livin' with the end in mind, something like the precedent 
 I was livin' for the moment, tryin' to own it, residence 
 Believe in Him, that's the last thing I done ever chose 
 Gimme that rag top, trey on them chosen vogue 
 (I rode) That '67 Chevy my cousin drove on them golden spokes? 
 Life is short, and man I hope I make it down the road 
 But where I'm from, hope was that girl that flirted, flaunted 
 You never got it, but she was the one you always wanted 
 How could a picture perfect image front and tell you lies 
 My version of perversion did it every day a lie 
 And man that burden got me hurtin' lookin' for some answers 
 Endless searchin' just leave you burnin': Jo Jo Dancer 
 But mine ended when I saw the Lord would choose to hang 
 That type of love got me coming back, call it boomerang 
 Yet you can end the searches living waters quench my thirst 
 Since the day I died now I'm livin' in reverse 
 Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away? 
 When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day 
 The last shall be first, the first shall be last (x3) 
 The last shall be...(Livin' it, livin' it in reverse) 
 And everything's in reverse 
 Man all I ever wanted, was to be labeled the greatest 
 Cassius Clay on spittin' rhymes while rockin' the lastest 
 But that crept into my life in Christ, it was evident 
 As I debate how I was better than the rest of them 
 Work-based righteousness; base my worth on some type of list and 
 If I keep it or not perfected every night since this 
 Now, I'm looking for approval, and I'm selfish! 
 So all I want to do is try to out do you. 
 Silent when you ask me. Later I'm braggin' like a fool. 
 Far from His image and couldn't see it. Where is the Zoom? 
 This is grace in my moment of reproof. That helps me see the truth. 
 Just how I sound; no auto-tune. 
 And in this life the last will be first and the first is last. 
 And He's a servant to the end. We certain of that. 
 That's what I heard; freedom from the curse. 
 Livin' to it hurts, but the latter doesn't matter when you in reverse. 
 Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away? 
 When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day 
 The last shall be first, the first shall be last (x3) 
 The last shall be... (Livin' it, livin' it in reverse) 
 And everything's in reverse 
 Man, I'm longin' for that day when the trumpet sounds. 
 I imagine in an instant I'd be off the ground. 
 Face to face with my Maker, with the glorious Savior. 
 Embraced by Forever, no pain, free from labor. 
 And from my sinful nature, And we see Hope revealed. 
 Free from every tribulation, see He broke the seal. 
 Every saint around the throne in worship 
 Of the Perfect 'cause He purged us and He purchased us 'cause Hell is real. 
 Receiven what we all deserve 
 That where we see the first shall be last and the last will be first. 
 Either way, He's such a generous God that, 
 It doesn't matter if you've been here forever or just started your job. 
 He rewards us for our work, so life's not in vain. 
 And every saint, hold on He's comin' again! 
 Revelation's only scary if you're not in Christ. 
 So I don't shine, I reveal. Call it Blacklight. 
 Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away? 
 When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day 
 The last shall be first, the first shall be last (x3) 
 The last shall be...(Livin' it, livin' it in reverse) 
 And everything's in reverse
