Listen to the sound above 
 Hear the music from the sky 
 Oh, The day is near 
 Forever we be there 
 Heaven is a beautiful place 
 We will laugh until we cry 
 Feel the love we can't deny 
 Uh, I'm only passing through; I can't keep still 
 I'm a stranger, that's for real 
 Evacuatin', this is not a drill 
 Alien baring fruit; 
 My crop circles and to feel I'm from a different world 
 Dwayne Wayne you remember 
 I even flipped my glasses no bartender 
 Mixed up in this crazy world keep the blender 
 Because I'm going back home and return to Sender, yea 
 But I knew that would 
 If He held it down for me then, then I knew that I could 
 Hey, as soon as he come back to get me hop in the corna' 
 You can call it graduation baby minus the diploma 
 Raise your flutes to the truth 
 Have a toast on the new life 
 Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate 
 Heaven on our minds 
 No pain just pleasure 
 No sin just God forever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 That will be the day 
 It. Is. Wonderful 
 And man no feeling can describe it 
 And even though I try to there's little that can define it 
 Any emotions like a potion be controlling me 
 Island Ocean living when these visions get a hold of me 
 Yea, interest to the King of kings 
 And I don't need a rosary 
 All I need is Him, Him, Him 
 Who I need? 
 The One that exist in Three 
 And not for me but for his glory 
 It's Him and not me He the star of this story 
 Heaven isn't heaven if God isn't there 
 If He isn't I don't want it might as well stay here 
 But we won't, that's my hope 
 I know that it gets better and we will be with God and we gone live forever 
 Like the song say, No sin enjoying Him for eternity 
 Raise your flutes to the truth 
 Have a toast on the new life 
 Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate 
 Heaven on our minds 
 No pain just pleasure 
 No sin just God forever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 That will be the day 
 Beautiful vision 
 Our life as a mission 
 Love and perfection 
 And all our dreams will come reality 
 Face the joy for an eternity 
 Jesus Christ in full intimacy 
 Raise your flutes to the truth 
 Have a toast on the new life 
 Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate 
 Heaven on our minds 
 No pain just pleasure 
 No sin just God forever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 And ever 
 That will be the day
