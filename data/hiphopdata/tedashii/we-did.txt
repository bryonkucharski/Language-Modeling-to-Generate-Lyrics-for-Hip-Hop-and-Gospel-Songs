Ok, why did we do it? Cause mommy thought it was too late, the struggle in her flesh got her mixed up just like a Clue tape 
 She straddling the fence switching back and forth just like two lanes, so we present the grace that's available since this Jew came 
 Why did we do it? 'Cause we deny the hand that was given, we'd rather prison before we choose the Lamb that is risen 
 We're unaware that our hearts are deceitfully wicked, if trusted it'll trick you like Shai Linne when he flipped it 
 So don't come up in the game tip toein, dip low when we blowin', tip slow and chill upon the fact men going through notions still joking imploding 
 They lookin' up to God for props and mo dollars for collars for poppin', but it on a move, yo crosses, cause lost men seek flossing like bosses 
 It's 1-1-6 the only reason I live, make it plain like window panes and outfits without appeal 
 Yes I am young and like Vince I rally, I'm unashamed I stand out like Longhorns in Cali 
 Because of God's love and grace - that's why we did what we did 
 For little kids up in the faith - that's why we did what we did 
 His Son died up in our place - that's why we did what we did 
 To meet the Father face to face - that's why we did what we did 
 To show them boys it's not an act - that's why we did what we did 
 Because the Christ is comin' back - that's why we did what we did 
 To rep His name and hold it down - that's why we did what we did 
 We grab mikes and say it loud - that's why we did what we did 
 Hey, cats always wanna ask us why we made a switch to livin' life for the Master 
 Ain't nothing great as this, we don't be feelin' like we have to be smoking and drinking Cris 
 They don't understand so they be asking why like Jadakiss 
 We used to be your average dudes main livin' just to live with ungodly attitudes, straight content within our sin 
 But glory to God He snatched us up out of confusion, we ain't fools cause Christ cross shook us like we was hoopin main 
 We ain't even know that our vision was blurred, was all up in the world, but wouldn't get in the word 
 You wonder why we dirty south but ain't sippin the syrup, cause He took the crucifixion still was risen on the third 
 His Spirit took control that's why we some new creatures, taught us everything we know like He was a school teacher 
 Now we pursue Jesus we ain't livin' in sin, cause He snatched us out the pit that's why we did what we did 
 Because of God's love and grace - that's why we did what we did 
 For little kids up in the faith - that's why we did what we did 
 His Son died up in our place - that's why we did what we did 
 To meet the Father face to face - that's why we did what we did 
 To show them boys it's not an act - that's why we did what we did 
 Because the Christ is comin' back - that's why we did what we did 
 To rep His name and hold it down - that's why we did what we did 
 We grab mikes and say it loud - that's why we did what we did 
 Hey it's T-dot, I'm back on your corner up in your hood main, still reaching for them junky moneys grippin the wood grain 
 Still reaching out to my family just like I should main, even if they blow me off with it's all good main 
 Cause the truth of the gospel I got it, just like apostles I shout it, loud like little kids who be pouting, till this whole circle get crowded 
 See the world is undoubtedly cursed with a curse, so we spit a verse with no curse for the reverse of the curse 
 Children are fighting to live, addicts keep popping them pills, Christians are frightened to spill, passively croppin them fields 
 I'm unashamed of the God who would take my blame, the lashes on the Master passed me fastly when Jesus came 
 So reading His word- that's me, witness on curbs- that's me, no 4 letter words- that's me, does this sound absurd? That's me 
 See through what Jesus did, now we some believer kids, see it's His love that compels us to do what we did
