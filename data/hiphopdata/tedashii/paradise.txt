Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 The day that we met I tell you no lie 
 I'll never forget, it's stuck in my mind 
 Yeah, a love so real it brought tears to my eyes 
 Didn't care who was around, couldn't keep it inside 
 All my feelings on the real, man I'm lettin' 'em show 
 Sharing this straight from my heart and I'm lettin' it flow 
 And anybody askin' questions I'm lettin' 'em know 
 And if they hate it, can't embrace it, I'm lettin' 'em go 
 My heart was broken till you rode in and made it all right 
 Every word lifts me higher, it's like I can fly 
 But your words keep me grounded, I'm down for life 
 And if you say we need to get it I ride tonight 
 And yeah you never hear me say that I'm leavin' 
 And there is no one else I want so please believe me 
 And don't you ever leave me, I know you never will 
 Life wouldn't be the same, or remain, be sustained, it would change 
 Hook - Tauren Wells: 
 What's paradise, if you're not there? 
 What's paradise, with nobody to share? 
 'Cause I could have it all, but I don't care 
 If I don't have you 
 Then what's the point of paradise? 
 Paradise (x3) 
 No [x6] 
 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 What this is doesn't work without you 
 If you're not there then I don't wanna be too 
 I need you, more than I want you 
 I want what you have 
 This thing is forever, I'm down to make it last 
 But forever's no endeavor 
 If you're not there with me to share it worth havin' 
 It's drab lacks compassion 
 Couldn't bare it 
 I want you all the time and I 
 Couldn't handle it if you are not around 
 So I'm spendin' all my time to get to know you 
 Readin' all your love letters to feel closer to you 
 When I'm distant, you persistent, you pullin' me through 
 I wouldn't make it, like creation, not talking to you 
 Me with you, now that's an upgrade 
 Every time you step on the scene, I get upstaged 
 But you deserve that, right on the front page 
 I tell 'em all, don't sleep so I be up late 
 Verse 3 - Tedashii: 
 I could never be without you 
 Lead without you 
 I come alive but you couldn't breathe without you 
 Whatever you need, best believe I got you 
 I'll see you in paradise
