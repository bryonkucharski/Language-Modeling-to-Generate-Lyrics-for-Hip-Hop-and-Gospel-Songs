Growin' up in the south... 
 You know you just sit on the porch and watch the world go by... 
 And uh. 
 We see cats ridin' by lookin' clean man, sittin' on chrome and ridin' big boxes of bubbles and donks, you know what I'm sayin' with... 
 Somethin' starts to go wrong with your heart man when you, . 
 When you start livin' for that ride, you start worshipin' the ride almost you know what I'm talkin' about? You know we call that idolatry baby 
 You feel me?
