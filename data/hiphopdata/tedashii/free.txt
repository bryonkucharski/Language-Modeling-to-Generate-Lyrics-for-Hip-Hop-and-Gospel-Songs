Heaven presents another smash hit for Jesus, that keeps you rockin' when we're dropping phat masterpieces 
 I pray you seek this great God you should get to know Him, and if you do make it known so your set can know Him 
 We spit to show Him in all of His splendor and to share His matchless love that made me surrender 
 See we celebrate the Father who would send His Son because according to the text I was a wretch undone 
 Lord, I was lost in sin and lovin' my ways till You came to my rescue like government aid 
 Sin had me in a trial just like a subpoena, and in Your court I couldn't stand like a leg without the femur 
 So now instead of Judge Lord, I know You as Redeemer, You're sovereign even if there was a Hurricane Katrina 
 You saved men and You placed them in the prints of your feet 
 The Prince of Peace with nail prints that proves I'm free 
 Oh, I'm free, I've never known a love like Yours before, and now 
 I'm free, I've never known a life with peace and security 
 But Your love restores, and breaks down the doors 
 You looked passed me and saw my needs, and set me free, I'm free 
 I was bound to the Law, like a husband to a wife, there were standards I couldn't keep, it's like I cheated every night 
 Which made sin prevalent, bringin' death to life and provided me with the evidence we're in a losing fight 
 And like marriage, only death severs ties to the Law, knowing this Jesus stepped in and provided for your boy 
 He lived a perfect life fulfilling standards and perfection and gave men grace through His death and resurrection 
 Now if we'd only take turn for the better and realize that the cravings of the flesh will never let up 
 Then we see that cheddar in the possession of our mortal eyes hail when compared to the One immortalized 
 So now thanks to Christ I'm not an orphan like Annie because God adopted me and made me part of His family 
 Me and God are reunited and it feels so good, I praise God for the day that Keynon brought me good news 
 Oh, I'm free, I've never known a love like Yours before, and now 
 I'm free, I've never known a life with peace and security 
 But Your love restores, and breaks down the doors 
 You looked passed me and saw my needs, and set me free, I'm free 
 We see ordinary people getting lifted by John Legend, but this is when we get excited writing about John's legend 
 John 1:14 meet the Word in the flesh, Christ perfect in His person placing burdens to rest 
 But I'm free, no condemnation for me because I'm crucified with Christ, plus His love delivered me 
 God loved us enough that He would give His only kid, Jesus came to live the perfect life that none of us could live, and I'm free 
 There was a time when my heart was on the line 
 All of my hope was gone and my soul was out of time 
 But Your love restores and breaks down the doors 
 You looked passed me and saw my needs, and now I can say, I'm free 
 Oh, I'm free, I've never known a love like Yours before, and now 
 I'm free, I've never known a life with peace and security 
 But Your love restores, and breaks down the doors 
 You looked passed me and saw my needs, and set me free, I'm free
