I am just a man 
 With a name from Japan 
 In a war like Iran 
 When they fought, though, I ran 
 Though I stand, man confused 
 I don't know who I am 
 As they tricked me like a scam 
 Into the army, Uncle Sam 
 I don't wanna talk about it 
 Get into it but I'm in it 
 Born with it like my image as they long for something vintage 
 Fake games like a scrimmage as I'm pushin' to my limits 
 I just wanna get up out it like a college but I'm remy 
 Takin' shots from the rooftop like subliminal 
 I'm the one shootin' at myself like a criminal 
 I'm a Flo Rida but I'm something like a Seminole 
 I'm aimed low man I ain't talkin' about your dinner bro 
 That's just the start of it 
 Don't let my family part of it 
 Influence, truance, in these cuffs that'll scar your wrists 
 I don't think my heart's in it, it won't get better later 
 Sorry man I had to let you down like a elevator 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 I can't get with you 
 Naw, I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through, 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 I can't get with you 
 No, I can't get with you 
 Pain in my stomach turnin' 
 Pressure got my heart burnin' 
 Weird, 'cause the burn of the light doesn't feel as urgent 
 I remember hazy nights, bass pumpin' head thumpin' 
 Me extreme goin' off the deep end bungee jumpin' 
 But the pleasure that I got from that is feelin' like a coffin 
 That I feel trapped in till he came and bought me back 
 Christ entered in no more me tryna be you 
 Even more now I'm tryna help you see you 
 Evil like a serpent, you don't see it but it's certain 
 Chasin' cars with partitions in the end it's still curtains man 
 Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 But I shaped up, shipped out, in His army now 
 And He did the work, I just took what he was offerin' 
 Stopped makin' deals 'cause he wasn't into bargainin' 
 And where we come from, we don't have enough to bargain with 
 So I went all in, matter fact I called it quits 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 I can't get with you 
 Naw, I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through, 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 No I'm done, I'm through 
 I can't get with you 
 I can't get with you 
 No, I can't get with you 
 I know this sounds strange, morbid to you like a dead body 
 But I'm somethin' different now get that in your head shawty 
 I am not a pawn makin' moves like a chess game 
 I am not who I used to be, yeah a dead man 
 Resident evil gone, had to find a new home 
 Sorry that I had to let you down, and leave you alone 
 Sinnin' it ain't in me matter fact it doesn't master me 
 Even if I fall, man, the Master's love captured me 
 Changed like a dolla' I don't want it so I holla' 
 You will never see me goin' back to it like poppin' collars 
 So I'm sorry that I had to leave you but I found somethin' better 
 So I can't be you 
 And I can't get with ya
