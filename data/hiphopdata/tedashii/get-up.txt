Homeboy! When I walk, when I talk man it's more than just a show 
 This is life, reaf life, I'm not Truman that's fo' sho' 
 [?] Loco at home, long distance, on the road 
 Overseas, around the globe, yep, that's just how it go 
 Oh! I keep runnin' but my legs feel weak 
 Feel like I'm gon' slip, this a trip; leg sweep 
 But give up, I don't know the phrase, get up like the Sun was raised 
 That's just what I do since He got up from the grave 
 Goin' smart, arithmatic, do the math, watch it add up 
 Me and Him, that's a deal I couldn't pass up 
 Ay when I'm weak, He strong, ay when He right, I'm wrong 
 In Him I am too, man I knew that all along 
 So trust in Him, man His strength can go long 
 This call is too expensive, E.T. phone home 
 But He paid the bill, and put me on His plan 
 Now when I fall, when I ball, I get up by His hand 
 When we fall, GET UP! 
 'Cause this ain't all, GET UP! 
 It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP! 
 Stay on the grind, GET UP! 
 Ay all the time, GET UP! 
 Don't let it duke it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Leggo! I tell 'em get up, don't snooze or sleep 
 Let up, why? Better strive 
 Head to the road that's narrow so you can see what I seen with better eyes 
 [?] Your shadow feelin' your pain in a way that'll never die 
 Christ is [?] is easy as is televised 
 No, be strong in the grace that is found solely in He 
 Man, that spirit rose from the grave, it's safe to say 
 He lives in me 
 And you, indeed, stand with a truth [?] 
 Know that feelings could be lyin', so it's the Lion who 
 (?) 
 I said it's struggle gives grace, it's perseverance of the saints 
 It's only 'cause He holds [?] by His rope of love, but wait 
 There's more, in store, sanctification's taking place 
 [?] And you won't be in a perfect state till He returns 
 Till then we keep yearnin, learnin, discernin with 
 Sermons servin' the powerful in the world [?] the person, we will do it 
 Our faith will not be ruined 
 And not in any case it's by His grace that we pursue 
 Him 
 When we fall, GET UP! 
 'Cause this ain't all, GET UP! 
 It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP! 
 Stay on the grind, GET UP! 
 Ay all the time, GET UP! 
 Don't let it duke it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Oooah, so don't get lazy on my baby, uh uh, gotta keep it movin' 
 Train your body that's the aim like a 12 gauge shotty 
 Stay focused, life is crazy, hold your ground, call it rudy 
 This is not a game, but you feel like you keep losing 
 And it's real man, but still it's so hard to understand 
 But we never practice Godliness, we get it where we can 
 That's weak, yeah that's weak and that's just how it's gon' be 
 You can train physically and still never have strength 
 Ay, hangin' by a thread, feelin' weary and unstable 
 Look to Him who is strong, Kirk Franklin, He is able 
 He is God, we are not, we lazy and lack in faith 
 But you can persevere through it all; Imogo Dei 
 When we fall, GET UP! 
 'Cause this ain't all, GET UP! 
 It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP! 
 Stay on the grind, GET UP! 
 Ay all the time, GET UP! 
 Don't let it duke ya, it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Knock him dowm, get him up! 
 Oh! GET UP! 
 Oh! GET UP! 
 Oh! GET UP! 
 Oh! GET UP! 
 Oh! GET UP! 
 Oh! GET UP!
