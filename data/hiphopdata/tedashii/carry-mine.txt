Since before I was a notion to be complete and even before Vera and Victor would speak to meet 
 God predestined that the days I would hit the street 
 In a dorm on my own I would seek for peace 
 Then God showed up, and like the old folks say, "He showed out" 
 Gave me my grace plus peace and left no doubt 
 Its on now, I'm a new creature 
 The old is gone now 
 Instead of all that Jeezy its Jesus Musik that's on now 
 Switched, my affinities 
 Died to my amenities 
 And told all my partners I'ma live for infinity 
 I changed my allegiance with more than a pledge 
 And told all my boys stop mourning the dead (me) 
 I'll forever serve the Lord because He 
 Took that cross 
 Seem to lose all my boys but I took that loss 
 Cause who's my mother or my brother but the ones in Christ 
 And since the Lord decided to give us all one more night, then I'ma 
 Carry Mine 
 'Cause I believe He's God in the flesh 
 I carry mine 
 He's the one that gave me my breath 
 I carry mine 
 Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned 
 Living for the Lord has eternal reward 
 So I'ma carry mine 
 Turning from the lies that you heard that this world is better 
 Like 2nd Kings 7, sharing good news like the four lepers 
 That, this world is gone pass away 
 And we live in the last of day 
 Christ is the way to get pass the gate 
 Idolatrous men get snatched away 
 See man can gain the whole world but 
 Dog to what benefit 
 'Cause I promise you lose your souls investment at the end of it 
 See His rejections our blessing 
 We stressing the lesson 
 The Fathers acceptance of the rejected demands perfection 
 To stand in and then 
 Bare the brunt of man's sins 
 Cause He transcends man's trends so they call us mad men 
 But we ain't crazy we crunk 
 To give Him praises we pumped 
 Cause He ain't count equality with God a thing to be clutched 
 Instead died and rose on the 3rd 
 I went and opened His word 
 My eyes were opening up 
 Throw your hands in the air and surrender your life 
 And put your hands to the plow 
 Now, shout it loud dog 
 That I'ma 
 Carry Mine 
 'Cause I believe He's God in the flesh 
 I carry mine 
 He's the one that gave me my breath 
 I carry mine 
 Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned 
 Living for the Lord has eternal reward 
 So I'ma carry mine 
 Dog don't get it twisted 
 This a call to discipleship 
 Losing your life 
 That's the call a disciple gets 
 Daily 
 Following the scriptures of God 
 Getting intimate with intent as you listen to God 
 Da-Da-Daily 
 Down to crucifying your flesh 
 Forsaking worldly ambition cause He's supplying your blessings 
 See God hip me to his Son and I confessed like Peter 
 Revelation He's giving to end the beef like Ether 
 A passion so perfect I wanna spell it out like Retha 
 Who? 
 He took the cross and not a crown like Caesar did 
 When errbody and they momma was yelling out who they thought He was 
 He was in the cut 
 Training up His disciples 'cause 
 Giving them the proof of the truth that He would have to die 
 And the elders, chief priest, and scribes all pass Him by 
 Luke 9, who now 
 Down to rep and walk it out 
 Is it me, is it you 
 Matters not dog 'cause I'ma... 
 Carry Mine 
 'Cause I believe He's God in the flesh 
 I carry mine 
 He's the one that gave me my breath 
 I carry mine 
 Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned 
 Living for the Lord has eternal reward 
 So I'ma carry mine
