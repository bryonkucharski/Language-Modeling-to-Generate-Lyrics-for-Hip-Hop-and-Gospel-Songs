Hook - Crowder: 
 There's another world that I can see 
 Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me 
 There's another world inside of me 
 Where flesh battles spirit, I know, I can feel it 
 Both comfort me 
 Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 Tears fall to the floor like TKO 
 Heartbreak 'cause of pain never seen before 
 Blood spills, I get chills, it's not even cold 
 From paradise to the leauges below 
 They after me, they chasin' 
 Friday the 13 like Jason 
 In the dash, my heart's been racin' 
 Back and forth, man, I been pacin' 
 I know there's gotta be Satan' 
 I know there's gotta be Satan' 
 Or maybe it's me I'm facing 
 God please send me an angel 
 Or at least the police to arrest the thief 
 Tryna steal what's mine just to mess with me 
 Feels like I'm in a trial, are you testin' me? 
 Angels and demons, they stressin' me 
 Yeah, people swear that they blessin' me 
 Turns out to be the people that's vexin' me 
 Till I rest in peace, I thought you were a friend 
 But the sin is I begin 
 To pretend that life's all about me 
 And these so called friends that take advantage of ya 
 Hate who you are, but swear they love ya 
 It's rare to get this, but the two are open 
 Holy Spirit Come, come, come 
 Holy spirit Come, come, come 
 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 This ain't nothin' I ever did 
 Not really how I ever live 
 I ain't tryna say I never slip 
 But I guarantee this, that the devil real 
 Never claiming that I'm blameless 
 That's a fact well known, like famous 
 I'm adjusting where my aim is 
 But off in the dark, I'm shameless 
 Tryna drown my sorrow, and make it till tomorrow 
 It ain't a promise, man, it's just something I borrowed 
 Truth hurts most, so we hold a lot close 
 Side by side with another empty hope 
 Then the devil keeps on comin' 
 I'm tired from the runnin' 
 It started out small, now this thang is enormous high 
 And it keeps on callin' 
 Hard to take a stand when you keep on fallin' 
 But it feel so good, seem so right 
 If the dark this good I don't ever want the light 
 Forever want the night, cause the feels like its fire 
 Right behind closed doors, no relief in sight 
 God do for me what I cannot do 
 What I really don't want, what I need make true 
 God do for me what I cannot do 
 What I really don't want, what I need make true 
 There's another world that I can see 
 Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me 
 There's another world inside of me 
 Where flesh battles spirit I know I can feel it 
 Both comfort me 
 Holy spirit, come, come, come 
 Holy spirit, come, come, come
