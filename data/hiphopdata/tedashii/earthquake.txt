(Intro: Dimitri McDowell) 
 All I feel is 
 All I feel is 
 (Verse 1: Tedashii) 
 Ever seen a light dark (nope) 
 You ever seen that truth fail (nope) 
 You ever seen my God fail 
 Well how 'bout it, I doubt it 
 There's no way 
 He stay the same 
 Do the math, He won't ever change 
 Constant, this stopping 
 That's nonsense like no spare change 
 He's too good, yeah the best I know 
 So we holdin' on and ain't lettin' go 
 What you expect from all these folk 
 That's why we say this place is about to blow 
 We packed in to get back in 
 Guarantee you'll get the same reaction 
 When you mix His love with all His grace 
 Guarantee we get to spazzin' 
 (Hook: Dimitri McDowell) 
 I bet you never thought before 
 We can bring back 
 Earthquakes in here 
 Now that I found 
 The beauty in this 
 All I feel is, earthquakes in here [x4] 
 We about to blow up, so what? 
 (Verse 2: Tedashii) 
 You can have that 
 [?] From His life, I'ma fall back 
 Cheap imitation, what I call that 
 Love for junk, my only drawback 
 And I got that, I know that 
 Only light this bright can show that 
 I'll go there 
 Expose that 
 Ain't no way that I'm tryna blow that 
 So I blow up the spot 
 Let 'em know what I got 
 All this gets me close to the God 
 So no matter my problems 
 [?] And dyin' 
 You tell 'em I'm all in until I drop 
 Yeah, you know that 
 He's there for me so I hold back 
 I'ma give Him everything since He's broken every chain 
 Free so I'm gonna be a [?] on the island like... 
 (Verse 3: KB) 
 K to the second letter 
 They don't really do it like this no more 
 Got a hundred cats with me and they just won't fold (hundred cats with me) 
 Glory on it cause He rose 
 I call it Mick Jagger third day he's Rolling stones 
 Do it for the vine, nah I ain't gonna do it 
 Do it for the vine, nah I ain't gonna do it 
 But I do it for the vine 
 Branches of Yeshua 
 With the fans in the stands 
 Hands up and down, movin' 
 With the branch so we stand 
 Dancin' we not coolin' 
 For the Lamb, we advance 
 And to our God rulin' 
 Man our stance is 
 The man stance is to go stupid 
 Ay when we show up, blow up 
 (Outro: Dimiti McDowell) 
 All I feel is 
 Earthquakes in here 
 (x3) 
 We about to blow up, so what?
