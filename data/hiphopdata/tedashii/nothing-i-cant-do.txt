Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 You don't know what I been through 
 Lost it all and my rent's due 
 Trouble, when it rains it floods 
 In my pain no it ain't all good 
 No but I tell them this 
 I'm a witness 
 That everything is made new 
 So tell em' dawg I ain't through 
 Feels like feels like this life just became a fight 
 Yeah I'm in it they know it 
 I know pressures on me 
 Yeah there's pressure on me 
 But tell 'em who ain't crack homie 
 Hook - Trip Lee: 
 I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Look it ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 OK life, for most, we know that this is not paradise 
 But we swear it's tight when she wear it right 
 I feel the heat it's Miami Vice 
 It's the rest in me to get the rest of me 
 You start burnin for that but ain't no turning me back 
 That's pressing me and they testing to me 
 To see me fail and give me Hell so I'd be burnin in that 
 Yeah right, life is an island which means we trapped in that 
 But we cool cause the view so nice and lax 
 And like we don't feel the pain cause' of laughing gas 
 But one blast of that and you forget that this pain is real 
 Yeah but no matter how good that feel 
 Man this pain is a thing that kill 
 Man I heard that so I swerve back 
 Curve that so let me curve back 
 Every time I feel that urge back 
 We crossing paths where we merge at 
 It drives we crazy but lately 
 Man I feel like I can make it 
 Cause' last year I couldn't take it 
 And His strength man I can say this 
 Hook - Trip Lee: 
 I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Look it ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Bridge - Trip Lee: 
 Might walk on water 
 I won't lose a step 
 Got-gotta go hard 
 But I ain't gotta do it myself 
 I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Feelin' like I can't lose 
 There ain't nothin' I can't do 
 Verse 3 - Lecrae: 
 Hold up 
 What you say all that fame done gone to my head 
 Like that same power that save me 
 Can't raise me from the dead 
 They get me reading thinking bout keeping peace 
 While I'm raging war on myself 
 I feeling myself then I'm killing myself 
 I'm sipping on blood and I'm chewing on flesh 
 Just chill out we don't want to hear that mess 
 All that won't do that I can't do this 
 Pain, death, hurt, hate we done been through this 
 And I'm sure there's plenty more that I ain't been through yet 
 But I don't care though, bring on the heavy metal 
 I got a power living in me that'll never settle 
 Never leave nor for sake I'm a bleed never break 
 I'm a die come back with the keys to the safe 
 Gotta peek sitting deep for the things that I face 
 Can't erase God's ink wait clean with the paint 
 And I'm stained in it when the pain hit me 
 I would stain anything that you bring to me 
 They love to tell me what I can't do faithfully 
 They love to tell me what I can't do faithfully 
 They love to tell me what I can't do faithfully 
 I'm coming back from the dead what you saying to me 
 I can't do
