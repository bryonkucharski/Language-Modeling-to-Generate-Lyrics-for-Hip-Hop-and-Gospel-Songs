Remember when we were kids/saying things that were did 
 By me and you but too ashamed to admit that th-th-they were fibs 
 Sippin' on Mr. Pibb/playing with neighbors kids 
 And I front to fall asleep/so I could chill at your crib 
 House parties like play and kid/listening to Gangster Nip 
 Tripping off Ghetto Boys/how they mind kept playing tricks 
 Hide and seek with my sisters friends/Tonight like DJ Quick 
 Natural born sinners slowly losing our innocence 
 This was all just the start of it/like working with a starter kit 
 I went from bad to worse when I saw Cube put on that Starter fit 
 Pressure started marching in/cause all my friends were part it 
 It seduced me even more/like a girl who plays hard to get 
 "Cool" gave my heart a kiss/told me, give my all to this 
 Did it all/so I felt obligated to be part of this 
 Anything to garner this/stardom that was hard to miss 
 Fartherless, so Hollywood guided, through the dark abyss 
 Stepped in the cineplex/just passed the Cinnabon fin to see what's playing next 
 (Yes) 
 Hollywood 
 (HEY) I got my butter and my popcorn 
 My crew is with me and we feeling like it's not wrong 
 Hollywood 
 Like it's so cool to watch upcoming attractions, blinded by the distractions 
 Don't be so complacent 
 With cheap imitations 
 Need godly inspiration so we can't replace it, with HOLLYWOOD 
 Remember when we were kids 
 Saying things that were did

 Hooping up at the gym 
 Lust had us chasing Kim 
 Acting hard but riding clean bumping that BoysIIMen 
 Watching the latest films 
 Quote it and take it in 
 Lustful flesh 
 Had us actin' gangsta like Doughboy did 
 Lived like them 
 Boys in the hood but stayed trill 
 Out the Tre, so you can say I'm Furious Styles kid 
 My Love Jones was shai 
 But my Justice was Poetic 
 All I needed was the Juice 
 Ad then my Blues would be Mo' Better 
 I would listen to the Preacher's Wife 
 But I'd go back like Boomerang 
 My set would Set It Off and we'd be right back in that New Jack swang 
 Pride of Life had me like O-Dog and Higher Learning guided me 
 Momma said Lean On Me 
 But I'm a Menace to Society 
 All that "drama" mixed with sinning, the women with them in linen 
 Seem to spark a cycle unrivaled and never ending (ending) 
 Stepped in the cineplex 
 Just passed the Cinnabon fin to see what's playing next 
 (Yes) 
 Hollywood 
 (HEY) I got my butter and my popcorn 
 My crew is with me and we feeling like it's not wrong 
 Hollywood 
 Like it's so cool to watch upcoming attractions, blinded by the distractions

 I been learning from this teacher, since 
 I was in the nursery 
 A victim of its preaching 'cause she said she'd give the world to me 
 At least that's what I thought I heard 
 Hollywood was celebrated 
 She could easily mess up the lines of real and imitation 
 And like Adam, we ate the fruit of prideful racketeering 
 Just so we could all see Eve without the leaves 
 And bangled earrings 
 It's the lies that they tell you, you start to believe 
 And if truth is what you make it 
 Then you're ready to receive 
 A slave to the trade/sinful ways cause of this artistry 
 Until I met the One, who was knocking at my hearts entry 
 Some say He's unattractive when compared to the glitz and glam 
 But, I was glad to look behind the bush to see a ram 
 Who set me free from sin, along with false identity 
 Because until we know the Savior, God is our enemy 
 So don't let the world and its devices, advise you 
 Instead trust the truth of the Father found in the bible
