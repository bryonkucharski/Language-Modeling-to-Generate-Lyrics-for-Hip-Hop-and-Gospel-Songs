Let's go! (oh x 16) 
 You know what it is 
 See them hands, let let let me see them hands 
 You know what it is 
 See them hands, let let let me see them hands 
 Let me see them hands to the sky like this a stick up 
 Yeah we goin' onward and nobody sippin' liquor 
 I'm fresh, brand new, man, somebody take a picture 
 I'm feelin' so official, throw the flag, blow the whistle 
 Set it off, blow it up, but, but you can keep the missile 
 Grace through the mediator, my ?? 
 ...In the middle 
 Through Him we get the "W" so you can call me winner 
 Yes sir, gave the Lord control, command, shift, enter 
 Some aimin' for the stars, most drive a mini-missile 
 Man, I'm aimin for the Lord, through the Son, that's how we get em' 
 This is more than just some music, it's a movement, see the Scriptures? 
 'Cause I'm pride in the Lord, but humble since my beginning 
 Humbled from the start 
 My pride is in the cross 
 Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up, 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off 
 Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Hey 
 The Father's who I follow, he runs it out like a Cannon 
 Tryin' to bring you out the dark, somebody turn the flash on 
 So you can get the picture, He's the reason you ain't passed on 
 He's gracious plus He's patient, He hates it when one is passed on 
 Not over, it ain't over, roger that, come back now over 
 Pride'll kill ya, lies'll kill ya, gassed up like Exxon-Mobil 
 Get you lookin' at yourself just like Face Off with John Travolta 
 Watch it - pride'll have you tryin' to network and netflirt like Oprah 
 Hey, but I'm humbled by the Cross, for real 
 Somebody tell Ross I know who the Boss, for real 
 Pride leads you to destruction, get you lost, for real 
 But the humble in Him can boast in Him - floss, for real 
 Humbled from the start 
 My pride is in the cross 
 Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up, 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off 
 Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Hey 
 Now you might wanna lean with it, might wanna rock with it 
 Might wanna do the Superman, or Cat Daddy, Dougie, pop and lock with it (Go'n and get it) 
 On that Psalm 30:11, I know my God did it (Gotta dance) 
 Ain't no pride in it, (walk and talk) 
 You know the Rock's in it 
 I know we're loco with the dudes that don't flow 
 My bros in dark clothes [?] with the Lord, it's top [?] 
 You hear these lines and hooks? Homie, we fishermen - we preach. 
 Watch this Gospel network, gettin' good reception with 3Gs 
 Our souls are so low to behold the Lord of hosts 
 To know, conozco, don't wanna go until you know 
 I'm safer than Noah when the flood came, homie, I rejoice. 
 His cross is beyond the arc, he nailed it - three points. 
 Humbled from the start 
 My pride is in the cross 
 Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up, 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off 
 Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up 
 Hey
