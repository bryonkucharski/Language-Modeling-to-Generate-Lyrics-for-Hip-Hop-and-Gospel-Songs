Grace and Peace, take a seat 
 Hey let's get into this man (1:1) 
 It's been a minute so let's get it because I'm amped on his name 
 Now as you all know 
 Paul wrote and said he couldn't wait to see us (2:17) 
 He said he tries but I quote, "Satan still impedes us." (2:18) 
 So until he can make it we read the letters he sends 
 That says he's not forsaken 
 Even when oppression begins (1:4, 5:23-24) 
 So lets begin with the fifth lesson for today and tomorrow 
 Cause Paul answers questions you have about today and tomorrow (Ch. 5) 
 And whether or not the Saviors coming back, today or tomorrow (5:2) 
 Instead of sharing the time/he exhorts us to pray and stay watchful (5:6) 
 It's easily seen like signs of a pregnant woman who shows (5:3) 
 And a thief in the night is surprise 
 If you're watching your doors (5:4-6) 
 So tomorrow's worries weaken when we're waiting with hope (5:8) 
 Anticipating his arrival keeps you ready for sho! (sure) 
 Lesson four can bring us more of an insight to this section (Ch. 4) 
 Especially when we start discussing the dead's resurrection (4:14-16) 
 Remember Paul wrote, those who are sleeping 
 That past on 
 Won't be passed over 
 So stop the grieving (4:16) 
 For if we believe in Jesus Christ and that He's still living (4:14) 
 We also believe He'll take those who are asleep as Christians (4:14) 
 So the topic of tomorrow is not my concern 
 Just the fact He's coming back and that He's soon to return (4:16) 
 Now with that on my mind/it makes today so crucial 
 Because the God who's coming back desires to live through you (1:5-6) 
 You took the word as it is 
 Let His love be fruitful in (1:6) 
 Your works of Faith and Love, so 
 Keep the faith (1:3) 
 It'll get a little harder 
 Yeah, yeah (2:2) 
 It'll get a little rougher 
 Oh Yeah (2:14) 
 But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3) 
 Now I know you wondering how this affects us today man (4:13) 
 But you need the background to be effective today man 
 Do you remember lesson two when Paul called us his crown (2:19) 
 His boast before the Lord because we was holding it down (2:19-20) 
 'Cause we heeded to the lessons that he taught to the crowd (2:13-14) 
 So much so 
 We all decided we would take our idols down (1:9) 
 And the news begin to spread fast all over town (1:8-9) 
 From our people to their people 
 In the towns that surround (1:8) 
 We proclaim the name of Jesus while we walking around 
 And it's crazy cause our neighbors started following us 'round (1:6-7) 
 Lesson 1 gives the reason why we all in this now 
 God predestined he would save this Thessalonians town (1:4) 
 He elected us for truth and Paul strolled into town (1:5) 
 Without the Gospel as a lifeguard we all would have drown (2:13) 
 In the sins of men and trends that be bogging you down (1:9) 
 We were homeless with no family like a dog in a pound (1:4) 
 Till God decided to go looking through the lost and the found (5:24) 
 And He spared us from His wrath that He'll be calling down (1:10) 
 Don't you get it? 
 We did, that's the reason why we miss him 
 Paul was like our father who taught us 
 All how to be Christian (2:11) 
 Like with the motherless 
 He nurtured us 
 And showed us his vision (2:7-8) 
 He loves us 
 That's why when he prays we're constantly mentioned (1:2-3) 
 So the call for us today is we continue his mission (4:10) 
 Long to lead a quiet life and to attend to your own business (let's get it) (4:11) 
 You took the word as it is 
 Let His love be fruitful in (1:6) 
 Your works of Faith and Love, so 
 Keep the faith (1:3) 
 It'll get a little harder 
 Yeah, yeah (2:2) 
 It'll get a little rougher 
 Oh Yeah (2:14) 
 But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3) 
 There is joy in the firmness of your faith (3:7-9) 
 There is life in you embracing his grace (3:8) 
 So keep praying 
 And rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience 
 And just keep the faith (5:15-18) 
 There is hope in His return and that He will come (1:3,10) 
 There is peace in the promise of His love (5:23-24) 
 So keep praying 
 And rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience 
 And just keep the faith (5:15-18) 
 So in conclusion for today, I say 
 Continue in faith (1:3) 
 With love/Hoping in the day 
 The Lord will snatch us away (1:3) 
 Be an example for the saints that we find in Achaia (1:7) 
 Standing strong 
 No matter what 
 Reproducing the savior 
 Cause the joy of a teacher is when his students can grasp it 
 It's mastered 
 And we live on through you training up the masses (1:8) 
 And honor you leaders 
 In love 
 Appreciate their work (5:12) 
 Servant leaders making disciples as we create the church 
 Remember to exhort and comfort to alleviate the hurt (5:14) 
 And run from every form of evil to not deviate the church (5:22) 
 Though we imitate the saints and the God that we serve (1:6) 
 There are still great afflictions that can rattle your nerves 
 And this life will get so trife and it'll throw you a curve 
 And there are people who live evil 
 Feeding a sexual urge (4:5) 
 So be holy/living solely 
 For His glory (5:19-22) 
 Possessing your body rightly in the purity that he showed us (4:3-4, 5:22) 
 Cause no matter how much we grow 
 Or no matter how far we go 
 We still could do some more 
 Even if Timothy gave a good report (3:6) 
 So lets continue to work and labor 
 And endure in this race (4:1) 
 Eagerly hoping for the moment we will see His face (yeah) (1:10) 
 You took the word as it is 
 Let His love be fruitful in (1:6) 
 Your works of Faith and Love, so 
 Keep the faith (1:3) 
 It'll get a little harder 
 Yeah, yeah (2:2) 
 It'll get a little rougher 
 Oh Yeah (2:14) 
 But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)
