Don't get confused baby 
 Don't get confused 
 Don't get confused 
 Don't get confused 
 Don't get confused 
 The gospel got me so good, I call it super straight 
 Was lame till He came, I know that you relate 
 Was dead to Him but lead to Him, He rejuvenates 
 Still can't believe He caught me up, yeah elevated 
 That's how I know He got me, His love is never endin' 
 And that's just like the Gospel 
 It's for sure is never pending 
 Not just from my beginning, 
 Keeps me until I'm finished 
 Takes me way beyond the grave. I'm saved, eternal livin' 
 This goes beyond conversion, this gift just keeps on giving 
 Iad it makes no sense to start and stop. Now pop that clutch and shift it' 
 I'm hoping you don't miss it, this here is target practice. 
 I'm asking, "What good are Beats By Dre if you can't grasp this?" 
 (Hah, uh-uh) That ain't even right man 
 Play it to the left of lust, mental pics, tight frame 
 You crop it like a close-up, then chop it like the chorus 
 I'm tryna take you deep, call it Blacklight, mayne 
 Aye this that good news music, 
 We call it Gospel 
 We call it Gospel 
 We call it Gospel 
 Don't get confused baby 
 It's what He used to save me 
 It's what He used to keep me 
 (I, I, I) I need it daily 
 (You, You, You) You need it daily 
 (We, we, we) We need it daily 
 (They, they, they) They need it daily 
 (I) Yeah I need it daily 
 (They, they they) Yeah I need it daily 
 (You, you, you) You need it daily 
 (We, we, we) We need it daily 
 They need it daily 
 Boy let's get it clear, from the Lord's wrath I'm saved 
 Yeah I'm gucci mayne, no Waka Flocka Flame 
 So secure in the Lord, no frontin' for people 
 Cause you can die stuntin' (Die stuntin') 
 Evil Kenevil 
 In this New Jack City hold the world loosely 
 His Word keep callin' me, I'm itchin for it, call me Pookie 
 Satan try to trap us like "Go pursue sin" 
 I'm like "Silly rabbit, Trixs are for kids." 
 I know only in Christ we gon' be free 
 Through His blood we've been redeemed 
 Them chains no longer holdin' me (So) 
 Clique for the squad, for the love of God, boy we rollin' 40 Deep (and) When I want to run the love of the son through the Helper, get a hold of me (see) 
 Christ died for us, we'll say He's a church fan 
 I'm talkin' Gospel, minus the church fan 
 I'd be a fool minus the Lord's hand 
 So I'm wrapped around His finger like a wedding band 
 Aye this that good news music, 
 We call it Gospel 
 We call it Gospel 
 We call it Gospel 
 Don't get confused baby 
 It's what He used to save me 
 It's what He used to keep me 
 (I, I, I) I need it daily 
 (You, You, You) You need it daily 
 (We, we, we) We need it daily 
 (They, they, they) They need it daily 
 (I) Yeah I need it daily
