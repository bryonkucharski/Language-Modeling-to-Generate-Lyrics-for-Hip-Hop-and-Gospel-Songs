Eighteen years a flesh and she news to the Lord, 18 years a fish and she's new to the yard 
 She's a baby drinking milk instead of food that is hard, but she chose to take the challenge though she knew it was hard 
 Knew what it was to feel pain since she was 2 in the yard, memories of daddy getting merked catching 2 in the heart 
 Plus her momma was a product of 70s crack parties, the lack of supervision allowed her to act naughty 
 She skipping all class but goin' to frat parties, dressed to kill, dolled up, they call her the black Barbie 
 She rocks the hottest fashion masking her heart's darting pain behind Greeks saying "Hey, what up shorty?" 
 She's loving the attention ignoring her conviction because she's up in college getting noticed like evictions 
 And for the first time it's like she finally found significance, she's catching compliments but at the cost of her innocence 
 Don't play yourself like that (like that), make a change I'll tell you where it's at (where it's at) 
 Place your faith in Christ and He'll bring you back, bring you back to reality man 
 'Cause you're stuck in a world full of sin, full of pain, full of scars, money, fashion, and cars 
 So go ahead and make Him King of your heart and you'll find yourself in Him 
 Young dude up in college feeling cocky like 2 glocks, up in the dorm writing Dear Mama letters like Tupac 
 Mad at the world that's trying to break him into 2 parts, feeling cheated, defeated, he's looking for a new start 
 His momma lied bout cheating on his daddy, he couldn't trust her, far as he concerned his real daddy was a busta 
 So since he couldn't discern this stuff, nowhere to turn and trust he burned the kush and turned to lust 
 Women was his escape, adolescence his scapegoat, all the pressures of life wore him down like he played sports 
 He played sports but that was just for attention his struggles with insecurities made him feel insufficient 
 The thoughts of other men concerning him kept concerning him, he thought if he didn't please them then there's no love for him 
 Prisoned within himself by the vision of himself, so disgusted with life he wished he was someone else 
 Don't play yourself like that (like that), make a change I'll tell you where it's at (where it's at) 
 Place your faith in Christ and He'll bring you back, bring you back to reality man 
 'Cause you're stuck in a world full of sin, full of pain, full of scars, money, fashion, and cars 
 So go ahead and make Him King of your heart and you'll find yourself in Him 
 Nobody told us God wanted a relationship, they just said that He was Master with a patient whip 
 Out to get me if I chose to forsake His gift saying my sin would be the reason if His patience dipped 
 And I ain't perfect so I figured that He must hate me, (must hate me) so my hope was to not frustrate things 
 So I gave Him very Sunday plus my bedtime prayer, and instead of my girl's room I went to bed downstairs 
 I lived everyday thinking that His love was conditional believing the subliminals that God was never into us 
 But despite my world views and my girl's views I decided to side with the God who changed my world views 
 It ain't worth it man to work your hand to plan to please the people, see I'm certain man assertive hands stand to see the cement 
 All men will bow to this God who's real, and because of His love your significance is 
 Don't play yourself like that (like that), make a change I'll tell you where it's at (where it's at) 
 Place your faith in Christ and He'll bring you back, bring you back to reality man 
 'Cause you're stuck in a world full of sin, full of pain, full of scars, money, fashion, and cars 
 So go ahead and make Him King of your heart and you'll find yourself in Him
