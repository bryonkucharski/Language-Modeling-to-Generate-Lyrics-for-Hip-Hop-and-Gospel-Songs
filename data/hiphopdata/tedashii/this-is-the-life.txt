Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you) 
 Not without you no no (no!) 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you) 
 Not without you no no (no!) 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 I got a first class flight, to where I live 
 I'm here now, but dead too, like I had a twin 
 That's the beauty of a paradox 
 Too like a pair of socks 
 Hearin' that see in double no Henny shots, shots! 
 Ain't no liquor in my liver 
 I just wanna take a picture that this life gives ya 
 Hope in the King like Coretta 
 And if it doesn't get betta, I know it will when He comes and get us 
 Or when we get up yeah, you see I'm done 
 I know I just left but I was already home 
 Sittin' where the King seat, right there by the throne 
 And even though I pass away, I am neva gone 
 So now, I wait on my position, I feel the tension like I'm lifted while I'm waitin' on my pinchin' 
 Pain cuts deep, with no visible incision but I'm healed as a heal 'cause I live in that dimension. 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you) 
 Not without you no no (no!) 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 Couldn't live it without you (I can't live without you) 
 Not without you no no (no!) 
 Yes I'm livin' the life 
 I mean there's got to be more to this world man 
 It's broken, I've seen it, but not only have I seen it, I've lived it 
 When you're in a nightmare and dreams seem to have limits 
 And you scream to heaven but they don't pass the ceiling 
 What a awkward feeling, you sellin your body with every touch, you're dyin' but you're still making a killin' 
 You want more then sex and possession 
 We stand on our corner 'cause we can't see progression...? 
 Wise in our eyes, broken kings seekin' treasure, but if we're broken rulers then we're takin' broken measures
