Folks having hard times 
 Living in the world so cold 
 Life dealt them cards now 
 People trying hard not to fold 
 Pressures their heart now 
 Feels like they bout to explode 
 While feeling down they asking, "Is this the life that I chose?" 
 It seems so unfair 
 Man we just trying to survive 
 But it's like no one cares 
 We living life just to die 
 And when I come share 
 That Jesus cares about your life 
 Their heart is hard, they disbelieve 
 And they filled with too much pride to cry out 
 LORD 
 I surrender my all, or cry 
 LORD 
 Will you answer my call 
 Cause this life is not easy 
 God why I gotta be me 
 It's hard for me to trust 'cause when I do somebody leaves me 
 See, life without Christ is not life, it's daydreaming 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces 
 Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 LORD peep the hood child 
 Rocking Ones with an ice grill 
 Folks say he should smile 
 His mug's mean cause life is 
 He wants that good life 
 A caddlac truck with nice rims 
 And the culture says to get it live like the thugs live 
 A hustlers ambition 
 Since the day he was born 
 I wished it was different 
 Is this place really the norm 
 So when I go witness 
 God's forgiveness seems foreign 
 And his heart is dark, he disagrees and he's filled with too much scorn to cry 
 LORD 
 Will you take me as I am or cry 
 LORD 
 Can you make me a new man 
 Cause this life is so greasy 
 God why I gotta be me 
 Why can't I be that dude I saw rapping on the TV 
 Questions by some who blind to the grace that freed me 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces 
 Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 This world is gone pass away 
 So LORD my prayer is they get it 
 Your could probably come back today 
 And a lot of these folks just might miss it 
 Caught up in their worldly ways 
 Not knowing they could change in an instance 
 It just takes faith to get in this 
 But it's been replaced by religion 
 So cats remain blind 
 Thinking that their works just might save 
 Some just stay high 
 Thinking there's no way you would take 'em 
 Saying it's a hard life 
 Complaining when I go witness and 
 I ask them, what if God did this so He could get your attention 
 So you'd cry 
 LORD 
 I confess and believe 
 Or cry, LORD 
 I see it's you that I need 
 Cause change is so hard 
 And life is mean in these streets 
 And it seems there is no God 
 But see since Adam and Eve 
 Mankind is so lost 
 Confused on the path they should walk 
 And so... 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall 
 Day in and Day out 
 I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces 
 Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe 
 Everywhere I go its still the same song 
 Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on 
 To a life that He gives 
 Doubting who is 
 Don't doubt, don't doubt 
 You gotta believe
