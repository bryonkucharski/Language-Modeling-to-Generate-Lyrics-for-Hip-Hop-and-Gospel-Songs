This is our lifestyle, working till our lights out 
 No 9 to 5 I'm His work at work I mean right now 
 Give me a clean heart Lord to show your attributes 
 I pray You take me out this life if I turn my back on You 
 The Rock of Ages rocks this nation likes distorted basses, my proclamation- God's amazing His love drives me crazy 
 My occupation- teaching freedom from the blocks of slavery, like doctor's patients we need saving like adopted babies 
 'Cause we're endentured dead walking to our devastation, but call me Morgan I'm a freeman no more driving Daisy 
 And by His Spirit He enlightened my heart, gave me a start and showed me that there's hope despite when it's dark, no lie 
 Cause prior to salvation I was walking in sin, just call me Treach because my nature was as naughty as his 
 And I was darkened within just like a house without the lights on, till God gave me life like your team when they hear the fight song 
 And now the fight's on, lifestyle reppin the Father, if sin is Roy Jones then call me Antonio Tarver 
 Go harder than ballas in college who on scholarship in order to know of the Father through more than just scholarship 
 This is our lifestyle, working till our lights out 
 No 9 to 5 I'm His work at work I mean right now 
 Give me a clean heart Lord to show your attributes 
 I pray You take me out this life if I turn my back on You 
 Hey now we crowd corners with Bibles spitting warnings through rhymes with crowds forming 'bout the One that's coming 
 Saying bump it if rejected 'cause they drunk and in dejected, like Paul I'll endure it for the sake of the elected 
 Working for the Father because works should be the fruit of faith and not the vice versa because works can't bring you saving grace 
 Then through regeneration it's like He changed the station, He cleans your heart then fixes it to seek sanctification 
 Thus a new nature from the nomaly that's phenomenal, prodigal to adopted son so I'll go beyond the call 
 Aw y'all done messed up and let us in your hood, I rep the Savior who was hazed but He took the wood 
 This is my lifestyle, nope will never pipe down, until the day that I'm dead I'll cast out this lifeline 
 This is my lifestyle, nope will never pipe down, until the day that I'm dead I'll cast out this lifeline 
 This is our lifestyle, working till our lights out 
 No 9 to 5 I'm His work at work I mean right now 
 Give me a clean heart Lord to show your attributes 
 I pray You take me out this life if I turn my back on You 
 Elected and I'm born again, justified though born in sin, purchased with a price through Christ my life it now belongs to Him 
 His workmanship is seen through the workmanship of His work done, me a masterpiece of the Master's piece through His merked Son 
 Saved to works of righteousness, grace through faith ignited this, there's no condemnation for those clothed in His Christ-likeness 
 Oh yes I'm a new creature, no sex lying with Sheba, in Christ there's new life not through my might but it's found in Jesus 
 Since I received His great salvation I'm His master work, He surpassed my work passed me work, that's just how the Master works 
 Now like I'm in detention in school I'm in position, new life new rights new sight new fight through Christ that's my description 
 So now I'll walk in the good works that have been prepared for me, God'll work them out I just trust in faith that He's there for me 
 And live this life with boldness standing to proclaim His name walking in holiness bearing fruit as one who claims His name
