I see kids, 
 Wildin' out 
 They pops was out 
 I see it like a flash back 
 That empty life 
 Now in Christ, I finally got my dad back 
 God was that he snatched me back he got me off that fast track 
 Of chasing dreams and manish things 
 Like power, pleasure, and respect 
 Taught me that a selfish view, never was a healthy view 
 Here's some help for you who struggle too, living past that 
 Selfish gain or selfless aim, hey baby they gone clash black 
 Worldly wisdom or scripture, it ain't but one that has facts 
 Tried it all, all alone, but found that I was handicapped 
 Strength I lacked 
 Abused by this world you can have it back 
 See the fact remains I was changed when I heard his name 
 I know he's real 
 And I'll never be the same 
 I'm in love with one hand in the sky 
 I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes 
 I know I was born into sin 
 But now I'm in Christ yes I'm born to win 
 I know, I know, that Jesus lives 
 And I know, I know he is my king 
 And that's why, that's why I'll always sing 
 Jesus 
 Thank you for saving my life 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 (Hey) thank you for saving my life 
 See with us evident, most of us, we hope; I know, to get inside 
 We expect to be in heaven but baby we gotta die 
 Die physically and inwardly 
 But some men will be 
 Foolish in their ways and trust they self continually 
 Growing in their pride, eyes closed so they can't see 
 Walking blind all the time, too arrogant to see their need 
 I can hear the preacher preach, reaching out to you and me 
 Begging us to look to Jesus and no longer be deceived 
 Cie-cie-cieved, by the enemy 
 Or the sin in me 
 That says to be sufficient independently 
 I'm so glad to be walking on the straight and narrow 
 I know that god got me if his eye is on the sparrow 
 I'm in love with one hand in the sky 
 I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes 
 I know I was born into sin 
 But now I'm in Christ yes I'm born again 
 I know, I know, that Jesus lives 
 And I know, I know he is my king 
 And that's why, that's why I'll always sing 
 Jesus 
 Thank you for saving my life 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 (Hey) thank you for saving my life 
 So from the newest life, the truest life 
 I know that he's real 
 From the changes in my stride to the way that I feel 
 Something different, you sense it 
 Even momma was trippin' 
 Wondering like alice asking me, hey boy what's gotten in you 
 I said, Jesus is real (heeey) 
 This ain't just a religion 
 I done tried to practice habits but man nothing was sticking 
 But his love and his joy and the peace that he brings 
 Man was dead in sin till Jesus came on the scene 
 Now it's a wrap 
 For ya boy 
 No more, quiet on set 
 I'm telling everyone I know 
 I ain't ashamed to represent 
 I love him 
 No one above him 
 I'll forever worship 
 Hands high to the sky 
 As I show my love to him 
 (Sing) 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh 
 Jesus, thank you for saving my life 
 I'm in love with one hand in the sky 
 I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes 
 I know I was born into sin 
 But now I'm in Christ yes I'm born again 
 I know, I know, that Jesus lives 
 And I know, I know he is my king 
 And that's why, that's why I'll always sing 
 Jesus 
 Thank you for saving my life 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh 
 (Hey) thank you for saving my life
