Do you remember when you first got saved? And felt the feeling of the quenching of the thirst God gave 
 Do you remember when your members all were rendered back to sender and the feeling of His sealing satisfied like a Snicker 
 There's relief from the grief of the thief through belief 
 So excited about His peace you recited it to your peeps so delighted to hit the streets plus excited to win His sheep 
 However we passively sever the action we zealously seek (why?) 
 Fear begins to increase because you notice your peeps would rather celebrate the world than ever embrace His peace 
 They seem to find it in sweets, toting holsters of heat, finding comfort like the Isley Brothers in between the sheets 
 To them the gospel message is foolish and unfulfilling so you base the Great Commission on whether or not they feeling you 
 The gospel's offensive except to repentive, so man up for the manna from Heaven and represent Him 
 We press our claim we make it plain 
 Hey it's on now 
 Phanatik's insane with this thang 
 Hey it's on now 
 Elected and chosen to rep 
 Main it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now 
 Verse 2 (Phanatik): 
 I can remember when heaven made the connection and stepped into my section and blessed me with the blessing 
 Of a calling and election, He made the call and collection I was all in awe of Him plus I was all in for reppin, But 
 I can remember when my feet started slipping and I almost lost my grip 'cause I was grappling with dipping 
 Into the forbidden to fulfill desires that were hidden not facing temptation with the blatent statement it is written, Now, isn't it blasphemous to live life like we have to get this lavish lifestyle while acting like creaturely happiness is just as important as watching our Maker sporting a smile while He staring at us while we're spinning on our access 
 This isn't Hell but I'm sure this isn't heaven, it's sort of short of a little bit of both cause both of them are present in the sense that both are possible, watch it the only obstacle stopping you from going to one or the other is the God you know 
 We press our claim we make it plain 
 Hey it's on now 
 Phanatik's insane with this thang 
 Hey it's on now 
 Elected and chosen to rep 
 Main it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now 
 See acts of sin taxes men, finds a corner and backs you in, and embarrassment harass men till you silent like passive men 
 Don't let fear grip you, know the Spirit is with you and be encouraged cause there are saints that have seen what you've been through 
 We got Phanatik and T-dot on the beat, ride with our feet shod with the gospel of peace, we won't keep quiet 
 If the Lord keeps us from cherishing sin or fearing men to the point that we're embarrassed of Him 
 So what's the deezy? We either scared or snared b and one of them has got us caught up and we scared to share 
 But they won't beat us into silence and no keeping us quiet, see we love Him too much just to be kept muzzled and bridled 
 My tongue/, (yours too) is powerful like shotgun power when it gets left out it gets set on blaze 
 That's how come/I will bridle it and won't leave it idle and let it off unless it's setting off praise 
 We press our claim we make it plain 
 Hey it's on now 
 Phanatik's insane with this thang 
 Hey it's on now 
 Elected and chosen to rep 
 Main it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now 
 It's on now, it's on now
