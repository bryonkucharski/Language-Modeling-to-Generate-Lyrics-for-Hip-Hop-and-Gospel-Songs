 You try to bury my flame, I'll tell you to fire away 
 Without a shadow of doubt no you 
 Can't put my fire out 
 Can't put my fire out 
 Can't put my fire out 
 Can't put my fire out 
 I'll tell 'em fire away 
 Fire Away [x2] 
 I'll tell 'em fire away

 Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 OK, if life's a game 
 I'm the referee 
 I'll give you some and keep the rest for me 
 All in my mix like a recipe 
 Free like the cops almost arrested me 
 Might be a little off, no correcting me 
 Go straight across like intersections please 
 He's directing me 
 So till I Rest in Peace 
 I plan to keep the plan, what you expect of me 
 I took a blow like Tyson's punch 
 And I feel like Job, was he out to lunch 
 Was this the plan, Is it in His hand 
 I don't understand 
 What does He really want 
 Oh well no fail, I might not never know 
 This life frail, but it sever slow 
 So until He cuts me off I ain't letting go 
 My fire gone burn forever more 
 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 They say you acting like he ain't save you 
 Saying it's love 'cause they claim to 
 But be careful dawg 'cause they'll play you 
 You don't know my pain, you don't my shame 
 You don't know my life cause you know my name 
 Heard my songs and heard me sang 
 You don't know dawg, I don't play them games 
 You don't know how bad it hurt when nobody ever tries to say his name 
 No excuse but I refuse to pretend for you, and do it all in vain 
 Who I'm fronting for 
 Who I'm stunting for 
 Go ahead and cry dawg when it's hurting bruh 
 Down to the core 
 When my heart is sore 
 While I try to let my fire burn for ever more 
 Man, 'cause I feel it, yeah life got a bite and it's mission intended is to try to take me out 
 I feel it, I get it, like rhythm I'm moving, forget it, ain't losing 
 I'm running and gunning because He would choose me 
 For this pain, yeah, every strand of my body been feeling the strain, yeah! 
 Even People telling me to leave Him, believers or even speaking opposite of what I believe in 
 It's getting harder for me to maintain, yeah 
 Why me! 
 Why me! 
 Who know 
 God sees 
 He knows the hurt I felt for sure 
 He can relate, that's the reason he's great 
 Every move he makes, never made a mistake 
 So no matter my fate 
 I'm in till the end 
 From begin my intent was to say please send Me 
 And I'll be on my way 
 My haters gone hate 
 But you can tell 'em all to fire away!
