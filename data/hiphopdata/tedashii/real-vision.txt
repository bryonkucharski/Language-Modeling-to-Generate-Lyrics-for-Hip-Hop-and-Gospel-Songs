Look I don't know what they told you but if it don't match up 
 With His holy Word then homie they need to back up 
 Some they pretend like they get Him they twisting facts up 
 That's why we dig in the scriptures to know the Master 
 Homie, we have to if we want to get past the 
 Only thing we know being what we learned from the Pastor 
 I really hope your listening, my listeners 'cause after 
 We want to see Him clear like a big screen plasma 
 Half of the cats I seen they don't really know the Lord 
 They think my views are extreme, think I'm going overboard 
 But they ain't read a page of the place where 
 He's spoken for Himself in the matters, man that's what I be quoting for 
 Some say He don't exist, nah that don't even make sense 
 This Earth is masterpiece somebody had to paint this 
 Forget the big bang, or evolution and face this 
 He's the King of Kings and author of all creation 
 Some say He made it then let's it run like a clock 
 Nah, He controls every soul and every action on the block 
 If it happened then He watched and it happens on His watch 
 No surprise in His eyes, no my God's never shocked 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight 
 Wonderful, Counselor, Masterful 
 This is Jesus Christ, L-O-R-D, all capitals 
 This is why Trip and I trip after the mass appeal 
 Of people, who pigeonhole Jesus as a pacifist, whoa! 
 A prophet with no power in His plasma 
 Still we preach against the views that Arius profess to have of Him (Look it up!) 
 Meaning the deifying of Jesus was nothing more than an accident 
 But the Bible's the proof that refutes and gives us facts on Him 
 That He was, what His Daddy was Homousia, the God-Man 
 Sent to save us all that He loves 
 And set us free from sin and shut it down like it was Attica 
 Anyone disbelieving this truth may want to back it up or back it up 
 Because the Son of Man is coming that's what's up and at 
 His judgment seat is where you will see His holy wrath is just 
 But God is Love, that don't mean He's weak, hey check His resume 
 Just 'cause He let's you breath don't mean He won't take His breath away 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight 
 These days in the church, most cats got it twisted 
 Don't let them fool you on how we posed to live this 
 For instance, some say to come to Christ for riches 
 Or maybe your blessing, but my question is what is this? 
 'Cause that ain't the gospel, that if you put your faith in Him 
 To come to the Savior, and then you'll rake that paper in? 
 Face it friends, they made Jesus they holy ATM 
 Paul would appalled, this gospel would be disgrace to Him 
 This false gospel strips Him of His flyness 
 He's more like your servant and less like His Highness 
 So please don't buy it, that idea is absurd 
 Jesus said the Christian life can be strife and it's filled with hurt 
 Look homie I would hate for, cats to get that fake stuff 
 And never know it's wrong 'cause they won't open a page up 
 I pray we erase the wrong views and embrace the 
 Holy Word that testifies to us about the Savior 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight 
 I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard 
 I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word 
 I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think 
 I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight
