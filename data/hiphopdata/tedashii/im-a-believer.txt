Let's tell 'em! 
 I'm a believer hey 
 We gotta let them know 
 Hey to all GODS people 
 I'm a believer! 
 This right here don't make no sense 
 You ain't gotta guess baby that I'm His 
 Crucified, died, now alive in Him 
 I done put my faith in Him hommie till the end 
 Now the new life, I live in Christ 
 It's because of Him, ya boy shines so bright 
 You can keep the ring and the chains and the ice 
 Cams main campaign ain't to pop champagne, that's lame, no game 
 Hommie I rep Christ 
 You can peep my lyrics and the way that I write 
 I surrendered everything, even my rights 
 I count it all lost just so I can know Christ 
 Or better yet baby just so that He can know me as a son coming home from prodigal to free 
 Free from my sin that's the end of my grief 
 I'm a believer so best believe this is me 
 Even at the cross Jesus took my place 
 He didn't deserve it, I guess that's what we call faith 
 I did deserve it, I guess that's what you call grace 
 He did it for certain and guaranteed my place in Him and then seated me on high 
 In the end baby I'll be caught up in the sky on a dime, in the twinkling of an eye, I'll be found in the air with my savior Jesus Christ 
 I'm a believer 
 I'm a believer no doubt 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer hear me out 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer yeah yeah 
 He came into my life and I never thought twice 
 He's all that I have and I'm willing to fight 
 I stare at them like... I'm a believer 
 Some might know me as a rapper some might know me as a southern dude 
 Others as a black man, but first I got another crew 
 Ever since I heard the Gospel message how the Son was bruised, I got a new identity, it's like your boy's another dude 
 We ain't undercover brother, come and see us trust the Truths that we stand under brother, other things adjust and move 
 Some say we dumb for trusting Christ, they say we just some fools, but you can check His grave if you want it proved, ooh 
 We ain't perfect at all nah 
 We recognize this life's hard 
 The difference is instead of drowning, we trust the Life Guard 
 We fight hard, but with the right perspective as we walk this 
 Christ, He works in us like an office, so I'm a believer 
 I'm a believer 
 I'm a believer no doubt 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer hear me out 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer yeah yeah 
 So in the end, hey this is me 
 I ain't that cat that you seen on TV 
 I ain't that rapper, model, actor, baller, none of them defines me 
 I'm a believer, known to the One that exist in three 
 Co-heir to the kingdom, this means I'm the King's son, partner, that's what defines me 
 Identity - crucified, choose to die, now the life that I live, not I 
 But it's this flesh, He laid to rest, through faith, I live by Christ 
 I'm quite sure your mama told you not to trust just anybody 
 But tell me who is like the Lord? Not anybody 
 I took a look at Him in the Scriptures, this really got me 
 He keeps His promises, even though cats be living sloppy 
 Look at His love, and His grace, and His just mercy 
 I was dirty, till I trusted Him who's trustworthy 
 I'm a believer 
 I'm a believer no doubt 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer hear me out 
 I'm a believer yeah 
 I'm a believer yeah yeah
