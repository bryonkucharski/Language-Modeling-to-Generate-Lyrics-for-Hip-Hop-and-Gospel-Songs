Come and listen to a story that gots to be told 
 A boy left by his father in a world so cold 
 Till the good news told him that he had been chose 
 And this is how the story goes, story goes 
 Natural born evil to reborn group of people 
 How does he do it 
 Call him-call him the redeemer 
 There's no equal 
 He's higher than every creature 
 In heaven or hell, and the earth can't hold him either 
 He's so regal 
 Out soars every eagle 
 I'm so impressed with him I'll be looking for his sequel 
 His names Jesus 
 In case you missed it here's the prequel 
 This god-man was the lamb used so god could free us 
 So here's my thesis 
 Through faith we're like a fetus 
 Reborn and adopted through Christ, that's how he sees us 
 With good reason he embraced us and received us 
 He guaranteed it even before time had a season 
 I can't believe it 
 It feels like I'm dreaming 
 Entitled to every right 
 Co-heir to the kingdom 
 It's truly legal 
 God rigged it so we would need him 
 He's the father I always wanted, I know he'll never leave me 
 Wheew 
 Now here we go 
 Truth up in a trilla flow 
 The word became flesh and then flesh was fleshed our among us bro (Jesus) 
 All knowing savior 
 The savior straight from the making 
 That can see inside our hearts to get past the faking 
 Ain't no lying, ain't no cheating, ain't no hiding, he can see you 
 He knows everything about us, ain't no secrets 
 He knows what's inside of man 
 All the lies inclined to man 
 All wise, all seeing 
 Still he chose to abide in man 
 I'm blown away when I think on how my soul was saved 
 Like a movie I can see it 
 Like it was yesterday 
 Caught up in a major way 
 Sort of like I had a date 
 God booked the appointment and rigged it in a player way 
 Grace through faith did more than just account for me 
 It placed me in his family and gave me my identity 
 Who am i 
 I'm a child of the king 
 Co-heir with the savior 
 Adopted and redeemed 
 He gave me a brand new life 
 Forgiven me of all I've done 
 He's not only a king he's my father (my father yeah)
