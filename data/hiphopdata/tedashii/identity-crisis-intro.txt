Oh my goooodneees 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey baby, let's get it 
 It's been a minute 
 But no worries folk I'm still in it 
 I'm still with it 
 I ain't going no where 
 I'm a still be standing right here 
 Even if they say they don't care 
 Now What's Up (what's uuuuup) 
 Hey mane I'll tell you what's up 
 Man sinned and sinned and in the end now our image's messed up 
 And (and) Identity's damaged 
 Happened all over the planet 
 Not lost, but sure is blemished 
 Now how we see is scrambled 
 But God, 
 Being rich, in mercy, gave me living water when he saw that I was thirsty 
 And I came (and I came) to the cross (to the cross) for the Lord and it ended my searching 
 I was lost (I was lost) in a maze (in a maze) until His amazing grace (yeah) 
 And I got to the truth, and I found out what to do 
 I need to live by faith (yeah) 
 So I'm a work, like I'm pushing the cane 
 Never giving in or giving up I'm all in this thang 
 Giving everything I got, just to see who I am 
 On the cool lil' buddy, I ain't playing no games 
 People trippin' and they thinking that they life is straight 
 Seeking peace while they saying that their life is great 
 Steady looking for the answer with no words to say 
 One clue plus proof, it's the Imago Dei, 
 Uh-uuh, the Imago Dei 
 Imago Dei 
 Imago Dei
