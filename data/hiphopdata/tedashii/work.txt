I Work 
 And I Press 
 And I do everything I can just trying to give these folks my best 
 I Sweat 
 And I Grind 
 I used to try but learned that I can't please these people all the time 
 So I Work

 Hey, what's happening hommie 
 Hey, hey, whaitdew mane 
 Don't know 'bout you but I'm working 
 Trying to keep pressing mane 
 In life 
 With rhymes 
 I fight with people pleasing 
 That's trife, this time 
 I'm fighting to please Jesus 
 I'm done with it dog 
 All the lying and masquerading 
 The fronting and the faking 
 I hate it, life feels so vacant 
 I used to let 'em make it 
 Even if it got blatant 
 No matter how flagrant, I'd let it slide like stealing bases 
 But now I finally get it 
 So I ain't ever quitting 
 I can't be passive, inactive like players that's been injured 
 Far from it 
 Been hurt, been even knocked off my feet 
 But I'm in Christ, and I want life like its suppose to be 
 I Work 
 And I Press 
 And I do everything I can just trying to give these folks my best

 When I ain't know, who I was 
 Everyday I wasted life 
 Pagan days of people pleasing 'cause I wasn't chasing Christ 
 Worried 'bout the he say 
 She say 
 I'd repeat it like a replay 
 I was chasing their approval like a runner in a relay 
 (GO) 
 I was believing that if I got it 
 No-doubt it'd be 
 All good 
 But even if I got it 
 Somehow it would 
 Fall through 
 I tried to keep standing 
 Living by a weak standard 
 Believing even Jesus received me based on my weak merits 
 Lies from the pit 
 Lies I won't forget 
 Lies that ruin lives and keep you blind to who you is 
 Sinner saved by grace 
 Through faith for Jesus sake 
 So what you have count as loss as we press to see His face 
 I Work 
 And I Press 
 And I do everything I can just trying to give these folks my best 
 I Sweat

 Every Christians on the track 
 But are we focused like a scope 
 Or are we racing never pacing 
 Are we running to the goal 
 Upward (upward) calling (calling) 
 Full in (full in) knowledge (knowledge) 
 Nothing hollow 
 Like the lotto 
 True rewards 
 From God the Father 
 Well we should be 
 No matter what they say, or even throw at us 
 Keep rolling up, and pressing in 
 And showing folks you rest in Him 
 See when it's, all said and done, I wanna, be true to Christ 
 I wanna, see fruit that's proof to know it's true to life 
 So look to Him, give up everything to make it to Him 
 To know Him fully 
 Becoming holy as you pursue Him 
 To all my saints, who know they saved 
 But know there's more to gain 
 Keep pressing till the end when we will see Him face to face
