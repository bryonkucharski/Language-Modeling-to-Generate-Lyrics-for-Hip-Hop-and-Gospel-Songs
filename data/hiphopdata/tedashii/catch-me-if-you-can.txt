Verse 1 - Tedashii: 
 You ain't got it like that 
 Sorry I'm the one that gotta drop it like that 
 People play a part now you gotta act 
 I ain't going for it you can stop it where it's at 
 (x2) 
 Faith ends well 
 They pretend well 
 But that never ends well 
 Fail 
 Never ends well 
 Please, excuse my escape 
 Who can I run to when everybody fake 
 I ain't usually impatient but I just couldn't wait 
 Really wasn't sure how much more I could take 
 Frontin', like they really off something 
 When they really nothin', everybody stuntin 
 Like they in the movie but they not in the credit 
 Dyin' to be remembered 
 (Forget 'em) 
 Hook - Andy Mineo: 
 Is this a fantasy, lame 
 I don't think I know where I am 
 But then again (who really knows) 
 Is this a fantasy, lame 
 I don't think I know where I am 
 But then again 
 Why don't you catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can 
 Why don't you catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can 
 (Until then) 
 Verse 2 - Tedashii: 
 Mister, he the keeper 
 Chief chiefa with cheeba under your seata 
 Keeper, you keepa 
 Model diva like Rama Decomacita 
 Keep the deceive a diva that kiss just below your sneakers 
 (I don't believe you people!) 
 Low down dirty 
 So clown worthy 
 I take you as a joke I'm not trying to provoke just shock 
 As I watch people come to us not 
 And the crowd goes wild while a smile still in shock 
 We run to the place with familiar faces 
 Cope with my pain and conceal in anguish 
 I burryin my soul like in the garden naked 
 Or where are my flaws and it's hard to take it 
 My image in the mirror it's hard to face it 
 We all lost perfection we chose to replace it 
 Tryin' to remember but somebody erased it 
 Now all I know is I'm tryin' to escape it 
 Picture perfect art till it's hung kinda odd 
 Framed in my pain and it's hung kinda off 
 Tryna get it straight but I can't 'cause it's hard 
 Hidin in the bushes I don't want to get caught 
 Outro - Tedashii: 
 People claim I broke laws but who really knows 
 Tip a paint with a sharp shank who really knows 
 People claim I broke laws but who really knows (who really knows) 
 (Why don't you catch me if you can) 
 (x2)
