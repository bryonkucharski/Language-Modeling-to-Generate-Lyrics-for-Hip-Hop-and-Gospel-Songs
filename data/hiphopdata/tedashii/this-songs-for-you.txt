Let's here it 1 for the pastors and preachers, those who were burdened to teach us just so they could reach us 
 And 2 for Big Mama, Madeea, Granny Mae, all those who would pray us through the faith 
 And 3 for the cloud of many witnesses who stood for the faith and paved the way so we could witness this 
 Kingdom people this song's for you, kingdom people this song's for you, so let's go 
 Nine years old getting dropped off at Sunday School, class clowning with my boys I just wanna be cool 
 See I grew up thinking that church was for the preacher until I met brothers who wanted to reach us and teach us 
 How to study our Bibles to see what it means and show Christianity isn't just about what it brings 
 But sadly there are those who live opposite scripture, Christians to the public who muddy up the picture 
 Cause for too long cats like Kells and Maze been the spokesmen all the while the public see us as a joke man 
 So this song's for the true shepherds who prove selfless whose aim is to aid the true helpless 
 I mean brothers like Spurgeon and Piper, Tom Nelson, John Edwards, brothers who make disciples 
 Those who because of Ezekiel 34 shepherd the flocks as a true pastor of the Lord 
 Let's here it 1 for the pastors and preachers, those who were burdened to teach us just so they could reach us 
 And 2 for Big Mama, Madeea, Granny Mae, all those who would pray us through the faith 
 And 3 for the cloud of many witnesses who stood for the faith and paved the way so we could witness this 
 Kingdom people this song's for you, kingdom people this song's for you, so let's go 
 I was a hardhead growing up in Buzzard Root, Texas where the girls was fast acting and the men would plex us 
 Where nobody seemed to care so my cousins was reckless, but from moms and Madeea there was more that was expected 
 From their perspective life wasn't over they all had a sense of hope that was based on Jehovah and more over 
 They knew the life to come, they had a love for their people based on Christ the Son 
 And as I write this song I can remember many times I left home mama crying just wishing I'd try Him 
 Well I tried Him mama and I kept Him too I praise God that Madeea that was was praying me through 
 Thank you Miss Luke, Mama Grant, and Aunt Jessie Mae, Mama, all those who would pray us through the faith 
 This song's for you, knowing no one can compare to you, to me, Madeea's more than a Tyler Perry character 
 Let's here it 1 for the pastors and preachers, those who were burdened to teach us just so they could reach us 
 And 2 for Big Mama, Madeea, Granny Mae, all those who would pray us through the faith 
 And 3 for the cloud of many witnesses who stood for the faith and paved the way so we could witness this 
 Kingdom people this song's for you, kingdom people this song's for you, so let's go 
 There are those that have gone on and gone home to worship at the throne, but their lives live on 
 It's their precedence of faith that gives the evidence of faith exhorting residence of grace to lay aside every weight that hinders our race 
 True examples from the Father that even if we're martyred our faith should never falter 
 I pray we trust in the Father like Jacob and Joseph, true faith hall of famers like David and Moses 
 And I praise God for my present day models, from the Columbine daughters to my spiritual fathers 
 Thank you God for Dhati, Keynon, LeCrae, and Sho, Godly men that's an example of which way to go 
 And to the sistas I see y'all holding it down, standing firm for the faith like light poles in the ground 
 This song's dedicated to all y'all who's true, kingdom people let's go, this song's for you 
 Let's here it 1 for the pastors and preachers, those who were burdened to teach us just so they could reach us 
 And 2 for Big Mama, Madeea, Granny Mae, all those who would pray us through the faith 
 And 3 for the cloud of many witnesses who stood for the faith and paved the way so we could witness this 
 Kingdom people this song's for you, kingdom people this song's for you, so let's go
