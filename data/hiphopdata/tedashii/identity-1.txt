And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" 
 His story, meant to be the story 
 History recorded at the start of every story 
 Christ lost the culture, all for His glory 
 To display his power, now fast forward 
 Let us make men in our likeness and in our image 
 For his glory, but through sin things got distorted 
 I get the point when I watch Mory Poravich 
 I am not the father, man, I have no control of this 
 Flash black, front side of the tempting 
 Picture the same cool breeze, sun dipped in 
 The service led is over, spittin' venom showed 'em 
 Eve flip flopped like some Japanese zorith 
 Adam followed suit too, like he had four of these 
 Hands weeped we fold Satan backdoors these 
 Identity fades, it exceeds poorly 
 Not lost, but stained at the cross for His glory 
 "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate." 
 With fear and shame, mankind was overtaken 
 Eyes open wide and they saw they both were naked 
 Traumatized they flee the scene like a driver that's been drinkin' 
 So in leaves as they leave, try and hide amongst the trees 
 'Cause they hear God comin' and like sinners they start runnin' 
 Already they confused and how they see God is blury 
 Feel compel in the runners if they gonna get done in 
 With ease God speaks as he strolls through the breeze 
 Seeking man out Asking him "Where are You?" 
 'Cause mankind is lost and his vision got marred too 
 The results of it all, the fall of mankind 
 God cursed the serpent plus the man in his pride 
 Picture of the here and now, why people can't hear and now 
 Rejected by their sin and overwhelmed with the here and now 
 Created to be in His image, better showin' his glory 
 Reflectin' to the world till the end of His story
