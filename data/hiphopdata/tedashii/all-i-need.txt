(Intro - Tedashii) 
 I see you're all I need 
 Father God, I see you're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 God, God you're all I need 
 To tell the truth Lord you're all I need 
 (Verse 1 - Tedashii) 
 They said I was going crazy on the campus when you saved me 
 'Cause I stopped partying and chasin' all the ladies 
 And they told me I was losin' it, calling me a lunatic 
 Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it 
 Man I heard the rumors, calling me a joke 
 I'm praying saying, I wish they knew what I know 
 'Cause if they did they would see 
 How you were meant to be much more than the God of emergencies 
 You're the God that elected me, chose and selected me 
 When nobody else would mess with me 
 Never neglected me, you even loved me when you corrected me 
 Hands down you're the best to me 
 I spent years of my life 
 Trying to be liked or be like the people who seemed light 
 Following the crowd, trying to be allowed 
 Into a world where everything seemed right, but ... 
 (Chorus - Chris Davis and Tedashii) 
 I wrote this song to tell you Lord, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need, God) 
 And I know you'll never fail me Lord, you're all I need 
 And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy 
 Father, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need) 
 When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in 
 Around me, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need, all I need) 
 (Verse 2 - Tedashii) 
 From saving me to raising me, shaping me and changing me 
 Embracing me, taking me, making me yours 
 Amazingly and graciously when I was lost and wavering 
 Couldn't get from A to B, you opened the door 
 I deserved to be left there in distress with the rest there 
 Right there in my mess yeah 
 Still believing all the lies, the world can satisfy 
 I almost died, pushing you to the side 
 What a fool, making crazy moves 
 About to lose all I had for a buzz and a thrill 
 We too easily satisfied and that's just how Adam died 
 He was in the place where the love wasn't real 
 But the more I get to know you 
 The more I get to know truth, and through you I see who I am 
 My identity revealed as you show me how to live 
 Through examples of the God-man, that's why ... 
 (Chorus - Chris Davis and Tedashii) 
 I wrote this song to tell you Lord, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need, God) 
 And I know you'll never fail me Lord, you're all I need 
 And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy 
 Father, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need) 
 When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in 
 Around me, you're all I need 
 (You're all I need, all I need) 
 (Outro - Tedashii) 
 You're all I need 
 Father God, I said you're all I need 
 All I need 
 God, God you're all I need 
 To tell the truth Lord you're all I need 
 And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy 
 Father, you're all I need 
 When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in 
 Around me, you're all I need 
 All I need
