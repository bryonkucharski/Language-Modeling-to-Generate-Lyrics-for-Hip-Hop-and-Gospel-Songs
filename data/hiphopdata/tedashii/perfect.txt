(Hook 1: Kam Parker) 
 You don't know what I been through 
 Don't judge me 'cause you got a past too 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 (Verse 1: Tedashii) 
 Yeah, they ruin the view, you watching this 
 Say, I'm doing a fool and it's obvious 
 Say, I'm losing it too like poverty 
 They ruin my mood with this gossipin' 
 Hating this, in the heat of the moment where Satan is 
 Accusing me of nothing that's a vacant switch 
 Making this, hard for a person in this place to live 
 My God, I'm working like I ain't got nothin' 
 Can a load you ain't drop something 
 And you can't high so stop frontin' 
 My God, that's a lie that we tell ourselves 
 Then I guess that its hard for you to ask for help 
 But in that moment that's when you fail 
 One slip and they judging 
 When they standing like they ain't done nothin' 
 I make no excuse but I refuse to lose 
 Some dudes without a clue what I've been through 
 From where I'm coming, no lie I should've been done 
 I'm working at it I ain't perfect at it and I say this every time 
 (Hook 2: Kam Parker) 
 You don't know what I been through 
 Don't judge me 'cause you got a past too 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 (Verse 2: Tedashii) 
 I'm suppose to be dead and gone in a catacomb like Rome 
 Out of range trying to use my phone, Hello. 
 No tone, left alone like I lost my arm? 
 But I'm up by the air like the top of your home, 
 With a birds eye view, 
 Watching these people saying words not true. 
 Accusing me, they abusing me, yeah truthfully 
 I don't have the time to be worried about you man. 
 Nah, hold on. People playing games with no ball. 
 No rules in this so they losing it 
 And they don't know the score at all. 
 Consider my life they don't, 
 Believe me I'm only human, they won't. 
 But no matter their lies 
 I won't compromise, 
 Everyday for your boy it's on. 
 Man I promise, I'm honest. 
 I shoot 'em straight but they really don't want it. 
 Ya they taunt me then flaunt it, 
 I've been dealing with this for the longest. 
 Ya I doubt I'm the strongest, 
 But in Him when I am weak I'm stronger. 
 I'm working at it, I ain't perfect at it, 
 And I say this every time. 
 (Hook 3: Kam Parker) 
 You don't know what I been through 
 Don't judge me 'cause you got a past too 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 (Bridge: Kam Parker) 
 My 'ssues, ain't your 'ssues 
 So don't try to judge me, 
 Just deal with your issues. 
 Take a look in the mirror, 
 What you judgin' for? 
 Take a look in the mirror, 
 Cause you never know, 
 How you affect the next person with your comments. 
 (Hook 4: Kam Parker) 
 You don't know what I been through 
 Don't judge me 'cause you got a past too 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm working 
 I ain't perfect 
 I know you don't know 
 But He knows, He knows, He knows
