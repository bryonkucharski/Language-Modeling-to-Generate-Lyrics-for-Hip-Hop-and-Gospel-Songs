How's life? 
 Great 
 Everybody's going through something 
 They gotta get over it 
 You can't go around 
 Let's just enjoy all the time 
 The night is young, you know 
 We've just begun 
 Let's have some fun until the moon turns to the sun 
 Look out the DJ's got this party jumping 
 It's easy to let loose when you sipping something 
 Relax, it's what you deserve 
 There's no need to be reserved, no 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Telling you can't control what you can't have 
 You're here, to enjoy yourself 
 But time, in the back of your mind 
 Spinning what left of it on the floor 
 Have another round and just enjoy this party 
 Put your favorite sign, go head and grab somebody 
 Ain't no limit, no such thing is too much 
 And if you cause a line in the V.I. 
 I'm waiting on you to show me 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 If you find yourself not knowing what to do 
 Just lift you hands up high improvise 
 And don't you worry about what they think of you 
 All you can do is just live your life 
 Wo-ah, now it's the time 
 Now it's the time 
 So come on show me what you're all about 
 Right here, right now 
 There is the perfect time and place 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me what you're made of 
 You'll be going, going all night you stay up 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for 
 Show me, what you came here for
