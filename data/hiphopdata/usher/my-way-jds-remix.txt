Yo see, it's rare that you find people like us 
 'Cause y'all the other look out there doin' what I'm doin' 
 Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't 
 'Cause I do what I do my way 
 What about you? Huh, huh? come on 
 I do 
 Any and everything you want to 
 Make your girl say, ooh, ooh 
 Why's he so fly 
 She beeps me 
 Whenever she wanna get freaky 
 You can get mad if you want too 
 Do whatever you want but she still gon' give it up 
 She likes it 
 My way, my way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 Don't check me, check me 
 It was your girl who let me, let me 
 Take it this far then, ooh wee, ooh we 
 She had to have every chance that she could get 
 But you think you a baller 
 And I ain't gon' call her 
 Clip that, you can get mad if you want to 
 Say whatever you want but she still gon' give it up 
 'Cause she likes it 
 My way, ooh my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 I'm standing here 
 Where you ought to be 
 Got you mad at me 'cause I got your lady 
 You ain't got to worry, I ain't trying to romance 
 All I wanna do is make her dance with me 
 My way, oh my way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 My way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 And what I say goes and I'm in control 
 My way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control
