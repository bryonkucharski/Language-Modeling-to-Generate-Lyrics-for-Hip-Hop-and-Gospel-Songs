You took my heart and ran away 
 Forever in my heart you'll stay 
 No matter what we've been through 
 I'm going to keep on loving you 
 It's not the way that I feel 
 'Cause I'm really in love with you (ah yeah) 
 You stole my heart then you ran away 
 What am I to say, I love you anyway (oh baby) 
 My love for you will never change 
 'Cause I still feel the same way 
 The love I have for you will never grow old (oh no) 
 My life had changed because of you 
 And I need you right here with me 
 There's no substitute for you 
 As far as I can see 
 You're the one for me 
 My life had changed because of you 
 And I need you right here with me 
 There's no substitute for you 
 As far as I can see 
 You're the one for me 
 Every night and day 
 Thinking of you by my side 
 Here with me is where you ought to be 
 My life had changed because of you 
 And I need you right here with me 
 There's no substitute for you 
 As far as I can see 
 You're the one for me
