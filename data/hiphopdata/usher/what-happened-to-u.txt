When you give it up, you get it on 
 What happened to you yeah 
 From the beginning to where I was getting 
 But I was with it, and I'll admit that 
 She was clear it was a kinda thing 
 It woulnd't be easy for me to let it go 
 For my time I got money, but money don't buy time 
 I got a head someone got left behind 
 The world is yours, your sign is that aligned 
 And in no time, I hear, money clouds fancy cars 
 Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys 
 Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard 
 Private jets to France, many women 
 I didn't have a ball 
 You can say I've made it 
 But I've fainted 'cause I miss you 
 Give me your bag 
 But the issue this we can get back 
 What happened to you, yeah, turn back 
 'Cause I miss you, give me your bag 
 What happened to you 
 What happened to you 
 Did what I wanted, freaked out the honies 
 I stayed only mine, mine was on the money 
 Pack whatever, whenever hot tub forever 
 Black young and clever 
 When you give it up, you get it on 
 Love would be the only reason to look back 
 And when you turn it on, you can't turn it on 
 But picture me complaining the notice 
 Money clouds fancy cars 
 Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys 
 Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard 
 Private jets to France, many women 
 I didn't have a ball 
 You can say I've made it 
 But I've fainted 'cause I miss you 
 Give me your bag 
 But the issue this we can get back 
 What happened to you, yeah, turn back 
 'Cause I miss you, give me your bag 
 What happened to you 
 What happened to you 
 What sense does it make to have everything and nothing 
 At the same time... 
 Where are you 
 I need you, yeah 
 I'm looking for you, girl, come and share all these 
 Money clouds fancy cars 
 Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys 
 Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard 
 Private jets to France, many women 
 I didn't have a ball 
 You can say I've made it 
 But I've fainted 'cause I miss you 
 Give me your bag 
 But the issue this we can get back 
 What happened to you, yeah, turn back 
 'Cause I miss you, give me your bag 
 What happened to you 
 What happened to you 
 I'm happy for you, wherever you are
