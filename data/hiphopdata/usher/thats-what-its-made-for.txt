Ooh, yeah baby yeah 
 Uhhuhhuhhuhhmmm 
 Yeah babe 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Oh, yeah 
 Listen up I got a story to tell 
 Check it out now 
 And I know you can identify with this one 
 Yeah yeah yeah, oh 
 Check it out 
 Figured I'd hit it and quit it just one night 
 Got so good to me doubled back twice, I 
 Musta been outta my mind 
 Knowin' I don't wanna 
 I'm about to nut up 
 Guess it's too late to turn back now 
 Can't appologize 'cause that ain't my style 
 Shorty rainin' wet 
 Up in my ear talkin' 'bout 
 I got what you came for 
 This here got your name on it 
 Go on and hit it 
 That's what it's made for 
 We got protection 
 That's what it's made for 
 Boo are you trippin' now 
 You know I got it 
 That's what it's made for 
 So I can do you like this, baby 
 So I can freak you like this, baby 
 No you ain't felt it like this, baby 
 Girl I forgot it 
 But we gon' still get down like this 
 Game rules, no cap no cut 
 But even Superman couldn't turn your love down, I 
 Slipped up, slipped in 
 Hey man what the hell you doin'? 
 Raw dog is a never 
 I know I know better 
 Heard her whisper 
 Don't worry I'm safe 
 Didn't matter 'cause it's already to late 
 I was lost in the sauce, dead wrong 
 And I ain't stoppin' now 
 Parleein' in the bush again 
 Didn't think about what I was puttin' in it 
 Go on and hit it 
 That's what it's made for 
 She said, You got somethin' on right? 
 That's what it's made for 
 Boo are you trippin' 
 You know I got it 
 That's what it's made for 
 So I can do you like this, baby 
 So I can freak you like this, baby 
 Know you gon' felt it like this, baby 
 Girl I forgot it 
 But we gon' still get down like this 
 Best stay where you are 
 That's what it's made for 
 Playa playa put it down 
 That's what it's made for 
 Oh baby turn around 
 You know I got it 
 That's what it's made for 
 So I can do you like this, baby 
 So I can freak you like this, baby 
 Know you gon' felt it like this, baby 
 Girl I forgot it 
 But we gon' still get down like this

 Usher: I gotta go 
 Girl: Mm mm, you ain't gotta go nowhere 
 Usher: Look baby I, something's comin' up, I gotta-- 
 Girl: Mm mm, just get it up one more time, let me touch it 
 Usher: Again? 
 Girl: Again and again and again 
 Usher: Baby look--

 Usher: You want me to sweat it out? 
 Girl: I want you to sweat it all out 
 Usher: I'mma get it baby 
 Girl: Get it, take it 
 Usher: Ok 
 Girl: Take it 
 Usher: I'mma get up inside 
 That's what it's made for (that's what it's made for) 
 That's what it's made for 
 Don't trip, I got protection 
 You know I got it 
 That's what it's made for 
 I'm gon' do you like this, baby 
 Oh you gon' freak you like this 
 Felt it like this 
 We gon' still get down like this 
 That's what it's made for 
 Oh, playa playa put it down 
 That's what it's made for 
 Too late to turn back now 
 You know I got it 
 That's what it's made for 
 Do you like this 
 Freak you like this 
 Felt it like this 
 Girl I forgot it 
 But we gon' still get down like this 
 And that's only the beginning (God) 
 I might as well just go to sleep here (damn)
