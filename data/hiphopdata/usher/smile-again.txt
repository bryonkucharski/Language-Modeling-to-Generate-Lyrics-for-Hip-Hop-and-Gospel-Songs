 What can I do to make you smile again

 I'd like to know what's on your mind 
 Because I see you crying all the time

 Who'd wanna hurt your heart like this and 
 Cause you so much pain

 Why not just let me make you smile again)

 But now that's over let me take his place

 You need someone that you can depend on 
 To brighten up every day (every day) oh yeah

 And all you have to do is 
 Smile again for me yeah

 Let me be the one to make you smile 
 Smile again
