I'm crazy, so crazy 
 I'm crazy about you 
 I'm crazy so crazy, about you 
 (Crazy 'bout you baby) 
 What kind of love is this 
 That keeps me hypnotized - can't get you off 
 My mind 
 Don't ever let it end - let it go on and on and on 
 Cause you know it turns me on 
 Whisper in my ear, just what I want to hear 
 Cause no one can love me like you do 
 Oh that's why I am 
 Crazy... 
 I'd like to take this time 
 To tell you how I feel - to let you know the deal 
 So baby, let's make plans 
 I want you to be my only girl 
 Cause you know I'll be your man 
 I'm crazy - about you
