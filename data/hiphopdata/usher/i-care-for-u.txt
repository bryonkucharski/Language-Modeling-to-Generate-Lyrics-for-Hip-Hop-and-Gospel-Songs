I'm saying, I care but is like, you don't hear me 
 What more could I do? 
 Girl you can keep that, trying to make me jealous 
 I admit that I been careless 
 But we can't take back what's done 
 I know why you did that 
 You're frustrated 'cause I don't react 
 Maybe you want some feedback 
 Cause normally my feelings don't show 
 But baby I care for you 
 By now you should now that I care for you 
 You say my actions never show it 
 And I wear my heart on my sleeve 
 But what you get is what you see 
 The truth is girl underneath 
 Gotta believe that I care for you 
 Baby I care for you 
 I, i, I care 
 I, i, I care for you 
 Everyday I tryna prove myself to you 
 But what's the point 
 No such thing is satisfying you 
 Maybe you'll appreciate it later 
 By the time I'm gone 
 Better get your act together 
 Don't wait too long 
 Don't wanna change what we have 
 So what do we have? 
 Girl I need you to know 
 That I care for you 
 By now you should now that I care for you 
 You say my actions never show it 
 And I wear my heart on my sleeve 
 But what you get is what you see 
 The truth is girl underneath 
 Gotta believe that I care for you 
 Baby I care for you 
 I, i, I care 
 I, i, I care for you, I do 
 Gotta believe it 
 Gotta believe it 
 I care 
 Gotta believe it 
 Gotta believe it 
 I care, I care 
 You know I care 
 I care for you 
 By now you should now that I care for you 
 You say my actions never show it 
 And I wear my heart on my sleeve 
 But what you get is what you see 
 The truth is girl underneath 
 Gotta believe that I care for you 
 Baby I care for you 
 I care, I care, I care for you
