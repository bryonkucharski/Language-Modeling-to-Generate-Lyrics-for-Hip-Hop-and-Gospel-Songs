 Nicki Minaj: 
 Excuse me little mama 
 But you could say I'm on duty 
 I'm lookin' for a cutie 
 A real big o' ghetto booty 
 I really like your kitty kat 
 And if you let me touch her 
 I know you're not a bluffer 
 I'll take you to go see Usher

 Like Santa I keep a vixen 
 Got that dasher, dancer, prancer 
 Dixen, comet, cupid, Donner, BLITZEN! 
 I'm hotter than 100 degrees 
 A lotta bread, no sesame seeds 
 If I'm in yo city 
 I'm signin them tig ol bitties 
 I'm plottin on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy 
 The girls want a Minaj

 Everybody loves raymond! 
 If you fuckin' with me 
 Really fuckin' with me 
 You go get some girls and 
 Bring 'em to me 
 If you fuckin' with me 
 Really fuckin' with me 
 You'll let her put her hands in your pants 
 Be my little freak 
 Be my little freak 
 Be my little freak 
 Let her put her hands in your pants 
 Be my little freak 
 If you fuckin' with me 
 Really fuckin' with me 
 Let her put her hands in your pants
