Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen. 
 See the thing about you, that caught my eye, 
 Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind. 
 Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try. 
 You need to sit down, this may take a while. 
 You see, she sorta looks, just like you. 
 She even smiles, just the way you do. 
 So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled 
 I'm reminded when I look at you, but, 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 Thought that she was the one for me, 
 Till I found out she was on her dream, 
 Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me. 
 This is why we could never be. 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 I know it's so unfair to you, 
 But I'd be lingering the rest to you, 
 Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two 
 You remind me, whoa 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you.
