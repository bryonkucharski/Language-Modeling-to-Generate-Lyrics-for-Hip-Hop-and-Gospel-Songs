Would you mind if I still loved you? 
 (Would you mind if things don't last?) 
 Would you mind if I hold onto 
 You so that I won't crash...? 
 Morning light, I'm at your door 
 One last time, and no one's there 
 (Nobody, nobody, nobody, no...) 
 Drove all night, just to beat you home 
 Would you mind if I waited? 
 Would you mind if I wait right here? 
 And I really, really, wanna love you 
 And I'm really only yours 
 Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know 
 We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go 
 I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment 
 Would you mind if I still loved you? 
 Would you mind if things don't last? 
 Would you mind if I hold onto 
 You so that I won't crash? 
 Up all night, can't let go 
 Won't stop trying, need you to know 
 It's worth the fight, if I get back come 
 Hope you don't mind I waited 
 Would you mind if I wait right here? 
 And I really, really, wanna love you 
 And I'm really only yours 
 Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know 
 We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go 
 I'm just being honest (I'm still in the moment) 
 Would you mind if I still loved you? 
 Would you mind if things don't last? 
 Would you mind if I hold onto 
 You so that I won't crash? 
 I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you 
 You're the only one who takes me there 
 I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you 
 You're the only one who takes me there 
 I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you 
 You're the only one who takes me there 
 I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you 
 You're the only one who takes me there 
 Would you mind if I still loved you? 
 Would you mind if things don't last? 
 Would you mind if I hold onto 
 You so that I won't crash...?
