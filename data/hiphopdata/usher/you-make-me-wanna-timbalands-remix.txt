 Verse 1: Usher 
 Before anything began between us 
 You were like my best friend! 
 The one I used to run and talk to, 
 When me and my girl was having problems! (That's right!) 
 You used to say it'll be okay, 
 Suggest little nice things I should do! 
 And when I go home at night 
 And lay my head down 
 All I seem to think about was you 
 And how...

 Verse 2: Usher 
 Now what's bad 
 Is you're the one that hooked us up! 
 Knowing it should've been you! 
 What's sad is that I love her, 
 But I'm falling for you! 
 What should I do? 
 Should I... 
 ... Tell my baby bye-bye? 
 Should I... 
 ... Do exactly what I feel inside? 
 'Cause I... 
 ... I don't wanna go, 
 Don't need to stay, 
 But I really need to get it together!
