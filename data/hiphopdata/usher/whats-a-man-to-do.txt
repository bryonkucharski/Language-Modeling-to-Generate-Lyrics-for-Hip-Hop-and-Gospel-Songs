Oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Oh yeaa 
 Listen 
 I'd be a liar if I told you 
 That I didn't see it coming 
 Be more of a liar if I said 
 Hey I didn't want it to be something 
 You deserve much better 
 For the love that you have shared 
 I know you won't believe it 
 But girl I swear 
 That I got love for you 
 Big love for you 
 Even when I'm tripping 
 The fact remains that 
 You will always be my baby 
 My baby 
 But take the truth 
 Baby take the truth 
 I can't hide my feelings 
 Especially when the whole world can see 
 That my heart is in two different places 
 I got you in my life and I wanna do right 
 But it's hard to let it go 
 When my love has two different faces 
 And I can't pretise 'cause they both look right 
 Someone tell me what's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 And he don't wanna lie 
 But he can't tell the truth 
 What's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 But he can't keep his heart 
 In two different places 
 In two different places 
 I know you feel it cause you stay 
 There is much more to this story 
 But I'd be a fool to say 
 I trust her and I'm always gonna love her 
 You know that you don't wanna hear 
 I been living on the edge baby 
 So I guess yeah baby 
 She ain't nothing but she is real 
 But why take her through it 
 When I still got love for you 
 Big love for you 
 Even when I'm tripping 
 The fact remains that 
 You will always be my baby 
 My baby 
 But take the truth 
 Baby take the truth 
 I can't hide my feelings 
 Especially when the whole world can see 
 That my heart is in two different places 
 I got you in my life and I wanna do right 
 But it's hard to let it go 
 When my love has two different faces 
 And I can't pretise 'cause they both look right 
 Someone tell me what's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 And he don't wanna lie 
 But he can't tell the truth 
 What's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 But he can't keep his heart 
 In two different places 
 Not in two different places 
 I wanna tell you it's over 
 That I ain't thinking of her 
 I wanna really mean it 
 That I want you to see it 
 That I'm really trying to leave her behind 
 And I'm trying not to make you cry 
 I wanna tell you that 
 I ain't playing games and I'm dedicated to receive a change 
 But when I look in the mirror 
 It's the same old me 
 That my heart is in two different places 
 I got you in my life and I wanna do right 
 But it's hard to let it go 
 When my love has two different faces 
 And I can't pretise 'cause they both look right 
 Someone tell me what's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 And he don't wanna lie 
 But he can't tell the truth 
 What's a man to do 
 When he's loving two 
 But he can't keep his heart 
 In two different places 
 Not in two different places
