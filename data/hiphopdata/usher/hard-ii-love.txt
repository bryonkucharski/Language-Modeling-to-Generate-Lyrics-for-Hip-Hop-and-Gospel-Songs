Gotta crush on a new toy 
 And boy it's never safe 
 Making all the bad choices 
 But it's a brighter day 
 I know that I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love 
 Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love 
 Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust 
 Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose 
 I'll send you back and forth, you'll never know you try your luck 
 They call me Las Vegas, you get what you pay for 
 Girl I match your lucky card, I'll make you take a loss 
 But I'm worth it, loves what we wage for 
 I know that I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love 
 Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love 
 Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust 
 Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 Might kill you, but you could win it all 
 I'mma make it free fall baby, fall into infinity 
 I'mma make it go real crazy, never like it seems 
 I'm your adrenaline, I'm your problem 
 I'm your amphetamine, you kiss all of me 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose 
 It's like you gambling falling for me 
 Might kill you, but you could win it all
