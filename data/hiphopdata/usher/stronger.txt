Been through hell, now I'm helpful 
 Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it 
 Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon 
 Lost myself and lost my faith too 
 I've had my share of ups and downs 
 I've had my share of down and outs 
 Baptized in a river and almost drowned 
 That's when I figured out 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 Stronger than ever now 
 Oh 
 Walk through fire now I'm fireproof 
 Forever wear these scars like tattoos 
 Finally found paradise right in my view 
 And its killing me that I can't share it with you 
 I've had my share of ups and downs 
 I've had my share of down and outs 
 Baptized in a river and almost drowned 
 That's when I figured out 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now 
 (Stronger than ever now) 
 Though you're gone you still live in my mind 
 The only thing we ran out of is time 
 Since you left I ain't been quite the same 
 I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud 
 Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit 
 I keep you right by my side 
 I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect 
 Life will knock you down, get back up 
 Fight for what's worth it 
 Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done 
 Stronger than ever now 
 I been through it, now stronger 
 Stronger now, hey stronger now 
 All that I been through some how I found my way out 
 Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it 
 I know you'll make it, 'cause you're stronger 
 Stronger than ever now 
 Stronger
