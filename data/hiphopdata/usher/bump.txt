 I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going) 
 And I don't know what to call us (and I don't know what to call us) 
 And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how) 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to 
 I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going) 
 And I don't know what to call us (and I don't know what to call us) 
 And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how) 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Yeah 
 She hit me with that killer 
 She make me sling that skrilla 
 Body tight for the summer 
 Get it, get it for the winter 
 Real player niggas 
 Need something they can lay on 
 Now she's on my mind 
 I need something to spend my day on 
 And I love her like my niggas, my niggas, my niggas 
 She ain't bout my feelings, my feelings, my feelings 
 And I can't lay by these hoes 
 'Cause she the one I chose 
 Got the keys to the Benz 
 I don't even drive my shit no more 
 And let us just 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going) 
 And I don't know what to call us (and I don't know what to call us) 
 And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how) 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (I'm ready to) 
 I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going) 
 And I don't know what to call it 
 And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how) 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 I know you feel me getting ready 
 Cause you all that's on my mind 
 Tonight's champagne and confetti 
 If you want, I'll stand in line 
 For a little loving 
 For a little bumping 
 I hope that you hear what I'm sayin' 
 I'm hopin' and prayin', I'll say it again 
 I don't know where we going 
 And I don't know what to call us 
 And I don't know how it started 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to 
 I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going) 
 And I don't know what to call it (I don't know what to call it) 
 And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how) 
 But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (ready to) 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 (Don't stop get it, get it) 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Baby, yeah 
 Ooh
