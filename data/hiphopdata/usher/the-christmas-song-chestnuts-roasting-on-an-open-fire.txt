Chestnuts roasting on an open fire 
 Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah) 
 Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
 And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
 Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
 Help to make the season bright 
 Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 They know that Santa's on his way 
 He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mother's child is going to spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 And so, I'm offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from one to ninety-two 
 Although it's been said many times, many ways 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 (Yeah) and so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh whoa) 
 To kids from one to ninety-two (yeah, yeah) 
 Although it's been said, many times, many ways 
 Merry Christmas, merry Christmas (yeah), merry Christmas (oh no) 
 Merry Christmas to you!
