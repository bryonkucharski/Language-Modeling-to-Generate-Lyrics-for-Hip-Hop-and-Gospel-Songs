Do I remind you of the pain 
 That he put you through, girl 
 Is that the reason I'm to blame 
 Before I do it... 
 Is it because he, treated you badly 
 I always stand accused 
 Protecting yourself, from somebody else 
 I'm not who's hurting you girl 
 And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, I can't win no 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to 
 Pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you, girl 
 But I refuse to stay 
 Paying for his mistakes 
 He left a scar across your heart 
 I understand, girl 
 Don't let his wrongs tear us apart 
 Cause girl I'm your man 
 Just because he did 
 You swear I'm cheating 
 You think I just don't care 
 Why must I do time 
 For another man's crime 
 Girl you know that ain't fair 
 And it's killing me girl knowing, you compare me to him 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, no I can't win 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to 
 Pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you, girl 
 But I refuse to stay 
 Paying for his mistakes 
 I know he did you wrong 
 But tell me what does that have to do with me 
 Trying to show you something real 
 Figure out what is going on 
 Before you look up and I'll be gone... 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse 
 To pay for something I didn't do, girl 
 I love you, and I love you I love you 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse 
 To pay for something I didn't do, no 
 I love you, girl 
 But I refuse to stay 
 Paying for his mistakes
