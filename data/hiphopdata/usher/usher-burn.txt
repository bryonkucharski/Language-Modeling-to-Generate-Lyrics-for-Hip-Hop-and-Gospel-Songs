I don't understand, why? 
 See it's burning me to hold onto this 
 I know this is something I gotta do 
 But that don't mean I want to 
 What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just 
 I feel like this is coming to an end and its better for me to 
 Let it go now than hold on and hurt you 
 I gotta let it burn 
 It's gonna burn for me to say this 
 But it's comin' from my heart 
 It's been a long time coming 
 But we didn't been fell apart 
 Really wanna work this out 
 But I don't think you're gonna change 
 I do but you don't 
 Think it's best we go our separate ways 
 Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
 When I'm hurting, baby?, I ain't happy, baby 
 Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with 
 I think that you should let it burn 
 When the feeling ain't the same 
 And your body don't want to 
 But you know gotta let it go 
 'Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
 Even though this might bruise you 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn you gon' learn 
 Gotta let it burn 
 Deep down you know 
 It's best for yourself but you 
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
 But you know that it's over 
 We knew it was through 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn 
 Gotta let it burn 
 Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to 
 Got somebody here but I want you 
 Cause the feelin' ain't the same find myself 
 Callin' her your name 
 Ladies tell me do you understand? 
 And all my fellas do you feel my pain? 
 It's the way I feel 
 I know I made a mistake 
 Now it's too late 
 I know she ain't comin' back 
 What I gotta do now 
 To get my shorty back 
 Oh, man I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo 
 You've been gone for too long 
 It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours 
 I'mma be burnin' till you return 
 When the feeling ain't the same 
 And your body don't want to 
 But you know gotta let it go 
 'Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
 Even though this might bruise you 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn you gon' learn 
 Gotta let it burn 
 Deep down you know 
 It's best for yourself but you 
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
 But you know that it's over 
 We knew it was through 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn 
 Gotta let it burn 
 I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me 
 That I need to move on 
 On the other side I wanna break down and cry, oh 
 I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me 
 That I need to move on 
 On the other side I wanna break down and cry, yeah 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, can ya feel me burnin'? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 So many days, so many hours 
 I'm still burnin' till you return 
 When the feeling ain't the same 
 And your body don't want to 
 But you know gotta let it go 
 'Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
 Even though this might bruise you 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn you gon' learn 
 Gotta let it burn 
 Deep down you know 
 It's best for yourself but you 
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
 But you know that it's over 
 We knew it was through 
 Let it burn 
 Let it burn 
 Gotta let it burn
