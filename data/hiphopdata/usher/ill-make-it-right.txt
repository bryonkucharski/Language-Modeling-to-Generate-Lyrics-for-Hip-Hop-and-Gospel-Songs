Oh No, No, No, No, No, Oh Baby 
 I'll make it right 
 Baby you know that I can make it right 
 Keep it on the cutie girl I'm really into you yeah 
 Tell me is there a way that I can spend some time with you 
 So much I wanna know about you 
 Seems like I can't do without you 
 You really turn me on you got it goin' on 
 Anything you ask I'll do for you 
 So baby don't you see 
 You mean the world to me 
 Just one thing I have to know 
 Baby can I make it right 
 As I'm looking into your eyes all I see is your lovely face 
 And there's nothing I like more than to show you I adore 
 The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little things you say 
 Baby when I kiss your lips it really brightens my day 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Anything you ask I'll do for you 
 So baby don't you see you mean the world to me 
 Just one thing I have to know 
 Baby can I make it right 
 So baby don't you see you mean the world to me 
 If you just swing my way 
 I'll make it right 
 So tell me where we go from here 
 Oh yeah 
 There's nowhere that we can go 
 But take it nice and slow 
 Baby enjoy the flow 
 Lots of pleasures I can give 
 I've got it waitin here 
 So put away your fears
