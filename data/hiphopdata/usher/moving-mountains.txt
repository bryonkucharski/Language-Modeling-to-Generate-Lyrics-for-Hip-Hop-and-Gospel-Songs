It's like whatever I do 
 Ooh 
 Just can't get through to you 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh 
 Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her 
 Used to jump up in the maybach and roll out 
 Used to care, she used to share 
 The love that she used to give me can't be found 
 I lost my way, she said she'd stay 
 And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost 
 My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold 
 That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us 
 And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us 
 I told you to leave, but you lied to me 
 When you said that, "baby no worries I promise to get us back". 
 I know sorries, just wouldn't do it 
 Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through 
 But it's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... hey. 
 But I keep climbing and hoping things would change 
 And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away. 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 Why just leave me? 
 Just leave me be. 
 Just leave me. 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me 
 Just leave me be, ooh. 
 She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her 
 We rarely even ever say a word. 
 I really want to give her everything she deserves 
 But the bad took away the good. 
 She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired 
 Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying. 
 You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say 
 I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it 
 I should take it like a man and walk up out it 
 'Cause we will never be the same, ooh. 
 I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame. 
 I know sorries just wouldn't do it 
 Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through 
 Got to move this mountain. 
 It's like moving mountains... hey 
 But I keep climbing and hoping things would change 
 And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 Well baby why you just leave me? 
 Just leave me be. 
 Just leave me. 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me. 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me. 
 Just leave me be, ooh. 
 This must be a slow death that I'm travelin on 
 It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on 
 See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together (baby yeah) 
 And these hills that I'm travelin up 
 She ain't showin me love 
 I'm down on my love 
 I know sorries just wouldn't do it 
 Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo 
 But it's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... hey. 
 But I keep climbing and hoping things would change 
 And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... 
 Well baby why you just leave me? 
 Just leave me be. 
 Just leave me. 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me. 
 Just leave me be. 
 Why you just leave me. 
 Just leave me be, ooh.
