Hello everybody, huh 
 Welcome today to the wonderful world of... you, he-heh 
 Now check it, you have two options 
 You can eat it or throw it away, heh 
 See it's a shame when you're working on doing well 
 People hate you yeah 
 Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself 
 Then they really hate you yeah 
 You gotta live for you and no one else 
 Don't let 'em make you feel 
 Like you're not being real 
 Just live how you wanna live 
 You gotta do for you 
 (Dig that) 
 If you work hard then play hard 
 (Dig that) 
 And do what you wanna do 
 (Dig that) 
 Just pop ya collar 
 Don't let what people say bother you 
 (Dig that) 
 You perpetrators I got something to say 
 (Dig that) 
 You can eat it or throw it away 
 (Picture that) 
 You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap 
 But can you dig that? 
 Hey ladies and my fellas 
 You know you're doing 'cause they jealous 
 (Pop, pop) 
 And when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter 
 (Pop, pop) 
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you 
 (Pop) 
 Hey ladies and my fellas 
 You know you're doing 'cause they jealous 
 (Pop, pop) 
 And when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter 
 (Pop, pop) 
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you 
 (Pop) 
 You can see me every week 
 Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me 
 'Cause I'm not up to settle down right now 
 I gotta be free 
 Some of y'all fellas might be jealous 
 But y'all know that don't phase me 
 I just pop my collar, tip my hat 
 Turn my back on the ones that hated me 
 (Dig that) 
 Never going home alone 
 (Dig that) 
 If she follows then you know it's on 
 (Dig that) 
 She gets the finger not the cellular phone 
 (Never that) 
 I let her know I won't be around for long 
 (Dig that) 
 To all you haters I got something to say 
 (What's that?) 
 You can eat it or throw it away 
 (Picture that) 
 Stop hating, wishing, waiting 
 Anticipating for my year to fade, oh yeah 
 Hey ladies and my fellas 
 You know you're doing 'cause they jealous 
 (Pop, pop) 
 And when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter 
 (Pop, pop) 
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you 
 (Pop)

 And when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter 
 (Pop, pop) 
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you 
 (Pop) 
 I break my neck for the things I get 
 So much sweat just so I can get that check 
 And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down 
 Nobody's gonna steal my crown 
 Because I eat good, I live good 
 I rock good, my life's good 
 If you got a lot and you're working for it 
 Pop ya collar don't be afraid to show it 
 Hey ladies and my fellas 
 You know you're doing 'cause they jealous 
 (Pop, pop) 
 And when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter 
 (Pop, pop) 
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you
