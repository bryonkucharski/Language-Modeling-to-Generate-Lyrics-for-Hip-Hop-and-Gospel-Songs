Girl, the only thing that matters in my life 
 Is that I'm there for you and treat you right 
 YOu got no right to treat me cold as ice 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, girl 
 As long as I been givin' my love to you 
 You should be givin' me your love too, Oh 
 But you just keep on acting just like a fool 
 You know it ain't cool 
 Don't be cruel 
 'Cause I would never be that cruel to you. 
 Ah no, oh, oh-oh 
 Ah don't be cruel 
 Cause girl you need to change your attitude 
 Ah, no, oh, oh-oh 
 Don't be cruel. 
 Man we used to hang out tough 
 Just hanging around 
 Just a true love affair that could never be found 
 I gave you my heart and I gave you my mind 
 But a true love affair we could never find 
 I tell all the time that I want you Jackie 
 I want you more than human eyes could see 
 Now you know my name 
 Now you know the game 
 You wanna be with me you gotta be the same 
 Way that another girl would be 
 And if you wanna be with me. 
 Girl I work so hard for you from nine to five 
 So that can buy you all the finer things in life 
 You got no right to treat me cold as ice.
