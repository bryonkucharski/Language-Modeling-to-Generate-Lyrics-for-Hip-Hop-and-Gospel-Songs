If I could I'd tell you (I would tell you how) 
 I feel girl, when I'm close to you 
 At times I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how) 
 Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers... 
 If my heart could speak you'd know 
 Girl if my heart could speak you'd know 
 That I love you so (and I'll never let you go 
 Oh-no) 
 If you can feel what I felt (just now, kiss me) 
 To prove that your love for me is true 
 Two hearts that beat as one, send signals 
 To each other in whispers... 
 I would tell you how I felt, if I could find the words 
 To describe (the way I feel when you are near) 
 Whenever you are by my side 
 What I feel inside is deep and I just don't know 
 What to say (because my words get in the way) 
 Everytime I try to say (I love you) what I feel 
 Deep inside
