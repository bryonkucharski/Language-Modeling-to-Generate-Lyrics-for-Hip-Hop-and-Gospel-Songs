And I'm gonna... 
 Maybe it's the pressure of knowing that 
 I'm watching you perform 
 Or maybe you're not used to someone that knows exactly what you want 
 I know the fire's burnin', but baby's there's no need to be alarmed 
 And you can be the rain that's fallin', girl and I'll be the thunderstorm 
 Oh yeah 
 You got no need to be nervous 
 Because you are safe in my hands 
 I'm sure you'll be needin' my service 
 Baby your wish will be my command 
 Cause Ima touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body 
 If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry 
 This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down 
 I promise you ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 
 You ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 
 You ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, girl not until 
 You let me lay you down in here 
 When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm 
 I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby 
 Baby I'll go deeper, open up if you're ready for me to feed ya 
 And let me tell you who's you are? Let me taste it, you can take it 
 It's goin' down right here. 
 Cause Ima touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body 
 If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry 
 This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down 
 I promise you ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 
 You ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 
 You ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, girl not until 
 You let me lay you down in here 
 All that I want 
 Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby 
 And I'll provide you with that 
 Special kind of lovin' 
 You ain't goin' nowhere 
 (You ain't goin' nowhere) 
 I'll show you what love is 
 If you let me lay you down 
 I promise you ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, nowhere 
 You ain't goin' 
 No, you won't be sorry 
 You ain't goin' 
 Nowhere, girl not until 
 You let me lay you down in here
