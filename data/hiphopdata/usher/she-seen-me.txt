See I got a girl, that I love (Hey) 
 She's the only one I'm thinking of 
 And I wish she understood the way that I feel about her (She's mad) 
 She said she's had enough (Oh) 
 Now I'm up in the club like 
 Ooh, up in the V-I, sitting on a chair 
 Ooh, that's when I saw her sitting over there 
 She was chilling with her girlfriends (Yeah) 
 I was chilling with my homies (Yeah) 
 Then she made her over to my table (Whoa) 
 And she started dancing all on me 
 I should've said, "Hold up," (Hold up) 
 "Don't you know my girl?" 
 But the alcohol in me, make me wanna cut up 
 Damn, I'm out on the floor with her 
 Out the corner of my eyes 
 See my girl best friend I'm like, 
 Damn, I know 
 She seen me [x3] 
 Oh, she seen me out with another girl (Girl [x3]) 
 Oh, heard I was out with another girl (Girl [x3]) 
 Whoa, now, I'm caught up with another girl 
 (She seen me) I know it look bad, but it ain't 
 (She seen me) And I wanna take it back but I can't 
 (She seen me) And now the only thing going through my brain 
 She saw me out with an other girl 
 Now I'm thinking, oh, what I'm gonna say to her when I get home (And I've been drinking) 
 Man, the way that her girlfriend was staring at me, I know she got it wrong 
 And I know she see me out on the floor (Yeah) 
 And it was only a dance nothing more (Yeah) 
 I'm thinking, maybe, I could be wrong 
 Wondering why she calling me on my phone 
 I should've said, "Hold up, I got a girl" 
 But I didn't care 
 I was just getting some air 
 Didn't know she would be up in the club, no 
 (I got caught up in this bullshit) 
 Now that the club is over, I know I should go home 
 She keep calling me, but I know I don't wanna do wrong 
 If I go, we gonna be up all night 
 I rather that, than fuss and fight 
 We should make it worth the while 
 'Cause I'm in trouble now 
 So, I might as well stay out with this other girl
