Kanye] 
 I wanna see what's under there there now put it in the air 
 Yeah load it on my macbook air 
 It's a new form of macking don't be old fashioned update your passion 
 Only reason I be eye chattin its when its time for some action 
 I wanna hit it way way out like john paxton 
 But for now I just gotta watch her practice 
 Send her a picture so she see it she said 
 I-i-i can't believe it 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh she all on me on me 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh I think she want me want me 
 I think she showed her homies 
 Why? cause all the homies on me 
 Ayo all the digital gunna have to do for now 
 But imma break it down when I get by your town 
 (Jamie) 
 I love it girl 
 The way you bring your light into this room 
 I love it girl 
 The way you lace that up when you in them shoes 
 I love it girl 
 The way your lip looks after you apply the gloss 
 I love you girl girl 
 You look right in the screen and take it off off 
 See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you 
 And I just upgraded to 10-80-i hi def just for you 
 My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 She's my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 She's my digital girl 
 (Jamie) 
 My homies never seen 
 But I always got you right here for me 
 Tucked in my louis computer bag 
 Wherever you are I could be 
 I type you messages for the next send off 
 You shoot me a video and then I load 
 Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent 
 One day ill have your ass up in this kitchen 
 My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 She's my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 She's my digital girl 
 Not a day goes by shawty 
 Without you on my mind shawty 
 ?? 
 I wanna see what's under there 
 (Kanye) 
 When you see the picture cut off the face 
 Now cover up the tattoo by the waist 
 Let the MC search till I reach third base 
 And when I get home imma hit home plate 
 Wait would this be considered our first date 
 Yay this picture just looks so trash 
 Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash 
 Plus every good girl wanna go bad 
 And poles in the mag like Stacy dash 
 Or Kim Cardash and be a lady addict 
 You know what's a crazy thing 
 A girl would make you wait longer than ac green 
 Passion of the Christ 33 year old virgin 
 That's disrespectful baby don't encourage him 
 I like them brown yellow Puerto Rican or Persian 
 Dashiki kimona or turban 
 They say I dress white but my swag so urban 
 Tryin' my work 
 I hear the way the text say 
 Baby you up 
 Question mark 
 And she was my yes-s-s-i-r 
 (Outro - The-Dream and Jamie Foxx) 
 My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
 Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
