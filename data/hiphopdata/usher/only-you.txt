Only you can make this world seem right 
 Only you can make the darkness bright 
 Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do 
 And fill my heart with love for only you 
 Only you can make this change in me 
 For it's true, you are my destiny 
 When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do 
 You're my dream come true, my one and only you 
 Only you can make this change in me 
 For it's true, you are my destiny 
 When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do 
 You're my dream come true, my one and only you 
 (One and only you)
