Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 This is what you do 
 This is what you do 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 This is what you do 
 This is what you do 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me, you make me 
 Before anything began between us 
 You were like my best friend 
 The one I used to run and talk to 
 When me and my girl was having problems 
 You used to say it'll be okay 
 Suggest little nice things I should do 
 And when I go home at night and lay my head down 
 All I seem to think about was you 
 And how 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me, you make me 
 Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up 
 Knowing it should have been you 
 What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you 
 What should I do 
 Should I tell my baby bye-bye 
 Should I do exactly what I feel inside 
 'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay 
 But I really need to get it together 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me, you make me 
 At this point 
 (Say what?) 
 The situation's out of control 
 I never meant to hurt her 
 But I gotta let her go 
 And if she may not understand it 
 While all of this is going on 
 I tried, I tried to fight it 
 But the feeling's just too strong 
 You make me, make me 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You make me wanna 
 You makin' me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 You make me, you make me
