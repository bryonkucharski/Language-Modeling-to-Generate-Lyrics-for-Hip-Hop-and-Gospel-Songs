(Feat. Jay-Z) 
 What's up Baby, 
 Look, I know you don't want me to call you baby right now, 
 But I just gotta talk to you about sumat real quick, 
 Suprise you even took my call... 
 I just gotta few things I gotta, gotta discuss with you... would you mind if I ask you a question? 
 Listen, Is there any chance that you remember me being any more than just a horrible man... 
 And would you consider pullin this trigger and taking a second shot at romance 
 Oh Bbay 
 I want the days when you were my girl and I was your man, know I took you for granted, 
 But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you... 
 Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool... yeah 
 But for once, here goes the truth 
 I can't be fake I can't be phonie 
 Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely 
 I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing 
 The best things that ever happened to me 
 You took my best thing, 
 The best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the... the best thing that I ever had 
 And now all I feel is stress 'cause when you left you took the very best 
 Remember mimi or vita, remember isha or eva 
 I ain't got 'em no more, hey yes 
 Niomi or jenny - the same outcome is chillin'... 
 Girl, I let 'em all go... 
 No more trickin and kissin' miscelaenous chicks 
 Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church 
 And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya... 
 How much I miss you 
 I'm so sorry that I ran the stressts acting like a damn fool 
 But for once here goes the truth... 
 Can't be fake I can't be phonie 
 Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely 
 I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing 
 The best things that ever happened to me 
 You took my best thing, 
 The best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the... the best thing that I ever had 
 And now I'm all out with this stress cause baby when you left you took the very best... 
 I couln't see how good it was until I could'nt see you no more 
 Why did I have to act like that 
 Damn right girl I want you back 
 Acting like a G, straight M-A-C and P-I-M-P 
 Got my arms empty 
 In the night time 
 And that's the right time 
 When I got time 
 Listen to what's on my mind 
 I can't be fake I can't be phonie 
 Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely 
 I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing 
 The best things that ever happened to me 
 You took my best thing, 
 The best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the... the best thing that I ever had 
 And now all I feel is stress 'cause when you left you took the very best
