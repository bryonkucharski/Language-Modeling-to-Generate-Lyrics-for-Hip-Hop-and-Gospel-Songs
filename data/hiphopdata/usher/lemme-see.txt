(Usher) 
 Usher, baby 
 I hear you, yeah 
 Rock with me 
 Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home 
 Should I take you home? 
 I don't mean to keep you waiting 
 But I just gotta know 
 If you're ready 
 She says she wanna take her skirt off 
 Be my guest! 
 I decide to take my shirt off 
 And show my chest! 
 And we been sipping on that Merlo 
 So you know what's next 
 Working intermissions, switching positions 
 We so explicit oh! 
 You can say it all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see 
 Girl I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see 
 I've been anticipating 
 What you would do to me 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Sex babe, education 
 Hands on when you're with me 
 Give your heart to me, yeah 
 She says she wanna take her skirt off 
 Be my guest! 
 I decided to take my shirt off 
 And show my chest! 
 And we been sipping on that Merlo 
 So you know what's next 
 Working intermissions, switching positions 
 We so explicit oh! 
 You can say it all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see 
 Girl I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Got on all my ice, talking cash shit 
 Been ballin' all my life, Lamborghinis, fast whips 
 She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide 
 We run the streets but on G5's I'm talking fly 
 Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings 
 You wit' a big boy, so we do the big things 
 Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on 
 Looking like Treyvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted 
 She on my wanted poster, ciroc in my mimosa 
 I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shoppin' in Milan 
 The four fifty eight Ferrari I park it on the lawn 
 I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb 
 The sex is so explosive her stuff is supersonic 
 She my new addiction I swear I'm through with... (Chronic) 
 Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl we the hottest 
 Rockin' the most ice, I said we the hottest 
 (Usher) 
 You can say it all night long 
 That you couldn't wait to get me home alone 
 What you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see 
 Girl I can't wait to get you home 
 Talk a good game mate, come on 
 Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me 
 Don't talk about it, be about it 
 Lemme see, lemme see, lemme see
