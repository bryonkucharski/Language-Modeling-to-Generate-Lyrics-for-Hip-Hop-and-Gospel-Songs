Yo after tonight 
 Don't leave your girl around me 
 True playa fo' real 
 Ask my nigga Pharrell 
 Situations will arise 
 In our lives 
 But you gotta to be smart about it 
 Cele-brations with the guys 
 I sacrified 
 'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it 
 Meanwhile I, I 
 I loved U 
 U were my girl 
 U see I, I, 
 Thought the world of U 
 But you're still steady leavin' 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 Aw girl your face is 
 Sayin' why 
 Tears in eyes 
 Should've been more smart about it 
 Should've cherished me 
 Listenin' to friends, now it's the end 
 And again 
 No story can end without it 
 Damn right, 
 I loved U 
 You were my girl 
 U see I, I, 
 Thought the world of U 
 But you're still steady leavin' 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home 
 Waitin' for love 
 So tonight 
 I'm gonna do what a single man does 
 And that's part 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 Imma be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause imma be all right tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home 
 Waitin' for love 
 So tonight I'm gonna do what a single man does 
 And that's party 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause I'm a be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause I'm a be all right tonight 
 U don't have to call

 'Cause I'm a be all right tonight
