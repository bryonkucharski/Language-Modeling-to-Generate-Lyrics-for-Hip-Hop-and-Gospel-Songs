Make every minute worth it, baby 
 This for Usher, baby 
 Watch this 
 I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls 
 So I'm guessin' that it's true 
 Make me holla and I bet a million dollars 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you 
 It's five in the mornin' 
 Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs 
 At five in the mornin' 
 We can only be about to do one thing (what?) 
 See, I told her 
 The devil is a lie 
 Them other girls can't compete with mine 
 You do it so good, you fuck my mind 
 You pull it out, then you open wide 
 You make me wanna tap out and retire 
 Your pretty lips leave me so inspired 
 I think that she's a winner 
 She could be a keeper 
 'Cause she's such a good kisser 
 Got lipstick on my leg 
 Oh baby 
 She's such a good kisser 
 Imma rain on this parade 
 Oh baby 
 I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls 
 So I'm guessin' that it's true 
 Make me holla and I bet a million dollars 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you 
 This girl, she's my hero 
 Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs, and yen 
 (I ain't wanna check off either) 
 I'm starin' at your barrel 
 Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe 
 See, I told her 
 The devil is a lie 
 Them other girls can't compete with mine 
 You do it so good, you fuck my mind 
 You pull it out, then you open wide 
 You make me wanna tap out and retire 
 Your pretty lips leave me so inspired 
 I think I got a winner 
 Could be a keeper 
 'Cause she's such a good kisser 
 Got lipstick on my leg 
 Oh baby 
 She's such a good kisser 
 Imma rain on this parade 
 Oh baby 
 I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls 
 So I'm guessin' that it's true 
 Make me holla and I bet a million dollars 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby 
 Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you 
 Listen, the only thing I know 
 You give it to me, baby, with good flow 
 Don't ever run it back, come on, keep goin' 
 Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me 
 I can't keep my control 
 Every time that I see you hit that floor 
 Just keep on givin' it to me, I want mine 
 Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me 
 Kiss it good, kiss it right 
 Keep it up, we be kissin' all night 
 Kiss it good, kiss it right 
 Keep it up, we be kissin' all night 
 Kiss it good, kiss it right 
 Keep it up, we be kissin' all night 
 Kiss it good, kiss it right 
 Keep it up, we be kissin' all night 
 'Cause she's such a good kisser 
 Got lipstick on my leg 
 Oh baby 
 She's such a good kisser 
 Imma rain on this parade 
 Oh baby
