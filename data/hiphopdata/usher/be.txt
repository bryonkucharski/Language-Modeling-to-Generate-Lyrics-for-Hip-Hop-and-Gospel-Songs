On the road to the riches, 
 Try and stop and take pictures 
 Pay attention to each detour and each sign along the way 
 Be aware of the winding roads 
 Know that as long as you take it slow 
 You'll be fine 
 Plus you'll find 
 You're already there 
 On the road to the riches, don't forget to stop to take pictures 
 Cause life ain't about where you finish, but what you've learned along the way 
 So as you chase success remember that I told you best 
 You look fine, then you'll find 
 You're already there 
 (And that's the truth) 
 Go ahead, be you (go 'head, be you) 
 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 First you must be, 
 Just be, just be 
 With the glass half empty at least you know you're not thirsty 
 Try to see it for what it is 
 Really half full now take a sip 
 And as it trickles down let it wash away any doubts 
 In your mind 
 You'll find 
 Don't think real joy is in position or money (No) 
 Don't compare your life to somebody else that you don't know 
 Just what they're going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes 
 Don't be blind, the sun shines on everybody 
 (And that's the truth) 
 Go 'head be you 
 (Go 'head be you) 
 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 Then you have to first be (be) 
 Just be (be) 
 I know that sometimes life can throw a curve 
 But you gotta keep on swinging hard 
 It's the only way to knock one out the park 
 And if it doesn't make it over the wall 
 The only way you strike-out is if you don't swing at all 
 (Mmm? And that's the truth) 
 Go ahead be you 
 (Go 'head be you) 
 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 Be (Be) 
 Just be (be) 
 Repeat
