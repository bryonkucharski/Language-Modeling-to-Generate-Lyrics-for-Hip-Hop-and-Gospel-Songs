Yeah, uh 
 They say money can't buy you love 
 They say money can't buy you love 
 They never seem to listen 
 I'm all ears 
 Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex 
 But you can never find the time to spend at home 
 Thinkin' it's gon' keep her happy 
 When time is all she wanted all along 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 So you think that you know what's important 
 Steady chasin' your fame and your fortune 
 But you don't know 
 You're chasing a dime losin' a treasure 
 Those dollars don't make sense to me at all 
 Ooh, it goes 
 Duh da duh da 
 You give her spending money 
 Duh da duh da 
 But all she wanna spend is time alone (tonight) 
 Keep givin' her 
 The finer things but 
 But she don't really need that 
 If you don't stop you're 
 You're gonna end up alone (alone) 
 The world without love (duh duh da duh da) 
 Why would you do it 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it (listen) 
 Stop tryna buy her love 
 'Cause you won't ever have enough 
 There's always someone with more than you 
 You need to pay her attention 
 Give her what she needs 
 Do the simple things 
 Before you lose your girl to me 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 Play on playa 
 Yeah 
 Your girl comin' wit' me shorty, haha 
 I'm tellin' you man 
 'Cause you know 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 You better look out 
 I hear you talkin', I hear you talkin' (ha) 
 But what are you saying 
 Oh hoo oh hoo 
 Don't be a fool 
 You got a good thing 
 Man are you blind 
 Stupid or crazy? 
 You got a good thing (uh) 
 You got a good thing 
 If that's your lady 
 You better hold on 
 And give her what she want 
 Before she move on 
 Man I tell you cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing 
 If you ain't kickin it baby 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 (Fade) 
 Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no 
 It's right there, it's right there
