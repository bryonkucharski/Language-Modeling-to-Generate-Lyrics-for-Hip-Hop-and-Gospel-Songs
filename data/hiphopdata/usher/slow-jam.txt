I was all alone, I was feeling rather low 
 I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I drooped in on a dance 
 Just to take a glance and there this lovely thing was 
 She was more than enough, I asked her for her hand 
 Said would you like to dance, so pleased that I had asked 
 She quickly took my hand, and we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam 
 Oh 
 Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam 
 For my baby and for me 
 Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam 
 For my baby and for me 
 Seems what you say is true, I feel the same way too 
 You see I waited all night long just to dance with you 
 And when you touched my hand, I knew you were the man 
 To turn my world around, and make my dreams come true 
 The magic in your eyes made me realize that everything I feel has got to 
 Be real 
 And we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam 
 Usher: 
 I've been trying to find someone who I can give my good lovin' to 
 Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone 
 Monica: 
 Now I've been tryin' to find someone too 
 I prayed to heaven and then I found you 
 I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart
