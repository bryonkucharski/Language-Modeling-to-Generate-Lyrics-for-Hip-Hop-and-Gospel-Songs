'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it - ooh but you're lying 
 How come you're so wrapped up in that anger, let me get you out 
 You say that nothing can help your situation that I could do, you doubt 
 How can you be so quick to judge what you can't even see? I mean really 
 I'm not just something you have from your past, don't blame it all on me 
 Tell me, let me get ready for the letdown, but I'm not giving up now 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it ? girl, but you're lying 
 What's the problem, something's got you bent out of shape 
 'Cause I can see that you're hurting, it's written all over your face 
 I told you my only objective is to make you smile (ah baby) 
 But you keep saying I'm interrupting, in the meantime give it a little bit of loving 
 I'm going to get to the bottom of it 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it - ooh but you're lying 
 I know you told me that you had enough 
 And the pain will go away if you feel enough 
 The only way to make it through another day 
 Is to keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting 
 And when you feel like giving up 
 And you'll keep searching till you find (out) just what to do 
 You have a right to open up 
 Baby, there's no way to hide it 
 Eventually the truth will come out of you 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it ? girl, but you're lying 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it ? girl, but you're lying 
 Oh, stop lying girl
