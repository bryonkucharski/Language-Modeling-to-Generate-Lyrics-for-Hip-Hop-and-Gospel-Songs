I know you I'm afraid 
 To take a chance, along with the deep in 
 Usher baby 
 Turn the lights on 
 These waters can get a little busy 
 But I got experience 
 Don't mind trecking to the storm 
 Long as I know that you're here with me baby 
 Shedding all your innocence 
 I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate 
 Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways 
 But I promise girl I ain't afraid 
 It's raining inside your bed 
 No buts, or dry 
 Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs 
 And ever since we first met I knew that 
 I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive 
 Can't help it, no 
 I want you to feel me 
 Every little bit of me 
 I don't need a life saver 
 Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me 
 And I know they are shagging for me 
 I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate 
 Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways 
 But I promise girl I ain't afraid 
 It's raining inside your bed 
 No buts, or dry 
 Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs 
 And ever since we first met I knew that 
 I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive 
 I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby 
 You'll be my place tonight, all night 
 I'm not afraid to try 
 And knew i, don't mind playing in the rain 
 And I was hoping that I get to take that dive 
 It's raining inside your bed 
 No buts, or dry 
 Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs 
 And ever since we first met I knew that 
 I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive
