Hey mirror mirror 
 On the wall 
 Who is the greatest motherf* 
 Of them all? 
 Better yet, no you don't gotta answer that 
 'Cause I know just who that is 
 Oh yes, that's me 
 Yeah yeah that's me 
 And I'm a record breaker 'cause I put in the time 
 ... 
 Oh, I ain't got to fight for it 'cause it's already mine 
 'Cause I've been around 
 I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy 
 You know you can't keep me in your eyesight 
 Just for a moment you can call it a night 
 You're not in my radar 
 You're not in my radar 
 You're not even in my radar 
 I'm in my all black suit 
 Feeling like the James Bond 
 (I got so many chicks, they get my swagger, they want me to get with them yeah) 
 When I make my fingers go 
 You better know that means that I 
 That means that when you step up in this Porsche Carrera, better not touch anything, because 
 And I'm a record breaker 'cause I put in the time 
 On the test drive, come take a ride 
 And if I was that type of guy 
 I would correct this girl was mine 
 Yeah, I put it down 
 I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy 
 And if you can keep me in your eyesight 
 Just for the moment 
 We can call it a night 
 You might be in my radar 
 You could get up in my radar 
 ... 
 See you trying to get in my radar 
 Yeah 
 I'm usually not on this family tale tip 
 But I got to say 
 Imagine the city under the stars 
 ... 
 I can tell you want me 
 So I might save you for the night 
 I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy 
 And if you can keep me in your eyesight 
 Just for the moment 
 We can call it a night 
 You might be in my radar 
 You could get up in my radar 
 You might be in my radar 
 ...
