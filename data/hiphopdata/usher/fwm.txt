What's so complicated 
 Everythings so simple when you say it 
 No one said the shit was easy 
 No one said I'd take you out in the city 
 Forgive me forgive 
 But fuck with me fuck with fuck with me, now 
 I'mma be real with you now, I don't know why I called her 
 When you called me I was wrong, so that's why I bought ya 
 Couple things for your wrist, that's shining in the dark 
 Hope you'd forgive me that's why I bought it Yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Can't you see that I'm trying 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Baby I can change can you stick around yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down 
 Tell me what nigga is perfect 
 Tell me what nigga is right 
 Tell me what nigga has been with the same bitch 
 And she holding it down for life 
 Tell me who get it right on the first try 
 I know I did wrong but what nigga is trying harder 
 Than the one in this song 
 Can you stay down 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Boo don't give up on me now 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Baby I can change can you stick around yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Baby I can change can you stick around yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 I ain't perfect, but smile ? its worth it 
 A good man you deserve it 
 Bear with me I promise I'm working (on it) 
 I ain't changing over night 
 Didn't you see me change your life 
 I can admit that a lot, can we put this shit aside 
 Baby Don't you see my trying 
 Fuck with me 
 Baby I can change can you stick around yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 Baby I can change can you stick around yeah 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me 
 It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down 
 Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me
