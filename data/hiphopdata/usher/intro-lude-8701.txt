 Man it's been a long time coming 
 But I never forgot about you 
 I'm here 
 Yeah, we've traveled the world 
 Seen a lot of places, so many faces 
 We had a good time - we've grown together 
 Who would've thought we'd stay down this long, heh? 
 This is my chance to share my world with you 
 And I know you're gonna like it 
 Are you ready?
