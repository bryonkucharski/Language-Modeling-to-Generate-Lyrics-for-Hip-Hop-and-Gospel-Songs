"You know I wanna 
 Get a little somethin' 
 You didn't know 
 Little, 
 It ain't what you got baby 
 It's what you do with it 
 And you doin' it 
 You doin' it" 
 And my guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire 
 Caught in a love affair with feminine narcotic style 
 So fine, you got good taste 
 But I hate to see your pretty body go to waste 
 Before I see you in the bare necessities 
 Like Coco de Mer or La ?, babe 
 Get me aroused in that intimate attire 
 Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like 
 Think you got a secret, everybody knows 
 Lady in the street, in bed hos and me 
 Wearin' Cosabella with nothin' but a trench coat 
 Nothin's better 
 Girl, you're sexy 
 When you slip it on 
 Love to see you in it 
 If you add a little splash 
 You can have a lot of fun 
 (You know what I'm talkin' about) 
 'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie 
 Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace 
 Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder 
 Do G strings and pumps 
 A sheer baby doll, put it on 
 Is it up to her 
 Girl, you're a goddess 
 So when you sip that ? on, 
 Stop, your sexy silhouette 
 On the wall turns me on, oh 
 Good god, your bod, and my bod 
 Keep deep, don't mope when I say 
 Nice but nasty, I wanna tell your man 
 I do what I say 
 Girl, you're sexy 
 When you put it on 
 Love to see you in it 
 'Cause when you add a little splash 
 You can have a lot of fun 
 (You know what you're doin') 
 'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie 
 Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace 
 Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder 
 Do G strings and pumps 
 A sheer baby doll, put it on 
 Is it up to her 
 What you gonna do 
 You gonna put it on 
 Girl, you so sexy 
 Ain't gotta take it off 
 I want you to feed my fetish 
 Slide them thigh highs down 
 Looking at you got me up 
 Throw them heels back on, c'mon 
 Oh 
 Put it on 
 Girl you know you turn me on 
 On, hey, oh 
 'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie 
 Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace 
 Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder 
 Do G strings and pumps 
 A sheer baby doll, put it on 
 Is it up to her
