Umm Why, Umm Why 
 Living on the edge out of control 
 And the world just won't let me slow down 
 But in my biggest picture 
 Was a photo of you and me 
 Girl, you know I tried 
 I worked hard to provide 
 All the material things 
 That I thought that would make you happy 
 I'm confused can you make me understand 
 'Cause I tried to give you the best of me 
 I thought we were cool maybe I was blind 
 But never took time to see 
 Will you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why you want to leave 
 Baby, help me 
 Without you my whole world is falling apart 
 And I'm going crazy 
 Life's a prison when you're in love alone 
 (Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone 
 Girl, I put your love up on the shelf 
 And I guess I just left it to die 
 Now we're not together 
 'Cause I hurt you too many times 
 And now your not around 
 I wish for every moment in time 
 That I wasted we used it to make sweet love 
 Baby, be my guide please take my hand 
 Want you to know that 
 I got you if you need it 
 I don't want to be on the outside looking in 
 I got to have you girl, can't you see 
 Will you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why you want to leave 
 Baby, help me 
 Cause without you my whole world is falling apart 
 And without you I think I'll go crazy 
 Life's a prison when you're in love alone 
 (Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone 
 (Please stay don't go) Give me another chance I want to be your man 
 Girl, you got me down here on my knees 
 Crying, begging, pleading 
 I'll do anything for your love 
 Would you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 I don't understand 
 Girl I just a man 
 Help me 
 Can help me 
 Without you my whole world is falling apart 
 And without you girl I'm going crazy 
 Life's a prison without your love 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Can you help me? 
 Girl, I'll never stop because you're all I got 
 Can you help me? 
 Help me understand why I can't be your man 
 It's driving me crazy 
 Crazy, crazy, crazy 
 Ooh girl I love you 
 You know I need you 
 Can't live without you 
 (Repeat)
