This goes out to you, you, my number one (number one, number one) 
 I won't stop until I see you, suga 
 You know who you are 
 This is for my number one, number one (I see you) 
 So many shows, swear wherever I go I'm gonna keep on lookin' 
 Lookin' for my number one, number one (Oh) 
 This goes out to you baby 
 Wherever you are (my only one) 
 Just know that you're mine (number one, number one) 
 Are you there? 
 I can't hear you 
 On the road doin' shows 
 Girl I can't get you off my mind 
 All around the world 
 So many faces 
 All these places 
 Girl I just need one 
 My number one 
 This is for you, you, my number one 
 (Crowd chanting) 
 Usher! Usher! Usher!
