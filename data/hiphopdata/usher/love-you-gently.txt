First see the city skylights shining from my room 
 You're such a sight to see in the month of June 
 Beautiful like the moon's reflection when 
 It's passing off your skin and before you let me in 
 I hear you say 
 It's been a long time 
 I say okay, K, K, don't worry I got you 
 Do ya say? 
 How 'bout some foreplay? 
 Got that, got plenty, I got you 
 Do ya say? 
 Play some slow ones 
 Got that Sade, Al Green and Marvin Gaye too 
 To love you gently 
 Let me love you gently 
 Lay back relax, girl I?ma be 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 'Cause daddy know just what you like 
 Gonna love you gently 
 Light as feather but hard as a rock 
 See I know just when to finish 
 And I know just when to start 
 And I'll be lovin' your reaction 
 Every time I hit that spot 
 Gently 
 Bottom soft like leather 
 Gently 
 But the top is hard 
 Gently 
 Whisper your pleasures 
 Gently 
 Then I'll do my job 
 Invigorating, intense 
 Girl, let me do what I do 
 I don't know what's echoing louder 
 The music or you 
 Gently 
 I ain't close to be done yet 
 Gently 
 But your getting real warm 
 Gently 
 Like the calm of the thunder 
 Gently 
 Right after the storm 
 You say, you say, do you say it girl? 
 Make it 
 Gonna push it to the limit 
 It's yours, it's yours 
 See second place or win the race 
 I'm gonna be your number one 
 Till the sun shines 
 Here comes the sun forever more 
 Let's try and taste the moon again forever more 
 Let me touch you gently 
 That's the sound of love 
 Ripping shades off the wall 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 This might not be in the bedroom 
 But I'm gonna love you girl, gently 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 Let me touch you gently 
 Light as feather but hard as a rock 
 Gonna love you gently 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 Can you feel me girl? 
 We don't need no room 
 All we need is me and you 
 Wanna love you
