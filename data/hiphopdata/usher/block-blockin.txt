 She fly first class, and she keep a fresh look, you weave back 
 I can't lie, godamn you bad, damn you bad 
 When she step up on the scene with her straight black jeans 
 And her friend got class, that kind of girl to make her whole clique get mad 
 A dime piece, you could sit a cup on her ass 
 So now I'm trynna get past her girl and get up in her world

 You asked for her girl's number but she gave you hers 
 She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin 
 Everytime you go to pitch, she throws you curves 
 She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin 
 She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin 
 She screams everything I ask

 Now maybe I-I-I gotta let go 
 Now men have travelled this road many times before 
 All these stops signs I be have ignored 
 I can almost taste her, wish I could erase her 
 Fence after fence, wall after wall 
 I huff and I puff, hopin that she falls 
 It's either give her something or give nothing at all 
 I really wanna quit but her girl is the shit 
 She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin 
 You asked for her number but she slipped and gave you hers 
 She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin 
 Everytime I go to pitch, she throws me curves 
 She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin 
 She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
