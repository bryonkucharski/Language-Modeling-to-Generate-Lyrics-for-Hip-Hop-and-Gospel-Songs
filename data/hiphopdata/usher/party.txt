 The thing what's funny is 
 Y'all got the nerve to wanna P.H.D. me 
 'Cause I'm making all the money 
 Ha ha ha ha ha 
 (Jd) 
 While y'all ride matchbox, I push the hot wheels 
 Don Chi-Chi with the mass appeal 
 Lettin' champagne spills on my house in the grill 
 And all I'm about is the dolla' dolla' bill 
 Makin' ya' dance every chance I get 
 And hata's sayin' damn, will he ever catch bricks? 
 Nah, I don't catch those, keep it ghetto 
 Stayin' wit' the best hoes, on the east and the west coast 
 What? 
 (Da Brat) 
 Now, e'where I pass 
 They wanna see the big booty mamma 
 Tapping some ass 
 And whether you believe it or not 
 You see us, So-So Def make y'all true believers 
 My whole entourage keep it top notch 
 Evidently, we push V's from Bentleys to Drops 
 Got big things, baby

 She the one who love drama? 
 Keep it heated stay undefeated from the Chi comma Illinois 
 My crew make more noise than yours 
 Fifteen a night on tour, make 'em sick with no cure 
 As she sits by the bar she sips Cristies 
 In the midst of the party they bump hits by JD 
 The B.R.A.T., we the element 
 And you irrelevant 
 Get down off this shit 
 (Jd) 
 I don't pay attention to ya' hatin' and ya' bad looks 
 Just think about gettin' paper like Garth Brooks 
 Keep it off the hook 
 Let the world feel the touch 
 Y'all doing too much, sayin' ya oughta see us
