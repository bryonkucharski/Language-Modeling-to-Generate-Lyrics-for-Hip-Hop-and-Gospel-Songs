Usher speaking 
 Yo! 
 What's sup? 
 Hey! 
 My name is Usher, 
 You can trust there ain't 
 No punks in this house, 
 And if you really wanna know what my name is 
 Just Call Me A Mack 
 Word, 
 Right! 
 Just call me the mack 
 Anytime baby, 
 'Cause I ain't confused 
 Usher singing 
 I maybe got some, 
 But I got a 
 Whole lot on manly in me 
 So I'm afraid 
 That I can't complain (Huh, ha!) 
 I don't mind 
 If you wanna come by my crib 
 And chill, 
 But just be sure 
 That you call me first 
 Because the last girl that tried 
 To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no) 
 Learned how to play a player 
 And do you know why, 
 Because the mack 
 Just Call Me A Mack 
 'Cause I got it like that 
 U gotta play by the rules 
 Or I'll get back with U 
 It's a well known fact 
 That I got it like that 
 U gotta play by the rules 
 Just Call Me A Mack 
 Now, baby I ain't dumb 
 And all those silly 
 Games that you play 
 I see right through 
 So let me kick it to yah (To yah!) 
 I don't have a lot of girls, 
 But I gotta know 
 I'll get the respect that I give 
 That's just the way I live 
 Because the last girl 
 I had was moving 
 Things too fast (Slow down) 
 She tried to pull a fooler 
 And do you know 
 What had happened 
 Hook (twice) 
 Usher's Rap 
 The mack is right here 
 And yes I care as much 
 Just giving a little love 
 It's spreading everywhere 
 U see it's 
 Here 
 Here 
 And here 
 Catch a feeling 
 I'm having a little trouble 
 I know my girl will always 
 Hit it 
 Pit it 
 Like an orange 
 Cause it looks 
 Like numbness 
 My lovin' and 
 Hugin' 
 And bitterness 
 My peeps keep 
 Pumpin' 
 Humpin' 
 On stage 
 I'm engaged 
 And yes 
 The truth is it 
 U see an 
 Ugly woman 
 U better change 
 Usher singing 
 Oh, yes 
 Like Ushers' my name 
 I can't go changing 
 My ways (Oh, no) 
 As long as I'm chillin' 
 Then baby 
 U can call me the mack 
 Hook (3 times)
