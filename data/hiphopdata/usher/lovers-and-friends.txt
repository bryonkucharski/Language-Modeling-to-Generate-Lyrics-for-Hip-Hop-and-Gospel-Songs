Yeah, man 
 Once again, it's on 
 (It's on) 
 You know we had to do it again, right? 
 We had to do it again, boy 
 Want you to sing to these ladies, man 
 A'ight, so I'm up first? 
 A'ight, lemme have it 
 Let's do it 
 Baby, how ya doin'? Hope that 'cha fine 
 Wanna know what you got in mind 
 And I'm, got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone 
 Take a shot of this here Petrone' and it's gon' be on 
 V.I.P. done got way too crowded 
 I'm about to end up callin' it a night 
 You should holla at 'cha girl 
 Tell her you shake it and seized 
 Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me 
 She said, "Oh, oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah 
 'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind 
 Don't mean to sound invasion but you gotta promise, baby, oh" 
 Tell me again 
 (Tell me again, my baby) 
 That we'll be lovers and friends 
 (Oh, I gotta know, baby, oh yeah) 
 Tell me again 
 (Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave) 
 That we'll be lovers and friends 
 (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Sometime wanna be your lover 
 Sometime wanna be your friend 
 Sometime wanna hug ya 
 Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins 
 Opened up your heart 'cause you said 
 I made you feel so comfortable 
 Used to play back then 
 Now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable 
 I could be your buck, you could beat me up 
 Play-fight in the dark then we both make up 
 I'd do anything just to feel your butt 
 Why you got me so messed up? 
 I don't know but you gotta stop trippin' 
 Be a good girl, now, turn around 
 And get these whippings 
 You know you like it like that 
 You don't have to fight back 
 Here's a pillow, bite that 
 And I'll be settin' separate plays 
 So on all these separate days 
 Your legs can go the separate ways 
 Tell me again 
 (Tell me again, my baby) 
 That we'll be lovers and friends 
 (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again 
 (Tell me over and over and over again) 
 That we'll be lovers and friends 
 (Make sho' you right before you choose) 
 I's been know you fo' a long time 
 (Shawty) 
 But fuckin' never crossed my mind 
 (Shawty) 
 But tonight, I seen sumthin' in ya 
 (Shawty) 
 That made me wanna get wit 'cha 
 (Shawty) 
 But you ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me 
 (Shawty) 
 And a nigga never ever dreamed to be 
 (Shawty) 
 Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' 
 (Shawty) 
 Up in the bathtub, rub a dubbin' 
 (Shawty) 
 Are you sure you wanna go this route? 
 (Shawty) 
 Let a nigga know before I pull it out 
 (Shawty) 
 I would never ever cross the line 
 (Shawty) 
 Shawty, let me hit ya to me 
 One mo' time, one mo' time 
 Tell me again 
 (Tell me again, my baby) 
 That we'll be lovers and friends 
 (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again 
 (Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave)

 (Tell me over and over and over again)
