This is for you, you, my number one 
 This is for you, you, my number one 
 This is for you, you, my number one 
 Spotlights, big stage 
 Fifty thousand fans screamin' in a rage 
 Bodyguards limousines 
 This is the way I see you in my dreams 
 Paparazzi flash, hundred pictures all of you 
 Hangin' on my bedroom wall 
 I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen 
 But I knew since we fell in love 
 Girl I'd be 
 I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph 
 Sign it right here on my heart 
 Girl I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 And as your number one fan 
 I'll do all that I can 
 To show you how super you are 
 Front row, there I am 
 Jumpin' and hollerin' waving both hands 
 Would you notice me, little me 
 Drove twelve hours girl just to see 
 Your pretty face one more time 
 Bought my ticket I was first in line 
 This is a metaphor to show how I adore (I adore you) 
 Baby I do 
 I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph 
 Sign it right here on my heart 
 Girl I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 And as your number one fan 
 I'll do all that I can 
 To show you how super you are 
 Now you know how I feel 
 You're truly special 
 Your love is legendary to me 
 Without you my life stands still 
 I'll never leave your world 
 Treat you like a diva girl 
 Girl you're one of a kind 
 'Cause they don't make 'em like you anymore 
 So you'll be your fans life 
 I dedicate this to my superstar for all time 
 I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph 
 Sign it right here on my heart 
 Girl I'll be your groupie baby 
 'Cause you are my superstar 
 And as your number one fan 
 I'll do all that I can 
 To show you how super you are
