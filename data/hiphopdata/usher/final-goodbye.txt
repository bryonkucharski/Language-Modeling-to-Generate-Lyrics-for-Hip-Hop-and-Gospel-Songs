It's time to say goodbye 
 It's over now 
 It's time to say goodbye 
 Is there a reason why our love could not last 
 I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty 
 Lady 
 I thought we had a master plan 
 But it takes a stronger man to walk away 
 Than to watch our love fade away 
 I often wonder how and why 
 I did not cheat I did not lie 
 I hope you know how hard I tried 
 But it's over for now 
 It's time to say goodbye 
 I can't believe how suddenly things change 
 Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were 
 Heartaches 
 And pain 
 Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out 
 But in my heart I knew 
 I still had my doubts 
 I thought we made a symphony 
 It's over now no more harmony 
 I prayed so hard for love to fly (oh yeah) 
 It's time to say goodbye 
 Ooh bye bye bye bye bye 
 Sorry I gotta leave 
 Baby I'm beggin' please 
 Ooh yeah yeah yeah 
 Bye bye bye bye
