 Everytime

 All right 
 Down for me 
 With so much love 
 No matter what 
 I can't believe you deal with me 
 Even when I put you down 
 How can you keep giving? 
 When I disappoint you 
 You don't deserve it 
 But why do you take it? 
 'Cause you say I'm worth it

 And I like it babe (and I like it babe) 
 It been a minute since we spent some time 
 I was in the wrong state of mind 
 Hope I can fix it 
 With dinner by candlelight 
 A dozen roses 
 Hershey kisses for all the ground you walk on 
 If I never told you 
 I'm so proud to say you're mine 
 My time and attention 
 I'm willing to give it 
 I don't wanna lose you 
 I couldn't take it 
 Yeah your doin' the most (your doin' the most)

 And I like it babe (Ooh girl I like it)

 Love was just a game to me 
 But now I know why love's so amazing 
 Because it changed me 
 You never gave up 
 And now I know 
 True love's not taken 
 Thank God you who you are 
 Cause you gave love
