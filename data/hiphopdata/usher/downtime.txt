Everything you do is everything I know 
 No need to pretend, we both know what you want 
 Say you gotta good thing, he don't have to know 
 Everything you and I do, only I know it 
 We could make this easy 
 I know you don't need me 
 This ain't that kind of thing 
 It's more of a fling 
 That's why when you leave 
 How come I'm the only one coming through 
 Don't act like it's part of you 
 What I do in my downtime 
 Is what I do in my downtime 
 We connect, we wanna feel 
 That shit don't have no meaning 
 But what you do in your downtime 
 Is what you do in your downtime 
 That's everything I know 
 Girl that's everything I know 
 Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know 
 That's the only thing I know 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Left the country just to spend the weekend here to fuck me 
 What is not the only thing that's coming 
 All your friends are calling you 
 Like "OMG your such and such is lucky" 
 It's touching my soul 
 But little does anyone know, yeah 
 I've been working 
 I ain't perfect 
 I don't need you to tell me it's yours 
 You know what it is I adore 
 And something about it that inspires me to hit it more 
 You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in 
 Keys are still under the mat by the door 
 Ignore the mess 
 My crib ain't the cleanest from company, I had to eat in before, yeah 
 How come I'm the only one coming through 
 Don't act like it's part of you 
 What I do in my downtime 
 Is what I do in my downtime 
 We connect, we wanna feel 
 That shit don't have no meaning 
 But what you do in your downtime 
 Is what you do in your downtime 
 That's everything I know 
 Girl that's everything I know 
 Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know 
 That's the only thing I know 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
