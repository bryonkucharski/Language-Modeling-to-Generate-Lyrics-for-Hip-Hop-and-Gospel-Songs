Love, such a lonely place 
 Nobody wants to be alone 
 To have the world but no one to share it with 
 I'm so alone 
 I can't stand this feeling of being without you 
 Yes I'll do 
 Whatever it takes to prove I trully love you 
 Don't let me go 
 Let's stay together, forever and ever 
 Can't sleep without you by my side, help me
