Oh ooh 
 For you I'd write a symphony 
 I'd tell the violin 
 It's time to sink or swim 
 Watch him play for you 
 For you I'll be 
 Runnin' a million miles 
 Just to stand where you are 
 Step to the beat of my heart. 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 Coming from you I admit I 
 Rather give you the world 
 Or we can share mine 
 Know that I won't be the first one 
 Given you all this attention 
 Baby listen 
 I just need somebody to love 
 I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love. 
 (Somebody to love) 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl, I swear. 
 I just need somebody to love. 
 I need somebody I-I need somebody 
 I need somebody I-I need somebody to love 
 Everyday I bring the sun around 
 I sweep away the clouds. 
 Smile for me (Smile for me) 
 I would take 
 Every second, every single time 
 Spend it like my last dime. 
 Step to the beat of my heart. 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 Coming from you I admit I 
 Rather give you the world 
 Or we can share mine 
 Know I won't be the first one 
 Given you all this attention 
 Baby listen 
 I just need somebody to love 
 (Oh, no no no no) 
 I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love. 
 Somebody to love 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl, I swear. 
 I just need somebody to love. 
 I need somebody I-I need somebody 
 I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love. 
 I need somebody I-I need somebody. 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl, I swear. 
 I just need somebody to love. 
 And you can have it all 
 Anything you want I can bring 
 Give you the finer things, yeah 
 But what I really want 
 I can't find 'cause, money can't find me. 
 Somebody to love. 
 Find me somebody to love (Oh) 
 I just need somebody to love (Yeah) 
 I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love. 
 Somebody to love. 
 I don't need nothing else, 
 I promise girl I swear, 
 I just need somebody to love. 
 I need somebody, I-I need somebody 
 I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love. 
 I need somebody, I-I need somebody 
 I don't need nothing else, 
 I promise girl I swear, 
 I just need somebody to love 
 I need somebody 
 I need somebody 
 I just need somebody to love 
 I need somebody love, 
 I need somebody love, 
 I just need somebody to love 
 To love
