(Remix) 
 HO! (Intill Verse 1) 
 (Verse 1: Fabolous) 
 I don't know what you've been told 
 About these fours that you control 
 Now everybody know the brother's calm 
 And I cover the arm (yeah), smother the charm (yeah) 
 Girls say a brother the bomb 
 But ain't no ladies in my life, other than moms (uh uh) 
 That's till this girl changed my way 
 And it even feels strange to say 
 I'm so caught up, 'cause I can't stand to admit 
 Cupid got good aim, your man has been hit 
 (Verse 2: Usher) 
 I'm the kinda brother 
 Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my bread for years in my career 
 And every lover (y'all) 
 In and out my life, I hid love and left a tear without a care 
 (Until I met this girl who turned the tables around) 
 Met this girl, turned the tables around 
 She caught me by surprise and I 
 (I never thought I'd be the one breaking down) 
 I can't figure it out why 
 (Chorus: Usher) 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 (But she's seems she got me twisted) 
 But it seems she got me twisted 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me, yeah 
 (Verse 3: Usher) 
 (Ah ...) 
 Oh naw, let me go baby (oh) 
 Now listen (oh) 
 My momma told me 
 Be careful who you do, cause karma comes back around, same old song (now) 
 But I was so sure that it wouldn't happen to me, 'cause I know how to put it 
 Down 
 But I was so wrong 
 This girl was mean (so mean), she really turned me out (she's so mean) 
 (Her body was so tight, I'm looking for another date, top of the flashlight 
 Yeah) 
 My homies say this girl is crampin my style (she's crampin my style) 
 And I can't figure it out but 
 (Chorus: Usher) 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I don't know what it is (what it is) 
 But it seems she got me twisted (but it seems she got me twisted) 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Really feelin' it - caught up (hey) 
 I don't know what it is 
 But it seems she's got me twisted (but it seems she's got me twisted) 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Really feelin' it - caught up 
 I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me 
 (Break: Usher (w/ ad libs)) 
 (Ah...) (oh) 
 And I think I like it baby (oh) 
 Oh no, oh whoa no 
 Oh, yeah, oh my, oh 
 (Verse 4: Fabolous) 
 Yeah man 
 Now I'm the kinda brother (uh), the kinda lover (uh) 
 But I'm reminded of the (yeah) 
 Way L-O-V-E be blinded others (yeah) 
 But I know that I won't find another (no) 
 That a do like you (uh) and feel like this (uh) 
 I knew like few who real like this (uh) 
 I do like U-S-H-E-R (yeah) 
 Baby we are, two of the flyest, youngest, impedpd inggaz around 
 Throwin' seven figures around 
 Like we don't care, ain't like we don't share 
 For this girl, ain't a shoe she won't wear 
 But we don't dare (nope), say we ain't stuck (uh) 
 How you fit in a seven and say it ain't luck? (damn) 
 Sister's been bought up, yes I'm caught up 
 The Fabolous player about to get his sport up 
 Like for real 
 (Chorus: Usher) 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 (But she's seems she got me twisted) 
 But it seems she got me twisted 
 I'm so - caught up 
 Got me feelin' it - caught up 
 I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me, yeah 
 Ho! (Intil end)
