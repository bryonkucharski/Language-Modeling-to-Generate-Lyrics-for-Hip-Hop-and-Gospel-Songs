Yeah umm 
 See it's situations like this 
 That causes us players to get caught up 
 In umm the truth 
 Yeah 
 What you doing, where you been? 
 I paged you and you ain't hit me back 
 I been callin' and I know you see my number on that caller I.D. 
 Just listen to the words 
 I got reason to believe that you've been foolin' around 
 The way you feel, the passion in us 
 The things you did 
 It don't matter to me 
 For what it's worth just don't lie to me 
 Cause that ain't what I need right now 
 Baby, everything we built on trust 
 You're tearing it down 
 'Cause I know the truth hurts (truth hurts) 
 Tell me the truth now 
 What cha been doing and who 
 Ya been doing it with (truth hurts) 
 Where you been going and 
 How you been putting ya thing down (truth hurts) 
 Whatever youz was working I 
 Hope that it was worth it baby (truth hurts) 
 I got reason to believe that you been foolin around 
 Girl, I'm really tryin' hard to understand 
 I want to move on and put it in the past 
 Cause, you claim that you ain't doin' nothing 
 Must be my insecurities 
 It's got the best of me right now 
 What I know I can't hold it inside of me 
 It's gonna drive me insane 
 Bah bah bah bah baah 
 Bah bah bah bah baah 
 Bah bah bah bah baah

 Now wait a minute 
 Oh, listen babe (truth hurts) 
 The truth is I've got the secret 
 I've been keeping from you baby 
 'Cause I know that you 
 Will tear up the place 
 Punch me in my face 
 Pull the hot clips out 
 I think you need to sit down oh 
 I been blaming you 
 When I the one doing wrong 
 I'm gonna go on 
 My guilty conscience 
 Is the real reason I wrote this song 
 Tell me the truth now 
 What cha been doing and who 
 Ya been doing it with (truth hurts) 
 Where you been going and 
 How you been putting ya thing down (truth hurts) 
 Whatever youz was working I
