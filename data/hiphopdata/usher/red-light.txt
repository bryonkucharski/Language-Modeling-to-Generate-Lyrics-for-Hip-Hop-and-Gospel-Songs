Talking: 
 It's crazy 
 I can't believe that you 
 Would be the one to do 
 Do me like you do 
 Get back here baby 
 Girl you let me 
 Have my way and I was thinkin' I could get it again 
 Baby we could be friends if you only (ssh) 
 And you show me 
 Just how quick your tires could spin 
 You were off in the wind 
 Tell me were did you go 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 I should have known that you would lead me on girl 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I gotta be dreamin' 'cause I never felt like this before 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 Now its rainin 
 And I'm lookin' over at the passenger side 
 Thinkin' back in my mind how you set me off 
 She was stoppin' and droppin' me 
 Switchin from fast to slow 
 But that ain't have nothing on how you got 
 When I got you home 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 The way you touched yourself had me up the wall 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I'm searchin for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 (Talking) 
 You know 
 I really only thought 
 That this would be a one night stand 
 What you doin' to me 
 Come on 
 What you doin' to me 
 Maybe (maybe) 
 She's runnin' home to someone else (someone else) 
 Or maybe (or maybe) 
 She lost my number in her cell 
 (Ooh babe) 
 (What you doin' to me) 
 Or maybe (or maybe) 
 She's never done like this before 
 'Cause I can't see (can't see) 
 Her not comin' back for more 
 More 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her
