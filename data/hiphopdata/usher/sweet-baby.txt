When I think about your lovin', the Sunday evenings 
 The fun we use to share 
 Looking through the memories in my mind 
 Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over 
 Now I realize that it's never over only set aside 
 Oh it's you sweet baby 
 I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby 
 Only hopin' it's not too late to try again 
 It's you sweet baby 
 Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby 
 I will always be right there by your side, right by your side 
 Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin', my mind keeps wanderin' 
 My thoughts are only you 
 Wanderin' through the memories in my mind 
 How could love so real have turned so empty 
 I just keep wanderin' why 
 Will I ever find the love we share together you and I 
 Oh, it's you sweet baby 
 Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby 
 Only hopin' it's not too late to try again 
 It's you, sweet baby 
 Won't you try and believe in what I say?, sweet baby 
 I will always be right there by your side, right by your side 
 Oh it's you sweet baby 
 I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby 
 Only hopin' it's not too late to try again 
 It's you sweet baby 
 Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby 
 I will always be right there by your side, right by your side
