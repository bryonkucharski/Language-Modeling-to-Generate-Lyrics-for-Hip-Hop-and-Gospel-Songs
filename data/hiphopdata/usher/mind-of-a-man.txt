That night I said I was recording late 
 I wasn't recording late 
 I was just smokin' chillin' had a couple dranks 
 Not much of anything 
 The time I flew down to MIA 
 Damn I went MIA 
 I hit up KOD with a few bands to play 
 And that ain't everything 
 All I think about is bitches 
 And everywhere I go they comin' 
 Double standards that everybody talkin' bout 
 The tables turned around I be throwin' up 
 So I ain't tryna' justify
