Reintroduction to a feeling I don't wanna know 
 Yeah I been running but it caught me somehow 
 The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway 
 You made my heartbeat keep pumping 
 Why it ain't turning up so loud 
 Cause the fire don't fear the water 
 And the night don't fear the thief 
 It's just you and me together 
 Here we are, we are, we are, we are 
 (Buildup) 
 Here we are, we are, we found euphoria! 
 (Break beats) 
 Here we are, we are, we are, we are 
 And you're glowing from inside 
 Like the dawn is in your eyes 
 And I've seen for the first time 
 Here we are, we are, we found euphoria! 
 I went in all the way and thought I could get in and out 
 She said relax, you gonna be here for a while 
 But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway 
 And the truth is I'm learning to loving 
 And I ain't gonna turn it down 
 The fire don't fear the water 
 And the night don't fear the thief 
 Once the music takes you over 
 Here we are, we are, we are, we are 
 (Buildup) 
 Here we are, we are, we are 
 And you're glowing from inside 
 Like the dawn is in your eyes 
 And I see it for the first time 
 Here we are, we are, we found euphoria! 
 (Break beats) 
 Here we are, we are, we are 
 (Buildup) 
 Here we are, we are, we found euphoria! 
 (Break beats) 
 And you're glowing from inside 
 Like the dawn is in your eyes 
 And I've seen for the first time 
 Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
