(Know ya, know ya) 
 Let me, let me 
 (Let me love ya) 
 It only happens once in a lifetime 
 I'ma need a bite of that perfect with you, baby 
 You got me and I got you, baby 
 Tell your ex it's mine and I won't lose if you chosin', baby 
 Baby, you know that you're more than just a friend to me 
 Don't let nobody convince you that we enemies 
 I was down for the count, I was down we was out 
 And I stole it, how it would've led to me 
 You's my little secret 
 They don't know you freaky, with a chick like you I'm conceited 
 And when my mama fuck with you and my brother fuck with you, need the baby in the crib where we completed 
 You got money, I got money, no competin' 
 F gang but we always on some G shit 
 I'm on some OG with the pussy, I'mma beat it 
 Beep-beep-beep-beep, BJ and repeat it 
 Holding your love is the truth 
 Trust in me like I trust in you 
 Fuck with me like I fuck with you 
 How am I real if I ain't real with you? 
 Let me love ya 
 Let me love ya, me love ya, let me love ya 
 Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you 
 Let me love ya 
 Love you babe 
 We weren't sayin' oh 
 Love you, oh, love you oh, love you oh 
 You are the realist bitch out here, we all admit that you the shit 
 New BMW, new tint so dark the cops gotta squint 
 You drivin' out the city to make money that I'll never let you spend 
 There's something wrong, niggas will just never comprehend 
 We hit the strip together and we trip together 
 Hit the lick together, oh 
 Hit the (?) together, book the Ritz together 
 This is it forever, oh 
 Hit the (?) 1000 dollar outfit 
 'Cause I gotta flex for my baby 
 We just swerved on these hoes 
 (?) On these hoes, I wanna know 
 (When you gon' love me you gon' love me baby) 
 Let me love ya, me love ya, let me love ya 
 Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you 
 Let me love ya 
 (I need ya, let me save ya babe) 
 (You gotta know I ain't takin' over) 
 (I really love ya) 
 (Let me love you, I'm gonna love you) 
 (Who gon' treat you the best? Who gon' treat you the best?) 
 (Let me love you girl) 
 Ready 
 Told you I was ready 
 Said that I was ready for you 
 Ready 
 I'ma show you 
 (Never really mattered too much)
