What we gon' do now (oh lord, try some if you like it) 
 Is slow it down on tha flo (you know you like that) 
 (Try some if you like that) 
 Uh oh 
 Uh oh, yeah 
 When you look from outside 
 All you see is videos and shows (yeah) 
 But there's more to my life than people could ever know (uh huh) 
 Sometimes I gotta smile (smile) 
 When I don't feel like smiling 
 Sit back and ride (ride) 
 When I feel like driving 
 Nobody understands but you girl (fo sho) 
 I can always be myself with you girl 
 That's why I'm singing 
 Ooh I can't believe it 
 You came just in time with what I needed 
 And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday 
 You stay down like them girls from around the way 
 Uh oh 
 That's why I had to say 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me 
 That's why I had to say 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (uh oh) 
 That's why I had to say 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now 
 Right now 
 Since you been in my life 
 When I'm away from you I hurry home, aww yeah (aww yeah, I hurry home) 
 You live in my mind so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah (alone) 
 Sometimes I gotta go (go) 
 Where I don't feel like going 
 And when it gets too fast (fast) 
 And I feel like slowing down (slowing down) 
 No one understands but you 
 That's why I only see myself with you 
 Ooh I can't believe it 
 You came just in time with what I needed 
 Ain't nuttin' like the other girls I meet everyday 
 You stay down like them girls from around the way 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (come now) 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (girl come follow me now) 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now (ooh) 
 Right now (right now) 
 You've been there for me and I'll (so I'll) 
 I'll be there for you girl 
 Ooh I can't believe it 
 You came just in time with what I needed 
 Ain't nuttin' like the other girls I meet everyday 
 You stay down like them girls from around the way 
 (Fade) 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (what we gon' do now) 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (is slow it down on tha flo) 
 Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now 
 Right now
