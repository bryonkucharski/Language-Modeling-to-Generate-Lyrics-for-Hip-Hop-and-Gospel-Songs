Going nowhere fast 
 We've reached the climax 
 We're together, now we're undone 
 Won't commit so we choose to run away 
 Do we separate, oh 
 Don't want to give in so we both gave up 
 Can't take it back, it's too late 
 We've reached the climax, climax 
 I've fallen somehow 
 Feet off the ground 
 Love is the cloud 
 That keeps raining down 
 Where are you now 
 When I need you around 
 I'm on my knees 
 But it seems we're 
 Going nowhere fast 
 We've reached the climax 
 We're together, now we're undone 
 Won't commit so we choose to run away 
 Do we separate, oh 
 Don't wanna give in so we both gave up 
 Can't take it back, it's too late 
 We've reached the climax, climax 
 I gave my best, it wasn't enough 
 You get upset, we argue too much 
 We made our mess of what used to be love 
 So why do I care, I care at all 
 At all 
 At all 
 At all 
 Going nowhere fast 
 We've reached the climax 
 We're together, now we're undone 
 Won't commit so we choose to run away 
 Do we separate, oh 
 Don't wanna give in so we both gave up 
 Can't it back, it's too late 
 We've reached the climax, climax 
 You say it's better if we 
 Love each other separately 
 I just need you one more time 
 I can't get what we had out my mind 
 Where are you now 
 When I need you around 
 I'm on my knees 
 But it seems we're going 
 Nowhere fast 
 We've reached the climax 
 We're together, now we're undone 
 Won't commit so we choose to run away 
 Do we separate, oh 
 Don't wanna give in so we both gave up 
 Can't take it back, it's too late 
 We've reached the climax, climax
