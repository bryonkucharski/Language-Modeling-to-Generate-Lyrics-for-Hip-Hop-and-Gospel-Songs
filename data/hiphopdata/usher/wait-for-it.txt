Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it 
 Theodosia writes me a letter every day 
 I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away 
 He's on the British side in Georgia 
 He's trying to keep the colonies in line 
 Well he can keep all of Georgia 
 'Cause Theodosia, she's mine 
 Love don't discriminate 
 Between the sinners and the saints 
 It takes and it takes and it takes 
 And we keep lovin' anyway 
 We laugh and we cry and we break 
 And we make our mistakes 
 If there's a reason I'm by her side 
 When so many have tried 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 Then, I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it 
 My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, preacher, preacher, preacher 
 But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya 
 My mother was a genius, genius, my father commanded respect, respect 
 When they died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect 
 Death don't discriminate 
 Between the sinners and the saints 
 It takes and it takes and it takes 
 Yeah, we keep living anyway 
 We rise and we fall and we break 
 And we make our mistakes 
 If there's a reason I'm still alive 
 When everyone who loves me has died 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 Then I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... 
 (Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it) 
 I am the one thing in life I can control 
 (Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it) 
 I am inimitable, I am original 
 (Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it) 
 I am not falling behind or running late 
 (Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it) 
 I am not standing still, I am lying in wait 
 (Wait for it, wait for it 
 Wait for it, wait for it) 
 Everyone faces an endless uphill climb 
 You got something to prove, you got nothing to lose 
 Everyone's pace is relentless, you waste no time, time 
 What is it like in his shoes? 
 Life don't discriminate 
 Between the sinners and the saints 
 Taking me, taking me, taking... 
 And we keep living anyway 
 We rise and we fall and we break 
 And we make our mistakes 
 But I know there's a reason I'm alive 
 So many have died 
 And I'm still waiting for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 Life don't discriminate 
 Between the sinners 
 And the saints 
 It takes and it takes and it takes 
 And we keep living anyway 
 We rise and we fall and we break 
 And we make our mistakes 
 If there's a reason I'm still alive 
 When everyone who loves me has died 
 I'm willing to wait for it (Yes I am) 
 I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it 
 I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
