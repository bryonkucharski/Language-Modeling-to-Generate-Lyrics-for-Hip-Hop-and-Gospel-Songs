Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation 
 I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation 
 Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it? 
 I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music 
 I started off underground in a dark room 
 With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon 
 That transform to a pen in case of a words war 
 And opened the first door that led to the first floor 
 I got attacked by a couple of rap acts 
 They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks 
 I hit one over the head with a broken verb 
 The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word 
 But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys 
 And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise 
 I used up four bars but I earned a punchline 
 And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned 
 We don't play those games 
 Would you listen here? 
 What I'm doin' he're? 
 Get me outta here 
 We don't play those games 
 This is gettin' wild 
 Can you tell me how? 
 Let me out now 
 We don't play those games 
 How'd I get in here? 
 Let me outta here 
 What I'm doin' here? 
 We don't play those games 
 This is no fun 
 Got me on the run 
 Rap 2K1 
 I got attacked right away when I walked in 
 By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen 
 I put up my force shield to block any attempt 
 At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent 
 The floor opened up and I almost fell inside 
 But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side 
 And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap 
 I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag 
 And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle 
 But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle 
 Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you 
 I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU 
 A record exec then appeared in a black limo 
 And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos 
 And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill 
 So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill 
 I made it to the next level: Above Ground 
 My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound 
 I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked 
 And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock 
 And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll 
 'Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul 
 I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly 
 His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me 
 It took a while to finish 'em all but I finally did it 
 Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic 
 With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama 
 My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor 
 Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves 
 I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades 
 But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower 
 So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over
