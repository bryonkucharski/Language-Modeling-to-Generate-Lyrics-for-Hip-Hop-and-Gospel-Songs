U R The One 
 It was like 6 of us 
 3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck 
 On... 85 headed to the Plush 
 Ten minutes later when we pulled up 
 I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims 
 Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims 
 Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems 
 Proceeded to walk in 
 Just then I saw this 
 Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris 
 With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew... 
 U R the one 
 I don't give a damn 
 Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl 
 U R the one 
 Girl I know you'll understand 
 If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl 
 Said, I know you got a few with u 
 Don't even trip I got my crew here too 
 Keep it real what you wanna do 
 I really wanna chill with u 
 Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz 
 But if we split up maybe we can hook up again 
 U never know I guess that all depends 
 If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0 
 2.0 momo's on low Pro's 
 So finish that Mo', get your coat 
 Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause
