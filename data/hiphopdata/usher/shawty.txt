 (Intro - Lil' Jon) 
 Usher... 
 Lil' Jon... 
 Ludacris... 
 (Usher {with Lil' Jon}) 
 Yeah, man 
 Once again, it's on {It's on} 
 You know we had to do it again, right? 
 (Lil' Jon) 
 We had to do it again, boy 
 Want you to sing to these ladies, man 
 (Usher (with vocalizing)) 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 A'ight, so I'm up first? A'ight, lemme have it... 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 Let's do it... 
 (1st Verse - Usher) 
 Baby, how ya doin'? 
 Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind, 
 And I'm, 
 Got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone, 
 Take a shot of this here Petrone' and it's gon' be on, 
 V.I.P. done got way too crowded, 
 I'm about to end up callin' it a night, 
 You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shake it and seized, 
 Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me 
 She said, "Oh-oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah," 
 "'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind," 
 "Don't mean to sound invasion, but you gotta promise, baby, oh..." 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, I gotta know, baby, aw yeah) 
 Tell me again (Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby)... 
 (2nd Verse - Ludacris) 
 Sometime wanna be your lover, 
 Sometime wanna be your friend, 
 Sometime wanna hug ya, 
 Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins, 
 Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable, 
 Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable, 
 I could be your buck, you could beat me up, 
 Play-fight in the dark, then we both make up, 
 I'd do anything just to feel your butt, 
 Why you got me so messed up? 
 I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin', 
 Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings, 
 You know you like it like that, 
 You don't have to fight back, 
 Here's a pillow - bite... that, 
 And I'll be settin' separate plays, 
 So on all these separate days, 
 Your legs can go they separate... ways... 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again (Tell me over-and-over-and-over again), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Make sho' you right, before you choose)... 
 (3rd Verse - Lil' Jon) 
 I's been know you fo' a long time (shawty), 
 But fuckin' never crossed my mind (shawty), 
 But tonight, I seen sumthin' in ya (shawty), 
 That made me wanna get wit 'cha (shawty), 
 But you ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me (shawty), 
 And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty), 
 Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shawty), 
 Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin' (shawty), 
 Are you sure you wanna go this route? (shawty), 
 Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty), 
 I would never ever cross the line (shawty), 
 Shawty, let me hit ya to me one mo' time... one mo' time... 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again (Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Tell me over-and-over-and-over again)... 
 (Outro - Usher) 
 Oh-oh-hoo 
 Oh-oh-hoo 
 Oh-oh-hoo-oh-yeah...
