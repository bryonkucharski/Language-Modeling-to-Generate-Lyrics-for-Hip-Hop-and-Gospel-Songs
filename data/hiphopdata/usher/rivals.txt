She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth 
 I guess only time gon' tell 
 You gotta give me dirty love 
 I guess I'm down too 
 When I can't find any words I lie 
 Look up and see the stars in a perfect line 
 The feeling of love is a global thing 
 So tell me how you feel (how you feel) 
 Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes 
 Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized 
 Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized 
 You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though 
 I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road 
 A great ass, a better mind, what a combo 
 You know you pretty and you winning with the convo 
 She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight 
 She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way 
 But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling 
 I just love the times when I'm beside ya 
 Holding me down 'cause you're my rider 
 I look in your eyes and I get higher 
 There's nothing in this world I hold tighter 
 Without you I feel uneven 
 Make every day our love season 
 Baby girl you know you're my rider 
 That should be enough reason 
 Call you baby that's only your title 
 'Cause I don't need no more rivals 
 (You gotta give me that) 
 I put that on the Bible 
 (You gotta give me that girl) 
 You're the only thing that I want 
 Give me that feelin' 
 Make every day our love season 
 Dirty lover you are my rider 
 That should be enough reason 
 I call you baby that's only your title 
 'Cause I don't need no more rivals 
 I put that on the Bible 
 I'ma love ya till my time's gone 
 You gotta give me dirty love 
 I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though 
 I told my ex for me relationships a no-no 
 And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo 
 You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo' 
 I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place 
 I know you wanna settle down, all on your face 
 Feeling startin' to get too familiar 
 So cover up this broken love treason 
 Make every day our love season 
 Dirty lover you are my rider 
 That should be enough reason 
 I call you baby that's only your title 
 'Cause I don't need no more rivals 
 I put that on the Bible 
 You're the only thing that I want 
 Give me that feelin' 
 Make every day our love season 
 Dirty lover you are my rider 
 That should be enough reason 
 Call you bae that's only your title 
 'Cause I don't need no more rivals 
 I put that on the Bible 
 I'ma love ya till my time's gone 
 You say I see ya side by side 
 Like a visionary, I can't see me falling 
 (Nothing's changed) 
 Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this 
 (Eyes wide open) 
 I still fall blind I don't know how this will end 
 Let's go back to the beginning 
 Let's cover up this broken love treason 
 Make every day our love season 
 Dirty lover you are my rider 
 That should be enough reason 
 Call you baby that's only your title 
 'Cause I don't need no more rivals 
 I put that on the Bible 
 You're the only thing that I want 
 Gimme that 
 Ay, ay 
 Yes you are

 I don't wanna be enemies, baby 
 I want you to be friends with me, babe
