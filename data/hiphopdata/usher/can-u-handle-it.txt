 Everything I let stand between us 
 But what if I tell you too much 
 What about you babe

 I fear sometimes in my mind 
 That you won't wanna stay with my love 
 Oh baby 
 If I can be sure 
 Inside out that you know exactly 
 The man that comes to see you 
 I'll go deep as I can 
 Giving you the rest of my love 
 But what if I tell you too much 
 Uh 
 So much to explore 
 So much we have yet to discover

 Should I go there 
 Should I do it
