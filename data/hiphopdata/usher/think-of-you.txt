Oh Yeah 
 Sh De Da De Dup Dem De Doo 
 All the time I think of you 
 Holding on to someone new 
 Don't make me lose my mind 
 Seems like I've been here before 
 Baby I can't take no more 
 Of you tryin' to play me out, Baby 
 I feel so strange thinking about you 
 After all the wrong you've Done to me 
 I can't go on feeling like I do 
 Cause my heart loves you 
 I'm so confused 
 Don't waste my time 
 Cause someone like me you'll never find 
 I thought we had a good thing 
 But I was wrong and now I must move on 
 To another love one that I can trust 
 In my heart I know she'll never run away 
 Just can't talk no more 
 So I'm out the door 
 Talk to me 
 Why you wanna play love games
