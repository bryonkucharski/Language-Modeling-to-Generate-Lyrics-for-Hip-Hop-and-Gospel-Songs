Yeah, ay yo 
 2000 it's us 
 Yo, it's time to you-Turn 
 Ya heard me? 
 You're either with us - or against us, yo 
 It's been some years now 
 Since we hit the floor to get down 
 We always had a step to go with the sound 
 Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball 
 Remember, the snake 
 And how the floor used to clear 
 And everybody would break 
 What's crunk now used to be called getting to it 
 We're bringing it all back 
 This is how we do it, just 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 In the 80s, fresh was the talk 
 MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk 
 In the 90s, I had a high flat top 
 Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok 
 I can't forget about my high school days 
 The sound was Bobby Brown 
 The dance was the running man 
 Now everybody want to push Bentley's 
 The year is 2 - everybody do the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 All you need to do is let go 
 Let the tempo take over you 
 I came to have a good time 
 Let the rhythm deep iside your soul 
 Let it lead you to the floor, whoa 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn
