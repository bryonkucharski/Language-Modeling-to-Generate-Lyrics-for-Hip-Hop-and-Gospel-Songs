Yo, rich

 That girl right there, yeah, look at her 
 Watch what she do right here 
 You know, you know 
 That girl right there, she gaming 
 That girl right there, yeah 
 Listen, I been from shorty to shorty 
 From the nice girls to naughty ones 
 Coming up short, straining my throat 
 Trying tell them just what I want then I saw you 
 And I knew you wouldn't playing no 
 Hey, hey, I, I, I forgot all the skinny model 
 Chicks I've dropped check it, when I did it they get it 
 They try to flip it for me to hit it but I only want you 
 And girl I ain't even playing no, hey, I said 
 You 
 (The only one I want)

 (The only one I feel) 
 Oh, you 
 (The only one I wanna chill) 
 Oh, you 
 (Girl, give it all to me) 
 Come on 
 That girl right there 
 With the big door Nobbie earrings on 
 That girl right there 
 With her stomach all out, she got me gone 
 That girl with lip tattoo 
 That girl right there

 That girl right there, there, there 
 Yeah, right there, oh

 But I'm looking at you, wind it up, no, not you 
 Can't keep it hot, the little tattoo right above your butt 
 My ride's right outside looking so cold 
 (Come see it, girl) 
 I know you know but you don't wanna be alone 
 (No, no, no, no, no) 
 So come on let me show you

 That girl right there, there, there 
 Yeah, right there 
 Yeah, right there, na, na, na 
 Yeah, right there 
 That girl right there 
 With the little tattoo right above her 
 Thigh, thigh, thigh, thigh, thigh 
 Pierced belly button pretty toes 
 And the light brown eyes 
 Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes 
 Like yeast in the oven, all of the sudden 
 She made me rise, rise, rise, rise, rise 
 Can't get her off my mind 
 Got Luda like why, why, why, why 
 Sexy lady got me gone 
 Never thought that it can happen to a pimp 
 But I bet she was plotting all along 
 She the one that should be working with a limp 
 Or a cane 'cause her game is extra strong 
 But she better watch her back 
 'Cause in fact my plan of attack in sack 
 Or the back of the lac with the yack is extra long 
 All my ladies so, so fine 
 But in my heart I've made up my mind 
 'Cause everything that you 
 (Wear) 
 The way that you fixin' your 
 (Hair) 
 Gotta keep on acting keep 
 (Playing) 
 Keep making your boy say 
 That girl right there 
 With the big door Nobbie earrings on 
 That girl right there 
 With her stomach all out, she got me gone 
 That girl with lip tattoo 
 That girl right there 
 (That girl right there) 
 I need you right here 
 (I need you right here) 
 That girl right there, there, there 
 Yeah, right there 
 Yeah, right there 
 No, no, no 
 Yeah, right there 
 Dip slow, let it roll 
 All the way down to the floor 
 That girl she janglin' 
 That girl she janglin' 
 Dip slow, let it roll 
 All the way down to the floor 
 Watch her, she janglin' 
 That girl she janglin'
