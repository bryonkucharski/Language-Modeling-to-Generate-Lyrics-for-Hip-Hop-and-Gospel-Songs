These days it's hard to find 
 Someone to love 
 Once you find them 
 You don't want to give up 
 And now I know that we're 
 Both alone in this 
 It's just me and you 
 Against the world 
 And there's me 
 And there's you 
 It's just me and you 
 Against the world 
 (Oh girl) 
 And, what am I supposed to do 
 The alarms are going off in my head 
 And It's dangerous 
 Yes It's complicated 
 We're the only ones who get it 
 The only ones that want this 
 The only ones who believe 
 In love 
 It's just the two of us 
 Getting into love 
 It take two of us 
 To change the world 
 I've got you 
 You've got me 
 It's just me and you 
 Against the world 
 Girl, you got me so crazy in longing 
 And I know it's wrong but so right 
 And I'm holding you 
 I have been dreaming 
 And I can't let you go 
 Now, you're mine 
 Girl, what am I supposed to do 
 The alarms are going off in my head 
 It's just the two of us 
 Getting into love 
 It takes two of us 
 To change the world 
 I got you 
 You got me 
 It's just me and you 
 Against the world 
 It's just the two of us 
 Getting into love 
 It takes two of us 
 To change the world
