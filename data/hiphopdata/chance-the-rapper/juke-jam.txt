We used to roll at the rink 
 We used to roll at the rink 
 I used to talk way too much 
 You used to know everything 
 You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you 
 You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too 
 Your big brother foot work 
 Your play sister Juke 
 The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you 
 As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues 
 Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute 
 And realized what booties could do 
 We gon' get it poppin' 
 We gon' get it Jukin' 
 We gon' throw a party 
 And we ain't gotta do shit 
 You came with your best friend 
 Came up for the weekend 
 Rolling with your party 
 So tell me what you thinkin' 
 Say we gon' have a juke jam 
 We gon' have a juke jam 
 We can have a party, just listening to music 
 Like we used to do 
 I'll get close to you 
 I remember you 
 You used to, I remember you 'cause 
 We've got so much history baby (juke) 
 Maybe (juke) 
 Maybe you and I were meant to be 
 Maybe (juke) 
 I'm crazy (juke) 
 We never rolled at the rink 
 We would just go to the rink 
 You ain't buy tokens no more 
 You just hip roll at the rink 
 You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him 
 But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in 
 I mean it's just dancing 
 It's harmless as fuck 
 Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up 
 Then we hit the floor 
 All the kiddies stopped skating 
 To see grown folks do, what grown folks do 
 When they grown and they dating 
 We've got so much history baby, maybe 
 Maybe you and I were meant to be 
 Maybe, I'm crazy 
 Crazy about you 
 We gon' get it poppin' 
 We gon' get it Jukin' 
 We gon' throw a party 
 And we ain't gotta do shit 
 You came with your best friend 
 Came up for the weekend 
 Rollin' with your party 
 So tell me what you thinkin' 
 Say we gon' have a juke jam 
 We gon' have a juke jam 
 We can have a party, just listening to music 
 Like we used to do 
 I'll get close to you 
 I remember you 
 You used to, I remember you 'cause 
 We've got so much history baby (juke) 
 Maybe (juke)
