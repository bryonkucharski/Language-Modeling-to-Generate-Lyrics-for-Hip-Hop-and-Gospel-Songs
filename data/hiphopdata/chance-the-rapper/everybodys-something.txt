What's good good? 
 And what's good evil? 
 And what's good gangstas? 
 And what's good people? 
 And why God's phone die every time that I call on Him? 
 If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him 
 Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon 
 Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum 
 Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him 
 Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of em 
 I slurped too many painkills, downing em off a lot 
 I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock 
 Ya'know what I mean? 
 I got the Chicago Blues 
 We invented rock before the Stones got through 
 We just aiming back cause the cops shot you 
 Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News" 
 Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck ops too 
 Ain't no knuckling up em young 'cause it just not cool 
 Nice to see you Father New Year 
 Middle finger Uncle Samuel 
 Shooting death with weighted dice 
 And hitting stains on birthday candles 
 I know somebody, somebody loves my ass 
 'Cause they help me beat my demons ass 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 I know you right 
 Nobody's nothing 
 That's right 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 I know you right 
 Nobody's nothing 
 That's right 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 I know you right 
 Nobody's nothing 
 Right? IGH 
 I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white 
 But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white 
 And both my parents was black 
 But they saw it fit that I talk right 
 With my drawers hid but my hard head 
 Stayed in the clouds like a lost kite 
 But gravity had me up in a submission hold 
 Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed 
 In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole 
 And two missing toes 
 But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe 
 Nice to see you Father New Year 
 Middle finger Uncle Samuel 
 Shooting death with weighted dice 
 And hitting stains on birthday candles 
 I know somebody, somebody loves my ass 
 'Cause they help me beat my demons ass 
 Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over 
 The type to love from a distance not the type that told her 
 Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over 
 With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors 
 Coppers and quotas 
 Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught 
 Obviously they are on a come up 
 With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer 
 Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones 
 All odds against us, we tryna get lucky 
 Doper than Nucky 
 You're ending happy that's only a tuggy 
 Like Satan masturbating shit come hot 
 But y'all still love me ugh 
 How father time a deadbeat 
 Maybe I'm adopted 
 That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 Nigga 
 Nobody's nothing 
 Nigga 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 Nigga 
 Nobody's nothing at all 
 Wu-Tang 
 Everybody's somebody's everything 
 I know you right 
 Nobody's nothing 
 I know you right
