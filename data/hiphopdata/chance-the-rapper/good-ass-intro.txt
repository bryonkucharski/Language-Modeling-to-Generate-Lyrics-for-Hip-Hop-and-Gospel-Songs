BJ the Chicago Kid, Lili K., Peter Cottontale, Kiara Lanier, and Chance The Rapper: 
 Even better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh (Yo we back) 
 I'm good, ooohh yeah, I'm good 
 Even better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 (I'm good, so good) 
 (And we back and we back and we back and we back) 
 (And we back and we back and we back and we back) 
 Even better than I was the last time 
 Chance The Rapper: 
 Rap's just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy 
 Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy 
 And I still make this song, and I'mma make another 
 If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother 
 Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother 
 Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors 
 Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter? 
 Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater 
 Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean 
 Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen 
 Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy 
 Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy 
 But I can't complain I got some motherfucking bitches 
 How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended? 
 Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it 
 You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job and I'm good 
 BJ the Chicago Kid, Lili K., Peter Cottontale, and Kiara Lanier: 
 Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 (I'm good) I'm good, so good 
 Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 I'm good, so good 
 Chance The Rapper: 
 Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang 
 Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane 
 Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame 
 But God I'm good, swear I couldn't be better 
 Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames 
 Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue 
 Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs 
 See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums 
 If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs 
 Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say, "The Rapper" 
 Magical word, poof, please say, "Kadabra" 
 Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers 
 Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes 
 Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn 
 It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb 
 I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb 
 This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done, I'm good, igh 
 BJ the Chicago Kid, Lili K., Peter Cottontale, and Kiara Lanier: 
 Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 I'm good, so good 
 Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 I'm good (I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be), so good 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be 
 I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be 
 Chance The Rapper: 
 You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job and I'm good
