 Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch, wanna know how lips taste 
 (She carry on, she carry on) 
 I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch, wanna know how the lips taste 
 All I can hear is the third, ay 
 All I can hear is the third, ay 
 We don't know none of your words, ay 
 We don't know none of your words, ay 
 I love my women real tall, ay 
 Type that can really play ball, ay 
 You buy my hat at the park, ay 
 Think I might really play ball, ay 
 I got a link in my bio, my bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo 
 They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo 
 How can they call themselves bosses 
 When they got so many bosses 
 You gotta see what your boss say 
 I get it straight out the faucet 
 I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop 
 Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop 
 And yeah my momma got real worried when she heard college drop 
 But now I call the shots 
 I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
 I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
 Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama 
 She sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna 
 She shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma 
 Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda 
 That booty gon' roll and it's outta control 
 And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty 
 All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me 
 Rub me down with that lotion, babe oil me 
 Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me 
 In that choppa I see your perimeter 
 Change the culture, 'cause my ring is a solar 
 Wait one minute I told you 
 Yeah, I would like to know you 
 Yeah, you lucky like clovers 
 Yeah, the clothes no good 
 Mama I do it, your ass I pursue it 
 Just look at me baby 
 I came from the sewers 
 They love all the slime ball 
 Like they fuck all these cats on your slime dog 
 I got me some rings like I'm Bruce Bowen 
 I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul 
 I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
 I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
 Am I the only one who really care about cover art 
 Growing up I ain't have my brother 'cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start 
 I ain't know what that mean 
 I bumped heads with my dean 
 Dropped out and hit the scene 
 Now I'm stunting like bling 
 Time and time again they told me no 
 They told me I wouldn't go 
 'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes 
 Well, maybe that shit was my interest 
 Now I spend more than they make at my dentist 
 After 1Night the folks thought I was finished 
 I pin my name to the game like a seamstress 
 Oh, bitch I bite like a gator 
 Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper 
 Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater 
 Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer 
 Oh, they fuck with me 'cause I'm different 
 New sound, new appearance 
 Bitch it's Boat from the 6 
 Give a fuck about a bitch 
 Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit 
 I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste 
 I said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
 Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
