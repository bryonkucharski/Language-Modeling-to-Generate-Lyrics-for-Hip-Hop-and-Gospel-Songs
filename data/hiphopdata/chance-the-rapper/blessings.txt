I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone 
 I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap 
 It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap 
 I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom 
 Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom 
 Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air 
 Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair 
 Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy 
 Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family 
 He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest 
 And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath 
 I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone 
 Don't be mad 
 I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone 
 When the praises go up 
 (Good God) 
 The blessings come down 
 Good God 
 When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap) 
 The blessings come down 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (Good God) 
 They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor 
 With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors 
 Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven 
 I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven 
 I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions 
 Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything 
 I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs 
 I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled 
 They want four minute songs 
 You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn 
 I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn 
 Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter 
 Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh! 
 There are obstacles in life 
 Many many trials and tribulations that come up 
 But you got to realize and know 
 That even Jericho walls must fall 
 Every wall must fall 
 Fall Jericho, fall 
 I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone 
 (Good God) 
 I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (The blessings come down) 
 (Good God) 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (Are you ready for your blessings?) 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (Are you ready for your miracle?) 
 When the praises go up, the blessings come down 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 (Are you ready, are you ready?) 
 It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
