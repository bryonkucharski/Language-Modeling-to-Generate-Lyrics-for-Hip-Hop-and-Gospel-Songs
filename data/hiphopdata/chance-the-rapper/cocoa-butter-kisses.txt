Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Okie dokie, alky. Keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro 
 Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi 
 Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote 
 If I sip any Henny, my belly just mght be outtie 
 Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie 
 I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky 
 Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me" 
 Two weeks she'll be yelling "fuck me" 
 Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie 
 And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me 
 Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me 
 Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me 
 My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM) 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale 
 Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going 
 Say the goings well 
 Go figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell 
 All praise to the God, God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL 
 Check, check mate, check me, take me to the bedroom, let you know me well 
 I mean normally, you see, Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil 
 But these kids these days they get so high, burn trees, smoke Chlorophyll 
 Till they can't feel shit, shit faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L 
 Elevated, train, and the craziest thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill 
 Miseducated, my dick delegated, rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it 
 Probably shoulda been dead or in jail 
 Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class 
 Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass 
 I think we all addicted, yeah 
 I think we all addicted, really though 
 I think we all addicted 
 I think we addicted 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I think we all addicted 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter 
 Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi 
 Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie 
 I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi 
 You see, I be still a God but a goofy 
 You be flowing out by trucks in a Uzi 
 That's the new principle, sometimes I'm a be about some ho 
 Sometimes I'm a wanna make a movie 
 And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson 
 And though my style freakish, I could still break your body 
 Down to five pieces like I did Voltron 
 'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG 
 Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see 
 Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics 
 Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key 
 Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing 
 If I don't know what a miss is 
 I'm a end up figuring out that it's home 
 And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses 
 This is just a testament to the ones that raised me 
 The ones that I praise and I'm thanking 
 I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes 
 And I wanna get a hug and I can't 'cause I'm stanking 
 Never too old for a spanking 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I think we all addicted 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses
