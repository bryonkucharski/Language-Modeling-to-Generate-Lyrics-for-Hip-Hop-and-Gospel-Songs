Ten damn days 
 And all I got to show for it 
 Is shoes and shows and chauffeurs with road rage 
 Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, always 
 Still gotta letterman, no practice 
 Still gotta burner man, no lacking 
 Still outtin Jams nigga, no Jackson 
 No Jordan and we toe-tagging 
 I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand 
 And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance 
 And the money ain't yours 
 Now it's just a red pill 
 Got a blue and a hand full of Advils 
 I'm the new Nitty, fuck it Nitty the the old me 
 So I'm a tell the buyer what Nitty told me 
 I got that mmm mmm 
 I got that goddamn 
 I'm yo pusha man 
 I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man 
 Pimp slapping, toe tagging 
 I'm just tryna fight the man 
 I'm yo pusha man 
 I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man 
 You a lame 
 And your bitch break down my weed sometimes 
 See my face in the streets, in the tweets 
 And a Reader or a Redeye if you read Sun-Times 
 She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D 
 Even though I only beat one time 
 One time it was one two times 
 It was two plus me equals threesome time 
 Shouts out to Nate 
 I jackball and I bop, I flex 
 Got neck from all these thots I sex 
 Rastafari them shottas yes 
 House safari, mi casa, yes 
 Poppy fields of that popeye 
 She came to party, she popped a Molly 
 Said "come to papa", she said "papa, yes" 
 I got that mmm mmm 
 I got that goddamn 
 I'm yo pusha man 
 I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man 
 Pimp slapping, toe tagging 
 I'm just tryna fight the man 
 I'm yo pusha man 
 I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 Move to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch 
 Somebody'll steal daddy's rollie and call it the neighborhood watch 
 Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch 
 Captain save the hood, hood savior, baby boy 
 Still get ID'd for swishers 
 Mama still wash my clothes 
 Still with Save Money militia 
 I'm a still watch my bros 
 Trapped in the middle of the map, with a little bitty rock 
 And a little bit of rap 
 That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac 
 And like literally jack 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 They merking kids, they murder kids here 
 Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here 
 Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? 
 Somebody get Katie Couric in here 
 Probably scared of all the refugees 
 Look like we had a fucking hurricane here 
 They be shooting whether it's dark or not 
 I mean the days is pretty dark a lot 
 Down here it's easier to find a gun 
 Than it is to find a fucking parking spot 
 No love for the opposition 
 Specifically a cop position 
 Cause they've never been in our position 
 Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips 
 With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip 
 Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz 
 But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits 
 I know you scared 
 You should ask us if we scared, too 
 I know you scared 
 Me too 
 I know you scared 
 You should ask us if we scared, too 
 If you was there 
 Then we just knew you'd care, too 
 It just got warm out 
 This this shit I've been warned about 
 I hope that it storm in the morning 
 I hope that it's pouring out 
 I hate crowded beaches 
 I hate the sound of fireworks 
 And I ponder what's worse 
 Between knowing it's over and dying first 
 'Cause everybody dies in the summer 
 Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring 
 I heard everybody's dying in the summer 
 So pray to God for a little more spring 
 I know you scared 
 You should ask us if we scared, too 
 If you was there 
 Then we just knew you'd care, too
