All she needed was some 
 At a Clippers' game on the court-side 
 Watch a nigga' shoot like a .4-5 
 They mad at me, too, I got more fire 
 Why these bitches see you "go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger) 
 Tia and Tamara in my bed I'm a smart guy 
 I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid 
 Hits on my list, check my archive 
 I'm something so immaculate 
 Instead of asking what's happenin' and rather blastin' 
 Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker 
 Than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon 
 The girls that you brought man, where are they from? 
 Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation 
 Why you standin' there, say som', girl say som' 
 No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house 
 All she needed was some 
 Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga 
 Wanna take shots? AK, nigga 
 When I ball, I'mma ball King James, nigga 
 Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga 
 And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga 
 That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all 
 You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub 
 Ice cream paint job in the garage 
 I had a menage, and murdered the vag' 
 But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck 
 'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up 
 I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face 
 I-I-I couldn't finish, got the uber from her place 
 On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper 
 Listening to the neighbors 
 All she needed was some 
 Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god 
 Our neighbors 
 All alone, no no no no
