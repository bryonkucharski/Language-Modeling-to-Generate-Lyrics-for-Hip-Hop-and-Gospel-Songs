I speak of promise land 
 Soil as soft as momma's hands 
 Running water, standing still 
 Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile 
 Rice under black beans 
 Walked into Apple with cracked screens 
 And told prophetic stories of freedom 
 Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold 
 Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing 
 I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood 
 Make you remember how to smile good 
 I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label 
 Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath 
 Kanye's best prodigy 
 He ain't signed me but he proud of me 
 I got some ideas that you gotta see 
 Make a vid with Shawty and they ship it like the odyssey 
 They never seen a rapper practice modesty 
 I never practice, I only perform 
 I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn 
 I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public 
 He keep my rhymes in couplets 
 He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans 
 I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school 
 I used to pass out music, I still pass out music 
 The people's champ must be everything the people can't be 
 I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys 
 You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be 
 Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes 
 I made it through, made it through, made it through 
 And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you 
 You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming 
 So are you ready? 
 Are you ready for your blessings? 
 Are you ready for your miracle? 
 Are you ready for your blessings? 
 Are you ready for your miracle?
