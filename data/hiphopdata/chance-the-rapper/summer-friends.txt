Oh, oh, oh, incredible 
 My Lord, incredible 
 I believe 
 Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids 
 I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib 
 Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys 
 None of my niggas ain't had no dad 
 None of my niggas ain't have no choice 
 JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them 
 79th street was America then 
 Ice cream truck and the beauty supply 
 Blockbuster movies and Harold's again 
 We still catching lightning bugs 
 When the plague hit the backyard 
 Had to come in at dark 
 Cause the big shawtys act hard 
 Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing 
 First day, nigga's shooting 
 Summer school get to losing students 
 But the CPD getting new recruitment 
 Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more 
 Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more 
 (You're my friend) Summer friends don't stay 
 (You're my friend) Summer friends, just stay, hey 
 Stay around 
 Summer friends, summer friends 
 (You're my friend) Summer friends don't stay 
 Summer friends don't stay, hey 
 Stay around, yeah 
 (And some of us) 
 Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair 
 Momma had salon doing the perms out the armchair 
 Yeah we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare 
 I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh 
 Now I'm the same way 
 Over time all the time, every night, hey 
 Ready my blessing, now I'm ready, how I wait 
 Never let a friendship get in my way 
 Never let a blog get in my way 
 Make the whole song do whatever I say 
 79, 79, 79, 79 place 
 79, 79, 79, 79 place 
 Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork 
 They was good friends, but I faked the flirt 
 'Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work 
 It's been a minute since I called on a friend 
 Fucked up and fucked all my friends 
 All my friends 
 All my 
 Stick around 
 Summer friends, summer (you're my friend) 
 Summer friends don't stick around 
 Stick around, yeah (and some of us) 
 79, 79, 79, 79, hey 
 79, 79, 79, 79, hey 
 79, 79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey 
 (You're my friend) 79, 79, 79, 79, hey 
 (So put your head on my shoulder) 79 
 City wide, city wide, city wide, hey 
 City wide, city wide, city wide, hey 
 City wide, city wide, city wide, hey 
 City wide, city wide, city wide, hey 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 City wide, city wide, city wide 
 (I will wait around for you) 
 (I will wait around for you) 
 (So lay your head) 
 May the Lord give your journey mercy 
 May you be successful, grant you favor 
 And bring you back safely, I love you 
 When I was so young before, I could remember 
 I would always treat my gang like family members 
 Even when the changing nigga never changed up 
 I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up 
 When I was so young before, I could remember 
 I would always treat my gang like family members 
 Even when the changing nigga never changed up 
 I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
