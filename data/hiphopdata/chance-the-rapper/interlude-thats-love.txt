Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 What's better than tripping is falling in love 
 What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon and all the above 
 What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club 
 Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club 
 What's better than paper is balling it up 
 What's better than followers is actually falling in love 
 What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin in mud 
 Rolling in green pastures, wandering following love 
 What's better than eating is feeding your fam 
 What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam 
 What's better than leaning and needing your Xan 
 Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land 
 What's better than yelling is hollering love 
 What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes and dollars and dubs 
 Is dialing up your darling just for calling her up 
 There ain't nothing better than falling in love 
 I've seen it come back, back, back and forth 
 You hit the nail right on top of the head 
 I know you seen it all before 
 But when it looks you in the eyes 
 It ain't nothing you could say, but that's love 
 That's love 
 That's love 
 That's love 
 Say that's love 
 That's love 
 That's love, that's love, that's love 
 I love you, I love you 
 I love you, I love you 
 I love you, sing it right now, I love you 
 I love you, I love you 
 I love you 
 That's love 
 That's love, that's love 
 Say that's love 
 That's love, that's love 
 That's love, that's love, that's love
