(Eminem) 
 Yo, Yo, Yo, Back to me, Back to me, 
 I can keep that beat? 
 Yo, Weed Lacer, 97' burgundy Blazer 
 Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer 
 I'm on some lok' ish, 
 I'm fed up wit the being broke ish 
 I'm not to joke wit 
 Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it 
 Having a coke-fit and goin' through withdrawls daily 
 Shoot up with Mesciline Infront of my baby daughter Hailey 
 My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits 
 Too many asprin tablets, empty medicine cabinets 
 Losing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted 
 Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' about, "Who won it?" 
 Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it 
 My 9's at your brain, is that your chain? Run it 
 Crews die from an over-dose of your exessive flavor 
 Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager 
 Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer 
 Stole your moma's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her 
 (Right right right!) ((Ding!)) 
 Cruise In nike jackets, Escaped from Psyciatrics 
 Told the nurse to save my bed for me 
 "I might be back Trick" 
 So barricade your Entrance, put up some extra fences 
 A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses (Ooh) 
 Chasin' Dips 
 ...Take em' on long vacation trips 
 Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships 
 Mess up your face and lips 
 Slit your stomach and watch your gut split 
 Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter)) 
 Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone 
 I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on 
 I'm messed up, I feel just like an over worked plumber 
 I'm sick of the crap, what's Jack Kevorkian's phone number? (Ha... Hot)
