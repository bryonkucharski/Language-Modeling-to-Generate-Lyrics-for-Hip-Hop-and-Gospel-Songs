It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids 
 Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is 
 Oops, I did it again, didn't I? My shit's harder 
 To figure out than what Britney's tit size is 
 Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch? 
 So what? Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits 
 You know how many shit's I get if I wish I did 
 So, I can quit givin' these twisted little kids ideas 
 This just in, Britney just dissed Justin 
 She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him 
 If Afflec can get his ass licked, how I can't shit 
 Goddamn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this 
 Are those pictures they made of us together on the Internet? 
 As close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin' it from the back 
 And shit when it comes to that I hit harder from the back 
 Than Everlast when he's pluggin' Lethal in his fuckin' ass 
 Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time 
 Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line 
 To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is 
 Fuck your jewelery, my record's almost diamond, beotch 
 What's goin' on in the world today? 
 People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay 
 Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll 
 Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music

 Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do 
 So fuck him and the Backstreet Boys too 
 Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes 
 Mary's broke, Ty's snortin' coke and then an overdose 
 I got two little boys with me 
 Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me 
 I'm up early wit my hair curly 
 Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin' Laverne and Shirley 
 A lotta rappers are livin' in la la land 
 That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men 
 As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad 
 I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad 
 My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned 
 And she keeps askin' me why I rap wit a honky 
 But Granny, I'm a flunky, I could be a junky 
 I could be hangin' with the hoochies out at the club scene 
 To all the independent women in the house, hey 
 Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin' mouth, what? 
 Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston 
 The shit's confusin', Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal 
 Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's', PeeWee Herman's 
 Peep show places, public restrooms, peep those cases 
 What's goin' on in the world today? 
 People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay

 Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us, for what? 
 We done turned their kids into little body snatchers 
 Ain't like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue 
 Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns? 
 It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme 
 Where you work you ain't gettin' paid for that overtime 
 It's only music, media know it but they blind 
 I ain't in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine 
 Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin' 
 If you people get offended I don't care, stop cryin' 
 Tryin' to get us to leave 'cause what we say just ain't clean, uh, uh 
 But holdin' back on what I say just ain't me 
 Now, what's these parents all mad for? 
 Your music is bad for, um, for teenage kids that drink 
 More than Ted Danson in Cheers Carson drink beers 
 We all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch, shut up 
 Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit 
 I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit 
 So when they ask me about my sarcasticness 
 I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this 
 What's goin' on in the world today? 
 People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
