You're drunk, the carpet is burned 
 I hate to find you like this 
 I always find you like this 
 I come home and clean up your mess 
 What would you do without that? 
 Why do I always come back? 
 Oh, what I wouldn't do for you 
 And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Some nights I want to run for the hills 
 It's never easy with you 
 I cannot reason with you 
 But your smile is as rare as it comes 
 What would I do without that? 
 Maybe that's why I come back 
 Oh, what I wouldn't do for you 
 And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Startin' to think we were made for each other 
 But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other 
 You remind me of my mother 
 We drive one another crazy as each other 
 And we're both adults so there's no excuse 
 For the games that we play with each other 
 Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, motherfucker 
 But I give her the benefit of the doubt 
 Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her 
 'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker 
 Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble 
 She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again 
 Give her another chance? Another one after that? 
 I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial 
 Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile 
 Makin' an excuse for us to act it out 
 She's just actin' out, with her inner child 
 Then I set the truth on fire 
 'Cause I'd rather believe a lie 
 Than to breathe a sigh of relieve I don't believe in 
 Going to bed mad, I keep on tryin' 
 To make a bad girl good 
 But haven't I stood by you in good times? 
 And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad 
 'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a "should I 
 Leave you for good?"-so never would I 
 It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye 
 But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy 
 And you're a good person too 
 I can save you, I can make you change 
 But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth 
 Every time I gotta come and bail you out 
 When you get in trouble that you get yourself in 
 And I'm in trouble but I can't leave, I'll sell you out 
 I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that? 
 I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it 
 But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it 
 I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart 
 Our apartment's tore apart 
 You're usin' my heart for a dartboard 
 But God must've aligned stars for us 
 'Cause somebody paired us up 
 And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake 
 But this one's perfect 
 'Cause I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me 
 Maybe you need me
