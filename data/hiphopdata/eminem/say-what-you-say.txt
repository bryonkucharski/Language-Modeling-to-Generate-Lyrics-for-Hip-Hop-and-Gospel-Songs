Dr. Dre 
 So I'm out the game huh? 
 Eminem 
 Yo Dre, we riding? 
 Dr. Dre 
 Whatever 
 Eminem 
 Well I'm with ya, homie 
 Dr. Dre 
 OK 
 Let's handle the small shit 
 Eminem 
 I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit 
 Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit 
 Grew up too quick, went through too much 
 Knew too much shit, corrupt 
 And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch 
 Thick n'rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth 
 Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth 
 'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth 
 And if I fumble a verse, keep going 
 First take, I make mistakes, just keep it 
 No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit 
 Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit 
 Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit 
 Dr. Dre 
 Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane 
 Been here longer than anyone in the game 
 And I ain't got to lie about my age 
 Eminem 
 But what about Jermaine? 
 Dr. Dre 
 Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name 
 And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're saying 
 I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked 
 When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it 
 You midget, mini-me, with a bunch of little mini-yous 
 Running round your backyard swimming pools 
 Over eighty million records sold 
 And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds 
 Eminem 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this 
 Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup 
 If you ever mix me up 
 Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri 
 We'll rub it in, every club you're in 
 We'll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain 
 Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play Devil's advocate 
 Dr. Dre 
 If there was some magic shit I could wave 
 Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone 
 And buried to make sure the tradition carries on 
 I would 
 Eminem 
 If I could only use this power for good 
 I wouldn't, not even if I could 
 Dr. Dre 
 From the 'hood and I'm a hornet 
 And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered 
 Eminem 
 And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning 
 And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off 
 'Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off 
 Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk 
 Don't give a fuck; white-Pac, so much spunk 
 When I was little I knew I would blow up 
 And sell a mil' or grow up to be Atilla 
 Go nuts and be a killer 
 Dr. Dre 
 And I'm something of a phenom' 
 One puff of the chron' 
 I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again 
 There's no obstacle that I can't conquer 
 So come along with us 
 Eminem 
 C'mon! 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 Dr. Dre 
 Now anybody who knows Dre 
 Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day 
 But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play 
 Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet 
 However you want it, you can have it your way 
 You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day 
 Bullet with your name, sending it your way 
 That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway 
 'Cause this is my space; you invade it? 
 Live to regret it then you die trying to violate it 
 Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated 
 Eminem 
 Like my old lady? 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Sometimes what you mean is two different things 
 Depending on your mood, if it swings 
 Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed 
 I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone 
 And now I'm back 
 I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad 
 Dr. Dre 
 And I can pull any string 
 Don't have to prove anything 
 Catch a contract on your head 
 You headed West, talk shit about Dre? 
 You better get a vest, and invest in something 
 To protect your head and neck 
 Eminem 
 And it's back and forth all day like 
 Red 
 and 
 Meth 
 I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth 
 But a lot of truth is said in jest 
 And if I ever do live to be a legend 
 I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in ""The Source""? 
 Ain't holding my fucking breath 
 But I suffocate for the respect 
 'Fore I breath to collect a fucking check 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it 
 So who you playing with, huh? 
 Dr. Dre 
 Watch your fuckin' mouth 
 Timbaland 
 Yo this 
 Timbaland 
 Tell him I said suck my dick
