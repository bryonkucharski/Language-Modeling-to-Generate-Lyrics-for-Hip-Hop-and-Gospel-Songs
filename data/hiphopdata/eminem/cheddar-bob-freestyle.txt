Cheddar, I can rip you to a shredder 
 Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC then me 
 I'm B. Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee 
 Float like a butterfly, what am I? 
 So what if I cut a guy? Did I stutter guy? 
 Leave you punch drunk from lunch, truck to shelter 
 You never felt the rag that held the skelta, melt ya 
 Got the belt for the welt to weight champ 
 You got in with a fake stamp 
 Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes 
 Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole 
 Next gun, pull it slow 
 And aim at the free world before you let it go 
 Instead of oh, I just shot my dick head 
 And yes, you do gotta big head 
 I can't call it Cheddar, where's your wallet? 
 You're so drunk, you can out drink the alcoholics 
 Make them say, "Damn, Cheddar's the man 
 He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"
