Oh shit 
 Guess what? 
 I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in a minute 
 Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this 
 Back when Mark Wall burg was Marky Mark 
 This is how we used to make the party start 
 We used to mix in with Bacardi dark 
 And when it kicks in you can hardly talk 
 And by the sixth gin you gone probably crawl 
 And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf 
 And my pre-diction is that you gone probably fall 
 Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall 
 And every things spinnin' your beginning 
 To think women are swimmin' in 
 Pink linen again in the sink 
 Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished 
 You are now allowed to officially slap bitches 
 You have the right to remain violent and start wildin' 
 Start a fight with the same guy that was smart rhymin' 
 Get in the car and start it and start drivin' 
 Over the island and cause a 42 car pile up 
 Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot 
 Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it 
 All I could see is a bunch of smoke flyin' 
 And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it 
 Let me out of this place I'm outta place 
 I'm in in outter space, I've just vanished without a trace 
 I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
 I'll be back in an hour or so 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
 (Whoa) 
 Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
 (Whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay 
 (Whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold on me 
 (Whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
 (No) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go 
 (Go) 
 I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
 (Whoa) 
 Is drug's really gotta hold on me 
 In third grade all I used to do 
 Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube 
 Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Joo 
 Schemein' on the first chick with the hugest boobs 
 I got no game, and every face looks the same 
 They got no name, so I don't need game to play 
 I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want 
 Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want 
 However I do show some respect to few 
 This ecstacy has got me standin' next to you 
 Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you 
 We just met, but I think I'm in love with you 
 But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too, 
 Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?" 
 I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do 
 'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you 
 But in the long run these drugs are gonna catch up sooner or later 
 But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy 
 Let the ex destroy your spinal chord 
 So it's not a straight line no more 
 So we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls 
 Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur 
 Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more 
 So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
 (Whoa) 
 Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
 (Whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay 
 (Whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold on me 
 (Whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
 (No) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go 
 (Go) 
 I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
 (Whoa) 
 Is drug's really gotta hold on me 
 That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all 
 Wallow and drown in your sorrow 
 And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again 
 What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it 
 And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and what's a little fight 
 Tomorrow you'll be boys again 
 It's your life, live it however you wanna 
 Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up? 
 It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin' 
 'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin' 
 They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin 
 Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin 
 But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do 
 Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you 
 If I could take it all back now I wouldn't 
 I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't 
 But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded and graduated 
 To better drugs and updated 
 But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do 
 I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew 
 But when it's all said and done before I know it 
 I'll be forty wit a 40 on the porch tellin' stories 
 With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap 
 Babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin' shmashed 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
 (Whoa) 
 Someone keeps pullin on my sleeve 
 (Whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay 
 (Whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold on me 
 (Whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
 (No) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go 
 (Go) 
 I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
 (Whoa) 
 Is drug's really gotta hold on me 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
 (Whoa) 
 Someone keeps pullin on my sleeve 
 (Whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay 
 (Whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold on me 
 (Whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
 (No) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go 
 (Go) 
 I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
 (Whoa) 
 Is drug's really gotta hold on me 
 Drugs really gotta hold on me 
 Really got a hold on me 
 Drugs really gotta hold on me 
 They really got a hold on me
