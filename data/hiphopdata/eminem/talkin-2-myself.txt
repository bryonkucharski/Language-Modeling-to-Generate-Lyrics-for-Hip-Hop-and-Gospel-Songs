Hey yo 
 Before I start this song, man 
 I just want to thank everybody for being so patient 
 Snd bearing with me over these last couple of years 
 Ehile I figure this shit out 
 Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself 
 No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from 
 Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself 
 It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy 
 Woah, woah, woah, woah 
 So why in the world do I feel so alone 
 Nobody but me, I'm on my own 
 Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel 
 If there is then let me hear 
 Just so I know that I'm not the only one 
 I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes 
 But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains 
 Hatred was flowin' through my veins 
 On the verge of goin' insane 
 I almost made a song dissin' 
 Lil Wayne 
 It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin' 
 I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' 
 And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then could have got it 
 Almost went at 
 Kanye 
 too, God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic 
 Thank God that I didn't do it 
 I'da had my ass handed to me and I knew it 
 But Proof isn't here to see me through it 
 I'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryin' to talk myself into it 
 Are you stupid, you gon' start dissin' people for no reason? 
 'Specially when you can't even write a decent punch line even 
 You're lyin' to yourself, your slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health 
 Is declining with your self-esteem, your crying out for help 
 Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself 
 No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from 
 Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself 
 It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy 
 So why in the world do I feel so alone 
 Nobody but me, I'm on my own 
 Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel 
 If there is then let me hear 
 Just so I know that I'm not the only one 
 Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow 
 All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathin' and hollow 
 Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow 
 My sorrow echos in this hall though (oh-oh-whoa) 
 But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else 
 (I guess I keep talkin' to myself) 
 But all these other rappers suck is all that I know 
 I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado 
 But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto 
 He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled 
 Inside him, one foot on the break, one on the throttle 
 Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of 
 McDonald's 
 But instead of feelin' sorry for yourself, do somethin' bout it 
 Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted 
 Long enough, it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby 
 Quit worryin' about what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy 
 Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself 
 No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from 
 Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself 
 It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy 
 So why in the world do I feel so alone 
 Nobody but me, I'm on my own 
 Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel 
 If there is then let me hear 
 Just so I know that im not the only one 
 So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned 
 Hit my bottom so hard, I bounced twice, suffice this time around 
 It's different, them last two albums didn't count 
 Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' em out 
 I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around 
 I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down 
 So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal 
 I feel like me again, let me formally 
 Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know 
 The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no 
 Signs of slowin' up, oh, and I'm blowin' up all over 
 My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over, homos 
 I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep your head up 
 T.I. 
 keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up, don't let up 
 Just keep slayin' em, rest in peace to 
 DJ AM 
 'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um 
 Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself 
 No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from 
 Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself 
 It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy 
 So why in the world do I feel so alone 
 Nobody but me, I'm on my own 
 Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel 
 If there is then let me hear 
 Just so I know that I'm not the only one 
 So there it is, damn 
 It feels like I just woke up or something 
 I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man 
 Hey yo, and to anybody that I thought about going at 
 It was never nothin' personal; it was jus' some shit I was going through 
 And to everybody else... I'm back, heh
