Its its its its its... murda! 
 Wait stop the questions please 
 I've been on my knees 
 Beggin these disease 
 To stop from killin' these 
 Messed up cronic crease 
 Of the diseased 
 Uh oh 
 Letz go slow 
 On the radio low 
 Down south where they know 
 How it's gonna be 
 I said its murda (murda!) 
 To me 
 I don't need no ****in c 
 (Reapeat chorus) 
 Reapeat the laws 
 Dynamite flaws 
 All over yaws 
 Dis ting ain't no joke 
 Just go slow 
 To the hip hop show 
 Uh oh uh oh 
 Datz it for me 
 But wait till ya see 
 What's next for the 
 Slim shady
