Okay, how do I say this? (fack, fack, fack) 
 Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year) 
 2018, welp (fack, fack) 
 Yeah, I'm a fucking kamikaze crashing into everything 
 You beat me Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing 
 I've been going for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert 
 Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter 
 Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass 
 I'll ride through your cul-de-sac 
 Window cracked bumpin' your reference tracks 
 You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps 
 Overstayed my welcome 
 Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat 
 So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it 
 While I T-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it 
 Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment 
 Headed right at opponents and I'm the fucking pilot that flown it 
 I'm 'bout to 
 Smash into everyone, crash into everything 
 Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 I'm a Kamikaze, gonna 
 Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15 
 Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 I'm a Kamikaze, gonna 
 I turned on rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't 
 From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I wasn't 
 Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by 
 Dre's Frankenstein, energized like a nine volt 
 Ice cold like Snake Eyes, buy some rope on a dice roll 
 But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though 
 Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh) 
 Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note 
 Here come the guys in white coats tryna stop me 
 'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes 
 'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone 
 I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go 
 Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to 
 Smash into everyone, crash into everything 
 Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 I'm a Kamikaze, gonna 
 Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15 
 Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 Fack, fack on everyone 
 I'm a Kamikaze, gonna 
 Smash 
 Kamikaze, kamikaze 
 Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze 
 Look at what I've done 
 I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing 
 There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee 
 That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it 
 Shit's embarrassing, is me rear ending Terreri Bear 
 In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher 
 Each nut is the chair with [?] beware 
 Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared 
 Richard Ramirez is here 
 Serially killing every therapist, is it- 
 Wait, wait, got the eeriest feeling something evil is lurking 
 I'm no conspiracy theorist but something here is afoot 
 Oh yeah, it's my dick 
 Get the measurement stick (what) 
 Twelve inches of wood 
 Wait, but I've been going for your jugular like Craig G Duck Alert 
 And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked 
 Other words, you get laid to rest 
 And I hope your butt is hurt 
 Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book 
 You got some views, but you're still below me 
 Mine are higher so when you compare our views, you get overlooked 
 And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook 
 And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth 
 And you know I've always spoke the truth 
 You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth 
 And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do 
 When I say I can't wait till I get ahold of you 
 And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do 
 Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot
