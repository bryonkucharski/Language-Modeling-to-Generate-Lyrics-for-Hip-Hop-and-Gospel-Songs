Going back to the corner where I first saw you, 
 Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move, 
 Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand, 
 Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am, 
 Some try to hand me money they don't understand, 
 I'm not... broke I'm just a broken hearted man, 
 I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do, 
 How can I move on when I'm still in love with you... 
 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
 And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
 Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
 And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. 
 So I'm not moving... 
 I'm not moving. 
 Policeman says son you can't stay here, 
 I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year, 
 Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows, 
 If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go. 
 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
 And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
 Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
 And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. 
 So I'm not moving... 
 I'm not moving. 
 I'm not moving... 
 I'm not moving. 
 People talk about the guy 
 Who's waiting on a girl... 
 Oohoohwoo 
 There are no holes in his shoes 
 But a big hole in his world... 
 Hmmmm 
 And maybe I'll get famous as man who can't be moved, 
 And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news, 
 And you'll come running to the corner... 
 'Cause you'll know it's just for you 
 I'm the man who can't be moved 
 I'm the man who can't be moved... 
 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
 And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
 Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
 And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. 
 (Repeat in background) 
 So I'm not moving... 
 I'm not moving. 
 I'm not moving... 
 I'm not moving. 
 Going back to the corner where I first saw you, 
 Gonna camp in my sleeping bag not I'm not gonna move.
