In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above 
 I want this hand in its rightful glove 
 Have people saying god damn she's fine 
 Me responding with damn right she's mine 
 Even though you're gone, I try and carry on 
 Its sad but its true, me and you 
 Were through 
 But people still think they know us and they don't know shit 
 But I want you to know I'm sorry and I still love you britt 
 But now I've come to see, our destiny will never fit 
 And that's why now I look back being once lost then found 
 It's getting tougher with you not around 
 Your the only thing that got me to smile 
 I guess our love was a truthful denile 
 Sometimes I remenice at what we had 
 Not knowin' I was causing my baby to be sad 
 I never once tried to cause you this pain 
 Its crazy how one person can make you go insane 
 Ill admit me and you we had our bad times 
 We fought, yeah but people act like it's a fuckin' crime 
 No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit 
 All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt 
 But its sad cause the image I portray the pieces don't fit 
 All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me 
 But I wish people could see, how much I'm so crazy 
 In love with you, its true I wish it was still me and you 
 Doin' what we use to do, I wish they really knew 
 And I wish theyd know id never let anything bad happened to you 
 I got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest 
 But times were tough, and shit got rough 
 Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought 
 But just know britt my rhymes are true 
 Britt please know ill forever Love you 
 It just sucks cause there's a few out there that got Nems back 
 People always tellin' me get your fuckin' life on track 
 But in order to do that I need you back 
 And that's why you don't know what you got till its gone 
 I'm so sorry that our love was always off and on...
