Check check, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 
 (It's rolling) 
 Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here 
 Y'all know what this is 
 It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap 
 Def Jam Records giving it to you baby 
 Yo Eminem, show these mother fuckers what time it is baby 
 I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit 
 Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet 
 Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it 
 I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident 
 I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam 
 I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching and can't lock it 
 So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets 
 The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it 
 Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it 
 My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication 
 But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? 
 (Come on) 
 Anyway I got down with Dre 
 (What up?) 
 The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray 
 Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the Police" 
 When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth 
 (Fucking baby) 
 Became a role model after Colorado 
 Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo 
 Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public 
 Suck my dick, bitch 
 I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't 
 'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place 
 So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image 
 You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative 
 (Wanna Fight?) 
 I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking 
 Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket 
 So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling 
 A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does 
 I ain't buzzed, I'm juss high on life 
 So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites? 
 Motherfuckers, Slim Shady 
 Dr. Dre 
 I'm drunk pass the tec 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on 
 Off and on, Dr. Dre is on 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on 
 Off and on, Dr. Dre is on 
 The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire 
 I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron 
 Psych I'm just joking for Christ sake 
 Don't get so bent out of shape 
 'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends 
 Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me 
 'Cause they don't know better 
 They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up 
 And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up 
 My mind's got a mind of it's own 
 Sometimes I can't find it at home it hides in the stove 
 (Hello, where you at?) 
 Shit, talk about your brain being baked 
 My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades 
 Hailey Jade, daddy loves you, baby 
 Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter, fuck you lady 
 You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize 
 Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes 
 The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing 
 And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit 
 I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth 
 And shove his head in the fan blade 
 Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say 
 Or change cause of the age range in my fan base 
 Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit 
 Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit 
 Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now 
 It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now 
 But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it 
 But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent 
 Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude 
 And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon 
 I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge 
 I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on 
 Off and on, Dr. Dre is on 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on 
 Off and on, Dr. Dre is on 
 Fuck that, turn that shit off 
 Let's get the fuck out of here 
 You know how we do
