 So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit 
 'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick 
 Eminem and Swifty: 
 Two pills I pop till my pupils swell up like two pennies 
 I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties 
 A young ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back 
 Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants 
 I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin' 
 Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him 
 I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost 
 Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls 
 I light a candle and place it up on the mantle 
 Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle 
 So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurting (Bitch it's too late) 
 'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains 
 Swifty: 
 I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator 
 Degrading, creating murders to kill haters 
 Accused for every crime known through the equator 
 They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators 
 My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and 
 I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face 
 With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose 
 You never hear me say forgive me 
 I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it 
 That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it 
 You hidin', I make the president get a facelift 
 Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets 
 Chilling in the lab wasted 
 I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic 
 Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site 
 And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight 
 Eminem: 
 So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit 
 'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit 
 'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick 
 Bizarre: 
 I'm a compulsive liar, setting my preacher on fire 
 Slashing your tires, flying down Fenkell and Meyers 
 Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired 
 Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire 
 (Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer? 
 Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor 
 (Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired 
 Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron 
 I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for letting the record skip 
 Letting the record skip, letting the record skip (Damn) 
 I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting 
 It's gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion 
 Some bitch asked for my autograph 
 I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed 
 I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam 
 All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom 
 Proof: 
 Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack 
 Weed laced with something, nigga pass that 
 In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats 
 At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats 
 BMI on publishing, get your ASCAP-ped 
 The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack 
 Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP 
 I don't need a platinum chain bitch, I snatch Shaq's 
 Born loser, half thief and half black 
 Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at 
 Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked 
 And found chopped up in a trash bag 
 Kuniva: 
 We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell 
 'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales 
 Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace 
 Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums 
 I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle 
 Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you 
 Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth 
 And it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it 
 I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers 
 Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers 
 Brigade barricade to bring the noise 
 While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys 
 If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo 
 A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo 
 I leave ya face leaking, run up in church 
 And smack the preacher while he's preaching, take a swing at the deacon 
 Kon Artis: 
 I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight 
 I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape 
 I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent 
 I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent 
 With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order 
 I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water 
 In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von 
 Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb 
 (Special delivery) I signed to a local label for fun 
 Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run 
 Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son 
 Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none 
 Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun 
 Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds 
 Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones 
 Till I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough 
 Eminem: 
 So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit 
 'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit 
 'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick 
 Ha ha, suck my motherfuckin' dick 
 D-12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen 
 Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands 
 Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis 
 The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady
