TV Presenter: 
 Hello boys and girls 
 Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships 
 Do you have a daddy? 
 I'll bet you do 
 *Door opens* 
 Who's your daddy? 
 Hailie: 
 Daddy, what're you doing? 
 Eminem: 
 Haha 
 Eminem & Hailie: 
 Ok then! everybody, listen up 
 Eminem: 
 I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me? 
 Hailie: 
 Somebody, please help him 
 *giggle* 
 I think my dad gone crazy 
 There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high 
 No plane that I can't learn how to fly 
 What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you 
 There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to 
 Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls 
 I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar 
 Inside of a hall with my framed autograph 
 Sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall 
 I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off 
 All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off 
 Dr Dre: 
 Suck it Marshall 
 Eminem: 
 Tell laura and her husband to back off 
 Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off 
 And launch one of these russians and that's all 
 Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map off 
 We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off 
 *Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby 
 Hailie: 
 My dad's lost it 
 There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 It's like my mother always told me 
 *Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine 
 N goddamit, you little motherfucker 
 If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin' 
 Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch 
 Eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick 
 A million motherfuckin' cocks per second 
 I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record 
 I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy 
 And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring 
 In my nose then quit bringin' my flows 
 Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why I'm so mean? 
 If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O 
 I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo 
 Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more 
 Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? 
 Hailey: 
 Dad 
 There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie 
 (I think my dad gone crazy) 
 My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise 
 And at the same time, make you dry your eyes 
 With the same rhyme, so what you're seeing is a genius at work 
 Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter 
 Pret it at first, cuz when I speak, it's tongue in cheek 
 I'd yank my fuckin' teeth 
 Before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums 
 Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once 
 And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son 
 And walk around the rest of my life spit on 
 And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung 
 Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump 'n Grind comes on 
 More pain inside o' my brain 
 Than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane 
 Aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave 
 Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade 
 And that's pretty much the gist of it 
 Parents are pissed, but the kids love it 
 Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers 
 I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither 
 There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it 
 "(I think my dad gone crazy)" 
 A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe 
 "(I think my dad gone crazy)" 
 There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
 "(I think my dad gone crazy)" 
 There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie 
 "(I think my dad gone crazy)" 
 Crazy 
 You're funny daddy
