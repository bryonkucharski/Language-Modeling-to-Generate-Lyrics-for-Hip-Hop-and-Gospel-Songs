You probably gonna think that I'm talking about you and you goddamn right I am 
 Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you 
 Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct 
 Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink 
 He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink 
 He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he? 
 Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me 
 I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky 
 And is no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone is he? 
 This bitch really thinks she can get me 
 If she still wants me, driving across country 
 Strapped him to the front seat, missing all the front teeth 
 Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me? 
 I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once 
 And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk 
 Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball 
 Bunched up nice and comfy 
 Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me 
 You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch 
 You thought you had me, till my shrink told me this 
 The problem is all inside your head she said to me 
 The answer is easy if you take it logically 
 I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free 
 There must be 50 ways to leave your lover 
 I feel like a serial killer 
 I keep dumping bodies in the lake, I'ma get caught and send up the river 
 I shiver when I think of the company I keep 
 How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep 
 I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink 
 Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing 
 Was all better, she made me feel like a king 
 Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem 
 She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her 
 And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars 
 Accused me of doing drugs and screaming "holla" 
 Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana 
 And all I know is every time I go 
 To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow 
 The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke 
 That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago 
 And I wouldn't even let on like I know 
 What was I supposed to do, call her out on it, we just argue 
 Say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script 
 Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch 
 A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch 
 She thought she had me, till my shrink told me this 
 The problem is all inside your head she said to me 
 The answer is easy if you take it logically 
 I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free 
 There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
