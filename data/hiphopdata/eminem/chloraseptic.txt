Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah) 
 To the English language 
 With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper 
 This rap shit got me travellin' place to place 
 You barely leave your house 
 'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
 Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out 
 Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook 
 Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat 
 Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh 
 That's what it's like when the mic is out 
 'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it 
 Till your larynx and neck are split 
 With these lyrics, weapons, expert with 
 Like hair extensions, extra clips 
 And you're scared to effin' death of it 
 Bitch, you're starin' at a legend, that 
 In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped 
 And hoodie black, should be strapped 
 To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch 
 Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip 
 Like a barometric pressure switch 
 Carin' less who I offend with this 
 I'm at your neck like Pez dispense 
 Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch 
 I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic 
 And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with 
 This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit 
 I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah 
 And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you 
 All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do? 
 My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose 
 And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew 
 Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew) 
 Yeah, uh, and still conjoined at 
 The hip with hop, still on point and poignant 
 Skilled as Floyd is 
 In this field, and still no filter, boy 
 I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy 
 You still ain't in the building, boy 
 I will destroy shit, even as I build it 
 Get the drillbit, pen is filled with poison 
 Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it 
 (Like what?) Like a real thin joint it 
 (What?) Comes on Quilted Northern 
 (And what?) In a built-in toilet 
 (Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof) 
 I wouldn't heal with ointment 
 Way I'm kickin' these fairies tales 
 Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Million voices in my head 
 But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment 
 (Off what?) Off the feel of going in 
 (Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain 
 Like she thinks I'm dumb 
 Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come 
 Till I feel anointed 
 She makes iller noises 
 When she's with me, must be from the Windy City 
 Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me 
 'Cause I conned her into 
 Rippin' the condom in two (woo) 
 Dick is a bargaining tool 
 Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude 
 I go there, you wouldn't? 
 Well, I still have a few views in common with you 
 Just not YouTube, 'cause 
 I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic 
 And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with 
 This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit 
 I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah 
 You're a has-been 
 That has been the case since back when 
 You last went and threw your hat in the race 
 You've been trash, stick your raps in the trash bin 
 Or end up in my next rhyme 
 You're a fuckboy, so next time 
 It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant 
 With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah) 
 Now watch me set it like correct time 
 All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I 
 Clock rejects into the next life 
 Talkin' reckless, but it's just my 
 Strongest suit, but you can get my Columbian neck tie 
 Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride 
 Why you hitching at night? 
 I put an end to your life, sex crime 
 Kidding aside, insidious vibe 
 Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes 
 But all you're getting is bribe 
 Ending your life to try to get you inside 
 Then we gon' end up spending the night 
 And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe 
 What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck 
 Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up 
 Binds up, cuts, slices her twice? 
 But the muff diver must just like it rough 
 Fuck right in her vagina, blood 
 Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh 
 (Music, please) 
 Enthusiast of the roofie 
 Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi 
 And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi 
 But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen 
 Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG 
 I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee 
 No diss there, just notice there 
 Are no similarities that we share 
 Besides the fact we breathe air 
 Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried 
 The hatchet and patched it up 
 Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack 
 And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like 
 Chloraseptic, 'septic 
 And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with 
 This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit 
 I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah 
 And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you 
 All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do? 
 My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose 
 And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew 
 Somethin' to chew (somethin' to chew)
