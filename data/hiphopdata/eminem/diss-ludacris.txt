(Eminem) 
 Damn, why don't you ever go away, huh? 
 We need to stop this shit 
 And relize what you spit 
 It's meaningless garbage 
 To shake some ass and tits 
 Don't act like ur sick and imma gonna repect u 
 And leave hip hop alone 
 Go promote wack rap, Cool? 
 (Eminem) 
 When I turn on the radio, I get nauseous 
 Annoy your commercial garbage, And make sure I turn it off quick 
 U make me so sick, It's pointless to even diss 
 But I do it for the lute and MP3 page hiss 
 I try to teach kids 
 But their steady rocking, Eyes bopping heads to Ludacris 
 Swearing that he's nice, Come on he sounds like the newest sensation 
 To get the party dancing, And bitches asses shakin 
 Making hits faking quick, aching like you sick 
 I'll slap you with your own ryhme 
 O there's your greatest hit 
 Lazy kids with dope beats, And alot of blabling 
 In reality you get beat like Eric ? battleing 
 But it's not your fault completely 
 I blame promoters to, hyping up your CD when they got 34 interludes 
 Companies lute you, 'Cause ur making them lute 
 But when your one hit wares out, They'll drop you for good, your replaceable 
 Pretend you like Hip Hop, That's a no no! 
 Show your appreciation donate a Volvo 
 O no, That be to much to ask 
 Actin' like alaskins with that rented ice you flash 
 I'll come down to your street carrying burners 
 Now your block is hot! hot! 
 Like a heat contained thermos 
 Your nerves now 
 I see your eyes twitching, doing drags to females 
 Coming out sounding like bitches 
 Retards spitting disses 
 A bunch of carbincopyies 
 You must of failed the road test, Learning how to write beats 
 My street, only bumps but it's unreleashed 
 Fuck self reclamed kings of hip hop, There all weak 
 My ryhme shines brighter then any ice you rock 
 Ryhming in the hook 9 times, ? 
 Lame ducks running on stage with makeup, It's crazy to us 
 Real MC's take and get big cuts, Your finshed 
 Stop this shit 
 And relize what you spit 
 It's me and this garbage 
 Just shake some ass and tits 
 Don't act like ur sick and I'm gonna repect u 
 And leave hip hop alone 
 Go promote wack rap fool 
 Stop this shit 
 And relize what you spit 
 It's me and this garbage 
 Just shake some ass and tits 
 Don't act like ur sick and I'm gonna repect u 
 And leave hip hop for me 
 Go promote wack rap fool 
 Stop this shit 
 And relize what you spit 
 It's me and this garbage 
 Just shake some ass and tits 
 Don't act like ur sick you'll be out of fasion quick 
 Leave hip hop alone, you annoying piece of shit
