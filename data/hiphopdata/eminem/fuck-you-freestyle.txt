Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo 
 Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit 
 You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit 
 Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man 
 Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man 
 Talkin' about all that shit he be doin' 
 You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you 
 You don't do ecstasy, fuck you 
 You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you 
 If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you 
 I'm Nauseous in this place, I need some office 
 The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face 
 I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close 
 I can feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him 
 In ten seconds I'm go in to turn into Hulk Hogan 
 With a cigarette in his mouth 
 He tell me there's no smokin' 
 I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous 
 All I picture is kickin' his ass 
 When he's taken his ashes and flickin' 'em 
 I'm sick of these stamps 
 I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em 
 I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em 
 Aight Mr. Mathers pick 'em up 
 No you pick 'em, bitch, stick 'em up 
 Get against the wall, senior citizens and all 
 I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor 
 Get the door, close it and lock it 
 Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars 
 Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office 
 Fagget, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you 
 Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out 
 The goddamn garbage, fuck you 
 If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you 
 If you're a white rapper, fuck you 
 Talk shit about stretch your cool 
 But if you don't talk shit about stretch, fuck you 
 If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you 
 Talk shit about me, fuck you 
 You wanna battle me, fuck you 
 I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you
