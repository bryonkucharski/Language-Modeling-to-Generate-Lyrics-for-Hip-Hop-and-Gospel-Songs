Yeah 
 Trice 
 Statik Selektah 
 O back around the corner 
 Got the crack, put in your orders 
 We 'bout to run up out the stores 
 It's notorious, the way I got big spitting stories 
 Being me's X-Clan, Vanglorious 
 We're not your favorite, fuck it 
 You know the system and you buck it 
 Have you revisiting how you used to love it 
 A nigga spew through the music, acoustics, cool kid 
 Used to pursue excuses, truth is, I was truent in school 
 So its influence is foolish, that was my views 
 I'm back at it, the rap addict, by any means 
 We gon get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans 
 Say he ain't a star, niggas might be right 
 I'm so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight 
 Take it back Selektah, let 'em know it's Trice 
 Put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight 
 And I would like to introduce myse-self 
 Surprise! Hi, it's Ike 
 'Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply 
 Of wife beaters and my Nikes on 
 And a white tee over that Iron Mike 
 Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite 
 Come back as Spider-Man, Park my Peter inside a dyke 
 Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right 
 Had to pry her fingers off the motherfuckin' Breyer's ice cream 
 With the pliers, like "Ah!" 
 Only a ruthless bastard would do this 
 Take a toothles bitch with no taste buds to Ruth Chris 
 Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home 
 Pick up two Big Bufords 
 Girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plum stupid! 
 So when I pull up in that Benz 
 Don't try to pretend you ain't interested 
 To impress your stupid ass friends 
 And refuse to get in woman, and get slammed on the ground 
 And snap like a pool stick against cement 
 If you suck of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument 
 You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
 I can tell at first glance you're a ho 
 Cause your pants are so tight 
 When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode 
 So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco 
 Boy I'm from Detroit city, you livin' in animosity 
 That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity 
 Look where these random thoughts get me 
 In senseless mind babble, "What me? Apologize? labrbrr" 
 That's just the way the rhyme unravels 
 And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled! 
 Just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick 
 It's also Richard 'cause I feel like you should 
 Pry your fucking mouth up off of it 
 I said just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick 
 You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick 
 When I hold my privates to your first clue 
 Sherlock, prick! Just call me Richard 
 That's my motives, jumpin' out them Rovers 
 All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas 
 Or Minnesota, did I mention soda? 
 When it's mixed with viola, watch my cup runneth over 
 Cut from a soldier 
 Them ho niggas disposable toaster 
 Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough 
 Being me till the credits roll 
 Till my condition is beyond what the medics know 
 They wanna edit O 
 Like a prosthetic third leg let it go 
 This is Shady 1.0 Em let 'em know 
 I still profit through the process 
 The prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress 
 I'm a dick that I brag about 
 I put it in fast and then I drag it out 
 World, I be your special friend see 
 Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo penis envy 
 Just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick 
 It's also Richard 'cause I feel like you should 
 Pry your fucking mouth up off of it 
 I said just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick 
 You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick 
 When I hold my privates to your first clue 
 Sherlock, prick! Just call me Richard
