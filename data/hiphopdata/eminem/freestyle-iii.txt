I Freestyle to make it worthwhile 
 Make you run the Geographical 8 mile 
 For paul monelly to fill his belly full of my jelly 
 Like Anderson with his square head and pork belly 
 Stop Dead, go ahead, infact, instead why don't you try a diet 
 You really should try it, get you fit, only eating a bit may do you some good. 
 Like Robin Hood, all he had was wood, maybe you should 
 Don't get depressed, take a blood test, ensure your sugar levels at its best 
 May I suggest?... 
 You take a leaf from kennys book, 
 Look him up, in the phone book, have a chat about doing comic books, 
 Your both freaks, take some fat from Andersons Cheeks and use some 
 He got plenty to spare 
 Kenny, arnt you aware of what you wear? 
 Which cause people to stare, at your blue pants? 
 Just Like your mothers implants. 
 I hate it when you say you down wit Dre, and eminem, 
 Anyone saying this shit, I'll have to condemn them 
 Leaving the hem line upon their shirt like a pervert that's tryna flirt 
 Beefing with me is like tryna fuck a dyke, it ain't possible 
 Ill leave you wishing you ain't even met me 
 Killing you is simple as reciting my 
 ABC, I gua-rantee you can only put up with me, to a tolerable degree. 
 This ryhmes sick I ain't spittin' 
 Tight as your wifes pussy my shit ain't fittin. 
 Eminems syllables sound too complex 
 His subjects are about objects or perplex. 
 I wrote two verse on one person, 
 This rhyme can only wearson. 
 I'm finished, 
 Oh, one more thing 
 Bring some string, for this swing and an anchor ring and a large srping. 
 And we'll murder them all 
 This ain't a tea ball, 
 It's a pub crawl, we've finished here it time to move along
