Oh my goodness! What have I done? 
 Oh no! I can't believe it 
 It's like... I've got the whole world in my palms 
 And I'm ready to (drop bombs) 
 Welcome to the Slim Shady mecca, Rebecca 
 It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca 
 It's my sector, homosexual dissector 
 Come again, rewind selector 
 I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector 
 So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya 
 Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya 
 I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya 
 They say once bitten and twice shy well I'm 
 Next to the guy with nine ecstasy pills and five extra 
 Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities why yes sir 
 I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser 
 It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester? 
 Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester 
 Performed a home abortion with Dexter than I guess I'll 
 Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her 
 I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in 
 I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends 
 All my west side bitches throw it up 
 Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up 
 Man I think that he just fell off the deep end sho' enough 
 So you better change the station to keep from throwing up 
 Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it 
 There's a penis on floor and two balls so you know who did it 
 You know you with it girl don't front oh no you didn't 
 I won't rape all the The Pussycat Dolls, Nicole you kidding? 
 I'll pee on Rihanna see man, I do what I wanna 
 Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy gluin' Madonna 
 To the lazy boy sofa fold her in two and sit on her 
 Imagine visual for that man who would've thought I 
 Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance 
 But the chick so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence 
 I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive 
 If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive 
 I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in 
 I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends 
 Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand 
 Kick it up and push him and lead him right in the quicksand 
 Here you need a hand big man? Grab hold of this branch 
 With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man 
 Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault 
 His name rhymes with so many different words geez 
 So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves 
 Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please 
 "Eminem I'm coming to kill you 
 I always hated you and I still do 
 You'll never fill my shoes my Superman costume 
 Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you 
 You're taking this shit too far 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Hang up my suit up in the armoire 
 Everyday I hate you more and more 
 Throw down the cardboard 
 Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore" 
 I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in 
 I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again 
 Let's begin, now hand me the pen 
 How should I begin it and where does it all end 
 My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends 
 The world is mine
