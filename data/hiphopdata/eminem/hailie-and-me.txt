 Slim shady is rock a bye bby 
 Shady is over never will rap again 
 If you want me too 
 You'll have to just leave me 
 There is one way you can actually complete me 
 Remember in mockingbird it was really sad 
 I tried to stop 
 But I was so mad trying to stop crying 'cause I couldn't see you no more then I got back to what was in store 
 I made my new choice 
 Can't help myself 
 I lo ve all of y'all and no body else 
 Shady is something 
 He is nothing I really can't help it 'cause he is nothing well seems like 1 and 2...

 I love the way you smile 
 You do nice things 
 When I come back home

 You're my everything 
 And everything is youwhen we stand close together 
 This is our stormy weather 
 I love the way you smile 
 I hate to play in 8 mile 
 Teach me how to love you better 
 So this could be a nice sunny weather 
 I love how you feel 
 And I know you keep it real 
 I'm furreal that I love you this is between 1 and 2
