Yo, follow me, come with me to the dark side of the force 
 No man would boldly go to this place 
 The devil only knows of this world 
 So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh 
 Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of 
 Mozart 
 Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't 
 Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart 
 Come with me to another side in a world, so cold and so dark 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 A world so dark, a world so cold 
 A world where only some will go 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 But none return, when will they learn 
 Where do they go, God only knows 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta 
 I enter Central Park, it's dark it's winter in December 
 I see my target put my car in park and approach a tender 
 Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend ta befriend her 
 Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl you mighta' 
 Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda' girl that I'd a- 
 -ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider 
 Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya 
 I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder 
 Impregnate a lesbian yeah now let's see her have triplets then I'll di- 
 -sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde- 
 -hyde and cyanide girl, you can try and hide you can try to scream louder 
 No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta 
 Murderin', I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the 
 Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh 
 Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull pull another one out uh 
 Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart 
 Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't 
 Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart

 So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me 
 There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me 
 But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy 
 It's makin' me play hide and seek like 
 Jason 
 , I'm so hungry 
 She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me 
 So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me 
 Pull the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see 
 So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound 'sleep 
 Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me? 
 He's rapin' me she tries to scream somebody please get him off me 
 He's tapin' me he's bitin' me he's laughing like it's funny 
 She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratching like some dumb freak 
 Escaping me no dice you see I might just be 
 Ted Bundy 
 Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties 
 I'm crazy but its alright with me, man life can be so empty 
 Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat 
 Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart 
 Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't 
 Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart 
 Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 A world so dark, a world so cold 
 A world where only some will go 
 (Stay wide awake)

 Better try ta stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake 
 Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take 
 Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today 
 I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away 
 Now I use power tools, how 'bout now are you in the shower 
 Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets 
 How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya 
 Must have just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there 
 Prowler there's no one fouler, bound ya that's how they found ya 
 Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya 
 Such nostalgia and power, such prowess look how ya cower 
 Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars 
 Jabba the Hutt, beddy bye-bye beddy bye-bye it's time to die-die 
 Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matta' 
 Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya 
 Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water 
 Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand 
 Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe 
 Fun ta act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that 
 What was that? Dial 9-1-1 someone's comin' in from the back 
 Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart 
 Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't 
 Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart 
 Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 A world so dark, a world so cold 
 A world where only some will go 
 (Stay wide awake) 
 But none return, when will they learn 
 Where do they go, God only knows 
 (Stay wide awake)
