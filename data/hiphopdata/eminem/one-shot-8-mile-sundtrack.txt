Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
 To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment 
 Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo 
 His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
 There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
 He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
 To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
 What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
 He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now 
 The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW! 
 Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity 
 Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad 
 But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it 
 He knows his whole back's to these ropes 
 It don't matter, he's dope 
 He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant that he knows 
 When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
 Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody 
 He better go capture this moment and hope it don't colapse on him 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping 
 This world is mine for the taking, make me king 
 As we move toward a, new world order 
 A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortar 
 It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
 He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
 Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter 
 Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home 
 He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
 But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
 These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product 
 They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
 He nose dove and sold nada 
 So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner 
 But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
 Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged 
 I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
 I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
 But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher 
 Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
 All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
 That I can't get by with my nine to five 
 And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers 
 And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer 
 This is my life, and these times are so hard 
 And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
 Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
 Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna 
 Stay in one spot, another day of monotony 
 Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail 
 I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
 Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not 
 Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go 
 I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
 So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not 
 This may be the only opportunity that I got 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
 You own it, you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
 You can do anything you set your mind to, man
