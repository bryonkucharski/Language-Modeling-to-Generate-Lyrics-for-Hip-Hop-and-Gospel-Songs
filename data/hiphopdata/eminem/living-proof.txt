Don't stop 
 Don't stop 
 (Royce Da 5' 9") 
 Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK) 
 We bout to get into a tale of gunner that details the dungeon 
 This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering 
 Oh once again where I fail from blundering 
 Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it 
 Now I'm freefallin' 
 My career is gone and the weed callin' 
 Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin' 
 God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth 
 Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse 
 I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me 
 'Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers 
 I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges 
 The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z 
 Suddenly everybody calls 
 "Like I'm just checking on you dog" 
 While I throw up this message on the star 
 When them bottles stop poppin' 
 And them dollars start stopping 
 Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop) 
 I made a promise to my momma 
 I'mma out live her 
 How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop (don't stop) 
 I'm living proof nigga 
 Its pretty safe to say 
 God giveth and God taketh away 
 It's the Worldwide American way 
 I'm living proof nigga 
 (Eminem) 
 Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone 
 Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on 
 You just gone sit there and take it or make 'em suck it 
 Tell 'em where to shove it straight up, 
 You gon' make love to the world?or you gon' 
 Fuck it?, 
 The last time that life kicked me in the ass 
 I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass 
 Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy 
 And not open a can of whoop ass 
 Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I ain't poop 
 Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot 
 I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group 
 Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop 
 You haters look like you ate a grape fruit 
 You see me climbing back on that wagon 
 Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it 
 Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em 
 Without remorse man 
 Man of course I'm a one trick pony 
 'Cause I'll be screaming on these whores till I'm hoarse! 
 When them bottles stop poppin' 
 And them dollars start stopping 
 Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop) 
 I made a promise to my momma 
 I'mma out live her 
 How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop (don't stop) 
 I'm living proof nigga 
 Its pretty safe to say 
 God giveth and God taketh away 
 It's the Worldwide American way 
 I'm living proof nigga 
 (Royce Da 5' 9") 
 Nah I ain't fading yet 
 I'd rather stay and rap 
 I mighta made a deck 
 I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next 
 So I don't stay in debt 
 Me broke 
 You might as well cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby 
 With AK's with baby bayonet's 
 I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying 
 That's why its either kill or be killed 
 So call me suicide homocide Ryan 
 (Eminem) 
 There's a bomb inside my head 
 I'ma live wire, I am on the edge 
 Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike 
 Get on a nut like a tire iron 
 I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll 
 That's how much on fire I am 
 Rappers are fun and I'm the time 'cause I'm just flying by 'em 
 Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up? 
 Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up 
 So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up 
 When them bottles stop poppin' 
 And them dollars start stopping 
 Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop) 
 I made a promise to my momma 
 I'mma out live her 
 How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop (don't stop) 
 I'm living proof ni- 
 Its pretty safe to say 
 God giveth and God taketh away 
 It's the Worldwide American way 
 I'm living proof ni-
