Now everybody from the 313 
 Put your muthafukin' hands up and follow me 
 Everybody from the 313 
 Put your muthafukin' hands up, look, Look 
 Now while he stands tough 
 Notice that this man did not have his hands up 
 This free worlds got you all gassed up 
 Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
 1, 2, 3 into the 4 
 1pac, 2pac, 3pac, 4 
 4pac, 3pac, 2pac, 1 
 Your pac, he's pac, your pac none 
 This guy ain't no muthafukin' MC 
 I know everything he's got to say against me 
 I am white, I am a fukin' bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom 
 My boy future is an Uncle Tom 
 I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob 
 Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun 
 I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps 
 And Wink did fuck my girl 
 I'm still standin' here sayin' 
 'Fuck the free world' 
 Don't ever try to judge me dude 
 You don't know wat the fuck I've been through 
 But I know somethin' about you 
 You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school 
 Wat's the matter Dogg? You embarrassed? 
 This guy's a gangsta, his real name's Clarence 
 And Clarence lives at home with both parents 
 And Clarence parents have a real good marriage 
 This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook 
 'Cause there's no such thing as half-way crooks 
 He's scared to death, he's scared to look 
 In his fuckin' year book, fuck Cranbrook 
 Fuck the beat, I go a Capella 
 Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody 
 Fuck y'all if you doubt me 
 I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash, I say it proudly 
 Fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie 
 Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me
