I've been a liar, been a thief 
 Been a lover, been a cheat 
 All my sins need holy water 
 Feel it washing over me 
 Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something 
 If all it's gonna cause is pain 
 Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain 
 So let the river run 
 He's coming home with his neck scratched, to catch flack 
 Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch 
 On his breath's Jack is a sex addict 
 And she just wants to exact revenge and get back 
 It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack 
 She's kept track of all his Internet chats 
 And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next? 
 Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks 
 'Cause she loves danger, psychopath 
 And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that 
 But she's devised some plan 
 To stab him in the back, knife in hand 
 Says the relationship's hanging by a strand 
 So she's been on the web lately 
 Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man 
 And I know she's using me to try to play him 
 I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Susanne" 
 After the first night, but tonight I am 
 I've been a liar, been a thief 
 Been a lover, been a cheat 
 All my sins need holy water 
 Feel it washing over me 
 Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something 
 If all it's gonna cause is pain 
 Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain 
 So let the river run 
 One-night stand, turned into night staying 
 He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and 
 He found out, now she feels deserted and used 
 'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too 
 Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through? 
 It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued 
 And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth 
 Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you 
 So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners 
 Don't have to be reserved in a booth 
 I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's 
 Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew 
 And now that I got you I don't want you 
 Took advantage of my thirst to pursue 
 Why do I do this dirt that I do? 
 Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech 
 Detergent and bleach is burning the wound 
 'Cause now with her in the womb 
 We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew 
 To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit 
 Fuck 
 I've been a liar, been a thief 
 Been a lover, been a cheat 
 All my sins need holy water 
 Feel it washing over me 
 Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something 
 If all it's gonna cause is pain 
 Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain 
 So let the river run 
 My name's (oh), my name's (oh) 
 Denver (oh), river run 
 Call me (oh), call me (oh) 
 River (oh), we'll let the river run 
 Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey 
 Fuck can I say? If life was a highway 
 The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes 
 Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe 
 That's why I may have came at you sideways 
 I can't keep my lies straight 
 What I made you terminate, my baby 
 This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled 
 What else can I say? It was fun for a while 
 Bet I really woulda loved your smile 
 Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it 
 What's one more lie to tell an unborn child? 
 I've been a liar, been a thief 
 Been a lover, been a cheat 
 All my sins need holy water 
 Feel it washing over me 
 Oh, little one (I'm sorry) 
 I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up) 
 If all it's gonna cause is pain 
 The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain 
 So let the river run
