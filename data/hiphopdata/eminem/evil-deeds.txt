spoken: 
 Lord please forgive me for what I do, 
 For I know not what I've done. 
 Father please forgive me for I know not what I do 
 I just never had the chance to ever meet you 
 Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be 
 My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds 
 Mama had a baby and it's head popped off, head popped off 
 Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off 
 My mama don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off 
 Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off 
 Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch 
 Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch 
 But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn 
 Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn 
 Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna 'n' Charles 
 Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles 
 They were the ones who were left in charge 
 My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song 
 Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song 
 It went a little something like Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb 
 Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn 
 Mama why do they keep saying this, I just don't understand, understand 
 And by the way, where's my dad 
 Father please forgive me for I know not what I do 
 I just never had the chance to ever meet you 
 Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be 
 My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds 
 Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly 
 Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me 
 Where does that leave me, well I guess that I'm between predominantly 
 Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream 
 While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like a comedian to you 
 Do you think that I'm kidding, what do I look like some kind of idi... 
 Wait a minute shit, don't answer that, why am I so misunderstood 
 Why do I go through so much bullshit, it such bullshit 
 Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again, whining about his millions and 
 His mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in 
 From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad 
 And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it 
 Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it 
 I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard 
 Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it 
 Man if I only had half of it, if you only knew the half of it 
 Father please forgive me for I know not what I do 
 I just never had the chance to ever meet you 
 Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be 
 My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds 
 Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds, please release me 
 From these demons, I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe 
 I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry 
 Now look at all the pain I caused, this Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again 
 What did I do that was so bad to deserve this, everything could have been so perfect 
 But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air 
 Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere 
 I don't even know what to feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel 
 And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel 
 Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round 
 Here we go now, do si do now, curtains up, the show must go now 
 Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now 
 But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be 
 Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be 
 So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on 
 Till I pass 
 50 
 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone 
 Father please forgive me for I know not what I do 
 I just never had the chance to ever meet you 
 Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be 
 My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds 
 I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do 
 I just never had the chance to ever meet you 
 Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be 
 My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds 
 Oh! 
 Last one, baby... 
 Let's go... 
 Detroit!
