(Rabbit) 
 Now everybody from the 313 
 Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me 
 Everybody from the 313 
 Put your mother fucking hands up¦look, look 
 Now while he stands tough 
 Notice that this man did not have his hands up 
 This free world's got you gassed up 
 Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
 1, 2, 3 and to the 4 
 1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4 
 4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1 
 You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none 
 This guy ain't no mother-fuckin' MC, 
 I know everything he's got to say against me, 
 I am white, I am a fucking bum 
 I do live in a trailor with my mom 
 My boy Future is an Uncle Tom. 
 I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob 
 Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun, 
 I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps 
 And Wink did fuck my girl 
 I'm still standin here screamin "F**K THE FREE WORLD!" 
 Don't never try to judge me dude 
 You don't know what the fuck I've been through 
 But I know something about you 
 You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school 
 What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed? 
 This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence 
 And Clarence lives at home with both parents 
 And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage 
 This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks' 
 He's scared to death, he's scared to look 
 In his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook 
 Fuck a beat, I go a cappella 
 Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailor, fuck everybody 
 Fuck y'all if you doubt me 
 I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly 
 And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie, 
 Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.
