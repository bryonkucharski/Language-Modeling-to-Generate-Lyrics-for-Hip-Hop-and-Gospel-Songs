Eminem has a line full of chainsaws 
 Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem 
 Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper…Eminem 
 Who can say fore sure? 
 Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer 
 If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use 
 Society would reap a great benefit 
 I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets 
 on who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes 
 Fuck f-fuck fuck, can't take the stress 
 I make a mess as the day progresses 
 Angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges 
 Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches 
 With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges 
 Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this 
 Mess and make the best of this situation, I guess 
 'Cause I feel like a little bitch this predicament's despicable 
 I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous 
 I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy 
 This kid just took my stick of licorice 
 And threw my sticker books in a picker bush 
 I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook 
 This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook 
 He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book 
 Now there's using your head 
 Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous 
 A brain you'd be dangerous" 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous 
 And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 I'mma use my head as a weapon 
 Find a way to escape this insaneness 
 (Mama always said) 
 "Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous" 
 Guess it pays to be brainless 
 Fast forward some years later, a teenager, this is a fun, sweet 
 I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete 
 It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished 
 They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stumped me 
 But how do you get the shit beat out of you be down and be upbeat 
 When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life 
 Chance to make it or succeed 
 'Cause you're doomed from the start 
 It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street 
 But if I had just get my head out my ass 
 I could accomplish any task 
 Practicing trash talking in a trance 
 Locked in my room yeah, but I got some plans mama 
 These damn rhymes are falling 
 Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it 
 And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure 
 I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before 
 Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that 
 Threw my first punch, end of story 
 Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void 
 Been using it more as a bin for storage 
 Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge 
 Syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword 
 Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board 
 A bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore 
 Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain 
 Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head 
 Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't 
 'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer 'cause mama always said 
 Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous 
 A brain you'd be dangerous" 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous 
 And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 I'mma use my head as a weapon 
 Find a way to escape this insaneness 
 (Mama always said) 
 "Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous" 
 Guess it pays to be brainless 
 Now my mum goes “womp womp womp” 
 'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb 
 I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped 
 But somehow, I came out on top 
 I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo 
 I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold 
 Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go' 
 I'm 'bout to clean house, yo 
 I'm Lysol, now I'm just household 
 Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out 
 Middle America, hear them yell out 
 Until they were so scared, and those kids 
 Just about, belted out 
 Whatever spout that it fell out 
 Of my smart-aleck mouth, it was so weird 
 Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it 
 Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as 
 Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah, till then 
 Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards 
 It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers 
 Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius 
 Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah 
 You motherfuckin' 
 (insert insult here) 
 Who the fuck would've thought that one little lone MC 
 Would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it 
 And boy did they flock 
 Can't believe this little hick locked 
 This Hip Hop shit in his hip pocket 
 And still the shit got that 
 White trash traffic and gridlock 
 Shit hopping like a six blocks from a Kid Rock 
 Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-October 
 And God forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog 
 'Cause I turn into the Unabomber mama always said 
 Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous 
 A brain you'd be dangerous" 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous 
 And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
 (Mama could be wrong) 
 I'mma use my head as a weapon 
 Find a way to escape this insaneness 
 (Mama always said) 
 "Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous" 
 Guess it pays to be brainless 
 Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck 
 Neither is ain't
