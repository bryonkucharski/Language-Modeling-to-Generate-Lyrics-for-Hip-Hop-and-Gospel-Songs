It's like that Eminem, Eminem all right bust it 
 It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns 
 And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord 
 Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board 
 And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford 
 But I'm more toward dropping an acapela 
 To chop a fella to mozerella 
 Worse than a helicopter propeller 
 Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing 
 Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya 
 Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death 
 With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet 
 Pumpin you full of drugs 
 Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs 
 So were picked up in an ambulance and driven 
 To receiving with their asses ripped out of their pants 
 And given a less than 20 percent chance of livin' 
 Have a possible placement as a hospital patient 
 Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement 
 Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!" 
 Drivin' a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp 
 And pullin your adam's apple out through your mouth 
 Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist 
 To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment
