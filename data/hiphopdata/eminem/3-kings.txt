Yeah, classic hip hop shit 
 Dr. D-R-E 
 Rozay and Jay, let's get 'em 
 We started out moppin' floors 
 And now we front row at the awards 
 Number one for the last twenty years 
 If you real mothafucka scream cheers! (cheers, cheers) 
 Mothafucka scream cheers! (cheers, cheers) 
 Yeah and it is what it is 
 He wanted to shine at the swap meet 
 Till the white boys got him in that hot seat 
 I only love it when her hair long 
 You should listen to this beat through my headphones 
 Money long, number one twenty years strong 
 Fuck a gym, I am him, Andre Young 
 G5's to 6-4s, Dre got 'em 
 If the bitch bad I got her in red bottoms 
 Great weed, nice homes, bread proper 
 Tec nine, one chamber, top shotta 
 Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter 
 Born broke, real nigga straight out of Compton 
 The fuck you magazine niggas want from me? 
 I rewrote the game, nigga, now talk money 
 All black on my Al Capone shit 
 I built a house, nigga get your own shit 
 I only love it when her hair long 
 You should listen to this beat through my headphones 
 See y'all niggas 
 Hit the switches on that shit one time, huh 
 Let the top down 
 I came a long way from the weed game 
 Twenty stack seats at the Heat game 
 And I'm still strapped with the heat man 
 And we steppin' on a nigga feet man 
 80 pair of sneakers came from the D game 
 Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing 
 Brown bag money in a duffle bag 
 Fuck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back 
 The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen 
 On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition 
 Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition 
 Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol 
 I only love her when the ass fat 
 We should listen to this track in my Maybach 
 I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire 
 Come and suck a dick for a millionaire 
 Uh, it's just different 
 I know it feels different 
 Uh, I only love her if her eyes brown 
 Play this shit while you play around with my crown 
 King H-O, y'all should know by now 
 But if you don't know, uh 
 Millions on the wall in all my rooms 
 Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room 
 Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks 
 Banksy bitches, Basquiat 
 I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me 
 They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two hundred fifty 
 I'm holdin' out for three 
 Two seventy five and I just might agree 
 Ex-D-boy, used to park my beamer 
 Now look at me, I can park in my own arena 
 I only love her if her weave new 
 I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do? 
 Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM 
 Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem 
 Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet 
 Robin Williams shit, I deserve a golden globe bitch! 
 I take a Ace in the meanwhile 
 You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle 
 Fuck rap money, I've made more off crates 
 Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes 
 Close the curtains, fuck boy, out my face 
 I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case 
 Murder was the case that they gave me 
 I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me 
 Stuntin' to the max like wavy 
 Oh shit! 
 Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy 
 Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83 
 I don't even know if it was open then 
 I ain't know Oprah then 
 Have the XL 80 bike 
 Loud motor, they be like, "Damn!" when I'm comin' through, rang 
 Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late 
 You got all that, right? 
 I love this shit like my own daughter 
 Let's spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya 
 Young, this is just different
