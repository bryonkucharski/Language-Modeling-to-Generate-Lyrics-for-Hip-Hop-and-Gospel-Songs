The Armageddon Freestyle EMINEM 
 Fucker 
 Yeah 
 Oh shit, it's the evil genius 
 Green lantern 
 Yeah 
 A yo Em 
 Ha ha 
 What we call this shit right here 
 The invasion 
 You have part one you got part two now its 
 Part three 
 The final chapter mother fuckers 
 Armageddon, lets go 
 I got a riddle what's little and talks big 
 With midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle 
 That will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
 If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean 
 Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no 
 His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow 
 But that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe 
 Rappin' in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so 
 Either except it or you don't and lets move on 
 If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
 Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts 
 Keep walkin' around sniffin each others butts 
 Or should I say asses 
 What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses 
 Hold up hold up hold up 
 New york city man 
 It's the kid Lloyd Banks 
 And it you hearin what I'm hearin right now 
 You know this ain't no regular shit homy 
 This something special and we gotta bring this back 
 Green common 
 Countdown to armageddon 
 Lets go 
 I got a riddle what's little and talks big 
 With midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle 
 That will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
 If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean 
 Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no 
 His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow 
 But that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe 
 Rappin' in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo so 
 Either except it or you don't and lets move on 
 If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
 Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts 
 Keep walkin' around sniffin each others butts 
 Or should I say asses 
 What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses 
 The question I ask is 
 How can I explain this 
 How can I swing this in English language 
 If I switch to slang and turn man to man 
 Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain 
 Am I bein real or am I bein fake 
 Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
 Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter 
 I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya 
 I'm tell ya one me (a) gain this is the environment that I was brought up in 
 But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration 
 Or should I say or should I say shun 
 Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism 
 Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold 
 Like that of a man of seventy some years old 
 And it only gets colder which Is why I understand 
 And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan 
 With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine 
 And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again 
 Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown 
 Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down 
 In his new chair that goes round and round 
 That he bought from new money in his bank account 
 That I get him every issue when the thang comes out 
 Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out 
 And let his black side arm wrestle his white side 
 Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide 
 He might find someone dumb enough who might ride 
 But ain't nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black 
 There is no slack 
 Far heart for college great. In a fitted hat and a hunch back 
 Standin by the clearance coat rack 
 In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs 
 Yeah 
 Shady in the place to be c 
 And it takes what I got to rock the mic right 
 Still not gonna cater these punks 
 Fuckin' cocksuckin pussy lips haters dicks cunts
