 Music... Reality... Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. 
 But we as entertainers have a responsibility, to these kids... Psyche. 
 (Eminem:) 
 If I, were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow, 
 Would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter? 
 Could never be the lead-off batter 
 If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin' 
 But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake, 
 There's too much on my plate, I done came way 
 Too far in this game, to turn and walk away, 
 And not say what I got to say 
 What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack? 
 'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back 
 I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground, 
 'Fore I put some wack shit out 
 I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark, 
 Y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark 
 Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass, 
 Just twist me off see me leap out, pull a piece out 
 Fuck shootin', I'm just tryin' to knock his teeth out 
 Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle 
 Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap 
 Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that? 
 He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that 
 Man, I hate this crap 
 This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act, 
 When we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops 
 (Swifty:) 
 Ain't no getting' rid of McVeigh, if so you woulda tried, 
 The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide 
 I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies' 
 Crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish he 
 I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy, 
 Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef 
 I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently, 
 I'm not what you think 
 I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered 
 I can't stay away from a razor 
 I just want my face in a paper 
 I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres 
 I'll murder you, I gauge to have me turn into 
 A mad man, son of sam, bitch, I'm surgical 
 I'm allergic to dyin', you think not 
 You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops 
 (Kon Artis:) 
 I was happy havin' a deal at first 
 Thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse 
 It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog 
 And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls 
 And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends 
 Beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin' 
 When it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends 
 No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin 
 You think DAMN! When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car 
 And try to crawl with one arm 
 I'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol 
 If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call when the music stops 
 (Von:) 
 Let's see how many of your men loyal 
 When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil 
 I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust 
 Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed 
 Tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how you shouted, 
 Like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas 
 If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance 
 Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man 
 Death itself, it can hurt me 
 Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me 
 You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk, be smart 
 And stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark 
 Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life, 
 Fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife 
 Deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype, 
 Poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga you're a goner at night, when the music stops 
 (Proof:) 
 Instigators turn pits in cages, 
 Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors 
 Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk, 
 In the dark my dogs all bark like woof! 
 Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof 
 Caved in like reindeer hooves 
 Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose 
 The more y'all breath, shit, the more I moves 
 It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues 
 Put a gun to rap checkin' all our dues 
 Nigga, or make the news, betcha all y'all move 
 When the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop 
 (Bizarre:) 
 Music has changed my life in so many ways 
 Brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade 
 LL told me to rock the bells, 
 NWA said fuck the police, now I'm in jail 
 '93 was strictly R&B, 
 Fucked up haircut, listenin' to Jodeci 
 Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I ain't Mike? 
 Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight 
 Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack 
 Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back 
 MOP had me grimy and gritty, 
 Marilyn Manson, I died my hair blue and grew some titties 
 Ludacris told me to throw them bows 
 Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow 
 Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock 
 I'm reachin' for the glock, but the music stops...
