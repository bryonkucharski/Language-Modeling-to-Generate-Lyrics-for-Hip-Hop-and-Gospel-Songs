Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though 
 Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the nights show 
 To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business 
 Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird 
 To this day because alls I ever did 
 Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear 
 Other people say to me when I was a kid 
 So please don't make me some type of hero 
 'Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way 
 But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit 
 In the world and tell it to suck on a dick 'cause I still make fun 
 Of a sit' someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense 
 I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen 
 I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence 
 On a balance beam if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging 
 But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish childish things 
 Without even blinking, without even thinkin' about 
 All the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' for the crowds 
 They're screaming in The Palace, sold out this evening 
 But now as I lay me down sleeping 
 Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap? 
 Is it greed? Do I take more than I need? 
 When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin' 
 'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying 
 So an artist how I paint myself 
 And through my heroine ordeals I'm so vain 
 I want my respect 
 But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect 
 Till I sit in the dark and I reflect 
 And my reflection shows what it's like here 
 Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights 
 Yeah, it's like a nightmare 
 I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare 
 And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah 
 'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night 
 And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears 
 Cause this ice layer 
 I skate on's a nice way of putting it, but I like stayin' 
 Feistier then a triceratops and like a dice player 
 I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair 
 Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit 
 From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it 
 And I feel so isolated, nice I made it 
 But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it 
 So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it 
 Then wonder why I stay famous 
 I keep walkin' the line 
 This gold fish bowl gets old 
 But especially when you don't know 
 If your conscience is sayin' I told you so 
 Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier 
 Or you sold your soul 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying 
 And from here you look so small 
 Hovering high above us all 
 Please come back to me 
 I still remember the times when 
 They were simpler than the rhymes of 
 Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics 
 I'll never forget what that feeling was like 
 I miss those times now when I was just starting out 
 Without a dime and, now I'm diamond 
 I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been 
 Stuck in this house hibernatin' 
 Hate even going outside it 
 Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin' 
 I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it 
 Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and 
 Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me 
 Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz 
 Wow, I must have had Alzheimers 
 Long time since I shouted them out, bout time 
 'Cause it's been on my mind lately how 
 Zee, you always supported me 
 You vouched, I will never forget that and 
 How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace 
 I love you too, you slept on my couch 
 And I been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at the outhouse 
 Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do 
 And regardless how life has turned out 
 Inside I'm, I'll always be an outsider 
 My life has been turned inside out but I 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying 
 I know, it's a fine, fine line 
 Living in a hole dying
