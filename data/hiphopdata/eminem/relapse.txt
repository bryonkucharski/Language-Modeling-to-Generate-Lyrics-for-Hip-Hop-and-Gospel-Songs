How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges 
 He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem 
 Well, to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic 
 They've compelled me to kill this elderly man 
 And I get these panic attacks 
 Pop a xanax, relax 
 Tryna stick my ****in' dick inside a mannequin's ass 
 Then I get manic depressed 
 See the orthodontist get gassed 
 Man, it's kickass 
 The first thing I put on is the mask 
 Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of face 
 And take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin' 
 Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation 
 That's bacon souffle you makin', ain't you? well, thank you jason 
 There goes one more coma 
 Due to blunt force trauma 
 Just give me one more soma 
 And I'll be done for, mama 
 Go in the damn broom closet 
 Another valium, lost it 
 Shovin' the vacuum nozzle 
 Down the bathroom faucet 
 Seems like every day I get a little flakier 
 The medication is making my hands a little shakier 
 Hand me the 18 month old baby, come shake 'em up 
 It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea 
 Breakin' his neck in eightysome places 
 Baby, he's shady comes lady 
 He's got the razor-b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw, baby 
 You b-b-blundering, bumbling m-m-mumbling dum-dum 
 Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? vrum-vrum 
 There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum 
 My head and torso are some won' where they come from 
 Who's it belong to, maybe the girl with the long blonde hair 
 Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms 
 Clearly there's some' wrong 
 'Cause she didn't come home 
 She's missing 
 Where is she 
 Something fishy is goin' on 
 I guess he stuck the xxxxx with the pitchfork with the long prongs 
 Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song 
 Come o
