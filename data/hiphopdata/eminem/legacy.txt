 Tell me where to go, tell me what to do 
 I'll be right there for you 
 Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true 
 I'll say it all for you 
 Eminem 
 : 
 I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling 
 Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian? 
 What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in? 
 'Cause I don't belong in this world that’s why I'm scoffing 
 At authority, defiant often, flying off at 
 The handle at my mom, no dad, So I’m non-com- 
 -pliant at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward 
 And I don’t need no goddamn psychologist 
 Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems 
 Thinking he can try and solve 'em 
 I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk 
 And in the front drive talking to myself 
 Either that or inside hiding off in 
 The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing 
 I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking 
 Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said that I eyeballed him 
 Polina 
 : 
 And if you fall, I'll get you there 
 I'll be your savior from 
 All the wars that are fought inside your world 
 Please have faith in my words 
 'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh 
 This is my legacy, legacy, eh 
 There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see 
 This is my legacy, legacy 
 Legacy, legacy 
 Eminem 
 : 
 I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling 
 Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
 'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling 
 'Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit 
 Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara 
 Then split, but I don’t give a shit I'm fine long as 
 There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me 
 Shit look on the bright side, at least I ain't walking 
 I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment 
 Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts 
 That I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it 
 Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try an' start shit 
 But if this is all there is for me life offers 
 Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense 
 But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience 
 What about them rhymes I've been jottin' they're kinda giving me confidence 
 Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics 
 Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx? 
 To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that 
 Say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him 
 Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch 
 Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that 
 I could be iconic in my conquest 
 That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

 Eminem 
 : 
 I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling 
 Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome 
 'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work 
 Words like this and connect lines like crosswords 
 And use my enemy's words as strength 
 To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em 
 'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit 
 By you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit 
 Now you shut up bitch, I am talking 
 Thought I was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walking 
 Me against the world so what, I'm Brian Dawkins 
 Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions' offense 
 So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins 
 It's the body bag game, bitch I'm supplying coffins 
 'Cause you dicks butt-kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers 
 You gon' die a ball-licker 
 I've been diabolical with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus 
 You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can 
 Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass 
 In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage 
 The most high exalting and I ain't halting 
 Till I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes 
 The best part about me is I am not you 
 I'm me, and I'm the fire marshal and
