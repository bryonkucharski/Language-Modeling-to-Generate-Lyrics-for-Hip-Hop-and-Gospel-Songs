Yeah, boy 
 You better ring the alarm, boy 
 Them know what's coming, boy 
 Buck, buck, buck, Ha-ha 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 (Eminem) 
 Oh my god, fucking bombaclot, 
 I'm hard as Kenard, The little boy that shot Omar in The Wire 
 Tie a whore up with barbed wire in nothing but a Bra 
 Boy, I'm the real deal, and charbroil on the bonfire 
 And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee 
 In this bitch, send the bomb to my mom's lawyer 
 I'm a problem for you, boy, you think your Tom Sawyer 
 Till I pull you out the fucking storybook and stomp on ya 
 Fucking fictional characters and fairytales 
 Prepare yourself for Captain America on ferris wheels 
 But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware it's real 
 Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield 
 Mr. fly by the seat of his pants para-sail 
 Fall, hit the trampoline, bounch and grab a pair of stilts 
 And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing no nada 
 Like your father fucking your mother 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me 
 (Eminem) 
 Boy, I'm the real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids 
 Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here comes the Killjoys 
 Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap crown royales 
 The scalp cowboys, now how that sound for ya? 
 Yeah, boy, you know we bout to put it down for ya 
 So, kick your shoes off, and before you have a sound voyage 
 Sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow 
 Get some marinara, marinate in some maranara 
 And have a coke and smile, don't make me open a jar 
 Whip ass on ya, that's the last straw you hoping to draw 
 Yeah, you fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all 
 Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys them no up to par 
 I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot 
 There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star 
 Boy I told you, boy, I'm a soldier, boy, I'm DeShaun 
 Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud 
 I'll destroy ya, boy, fuck around and blow you decide 
 Oh my god, boy, you didn't go there, no you did not 
 I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, your the plot 
 You getting got whether you try to avoid it or not 
 Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock 
 We get to beefing, ain't no telling at what point it'll stop 
 All I gotta do is point to the spot 
 When the bomb drops, boy does it drop 
 And when it does, boy, there's a problem 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me 
 (Eminem) 
 Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Michael Spinx with the belt 
 Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself 
 I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else 
 Bringing hell, boy, singing telegrams or get dealt 
 And to that boy I'm upsetted in mental said he was better 
 I bet that he's never seen Freddy in that black and red little sweater 
 Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater 
 The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later 
 Giving haters incubators, think you made a mistake 
 By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the the gate 
 You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave 
 I'm bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day 
 So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree 
 With ya more if you were to say that my fucking shit doesn't stank 
 Shady fucking aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink 
 It just floats in the fucking water till we fill up the tank 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 Please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me 
 Drop the bomb on 'em 
 I don't want no dog gone beef 
 You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
