 RAP 
 This guy's a choke artist 
 Ya catch a bad one 
 Your better off shootin yourself 
 With Papa Doc's handgun 
 Climbin up this mountain your weak 
 Ill leave you lost without a paddle 
 Floatin up shits creek 
 You ain't Detroit, I'm the D 
 Your the new kid on the block 
 Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks 
 Fuckin' Nazi, this crowd ain't your type 
 Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice 
 And what I tell you, you better use it 
 This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music 
 Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath 
 And have you lookin' foolish 
 Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself 
 Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that 
 Cause you follow Future like he got carrots up his asscrack 
 And when you actin' up that's when you got jacked up 
 And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up 
 Ill crack your shoulder blade 
 You'll get dropped so hard 
 Elvis will start turnin' in his grave 
 I don't know why they let you out in the dark 
 You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile 
 To the trailor park
