Y'all know me still the same OG 
 But I been low key 
 Hated on by most these niggas 
 With no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys 
 No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's 
 Mad at me cause 
 I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries 
 Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks 
 To add to the wall full of plaques 
 Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies 
 But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze 
 Ho Please 
 You better bow down on both knees 
 Who you think taught you to smoke trees 
 Who you think brought you the o' G's 
 Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's 
 And a group that said muthafuck the police 
 Gave you a tape full of dope beats 
 To bump when stroll through in your hood 
 And when your album sales wasn't doing too good 
 Who's the doc that they told you to go see 
 Y'all better listen up closely 
 All you niggas that said that I turned pop 
 Or the Firm flopped 
 Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep 
 So fuck y'all all of y'all 
 If y'all don't like me blow me 
 Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me 
 And turn me back to the old me 
 Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say 
 But nothing comes out when they move their lips 
 Just a bunch of gibberish 
 And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre 
 So what do you say to somebody you hate 
 Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way 
 Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way 
 Just study your tape of NWA. 
 One day I was walking by 
 With a Walkman on 
 When I caught a guy giving me an awkward eye 
 And strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani 
 I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not 
 I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge 
 But I'm drunk as fuck 
 Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage 
 Hopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off 
 Fuck you too bitch call the cops 
 I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfucking barking dogs 
 And when the cops came through 
 Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house 
 With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches 
 And still weren't found out 
 From here on out it's the Chronic 2 
 Starting today and tomorrow's the new 
 And I'm still loco enough 
 To choke you to death with a Charleston chew 
 (Record scratch) 
 Slim shady hotter than a set of twin babies 
 In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up 
 And the temp goes up to the mid 80's 
 Calling men ladies 
 Sorry Doc but I been crazy 
 There is no way that you can save me 
 It's OK go with him Hailie 
 Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say 
 But nothing comes out when they move their lips 
 Just a bunch of gibberish 
 And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre 
 If it was up to me 
 You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me 
 With your hands out looking up to me 
 Like you want something free 
 When my last CD was out you wasn't bumping me 
 But now that I got this little company 
 Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease 
 But you won't get a crumb from me 
 'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton 
 I told 'em all 
 All them little gangstas 
 Who you think helped mold 'em all 
 Now you wanna run around and talk about guns 
 Like I ain't got none 
 What you think I sold 'em all 
 'Cause I stay well off 
 Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off 
 What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad 
 Tryna get this damn label off 
 I ain't having that 
 This is the millennium of Aftermath 
 It ain't gonna be nothing after that 
 So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap 
 You can have it back 
 So where's all the mad rappers at 
 It's like a jungle in this habitat 
 But all you savage cats 
 Knew that I was strapped with gats 
 When you were cuddling a cabbage patch 
 Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say 
 But nothing comes out when they move their lips 
 Just a bunch of gibberish 
 And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
