 Your fakeness is atrocious 
 Post is deep in your hypnosis 
 Then focus 
 Roll this 
 And smoke this 
 Like l's 
 Of that bomb-ass herb that's guaranteed to rock bells 
 A hiphop refugee like praswell 
 Travelin citys 
 Pimpin' babblin biddys 
 Game trump tight and solidified 
 Comupterized 
 To get rid of spies 
 Know what I do to guys 
 Shootin and spittin' lies 
 I'm banished in exisdence 
 Vanishin any instences 
 Brandishin sentences 
 Proovin repentences 
 The only way to see me, don't miss these 
 Me and my crew smoke so many trees that 
 I piss leaves 
 Never _my bitch please 
 But keep smokin' my system, roll blunts it's all tight 
 On an off night 
 I still smoke like exaust pipes 
 And bust a universal flow 
 And blow your wig back like niggas with toupe's 
 Drivin' a convertable 
 And further more 
 I run the board 
 Your shit is played and the way you fell off you coulnt bounce 
 Back with a bungee cord 
 Bring your boys in 
 We can bring the noise in 
 You don't wanna fuck with dirty dozen 
 Repeat 4 times 
 Bizarre 
 My crew is like a maze 
 Put fear like ex-slaves 
 Who wanna step to this microphone and think that they brave 
 Dozen always startin the fuckin' beef 
 I don't care if your from kansas I'm killin' the fuckin' chief 
 Back the fuck up I'm releasin my dumb-dumbs 
 Tell your whore stop pagin me 9 1 1 
 I'm the star 
 That they call bizarre 
 Smokin' blunts with mel far (??) 
 In my brand new car 
 _Wanna see me 
 Even if I was in arizona I'd still request iced tea 
 Bizarre don't give a shit about you 
 On top of the mountain ain't nothin' your bitch-ass crew 
 Can do 
 Sick emcee that they call peter 
 Treat your crew like an unexpected meter 
 Reader 
 Fuckin' more shit than howard corsell 
 Butt-fuckin' jassabells 
 In nasty hotels 
 Proof 
 How you think your crew sound compared to this 
 It's the team that your entire clique scared to diss 
 Demandin attention when the glock sound 
 Y'all niggas to be murdered like jeffery daumer on lock down 
 I'm brown like bobby, pullin hoe's like whitney 
 Take your title, kill your moms so you won't forget me 
 Lips sealed nigga I might blow important plots 
 Whoever fronts is gettin' done like micheal jordan's pops 
 Sure I'm number one translator my fame dirty d 
 Y'all niggas gettin' hung like this was 1933 
 Got word of me 
 Now flee 
 Cause you don't got a chance 
 Death is 3 easy steps so now we gotta dance 
 So look away 
 Don't play 
 With the style master 
 I love killin' beef so I kill a whole cow pasture 
 Lyrically I'm sick, ill everything but sober 
 My nickel plate pack the _ jackin fool get fucked over 
 Eminem 
 Dirty dozen is the clique so I ran over and lit cha 
 Ripped the ass right out ya pants like a dovermin pincha 
 Like the cobra and ninja 
 My intentions to injure 
 And prevent ya 
 From enterin from the edge of my center 
 Or get your muthafuckin pants split at the creases 
 Fuckin' you intelectually givin' you menatly sexually transmited diseases 
 My duty is to keep a strange abard (??) 
 I guard my sector like a saint bernard 
 And this ain't the yard 
 Bringin' the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger 
 Droppin' your whole clique with one finger 
 Till none linger 
 Beware of my dogs attackin like a pack of great danes 
 Chargin like freight trains 
 Through the great plains
