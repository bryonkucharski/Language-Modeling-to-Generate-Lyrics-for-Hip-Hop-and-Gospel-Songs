 I'll spit a racial slur honky sew me 
 This shit is a Horror flick but a black guy doesn't die in this movie. 
 You gotta be kiddin 
 That makes me believe you really don't have an interest to livin' 
 You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say 
 I got a better chance joining the kkk 
 For some real shit though I like you 
 That's why I didn't want to be the one you commit suicide to 
 Fuck lotto call me your leader 
 I feel bad that I gota murder that dude from leave it to beaver 
 I used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode 
 But oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go 
 I hate to do this I would love for this shit to 
 Last so I'll 
 Take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass 
 And alls well that ends ok 
 So I'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day

 So was Eddie Hasko, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver 
 This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid 
 Quick someone get his ass another steroid 
 Blah badi boo blah bah badi bloo blah 
 I ain't hear a word you said 
 Hipidi hoo bla

 Look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job 
 Didn't you listen to the last round meat head 
 Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said 
 Matter fact dogg heres a pencil 
 Go home write some stuff make it suspensful 
 And don't come back until something dope hits you 
 Fuck it you can take the mic home with you 
 Looking like a cyclone hit you 
 Tank top screaming lotto I don't fit you 
 You look how far these white jokes get you 
 Boy's like how vanilla ice gonna diss you 
 My motto fuck lotto 
 I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow (oh)
