Guess what? 
 I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in in a minute 
 Hey yo, this is my love song 
 It goes like this 
 Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark 
 This is how we used to make the party start 
 We used to mix Henn' with Bacardi Dark 
 And when it kicks in you can hardly talk 
 And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl 
 And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf 
 And my prediction is that you gon' probably fall 
 Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall 
 And everything's spinning, you're beginning to think 
 Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink 
 Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished 
 You are now allowed to officially slap bitches 
 You have the right to remain violent and start wildin' 
 Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you 
 Get in the car and start it and start driving 
 Over the island and cause a 42-car pileup 
 "Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot 
 Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it 
 All I can see is a bunch of smoke flying 
 And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it 
 Let me out of this place I'm outta place 
 I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace 
 I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
 I'll be back in an hour or so" 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa) 
 Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go (go) 
 I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa) 
 Drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 In third grade all I used to do 
 Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube 
 Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude 
 Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs 
 I got no game and every face looks the same 
 They got no name, so I don't need game to play 
 I just say whatever I want to whoever I want 
 Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want 
 However I do show some respect to few 
 This Ecstasy's got me standing next to you 
 Getting sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you 
 We just met, but I think I'm in love with you 
 But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too 
 Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do? 
 I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do 
 'Cause if I get caught cheating then I'm stuck with you" 
 But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later 
 But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy 
 Let the X destroy your spinal cord 
 So it's not a straight line no more 
 So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls 
 Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur 
 Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more 
 So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa) 
 Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go (go) 
 I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow 
 When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow 
 And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again 
 What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it 
 And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? 
 And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again 
 It's your life, live it however you wanna 
 Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up? 
 It don't matter as long as you get where you're going 
 'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going 
 They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring 
 Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning 
 But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do 
 Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you 
 If I could take it all back now I wouldn't 
 I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't 
 But I'm all grown up now and upgraded 
 And graduated to better drugs and updated 
 But I still gotta a lot of growing up to do 
 I still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew 
 But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty 
 Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories 
 With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap 
 Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out getting smashed 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa) 
 Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go (go) 
 I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa) 
 Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa) 
 I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no) 
 They won't let me ever let 'em go (go) 
 I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa) 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa) 
 Drugs really gotta hold of me 
 Really gotta hold of me 
 These drugs really gotta hold of me 
 They really gotta hold of me
