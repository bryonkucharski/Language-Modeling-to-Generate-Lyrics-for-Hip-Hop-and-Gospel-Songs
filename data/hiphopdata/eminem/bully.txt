Yo 
 Check it out 
 It's fucked up 
 'Cause I don't see either one of us budgin' 
 I'm with-holding my anger 
 Though id like to be the strangler 
 Of this punk ass little pussy's punie neck 
 It's my right to insist 
 That he acknowledge my existence 
 But he just displays complete lack of respect 
 That's when he says to himself as he 
 Uses his magazines to trash me 
 As he sits with both his feet up at his desk 
 Smokes a bag of his weed 
 And starts imagining things 
 And he just can't see that hes manically depressed 
 And in his jealousy and envy 
 It just whirls him in a frenzy 
 As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
 And he don't exist in his world 
 So he just twists and he twirls 
 Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage 
 And its destroying him slowly 
 'Cause he does not even know me 
 Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
 So he just tortures himself 
 He has no fortune and wealth 
 So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
 And now hes acting like a bully 
 So he tries to push and pull me 
 But he knows that he can't fool me so hes mad 
 He has no choice but to scream 
 And raise his voice up at me 
 'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 
 You ain't no muthafuckin 
 Buuully 
 And I ain't bowing to no muthafuckin 
 Buuully 
 I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no 
 Buuully 
 I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a 
 Buuully 
 Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 
 Buuully 
 And I know it must be fuckin' with you emotionally 
 Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies 
 No more unfortunately 
 There's so many other muthafuckas that just are 
 They just keep houndin at me 
 Now that I'm down wit 50 
 Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja 
 But his ass is such a puppet 
 Irv could shove his whole hand up it 
 And just make him say what he wants him to say 
 But Suge has Irv on a string 
 And Irv's so nervous that he 
 Says anything to this man to keep him at Bay 
 So now Ja thinks that hes so tough 
 And Murder INC's the big bad wolf 
 And they go huff and puff 
 And blow our label down 
 But our buildings made out of bricks 
 So you ain't takin' our shit 
 And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
 So now you try to pull the race card 
 And it backfires in your face hard 
 'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit 
 Plus that stylist that you fucked 
 When you was extacy'd up 
 Was just a man who's dressed up 
 As a white bitch 
 You must be takin' too much eeeeeeeeee 
 Now what bothers me the most 
 About hip hop is we so close 
 To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac 
 We just lost Jam Master Jay 
 Big L got blasted away 
 Plus we lost Bugs, Snake Tongue and Freaky Tah 
 It's like a neverending cycle 
 That just seems to come full circle 
 Everybodies gotta be so fuckin' hard 
 And I'm not excluding myself 
 'Cause I been stupid as well 
 I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
 But as we grow as men we learn 
 To let shit go but then again 
 There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
 We all got reps to up hold 
 When someone steps on our toe 
 Its no exception it goes for every man 
 But if Irv really gave a fuck 
 About Ja like he claims he does 
 And wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
 They just keep feeding him pills 
 So if that E doesn't kill him 
 Someone from G Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
 Dawg I'm talkin' to you straight 
 If the situation escalates and worse 
 Were gonna lose another soldier to this game 
 And if I get killed for this rap 
 I got a million in cash 
 That says I will get you back in Hailey's name 
 Irv go get your boy up off that Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
 Get at me dawg, holla
