Hi, original bad boy on the case, cover your face 
 Came in the place blowed, and sprayed puffy with mase 
 I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly 
 Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling 
 With a capital, somebody grab me a snapple 
 I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple 
 Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure 
 That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her 
 I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
 And said, "I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?" 
 The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
 I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell 
 I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphilis germs 
 And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns 
 I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach 
 And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it, yuck 
 Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet 
 If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick till you numb it 
 And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it 
 'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it 
 Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi 
 'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy 
 I'm ice grillin you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin 
 I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym 
 I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias 
 To save me with in case, I get chased by space aliens 
 A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium 
 Than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
 A highly combustible head, spazmatic 
 Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed 
 Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
 I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician 
 High speed, IV full of Thai weed 
 Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese twins 
 Joined at the groin like lesbians 
 Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
 I hope God forgives me for my sins, it probably all depends 
 On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends 
 Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi 
 'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy 
 'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi 
 'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
 For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin 
 Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? 
 Is fuckin' crazy 
 Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust 
 And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
 Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say 
 I call in to work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play 
 I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
 Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be 
 Give me eleven Excederin' my head'll spin 
 Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine 
 Scratched my balls till I shredded skin 
 Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been 
 It's probably AIDS, Forget it then 
 I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
 That don't even make sense, like dyke's usin' dildos 
 So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats 
 And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus 
 Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin' I get weeded 
 My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it, damn
