Ashes blowing in the air 
 The world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah 
 Wasted youth, always on the road 
 Never lookin' back and we're never getting old 
 'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold 
 Fuck doin' what you're told 
 We're goin' nowhere fast 
 I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track 
 This road is takin' me back down memory lane with this rap 
 I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback 
 I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed 
 But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast 
 Another terrorist attacks 
 Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas 
 We perish in the blast 
 But that isn't scaring us, we pass nowhere we're fearless 
 'Cause we're just 
 Ashes blowing in the air 
 Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah 
 (We don't give a... no, no) 
 Wasted youth, always on the road 
 Never lookin' back and we're never getting old 
 'Cause the skies are black 
 But our heart's made of gold (golden) 
 Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told) 
 We're goin' nowhere fast 
 'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' nowhere 
 We're on the run of our lives 
 Goin' nowhere fast 
 Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old 
 Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow 
 Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral 
 When I'm devisin' this rhyme 
 'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning 
 That's why I rise and I shine 
 Like a new day has dawned on me 
 Gusto, guts, bravado 
 Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot 
 I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle 
 'Cause some stuff that's awful 
 Really don't mean nothin' although 
 There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow 
 But if at times my heart it seems 
 Like it's in the wrong place 
 It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve 
 Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer 
 Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward 
 But where we're goin', we have no idea 
 Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here 
 I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist 
 Just one spark and it's lit 
 But I'mma still get dark on this shit 
 Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine 
 But you forced me in a corner 
 I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear 
 And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe 
 Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu 
 I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un 
 And end up ruinin' your career 
 But when all is said and done 
 And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young 
 Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come 
 Till the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was 
 Till the bomb drops, hope it never does 
 But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause 
 This world's screwed, it's already fucked 
 And I'm on top, so everyone's just 
 Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...) 
 Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah 
 (We don't give a... no, no) 
 Wasted youth, always on the road 
 Never lookin' back and we're never getting old 
 'Cause the skies are black 
 But our heart's made of gold (golden) 
 Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told) 
 We're goin' nowhere fast 
 'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' nowhere 
 We're on the run of our lives 
 Goin' nowhere fast 
 You can't tell us nothin' 
 Hard-headed and we're stubborn 
 So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young 
 (We're on the run of our lives) 
 Who knows what the future for us could hold 
 Another shooter? Uh oh 
 (We're on the run of our lives) 
 No more tomorrows, we're done 
 And all we are is- 
 Ashes blowing in the air (so we're...) 
 Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah) 
 (We don't give a... no, no) 
 Wasted youth, always on the road 
 Never lookin' back and we're never getting old 
 'Cause the skies are black 
 But our heart's made of gold (golden) 
 Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told) 
 We're goin' nowhere fast 
 (Post-Chorus: Kehlani) 
 'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' no 
 Goin' no, goin' nowhere 
 We're on the run of our lives 
 Goin' nowhere fast
