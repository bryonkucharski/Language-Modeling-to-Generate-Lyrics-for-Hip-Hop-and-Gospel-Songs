 Uh, Nickle nine a nigga twitter beefin' first rapper that shot a fan 
 Gucci's my absolute state of mind, like Waka's man 
 Chopper's brand, getting head in the car park, new Gallardo 
 This bitch sucking my dick today, call yesterday's news tomorrow 
 Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae-bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Iver 
 'Bout to saves a couple of these bitches that's right, I'm the new Bible 
 You? You 5.0, me? I'm all grounded to punishments, but I'm too fly though 
 Y'all niggas be winin', I should call you Moscato 
 (Eminem) 
 Look down at the floor board 
 Looks like someone left a pair stiletto shoes in my Tahoe 
 Never know what type of a hoe inside of my ride I may let 
 Last night at 5 AM, and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet 
 Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret 
 I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get up the fucking drive way yet 
 Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for Get in girl, don't front shorty 
 You're Fightin' an unwinnable war, it's useless, like tits on a bull, little tits on a whore 
 Got a mack and it's full of brats kicking and screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor 
 Get in the whip, but you ain't turning this frog into a prince 
 What you keep tryna convince me for? 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 (No you don't) 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 (Not from me) 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 (Not on the lips are you crazy) 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 (Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me) 
 (Verse 2: Eminem) 
 Now you in my whip as long as you understand that I can't be whipped 
 You sick of companionship I say abandon ship, I'm a gigolo so you know, I'm always on the go 
 I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit 
 Drop the P and add a T, yeah, you can get mad at me all you want 
 But I'm ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one 
 A one-night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah one like Stan, 
 And he's so about a night stand in his bedroom has two lamps, 
 And only one nightstand. get the hint, 
 Ooh yeah boo, Ew, I ain't finna' to argue but why 
 You think they call it boo? cause it sound like it's supposed to scare you 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Oh Ho, we can share you in the back of the Mclaren, I don't give a fuck 
 What your name is, Were gunna call you Hot and Bi, I hope your Bi, 
 But in the mean your name is Sharon 
 Slow the flow down so I can what 
 Tell your same face when I'm shooting guns is the same face I make when I fuck 
 From back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane 
 You then change, 'cause I'm out of this world, girl I got that Milky Way dick vein 
 I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness 
 And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss

 (Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9") 
 Push a chick out the car when it's moving like waka's man 
 Her bottom's dark, but her top it tan 
 Her private parts got here on the pole 
 Like the opposite of her papa's plan 
 (Eminem) 
 Come on stripper! Let's hit the strip 180 
 Throw it in reverse and drop the trans 
 I'm in a trans man look at this bitch dance 
 (Royce) 
 Looking at this tramp, like what you wearing 
 Girl quit playing! 
 (Eminem) 
 Yeah bitch in them scrach 'n' sniff pants 
 Well let me scratch em 
 (Royce) 
 Let me sniff yeah 
 What? Did I say that? 
 I'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands 
 (Eminem) 
 Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands 
 But girl you got a butt like no if, ands 
 So yeah what the hell maybe 
 Awe hell Shady, he'll tell her like it is 
 So tell Katy Perry he's on her tail he's tail gating 
 These bells are my mating call, and I'm here bell's waiting 
 And tell Lady Gaga she can quit her job at the post office 
 She's still a male lady! 
 Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in 
 He's allergic to divas, he'd take meat cleavers to 'em, 
 He don't give a damn about Bieber doin'! 
 What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seething through him 
 (Royce) 
 I like the strip tease you doing 
 This evening, you and me gonna find 
 3 more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki 
 You hot like dickee outfit in Texas 
 Without your under it sweatin 
 Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic 
 (Eminem) 
 My god trick, My dick is as hard as a yardstick 
 What we gonna do? Ride around till we're carsick 
 Then I'm gonna put this shit in park like dog shit 
 And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot 
 Of a trailer park by the garbage 
 What you waiting on Me to roll up the carpet? 
 The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it! 
 Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here 
 Trying to make fake farts with my armpits? 
 Tryin' to get you to sniff pot through your nose 
 Am I here to amuse you? Stop it. 
 (Royce) 
 I'm in your pocket outside of a church 
 The other hand reachin' for the bottom of your purse 
 You giving me head in a boxing stance 
 My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt 
 I'm not your man, we're sparring partners 
 There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's 
 Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick 
 Sucking a dick, sucking a dick 
 (Eminem) 
 If you ain't sucking a dick 
 Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen 
 Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you 
 Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck 
 And then try to get truculent? 
 (Royce) 
 You should be suffering, you should be cooking 
 You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts 
 (Eminem) 
 Excuse me while I make an ass of myself, but it's just 
 'Cause I wanna get... 
 I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
