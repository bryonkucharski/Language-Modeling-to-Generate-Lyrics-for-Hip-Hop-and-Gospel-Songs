You really don't know me 
 I feel iscloated around you 
 You make feel strange and embarrassed 
 Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke 
 I think I want to go solo 
 Going Solo Solo Solo 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Ill manage thank you 
 Without you making me look like a fool 
 I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo 
 Think You can mess with my mind 
 But I'm smarter than that 
 Can't you read my facial expressions 
 Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke 
 I think I want to go solo 
 Going Solo Solo Solo 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Ill manage thank you 
 Without you making me look like a fool 
 I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo 
 Nothing can stop me 
 I feel like the brightest thing around 
 Nothing will make me be with you 
 Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke 
 I think I want to go solo 
 Going Solo Solo Solo 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Ill manage thank you 
 Without you making me look like a fool 
 I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo 
 Going Solo Solo Solo 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Ill manage thank you 
 Without you making me look like a fool 
 I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo 
 Nothing can stop me from being here 
 In this position of being solo 
 And not doing a duet on the next karaoke 
 I think I'm good at... 
 Going Solo Solo Solo 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Ill manage thank you 
 Without you making me look like a fool 
 I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo
