Yeah, (oh, oh), yeah yeah, oh 
 I feel like dancing 
 I feel like dancing 
 I smell something in the air that's making me (high) 
 I said I smell something in the air that's making me high 
 Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so 
 Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco 
 You mother fuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs 
 Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos 
 Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole 
 She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto 
 Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso 
 Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so 
 You know how that go, skull and the crossbones 
 This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know 
 You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice) 
 This is niether the time or the place to get macho 
 So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos 
 Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow 
 It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though 
 Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind 
 Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill 
 Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill 
 You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel 
 Like I don't think anyone's real, 
 Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer 
 Please don't upset me mama, you lookin' sexy mama, 
 Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama 
 Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer, 
 Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza 
 How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row, 
 Put 'em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper, 
 Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper, 
 Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped, 
 The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate 
 And which motel which lake they found her in, 
 And how they attacked the victim, 
 Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one, 
 Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none, 
 So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin' ecstasy goes 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind 
 When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like 
 Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light 
 Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way 
 Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be? 
 Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms 
 Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some, 
 He can give her some, she can give him some 
 Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome 
 You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm 
 Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up 
 Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a 
 Titanium brain that's full of, surprises 
 When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes 
 You stare into your stereos eyes 
 Good evening, this isn't't even a weed thing, 
 I didn't even smoke anything, I didn't even drink anything 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind 
 It must be the ganja 
 It's the marijuana 
 That's creepin' upon me why I'm so high 
 Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me 
 Whatever's got into me I don't mind
