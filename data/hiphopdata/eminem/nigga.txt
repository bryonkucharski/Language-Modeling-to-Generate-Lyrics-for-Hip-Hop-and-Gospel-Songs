I got 50 Cent 
 I got G-Unit 
 D-Twizzyin this bitch 
 With Obie Triiiiice 
 So watch what you say 
 Before you call our name 
 If you say one more thing 
 It won't be nice 
 Here we go 
 I shoulda known 
 I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later 
 You little haters are too jellous of us to love us 
 You ain't it 
 G-Unit made it 
 And Obie's comin' 
 D-Twizzy's comin' 
 You sick to your stomach 
 50% is 50-Cent 
 The other 50% is who's color skin it is 
 Don't even consider takin' our label down 
 You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it 
 But I ain't tryin' to get too intriqette into it 
 I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit 
 'Cause then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates into some other shit 
 Then I'm a flip 
 Then I'm a get to stompin in my Air Force One's 
 Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one 
 It's gunna feel like there's so many feet kickin you 
 You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes 
 I don't know what it is or what it could be 
 But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me 
 Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me 
 Y'all tickle me pink 
 I think I'd just rather have pink tiggle me 
 Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickety a little bit of the diggity dock diggity 
 Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-ja-jigga 
 With a small pinch of Biggie 
 Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity 
 We the realest label 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel our label 
 'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label 
 Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho 
 We the realest label 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel our label 
 We gon' fuck around and steal your people 
 Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho 
 Shady in the place to be seen 
 And I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT! 
 Still watch what you say to me punk 'cause I'm off probation in less then 6 MONTHS! 
 Ha ha whoo 
 Shady Records 
 Still Aftermath 
 And don't thik we don't hear you mutha fucka's talkin' 
 We see y'all 
 But we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck y'all do
