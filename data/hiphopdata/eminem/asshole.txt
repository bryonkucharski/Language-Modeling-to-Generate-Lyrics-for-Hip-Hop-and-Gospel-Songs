I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain 
 An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling 
 But don't think I ever stopped to think I was speaking to children 
 Everything was happening so fast 
 It was like I blinked, sold three million 
 Then it all went blank, all I remember 
 Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling 
 Like I'm always under attack man 
 I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling 
 Women dish him but really thinking 
 If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him 
 Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite 
 When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many 
 People ever give a shit but I had to say, it's just my opinion 
 If it contradicts how I'm living 
 Put a dick in your rear end and guess what 
 Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it 
 For drawing more attention toward it 
 Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude 
 Thought I was that important 
 But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect 
 And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid 
 Attaboy, they told me to slow down and I just zone out 
 Good luck trying to convince a blonde 
 That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out 
 'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt 
 In anyone's mind one day I'd go down 
 In history think they know now because everybody knows 
 Everybody knows that you're just an asshole 
 Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows 
 Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice 
 There's no place you can hide 
 You are just an asshole 
 Everyone knows, everyone knows 
 Thanks for the support, asshole 
 Thanks for the support, asshole 
 Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth 
 When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out 
 Thought I was history 
 But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey 
 Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth 
 Lay'em off it 
 But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about 
 The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me 
 You knock me down, I went down for the count 
 I fell but the fans caught me, and now 
 You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me 
 To take my belt, word to Pacquiao 
 Mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about 
 Gotta go in that ring and knock them out 
 Or you better not come out 
 It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare 
 So what if the insults are revolting 
 Even Helen Keller knows life stinks 
 You think it's a joke till you're bullet riddled 
 But you should give little shit what I think 
 This whole world is a mess 
 Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock 
 Just to go out watch Batman 
 Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man 
 Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage 
 Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model 
 Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado 
 So get lost, Waldo 
 My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping 
 A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole 
 With a pack torn of paper 
 But I'm not taking no crap, ho 
 Here I go down the back pole 
 And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go 
 Trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows 
 Everybody knows that you're just an asshole 
 Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows 
 Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice 
 There's no place you can hide 
 You are just an asshole 
 Everyone knows, everyone knows 
 Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth 
 I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull 
 Thinkin' we have some magnetic pull 
 Screamin' ICP in this bitch, how do magnets work!? 
 'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable 
 Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical 
 I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical 
 Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical 
 You crackin' a joke, it's laughable 
 'Cause me and love's like a bad combination 
 I keep them feelings locked in a vault 
 So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable 
 My heart is truly guarded, full body armor 
 Bitch you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you're special, you're retarded 
 Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina 
 You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind 
 Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er 
 'Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor 
 Been tryina hunt me down like a dog, 'cause you're on my ass 
 But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent 
 With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin' 
 Only women that I love are my daughters 
 And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father 
 And I push it farther 
 So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line 
 It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up 
 So to hell with your parents and motherfucking Father Time 
 And it ain't never gonna stop 
 A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime 
 So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive 
 Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over 
 And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster 
 I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off? 
 So fear not my dear and dry up your teardrops, I'm here, white America's mirror 
 So I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too 
 You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows 
 Everybody knows that you're just an asshole 
 Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows 
 Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice 
 There's no place you can hide 
 You are just an asshole 
 Everyone knows, everyone knows
