Rick Ross: 
 Hello Good morning tell me what the lip read 
 Pretty face, thin waist with the sick weave 
 First time fish tailing in the 6 speed 
 Real bad boy tell 'em come and get me 
 I'm at the fight, been kinda like Bellmen 
 Only took the trip to the truck twice 
 Unpacked the Mac 11 and air max's 
 Stuff six figures in my damn air mattress 
 Uh, I'm in love with large bills 
 A dime with a fat ass, thin waist and tall heels 
 Yeah, it's the teflon Don, 
 Hundred carrots in the charm tryna give it back to Sean. 
 Diddy:

 Dirty Money: 
 'Cause I've been leaning on the bar 
 Looking cleaner than the star 
 All these broads wont give me my props 
 25 on the bank I be stunting on their ass 
 And they mad cause the bitch won't stop 
 Diddy - Dirty Money - Chorus: 
 Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie 
 (You know, you know, we know, we on that) 
 Stuntin like you looking like a movie 
 (You know, you know, we know, we on that) 
 And everybody know who the truth be 
 (You know, you know, we know, we on that) 
 I blow 'cause I'm blowing on the oh wee 
 (You know, you know, we know, we on that)

 Nicki Minaj: 
 I came up in it a little bit self centered 
 But did I kill a Queen 
 Alexander McQueen's got a wrist on glow 
 The bottles is on po' 
 Got that shibby shibby yeah shibby yeah ayou! 
 What the fuck I look like bitch I run this town 
 I ain't coming out for less than a 100 thou 
 Man, the last time I checked I was bubbling out 
 Got to turn down shows, out in Dublin now 
 Wait wait hold on, maybe they didn't get that here 
 Like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear 
 Swerve on them sorta like I missed that dear 
 Press that little button on the sit back chair 
 Bitch I do it 'cause I get it 
 I got billion dollar credit 
 If you got a million dollars you could put it up in bet it 
 I just be like hello hello but I never could salute them 
 Young money I do it for the yout dem!

 And I'm the one that you wanna be with 
 But right now baby you dreaming 
 Wake up and turn the lights off 
 Dirty Money:

 And they mad cause the bitch won't stop
