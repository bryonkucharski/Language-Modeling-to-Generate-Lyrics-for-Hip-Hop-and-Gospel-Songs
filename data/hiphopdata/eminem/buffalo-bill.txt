(Eminem) 
 Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya, 
 Onslaught, coming and I'm packing in my lunch a, 
 Bunch a missile launchers and a bunch a contra- 
 Ban van full of ganja, now come on jump, 
 Man stop marchin' Marshall oh my God ya, 
 Doin' the cha cha and the cucaracha with a quadri- 
 Plegic boogieing down to Frank Sinatra, 
 Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya, 
 Who da knew the Buddha do ta me what's its done, 
 Such cynicism when this isn't in my system, 
 Blunt hypnotism lift the spliff up to my lip son, 
 So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist pump, 
 Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks, 
 Mis-ter, "help me"'s what he said to me and then sunk, 
 Women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks, 
 In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones, 
 Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, 
 Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill, 
 Skin 'em up, hem em, 
 Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts, 
 Upa up in those kilts, 
 Man, you don't want to go up in those hills, 
 Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills 
 You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill, 
 Buffa-buffalo bill, 
 (Eminem) 
 Always, you can see 'em lurking in the hallways, 
 Carcasses of caucasion females in his crawl space, 
 How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place, 
 Hide 'em in the wall but how long will the drywall take, 
 Well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait, 
 Until it dries for the moment I guess your all safe, 
 After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint, 
 My chainsaw's outta gas my regular saw ain't, 
 Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling, 
 You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within, 
 Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummaging, 
 It's a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want her skin, 
 Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end, 
 Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win, 
 Severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb, 
 Pull the lever then trap door, death is evident 
 Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, 
 Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill, 
 Skin 'em up, hem em, 
 Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts, 
 Upa up in those kilts, 
 Man, you don't want to go up in those hills, 
 Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills 
 You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill, 
 Buffa-buffalo bill, 
 (Eminem) 
 Now what you know about Buffalo Bill, 
 Nothing so chill, 
 F-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still, 
 Make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don't spill, 
 Cut 'em gut 'em and just keep stuffing those girls, 
 Man I think she had enough of those pills, 
 Sedate her, then I wait I come back later just to clutch on those steel blades 
 Baby when I cut ya don't squeal 
 I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you, 
 I keep hearing voices like 
 Wouldn't you like to go and get ya butcher knife 
 And push it right through her while ya put ya shish-kebab skewer 
 Into her, barbecue her or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who's skins newer, 
 (Yoda) 
 In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts, 
 Christmas Ornament you are, 
 (Eminem) 
 I"ll be sure to Ginsu ya till there's no more skin to ya, 
 Boo ya who ya think you f-cking with, 
 Duck because here he comes again, 
 Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, 
 Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill, 
 Skin 'em up, hem em, 
 Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts, 
 Upa up in those kilts, 
 Man you don't want to go up in those hills, 
 Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills 
 You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill, 
 Buffa-buffalo bill,
