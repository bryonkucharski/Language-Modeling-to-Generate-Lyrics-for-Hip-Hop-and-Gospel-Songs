Im driven to write 
 Given the mic 
 Livin' the life 
 That you livin' at night 
 Just to live in the light 
 And deliver delight 
 And slither the slight sight 
 Of the life that ain't right 
 Into your mind 
 Meant to remind 
 U went through the grind 
 To get through the line 
 Ain't no more waitin 
 To reach ur goal 
 There ain't no more Satan 
 To impeach ur soul 
 He can't affect u 
 He can dissect u 
 And change ur mind 
 Bad thoughts can direct u 
 Defects can be gains 
 Ur worries are tainted 
 Mistakes can be saints 
 'Cause they can correct u
