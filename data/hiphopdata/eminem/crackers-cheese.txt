I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin 
 Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin 
 Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded 
 Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted 
 To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?" 
 So I find myself in a certain obligatory 
 A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions 
 To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction 
 Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile 
 A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile 
 I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this 
 "Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?" 
 Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating 
 How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading? 
 Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead 
 There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read 
 So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor 
 While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor 
 Words can weigh a ton 
 Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one 
 (Scratched samples) - "Yeah", "It's another 
 Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side 
 But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind 
 And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred 
 But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred 
 Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing 
 Awaking to the absence of unity is startling 
 "Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do? 
 You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to" 
 Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable 
 So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable 
 You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless 
 Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this 
 Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles 
 The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild 
 Blessed with formidable talent and versatility 
 But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty 
 To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear 
 To form an alliance is something even the giants fear 
 So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin 
 Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend 
 (Scratched samples) - "Yeah", "It's another..." 
 (Eminem) 
 You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along 
 You hate me but you know me and what I stand for 
 No. so then why do you speak for me 
 And every other white man when you that we're your enemy? 
 On the floor lies a broken door, 'cause I'm not to be spoken for 
 Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore 
 Rarely do you see the lighter side of me 
 I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry 
 But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted 
 Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted 
 Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted 
 Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted 
 Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick 
 His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh 
 Always fighting for the position of top dog 
 That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog 
 'Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine 
 But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time 
 Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast 
 Judged from the past and he's put last 
 And others with nothing to say 
 Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye 
 Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin 
 And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please 
 I've got a craving
