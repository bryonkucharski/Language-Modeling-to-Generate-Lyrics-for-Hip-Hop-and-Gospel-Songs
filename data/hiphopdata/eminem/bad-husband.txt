We never saw from each other's sides or eye to eye 
 Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight 
 So much baggage, need a luggage rack 
 But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds 
 Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you 
 Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth 
 Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you 
 Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone 
 It was funny back in our youth 
 But then it wasn't after we knew 
 That we were done and actually through (and actually through) 
 But if there's one fraction of truth 
 If it could be spun back I would do 
 So many things different, 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse 
 You hit me once and that I would use 
 To continue the pattern of abuse 
 Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused 
 Because 
 How come you can be a lord and a loser? 
 How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? 
 A good dad, but a bad husband 
 Why are you a good father? 
 A great dad, but a bad husband 
 You were the beat I loved with a writer's block 
 The line that's hot, that I forgot 
 We laughed a little, cried a lot 
 I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie 
 Day before you went to jail and daily 
 How we'd wait for that mail lady 
 Or by the phone for Mom to call 
 And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on 
 Giving it one more try despite it all 
 You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark 
 I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box 
 When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot 
 Every line we crossed we were supposed to not 
 Every time we fought, the insults, they got thrown too far 
 Words that we said that we didn't mean 
 The words that we meant that we didn't say 
 The ones that we thought that we shoulda said 
 Letters written that we could have read 
 Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead 
 And had this put to bed 
 But I'd be lyin' still if I said 
 I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself 
 How come you can be a lord and a loser? 
 How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? 
 A good dad, but a bad husband 
 Why are you a good father? 
 A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said) 
 Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply) 
 But there's always another side to a good father 
 A great dad, but a bad husband 
 We brought out the worst in each other 
 Someone had to make the sparring end 
 'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me 
 And I don't wanna see that side again 
 But I'm sorry, Kim 
 More than you could ever comprehend 
 Leaving you was fucking harder than 
 Sawing off a fucking body limb 
 Once upon a time we're all we had 
 Maybe that's what drew us 
 To each other, it was true love 
 Shit we never knew was possible 
 We might have loved each other too much 
 And maybe that's what made us do what 
 We did to each other, all the screw-ups 
 'Cause you always thought that you was 
 More in love with me, and I was thinking 
 I was more in love than you was 
 For all the times that we thought it worked 
 Till we saw how wrong we were 
 When the dust settles now and all the dirt 
 If I touch the rawest nerve 
 All I want is for us not to hurt 
 And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words 
 But I just heard "Mockingbird" 
 And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts 
 The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds 
 I've caused a few and so have you 
 Or argue whose fault it was partly yours 
 Partly mine, but really no one's 
 This is so tough, I'm getting choked up 
 Oh fuck it, we both suck 
 We broke up, got back together 
 We both thought we had forever 
 Not bad people, just bad together 
 We were so nuts, backstabbed each other 
 Another blow struck 
 But there's no duckin' this blow 
 'Cause it's over and it's closure 
 But I'm not so sure how to close this 
 I just don't know how some people can be so good 
 At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother 
 Shit, it's no wonder 
 How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser? 
 How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? 
 A good dad, but a bad husband 
 Why are you a good father? 
 A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said) 
 Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply) 
 But there's always another side to a good father 
 A great dad, but a bad husband
