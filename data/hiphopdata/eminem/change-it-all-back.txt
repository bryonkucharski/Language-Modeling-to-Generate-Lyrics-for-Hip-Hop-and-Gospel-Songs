 (Switch-B) 
 Yo, 
 If I could start from scratch, I'd change most of it, 
 If you gave me your trust, I wouldn't of broken it, 
 I shoulda helped you out, back in 97', 
 Shit I wouldn't of let you go I woulda made your life heaven 
 I woulda hushed my mouth, gave my shit up, 
 I woulda minded my own business, n not let things get fucked, 
 Up, I woulda gone to church, maybe become a saint, 
 Erased this so-called picture we paint, 
 I woulda bin a soldier, no matter what shit 
 I woulda bin perfect, the man you want-ed 
 I never woulda slacked, now this is a fact 
 I never woulda rhymed, ova this track 
 If you didn't want it, I never woulda rapped, 
 But this is my life 'n' we can't change that 
 I woulda bin there, I never woulda tried 
 I would never want to live, I never woulda lied 
 I woulda changed it all back, to the past you see, 
 I never woulda let you put your fingers on me 
 I woulda let you be, keep my hands off the gun, 
 I never woulda changed, never try for number 1 
 I would never of intervened, just you 'n' your son, 
 N now I'm revelating, putting it all into a song 
 I would never of invited you to any show I did, 
 I wouldn't of wanted you to show, even though you did 
 I would never shed a tear for a girl I can't stand, 
 I never woulda back-talked, never raised a hand 
 I would never want you to think, that this shit was planned, 
 I woulda let you go, but I didn't think you'd understand 
 That we could never be together, I could never be your man, 
 But if I could turn back time I wouldn't put you through this again 
 I never woulda thought, that we could be buddies, 
 I never woulda asked for any pennies of your money 
 But its just the way you were, you were so cunning, 
 That's why I couldn't be your man, n you couldn't be my honey 
 Now I gotta start from scratch, change my whole past, 
 I'd change it all, make sure I never asked, 
 You out on a date 'cause if I knew it would never last 
 I woulda forgotten all about you 'n' erased you from the cast 
 I don't make shit up, I speak truth if I'm rapping 
 But if I could go back in time, 'us' never woulda happened 
 Baby I'm sorry 
 It all ended in a hurry 
 I didn't wanna cause no worries 
 But now I gotta leave... 
 (Konman) 
 Yo yo ayo 
 I'm fed up wid bein rejected 
 Detected, by your radar 
 You heard me and you ejected the tape 
 No there's no escape 
 I can't believe there's no one here to see my true self, all they remember of me is rape 
 I try, I fail, I sigh I lie in my bedroom waitin for another world, I sleep, I die 
 In a dream waitin for you to come and sweep me away 
 It'll never come, it's like I'm dreamin' on hennesay. 
 I'm waitin for the girl that likes me for who I am 
 And looks past the shit in my life full barrier like a dam 
 This ain't no piss take 
 Words be spillin like a lake 
 And I wouldn't give to shits if you diss this like I'm a fake 
 I'm waitin for my eyes to awake, 'cause I've just excepted this reality 
 And there is a reason why a lot of people are still mad at me 
 From year 5, year, 6 it ended at year 7 
 My trouble years, this is true like the destruction of 9/11 
 I went down the wrong path girl but I promise 
 If you take me in now, I won't make a mistake 
 Or be a misogynist.
