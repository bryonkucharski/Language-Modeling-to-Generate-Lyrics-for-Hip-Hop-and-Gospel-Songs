People 
 It feels so good to be back 
 Ladies and gentleman 
 Introducing the new and 
 Improved you know who 
 Never been the type to bend or budge 
 The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush 
 I'm the centerpiece, you're a maltese, I'm a pitbull off his leash 
 All this peace-talk can cease 
 All these people i had to leave in limbo 
 I'm back now I've come to release this info 
 I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple 
 Cannabitch, don't want no beef with slim, no 
 Not even on my radar 
 So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off 
 And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos 
 From seance to seance 
 So come on now, let's all get on now 
 Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time 
 Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout 
 Let your hair down, square dance with me 
 So come on now, let's all get on now 
 Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time 
 Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout 
 Let your hair down, square dance with me 
 Let your hair down to the track, Yeh, kick on back 
 (boo) 
 The boogie-monster of rap, yeh, the man's back 
 With a plan to ambush this Bush administration 
 Mush the senates face in and push this generation 
 Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin' 
 You might not like This white hot light 
 that im under no wonder I look so sunburnt 
 Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned 
 Oh no, I won't leave won't go nowhere 
 Doh-si-doh oh! yo! ho! hello there 
 Oh yeh! don't think I won't go there 
 Go to Beirut and do a show there 
 Yeh you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted 
 When you're at band camp thinkin' the crap cant happen 
 Till you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin 
 Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrappin' 
 Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin' 
 Fuckin' assassins hijackin' amtracks crashin' 
 All this terror, America demands action 
 Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin' 
 To join the army, or what you'll do for their navy 
 You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18 
 You're on a plane now eatin' their food and their baked beans 
 I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me 
 Crazy insane or insane crazy? 
 When I say Hussein, you say Shady! 
 My views ain't changed still inhumane, wait 
 Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me 
 So come on now, let's all get on now 
 Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time 
 Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout 
 Let your hair down, square dance with me

 Let your hair down, square dance with me 
 Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me 
 Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me 
 Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully 
 There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot me 
 Physcotic hypnotic product I got the antibotic 
 Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada 
 God I talk alot of cum-de-lay-la-la-la 
 Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta 
 Keep movin' there's more music to make 
 Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break 
 The monotony, what's gotten into me? 
 Drugs, rock and hennesey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies 
 On your knees, got you under siege 
 Somebody you would give a lung to be 
 Hun-ga-ry like a fucking younger me 
 Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free 
 Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny I have the money 
 To have you killed by somebody who has nothing 
 I pass bluffing, pass the K-Y 
 Let's get ready for some intense serious ass fucking 
 So come on now, let's all get on now 
 Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time 
 Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout
