Whatever 
 Dre just let it run 
 Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit 
 Ey yo this song is for anyone 
 Fuck it just shut up and listen 
 Ey yo 
 I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags 
 And this bag, of this weed 
 It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this 
 On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
 And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
 And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve 
 All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it 
 The stress has been eating me, recently 
 Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully 
 But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 
 When you freaks see me out in the streets 
 When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me 
 I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing 
 I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think 
 I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
 No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
 In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you 
 Go call you a lawyer 
 File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
 I'm tired of all you 
 I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me 
 And I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 Radio won't even play my jam 
 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 I don't know it's just the way I am 
 Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
 With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
 The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 
 And all of this controversy circles me and it seems 
 Like the media immediately points a finger at me 
 So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky 
 Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
 When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
 'Cause they full of shit too 
 When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school 
 And they blame it on Marilyn 
 And the heroin, where were the parents at? 
 And look at where it's at 
 Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see 
 An upper class city having this happening 
 Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
 But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel 
 That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 
 And I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 Radio won't even play my jam 
 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 I don't know it's just the way I am 
 I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
 That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
 And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
 I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is" 
 And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
 They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
 And I just do not got the patience 
 To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
 Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
 'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
 So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
 What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what 
 When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
 You've been driving me crazy 
 I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
 And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit 
 In the bathroom without someone standing by it 
 No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 
 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 Radio won't even play my jam 
 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
 In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
 I don't know it's just the way I am
