Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak 
 When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up 
 But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength 
 And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up 
 And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face. 
 Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em 
 Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em 
 'Cause when I am not, then I'm a stop pinnin' 'em and 
 I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem 
 Subliminal thoughts, when I'm a stop sendin' 
 'Em, women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom 
 Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not 
 Get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough 
 Now don't think I won't hit you, 'cause I'm popular 
 I got a P-90-Roog that'll pop at ya 
 Catch you slippin' I'm a give ya what I got for ya 
 My clip loaded for 16 shots for ya 
 Ya'never had a hot gun on ya waist or blood on ya shoes 
 Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you 
 Homie you ain't been through 
 What I been through 
 You not like me 
 And I'm not like you 
 I'm like a animal when I spit it's crazy 
 Got semi-autos that put wholes in niggas tryna play me 
 One shot is not enough, you need at least an oozie to move me 
 After 4 bottles of don 
 The kid start feelin' woozie 
 I write my life 
 You write what you've seen in gangsta movies 
 I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me 
 I find my space at the top 
 I got this rap shit locked 
 I've never heard of you 
 You've heard of me, I'll murder you 
 Spit shells at your convertable 
 As long as you notice 
 Richard Poor hallows still go through ya door 
 This is war 
 You scared of me 
 Your not prepared for me 
 The Kid is back 
 50 Cent I know you like that 
 The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villiana 
 Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners 
 Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it 
 Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us 
 You hear it a lot lyrics to shock, 
 Is it a miracle 
 Or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up? 
 Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot 
 Listen up, 
 You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck 
 Till the roof comes off, 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burn out 
 I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 Am I high, perhaps? 
 I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' 
 You get when you're real, and you spit and people are feelin' ya shit 
 This is your moment, 
 And every single minute you get try'n hold on to it 
 'Cause you may never get it again 
 So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can 
 And when your run is over 
 Just admit when it's at it's end 
 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in 
 I got a list 
 Here's the order of my list that it's in - 
 It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac 
 Where my thugs at 
 Huh, increase the doses, bustin' whoever closest 
 Thug livin', hell or prison, never losin my focus 
 I'm makin' money moves manditory 
 In a discussion my past records tell a story 
 Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin' 
 Till the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings 
 Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain 
 I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list 
 So I laugh till I cry, when the law come get me 
 No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds 
 In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me 
 Livin' carefree, till I'm buried - and if they dare me 
 I'm bustin' on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly 
 A man of military means in my artillery 
 Watchin over me through every murder scene 
 From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die 
 Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry 
 And still, we try to change the past, in vain 
 Never knowin' if this game'll last, feelin' ashamed 
 Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul? 
 Got tired of small time livin', niggaz tellin' me no 
 I got MINE, FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality 
 Jealous-ass bustaz 
 I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time 
 Well here it is nigga here it is 
 No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef till I burn 
 Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned 
 And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social 
 Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em 
 Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu 
 Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you 
 And if the cops come arrest me in the evening 
 Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the mornin 
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin' blowed out 
 High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify 
 Strikes, walkin' close to my third, I live a trouble life 
 And if you dream be a part of my team 
 From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends 
 Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz 
 Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart, what is he thinkin' 
 About to go against me?, smart 
 And it's absurd how people hang on every word 
 I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve 
 But I'll never be served, my 
 Spot is forever reserved 
 If I ever leave Earth 
 That would be the death of me first 
 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could 
 Ever be worse that's why I'm 
 Clever when I put together every verse 
 My thoughts are sporadic, I act like 
 I'm an addict 
 I rap like I'm addicted to smack, 
 Like I'm Kim Mathers 
 But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles 
 The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers 
 So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin' 
 At them, the track is on some 
 Battlin' rap who wants some static 
 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that 
 I'm Slim matters 
 A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest 
 Until the roof, (Until the roof) 
 The roof comes off (The roof comes off) 
 Until my legs, (Until my legs) 
 Give out from underneath me, 
 I, I will not fall, 
 I will stand tall 
 Feels like no one can 
 Beat me
