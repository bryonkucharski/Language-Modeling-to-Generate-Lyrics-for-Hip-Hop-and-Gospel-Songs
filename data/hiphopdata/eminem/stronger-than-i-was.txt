You used to say, that I'd never be 
 Nothing without you and I'd believe 
 I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe 
 Just lay here with me, baby hold me please 
 And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees 
 And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave 
 Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze and you'd laugh 
 And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me 
 And you must hate me, why do you date me 
 If you say I make you sick 
 And you've had enough of me 
 I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge 
 But you won't break me, you'll just make me 
 Stronger than I was 
 Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just 
 Fine without you 
 And if I stumble, I won't crumble 
 I'll get back up and uhhh 
 But I'mma still be humble, when I scream fuck you 
 'Cause I'm stronger than I was 
 A beautiful face is all that you had 
 'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad 
 But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave 
 Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please 
 And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees 
 And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave 
 'Cause you left and you took everything I had left 
 And left nothing, nothing for me 
 So please don't wake me from this dream baby 
 We're still together in my head 
 And you're still in love with me 
 Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead 
 But you won't break me, you'll just make me 
 Stronger than I was 
 Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just 
 Fine without you 
 And if I stumble, I won't crumble 
 I'll get back up and uhhh 
 And I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you" 
 'Cause I'm stronger than I was 
 You walked out, I almost died 
 It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized 
 Felt like I was in for a long bus ride 
 I'd rather die than you not be by my side 
 Can't count how many times I vomited, cried 
 Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh 
 We were Bonnie and Clyde 
 No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde 
 I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie 
 It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die 
 'Cause if you could've, took my life you would've 
 It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the 
 Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, should've 
 Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time 
 No one could hurt me like you coulda 
 Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that, bite me bitch chew on a 19 footer 
 'Cause this morning I finally stood up 
 Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the 
 First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams 
 And a life we coulda 
 Had and we could've been 
 But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in 
 Pulling myself out of the dumps once again 
 I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit 
 I'mma be late for the pity party 
 But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again 
 Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends 
 I'm done being your punching bag 
 It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary 
 Two years, but you left on the first of May 
 I wrote it on the calendar, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say 
 But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay 
 And I thank you, 'cause you made me 
 A better person than I was 
 But I hate you, 'cause you drained me 
 I gave you all, you gave me none 
 But if you blame me, you're crazy 
 And after all that's said and done 
 I'm still angry, yeah I may be 
 I may never trust someone 
 But you won't break me, you'll just make me 
 Stronger than I was 
 Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just 
 Fine without you 
 And if I stumble, I won't crumble 
 I'll get back up and uhhh 
 And I'ma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you" 
 'Cause I'm stronger than I was
