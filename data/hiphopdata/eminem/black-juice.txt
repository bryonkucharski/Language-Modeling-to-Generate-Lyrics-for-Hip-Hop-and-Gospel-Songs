{Just pull the plug! 
 People say that I'm a bad influence 
 I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it 
 They say I'm suicidal 
 Teenagers' newest idol 
 C'mon do as I do 
 Go ahead get mad and do it}

 Eminem: 
 Hand me an .8 
 Beam me up and land me in space 
 I'm a sit on top of the world {I'm here 
 And shit on Brandy and Mase 
 I'm more than I'll 
 Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {ah 
 Human horror film 
 But with a lot funnier plot 
 And people goin' feel me 'cause I'm a still be 
 The mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup 
 As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot 
 I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht 
 But I would like an award 
 For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source 
 And a wardrobe I can afford 
 Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford 
 And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for 
 Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like 
 A middle finger sideways flippin' me off 
 No shit I'm a grave danger to my health 
 Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

 Eminem: 
 I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners 
 Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
 I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior 
 Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch 
 I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth 
 With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse 
 And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate 
 Since the third time that I failed 9th grade 
 You probably think that I'm a negative person 
 Don't be so sure of it 
 I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon 
 I laugh at the sight of death 
 As I fall down a cement flight of steps (ah) 
 And land inside a bed of spider webs 
 So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend 
 Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again 
 Shit, why not? Blow your brain out 
 I'm blowing mine out 
 Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

 Eminem: 
 My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist 
 Make you satanistic 
 Make you take the pistol to your face 
 And place the clip and cock it back 
 And let it go until your brains 
 Are rippin' out your skull so bad 
 To sew you back would be a waste of stitches 
 I'm not a "Role Model, " I don't wanna babysit kids 
 I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business 
 And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off 
 Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin' me to dishwash 
 I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got 
 You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got 
 And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got 
 I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much 
 And Just the Two of Us 
 That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life 
 It's just words on a mic. 
 So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig 
 But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
