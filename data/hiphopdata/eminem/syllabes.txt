(Eminem) 
 If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it 
 Then so be it 
 Cause nowadays these kids, jeez 
 Don't give a shit bout lyrics 
 All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it 
 Long as they can go to the club and get blitz 
 Pick up some chicks and get some digits 
 And the DJ's playing them hits 
 Oh this my jam, this my sh-t 
 We don't know a word to a verse, 
 All we know is the chorus 
 Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us 
 And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched 
 'Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits 
 Is it the beat, is it the rap 
 Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap 
 And how do we adapt and get TRL votes 
 When 13 year olds control the remote 
 And Ashley's got a brand new nose 
 We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables 
 (Jay-Z) 
 If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat 
 Than I'm gon feature EM and get rich 
 And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro 
 Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow 
 Bang bang look at the way my chain glow 
 The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh 
 The f-ck am I busting my brain for? 
 Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango 
 You call this a lame flow 
 You bought the shit 
 I guess you to blame too 
 I just found the angle 
 No more reality flow 
 I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show 
 Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97 
 And call my publicist tell her we impressed heaven 
 No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet 
 So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em? 
 Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable 
 (Dr Dre) 
 They said 30's the new 20 
 Funny, must mean 40's the new 30 
 Interesting cause ever since then it's been innocence 
 An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half 
 Of the shit coming out right now 
 It's all trash 
 The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed 
 Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em 
 Then what? Detox drops what we got then 
 So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do 
 Gambling every time we put a record out 
 Just looking for that hook 
 (Eminem) 
 (Wait Dre look) 
 Shorty I love you 
 And you love me too 
 We were meant to be cause shorty 
 You love me 
 And I love you too 
 And I promise I'll be true to you 
 (50 Cent) 
 Go shorty, it's your birthday 
 You made it just in time to hear my wordplay 
 It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's 
 And run G for days used to see how I get hoes 
 I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe 
 I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo's 
 Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's 
 Don't f-ck with the dodo's, I sling for dumb hoes 
 I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke 
 You f-ck around, you could get your ass smoked 
 Look, it's not a game, me B, I ain't playing 
 Beep behind me player, so you here anyway 
 You don't hear what I'm saying 
 Me fin-nini-na 
 Fee-fi-dididee-yay 
 Just give me my check and I'll be on my way 
 Sunny bunny money and funny 
 You ain't even listening and I just took your money 
 (Stat Quo) 
 There once was a time everywhere he turned 
 Shady aftermath was all ya heard 
 But they say 50 sang too much 
 And Em got soft 
 And they say Dre just fell the f-ck off 
 Well f-ck the f-ck offs 
 All y'all eat soft, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh! 
 New syllables eat ball, ya f-cks off's 
 Your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off 
 East, south, midwest, even up north 
 Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk 
 All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost 
 Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk 
 (Ca$hi$) 
 Shady made me for bringing it back 
 For the history of rap 
 It's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap 
 What happened to just spittin' about living in the muthaf-cking city you at 
 In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama 
 King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma 
 I'm everything, anything, you could never be 
 It's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep 
 I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind 
 I repeat every evil deed done of mine 
 No rest contest, contract to sign 
 By blood I'm in this squad for life 
 Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime 
 I'm the reason you guys won't say that line 
 I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z 
 I'm Rosemary's baby 
 (Eminem) 
 Shorty I love you 
 And you love me too 
 We were meant to be cause shorty 
 You love me 
 And I love you too 
 And I promise I'll be true to you 
 (Talking) 
 It is not about lyrics anymore, 
 It is not about lyrics anymore 
 Its about a hot beat, a hot beat 
 Its about a hot beat, a hot beat 
 A hot hot hot beat 
 And a catchy hook 
 A hot hot hot beat 
 And a catchy hook 
 Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are 
 I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow 
 Now get out there and sell some God-damn records
