It's all bad now man, it's all bad 
 It's all fucked up now 
 Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo 
 I just want the whole world to know: 
 That I did not start this, but I will finish it 
 Comin' up it never mattered was color you was 
 If you could spit then you could spit, that's it, that's what it was 
 Back when, motherfuckers was straight back packin 
 Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap 
 For the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped 
 And you hyped 'cause you last and you might whoop some ass 
 If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man 
 And you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column 
 At The Source was like, the only source of light 
 When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like 
 You were the shit, now it's like the least you get 
 Three and a half now just means you a piece of shit 
 Four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas, 
 Or Benzino shit I don't eben think you realize 
 You playin' with motherfuckers lives, I done watched Dre 
 Get fucked on The Chronic, probably 'cause I was on it 
 Now you fucked me outta my mics twice I let it slide 
 I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five 
 Shit I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin' 
 I swear to God I never lie I bet that's why 
 You let that bitch give me that bullshit review 
 I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit we knew 
 You'd probly try to fuck us with Obie and 50 too 
 {(::Haach-poo::)} 
 Fuck a relationship we through 
 No more Source with street credit, them days is dead 
 Ray's got A-Ks to Dave May's head 
 Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread 
 Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head 
 That I am not afraid, hes just a fuckin' waste of lead 
 On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple 
 So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed 
 This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed 
 You don't know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk 
 Put me on your fuckin' cover just sell your little sell out mag 
 I ain't mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad 
 You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about? ya 
 Lets talk about how your puttin' you own son out there 
 And to try to eat off him, 'cause you missed your boat 
 Your never gonna float bitch you're just too old 
 No wonder you're sore now, lordy ya board now 
 I'm pushin thirty you kickin forty's door down 
 Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me 
 All you do is cheat me out of quotables but you know 
 That you'll always see me on your TV 
 'Cause you gotta stay up till three in the mornin 
 To see your video played once on BET 
 So he-he-he who has the last laugh? 
 Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff 
 Kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back 
 Just know that Benzinos wack 
 No matter how many times I say he's stan, hell never blow jack 
 Your better off tryin' to bring R-S-O back 
 Look at your track record that's how far it goes back 
 Its extortion and Ray owns a prportion 
 So half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston 
 Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him 
 And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest 
 Fakest, wannabe gangster in New York 
 And its pitiful, 'cause I never woulda said shit to you if you'd kept your mouth shut 
 Bitch now what? hit it clue, spit it slay 
 New shit, exclusive yo lantern, yo whoo kid 
 You know what to do with this: use it 
 I'm through, this is stupid, I can't believe I stooped to this 
 Bullshit to do this... 
 And who you callin a bitch? Bitch. You owe me.
