Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
 Ay yo 50 
 Whut I tell you 
 We ain't even have to say shit 
 They did it 
 Ha ha 
 Monkey see monkey do 
 They'll never make the first move 
 Just let 'em come to you 
 'Cause they gon always say and do 
 What the other one do 
 So let 'em come to you 
 The rest'll just follow suit 
 Monkey see monkey do 
 Tweedle dee tweedle dum 
 If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come 
 Now here they come like we expected 
 Now we just set 'em up 
 Check mate motherfucker 
 Game's over we won 
 Tweedle dee tweedle dum 
 Doesnt take much 
 For me to race up and stank up 
 When motherfuckers hate your guts 
 You don't even gotta say much 
 For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper 
 Like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush 
 I can't explain what it is my brain does 
 But however it works its insane just plain nuts 
 And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous 
 It's a whole combination of things 
 It takes nuts 
 And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up 
 I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks 
 For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us 
 I'm paitently waitin for the day 
 I'm anxious 
 To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt 
 You're drunk you ain't tough 
 Whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas 
 This is me talkin' motherfucker this ain't drugs 
 You wanna pop shit 
 Wake up 
 Then make up 
 Fuck that 
 It's to late chump now face up 
 I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does 
 Opens up his jaws to say somethin' to rattle my name off 
 Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off 
 So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw 
 And give him the surgery that he came for 
 Till I peel the pain off 
 I never been shot but I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth 
 'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain 
 When they tried to rush him and lost 
 And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it 
 I don't stop 
 Only thing that I wait for is the day that I don't gotta report to probate court 
 Cause ima give you all the reason to hate more 
 'Cause I've been holdin' my tongue till I got a sprained jaw 
 Alot of rappers on my list 
 It just ain't ja 
 And ima read the motherfucker off come April 
 You pussies think I went soft cause 8 mile 
 When I come back 
 I'll be shootin more than just paint balls 
 Trust me 
 Monkey see monkey do 
 They'll never make the first move 
 Just let 'em come to you 
 'Cause they gon always say and do 
 What the other one do 
 So let 'em come to you 
 The rest'll just follow suit 
 Monkey see monkey do 
 Tweedle dee tweedle dum 
 If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come 
 Now here they come like we expected 
 Now we just set 'em up 
 Check mate motherfucker 
 Game's over we won 
 Tweedle dee tweedle dum 
 Fuckin' dummies 
 This ain't chess 
 You playin' motherfuckin checkers 
 This shit is all day man it's too easy 
 We playin' chess you playin' checkers 
 You bout to get your motherfuckin asses jumped 
 Fuckin' punks 
 And by the way 
 We ain't just talkin' to one person 
 We talkin' to every-motherfuckin-body who wants to bring it 
 'Cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it 
 So bring it 
 Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man 
 It's all fucked up now 
 What the fuck am I s'posed to do now? 
 Huh? 
 What the fuck am I s'posed to do? 
 Haha
