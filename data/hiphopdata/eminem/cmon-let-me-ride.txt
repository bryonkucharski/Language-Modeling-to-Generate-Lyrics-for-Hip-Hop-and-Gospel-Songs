If you got a sweet tooth, 
 You can taste my watermelons 
 If the swing set bores you 
 I can show you all my talents 
 I can wear a tail, like all the b-tches can't 
 You can have all this, boy! 
 And there's only one thing that I want from you 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 We can get a little more physical 
 Baby, after all, it's only natural 
 Yeah, come in, come in, come in 
 Run in, run in, run in 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 I want to ride my bicycle 
 I want to ride my bike 
 If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid 
 If you get a bee-sting, I can suck out all the poison 
 I can make you last, like all the bitches can't 
 Have I made it clear, boy? 
 There's only one thing that I want from you 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 We can get a little more physical 
 Baby, after all, it's only natural 
 Yeah, come in, come in, come in 
 Run in, run in, run in 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 I'm always fucking with you 
 F-ck you for thinking it's true 
 I'm not like the things in this town 
 They make me blew in my mouth 
 I wanna ride on your bike 
 'Cause you're the boy that I like 
 It's like I oughta sell out for you 
 But your bikes are shiny and new 
 She's distracted, by my reflectors, man, I can tell the chick is attracted 
 My wheels spoke to her, my swing is a chick magnet 
 Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips 
 With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips 
 Shagging's not something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing sh-t 
 Allen, Iverson has safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice 
 Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat 
 My fantasy is to have you f-ck with a cast tennis 
 Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer 
 I'm the cousin of Godzilla 
 'Cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin' 
 Zig zaggin' up the avenue, pulling these chicks in my antagonist 
 Waggin', screamin' 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 We can get a little more physical 
 Baby, after all, it's only natural 
 Yeah, come in, come in, come in 
 Run in, run in, run in 
 Come on, let me rock your bicycle 
 It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle 
 I want to ride my bicycle 
 I want to ride my bike
