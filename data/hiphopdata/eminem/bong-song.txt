(Eminem) 
 This thing right here, its letting all the people knowm 
 What burnouts talk about. You know, The Chronic... 
 Ooh that buds look scandolous, 
 You hit it too hard you can't handle this, 
 So you smokin' that thing when you pass it to us, 
 With a look in your eyes so devious, 
 You inhale with all you got, suck it down hard till your seeing dots, 
 And your body's on the ground but your mind is not, 
 Cause your livin' la vida smoke-ah 
 Now your high as a kite (kite, kite) 
 Been tokin' all night (night, night) 
 All night long (all night long) 
 Let me hit that bong, baby, 
 That bong bo-bong bong bong 
 I like to roll a blunt ooh, 
 And smoke it in a pipe too, 
 But best of all, 
 Is that bong bo-bong bong bong 
 You know you love that Canabis, 
 So pull up a chair and come smoke with us, 
 They call me Crisqo I can bake so much, 
 I like to hot box the two of us, 
 Pu-puff kids, till its 4/20, 
 This stuff ain't cheap, I need more money, 
 Buy when I buy that green I got the best they got, 
 'Cause I'm livin' la vida smoke-ah 
 Now I'm high as kite (kite, kite) 
 I been tokin' all night (night, night) 
 All night long (all night long) 
 Let me hit that bong, baby, 
 That bong bo-bong bong bong, 
 I like to roll a blunt ooh, 
 And smoke it in a pipe too, 
 But best of all, 
 Is that bong bo-bong bong bong.
