I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought 
 I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog 
 Night club, shit, I was taught 
 If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park 
 No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all 
 But don't be alarmed if I sound off 
 Something just ain't right with me, dog 
 A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder? 
 Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart 
 I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin' 
 Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit 
 Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct 
 I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith 
 Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock 
 Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet 
 Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic 
 No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement 
 'Cause I have no room for improvement 
 I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in 
 Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content 
 Bar exam, start of insanity 
 Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson 
 Animal snarls, cannibal jaws 
 Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter 
 Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking 
 Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets 
 (Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis 
 Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers 
 I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious 
 What happened, doc? I passed out again 
 Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked 
 Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun 
 Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics 
 Too close to the StairMaster 
 Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it 
 Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover 
 No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it 
 Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich 
 And the cross stitching is a cross mixing 
 Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin 
 Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches 
 Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas 
 But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym 
 With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers 
 And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted 
 Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious 
 Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils? 
 Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall 
 I'll stand there and yell that at a wall 
 Until the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects 
 That I'm battering all shatter and fall 
 'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped 
 I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell 
 But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all get jumped 
 And I'll catch the battery charge, but 
 I got a hunch like your back when it's arching 
 When I start attacking your squadron 
 You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging 
 So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you 
 Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers 
 So get the sack like Wisconsin 
 That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding? 
 You faggots are all gonna do my bidding 
 Don't get dragged to the auction 
 Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all 
 I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this 
 Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass 
 See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave 
 In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping 
 Affable guy next door laughable 
 My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms 
 That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor 
 No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard 
 I got a Magic Johnson 
 It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me 
 If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out 
 Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me 
 I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me 
 Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around 
 And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, Slaughterhouse in a blouse 
 And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist 
 I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony 
 Just so happens she's fond of algae 
 Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete 
 Complete lack of responsibility 
 Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit 
 Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop 
 But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy 
 Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now 
 Five-finger discount 
 Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy 
 Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery 
 Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit 
 ("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde 
 I might relapse, get on some bullshit 
 Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson 
 Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth 
 And have some back and forths 
 And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse 
 And perform "Fack" in concert ("Fack" plays) 
 Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album 
 Now that was awesome 
 It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that 
 Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around) 
 And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama? 
 Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre 
 Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama? 
 Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah 
 Still get along with this voice cause that's the "Monster" 
 So do-see-do with the (na-ah) sociopath 
 Everyone who knows me knows that 
 What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio 
 (Na-ah) She loves the way I lie 
 Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow 
 Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole 
 That my disguise is pants, but they on fire 
 So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off (fart sound) 
 Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking 
 I'm wrapping up all the presents 
 In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em 
 Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off 
 Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him 
 Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond 
 Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I 
 Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier 
 But classic rock acid rap is the genre 
 Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith 
 And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula, Chocula 
 Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners 
 I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em 
 Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna
