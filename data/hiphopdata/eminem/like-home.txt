Yeah, shout to everybody 
 Who's been on this trip with me 
 You don't have to agree 
 But if you feel like me 
 Someone get this Aryan a sheet 
 Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached 
 Everybody on your feet 
 This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street 
 This chump barely even sleeps 
 All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats 
 While he looks like a canary with a beak 
 Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
 He's tryin' to divide us 
 The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us 
 'Cause nothin' inside drives us like this fight does 
 Similar to when two cars collide 'cause 
 Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one 
 But here the jaws of life come 
 To pull us from the wreckage that's what we get pride from 
 When we can't wear stars and stripes 
 'Cause this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal 
 But there's always tomorrow still 
 If we start from the scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal 
 And band together for Charlottesville 
 And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals 
 Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter 
 Let's start from zero, this is our renewal 
 Spray tan, get ride of, get a brand new, better 
 America, and here's to where we're from 
 And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up) 
 Here's to the land that made me 
 And made me who I am, who I am (hands up) 
 Here's to the land that raised me 
 This one's for the only place that really knows me 
 From the cracks in the road that drove me 
 There's no place like home 
 Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya? 
 Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya 
 You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off Nazi 
 I do not see a way y'all differ 
 And all you got are race cards, bigot 
 The swastika with your name carved in it 
 Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off 
 And you just lick the plate off 
 So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos 
 So basically, you ate off Hitler 
 But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk 
 Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us 
 'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up 
 So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up 
 Against this train wreck and take a stand 
 Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag 
 To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner", this man 
 Just praised a statue of General Lee 'cause he generally 
 Hates the black people, degrades Hispanics 
 Take it back to the Shady national convention 
 Wish I woulda spit on it before I went 
 To shake his hand at the event 
 Or maybe had the wherewithal 
 To know that he was gonna try to tear apart 
 Our sacred land we cherish and stand for 
 So, hands in the air, let's hear it for 
 The start of a brand new America 
 Without him and be proud of where we're from 
 And here's to where we're from 
 And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up) 
 Here's to the land that made me 
 And made me who I am, who I am (hands up) 
 Here's to the land that raised me 
 This one for the only place that really knows me 
 From the cracks in the road that drove me 
 There's no place like home 
 I won't give up 
 I won't give up on my home, that so many died for 
 You already know that I won't give up 
 I won't give up on my home, that so many died for 
 You already know 
 There's no place like home, no place like home 
 Wherever I go, no place like home 
 No place like home, no place like home 
 Wherever I go 
 Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up) 
 Here's to the land that made me 
 And made me who I am, who I am (hands up) 
 Here's to the land that raised me 
 This one for the only place that really knows me 
 From the cracks in the road that drove me 
 There's no place like home
