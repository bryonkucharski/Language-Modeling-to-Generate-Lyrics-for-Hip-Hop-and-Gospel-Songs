A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions 
 A lot of people think that what I say on records 
 Or what I talk about on a record 
 That I actually do it in real life or that I believe in it 
 Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that 
 I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it 
 Well, shit if you believe that then I'll kill you 
 You know why? 'Cause I'm a 
 Criminal 
 Criminal 
 You goddamn right 
 I'm a criminal 
 Yeah, I'm a criminal 
 My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge 
 That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez 
 Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest 
 Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's, "Yes" 
 Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic 
 Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' 
 That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em 
 They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get a hold of 'em 
 Hey, it's me, Versace 
 Whops, somebody shot me! 
 And I was just checkin' the mail 
 Get it? Checkin' the 'male'? 
 How many records you expectin' to sell 
 After your second LP sends you directly to jail? 
 C'mon, relax guy, I like gay men 
 Right, Ken? Give me an Amen 
 Amen 
 Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus 
 Heal this child, help us destroy these demons 
 Oh, and please send me a brand new car 
 And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital 
 Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher 
 You can't reach me, my mom can't neither 
 You can't teach me a goddamn thing 
 'Cause I watch TV and Comcast cable 
 And you ain't able to stop these thoughts 
 You can't stop me from toppin' these charts 
 And you can't stop me from droppin' each March 
 With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards 
 Who? 
 And to think, it's just little ol' me 
 Mr. "Don't Give A Fuck" still won't leave 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal 
 But I don't gotta say a word 
 I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin' 
 I don't take shit from no one 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal 
 I don't gotta say a word 
 I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin' 
 I don't take shit from no one 
 My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes and speed 
 The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed 
 It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she 
 Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me 
 I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed 
 But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised? 
 So as I got older and I got a lot taller 
 My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger 
 I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker 
 Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word 
 My morals went when the president got oral sex 
 In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee 
 Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me 
 You can't miss me, I'm white 
 Blonde-haired and my nose is pointy 
 I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die 
 In plane crashes and laughs 
 As long as it ain't happened to him 
 Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined 
 The maniac's in 
 Replacin' the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today 
 He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place 
 Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face 
 Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place 
 I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away 
 I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh? 
 I'm a criminal 
 Aight look 
 Uh huh 
 Just go up in that motherfucker 
 Get the motherfuckin' money 
 And get the fuck up outta there 
 Aight 
 I'll be right here waitin' on you 
 Aight 
 Yo, Em 
 What? 
 Don't kill nobody this time 
 Aw right, goddamn, fuck 
 Hi 
 How you doin'? 
 How can I help you? 
 Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal 
 Okay 
 Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch 
 And I won't kill you 
 What? Oh my God, don't kill me 
 I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around 
 Just don't kill me, I have two kids at home 
 I said, I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you 
 Don't kill me 
 Hurry the fuck up 
 Thank you 
 Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it 
 So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it 
 So I'll be disguised in it 
 And if anybody identifies the guy in it 
 I'll hide for five minutes 
 Come back, shoot the eyewitness 
 Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business 
 Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets 
 This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet 
 If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts 
 Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck 
 You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough 
 To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut 
 Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up 
 To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass 
 And if it's not a rapper that I make it as 
 I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal 
 But I don't gotta say a word 
 I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin' 
 I don't take shit from no one 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal 
 I don't gotta say a word 
 I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin' 
 I don't take shit from no one 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal 
 I don't gotta say a word 
 I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin' 
 I don't take shit from no one 
 I'm a criminal 
 'Cause every time I write a rhyme 
 These people think it's a crime 
 To tell 'em what's on my mind 
 I guess I'm a criminal
