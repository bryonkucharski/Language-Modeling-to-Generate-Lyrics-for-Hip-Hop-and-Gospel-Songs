You and me we were the pretenders 
 We let it all slip away 
 In the end what you don't surrender 
 Well the world just strips away 
 Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers 
 Ain't gonna find no miracles here 
 Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin' 
 I got a deal for you right here 
 I ain't lookin' for praise or pity 
 I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch 
 I just want someone to talk to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Just a little of that human touch 
 Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town 
 Ain't no bread from heavenly skies 
 Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood 
 It's just you and me tonight 
 Tell me, in a world without pity 
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much 
 I just want something to hold on to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Just a little of that human touch 
 Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize 
 Well it comes at a hard hard price 
 You can't shut off the risk and the pain 
 Without losin' the love that remains 
 We're all riders on this train 
 So you've been broken and you've been hurt 
 Show me somebody who ain't 
 Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain 
 But, hell, a little touch up 
 And a little paint 
 You might need somethin' to hold on to 
 When all the answers, they don't amount to much 
 Somebody that you could just to talk to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Baby, in a world without pity 
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much 
 I just want to feel you in my arms 
 Share a little of that human touch 
 Share a little of that human touch 
 Feel a little of that human touch 
 Feel a little of that human touch 
 Share a little of that human touch 
 Feel a little of that human touch 
 Give you a little of that human touch 
 Give me a little of that human touch
