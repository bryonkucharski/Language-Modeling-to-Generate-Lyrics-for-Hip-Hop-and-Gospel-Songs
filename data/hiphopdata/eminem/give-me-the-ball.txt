Ayo, let me tell you about my homies, haha 
 My name is Chancey Billups, I'm kinda like a raunchy Phillips 
 Screwdriver, my crew's liver, when you can't sleep and you're still up 
 I get the ball then I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip 
 You prolly got stripped, wanna rumble, no reason to trip 
 I grab her like Gnarles Barkley holds a mic, your snarls spark me 
 I smile like Charles Barkley, come on, I'm hard, guard me 
 Ain't booin', ain't pursuin', no lawsuits, I ain't suin' 
 I know what I'm doin', give me the ball and your life is ruined 
 I'm like Rasheed I remind me of the spirit of Proof 
 I'm heavy, you're lucky, fall in the groove, and I'm on the move 
 I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it 
 Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket 
 LeBron's head, don't respond, there's no back'n'forth 
 This game is mental man, I play it loud 
 I walk away just hush the crowd, you try to touch, sit down 
 Detroit basketball 
 Homie like I told you this is... 
 Detroit basketball 
 Man I don't think you're ready... 
 I get the crowd rolled up like a U-Haul truck 
 Just call me two-balled Chuck 
 Ain't too tall? What? I'll leave Utah stuffed 
 Man I love this game, who the hell you called up 
 You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained 
 All my coins in the bank, and I'm going on the way 
 (I-I-I-I-I-I-I get money) 
 Yeah baby it's true, I'm talkin' to you 
 You already know what to do, just pass it to me 
 It just so happens to be that I adapt on this heat 
 So strap in your seat, I got a grasp on this beat 
 You ain't convinced? Give it to Tayshaun Prince 
 We haven't stay calm since, lead the ball with delayed palm prints 
 Now homie this is (now homie this is) 
 Detroit basketball 
 Homie like I told you this is... 
 Detroit basketball 
 Man I don't think you're ready 
 We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved 
 I said 
 We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
