You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months 
 It's too loud 
 Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them 
 Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot 
 It's too loud 
 Freeze my crown all up in it 
 Slow fire 
 Don't fall on my face 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Don't fall on my- 
 Gotta concentrate against the clock I race 
 Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace 
 Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape 
 Guess I got a chronic case 
 And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face 
 I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say 
 And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways 
 You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid" 
 One last time for Charlemagne 
 If my response is late, it's just how long it takes 
 To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away 
 These rappers are like Hunger Games 
 One minute, they're mocking Jay 
 Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake 
 Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away 
 But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate 
 I've had as much as I can tolerate 
 I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience 
 I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once 
 You want it, Shady? You got it! 
 Don't fall on my face 
 Yeah 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Light him up! 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Rrr 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Look 
 Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it 
 Or have his body baggage zipped 
 The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches 
 And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks 
 Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly 
 Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot 
 Lacking with it, "he ain't spit like this in his last shit" 
 Hoe, you better go back and listen 
 You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up 
 Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup 
 Hopin' that you rappers fall in that 
 Dre said, "Hold your head up" 
 Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew) 
 Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business 
 Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch 
 It's not just 'cause you lack attention 
 It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious 
 If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better 
 Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters 
 The fans waited for this moment 
 Like the feature when I stole this show 
 Sorry if I took forever 
 Don't fall on my face 
 Yeah 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 I won't 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Light him up! 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 It's too easy 
 Just remember-I was here before you 
 And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you 
 Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew 
 Just what the doctor ordered 
 Revenge is the best medicine 
 Increase the dose, unleash the monster 
 Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches 
 So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em 
 See the show, every parasite needs a host 
 Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of 
 All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered 
 Time to separate the sheep from goats 
 And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts 
 When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer 
 A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air 
 Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror 
 That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care 
 But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists 
 On the scale it turns to minus 
 Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started 
 And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone 
 Or I'll show you an Elvis clone 
 Walk up in this house you own 
 Brush my pelvic bone 
 You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote 
 Put my feet up and just make myself at home 
 I belong here, clown! 
 Don't tell me 'bout the culture 
 I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh 
 Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch! 
 It's too loud 
 Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot 
 It's too loud 
 Freeze my crown all up in it 
 Slow fire
