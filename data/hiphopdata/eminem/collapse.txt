Sometimes you feel tired, feel weak 
 When you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up 
 But you gotta search within you, find that inner strength 
 And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation not to give up 
 And not be a quitter no matter how bad 
 You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse 
 Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em 
 Till the day, that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em 
 'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin' 'em 
 And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem 
 Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin' 'em 
 Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom 
 Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop 
 Amoxacillin's just not real enough 
 The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain 
 A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners 
 You are comin' with me, feel it or not 
 You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us 
 You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock 
 Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? 
 Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up 
 You bizzels forgot, slizzel does not give a fuck 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 (Until the roof) 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 (The roof comes off) 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 (Until my legs) 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 (Give out from underneath me) 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 Music is like magic 
 There's a certain feeling you get when you're real 
 And you spit an people are feelin' ya shit 
 This is your moment and every single minute ou spend 
 Tryin' to hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again 
 So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can 
 And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end 
 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in 
 I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in 
 It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie 
 Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me 
 But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lot of envy 
 So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me 
 That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's bothering me 
 Even though half you people gotta fuckin' problem with me 
 You hate it but you know respect you got to give me 
 The press's wet dream like Bobby an' Whitney, Nate hit me 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 (Until the roof) 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 (The roof comes off) 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 (Until my legs) 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 (Give out from underneath me) 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC's heart 
 What is he thinking? I'ma not to go against me, smart 
 And it's absurd how people hang on every word 
 I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve 
 But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved 
 If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first 
 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse. 
 That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse 
 My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict 
 I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers 
 But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles 
 The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers 
 So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em 
 The track is on some battling raps who want some static 
 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters 
 A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 (Until the roof) 
 Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
 (The roof comes off) 
 Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
 (Until my legs) 
 Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out 
 (Give out from underneath me) 
 I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse 
 Until the roof 
 Until the roof 
 The roof comes off 
 The roof comes off 
 Until my legs 
 Until my legs 
 Give out from underneath me 
 I 
 I will not fall 
 I will stand tall 
 Feels like no one could beat me
