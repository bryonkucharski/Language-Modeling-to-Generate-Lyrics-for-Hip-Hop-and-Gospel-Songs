(Intro- talking) 
 {Eminem] 
 Shady, Aftermath 
 (BTOV) {nate dogg] 
 Aye bitch, hey! 
 There she goes shaking that ass on the floor 
 Bumpin and grindin that pole 
 The way she's grindin that pole 
 I think I'm losing control 
 Hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek 
 (Bobby Creek) 
 I'm on the patron 
 In the end I'm gone 
 My eyes ain't clear 
 I'm gone 
 So she hear me wrong 
 I'm kinda in the zone 
 Cause the DJ playin' my song 
 Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known 
 I'm from Atlanta 
 So southern ain't just part of my grammar 
 I can up and cock the hammer 
 For any nigga wid Hammer 
 But I came here to get on goose and tropicana 
 Get loose put some more of my juice 
 In your caboose 
 Sippin everything from white grain 
 To deuce juice 
 With nothin' to gain 
 But my grace and loose tooths 
 Eminem came Obie stat and proof too 
 Bobby creek is in the place 
 The name is snoop too 
 But they might been around 
 My drinks is 10 around 
 I can make her spin around 
 If she keep her dinner down 
 Simmer down 
 We can hit the telly when the fun stops 
 And I'll let you in ya work 
 Come sip on my gum drops 
 Yeah 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 Three to the one from the one to the three 
 I met a bad bitch last night in the D 
 Let me tell you how I made her leave with me 
 Conversation and Hennessey 
 I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top 
 Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop 
 If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock 
 And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock 
 Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet 
 It's real easy just follow the beat 
 Don't let that fine girl pass you by 
 Look real close cause strobe lights lie 
 We bout to have a party (turn the music up) 
 Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt) 
 I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut 
 Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up 
 Some girls they act retarded 
 Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it 
 I'm lookin' for a girl 
 That will do whatever the fuck 
 I say everyday she be givin' it up 
 (Nate Dogg- Chorus) 
 Shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 Come on girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 Oh girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 Come on girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 (Eminem) 
 O' Trice! 
 (Obie Trice) 
 One slug 
 Couldn't snuff young 'cause 
 Goodness gracious 
 Haters stay on his nuts 
 One just like a hood rat chick who was curious 
 Serious 
 Full breast, ready to touch 
 Who's that in the cool blue back 
 With a blue new rag 
 Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch 
 Its true that I had a few 
 Obie rollin' with brews 
 Ain't that annual annually knockin' the boots 
 It's on manual 
 The way I knock 'em outta they shoes 
 Talk a little shit 
 Then they anus'll ooze 
 Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang 
 Who 
 It's shady 
 You know the name of the crew 
 You know the aim is to bang you 
 In the mansion 
 With a magnum 
 With a night came to the matinee 
 Mathers, nate, Obie 
 Came to party 
 You better ask somebody 
 (Nate Dogg- Chorus) 
 Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me 
 Come on girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 Oh girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shake that ass for me 
 Come on girl, shake that ass for me, 
 Shady
