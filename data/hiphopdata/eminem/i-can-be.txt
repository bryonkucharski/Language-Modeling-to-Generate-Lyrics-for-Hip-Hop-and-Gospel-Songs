[Eminem](Chorus) 
 'Cause I can be calm, I can be cool, 
 I can be rude, I can do whatever you want me to do 
 Whatever you want me to be, I can be it, 
 Whatever side you want me to show you, just let me know 
 And I'll let you see it, I got a college degree at being 
 The prick if you push me, won't hestitate to stick my dick in you pussies 
 So however you want it, you got it, you can get it 
 Anywhere you like it whichever way you prefer it, 'cause we servin' it. 
 However you want it, Bitch. 
 (Helleva - Verse 1) 
 However, whoever, anytime, whenever, whatever I'm coming with 9's or betta 
 I'll put 2 in your medula oblongota, walk around this bitch worry free 
 Like hakuna matata, get grimey ain't a theme boy I'm used to the drama 
 I take beat to the extreme, man I'll shoot at your momma, man these faggots 
 Done make me lose all my patience, I got all kinds of guns for all occasions 
 Got rap niggas running like Walter Payton, hit 'em with the full matic have em 
 Harlem Shakin' hop on the phone and make a call to Satan, let him know that you coming 
 So when you get there my dogs is waiting I'll rob you an thank ya, blast ya an shank ya 
 Even your man's will be like "NOW THAT NIGGAS GANGSTA" 
 I don't give a fuck who you with or who you get 'cause I'm a lunatic an you a bitch. 
 [Eminem](Chorus) 
 'Cause I can be calm, I can be cool,

 Whatever you want me to be, I can be it, 
 Whatever side you want me to show you, just let me know 
 And I'll let you see it, I got a college degree at being

 (Helleva - Verse 2) 
 I'm king kong, I got "I ain't never scared" on my ringtone, that's my theme song 
 44 with the beam on, if my niggas got drama I'm that shoulder to lean on. 
 Helleva coming through with that soldier fatigue on at they door like DING DONG 
 Show 'em the beef on and once its on, there no fixing it, my killas do this shit 
 For fun, I can't tell 'em "Don't get in it" don't run up on ya whip, put a whole clip in it 
 I tell 'em I owe him one, he'll tell me "don't mention it." You scared to come out, that's all right 
 We gon take shifts and shoot up your house all night. Pop four about yo bushes an unload on yo ass 
 Leave you layin on the street with a hole in yo ass buss a few a come back an run over yo ass 
 If you think a nigga looney you just don't know the half. 
 [Eminem](Chorus) 
 'Cause I can be calm, I can be cool, 
 I can be rude, I can do whatever you want me to do 
 Whatever you want me to be, I can be it, 
 Whatever side you want me to show you, just let me know 
 And I'll let you see it, I got a college degree at being 
 The prick if you push me, won't hestitate to stick my dick in you pussies 
 So however you want it, you got it, you can get it 
 Anywhere you like it whichever way you prefer it, 'cause we servin' it. 
 However you want it, Bitch. 
 (Helleva - Verse 3) 
 Anytime you ready, I could while out or I could be calm an deadly, I'm like oh dog an menace 
 Like tom an belly, I'm a cross between jason saddam and freddy. Tougher than leather, beretta 
 Tuck under the leather, extended clip, make it seem like I'm bussin foreva. When an got me 3 bananas 
 And I stuck 'em together. Leave a muhfucka sick like he under the weather, niggas be like my man sweet 
 You can't beat him at rappin', they be like you wrong as hell, when I see him I'll slap him 
 To be honest I ain't into all that battle rap shit, I got something on my hip 
 You could battle that bitch? it'll lift you off your feet an make you acro-bat-ic 
 Tell a joke an ask a nigga what you laughin' at bitch? He ain't know he could get clapped 
 For that shit go to jail an tell a judge that nigga asked for that shit. 
 [Eminem](Chorus) 
 'Cause I can be calm, I can be cool, 
 I can be rude, I can do whatever you want me to do 
 Whatever you want me to be, I can be it,
