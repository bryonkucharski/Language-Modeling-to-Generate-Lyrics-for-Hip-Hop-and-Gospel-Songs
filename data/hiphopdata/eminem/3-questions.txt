When I born to lose 
 C'mon muthafucker pick and chose 
 Between win or lose 
 Baby shoes, high-heeled shoes 
 Interviews, or kangaroos 
 Skatin down fuckin' avenues 
 Wit you bag full of barbecues 
 And suddenly I blow a fuse 
 God she said I look like a porcupine 
 Would it be better if I took a hike with frankenstein 
 Maybe I'll start thinking of giving my bike to palestine 
 Meet my friend brit 
 She get real pissed off when muthafuckers ain't feelin' her shit 
 She'll make you bleed if you fuck around with her per fit 
 You see her walkin' round, clit ring and all, talkin' your skit 
 K that's enuff for one verse 
 I don't think I cud've done no worse 
 So let me give you one of those that I put real well, gun curse 
 (Chorus) that's part of my story, if you wanna be firm 
 Brit'll put it down your pants, yeah the earthworm 
 Don't wanna be sorry, don't eat the bad germ 
 If you do, just drink the pachiderm 
 Can my songs really make you get up and dance 
 Well if they can, stay seated and take you cup to France 
 I think that bitch still wants that fuckin' poppin' chance 
 Think of 50, dre, and eminem 
 They all battled and got succes and fame 
 Fuck benzino 
 He called my man slim a feminem, see now 
 I never really had much 'pac influence 
 Me had m.mathers and used it awful fluent 
 Part of my life I was taught in fight and anger 
 My people won't let me hide my middle finger 
 But everyday I teach the good things to my little sista's 
 They only 2,3 years younger than me 
 But still need my help to be successful in life, you see 
 And you really shud be givin' that punch rite to me 
 You think I'm violent 
 Well think again, if you want I'll let you alone in the silent 
 With my shit and weed I get high and thow a fit to anyone that gets close to my hand 
 My parents announced they were gonna get a divorce 
 It just became a lot worse 
 The whole opposite of me doin' a verse 
 With a bunny or a horse 
 Infact, what I had I'll never get it back 
 I'll always have this sick mind in me 
 But what the fuck, just let my shit be 
 There's a bug walkin' 'long my ceilin 
 I ain't really fellin 
 Yeah that or this muthafuckin beatin' 
 I luv y'all 
 Fuck me
