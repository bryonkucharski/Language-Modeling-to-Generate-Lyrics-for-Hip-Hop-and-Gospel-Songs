I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed 
 When the world gives you a raw deal 
 Set you off till you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!" 
 When it talks to you like you don't belong 
 Or tells you you're in the wrong field 
 When's something's in your mitochondrial 
 'Cause it latched on to you, like- 
 Knock knock, let the devil in 
 Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin' 
 This medicine's screamin', "L-l-l-let us in!" 
 L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe 
 Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago 
 Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin' 
 Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent 
 Of elephant manure-hell, I meant Kahlúa 
 Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants 
 And blew up my-my-myself again 
 Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin 
 Medal win, went from Hellmann's and being rail thin 
 Filet-o-Fish, to Scribble Jam and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik 
 How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida 
 Proof's room slept on floor of the motel then 
 Dr. Dre said "hell yeah!" 
 And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man 
 And I know they're gonna hate 
 But I don't care, I barely could wait 
 To hit them with the snare and the bass 
 Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced 
 Because they're gonna taste my- 
 Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum 
 Venom, not knowin' with 'em 
 Never gonna slow up in 'em 
 Ready to snap any moment-um 
 Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em 
 They ain't gonna know what hit 'em 
 (When they get bitten with the-) 
 Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum 
 Venom, not knowin' with 'em 
 Never gonna slow up in 'em 
 Ready to snap any moment-um 
 Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em 
 They ain't gonna know what hit 'em 
 (When they get bit with the-) 
 I said knock knock, let the devil in 
 Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen 
 Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one 
 I-i-it's evident I'm not done 
 V-venomous, the thought spun 
 Like your web and you just caught in 'em 
 Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap 
 Be strangled or attacked 
 So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap 
 Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track 
 Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick 
 Throw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin' 
 Into ya, the back of it-just mangled steel 
 My Mustang and your Jeep Wrangler grill 
 With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin 
 Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi 
 Translation, I will probably kill us both 
 When I end up back in India 
 You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you 
 When you're bit with the- 
 Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum 
 Venom, not knowin' with 'em 
 Never gonna slow up in 'em 
 Ready to snap any moment-um 
 Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em 
 They ain't gonna know what hit 'em 
 (When they get bitten with the-) 
 Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum 
 Venom, not knowin' with 'em 
 Never gonna slow up in 'em 
 Ready to snap any moment-um

 (When they get bit with the-) 
 I said knock knock, let the devil in 
 Alien, E-E-Elliot phone home 
 Ain't no telling when this chokehold 
 On this game will end, I'm loco 
 Became a Symbiote, so 
 My fangs are in your throat, ho 
 You're snake bitten with my-venom 
 With the ballpoint pen I'm 
 Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot 
 Tied for the uppercut, tie a couple knots 
 Fired up a Glock, fire, juggernaut 
 Punk rock, bitches goin' down like Yung Joc 
 'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock 
 Why the fuck not? You only get one shot 
 Ate shit till I can't taste it 
 Chased it with straight liquor 
 Then paint thinner then drank till I faint 
 And I wait with a headache 
 And I take anything in rectangular shape 
 Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to 
 'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you 
 So escapin' me is impossible 
 I latch onto you like a-parasite 
 And I probably ruined your parents' life 
 And your childhood too 
 'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on 
 I'm responsible for you retarded fools 
 I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to 
 You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you 
 And I'm the suit, so call me- 
 Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum 
 Venom, not knowin' with 'em 
 Never gonna slow up in 'em 
 Ready to snap any moment-um 
 Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em 
 They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
