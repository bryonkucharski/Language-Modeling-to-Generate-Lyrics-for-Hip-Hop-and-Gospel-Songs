 Every single day, at the bingo hall, 
 That's why my dick is, damn! It's single, small. 
 Didn't blow up! - Just don't give a what? - A cuff?! 
 Didn't blow up! - Just don't give a what? - A cuff?! 
 (DT's fired.) But DT's fired, he's retired! 
 He's not hired - yo! - Plus I'm tired... 
 Of busting and spitting this rhyme non stop, 
 I'm on top - taking records to the pawnshop;
