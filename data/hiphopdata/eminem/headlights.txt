Mom, I know I let you down 
 And though you say the days are happy 
 Why's the power off and I'm fucked up 
 And mom, I know he's not around 
 But don't you place the blame on me 
 As you pour yourself another drink, yeah 
 I guess we are who we are 
 Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
 Maybe we took this too far 
 I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt 
 In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it 
 But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far 
 "Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma 
 You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom 
 Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam 
 Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb 
 Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on 
 But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me 
 You're kicking me out, it's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (Little prick just leave) 
 Ma let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats 
 Why we always at each other's throats, 'specially when dad he fucked us both 
 We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close, nope 
 Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings 
 Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road 
 And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load 
 Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and 
 That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable 
 And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but 
 I guess we are who we are 
 Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
 Maybe we took this too far 
 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though 
 'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow 
 But I'm sorry mama for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry 
 Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause 
 Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes 
 That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio 
 And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us 
 And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but 
 Now the medication's takin' over and your mental state's deteriorating slow 
 And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though 
 But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo 
 All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both 
 Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours 
 But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause 
 One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was 
 Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address 
 But I'dve flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus 
 Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas 
 Someone ever moved them from me, that you could've bet your asses 
 If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em 
 And although one has only met their grandma 
 Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers 
 Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you 
 And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me 
 As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and 
 I saw your headlights as I looked back 
 And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to 
 Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad 
 So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet 
 I guess I had to get this off my chest 
 I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead 
 The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing 
 So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar 
 'Cause you're my ma 
 I guess we are who we are 
 Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
 Maybe we took this too far 
 I want a new life (start over) 
 One without a cause (clean slate) 
 So I'm coming home tonight 
 Well no matter what the cost 
 And if the plane goes down 
 Or if the crew can't wake me up 
 Well just know that I'm alright 
 I was not afraid to die 
 Oh, even if there's songs to sing 
 Well my children will carry me 
 Just know that I'm alright 
 I was not afraid to die 
 Because I put my faith in my new girl 
 So I never say goodbye cruel world 
 Just know that I'm alright 
 I am not afraid to die 
 I guess we are who we are 
 Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
 Maybe we took this too far 
 I want a new life
