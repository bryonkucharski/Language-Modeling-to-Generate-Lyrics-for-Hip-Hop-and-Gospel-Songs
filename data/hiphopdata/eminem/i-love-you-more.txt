Eminem: you still love me? 
 (Kim): (sniffles) 
 Eminem: take this (click, click)...ready? (her sniffle again) 1, 2, 3 (bang bang) 
 The more you, put me through 
 The more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 You say you hate me, I just love you more 
 You don't want me, I just want you more 
 I buy you flowers 
 You throw them at me 
 I know its sad but its making me happy 
 The more that you slap me, 
 The more that it turns me on 
 'Cause you love me 
 And I love you more 
 Its sick but who could ever predict 
 We'd be doin' the same shit 
 We say we do it for our baby, but we don't 
 We do it for us, its lust 
 'Cause neither one of us trusts each other 
 So we fuck till we bust 
 And then we cuss each other, out, 
 We know what its about 
 And shout till I throw you out the house, 
 You throw me out the house, 
 I throw you on the couch, 
 Punch you in the mouth 
 Fist fight till we turn this mother out 
 And apologize after, laughter, pain 
 Its insane, were back in the same chapter again, 
 And its sad but its true, when I'm layin here wit'chu 
 There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause 
 The more you put me through 
 The more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 You say you hate me, I just love you more 
 You don't want me, I just want you more 
 I buy you flowers 
 You throw them at me 
 I know its sad but its making me happy 
 The more that you slap me, 
 The more that it turns me on 
 'Cause you love me 
 And I love you more 
 'Cause I hate you, do you hate me? 
 Good 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry 
 It makes me, wanna just take you 
 And just throw you on the bed 
 And fuck you like I don't even know you 
 You fuck other people and I fuck other people 
 You're a slut but I'm equal, ima mut 
 We're both evil in our ways 
 But neither one of us would ever admit it 
 'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it 
 People make, accusations, people spread rumors, 
 But they ain't got proof 
 Till they do, its just the two of us, it's you and me 
 'Cause any chick can say that she's screwin me 
 But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause you're in deep 
 If you didn't I wouldn't be hitting 
 Yeah I would 'cause the sex is just too damn good 
 If I ran, who would I run to? 
 Who would be this soft and warm 
 So its off and on, usually more off than on 
 But at least we know, 
 That we share this common bond 
 You're the only one I could fuck without a condom on 
 I hope, the only reason that I cope 
 Is 'cause of that fact and plus I can bust in that 
 And that's why 
 The more you put me through 
 The more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 You say you hate me, I just love you more 
 You don't want me, I just want you more 
 I buy you flowers 
 You throw them at me 
 I know its sad but its making me happy 
 The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on 
 'Cause you love me 
 And I love you more 
 I can never understand it, 
 That's why I don't try 
 From junior high, until we both die 
 Its silly oh why, must we try? 
 Is it really so rough? 
 Did we must and always call 
 Each others billy-goat's gruff? 
 Try to pull each others legs, until the other begs, 
 Were lying to ourselves 
 That's the beauty of it, yeah 
 'Cause we truly love each other 
 That's why we always fight, 
 And all we do is shove each other 
 Every other fuckin' night 
 And its clear, it ain't gonna change 
 This pin up rage, we both have, 
 And we both feel like we've been upstaged 
 By someone else, we've both been someone else 
 With someone else 
 The problem is, neither one wont tell 
 It's an addiction, and it can't be fixed 
 Our familys mixed up 
 There's baby sister in the mix 
 And it hurts, 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit 
 And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit 
 And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time, 
 On every song, every lyric and every rhyme, 
 All the hoop-lah, all of the whoopty woo, 
 What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-doo 
 But I won't be made a fool of, 
 If this is true love, you wouldn't do what you did last time, 
 You wouldn't screw up this time, 
 'Cause this time, girl I'm telling you what, 
 You do it again I'm fucking you up, 
 No matter what 
 What you say, what you do, 
 Ima hunt you down till I find you 
 No matter where you run 
 I'll be right there, right behind you 
 And in your nightmares I surround you. 
 I buy you flowers, and candy 
 All the times that you threw them back at me 
 Told me you hate me 
 You gonna hate me more 
 When you find out, 
 You can't escape me whorrrre 
 The more you, put me through 
 The more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 You say you hate me, I just love you more. 
 You don't want me, I just want you more. 
 I buy you flowers 
 You throw them at me 
 I know its sad but its making me happy. 
 The more that you slap me, 
 The more that it turns me on, 
 'Cause you love me 
 And I love you more.
