Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
 Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat 
 Where's Mama? 
 She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
 Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk 
 Now I know what you're thinkin': 
 It's kind of late to go swimmin' 
 But you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
 Who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit 
 Don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
 And don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
 Don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
 And mama said she wants to show how far she can float 
 And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
 It's just a little scratch it don't hurt 
 Her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt 
 Mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
 And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
 Just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
 There's a place called heaven and a place called hell 
 A place called prison and a place called jail 
 And dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one 
 'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 
 And you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
 Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya 
 But for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
 She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
 But I still feel sad that I put her in time out 
 Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
 I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
 Take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
 Humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty 
 Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty 
 You're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water 
 '97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter 
 Just the two of us (sung) 
 Wake up sleepy head we're here 
 Before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the pier 
 Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea 
 Mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear 
 That's why you can't get her to wake 
 But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the lake 
 Here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
 We'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock 
 Ready now, here we go, on the count of three 
 One, two, three... weeeeeeeeee 
 There goes mama splashin' in the water 
 No more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order 
 No more step dada, no more new brother 
 Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her 
 We'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk 
 But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk 
 Just the two of us (sung)
