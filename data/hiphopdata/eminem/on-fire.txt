Heh, yeah, haha 
 You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man 
 You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man 
 Is critics never asked me how my day went 
 Well, I'ma tell 'em 
 Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow 
 Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow 
 You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo' 
 I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole 
 I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro 
 Better hold on a little tighter, here I go 
 Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted 
 As 
 Spider-Man 
 throwin' a spider in the snow 
 So you better get lower than 
 Flo-Rida 
 inside of a low-rider 
 With no tires in the hole 
 Why am I like this, why is winter cold 
 Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's 
 Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets 
 This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault 
 Those are your wounds, this is the salt 
 So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off 
 The Wizard of Oz 
 , wrap a lizard in gauze 
 Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws 
 And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls 
 Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws 
 So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw 
 Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all 
 Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers 
 Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog 
 You're on fire 
 That's how you know you're on a roll 
 'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold 
 You're on fire 
 Man, I'm so fuckin' sick 
 I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit 
 You're on fire 
 You need to stop, drop and roll 
 'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow 
 You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire 
 I just put a bullshit hook 
 In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look 
 This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke 
 Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book 
 Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it 
 I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan 
 I pop up, you bitches scatter 
 Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man 
 Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can 
 Come back and whip your ass with it again 
 Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand 
 It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man 
 Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand 
 A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man 
 Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines 
 Or get hit with a flying crayon 
 Fuck it, I ain't playin' 
 Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin' 
 Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man 
 Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand 
 So if I seem a little mean to you 
 This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute 
 You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route 
 You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop 
 Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care 
 And why the fuck am I yellin' at air 
 I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there 
 Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare 
 I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare 
 I just thought of another one that might go here 
 Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah 
 Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair 
 You're on fire 
 That's how you know you're on a roll 
 'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold 
 You're on fire 
 Man, I'm so, im so hot 
 My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie 
 You're on fire 
 You need to stop, drop and roll 
 'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow 
 You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
