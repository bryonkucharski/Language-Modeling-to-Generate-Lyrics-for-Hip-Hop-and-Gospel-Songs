You're such a nice guy, a nice guy 
 You're faithful, you don't lie 
 After the club, you go back home, right? 
 Right?! Sike! 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man 
 I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man 
 I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it 
 I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it 
 I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin' 
 I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it 
 I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be 
 You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me 
 Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie 
 Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key 
 Eh, I was tryna be nice 
 You're such a nice guy, a nice guy 
 You're faithful, you don't lie 
 After the club, you go back home, right? 
 Right?! Sike! 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man 
 I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck 
 Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch 
 I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael Polar 
 You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa 
 La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola 
 Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola 
 I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh) 
 Everything over-affects me (yeah) 
 When you joke it upsets me (yeah) 
 You say I'm no good at sex 
 And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh) 
 I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep) 
 You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep) 
 Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh) 
 Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply 
 You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size 
 Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch 
 I doubt that you're goin' to house sit 
 In that outfit, no skin-tight Levi's 
 Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie 
 Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot 
 You say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye 
 But I think I got just the thing, why 
 Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?
