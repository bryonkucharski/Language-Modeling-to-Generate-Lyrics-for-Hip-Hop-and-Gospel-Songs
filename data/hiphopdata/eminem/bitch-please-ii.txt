Snoop & Dr. Dre 
 (Yeah, what up Detroit?) 
 Nah-uh, nah-uh, uh-uh, oh no, he didn't 
 They didn't do it again 
 Wha-what? What? 
 You shit on these niggas two times Dr. Dre? (Oh fo'sho) 
 Uh-uh, no 
 You smell that 
 This is special right here 
 It's a toast to the boogie baby 
 To the boogie oogie-oogie 
 Yeah, y'know 
 What's cracking, Dre? 
 Dr. Dre 
 Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit 
 On Slim's shit, start riots like 
 Limp Bizkit 
 (Limp Bizkit) 
 Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts 
 And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious 
 (That's right, nigga) 
 Some of these crowds that Slim draws 
 Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars 
 Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw 
 Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central (Whoa) 
 Not these niggas again, these grown ass ignorant men 
 With hand triggers again (Shit) 
 You and what army could harm me 
 D-R-E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach 
 (Snoop, Eastside) 
 We came a long way to making these songs play 
 It a be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way 
 I got a long uzi, and I carry it all day 
 Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre 
 But I 
 Snoop 
 Somehow, someway, hello, nigga 
 You know about Doggy, Snoop Dogg 
 Now let me cut these niggas up 
 And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from 
 I get the party crackin' with the shit that I be spittin', son 
 Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run 
 Got about 50 guns, and I love all of 'em the same 
 Bang bang 
 Damn, baby girl, what's yo name? 
 I forgot, what'd you say it was? 
 Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up) 
 Hangin' in the club wit my nephew, Eminem 
 (What's up, Slim?) 
 What up, cuz? 
 (What's up, Snoop?) 
 The great white American hope 
 Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby 
 Nate Dogg 
 And you don't really wanna fuck with me 
 Only nigga that I trust is me 
 Fuck around and make me bust this heat 
 Snoop 
 That's the devil, they always wanna dance 
 Xzibit 
 I'm the head nigga in charge 
 I'm watching you move 
 You're found dead in your garage 
 With 10 o'clock news coverage 
 Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the fasciad 
 Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God 
 All jokes aside, come bounce wit us 
 Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust 
 It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust 
 I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs 
 So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough 
 When things get rough, I'm in the club shooting with 
 Puff 
 Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease 
 Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on 
 Nate Dogg 
 And you don't really wanna fuck with me 
 Only nigga that I trust is me 
 Fuck around and make me bust this heat 
 Snoop 
 That's the devil, they always wanna dance 
 Nate Dogg 
 And you don't really wanna fuck with me 
 Only nigga that I trust is me 
 Fuck around and make me bust this heat 
 Snoop 
 That's the devil, they always wanna dance 
 Eminem (Snoop) 
 Ah no, Big Slim Dogg, 80 pound balls (What?) 
 Dick six inch long (Huh?) 
 Back up in the heezy, baby 
 He's Shady (He's so crazy) 
 Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White 
 Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night 
 What if he's right? 
 I'm just a criminal making a livin' off the world's misery 
 What in the world gives me the right? 
 To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird 
 Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs 
 Dreamin' at night and screamin' at mom's schemin' to leave 
 Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me 
 I just want you all to notice me and people to see 
 That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me 
 It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me 
 Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean 
 So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV 
 Or heard tea CD using the fag word so freely 
 It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down 
 Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot 
 You happy now? Look here 
 I start some trouble everywhere that I go 
 Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know 
 I start some shit, they throw me out the back do' 
 Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four 
 Nate Dogg 
 And you don't really wanna fuck with me 
 Only nigga that I trust is me 
 Fuck around and make me bust this heat 
 Snoop 
 That's the devil, they always wanna dance 
 Nate Dogg 
 And you don't really wanna fuck with me 
 Only nigga that I trust is me 
 Fuck around and make me bust this heat 
 Snoop 
 That's the devil, they always wanna dance 
 Xzibit 
 2001 and forever 
 Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg 
 Come on, yeah
