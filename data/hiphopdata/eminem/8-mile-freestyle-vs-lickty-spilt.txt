(Lickety Split) 
 This guy's a choke artist 
 Ya catch a bad one 
 Your better off shootin yourself 
 With Papa Doc's handgun 
 Climbin up this mountain your weak 
 Ill leave you lost without a paddle 
 Floatin shits creek 
 You ain't Detroit, I'm the D 
 Your the new kid on the block 
 Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks 
 Fuckin' Nazi, this crowd ain't your type 
 Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice 
 And what I tell you, you better use it 
 This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music 
 Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath 
 And have you lookin' foolish 
 Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself 
 Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that 
 Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack 
 And when you actin' up that's when you got jacked up 
 And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up 
 Ill crack your shoulder blade 
 You'll get dropped so hard 
 Elvis will start turnin' in his grave 
 I don't know why they let you out in the dark 
 You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile 
 To the trailor park 
 (Rabbit) 
 This guy raps like his parents jerked him 
 He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version 
 This whole crowd looks suspicious 
 It's all dudes in here, except for these bitchs 
 So I'm a German, Eh 
 That's ok, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids 
 These Leaders of the Free World rookies 
 Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies 
 Talkin' bout shits creek 
 Bitch, you could be up piss creek 
 With paddles this deep 
 Your still gonna sink 
 You're a disgrace 
 Yeah, they call me Rabbit 
 This is a turtle race 
 He can't get with me spittin' this shit 
 Wickedly lickety shot 
 Spickety spickety split lickety 
 So I'm gonna turn around with a great smile 
 And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!
