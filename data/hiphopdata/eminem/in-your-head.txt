What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie 
 What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh 
 I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit 
 And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get 
 Away from these problems till all of my sorrows I forget 
 What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again 
 Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'? 
 Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over 
 Yeah right, oh and I might go and 
 Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one 
 I try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin' 
 Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in 
 Case you're wonderin' why my inside's showin' 
 'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm 
 Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back 
 Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit 
 Recovery brought me nothin' but back 
 To where I was and perhaps 
 This coulda been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse 
 What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie 
 What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh 
 It seems to be the reoccurring main thing 
 The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen 
 I went from an irate teenager to still raging 
 Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything 
 Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry 
 I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it 
 Yay me, I did it! Did what? 
 Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty 
 Percent of what I rapped about 
 Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating 
 Shady and entertaining from real life 
 But this dang thing is still the hardest thing to explain 
 It's the craziest shit I 
 Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even 
 Bothered taking into consideration 
 You one day being older and may hear me say things 
 I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me 
 Okay, so ladies and gentlemen let's strip away everything 
 And see the main reason that I feel like a lame piece of shit 
 Or should I sound cranky and bitter 
 Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things 
 'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see 
 I feel ashamed, greedy 
 And lately I've been contemplating 
 Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me 
 It's making me crazy what's in my 
 What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie 
 What's in your head, in your head 
 Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
