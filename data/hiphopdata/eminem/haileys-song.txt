Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing 
 I want to fuckin' sing 'cause I'm happy yeah, I'm happy 
 I got my baby back, yo, check it out 
 Somedays, I sit staring out the window 
 Watchin' this world pass me by 
 Sometimes, I think there's nothin' to live for 
 I almost break down and cry 
 Sometimes, I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy 
 Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? 
 But then I see my baby, suddenly, I'm not crazy 
 It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 
 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders 
 Everyone's leaning on me 
 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over 
 But then she comes back to me 
 My baby girl keeps getting older, I watch her grow up with pride 
 People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me 
 They just don't see my real side 
 I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy 
 My insecurities could eat me alive 
 But then I see my baby, suddenly, I'm not crazy 
 It all makes sense when I look in her eyes 
 Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter 
 If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father 
 To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her 
 God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't 
 Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona 
 That I'ma pistol packin' drug addict who bags on his mama 
 But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest 
 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled 
 That hurts deep inside of my soul 
 And just know that I grow colder the older I grow 
 This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold 
 And this load is like the weight of the world 
 And I think my neck is breakin' 
 Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? 
 Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself 
 But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell 
 But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt 
 So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else 
 But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted 
 So here's what I'm facin, 
 3 felonies, 6 years of probation 
 I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman 
 I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman 
 Man, I should have seen it coming, what did I stick my penis up in? 
 Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin' 
 But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more 
 I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore 
 (Hailey) 
 So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya 
 Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner 
 And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted 
 It's like the greatest gift you could get, the weight has been lifted 
 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders 
 Everyone's leaning on me 
 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over 
 But then she comes back to me 
 Told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried, Hailey 
 Remember when I said, if you ever need anything 
 Daddy would be right there? Guess what? 
 Daddy's here and I ain't going nowhere, baby 
 I love you
