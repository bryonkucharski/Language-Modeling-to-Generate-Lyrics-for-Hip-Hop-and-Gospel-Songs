Ecstasy in the air 
 I don't care, can't tell me nothing 
 I'm impaired, the worst for wear 
 'Cause 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 Can't you see 
 Ain't it clear, I don't care 
 Get closer to me 
 If you dare 
 I double dare 
 'Cause 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb... 
 I'm plastered, (dry wall) 
 Look me in my (eyeball) 
 Do I look high? 
 No 
 I love the way you lie girl, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Come here dear, I'm trying to get closer to you 
 I'm motioning you to pull over you boo 
 I'm the siren that you're hear, hear 
 I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear 
 But the odds are, I'mma end up in the back of a squad car 
 By the end of tonight 
 I'm a rock star, get your wind up 
 It's attack of the Oddball 
 Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are 
 'Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt 
 Every thought scarred got, now my pants off 
 The crosswalk, it's suspenders 
 And I can't feel my lips cause 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb 
 I'm going numb, I'm going numb
