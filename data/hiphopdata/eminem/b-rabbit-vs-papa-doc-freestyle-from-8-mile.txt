Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me 
 Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up 
 Look look 
 Now while he stands tough 
 Notice that this man did not have his hands up 
 The Free World's got you gassed up 
 Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf 
 1, 2, 3 and to the 4 
 1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4 
 4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1 
 You're pac he's pac You're pac none 
 This guy ain't no motha fuckin' MC 
 I know everything he's got to say against me 
 I am white I am a fuckin' bum 
 I do live in a trailer with my mom 
 My boy future is an Uncle Tom 
 I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob 
 Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun 
 I did get jumped by all six of you chumps 
 And Wink did fuck my girl 
 I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World 
 Don't ever try to judge me dude 
 You don't know what the fuck I've been through 
 But I know something about you 
 You went to Cranbrook 
 That's a private school 
 What's the matter dog? 
 You embarrassed? 
 This guy's a gangster? 
 His real names' Clarence 
 And Clarence lives at home with both parents 
 And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage 
 This guy don't wanna battle hes shook 
 'Cause there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks 
 He's scared to death 
 He's scared to look at his fuckin' year book 
 Fuck Cranbrooke 
 Fuck a beat I'll go a capella 
 Fuck Papa Doc 
 Fuck a clock 
 Fuck a trailer 
 Fuck everybody 
 Fuck y'all if you doubt me 
 I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash I say it proudly 
 And fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie 
 Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me
