Dr. Dre 
 Check check 
 One, two 
 One, two 
 One, two (is it rolling?) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here 
 Y'all know what this is 
 It's what y'all been waiting for 
 Funk Master Flex 
 Big Kap 
 Def Jam Records giving it to you, baby 
 Yo, Eminem 
 Show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby 
 Eminem 
 I used to be a lonely man (only mad) 
 Until I got a million dollars, shit 
 Now if I only had some fucking hair 
 I'd pull it, faster than a bullet 
 Out of 
 Tupac 
 's chest 
 Before the ambulance came too late to do it 
 I'm trying to grow it back again 
 It was an accident 
 I had my back against a fan 
 Who chopped it off in Amsterdam 
 I hate the straight jacket, it ain't latching 
 They can't lock it 
 So they stapled my hand 
 To my pants pockets 
 The cell's padded and battered 
 Like someone else had it before me 
 And just kept throwing them-fucking-selves at it 
 My head is aching 
 I'm dedicated to medication 
 But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (come on) 
 Anyway, I got down with Dre (what up?) 
 The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray 
 Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the police" 
 When you still had your mother's fucking nipple 
 Stuck in your teeth (fucking baby) 
 Became a role model after Colorado 
 Now all they do is follow me around and holler, "Bravo" 
 Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public 
 Suck my dick, bitch 
 I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face, but I won't 
 'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place 
 So put a sock in it 
 With your fake-ass Tupac image 
 You faggots ain't tough 
 You just get drunk and become talkative (wanna fight?) 
 I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking 
 Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket 
 So when you see me on your block 
 Stumbling, mumbling a bunch of dumb shit 
 Like my drunk uncle does 
 I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life 
 So why on earth would I need drugs 
 When I can fly on kites? 
 Motherfuckers 
 Slim Shady

 Eminem 
 I'm drunk pass the test 
 (Chorus) (repeat 2X) 
 Eminem 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Dr. Dre 
 Keep it moving 
 Off and on 
 Eminem is on 
 Off and on 
 Dr. Dre is on 
 Eminem 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Dr. Dre 
 Keep it moving 
 Off and on 
 Eminem is on 
 Off and on 
 Dr. Dre is on 
 Eminem 
 The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire 
 I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (ah) 
 Psych I'm just joking, for Christ sakes 
 Don't get so bent out of shape 
 'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends 
 Some people just don't get it 
 But I won't let it upset me 
 'Cause they don't know better 
 They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up 
 And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up 
 My mind's got a mind of its own 
 Sometimes I can't find it at home 
 It hides in the stove (hello, where you at?) 
 Shit, talk about your brain being baked 
 My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees 
 Hailey Jade 
 Daddy loves you, baby 
 Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter 
 Fuck you, lady 
 You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize 
 Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes (fuck it) 
 The neighborhood that I grew up in 
 You could die for nothing 
 And Dirty Dozen watches over me 
 So try some dumb shit 
 I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth 
 And shove his head in the fan blade 
 Don't ever tell me what 
 I can and what I can't say 
 Or change 'cause of the 
 Age range in my fan base 
 Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit 
 Quit fucking buying it 
 I'm tired, bitch 
 I'm dying to quit 
 Hip hop is universal now 
 It's all commercial now 
 It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now 
 But now the white kids like it 
 So they tell me I can buy it 
 But as soon as I get on the mic, it's like the night get silent 
 Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude 
 And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon 
 I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge 
 I'll confess to every murder 
 I committed since three years old 
 Eminem 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Dr. Dre 
 Keep it moving 
 Off and on 
 Eminem is on 
 Off and on 
 Dr. Dre is on 
 Dr. Dre 
 Yo, fuck that 
 Turn that shit off 
 Let's get the fuck out of here 
 You know how we do
