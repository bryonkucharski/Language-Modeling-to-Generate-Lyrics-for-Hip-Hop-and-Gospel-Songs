 (Just pull the plug) 
 Hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space 
 I'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase 
 I'm more then ill scarier then a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill 
 Human horror film 
 But with a lot funnier plot and people who feel me 'cause I'ma still be the mad rapper weather I got money or not as long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot I'll be in a cannoe paddling making fun of your yacht 
 But I would like an award for the best rapper to get one mic and a source 
 And a woredrobe I can afford otherwise I might just send up 
 "Pack striking at ford" and you wonder what the fuck I need more vicoden for 
 Everybody's pissing me off even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off 
 No shit I'm in grave danger to my health why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself 
 Course 
 I'm the illest rapper to hold the "cordless" patroling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
 I'm meaner in action then "rosco" beating james "star" Sr. across the back with vaccuum cleaner attachments 
 I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse and ain't shit changed I kept the same mindstate 
 Since the 3rd time I failed 9th grade 
 You probably think I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it I don't promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps and land aside a bed of spider webs 
 So throw caution to the wind you and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again (Shit) why not blow your brain out I'm blowing mine out fuck it you only live once you might as well die now [just let it go] 
 Course 
 My laser disc will make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic 
 Make you take the pistol to your face 
 And place the clip and cock it back 
 And let it go until your brains 
 Are rippin' out your skull so bad 
 To sew you back and be a waste of stitches 
 I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids 
 I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business 
 And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off 
 Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin' me to dishwash 
 I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got 
 You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim scotts 
 And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got 
 I know that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much 
 And Just the Two of Us 
 That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life 
 It's just words on a mic. 
 So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig 
 But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
