 Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all. 
 I'm sick of the motha fucka! Check this shit out! 
 Yo! I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me! 
 This shit is a horror flick, but a black guy doesn't die in this movie! 
 Fuckin' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kiddin! 
 That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'! 
 You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say? 
 I got a better chance joining the KKK. 
 On some real shit, though, I like you 
 That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to 
 Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader 
 I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It to Beaver" 
 I used to like that show, now you got me in a fight back' mode 
 But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go! 
 I hate to do this; I would love for this shit to last 
 So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass 
 And all's well that ends ok? 
 So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you, but have a nice day!"

 Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver 
 So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver 
 This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid! 
 Quick, someone get his ass another steroid! 
 "Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity blooh blah!" 
 I ain't hear a word you said, "hipidy hooblah!" 
 Is that a tank top, or a new bra? 
 Look Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job! 
 Didn't you listen to the last rhyme, meat head? 
 Pay attention, you're saying the same shit that he said! 
 Matter fact, dog here's a pencil 
 Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful, 
 And don't come back until something dope hits you 
 Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you! 
 Looking like a cyclone hit you, 
 Tank top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!" 
 You see how far them white jokes get you? 
 Boys like How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you? 
 My motto: Fuck Lotto! 
 I'll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dolla' tomorrow!
