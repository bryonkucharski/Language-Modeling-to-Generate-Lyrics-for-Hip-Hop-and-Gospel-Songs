Wanna take it from the top? 
 Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit 
 'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents 
 Two asscheek implants, call that an asset 
 'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive 
 From the first time I saw you, I actually said to myself 
 "I gotta meet her" like a taxi 
 Exactly, love affair in the backseat 
 Sorry if I'm being graphic 
 But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf 
 I feel like I'mma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself 
 Let me slow down, slow your Camaro 
 I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow 
 Got me under your control and your spell 
 Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow 
 Grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem, in fact 
 About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that 
 So when I put this palm on your cat 
 Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed 
 Why do you think they call it a snatch? 
 I just wanna climb in the sack 
 I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at 
 I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back 
 About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I want to (ah) 
 All day, all day, all night 
 You ask, I stay the night 
 With you, you say you're fire 
 Me too, you're burning up, I'm running 
 All day, all night 
 You feel, my heat (fire) 
 Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel 
 My heat 
 Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store 
 But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before 
 I pretend I work there while I clean the floor 
 Checkin' you out, like the clerk while he rings you up 
 Pull up behind you when you're leavin' 
 And you don't even know it (ayo Rick, man) 
 She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror 
 She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware 
 I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care 
 Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air 
 It's somethin' to see 
 So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink 
 If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve 
 Maybe she wants to keep me company 
 But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit 
 "Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself 
 Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail 
 Like a skunk in heat, I could sweat her to some degree 
 But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me 
 (Could you repeat that again?) 
 Let her come to me 
 Male sweater, heat, some degree, fail 
 Fuck it, pull up beside her 
 Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her, with a so bright a 
 Ass that she wants a computer lodged in her vagina 
 Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her 
 I said 
 All day, all day, all night 
 You ask, I stay the night 
 With you, you say you're fire 
 Me too, you're burning up, I'm running 
 All day, all night 
 You feel, my heat (fire) 
 Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel 
 My heat 
 Black out, come to, hands covered in blood 
 Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud 
 I just bodied the beat, so that ho musta been dug 
 'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh) 
 So let's get turnt like a shish kabab 
 Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob 
 We'd be great together, don't care if it takes forever 
 If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never 
 You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya 
 I love your personality, come on, little mama 
 You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water 
 I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona 
 With an ass to match, girl, your body is lit 
 You're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're 
 Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner 
 You got buns, I got Asperger's 
 Just let me rest my head between that set of D's 
 While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese 
 That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed 
 My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree 
 Ma, the world is what I think of you 
 I think you're divine, so I might swing on you 
 I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two 
 Unless it's the middle one to finger you 
 All day, all day, all night 
 You ask, I stay the night 
 With you, you say you're fire 
 Me too, you're burning up, I'm running 
 Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel 
 My heat 
 On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin' 
 Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (what?) 
 He's mixin' it up for me and Lauren 
 A teddy like short for Theodore 
 We're outtie, five thousand 
 Who the fuck? It's my big dick 
 So everybody get ready right fucking now!
