"Morning, Marshall." 
 "Morning, doc." 
 "So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?" 
 "Anxious." 
 "Anxiety?" 
 "Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous." 
 "Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?" 
 "Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back" 
 "Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't." 
 "Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?" 
 "Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule, we know you're a busy person." 
 "Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing." 
 "So what else are you thinking?" 
 "Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them." 
 "The steps?" 
 "Yeah, steps." 
 "There's a lot of them, aren't there? 
 "Well, twelve." 
 "Christ, I don't even know them all." 
 "Really?" 
 "Anything else?" 
 "Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?" 
 "Take a drink." 
 "What?" 
 "Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off." 
 "Take the edge off?  Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to." 
 "What, you mean these?" *shakes pills* 
 "Now, what the fuck!?" 
 "Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we?" 
 "Oh, no, no, no, come on, man!" 
 "Marshall, you can't leave me..." 
 "Oh, FUCK YOU, man!" 
 "....you'll never leave me, Marshall." 
 "NO!" 
 "We'll always be together, Marshall." 
 "NO!  NO!!!" 
 "Marshall...? Marshall!?" 
 "NOOOOO!!!!!" 
 [alarm beeping] 
 "Oh, shit..."
