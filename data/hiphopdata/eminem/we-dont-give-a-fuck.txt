 Niggers keen but they sweeted it; cookies and cream 
 Homie I got more blocks than Hakim the dream 
 That ain't task force money, that's Gun police 
 I got my ratchet in the alley with that fiend Denise 
 Cruising streets, stuntin in that maybach 62

 And somebody gets hit in the melon 
 Then they tell 'em don't go tongue-lashing wit Lloyd 
 Niggers'll put stabs in your boy like Brad Pitt in troy 
 You'll be shaking like a cuddy with his last bit of boy 
 And I'll be calm 'cause it's bulletproof glass in the toy 
 Yeah I'm flashy as fuck, mashin' with buck 
 Windows up blowing big cause the stash in the trunk
