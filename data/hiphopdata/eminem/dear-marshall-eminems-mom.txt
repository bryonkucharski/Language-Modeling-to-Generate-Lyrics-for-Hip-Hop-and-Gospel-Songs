Dear *Marshall*, 
 I just wanna start out by saying 
 I still love you 
 Even when I was pregnant with you 
 It was very hard for me 
 So many times of torture was worth every minute of it 
 'Cause when I looked in to those big blue eyes 
 This was the first time I had ever felt true love 
 In my whole life 
 We have a problem Marshall 
 The past two years... something really went wrong 
 I was so excited about your success yet so let down by your 
 Betrayal 
 Playing the role of both mom and dad must of taken a toll on you 
 More than I ever imagined 
 *Marshall*, I did the best I could 
 I went without seeking half 
 It was wrong of me and I see it now as giving you everything 
 And never questioning anything you ever did 
 As you were perfect in my eyes 
 My unconditional love created a spoiled young man 
 An angry one too 
 Now before god and everyone I must apologize 'cause at the time 
 I thought it was the right thing to do 
 I'm tortured daily *Marshall* by people always asking me where 
 Such an angry young man ... 
 Being the only role model in your life, of course they're gonna 
 Blame me 
 The demeaning me needs to stop and I speak for lots of mothers 
 The words really hurt and they cut like a knife 
 But there's no way to mend a bleedin heart 
 If not for my friends who ave been there for me and yes 
 *Marshall* they really truly care 
 I pray some day your not going to be alone and you'll have friends like 
 Me... and they won't be there just for your fame 
 And no more attacks on me 
 And vicious acts of heat 'cause it really hurts 
 Will the real Marshall Mathers please stand up? 
 And take responsibility for his actions 
 And I'm gonna close this *Marsh* by saying 
 It's not too late for change 
 And always sincerely your only mother
