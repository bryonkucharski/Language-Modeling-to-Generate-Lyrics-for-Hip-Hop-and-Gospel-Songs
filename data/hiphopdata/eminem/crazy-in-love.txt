I tell myself that I was doin' all right 
 There's nothin' left to do tonight 
 But go crazy on you 
 Crazy on you 
 Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh 
 Can't you see what you do to me, baby 
 You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac 
 I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick 
 You're truly the only one who can do this to me 
 You just make me get so crazy 
 I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic 
 One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex 
 You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack 
 We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit 
 'Cause the next day we right back at it 
 In the same exact pattern 
 What the fuck is the matter with us 
 We can't figure out if it's lust 
 Or if it's love which that is attractin' us to each other 
 They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother 
 Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch 
 But I stay and still stick it out with you 
 Even though I just hit you today 
 But you deserved it, you hit me first 
 And provoked me to choke you 
 Just 'cause I came home late last night 
 Crawled in bed and I woke you 
 But if there's one thing about you that I admire, it's baby 
 Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am 
 'Cause when I look at you, I can see an angel in your eyes 
 But if I look deeper inside, I see a freakish little side 
 Like a devil in disguise 
 You're always full of surprises 
 Always pullin' devices out your, personal vibrators 
 And dildos, you've fucked yourself so much 
 You barely feel those anymore, you're only 24 
 But you're plenty more mature 
 Then those other little ho's 
 Who just act like little girls 
 Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool 
 Chillin' you play your position you never step out of line 
 Even though I stay in your business 
 You've always kept out of mine 
 I wonder what's on your mind 
 Sometimes they say love is blind 
 Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye 
 You ain't see the sign 
 Or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge 
 Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love 
 I go crazy on you 
 Crazy on you 
 Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh 
 You are the ink to my paper 
 What my pen is to my my pad 
 The moral, the very fiber 
 The whole substance to my rap 
 You are my reason for being 
 The meaning of my existance 
 If it wasn't for you 
 I would never be able to spit this 
 As intense as I do, and the irony 
 Is you rely on me as much 
 As I rely on you to inspire me like you do 
 You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire 
 You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter 
 The only way that I'm able to stay so stable 
 Is you're the legs to my table 
 If you were to break I'd fall on my face 
 But I'm always gonna make you feel 
 I don't need you as much as I really need you 
 So you don't use it to your advantage 
 But you're essential to me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 I believe if you ever leave me 
 I'd probably have no reason to be 
 You are the Kim to my Marshall 
 You're the Slim to my Shady 
 The Dre to my Eminem 
 The Alaina to my Hailie 
 You are the word that I'm lookin' for 
 When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside 
 And the right one just won't come to my mind 
 You're like the pillow that props me up 
 The beam that supports me 
 The bitch who never took half 
 The wife who never divorced me 
 You're like the root to my evil 
 You let my devil come out me 
 You let me beat the shit out you 
 Before you beat the shit out me 
 And no matter how much too much is never enough 
 Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love 
 I go crazy on you 
 Crazy on you 
 Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
