(Royce Da 5'9') 
 Ryan's a homocidal misfit 
 I write the solution of biophysics 
 On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics 
 This my admission to having violence psychotic 
 Quick devour polish it, politics, by the way I'm higher than the Eiffel tower tip 
 I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass before I write ya shit 
 Pause, inhale hella kush, us and Yealwolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push 
 Felon's, crooks, going door to door like he's selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mush 
 Now my bitch dancer, I'm bout as sick as cancer 
 If you could swallow my style, you probably rip ya pants off 
 If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody 
 It'd probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther 
 They call me anchor man, I'll hold down the ship 
 Leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish 
 F-ck, I'm fucking heinous, I'll make you fucking famous 
 Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you sayin' 
 (Eminem) 
 Fuck, it's fucking raining, shit, it's lightening 
 Bitch, its thundering, 'cause I'm cussing up I'm a storm if you wonderin' 
 Shit, shit, you could muster up enough thought, to take a dump and a brain fart 
 Jump, if you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say it 
 Bet you wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place 
 We came to monopolize the game 
 Illuminati is here, yeah, human oddities 
 At odds with us, just what's gotta be 
 'Cause we started out cold and it snowballed 
 We froze, soon as we rolled up on these hoes 
 All's we know is you over the bar like Limbo/ Limbaugh 
 You know who you are 
 So quit fucking the dog before we start callin' you bizarre 
 Shit screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull 
 Fell in love with Shih-tzu 
 This missile's directed directly at you 
 And as for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint 
 You must be huffin', fuck a ballsack if the taints can't take you on a date 
 You mistake me for a gentleman, your 2000 and late man, Will-I-ain't 
 I'm the bad guy, type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage 
 Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pee's gets a black eye 
 (Hook - Eminem) 
 You must be outta ya mind 
 You think you fucking with us 
 Suck on these nuts 
 Bitch hang it up, this game is over 
 (Joell Ortiz) 
 Puffing loosies, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey 
 Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady 
 Will there ever come a day when they could slay me? 
 I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe 
 Till then I kill the bad man tryna slay me 
 Everything you kick weak, your speak kung fu gayzy 
 All my homeboys, 2.0 boys 
 Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it Rolls, Royce! 
 Even if I want to quit, I ain't got no choice 
 Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice 
 You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist 
 Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist 
 Bang bang, bang bang, house gang, chainsaw 
 Here to kill you pussy's, don't ask what we came for 
 I write till my right arm vein's sore 
 Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war 
 You hear that Yaowa, you know who finna file out 
 Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball 
 Piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night 
 Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight 
 (Joe Budden) 
 Jets and movers, cess-poolers, meth abusers 
 You step to us, tech's, rugers to respect the shooters 
 My men think in sync, roll with the best crew 
 Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger 
 Welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects 
 Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck 
 So I'm well prepped if you just want war 
 There'll be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor 
 It's raw, you keep acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga 
 And you gon' need the best doctors, House nigga 
 Guard your jewels and avoid large tools 
 Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool 
 Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told 
 They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold 
 Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate 
 I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face 
 Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock 
 I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock 
 (Hook - Eminem) 
 You must be outta ya mind 
 You think you fucking with us 
 Suck on these nuts 
 Bitch hang it up, this game is over 
 (Crooked I) 
 Takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer 
 I'm kind of a Dahmer, I'm grinding 
 Now rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders 
 I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama 
 You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article 
 But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles 
 Tell me when and I'm there 
 Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air 
 Stay fly like a limited fare 
 You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares 
 I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from 
 You stepped on number two just to be number one 
 Now I'ma step on you, bring it to yo yard 
 Bogart for ours, we go hard 
 You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the west 
 I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart 
 (Yelawolf) 
 I got no Jim Beam in the liver 
 Getting head like clean clippers, 
 With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper 
 When I throw up 16′s like I drink liquor 
 You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker 
 Than a cracker that'll hop around in a hospital gown 
 Popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the rounds 
 I shit logs and I piss river brown 
 'Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile 
 And that's as close as I get to a pyramid 
 Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fuckin' ignorant 
 Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent 
 But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end 
 They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing 
 Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing 
 Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging 
 And the freakshow's at the county carnival then you payin' 
 Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark 
 Yelling "Go Shady" driving slower than an old lady 
 In an old '89, no piece if you pay me 
 Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes 
 I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately 
 Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies 
 They call me crazy 'cause I made it 
 Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately 
 You ain't fucking wit' Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce 
 You don't wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice 
 That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point 0 boys 
 And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie, I deploy 
 Game over 
 (Eminem) 
 Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again 
 (Yelawolf) 
 Game over
