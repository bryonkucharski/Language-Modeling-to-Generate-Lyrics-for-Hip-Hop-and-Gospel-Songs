Killers done found this touch a long time ago 
 Had to walks hours before I found this new kind of road 
 Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candles blown 
 But I came out with a light that blind at then end though 
 Oh I mean a book, cause a book of Neanderthals 
 Could it be what it what they though it was, well it's kinda known 
 And it's kinda yes when they dress up my talents [?] 
 This ain't a star but I got life like a planet though 
 I was just a bud and would knew that the plant would grow 
 Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road 
 I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold 
 Bless you with this twinkling pile of smoke 
 The wind got in my sails in the creek, water no paddle boat 
 Nobody picking me off the ground when my saddle broke 
 It don't matter though, a horse is a horse 
 Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke 
 I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kinda mode 
 That classics are made from 
 I done felt myself change 
 (Where will you go now, what will it take) 
 I done felt myself change 
 (Is it true now, or just play) 
 Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D 
 Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG 
 Still got the house in the little hood that raised me 
 Still know dope boys, I talk to 'em daily 
 Still got that red neck family who loves me 
 Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie 
 Don't try to put me back, I'm apart of my history 
 Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty 
 'Cause I take the shotgun, a PBR no sippin' 
 Jump in the Chevy through some Catfish Billy trippin' 
 Hop on the 808, when I'm pimpin' you know I'm pimpin' 
 Never gave a fuck about the lines I crossed when I'm playing chicken 
 Raised on the Bible Belt with the cross I was made a Christian 
 What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin' 
 And I just stuck a shot for the ones who stop and they hit the ceiling 
 Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still here em, they're saying 
 (Where will you go now, what will it take) 
 I done felt myself change 
 (Is it true now, or just play) 
 I done felt myself change 
 (Where will you go now, don't turn around) 
 Do not succumb to the masses ideas 
 Or the ridicule and the judgement 
 Of those who follow the ideas of the weak 
 Will perish and they did fall of enlightenment 
 Become the vision of the minds eye 
 And carry your flame to the fire 
 Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you 
 Build, work, build, work, build, work, fall down 
 Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer 
 Money is the tool for a creation of the creative space 
 Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend 
 Family, strangers, enemies, Atheists, partisans, peddlers, people 
 People in this ocean of hungry minds 
 Feed, do no starve 
 Start now, wake up now 
 A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care a lot about your happiness 
 Love yourself and hate only you 
 If you don't...
