Struggle 
 I went through the fire 
 Flames made me pure 
 Feds were fishing for a confession 
 I ain't bite the lord 
 Took a tour of the country 
 In a federal van 
 The light overcame the darkness 
 In the devilish land 
 Knowing that the change must come but Sam Cook seems 
 15 minute phone calls press 5 when it rings 
 Locked doors open my mind, find peace 
 The animal I became is tamed a kind beast 
 Attending birthdays through pictures 
 Tears on concrete 
 Refusing to lose 
 Over the years of defeat 
 Now I speak the truth 
 The try to acquire my choir 
 Been to hell and back 
 This is trial by fire 
 Desire to find the higher power 
 In the hour of despair 
 Cutting out the stitches 
 Yes there's bridges to repair 
 Holding on to what's left 
 Trying to stay right 
 After the chaos of the night 
 Comes daylight
