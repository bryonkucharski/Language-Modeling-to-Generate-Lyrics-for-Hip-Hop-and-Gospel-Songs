I wish a motherfucker the best of a lucka 
 Suckers can kiss my pickle, adjust your lip up and fucking pucker 
 I got pull like a trucker, specifically southern 
 Louisville slugger Tucked on the Chevy rubber to bust your bubble 
 Hug your mother, don't lie to your brother 
 You know Yela's trouble, call the police, look at these bleeding knuckles 
 Alabama's elephant feet rumble, get pummelled and beat 
 Underneath the concrete like a street plumber 
 Give me the bucks from in the trees hundreds of leaves 
 Cover with Mossy Oak sleeves, I got em', believe it momma 
 Corny motherfuckers we shuck em 
 And animals, we stuff em, a cannibal, he's bluffing nah 
 Woke up in the morning with a fucking pen and a pistol 
 I put one to the paper, I put one to my fears 
 Stuck up a shop with the pen then I shot up my notebook 
 I'm reading bullet holes, I wish I fucking would 
 I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop 
 Bitch you ain't hip hop 
 I wish a motherfucker would tell me that my shit gonna flop 
 Bitch your shit shit gonna flop 
 I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop 
 Bitch you ain't hip hop 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Hello all my fellow crooks as I let the cigarello cook 
 I'm kool-aid, I got the ghetto hook 
 I got a white bitch who said she went to Pebblebrook 
 Graduated in '03 and love Yelawolf 
 I got more numbers than a yellow book 
 And I took more shots than Carmello tooks 
 So I'm used to being an underdog 
 Send my goons to come assault every last one of y'all 
 No wonder all they brawl take their pajamas off 
 Look up? whenever I want to call 
 I'm a convict but I don't wear orange 
 I'm so raw, catch me in my rare form 
 I been fly, my momma gave birth to me on a plane 
 Nigga so I guess you could say I'm airborne 
 I'm running my city getting my mayor on 
 Stay on my grizzly, you know I bear arms 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Try to run up on me, I keep that clip cocked 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Tell that ain't kush that's in my zip look 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Tell me I ain't hip hop, bitch my shit hot 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 What? 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Au contraire mon frere one pure pain giver 
 Don't ingest this, it might cause corrosion of the liver 
 Yeah toxic, dropkick opponents on arrival 
 This ain't hip hop, this is the manual to survival 
 Take notes fake folks, imitators and lovers 
 A true to life Jesus risen up from the gutter 
 I'm awesome, different from the rest of you rappers 
 And that's real shit, Pill spits exactly what happened 
 This is chemistry diminish thee ??? 
 Please explain the vivid scenes of what occurred on streets 
 And I doubt if you know what it really means 
 Cultural differences divide us and our nemesis 
 When music is the food for living I think we all forgetting this 
 Born into poverty, hard torn obviously 
 That ain't going so we trying to figure out how to eat 
 Older brother hustling, momma working overtime 
 Now I'm standing in the kitchen whipping bank it's soda time 
 I wish a motherfucker would T 
 Ell me this ain't straight drop yams fresh out the pot 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Tell me this ain't a trout spot serving it to a block 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Tell me this ain't a yam shop, come and order your rocks 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Okay 
 I wish a motherfucker would
