Yelawolf 
 Here we go to church on Sunday mornin' 
 Hangovers on 'em 
 Whiskey pourin' out of skin, it's like a poison 
 Beer-soaked boots from the barroom floor 
 It's perfume to a sinner, it's allurin' 
 Prophet for the slums, prayer for the dark 
 Barber straight razor blade, pocket watch 
 Rings on every finger, sacrificial skin 
 Story written in his blood, he's akin 
 To animals and criminals alike 
 Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods 
 Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails 
 Tank full of propane on the shelf 
 Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man 
 The enemies of good now become a friend 
 Watchin' God play his life violin 
 Happily, an instrumental in the wind 
 You will never fit, you're a misfit 
 You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get 
 Despite the effort, you remain reckless 
 You remain helpless in the same outfit 
 As your father did before, you're a song 
 Better sing the praises of the written wrongs 
 Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall 
 And that's why there's... 
 Bones Owens 
 No time at all 
 No time like now 
 To get on the road 
 If you wanna get out 
 You got to be true 
 True to yourself 
 Or you'll be a fool 
 To somebody else 
 Yelawolf 
 The rifle's in the corner, money on the table 
 Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle 
 Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him 
 Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor 
 And takes another toke, smoke fills the room 
 Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom 
 Cops on the run, sirens in the distance 
 Wild small town, violent and resistant 
 In the street, they rage and fight 
 Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin' 
 Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war 
 Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings 
 Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals 
 Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em 
 Steel with the trigger finger, take your life 
 Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe 
 Bombs take it light, wrong take it real 
 Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal 
 Take the front, son, run for the hills 
 Cowards under power make sonic seals 
 Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds 
 While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes 
 If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line 
 Because there's no time 
 Bones Owens 
 There's no time at all 
 No time like now 
 To get on the road 
 If you wanna get out 
 You got to be true 
 True to yourself 
 Or you'll be a fool 
 To somebody else
