Yelawolf 
 : 
 I'm down on my knees again 
 A call for my repentance 
 The war has taken over me 
 I beg for the forgiveness 
 The bullets ricochet, uh 
 I hear 'em when I sleep now 
 The blood is on my hands Lord 
 From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country) 
 I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun) 
 But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder) 
 The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill) 
 God, what have I become? (Whoa) 
 I pledge my allegiance 
 I left my family, a new born baby 
 To slay the enemy, the struggle for power 
 The lust, the vanity 
 I trusted America, she took my sanity 
 Lee Brice 
 : 
 Winds of change rollin' in 
 Take your love back again 
 I'm your fool, Amen 
 Just a bow for your violin 
 You played me 
 You made me your violin 
 Yelawolf 
 : 
 She looks at her reflection 
 Eyes black and blue 
 She told them she would leave him 
 She says she was through 
 He took her from a small town 
 Showed her the big city life 
 He promised her the world 
 Then he made her his wife (He runs around town) 
 But he runs around town (Lies, lies) 
 He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy) 
 She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her) 
 But no one believes her (Whoa) 
 A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey 
 The bottle of pain pills open and empty 
 She left a letter "to hell I send thee" 
 He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty 
 Too late

 Yelawolf 
 : 
 Uh, used like a rag 
 I've been washed up, I've dragged 
 Through the mud like a thief 
 My beliefs and my loves 
 Take it up, take it down 
 Took a left, took a right 
 It's the one to be found 
 To explain to me why 
 Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff 
 'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care? 
 The choices I've made are mine 
 But I swear that all can not be the fault of just me 
 I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs 
 To work and not see the changes I've strived for 
 A better life for my family I would die for 
 Take away everything from me 
 And ask why more? 
 Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors 
 There's a prayer I'm saying 'Why lord?' 
 Send me to a war without a sword 
 I'll fight and fight more 
 I'll travel along road 
 'Cause I'm just a violin 
 My life is another cord 
 'Cause I'm just a violin 
 My life is another cord
