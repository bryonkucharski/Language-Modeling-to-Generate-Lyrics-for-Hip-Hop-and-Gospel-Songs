 Memories of shadows haunt me 
 From the years when I was young 
 Things that used to terrify me 
 Are the things, that I've become 
 Yelawolf 
 There's a dark moon in the clouds 
 Misty fog in the swamp 
 Crickets chirpin' outside my window 
 The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall 
 The lights flicker sometimes 
 The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines 
 A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running 
 Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming 
 I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape 
 The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate 
 Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper 
 The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature 
 Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie 
 A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary 
 Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin 
 The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing 
 Surrounded by demons 
 I'm an angel and they all want me 
 And to this day ...

 Memories of shadows haunt me 
 From the years when I was young 
 Things that used to terrify me 
 Are the things, that I've become 
 Yelawolf 
 Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass 
 The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass 
 The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines 
 Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women 
 The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light 
 The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight 
 Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin' 
 From the fight in the kitchen 
 Blood screamin' and kickin' 
 Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap 
 The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping 
 The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it 
 The flask for the moonshine, I watch as they all sip it 
 The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram 
 The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand 
 Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies 
 And to this day ...

 Memories of shadows haunt me 
 From the years when I was young 
 Things that used to terrify me 
 Are the things, that I've become 
 Yelawolf 
 I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches 
 One of them says savage, the other one Black Sabbath 
 Heavily tatted, barely any skin left 
 Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death 
 Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf 
 Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt 
 Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper 
 Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter 
 Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter 
 Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter 
 'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it 
 No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted 
 Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters 
 Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners 
 Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe 
 Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life 
 So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire 
 A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower 
 Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming 
 Especially when ...
