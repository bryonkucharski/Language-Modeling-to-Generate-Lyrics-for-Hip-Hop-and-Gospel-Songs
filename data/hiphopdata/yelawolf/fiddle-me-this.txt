Before I say goodbye I'd like to say good day 
 And I hope you say "good buy" when they ask was it worth for you to pay 
 For my music, for pressin' play 
 For all the stress that went into my songs 
 My love and hate 
 The most honest I could be with you to date 
 Is to say thank thank you Shady 
 For lettin' me be me with no holds barred 
 Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car 
 This old jar of moonshine is but two lines on a blank sheet but so far 
 These two lines point directed to my home on the mothership sonar 
 Valet UFOs, I go park 
 The dirty south needs a soap bar 
 In the mouth of these MCs but 
 But who am I to judge on what they love? 
 I guess they enjoy being broke and co-stars 
 And I'm soakin' so hard 
 From the sweat that I could take my clothes off 
 I done fucked and raped the whole yard 
 Should sit back and shake the gold off 
 But I'm already gone 
 I got a vision like Teller, sons 
 In an envelope like letters 
 Lettuce, green, money, long 
 Wolfpacks in a calzone 
 I'll keep makin' these albums 
 Yeah you might have heard a dial tone 
 But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone 
 I'll send a postcard when I leave 
 I think about you when I dream 
 And when I'm up under the high beams 
 I reflect that shining 
 So you can feel the heat of light 
 A life of violence till I die in 
 Yeah I've done come a long way 
 From Dixie Land, take my hand 
 I'm talkin' lowriders, 77 Devilles 
 L-Dogs, nothin' but them 'Lacs 
 Sittin' on boxes in the front yard of the trailer park 
 Hell, one time for the single wives and the little cribs 
 Two times if you know what it's like to fuckin' live 
 Three times in a row you've been late on the rent 
 Four times before you did the same old shit 
 Baby done grown up, workin' that bid like a grown up 
 Fuckin' toned up, let the Glock talk, I'ma gon' hush 
 Just like daddy taught me, wait I didn't have one 
 Fuck it, I'm happy for him, 'cause he got a bad one 
 I popped outta that Easy Bake, land of the 'Bama, clean and safe 
 Dropped outta high school, reason, hey, I'm already high from a seedless egg 
 And they wonder why I speak this way 
 And ye ain't ever seen this place 
 Well here's your American pie 
 It's a Dixie piece of cake
