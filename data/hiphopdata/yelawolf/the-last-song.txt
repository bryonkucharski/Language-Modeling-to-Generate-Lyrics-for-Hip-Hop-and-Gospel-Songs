(Verse 1: Yelawolf) 
 Everybody's askin' me lately where I'm from 
 They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done 
 But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run off 
 That your scared of the truth so its dead and secret lined in chalk 
 See I've been lost ever since I could walk 
 Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk 
 Or listen to me when I spoke instead of lookin' at me like a joke 
 Or leavin' me behind leavin' me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho 
 But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around 
 And I didn't give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down 
 No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound 
 But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around 
 So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey 
 I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself 
 So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely 
 Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page 
 Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show 
 In the magazines hear me on the radio 
 So what do you think huh? 
 (I hope that your proud now 
 To watch it all go down) 
 I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow 
 Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello 
 Bye (and I hope that your proud now 
 To watch it all go down) 
 (Verse 2: Yelawolf) 
 Yeah mamma you look great... perfect 
 Be safe on your first date... for certain 
 If he brings you home too late... I'll hurt him 
 Don't worry 'bout me I'm safe, I'll close the curtains 
 And I feel like I'm raisin' you but what do I know baby blue 
 All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you 
 Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go 
 All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl 
 So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smokin' weed 
 Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me 
 But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve 
 To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be 
 What I've learned cannot be taught, what I've earned cannot be bought 
 Justified deserve it all, so don't be concerned it's not your fault 
 I never counted sheep I count my blessings 
 So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my message 
 Just tell him
