The windows cracked on the Chevrolet 
 My cigarettes in the ash tray 
 The engines off and the radio's down 
 So nervous my whole body shakes 
 The parking lot's full of people and 
 They ready to see the preacher man 
 Time to open up for the main act 
 I guess that makes me a deacon 
 I promise that I won't let me down 
 And check myself in the mirror one time 
 Say my prayer and then I shook the ground 
 Light another smoke and step outside 
 Walk inside and take a look around 
 As I try to remember all of my lines 
 Guess it's time for me to face the crowd 
 And give the people my time

 These people standing on front row 
 Tryna see through me like a window 
 I'm wearing my soul on my sleeve 
 But they look at me through a pin hole 
 All I see is this opportunity 
 To see at least one of you in me 
 But I can't seem to win 'em over so 
 I swallow the humility 
 Fifteen minutes to hold 'em down 
 And I'm just wishing that it would fly by 
 It's like my whole world hits the ground 
 All I wanted to do is have a good time 
 Hold me under but I will not drown 
 All I really know how to do is survive 
 Next time that I come to your town 
 I'll be the fuckin' headline

 I'm not supposed to be this person, I suppose 
 I'm not supposed to be this rapper poking holes at stereotypes 
 Or to write this juxtaposing flow to beats it chose 
 I hope the microphone and out me goes this songs and quotables 
 Call me nasty, say I stink, well hit the sink and hold your nose 
 'Cause I'm about as convinceable as a bum in stolen clothes till they go at those 
 I got dreams like fish got gills 
 I can't survive in this lake water without a deal 
 But I can build Noah's Ark without a power drill 
 Look at this crowd like it's a battlefield 
 Tell 'em my travels, my triumphs, my failures, my family loud and clear 
 Let 'em off, judge, I don't care how they feel 
 Fuck it what do I care? I'm my personal shrink 
 Throw my heart down on the ground, stomp it, use the blood for the ink 
 I'm used to purple and pink bruises so thanks for the tools 
 That's just a brick from the mansion 
 Another stitch in the pants of a Johnny Cash
