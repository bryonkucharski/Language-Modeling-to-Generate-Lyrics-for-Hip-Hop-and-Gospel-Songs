Still on that ass like 
 Handcuff's up in ya like 
 Hand-puppets make a mute holla 
 You should've jumped in that Impala homie 
 Refrigerators never seen ice baby 
 Not vanilla, not a breeze on the hill 
 Will make a flame grab a chinchilla 
 Quite like the words I built up to 
 Fuck guppies, I see food and I hush puppies 
 So give me that king crab 
 And I'll break its shell 
 You seen that? 
 Well fuck 'em if he don't take it well 
 So crack the top off that hot, shaking ale 
 And say "free Young Struggle" who's not making bail 
 He got popped by the feds 
 Fuck the cops! Take an L 
 Fuck it take M-N-O-P, learn how to spell 
 I'll pull up to the gate 
 And we'll skate on these country faggots 
 And until then, fuck 'em, they can have it 
 Slumerican means 
 Slum American breed 
 Gutter raised with worldwide dreams, yeah 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now 
 Yeah I'm a landslide 
 I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a ready made party 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now 
 Still on that gas like 
 The bottom of my signature shoe, 'Bama red 
 I'm on that ass like Alabama did LSU 
 Goose egg, oh lord 
 Bible Belt raised in your mouth like a cold sore 
 Roll Fords? Nah roll tide and roll Chevys 
 My momma rolls joints 
 Smoke rolls off of the tip 
 Daddy's a rolling stone 
 I'm rolling in shit with these pigs 
 In the south side 
 Who you rolling with in the sticks? 
 With hair weaves and air streams 
 Cigarette stained walls 
 Fuck, I can barely breathe 
 Spittin' shotgun pellets 
 Out of my fuckin' chili bowl 
 But am I a hill billy? No 
 I am the truth behind these fuckin' illusionist 
 Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is 
 Call me a redneck, and I just tattoo it 
 Because of the abuse and I use it as therapy in music 
 So... 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now 
 Yeah I'm a landslide 
 I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a ready made party 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now 
 Still on that grass like 
 John Deeres this yard is already cut 
 You can't get no work here, uh 
 You fags thought it was swag you was stealing 
 It turns out I got no peers 
 Just years of street smarts 
 So here you go retards 
 Come hit this bulls eye 
 I'll give you three darts 
 One, my last album flopped 
 Two, it wasn't my time 
 Three, my fuckin' mama's selling my pajamas online 
 But guess what? 
 (I'm whiskey in a bottle now) 
 Fuckin' right, I'm aged 
 I'm Dirty Three, I'm not a child who plays with rap to get a piece 
 Don't clap, for no MC who's wack 
 Then get a free slap 
 Fuck out my car and I'm smashed in a Caprice 
 I'm Jack sippin' still 
 Whippin' wood wheels 
 Truck on steroids 
 Illegal to play ball 
 But dammit how good it feels 
 Drop that black card 
 Park in the backyard 
 Baby fire up the grill 
 It's party time 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now 
 Yeah I'm a landslide 
 I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down 
 Put your hands to the sky 
 I'm a ready made party 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now 
 I'm whiskey in a bottle now
