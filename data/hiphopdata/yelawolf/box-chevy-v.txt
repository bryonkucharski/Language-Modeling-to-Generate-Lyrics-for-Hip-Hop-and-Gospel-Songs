I'm out the gate like a race horse, made in the A of course 
 That's A for Alabama, I'll be damned if I say Georgia 
 Tennessee in this bitch, I got some Hennessy that's paid for 
 Give me the big bottle, fuck it, if I break it, I'll pay for it 
 My ladies laying in the Chevrolet and I say "Lord 
 Thank you for giving me this baby girl on a suede horse" 
 Yeah, this ain't no gay Ford 
 I'm pushing bowties till I die and I'm gonna ride till my legs sore 
 Vogues I got a set "4", plus a Beretta sitting in the floor 
 Better protect yours 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Got that Glock laid in my lap 
 In case you want to play 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Let's go get you all cleaned up 
 And ride around all day 
 (Still) hitting them corners on the low pro's, girl 
 (Still) I'm an American Rock N Roll grand baby 
 Five generations of taking pictures with Grand-Am 
 The Chevrolet Slim Shady, there's no way you can save me 
 Bass boat flakes, you never seen such 
 Roll down my window like "Who I am doesn't mean much" 
 Burning tread off a thousand-dollar tires with a clean touch 
 Six hundred horses running behind the mean clutch 
 Bitch, I'm 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Got that Glock laid in my lap 
 In case you want to play 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Let's go get you all cleaned up 
 And ride around all day 
 Yeah, windows washed, looking like a glass house 
 Glaze on the dash, leather is smelling like Ralph Lauren 
 Feels like I'm watching television on a couch snorin' 
 I must be dreaming leaning back inside this chariot 
 Hitch on the back of this truck, my Harley I carry it 
 A chalice in wonderland, fill up my cup with 
 Jack D and take my fucking keys so that I don't, wreck it 
 Let me come sit on the passenger side and check it 
 How does it feel from over here? Oh, bless it 
 This is for all the Chevy's that I collected 
 Big trucks, low riders, whatever the best is 
 To you man I just want to give you a message 
 Uh', I used to sit on sidewalks like everyday 
 Watching punks and chumps in donks get hella paid 
 But I just focused on my vision and never quit n' 
 Now man I'm sittin' in my vision with a reason to celebrate 
 I'm 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Got that Glock laid in my lap 
 In case you want to play 
 In my Chevrolet, My Box Chevrolet 
 Let's go get you all cleaned up 
 And ride around all day
