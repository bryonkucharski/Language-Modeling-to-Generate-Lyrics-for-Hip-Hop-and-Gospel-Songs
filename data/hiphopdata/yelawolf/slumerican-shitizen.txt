Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Slumerican, shitizen 
 Slumerican, shitizen 
 Slumerican, shitizen 
 Slumerican, shitizen 
 I'm on the sidewalk with this fuckin' skateboard and these dirty ass jeans 
 I'm the boy that stole a pack of Twinkies And a bottle that's green 
 I never gave a fuck about environmental shit throw my empty bottle in the gutter 
 Rednecks four' wheelin' screaming "skate or die dude" 
 Fuck you motherfucker (fuck you motherfucker) 
 I'm a car wreck in a swamp I drown victims slow With these words that I lay 
 Pigs on the corner got an eye for my kind 'cause we ignore laws everyday 
 What do you mean I'm white trash? Grab my nuts and kick your poodle in the face 
 I'm sick to the soul with hate 
 'Cause I'm the bitch that society raped 
 So what'a ya say? 
 My body is covered in tattoos that are totally offensive 
 If I did It, I did it for life No regrets, you know that I meant it 
 I ain't bothered by racist my family is worldwide, ho come get it 
 I'll take you to the gutter Like a cigarette butt in the rain let Shawty Fatt spit it (Yeah!) 
 You motherfuckers are lost, get your maps out and follow me into the creek water 
 I didn't forget where I came, jus' how to ignore my musical calling 
 That crack on the window on the Chevy's been there for over seven months 
 Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the Roaches of Will Power's blunts 
 So what'a ya say? 
 People is why shit is so wrong 
 Why they won't let all our soldiers come home 
 Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts of dope on the Ave do bids so long 
 They bids so long by the time they get to come home 
 Mamas is gone and babies is grown 
 And baby mama that was tight in that thong 
 Fat as a fuck and her body all gone 
 Pay for it cash her ass is gone 
 She never worked so the stash is gone 
 Government rations she gets on 
 Year after year she get check after check 
 A gangster come home already in debt 
 The government say you owe fifty K 
 For all the free lunches that yo baby ate 
 Do you go legit, and never have shit? 
 Or G' up and re-up and get you a brick? (yeah) 
 Get you a brick (yeah) 
 See what you suckas don't understand is 
 This ain't even about race 
 This is about who got it and who ain't got it 
 So if I'm on the bottom 
 And you on the bottom 
 We're the same color 
 Dirty fuckin' Poor!
