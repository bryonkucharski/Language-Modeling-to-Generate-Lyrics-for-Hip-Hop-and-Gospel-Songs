Yelawolf 
 I'm a million light years away from the dark 
 A thousand miles and running 
 Country boy can survive 
 I'm alive, a loaded gunnin' 
 Backseat full of crooks 
 Pen and paper, this one's for the books 
 Pack it, wrap it, seal it, send it 
 To the corner in a Travis Caddy 
 Everybody in this motherfucker jumpin', footprints on the wall 
 Gimme the losers, the ones who don't fit in 
 And with this shit we're gonna have a ball 
 Swing around the mosh pit, do-si-do 
 Catfish Billy and a Dobro 
 I'm Psycho White - oh, no 
 I'm a chili pepper in an Oldsmobile 
 Comin' out for the kill 
 I don't gamble 
 I don't deal with these whose whose in this mass appeal 
 I just wanna be behind a steering wheel of a semi-truck 
 Then get drunk and run amuck 
 With every single one of my misfits 
 Bitch, that's how we're showin' up 
 With them lowriders on the west side 
 Lift kits from the south 
 Jump in the passenger seat of my '69 and hit the bootleg house 
 I'm on my new shit, still ready and ruthless 
 A public nuisance 
 But I feel right at home

 Since they're still sleepin' on me, let me wake 'em up 
 Got the world in my palm, watch me shake it up 
 Everything I'm talkin' real, I ain't make it up 
 I know you probably think I care, but I don't give a fuck 
 But I ain't givin' up, I'd rather live it up 
 Everybody sound the same, you need to switch it up 
 They still swervin' in my lane, they need to give it up 
 But I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck 
 I don't give a fuck, really I don't give a fuck 
 Yelawolf 
 Still bumpin' Three 6 all day, Hank Williams all day 
 So promenade when the lights in the ballroom swing 
 And shake and then fall and break with that bottom bass 
 Make you wanna tear the club up and go tattoo your face 
 Country boys, gutter raised, what a blend, that's all it takes 
 Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock 
 With a cop I'm a nervous wreck 
 I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take 
 And I leave you with nothing left 
 But mama tried 
 Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died 
 If she ever said I was a good boy, trust me, mama lied 
 Leave these haters with a cane to walk 
 Take these lames with a grain of salt 
 All I wanna do is take aim, assault, tell my story 
 Paint the wall from Alabama to Atlanta 
 From Atlanta I began to build a plan, a panoramic view 
 To center who my friends, the men around me was 
 The culture is that slum, and I'm not alone 
 I put a flag in Nashville, and I'm feelin' right at home

 Yelawolf 
 And the whole world is yours 
 This I know, because Nas told me so 
 Damn right, so give me that bag of money real quick 
 Let's go, I've got it cranked, it's parked out front 
 I'm a wanted man and I'm on the run 
 And I'm goin' back to Cali to the alleys where they packin' rallies 
 With the skateboarders, punks and rowdies 
 And show 'em this country savvy 
 I, am, Yelawolf and I'm feelin' right at home
