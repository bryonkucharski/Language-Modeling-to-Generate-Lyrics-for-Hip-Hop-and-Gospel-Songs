(Verse 1: Yelawolf) 
 Ain't never been much of the church type 
 But I believe in the last days 
 I walk through Hell almost every night 
 But I believe it's a pathway 
 Say boy, what you doin' with your life 
 With those tattoos on your face? 
 Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price 
 Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way 
 (Hook: Yelawolf) 
 To the father son and holy spirit 
 I hold you nearest 
 My best friend, best friend 
 Let the trumpets blow with your appearance 
 I can almost hear it 
 My best friend, best friend 
 When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit 
 Behold these lyrics 
 I got a best friend, best friend 
 Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah 
 (Verse 2: Yelawolf) 
 I don't know much about Holy Bibles 
 But I grew up in the Bible Belt 
 I put my love for a woman on idle 
 Because I got beat with my mama's belt 
 But I learned from my mistakes 
 Try hard to respect people for what they believing in 
 But if you spit on my fucking grave 
 And wish me Hell then I wish you well 
 I'mma send you straight up to my best friend 
 To the father son and holy spirit 
 I hold you nearest 
 My best friend, best friend 
 Let the trumpets blow with your appearance 
 I can almost hear it 
 My best friend, best friend 
 When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit 
 Behold these lyrics 
 I got a best friend, best friend 
 Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah 
 (Verse 3: Eminem) 
 God, please would you arm me with the armor 
 To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi? 
 Could have gone the other way many times 
 Could have turned Dalai with the lama 
 But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent 
 Recently, but don't jinx it 
 It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace 
 Though maybe not fit to enter 
 The priesthood, but at least should 
 Make an attempt to show some remorse 
 Than to be some sort of a repenter 
 For the people I've been a menace to 
 Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher 
 Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper 
 This patience of mine is thinner 
 Than twine is when I get attacked 
 So I might say something back that might offend you 
 So if you don't like when I rap or 
 What I have to say on the mic then you 
 Might wanna act, just like quarterbacks 
 And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner 
 (I got a best friend, best friend) 
 Blood balls and intestines 
 They ain't never been yes men 
 They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up 
 The minute I'm ever giving it less than 
 I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming 
 Cause failure's something I can barely stomach 
 And I only listen to my guts 
 So unless you're my fuckin' belly button 
 Don't tell me nothin' 
 You ain't my (best friend, best friend) 
 Who you think I'm talking 'bout? 
 Lifts me up when I'm down and out 
 Still look to him without a doubt 
 Still got a (best friend, best friend) 
 Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth 
 Should have never been allowed a mouth 
 Now that I got a higher power 
 Now when I blackout, power outage, stop 
 They powerless but they crowd around 
 They tend to flock like shepherds to black sheep 
 But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard 
 When I'm counted out 
 You be D-O-A, then announced 
 They pronounce you dead when they sound it out 
 So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now 
 He's all around you 
 Not even the doctors at the hospital 
 Are gonna shigy-shock you back to life 
 It's I'm-piggy-possible to revive you 
 That's word to the digy-Doc 
 Stigy-stopping and that's not an option 
 Something I'm not gonna do 
 I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth 
 Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit 
 Talking to Proof dropping a deuce 
 Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot 
 Who you think's my Glock that I use? 
 That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters 
 And they be waiting at the gate 
 When you get sprayed up, sending you hoes straight up 
 To deal with my (best friend) 
 To the father son and holy spirit 
 I hold you nearest 
 My best friend, best friend 
 Let the trumpets blow with your appearance 
 I can almost hear it 
 My best friend, best friend 
 When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit 
 Behold these lyrics 
 I got a best friend, best friend 
 Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
