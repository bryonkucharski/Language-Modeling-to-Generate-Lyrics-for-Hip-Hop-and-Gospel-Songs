Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately 
 Mama's never here and step daddy hates me 
 He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean 
 Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams 
 Today I dropped my bowl of s'ghetti on the floor 
 I didn't mean to make a mess, I tripped on one of my toys 
 I tried to clean it up, really I tried 
 But I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide 
 I knew if Benny saw it I'd be in so much trouble 
 I didn't want to, but I did 
 And the thought of gettin' hit scared me so I didn't tell him 
 Benny saw it, he took off his belt and 
 You know... he hit me with it 
 Then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the s'ghetti spilted 
 But I forgive him though 
 I love you daddy, I guess I gotta go 
 There's a moth on my window seal 
 And it came to die alone 
 Through the pain of the pouring rain 
 I gaze into the storm 
 And I imagine I'm the son of a man 
 Who will hold me close and near 
 With these bruises on my face I cry 
 While I pray to disappear 
 Daddy are you there? 
 I know you're probably busy off working somewhere 
 Helpin' somebody, build a house or somethin' neat 
 You told me what you did, carpentry, right? 
 Man, that's so cool, daddy 
 I really miss you, so much that I would kiss you 
 Yeah even front of my friends 
 I guess you know I'm gettin' sick again 
 I've been throwin' up, I haven't been playin' much 
 I missed a lot of school this week, but I'm tough 
 I'll make it, you know me, daddy 
 I don't get what I want most of the time but I'm patient 
 Hey if you get a second 
 Maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in 
 Because my babysitter's crazy 
 Mama don't believe me but she makes me get naked 
 And I'm embarrassed so I hide it 
 I'm tellin' you because you know my heart and what's inside it 
 I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights 
 I love you daddy, or should I say Christ? 
 There's a moth on my window seal 
 And it came to die alone 
 Through the pain of the pouring rain 
 I gaze into the storm 
 And I imagine I'm the son of a man 
 Who will hold me close and near 
 With these bruises on my face I cry 
 While I pray to disappear 
 When the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze 
 I float away 
 To the end of the world, to the moon, to the stars 
 To the heavens where I'm safe 
 I'm a child, not a prey. I'm an angel, enslaved 
 I'm a life, I'm a world, I'm a rose, put to waste 
 Wake me up, let me live, let me breathe, let me breathe 
 Give me love, give me soul, give me guidance, give me peace
