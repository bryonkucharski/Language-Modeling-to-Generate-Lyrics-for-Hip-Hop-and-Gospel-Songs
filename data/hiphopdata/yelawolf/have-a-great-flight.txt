Where's my calling angel? 
 At the coffin 
 Where's my blue sky? 
 At the coffin 
 A pretty bouquet and a red rose 
 At the coffin 
 Darling, don't cry 
 At the coffin 
 Over my soul 
 I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row 
 I remember how you like them, I know where they go 
 Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold 
 I know that she misses you, misses you so 
 So have a great flight 
 Have a great flight outta here, I suppose 
 I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose 
 You have a great flight 
 Have a great flight outta here, I suppose 
 I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose 
 I will keep your memories, they always make me smile 
 But letting you go honestly, I'm having a tough time 
 I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said, and hold it in the road 
 But, I'll be down here missing you, missing you so 
 So have a great flight 
 Have a great flight outta here, I suppose 
 I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose 
 You have a great flight 
 Have a great flight outta here, I suppose 
 I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose 
 And nothing ever did feel so real but this time 
 My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on 
 Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long 
 Until I see you again
