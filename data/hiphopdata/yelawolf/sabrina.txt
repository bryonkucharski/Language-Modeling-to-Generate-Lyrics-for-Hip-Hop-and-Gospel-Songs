I woke up from a deep sleep 
 I must have had a nightmare 
 But I really cannot remember 
 My heart was beating out of my chest 
 And I was cold, I must of let the window crack 
 Funny, 5th of September and the winter's coming back 
 The house is unusually quiet 
 And I'm wondering where Sabrina's at 
 By this time at eight o'clock 
 She would have been pullin' on my blanket 
 Saying daddy "I want some cereal" 
 Wondering where her mommy's at 
 My door is wide open I can hear the breeze hit the curtains 
 Wind chime hangin' on the front porch singing 
 Sabrina must be asleep 
 I pull back the sheets 
 Get up and walk to her room in the hall 
 Not a peep not a sound not at all 
 The anxiety of a father is settin' in 
 As I turn the corner to her room 
 Her Mickey Mouse blanket's on the floor 
 She isn't in the bed 
 I take a deep breath, put my hand on my head 
 Relax 
 It's a game of hide and seek 
 She's in the closet I know it 
 I open the door 
 Gotcha! 
 She isn't there 
 The faint sound of the television from downstairs is playing some cartoons she's on the couch of course 
 How did I oversleep? 
 Baby girl why didn't you come wake up daddy? 
 Not a response 
 Fear turned to frustration 
 Sabrina, answer me 
 'Brina, this isn't funny 
 I ran to the couch, she's not there 
 I'm startin' to panic and I'm lookin' up everywhere 
 Guest rooms, bath rooms, cabinets 
 Under the tables, the attic 
 Wait a minute oh god no 
 I know she wouldn't go outside 
 We live so far back in the woods 
 She wouldn't dare 
 It's too scary for a little girl just to go bye-bye 
 I'm trying to escape my mind's eye 
 But my imagination is runnin' wild 
 At this point I'm talkin' to god 
 "Please lord, please I'm scared help me find my child" 
 I run to the basement (Sabrina!) 
 Sweat beads on my hands 
 Pacin', thinkin', pacin', thinkin' 
 Turn my face in 
 The screen door to the backyard's ajar 
 I run to the swingset 
 Swingset? No 
 Sandbox? No 
 God dammit Sabrina where'd you go? 
 There's a trail to a pond that I take her to everyday 
 Maybe she's down there 
 I run down the trail it's about 100 yards 
 We usually hang out on the pier 
 And as I get close in 
 Everything moves slow motion 
 Her little white shirt on the surface of the water 
 She was there, lifeless floating (Oh my god) 
 The pain I can't explain I couldn't see anything 
 I ran to the water 
 God is this really my daughter? 
 I picked her up, she was heavy 
 I held her tight in my arms 
 I took her out of the pond 
 I laid her down on the grass 
 I couldn't breath I gasped 
 Givin' her CPR, she wasn't respondin' to it 
 My phone in my pocket 
 My hands are shakin' 
 My vision's blurry 
 9-1-1, send an ambulance in a hurry 
 But it was too late 
 No tellin' how long she wasn't breathing 
 Her skin was the color purple 
 Her lips were ice cold 
 She must have fell of the pier reachin' for her teddy bear 
 She tried to get out she got wood under her nails 
 God what did you do to us? 
 What have we done? I say my prayers at night 
 Haven't I been a good son? 
 What did you to do my baby? 
 She's mine now give her back 
 You don't deserve her if you let her die like that!
