I must be Jim Morrison, to get a motherfucking girl like you 
 Don't know what I did in my past life, but it must have been something cool 
 'Cause I'm a whiskey drinking, fight provoking, cigarette smoking dude 
 I got a problem with my attitude, it's hard for me to keep cool 
 But when I look at you, I see me, a reflection of a real soul 
 So pardon me, if I may seem loose and out of control 
 It ain't the drink talking, it's me talking, fuck if everyone knows 
 You my girl and that's that, so hop on the back of this bike and roll 
 Let's roll now 
 I'd never let someone straight up disrespect you 
 I'd never let someone call you out your name 
 I'll always be the one that runs up to protect you 
 'Cause I know if I was down you'd come and do the same 
 So let's pack it up and move our life to Nashville 
 Build a studio in the house and do our thing 
 And I'll take you out and we'll go honky tonkin' 
 Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love 
 Tennessee Love 
 Fall in Tennessee Love (3x) 
 Can't you see that my hands are shaking? 
 Withdrawals from alcohol 
 Ain't no use in us fakin' 
 But it's our life, ain't it baby? 
 So ain't no use in us taking, a chance with it 
 So I promise that I'll work on my patience 
 Someday, if we get lucky 
 And we grow and get old 
 We'll look back, and laugh about the circus and the show 
 But for now, we live it up, we spend it up, and we go 
 To the last call in every bar in this town 
 Turn the lights on and close, you and me now 
 I'd never let someone straight up disrespect you 
 I'd never let someone call you out your name 
 I'll always be the one that runs up to protect you 
 'Cause I know if I was down you'd come and do the same 
 So let's pack it up and move our life to Nashville 
 Build a studio in the house and do our thing 
 And I'll take you out and we'll go honky tonkin' 
 Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love 
 Tennessee Love 
 Fall in Tennessee Love (3x) 
 When I first met you I was so broke 
 And I tried to hide behind the Alabama pines 
 Prayin' that you didn't know, about my problems 
 'Cause I couldn't, bear to see you go 
 And when you found out, all that happened 
 Your little heart was broke 
 And I had to earn it back 
 And I learned in fact 
 That money don't fix that shit 
 Not tattoos and I love you's 
 It's trust that I had to get 
 I'm sorry that I ever hurt you 
 For anything that I did 
 Can I put this ring on your finger 
 Let you know that I'm serious, marry me now 
 I'd never let someone straight up disrespect you 
 I'd never let someone call you out your name 
 I'll always be the one that runs up to protect you 
 'Cause I know if I was down you'd come and do the same 
 So let's pack it up and move our life to Nashville 
 Build a studio in the house and do our thing 
 And I'll take you out and we'll go honky tonkin' 
 Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love 
 Tennessee Love 
 Fall in Tennessee Love (3x)
