 Don't tell me that the sky is the limit 
 Cause it ain't about what you can do 
 It's a who knows who

 Okay you got criminals everywhere, right? 
 Criminals smugglin' dope across borders to feed America's high appetite 
 Kis, pounds, ounces, grams, whatever the weight of substance is gettin' towed 
 Cause drugs got a price 
 Home hydroponics, LSD chemist 
 Spoon cookin' heroine, junkies fill up methadone clinics 
 Get caught for crack and catch a long sentence 
 You ask me how I feel about that, maybe you got the wrong witness 
 I heard Jay Z's cool with Obama 
 Obama must be cool with me then I guess if I'm packin' up this Honda 
 I highly doubt it but fuck it, it's worth a shout out 
 At least that's what I tell the judge before I gracefully bowed out 
 Meanwhile I'm gettin' taken to the county for receive 
 There's a news flash on the holdin' cell TV 
 Boston bombed by a terrorist at a marathon 
 8 year old killed and the killer's still free 
 Shit is hard to believe

 I ain't no politically savvy citizen 
 I'm just an average man who writes poetry about witnessin' fuckery 
 And these police who always fuck with me 
 Do time for sharin' dirt, my boy trusted me 
 But I picked music over hustlin', and I made it out luckily 
 Could've been on corners droppin' quarters from a bucket seat 
 My cousins preach about the lord but all I see is crime 
 If the Vatican has got the book then what the fuck is mine? 
 Just a line with a hook 
 You might as well be a rapper cause you signed and get booked 
 All the same to a suit 
 Black or white, you still a crook 
 If you ain't a Justin Leave It to Beaver with that look 
 Then just drop the egg in the skillet, let it cook 
 Who y'all bein' took 
 No I'm not a crook, son but this one ain't shook 
 But I'm rollin' Mobb Deep, my dreams on a Harley Davidson 
 Pigs, I hardly wave at them, yeah I said hardly 
 If I'm rude then pardon me but remember...

 My grandparents retired from 9 to 5s 
 Then paid for my hospital bills when mama was doin' lines 
 I wasn't raised up like the model American 
 But I love what it made me, life is all about where and whens 
 Whos and how's that ultimately create my heritage 
 My great grandaddy Otis would sit down in his chair and then 
 Smoke a cigarette while he sipped on Muscatine moonshine 
 Homemade, and reminisce about the old days 
 He died of cancer when I was 5 
 I wasn't allowed to go see him in his casket 'cause I would've cried 
 I got so much value off life in such a short time 
 Memories stick to my heart and today they still apply 
 They used to share crops when they were poor 
 He worked his ass off at the mill and then he opened up a store 
 Both of my granddaddies fought a war 
 So I can say what I'm sayin' in this record for you and yours 
 For you and yours, true 
 They say the sky is the limit 
 Well I guess it all depends on you
