You said you don't wanna die but still you want to go to heaven 
 Heaven's not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in 
 Leavin' what is keeping you from walkin' out the door and livin' life like there's a reason 
 Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison 
 Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision 
 Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya' they will loot ya' they are killin' 
 Killin' power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it's a sentence 
 Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high 
 There is no limit 
 Limit what they sell and what they're givin' 
 Even if the whole world knows 
 I don't give a damn about what they think 
 I don't have to stand up to your gun 
 I don't have to sit down when you say 
 Tell me I'm overboard 
 The truth is you just want to see me sink 
 If there's any room left on that ship 
 You don't have to save any room for me 
 'Cause I've got my own boat (even when it rains) 
 I'm doing my own thing (even when it rains) 
 And I will stay afloat - even when it rains 
 'Cause I've got my own boat 
 Row, row your boat 
 Row, row your boat 
 Row your boat 
 They marchin' up the street they wanna fight they don't want peace 
 Peace of what you have they snatch and grab 
 They steal and run 
 They pullin' guns out on police 
 Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will 
 They will at you - they'll execute if you don't leave 
 Leavin' the impression no one's safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast 
 Beasts are on the corner, slingin' poison to the junkies - to a junkie it's a feast 
 Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that's on your street 
 Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets 
 Sheets in Alabama cockin' hammers, ridin' horses, wanna handle who is free 
 Free yourself from anything they preach 
 Even if the whole world knows 
 I don't give a damn about what they think 
 I don't have to stand up to your gun 
 I don't have to sit down when you say 
 Tell me I'm overboard 
 The truth is you just want to see me sink 
 If there's any room left on that ship 
 You don't have to save any room for me 
 'Cause I've got my own boat (even when it rains) 
 I'm doing my own thing (even when it rains) 
 And I will stay afloat - even when it rains 
 'Cause I've got my own boat 
 Row, row your boat 
 Row, row your boat 
 Row your boat
