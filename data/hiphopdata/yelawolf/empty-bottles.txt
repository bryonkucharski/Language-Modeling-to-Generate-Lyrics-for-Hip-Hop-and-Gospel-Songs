Empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Silhouettes of people dancing 
 To an unfamiliar sound 
 Hello stranger, can I call you a friend? 
 My friend, I'm going down 
 With empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Brown bottle sits with the permanent bliss 
 Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss 
 Eyes fixated with the familiar shape 
 Black label, white letters, they integrate 
 Cupid's in the bar room with harpoons 
 I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms 
 See every bullet hole in the window of my past 
 Now that's what I call a shot glass (2, 3, 4) 
 Empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Silhouettes of people dancing 
 To an unfamiliar sound 
 Hello stranger, can I call you a friend? 
 My friend, I'm going down 
 With empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Count the cracks on the sidewalk 
 Pack the cigarette box in my left palm 
 Flame on the tip of a smoke 
 I don't know where the light came from 
 Legs like a ghost, I still walk 
 Whole world mushed concrete, feels soft 
 Blinded by the cameras pop flash 
 I'm a big fan, shot glass? (2, 3, 4) 
 Empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Silhouettes of people dancing 
 To an unfamiliar sound 
 Hello stranger, can I call you a friend? 
 My friend, I'm going down 
 With empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Oh, what a life it's been 
 What about my life in there? What about the would and when's? 
 If's, maybe's, could-have-been's? You didn't know shit about me, man 
 You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then 
 Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk? 
 What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want? 
 Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle 
 And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model 
 Hey wolf, wolf! 
 Come on man, time to go 
 Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off 
 Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off 
 Empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground 
 Silhouettes of people dancing 
 To an unfamiliar sound 
 Hello stranger, can I call you a friend? 
 My friend, I'm going down 
 With empty bottles on the table 
 Black roses on the ground
