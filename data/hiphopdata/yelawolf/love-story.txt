(Pre-Hook) 
 When this well runs dry 
 I guess you'll find another well 
 When I say goodbye 
 There'll be another breeze to sail 
 When my boat goes down 
 I guess you'll learn how to swim 
 If I don't come home 
 Just know you've been a good friend 
 Don't forget me 
 I love you so 
 Don't forget me 
 I've never let you go 
 Don't forget me 
 Love is the story I wrote 
 Don't forget me 
 Don't forget me 
 If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol 
 Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile 
 Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I drag 
 My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain 
 Bounce on my boots and then climb it 
 Mount up my troupes and defiantly 
 Go against what they trying, teach 'em to shoot when I'm rhyming 
 Be living proof of my word, meaning I'm Bible designing 
 Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and 
 Throw the hook to the open water, fish till I catch that motherfucker 
 Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan, I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up and dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke 
 Rely on patience and hope, speak to a nation, it shows 
 Reach through these speakers and grab you, turn the bass up and then choke 
 And I earned my place on this road, ain't nobody moving me, no way 
 No, how, OK, go, pow 
 When I was born they said "exorcise" and the hospital set on fire 
 The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said "Messiah" 
 Here from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell 
 Brought here to be poor white trash and excel 
 Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like [?] on the shelf 
 A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes 
 And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see 
 How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans 
 How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea 
 From crippled ships to triple dip Z's 71's 
 Yeah it's already begun and I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one 
 I got my weight up like I'm carrying fat people 
 I planned it, I landed 
 Touch down, that Seagull 
 But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me 
 My heart is half open for the ones that never gave a fuck for me 
 My love story 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me (yeah, yeah) 
 Don't forget me, don't forget me 
 Don't forget me, don't forget me
