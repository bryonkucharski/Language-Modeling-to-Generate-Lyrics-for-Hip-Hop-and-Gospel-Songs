Yelawolf 
 Way back in Alabama where the dirt roads cut through the woods 
 And when it rains you can smell the steam off the grass 
 Even dew on the hood of my paw paw's 1985 Chevrolet Silverado 
 I must have been about six 
 Life was so easy back in the sticks 
 16 year old mother fought for the life she wanted for her son 
 Lookin' for love in the world of rock and roll is where it begun 
 It was Alabama, Ted Nugent 
 Alice Cooper, Randy Travis 
 Aerosmith kept my stepdaddy on the road 
 And life, it was madness 
 Cocaine and alcohol filled up the house party to be frank 
 It wasn't long before I tried it myself and then started to drink 
 School became boring and doing my homework became rollin' joints 
 Now I'm sixteen like my mama was when she had a little boy 
 Can't imagine that now as I look back 'cause I got three kids of my own 
 And I respect what she went through to pay for food and clothes 
 And a home 
 'Cause it ain't what she did, it's what she didn't do for me 
 That brought me to this moment 
 And made me who I am on this recording 
 And this is my story

 This is my story 
 This is my glory 
 This is what keeps me alive 
 This is me flying 
 This is me trying 
 This is what keeps me alive 
 Yelawolf 
 20 years old in the streets and I'm rollin' with gangsters now 
 Hip-hop is takin' over me, my language, my clothes, my lifestyle 
 Antioch, Tennessee put me through the school of hard knocks 
 And I carry that attitude with me to this day, more or not 
 And I'm young and hot-headed 
 Always running from police and skateboardin' 
 Graffiti, loiterin', I sorta got my peace from the chaos 
 Was no "mother-may-I's," surrounded by have-nots 
 And maybe some day I's well 
 I was against the grain, even when I was growin' wheat 
 Got back into rock and roll, and then got into poetry 
 Started expressin' everything I could through the medium of pen and pad 
 Playin' instrumentals off a tape and then over-dubbin' what I had 
 It was everything, because I had nothin' 
 And man that was alright, 'cause now I had somethin' 
 Little did I know that would be the hardest thing to do God ever put before me 
 So I took a look at what I've been through 
 And I made it my glory, and this is...

 Yelawolf 
 It's a 2 AM bus 'craw; from me at the parkin' lot of Wal-Mart 
 Leavin' Nashville, Tennessee for a nationwide tour 
 My bags are all packed and I'm loadin' my truck to go meet the crew 
 And I'm excited to get on the road, already one foot out the door 
 Turn around and it's my daughter, she's cryin' 
 'Cause daddy is leavin' 
 Knows that I'll be gone for months and it hurts and I hate to see it 
 Kneel down and tell her, "Look, baby, I promise I'll call you everyday 
 And daddy will send you a present from everywhere that we go play" 
 But that's not enough, and it's breakin' my heart in two 
 Just knowin' I can't stay, not even to see it through 
 And that I can't tuck her in, to say goodbye with a grin 
 Now she's bein' left behind, this is me all over again, man 
 I picked her up in my arms and held her tight 
 And said, "Hey you know what? Daddy used to be just like you 
 When I would walk up to the bus 
 And I'd do anything in the world for you, so chase your dreams 
 One day you'll use everything you've been through to be anything, baby girl 
 This is my story
