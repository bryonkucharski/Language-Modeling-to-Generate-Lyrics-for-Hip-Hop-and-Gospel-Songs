Daylight, whoa daylight 
 Daylight, is coming again 
 Whiskey, whoa whiskey 
 Whiskey, my only friend 
 Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado 
 Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado 
 I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model 
 Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o 
 Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow 
 Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho 
 I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow 
 I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin' 
 The crock pot holds potatoes 
 I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow 
 I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes 
 I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs 
 So I can think long; an aficionado 
 Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato 
 I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle 
 Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto 
 And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow 
 Do you follow? 
 And just like the howlin' wolf 
 A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues 
 Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do 
 You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof 
 'Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof 
 I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Call me what you want but don't call past two 
 Unless you got some liquor to contribute 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof 
 I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Call me what you want but don't call past two 
 Unless you got some liquor to contribute 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Drinkin' till I'm heavily faded 
 All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated 
 I complicate the uncomplicated 
 My drinkin' partners are the greatest 
 Me and my buddy, Jack Davis 
 Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe 
 We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy 
 Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy 
 Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight 
 I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight 
 Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like 
 Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life 
 I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams 
 Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim 
 So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle 
 One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man 
 And just like the howlin' wolf 
 A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues 
 Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do 
 You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof 
 'Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof 
 I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Call me what you want but don't call past two 
 Unless you got some liquor to contribute 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof 
 I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Call me what you want but don't call past two 
 Unless you got some liquor to contribute 
 To get down, to get down I get loaded down 
 To get down I get loaded 
 Daylight, whoa daylight 
 Daylight, is coming again 
 Whiskey, whoa whiskey 
 Whiskey, my only friend
