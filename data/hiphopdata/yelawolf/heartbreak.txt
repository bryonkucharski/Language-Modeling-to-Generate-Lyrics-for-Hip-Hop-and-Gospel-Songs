You used to be so cool, what the fuck happened to you? 
 Look at what all this rapping and money-stacking will do 
 I could've been stuck out in 'Bama, had I not flew the coop 
 And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa ain't got no loot 
 Uh, money ain't the issue, you say, that's funny now 
 Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth 
 Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer 
 Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck 
 Momma told me I should keep it real 
 My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal 
 Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit 
 I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch 
 I should've seen it coming, she never pulled away 
 I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate 
 You gassed em, Yelawolf, you better pump your fucking brakes, asshole 
 You got the nerve to 
 Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh 
 Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around 
 And I can't pretend to love you right now 
 So you can go cry your heart out until you drown 
 Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down 
 You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything 
 What have I done besides give you what I could not afford? 
 The kids are happy 'cause they really don't know anything 
 If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford 
 The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour 
 Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for 
 I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth 
 You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true? 
 This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof 
 Skit of skin and tooth, the witch in you bit, left me with cracked roofs 
 I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop 
 Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh 
 You wanna walk around like it's all good 
 'Cause I'm the golden ticket to get out of the hood 
 You better hope somebody cares more than I do 
 Cause my will don't include you 
 Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh 
 Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around 
 And I can't pretend to love you right now 
 So you can go cry your heart out until you drown 
 Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down 
 There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch 
 And I can't pretend to love you right now 
 So you can go cry your heart out until you drown 
 Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down 
 There'll always be a special place 
 For you in my bank account 
 You fucking bitch 
 Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh 
 Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around 
 And I can't pretend to love you right now 
 So you can go cry your heart out until you drown 
 Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down 
 There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch 
 And I can't pretend to love you right now 
 So you can go cry your heart out until you drown 
 Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
