Kid Rock 
 Engine, engine number 9 
 On that Mason-Dixon line 
 Chasing whiskey, sipping shine 
 Gripping nickel plated nines 
 So you get yours and I'll get mine 
 You get yours and I'll get mine 
 You get yours and I'll get mine 
 You get yours and I'll get mine 
 Yelawolf 
 I'm a motherfucking boondock killer, Mossberg filler 
 King of the drop, they'll never be much iller 
 Top medical grade dope baby, Chevrolet sitting up like Grave Digger, roll over your Mercedes 
 And I rock, man, I'm a firestarter 
 Two handles of brown and a half a gallon of firewater 
 Tell the police they can keep knocking, we're doing illegal shit go to the window, bitch, keep watching 
 Chopping on that 808, ride by your house and make the window shake and the beat so hard, make the tempo break 
 And the next door neighbor wanna relocate - uh 
 You can hear me across the county line, bagging up dimes of rhymes, and I'm moving 20 P's at a time 
 Black sheep, son of a landmine 
 The caboose is loose, the train track's unattached and I -

 DJ Klever 
 Hold up, hold up, one time for the DJ 
 (*Scratches* "Go DJ!") 
 Yelawolf 
 So motherfucking outta tune hit 
 Don't tell me to turn up trap or tune in! 
 And because no new bitch to do 
 It's the same bitch and you just bought her new tits 
 And I don't give two fucks about you're two sips 
 Wouldn't give you two dogs to give two shits 
 Black sheep son of a land mine 
 The caboose is loose, the train track's unattached and I -

 Yelawolf 
 Harley Davidsons blowing it down Broadway 
 Rock this motherfucking like three, the hard way 
 Bones, Klever, shotgun 
 Su, Wu, Tang riding gorilla 
 Open the doors to the venue and let the slums in 
 Weed smoke and whiskey like a tornado whip 
 The south is in it, deep in it with bump 
 Be funky, the tree trunk gon' speed bump 
 Another round and the cops might have to hold me down 
 If you don't know me you'll know me after I hit the ground 
 Rittz filling my cup up until I get the ground 
 Pack this bitch to the ceiling and kill 'em and Billy now 
 Made a career drinking beer, anarchy and wanted 
 My country ass momma singing "Oh lawdy!" 
 Black sheeps son of a landmine 
 The caboose is loose, the train track's unattached and I -
