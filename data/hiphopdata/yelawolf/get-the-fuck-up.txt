Though many have come 
 There will never be another one 
 Quite like 
 Yelawolf 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up 
 Wraaa Daddy gonna pop that trunk 
 Yeah, battle ship sunk, throwing dirt rock chunks 
 Sling shot rocks broke no money lumps 
 Looking up too D boys with the pretty dunks 
 Slick sit down you ain't in the city chump 
 Special K make the kitties come 
 Get you some get many guns 
 Move 'em out ten toes pity none 
 Get your own Dixie won't give the dog a bone 
 Sitting' on bigger chrome yeah that's home 
 Bird fight pit fight what a good song 
 Looking at the world like what I do wrong 
 Nothing but a mailman truck coming back for the pickup 
 I'm a gift you can't get rid of 
 Recline on me homie I'm a make you sit up 
 Get drunk do it. Stage lights are lit up, scream like 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up 
 Wraaa 
 Let the beat ride like that 
 Yeah I'm a thunderbird never coming back 
 Thunder in the trunk thunder in the dope sack 
 I serve 'em up thunder in the dope raps (BOOM) 
 Big 'llacs in the tall grass sit with the tires flat 
 Real good price buddy you should buy that 
 Blink and you might pass my town 
 Hole in the wall king my crown 
 Oh but of all things my sound 
 Is picking up like a 30 mile long train 
 Slow climb up but it's such a long drain 
 So how did I become up pick of all names 
 What a fairy tale like Ichabod Crane 
 The headless horsemen runnin' untamed like 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up 
 Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
