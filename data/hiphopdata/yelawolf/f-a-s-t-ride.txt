(You know my Uncle Critter said, 
 "You look like you been shot at and missed 
 Shit at and hit" 
 On that ass, bitch 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, and I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, on that ass, bitch 
 And I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Trunk Muzik, bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Mello Yello can in my hand, 
 Mullet hawk, what? 
 Country folks don't talk much 
 They just get to work: sawdust 
 Chainsaw, axe, knife, cut firewood, burn, logs, heat 
 Sleepin' bag by the bricks: call me the fly, I'm on some shit 
 Drum this out with two sticks 
 Soup a high school Coupe for new kicks 
 Zoom, raps make mummies jealous from a tomb 
 Knock twice if you feel it 
 Born to rip, I should've been 
 Perforated by the rings like a Mead notebook 
 Squares want an artery blocked when I'm around 
 Circulated, nerds are in, Urkel made it 
 I'll slap Urkel, take his lunch money 
 Punks they run from me, drunk and upset 
 But I don't run clumsy, punch a perp' 
 A one, two, three: I'm at the Chelsea Hotel 
 Like Sid and Nancy with the knife, and two grams of candy 
 Give me the dizzies, fee, fee, fuck me 
 Please oh please don't leave 
 Just give me the keys and crank that beat 
 'Cause I might double up and straight dry heave 
 But believe, oh believe I'm cold, I'mma freeze this beat 
 Like Freon, frickin' neon, that's me glowing in a snowstorm 
 Look here, we in these streets like a pair of Nikes 
 Well, I might be more like a pair of nice jeans, 'cause I'm... 
 On that ass, bitch 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, and I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, on that ass, bitch 
 And I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Trunk Muzik, bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 So what's new? 
 Been on that shit, where's the atlas? 
 Thumbtack it, South Cackalack it, Alabama has it, go 
 Relax in a 1985 box train, perhaps I'm playin' Relapse 
 Boss, Eminem saw the gem in him 
 Oh, me? Yeah, who thought? 
 Just toss the white trash out the window 
 Now I'm in a ditch like broken pencils 
 Empty bottles and stolen rentals 
 This one is for all my kinfolk 
 Yeah, bring 'em in, though 
 Out the rain, what's a friend for? 
 Word, oh for sure, yours truly, at the door 
 Had to add a syllable to that word 
 Country, but, oh, of course 
 Bitches go berserk for certainly, no need to be coerced 
 Odd economy, don't need no nine-nine-nine-nine-nine and I know 
 Just the na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye, and hey, let's roll 
 These hoes are no good, pills are okay 
 I just wanna get high, fuck what you say 
 Wild, the pen-play kind of like a samurai sword 
 With a big bitch, bow to sensei 
 Motherfuckin' bitch, it's pay your rent day 
 Do I not look like my name was MJ 
 One glove and a fuckin' pair of penny loafers 
 And I moonwalk on the tempo like Billy Jean is not my friend, no 
 On that ass, bitch 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, and I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, on that ass, bitch 
 And I be bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Trunk Muzik, bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah... yeah... 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 On that ass, bitch 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 On that ass, ho 
 Bumpin' this funky-ass shit to ride to 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go 
 Let's go, let's go 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 I'm on my shit now... 
 I'm on my shit now... 
 I'm on my shit now... 
 I'm on my... 
 Yeah, I'm on my shit now... 
 I'm on my shit now... 
 Let's go!
