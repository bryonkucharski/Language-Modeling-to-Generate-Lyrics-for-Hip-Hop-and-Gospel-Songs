This ain't for the good girls gone bad 
 This one's for the bad girls trying to go good 
 How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl? 
 Such a good girl, you're a good girl 
 And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl 
 Like I could, girl, like my good girl 
 Here I go again, on my shit again 
 Walking through the mall, acting like a prick again 
 You had a halter-top, I had my Famous socks 
 You came to shop, I came to ho hop 
 You had your girl witcha, both looking great 
 I wanted both of y'all, how about a double take 
 She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag 
 But something made you want to turn around and come back 
 Probably 'cause I just don't give a fuck 
 I just want to see one of these hookas in my truck 
 So tell your girlfriend, tough luck 
 She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up 
 Well, I really ain't into that type of shit 
 I'm into tattoos and drinking 'til six 
 Fucking 'til nine, sleeping 'til twelve 
 And going back to my homies with a story to tell 
 How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl? 
 Such a good girl, you're a good girl 
 And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl 
 Like I could, girl, like my good girl 
 This shit should've been finished 
 I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it 
 But you continue to text message me 
 Right after saying that we should both move separately 
 But you don't want to see me go 
 Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal 
 So you must have a thing for lucky charms 
 Or the bad girl in you just fell into my lucky arms 
 You love to cuss me out and call me crazy 
 Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me 
 Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me 
 And then it goes from fuck you, to fuck me, baby 
 You leave early so nobody sees you at the spot 
 Now you're stuck between a hard place and a rock 
 You call me a player but I have lied to you not 
 'Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot, holler 
 How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl? 
 Such a good girl, you're a good girl 
 And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl 
 Like I could, girl, like my good girl 
 I'm in jail again on my Johnny Cash 
 Some dude was talking shit, I had to whip his ass 
 Called you in the morning and you just fucking laugh 
 You think it's cute, you love my crazy ass 
 And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side 
 'Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride 
 I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why 
 'Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy 
 You want to rock, let's rock and roll, just know 
 I'm only good at one thing and it's not control 
 But I am consistent, that's something to be proud of 
 'Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without ya 
 How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl? 
 Such a good girl, you're a good girl 
 And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl 
 Like I could, girl, like my good girl 
 To all the bad girls trying to be good 
 There's no such thing as good girl gone bad girl 
 Just a bunch of bad girls trying to go good
