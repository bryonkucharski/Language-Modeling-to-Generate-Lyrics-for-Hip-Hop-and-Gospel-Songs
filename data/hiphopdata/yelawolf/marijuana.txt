Marijuana, Marijuana, fuck 
 20 pounds in the trunk 
 Momma been growin' that skunk 
 Green room looks like a warzone 
 Dirty water drips from the hydro pumps 
 Daddy got me sweepin' leaves 
 Pickin' up shake, 
 Makin' tea, brownies, cookies, 
 Serving all the hippies 
 Nickel sacks 
 Bet, hit me Dixie boy 
 Smoker's toy 
 Paraphonilia, you enjoy 
 Grow it pack it then deploy 
 Summertime job, come get employed 
 Evidence destroyed 
 Family biz evidently boy 
 Duckin' in the police boy 
 All for the love of 
 Marijuana 
 Growin' it up 
 Cut it down 
 Pack it up 
 Pass it around 
 Everybody loves some 
 Marijuana 
 Makes you happy 
 Feelin' stupid 
 Girls get horny 
 When they use it 
 Everybody smokes some 
 Marijuana 
 Can't get caught by the Rosco 
 So we stuffin' this green like a taco 
 Feelin' like we hit a brick lotto 
 Putting dents in the street like a pot hole 
 We pot hold, in the backwoods 
 2 tone box Chevy with the black hood 
 Seats come out all packed up 
 P's for the 18 like a Mac truck 
 You a dope boy? So what 
 If I gave you my connect 
 You'd blow up 
 Sawed off layin' flat on the sofa 
 They'll twist that lid like a soda 
 Uncle Critter putting plugs on the motor 
 We gotta get to Tennessee no holdups 
 We ain't getting rich bitch 
 We getting over 
 All for the love of 
 Marijuana 
 Growin' it up 
 Cut it down 
 Pack it up 
 Pass it around 
 Everybody loves some 
 Marijuana 
 Makes you happy 
 Feeling stupid 
 Girls get horny 
 When they use it 
 Everybody smokes some 
 Marijuana 
 Crowbar sits in the carjack 
 Fill the gas tank up with a fun pack 
 Son I don't wanna see you till you come back 
 If you get caught, you know where the money's at 
 Throwing loose rocks on a dirt road 
 Police on your throat like a chokehold 
 Rollin' through town with a boatload 
 I'm feelin' like a trailer park mogul 
 Sweat can't roll down the windows 
 'Cause the doors jammed up with the elbows 
 I think I see cops, I can't tell though 
 If I ride too close, they'll smell dope 
 My phone blowin' up, I promise 
 They waitin' on the package from the runner 
 I made enough just for the summer 
 All for the love of 
 Marijuana 
 Growin' it up 
 Cut it down 
 Pack if up 
 Pass it around 
 Everybody loves some 
 Marijuana 
 Makes you happy 
 Feelin' stupid 
 Girls get horny 
 When they use it 
 Everybody smokes some 
 Marijuana
