I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now 
 I'm not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load 
 I'm not the road that you think when you lookin' for a short cut 
 I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch 
 I ain't the money man, which your money man, you ain't lookin' at me 
 I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free 
 I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out 
 Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in 
 Mothafucka check this out 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend 
 Just because you got yourself in some shit 
 It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it 
 You handle your own when you become a man 
 And become a man when you handle your own 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone 
 I'm not the the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now 
 I'm not the new kid, on the block 
 That you can just follow and push around 
 I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found 
 This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down 
 I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean 
 Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break 
 Because I hold up the weight for the team 
 I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck 
 That your scheming to check out 
 Unless your looking to check out (Shot, shot, shot) 
 What a mess now (C'mon) 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend 
 Just because you got yourself in some shit 
 It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it 
 You handle your own when you become a man 
 And become a man when you handle your own 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone 
 I jump to the sky for my people 
 I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal 
 Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame 
 When you come around and telling me I changed 
 Dam right I fucking changed 
 When there's fuckin' change in my pocket 
 Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden 
 I went from shoppin' without nothin' 
 To goin' shoppin' for my cousins 
 Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin' 
 They wanna drop me in the oven 
 Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan" 
 Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend 
 Just because you got yourself in some shit 
 It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it 
 You handle your own when you become a man 
 And become a man when you handle your own 
 Ain't much I can do but I do what I can 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 But what can I do if I do till its gone
