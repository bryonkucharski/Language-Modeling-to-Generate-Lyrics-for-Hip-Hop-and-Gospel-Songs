Pa's just got a lot of things to do 
 Like what? 
 Doesn't matter, I don't want Pa to skin me alive like he's gonna do to you if he finds out 
 Pa said not to bother him, and if he's not gonna be home, how can I bother him? 
 It'd be better if you just forget about it 
 Well I'm going to do it, and I'm gonna take Jack with me, 'cause Pa didn't say anything to him 
 Way down this country road and I holler 
 Where they make that moon shine still 
 There's an old man on the porch on a shack 
 And the shack is where he lives 
 Round the town they call him Paul 
 It's Paul from on the hill 
 And every time Paul does slay a hog 
 You can hear that hoggy squeal 
 I'm from the valley of the bible belt 
 That motherfucker preacher's daughter's son 
 Where they can't find no woman, no man, no cousin, no friend without a gun 
 Alabama that is my home 
 Fucking trailer park has got my heart 
 Off in the hood, I make home when I play in the woods after dark, 
 You won't find me sober much 
 Always got a bottle of Jacky O 
 I take my sips, I talk my shit 
 And I fight anybody that wants to go 
 Tall and slim, walk with a limp 
 'Cause my nuts are oversized 
 Fuck your dope and your alcohol 
 Because your shit is overpriced 
 Hit the bootleg for twenty-four before I'm 21 (mathematics) 
 Going to jail 'cause I'm drunk at Piggly-Wiggly (dagnabbit) 
 'Cause I be here and I do my time 
 'Cause I can't make bail on minimum wage 
 Nothing to do in the country but get 
 Drunk and watch that pendulum sway 
 Back in the saddle again 
 Throw my middle finger up to the law 
 I ain't gotta rob nobody tonight 
 But I might do it just because 
 I am a nut, I get bored 
 Did some pills but I want more 
 Fuck this world, fuck this town 
 If I fuck you once I fuck you sore 
 Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit goddamn 
 Pussy cunt bitch suck a cock 
 If you want some of this rock'n'roll 
 Take this pipe, suck this rock 
 Just a flock, super-hot 
 Clean 'em up, grab a mop 
 Catfish on my shit, fuck with me you gonna get dropped 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy 
 You don't want it with me motherfucker 
 I promise I put you with the piranhas inside of a shallow swamp 
 And then make you follow a boat full of drinking water 
 And sing to you lullabies 
 While I sip on nas under umbrellas. 
 Got a propeller sharp enough to eat through a two footed 
 Root of a tree, if it's onto me then it's cool like it's moving 
 So why do you think I fucking hate it 
 Or lay a log in front of my boat and put a stop to what I do buddy whatever 
 When I get up in the morning I think about 
 When it's all over they can put my body up in the river 
 With everything I did for the culture 
 Inside of a book and light a candle for my mama who got sick on the fucking fame 
 Immediately media will follow me to the end of the river 
 While the people around my body deliver rhythms and syllables, relevant to my scripture 
 I'm a sick son of a bitch, do you get the picture? 
 My fucking name is Catfish, really though 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea 
 Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy
