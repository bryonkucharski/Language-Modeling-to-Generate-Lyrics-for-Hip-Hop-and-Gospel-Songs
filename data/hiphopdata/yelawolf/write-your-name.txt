I'll write your name, across the sky 
 And take away the stars, cause you light up the night 
 Feel as high as the moon 
 When you're here with me 
 That's why I'm gonna write your name 
 For the world to see 
 Another old man on the porch with the bottle 
 Wind blows and the old rockin' chair wobbles 
 He's just the wavin', everybody's welcome 
 All he can say about the youth is Lord help 'em 
 Got a couple grand babies, but they never call though 
 Left him in the south and they moved to Chicago 
 Wife's in heaven and, hes saying ever since 
 Vietnam life's been hard as a veteran 
 Simple life, just a six pack, yeah ice cold 
 Across the Georgia line for a ticket for the lotto 
 Probably never see his name in the headlines 
 But if I had a plane, I'd put it in the sky 
 Alabama 
 She's in love, yeah, Friends call her crazy 
 Met him at a party, they started dating 
 Daddy's little angel, Momma's little lady 
 Only 16 now Brenda's got a baby 
 She can't afford to, drop out of high school 
 Jimmy's not a man and he can't provide you 
 He doesn't want to, but you keep it anyhow 
 Nine months down the road, what you gonna' do now 
 Go to the food stamp office and apply 
 You can find a job, it'll help you get by 
 And you made it when you didn't know how 
 Now that's a real star put her name in the clouds 
 Alabama 
 You may never be on television or be the one 
 Your boss at work loves givin' you employee of the month 
 May never be the first string on a championship team 
 You may be the star the world just hasn't seen 
 But that don't make you any less of a star to God 
 Being rich is only realising it's all a facade 
 You're richer than you think in that old small town 
 Cause people like you make the world go round 
 Alabama
