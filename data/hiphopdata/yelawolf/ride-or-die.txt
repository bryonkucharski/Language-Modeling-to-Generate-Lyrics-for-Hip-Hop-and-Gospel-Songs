We was thick as thieves growing up 
 Both of us raising hell 
 Chasing liquor with liquor 
 Racing and chasing tail 
 You got caught with a nickel bag and then went to jail 
 You sat it out for a week because your mama didn't have bail 
 I rode my bike to your house as soon as you got out 
 Remember laughing at the cops and then I took you straight to the spot 
 I moved away for some years to Atlanta, Georgia but stayed the same 
 My troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain 
 We kept in touch every week and I noticed the change 
 You wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing 
 And I was too wild to get it, admittedly so 
 But I supported your move no matter which way that you rolled 
 I guess you made a good choice, graduated with honors 
 Got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar 
 And as for me I got worse 
 I found myself in a curse 
 Dropped out of school for a dream 
 A dream I didn't rehearse 
 You hit me up 'cause you knew when you saw me I was bad off 
 But I was too proud to ask for the help 'cause I knew the cost 
 But you offered a place to stay 
 Until I could find my way 
 You helped me go find a gig 
 Clean up and get it straight 
 Never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up 
 As we sat talking on the bed of your lifted truck 
 You had it all and I had nothing 
 I'm just saying that meant something brother 
 If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound 
 I'll never let you down, I can't let you down 
 Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground 
 You'd do anything to help me out 
 You never let me down 
 What goes around comes around 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 It's been a while since I seen my friends, family and such 
 Six months a year on the road, I never get to visit that much 
 Even though it took me ten years to break a crack in this rock 
 Now that I started this movement, I got no plans to stop 
 Now you may see me in publications and radio placements 
 A new truck, a new Harley, and think I forgot how I made it 
 But ain't a day that goes by that I don't recall the struggle 
 Scared to death to go back to it, I constantly hustle 
 I thank you for my ambition 
 For the strength to condition 
 Anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision 
 It takes a village to raise a child 
 For me it took small towns 
 Everything that I learned from it 
 The ups and the downs 
 My Uncle Buddy, he gave me a thousand dollars to make a tape 
 Back in '02, when I could barely afford a plate 
 And he couldn't afford it either, but he did it anyhow 
 And now he wears a thousand dollar smile, Uncle Bud 
 If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound 
 I'll never let you down, I can't let you down 
 Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground 
 You'd do anything to help me out 
 You never let me down 
 What goes around comes around 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die 
 This one's for my ride or die
