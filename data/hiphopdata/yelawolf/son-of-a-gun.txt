I look in the mirror sometimes and think about how it all started 
 Small town Alabama, from city life we departed 
 Not a single light in the street, morning was scary and dark 
 To a little boy catching the bus to school, 5:30 sharp 
 I used to make up songs to keep my mind from wondering 
 What was in the woods waiting for me, my stomach still rumbling 
 From the cereal diet 
 Even though mama was trying to do the best that she could 
 Alcohol made her violent 
 Her boyfriend was a prick, probably 26 
 Barely looked my direction and really didn't do shit 
 My animosity grew along with my anger 
 And impatience, disaster in school 
 My teachers knew I was trouble waiting 
 And I did too, admittedly but I liked it 
 Maybe I had to accept I'd always be uninvited to church events, football and family oriented stuff 
 But I never thought I had it rough 
 I embraced it, honestly, 'cause I knew how different I was 
 It made me a rebel and rebels made me feel welcomed and loved 
 I never knew my daddy, but they said that I was the same and what a shame, get your umbrella Wayne 
 Here comes the heavy rain 
 'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm 
 The bloodstain after a dogfight 
 The tornado to your alarm 
 Your hangover after a long night 
 I'm the snake outta your barn 
 That one mistake you ever did right 
 The gunpowder to your drum 
 I'm your son 
 The son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 If life is but a dream 
 I'm up the creek in a paddle boat 
 Streams full of snakes, demons, not even a ladder goes 
 Up high and over the Mississippi to see the ocean, so here I go floatin', yeah 
 But I made it a habit though 
 19 and tattooed, hell raisin', the neighborhood was the place and I made it home with the favorites 
 Quarter pound of that seeded Mexican trash slinging nickles 
 Making nothing and breaking even, just do it for tickles 
 Nashville's under icicles, the Methadone's penetratin' 
 Ecstasy-hungry, baited as an experimentation 
 No more chocolate-chip cookies, and porcelain jars 
 Morbid and dark are my role models, and old-school cars 
 Sickening and I'm lovin' it 
 I'm basking in half of it 
 Backstrokin' in sinnin' ways, a dagger to pastors 
 I never knew my daddy, but they said that I was the same and what a shame 
 Here come the cocaine in the heavy rain 
 'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm 
 The bloodstain after a dogfight 
 The tornado to your alarm 
 Your hangover after a long night 
 I'm the snake outta your barn 
 That one mistake you ever did right 
 The gunpowder to your drum 
 I'm your son 
 The son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 And you can tell that I still don't give a fuck 
 Still drinking whiskey I'm half-a-bottle already down 
 Slumerican-made man, Criminals all around 
 Seventy-thousand dollars a night isn't good luck 
 Livin' a story usin' my war as my shield 
 The truth, examined and recreated 
 The following's real: 
 Plenty of fatherless children fill up the pit in the buildin' 
 Usin' the mind for the feelin', it's just like poppin' a pill 
 And I'm takin' it in 
 Lost, and makin' a win 
 Thanks for the poems that you inspired, I'm rakin' it in 
 Never heard you say "give me five," so make it a ten 
 Keep the change 'cause I'm ballin', look at the bastard of him 
 When I went to jail for the first time, I thought about you 
 Son of a bitch, I admit it, I guess the rumours are true 
 'Cause when I look in the mirror, I see from what I 'came 
 Trial by fire, pain, heavy rain 
 'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm 
 The bloodstain after a dogfight 
 The tornado to your alarm 
 Your hangover after a long night 
 I'm the snake outta your barn 
 That one mistake you ever did right 
 The gunpowder to your drum 
 I'm your son 
 The son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun 
 Son of a gun
