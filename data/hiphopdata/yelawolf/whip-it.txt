Ye, ye, ye- Yela (x2) 
 (1st Verse) 
 We hit the club, tore it up 
 Mally Mall's got model sluts 
 Fearin' and Loathin' in Las Vegas, party, party, bottles up! 
 I'm feeling like a king, someone tell me where my robe is? 
 This nitrous oxide got me feeling like Moses 
 Laughin' it up, laughin' loud 
 Twist it up until you tappin' out 
 But Yelawolf ain't throwing in the towel 
 Take a pull buddy, how you sound? 
 My voice feeling like I just swallowed a frog 
 I think I'm Mr. T, I think I'm Boss Hog 
 (Get, get, get) getttie up, promenade 
 Rip it up, hit the stage 
 Outta my mind yeah, wanna go craze 
 Feeling like I wanna float around for days 
 She's all about it, she's getting rowdy 
 She like to party! So whip it shawty! 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge! 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 (2nd Verse) 
 Baby you and maybe you 
 Need to come back to the naked room 
 Whip it, whip, get with it 
 I'll open you up like a Baby Ruth 
 She's getting ripped, she's getting striped 
 Swimming in a funk 
 I watch her skinny dip 
 You wanna feel ill, wanna get real 
 Wanna pop a pill feel out of control 
 Wanna know what I'm into though 
 That N2O 
 And cloud 9 is somewhere down below 
 Get on my level, look at the light show 
 You lay back in the way back of the Maybach or lay back on the Lazy Boy 
 You can pay me back with a BJ in the 'Lac here enjoy! 
 She's all about it, she's getting rowdy 
 She like to party! So whip it shawty! 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge! 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 (3rd Verse) 
 Crazy youth, yeah, that trashy life 
 I'm getting high, I'm in my after life 
 Rock star no holds barred 
 Got new hoes sitting in old cars 
 And I'm feeling like the world is mine 
 Arms wide open 
 One country at a time, middle fingers up 
 F-ck critics, nitrous in a bottle 
 Bitch whip it! 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge! 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 You gotta charge, I gotta charge 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard 
 Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
