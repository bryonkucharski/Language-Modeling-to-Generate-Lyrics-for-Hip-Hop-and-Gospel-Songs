The birth 1986 Brooklyn USA -- just signed the contracts today 
 Happy but later on came dismay -- Yo, where is my pay 
 Just wrote the lyrics to DJ Innovator 
 We throw the record out now and then you pay later 
 OK naive me -- the first plot for the Rock 
 Billboard spot achieved without a bullet so what now 
 I wanna stimulate the crowd but how? 
 Should I just sample James Brown 
 And then I'll just have the same sound 
 I did it anyway and yo it came off 
 The beat was abrupt word caught up 
 Part 2 only a chosen few knew 
 That it was hot so Chubb Rock was on his way 
 To express his many views 
 What record comes next do you haev a clue 
 The brain waves steady on impulse power 
 A song it never took an hour 
 You make an ass out of you and me if you assume 
 The popeye tune didn't boom didn't create a hip-hop recital 
 The focal point for the first arrival 
 Yes like in yes y'all land 
 Chubb Rock don't you hear success calling 
 So I pick up the phone then answer 
 Make it uptempo for the dancers 
 Floors exploding, club heads voguing 
 Journalists looking at the Billboard slogan 
 Number one rap records of the year "Treat 'em" 
 From Jack the Rapper to the South of Medem 
 Reign on the charts like a thunderstorm 
 Verbal lightning 'cause I sound exciting 
 Minstrel shows never ever done 'em 
 Find the Uncle Tom who did it, gun 'em then we sun 'em 
 Play a cannonball and like Hannibal Lect it 
 Silence up the Lambs 'cause they're screaming like some next shit 
 Flow like the Nile, I'll smile at the file pile 
 Dial for the sure best guess test West, Kyle 
 Scandal and controversy 
 I'll throw Joan in the River if she hurts me 
 Sasparillar Diller Phyllis, bill us or kill us, Willis Bruce 
 Die Hard this album is the damn proof 
 Coming stronger and stronger hard like Long Donga Silver 
 For crews who will pilfer 
 The big man, the biggest of the large man clan 
 Ku klux that's for red neck fucks 
 I'm sorry 'cause I'm not about profanity 
 But racism let's me lose my sanity 
 It's a sin it's a sin that's born within 
 I know it's wack they're trying to kill the black 
 So every single and album I hit the problem 
 And all the copyright thieves I got 'em 
 Respect The Chubbster it's written in the bible word up 
 And credit The Arrival
