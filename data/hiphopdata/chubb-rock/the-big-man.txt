(Verse One) 
 The bigger of the biggest made a hitlist 
 Not a lot of people, but a sequel, so witness 
 The evolution of a seed planted four years ago 
 And now the offspring today is the new thing 
 The people wanna jock but if they won't here's a quote: 
 Jealousy has arisen but don't - sweat it 
 And in this particular case - don't let it 
 Hold you back from pledging allegiance to this 
 And your girl wants a kiss but I have my own miss 
 On my side till the skeezer in me died 
 Like the (?) to the John, the Crosby to the Bing 
 The Dave is to the Benny and the Big Man is ready 
 To take a stand for all big man-kind 
 And I'm gonna succeed with the rhyme 
 So potent that a consultant said that rappin' rodents 
 Have two-thirds of my intelligence quotient and knowin' 
 Just that, secures me from all the muskrats 
 And my degree tells me I don't must rap 
 But the fans of hundreds of grands know I slam 
 Love the jams of the Big Man - chorus!
