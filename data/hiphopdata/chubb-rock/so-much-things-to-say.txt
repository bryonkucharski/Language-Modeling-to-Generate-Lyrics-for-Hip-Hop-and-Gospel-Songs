Yeah '91 did alright thanks to the man upstairs 
 Impressed all the peers 
 Now in '92 I find a brand new crew 
 That's real raw and go back on four 
 With the one to make gigantic funds 
 On the stage not with water guns 
 Oh I shouldn't say that, did they play that 
 There's a grudge the budget did pay that 
 Oh I did that's a fib close that lid 
 And you look at all the things in my crib 
 Not you or him but all, you want to end this shit make a call 
 I'm a man so you mice become men 
 Let's squash this shit and maybe then 
 We can say we're friends, to forget that 
 You niggaz are weak and cheap like a triple fat 
 Check your sound and roundin no poundin 
 I'm Johnny Weismuller watching you drown and 
 Like lotto, orugh is the motto, Ricky Ricardo 
 Taxi has Elaine Nardo 
 Everyone has a title and they're idle 
 This recital refrains from the bible 
 Oh the Titans are the Tions tie ins 
 Cry in the hanky franky where's the fly ins 
 Or sample, example gold on the mantle 
 And no lyrics stand still 
 Friends trade em, rate em, never hate them 
 Or pay them and you can quote them verbatim 
 Yes the Chubbster, Hustler or the Rustler 
 Man with the planb I crush and you're just an imitator 
 Faker, five me a break, a taker 
 See you laer with a litigator 
 I'm from JA MA ICA 
 Not from Warner, Sony or RCA 
 We need a label based and run in Mecca 
 For the time I'm here stuck on Elektra 
 So I flex, plex and then I jet and now I'm vexed 
 Cause haven't seen my check 
 Portrait of a madman debuts today 
 With so much things to say
