Pmd 
 Das efx 
 And the c-h-u-double b 
 Beef 
 Here we go 
 (Chubb rock) 
 I arrive from the steps of sinai 'cause I'm fly 
 When you're high from the lye 
 You see me mingle in the sky 
 The dim light superceeds the street cock fight 
 Straight heterosex, but I still dig van, ya dyke 
 From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship 
 The brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past islip 
 And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that fugee-la voodoo 
 Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto 
 I barb you like bobbito, the airport, right through heathrow 
 Release murder niggas like ito 
 Pure hatred, 'cause he picked who he picked to mate with 
 Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it 
 Hey revamp the swing to parlay 
 How black power went sour, where's brother jay? 
 Where's the 'pink cadillacs protected by' whoever? 
 The red and the black, green, hilfiger nigga 
 Indians wanna protect the lone howling chief 
 So kids create beef 
 Beef 
 Back in the days when we had nothin' but beef 
 At the end you may lose nothin' but teeth 
 That's fly 
 But nowadays ask kids 
 When they have beef, you might die 
 Why? 
 (Skoob) 
 While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that 
 I'm with my soldiers in the rover, never sober, fuck that 
 Yo dun, I run with wild crooklyn niggas with gats 
 Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack 
 My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin' 
 And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin' 
 When I rock with chubb you block show me love 
 Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood 
 (Krazy drazy) 
 Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name 
 I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game) 
 You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet 
 Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit 
 The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight 
 We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right 
 We like some crabs in a barrel tryin' to get on top 
 The hit squad, chubb rock represent hip-hop 
 So kill the beef 
 (Pmd) 
 Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988 
 I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state 
 Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows 
 Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes 
 Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin' up the game 
 But me you can't tame, an outlaw like jesse james 
 We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest 
 Who's the best? but let it rest, because there's no contest 
 Temptation, accusations need to stop 
 Unify hip-hop, pmd, chubb rock 
 (Chubb rock) 
 Now - I will come back to the groove 
 Now my man common on wax slayin ice cube - anyway, that's cool 
 That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin' 
 And of course there's that famous beef between parrish and sermon 
 And that's cool, both those niggas killed jane 
 And now there's nice without smooth - that's insane 
 And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease 
 Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef 
 Beef 
 Beef 
 Back in the daa-ays 
 Beef 
 Beef 
 Back in this day there's beef 
 Beef 
 Back in the day there was beef 
 Beef 
 That shit got to cease 
 Peace!
