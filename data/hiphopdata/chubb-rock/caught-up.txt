Well I'm nimble 
 And I'm nice like kris kringle 
 But Joe I got caught, caught, got swindled 
 Me and a couple of boys at Kings Plaza 
 Walkin' through the mall to see if they had a 
 Couple of shirts, a few pants 
 Just out of the blue, went, took a glance 
 In front of Macy's I seen two girly-girlies 
 One looked def, the other looked like Mr. Furley 
 With my ego trip, my Wilson flip 
 I used my lip to get both on the sneak tip 
 Then I sicced it 
 Kicked it to the ugly one 
 Souped her up, I called her Lipton and honey one 
 Things like that, gibberish and crap 
 She's a skeezer, there's no need for chit or chat 
 Her body looks (log?), kinda good, yeah, but 
 As for her face, Jabba The Hut 
 I shoulda played Michael Jackson, told her to beat it 
 I said, what the heck, I got a condom, freak it 
 Her nickname now is Mona the rover 
 She looks like a dog so I dogged it on the sofa 
 Some dumb reason though, it was fun 
 Now she's looking good to me, I'm caught up 
 Part one 
 I'm in love with an ugly girl, but hey, 
 I'm gonna kick it to the pretty one today 
 She seems nice and she's a fly cutie 
 Caller her up I said hi my name is Chubbs her name was Judy 
 I don't have to tell you guys the rest 
 But I asked her to go out, she said yes 
 Took her to the movies and then to my house 
 Led the girl straight to the couch 
 Like a game, I have to score 
 Dim the lights, get the two-ply condom from the drawer 
 Took off her shirt and only then I asked the question 
 Yo? who broke wind? something smells bad, dang, it won't let up! 
 It was Judy, the cutie! yo, word up! 
 So now I got an ugly girl and one with the smell 
 But which one should I choose? oh well 
 I'm caught up 
 I know I'm hard, 'cause I'm Chubb Rock 
 But even to my chest I got a soft spot 
 That could easily be ripped apart 
 I'm hard like the Tin Man but I got a heart 
 Every night it seems I stay home sick 
 Trying to figure out which girl will I pick 
 Ripping my heart, damaging my soul 
 All these problems because of a little hole 
 And recreation in a bed 
 But Mona and Judy are getting me fed 
 Up to the point I couldn't even hold my own 
 I was like E.T. -- I had to phone home 
 To ask my mom a question she always knows 
 She says Chubby, follow your heart and your nose 
 Be celibate -- no girl, be a loner 
 But I picked the ugly girl yeah, I picked Mona
