Intro/Chorus: 
 Ninety-two! The rebel comes back 
 I wanna go home, so won't you please go home 
 I wanna go home, so won't you go home 
 I wanna go home, so won't you please go home 
 I wanna go home, so nigga go home 
 Verse One: 
 Yo, it's burning in Paris, Demaris, the madness, I've had this 
 The sadness, even Gladys, lost her Pips 
 It means it's time to make a trip to Johannesburg 
 I don't care -- what the word is about 
 Cause my history has to spout 
 From all over the land while I eat some trout 
 Cause America, my motherland ain't hearing ya 
 If I can catch her, Thatcher damn I'll use my Derringer 
 Political polls calls for death tolls, bullet holes 
 Wolves in the fold 
 The sum can't be greater than the whole 
 But many have died -- died while they cried 
 Pearl Harbord ninety-two, that's the idea 
 I mean Port Natal it's right there 
 The revolution won't be televised this time 
 The schematics draw from the mind 
 Besides physical we need mental fighters 
 For the destruction of the vipers 
 The coffee without the sugar and the cream is too strong 
 And we're back where we belong 
 Verse Two: 
 The winners, legends or beginners 
 Get on the scene and then they turn into sinners 
 Yes they say they're a born again christian 
 Read a bible but they're really on a mission 
 That's hostile so sing your gospel 
 Check the region of the first man fossil 
 Plain truth embedded in hieroglyphics 
 The specifics of American civics get real sticky 
 Rap has put it back on track 
 With hard core conscious rap 
 But magazine fiends aim for the gut 
 What should I do? Keep my mouth shut? 
 Hell no! The editor scandal predator 
 Hip-Hop predator racist pig etcetera 
 Political henchmen why you never mention 
 Is it because you're trying to save your pension? 
 A lot of power and strength locked away in prison 
 Yeah yellow journalism 'cause we delete love 
 And push the word in our songs 
 And we're back where we belong 
 Verse Three: 
 We need some kind of power, some kind of skill 
 Keep one FB-I/eye open cause you know they wanna kill us 
 'Cause we're dangerous to their plan 
 We rule the whole damn land 
 Basketball, baseball, music, TV, movies, even art 
 But they're smart 
 Somehow makes us fight among ourselves 
 Place pictures of our prophets upon their shelves 
 They kill this, kill that one, paid us to kill him 
 Such a bright future now looks dim 
 But the empire will strike back with much more than a rap 
 How're you gonna react 
 I once said burn the plueprints on the counterattack to redeem 
 Causer racial peace is our dream 
 But it's a dream we have that won't come true 
 We've been talking peace for a few 
 Black is not, it never left 
 I don't need no beads placed around my chest 
 To be considered a black man 
 A picture of Malcolm is not on my wall 
 He's in my heart, that's smart 
 And then there's Uncle Toms that's partial 
 And kids that don't know Thurgood Marshall 
 Grab gold of reality G real strong 
 We're going back to where we belong
