 Nuff respect's due to the funky crew ribbit 
 Bitch burned me with some next shit 
 I realize ya straight up fucking someone new 
 And all those rumors are so true 
 That you been fucking the whole damn crew 
 Ya little ribbit 
 I am the all around totally extraterrestrial entertaining motherfucker 
 Let me tell you bitch you burned me with the motherfucker 
 I was walking through the park one day 
 In the merry merry month of May 
 And I buck up to this squaw that gave me the funky 
 And let me tell you 'bout this pussy, ha ha 
 She burned me hard and stiff 
 Yes me hard and stiff Chubbs, tell them Chubbs tell them 
 Ribbit ribbit

 Well off we go to the show and flow to the venue 
 This little hot bitch was on the menu 
 Dance to the tune they said the hoe was a boom 
 But I'm married, my ass got carried to the room 
 But delph, in layman's language for self 
 And I'm in love -- in love with my health 
 So honey phone while I click the Nick Nolte 
 And down a can of beer and watch Cape Fear yeah 
 Watch DeNiro my hero fry like a clown 
 It's all for one I hope you have some 
 Slown down as the puss from the hot itchy burning little stunt 
 I bet on is what you really want 
 Cause by the cheek smile, eyes that are hazel 
 You know who's really vex -- my man nasal 
 The nigga who ate the sauteed shrimp and basil 
 Bitch stay still I'm not over with you yet 
 My man got burnt now it's time to fret 
 Airport bathroom I wasn't too far to hear my man go 
 Ooh 
 Burning -- yes he's yearning call his folks 
 911 is a Joke -- I can't see through the smoke 
 Lyrical monkey son he's stunnin G 
 Cause you got the funky
