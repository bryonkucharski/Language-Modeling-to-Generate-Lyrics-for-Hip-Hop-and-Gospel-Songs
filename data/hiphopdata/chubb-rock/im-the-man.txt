Well real smooth connected to the deep end bass groove 
 I set the precedent for emcees to lose 
 More than a spelling B it's compelling me 
 To let the I come before the E except after C to the H 
 To the you to the double-B, we respect that name cause the rock just G'd 
 All over the commercial hard like Herschel 
 The verse will insult but don't take it personal 
 Everybody knows that I'm the man and 
 Always got a positive plan for the fans 
 First concerns as the world turns 
 To expose the racists like Howard Sterns 
 George Burns, oh my God, takes a black comedian and he learns 
 Make more greens than ferns 
 Horticulture is not my main subject 
 The subject is microphone check one two 
 And you don't stop the royalty fees 
 The Chubbster you know he's 
 "Gonna get the night on fire..." 
 Anyway you put it when you see me you know that I'm the man 
 Hypothetically speaking who's speaking at the function 
 Well it's some genius who lives by the Junction 
 He's coming from a Harvard socialite luncheon 
 Yo -- I hear his jeep clunking 
 A jeep -- doesn't he make enough ends? 
 A genius like him should drive a Benz 
 Well he believes clothes don't make the man or a car 
 And the man still makes five hundred grand 
 Every six months yo the kid is no dunce 
 And he doesn't drink and refuses to smoke blunts 
 Cause the black must clear the smoke and grab the throttle 
 And stop livin' in a bottle 
 The Constitution starts tearin 
 I hope you hear what Gil Scott was Heron/hearin 
 The destruction of the pirates will calm the seas 
 The brilliant man you know he's 
 "Gonna set the night on fire..." 
 Any female structure? Biologically I'm the man
