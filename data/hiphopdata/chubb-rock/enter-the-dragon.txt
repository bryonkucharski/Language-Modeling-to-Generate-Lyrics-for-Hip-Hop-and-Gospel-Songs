Enter the sensei, praise while I pose in the stance 
 Dance or some bust ass advance so to enhance 
 Your appreciation for one creation 
 That God didn't make a mistake to make 
 Flake if you wanna, gonna, hauna, trama, go tell ya mama 
 And your honor my actions don't believe the drama 
 During the chorus found Chuck Norris and so then yo Chucky 
 You had juice you fought Bruce and now you wanna duck me 
 And hug me damn Vanilla Chutney 
 You wanna shut me down like Chuck D 
 And I will kill, act ill, thrill with skill, Bill 
 And then I ass whip and I then skip 
 To the loo 'n' wax you and your crew and 
 Give a liter to some damn pupil booin 
 Like Uh yo, you, sensei rock 
 Act like you know a judo a chop chop chop 
 You know I walk down the streets of the Soho in Tokyo 
 On my arm no Yoko Ono so yo 
 I don't know the vibes or the lives at the rice with chives 
 After the rice with chives is giving me hives 
 I don't know what to say about the place 
 I mean everybody here has a smile on their face 
 So I'm rolling with the scenery and glad I came 
 If I see some o ill shit like black rain I'm O-U-T 
 Three strikes and take some Sony kid off his bike 
 And be ghost and step hard like a dyke 
 Yeeeeesssss Bruce Lee was the best 
 But the kid also drank more wine than they did on Falcon Crust 
 But no juice or blunt or stunt or brew 
 Or tres or hate or friends or crews 
 Will never stop Chubbs and draw four Uno 
 Act like you know a judo a chop chop chop 
 Why did you leave the palace when I told you not to 
 And now I have to put on the Gee and chop you 
 Into pieces not Reese's I hope no one yo see this 
 Cause your whipping will be the topic of my thesis 
 John Saxon please bow to the captain 
 Before you're waxing ignore all the clapping 
 That you're hearing, cause you half stepped on preparing 
 Your style, so be gone with the smile, I'll 
 Listen to your lest request, the S off your chest went West 
 And know yo test the last cess 
 That you're gonna get ya mess 
 Puff the blunt then begin to fret 
 You use the crane and I think I will start with the tiger 
 To extract all the blood and saliva 
 And puncture your structure with the art of the Sumo 
 Bow and act like you know, a judo, a chop chop chop
