Verse One: Red Hot Lover Lover Tone 
 Diggedy da-di-la-di-da-di, baby there's a party 
 But you can't have a party without a large Bacardu 
 You got to keep the hottie moving like a Maserati 
 A hundred million women wanna Tone up their body 
 And I can never pass up a chance to romance them 
 Don't call me soft just because I'm handsome 
 So money take a tip if you flip and you slip 
 You'll be using all your teeth for poker chips 
 So wiggedy word wiggedy word I don't smoke the herb 
 And if my hottie smokes the shit I'll kick her to the curb 
 Every morning breakfast in bed is served 
 Cause on women I haev an affect like a quadra verb 
 So can I whip yes what yes like buddha sess yes 
 Shot 'em all dead when they try to test 
 So keep me in like Flynn this year I'm gonna win 
 If my balls are on your chin then you got the D.I.Y.M. 
 So can I get a shout 
 Peace to Chubb Rock, TrakMasters, the Gigalos and I'm out 
 Yabadabadoo 
 Verse Two: Chubb Rock 
 Wow look at the size of his chest 
 Never the less I jump upon ET list and then phone my home 
 Before the little kitten throws a stone 
 The holder of the Rock, one two and ya don't stop 
 Rhythm to the dism while the ism forms a prism 
 Suck the dism stand like a Chisolm dimension prison and is he 
 The One, The One, he says he's the one, the only one 
 Take the two subtract the one and uh-hhuh 
 He's handsome ya see, big strong and sturdy 
 Watch the birdy I'm nerdy on the IQ set 
 Caught nuff wreck 
 The grim reapear what said Charlier Brown's damn teacher 
 Wa wah wah wa wa wah, damn 
 I cram to understand the plan ma'am 
 I mean I've been hitting the books for a long time now 
 Real long time now, look at the furrowed brow 
 Drink Slim Faster, delete the chow 
 For a strong sequel word up to the people 
 The people; you mean power to them 
 While Eastwood Clint plays misty for the buddha 
 He's buzzing, cummin at cha 
 And you know we had to watcha, time for some lyrics 
 While I kick it and you hear it 
 Even Helen Keller word up can hear it 
 From the rustler lyrical hustler 
 The fat lady sand I crusher her, word up the Chubbster 
 Yabadabadoo 
 Verse Three: Rob Swinga 
 Rob Swinga loves jazz so I'ma swing this like a cool cat 
 Down with A.T.E.E.M., Trakmasterz got a dope rap 
 Humongous vocals; I'm quick to flick a jab 
 I'm not Michael Jackson or the Chubbs but I'm bad 
 Chew up a sucker like a stick of gum 
 And then I spit out the bum once the flavor's done 
 I'm nifty powerful like an M-60 
 And I'll pop your girl like Jiffy popped Dippy 
 Well I swing a lyric like a swinga would 
 And I swing a hoe in bed like a swinga should 
 When it comes to getting hoes I'm rated quadruple X 
 Just like Dr. Ruth my mind is strictly on the sex 
 And style or position is my selection 
 But I won't play without my contraception 
 Like Ramsey's or Trojan's oh yes that's chill 
 If worse comes to worse then I use no frills 
 So check it check it check it check it check it one two 
 Yabadabadoo
