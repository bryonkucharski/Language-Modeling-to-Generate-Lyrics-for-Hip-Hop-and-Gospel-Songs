Just like on A.T.E.E.M, I'm an addict, I'm an adict 
 Back at the crib I just cause nothing but static 
 I think my mama-san is pissed and vexed 'cause she's had it 
 Snooped and found my stash in the attic 
 Not tickled pink she threw my my shit in the sink 
 My gut is rumbling now I have to think 
 My sister's jewelry, take it, no more jingling 
 On the crazy down low take my mom's wedding ring 
 And float on to the shop called the pawn 
 And he gives me two yards and my disregard to nothing 
 The antonym of a hero 
 I used to be the one now I'm less than zero 
 But I can feel like a million real fast 
 Put my lips on the god damn glass 
 And make a little snow using the snowman 
 I can't help it I need some blow man 
 I used to get A's across the board now it's down to H's 
 And the H's stand for hatred 
 Kicked a lot of bogusness, conned out of rehab 
 It was easy -- my man worked at the lab 
 So I jetted like the Concord but I made a crash landing 
 Got back on the glass cause life is demanding 
 First thing to do now is to get a little pistol 
 I like to smoke blow but I don't like eating gristle 
 So the hoody comes on while I'm hiding in the corner 
 Just run ya doe or your mom will be a mourner 
 The blow make me actlike I don't know 
 And my ego and my moral go into escrow 
 The kid that I robbed the other day was my bro 
 Face covered by the hoody yo should he 
 Care about his worthless bro -- the answer no 
 I can't help it I gotta get some blow 
 My mom was sponsoring a child from Zimbabwe 
 Whem I'm on the pipe man I have to get my way 
 Donating about twenty dollars a week 
 80 dollars a month for that I get a blunt 
 Everyday I puff several trees 
 What do I care if he eats every other day 
 What am I saying, I can't believe I'm a junkie 
 I can't believe it yo Frank Nitty punch me 
 Suicide is too good, I need something harder 
 Maybe go cold turkey, that'll hurt me 
 Sweat drips on my back I react with a shiver 
 Eye flutters while my mom closes her shutters 
 She doesn't believe that I'm trying -- my body dying 
 She thinks I found a new way of lying 
 While I revolve the revolver, my mom hears the tune 
 I'm sorry mom *BOOM*
