Check it out Rock autobiography I 
 Realize realize that I'm fly 
 Like an insect I'll insert the fluid 
 Then you ask how did a roughneck do it 
 Or did that, sit back listen to this hardcore tridack 
 Not widdack criddack 
 Neve got embedded in the sould of a genius 
 From the tip of my toe to me penis, I mean this 
 Like a fabric from a seamstress, I'll cut you like a hem 
 Hack you like phlem 
 And friends are hard to find so be careful 
 Said by my man The R here's another earful 
 My gear will attract a lot of people 
 So much that I might make a sequel 
 Like Stallone the road is real Rocky 
 Bust I stand alone 
 And my hand might roam up the dress 
 Of someone totally with it 
 A half an hour later she was frigid 
 The pubic box was locked locked 
 Word up, I'm the key, word up, ME 
 A black fellow I don't need a damn cello or a violin to win 
 Put girls on their knees like they're saying a prayer 
 Gas their headache with some lyrical Bayer 
 Ibuprofen put you in the mood to elope 
 When I find the right squaw nah 
 I remember the words of Jerry Resnick 
 Never let a girl put you to the exit 
 Word up and I thank this, the one man skit 
 I wanna pop nuff shit 
 I wanna pop nuff shit, word up straight up 
 No falsehoods, n othing ain't made up 
 Like Cuomo my style goes two ways like a homo 
 I no I won't do no Prom Mo oh so 
 Hoe, say hoe when the back shot is, Given 
 Robin, it's time for slobbing 
 Some old near nod your head 
 Will bob like Celestin Miss, naive here'es a weapon 
 Get your momma sister to do me at once 
 Don't forget the champagne 
 The ketchup the Neiz not Hunts ketchup so you can catchup 
 To the stunts a blunt like weed 
 My squaws exceed those of Prince 
 And ever since he made Graffiti Bridge 
 I was developing this Purple Rain one man kind of skit 
 I wanna pop nuff shit, peace
