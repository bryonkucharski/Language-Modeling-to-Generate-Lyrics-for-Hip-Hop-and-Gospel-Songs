This is an introduction 
 To music that just be pumpin' 
 While hits just be dippin' 
 The intention is for humpin' the floor 
 Shinin' the wood with our jeans 
 If it's denim, don't worry 
 It's hip hop, don't hem 'em 
 Money earnin' concernin' 
 I'll be teachin' and learnin' 
 Gettin' hot from my rhymes and my looks 
 Not from bourbon 
 No solution, no remedy 
 No cure like a deodorant 
 Yo, you have to be sure 
 That if you talk up or walk up into myface 
 That wouldn't become a big public disgrace 
 'Cause I'll ban you, burn you up, and tan you 
 Treat you like the elephant 
 And man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid 
 Hangin' on a wall in Michael Jackson's crib 
 'Cause I'm bad, in fact I'm a thriller 
 I drink milk, that's why I'm a top biller 
 Like a funeral home, I'll make a killing 
 I'm not Giz even though I'm still chillin' 
 Guys say I'm scary, girls say I'm cuddly 
 Rough like bark but dark and lovely 
 This ain't no game and I'm no toy 
 And like Anita Baker, I'll bring you joy 
 With my word when I open my mouth 
 Ask Oliver North to go and break south 
 A homo is a no-no but you know I'll smack a faggot 
 Boy, you got to see me, I'm rich like Jimmy Swaggart 
 I'm a loon and ya know, comin' soon 
 A rhyme kicked to this Popeye tune 
 This is hip hop with a little be-bop 
 And I won't flop 'cause I can't stop 
 I will mop up the slop and then go to the top 
 'Cause I'm not Robocop, I'm Chubb Rock 
 I'm Chubb Rock risin' and I'll break your leg 
 And I'm more than a forty ounce, I'm more like a keg 
 And I'm the big dipper, rippin' like Jack the Ripper 
 And if you want the proof, the proof is in my liquor 
 So you knew it and you blew it, let's get to it 
 Gonna run you over with a rhyme that's like a big Buick 
 And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender 
 And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender 
 And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake 
 Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well 
 I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater 
 You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper 
 And paprika on your face, like mace 
 So you can taste immediately 
 Just like the base that went up your nose previously 
 So it seems you're too zooed to battle 
 Word's up chump, acne bump, skidaddle 
 You're a nine, I'm a ten 
 Victory is mine agai, this Bud's for me 
 So here, take a Heineken 
 With your self-esteem, you will never redeem 
 Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream 
 That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me 
 But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it 
 Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical 
 This is not the late show 
 And I'm not Arsenio Hall 
 But quite tall with the gall 
 And I have magic and I can play ball 
 And guys won't boo this, girls will just screw this 
 It's ludicrous but we can dothis 
 'Cause you're new to this, Brutus 
 I'm so smooth that I'm the smoothest 
 I'm not handsome but I am the cutest you ever had 
 That's why I'm so glad that I'm so good I'm bad
