Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities 
 Won't break bread or split the peas 
 But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups 
 Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits 
 Armani or maybe Versace 
 Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics 
 Judicial alcoholics 
 Cover up versions of death in the Persian 
 Now a right angle equals eighty degrees 
 The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE 
 The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros 
 Bush is steady watching us 
 How can we kill their Asiatic crew 
 Ah develop a harsh addictive brew 
 Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it 
 Part one of the hatred 
 The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's 
 I myself I can't stay calm 
 I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy 
 School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI 
 But my self inner-self breaks North 
 And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth 
 Of my heritage who will bring forth the people 
 In all people there lies that certain evil 
 The enemy within spreads to the next of kin 
 A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke 
 Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt 
 To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault 
 Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain 
 Put down the brew have a brain 
 The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake 
 Then comes the real hate 
 Why should you hate me? What have I done? 
 We all have eight fingers and two thumbs 
 To feel the oppression so every studio session 
 I try to kick a positive lesson 
 U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall 
 Brotherly love is melting like a candle 
 Humanity without human beings 
 They even said Chubb was against Koreans 
 I just wanted to state the facts 
 It seems that no one is against Blacks 
 Uh, what should we do? Should we run? 
 Uh, if we run we'll succumb 
 They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so 
 And the dark so rule the bank so 
 So you know that they're mad so 
 This style developed by Shabba Ranks so 
 And with that I wanna give thanks so 
 To the temperament of the strength of Miss Parks 
 But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark 
 The hatred
