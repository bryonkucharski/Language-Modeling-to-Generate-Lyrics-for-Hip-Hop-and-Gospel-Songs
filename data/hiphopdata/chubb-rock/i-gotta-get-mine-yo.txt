Because I really don't know if I really deserve this 
 I tried real hard this year took many risks 
 And so I feel I'm the lucky one so money son 
 Hasn't diluted the fun 
 Cause breaking it down until it's broke is no joke 
 I'ma continute to fracture the groove until I croak 
 Lyrics flow from the soul, the heart plays a part 
 Delivered like a dart 
 Stick to the wax, engraev in the lines 
 Music awards given to the rhymes 
 The Chubbster returns for the year ninety-two 
 Never doubt the clout, the stout 
 Figure of the person, your brains cells start bursting 
 When you're alone I know you start cursing 
 What is that makes him unusual 
 The rhyme 
 But yo, I gotta get mine yo 
 I gotta get mine yo 
 I propel lyrics like this 
 And then I attempt to get you to pump your fist 
 In the air yeah prepare to glare at the big chair 
 And the album isn't near a million 
 But several million cildren start clapping 
 Look at me like Patton 
 Am I in charge of entertainment 
 You can hear it pin the tail on the lyric 
 And then the fan base over there cheers it 
 Real loud, piercing the ear, can you bear it 
 But I'll go up and drop a rhyme yo, one time 
 Say ho bro and yo 
 I gotta get mine 
 Well it seems I ripped the show by the seams 
 Just like the several scenes in my dream 
 Came on top made a knot so the Rock 
 Just got three number one Billboard spots 
 So what should I do next for denerata 
 Chubb goes in the theater 
 Well it might but rapping on the mic comes first 
 And on TV they don't let you rap your verse 
 So come this summer if you see me on a tour 
 It won't be the same crew that you've seen before 
 But the crew in a different form will be back 
 Kicking buck wild style all smiles 
 I'll come again with a positive conscious rhyme 
 Cause bro yo, I gotta get mine yo
