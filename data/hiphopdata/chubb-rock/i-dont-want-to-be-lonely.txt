My better half steps, the door closes 
 Hence the realistic War of Roses 
 With history every war had an ending 
 With casualtoes, but half of these 
 Men, the battle was an ego thing 
 After I kick this rhyme Eric will sing 
 The true statement that lies here 
 Every day every month that's in a year 
 Has to be spent making this work 
 Sometimes I know that I act like a jerk 
 I have no experiences, I never felt this way 
 You misconstrue what I display 
 Love, honestry and trust is a must 
 Communication wrapped in lust 
 But being that I can't sing but the words are by me 
 I got a little help -- Eric sing it G 
 Passion easily mistaken for compassion 
 I know why you wanted to jet 
 No respect 
 I guess in that department I had a low rating 
 I remember in front of Crossland Savings 
 We said the magic words, I looked in your eyes 
 Blood percolates, hearts yells cries 
 For us to come together for better and for worse 
 I don't even know how to end this verse 
 Utopia, you're wishing and I'm hoping 
 We can keep on dancing to Michael Bolton 
 When a man loves a woman just like I do 
 Our joining will make little love struck crew 
 Love, honesty, trust is a must 
 Communication wrapped in lust 
 But being that I can't sing and the words are by me 
 I got a little help, Eric sing it G
