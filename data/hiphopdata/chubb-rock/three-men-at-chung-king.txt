(Featuring Red Hot Lover Lover Tone Grand Puba) 
 Check it out... 
 Verse One: Red Hot Lover Lover Tone 
 The pen hits the paper ink spills and fills the lines 
 With lyrics that thrills like my dillz 
 Take it on the Grilled Cheese tour then I drop it 
 Don't care about the niggaz cause the girls are gonna jock it 
 Take her to my hotel no speaking just freaking 
 Leave my door open so the niggaz can come peak in 
 Rip the nappy dug out niggaz bug out with the hopes 
 They can get theirs, but in the meantime they takin' notes 
 Here comes my kid, here comes my kid (ah) 
 But I caught him in the rubber lid, huh 
 Chitty chitty bang bang, gotta go gotta go 
 The hoe is in a coma so I tippy tippy toe 
 Walkin' in the dark (tripped) slipped on my shoe 
 (Arrrrgh! Oh shit!) [Tone is that you?] 
 Damn, more fornication 
 Puba take the mic 'cause I'm here for the duration 
 Verse Two: Grand Puba 
 Before I get this wreck I usually start with a 40 
 But forties are no more 'cause now I'm drinkin' 64's 
 Call on Grand Puba, Chubb Rock if you want it done 
 Hon spread the 411 as if her name was Kaity Chung 
 Into devil bashing, always stay in fashion 
 Love maxing and relaxing, hittin skins with a passion 
 As a shorty I kept some dice I banked on seven or eleven 
 'Cause my pops had it hard similar to James Evans 
 Now shit flipped, I'm on the hip-hop 
 To the beat you don't stop, rock on! 
 I kick the new type of lingo, hit the spot that'll tingle 
 Make the girls want to jingle, so they run and get the single 
 My simple task is to make you shake that ass 
 On the quick fast, and to make it last 
 It's just three men at Chung King getting busy 
 We've come a long way since Kunta Kintizzy 
 And you don't stop, rock on 
 Chubb Rock flip the script 'cause I'm gone 
 Verse Three: Chubb Rock 
 Yippi-yi-yeah, stay, hooray, yo, hurrah 
 I jumped up upon the mic with the Chubbster, Tone, plus the Pu-ba 
 Intricately go far 
 Chillin' in the mansion, nuff fashion (ah) 
 Relax, and dig into the track and react 
 I want a Martin Luther riff 'cause I don't like to pack my iron 
 Watchin kids on the corner buyin, gettin' zooted then lyin' 
 Test and I commence, to firing 
 One two three shots and then I tune the black watch 
 Reclean my cylinder and then I grab my crotch 
 And squeeze, the testes and then I grab my wood and cup it 
 Oh there goes the nut I just busted 
 Get myself together, 'cause I'm the man 
 I knew it, I wanted to do a duet with the Grand 
 Mystic ruler took the 40 out of the cooler 
 Now we're rippin the track, we shoulda did one sooner 
 And then we roll up on the groove field assist the team 
 And now I'm straighter than 9:15 
 Get a little dough for this three man skit 
 I'll end the jam with a curse 
 Uh, umm fuck? 
 Or is it damn? Or what? 
 SHIT. And slide out of the vocal booth and get a dollar Chung King 
 Soda 
 Grand Puba, Tone, plus now we're over and we're out
