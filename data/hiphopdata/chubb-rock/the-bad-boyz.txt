(Chubb Rock) 
 Chubb is a loveable Guy, not a Teddy Riley group 
 It deeply bruise me, greaves me if you say I'm soup 
 I'm really not, and I don't really think I am 
 But I'm convinced, that I can make a funky jam 
 So if you wanna, support the man that's gonna 
 Jump up on the scene deliver lyrics that are sorta mean 
 With the cream of the crop, Chubb Rock will never stop 
 Showin his intelligence quotient, things are potent 
 Prime time rhymes that's floatin blowin' and knowin' 
 That it's goin' to be considered the topic I've hithered 
 Feelings between the music scene 
 While I move to the groove like Akeem... Olujawon 
 The don upon the team that plays real calm, ego all gone 
 Chubb doesn't like to be hyper 
 I wait for my prey and then I react like a tiger 
 Clip up, pick up, rip them all up and 
 And then I heard my history callin 
 Readin readin, Chubb never had a clue 
 And this is not what I was taught in school and 
 Decoyed, made every grade was a ploy 
 That mislead the head of the Bad Boy - Robin! 
 (Ms. Robin - patois best guess) 
 A gwan Chubb, ah do gwan Chubb 
 A gwan Chubb, yes ah gwan Chubb 
 Oh a gwan Chubb, Lord ah gwan Chubb 
 Me nah stop Chubb till me get some cash 
 Ah Ms-ah-Robin ah de cream of de crop 
 Say lightning ah flash, an' thunder a clap 
 An' watch everything known as stars just a crash 
 The tea for the spoon and de fork on de plate 
 And de TV on de bed an' de watch said not 
 Now Lord Miss-ah-Robin say you no-oh-fi-chat 
 Ah-when you a-chat me say ya knot on bark 
 Ah wha gwan Chubb, yes a gwan Chubb, hmmm 
 (Chubb Rock) 
 Last summer, my tune went to number 
 Two on the countdown, I had a frown 
 On my grill 'cause I knew that until I went 
 To number one I couldn't consider myself The One 
 But The One came back with a hardcore devilish rap 
 Fully strapped, definitely aimed at 
 Things that made me, no one can pay me 
 Enough to sell out, call a bluff and huff 
 And blow the house down that I built 
 And meeting old homeboys like Giz and Milk 
 Definitely happy - Howie Tee kept me 
 On the level of a star so the squads can sweat me 
 Cause Chubb Rock always seem to rock the place 
 Peace to the homeboys Amityville and Mase 
 On the Anita Baker tip I'm gonna bring ya joy 
 The overjoy of the Bad Boy - Robin! 
 (Ms. Robin - patois best guess) 
 Dem ah come, Lord dem a come 
 Yes dem ah come, yes dem a come 
 A wicked go my tongue when de fire start burn 
 De wicked dem gon melt like ?? against sun 
 De fire a gon burn down de 'ouse of Sodom 
 De fire a gon burn down de man we touch by ?? 
 Lord dem a come, Lord dem a come 
 So dem have dem gone but me ah 'ave none 
 Me take off on di foot and me started to run 
 But when me come back me say di fight cyan't done 
 I'm suh-Robin come out wit de baddest can done 
 Lord dem a come, yes dem a come 
 Lord dem a come...
