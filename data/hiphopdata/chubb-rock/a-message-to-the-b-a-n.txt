1991 Grilled Cgeese goes on it's way to different cities 
 Rocking for the kiddies 
 To do shows for rows, no foes, dough in escrow 
 All the money went to goddamned Joe 
 For cleaning the bus, we cussed, caps were bust 
 On us, Joe should have adjust to the goddamn musk 
 We were the Christmas and Joe Damn was merry 
 And kids had nothing but jokes just like Perry 
 Every night at the show was a good night 
 Hot Dog and Ev in the morning had a food fight 
 Chicken all over, rice, ham, beverage, pastrami 
 Yo it was comedy -- The B.A.N. 
 Back on the bust take the musk to the next city 
 And snoring by Frank Nitty 
 I'ma tell you I was about to be outtie 
 Lucky for me that homeboy Kirk Gowdy 
 Brought his tapes so flexed 'cause we were vexed 
 And sought salvation in Derek X 
 So thank you thank you and alladat 
 Played the hell out of the Nubians -- the shit was fat 
 So now we're in Lafayette, Louisiana 
 Bought a three eighty from some little Dan Tana 
 Ripped the show got the dough and gained some fans 
 The grill dusty message to the B.A.N. 
 On the whole tour Rob was a fiend 
 He had the ugliest girl I've ever seen 
 He was with her the whole time after the show 
 He turned the light on -- me and Jojo said YOOOOOO! 
 What is that? 
 Rob you're bugging G damn her grill is wack 
 Your grill ain't alladat but you can do better 
 My man even had phone calls and sent her letters 
 In at the Denny's on the corner no one seen us 
 On Pokey's burger -- everything on it -- even penis 
 But Kirk Pone went and told the man 
 1991 Grilled Cheese Tour -- a message to the B.A.N.
