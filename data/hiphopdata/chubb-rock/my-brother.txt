What you're trying to tell me G 
 If I walk down to the corner and shop I'm a goner 
 A Bodega is a no-no so where should I get my grub 
 Without you idiots trying to rub -- me out 
 'Cause I'm the victim on your main route 
 You take me out and you might get some clout 
 Anger is driving around in a red Wrangler 
 Looking for all you black stranglers 
 To squeeze your reasoning try to find the answer 
 You try to rob you'll get a Jolly Rancher 
 For ya dragon, brotherly strength and gaggin 
 Put away the gun son, run 
 For cover, seek sanctuary with your mother 
 Ah my brother 
 My brother four times 
 Take the time to check the clock and don't smother 
 Other being when both are already fleeing 
 From the same oppression, the lesson 
 Here has been ignored for many years and years 
 Fears has created many hostile years 
 Hoover sustained the first hate maneuver 
 Jiggaboo and now I have to also be afraid of you 
 Think like Brown or Franklin and be thanking 
 The one you pray to, they're after you too 
 Don't try to switch, they're not after no other 
 But us my brother 
 Mississippit Burning gets my stomach churning and yearning 
 I d on't care how much we're earning 
 Each year we dissipate in the air yeah 
 Change our line of thought put away the damn quart 
 Of brew the intoxicated crew knew 
 We couldn't come hither if we're destroying our liver 
 So what should we do earn our little pittance 
 And act real ignorant just like the Buttmins 
 Put away our t hings and sing a different sound 
 Come home and you might get beat down 
 Down down down you won't touch no other 
 Why not no other, my brother
