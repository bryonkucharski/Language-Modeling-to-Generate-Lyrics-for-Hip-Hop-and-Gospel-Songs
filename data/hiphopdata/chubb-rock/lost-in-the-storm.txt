I walk down the street, yo pick any one 
 I see a little ruffneck kid with a gun 
 I said, "Little homeboy what's up with the glock 19?" 
 He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life 
 And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe 
 I said, "Guilt will let him know what he did 
 And you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid. 
 Give me the gun little G, just cool it down. 
 You've got a lot to live for you're college bound." 
 And so he screams and cries, we start huggin 
 On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin 
 Tears drip as we walk to the crib 
 And I'ma try to be there to comfort the kid 
 I woke up it's a brand new day 
 Little man blew himself away 
 And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn 
 And I'm lost in the storm 
 Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand 
 The conspiracy upon the first man 
 Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected 
 To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand 
 And the plan to conserve this confused violent land 
 Different races, faces share the same spaces 
 Sewed by arrogant laces 
 Taste t his peace is real sweet 
 Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak 
 Will be done before the sun starts to nova 
 Or we'll be over 
 Reveal the passion button now hit it 
 Cause no one is born a bigot 
 Delete what you have engraved in your mind 
 And throw up the peace sign 
 And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm 
 Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three 
 With no P-E, A-C-E 
 It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin 
 Find the music of peace and start rappin' 
 The answer lies in your hearts then your minds 
 And maybe then we can save human kind 
 Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one 
 But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew 
 Without death cause that will be illogical 
 Peace will cover every newspaper article 
 So now then, where do we start 
 Everybody knows they have to play a part 
 Open your minds and clear your minds 
 And throw up the peace signs 
 Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn 
 Or be lost in the storm
