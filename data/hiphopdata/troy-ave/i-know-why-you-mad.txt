Riding through the streets looking so clean (so clean) 
 Fishbowl tints so I'm so seen (so seen) 
 Most do a nod like dope fiends (what up) 
 Few faces look at me, why you hating on me for (why you hatin') 
 You never said shit before (you was waitin') 
 Now that I'm doing my thing you're (aha) 
 Feeling jealousy and furthermore (powder) 
 I know why you mad 
 Yo daddy ain't shit, you ain't gon be shit 
 You hustlin' nicks, I know why you mad 
 You seeing my whips, you seeing my bitch 
 Get off my dick, fuck boy 
 Brand new V, brand new key (key) 
 Plural that, backpack, brand new three (ki's) 
 Fuck OT I get mines where I be (uh huh) 
 Tri-state nigga, you know, NYC (New York) 
 Shouts to my white boy dope boy C (what up) 
 Started with 14 now he do a quarter B (powder) 
 Niggas in the hood still coppin' a quarter P (ugh) 
 My sneakers with tags cost more than they'll ever see 
 And I don't hardly walk (nah), I don't hardly talk 
 Bring the pain, lift the grip and aim, popping like a cork 
 All in your face on some Chris Paul shit 
 I ain't the one you should get live with (get it) 
 'Cause I don't back down unless I just bust a nut 
 And she tickling my dick, get off me you fucking slut 
 On my grind like a butt in Jamaican clubs (dancehall king) 
 Selling cracks, doing raps, you just hate my buzz (doing my thing) 
 Riding through the streets looking so clean (so clean) 
 Fishbowl tints so I'm so seen (so seen)

 Yo daddy ain't shit, you ain't gon be shit 
 You hustlin' nicks, I know why you mad 
 You seeing my whips, you seeing my bitch 
 Get off my dick, fuck boy 
 A nigga eating good so I got a little tummy 
 Lapping in the pool, macking with a little honey 
 B$B them my niggas for real 
 All the raps is real, I'm major without a deal 
 Now I gotta chill but I gotta get this money (uh huh) 
 Get the chills when I imagine being broke, not funny (brr) 
 No Joakim Noahy, that's no bullshit (swish) 
 Every time I leave out the crib, I got a full clip 
 Niggas be slipping acting like it can't happen 
 Wearing all they jewels but they only in Manhattan (powder) 
 I be out in Brooklyn, heavy on the neck (bling) 
 Rolly on the wristband wiper hold the sweat 
 Young baller baby, what did you really expect? 
 Getting straight cash, no scams, no checks (nah) 
 Powder be the name (name), I made my own lane (lane) 
 In the rap game and I'm still dealing caine, fuck boy 
 Riding through the streets looking so clean (so clean) 
 Fishbowl tints so I'm so seen (so seen) 
 Most do a nod like dope fiends (what up)
