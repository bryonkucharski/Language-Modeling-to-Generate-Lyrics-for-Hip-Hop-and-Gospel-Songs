Just let the pain out 
 Baby! When I'm in it she screams my name out 
 Tr-oy Av-e (One two One two) 
 B$B shit, Brooklyn, Real Life 
 I got this burning desire to be better than most 
 That's probably the main reason I'm on the come up like spokes 
 See me in magazines, Modeling for liquor and smoke 
 But I keep a magazine, Confused that pretty shit and get smoked 
 I'm not the one to provoke 
 I don't make sense I just reach 
 Was given the world by my moms, Still I took to the streets 
 Where heart beats get shorten, The main focus is ballin 
 Had many gambles with life, And every time I was all in 
 My style, Was never determined by mics in the Source 
 Been fly since dollar fries with ketchup and hot sauce 
 I used to cut my wings up 
 Then I fucked my dreams up 
 No NFL,.. Still cuttingwings up 
 Bird ass niggas there's no relation 
 I cannot consider you real if you ever was hating 
 Unless your team playing 
 You might call Bron a bum but you ain't really mean it 
 You just mad 'cause he dropped 40 on Brooklyn I seen it 
 And felt the same way 
 Once I got up out my feelings still had to sling ye 
 Them seats ain't cheap 
 Win or lose still struggle, Mickey Mantle don't love you 
 So I fistaled out the Bronx 
 Fishscale for my hustle, Mufuckas 
 Just let the pain out 
 When I'm in it she screams my name out 
 Tr-oy Av-e 
 B$B shit, Brooklyn 
 Ayo! This my New York life 
 Getting money underneath the city lights 
 I put food on that table, Every motherfuckin night 
 They say you living fast you eventually die slow 
 It don't matter when you get it in bulk like Cosco 
 Ain't taking no losses I creep on the block slow 
 Any type of sudden movement I'm letting them shots go 
 At these fake real niggas I don't play them fair 
 'Cause they been there since before I had facial hair 
 I ride through, And all I get is facial stares 
 Let a nigga try it he gone have to get his face repaired 
 Yeah, that's how a nigga on it 
 Ask me, "What it's looking like?" 
 I'm a tell you I can't call it 
 Though I ain't living right so I say my prayers every morning 
 Thanking God for this fly shit and nigga be important 
 In it for the moment, Suckafree and staying humble 
 When you out here in this concrete jungle 
 Word up 
 Just let the pain out 
 When I'm in it she screams my name out 
 Tr-oy Av-e 
 B$B shit, Brooklyn 
 BSB Records, The future is here 
 I'm the only nigga not spitting chuck shit in your ear 
 You can verify all my raps, double check and be clear 
 "Did you really tote all them gats and deal crack?" Hell yeah 
 Don't forget about my woman 
 They all fine and on deck 
 I only drink Cristal or Imperial Moet 
 No more weak ass Rose, That's why the game too sweet 
 We don't wear tight ass clothes 
 We don't do down south beats 
 That ain't New York, I restore our identification 
 'Cause dickriding never been a form of transportation 
 That ain't New York, I restore our identification
