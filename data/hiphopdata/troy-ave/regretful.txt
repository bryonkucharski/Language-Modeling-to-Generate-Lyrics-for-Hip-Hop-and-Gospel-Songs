I know you wanna be with ya boy 
 But you can't, and it's stressful 
 I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did 
 I'm regretful 
 And it would be a lie if I said 
 What he had wasn't special 
 Although I had to let you go, you should know 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you 
 You should know, I'll never forget you 
 Now how the fuck could I forget Destiny? 
 Shorty bought out the best and the fresh in me 
 She was just a lil older with a baby girl 
 But I'm a young nigga, still tryna see the world 
 I knew it wouldn't work, but I dragged her along 
 Reminisce about her while I take a drag of the strong 
 Goddamn, that bitch was fine 
 Good food, good moves, with the "Bump N Grind" 
 But the fights was bad, my other hoes was mad 
 Took the numbers out my phone and she called they ass 
 Makin' threats with a follow through, "bitch I'm a follow you" 
 She always want me stay up the house, but I gotta do 
 Things in the street like get this money 
 When you be's in the streets you'll get them honies 
 Hid away in the comb, short stay, get 'em gone 
 I was getting back to her, couldn't wait now she gone 
 Word 
 I know you wanna be with ya boy 
 But you can't, and it's stressful 
 I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did 
 I'm regretful 
 And it would be a lie if I said 
 What he had wasn't special 
 Although I had to let you go, you should know 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you 
 You should know, I'll never forget you 
 Chesapeake, you trifling' bitch 
 I'll never forget the day you sucked another nigga dick 
 Back in high school, 2003 
 You the main reason these hoes gotta deal with me 
 Present day MayBae, you was 'posed to be my wife 
 You 'posed to have my baby, we 'posed to have a life 
 Things don't always go how they supposed 
 We 'posed to be in jail for all them trips on the road 
 Reminiscin' 'bout my silver Benz 
 You and Zanti in the back breaking' 40, 000 into stacks of 10's 
 I ain't gon front, it's plenty times I miss you 
 I won't put you on front, but you had your issues 
 Some due to me, shit I was doin' me 
 I do the same to Nae, I did the same to Ri 
 I'm a work in progress, I'm improving me 
 But "When A Woman's Fed Up, " get the eulogy 
 I know you wanna be with ya boy 
 But you can't, and it's stressful 
 I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did 
 I'm regretful 
 And it would be a lie if I said 
 What he had wasn't special 
 Although I had to let you go, you should know 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 RIP to Pop Pop, I miss my nigga 
 I get the chills, when I spit there's no tissue nigga 
 I ain't cry since your funeral, no tears left 
 And it's been over 12 years ago since you left 
 You had the gold Rolex, I got on mine today 
 I remember you used to play Billie Holiday 
 And like her "I'll Be Seeing You" uh, later on some day 
 Playin' pool you once cracked a fool head with the 8 ball 
 I'm just like you, hit crackheads with the eight-ball 
 New cars? yeah I'm into that 
 Remember how you would do broads? yeah I'm livin' that 
 Say your quote everyday: "no man is smarter than the next 
 It's the one who works hardest that achieves success" 
 Carry myself with respect, put mufuckas in check 
 You live through me, get your rest, my Grandfather, God Bless 
 Word 
 I know you wanna be with ya boy 
 But you can't, and it's stressful 
 I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did 
 I'm regretful 
 And it would be a lie if I said 
 What he had wasn't special 
 Although I had to let you go, you should know 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you, ooh 
 I'll never forget you 
 You should know, I'll never forget you 
 I'll never forget you 
 If I got it, then you got it, it's no issue 
 It was a lotta bullshit I went, been through 
 But every girl I done named was official 
 In the words of the Reverend P. Diddy, while I sip this liquor, liquor 
 "Some of these bitches, they roll harder than your niggas" 
 And everybody know it's a fact 
 Troy Ave. beatin' up this track 
 Yeah nigga, yeah you know how I'm strapped 
 Eryday I'm down for that clack 
 Powder! 
 I'm a lesson teacher, I don't learn shit 
 I'm hardheaded, doin' the same to my bitch right nowwww 
 But if you hold a nigga down 
 Then I promise you'll go to the top with me 
 Stay at the top with me, where you supposed to be 
 Just be patient B, knahmean? 
 Don't beef with me, then leave me for the next man 
 When he gon do the same damn thing, and not be as dope as I am 
 How do that make sense? 
 I been fuckin' mad bitches and they leave they man 
 And I'm like "damn 
 You was beefing with that nigga for cheatin' 
 But you fucking with me, I'm just a... slam... dunk, lay up" 
 Hit 'em in the back of the trunk, in the parking lot 
 Yeah, I did that, that's a fact tho 
 Troy Ave oh 
 I get stacks to blow, but I don't spend 'em on no bitches 
 Trickin' ain't shit, I don't care how much riches you got 
 B$B niggas straight to the top 
 Even smoke a lil bit of pot 
 But I specialize in having drug spots 
 Allegedly 
 Enjoy the album
