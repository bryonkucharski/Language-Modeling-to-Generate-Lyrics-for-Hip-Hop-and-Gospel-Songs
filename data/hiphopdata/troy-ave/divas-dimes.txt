Uh huh! 
 Yeah! 
 It's too many divas 
 And not enough dimes 
 If it ain't about money 
 Then I ain't got time 
 Even though I got a Rollie 
 And chopard with the fish 
 Fuck these ho's 
 I'm Going hard with the Bricks 
 Man it's one in the head 
 And sixteen in the clip 
 You fuck with my bread 
 You getting seen nigga RIP 
 Hand to the sky, niggas know how I give it up 
 Coke I supply for the benz and big truck 
 Tryna get a crib in a name of my bitch 
 Had thirty percent cash but her credit wasn't shit 
 She ain't helpin' and she hurtin' had to leave her alone 
 Fuck SUNY mae I don't need that loan 
 Left moms duke crib and found my own spot 
 Switched cars switched bone's shit was so hot 
 I remember holy dog he was followed by the fed's 
 In an unmarked car about to pick up his kids 
 I'm like damn homie who the fucks a snitch? 
 We sell weight to weightman 
 Ain't non of them getting hit 
 Paranoid thoughts running through my head about grimes 
 Tryna figure what they know certain shit I'm dying 
 With a needle in my arm if a blow drought 
 Life ain't fair and I've been living so foul 
 Ain't no raps and plus I had to know how 
 To get this coke and move it like a snow Plow (Plaowww) 
 It's too many divas 
 And not enough dimes 
 If it ain't about money 
 Then I ain't got time 
 Even though I got a Rollie 
 And chopard with the fish 
 Fuck these ho's 
 I'm Going hard with the Bricks 
 And time in peace I'm prepared for war 
 Looking at my time piece I'm prepared for more 
 Got a mavado a cartier and a rolex 
 Might buy a audemar maybe the hublot next 
 Everyday in the streets they telling me you goin' blow next 
 Selling yay' in the street's to felons you nigga's bow-flex 
 I gave a whole another meaning to putting work out 
 Distribute the work evenly till my work's out 
 Some nigga's ain't built really don't ever work out 
 Strong arm robberies turn them nigga's to church route 
 Now the lord with 'em God forbid the law get'em 
 He going testify on the stand and bring us all with him 
 Damn, victimizer's become the victim's 
 Nigga either way it ain't right 
 It's like counting it with the baggie you ain't weighting it right 
 Ain't no trying to make a point once I say it ain't right 
 I'm dealing pound in perico green and white bills for it 
 Bought more birds then popeyes and that cooking bitch 
 Literally through my whip window here you go buy new rolls time to roll minor pole get this dough 
 When your bread up bitches get ahead up 
 And I've been getting so much head it's like a setup 
 When nigga's get they drop you get shot from the neck up 
 Fucking around with dots all your knots going be separate 
 Mothafucka! 
 It's too many divas 
 And not enough dimes 
 If it ain't about money 
 Then I ain't got time 
 Even though I got a Rollie 
 And chopard with the fish 
 Fuck these ho's 
 I'm Going hard with the Bricks
