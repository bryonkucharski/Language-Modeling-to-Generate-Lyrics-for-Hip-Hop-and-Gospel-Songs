Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through it 
 And even though it's crimes involved, we had to do 'em 
 By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot 
 I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop 
 The road to success for me was real gritty 
 Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity 
 Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty 
 And I'm a do me anyway, nigga 
 'Cause I'm from New York City 
 I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills 
 A young prodigy when it come to drug deals 
 In New York I get blood money 
 Dirty cash bought my matte black Jeep 
 I used to skip out on cabs 
 Went from givin' no dough to given limos to get to shows 
 Either way I'm driven - this shit shows 
 Spit flows like Bō, sick hoes, got a Master Rolex watch above my Mo' 
 Drinkin' champagne out the bottle 
 Young Crisco, pop it, hop in, let's politic, ditto 
 Same niggas sayin' "time to get this money" 
 They've been the same niggas sayin' that for years, still hungry 
 New discussion: New York artists wanna be southern 
 The city's lost, so out-of-towners find themselves frontin' 
 It was Big, Jay Z, now Troy here after 
 But Kendrick Lamar's just a weirdo rapper 
 Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through it 
 And even though it's crimes involved, we had to do 'em 
 By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot 
 I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop 
 The road to success for me was real gritty 
 Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity 
 Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty 
 And I'm a do me anyway, nigga 
 'Cause I'm from New York City 
 We went from Uzis to elephant guns 
 Small pistols on Gynsills - little shorties, cheeba, big forties 
 Sittin' back in the 'hood - good, nigga, good 
 Retrievin' every dollar bill, grabbin' my wood 
 You know we specialists at nighttime 
 Call us the poisonous pumpers 
 Who run up on these niggas like Nightline 
 The arsonists and good vines 
 That means the wares is amazing - assignment, baby, since '89 
 Creepin' through hallways, big laundry bags 
 Four Ks - handle them niggas, now jam niggas 
 Fuck they gon' do with no CREAM? You might as well be a bum 
 'Cause you could never represent the money team 
 We smash faces, flash bracelets, that's the basic 
 Don't get smacked in your mouth with 45 razors 
 Yeah, the jungle brothers rollin' with all coverage 
 Get 'em young Troy - What? He fucked with us 
 Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through it 
 And even though it's crimes involved, we had to do 'em 
 By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot 
 I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop 
 The road to success for me was real gritty 
 Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity 
 Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty 
 And I'm a do me anyway, nigga 
 'Cause I'm from New York City 
 You know how I steady rock - New York City bop 
 Used to slang grainy rock - war on the petty block 
 Back-to-back cases 
 Now we drink liquor, drinkin' back-to-back cases 
 No, we ain't erase this 
 Spades hand, aces - out of town papers 
 Luck's all Vegas - herb shit, Avis 
 I graduated from the street life accordingly 
 Said my first rhyme on a jail phone, recordedly 
 I been shot niggas since 14 
 I've been to war, mean - got guns from Fort Greene 
 I exorted niggas - I was the re-up man 
 I gave the orders, nigga - P.A.P.I. gave the orders, nigga 
 King flow, used to get coke from Domingo 
 Get up in the old folks' home, he's playin' bingo 
 He sold it for 10, but I got him for cinco 
 Safe in the ceiling, the guns under the sink flow 
 Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through it 
 And even though it's crimes involved, we had to do 'em 
 By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot 
 I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop 
 The road to success for me was real gritty 
 Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity 
 Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty 
 And I'm a do me anyway, nigga 
 'Cause I'm from New York City 
 The life and times of a New York Nigga, we very different 
 Please pardon my aggression, but move from my vision 
 With that bullshit you spittin', you talkin' my high off 
 You blowin' my vibe, you forcin' my iron off my belt 
 I'm forcin' myself to be chill 
 Listen to them journalists, get yourself killed 
 They ain't never lived this life, and no near nothin' 'bout it 
 They hide behind aliases and talk rowdy 
 From behind a MacBook, fuck a blog, dawg 
 If I see you in the flesh you'll be shook 
 Like a martini - I know they tired of me 
 I know they wish I would die already, but I'm very dope 
 I'm so cold, you should get your February coat 
 That NY shit, you niggas got warm hearts 
 No offense, but I'll tear you apart 
 No matter which part of the map you reppin', get your weapon 
 Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through it 
 And even though it's crimes involved, we had to do 'em 
 By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot 
 I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop 
 The road to success for me was real gritty 
 Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity 
 Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty 
 And I'm a do me anyway, nigga 
 'Cause I'm from New York City
