 But I'm choosing ain't cocky, see me on the couch 
 See me pouring out, see me on your TV when you're sitting in your house 
 I'm on BET, MTV man I'm the hottest thing smokin' outta NYC 
 Self made and self paid, niggas can't stop me 
 I hand out, your hands out like save me a peach 
 Man fuck you spit Crystal in your face, you can hate me now and tell how success tastes 
 Not bad don't it, mad want it, nigga please I bought the bar you at the bar

 Spend some G's on some Givenchy and bon weed 
 My bitch in Brazilian hair that bon weave 
 Her pussy be the bomb it's kamikaze 
 Touch the sky and do why I'm on floor 93 
 Condos in Paris above Versages, and we party in the club VIP 
 We do it BIG, a hundred bottles on an Arabian seat 
 Prince'd buy a ring with some hashish, then it's back to the NY streets 
 South side hood party with some projects freaks 
 You some Baisley bitches, or some 40 bitches, or some Rochdale bitches 
 Or some Sutphin bitches, call straight club king just promoting the night 
 La morena grippin', two white girls kissin' 
 The city never sleep, you bitch I hope you don't miss it, 
 Don't blame it on me homie we out here pimpin'
