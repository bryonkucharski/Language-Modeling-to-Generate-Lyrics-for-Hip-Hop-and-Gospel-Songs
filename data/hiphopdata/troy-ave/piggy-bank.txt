I'm on a highway doing it my way 
 How you got it, nigga 
 Troy Ave in this motherfucker 
 How you float in this motherfucker 
 Niggas balling, niggas get to fucking 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 That little piggy went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 Y'all little piggies went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 I came a long way from the 
 Breakdown in that crack house 
 In broad day'out in the burbs 
 A nigga get killed every day' 
 I'm New York mellow with 
 A'I just bought a Benz, either way I flows 
 Showing my teeth, tell 'em fuck sleep' 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 That little piggy went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 Y'all little piggies went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 I just opened up my eyes and wrote what I saw 
 Autobiographical, you know that it's raw 
 Cook game proper'I'mma be seen by a doctor 
 Go to DR, light me a cigar 
 Blowing smoke while I'm getting blown by Anita 
 Your boy hot and fly like grits on a cheetah 
 Spotted young player head to toe in Adidas 
 All day I deal drugs and shit 
 Kick flows, rip shows, might even club a bit 
 Sip more, flick'fuck it, the money fit 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 That little piggy went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 Y'all little piggies went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 That little piggy went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay 
 This little piggy went to the market 
 Y'all little piggies went to play 
 This little piggy went to Target 
 Now'yay
