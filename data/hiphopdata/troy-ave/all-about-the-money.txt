DJ's gonna kill this part 
 Roofeeo on the beat 
 Troy Ave make the Cypher complete 
 Manolo! 
 You never seen nothing like this, splash brothers with the aim 
 I wish a nigga would boy 
 A nigga sleeping with your misses 
 Nigga call me Young 'Melo cause scoring is my shit boy 
 I'm CP3 'cause I'll be dishin' and handlin' the rock 
 Chef cooking with the pot boy 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 I be in the hood, drop Wrangler 
 Toilet paper in my Porsche 'cause I'm shittin' 
 94th and Willmohr in the kitchen 
 Cooking birds niggas saying thanks for giving 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger arm from the whippin' 
 Won't reply to you niggas sneak dissin' 
 Suck a dick when you see me know I'm grippin' 
 You never seen nothing like this, splash brothers with the aim 
 I wish a nigga would boy 
 A nigga sleeping with your misses 
 Nigga call me Young 'Melo cause scoring is my shit boy 
 I'm CP3 'cause I'll be dishin' and handlin' the rock 
 Chef cooking with the pot boy 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 No limit to my money I should get a tank 
 They walk me through the back entering the bank 
 Base running Aaron so I'm giving hank 
 That's a hit had him hit leave the nigga planking 
 He got six feet, I got six figures 
 Nothing less but six shot coming off the hip 
 Life's a trip, life a gamble, I'm a big chipper 
 1000 dollar hand wrist glitter bitch nigga 
 You never seen nothing like this, splash brothers with the aim 
 I wish a nigga would boy 
 A nigga sleeping with your misses 
 Nigga call me Young 'Melo cause scoring is my shit boy 
 I'm CP3 'cause I'll be dishin' and handlin' the rock 
 Chef cooking with the pot boy 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 More money, more problem B.I.G. said it best 
 If you got a problem with me better wear a vest 
 A fully fucking hot slug flying out the Tec 
 I put a couple hot slugs all in your chest 
 I be strapped like them white boys that climb rocks 
 One call I have a nigga in a pine box 
 Young Lito man I'm known for selling dime rocks 
 My bitch a dime but I still let a nine pop 
 You never seen nothing like this, splash brothers with the aim 
 I wish a nigga would boy 
 A nigga sleeping with your misses 
 Nigga call me Young 'Melo cause scoring is my shit boy 
 I'm CP3 'cause I'll be dishin' and handlin' the rock 
 Chef cooking with the pot boy 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money 
 It's all about the motherfucking money
