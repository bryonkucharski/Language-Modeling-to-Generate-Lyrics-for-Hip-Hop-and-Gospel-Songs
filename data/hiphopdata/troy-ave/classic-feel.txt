Classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel 
 This that Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm 
 This that safety off with that engine on 
 Mercedes Benz, good watch, scene above them all 
 How he got money when he ain't have a job in so long? 
 This that hustler shit, that independent grind 
 That nautical sweat suit and white ones gold shine 
 Barbershop twice a week, stay sharp and in shape 
 In the chair, with the trigger hair, under the cape 
 This that first hand shit, Maybach, tinted windows 
 Not gonna rap about it but really seen it from my window 
 This that fine line between jail and my crooks 
 My bedroom at my mama house smelling like coke 
 This that gambling spot, stop bank, shoot it back 
 Metro North, with three birds in the backpack 
 Plenty trains on bitches, no names or pictures 
 Kept it low so she brought more things to fuck with us 
 This that half off credit, shit we don't respect 
 We just dead them if they try to do 60% 
 This that other 40% that minority flow 
 When all the achers sell hearts and only you sell blow 
 No pain, no gain, I profit of cane 
 Give a fuck who we slaying as long as my team remain 
 This that violating, y'all meet your death 
 This that vile cover, nigga, east versus west 
 Classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel 
 Classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel, nigga 
 It's that motherfucking classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel (Representer of the O's & the pistols!) 
 Classic feel 
 And if you get it like me you can tell it's for real 
 Now if he say I ain't hot I probably fucked his girl 
 Or did violence to his homies, took 'em up out this world 
 Bruce Lee sure, only nigga with that glow 
 BSB Records, nigga I'm the CEO 
 Most of these other rap niggas? They done seen before 
 MC for all, how the fuck you get my number and other line, 
 This momma loves me, she proud of her kid 
 She Used to call me like, 'The cops here, don't come to the crib! 
 A bad boy, a more gangsta version of Shyne 
 My city all stake and I ain't even get in my prime 
 Still getting that cake, a Pillsbury snow 
 On the real, fuck your opinion, I made it this far and you broke 
 When I was looking for guidance spread the Bible apart 
 But Exodus 20: 13 didn't do shit for my heart 
 So I move in silence, all you hear is the spark 
 See a flash 'fore you pass, what a light in the dark 
 What a sight in the chop, yeah, that's DOA 
 I know I look like I'm balling but nigga me no play 
 I'm 'bout my Frito-Lay, bags of chips 
 So if you feelin' this shit, baby, rub on your tits (ah-ha!) 
 Classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel 
 Classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel, nigga 
 It's that motherfucking classic feel 
 Rubber grip or the plastic feel (Representer of the O's & the pistols!) 
 Classic feel 
 And if you get it like me you can tell it's for real
