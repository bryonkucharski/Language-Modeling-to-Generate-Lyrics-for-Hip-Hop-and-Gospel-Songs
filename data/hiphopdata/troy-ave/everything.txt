Uh 
 Dope boy swag to the max on 
 Dealing yay for the pay with the strap on 
 Money ain't a thing but a quick meet 
 Nigga murder ain't a thing but a hip reach 
 BK nigga and I've been what's up 
 Word to my mother I don't give a fuck 
 Like a fronting ho 
 I ain't fronting though 
 I ain't gotta make a call I just dump and go 
 Fast lane living shit I'm in the streets 
 And you can feel that when I get a beat 
 D-town raps you can see my sheet 
 I've been toting gats since I had the peach 
 Fuzz lit, thug shit 
 New York City crack house drug shit 
 That's what the fuck I'm representing 
 30 cash for the cross what the fuck am I repenting nigga? 
 Yea, I'm selling birds come and get a wing 
 BSB in the hood we the Medellín 
 I'm all good wearing heavy bling 
 Niggas front we putting holes up in everything, everything, everything 
 My niggas putting holes up in everything, everything, everything 
 My niggas putting holes up in everything 
 Niggas who ain't selling no records look defeated 
 No shades on in the club, clothes repeated 
 Since '02 I told you I ain't need it 
 Billie Jean step on the square tell you to Beat It 
 Bricks in my backpack, scale and the black mac 
 Niggas don't talk on the phone, they can tap that 
 Unwrap raw, ice a tall mix 
 Once it shrink, wrap, mummify bricks 
 100 thousand dollar car minimums 
 And they're candy color coated like an m&m 
 Came with the bleach blonde bitch who love's eminem 
 And a tan on her skin like a Timberland 
 Everything nigga I got everything 
 Money cash hoes that's my everything 
 Niggas talking like they heavy slang 
 We get it straight from the Medellín 
 Yea, I'm selling birds come and get a wing 
 BSB in the hood we the Medellín 
 I'm all good wearing heavy bling 
 Niggas front we putting holes up in everything, everything, everything 
 My niggas putting holes up in everything, everything, everything 
 My niggas putting holes up in everything
