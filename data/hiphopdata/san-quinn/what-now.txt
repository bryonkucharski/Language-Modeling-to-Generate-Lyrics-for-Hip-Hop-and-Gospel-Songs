(Feat. Messy Marv) 
 (Chorus x2: Messy Marv) 
 All my niggas in the ghet-ta 
 Acceptin no losses, no cheats an no let downs 
 Foul cats mess around get the wet down 
 In yo city 
 Leave yo whole turf shut down 
 (Sucka What Now?) 
 (Verse 1: San Quinn) 
 It's lethal 
 The streets'll take ya where ya don't need to go 
 Ammunition 
 Bullet proof 
 Ghetto blastas slammin' roofs 
 Straight loot an pursuit 
 To survive be bout politics 
 We not ruthless for suckas it's bound to make me contradict 
 Conflict of interest 
 Because my Mobb is relentless 
 Suckas don't wanna see us in this or win this 
 Splended 
 Less suckas to worry bout 
 Broke niggas make the best crooks 
 Crossas an killas 
 More scrilla I accumulate 
 Enough to feed my reals 
 Not concerned about the murder rate so when I'm a get drilled 
 I be prayed up 
 Over raw 
 Wakin' up's enough for me 
 But when I rhyme my minds on the grind 
 Strictly hustlin 
 I'm back to bust 
 It should be lavishly surroundin 
 Naturally reboundin from the loss 'cause you thought I was grounded 
 This how we do it 
 The truth gets screwed gets ??? 
 Me retire, the file wit ridas that remain at. 
 (Verse 2: Messy Marv) 
 Bow down to the west world 
 In the bucket flossin wit yo best girl 
 Wanna turn up in the pearl 
 Now you muggin when you rollin' by 
 Wanna get wet by the Tech 'cause you lookin' dry 
 Seen the hate up in yo eye 
 Be on the flight the next mornin 
 Suckas flex in Kanas, Seattle an Oregon 
 I got game 
 Doin' thangs in 25 states 
 No condition we straight 
 Ammunition we hate 
 Kept it up in the case 
 Gangsta 
 In body armor 
 We rappers say "This is fake" when people's quick to bomb on ya 
 An bet a dime on ya 
 Befo' ya make a false move 
 Then get lost in yo crew 
 Now they all boo-hoo 
 Ya stay in doo-doo 
 Fucked around an got flushed 
 Out of line 
 Out of time 
 Thinkin' you can't be touched 
 We quick to rush 
 'Cause suckas sit in concrete and calmly 
 Blow bomb-diggy on my way back to the big city. 
 (Verse 3: San Quinn) 
 Respect 
 We check the neck 
 You next 
 Seff an Mess 
 Elliot finess 
 At yo front steps, God bless 
 Lyrics you fearin no non-sense we far fetched 
 Leave you outlined stretched 
 Wit yo mind wrecked 
 I Rolex, you Timex 
 Watchin time tick 
 If it rhyme hit yo target sucka 
 Accurate 
 My limits 
 Have no maximum 
 Mashin 'em 
 Runnin' down the platinum 
 Half of 'em rappin' 
 I be surpassin 'em 
 My squad do the job 
 Let them do rappin' 
 They rob 
 We gon' survive 
 While you dispise 
 Frisco playas live 
 Eyes wide scopin 
 Hopin we ain't touchin 
 Then we high rollin' 
 High side wit our mouths open 
 Gold showin 
 I'm representin the playas an pimps 
 Playin' simps 
 Pursuin mill tickets, bangin' my hits 
 Still we kill 'em this is like 11-Feev (11/5) 
 Keep it real like the 6-9 Vill you suckas best believe.
