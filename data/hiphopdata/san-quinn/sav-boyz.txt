 (C-Bo) 
 I'ma cock and unload the AK 
 Have 'em on they radio screamin out MAYDAY MAYDAY 
 Callin back up, I let 'em stack up 
 It's just more cops for me to cap up 
 Punk cops I kill 'em on the spot 
 Fuck a foot pursuit I fill 'em wit the glock 
 And ever since pete wilson came up with the 3 strikes 
 I'd rather it be death than let it be life 
 I done seen wit juvenille delinquits 
 Pull heat quick, dump and leap fence 
 And I can't wait for the homies to see this 
 Me on the offense killin' they defense 
 A hnudred miles and runnin' 
 Fuck that a hundred rounds and gunnin they ass down and comin' 
 With that titanium bullet proof vest that'll show ya 
 That them motherfuckers lied when they told ya 
 I'm a gun slangin d-boy block hundred proof 
 Fuck the police we throw shots out the roof 
 Heat holder, ya block soldiers cops don't want it 
 Shoot a cop blow a cop smoke on the doja we bad boys 
 We roll around the town in dem toys 
 Them after that we snort a gram of that boi 
 The savage causin the havoc 
 And bust a nut in nothing less than the baddest 
 We holdin' courts in the middle of the traffic a savage nigga 
 (San Quinn) 
 I give the boys in blue the real bb king blues 
 Rookie cop get popped out his shoes make the news 
 Due to the hustlin they wanna pursue and cuff quinn 
 Shoot a nigga quick, so of course I'm dustin them 
 Since my homies a parloies they told me paperwork ain't the lick 
 I'm movin work in somethin' quick wit a glock and a kick 
 On ya shift tryna sniff in my shit 
 You get behind me, ya little lt-1 I'm runnin' that shit 
 Call back up y'all stick like Savs together 
 So get blasted and have matchin' shit, bags together 
 Or get chedder you can keep ya punk ass number 
 Fuck the cops I stay wit heat and I'm ridint he runner 
 If you comin' bring a helicopter to chase me down to the compound 
 50 niggaz strapped face me now 
 You brave bastards similar to slave masters 
 Try to interfere here you'll meet disaster 
 (Killa Tay) 
 We shake the spots 'cause we hate the cops 
 Cali life everyday tryna make some knots 
 My lil homies keep the blocks hot 
 Dub C M still hooked wit crooks that jook 
 And ese's wit chop shops 
 And ride drop tops and when it's time to blow the dough 
 I'm in the escalade wit bo ready to hot box 
 Super sav boy, keep a breezy to spot cops in case we got chops and glocks 
 You know how we roll cause p.d. is dirty as me 
 Tryna see a real g shacked down but I'm tryna stay free 
 Fuck the police n.w.a said it and I said it 
 They lie and try to plot that's why they keep us hot headed 
 But we stay savage on hog status like bettis 
 Bout to stack a mil plus if they let us 
 We black geurillas that hate laws and break jaws 
 So if thet try to pull you over mayne shoot 'em in the face do
