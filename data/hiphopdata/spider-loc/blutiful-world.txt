It's a blutiful day in my neighborhood x2 
 I'm on the blue mic standin in the blue booth 
 Got that blue light blinkin on the blue tooth 
 Blue water, great big blue sky 
 Blue royal, all kind of blue fly 
 Blue boxers saggin in my blue jeans 
 Blue chucks on, fat laced blue strings 
 Got a jacket that's made out of blue fox 
 Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks 
 Snoopy blue in the cut with the blue steel 
 We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills 
 Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill 
 Blue benz on four big blue wheels 
 Hood rats, blue braids, blue heels 
 Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale 
 Spray paint got the hood full of blue walls 
 Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls 
 Oh, It's a blutiful day 
 It's a blutiful world 
 I'm in a blutiful car 
 And got a blutiful girl 
 It's a blutiful night 
 My chain blings blue in the light 
 I'm blutiful when I grind 
 I'm blutiful when I shine 
 How many times I gotta holla how this white shit mine 
 And all this is bad boy, you did not get shyne 
 The chains glow just watch the shine 
 See what time is it, gotta watch this grind 
 I can do this on an off night 
 Sell crack to powder fiends and have 'em crush a pack of soft white 
 Tell 'em bring it if its cost right 
 Call 'em ballerina on this clothes like a frostbite 
 Have the fiends burn his fingers on the exhaust pipe 
 No sleep, street dreamer can't exhaust pipe 
 I'm everywhere, you ain't never there 
 You like chess, wanna make a move but you debatin where 
 I keep a fifty between my legs like I'm braidin hair 
 I leave cream around her mouth like a bakers square 
 Check the closet, it ain't a pair of apes in there 
 MJ's in there, Blue Jays in there
