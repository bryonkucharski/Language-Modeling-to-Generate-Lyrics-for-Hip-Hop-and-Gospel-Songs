(Feat. Snoopy Blue) 
 It's a blutiful day in my neighborhood 
 A blutiful day in my neighborhood 
 REMIX! ha ha muthafuckas 
 (Verse 1: Spider Loc) 
 I'm on the blue mic standin in the blue booth 
 Got that blue light blinkin on the blue tooth 
 Blue water, great big blue sky 
 Blue royal, all kind of blue fly 
 Blue boxers saggin in my blue jeans 
 Blue chucks on, fat lace blue strings 
 Got a jacket that's made out of blue fox 
 Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks 
 Snoopy blue in the cut with the blue steel 
 We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills 
 Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill 
 Blue benz on four big blue wheels 
 Hood rats, blue braids, blue nails 
 Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale 
 Spray paint got the hood full of blue walls 
 Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls 
 Oh, It's a blutiful day 
 It's a blutiful world 
 I'm in a blutiful car 
 And got a blutiful girl 
 It's a blutiful night 
 My chain blings blue in the light 
 I'm blutiful when I grind 
 I'm blutiful when I shine 
 (Verse 2: Spider Loc) 
 Blue berry blunt wrapped 
 Gettin' blue back 
 Bay mack plaque in the back of the blue 'Lac 
 Navy Blue long sleeves on my blue tees 
 Powder Blue knock-offs on my blue dees 
 Got a blutiful glow from that blue ice 
 Crack the crack game nice with the blue dice 
 Light the blunt with the torch and the flame blue 
 I'm in the fastlane gettin' my brains blewed 
 Blue kicks look good with the blue fit 
 I keep a blue choke chain on my blue pit 
 Stuff a dove worth the buzz in a blue bag 
 Jumpin' out the blue Jag 
 With a blue rag 
 Blue belts, blue hats blue coats 
 Don't sang but I do hum blue notes 
 High as a kite all night off the Blue Dolphin 
 When I go lay me in the blue coffin 
 Oh, It's a blutiful day 
 It's a blutiful world 
 I'm in a blutiful car 
 And got a blutiful girl 
 It's a blutiful night 
 My chain blings blue in the light 
 I'm blutiful when I grind 
 I'm blutiful when I shine 
 (You next Snoopy Blue ha ha) 
 (Snoopy Blue: talking) 
 Hey hold up Spider, How you gon do a song called " Blutiful World"' 
 And Snoopy Blue ain't in it? Ca- rip! 
 (Verse 3: Snoopy Blue) 
 Everything blue from the shirt, to the shoe to the strings 
 Rims, to the car earrings to the chain 
 Yeah I bang 
 Cuzz you can't tell by the colors? 
 Snoopy Blue in the blue mink middle of the summer chillin' 
 My birth stone blue ain't that a trip? 
 A coincidence, nah I was born a crip 
 It's a blue fact the house blue, trim blue 
 And every time you see Snoopy he in something blue 
 From Dark Blue, to Sky Blue, Royal blue is mine 
 Sippin' Blueway easty like the Blue Line 
 Off a blue Puma never mind the blue rumors 
 Bumpin' Bobby Blue blowin' on some blue persuin' 
 This blue money cause them blue dice stay skippin' 
 Like blue rags get shown when niggas set trippin' 
 I'm in blue more than ya whole hood nigga 
 Why you think they call me Mr. Snoopy Blue nigga 
 Oh, It's a blutiful day 
 It's a blutiful world 
 I'm in a blutiful car 
 And got a blutiful girl 
 It's a blutiful night 
 My chain blings blue in the light 
 I'm blutiful when I grind 
 I'm blutiful when I shine
