It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim the microphone soloist 
 Follow procedures the crowd couldn't wait to see this 
 Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus 
 Who wouldn't believe this I heard the word on the street is 
 I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas 
 They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of 
 So I made some more to put the New World in Order 
 With Mathematics, put your status above the average 
 And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics 
 'Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of peformin' 
 Brain stormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin' 
 On and on and, I got the whole world respondin' 
 Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warnin' 
 The Emperor, well known for, inventin' a sentence 
 Full of adventure, turnin' up the temperature 
 Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again 
 To be in the state of min'd that Rakim is in? 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim 
 When I'm out proppin', either, hangin' or shoppin' 
 People see me stop and ask me when the album droppin' 
 The wait is over, information like a soldier 
 Like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older 
 I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents 
 My only challenge, is not to explode in violence 
 I'm Asiatic, and blazin' microphones a habit 
 At least once durin' the course of a day, it's automatic 
 In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharaoh 
 Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow 
 Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me 
 You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi 
 More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples 
 A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle 
 Thoughts that's trifle, I'm bustin' these for you 
 Aiyyo, technical difficulties is through 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 When I float at night, I show 'em new heights, I go to write 
 They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic 
 Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is 
 Still leave authors and writers with arthritis 
 Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style 
 First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile 
 The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now 
 'Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while 
 So be alarmed, what you 'bout to see is the bomb 
 Like, 3-D in' 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom 
 My notebook's my bond like the Holy Quran 
 Since I came in the door, said it before 
 But no I ain't down with Eric B no more 
 At night the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme 
 So yo I'm online, it's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 Rakim, the microphone soloist 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time
