You and me (You and me) 
 We used to be together (Used to be) 
 Everyday together (Everyday) 
 Always (Always) 
 You was dead from the beginning, all I had to do was survive 
 In a race against millions where they lose they die 
 ? 
 ? 
 At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide 
 I found heaven in you, You shared your light with me 
 Gave me insight way before the light hit me 
 It's more than just a bone 'cause we inseparable 
 Even when they cut the cord on the ambilocal 
 Never martyred a moment away 
 And fix whatever was wrong and always know what to say 
 The same way to my sisters and brothers 
 Always honest, and showed me what unconditional love is 
 The voice of a goddess, the stars twinkle in your eyes 
 My heaven on Earth or angel in disguise 
 If you was here I'd just hug and kiss you 
 'Cause to me words can't explain how much I miss you 
 You and me 
 We used to be together 
 Everyday together 
 Always 
 I watched the ladies shine, and stay on their grind 
 While the world weighed heavy on the lady's mind 
 It was a crazy time 
 It's like the world stopped fast with pap's pass in '89 
 The harder we cry, the harder you cry too 
 ? 
 It's hard to keep going, the harder you try to 
 ? 
 You tried to be strong and keep the fam together 
 ? 
 While you smile with your open arms 
 ? 
 You said it takes some time, take it slow, but time will take it's toll 
 And the stakes is high, till the day you die 
 But I refuse to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye 
 You and me 
 We used to be together 
 Everyday together 
 Always 
 I really feel that I'm losing my best friend 
 I can't believe this could be the end 
 I'm starting to see how short life is 
 Every second it gets shorter, but your heart get warmer 
 And you get stronger 
 Even when they said you need a transplant and dialysis to live longer 
 ? 
 You still managed to live life to the fullest for years 
 And then things got complicated 
 They found a donor so they operated 
 A gift and a curse, and concern that things took a turn for the worse 
 And even if I seen the signs I doubt the actions 
 Nothing had prepared me for what was 'bout to happen 
 The hospital; the 18th floor, vivid 
 July 18th, 2005 I can't forget it 
 It's that day I'll forever know 
 The end; the day I hope will never come 
 You and me 
 We used to be together 
 Everyday together 
 Always 
 I really feel that I'm losing my best friend 
 I can't believe this could be the end
