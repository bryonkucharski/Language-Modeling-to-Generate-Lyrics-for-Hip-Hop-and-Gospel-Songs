Uh?..I got it good (Neyo) 
 I put product in the street that sell quicker than weed, I spit it raw like I'm flippin a key 
 I got what y?all need (Satisfaction Guaranteed) 
 I got what y?all need (Satisfaction Guaranteed) 
 I got pure for the fiends give you more than a breeze, through ya blood stream quicker than D, 
 I got what y?all need (Satisfaction Guaranteed) 
 I got what y?all need (Satisfaction Guaranteed) 
 Uh, it's what they been waitin for?? 
 I put the whole world in a dope fiend and still leaning, a many years away from the game they still fiendin 
 My hustle and flow, sound like C-notes, smoke like a pound hit the town like key-notes 
 I bag it up and get it crackin' in clubs, go on tours like I'm trafficking drugs 
 (I got what y?all need) 
 Who want musical narcotics, they all got it, bomb product will sure profit when y?all cop it 
 Any hood or any city I'm pumpin in, any slum I'm in, my custom is come again 
 Spit flow by the boatload like a Columbian, my shipments go out then bring the money in 
 Like supplies the product than do the pra bricks, go out my way, so biters can't dupe what I spit 
 Like Freddy told Priest in that superfly flick, playa you always got some superfly shhhhhh 
 Uh, It ain't a city I ain't moving weed in, the world wonder my product got 'em hallucinating 
 Droppin' heaviest rhymes known, to every minds flown, keep it poppin' until its clockin in every time zone 
 Uh, time is money, my grind is hungry, it's for my dudes and my dime honeys 
 (I got what y?all need) 
 Things run up in it mass where I been, nothing get 'em high as a bag of Rakim 
 I'm red like Canadian, cuss wit a Opium touch a fat piece of hash, seen soap with some dust 
 I got it so good, I got the whole hood smoking it, coke cookers kill for the flow to cook coke in it 
 The new form of crack, turn fans to fanatics hip hop hands to attacks fiends hit off that 
 DJ's cut it, let the streets step on that, still a hundred percent pure King Heron's back 
 I got a 'bout a million Mami's that call me they ex love 'cause I kept 'em ex thug and F'd up like sex drugs 
 They never come down futuristic high; I leave em, spaced out so they can kiss the sky 
 It's like Budda, Mami's say, man is he blessed Pac to push a man in a vest 
 They won't relapse no indeed he's back, my rap flow natural aphrodisiac 
 I'm a key to a user, piano to a dealer, liquor to a alcoholic to smokers a piff of chocolate 
 The gospel, for the ghetto so spit the gossip, is he Moses to drugs, either way it's a profit 
 Call me your drug lord, spit commandments you hooked, it's the King pin every day I get a book 
 Playing my surveillance tapes, I'm hot on the streets, even cops on the beat they call copping the heat 
 (Neyo)
