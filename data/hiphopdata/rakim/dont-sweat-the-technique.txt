Don't sweat the Technique (2x) 
 Let's trace the hints and check the file 
 Let see who bit to detect the style 
 I flip the script so they can't get foul. 
 At least not now, it'll take a while 
 I change the pace to complete the beat 
 I drop the bass, till MC's get weak. 
 For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep... 
 'Cause when I speak, they freak 
 To sweat the technique 
 I made my debut in '86 
 Wit a melody and a president's mix 
 And now I stay on target and refuse to miss 
 And I still make hits 
 Wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps 
 My underground sound vibrates the streets 
 MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps 
 When they sweat the technique 
 Don't Sweat the Technique 
 They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but 
 Researchers never found all the pieces yet 
 Scientists try to solve the context 
 Philosophers are wondering what's next 
 Pieces are took to last who observe them 
 They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them 
 My ideas are only for the audience's ears 
 For my opponents, it might take years 
 Pencils and pens, are swords 
 Letters put together form a key to chords 
 I'm also a sculpture, born with structure 
 Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the 
 Difficult styles that'll be for the technology 
 Complete sights and new heights after I get deep 
 You don't have to speak just seek 
 And peep the technique 
 But don't sweat the technique 
 I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap 
 Then I get deep and the weak then complete their 
 Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete 
 They never grow old techniques become antiques 
 Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant 
 And the wild style'll have much more volume 
 Classical too intelligent to be radical 
 Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical 
 Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years 
 They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas 
 It's cool when you freak to the beat 
 But don't sweat the technique 
 Don't sweat the technique (2x)
