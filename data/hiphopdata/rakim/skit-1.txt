It feel good, ya knahmean? 
 To uh, come back and and get embraced 
 That's that's like the best part y'know? 
 Bein bein gone for a while y'know 
 Walk through the streets 
 'Yo Ra yo when you comin' out, you gotta come out' 
 This and that 
 Y'know, so y'know I always want to come back 
 Had little setbacks, but umm 
 To comeback and get embraced man, that's the best part
