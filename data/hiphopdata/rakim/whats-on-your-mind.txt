I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn 
 Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken 
 On the A-train, picking at her brain 
 I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name 
 I said I still like your style of fashion 
 But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion 
 Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot 
 Is it because your sign don't talk a lot 
 She turned away, no play, I said ok 
 You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day 
 Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight 
 I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night 
 Next stop was mine, a familar scene 
 I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green 
 Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel 
 If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel 
 See I don't bend and I won't rust 
 And I don't break and I won't bust 
 Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat? 
 Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete 
 I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me 
 Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me? 
 Hm, I didn't want to play myself out 
 I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout 
 Now was she shy, she didn't walk by 
 She came in the store then she even said hi 
 Curiosity- at a high velocity 
 Maybe possibly she had the hots for me 
 I said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine 
 I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time 
 If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find, 
 I want to know what's on your mind 
 About a week went by and I called her, "Hello" 
 I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no 
 Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't want to stress you 
 Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you 
 See I want to get to know you so I can show you 
 What a strong relationship can grow to 
 But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me 
 Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me 
 Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple 
 Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you 
 Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions 
 Next you see ectacy's explosions 
 Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time 
 I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime 
 And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find... 
 I want to know what's on your mind 
 I want to know what's on your mind 
 Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely 
 I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me 
 So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams 
 And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen 
 But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown 
 How do the 125th street sound 
 Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo 
 Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow 
 Then after that get into it, I mean intimate 
 Every word is an instrument 
 Making sounds and tones and songs and moans 
 My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones 
 You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring 
 It's always a new song to sing 
 The next day I went back to the her rest 
 Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse 
 She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on 
 Smelling like Liz Claiborne 
 I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables 
 She sat next to me and said what's up wit you 
 I got the feeling for sexual healing 
 A mental healing ; how you feeling 
 She caught the effect and said she feel the same 
 Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain 
 Desire's yearning, the fire's burning 
 You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learning 
 Now I'm ready to explore you inner world 
 It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl... 
 Take it easy, cut off the TV 
 Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me, 
 Use your physical form if I'm hard to find 
 'Cause now I know what's on your mind... 
 'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
