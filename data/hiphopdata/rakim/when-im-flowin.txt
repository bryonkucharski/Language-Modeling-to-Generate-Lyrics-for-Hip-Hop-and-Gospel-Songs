Yes yes y'all, check it out y'all (repeat 2X) 
 Chorus: Rakim 
 (Yo) I find a show, rhyme till it's time to go 
 I'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow 
 Yo, my M.O., makin' all kind of dough 
 From the info that Rakim show, y'know? 
 Verse One: Rakim 
 Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means 
 To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene 
 My adventures show like a three dimensional screen 
 'Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes 
 Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic 
 Better tell 'em forget it, 'cause I'm telekinetic 
 Crowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin 
 Styles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin 
 Bustin' techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win 
 Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin 
 Composin, then leave the mic full of corrosion 
 Don't test this, or best to expects this explosion 
 At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms 
 Killin' syllables with poisonous synonyms in em 
 Ideas is blowin', mics is blowin' 
 From what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin 
 Verse Two: Rakim 
 When I'm flowin, theoretically speakin' like a drummer 
 I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer 
 Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in 
 And make you focus on the future after seein the beginning 
 And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet 
 Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it 
 Up another notch turn the dial till it stops 
 More watts you got, more things to watch 
 Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory 
 Keep scopin till you hear me, words is spoken clearly 
 It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin 
 Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin 
 Verse Three: Rakim 
 Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic 
 Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic 
 Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet 
 I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic 
 Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown 
 I hope your microphone's accident prone 
 Raw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own 
 Leavin' your periphereal vision in a zone 
 But not the twilight, from the insight that I write 
 And recite, in my mic'll be bright, 'cause I like 
 The night glowin', it's out of sight when I'm showin 
 Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin 
 Verse Four: Rakim 
 Yo, accurate tactics "Make Em Clap to This" 
 When I "Move the Crowd", my "Rhythm" still don't miss 
 Breeze through melodies cause "It's Been A Long Time" 
 My "Lyrics" is "Fury" and rappers hate to hear me rhyme 
 Every antidote that I quote, is "No Joke" 
 Nobody's smilin' "In The Ghetto" from the notes I wrote 
 My high techniques wreck and disrepect beats 
 Have you "Follow-in The Leader" up and down the streets 
 So "Kick Along" as I rip a song with pull 
 As the rhyme goes on I get "Paid In Full" 
 It's Rakim, I'm indicatin rhymes for the showin 
 Check it out y'all, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin 
 Straight up, Rakim Allah the Fiend of the Microphone still flowin 
 You know? One love to ? comin' through your livin' room soon, straight up 
 ?, One love 
 The whole tri-state, one love 
 Rakim Allah baby, y'know? 
 It's on, what, check it out y'all, check it out
