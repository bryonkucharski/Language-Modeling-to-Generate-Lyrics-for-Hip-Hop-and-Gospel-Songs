[Intro/Hook] (2x) 
 If you can see if you can solve the mystery 
 The answer revolves around your history 
 So carefully 
 I drop this degree 
 Scientifically and realistically (Who is God?) 
 In eternal blackness in the midst of the darkest night 
 Proteins and minerals exist within specks of light 
 Solids liquids and gases and sparks of light within 
 Infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights 
 No beginning or ending, the seven dimensions 
 Enough space for more than a million words and inventions 
 To travel through time within enough room to be the womb 
 Of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine 
 With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather 
 In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter 
 Energies explode he below to keep releasin 
 Atoms by the millions, till the numbers increasin 
 Till it was burnin he kept returnin itself to the source 
 The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force 
 He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws 
 All caused by his mental intercourse, who is God? 
 He began to explain his craft, the master in the attic 
 He dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics 
 His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system 
 The complete number nine which means born or existed 
 He gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic 
 So you wouldn't take it for granted 
 They rotated they own distance around the sun 
 And fully submit to the existence of one 
 And each one was promised everlasting perfection 
 If each one keeps spinnin in the same direction 
 To the East, and each speak the motion of peace and harmony, 
 And each show devotion to teach 
 The universe is to come, the whole world must go according 
 Know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin' 
 So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound 
 Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round 
 From unconsciousness, to consciousness 
 By knowledging his wisdom his response is this 
 A understanding, which is the best part 
 He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start 
 He pursued show and prove every move in order 
 Back to the source he let off his resources in the water 
 Climb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees 
 See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas 
 And the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land 
 And expand, usin' the same clays to born man 
 In his own image our origin begins in the East 
 Culture rise to breed, with the powers of peace 
 Deal in equality nature's policy is to be God 
 Build or destroy positively born life like Allah 
 And each one was given everlasting perfection 
 If each one keep living in the same direction 
 And life was life, and love was love 
 We went according by the laws of the world above 
 They showed us physically, we could reach infinity 
 But mentally, through the century we lost our identity 
 Life start and ending, we got trife and started sinning 
 Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin 
 And what was once easy became confused and hard 
 Which brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God? 
 Sixty-six trillion years since his face was shown 
 When the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known 
 Check Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John 
 It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran 
 Wisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God 
 G.O.D. you and me Gomars O Dubar? 
 Knowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star 
 Man, Woman and Child, and so is Allah 
 Bear witness to Allah, gave birth to all 
 For Allah was all, and therefore, life itself 
 And the universe gave birth to man 
 The universe was man, and man was the universe 
 And the universe was always existed 
 And existence was life 
 And life is Allah 
 And Allah had no beginning because he is, what always was 
 Rakim 
 Allah, peace 
 Now who is God?
