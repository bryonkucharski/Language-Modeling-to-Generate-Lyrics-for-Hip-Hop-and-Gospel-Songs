Remember that? 
 Turn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across 
 The rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time 
 I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain 
 I entertained things'll never be the same 
 DJ's are conveyed if the label OK it 
 Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it 
 On the radio, with the crazy flow 
 I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show 
 When I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm 
 In control and leave your soul overwhelmed 
 Another influence of beats and instruments 
 Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense 
 When you was playin' Pac Man it was the jams I packed 
 Peeps would swarm when I was perform in, black I'm all that 
 Back before they turned hip-hop to rap 
 It always a place to party at, remember that? 
 I remember the spots that used to be hot 
 Just like the roof top, a place that only few can rock 
 On a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot 
 Until you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops 
 Here come the cops, time to go home, get in order 
 'Cause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happenin' at the Latin Quarter 
 House of havoc when it came to fourteen carat 
 And if you had it yeah kids'd try to grab it 
 It's cool at the Red Parrot we was doin' it there 
 I was the first one to rip it at the Union Square 
 Me and DJ Red Alert did work 
 A crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt 
 I did encores at the Encore, they wanted more 
 I kicked a freestyle till I heard the crowd roar 
 Like the Funhouse, Bronx Center never endin black 
 Place to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that? 
 Remember that? (3X) 
 Open the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand 
 Wildin music's loud and microphone's growlin 
 Tickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour 
 Rippin basketball arenas back then 
 Even afterparties, posses of players and hotties 
 Everybody was Gotti, spreadin bucks like shotties 
 Spendin cash, to make a good time last 
 Thoughts that I had give me a blast of the past 
 Memories of unforgettable times on my mind 
 Dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes 
 The people I met, and the sets that got wrecked 
 All the mics I checked, most of all life's effects 
 And peace to all the people I grew up around 
 In the streets back when beats had a rougher sound 
 I used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile 
 Keep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile 
 Cause some things are just too good to be forgot 
 Like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot 
 Certain records always seem to make me reminisce 
 And when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this 
 My life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds 
 I hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear 
 I like the way it went down and alla that, in fact 
 It mean a lot, cause you can't bring it back, remember that 
 Remember that? (3X)
