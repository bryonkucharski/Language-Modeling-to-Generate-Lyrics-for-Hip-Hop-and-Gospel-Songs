Look what y'all made me do 
 This is your koran or bible 
 To be a true emcee icon or idol 
 The contents you put in your songs are vital 
 Like training for the ufc you want a title 
 Slam thoughts on a canvas flip 'em and pin 'em metaphors and similes and synonyms in em 
 Spit heat around the town the more you get it heard till you spit at 2000 miles before it hit a curve 
 Then flood your rhymes and your rap pages word play punch lines and catch phrases 
 Heat sports with players and ballers new game street talk straight off the corners new slang 
 I got heat for crowds for those that pursuit it 
 Spitters I show you flow till your vocals are through it 
 I m showing you freestyle just focus into it 
 If you a gee ill show you how to cope when you do it 
 Forever sick like catching aids is 
 In a class of greatness for magic phrases 
 My predicates last for pages every letter fit trend setter like fashion statements 
 My quotes get a shrine in the hood forever 
 I wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together 
 Soon as I make 'em rappers take 'em analyze 'em for days and para phrase em 
 I'm back hip hoppers 
 I back my scripts and documents 
 Raps hit the block it's a wrap it's the apocalypse 
 The hood give my rap flow names like nine eleven and crack cocaine 
 I hit the building it gets hotter in em 
 It's like birds most rappers don't know how to flip em 
 I got hip 'em get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em I bust a rhyme then I school 'em for for free I scholarship em 
 Chorur:song the competition know the deal your not ready now 
 Because your dealing with the R know how it's going down this is it your so sick with your skills your flow goes right in you can kill rap 
 Its hard since you can flip it isn't it bars its infinite so ra deliver it far different 
 Hard lyric and part instruments start spitting the articulate y'all rhythms get 
 Till every syllable you drop is pivotal 
 It's not original it's not as memorable 
 Ill lyrical till hes so popular they sick of you 
 Pandemic a threat level five its critical 
 Kill 'em off with a word like euthanasia 
 Till it spread to the youth in asia 
 In the booth I'm major my music monumental I'm a mogul 
 You gonna make sense I'm gonna show you 
 You got to put the life in them lines make the deaf hear sight to the make your flow tighter brighter design 
 So if the mic is your grind then biting s a crime especially if a ghost writers writing your rhymes. 
 Chorus : it don matter if I ain't on the page 
 You gonna tell me what you want 
 I give it to you the way you want it show you how to flow and how to rip any phrase you you want you just keep your eye on me I show you how to emcee 
 If its wack ordinary displays you want tell what you want I give it to you the way you want show you how to flow and how to rip any stage you on I can show you how to emcee like I got a degree
