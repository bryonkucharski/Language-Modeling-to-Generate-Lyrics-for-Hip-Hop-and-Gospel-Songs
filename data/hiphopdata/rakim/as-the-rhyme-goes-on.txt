Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
 'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
 You sweat as you step about to get hype 
 Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 
 You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
 If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
 Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
 Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 
 If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
 And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
 Holds and controls you till I leave 
 You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 
 The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
 Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
 Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
 Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 
 And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
 And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
 Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
 Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 
 Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
 By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
 You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
 I draw a crowd, like an architect 
 The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
 And every state can't wait, so they attack 
 Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
 It'll be more room if MC's play the back 
 I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
 If I wasn't, then why would I say I am 
 The microphone fiend if I was a fake 
 Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 
 I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
 Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
 The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
 Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 
 So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
 If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
 Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
 Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 
 I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
 So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
 Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin' 
 MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin' 
 Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
 "Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again" 
 'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
 Tape by tape and page by page, 
 When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
 The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
 Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
 I made it up myself and I planned it 
 For other MC's who waste time 
 Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
 I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
 The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 
 They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
 To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
 Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
 So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 
 Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
 You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
 So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
 Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, 
 I want you to hear this perfectly clear 
 Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? 
 I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song 
 The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...
