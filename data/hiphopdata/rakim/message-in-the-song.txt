Y'all know what my purpose is 
 I spit verses that lift curses off my dead president worshipers 
 Back where the surface is gangsters and murderers 
 Making money made us merciless 
 It's the birth of the streets it's over they said 
 Rappers crossed over they dead 
 I spit my verse with technique till they know when they ledge 
 First to compete then I'm over their heads 
 He too lyrical and too subliminal 
 Every day from spiritual too criminal 
 It's a message in the bottle open it 
 It's a lesson in survival cope with it 
 It don't make sense to die for the root of evil 
 It get too cerebral when that don't seem lethal 
 Either way is hell I can't save the world 
 But I can show them how to save themselves 
 From the? 
 Evil things that people do, sometimes, legal dreams that we pursue, sometime we don't think that we can lose, sometimes 
 Call it >>>>, it's the root of evil we the proof, some times it's a plea from me to u 
 I seen through the eyes of the prophets 
 King tutankhamun 
 And Martins and Malcolms 
 And Elijah Mohameds 
 Wise with knowledge 
 Paid in full interest aside in the pockets 
 Just rise with the topics 
 Rise economics I show you that time is more valuable than them diamonds in your watches 
 U grind where the block is you die for those dollars 
 Plus work for them too you know right where wallet is 
 Thugs is pitchin chicks is in the club stripping 
 Flippin drugs and pimpin' hood is flood of grippin 
 Latin kings and black guerillas governments 
 In fact hopng we don't go at these go at these cracker killers 
 It sound like a set up and we the victims 
 One out of a million will beat the system 
 Here and wish for flippin brinks is over with 
 Take your chips and go legit

 To my g's on the block that do what they gotta do 
 Don't get me wrong I don't judge I'm not knockin' you 
 Guess that's what not having a job will do 
 People starving gotta get their dollars too 
 Get that prop at night it's a lot of strife 
 My advice is don't get blinded by the lights 
 Drug money and blood money got a price 
 6 feet under or 25 to life 
 Do the crime and you might do the time you served it 
 What it's worth when you do a crime and get murdered 
 Time is precious it's time we earned 
 Its time to questioned your grind isn't working 
 It's time that we changed the game 
 We been waitin for change and exchange 
 Why play with death play it safe momma 
 And do your best to stay away
