*Singing* Ah, ah, ah... 
 *Whistle* 
 "Ghetto Music" --> KRS-One 
 (Here we go...) 
 "Yo" --> Mobb Deep 
 "And my name is Rakim..." --> The R 
 (Repeat 5X) 
 Yo, the saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens 
 Properly push pens, and show quality gems 
 The horrors be grim, but yo maybe tomorrow we win 
 If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend 
 I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends 
 I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins 
 If I decide we in sin, then my prophesy ends 
 But the God'll begin, watchin my odyssey spin 
 In the place where war be, based on a true story 
 Territory was made for me to pursue glory 
 Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn 
 Every capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo 
 *Chorus A* 
 So all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal 
 Persona is unbombable?, trust me son 
 I continue like a saga do, bringin' you the drama to 
 Allow you that the chronicle has just begun 
 *Chorus B* 
 "The saga begins" --> Mobb Deep 
 "The soul controller, Rakim" --> Rakim 
 "Set it off... yo, the saga begins" --> Mobb Deep 
 "Still say a rhyme after the next one" --> Rakim 
 (Repeat 2X except 8th line is "You know that I'm the soloist" --> Rakim) 
 Yo, my never-ending epic, got the world spinning hectic 
 I quickly spread it, till the whole city's infected 
 Suspense that I supply intensify 
 Then commence as my daily events go by 
 You get involved in this, paragraphologist 
 Narratin novelist, market this, sound marvelous 
 I'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic 
 Most definite, every episode's a epidemic 
 So when you research, check it, here go the evidence 
 They represent with lyrical negligence for presidents 
 My science existed, without the fiction 
 Every inscription is a special edition 
 *Chorus A*, *Chorus B* 
 Yo, the legacy lives, let 'em see what the pedigree is 
 Mega-thesis, blessin these kids with extra features 
 The depth's deep as, the deepest sea is 
 Telepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis 
 Ideas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters 
 Lyrics you hear it, devastating the way you ear it 
 So stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more 
 So soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store 
 The names have changed the game remain the same 
 How one came to reign on his claim to fame 
 No stoppin' this I'm droppin' this with hip-hop in this 
 And when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse 
 *Chorus A*, *Chorus B* 
 *Variations of Chorus B to fade*
