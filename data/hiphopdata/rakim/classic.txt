Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it's now another drought 
 Everyone's a killer, wow we buggin out 
 Since 86 showin the crowd what I'm about 
 And they still want to know when the album comin' out 
 Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids 
 What they definition of Classic is 
 Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth 
 And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
 And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters 
 Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
 I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders 
 In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
 Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas 
 Prolly worn when KRS One teaches 
 Nas, made you look, before the haters 
 I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus 
 This is classic 
 Classic, better than I'v ever been 
 Talent, 
 If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
 Classic 
 Better than I'v ever been 
 Kanye West: 
 Can't buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
 It's performin?, look how long the line is 
 That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless 
 That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
 What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
 That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
 I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
 To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed till? you listened to my pace 
 'Cause I be killin' shit, but that's evident, and y?all feelin' it, but I expected it 
 If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
 Classic, better than I'v ever been 
 Talent, 
 If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
 Classic 
 Better than I'v ever been 
 Nas: 
 Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this 
 O you went platinum ? yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice 
 New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time 
 It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man 
 Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
 When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, by the time you could afford it the car ain't important 
 In the streets silent, it's just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment 
 Leavin' your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
 I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
 I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to 
 Classic, better than I'v ever been 
 Talent, 
 If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
 Classic 
 Better than I'v ever been 
 KRS One: 
 How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don't be blinded 
 Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don't need 'em I got your respect 
 KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop 
 And we's a nation, don't you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
 Instead of broadcasting how we smokin' trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's 
 Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and rap 
 Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people 
 Peace, love, unity, and Havin' fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One
