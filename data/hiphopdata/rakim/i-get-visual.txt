(Keep you goin' when I'm flowin' smooth enough) 
 Yes Yes Y'all, I still fiend by any means a flow 
 And I go through extremes don't intervene 
 My adventures show like a three dimensional screen 
 'Cause I mention many things and I'm presenting many scenes 
 I guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic 
 Better tell 'em forget it, 'cause I'm telekinetic 
 Ideas is blowin', mics is blowin' 
 From what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 Poetical pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic 
 Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic 
 Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet 
 I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic 
 Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacitys blown 
 I hope your microphones accident prone, raw footage is shown 
 But only showin' scenes of my own 
 Puttin' your periphereal vision in a zone 
 But not the twilight, from the insight that I write 
 And recite, in my mic, will be bright, 'cause I like 
 The night glowin', its out of sight what I'm showin 
 Rappers are knowin', I keep it goin' when I'm flowin 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 When I'm flowin', theoritically speakin' like a drummer 
 I take you through the streets, to the park in the summer 
 Or illustrate, a time and place you've never been 
 And make you focus on the future after seein' the beginning 
 And my style wilds like Miles on the trumpet 
 Volume dial is kinda low, need to pump it 
 Up another notch, turn the dial till it stops 
 More watts you got, more things to watch 
 Third eye's wide open, you focus on a theory 
 Keep scopin' till you hear me, words are spoken clearly 
 Its no smoke screens on the scenes that I'm showin 
 Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 Accurate tactics make 'em clap to this 
 When I move the crowd, my rhythm still don't miss 
 Breeze through melodies 'cause it's been a long time 
 My lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme 
 Every antidote that I quote, is no joke 
 Nobodys smilin' in the ghetto from the notes I wrote 
 My high techniques wreck and disrepect beats 
 Have you followin' the leader up and down the streets 
 So kick along, as I rip a song with pull 
 As the rhyme goes on I get paid in full 
 Its Rakim, indicating rhymes for the showin 
 Check it out y'all, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through 
 I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical 
 Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
