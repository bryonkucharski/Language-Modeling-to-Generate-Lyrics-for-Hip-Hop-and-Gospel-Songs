I was mobbin' through the beach, yeah the city by the sea 
 Mama tried to keep me home, but I love the fuckin' streets 
 I was cookin' up a Ki, tryna serve it to the streets 
 Couple niggas had beef so I had to Chief Keef 
 I got homies from the 2, I got homies from the 3 
 I keep everything neutral, I just wanna smoke a leaf 
 I was runnin' up a check, try me, he gon' get the TEC 
 Hear a lot of niggas talk, ain't a nigga press me yet 
 I'm in Houston, V Live, throwin' racks, that's a bet 
 And you ain't a real nigga if you don't rep your set 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Cooking on a pot, got to scale and weigh the rock 
 Almost burned my fuckin' hand, I forgot this shit was hot 
 I'm just tryna get a knot, had the shit up in my sock 
 Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, I could work my own block 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 All these racks I'mma trick on 
 I got gold digger money, gold digger money 
 Hood rich nigga gettin' money, pushin' weight 
 Everything was an 8, now it's lookin' like a plate 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Push it, push it, push it, push it 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money 
 Go get the money, go get the money
