Thirsty, baby bring it over here 
 Thirsty, baby bring it over here 
 Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here 
 Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here 
 I wanna kiss you, girl, I wanna kiss you 
 Girl, I wanna love you 
 Oh, am I moving too fast? 
 Fuck that (Well, well, well...) 
 Your momma must have taught you well 
 'Cause you taste so purified 
 Need to get it while it's hot 'cause I'm cold at times 
 Open up to me and drop your guard, I need the proof 
 Constantly to know if you still have a heart 
 'Cause a nigga done fucked up I feel like I lucked up at north side 
 But hop in your car and bring it to me 
 Promise to love you, and obey 
 And hit it more than once a day 
 Girl I say that genuinely 
 "Fuck that bitch!" It's what you say 
 Bring it over 
 Bring it over 
 Baby bring it over 
 Bring it over to me 
 Now, baby, bring it over 
 Bring it over 
 Baby bring it over to me 
 Bring it, bring it 
 But does he kiss you, girl? 
 Does he kiss you, girl, does he love you? 
 (Tell me what he do) 
 Am I moving too fast? 
 Fuck that (My, my, my...) 
 I thought you were always mine (Yea, I thought some shit) 
 I'll play my role, just give me the script 
 Time to let go, tell him give you your shit 
 Hop in your whip, girl 
 I'm back in the 6, girl 
 Still need a bad bitch who thirsty 
 Shawty holla at me if you heard me 
 Promise to love you, and obey 
 And hit it more than once a day 
 Girl I say that genuinely 
 "Fuck that bitch!" It's what you say 
 Bring it over 
 Bring it over 
 Baby bring it over 
 Bring it over to me 
 Now, baby, bring it over 
 Bring it over 
 Baby bring it over to me 
 Bring it, bring it 
 Bring it, bring it 
 Bring it, bring it 
 Bring it, bring it 
 Bring it, bring it
