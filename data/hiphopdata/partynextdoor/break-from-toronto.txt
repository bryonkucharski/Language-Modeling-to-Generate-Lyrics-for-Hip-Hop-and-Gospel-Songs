That smile on your face 
 Makes it easy to trust you 
 Those in 
 This what Sauga feels like in the night time 
 Watch what she doin' when the light shine 
 Drunk niggas tryin' a talk in the strip club 
 Shawty silhouette looks like a dolla sign 
 Caught up (caught up) 
 That's just how a nigga brought up (brought up) 
 Blow ones for you luney ass niggas 
 Straight bounce for you puny ass niggas 
 My niggas bigger then the bouncer 
 Roll up in the bitch still smell like an ounce 
 Right quick, Right Quick 
 Tight jeans on so she feels my shit 
 Tell me something good baby 
 Tell me something, Tell me something good shawty 
 Come bring it to the hood baby 
 Bring it, bring it back to hood 
 This what Sauga feels like in the night time 
 Bust it up with shawty when the light shines 
 Still fuckin' with the same ass niggas 
 I know you want a break 
 I know you want a break from Toronto 
 West side 
 Oh girl
