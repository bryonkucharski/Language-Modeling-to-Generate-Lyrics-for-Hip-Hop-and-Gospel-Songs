(Oh) 
 Sitting court side, to the game she play 
 I'm chilling most times, but I blame the DJ 
 She the dark-skin chick with a light-skin crew 
 Her pretty face and 'em high heel shoes 
 Got love for them niggas, we got love for you too (I know) 
 See my car is out there, and your girls inside 
 Stop tripping, we just going for a ride 
 Find my niggas if they tryna leave too 
 Either way 
 Why you letting them think for you? 
 When you're a grown ass woman 
 Baby, you're a grown ass woman 
 Why you letting them think for you 
 When you a grown ass woman 
 Baby, you a grown ass woman 
 Why they doing the thinking for you? 
 No, why they doing the thinking for you 
 (Tell me, baby) 
 She wants drop tops, hair blowing in the wind 
 Must be the liquor 'cause it's place she never been 
 "Oh, and pour it up" she said 
 "Oh, and pour it up" she said 
 She tryna leave with me, tryna leave with her 
 But she with her friends, yeah, handful of girls 
 Homie, she fly 
 Blowing grams, I'm tree high 
 She fly like G-5 
 I see your friends tryna tell you how you need to stay back (Oh, yeah) 
 Girl you see the player got a plan, and you know you need that 
 Either way 
 Why you letting them think for you? 
 When you're a grown ass woman 
 Baby, you're a grown ass woman 
 Why you letting them think for you 
 When you a grown ass woman 
 Baby, you a grown ass woman 
 Why they doing the thinking for you? 
 No, why they doing the thinking for you 
 (Tell me, baby) 
 Yeah, I know you know 
 All my niggas in the V.I.' 
 Still bumpin' to Aliyah baby 
 And you rocking with a G now baby 
 Baby no games at all, no 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, I choose you 
 Oh, choose you 
 Oh, I choose you 
 Oh, choose you 
 Oh, I choose you 
 Baby no games at all, no
