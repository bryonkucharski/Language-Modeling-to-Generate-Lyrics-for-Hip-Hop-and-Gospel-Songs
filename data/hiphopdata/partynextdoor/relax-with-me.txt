Find a plane ticket, come right now 
 South Beach, when the sun go down 
 Soft streets for the sunroof down, soft streets for the sunroof down 
 There's Gucci this, Gucci that 
 She used to wear the Baby Phat 
 Got a budget on yo' ass though 
 So she let me bust it on ha' ass (Go!) 
 Hear the clapping, that's the instrumental 
 Girl yo ass, it's so instrumental 
 If you gas, let me push the pedal 
 Every time I lay the pipe, she has a taste for heavy metal 
 Baby girl yeah you should be a rockstar 
 Lay that pussy out, fuck me on the sport car 
 Easy tap down, you, but chu' knew that (but chu' knew that) 
 She love the way I do that 
 That's right! 
 You scared! 
 Oh, 'cause I'mma say it right thing 
 At the right time, at the right place 
 And you won't know what to do 
 You won't know how to relax with me 
 Just relax with me 
 Girl how you make this taste so fucking well 
 I (?) into the kitty, watch the pussy swell 
 I ain't afraid to cross the line with you 
 I ain't afraid to do a line with you 
 This a real nigga talkin' to ya' 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm talking through ya' 
 19 living like dope boy, double Ms, valet got ha' feeling like a coke boy 
 Ballin' ball
