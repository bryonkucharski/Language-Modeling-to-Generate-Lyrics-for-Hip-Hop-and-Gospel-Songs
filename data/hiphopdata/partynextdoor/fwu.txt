When we arguin', it's just me and me 
 I was hardly home, workin' 3 to 3, seems like another time 
 Feels like another time, there will be another time 
 I'll get to, forget you 
 But, you just walked in 
 Once you get to talkin', how I lost it 
 Hard to call it all my fault, mama 
 Tried to keep you out that drama, mama 
 Was it all bad? (Yeah) 
 How's Lamborghini Matte, ha? 
 Tell me where he at now? (Where he at?) 
 Somewhere in the trap now 
 Wonder why he trap now 
 You was a rich bitch, probably need a rich nigga too 
 And if you think about me, I'm 'bout to think about you 
 Need a new chick for my Lamborghini flexin' 
 Workin' in the East but you know we in the West End 
 Name another nigga hustle hard like me 
 With a heart like me 
 Just a young nigga with the time like me 
 You should shine like me 
 Run that nigga, you don't want that nigga 
 But I need a bad bitch that's hotter than me 
 You can hardly admit 
 I'm still tryna fuck, with you 
 Girl I wanna fuck with you (with you) 
 Yeah yeah I'm tryna fuck you, girl, I'm tryna fuck with you 
 Tryna fuck you girl, I'm tryna fuck with you 
 I wanna fuck you girl, you know I fuck with you 
 I wanna fuck you girl, let me roll with you 
 Girl I wanna fuck with you 
 When we arguin', it's just me and me 
 I was hardly home, workin' 3 to 3, seems like another time 
 Feels like another time, there will be another time 
 I'll get to, forget you 
 Go ahead, go ahead, go and ask Billie Jean who's the one? 
 Let the truth be told, I don't believe you know what I want 
 Girl if it's a plan you like, I know the bands you like 
 Know the strands you like, know the brands you like 
 What kind of man you like? Wanna expand your life 
 Girl you were a rich bitch, probably need a rich nigga too 
 And if you think about me, I'm 'bout to think about you 
 Need a new bitch for my Lamborghini flexin'

 Just a young nigga with the time like me 
 You should shine like me
