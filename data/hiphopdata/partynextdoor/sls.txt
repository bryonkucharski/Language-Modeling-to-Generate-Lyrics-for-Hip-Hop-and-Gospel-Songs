 She fuck with Khaled just 'cause we the best 
 IPhone go silent like I ain't need the stress 
 Fuck that shit, you know I need the sex

 Don't tell my dear mama where you work 
 Hit the corner, girl we leave at ten 
 Told my nigga that you'd bring a friend 
 Yeah, you still fire, I ain't need a BIC 
 I got money, I don't need a bitch
