Met you in Houston, but you're from Atlanta 
 No you're from Pennsylvania or somethin' 
 Fuck all I know is, you're hot and you know this 
 You make it easy to blow this, you know this, damn 
 Twerkin' her ass for me 
 Shaped like a glass for me 
 It's like God knew what I liked 
 Damn right, I know what I like 
 Sex tape selfie you an actress 
 Tryna get you wet like a baptist 
 Girl I need all your love right now, but I'll wait 
 'Cause I don't wanna seem like I'm hatin' 
 Baby girl, I really ain't hatin' 
 You've got options and I'm here to let you know 
 You know you got options, babe

 Shorty but you not a bitch, you the one I get money with 
 And you like intrigue me, like you make me want more 
 Like you make me wanna like be with you 
 And I don't know how you do it 
 Because no, I've never felt like this about a guy 
 'Cause the guys are so fucking clingy and annoying to me, it pisses me off 
 They do everything to make me want them 
 You do the total opposite 
 Yfou do everything to make me like want to run away from you 
 You hardly smoke but you wanna smoke my drugs 
 Don't know how to love but you somehow get by love 
 Ferina till 12 and we sip and talk gunplay 
 Church Sunday mornin' and then club until Monday 
 Oh lord, findin' your groceries, your pimp in the parkin' lot 
 Trip after trip 'cause you know that you talk a lot 
 Laughing the whole way, I pull out like skrrt 
 I got drugs, I got lean, does it look like I care? (Stupid) 
 Cuttin' the cake, I got ice on the Rollie 
 High as I am, don't get stopped by the police 
 Ride that dick, girl ride it like it's a pony 
 Hot right now, what do you don't wanna call me? 
 Girl I need all your love right now, but I'll wait 
 'Cause I don't wanna seem like I'm hatin'

 You know you got options, babe
