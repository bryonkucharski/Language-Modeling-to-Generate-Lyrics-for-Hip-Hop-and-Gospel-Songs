Still got it, my nigga 
 Don't worry about me, nigga 
 Never worry about me, nigga 
 Don't worry about me 
 Everybody say they got rack up 
 Show me the rollie 
 Niggas can't count me out 'cause these niggas countin' on me 
 Hoes wanna come see a boy now 'cause hoes wanna fuck with me 
 Subsidized housing is a project 
 Poppa never taught me how to cock it 
 Poppa just taught me how to respect it 
 Sauga City taught me how to pop it 
 Bullets don't come with a nina 
 Gun's don't with a Killer, Gun's don't come for vanilla 
 The choppa' only coming for a nigga 
 Choppa can tell when tequila screw up like Ikea, kea, kea 
 She look like Aaliyah, liyah, liyah, liyah 
 That's how I treat her, treat her, treat her, treat her 
 Bad lil' whoadie 
 Rollie rollie that came with that roll 
 All as a kid I was dreaming 'bout more 
 You fucking with me I got more by the North 
 Ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, you know I got it 
 Still got it, my nigga 
 Don't worry about me, nigga 
 Never worry about me, nigga 
 Don't worry about me 
 Everybody say they got rack up 
 Show me the rollie 
 Everyday a nigga birthday so I need a bigger cake 
 These niggas paying for these bitches, man I'm chilling tryna' find me some real estate 
 Bases loaded eatin' good over here, bitch tell the waiter bring some dinner plates 
 Everybody keep saying that I'm in the lead, didn't know I was in a race 
 Excuse the Versace that's sitting on the floor 
 I'm pimping and Party singing to your ho 
 I told my other girl that I might be late, one way pocket so you know a nigga straight 
 On another note, yeah you know, I still got it in the glove with the pocket rocket 
 Step in the building, bitches get excited, have you ever seen a female riot? 
 Ooh, gettin' too close then somebody might shoot you 
 I left the bullshit in the past, nigga I can see the future 
 Ray Charles-Ray Bans, all I see is money, all I see is honeys 
 In the club blowing your budget 
 Now the haters gon' hate, but the bitches love it 
 Rollie rollie that came with that roll 
 All as a kid I was dreaming 'bout more 
 You fucking with me I got more by the North 
 Ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, you know I got it 
 Still got it, my nigga 
 Don't worry about me, nigga 
 Never worry about me, nigga 
 Don't worry about me 
 Everybody say they got rack up 
 Show me the rollie
