Stop looking for a reason to hate me, just hate me 
 Nobody's perfect you know, I'm working on me 
 They jealous how they lurking on me, I don't mind 
 My new girl's not too thirsty to ride, she riding for me 
 Ride or dying for me 
 Girl, you're the reason, you're lonely tonight 
 But this is the season to get back your life 
 This is your chance (I know you know the truth) 
 Come take a chance (It's not that I blame you, I know you know the truth) 
 When you see (I know you know the truth) 
 It's not that I blame you, it's not you that I blame 
 I blame you 
 Five foot five of pure sexy, I see 
 Every bitch wanna be you 
 Every nigga wanna meet you 
 You're getting bookings in my city 
 I see niggas looking in my city 
 And I know what you been up to 
 But that is no good, it's no good 
 Even though I do it 
 Baby, I'm outchea, baby, I'm outchea 
 You know what I'm pursuing (yeah you can know) 
 Girl, you're the reason, you're lonely tonight 
 But this is the season to get back your life 
 This is your chance (I know you know the truth) 
 Come take a chance (It's not that I blame you, I know you know the truth) 
 When you see (I know you know the truth) 
 It's not that I blame you, it's not you that I blame 
 I blame you 
 And what do you say to a girl that's heard it all before? 
 Tell me 
 And what do you say to a girl that's heard it all before?

 Time is wasting, time is wasting 
 Time is wasting, babe, time is wasting 
 "Bitch, hurry up. This nigga finna' to move on!

 Time is wasting, time is wasting, time is wasting
