Yeah, it's Sauga at sunset 
 Marijuana in the complex 
 Sippin' Henny cause my heart's frozen 
 Stunna' shades 'cause we all rollin' 
 Fuck em' bitches, fuck em' niggas too 
 Fuck em' niggas, what I got's to lose? 
 Mix my drink with some 'gnac 
 Just to buy me some time 
 Then I'm spending it all on you 
 You know me very well 
 The coolest, oh 
 So only time will tell 
 How we do this 
 The music keeps playing 
 And your hearts starts jumping 
 And your head keeps spinning 
 'Cause the bass keeps turning up 
 It's five am 
 And you've just reached your all time high 
 Welcome to the party, welcome, welcome 
 Welcome, welcome, welcome to the party 
 Welcome, welcome, whoa 
 Welcome 
 Baby welcome to
