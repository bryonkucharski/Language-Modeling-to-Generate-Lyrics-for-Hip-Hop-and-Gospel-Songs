I finally realized what I need 
 Can only be royal if you loyal girl 
 And all I need is a woman who will wanna agree with everything that I do 
 And get naked for me when I want her to 
 All I need, make it feel like forever 
 When it's temporary, let's get married 
 Just 'cause this moment deserves a moment 
 Just 'cause this moment, deserves a moment 
 Let's get married, let's get married 
 I'm a get drunk enough and get crazy enough 
 To say something just as crazy as let's get married 
 Let's get married, let's get married 
 Still I need me a freak, I'm coming straight out of Montego Bay 
 You working seven days a week 
 I know how you feel, 'cause I feel the same 
 We put the same shit in our brain 
 Not with that molly, coked up on Dolly 
 All that you need is some green girl you a rockstar when with me 
 Girl I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
 I know, I know, I know, you some times feel 
 Outta control but baby 
 Just 'cause this moment deserves a moment 
 Just 'cause this moment, deserves a moment 
 Let's get married, let's get married 
 I'm a get drunk enough and get crazy enough 
 To say something just as crazy as let's get married 
 Let's get married, let's get married
