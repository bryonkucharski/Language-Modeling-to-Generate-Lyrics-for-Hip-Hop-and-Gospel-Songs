Girl, you're so sexy 
 Everybody should see your body 
 Girl, you're so sexy 
 I think, everyone should see you 
 Everyone should see you in the open 
 Baby, open up for me 
 Open, keep it open, by the ocean 
 Yeah, lipstick wrapped around my lemonade glass 
 Starin' right at her but don't know where she's at 
 (Tell me, the sun goin' up and shit, purple in the sky, feelin' good) 
 And now we're here at Miami Dade 
 Finally here and I'm finally wasted 
 All I'm really tryin' to say 
 Is we could cool delays 
 All the sex in the ocean 
 All the sex on the beach 
 All the sex in the open 
 All the sex in the heat 
 Girl you so sexy 
 You don't know what to do with all the attention on you 
 All the affection, all the attention 
 All these intentions towards you 
 Tonight 
 That's right, that's right 
 Where you at? 
 Summertime shit 
 And now we're here at Miami Dade 
 Finally here and I'm finally wasted 
 All I'm really tryin' to say 
 Is we could cool delays 
 All the sex in the ocean 
 All the sex on the beach 
 All the sex in the open 
 All the sex in the heat 
 Summertime shit, party! 
 One time for my niggas, one time 
 Two times for my bitches, two times
