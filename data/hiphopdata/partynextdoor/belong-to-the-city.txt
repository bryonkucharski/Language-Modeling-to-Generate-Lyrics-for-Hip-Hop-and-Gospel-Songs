If I knew I was wastin' my time 
 Would end up wastin' my time 
 With all these shoulda coulda wouldas 
 I'm in her ear one time 
 Tryna tell her how I ride 
 She heard it all 
 I know she heard it all 
 Girl I can change your life 
 But you heard it all 
 But you heard it all 
 I'm from the city 
 Where you ain't gotta love to love 
 You ain't gotta love to fuck 
 Girl, I'm just tryna say... 
 I'm from the city 
 So don't believe what they say 
 Just believe what they do tell 
 You can't tell these bitches nothing 
 She belongs to the city 
 They gone, they gone, they gone 
 They was lookin' for nothing (somethin') 
 She belongs to the city 
 (Yeah you know)
