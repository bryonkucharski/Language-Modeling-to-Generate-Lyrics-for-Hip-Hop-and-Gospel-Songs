Girl this summer, you'll be looking for 
 You'll looking for me while I'm riding in 
 That brand new whip you wanted 
 All I ever asked for was patience 
 (All I ever asked and you know it) 
 Patience and pussy but mostly patience 
 Swear I used to keep you waiting in 
 Now you waiting on something better 
 Girl what's better than this 
 We were supposed to do big things 
 Now you waiting for somebody 
 Girl, what's better than this? 
 Popping champagne over here 
 Girl it ain't a thang over here 
 Blowing money fast over here 
 Blowing all this cash over here 
 Popping champagne over here 
 Girl it ain't a thang over here 
 Blowing money fast over here 
 Blowing all this cash over here 
 Me and my niggas bucking head first 
 You supposed to be there when my head hurt 
 Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party 
 Celebration on me, well what's up 
 Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed 
 It can't be that hard to find us 
 Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess 
 That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects 
 The boy home, used to take the bus to the block 
 Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block 
 I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block 
 And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot 
 But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience 
 With that said, look what at all we accomplished 
 Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither 
 We all lost mad people, the city wild 
 They gave the task to a purposeful child 
 Verse's starts to get a little more personal now 
 But that's 'cause everybody else sound is so played out tho' 
 Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out tho' 
 A 1000$ bottle it get poured straight out tho' 
 I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out tho' 
 I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real 
 I got hits nigga, you just a bat boy for real 
 Backwoods got peeled, I smoke away all the tears 
 Nothing was the same, including y'all careers 
 The new Cash Money, the new Rocafella 
 Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous 
 Popping champagne over here 
 Girl it ain't a thang over here 
 Blowing money fast over here 
 Blowing all this cash over here 
 Popping champagne over here 
 Girl it ain't a thang over here 
 Blowing money fast over here 
 Blowing all this cash over here 
 On this side...
