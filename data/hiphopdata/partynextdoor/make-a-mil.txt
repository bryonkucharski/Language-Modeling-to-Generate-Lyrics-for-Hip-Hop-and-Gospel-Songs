Faded, swear to God I'm faded 
 My bitch educated, had her clients pay the payment 
 She don't need a damn thing, my bitch look like Tammy Toe 
 Hit the strip like every week plus we burn up half an O 
 It's that life that got no limits, my visa debit be pimped out 
 Condo out in Collin's like that nigga from New Orleans 
 I'm the nigga from the set, though 
 Block been hot since get go 
 Makin' money niggas makin' money since umbilical 
 I'm still ridin' down Centennial 
 Real niggas know where the real strip be 
 Real niggas know what the real hit be 
 Real niggas know what the real lick read 
 And if it all goes down, she down for me 
 And if it all goes down, I'll probably make a mil with her 
 Probably make a mil with her 
 Probably make a mil with her 
 Probably make a mil with her 
 Probably make a mil with her
