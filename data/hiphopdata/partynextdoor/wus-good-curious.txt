 And time's still runnin' 
 And my mind still runnin' 
 Block still hot from your Jimmy Choo's 
 And you know I got it serious 
 So you know I just want an experience

 Shawty you're curious 
 Get serious, oh 
 You say you're curious, oh no 
 Rollin' with codeine and a swisha 
 Shit I just might kiss her 
 She just changed her Twitter 
 To "Party-Gets-Me-Wetter" 
 And you know that I believe it 
 Cause her pussy the meanest 
 She don't fuck with many niggas 
 She don't fuck with any niggas 
 Yeah I call all the dibs on mine 
 I call all the nines and dimes 
 I put on my ice and sneaks 
 She puts on her ice and we 
 We stay mobbin' for a week 
 Hit the strip while she's asleep 
 Shawty know that I'm a freak 
 Shawty know that I'm a freak 
 And that's why you're curious so
