I've been thinking bout what you have done to me 
 The damage is much deeper than you'll ever see 
 Hit me like a hammer to my head 
 I wonder were you pushed or were you led? 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did you do that thing to me? 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did you do that thing to me? 
 The only one who knows the truth 
 Man that's him, me and you 
 My friends they listen to the things I say 
 They listen and they hear more everyday 
 But I know they never understand it 
 Because it was no accident, you planned it 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did you do that thing to me? 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did you do that thing to me? 
 The only one who knows the truth 
 Man that's him, me and you 
 One, two
