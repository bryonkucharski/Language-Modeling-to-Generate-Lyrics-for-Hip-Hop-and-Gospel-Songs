I've never been the brightest guy 
 You know the ones all the gals look for 
 I used to think norweigan wood 
 Was a scandanavian adult book store 
 I recall this fling with a goth metalhead 
 With a pierced labia and purple titties 
 She used to defile me 
 Make me feel lousy and sob while scribblin my little journal entries 
 I'm not out to fuck just malajust 
 Would you be my friend for a thousand bucks? 
 I'm no solar panel plated kutcher made of granulated sugar 
 Due to how my confidence allowance sucks 
 I feel I should probably be re-sexed 
 If she makes me wear this full body v-neck 
 But my name is her with an apostrophe s 
 "Rarely do my yoga instructor and therapist both agree on the poor choices that I make in my sex life, 
 You know? you get the commemorative tofur?" 
 Happy inside 
 Happy inside, even though I'm frowning 
 Happy inside, I don't know why I lie 
 "You know, all my homies need to stop hatin', really." 
 Our OG looks on cozy nooks 
 Are under siege at the blanket fort 
 We've striken fibs of clothes pinned haters 
 With womens lib nomenclature 
 Our dinnerdates accompanied by dialysis machine beeps 
 In your case we should hereby screw while dressed to bee keep 
 What feudal queens are canoodling 
 With this human resource rent a wreck 
 When I scowl at the hole punchers and am gallop poll numbered 
 Say they would rather see my dick in a French press 
 My day is a cheech and chong mis step 
 And my face is a three pronged inlet, come on 
 "Even though, you know, you tried to put my face in a hot waffle iron, 
 I still know that you love me inside, and I'm still feeling you" 
 Happy inside 
 Happy inside 
 Happy inside, I don't know why I cry 
 Blocko blocko blocko blocko 
 Happy happy happy happy (x2) 
 Happy inside 
 Happy inside 
 Happy inside, I don't know why I cry 
 Keep me draped in our calendar becomings 
 ? Would show 'ominous' instead 
 Because it's not likely, 
 That when I'm on tour, chillin' 
 And I freak with girls 
 Then I sign off on some off-shore drillin' 
 Simply because no broads adore us 
 My dry wit's due to clogged pores 
 From chalk-board dust 
 Still I'm the shit on the vanity plates 
 On the tour bus for all the wrong reasons, though 
 Like me being an actual turd
