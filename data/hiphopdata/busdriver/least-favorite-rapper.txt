Busdriver: 
 Uh oh 
 Nocando: 
 'Ey I don't need no popper stoppers, 
 Cause the money in the pop. 
 Nocando, Busdriver. 
 Busdriver: 
 Wait hold on though 
 Nocando: 
 Project blowed 
 Busdriver: 
 Don't say my name though 
 Nocando: 
 Poppin' P's profusely 
 Busdriver: 
 I don't want people to know I'm on this song 
 Nocando: 
 These sneaker geek emcees to me is so Broke Back 
 So fuck sexy in '09 I'm bringing broke back 
 Busdriver: 
 Your favorite rapper's brawny 
 Wearing a French braided hair shirt 
 My bank account been scrawny 
 Since I was a 10th grader square twerp 
 Nocando: 
 Your favorite rapper is extravagant 
 Aside from his pompous name 
 He's like a nursery with more cribs than John McCain 
 Busdriver: 
 Your favorite dude champions every Chicago city slum 
 From his condominium 
 While brandishing his implausible mini-gun 
 Nocando: 
 He sells more drugs than the FDA 
 He's ready for war like FDR 
 I believe him whole-heartedly 
 Because he keeps saying it in every bar 
 Busdriver: 
 Your favorite guy said he shot niggas 
 On the grass lawn in his rap song 
 But he's sweeter than baked goods 
 When he claims his hood as Capcom 
 Nocando: 
 Your favorite rapper's got Alzheimer's 
 Repeats himself like a old timer 
 He works harder than a gold miner 
 When it comes to picking ghostwriters 
 Busdriver: 
 And me, I'm your least favorite 
 With a haircut like a pineapple 
 Wearing khakis torn singing hi-soprano 
 Loading candy corns like it's live ammo 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 Oh, Oh! I'm your least favorite rapper 
 My records only get released in Anchorage, Alaska 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 Oh, Oh! I'm your least favorite rapper 
 Rummaging through debris of screenplays and actors 
 Nocando: 
 What the fuck is wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 Oh, Oh! I can't lease space ships from NASA 
 Because I'm the least favorite rapper 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 I am your least favorite 
 I am your least favorite 
 I am your least favorite 
 Nocando: 
 I am your least favorite rapper 
 My release date is after 
 The D-Day disaster 
 I need to get cheesecake for master 
 Busdriver: 
 I am your least favorite Flavor Flav impersonator 
 Pissing on the circuit breaker 
 Nocando: 
 While the strippers do the percolator 
 Busdriver: 
 I will be spell-checking some blurb in the paper 
 Nocando: 
 Read by the type of hipster 
 That don't like me yellin' all kinds of niggas 
 While I'm vibing with you like Michael Richards 
 Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 Busdriver: 
 Still unliked because my leading single's about 
 Laser beams and force fields 
 And my hoopty's not full of groupies 
 Just Mabellyne and orange peels 
 But I'll serve niggas at the Pizza hut 
 Nocando: 
 And the suburban kids say I'm not street enough 
 But compared to them I'm street as fuck 
 Busdriver: 
 I will put USB ends in their tween cunts 
 Nocando: 
 When it comes to this nerd rap 
 It seems like the black thing's a problem 
 You know what I Idi A-mean 
 I feel like the last king of Scotland 
 Busdriver: 
 So my job has me cultivating all the white guilt 
 Dipping Polaroids in rice milk 
 Smacking Souja Boy wearing corduroys 
 And an iced grill 
 Nocando: 
 The new rap fans listen to 'Ye 
 Start sniffing the yay pretending they're gay 
 Put a switch in their hips and a feminine sway 
 Just to convince the women to stay 
 Busdriver: 
 And sell out like it was Christmas Day 
 And give everyone an admission to pay 
 For a tit in the face 
 Nocando: 
 I was beginning to say 
 What came first the chicken or egg 
 The twist in the fray, dissident fan that listens today 
 Dissipates visits and strays 
 What the fuck 
 Did our whole approach to business decay 
 Busdriver: 
 We underused all the parlor tricks 
 Instead of talking about art and shit 
 I should have put my hardened dick 
 In the hind quarters of Time Warner 
 Nocando: 
 It's over! 
 That fool just served Time Warner, 
 Fools are sniffin' yay, 
 That fool had tits at your Christmas party! 
 Shout out to Forest Whitaker, Idi Amin! 
 Yeah! 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 Oh, Oh! I'm your least favorite rapper 
 My records only get released in Anchorage, Alaska 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 I'm your least favorite rapper 
 Rummaging through debris of screenplays and actors 
 Nocando: 
 What the fuck is wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 Oh, Oh! I can't lease space ships from NASA 
 Because I'm your least favorite rapper 
 Nocando: 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Busdriver: 
 I am your least favorite 
 I am your least favorite 
 I am your least favorite
