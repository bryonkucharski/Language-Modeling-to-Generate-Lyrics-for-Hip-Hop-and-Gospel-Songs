I know this group and they're so avantcore 
 I bought their shit at the mom and pop store 
 And I give all of their songs the top score 
 I'll see them play on their small hip-hop tour 
 They're treated like sex symbols, out the stretch-limos 
 Autographing breasts with lead pencils 
 Now everybody thinks that they're the best new group 
 As if they're a pop band test tube fluke 
 They bought a home that's the size of a ballpark 
 You can only cross the property with a golf cart 
 But they no longer can sell a billion records 
 Because when they first weren't trying was their last brilliant effort 
 Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear 
 Like "i heard you sold this many units" and I say "wish me better luck next year" 
 There seems to be too much water pressure underneath your genre-mesh blur 
 And to be honest I never took interest in the modern day young black teenagers 
 I'd thought they'd gone away replacing what's on gun racks with cheese graters 
 To use on the spongy mind of the L.A. rapper swinging from a monkey vine 
 Style biting used to result in a money fine, but now 
 Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear 
 Like "I'm edgy and I'm risque" and "i say better luck next year" 
 I replied to the wuss with a yo' mama's joke 
 When he said how much he pushed the envelope 
 A group of sexually ambivalent nihilists, crying from an ovarian cyst 
 Picking at a vegetarian dish, idolizing a German band that barely exists 
 But me, my name's never on the full-color flyer 
 I'm just the dull busdriver 
 Thinking till my head is a bowl of dust fibers 
 To all the fools up under their trucker hats 
 Sagging until you can see their plumber's cracks 
 There is no metaphorical meaning 
 So don't bother sifting through the storyboard in one seating 
 It's just horribly demeaning 
 And you can't do burners, I want the colors back 
 Don't want to hear your dumb ideas, just shut your trap 
 Jumping jacks thunder claps in your bubble gum raps 
 Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear 
 Like "i did a song with so-and-so and I got signed" but the checks will never clear 
 Avantcore 
 Avantcore 
 Avantcore 
 So Avantcore 
 Avantcore 
 So Avantcore 
 Avantcore 
 Avantcore 
 Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear 
 Like "I'm the dopest in the world" I say better luck next year.
