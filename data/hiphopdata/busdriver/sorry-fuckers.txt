Sorry Fuckers 
 I'm at my tittie signing at the Barnes Nobles 
 You brown-nose but your downloads only show marginal growth 
 Why do you dress like a lesbian welder? 
 Only a middle-aged woman looks sexy in elk fur 
 You get injured at the hipster bar 
 I hit you with a ninja star and then I speed off in my car 
 My life is like a day-to-day porn shoot 
 You'll mayday for more troops when I say "Sorry Fuckers" 
 See that girl, she's a great lay with her scorched roots 
 Plus she's got a grade-A horse caboose 
 That's my lady! I just squeeze her cheeks 
 While you sit and twitch like a Jesus freak 
 You're from Hollywood; you get your sphincter bleached 
 Sit your ass home and eat your quiche 
 I'm the dude that your girl would be pleased to meet 
 She'll want to suck me off with those beaver teeth 
 But I decline the offer. I drive a flying saucer 
 To perform on neighboring moons 
 And do the giddy-up with some iffy slut 
 Who's drinking pick-me-ups out of those Dixie cups 
 To the young boozer, and the drug user 
 But the syringe on the baking teaspoon 
 That means play this it'll spike your blood sugar 
 I'll have your soul mate tied to the sub woofer 
 Sorry Fuckers 
 You squares fucked up plus your haircut sucks 
 Watch you girl upchuck 
 Sorry Fuckers 
 We get their thumbs up 
 Make 'em cry bleed, dry heave 
 Sorry Fuckers 
 We'll extract the bitch in you 
 Sorry fuckers 
 And dictate what you listen to 
 Give them face time with unloved lady's men 
 Eschewing life through a dumb 80's trend 
 With a litany of pop culture reference points 
 My tenor voice will make the women all wet and moist 
 You act gender bent 
 While I'm wrestling with women in boxers with leopard print 
 And yes, that's me arching a pouring glass at the tee off 
 Me getting the boarding pass at the kiosk 
 Me eating fish with French cream sauce 
 Be celebrated at the confetti toss 
 I'm waving from the Project Blowed parade float 
 Completely nude under my raincoat 
 While you're in your backpacker entrapments 
 Battle rapping with a series of gay jokes 
 You're welcomed to peep game 
 But when they start riding the jock they seldom deplane 
 A deceased cock, a pudding geyser 
 The hung dong's the swung baton of the womanizer 
 But for my bitches it's a springboard 
 To a place where dreams are forged 
 And I'll smack these geeky young twerps 
 Out of their medium shirts
