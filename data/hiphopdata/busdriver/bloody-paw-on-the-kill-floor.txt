 Buy now, I kill for a living... 
 I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve 
 Keep your distance please 
 Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin 
 Makes your heat pistons freeze 
 I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures 
 With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers 
 Who discredit theories and behead your mentors 
 Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge 
 I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst 
 Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over 
 Wearing grim smirks 
 They would like me to convert my gritty edge 
 To unearth my earning potential 
 But my face is so sun burnt 
 Due to all the grassroots grunt work 
 That I won't be co-opted 
 And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped 
 But I'm a street vendor kinds sir 
 This style-free is dopamine 
 It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening 
 You can join my suicide cult 
 Membership is free 
 Take these cyanide eye-drops 
 And peppermint hemlock 
 This is what you have been billed for 
 Dancing on the kill floor 
 To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score 
 This is what you have been killed for 
 Dancing on the kill floor 
 To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score 
 Contrast bohemia to my workplace 
 When I'm racing in carpool lane 
 To sell shit to an art school lame 
 -Don't you think you're hot shit 
 Well what do you have to offer- 
 A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe 
 But they can they pinpoint and nail 
 My distance between art and commerce 
 With just an invoice of a sale 
 I will disappoint an ail 
 Those who want to deny us the majority rule 
 When a will jump in my primordial pool 
 Without knowing where their swim trunks were 
 But not everyone knows 
 What they're called on to encumber 
 You can't know by just logging on with a pin number 
 Buy now 
 You pasty Brits 
 Buy now 
 You crazy chicks 
 Buy 
 'Cause I don't pay attention to rules, 
 Regulations or safety tips 
 Love us 
 Eligible bachelors 
 Love us 
 'Cause we're the Blowed rappers 
 Loved 
 'Cause I tour the country so much 
 I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas 
 Unrelated to your three-legged 
 Preachy bootleggers will do away with you 
 CD duplicators make vegans 
 Do the salad bar swing-pivot 
 Wave your valid parking tickets 
 At the endangered sea-urchin 
 Tell me the name of your political activist key person 
 And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version 
 Of the infamous rap rant 
 Trickling down the baggy pant leg 
 Of this unhappy class aid 
 Covered in shell fragments of this 
 Graffiti tagged glass egg 
 I can sell anything to a hip-hopper 
 Like it's my cathartic something 
 But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting 
 You can dance to death 
 And for no extra charge 
 Give me your debit card 
 So you can have sex with stars 
 This is what you have been billed for 
 Dancing on the kill floor 
 To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
