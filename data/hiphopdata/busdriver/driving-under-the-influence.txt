Niggas, pick up your feet and get it moving because, 
 Our situation ain't improving wit the bible 
 We're moving in to all the units and the side show 
 When you're clueless and foolish and driving under the influence 
 You'll be dead on arrival 
 Niggas, pick up your feet and get it moving because, 
 Our situation ain't improving wit the bible 
 We're moving in to all the units and the side show 
 When you're clueless and foolish and driving under the influence 
 You'll be dead on arrival 
 Metallic ballad, drum machine mallet 
 That may release a pallet of celebrity droppings on the cat walk 
 They were spoon fed to reduce back talk 
 Give you a bloody, little for your money 
 'Cause I caulked your honey 
 Just because she got a runny clit 
 Saying she wants a man in touch with her feelings 
 But she'd rather get fucked to the ceiling 
 Hasn't menstruated in months she's concealing 
 Part of her's sick and breathes and clucks 
 And eats nothing but chicken feed, ear plugs 
 A bum is what she wants stricken with greed 
 She'll have you collecting change into to tin cups 
 She'll eat up your cum drops like gum drops 
 But her young twat's hot like sun spots 
 Fate cannot be determined by a Ouija board 
 But by the CD and mix boards 
 To say out the fifth word of this chord against yours 
 And try to swim to shore 
 I'm not controlled by a recessive gene 
 I wore my impressor jeans 
 Looking for the best of things 
 Swimming in infested streams 
 Taking advantage of big chested queens 
 Busdriver, the master of the freedom of speech 
 On the mean streets where you been seen sleep 
 And your teams weak and that's why 
 You want to redeem me 
 And mother fuckers are so righteous 
 Talking bout get rid of the white bitch 
 Stop rapping high pitched 
 But it's my niche, I'll do what I wish 
 I took a leap of faith over a knee brace 
 But in any case, you're just an empty face 
 Who drinks henny chased, with a weed that's laced 
 I've achieved my place 
 I didn't win it in a sweepstakes 
 So if you sneak on my estate 
 It better be by mistake or leave needing a knee brace 
 Ah Jeez don't hate, we don't high speed chase 
 We don't speak to cheap skates, or eat beef stakes 
 Now, with a feta aid I made cheese and papes 
 And sold heaps of tapes and made niggas replace 
 But they're snooty ballers, spending most of their time at beauty parlors 
 But never would I infringe the West or mend and press 
 Or pinch your breast, 'cause I been fresh in every way 
 And I'll singe my flesh if I ever betray 
 So read 'em and weep and make the coin sweep 
 Busdriver, mastered the freedom of speech 
 I'll never be beneath, the mean streets
