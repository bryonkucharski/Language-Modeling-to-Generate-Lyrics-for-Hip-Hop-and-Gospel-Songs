I gotta act like David Ruffin 
 'Cause y'all be softer than Egg McMuffins 
 Plus you're never really saying nothing 
 You don't admit to any claim jumping 
 This is why I have to pay these munchkins to 
 Clobber goons in locker rooms with waterballons 
 And sashay with gumption 
 The heir apparent of the feral lads in American Apparel ads 
 Rises from the glow of the back-lit keys 
 The html formatted speak'n'spell door magnet 
 Looks futuristic and Japanese 
 But my onomonopoetic Somalia surname 
 Makes me look four-legged like I got fur, fangs 
 And a diamond encrusted gun butt in my mud hut 
 You've hyphenated my dance reprise yet still... 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 And I ain't got legible handwriting 
 How the fuck you talk with a cockney patois 
 When you come from the Rockies have thawed 
 Plus you got all our parties back logged 
 When we left everybody slack-jawed 
 I'm aware you step softly on padded paw 
 But I know you gave your acorns to gay porn from the waveform 
 Of your raunchy rap slaw 
 The oxymoronic tinged band of Guatemalan twins 
 Isn't worth opening my polka dot lids 
 The water-resistant faux-hawk gets road blocked 
 By the color copies of my MOCA pop quiz 
 But my circuit-bent key tar and icky lens cameraman 
 The fact that I'm on the shitty end of this ampersand 
 Makes me what to do the Roger Rabbit in a bomber jacket 
 To the polyrhythm of the soda pop fizz 'cause still 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 Me, I do the wop with no dance license 
 And I ain't got legible handwriting 
 So y'all can't bite 
 Show them shoes a bit 
 Prick those chubby digits 
 Show them shoes a bit 
 Prick those chubby digits 
 Salvaged from the mouths of motors 
 Plucked from legislative branches 
 To enact these native dances 
 Sooth me babbling 
 I'm shell shocked by the blaring red phone 
 Name checked on the sterling headstone 
 How can I sell this high-top fade? 
 Oh wee, throw the grappling hook
