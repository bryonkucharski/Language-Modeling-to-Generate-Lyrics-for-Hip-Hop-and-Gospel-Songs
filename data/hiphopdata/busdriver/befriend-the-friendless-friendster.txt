Let's make friends 
 And not refer to rap monikers and astronomers 
 And be fun-loving 
 I'll give you roses, about one dozen 
 Everyone one at this party is so dumb and aloof 
 But you pry open closed minds like a sunroof 
 And you're interplanetary 
 And they're hindered while you're candid and carefree 
 Your impression of that political figure was done with cynical vigor 
 And it was so fucking funny 
 You're a conduit of impromptu skits 
 If your karma's bad 
 You need to disrobe 
 That armor-clad xenophobe that resides in your innards 
 Before you die and wither 
 Your inner playground's full of cobwebs 
 But I'll help you reach that obtainable godhead 
 Through Tai Chi stretching 
 And improvised rapping 
 So what if the posh are wed to the idea 
 That we're bastardized and crossbred? 
 They can't hint the live acts' whim 
 Or synthesize the vaccine 
 They await the star's hardened prick 
 And his guitar pick made of arsenic 
 But my sardonic wit goes far beyond it 
 Let's forget the rock star ethos 
 And go to the underground celebrity roast 
 And make some friends 
 And forsake the trends 
 We'll throw rocks at tanks 
 Erase the programs 
 Leave the robots blank 
 And curb spending habits 
 Through serendipity 
 Let's make friends 
 Is it all ages or 21 and over? 
 Because Miss Honey Bun is older than a pre-teen TV screen 
 I suggest let's run with the sun at our shoulders 
 I have money in my gun holster 
 And several drink tickets 
 But by the end of our interaction 
 You'll probably think I need to pay a shrink a visit 
 Because tonight I'll treat you like girl meat 
 Dressed in a sesame seed bun 
 Asking you and your homegirl if you're interested in a threesome 
 But I'm out of line 
 Because you're an under-sexed lady cop 
 But you rubbernecked when I came in the spot 
 I gave you enough respect or maybe not 
 You're the cashier at Wal-Mart kissing the traveling man 
 I'll give you a papsmear a la carte 
 In our 15-passenger van at my show 
 The ephemeral girlfriend with extra baby fat 
 Courted by the LA megalomaniac 
 And you're much more friendly than the rats I know 
 I tried to foster a newfound love that a kiss led to 
 Oh how I misread you 
 And I just tried to be the downest homie 
 But our friendship was short-lived you weren't supportive 
 And saw I had a speech impediment like Pork Pig 
 But to say we can't be friends is not so 
 We can go to a hip-hop show and join arms 
 In unison at the soy farm
