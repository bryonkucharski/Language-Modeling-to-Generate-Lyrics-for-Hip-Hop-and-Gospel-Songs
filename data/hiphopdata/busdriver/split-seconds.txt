Be real, conscious rap failed us 
 I didn't say that 
 You know, welcome to my rap jam 
 The top-hatted Abrahams are shoveling the raisin bran 
 In eyeballs their bi-laws are leaping off the laser scan 
 Into your genotype telling you to deepthroat that pipe 
 If you don't do it well 
 These hoes might 
 The red carpenter's quota fills the deficit in motor skills 
 Of on-lookers raw sugars register at overkill 
 Within your colon wall so a candied bowling ball 
 You squeeze out at the open call 
 But what if you could 
 Inundate the open hearing with your shrewd barbs 
 That perforates the sloganeering on the cue cards 
 Would you prize that fine cut or just apply blush 
 As besquelched sea-kelp nibbling on pie crust 
 The job offers at Albany's count Dracula 
 And calorie-count spatula kitchen staff 
 Are on the lithograph 
 Of your Calvin Kline alkaline-enriched gonads 
 Should I kiss your ass or drown you 
 In the saffron soy dip 
 But my Zaxxon joy stick pokes at my 
 Glitter spackled jump suit 
 Mr. Applewhite grunt pukes 
 From the candle light-drunk seldom sung tooth 
 But you're the fresh faced unknown 
 With sophomoric gags and washboard abs 
 Finding cinaplex waste blood stones 
 Can I be OG Mud Bone? 
 Go free and unplug the phone 
 Nannies or swamis undefeated 
 Screaming "Pansy commies! Love it or leave it" 
 Or pumping antibodies in the VP's cleavage 
 They split it, split it... 
 Nannies or swamis undefeated 
 Screaming "Pansy commies! Love it or leave it" 
 Or pumping antibodies in the VP's cleavage 
 They split it, split it... 
 Cool points trump those DIY Numerics 
 Be yourself but I'm too embarrassed 
 You got to be you 
 So that famed crook playbook and diary diarrhea split seconds 
 Split seconds, they split seconds, split seconds... 
 The 1-800 dollar guilt trip 
 Stamped on my African name book 
 Proves that behind the cumulus blue 
 There's a humilicious stew as 
 Dane Cook's table reads, so I yank butch's anal beads 
 Out of the clenched bum of PG rated test runs 
 Stuffing YouTube viewership up deviated septum's 
 Between two choose your pick: 
 Rule Zimbabwe or 
 Improved computer chips become your new Yahweh 
 Boo-hoo loser bitch your dopes in the blood and stole 
 Because most rap careers mirror stints as drug mules 
 But you are the pickaninny, blackfaced Ren & Stimpy 
 Our on-screen time is split 50-50 
 But I've only drawn guns 
 On construction paper with the pastel sticks 
 And I'm a left of center loyalist 
 Who's selling bean pies with a bad sales pitch 
 This sex offender's foil fixed in utero 
 On my own dumb ass self 
 Yeah I pimp super ho 
 Whom is me 
 They liken Driver to Fish Bone 
 Have fire and brimstone misers disowned 
 But I'm not sure 
 Y'all are too NAACP or NWA on GP 
 But I straddle the fence every nanosec 
 Canceled checks line the uteral wall of my music hall 
 Cool points trump those DIY numerics 
 Be yourself, but I'm too embarrassed 
 You got to be you 
 So that famed crook playbook and diary diarrhea split seconds 
 Split seconds, they split seconds, split seconds...
