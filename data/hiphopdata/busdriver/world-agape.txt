Whoo! 
 Art rap, art rap, art rap, art rap! 
 Whoo! 
 Who better qualified to mediate in the larp discord 
 With my dewy moleskin brewing cauldron and karmic orb 
 I'm fully pantsless like the wooly mammoth from the tar pit gorge 
 Yet I'm David Carradine taking thorazine off the starship oars 
 No godhead in the blog thread stringing this harpsichord 
 No tasteful tunes, just tablespoons of parsnip porridge 
 Of the bleeded ether from the Greenpeacer's alarmist lore 
 I'm dashing and windblown 
 When the world's agape 
 And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings 
 I'm dashing and windblown 
 When the world's agape 
 Drop orange rind on the war crime set in the crowded ballot 
 With my in-laws and Limbaugh singing a power ballad 
 Their price gouging funds their night outings and flowered phallice 
 More than spider bites we give them writer's strikes and an endowed outage 
 The ulcer gargle and dulcimer drone are character-driven 
 Like the "no sir" art show, sulfur marble and American women 
 This bonus disk shows my showmanship and parenting acumen 
 I'm dashing and windblown 
 When the world's agape 
 And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings 
 I'm dashing and windblown 
 When the world's agape 
 Oh what to do 
 Oh what to do when the world we service is a whirling dervish 
 And my sidekick aids his surly cervix he's burly and girlish 
 And I'm Isaac Hayes on a gurney in Zurich saying 
 "Man up puss! Right now!" 
 We're telling kids 
 "Oh yes, you can't" 
 I'm rushed to hair and make-up on the war-torn beachfront 
 Where I narrate stuff like a foreign-born creampuff 
 But I forewarn the teen pups that their core's worn and pre-shrunk 
 Then in poor form, I triple lutz and I land on my gristle hump 
 But really 
 I'm into spooning and spoonerisms 
 And I make a splash like my hands are two-thirds fish fin 
 Because when I talk it's like nuclear fission yet it resonates 
 Like a Ferris Bueller ditch party 
 Apply the oil-slick sheen of the Blue Man Group 
 Eat Soylent Green by the two-hand scoop 
 When you see my face at the newsstand booth 
 With plutonium in his thermos 
 I got Obi-Wan discharged 
 With my phony gun and lip service 
 I earned the large gift card 
 To stir up the stern class kings and nurture the saplings 
 I earn medals dirt-pedal with the facial hair of Burt Reynolds 
 Burnt kettles on my turntables 
 Make sheet music leak coolant 
 When I speak to it
