Busdriver: 
 I did that record before you 
 And sure of course it was a tour de force 
 Now you can afford a Porsche 
 Go to the Source awards 
 Get some tour support 
 Do all sorts of warped things 
 Get a smorgasbord 
 With a horde of whores 
 Snort some more 
 Leave a horrid corpse 
 You're so corporate endorsed that when I record a chorus 
 You said you co-wrote the grand corpus 
 With no ifs, ands, or buts 
 To listen to derivative works of this art-fag 
 I need to be in arms reach of a barf bag 
 Using a bland sci-fi lab kit 
 No fan's hands will go sky-high for that shit 
 It's too anti-climactic 
 I'll put my bad reviews on your happy shoes 
 Abstract Rude: 
 Derivative of creative initiative 
 Uninhibited in no particular fashion 
 Indicative of an atypical mic-smashing 
 Considered the title class of the fiercest survivalist 
 Paralyzing psychoanalyst 
 Magnetizing soul catalyst 
 Out of a cocoon 
 A platoon would form and how did it happen 
 Sprouting like alfalfa poison mushrooms out of the grass 
 Boys to men of this vast network of allies 
 That were sent to the rally point for the joint venture 
 Henchmen with a long-standing friendship 
 Based on both surviving a lynching 
 From those striving against them 
 Rise to any length 
 Spread through every width, area, and circumference 
 It's a heavy load to lift but I was never known to quit nothing 
 I use a dolly, pulley, lever, conveyer belt 
 On the assembly line where all of the steel melts 
 I weld them a chopper 
 Tap on a chakra to get 'em back in order 
 And mail them a document to tell 'em retreat back over the border for his aura's sake 
 To make more, innovate, and record a great album 
 For our styling cipher out for the Driver 
 I'm a clocker 
 As much of an actor as Mekhi Phifer's a rhymer 
 Busdriver and Abstract Rude: 
 We've mapped your psyche 
 We know what you do before you do 
 Packaged it nicely and sold it to who feeds off the style 
 Ellay Khule: 
 You couldn't break my chops with an axe 
 Take you time, make it fat, talking shit, take it back 
 Mad when you kick that crap 
 Weak wack raps, where the real writers at? 
 Over here, over there, everywhere that I peep 
 Follow the elite, every style that I freak 
 Beat a nigga down when I bound to a beat 
 Microphone's parts what they found in the street 
 Pick 'em up, dust, kick it up, time to rip it up 
 Having fun with my tongue, when I'm done, give it up 
 Time to demonstrate how I penetrate 
 Hot incinerate, biting like a dinner date 
 It's a twist that I missed, what part of the game is this? 
 Where the losers go and the winners wait 
 To take the beginner's place, keep my face placed on how to win the race 
 If they'd run, I would never chase 
 Hit 'em with the boom because they set up base 
 This ain't Texas but this the west's Chainsaw Leather Face 
 Keep the golden mic in a leather case 
 When it's battle time, I'm a set a pace 
 Every line that you find, already been mine 
 When you rhyme, man, what a waste 
 You would think I'd busted a nut in every hip-hop slut because there's too many Mini-Me's 
 And some of y'all cats is finicky 
 So y'all quickly change to enemies 
 Blowing up in the industry so they remember me in their memory for original chops 
 So you better give spiritual props to your lyrical pops 
 Speed seeds, I delivered a flock 
 Busdriver, Ellay Khule, and Ab Rude 
 A few Goodlife emcees on the prowl 
 They get beat up every time they want to eat up and try to feed up on my style
