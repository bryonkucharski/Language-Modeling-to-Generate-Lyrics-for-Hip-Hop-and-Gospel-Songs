I frown upon the media blitzkrieg 
 When the sephia tint bleeds out of your sleezy club striptease 
 You give the cheesy club chick feed 
 Your reality TV stud misreads his scripted pig oinks 
 So I disjoint his measly thug prestige 
 When my wheezing lung is squeezed 
 Out of the pitiful entrapments of an able bodied squatter 
 I spew frothy fodder 
 From the tenuous underpinnings of a corroded mind 
 I can't learn a thing 
 Yet my creative furnishings are a body of water 
 So I'm a coffee potter 
 Yes I'm a barista at starbucks 
 You can lessen my financial woes 
 Just swipe your visa card once 
 Buy this explosive whoopee cushion 
 My loathsome pussyfooting should be put in 
 Runs with a pizza parlor runts want of arcade tokens 
 Join the styled fauna of the industry mixer and suffer mild trauma 
 I need a chemistry kit sir 
 And not to coddle pistol grips I only need one popsicle stick 
 For my boyz 'n' the hood diorama 
 Oh my band sucks shit 
 Were not first on no bills 
 We play sand buckets 
 And eat birth control pills 
 And my fingertips look like crisp fried ends 
 I go off 
 Diss my friends 
 Looking at the negative balance on my account through a fish eyed lens 
 You get some tap shoes and snorkles and bandmates 
 And sheet music with trombones and handguns 
 Unsafe sextet 
 We upstage the best yet and tongue bathe cassette decks 
 Holding unpaid rent checks 
 You get some piccolos and cutlery and thermoses 
 And fashionistas with jumpsuits and congos 
 And what do you got 
 Unsafe sextet 
 Gilded hearts of booklovers 
 And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra 
 After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler 
 In the regalia of a star prick I measure our genitalia with a yardstick 
 And dethrone my third person drowning it in sea foam 
 And drink the blood from its wing nub dipping in it with cheese scone 
 Exchanging pelvic thrusts while pulling the elephant tusk from my cheekbone 
 Put my dirty feet in a pair of socks and my bird beak in a swear box 
 And unfasten my pants 
 Insure that my mojo crash lands on your happenstance 
 You're a flash in the pan 
 Quid pro quo with the newest thing to come out 
 With me its no go I'm a shooting range cut out 
 But my woodie's blair underwooden, you should book me with wonder women 
 I ain't go the suggested footwear but the kids leave the breakfast nook bare 
 When I prep fixins I'm hedging clipping their reading habits at the book fair 
 But I'm too pithy and far fetched to compete with your hickeyed guitar neck 
 I hear the political convictions of your depbut EP dwarf isclamfascism 
 Great news! you get rave reviews 5 out of 5 
 But this'll leave your noodle full blown this year were touring funeral homes 
 And that self serving agenda will buckle under the weight of these lengthy diatribes 
 And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra 
 After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler 
 Oh your games so tough, it de magnetized my key card 
 It's so hot and fresh, your merch booth needs a sneeze guard 
 And I fall off without a tug on the ripchord 
 I amount to fuzz of the mixboard 
 But how can I get my game re-charged, tell me. 
 Oh gilded hearts of booklovers 
 You don't have to be careful let your hinged airhole swing ajar 
 We have disemboldened the cookie cutters 
 Who the fuck do they think they are 
 Oh compromised worldview 
 Please don't mind me as I kindly scratch my scabs 
 Our nerve endings curly q 
 When brushed up against the naps of flags 
 Or that fascist vag. or that
