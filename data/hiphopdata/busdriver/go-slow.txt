Go slow, fall like shadows 
 Perfect shapeless shape shifter 
 Earth, it glows 
 Heart is sowing 
 Galaxy awaits you; gate swung open 
 Go slow, fall like shadows 
 Perfect, shapeless shape shifter 
 You should hold those splintered bones 
 Spare your exhausted glands 
 Go slow, trace breath 
 Leap into these large unpromised hands 
 Mutter those Ginsberg poems 
 Cool those worn hooves 
 Go slow, face your death 
 Walk into the fiery orange woods 
 Go slow, fall like shadows 
 Perfect, shapeless shape shifter 
 Earth, it glows 
 Heart is sowing 
 Galaxy awaits you; gate swung open 
 Go slow, fall like shadows 
 Perfect, shapeless shape shifter
