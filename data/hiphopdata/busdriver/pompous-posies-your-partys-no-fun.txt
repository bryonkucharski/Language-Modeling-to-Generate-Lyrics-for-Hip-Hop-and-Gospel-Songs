This year I thought I'd do away with celebrity-endorsed barbarism 
 And to keep the people guessing get a bio-diesel engine 
 To cut my carbon emissions 
 Further my career by trading favors with aged ravers 
 You know, use the barter system 
 But I sat on my black ass sucking on sassafras 
 In my apartment bitching 
 Last year you were posing on the hood of a Lamborghini 
 In Gucci glasses and a tan bikini 
 Dating Meg White, eating tiramisu 
 I was rapping at a test site, banned from TV 
 And in therapy too 
 For pulling firearms out of Jell-O molds 
 With a sinister grin the color mellow gold 
 Running from the Southland PD 
 Pompous posies your party's no fun 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Though you've made millions off us 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 This year we're getting off our butts 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Mutherfucker 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 ... 
 This year I thought I'd cover you 
 With a thicket of wet unwarranted smooches 
 Rather than entertain sore feelings at board meetings 
 With these corporate mooches 
 Or being run over by un-sober law enforcement douches 
 It's sensible that I'm a randy-romper, 
 A panty-dropper with these whorish pooches 
 Last year I was passing out Green Party leaflets 
 When you're at the chalet on ski-trips 
 Getting neo-cons all peeved and miffed 
 Heaving and choking on beef-bits 
 'Cause I ain't appeasing shit 
 Wearing tutus and a Bluetooth in a Subaru 
 Yeah you too 
 Can get your knees split, bitch 
 Pompous posies your party's no fun 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Though you've made millions off us 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 This year we're getting off our butts 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Mutherfucker 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Last year they made buoys out of bloated bodies in the Big Easy 
 And nobody liked what the 
 Blowed embodied yet they bit freely 
 Rappers used recording booths 
 Like porti-potties being inexplicably cheesy 
 And I'm an out of work hobo 
 At the Mojave with a dripping squeegee 
 This year I'm going to make only one friend 
 This squatter girl at the opium den 
 Checking her viral load, wearing a bridal robe 
 Fresh off her codeine-drug bend 
 'Cause f@#$ them pop divas 
 They need pitch shifters and Brita pitchers 
 Full of mixed liquor, I'm a clit piercer 
 Of that bitch nigga that manages you 
 Pompous posies your party's no fun 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Though you've made millions off us 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 This year we're getting off our butts 
 Yeah whooptie-do 
 Mutherfucker 
 Yeah whooptie-do
