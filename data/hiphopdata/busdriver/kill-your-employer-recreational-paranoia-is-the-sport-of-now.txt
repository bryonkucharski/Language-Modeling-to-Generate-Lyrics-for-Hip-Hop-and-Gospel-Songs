With long armpit hair 
 Sticking out like a sore thumb, smelling like dinosaur dung 
 These hippies are holier than thou at poorly attended peace marches holding cold veggie dogs 
 I'm not your homie or pen pal though I unload ink cartridges as Red State demigods 
 Cause smearing a salad on a SUV can't 
 Save the black faces at the refugee camp 
 There is your sterling Sputnik 
 To compliment your unfurling drug fix 
 You've been hoodwinked the secret brotherhood winks as your heroes push it with a 
 Branded buttocks 
 Now he's an action-pose doll 
 Clad in the latest fashion faux-pas 
 Just another rapping know-it-all trying to de-politicize those big business ties 
 Let me guess, you're a macrobiotic cuisine prep-cook 
 With a text book liberal outlook in an oppressed nook 
 Couch surfing, but your dad's got employment history at Halliburton 
 While you dress like wild mermen 
 'Cause recreational paranoia 
 Is the sport of now, so 
 Kill your employer 
 'Cause recreational paranoia 
 Is the sport of now, so 
 Kill your employer 
 Riddled with neo-expressionism omitted words and arty erasure 
 You pass out your Green Party favor 
 Smoking on cush-hash algae at the Bush-bash rally 
 Mocking army brigade verve 
 Bar-b-qing sorts of meat substitutes 
 Arguing at your bleak study group 
 Shunning pop art in your turtle-neck 
 Shopping carts with turbo jets 
 Write Red Cross personal checks 
 Yet no relief monies are en route 
 You exchange wistful ki-bi-bos while they prep the missile silos 
 And Ill fortify the Left's patron saint 
 With anti-war cries and face paint 
 When the GOP appoints a man in tights to read protestors their Miranda rights 
 This is an anger pact, a teen scratch post 
 That boast a paperback zine pathos 
 'Unsheathe the saber' says thee blasphemer's acting coach 
 And torment the Scientologist at the Cineplex 
 They are bonafide clansmen in dinner dress 
 Giving your art loft undertows the thumb and nose 
 'Cause recreational paranoia 
 Is the sport of now, so 
 Kill your employer 
 'Cause recreational paranoia 
 Is the sport of now, so 
 Kill your employer 
 I don't join the ranks of ordinary men, uh-huh 
 I burn flags not oil reserves, uh-huh 
 I'm no ex-football player Iraqi combatant, uh-huh 
 Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, uh-huh 
 I don't join the ranks of ordinary men, uh-huh 
 I burn flags not oil reserves, uh-huh 
 I'm no ex-football player Iraqi combatant, uh-huh 
 Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, uh-huh 
 It's me fucker, uh-huh 
 It's me
