The water retention in the bogged down pickled ear 
 Outweighs the REM in one-eyed pistoleers 
 Oscillating lung sacs, cheek-pinching fun facts 
 Coloring the grosses in the fiscal year 
 I've never been a shoe-in just the gluten in the monkey bread 
 Sucked up in the union turn my dues in with the monthly pledge 
 Breaking the Rosetta Stone, shouting on the megaphone 
 I turn a burning bush into a monkey hedge 
 They're looking for a minion of idle hands to instruct 
 And I'm the battery-powered deflowered nimbus 
 Set aside my prized glum in gentrified fiefdom 
 I street perform in peak form with a tin cup 
 Please lift the sanctions that demonize the yellow cake 
 On your tongue the water-gun is pointed at your elbow brace 
 Baby safe the bumper cars, broadcast the color bars 
 As I tie you to the railroad stakes 
 When I overrule all of the nutritional facts 
 I can scale walls 
 Get your shit flushed when I bit-crush the Britannica 
 And unveil drawls 
 When I overrule all of the nutritional facts 
 I can scale walls 
 Get your shit flushed when I bit-crush the Britannica 
 And unveil drawls 
 They wanted a Moulin Rouge and some bullion cubes 
 But we jettisoned all that by the megaton 
 Now they've got their Oolong brews and their futon stools 
 And a reticent sun 
 So I'm turning on the waterworks 
 Cutting through the modern murk 
 Knee-deep in a pot of dirt 
 To render handfuls of sky 
 Turning on the water works 
 Shunned where founding fathers lurk 
 Knee-deep in a pot of dirt 
 To render handfuls of sky 
 Cowering in firefights 
 Stepping over fly-by-nights 
 Contrary to prior plights 
 I render handfuls of sky 
 The mounting momentum of the bubbling electorate 
 Favors neo-Nazism in the house pet chorus 
 Throw the medicine ball, divvy up the windfall 
 Fit the trophy wife for the wet corset 
 I go from a hug to an open-handed cartwheel 
 That's how I vivisect the dinner guest at the arms deal 
 Breathing with a suck slurp, I scrutinize the bloodwork 
 Of the green thinkers and no cars yield 
 Pointing out all the freckles on the darkroom negs 
 To carbon date a marketplace full of bootlegs 
 Bottle zygote nog, for all the roadhogs 
 Matching in, white, blue, red 
 You cannot triangulate the angles of this paragon 
 You are not a G at all, you work at a hair salon 
 When you raise the hot comb, I will move to Stockholm 
 Till the soil to put a parish on 
 When I do away with questionable motherfuckers 
 I can outsource sorcery 
 They wanted a Moulin Rouge and some bullion cubes 
 But we jettisoned all that by the megaton 
 Now they've got their Oolong brews and their MoveOn dot orgs 
 (Hey, go!) x3 
 So I'm turning on the waterworks 
 Cutting through the modern murk 
 Knee-deep in a pot of dirt 
 To render handfuls of sky 
 Turning on the water works 
 Shunned where founding fathers lurk 
 Knee-deep in a pot of dirt 
 To render handfuls of sky 
 Cowering in firefights 
 Stepping over fly-by-nights 
 Contrary to prior plights 
 I render handfuls of sky
