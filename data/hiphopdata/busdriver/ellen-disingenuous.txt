I've got a series of beefs and cues from the bemused (funk-tory?) 
 Riding emus in a halter tee 
 She's chasing her Ps and Qs for the shimmying dollar tree 
 My defused metabolic key 
 It's not a stud and muffins 
 Or be-speckled and blaxploited 
 I begrudged an onion 
 Holding teakettles like asteroid bits 
 There's no way I'd date her 
 Acting like an eighth-grader 
 I should have my face lasered 
 I was putting a wad of genetic material 
 Into every other jelly bag 
 When you exit wasted 
 Pirouetting on the helipad 
 The sound of bank mergers for the underpaid workers 
 And the frankfurters in deadly hands 
 So her tentacles look just like a purple mollusk 
 My dissension is imminent and parabolic 
 Many of the sexes are fixed in prelims 
 Dimples with candy tips and a landing strip 
 And like an X-Mas tree trimmed 
 And I'm serving a person burger speaking against a third term 
 With my parasol ripped 
 Look at those meaty thighs - must be CGI'd 
 Who else goes to career day with a "B" word seismographed 
 With a marshmallow suit made of fiberglass 
 And a nametag saying "No one should ask" 
 A token black typecast in my (?) 
 I should probably set up a resized JPEG 
 Of my Wienerschnitzel hut, instead 
 I sell her an ad for a defried page head 
 Now I'm too fickle, my heart's peanut brittle 
 And if it don't amount to the findings in the Concord 
 I should be spiking the punch bowl 
 To make these hussies more cooperative 
 Her name is (name is, name is, name name name name name...) 
 Ellen Disingenuous 
 She's of the best ilk 
 Her sexy breast milk's 
 So good 
 It's so strenuous 
 To make Neo-feminism palatable 
 Ellen Disingenuous 
 She's screen-tested 
 So you know 
 You see her pink flesh delving the void 
 It's so strenuous 
 To make her grand bisexuality work 
 For every uncle with a Terabithia jaunt 
 When I wear my trivial ankh 
 To chaperone your lovely Milk Duds 
 My credit build-ups 
 Our committee is swamped 
 And the druggie's pill cup 
 But I lunge at her with a sponge loofah 
 And a cannon-powered (?) bazooka 
 You're an incubator built for a young pupa 
 But I mishandled the money shot 
 It's tantric and pampered 
 A big (?) at your scrunchy spa 
 You're a man-eater 
 When you get to nibble on your bloody spot 
 Turn on my lights into a telenovela 
 I'm a helluva fella 
 With a profile (?) like (?) uranium 
 What's your name again 
 What's your name again 
 What's your name... 
 I've had my fill 
 Of the (?) with the bone density of (?) 
 Full-bodied chicken strips 
 I am like "tsk tsk." 
 I could paint a strip 
 Of your home pregnancy test royal blue 
 Tesla coil fuse blew 
 You (?) 
 In a seafood stew 
 And be (?) 
 Plus I saw Calvin Klein and David Newsmaker 
 My figurative outline issued their induced labor 
 P-funk She-Hulk 
 Fitted a shoegazer for a box of bits 
 And hunted pit bulls as foster kids 
 Oh why did this (?) 
 And (?) 
 (?) On the bicycle 
 For a (?) acquittal 
 But her respect's ballin' 
 I'm crestfallen... what's your name again? 
 Oh yeah it's 
 Ellen Disingenuous 
 She's of the best ilk 
 Her sexy breast milk's 
 So good 
 It's so strenuous 
 To make Neo-feminism palatable 
 Ellen Disingenuous 
 She's screen-tested 
 So you know 
 You see her pink flesh delving the void 
 It's so strenuous 
 To make her grand bisexuality work
