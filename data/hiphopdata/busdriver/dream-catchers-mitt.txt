I fall from the dream-catcher's mitt 
 I'm all thumbs 
 And not what she's after 
 My smoldering remains burn over glowing embers 
 As you ready and position short-term goal tenders 
 I lay un-kissed at the summer jams 
 A bag of ruptured glands 
 Who lacks reasoning to understand 
 My self-directed hate fits 
 We mouth the vilest sacrament 
 And adhere to these tacit skirmishes 
 All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched 
 We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes 
 This soft science leaves my body under whelmed 
 Our ambitious union dissolved out of the color film 
 And I am just a crude outline 
 Obscured and pegged and numbered 
 Dangling from power lines 
 One of many discarded ex-lovers 
 Throwing pet food from the red carpet 
 At de-colorized coupling of heart-shapes 
 And all the panic-stricken flower maidens 
 Update their 'who to hate' list 
 My journal entries are irony-laden 
 And tirelessly self-loathing 
 We mouth the vilest sacrament 
 And adhere to these tacit skirmishes 
 All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched 
 We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes 
 Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt, 
 Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt... 
 We've mouthed the vilest sacrament 
 I fell from the dream-catchers mitt 
 With spooky incantations and dead language motifs 
 Their defected army become my rogue fleet 
 Sequestering yahoo, superimposes his frail person
