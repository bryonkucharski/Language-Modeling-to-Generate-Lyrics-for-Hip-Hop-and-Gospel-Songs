I told her I'd step outside of myself for her 
 Driver 
 You got that 
 You're much better when you're high 
 Uh, nap in a serpent's lair 
 You got that perfect hair from a German heir 
 She thought I was better when I was less me 
 It's her 
 You know her 
 This is when she'll think I'm at my very best 
 This is when she'll rub up on my hairy chest 
 She'll think that I'm better than I really am 
 I go really ham, swing off the ceiling fan 
 Pundits think I'm partisan when I'm indifferent 
 Cuties think they fine china when they chipped dishes 
 The border agents think I'm shady when I'm cranky tho 
 Exes think I'm dating hoes I'm buying baby clothes 
 My lady got me gone off that cup of tea 
 And now them silly pawns they don't govern me 
 Now 
 My lady got me gone 
 My lady got me gone gone gone 
 My lady got me gone gone gone 
 My lady got me gone gone gone 
 Damn 
 It's her 
 You know her 
 She's mine 
 School tuition costs about a bus token 
 The rap game is permanently stuck open 
 I will spend most of my time insulting people 
 I will claim that all of us are multilingual 
 Man I can figure skate so I break ice 
 Up on the interstate I jack knife 
 I don't think that I can lift a metric ton 
 But I think that I'll run into the setting sun 
 I get to be the nigga for a nano sec 
 Yeah 
 I can do the right thing the wrong way 
 I can peel all the stressors from a long day 
 She loves me like she means it 
 She loves me like she means it 
 She loves me like she means it 
 She loves me like she means it 
 Don't cheat 
 She loves me like she means it 
 She loves me like she means it 
 She loves me like she means it 
 Don't cheat 
 It's her 
 That's my girl 
 My CD thinks I'm picky when I'm spot on 
 I get credit for songs I'm not on 
 The beauty standards don't start at hot blondes 
 There is no way I am not on 
 My decision making is compromised 
 I can paint the autumn skies canvas wallet size 
 Hellfyre Club is my go to 
 You like me cause there's nothing that I won't do 
 King cookie face 
 Can you tell it's me? 
 Can you tell it's me? 
 When I'm king cookie faced 
 Can you tell it's me? 
 Hellfyre Club 
 Can you tell it's me?
