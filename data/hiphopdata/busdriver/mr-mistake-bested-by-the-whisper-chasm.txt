Wielding racy aphorisms I Billy club your color line 
 Refusing to join forces with your indie-stud wunderkind 
 I rather embrace what your city slum undermines 
 And encourage the idiom bump-and-grind 
 Sickly glum of unbuttoned minds 
 I prime my condemned shell to excrete 
 A lithium honey wine for you frowning f#$%s 
 When trend arbitrators present my tortured lore adorned 
 Gags are soaked in chloroform 
 You get the same if you're poor in form 
 With your flip full-tuck and triple-lutz into this icy brook 
 War is sworn on my forlorned psyche's soot 
 (Chorus) I've got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make, 
 How can you believe that I'm not a waste of space, 
 Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face 
 But how can I speak your language 
 When I don't know my own 
 I've got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make, 
 Your eroded innards are my favorite place, 
 Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face 
 How can I speak your language? 
 How can I speak your language? 
 Too self-assured to ever treat her well 
 (Kiss the off-colored tree frog) 
 We turn into black Kebler elves 
 Opposite elephants on sea-saws 
 Android man-boy befriends the chic, mod tinker bell 
 Then runs away from home until my knees throb, 
 Sneakers smell 
 Till my every tirade activates Jihad sleeper-cells 
 Till flag wavers say, 'please God we need your help' 
 Still I'm precarious and flat-footed 
 Like you're arrogant at a gun show 
 I holler at your Marilyn Monroe 
 With declarative mumbo-jumbo my narrative unfolds 
 To a housed narcissism 
 Parented by a bum hole 
 I cling to pointless ventures 
 And inveigh buoyant pest verve 
 I suck 
 (Chorus) I've got people to disappoint, 
 I've got mistakes to make, 
 How can you believe that I'm not a waste of space, 
 I'm sorry to disappoint 
 I seldom save face 
 But how can I speak your language 
 When I don't know my own 
 I got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make, 
 Your eroded innards are my favorite place, 
 Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face 
 How can I speak your language? 
 How can I speak your language? 
 It's unfitting but I stay all pensive and meek 
 In cities where girls dress Greek 
 And food's too expensive to eat 
 And niggas gangbang on Sesame Street 
 I got too many requests to meet 
 I got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make, 
 How can you believe that I'm not a waste of space, 
 Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face 
 But how can I speak your language 
 When I don't know my own 
 I got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make, 
 Your eroded innards are my favorite place, 
 Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face 
 How can I speak your language? 
 How can I speak your language?
