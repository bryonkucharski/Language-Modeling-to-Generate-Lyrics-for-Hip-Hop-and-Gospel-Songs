Hi my name's Scoliosis Jones 
 I've got a comb over coif and a smoker's cough 
 I'm into motorcross and am a Planet Z3 colonist 
 And a self-taught anesthesiologist 
 I've got a corn ethanol powered copter pack 
 For slow nights I'm in old type in almanacs 
 My bandmates act like tasteful Swedes 
 With tweezed brows they seed clouds with dreidels and beads 
 So I gnaw on the nozzles for syrupy opiates 
 When the political climate is clearly Soviet 
 But my crackpot persona's an eerie cozy fit 
 When I cackle at the throws of the hedge maze 
 I used to stab niggers with quarter notes 
 And treat royalty statements like horoscopes 
 But my wonderland's been deforested and poached 
 And my groin gets bombarded with x-rays 
 I'm Scoliosis Jones 
 "We all laugh at your expense", fuck you then 
 Full of broken bones "Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense" 
 In the headliner's Buck Rodgers seating wing 
 There's always blood in the toddler's teething ring 
 He needs legitimized conceit, cocaine nasal spray, 
 Splayed cable bays to liquefy the heath 
 His persona; assistants wear go-go boots and every vocal booth 
 Must have a glory hole 
 He's fellated by a roster of vapid poodles and eats apple strudels 
 Wearing a portly stole 
 A crass pipsqueek all slathed in bronzer 
 Picking out the pig's feet in the fattening curd cobbler 
 Flossing and stuff because he thinks we care 
 He signed a ten album deal with a pinky swear 
 Popular opinion's burgeoning gulf leans 
 To it's concerning his golf swing 
 My cardigan reeks in partisan pink 
 Because I'm Barton Fink in the Martian sphinx 
 I'm Scoliosis Jones 
 "We all laugh at your expense", fuck you then 
 Full of broken bones "Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense" 
 Pole vaulting over the exalted sultan of urban music 
 Because he's Nova Scotian 
 I am the script clinic for the post-millennial slacker biopic 
 Your pitch is impish full of skullduggery and slice of life dull cutlery 
 Twirl and flail around the motor fire and foreign policy deodorizer 
 I am the script clinic for the post-millennial slacker biopic 
 I'm Scoliosis Jones 
 "We all laugh at your expense", fuck you then 
 Full of broken bones "Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense" 
 I 
 I 
 I'm Scoliosis- 
 I'm Scoliosis Jones 
 "We all laugh at your expense", fuck you then 
 Full of broken bones "Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense"
