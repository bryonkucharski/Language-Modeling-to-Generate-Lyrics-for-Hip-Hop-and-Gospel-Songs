Me and you in love with our 
 Rule over solid waste 
 Our artistic merit is questionable 
 We'll fall on our face 
 And I can't bare the sight 
 Not to sound pragmatic 
 But our parents were right 
 This ain't adequate 
 But you can always seek refuge under... 
 Sunshowers 
 There's a place for you, not no place for me under... 
 Sunshowers 
 Return to the bourgeoisie while I sift through debris 
 You view the poverty line as a threshold 
 For truth in pricey slums 
 This ain't art school, it's a shark pool 
 Of well-groomed yuppie scum 
 And they got orders to kill 
 Watch them fashion your cell 
 How'd they get a recording deal 
 When they're wack as hell 
 But the chicken-scratch in your sketch book 
 It mirrors what you loath 
 Sunshowers 
 There's a place for you, not no place for me under... 
 Sunshowers 
 Sunshowers 
 There's a place for you, not no place for me under... 
 Sunshowers 
 They got easels to stain, and uh 
 People to blame, with their 
 Egos inflamed, and their 
 Neat codenames 
 I saw your sub-genre in a passing glance 
 It was you and your DJ in matching pants 
 Sleeping pills and record sleeves 
 Defaced museum pieces 
 Concert-goers flailing arms 
 Taxidermy for the nouveau riche 
 I don't need this 
 I don't need this... 
 Sunshowers 
 There's a place for you, not no place for me under... 
 Sunshowers 
 Sunshowers 
 I don't need this, I don't need this 
 Sunshowers
