I am the first black astronaut 
 To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon 
 I am the first black astronaut 
 To walk the bare moon... (Or possibly, one of the great all-time bus-drivers.) 
 It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers 
 But our African medallions are handicap placards. 
 I am alphabetized in the "modernized retro" 
 And my press photos are wallet sized. My rent's low. 
 Why don't you shape me? I'm malleable flesh and putty 
 and a salad bowl with ??? dressing 
 and assimilated into urban fuel testing 
 Dress and doggy are coveted by a sexy bunny 
 afraid I'll add her to my burlesque show. 
 Who's slipping the ring finger of the lead singer ??? fresh bowl. 
 All the bitches rule with bee stingers but I'm refreshed though. 
 It's home of the black speed reader. 
 Perplexed or blurb stretched 
 Dude suggests that I'm spacy but the bird's nest is low. 
 Which means I'm commonplace. 
 Til the boy and me traveled the country in wooden spaceships 
 On the phone cursing at de-booking agents. 
 I wield words and pilfer the country with the underground who's-who 
 But I feel like I've been sodomized with a billiards pool cue. 
 I am the first black astronaut 
 To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon. 
 Pound my beliefs into the desired shape 
 And put them sound asleep in the fireplace.

 It's the return of the all popular dope rappers 
 Who retreat through holes in the sky, climbing up rope-ladders 
 And I will sell you a silver disc soaked in laughter, 
 Cause you've been brainwashed. Out of your ears leaks soap lather 
 Why don't you deify me? I'm Buckaroo Banzai. 
 Don't know what to do, I'm the wrong guy. 
 I touch crews like Krush Groove on DVD 
 And I kinda started doing songs with CVE? 
 But now you're like (Chillin' Villain who? Project what?) 
 Persona Non Grata with the wrist-band in front of Popsicle stick man. 
 He's a wall of hot lava. Drip crayons on your clipped glands. 
 So I found the top dollar. Twist trends to enrich fans. 
 But there's not a lotta offers that give grants to kitsch bands. 
 And I water lawns for the ADD D&D role-players 
 And we got along, so we formed a commonwealth 
 And you hear me through random sightings and file-sharing 
 And you tell me that song writing's like child bearing 
 No it's not, it's self indulgence 
 Elven culprits watch their egos melt in charcoal pits.

 Oh my. Sorry I left my acceptance speech in the back of the private car 
 And I re-wrote the Hollywood ending, fluxed the motion-picture screen 
 Made it so the black guy doesn't die by the opening scene.

 Yeah! This is the climate of cathartic writer 
 That enables whos-who in the market they lifer. 
 I've been out-sold and my styles are old and lame 
 I'll spark a lighter to the carpet fiber 'cause I'm not a household name. 
 I'm a tax write-off, I signed a deal with no exit clause. 
 My label's like Ms. Santa Clause on menopause, so I'm banging on padded walls. 
 So I'm trying to make hits, but I keep hitting pop flies 
 I don't eat out any more, I'm thawing chicken pot pies 
 But I used to be in the list of the top five 
 Fresh hip-hop guys.
