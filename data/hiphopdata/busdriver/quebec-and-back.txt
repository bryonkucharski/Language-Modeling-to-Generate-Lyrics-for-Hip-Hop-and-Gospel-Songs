We've mined calculated sleaze 
 For countless fortnights, for this forthright 
 Canny canning 
 So we plead for what you can't believe 
 And career suicide, poolside 
 By the candied landing

 At the hands of deputized beauticians 
 This hundred pound torso broils 
 In the Gap ads and plastic slag of New Britain

 Cradling political asylum 
 Green room signee! In piss-colored gold 
 Spooning chef salads onto cartoonists' cleft palettes 
 You'll be detuned and dyed peach to hit the mother load 
 But this is what you'll die from 
 "Go into the Canadian consulate like..."
