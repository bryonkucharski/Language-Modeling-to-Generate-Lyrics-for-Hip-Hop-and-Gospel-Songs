Buy my posthumous full-length 
 My colorfully packaged disembodied shriek 
 Converted to ring tones used in car ads 
 Sung by winged gnomes over the head of Dick Clark 
 Cover pages graced by the chiseled hard abs 
 Of this now charred slab of dead pop diva 
 Recreated as the head of Biz Mark 
 Spliced on top of Hello Kitty 
 On a virtual land mass with a hip-kink 
 It's lip-synched to my song and committed to telecine 
 And the nothing left of me is left to bask in a camera flash 
 I've never been so successful till I died 
 And my label wished my heavenly chariot 
 Pre-board defunct 
 I didn't die in a hail of gunfire 
 I died doing extreme sports at a resort 
 On a bungee cord on a ski jump 
 No need to ask how a dead rapper can be a label's cash cow 
 They just record me months before on G-funk string chords 
 Add an R&B chorus 
 Hit a keyboard key to punch 
 Even though I'm dead 
 I was booked on a fortnight 
 To exhaust notes dressed like a cockroach 
 Now I'm cooked and ate with a fork and knife 
 As your reheated pop sensation 
 I'm framed under a caption reading "Prog-rap" 
 And given open-handed god smacks 
 By a partisan zealots who not only think I draft-dodged Iraq 
 But that my back catalog is wack 
 And for it I should be flogged and smacked 
 But little do they know I'm dead already 
 And their complaints are small and petty 
 My autopsy was broadcast and shot on a web cam 
 I'm a dead man with golden blood in my bed pan 
 But still my pop song climbs 
 And you can buy it when you shop on-line 
 Prop my lifeless body up next to the podium as I except applause 
 I'm an award-winning dead dude 
 With a tour pending and a celebrity love interest 
 I signed a movie deal to play the starring role 
 The film crew doesn't even suspect I'm dead 
 I'm your own martyr 
 I'm dead but don't unplug my phone charger
