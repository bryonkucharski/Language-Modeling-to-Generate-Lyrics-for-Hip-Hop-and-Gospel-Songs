Y'all want to see tits and ass, 
 Street grit and sass 
 As beatniks smoking grass on holiday 
 -You know what we want- 
 You're looking for a grievance to mask, preferably with a fetus in the trash 
 While you eat quiche and laugh on the Champs-Elysee 
 -You know what we want- 
 I'm not down with that B-list staff, 
 As they yell out Jesus at mass 
 I'll be laughing while I knead this mish-mash of pottery clay 
 -You know what we want- 
 An appropriated grease-slick slab, posted up as a meat stick add 
 But I make the average moviegoer too seasick and sad 
 -You know what we want- 
 And I'm too caustic to run, for office or be expunged 
 For my agnostic plunge 
 -You know what we want- 
 So what I've accomplish and done, is viewed as an off-setted pun 
 By the posh and young tastemakers 
 -You know what we want- 
 An overdone tame premise, 
 I jump from the plane wreckage 
 Unscathed yet sunbathed in the rigors of a bass pluck 
 -You know what we want- 
 Pop culture's lame vestiges, I'm an ordained pessimist 
 With hippie-qualms and 
 Sticky bombs to deter the tank-truck 
 I'm good for a belly laugh 
 Covered in a blanket of ash 
 Leaving with an ankle cast 
 But sometimes I feel that... 
 I don't have what you want 
 So won't you accept my humble offerings 
 Broken TV sets as ethereal driftwood 
 When you're on the plane alive with water wings 
 You'll think,'I didn't know surrendering felt this good' 
 I don't have what you want 
 So won't you accept my humble offerings 
 They want semantics and sniveling 
 Grams to sniff on a triple-beam 
 To be hand-picked for a little scene 
 In a student film 
 All I have is pamphlets full of liberal zing 
 Antihistamines in a syringe-sling 
 A shanty for this fitted king 
 Of uprooted elm 
 And they've been given solar-powered cars 
 Trail mix and power bars 
 Upturned tarot cards 
 They want to be heralded by wishful teens 
 In stretch-Hummers and limousines 
 They're beyond medicinal means 
 -You know what we want- 
 But I gave them a protagonist 
 The color of cinnamon and mahogany 
 Filtered through award-winning cinematography 
 And the motherf#$%ing discography of a G 
 If you don't like it then kick rocks 
 I'm pre-history's disc-jock 
 Yeah, I know what you wanted homie 
 But I never had the s#$t in-stock 
 I don't have what you want 
 So won't you accept my humble offerings 
 Broken TV sets as ethereal driftwood 
 When you're on the plane alive with water wings 
 You'll think, 
 'I didn't know surrendering felt this good' 
 I don't have what you want 
 So won't you accept my humble offerings...
