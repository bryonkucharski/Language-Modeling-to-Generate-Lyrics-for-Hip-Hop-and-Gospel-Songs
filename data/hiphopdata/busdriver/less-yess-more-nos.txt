Less Yes's, more No's, and less Yes's, More No's and less Yes's... 
 A studio audience's general anesthesia itch 
 Remedied by "chop sui generis" the seminal sleeper hit 
 From this tag-banger doppelganger 
 Turned a non-partisan anti-hero 
 And the sneaker fits 
 I'm undeniably left-leaning others got cold feet 
 It's because they're breast-feeding 
 On this golden teat (of an old elite) 
 This synthetic mammary gland 
 Of a pop-cult nurse aid in a birdcage 
 Which is actually an Iraqi oil drum 
 Mistaken as the divine mother by daddy's spoiled son 
 That's why you die in high numbers 
 For this populous Texan and his innocuous yes-men 
 You're a compliant spyhunter 
 Fresh dried-blood globules on dog tags 
 Are like scarlet opals 
 Exchanged for fossil fuels 
 So I charge rigged voting poles 
 'Cause the day's autumn hues lie 
 On a garbage boats on shoals 
 And an estranged god rules 
 Urging soccer mom's to want to carpet bomb 
 A peace rally on your campus quad 
 Watch as an Islamic phantom god 
 Is slain by a movie star 
 In a red, white and blue unitard 
 On a Fox news sister station, 
 On cue insipid patrons soft-shoe 
 We refuse the ruling class in broadcast antennae headdresses 
 With more no's and less yes's 
 Recon in war zones is your certain death sentence 
 So we need more no's and less yes's 
 I'll unzip the sky and reveal 
 The inner-workings that are hidden 
 With more no's and less yes's 
 More no's and less yes's 
 More no's and less yes's 
 Every feather a boarding pass 
 For the fluorescent shuttle soaring past 
 Forged from remnants of a former me 
 A hollow bulb that died of the common cold 
 And you lack the language to appraise 
 What was my fleshy housing due to my 
 Wild fling with the art scene underbelly 
 I, a style king toiled over a volley of 
 Ideas and scrutinized today's news 
 But I've now been reduced to super-sized plates of food 
 And even this supposed headspace 
 That hemorrhages with a carbonated fizz 
 Is auctioned off for bargain rated bids 
 A sugary glaze is applied to every 
 Unfertilized seedling that my dementia approves 
 Every aroused spoof 
 Now childproof 
 Every emphatic 'no' 
 Now an ambivalent 'yes' 
 As you know they're arbitrarily assigned an Axis of Evil 
 But it can't be remedied by my on-campus free show 
 I would hyper-extend this Californian cactus needle 
 To snag rifle straps and also stab vinyl stacks 
 But it's used to inject botox in the cheeks of big-face bills 
 And I with chipped paint in my gills 
 Know that elected official and lobbyist have hid waste spills 
 And also misplaced kills 
 But in the face of that neo-con Nazi 
 I am no Noam Chomsky 
 I'm a nagging teen in baggy jeans 
 Who fixates on frills as bombs drop free 
 Yes we're embalmed zombies 
 Getting all s#%tfaced as interest-rates build on defense shares 
 But no homie, I'll die voicing my grievances 
 Give the bronze urn of this naysayer 
 To the modern-day Quaker 
 The long-term of your slave labor 
 Has been discontinued 
 This quick-tongue ginsus right-wing filibusters 
 We refuse the ruling class in broadcast antennae headdresses 
 With more no's and less yes's 
 Recon in war zones in your certain death sentence 
 So we need more no's and less yes's 
 I'll unzip the sky and reveal the inner-working that are hidden 
 With more no's and less yes's 
 More no's and less yes's 
 More no's and less yes's
