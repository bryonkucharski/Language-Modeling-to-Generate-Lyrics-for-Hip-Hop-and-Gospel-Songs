This self-made mogul alpha-male 
 Now seeks a Dali-lama 
 To become a cocooned darling larva 
 I'll donate my album sales 
 To what the left-wing stance is, 
 The pet peeves of the candidates 
 And wet reeds in their tan lips, 
 Exceeds the bandwidth 
 The self-empowered blogsters, and all you apathetic scenesters 
 From this downward-dogger 
 Newly flowered songbird 
 But I used to drive my stretch Humvee 
 Through rap fads like an occupied Baghdad 
 Looking like a pet monkey 
 In a one-piece holding a handbag 
 Now I'm stylized in your art commune 
 Torturing a TV host, 
 Holding a weenie-roast over car-bombed ruins 
 Choking on a tapioca ball 
 In being a sun-drenched life-size Yoda doll 
 Obsequious banter is protocol (new skin) 
 Admonished, I withstand the office day singed 
 Then become counter-culture's misanthropic statesman 
 Take wives with a chest full of animal hair, 
 Put their vulvas on pre-heat 
 Then have an extra-marital affair at the yoga retreat 
 I'm a wheatgrass fueled, rehashed, eco-friendly hippie freak 
 Encased in what's aesthetically pleasing 
 Marvel at the LA-based, dead artifice 
 We are all coated in a plastic film 
 But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin 
 There lies a layer of secret skin 
 Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants 
 There lies a thick layer of secret skin 
 A body for you to re-begin 
 'Please give to this undisclosed relief fund' 
 Says the liberal with a tealeaf on his tongue 
 'Cause soldiers are pointing their BB guns at children's TB lungs 
 So we've sanctioned graffiti fun to slander your figurehead 
 Hack into amalgamated algorithms that open cells in crowded prisons 
 But I got to get that 'save-the-world-look' first 
 Under that thin veneer, there is a buried sun 
 An aptly engineered new planetarium 
 Working class 
 Heroism 
 Is stylish 
 All season 
 Sleeveless shirts 
 Quinoa 
 Drum circles 
 Palm-reading 
 We are all coated in a plastic film 
 But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin 
 There lies a layer of secret skin 
 Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants 
 There lies a thick layer of secret skin 
 A body for you to re-begin 
 We are all coated in a plastic film 
 But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin 
 There lies a layer of secret skin 
 Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants 
 There lies a thick layer of secret skin 
 A body for you to re-begin 
 Under that thin veneer, there is a buried sun 
 An aptly engineered new planetarium
