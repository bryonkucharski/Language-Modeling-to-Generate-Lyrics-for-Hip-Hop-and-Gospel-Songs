I'm unknown 
 Like the comic 
 Green fatigues chronic 
 Drive is masonic 
 Onslaught is conic 
 Rap producers colic 
 Vampires get garlic 
 George got the Jack 
 While Uncle Jimmy be thinking rather pure gin when drinking 
 Lime away from dry wall 
 All fall, defense is too tall 
 Jones for the beats, flip my loop through the LFO 
 I say tomato, you pronounce it optimo 
 Let's call the whole thing on 
 Is it a joint, blunt, shotgun, bowl or bong? 
 Quite frankly I'm still beneath the table 
 Doom drank me under 
 What God has joined together 
 Let no man put asunder 
 Escape, pillage, and plunder 
 Bloops, bleeps and blunders 
 And I wonder who's loving you 
 (Like Michael Jackson) 
 Death comes in threes like John Paxson
