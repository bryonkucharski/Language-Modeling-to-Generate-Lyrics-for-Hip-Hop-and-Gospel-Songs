Posses no peer, fight fear with beer 
 Jeers make dough, it might back scratch it back at ya 
 In this life some niggas ain't gon' like you 
 Don't feed the mouth that bites you 
 Blunt with a swag weed when it's dro or cigarette load 
 Buy one and get one, five packs more economical 
 Even though they stay yo, Wajeed in the D 
 31 years of life, these the songs in the same key 
 G, I relate, see the point kings I live 
 Midwest All-Stars continue mark writin' 
 Like ODP and EST original stylin', that's why (I'm a) 
 Get my Jerry Curl on before I cut my braids off 
 And the same damn thing, say they scratched his face off 
 Sound like that red and yellow activator, make my shit stay soft 
 Dope on a 40 oz., or more like a keg 
 Not beat, just chubs 
 Spit this ..., tap beats rock clubs 
 Conversatin', conversin', what I'm sayin' 
 Is conversation is my occupation I'm employee of the month 
 But with not notified, enjoy my food fried 
 Enjoy my hair fried, some say that's a slave mentality, I'm like, word?
