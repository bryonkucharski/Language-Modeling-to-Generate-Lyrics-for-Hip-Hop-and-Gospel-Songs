Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling 
 Calling for you and for me; 
 See, on the portals he's waiting and watching 
 Watching for you and for me 
 Come home, come home; 
 Ye who are weary come home; 
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling 
 Calling, O sinner, come home! 
 Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing 
 Passing from you and from me; 
 Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming 
 Coming for you and for me 
 Come home, come home; 
 Ye who are weary come home; 
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling 
 Calling, O sinner, come home!
