Out the dungeon of brain-pain I came, 
 With the sell-a-lot plot from the megawatt mainframe. 
 With a suit made of electricity, 
 I ran through the Great Wall of China convincingly. 
 That was after the world tour, 
 When I traveled through gravel and battled matter at the Earth's core 
 I did the show on a fireball, a pioneer 
 Ran into the jungle and jetted wearing a lion's ear. 
 I fought fear with the hammer Thor lent me, 
 And tangled with the angel of death for four centuries. 
 Put a name plate on the astroid belt 
 And I ran through the future with a android's help, 
 That's when civilians were made of metal, 
 I received a coronation 'cause I had the last flower petal. 
 My powers settled a clash between races 
 And put good people on the magazine faces. 
 Substituted television scandals for elephants and pandas, 
 Tell 'em it's the elegant commando. 
 With a hand so big I punched a Sphynx in the nose 
 And the nose decomposed and so the story goes. 
 I slaped a 40-o out of a young man's hand 
 And fed him lessons of life to formulate a plan. 
 I wore the prime meridian as a wristband 
 And gave away my riches but I still remained a rich man. 
 The quicksand I withstood for good 
 As I hopped a dragonfly to outer space and met Count Bass...
