It's all trash talk 
 He glad that the force in the flex 
 His rhymes in one hand, gross beats in the next 
 Then he spit 
 I heard somebody say everything things been said 
 It ain't just been said by everybody 
 Take the Mickey out of rap, it sound a hot mess... 
 Juxtapose, the empress new nose 
 Martin Luther King ain't had to drive through no number 2 
 Don't discriminate 'cause she works at Mickey Ds 
 Free from the scene if the bread back was on a grilled cheese 
 Trippin' off the Brasilian Landin' Strip 
 Tell Vicky, not to snitch on a hickey 
 Keep a secret for once 
 The check come for lunch, we all get duntz 
 Now that's what I call lyrics 
 Volume six dip flipped to a knockout after peepin' in Pirate Tips 
 This time like the whiners, to a bitch 
 She took my weakness for kindness 
 My vices for niceness 
 It's like zoroastrianism 
 Shut up bit my bones, if he don't speakin' then he won't feel ya 
 Now step outside you ain't tryna get filled 
 Resurrect the god of chivalry yet 
 He the type the beef when rejected on a night cap 
 Pound of prevention, bushel of cure 
 He puzzled while she sensitive in mad demure 
 She got the right to choose, 'cept to choose 
 To walk the streets full of hot air 
 Auto blustery her ears have lust for me 
 She read like a willow 
 Activate it one day, or smell like my pillow 
 Catch boo get with night crawl in a minnow 
 Typical political path to president... 
 Huh 
 Should of called them, they beats is three stacks less 
 Who knows? 
 Maybe they do shows for checks with 2 zeros 
 The honorable MF DOOM teaches us this is a no-no 
 Another bad bad creation 
 With Dallas saucer, then vro-vro 
 A musician with more work than mojo 
 I'm risin' like Andre 3000 
 The flames of this mansion location Substantiate 
 Huh, Count Bass bitch
