My spot is full blown 
 Count Bass musical placement woofers is not included 
 Musicians only 
 Rappers bore me 
 Producers owe me 
 Beat makers annoy me 
 Jury still out 'bout the best spitter behind the boards 
 Please believe that I'm the rapper with the most chords 
 Casio CZ-101 head honcho 
 Started rainin' chords so I took off my poncho 
 Don't sleep on the beats though 
 Feel the kicks homie, Shock G told me 
 Be careful what you wish for 
 Inhibitions is piss poor 
 Oh no, ryan head to Stockholm 
 Alchemy on the balcony 
 Mutiny on the Bounty 
 Beats fresh and daily made 
 Tims light grey and suede 
 Equinox, forward, tailor made 
 We just say, oh no like yo knowin' 
 Stones Throw is in a show flow low dough 
 My peeps don't allow me, to perform for free 
 They say "yes sir" but they still ain't seein' me 
 P-h-a-r-c-y-d-e, J-S-w-i-f-t 
 Hold ya head baby paw and get ya money 
 "Till they face these fears in these fear Zones"
