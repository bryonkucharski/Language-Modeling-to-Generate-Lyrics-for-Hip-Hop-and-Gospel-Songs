One, one, one, one, yeah 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 The tax on my shoes cost more than ya clothes 
 I'm lookin' for beats, while y'all lookin' for hoes 
 Am I opposed to that practice? Never 
 But I'm a Fender Rhodes scholar 
 Studio musician not a studio gangsta 
 I entice with mic and beat devices, while y'all niggas 
 Giving clerks the beat list, driving up the record prices 
 The main reason for you pre-life crisis 
 Is the fact that y'all ain't first with the facts of who the nicest 
 I do drugs, I'm the nigga that bugs 
 A.K.A. Count Bass, 32 length, and 32 waist 
 Nothin' but talent up top money 
 That's what you get from me 
 A ill rhyme and a quality beat 
 Solid, production is my function 
 Whether sober, or stoned, drunk 
 I got the funk, for walkmans and trunks 
 For wild niggas and punks 
 For weed fiends that spark 
 It's traditional rap music created in the park 
 It's like that and, that and, that, that, that 
 That, that, that, that, that, that, and 
 It's like on, on, on, on, on 
 Ayo, Orville Redenbacher got the dopest microwave popcorn 
 Uh, it's like that and we out 
 Me and Pocket up in here in Murphysboro, peace
