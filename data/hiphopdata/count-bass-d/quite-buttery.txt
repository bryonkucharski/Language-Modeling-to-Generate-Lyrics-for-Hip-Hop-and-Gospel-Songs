It's been a long time 
 True indeed 
 Congratulations to the Count and the Countess on the new seed 
 It's a blessin', you're messin' with a real pro 
 Flow is a heel, the beat is a steel toe 
 Give 'em what they feel to put they hands up real slow 
 Out in the streets this be the roll ass Cee-Lo 
 Knew he 'bout to blow ever since hearing Beno 
 Villain known to flip scripts like Tarantino 
 MCs need Aveeno 
 OK the fun's over 
 One time, while I give the track a once over... 
 Word, quite buttery 
 Number one answer, did I st-st-stutter G? 
 It's all ugly, they found a new discovery 
 Brand new spankin' way to G off lovely 
 Not unlike off a high noon drugee 
 Who on the moon in the fly new dune buggie? 
 Bass D, is this thing on? 
 Any thing we do, never on no sing song 
 Always from the heart no matter who got no bling on 
 DOOM keep it movin' back and forth like ping-pong 
 It's so strong and linger on 
 Leave 'em itchy like the index finger the trigger on 
 Go on, get your swig on 
 Before he bring the liquor out, just make sure the nigga gone
