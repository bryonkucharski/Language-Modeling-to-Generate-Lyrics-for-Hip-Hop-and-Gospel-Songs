 Do you want my love? (Not really) 
 T-Boz tried to talk to me (Well that's all right) 
 "Stop lying!" 
 You don't have to believe me (Do you want my love?) 
 It may have been a big mistake (Well that's all right) 
 And if it was my heart will break (Do you want my love?) 
 I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me (Well that's all right) 
 "Yeah I ain't bullshittin!" 
 You don't have to believe me (Do you want my love?) 
 It may have been a big mistake (Well that's all right) 
 And if it was my heart will break

 So have you ever heard of a group called TLC? 
 With hits "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg" and "Baby Baby Baby" 
 New Year's Day of 1992 
 I was chillin' with the Leaders of the New 
 At the Fox Theater Venue 
 Atlanta, Georgia - where the girls don't ignore ya 
 Geronimo had TWO girls, and said, "This one's for ya" 
 The two were close related in fact sister kidren 
 And I was scheamin on a way to get her into bed 
 1992 and I was rhymin for fun 
 Had the thickest new style -- but no demo done 
 I wasn't feelin' down about my past situation 
 I had only seen TLC, on Video Vibrations 
 Yes, this is just before they blew up 
 While I was gamin on the girl I had a chance to look up 
 TLC walked in for my man Yusef 
 Left Eye is her name 'cause she played me (to the left) 
 The girl I was with was silly, so was ... 
 But I was tryin' to get on T-Boz any motherfuckin way 
 But what was I to say? Hey sheeyit, I was a nobody 
 And nobody had ever heard of Count Bass-D 
 Or TLC, but my despair turned into glee 
 When T-Boz pushed up and introduced herself to me 
 My heart went mushy, I know you don't believe me 
 But T-Boz, of TLC, tried to talk to me 
 (Bass-D: singing) 
 Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me 
 "Stop lying!" 
 Heh, you don't have to believe me 
 It may have been a big mistake 
 And if it was my heart will break 
 I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me 
 "Yeah I ain't bullshittin!" 
 You don't have to believe me 
 It may have been a big mistake 
 And if it was my heart will break 
 (Count Bass-D) 
 Huh, yeah, I saw you on TV last week 
 'Ello T-Boz, my name is Count Bass-D 
 I was thinkin' last week, while I was watchin your video clip 
 Than when I got rich I had to kiss your lips 
 That's how I wanted to step, but I had my doubts 
 About her findin out, about my lack of clout 
 I guess she saw me with the Leaders and assumed I had a record deal 
 But I was mesmerized with her sex appeal 
 Rumors ran free, that she loved Jodeci 
 Who gives a FUCK about K-Ci, he's just as skinny as me! 
 Heh, don't get me wrong at singing songs nobody's better 
 But +I Get Around+ like 2Pac and chain letters 
 But this time, I simped though, got played like a wimp though 
 The Pharcyde said it fly, she kept +Passin' Me By+ 
 Not even ?Meryl Stuben? could have been more friendly 
 Huh, T-Boz tried to talk me yo... 
 (Bass-D: singing) 
 Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me 
 "Stop lying!" 
 You don't have to believe me 
 It may have been a big mistake 
 And if it was my heart will break 
 I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me (word) 
 "Yeah I ain't bullshittin!" 
 You don't have to believe me 
 It may have been a big mistake 
 And if it was my heart will break 
 (Count Bass-D) 
 Last time y'all, uh 
 Females only step to niggaz once in a while 
 And you should react, if she seems worthwhile 
 T-Boz was a goddess, I'm honest, I wouldn't to lie to ya 
 But I procrastinated like a paper overdue 
 I know you're sayin', "He's just a crumb, he couldn't get none" 
 But T-Boz was a female who was full of sincerity 
 I know it sounds hard to believe 
 And I could give a FUCK if you believe 
 But T-Boz tried to talk to me 
 (Bass-D: singing) 
 (Do you want my love?) 
 Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me (Well that's all right) 
 "Stop lying!" 
 You don't have to believe me (Do you want my love?) 
 It may have been a big mistake (Well that's all right) 
 And if it was my heart will break (Do you want my love?) 
 I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me (Well that's all right) 
 "Yeah I ain't bullshittin!" 
 You don't have to believe me (Do you want my love?) 
 It may have been a big mistake (Well that's all right) 
 And if it was my heart will break 
 Mistake.
