Lester Young was on the tip of his tongue 
 When he said, Dizzy Gillespie, played the trumpet 
 When I see a bass, I thump it, then I'm done wit it 
 I see a Grey Goose in the sky 
 You see Smirnoff Ice 
 I'm thrice as nice! 
 Black box through my beat box, I'm set for life 
 Rap music is beneath me 
 But any rapper who meets me never sees me 
 Cocky or stocky 
 No Rocky, just Balboa cause you slowa 
 And there's no hummers among us 
 No one can thug us says the 51st psalm 
 I'm not worried about that little light of yours 
 I'm just studyin' this little light of mines 
 You got ya mind where the sun don't shine
