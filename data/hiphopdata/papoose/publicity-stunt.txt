You coulda caught him on the back street and semi'd him up 
 But you caught him on front street really to front 
 What type of reputation do you idiots want 
 Stop pullin them publicity stunts (reputation) 
 You really wanna leave your enemies slumped 
 Or you pullin a publicity stunt (reputation) 
 You gonna be drinkin' out my henessy cup 
 When I pour it for the niggas who ain't here 
 Publicity stunt 
 They pullin publicity stunts I hear these niggas 
 They tryin' to sound like me I hear these niggas 
 Yeah I hear these niggas but I don't feel 'em tho 
 Ever violate thugacation I kill 'em slow 
 Yeah we move around with those things, niggas know 
 Ask the streets man I locked it down from the gitty-go 
 Niggas talk bout they looking for us, here we go 
 Go head pop off and get shot like a video 
 I eat food, right now you look like cereal 
 Frosted flakes, rice krispies and cheerios 
 Got all of these rappers walkin' round on they tippy toes 
 I got an illy flow 
 Ima tell you like my niggas in the Bronx say it 
 I get busy mo 
 He claiming he ain't running when I'm letting that semi go 
 I bet you he run when I bag that milly tho 
 I make a nigga haul ass like Aresenio 
 Cop the bottle pop the bottle and let the henny flow 
 I'm feeling kinda windy tho 
 Somebody mustve let the window open 
 There's flies on my thrown 
 Shoo fly shoo the king is now home 
 Roaches crawling on my microphone 
 Mosquitoes they biting my poems 
 Fresh from summer jam I'm back in my zone 
 I'm about to exterminate you clones 
 You telling me you need to blow you deserve to fail 
 People in hell need ice water 
 I come out a thirsty hell 
 They don't believe hard work prevail 
 They rather start controversy 'cause they say controversy sells 
 That's the reason 60 niggas is locked in 30 cells 
 Making 10 dollars a week they working jail 
 Bloodshed erupts when controversies fail 
 So easy to dig a grave the earth is frail 
 Count dirty money so I keep dirty nails 
 No evidence don't leave a dirty trail 
 They like a bunch of crabs in a barrel when they see one leavin' 
 They pull him back down 'cause none of 'em wanna see him 
 Rise to the top they feel like he gonna leave em 
 So they gotta stop 'em from achieving 
 Rappers fighting over the summer but the summer's just a season 
 I stand for a cause and go to war for a reason 
 Wise maneuvers 'cause I grew up on the block with shooters 
 I don't bow down to no man I'm not a Buddhist 
 You looking for an opportunity to stop the truest 
 I won't give you an opportunity you opportunist 
 Tote crazy calico's and proper ruggers 
 Cock pop you losers 
 Back out betsy and put one in her head 
 You gonna lose your life pa 
 'Cause my bullets stay in betsy like a life guard 
 Put one in betsy head 
 Hit all y'all niggas up 
 'Cause my bullets stay in betsy head like swimming trunks 
 My Brownsville niggas feel that 
 They know what's up 
 Call me out and I'm showin up 
 'Cause I run up with the oowhop baby shootout crazy you not crazy duck 
 We pull out 80s move out lady you got shady love 
 That dude got sprayed move y'all ladies dudes out now may be tough 
 But these dudes obey these moves I say they move our way we bust 
 Get through my day I move my yay get moola lately what 
 It's the truth I can't be touched 
 I sit back and roll 2 dutches 'cause my crew got crazy blunts 
 I roll a double dutch like 
 1 my baby 2 my baby jump 
 You gon be drinking out my hennesy cup 
 When I pour it for the niggas who ain't here 
 Publicity stunt
