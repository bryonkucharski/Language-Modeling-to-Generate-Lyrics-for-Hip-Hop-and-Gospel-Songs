Pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto, they call her shorty but she tollin her stiletto 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 Wutchu doin' on the street? 
 You ain't a pimp, she's a kid 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 To all men and women 
 You talkin' or you listenin? You pimpin' or you trickin? 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto 
 I hope this song finds you in good health 
 I got my thinking caps on 
 Whatever happened to that baby from that 2 Pac song? 
 We gotta start where they left off, to move our zone 
 If you won't do the same, you rock wrong 
 She was born in the bathroom, her mama left her in the trashcan 
 Would be dead but she got found by the garbage man 
 Remember her pops who molest er 
 Her moms' name was Brenda 
 Baby girl all alone, she grew up on her own 
 Went from foster home to foster home 
 She keep her fingernails clean, low rider jeans 
 But her low rider jeans ain't low as her self-esteem 
 This happens every day, nobody deserve this 
 She grew up to feel worth less 
 Her parents gambled with her life 
 Evens in all, choose 
 You just witnessed the birth of a prostitute 
 Pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto, they call her shorty but she tollin her stiletto 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 Wutchu doin' on the street? 
 You ain't a pimp, she's a kid 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 To all men and women 
 You talkin' or you listenin? You pimpin' or you trickin? 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto 
 They say it's 2 ways out of the ghetto 
 Either you rappin' or you playin' ball 
 I done heard people say it all 
 Those male dominating ways for a man to prevail 
 But what's the exit for a young female? 
 Either you shippin or you go to school 
 Play dumb when you young and be a older fool 
 Know to choose, the older dudes try to school her every day 
 Her response was well, anyway 
 She rather take the ass titty way 
 They say human experience beats book knowledge every day 
 Somebody help this child, can we pray? 
 'Cause she rather take human experience 
 She see them other prostitutes getting it, now she curious 
 She's locked in the zone 
 With parts of her body getting sold 
 Ain't listen to what the old timers told, call 'em old 
 The only thing worse than getting old 
 Is not getting old, the block's getting cold 
 Pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto, they call her shorty but she tollin her stiletto 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 Wutchu doin' on the street? 
 You ain't a pimp, she's a kid 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 To all men and women 
 You talkin' or you listenin? You pimpin' or you trickin? 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto 
 I hope this song finds you in good health 
 I got my thinking caps on 
 What ever happened to that kid from that Slick Rick song? 
 We gotta start where they left off, to move our zone 
 If you won't do the same, you rock wrong 
 See that once was a little boy, you was misled 
 By another little boy and this is what he said 
 As I quote from a man, you hope me gonna make some cash 
 Robbing old folks to making a dash 
 He was only 17, in a mad man's dream 
 The cops shot him, he survived that, back on the scene 
 Robbery ain't work so he got a new thing 
 He digging in the scene with his gangsta lean 
 We suck the blood out them girls that call him a bloodsucker 
 Ask my opinion, I call him a motherfucker 
 He gambled with his own life, head crack 6 
 You just witnessed the birth of a pimp 
 Pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto, they call her shorty but she tollin her stiletto 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 Wutchu doin' on the street? 
 You ain't a pimp, she's a kid 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 To all men and women 
 You talkin' or you listenin? You pimpin' or you trickin? 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 In the ghetto 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 The pimpin' won't die 
 The pimpin' won't die
