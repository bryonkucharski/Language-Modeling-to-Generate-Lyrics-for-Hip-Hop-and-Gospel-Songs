I asked him he wanted me to hustle up his bail, but he said "no" 
 He just didn't give a damn anymore 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 They would say "bling-bling," if my jewels could talk 
 So you can still see me shining when the room gets dark 
 I'm like Tony Danza, I'll show you who's the boss 
 Teach my worker who's the fiends and who's the narcs 
 It's a lot of niggas out trying to prove they hard 
 Till you hit they cousin up, and make them move they aunt 
 Yo, I would wild out and let the Rug' just spark 
 But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start 
 All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch 
 Bet your money: lose a little, or lose a lot 
 They beat us by one point; yeah, them dudes was sharp 
 But I'm a sore loser, so I had to shoot up the park 
 I wouldn't of robbed your man if the fool was smart 
 But a fool and his money will soon depart 
 Then I went to my crib, went to sleep 'bout four 
 When I woke up, police was at my door, damn... 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Just aired the dice game out, that's the truth, babe 
 'Bout to hit the crib, take a shower, watch a bootleg 
 Glad nothing popped off, got to get the bag out of the crib 
 Goose dropped off, so it can get knocked off 
 Then I got a sharp pain in my chest 
 About knowing I ain't supposed to have it in the place I rest 
 Yes - but it's a half a joint in there 
 Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there 
 Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple 
 Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles 
 A man hit me, saying that he'd be here in a minute 
 All I've got to do is wrap it, and bring it down to the rented 
 By now, it's a little past five 
 And I'm still trying to roll, could barely open my eyes 
 Next thing I know, she giving me a massage 
 Instead of waking up rich, I woke up to a surprise 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 It goes: "six in the morning, police at my door" 
 At five in the morning, I was up in this broad 
 At four in the morning, we was out the club door 
 A few hours before that, I was getting fresh in the store 
 Now a week before that, I was at the car lot 
 Thinking convertible so I can make the broad drop 
 A half a mill in cash off a three-month run 
 Them rubber bands stacks in ten-G lump sums 
 Police is on our back 'cause we dump guns 
 So when Bird Gang's outside, motherfucker, just run 
 We just dumb, like the hyphy life 
 I told you life was a bitch, not the wifey type 
 Help you get the right bricks, if the price is right 
 Catch you standing on the strip in the icy whites 
 Season of heirs, we in the V switching gears 
 Dropping the top, blowing weed in the air 
 She's showing her ass, and 
 Next think I know, I've got a detective all in my face 
 Asking me all kinds of questions 
 I don't know shit but get my lawyer 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door 
 Six in the morning, police at my door
