 I was raised with them gangstaz 
 In the streets where nothing's promise man 
 People only would respect you when your crazy 
 And slay you a wild child 
 And we rep them streets can you hear me 
 My people gonna talk to you see man 
 Styles: 
 I go to hell if my niggas dead 
 Drinking liquor blowing l's like I'm living in there 
 Matter fact y'all food, I'm the dinner wear 
 And I can't go to heaven I'll be sinning in there 
 Listen up I keep two guns on my hips 
 Gotta few hundred pounds moving on my strip 
 Niggas leave off the block when I'm on my shit 
 Got my hands in my pants and they ain't on my dick 
 Fuck it nigga, keep these guns on safety for what 
 I'm from a place where faces get cut 
 Niggas is taping you up 
 They gonna bring you to a place in the cut 
 Its real dirty then some 730 niggs start breaking you up 
 I wear a mask like it's a masquerade 
 'Cause I got beef with niggas like me that will blast away 
 Listen dog I'm tryna last today 
 So I can see tomorrow, I'm grabbing these hallows to mash away 
 Mcgruff: 
 Kay slay gave me a call say gruff I gotta spot for ya 
 No doubt slay I'm about to make it hot for ya 
 These ain't not thugs they puss 
 Stop fronting like you hard before your mug get pushed 
 Blood gon' gush 
 Fuck up my cheese doodles stain my pelle pelle 
 That 40 cal. turn his six pak belly jelly 
 I hit a nigga how he suppose to get hit 
 I walk up and hit him close 
 This big shit I tote fo'sho gon' get him ghost 
 Fo'sho its no post lord these bullets do know the outcome 
 You know I ain't no pulling through 
 It's a rap, rennels 
 Let me see you talk that same shit when them caps in you 
 Cocksuka, you punk muhfuckers bring the noise 
 The bigger the crowd, the bigger the funeral yeah bring your boys 
 The shit I talk believe I could back it 
 Ain't nothin' sweet got that heat underneath the jacket (faggot) 
 People only respect you when your crazy 
 And slay you a wild child 
 And we rep them streets can you hear me 
 My peoples gonna talk to you see man 
 Jadakiss: 
 Yo since they say lifes a gamble, well fuck it I got bank I'm on the subway tonguing my lawyer I'm like frankin 
 You being a thug wrong 
 If we was in the bullpen I have you standing up on the toilet singing love songs 
 When you go to bust a nigga 
 Always remember never trust a nigga 
 And don't forget to put your gloves on 
 Niggas better hold whatever they making 
 It's getting cold and the weather is breaking 
 Sales is dropping. 10 p.m. cells is locking 
 Drama hour on d-block the jail is rocking 
 Real life family, we ain't gang members, but we still bang niggas 
 And we keep them things with us 
 We both got the 7, but yours is the 45, mines is the 60 
 The color of rice crispy (yeah) 
 So go head with your new born rap 
 Nigga you puss like a new born cat 
 Papoose: 
 Yeah papoose whipping your head boy with the verbal 
 You niggas got rats in your family like a gerbil 
 You ever turn your back on me, I gotta merk you 
 I hit you in your back like I was tryna burp you 
 I go at the track different ways, I'm universal 
 Papoose stay under the track like myrtle 
 Violate you like your p.o. you pass curfew 
 Niggas move slow with the shells just like a turtle 
 I'm robbing niggas who sell weight 
 So on the first you 
 Niggas better tuck in your weight just like a girdle 
 But lately rappers been afraid to face me 
 Real niggas embrace me 
 Don't even talk about gang banging, my homies throw them b's up crazy 
 So on the streets I keep the b with me like jay-z 
 When I pull out the mag you be scared stiff 
 You a snitch, I keep a magnum on me like my dick 
 Sheek louch: 
 Who could believe sheek would have a label up his sleeves 
 Y'all can't breathe 
 Your boy louch a headache pass the aleve 
 I reinvented myself, I change with time 
 Threw a ceo hat on, stepped up my rhyme 
 Its time for this nigga to shine 
 It's been the same pattern here for a minute, imma change the design 
 Nothing change you still walk with me 
 Don't get a fresh buck 50 
 The hammer still tuck to my dickie 
 Still fucking with these bitches, the weed is sticky 
 Still with the same niggas everyday the god is picky 
 And even though I ain't go plat yet 
 Sheek got the hood upside down like a hot wheel track set 
 I spit like I been here 
 Holla at me, you would think I was your father 
 Minus the great chin hair 
 Rich na, but I'll holla back when I get there bitch 
 Black rob: 
 Open your eyes fam this a new chapter 
 Who the fuck you think you kidding y'all know what I came after 
 I'm not your average rapper 
 I'm a nigga holdin' 4, the homie the people gon' stand in back of 
 In battle mode cause the boys in blue 
 Boys and your crew, motherfuckers poisoning you 
 Now I can as far back camp can 
 Before the crack, before new york took the first blast 
 I was, in the one room joint clay ave 
 Off of webster hit past coke and weschester 
 Me and nom took our rhymes and left dexter 
 Hit the streets up none of the loyalty never left us 
 Took your dust up, holla at slay nig wassup 
 Old folks up in the hood still trust us 
 Salmy wilson you playing for real flip the manual 
 Bank saw them and b I can't wait for the tenth annual
