(Feat. Murder Mook) 
 I want everybody to pay real close attention, don't get it twisted, 
 No man can murder Papoose, and I'ma show it, 
 I trade places with dead poets, 
 I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin', 
 'Cause when all of them died, they took apart of me wit them, 
 You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die, 
 You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already took a fall, 
 They shot the side of his car, my name Biggie Smalls, 
 Listen duke, throwin' rappers off a roof, 
 Bullet proof, disappearin' with my troops, 
 In a tinted out lex coup, read my lips I'll finish you, 
 Metaphorically I'm too lyrical, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already took shots, 
 They killed him in Las Vegas, my name Tupac, 
 I ain't a killah but don't trip, 
 Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' rich, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already faced his death, 
 A tricknologist killed him, my name Malcolm X, 
 A eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, 
 Honor before money, loyal till you salute, 
 Take mines I'll take yours, revenge is a must, 
 We ain't land on the hood, the hood landed on us, 
 I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin', 
 'Cause when all of them died, they took apart of me with them, 
 You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die, 
 You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead you dumb, 
 He went back to the essence, my name Big Pun, 
 I grip the fifth, and I'm slippin' the clip, 
 And I'm hittin' the strip, wit the triggas I'm clickin' it, 
 I'm splittin' yo wig wit it, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, the angels took him in the sky, 
 He lost his life in queens, my name Freaky Ty, 
 The life styles of the thugs 'n' the gangstas, 
 Some die like a g, some die wankstas, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already seen a casket, 
 He passed away, my name 'Ol Dirty Bastard, 
 Shame on a nigga who try to get a name on a nigga, 
 Buck wild wit the trigga, 
 And how you gon' try to Kill Papoose, he died before he excel, 
 Lost his life tragically, my name Big L, 
 Listen spark up the backwood, n' pass the crys, 
 Make it quick money grip, or yo ass is hiss, 
 I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin', 
 'Cause when all of them died, they took apart of me wit them, 
 You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die, 
 You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already passed away, 
 He died in queens, my name Jam Master Jay, 
 Peter piper picked pebbles, but Pap rapped rhymes, 
 Y'all cock blockin', I cock nines, 
 Tell me how you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead you stupid, 
 He died as a black panther, my name Huey Newton, 
 We got the constitution the rights to bare arms, 
 Y'all wear clothes, we wear chrons, 
 Tell me how you gon' kill Papoose, he died with a lot of skills, 
 He lost his life in Brooklyn, my name Half a Mil, 
 Some nigga's blood, is some nigga's crip, 
 Some nigga's bid, is some nigga's snitch, 
 How you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead so stop, 
 He died back in the days, my name Scott La Rock, 
 I'm criminal minded, you been lyin', 
 Talkin' bout your jewels you ice less,

 He lost his life tragically, my name Soldier Slim, 
 Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, 
 Bloods keep bangin' for me, crips keep loc'in for me, 
 One in a million like a lea ray charge, 
 Open ya eyes, try to see me you chasin' waterfalls like Left Eye, 
 You can't kill Papoose, when you spit the same shit, 
 You switch 'n' slang quick, I'm Rick James bitch, 
 I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin', 
 'Cause when all of them died, they took apart of me with them, 
 You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die, 
 You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why, 
 You can't murder me.
