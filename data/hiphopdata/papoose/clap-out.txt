I still ride with that street sweeper 
 Rose mo stay with that rose like Wiz Khalifa 
 One of these lames step on my sneakers 
 His pocket rang go something behind his speakers 
 I ain't with all of that talking we could clap it out 
 Chopping in his club man I'm clapping out 
 I still ride with that street sweeper 
 Rose mo stay with that rose like Wiz Khalifa 
 I'm clapping out dry snitches hating on me what they mad about 
 'Cause I bees with the G's and the B's and the C's 
 Never freeze I just breeze through the peace 
 These old G's don't eat no cheese 
 Do it BIG like Nino it seems 
 Enemies with the flees on their knees begging please 
 I just squeeze what they eat where the cabbage at 
 Sure of myself never had a doubt 
 Grab a lame by the chain pull the carrots out 
 I keep the mac cop on roll bullet back blocks in 
 You with a slap bars we can slap it out 
 What's all the bragging about 
 People in the penitentiary where you heading out 
 Your skinny jeans is all tight how you readers gonna fight 
 You be singing all night like Gladis mouth 
 We can shake till you passing out 
 UFC you be tapping out 
 Use a 44 bet better close your vest 
 Expose your face shoot your bozo chest 
 Like Scarface when he came a nolo death 
 Oppose no threat we a polo yes 
 I owe no deaths 'cause my flow so fresh 
 Like so so death when the brat was out 
 I stray not the savage out 
 Got a transporter I can take Travis out 
 You call that a cold game 
 I don't think it's no game 
 'Cause I stay with cocaine never had a drought 
 Papoose no magic wow 
 Reaching the hand pull a rabbit out 
 Cop new course clash him out 
 I be the - trash it out 
 Getting money MJ cashing out 
 Anyone: Michael Jackson, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan 
 Ball lights bolding, tired of recording 
 Man fuck that, I'm out
