You ride the Brooklyn bridge straight off the FD yard 
 Get off in down town now I'm in BK y'all 
 Some people see me and scream thuga 
 Other say, are you Papoose? 
 I say nah, that's my bruda 
 I'm not a joker life is serious as cancer 
 You ask a stupid question 
 I give you a stupid answer 
 New York I was supposed to be the savior 
 Guess I was blinded, couldn't see the haters 
 I been to Big Apple wasn't the sweetest flavor 
 Disagree now, you'll be agreeing later 
 My mama always told me to never eat from strangers 
 Cut my throat they fed me a razor 
 My cousin said goodbye, I appreciate her 
 I never seen her again, Rest in peace Deasha 
 Goodbyes is forever, do me a favour 
 Never say goodbye, say see you later 
 I'm a real artist I could never be a faker 
 The way I serve these dudes I should be a waiter 
 In the studio session I speak it greater 
 More sessions than that new kid on the lakers 
 New York times put Nicky Bars on the cover 
 It read Mr. Untouchable black brother 
 Jimmy Carter called the DEA and sent the men 
 He said he wanna prosecute them so he sentenced them 
 But when Obama said Trevon resembled them 
 Nobody hurried to arrest George Zimmerman 
 It's not black and white it's not a contest 
 It's just wrong and right I wish 'em all the best 
 I wish harm on no man God bless 
 We all gotta see world peace like our test 
 Some of these dudes got alot of goals 
 Get a little high and can't return calls 
 You on fire, use that fire to earn my nigga 
 But you shouldn't use that fire to burn my brain
