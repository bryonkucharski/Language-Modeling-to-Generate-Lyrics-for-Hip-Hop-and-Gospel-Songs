I don't eat no ham 
 With both hands 
 With a toast plan 
 With your Broke fam 
 With your broke man's 
 And he won't ram 
 Ima dope man 
 With a dope plan 
 With a program 
 Throw grams 
 Through the whole land 
 I'm nice when the show scrams 
 Get 'em hype with the flow man's 
 Stick a knife up your glance 
 Got the lights in the roach van 
 While you niggas liven life in the romance 
 You live life like a old man 
 Through the heights give 'em no chance 
 Told you I spent 
 I Was in your girl bra days in your girl shirt menece in your girl car Nice in your girl pants 
 Put ya to sleep like lindsy did lohan 
 Bars Like Rosanne' 
 Strong like Cohnan 
 You a sucker for love like a slow jam 
 Put my foot up your ass and have you shitten slow Jam 
 Niggas say they gangster but I knoe you ain't tht gangster foney 
 Keep it real with niggas you ain't gangster ask my lady homie 
 Franks Like Nathens 
 Getten Em Dip 'em in Bejamins Franklins 
 And I do it so big when I do for the kids I'm like that's so raven 
 Amen 
 Poor the Ceaser face in 
 Fitted hat with the 7-5 Ace in 
 Tryna pat down a thug no hats in the club tryna say I ckant bring my yank in 
 Been nice Since Pastor Basics 
 Straight like teeth after braces 
 I'm supplyin had you buying had you cryinn had you dien why you lien Exaggeration 
 Cop from Me Congradulations 
 My Whip game is that amazing 
 How you think a clock Grip my hands stay on the whip like navagation 
 I got more guns then t.i 
 You better mind your B.i 
 My Stacking Go got a magic flow you a average joe like G.i 
 Allways had a buzz like a bee hive 
 Till I took off my levis 
 Shawty took off her knee Highs 
 Then She Said Mida' Mida' 
 NasaRema 
 A Cowboy like YeeHaa 
 Got hit with the neeneye 
 Ima tell you like drago Rockeem Rocky 4 but apallo he died 
 In the all black trucks with the seats high 
 Niggas Better back up when I speed by 
 Got a better bad chump when you better pass us we ain't never slack up
