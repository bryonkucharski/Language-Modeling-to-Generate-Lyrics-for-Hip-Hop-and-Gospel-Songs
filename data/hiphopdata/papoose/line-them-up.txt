My lyrics is spirits they come to haunt you 
 Premeditated lyricism I'm very thoughtful 
 Niggas put you on you front they goin' off you 
 Gun but your mother my brother they not remorseful 
 The DJ's told me to reason and they support you 
 Outside of that you wack horrible awful 
 The blood's in your lane then you do a walkthrough 
 Outpolled cables and bench they know you don't fool 
 They know my style I burn the tracks 
 They walk in tight ropes, niggas is clowns with all that circus rap 
 Back it out then I jerked the strap 
 'Cause man if everybody a boss where all the workers at 
 They heard a paps since they like frontin' man I confront them 
 Hit 'em with the frontin' leave 'em with a dirty back 
 Once got caught with a burner's scrap 
 Got more priars then richer in imports where my attorney at 
 Go to cali burn a sec that's the same shit that got Chris Rock 
 So I walk around with my burnie mac 
 Niggas sounding like nerds with all that nerdy rap 
 Put 'em to sleep give 'em a dirty nap 
 My getaway cars my everyday car 
 I let the ready blow that means somebody just got shot if you see that caddy go 
 I move around with that cali goal 
 Hit up a whole van full of your people 
 No Mario 
 I told my man he should stop the willin' 
 He went to jail and played crazy 
 Now they got 'em in the top of salon 
 Every case he's now of trial 
 You can't go upstate and play with them pigs 
 That's not like your salad 
 They mad at me 'cause I'm stylin' 
 But damn, I ain't even had my gators on I was crocodiling 
 We caught 'em slipping out of balance 
 But we ain't even shot 'em we just beat 'em up 
 We trying to stop the violence, 
 Your other man he just got a problem 
 He talked about me like a dog, ain't taking personal I was smiling 
 He getting gased up by the gallon 
 Ain't know his phone was on I bar corner him I was growling 
 I ain't say a word I was sallin 
 Next time you talk about somebody make sure your phone ain't pocket dialing 
 I rock a watch with large stones 
 Do it for the love of hip hop like Bob Jones 
 My rhymes memorized y'all read from your phone 
 Nothing but a bunch of dumb niggas with smart phones
