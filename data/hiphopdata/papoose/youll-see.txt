You could catch me at the dice game 
 Making them hoes ace 
 Chilling in Connecticut catch me at Toe's place 
 I move that girl and that bad boy no mace 
 Had 'em fiends looking smoked out with the bone face 
 You ain't a criminal you never caught no case 
 The only case your man never had was a showcase 
 Niggas try to talk to me cocky I cock the A back 
 I empty the clips of them hollows up in your A cap 
 Shawty got a hell of a body I wanna scrape that 
 You know I like a woman with curves just like a race track 
 Jeweler name the price no complains I just pay that 
 You know I like my jewelry rocky no A$AP 
 These sole rats like to stay alive 
 But I was raised in the burrow of Brooklyn 
 When we make 'em die 
 Damn homie you a crazy guy 
 In one hood you a bitch the next you play gangster why 
 They got your name on the papers huh 
 You left niggas for dead I bet you thought you got away but nah 
 We don't let niggas get away with lies 
 So if you ever turn your back on the field you gotta face the style 
 Challenge me you should hate the try 
 Your man corny, but you even cornier like the naked eye 
 Sucker free, no freedom for suckers 
 We lock 'em down under pressure we be keeping them under 
 I eliminate, innovate, illustrate, spit a grave 
 Take his life, give 'em grace, demonstrate, give or take 
 Renovate your living space then create a real estate 
 Then escape with the cake when I scade the interstate 
 Travesty, dinner dates, different skanks getting spanked 
 Stimulate, penetrate, stick the shank in a snake 
 Don't recite renege, rhymes out the lyric bank 
 I don't write rhymes, if I did I bet the pen would break 
 Watch what you insinuate, thuga we initiate 
 Differentiate the dead real from the living fake 
 You can't intimidate me and your whole clique shit 
 Participate, articulate, y'all get erased 
 What you tryin' to indicate I am what you emulate 
 Y'all should commemorate the rhymes I administrate 
 And anticipate the stand in your wake my hands 
 And I bet you can't generate blam nigga plates 
 Regulate, elevate, levitate, renovate 
 Forever hate to speculate, never straight hesitate 
 You procrastinate and exaggerate, I fascinate 
 Eradicate, dick head go masturbate
