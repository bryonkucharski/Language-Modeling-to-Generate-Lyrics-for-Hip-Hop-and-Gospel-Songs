I'm from down the hill 
 The borderline of the stainville 
 It's do or die never ran never will 
 You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you these niggas man, I try you 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you them niggas man, I try you 
 Niggas be straight frontin' 
 I move around with the thing on my waist thugging 
 It's no hate, I don't hate nothing 
 Man I told them they ain't like that 
 And none of them ain't sayin' nothing 
 Man I came out the gate buzzing 
 Never let a nigga stand and my fate bluffing 
 Warrup son, ain't nothing 
 I took so much money in the start 
 Niggas think I'm bank cutting 
 Ayo DJ play something 
 The south cool we be digging they wave cousin 
 We getting drunk we straight bugging 
 Brooklyn niggas up in here homie 
 We ready to lace something 
 I breathe heavy still got that weed in my lungs 
 Them lames hating on me but tell them I'm back son 
 New York on my back it's a rap the rap's gone 
 I'm from down the hill 
 The borderline of the stainville 
 It's do or die never ran never will 
 You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you these niggas man, I try you 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you them niggas man, I try you 
 He say he a G and his thing be squeezing 
 I don't believe 'em 
 He say he up in the can his name was ringing 
 I don't believe 'em, I don't believe you 
 I ain't see that when I see you 
 I straight try you man I don't leave you 
 What I carry in them robin jeans is lethal 
 They couldn't mess with me when I was wearing vin diesel 
 Always bragging you with the next man chick 
 But that make you a snake if that man in your cling 
 And then that dogs they don't know what they doin' 
 Always tryin' to get views until you give 'em a viewing 
 Funeral home another life ruined 
 All the cheap shots stop when niggas start shooting 
 Airing them if they start moving leave 'em with all dirty three in his back 
 Treating them like Patrick Vieira 
 I'm from down the hill 
 The borderline of the stainville 
 It's do or die never ran never will 
 You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you these niggas man, I try you 
 I try you motherfucker I try you 
 I try you them niggas man, I try you 
 All that gangsta talk 
 All that big money talk 
 I still try you man 
 I wanna see if it's real 
 This goes out to all my niggas man 
 Who they proclaiming that niggas supposed to be this and 
 He supposed to be that 
 And you looking at them and that thought just crossed your mind like 
 I try you nigga 
 I know you growing late all my real niggas relate 
 In case you to the death of me 
 The dream is the album coming soon 
 I know you hear my footsteps bozo 
 King of New York talk 
 This the lords of the land man 
 This the lords of Brooklyn 
 Anybody can get it 
 Ain't not favor
