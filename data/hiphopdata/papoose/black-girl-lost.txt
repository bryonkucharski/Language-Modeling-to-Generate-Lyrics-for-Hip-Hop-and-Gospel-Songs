Hello? 
 What's up girl 
 Ain't nothing, this nigga in here stressing 
 Talking that old off the wall back to Africa shit again 
 What, that God Body shit? 
 Yeah, that dumb shit 
 I'm trying to get up outta here! 
 I hear that, but yo, you know the spot is pumping tonight 
 Word for real where? 
 You know, where the real niggas is popping the Cristal 
 Not that white stuff! 
 Ha ha! Word where the real niggas at? 
 (JoJo Hailey) 
 Listen, to reason 
 Pretty baby baby listen 
 (Nas) 
 A young wild beautiful love child 
 You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping 
 Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping 
 The head'll make you take him shopping, a foul doctrine 
 Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick 
 You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit 
 Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails 
 Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine) 
 To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me 
 The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me 
 Wishing I could be the one man; but you juggle 
 Way too many Willies all in one hand 
 You want to run up in clubs, getting rubbed on 
 Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear 
 Get your fuck on, following week, you back there 
 But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars 
 Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out 
 Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas 
 Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave 
 What up mah, fronting like you naive 
 Pusherman's whip, calling police when you flip 
 Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us 
 But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word! 
 (Chorus: JoJo Hailey) 
 Diamonds all shining, looking all fine 
 Pretty little face, get a little high 
 Young girl struggling, trying to survive 
 Mother of the Earth, she made you and I 
 Just tired of playing the same ol' games 
 Messing with my mind, emotional things 
 And there goes, a black girl, lost 
 (Nas) 
 Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless 
 Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest 
 To who'sever getting down and trifless 
 To get his mind all you do is give him something priceless 
 Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs 
 More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah) 
 There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours 
 Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours 
 Face glistening, I'm addicted to you 
 Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you 
 Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen 
 To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets 
 Must've had a bad deal in the past though 
 Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow 
 Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain 
 You got a job part-time and school's your night thing 
 With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now 
 You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed 
 Typical day that the black girl sees 
 Coming home wanting more from a college degree 
 (Nas) 
 Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is 
 Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless 
 Your value, too much to be measured, I wonder how you 
 Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to 
 More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you 
 You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to 
 Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off 
 So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed) 
 Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to 
 Everything that move be inside you 
 Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you 
 I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to 
 They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers 
 Damn look, there goes a black girl lost 
 (JoJo Hailey) 
 You should be ashamed of yourself 
 The way you carry yourself 
 The way you hang out all night long 
 Doing silly things that is wrong 
 Black girl
