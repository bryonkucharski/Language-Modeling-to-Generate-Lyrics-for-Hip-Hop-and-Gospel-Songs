To everybody in the struggle 
 We gonna rise 
 Fame and fortune 
 And live the Nacirema Dream 
 Let's go! 
 The Nacirema Dream, enjoy the life's finer things 
 I want my lady to live like a queen 
 She want her man to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream, big cars and diamond rings 
 I want my mother to live like a queen 
 She want her son to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream 
 God reveal my treasure 
 I always knew I would build my cheddar 
 Pop criss like Webber, everybody who felt my pain 
 I want y'all to feel my pleasure 
 When people said I wouldn't get a deal, 
 I never listened 'cause who they told was ill I'm better 
 But I still had to hustle so crills I measured 
 Always had a way out 'cause skills I endeavored 
 He jumpin' over me to be the king, not clever 
 You knew this 'cause life is a game of chess, not checkers 
 On a property, finally found the treasure in y'all strivin 
 Stay away from the jeopardy, probably ecstasy 
 No poverty whether your plan is treachery 
 Lottery is filled from ebony to ivory 
 So now my mama don't gotta worry, kids don't gotta worry 
 I got more dead presidents than a cemetery 
 The Nacirema Dream, enjoy the life's finer things 
 I want my lady to live like a queen 
 She want her man to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream, big cars and diamond rings 
 I want my mother to live like a queen 
 She want her son to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream 
 Watching that flat screen cable 
 Eating life crumbs, I'm over the kitchen table 
 Every day I'm getting calls from another label 
 Remember when I used to boost more than jungle cables 
 Living in this Nacirema Dream, I'm able 
 To push the May-Back like an extra day of April 
 I'm nice, I rock ice just like Ice 
 Anyone Vanilla Ice, Ice T, just ice 
 Ice Cube, ice dudes, make the right moves 
 I'm a leader, niggas follow me just like rules 
 'Cause I'm the best star livin', 10 pie flippin 
 Next guy getting on the next dive mission 
 Puff the best lie, given, NY pimpin' 
 Watch yo taillight vision, in the lengths I'm whippin 
 Nacirema Dream, it's American spelled backwards 
 Living the American Dream is what I practice 
 The Nacirema Dream, enjoy the life's finer things 
 I want my lady to live like a queen 
 She want her man to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream, big cars and diamond rings 
 I want my mother to live like a queen 
 She want her son to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream 
 Fish bones dry in the kitchen (Nacirema) 
 Beans don't burn on the grill (Dream) 
 Took a whole lot of to ride in 
 Just to get me a record deal (Nacirema) 
 Man I'm way up in the big league (Dream) 
 Getting my turn that back (Nacirema) 
 As long as we rich 
 You and me baby 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that 
 I remember when they used to call us the free lunch bunch 
 Now we sign autographs when they see us work 
 Hop in the airplane, the weed up up 
 In the way all day while you re-up chop 
 When we land in yo city, they feed us lunch 
 We touch down like 1, 2, 3 hut hut 
 I'm reflection of this, I learned these tactics 
 Put the word in a mirror, watch it reflect backwards 
 The Nacirema Dream, enjoy the life's finer things 
 I want my lady to live like a queen 
 She want her man to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling 
 Nacirema Dream, big cars and diamond rings 
 I want my mother to live like a queen 
 She want her son to live like a king 
 It's bada bing, cha ching and bling bling
