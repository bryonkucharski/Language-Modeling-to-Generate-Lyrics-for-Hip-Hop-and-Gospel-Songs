This for the future queens, Congratulations 
 Happy birthday, happy sweet 16 
 This for the homies in the belly of the beast 
 All the brothers on post release 
 Got a phone call on my iPhone 5 
 Farah Conor wanna meet you 
 He coming to the stall 
 I started thinking with my third eye 
 About the blessing of me 
 And the great leader NY 
 A lot of Ballas in Chicago kings is passing 
 One of the brothers gave the family a fruit basket 
 Word is vow 
 He said instead of giving a fruit basket 
 We should give them fruits of Islam 
 Thank them force prominence then I listen 
 He said he wanted to thank me for speaking wisdom 
 Do my raps that was my mission 
 To spread wise words so now in my finish 
 Do I retire? Do I continue? 
 Knowledge is food for thought what's on the menu 
 Work hard give it your all all reign supreme 
 Nursuring my dream 
 I gotta get my groom back like Stella 
 Paraphernalia 
 You've been here before this looks familiar 
 I tried my best some got a failure 
 I got a 3 letter word to tell you 
 A L L, when the money was short I kept it tall 
 Before I could walk I had to crawl 
 If it's time to go I can't stall 
 A L L, I gave it my all 
 Reality shows how sad it is 
 Have a good show they gotta act like savages 
 Straight disrespecting each other 
 Girl fights, everybody sexing each other 
 What happened to the Cosby shows, good memories 
 TV shows used to have integrity 
 Who carries the light, Illuminati 
 Nicki Minaj said she voting for Mitt Romney 
 She gotta learn to love herself 
 Then she gonna vote for her own and not somebody else 
 Damn, RIP to Chris Lightey 
 Red alert told me you spoke highly 
 You took 1.5 we shine brightly 
 But when you left the building they got grinding 
 I'm moving forward the past is behind me 
 Giving my all, we almighty 
 I gotta get my groom back like Stella
