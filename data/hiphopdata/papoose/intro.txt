Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here 
 'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near 
 In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear 
 Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel 
 Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real 
 Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear 
 He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear 
 Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer 
 Cheers, time for a toast 
 (Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin') 
 To the haters that hate you the most 
 (Your heart's beatin') 
 And the friends that pretend to be your folks 
 (Your heart's beatin') 
 This is what revenge sounds like 
 (Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin') 
 I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah 
 Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do 
 Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it 
 It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible 
 And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix 
 This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable 
 Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it 
 Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do 
 When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this 
 Somebody call the doctor 
 (You're not breathin', you're not breathin') 
 They ain't gonna be well after this one right here 
 You're not breathin' 
 (You're not breathin', you're not breathin') 
 Just make sure they learn the name 
 (You're not breathin') 
 That's about to be runnin' the game 
 (You're not breathin') 
 Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne 
 Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do 
 I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too 
 You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to 
 If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you 
 Y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin' 
 (I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin') 
 Houston, Texas, I'm here now 
 (I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin') 
 Anybody gotta problem? 
 (I'm not leavin') 
 Speak now or forever hold your peace 
 (I'm not leavin') 
 I ain't think so, yeah 
 The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily 
 I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby 
 The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me 
 In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady 
 But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived 
 If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie 
 They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply 
 They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes 
 Better go take over befo' it rains 
 'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne 
 I know, I know what you're gonna say 
 But have it your way 
 I know these haters is gonna hate 
 And I see that angry look on your face 
 Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way 
 This isn't your day 
 Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been? 
 Where have you been? Where have you been? 
 Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them 
 Somethin' for them, somethin' for them 
 You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind 
 Sound in the wind, sound in the wind 
 You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again 
 You hear that? 
 (Yeah what's that?) 
 That's The Sound of Revenge 
 See, I told you 
 That's what happens when you get on his bad side 
 Chamillitary Mayne 
 And now for The Sound of Revenge
