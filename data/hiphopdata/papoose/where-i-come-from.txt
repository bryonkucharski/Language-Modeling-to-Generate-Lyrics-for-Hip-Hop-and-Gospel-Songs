What y'all thought y'all was safe? 
 Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna hear my niggas on the Nacirema dream 
 Thuggers to the death of me 
 Or should I say to the death of you? 
 Thugger! 
 Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed 
 Where I come from young boys respect old heads 
 Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested 
 And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message 
 Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's 
 Where you come from, y'all talk to the police 
 Where you come from niggas never get it shakin 
 Y'all be Internet killin', iPhone bangin' 
 I got the Louie's on my feet, true swag, belt LV 
 You take camera, I stay picture perfect, no RG 
 Who got that green swag? That our nigga, that's me 
 Heart of a stone, don't bust the rock, Jay-Z 
 You stay around pussies, the whole squad coochies 
 I stay around G's, my whole squad Gucci 
 Thugger thugger, ain't that a storm muthafucka? 
 Nigga never had to rap 'bout me, word to my mother 
 I spit that fire like I'm propane, niggas call me cocaine 
 Now I'm in the dope game, used to rock a rope chain 
 Thugger to the death of me, whole team strike back 
 Pap already warned y'all, homie you ain't like that 
 Real recognize real, we don't complain 
 Niggas slick talk, end up with a slug in his brain 
 We run down on em, cutting down on em 
 Lay on these niggas, from sun up to sun down on em 
 Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed 
 Where I come from young boys respect old heads 
 Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested 
 And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message 
 Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's 
 Where you come from, y'all talk to the police 
 Where you come from niggas never get it shakin 
 Y'all be Internet killin', iPhone bangin' 
 Rap said don't spend it unless you got it in the stash 
 All said you wanted cop it, fuck it if it's yo last 
 Papper said it's yo turn ho, get up in that ass 
 You got style and charisma, give 'em some pizazz 
 180 on the dash, you can't ride like me 
 I did this my whole life, OD, OG 
 I'm a side block nigga, give respect in the peas 
 Flying overseas just for me to play your jetski 
 My pops told me treat your team like everything 
 Prepare e well, make sure they ready for anything 
 I give my word, hands down, no funny dreams 
 Where I become, we get it done by any means 
 In here I feel it, I'm just waitin 
 And money make me nervous, my hands shakin 
 I said geer, I feel it, them niggas hatin' 
 But I don't see it niggas, my family is Thugacation 
 Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed 
 Where I come from young boys respect old heads 
 Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested 
 And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message 
 Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's 
 Where you come from, y'all talk to the police 
 Where you come from niggas never get it shakin 
 Y'all be Internet killin', iPhone bangin' 
 Not cancer, T-Mack on the grind 
 It's like catchin ruler divine, eatin the swine 
 I was born to be a Mack, call me T-Mack divine 
 Life of skater, every day I go brown so every day I'm a shine 
 I'm Thugercated, so you don't want no problem ho 
 Rack ice in the chain, call it Dada Stone 
 I'm with them stickup kids, that's Thanksgaming 
 It's Pap with Thugacation, we just Nacirema Dreamin' 
 Ayo yo flow is whack, stelin, slippin, better spit it well and shifted 
 Violate, I lay you down, quicker than a trailer visit 
 Hella digits, anybody get in, I finish her blood 
 I run through a sea like sella mission 
 Your work is garbage, that's the reason why your boys struggle 
 Train you a lyric, be teaching a hook like Floyd uncle 
 Runnin' for cover when the ratchet ring 
 I had yo faggot team stripping like a model in a magazine 
 Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed 
 Where I come from young boys respect old heads 
 Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested 
 And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message 
 Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's 
 Where you come from, y'all talk to the police 
 Where you come from niggas never get it shakin 
 Y'all be Internet killin', iPhone bangin'
