Street sweepers entertain me 
 The saga continues 
 Thug-A-Cation 
 The saga continues 
 Papoose 
 The saga continues 
 They can never stop me, 
 The saga continues 
 While y'all was in Miami for memorial day 
 I was cleaning my gun making sure the 40 ok 
 They say the making movies, you call me ok 
 We seen a movie, but you ain't let the audio play 
 Nigga say stick up, kids don't live long 
 But I'm still living I proved them pricks wrong 
 Soon as I put the boy on the block that shit gone 
 Come on man I move more boy than Big Sean 
 When I be on fire they tell me they don't want 
 Lay up in the sun and leave me in the storm 
 Do their little shows don't want me to perform 
 Roof roof feels good to be the underdog 
 I grew up in the same neighborhood as Chris Rock 
 Bane bridge, I live right around the corner from dots 
 But it was nothing like everybody hates Chris 
 Just a gangster hood where everybody hate a snitch 
 Cop the new form deposits out of top deeds 
 Then I head to jewelry store get my jewelry clean 
 Cop a 50 half of ralphies, a bro y'all breeze 
 Papoose diner fish home fries and cheese 
 I ain't no Al Pacino but I move a few joints 
 Sell a bird for my man just to make a few points 
 Your man oath then he gonna pay me 
 My gun clap like a thunder no OKC 
 Niggas talking all this New York shit 
 Chase you back into the mountains toss you off cliffs 
 Think you Tony Montana, who want this 
 I get rid of Tony like the New York Knicks 
 Jeremy Lynn sip penny and gin 
 If we was once enemies we could never be friends 
 Bet you ain't never disrespect me again 
 Skinny niggas with felonies call me felony slim
