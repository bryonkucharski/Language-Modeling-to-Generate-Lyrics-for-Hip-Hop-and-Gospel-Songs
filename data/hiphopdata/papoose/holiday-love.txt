I need a girl to take the clothes out the cleaner 
 The food out the freezer 
 Lay some off me when I cop new snickers 
 A name like Keisha, Tasa or Lisa 
 Or maybe Tanisha a real hood diva 
 I say you look good, she say looks can deceive you 
 You got a small mouth I can tell you a screamer 
 Wash the car for me when I park by the meter 
 Roll up my refill oh ye she's a keeper 
 Love when I come see her but hate when I leave her 
 So she stash my car keys behind the speaker 
 And she go to bed with a book she a reader 
 Intelligent I call her baby girl like Aliyah 
 Think for me when I'm not thinking she a thinker 
 Pick up all the shells if I clap my anina 
 Have you seen her I'm tryin' to find my wife 
 You make me high, I'm high on life 
 Holiday, it's your day every way 
 Celebrate, come on and celebrate 
 Everytime, girl every time I see you take me 
 High 
 When she see me she hug me and make the scenery lovely 
 We argue she hate it but she won't leave me she love me 
 She get heated and cuss me let me eat when I'm hungry 
 Then she please me and lust me she gon' tease me she fuck me 
 They be keeping her from me but she sneaky she hug me 
 She wrote me a dirty text she said she need me she want em 
 Now you haters make me sick I'm gonna need me some buckles 
 I don't need her she ugly she completley disgust me 
 Never lie to my lady she would easily bust me 
 She know me like a book she can read me just trust me 
 And she cook like a chef she be feeding my tummy 
 I love that ass like cash come and bring me my money 
 When I feel all alone I just think of my honey 
 She occupying my mind she be keeping me company 
 We see the haters we laugh 'cause we thinking it's funny 
 She been with me through the storm so she with me when it's sunny 
 Holiday love 
 Holiday, it's your day every way 
 Celebrate, come on and celebrate 
 Everytime, girl every time I see you take me 
 High
