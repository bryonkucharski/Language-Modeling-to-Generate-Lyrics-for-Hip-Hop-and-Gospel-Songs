I was born in a human body, I'm deadly and dangerous 
 The way I decrease life quality is outrageous 
 But you don't gotta worry, I'm not contagious 
 I'm genetic, I travel through your family for ages 
 I could live in yo daughter, I could live in yo son 
 If you smoke cigarettes, I could live in yo lungs 
 I can develop in yo stomach and be that small 
 But I grow to the size of a basketball 
 Now you can ignore me and try to pass it on 
 You'll be a statistic, in the casket gone 
 I could be a sharp pain that you feel in yo spine 
 I can be a brain tumor on the back of yo mind 
 I'll even be in yo food if you eatin that swine 
 Don't go to the doctor so you never catch me in time 
 I done cause some strong men to lose they strength 
 Even cause some pretty women to lose they breaths 
 Only God know the cure and to whom he bless 
 Is the chosen, he choose the best 
 I'm a physical enemy, here to bring miserable treachery 
 I can affect him, her, they, you or them and me 
 But one small woman gotta checkup randomly 
 They burn me out of her body with chemo therapy 
 If you come late I'll deflate your energy 
 Take all of your hairt and erase your memory 
 I can shorten your life if you livin' it long 
 Even took a black queen named Vivian Strong 
 If you don't go to the doctor that mean you support me 
 The only way to stop me is to catch me early 
 And gangstas who think I can't get in y'all body 
 I even claimed the life of mobster John Gotti 
 Have you had a checkup? If no is your answer 
 Them let me introduce myself, my name is cancer 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 The prettiest woman out here blows long in the wind 
 Even sip when she wasn't soft as her skin 
 Teeth look like ivory, pleasant as a beach 
 Breasts like 2 watermelons, ripe like a peach 
 On the outside, sexy as can be 
 But on the inside she's infected with me 
 She be up in every neighborhood, dead on the street 
 Give you her phone number, give you head in the V 
 And she don't like condom, she sex it for free 
 So if you ever met er get tested for me 
 Every single day I add names to my dying list 
 My epidemic is strong as an iron fist 
 You should check your body fluids, that's where I exist 
 Can travel through saliva, I hope you like to kiss 
 You can't get rid of me, you can cry and wish 
 It's no denying this, science says 
 He says I was born in Africa, but he's a lying bitch 
 I was born in the laboratory, my father's a scientist 
 You can't contact me if you walk in a bathroom 
 Or if you talk to your classmate in your classroom 
 You never see me coming, I'm smooth as a jazz tune 
 Not airborne, I pass moves 
 But you should make sure they clean the needle 
 When you getting them tattoos 
 I'm the reason the word positive means bad news 
 Idiotic if you don't believe in me 
 Even took a great rapper named Eazy-E 
 If you have a lot of sex you should have some condoms 
 Cause you could live with me, ask Magic Johnson 
 I enter your body with only one assumed mission 
 That's only to break down your immune system 
 Become sick easy 'cause you not immune 
 And I can pass over through every open wound 
 So make sure you put a Band-Aid on your cut 
 Before you shake another man's hands sayin' wussup 
 I'm physical and visible, you can't feel me 
 Medicine, I'm invincible, you can't kill me 
 AIDS is my name, don't get it wrong 
 It stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
 (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 
 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 This drug addict named Raj is infected with my evil 
 Got some new dope he wanna try with his people 
 He said go ahead and try it, it's some brand new diesel 
 That's when I found myself travelling through a needle 
 Don't even know what he getting into is a shame 
 Tied his arm up and pump me right in his vein 
 He had a lot of women, was living to play his life 
 But he was married, he took me home to his wife 
 Now she's a carrier who carries on with me 
 His wife had a baby, the baby was born with me 
 And I hope that you wouldn't take this song silly 
 A lot of people infected, it's a strong pity 
 You got a jimmy hat? Then you should put on jimmy 
 Let's protect ourselves, we should all, really 
 I'm tryna live long, won't you live long with me? 
 Suburbs to the city, sing this song with me 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home 
 He rides to it 
 Don't stress a lot 
 Put protection on 
 If he's in your home
