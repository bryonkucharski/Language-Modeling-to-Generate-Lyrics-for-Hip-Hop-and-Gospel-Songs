To everybody in the struggle 
 If somebody ever told you, you couldn't do something 
 And you still made it happen 
 Congratulations 
 So clap for the independent women 
 So clap for my homies straight thuggin' 
 Clap for the real MC's buzzin 
 We the leaders of the new school 
 Uh... 
 Mama's in the kitchen cookin' that rice 
 Father's outside shootin' 'em dice 
 Brother's in jail raising hell 
 Sister's on the corner sellin' fruit cocktails 
 Family alcoholic's still sippin' his booze 
 That's why I'm rappin' over rhythm and blues 
 To all you rich black folks with your glissining jewels 
 Entrepeneurs all you millionaire dudes 
 Before you catch another case limit your moves 
 Johnny Cochran got a brain tumor I deliver the news 
 What if mother nature aborted the sky 
 When we shoot our fireworks on the fourth of July 
 We can't afford the life so abortion rised 
 Can't afford the truth so we told a lie 
 Can't afford a funeral cause the cost is high 
 GOD DAMN we can't even afford to die 
 But if you buying a house I'll be your landlord 
 I'll finance you a car that's if you can afford 
 I own the jails, the banks and all the property's 
 Here's a million come on big shot 
 Lets play Monopoly 
 'Cause when the rappers start grindin' 
 It's a shame my outta towna gotta sign em 
 But when his album drop and he go diamond 
 Everybody was beside em 
 Every real artist need a real label to sign em 
 Jus like every good man need a good woman behind them 
 It ain't about havin' the baddest chick on the streets 
 I respect the dude Nas 'cause he married Calise 
 But still if you ain't ready just wanna be my Beyonce 
 Then we can do it like Jay-Z & Beyonce 
 Pardon my language if you a real bitch 
 Then we can do it like Jada and Will Smith 
 Coincedence where we comin' to spend it at 
 We in the same place that we first got rich at 
 They only gon' give us what they know they can get back 
 So when you get money don't you ever forget that 
 He got a DVD flow 
 They need to get my man smackers on TV show 
 The voice of the jail, voice of the streets 
 Kay Slay's social plays seven days a week 
 We pull guns on eachother always still people's 
 If you strapped then I'm not strapped we still equal 
 They say don't carry guns cause guns real lethal 
 But guns don't kill people, people kill people 
 My cousin got into time he said it ain't nothing 
 Told me I can do the time standing on my head cousin 
 Yo Paps stay focused you out here bustin' 
 Time I come home you gon' be somethin' 
 Wish I can do half of this time for him 
 We goin' in thuggin' He do it here I do it here 
 They running through cover but still 
 It's all about having money and properties (True) 
 They rather see us doing drugs then robberies (True) 
 We gotta flip that into the economy (You) 
 So my philosophy is the way of the world 
 Lets play monopoly 
 Gotta Monopolize and Strategize 
 So we can get this money 
 Get filthy rich 
 Thugication, Streetsweepers 
 C'mon man 
 East Coast pop a bottle with y'all 
 West Coast pop a bottle with y'all 
 Down South pop a bottle with y'all 
 Count your blessings you ain't promised them all
