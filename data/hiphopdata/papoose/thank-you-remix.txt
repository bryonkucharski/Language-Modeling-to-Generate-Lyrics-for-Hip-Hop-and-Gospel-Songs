My cell phone ringing, I ain't receiving no calls 
 I get a bad signal when I be in the mall 
 She say where you at? I was leaving a stall 
 She slammed it but I put my feet in the door 
 Her body was appeasing and pure 
 Her crib so clean you can eat off the floor 
 She picked up a book when she reached in the drawer 
 She a smart woman like finna she call 
 We argue and never lead to a war 
 We agree to disagree and that's all 
 If your man keep bringing up your past 
 Don't be with him girl 
 If he accepted that what he bring it up for 
 Your girl cheat on you so you cheat on your girl 
 Play tit for tat just to even the score 
 Gotta focus on the future to achieve in this world 
 Never hateful, forever thankful 
 Sometimes I wonder do you 
 Even recognize the woman 
 That's standing in front of you 
 Listen, sometimes I wonder do you 
 Even care or realize why I took care of you 
 'Cause you're my heart 
 You are my soul 
 You're my other half 
 Without you I cannot be whole baby 
 So far apart 
 I just don't know 
 What drove us apart in the first place 
 Now I know baby 
 Why 
 These tears I cry sure won't be the last 
 They will not be the last, no 
 'Cause this pain inside never seems to pass 
 It never seems to pass me by 
 So I thank you 
 Said I thank you 
 Yes I thank you 
 For making me a woman 
 Sometimes I wonder could she be 
 More of a woman to you than you were a man to me 
 Listen, sometimes I wonder, why me 
 I'm here miserable while you're out living your fantasies 
 And didn't care 
 'Cause you're my heart 
 You are my soul 
 You're my other half 
 Without you I cannot be whole baby 
 So far apart 
 I just don't know 
 What drove us apart in the first place 
 Now I know baby 
 Why 
 These tears I cry sure won't be the last 
 They will not be the last, no 
 Cause' this pain inside which never seems to pass 
 It never seems to pass me by 
 So I thank you 
 Said I thank you 
 Yes I thank you 
 For making me a woman
