Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone 
 Stiff and rotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone 
 Stiff and rotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone 
 Stiff and rotten 
 I've been abducted by this thug shit 
 Fucked up and corrupted 
 Stabbed in the back by cocksuckers I trusted 
 Backstabbers, you wouldn't believe the stuff I was stuck with 
 It plummets to my stomach I suffered I'm disgusted 
 I adjusted 'cause I thugged in I'm reluctant 
 Kept in rucket, gust a moschet, rust it 
 Then I clutched it when I bust it 
 Frank fooled an ass nigga I splatter your bustin' 
 Hussling with my cousins we moving work by the dozens 
 Intercause buzzing we had to hope build in public 
 The public wanted justice but that's a whole another subject 
 Discovered by them buzzers they interrupted and rushed it 
 You a true thing, I never lied to you my beloved 
 My reality's police brutality, yours wasn't 
 The bandages couldn't hide the damages that was coming 
 My wrist bleeding busting from when they cuffed it 
 You hating on me, no acknowledgment won't discuss it 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Left for dead, dissed and forgotten 
 Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone 
 Stiff and rotten
