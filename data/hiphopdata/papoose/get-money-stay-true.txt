Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue 
 Getting money stay true 
 Where I'm from is like a zoo 
 Better keep your gun on you 
 Same shit ain't nothing new 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Spit like I got the flu 
 Get my click tight like glue 
 Get it right and then we bloom 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue 
 Ey yo this one for the team 
 Keep the gun in my jeans 
 Put your jumps to the fiends 
 Finna slums getting green 
 Where my flow is so sick 
 Moving blow by the brick 
 Bank roll when it's thick 
 Why you always on my dick 
 Let's get that pace and on my shine 
 Niggas say I'm on my mind 
 Making them dollars signs 
 Hated that's the bottom line 
 Got the rolls and the jags 
 These hoes loves my swag 
 Try to go where my bag 
 When your tone gon' get back 
 In the streets I'm a villain 
 We eat from the dillan 
 This cheese I'm billing 
 Throw my feet to the ceiling 
 Got the crib and a wife 
 Watch us living in my life 
 While you hit in the knife 
 All them niggas so trife 
 Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue 
 Getting money stay true 
 Where I'm from is like a zoo 
 Better keep your gun on you 
 Same shit ain't nothing new 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Spit like I got the flu 
 Get my click tight like glue 
 Get it right and then we bloom 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue 
 I keep the hawk in my jeans 
 Floss with the bling 
 My offense is mean 
 In New York I'm the king 
 Selling soft to the fiends 
 The boss on the scene 
 Chinese restaurant 
 Hot sauce on my wings 
 You get tossed for the cream 
 Just talk to the queen 
 In the box but she still make calls from the dean 
 Carried to mats I walk with them things 
 2 M's I'm a G like Ross and his team 
 Mouth forth and you scream 
 You causing a scene 
 Blow your brains out 
 Show your thoughts and your dreams 
 Ow poor prince is clean 
 We cautious and keen 
 Long since we've been 
 My force is supreme 
 Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue 
 Getting money stay true 
 Where I'm from is like a zoo 
 Better keep your gun on you 
 Same shit ain't nothing new 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Spit like I got the flu 
 Get my click tight like glue 
 Get it right and then we bloom 
 Gettin' money stay true 
 Whatcha niggas wanna do 
 Hundred niggas in my crew 
 Some wear red, some wear blue
