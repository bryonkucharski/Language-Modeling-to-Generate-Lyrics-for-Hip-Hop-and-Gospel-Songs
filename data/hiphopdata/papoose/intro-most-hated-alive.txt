Blue world wanna change New York gun laws 
 Rockefeller fucked up all of the drug lords 
 Alot of people hating on artists from up north 
 City out of stand still I'm here to unpause 
 Hometown haters don't support oppose 
 Them out of town niggas come through and they suck all 
 That's how I knock my stuff off 
 I tell 'em niggas everyday I'm hussling 
 Like a I'm a young Ross 
 Never been though you was cut from work load 
 It must've been velvet 'cause you gum soft 
 Can't squash beef once a nigga get bumped off 
 You're sweeter than dumb sauce 
 I couldn't give a fuck if you lost love 
 Once a couple shots get bust off 
 We lost blood and you said it ain't no love lust 
 Your man said it's dead so you taking your gloves off 
 Your man can't tell me what to do that's your boss 
 Cheerleader it's cold so I keep a hand heater 
 My quarter water pussy change in your man meter 
 Take me I promise you you can't beat us 
 You club pop up I bring the chopper up the amnesia 
 You not strapped but you claim you're holding 
 So when shit pop off you be laying frozen 
 Then you wanna claim everything that's rolley 
 Living off my fame so your fame is stolen 
 You playing kid games and in game we growing 
 Put shame in the game so the game exposed her 
 The things that you claim it's insane I told her 
 So shut your kid playing man this things is chosen 
 You hate what you ain't controlling 
 You a scumbag, your mother should've named you Trojan 
 I got my weight up they was talking Unity I 
 But when they had me running star they had me ruger me stop 
 Perpetuating frauds claiming that we poo when we not 
 Like I ain't hear your stories when you got your jewelry pop 
 They call you by your first name you cool with these cops 
 You never feel the high one, but you soon to be shot 
 Since I was 16 man I used to shoot on these blocks 
 Duba duba we had the whole community locked 
 So when I started buzzing they already knew we was hot 
 Open them doors and the opportunity knock 
 I show my son the knowledge so he understand daddy 
 I teach my girl the wisdom so she make her man happy 
 My baby girl got my eyes she be starring at me 
 I let her know I'm too young to be a gran daddy 
 Man my wisdom is strong I could lift a carone 
 Quick as the glitch of a star drift as the ways of a lock 
 As I sit with the gods I see you sit with the frauds 
 Scripture my songs to show how dangerous these instruments are 
 You can hit with the drums, man a rhythm is hard 
 The high hemic you high flesh you can hear the guitars 
 My brain cells is jail ink pen is the yard 
 Such a prison with bars I got some visits to mom 
 You brag about getting head from a chick ass minor 
 You don't brag about ruining that vagina diner 
 Lyrically inclined, spiritually divine 
 Mentally designed to leave you blind 
 It was meant for me to rise balistikally I grind 
 Third eye, trilogy the eyes epidemy wise 
 All you women beating guys is quick to meet demise 
 Could meet the mister meet the crimes 
 Just to see you dine 
 I'm pulling mm's 9's physically I'm fine 
 I got my weight up in that chimp you niggas seeing size 
 Throw nigga be inside to pick the bee behind 
 I'm seriously surprised you killing me you guys 
 Try dissing me at times but victory was mine 
 Backstabbing motherfuckers sticking me with knives 
 All your trickery and lies with misery combined 
 No history of mine can't finish this without
