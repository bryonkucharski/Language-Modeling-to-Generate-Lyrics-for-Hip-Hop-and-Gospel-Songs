Papoose? 
 Let me show you all how its posed to be done 
 Don't get me started 
 It's getting kinda crowded in here 
 Back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocated 
 Now here's my problem 
 I'm not gonna be your chick on the side 
 Forget about it 
 You know damn well it wouldn't be right 
 I dunno what you been thinkin' 'bout me 
 Did you think this was gonna be that easy? 
 Hell no, u must be going crazy! 
 (No-o-ooh) Why don't you get outta my life 
 Get outta my sight 
 Get off oh my back... 
 Why don't you go back to your world... 
 Go back to your girl... 
 I think you owe her... 
 I know what's going on 
 I won't be second to none (no) 
 Back up, 'cause you crowdin' my space... 
 You need to get outta my face 
 Lets be honest 
 I'm not the type of chick that you use... 
 And if you want it 
 If you want it 
 You'll have to choose 
 I've been through this 
 I've been cheated on... 
 I know how it feels 
 Would I know that you wouldn't do the same to me 
 Papoose... BK.B... uh... K... they say you can't have your cake and eat it too... 
 Tell me what's the meaning... 
 What's the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it 
 Cheaters never win, my friend, you like creepin' 
 But hate when you're girl starts cheatin' 
 Imagine if you came home to your wife 
 Opened your door and locked it 
 Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet 
 I knew you would start cheatin', before you even stopped it 
 I'm like when you double your money, I'm a profit... 
 Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser... 
 I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer 
 You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist 
 Since your name is Genie, can I make a wish? (yeah) 
 No minor set backs, every move major 
 Grown folk behavior, just do me one favor... 
 He put you on the side, let me be your savior... 
 Crowded... 
 Get outta my life 
 Get outta my sight 
 Get off oh my back... 
 'Cause you're crowdin' my space 
 You need to get outta my face
