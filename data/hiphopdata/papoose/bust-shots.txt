Bust shots, bust that bust shots 
 Bust that, bust that, bust that 
 Bust shots, bust that bust shots 
 Bust that, bust that, bust that 
 Bust shots, bust that bust shots 
 Bust that, bust that, bust that 
 Niggas getting 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip your bird a snitch 
 We let them shots fly no turbulance 
 I see some dark nights like Batman 
 Doing jokes like Chaz out of black hands 
 Scheeming on your block I be speeding past the cops 
 Thugging hard make it hard 
 Flashing infrared dots 
 Let that chopper chop to your project 
 Pocket rocking my pocket 
 Toppless pop a Chris Wallace 
 You and your partners gotta pay homage 
 Let them shells go and you know that 
 Gun be next to my boozak 
 Riding stolen cars with no lowjack 
 Push your weed back to you kojack 
 You try to lie me? you must be joking 
 If he ain't blood he must be loaking 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk 
 Grip you burn a snitch 
 Murk, murk, murk
