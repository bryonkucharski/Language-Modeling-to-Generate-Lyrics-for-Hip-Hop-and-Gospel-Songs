They think they the only ones getting that aye money 
 They think they the only ones getting that weed money 
 They think they the only ones getting that show money 
 We gettin' it too 
 Nigga we getting it too 
 Tell 'em niggas we getting it too 
 Bitch we getting it too 
 Tell them bitches we getting it too 
 Niggas ain't riding with me 
 They don't dig me it's cool 
 Deep down inside they always wanted Willie to lose 
 In the strip club we ain't putting them jewels 
 I keep the ratchet on me they can't never stick me in suze 
 I play hockey with the greedious dudes 
 'Cause I went to the spot where mama sent me to school 
 They sellin' 5 8's put the semi to cruise 
 I had to shoot 'em so my 12 - 12 skinny could move 
 I ain't as silly as you 
 I be on my grizzly you on your Winnie the Pooh 
 A dare nigga try to give me the blues 
 That Mr. T shit, I pity the fool 
 I keep the rides go full 
 We not know sheeps, and they not know wolves 
 We in that rose more, I'm so full 
 Man I got more rose than the Chicago Bulls 
 They think they the only ones getting that aye money 
 They think they the only ones getting that weed money 
 They think they the only ones getting that show money 
 We gettin' it too 
 Nigga we getting it too 
 Tell 'em niggas we getting it too 
 Bitch we getting it too 
 Tell them bitches we getting it too
