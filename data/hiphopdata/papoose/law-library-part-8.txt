The Law Library saga now continues 
 The Nacirema Dream version 
 As promised, yuh 
 You used to get a year for a gun, they increasing 
 The math 
 Nowadays you gon get 3 and a half 
 A predicate 5 or 7, word is bond 
 Welcome to Law Library, fire arms 
 Take these bars and put 'em in your conversary 
 The veils is heavy, lawyer taking every penny 
 Pay attention, you could leave your jail cell empty 
 I'd like to welcome you to my law library 
 Take these bars and play 'em in the beacon son 
 I am you, you are me, we are one 
 Law Library, a place where you need to come 
 'Cause to get freedom, you can't be free and dumb 
 We educated, so the cops is pissed 
 Now they got a new plan, stop and frisk 
 Interesting, they caught my attention 
 'Cause this a violation of the 4th amendment 
 Which speaks on search and seizure 
 So all officers should rehearse procedure 
 You gotta learn this, it's the right of the people to be secure 
 Against all the reasonable searches 
 They don't understand the amendment 
 They say stop and frisk, its one of the many exceptions 
 They altered it, changed the definition 
 So now it's a perfect fit for all the bullshittin' 
 Sounds like fiction but to justify it in court 
 The cops gotta have reasonable suspicion 
 If they don't, this where I need you to listen 
 To search you they gotta ask for permission 
 I can't determine how that go 
 But if I was you I would say hell no 
 Reason to stop, fact determined by a cop 
 Informant or having presence on a high block 
 Reason to frisk, suspect the law, you breakin it 
 On suspicion that a man is armed and dangerous 
 Even though they making these horrible laws 
 They cannot search you without probable cause 
 Gun cases get dictated by the laws 
 Your defense is to prove Is not yours 
 The presence in any room, dwelling structure or vehicle, 
 Any grounds of any machine gun is presumptive evidence now 
 Of its unlawful possession by all persons 
 Occupying a place, such machine gun was found 
 If you in the vicinity of a gun you taking chances 
 Unless under the following circumstances 
 A if such weapon found was where? Upon a person 
 Of one of the occupants there 
 B if the weapon found in the car was either being operated for hire 
 By a licensed driver 
 C is plain, if one of the occupants has a valid 
 License to have and carry concealed 
 The same 
 What's the next chapter that I should reveal? 
 Article 4-50 of appeals 
 Law Library.
