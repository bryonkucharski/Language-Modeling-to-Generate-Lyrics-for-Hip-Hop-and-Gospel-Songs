In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange 
 In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange 
 You don't get stepped on 
 Slip away teflon 
 Get stepped get shop 
 Leave you with their chest gone get hit by the best on 
 Every time you leave girl you gotta put your vest on 
 We playing their reaction 
 That's just how it is man anything can happen 
 Leave once come back again 
 Pigs on a huns sniffing out drug traffic again 
 In a New York minute 
 Surely been the same man 
 Watch where you step getting caught up in the game land 
 In a New York minute 
 You ride for your brothers 
 Been it for mainly what you die for your colors 
 In a New York minute 
 Hold your own blast out people fresh off head back to the crack house 
 In a New York minute 
 This shit is not a game 
 Getting knocked out here if you don't use your brain 
 In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange 
 In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange 
 Picture me rolling in the mase' 
 Cops wanna stop me, why? 
 'Cause I'm a king like Rodney 
 We used to murder for a hobby 
 Press the intercone walk right in the building and spray the lobby 
 But now I move more wisely our past is behind me 
 I'm an ex murderer like Ashanti 
 I'm stomping through the city like Godzilla 
 Question, why am I still breathing if y'all killers 
 In a New York minute 
 We be sipping that hard liquor shooter 
 I make them hit the deck like a card dealer 
 In a New York minute 
 Take an open shot like Arm Miller 
 Indiana pace 'em more shots then a bartender 
 In a New York minute 
 They be claiming they cross gripers 
 They a bunch of Barbies Nicki Minaj niggas 
 In a New York minute 
 We too authentic 
 Give it to a niggas in a new york minute 
 In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange 
 In a New York minute 
 Everything can change 
 In a New York minute 
 Things will get pretty strange
