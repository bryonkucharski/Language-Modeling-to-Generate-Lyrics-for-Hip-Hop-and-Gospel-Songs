Put it on the line 
 Lets go 
 Yeah, before you can help somebody 
 Man you gotta help yourself 
 It's called self-preservation 
 Got this shit down to a science man 
 Check it out 
 Mind body and soul 
 Mind--he can control you mentally 
 Body--he can tell you what to do physically 
 Soul--only god control you spirutally 
 So you bust guns smoke weed drink hennessy 
 Mirror mirror on the wall 
 Take a look at him vividly 
 You lookin' at your own worst enemy 
 Put it on the line 
 When you alone, everybody talk to theyself 
 Sometimes it's the only way to get across to yourself 
 You ever wanted to do somethin' but thought to yourself 
 Or didn't wanna do somethin' but forcin yourself 
 You ever did somethin' good and been glad for yourself 
 Or did somethin' fucked up so you mad at yourself 
 Thought about somethin' funny and laughed to yourself 
 Or kept that to yourself 
 You ever met another person 
 Who reminded you in the past of yourself 
 Why y'all so much alike you askin yourself 
 Y'all so much alike y'all clash cause it felt 
 Like he was tryin' to be you when he act like himself 
 Really deep down inside you mad at yourself 
 Pull the gun and blast at him you blast at yourself 
 Ever knew somethin' was true and then nodded to yourself 
 Cause you can't take the truth stop lyin' to yourself 
 It's like the mind fight the heart 
 Some niggas mind so sharp, they fight what they feel 
 And do the wise thing they so smart 
 But other niggas do what's in their heart 
 React off emotions they black out and get so dark 
 They hold it in and never talk 
 But get old and die of heart attacks 
 They get attacked by their own heart 
 Some niggas get too conceited and fill theirself 
 Try to be somethin' they're not but reveal theirself 
 Some niggas get insecure they grill theirself 
 Put a gun to their own head and kill theirself 
 You ever found yourself lookin' out for everybody else 
 So much that you don't look out for yourself 
 If you a stick up kid then 'red drug deal and blue' 
 A rapper with a mic salesman with a shoe 
 Don't let nothin' get in your way just do what you do 
 Cause the only person that can stop you is you 
 That's why I say who am i 
 You say what a stupid question but who am i 
 Think before you start talkin' 
 You forgettin where you came from 
 Remind yourself 
 Life is like a dictionary 
 Define yourself 
 Are you a gangsta 
 Well lets define that word 
 I'ma try but it takes action to describe that word 
 A gangsta takes care of family he's never afraid 
 Death before disrespect a gangsta is brave 
 Are you a thug 
 It's like a gangsta but more gully 
 Money before bitches and honor before money 
 You a baller 
 Then you cop a house before a car 
 Fortune before fasion play monopoly y'all 
 Are you a rapper 
 Then you must invent those songs 
 They don't gotta like you 
 But they gonna respect your boss 
 I named my son papoose 
 He reflectin me 
 But he way better than me 
 Man controls his destiny
