Brooklyn, rise to the occasion 
 Papoose, PK 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 All the thorough bread borough heads, where y'all from? 
 All the hundred dollar billers villains, where y'all from? 
 All the low key OG's, where y'all from? 
 Got a gat, cock it back, let me hear y'all gun 
 Come and take a walk through my horde, I'll guide yo vision 
 When niggas who ain't ready to die get shot for livin' 
 Stepped out the building another day, my time was tickin 
 But had to make a U turn, damn forgot the biskey 
 I stashed it on the side of the sink, behind the dishes 
 On Sundays I praise gun plays, that's my religion 
 Walking down the block with a boppin rhythm, 
 Had to take a leak behind the green garbage can, 
 Who needs a pot to piss in? 
 That's when I bumped heads with my man, he out of prison 
 Wuddup son? Noticed his grin looked kinds different 
 He had a long scar on his face, somebody jigged him 
 I got away when he got knocked, wish I was with him 
 They put the green light out, know how the game go 
 Niggas die for they colors, gotta respect the rainbow 
 Take John through the slums just to get a coliday come 
 Hoodlems through they guns in the sewers and swallow they jums 
 Snitches stopping the funs, when they hear the drama they run 
 So we throw the slugs to their tumors and silence they tongues 
 Raw ball heist, hand to hand is far more trife 
 Customers be bangin' on the spot doors all night 
 I told the last customer your next time not like 
 He knock hard so I copped and took his heart not life 
 The mother ghetto went in first up, want the crook bone 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam 
 Y'all outsiders better come right, don't look wrong 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Home of the time of hoax with money missin' and drama talks 
 And you can tell a nigga from Brooklyn just how he walks 
 Them Brownsville dudes carry gas in they draws 
 Come through rockin' a Rollie, better have it ensured 
 This New Yorkers will stab a millionaire till he bleed riches 
 Cop work from uptown niggas, fuck Queens bitches 
 4 green killas run up in yo living room quick 
 Them boys at canal, see you lay yo clique on the strip 
 Nobody politics in Bed-stuy, who cares for that political shit? 
 We're robbin dog for his kibles and bits 
 Bushwick got beat cops, they actin' like they own the streets 
 That's why we drop 'em like a verse and lay 'em on the beat 
 Celebrate easter by goin' to Cony Island when heap 
 Just to have a slash out and bang it out on the beach 
 In Crown Heights they be workin them 2's, run hoop hoolups 
 Come around yo way or put yo turf on the news 
 Down town in Pican Ave got the flyest niggas 
 Youngins takin' over the trains, cursin over the loud speakers 
 Flatbush they be totin, lean yo top smoking 
 Since the trains had tokes them boys kept it locan 
 From LG to Albany we was born to be thorough 
 Cypress Hill's the kings but now we the king borough 
 I'm from Bang Bridge, we broke the law for the fun 
 The cats at Marcy will make you cough up a lung 
 Wherever you from, represent the hood you live 
 Well keep it that way, don't come across the Brooklyn Bridge 
 The mother ghetto went in first up, want the crook bone 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam 
 Y'all outsiders better come right, don't look wrong 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? 
 In the heaven of Bob, my hood, them pearly gates is locked 
 We the reason that cops traded 38's for Glocks 
 We the reason them cabs drive by, never trust you 
 We the reason you couldn't rock shines in the tunnel 
 Niggas be starin' and walkin', lookin' back 
 But I rob a nigga blind and ask him what the fuck he lookin' at? 
 Patrol cars just wanna get essential book in pack 
 Don't get caught in alleys with Brooklyn cats 
 Face the fact that what you worship 
 So I pray with my backs towards the serpent 
 Hit the underground and changed all the rappers to the circus 
 Celebrated Ike after he was murdered 
 Due tradition we had him cremated 
 Put his ashes in the shone and I wish I could've did magic when they burned him 
 'Cause the depths of this devilish fire within these matches don't deserve him 
 It's when life stay on the abs of the earth and where the staff givin' summers 
 Knowledge beneath the records of a target 
 Security stay harassin and lurkin 
 When a Brooklyn thug walk in the club, bounce his ass or skin they search us 
 Why pattin by my burners? You actin' like you nervous 
 Make a mistake and get shot by accident on purpose 
 7 were made, when they sever y'all faggots must've heard us 
 I area code have the same factors of a murder 
 Wherever you from, represent the hood you live 
 Well keep it that way, don't come across the Brooklyn Bridge 
 The mother ghetto went in first up, want the crook bone 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam 
 Y'all outsiders better come right, don't look wrong 
 My bud will light the tunnel crash, Brooknam
