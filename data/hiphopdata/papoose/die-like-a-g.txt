The life of a G 
 If my death is anything like my life 
 Then I'mma die like a G 
 Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me 
 I don't live in the Stuy, the Stuy live in me 
 Nigga what! Hit you up with the Mack 
 Nigga what! You ain't fuckin' with Pap 
 Sendin' shots at me, I'm bustin' 'em back 
 So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap 
 Ayo my bond is my life, my word is my bond 
 You pull the 2-5, I'mma pull the FoFo long 
 Niggas can't stop my reign, my buzz too strong 
 I was here when you came, I'll be here when you gone 
 Keep talkin' like you tough when you're singin' ya song 
 I blow ya head off, make the morgue sow it back on 
 Niggas catch beef in the night, and slip in the dawn 
 That's why the most bodies get dropped in the early morn' 
 When the body gets scooped up and shipped to the morgue 
 The killer go in the crib and pillow talk to his girl 
 Baby mom say she gon' send him where he belong 
 Call the cops that's what happens when the woman is scorned 
 At the end of most arguments somebody get warned 
 Always gotta be right, just admit when you wrong 
 Say you gon' ride through the hood and blow your chromes 
 But you just bop through the hood and blow your horn 
 If my death is anything like my life 
 Then I'mma die like a G 
 Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me 
 I don't live in the Stuy, the Stuy live in me 
 Nigga what! Hit you up with the Mack 
 Nigga what! You ain't fuckin' with Pap 
 Sendin' shots at me, I'm bustin' 'em back 
 So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap 
 Feel like I'm Tarzan, aw man, my girl Jane 
 My homies wild like the animals we all bang 
 Lookin' for this coward 'cause he owe me some small change 
 Heard he in the gambling spot, 
 How you gon' gamble while you owe me homie? 
 I ran up in the card game with that long thing 
 I'm puttin' dots on they heads while they playing poker 
 I ain't playin' with y'all lames, 
 Man I gave them niggas poker (polka) dots like Charmane 
 Sayin' they killers, man when they gon' start killin' 
 When blood starts spillin' y'all start sayin' y'all chillin' 
 Let them outta town niggas catch y'all slippin' 
 Pump work on the block, took food outta y'all kitchen 
 Flossed in ya parties, sexed all of y'all women 
 You runnin' round talkin' 'bout you ain't got no hard feelings 
 You ain't got no hard feelings 'cause you're really a broad 
 This nigga soft, I don't feel him if his feelings ain't hard 
 If my death is anything like my life 
 Then I'mma die like a G 
 Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me 
 I don't live in the Stuy, the Stuy live in me 
 Nigga what! Hit you up with the Mack 
 Nigga what! You ain't fuckin' with Pap 
 Sendin' shots at me, I'm bustin' 'em back 
 So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap 
 Cause snatch you sharks out the ocean, and watch you die 
 Take you guppies out the fish tank and let you dry 
 Kill you piranhas at at the blink of an eye 
 But I ain't thinkin' 'bout you I got some bigger fish to fry 
 'Cause when a nigga live the thug life and somebody hit 'em 
 The family always wanna blame the person who with 'em 
 So if you was with your homie and y'all got hit up 
 And he ain't make it and you make it then you better grip up 
 Now it's more homicide, more bloodshed 
 Cause all they really wanna know is why you ain't dead 
 A nigga follow my whip I ain't gon' scream and shout 
 I'mma lead 'em to his death, that's what I'm about 
 Call my homie on the cell, you chillin' no doubt 
 These niggas followin' the whip, they must think I'm a slouch 
 I'mma ride through the block, by the club house 
 When you see the car behind me, air that shit out 
 If my death is anything like my life 
 Then I'mma die like a G 
 Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me 
 I don't live in the Stuy, the Stuy live in me 
 Nigga what! Hit you up with the Mack 
 Nigga what! You ain't fuckin' with Pap 
 Sendin' shots at me, I'm bustin' 'em back 
 So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap
