I believe 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I'm feelin' grouchy, saucy, hungry 
 Rolocini, new sex, lookin' for bruised necks and blondies 
 Won't make 'em baby mommies, I just wan 'em to swallow me 
 Sometimes that be the only thing that calms me 
 Police be actin' like Starsky and Hutch 
 These fucks scheming so they could charge me 
 Cops needs colors so they could feel bossy 
 You tryna get yo colors up, you think you Fonzy? 
 I eat a lot of fish and parsley 
 Green vegetables, sweet peas and broccoli 
 Drink a lot of water so it could wash me 
 My homie told me stop eatin rappers, he tryna starve me 
 I ain't startin trouble but pardon me 
 Rappers get a little hard and start actin' cocky 
 Maury Povich need to swab me 
 These dudes used to be my sons like Charles Barclay 
 You think you Scarface? I bet the shower to you 
 Get rid of Tony like mellow in a maldy 
 Man, that's word to Gadhafi 
 Your war stories put me to sleep, I need some coffee 
 Bragging bout old work, that's beyond me 
 You ain't put in no work since a tardy 
 Man, you washed like the laundry 
 You a ex murderer like Ashanti 
 The back of the club, that's where the gods be 
 Being all that we could be, me and my army 
 They said I can't rock a party 
 Give me the mike, I'm a rocket, they better launch me 
 My music is judged harshly 
 Everybody making comments, they wanna blog me 
 Knowledge of the game they posses hardly 
 I call 'em a bunch of meatheads like Archie 
 Haters say they wanna stomp me 
 I know how to weave and bob, no Marley 
 Dig my way up out of a grave if I get bodied 
 Dug er, dug er, they better bury me under concrete 
 Yeah, king of New York 
 Yeah yeah, I'm the king of New York 
 Yeah yeah, king of New York 
 Yeah nigga, I'm the king of New York
