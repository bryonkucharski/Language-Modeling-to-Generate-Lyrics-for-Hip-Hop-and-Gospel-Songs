I'm a new yorker down town Brooklyn worker 
 Payphone talker it only cost me a quarter 
 I'm thirsty new york summer hot as a sauna 
 Put my mouth to the fire hydrant and drink some water 
 We try to stop a yellow cab but he ignored us 
 He just splash mud in my face 'cause of my aura 
 No camera phones it was just cam corders 
 But we made movies sprayed ozzies transformer 
 Intellect speaker fresh snikers dear dorers 
 When we put the work in the pot it dance on us 
 I used to re up up town transporter 
 Hood swag, book bag, jams porter 
 Five o' clock news somebody got out of order 
 People waving over the shoulders of news reporters 
 Hi mom, hip hop we cypher of the corner 
 I spit till I was tired, alphabetical slaughter 
 Still it's the dark side of divine 
 Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind 
 You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme 
 Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind 
 But still yeah, it's the dark side of divine 
 Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind 
 You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme 
 Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind 
 Girls toes hanging out of their sandals 
 I rush home so I can watch Ralph McDaniels 
 Back then the gun charge was only a year 
 Walkman, my headphones over my ears 
 It takes 2 I used to listen to raw beats 
 My tape pop I tape it back together with scotch tape 
 We ain't had metro cards we had tokens 
 Andree the Giant got slammed by Hulk Hogan 
 Chicken pox passed the call on my allusion 
 David Takens black folks started hoping 
 White folks caught not snitching the gag order 
 Italians call it a code of silence they blast talkers 
 Blacks, they wanna put the label of rats on us 
 So they encourage us to tell then they laugh on us 
 No other race do it they want their soul to be gone 
 Snitching is not a street thing it's just morally wrong 
 Still it's the dark side of divine 
 Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind 
 You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme 
 Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind 
 But still yeah, it's the dark side of divine 
 Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind 
 You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme 
 Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind 
 It's just another New York night 
 It take a certain level of conscience to comprehend my message 
 So I understand why you hate on me man 
 I don't expect to be seen by he side of the blind 
 Hip hop is in my blood 
 You gotta make me bleed if you wanna get rid of it 
 So in that note, I remain 
 The most hated alive 
 Most hated alive 
 Most hated alive 
 Peace
