You wish that I would die 
 Don't want me alive 
 Tell me who am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 I wonder why 
 I'm such a nice guy 
 Who the fuck am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 Everytime I dress fly 
 You hate my suit and tie 
 Tell me who am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 Everytime I kick a rhyme 
 You criticize 
 Who the fuck am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 Dear hater, you yea hater 
 Why you still hating on me 
 Years later 
 Y'all can't tell me nothing damn haters 
 I don't speak hater language get a translator 
 I'm in the hood 'cause I'm hood fly as a Rolls Royce 
 You in the hood 'cause you ain't got no fucking choice 
 And if you ain't a pussy why you so fucking moist 
 You weak jealous motherfucker, puppy voice 
 You know them haters who smiling but really mad at your fame 
 Everytime you get something new they say they had it already 
 Faster hate but they really slow 
 Try to tell 'em something they say they already know 
 But they don't really know they just act like it 
 Why you ain't hit the lotto now if you so fucking psychic 
 You wish that I would die 
 Don't want me alive 
 Tell me who am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 I wonder why 
 I'm such a nice guy 
 Who the fuck am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 Everytime I dress fly 
 You hate my suit and tie 
 Tell me who am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 Everytime I kick a rhyme 
 You criticize 
 Who the fuck am I? 
 The most hated alive 
 I was around the way with my mens, on the corner 
 Standing up straight in my stands 
 This girl pulled up around her way in a van 
 She jumped out started shaking my hands 
 She said from all of the Brooklyn rappers you my favorite man 
 I said, thank you, you my favorite fan 
 This other rapper heard I'm taking his fans 
 He gotta do something about it, he taking a stance 
 Disconnected from the lane straight away from the land 
 'Cause he was the weakest link on a chain of command 
 Swear it just came out had a dangerous plan 
 He started a chain of hate so they hate on your man 
 When he hated you coming after you connecting yourself 
 To a long chain of hate that started with another rapper 
 Twitter monkey you not a loaner you're a borrower 
 Fall from a leader now I see why they call them followers 
 Hating is a sickness, get well soon 
 Most hated alive, boy 
 You wish that I would die 
 Don't want me alive 
 Tell me who am I? 
 The most hated alive
