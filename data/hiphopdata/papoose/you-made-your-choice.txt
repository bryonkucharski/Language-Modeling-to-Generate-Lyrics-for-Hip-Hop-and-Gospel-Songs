This is our bump in the road 
 There's no where to go, no no 
 You made your choice 
 Place, BK, what's the occasion? 
 Party around the wait 
 You DJin, of course K-slate 
 Your favorite day of the week, payday 
 You fuckin' wit me hold on, ay ay 
 She my sister like Brandy and Ray-J 
 What's the name of your clique, thug-a-thug-acation 
 That's not a gang, it's an organization 
 How many awards you won, 'bout a deuce 
 What's your name fool, Papoose, Pa Poose 
 The industry ain't prepared for us 
 They ask questions, ain't understandin us 
 We be rappin' over tracks that they scared to touch 
 Came to my show, everybodies hands was up 
 He was hidin in the basement, I was tearin it up 
 Told Sn?? now I'm callin your bluff, "Hello" 
 Whenever you call me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you need me, I'll be there 
 I'll be around 
 So I'm like Scarface, I'm sittin' the the jaccuzi 
 One hand on my dick, other hand on my uzi 
 Shorty blockin the TV wit her booty 
 Whatchin the 50 flick, them bootleggers sold me the movie 
 I'll be givin' the grand for cheap usely 
 But tell 'em lil niggas gonna pawn their jewelry 
 It's the cash, y'all know what this is, throw me the stash 
 The words that I spoke unto light show me the path 
 Them other ghetto gave me a gun, told me to blast 
 Learn to pass master my mack ?? to flash 
 It's the Nas ??, a dream, the dream of life 
 I paid the price, spent through my nights, I need the light 
 Cops hold the keys to your chains, and read your rights 
 It's hard to get your mind to believe your life 
 This struggle keep me feelin' doom, hopin these clouds will clear the moon 
 I heal the wounds, give my kids the silver spoon 
 This is a our bump in the road 
 There's no where to go, no no 
 You made your choice 
 Streets, we was entertainment, stay on the rise 
 Old dogg behind me slay on my side 
 We don't stop for nutin, we stay on the grind 
 Every Wednesday, catch us on Shade 45 
 Every Thursday, catch us on live Hot 9 
 You can call me, my number 5-9 nevermind 
 Niggas say I'm light in the ass, I say whatever 
 I weigh as much pounds as Floyd Mayweather 
 Listen homie I hit the bag, let's get together 
 I run these MC's like I'm tougher than leather 
 You really think your artist nice, he on the brink 
 Of becomin the next nigga, he your weak link 
 Put him next to me, if that's what you think 
 I make him look like shit, that nigga stink 
 They havin' battles with the Jackets??, I'm gonna creep 
 Sayin' yeah you better watch out for me with the mix, never call me 
 Whenever you call me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
 Even if I have to call, I'll be there 
 I'll be around
