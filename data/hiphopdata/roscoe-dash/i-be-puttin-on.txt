We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome 
 We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong 
 Every day we party till early in the morn 
 Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on 
 I know you see me, yeah, I be putting on 
 I know you see me with your looking ass 
 What the fuck you looking at? 
 This is MMG and we don't speak to all you fucking crabs 
 Got a bunch of cash, but money is under, fam 
 I'd rather be over-prepared than slip in here understaffed 
 Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas 
 Just a double M, you can't fuck with them 
 Unless you're certified to ride with us 
 Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches 
 And I ain't tripping off of potential, that's another word for "ain't did shit" 
 Work, and I put D.C. on, we ain't been this high since the E.R 
 See y'all niggas be some peons, talking about y'all be gone 
 Whole time niggas wouldn't swing, playing tee-ball 
 We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome 
 We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong 
 Every day we party till early in the morn 
 Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on 
 I know you see me, yeah, I be putting on 
 Hundred thousands, hundred thousands, I be throwing hundred thousands 
 I know why they trusting me, 'cause I got all these funds around 'em 
 My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em 
 Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em 
 I know you think all we do is have fun around here 
 But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns 
 Don't single out any corner, its popping on every one 
 They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done 
 I'm running through cake, running through states 
 Take your one to the face every one or two cakes 
 Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space 
 Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga 
 We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome 
 We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong 
 Every day we party till early in the morn 
 Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on 
 I know you see me, yeah, I be putting on 
 I be cooler than a motherfucker 
 Wanna hit the fans, selling work on the Internet, call it Instagram 
 And you know I do it for my city, you know I'm putting on 
 Hundred racks on this clothes a nigga putting on 
 Self made, self paid, forty on my belt waist 
 Hundred round lobster feast, get a shell face 
 I be twisted off of molly doe, chopped bricks karate doe 
 Closet two floors, safari doe 
 Brown bag paper tag, nigga can't pay for swag 
 We know we love the game but we hate to brag, Montana 
 Me and Rozay twisted on a boat, watching all you fuck niggas choke
