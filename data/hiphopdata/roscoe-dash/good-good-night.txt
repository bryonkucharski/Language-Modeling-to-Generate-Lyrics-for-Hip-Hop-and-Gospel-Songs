How they let me go and get a beat from Kane? 
 I swear these 808s and snares make me go insane 
 Ay hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name 
 And let me be your Superman and you be Lois Lane 
 It's showtime like cable; get up on that table, 
 I love your sexy body and I know you love this paper 
 Bottles coming like they got legs on them 
 The way I kill 'em man this beat will 
 Make 'em wanna call the feds on me 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 ...And once I get you home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night 
 Good (good) night 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night 
 Good (good) night 
 (Man!) I got an open palm with cash in it 
 I could be up for MVP 
 I'm just tryna outdo my last visit 
 Pockets fat like they pregnant 
 And 'bout to have triplets 
 I got 20's flyin' send ghetto Benji to Ad Lib it (I do!) 
 Hah, get it, 
 I'm so far ahead 
 Of my time no C-section 
 Y'all club we V.I.P. section 
 Party bus full of women 
 Like weed next to me 
 Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin' 
 Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me 
 I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffey 
 And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty (50) 
 Bring a hundred more 
 Everybody gettin' tipsy 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 ...And once I get you home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night 
 Good (good) night 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night 
 Good (good) night 
 We gon' have one hell of a time 
 Girl I am feelin' fine 
 You know what's on my mind 
 Give it up (Please!) 
 This mad in my swisher got me fine 
 This switch on got my mind 
 Your sexy little body got me stuck; so what's really good 
 Girl I wish we really could do what we really should 
 I know yo' last boyfriend was only really good 
 Well I'm excellent - perfectionist 
 I creep up behind ya - no exorcist 
 That's that extra - real (real) extra (extra) 
 A different type of breed, an upgrade from that metric (metric) 
 It's time to make ya question all the rest you messin' with 
 I'm tryna tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 ...And once I get you home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night 
 Good (good) night 
 And we gon' have a good (good) night 
 Good (good) night (night, night) 
 Good (good) night
