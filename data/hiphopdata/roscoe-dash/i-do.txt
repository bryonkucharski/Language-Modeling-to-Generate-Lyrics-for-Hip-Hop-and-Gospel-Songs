I have all the swag, body bag 
 Life's a fucking party, I'm wasted, someone call a cab 
 Stumbling to the car but they keep asking for autographs 
 I'm going home with girls, girls, girls, yup, all of that 
 Tell me is it the fame or the money 
 Either way this people all think there must be something about me - stunning 
 Ah, everythang (I'm juiced up, I know the truth stuff) 
 'Cause everything I do is just actually too much 
 For y'all niggas 
 Oh yeah and I'm awesome over all niggas 
 Motherfucking dimes, I can't even see you small niggas 
 So pardon me (please) 
 I don't mean to brag 
 But I just spent 40,000 yen on these jeans I have 
 On baby 
 Oh yeah money long baby 
 You just your makeup on the waistline of my draws 
 I mean oh you can be the inspiration for my next song 
 Just motherfucking do with me and bust jimmy johns 
 I'm the bomb dot com 
 Shout out to my moms 
 It's Been a long time coming and we still going strong 
 We win it, can't let up 
 'Cause once these clowns forget us 
 It's gonna take a lifetime trying to make them unforget us 
 So I'm gonna represent us 
 From start and to the finish 
 I work hard to pay off 
 Ball - I gets the play off 
 You used to ball too, until you got laid out 
 Back in 95s damn I bet that's chaos 
 Life's about lessons, sit back and watch me teach 
 Like a game of badminton, I'm so out of reach 
 I'm at the finish line, give my winning speech 
 It goes "ahem, um" 
 But all y'all said I couldn't do it 
 I hope every time you grab a ... you forced to hear my music 
 You're so cubic, I'm so coolest 
 Got your girlfriend playing nudest 
 I'm, with no script, but I don't trip 
 Trust me I give a bat pri sa, means like aristocrat 
 No lady and the tramp but they were gifted cats we tripled that 
 I used to have problems, until I learnt to deal 
 I was taught to stay positive and always keep it real and I do 
 I do, I do, I do, I do 
 Oh, oh, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 I was taught to always keep it real it when I do 
 What I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (3x) 
 Do It 
 Stumble in the elevator, drifting down the highway 
 Drunk texed all my numbers, don't know who the fuck is calling 
 Feeling extra reckless I could probably use some counseling 
 It's a party at the condo, I don't really feel like talking 
 Feel like killing the party and these hoochies in Air Jordans 
 And pissing off all the bitches who wish that they could afford them, see um don't brag a lot 
 'Cause when you, have a lot 
 You don't, talk about it 
 You just, laugh a lot 
 And you just, walk it out, pop it out and stock it out, 
 But y'all bitter bitch ass haters don't know what I'm talking bout 
 Do you? 'Cause I do 
 The best I can me and my crew - the best of friends 
 And the niggas that ride for me will put to sleep the best of me 
 And stay in your place, pass the ace, and put a smile back on your face 
 'Cause it's a blessing to be next to the best dressed bitch up in this place 
 But I failed to mention that, um, I do this shit 
 While you other candy-coaters on that other ... box of goober shit 
 I rap sing and do it on another box of ... shit 
 And if you ask my haters probably tell you I'm a super bitch 
 Yeah, uh huh, that's 'cause I do this shit 
 'Cause I do it so right, and I do it so good 
 And I do it just like I said I would 
 'Cause I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do 
 I was taught to always keep it real it when I do 
 *What* I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (2x) 
 What I'm supposed to do
