How dey let me go and get a beat from Kane 
 I swear these 808s and snares make me go insane 
 Ay hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name 
 And let me be your Superman and you be Lois Lane 
 It's show time like cable, get up on that table 
 I love your sexy body and I know you love this paper 
 Bottles coming like they got legs on 'em 
 The way I killem man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 And once I get ya home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 We gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 I got an open palm with cash in it 
 I could be up for MVP 
 I'm just tryna out do my last visit 
 Pocket's fat like they pregnant, and 'bout to have triplets 
 I got 20's flyin' send get ol' Benjy to adlib it 
 Hah, get it, I'm so far ahead of my time no c-section 
 Yo club we V.I.P. section 
 Party bus full of women, like weed next to me 
 Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin' 
 Line full of sexy ladies try'n' get with me 
 I'm just try'n' grand slam like the boy Ken Griffey 
 And I'm at the bar nine shots, no fifty 
 'Bout to bring a hundred more, e'rybody get tipsy 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 And once I get ya home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 We gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 And we gonna have one hell of a time 
 Girl I'm feeling fine 
 You know what's on my mind 
 Give it up 
 This man in my swisher got me flyin' 
 This switch on got my mind 
 Your sexy little body got me stuck, so what's really good? 
 Girl I wish we really could do what we really should 
 I know your last boyfriend was only really good 
 Well I'm excellent, a sexual perfectionist 
 I creep up behind ya, deep inside ya, no exorcist 
 That's that extra shit, real long long extra thick 
 A different type of breed, a upgrade from that metric shit 
 It's time to make ya question all the rest ya messin' with 
 I'm try'n' tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with 
 I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron 
 Girl you better get a cup 
 And once I get ya home 
 Girl you better give it up 
 And we gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 We gonna have a good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 Good fuckin' night 
 And that's what I call a good fuckin' night 
 And, and we gonna have one hell of a time 
 Girl I'm feeling fine 
 You know what's on my mind 
 Give it up 
 This man in my swisher got me flyin' 
 This switch on got my mind 
 And your sexy little body got me stuck, so what's really good?
