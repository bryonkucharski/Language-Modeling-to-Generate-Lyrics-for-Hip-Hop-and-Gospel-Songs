How do you do the impossible 
 You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl 
 And in the way I can describe, 'cause what I'm feeling yeah 
 But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh 
 It's been since last summer time, since you went away 
 Still got your pictures on my window pain 
 Long nights, in a daze 
 Still remember how we did everyday 
 Tell me, tell me, have you ever 
 Did it underwater 
 And let it air dry on the stairs 
 The stairs, the stairs, the stairs, the stairs 
 And someone tell me what's the use for the bed 
 When you up in the air, the air, the air 
 I think she's far from what I'm used to 
 I'm lucky, it feels like holy revival 
 When she suck me 
 Pretty lips, pretty lips, pretty lips, pretty lips 
 All over me 
 We had champagne, champagne 
 We don't need a glass, we tired of being sober 
 She took the whole thang, she took the whole thang 
 And now I'm asking, is you straight 
 She said yeah quit talking boy switch up your tempo 
 She had her right backs, I'm the King Sacramento 
 And she loves it, she loves it, she loves it 
 When I stand up in that thang 
 Yeah got her saying 
 Now she saying 
 How do you do the impossible 
 You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl 
 And in the way I can describe, 'cause what I'm feeling yeah 
 But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh X2 
 Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do oh 
 Do do do, do do do do do-do do do oh 
 Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do oh 
 Do do do, do do do, do do do oh 
 How do you do the impossible 
 You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl 
 And in the way I can describe, 'cause what I'm feeling yeah 
 But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh 
 How do you do the impossible 
 You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl 
 And in the way I can describe, 'cause what I'm feeling yeah 
 But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh
