 Step it up, step it up, step it up, step it up 
 Break the knob off right now 
 Crumpin' or stuntin', do what ya wanna 
 I'ma crank the party up right now 
 Roscoe be so flexed up 
 And I make it look so effortless 
 I show out, show out, everywhere I go out 
 Ten bad models watch me when I go out 
 Oh, I know I go so hard 
 I'ma big dog stick out my yard 
 Press record 'cause you gon' wanna take this spaceship 
 Takin' off on a one way to Mars 
 So you turn up regardless 
 Show out and go the hardest 
 Go dumb, go dumb, go dumb 
 Lose control and go retarded 
 See I got my own steps 
 And I got my own style

 When the DJ turn the track up, boy 
 'Cause all these haters in the club must really wanna see the 
 Teddy Pizzle act up, boy, clap, clap, clap, clap, boy 
 On the nude dance floor and I take your girl 
 To the show and tell 
 And if I perform well 
 That's gon' give her more to tell 
 Do just what we doin', girl 
 Don't even know what she doin', homie 
 If she take this trip again 
 You will never fit again 
 Steppin' in and out, I got my own step 
 My own clique 
 Lovin' on that chick I left her 
 In that club like, oh, shit 
 Oh, it's 
 Just another one of them classic T-Pain antics 
 Got her makin' up brand new dances 
 She get low to the ground like ants is 
 Every time I put on Antaris 
 All she think about is marriage 
 Homie, you can't pull no girls 
 You're like a horse without a carriage 
 Damn, I don't even know how many karats in my chain, chain 
 Buddy, do I have to explain, 'splain? 
 Nobody on the corner got swagger like us 
 You got yours from T-Pain

 Because I party, party, party, hardy 
 Shorty, go retarded, 'tarded 
 Gon' and do yo dance and

 Show 'em you're the man 
 Or woman and can't nobody 
 Else do it like you can 
 Gon' and break it down, break it down 
 Break it down, break it down, do it with no hand 
 Ain't no copy cats around here
