Yeah 
 You a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, ugh 
 (Big Sean) Boi, Do It 
 Let's go 
 Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
 When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
 I'm a take my time (yeah) 
 Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
 Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
 Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
 Yeah 
 She love the way I'm doin' it 
 So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it 
 Bottom line is, you the finest 
 Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?) 
 My bitch 
 Hold up, hol' up, whoa there 
 Let's capture this moment if I hit it then I own it 
 Marijuanin every mornin' 
 And Patronin', girl, we groanin' 
 But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on 
 Street lights on, on? 
 Cause' ya know I got it goin' till it's... 
 Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
 When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
 I'm a take my time 
 Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
 Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 So just let the song play 
 The long way 
 The strong way 
 It's our day 
 It's our way 
 This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
 Talk to the, talk to the, hand 
 Bitch, you talkin' to a grown ass man 
 It's, like way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak 
 (There goes the bed sheets) 
 Err'ybody rip the swag off 
 'Fore I rip the tag off 
 Why my pants sag off, 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off 
 Flow so ugly, money so handsome 
 This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem 
 Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
 When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
 I'm a take my time 
 Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
 Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 So just let the song play 
 The long way 
 The strong way 
 It's our day 
 It's our way 
 This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 I don't really wanna uh... talk too much shit 
 But you love it when I talk like I lost it 
 And I love how you look when ya blazin' 
 And I swear you turn at least half asian 
 And we 'bout to have a liaison 
 She's so cool, give head with her shades on 
 You should just go and throw a cape on 
 And it's just so amazing 
 So amazin' 
 So amazin' 
 Take it to the car, (bloop, bloop), that shit look like I'm speed racin' 
 Leave 'em with me, it'll boost your reputation 
 Westside is where I'm stationed 
 Spend all night, just champagne tasting 
 Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it till it's 
 Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
 When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
 I'm a take my time 
 Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
 Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
