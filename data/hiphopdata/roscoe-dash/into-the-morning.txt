Every day we hit the club, and party hard 
 All on the furniture with no regards 
 I'm faded, bring me three more bottles 
 Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model 
 Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow 
 We gonna take this party on into the mornin' 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Into the morning) 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Into the morning) 
 I'm faded, bring me three more bottles 
 Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model 
 Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow 
 We gonna take this party on into the mornin' 
 Turn it up like every day 
 Only question which club Imma hit today 
 Might flex up and get bit today 
 Make it rain and pay somebody's rent today 
 Haters don't know what to say 
 Club feel like the first of the month today 
 Free shots for the girls in the front today 
 Hit the pussy, hit the blunt more than once a day 
 Miami going hammy 
 Standing on the furniture 
 We in the reckless mind state 
 Don't act like you ain't heard of us 
 We shut this city down 
 You gonna know when we around you 
 Where? where a group of bitches when a fist 
 When I test this ticket, wet I made her you can drown in there 
 Man it's fine I'll be good in the morning 
 Got some women who are down to performing 
 Got a camera with a light that's recording 
 I knock 'em out, knock 'em out, George Foreman 
 Yeah, two times on a Sunday 
 What a lil' brother got to 'em goin' one way 
 When the night falls, get sun in your life 
 Feels like one big party all in one day 
 Every day we hit the club, and party hard 
 All on the furniture with no regards 
 I'm faded, bring me three more bottles 
 Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model 
 Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow 
 We gonna take this party on into the mornin' 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday (into the morning) 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday (into the morning) 
 I'm faded, bring me three more bottles 
 Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model 
 Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow 
 We gonna take this party on into the mornin' 
 Wale DC said we aren't yo 
 And I'm out here accept with a lil' help 
 With a couple me and Jones all on 
 Gone race all mornin' shawty need a poncho 
 And that's all the time 
 Call you anything but I can't call you mine 
 'Cause I'd be lyin' 
 Y'all be fine, chase bread with my dog motherfucker feline 
 Let's hit the floor 
 Came with one but I get with four 
 Lick the sto, let's just smoke 
 She ain't really sick of this but she let me blow 
 That's Roscoe flow 
 Ran to the birds, yo, Flacko ho 
 Best round here 'case y'all don't know 
 When I'm done getting' brain then I honor roll 
 Then I'm off in the morning 
 I don't know these hos 
 I'm just in love recording this, Oh shit back up porn fly shit 
 Size 9 fly kicks, my body dimes, ill sweater Bill Cosby 
 Every day we hit the club, and party hard 
 All on the furniture with no regards 
 I'm faded, bring me three more bottles 
 Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model
