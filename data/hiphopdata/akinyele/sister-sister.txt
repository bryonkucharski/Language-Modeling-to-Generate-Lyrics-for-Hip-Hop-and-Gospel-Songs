(Tanya Howard and Niguay Fa) 
 I'll be your friend 
 Though I love you like my brother 
 I could never be your lover, baby 
 Hook: (Akinyele), (Tanya Howard) 
 Sister, Sister (You're like a brother to me) 
 Sister, Sister (We go back like family) 
 Sister, Sister (Nigga I knew you ever since day one) 
 Sister, Sister (Man, me and you be having mad fun) 
 (Akinyele) 
 Yo girls be acting like they my sister 
 What the fuck 
 You mess around and get your sister' ass 
 Inscest up 
 Talking about you can't buy them like your brother and shit 
 But we don't got the same father never suck on the same mother tits 
 So how you come to this 
 Putting lego sticks 
 On my dick 
 Cause you cop-blockin' and shit 
 (Akinyele) 
 We used to conversate and shit 
 For a little bit 
 You told me about the guys you hit 
 You said I probably lied about the girls 
 In the world that I said I done hit 
 But I let it pass 
 With a simple laugh (ha ha ha ha) 
 Cause it was the beginning 
 So I stay smilin' and grinnin' 
 Even when you joked and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of 
 Fucking crushed linen (that shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen Ha ha) 
 Anyway ha ha ha ha ha 
 Had to find that funny 
 So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money 
 Na na na I ain't said that I ain't said that chill chill 
 This is what I said 
 Listen, a yo, listen, listen 
 Yo, Everytime I try to set it off 
 You be like Nope 
 Quick to call the kid up every time you broke 
 Talkin' about some nigga played you out 
 Slapped you in your mouth (yo he slapped me in my mouth) 
 And if I see him you want me to react like pullin' out on him (yo pull out on 
 Him) 
 Risking mafias as I let some kids' blood spill 
 While you run around town talkin' about (yo nigga I'll get you killed) 
 Girl don't get me wrong 
 I'm not no duck and shit 
 Before I make moves like that 
 I got to at least fuck and shit 
 Bust a nut and shit 
 In your gut and shit 
 Fuck you down 
 Turn you around 
 In your butt and shit 
 (Akinyele) 
 This right here 
 Is every brother who got a artificial sister 
 This is your theme song, yo 
 This is your theme song 
 This is your theme song 
 (Tanya Howard and Niguay Fa) 
 I'll be your friend 
 Though I love you like my brother 
 I could never be your lover, baby 
 (Akinyele) 
 National anthem 
 Yo this song right here is dedicated to 
 All the girls who want to be some dude's sister 
 So she could try to get all the priviliges of being a dudes girl 
 Without fucking that mother fucker 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 (Akinyele) 
 It's the ak' ak'
