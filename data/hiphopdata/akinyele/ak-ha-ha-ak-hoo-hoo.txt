It's the ak ha ha, the ak hoo hoo (Akineyle) 
 Verse One: 
 Yo, y'all know what's about to happen 
 When I proceed to give you what you need and the Ak start rappin' 
 I throw rhymes like children throwin' balls on project bricks 
 In other words I be kickin that old off the wall shit 
 I don't rehearse they don't come better than 
 I don't need light, 'cause I'm a late night person like David Letterman 
 You know the whole repoitoire not far from a star 
 Baby Pah, the Ak can shine like ArmorAll 
 Verse Two: 
 Akineyle, producing more stunning hits 
 So call me Ex-Lax, 'cause I'm about ready to start runnin' shit 
 Toss and TURNIN' ya, watch Ak BURNIN ya 
 You can't hold your own you fuck around and catch a HERNIA 
 (Akineyle) 
 So don't sleep, nor yet drowsing 
 My name itself bring more Heartbeats than Robert Townsend 
 I hurdle over rappers like a stallion 
 Carry it back with more Fame than Debbie Allen, nigga 
 Verse Three: 
 My lyrics'll reign real bright so dim the lights and it won't get DULLER 
 It doesn't take Rosie Perez to see my living COLOR 
 I rain over heads just like an UMBRELLA 
 So strong that baby's boosted and I'm FULLER 
 History in the making, never one for backspins 
 Throw and kneel, but you're still, MC's I be BREAKIN 
 Ak saniTATION 
 I leave skid marks on the concrete streets 
 From all the brothers that I be scrapin 
 Verse Four: 
 Permanent scars as I sabotage 
 My style's so milky I should get down with Haagen-Daaz 
 More heatwave than a do rag does to a CAESAR 
 Give a thermometer a temperature of jungle FEVER 
 George like WHEEZY 
 'Cause I be burnin brothers just like, the neighborhood SKEEZER 
 Once the hip-hop strangeler 
 I throw your whole rap on a coat rack kid and just hang it up 
 Verse Five: 
 So step to the AK-ER, the hip-HOPPER 
 And get your ass kicked like a game of SOCCER 
 Skills are fatter than a grease spot 
 'Cause I love to rock that nasty home-cooked hip-hop 
 I watch girls check it, I make bitches wanna jump butt-naked 
 Like the Doo Doo Brown record 
 But now I peep on low and they have to stop 
 When they hear my name, the motherfuckin Ak
