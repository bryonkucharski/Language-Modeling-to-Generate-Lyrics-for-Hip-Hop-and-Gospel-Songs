(McGruff) 
 (Check it, Yo!) 
 Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream 
 Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters 
 Being my mansion, chilling inhalin the ganja smoke 
 Counting mad cream, weighin tons of coke 
 Guarded by thugs and rottweilers 
 I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars 
 Niggas get plugged when my glock collers 
 Skunk smokers, philly and aisle ripper 
 Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for awhile nigga 
 'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos 
 Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls 
 East coast west coast fiends overdose 
 'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost 
 (Murda Mase) 
 This money be temptin me, to jump out the MPV, empty 3 
 Clips of hollow tips with no sympathy 
 Since 14 I sold morphine for more green 
 Kept open a nautica coat under the draw sting 
 And watched out for cops, squad cars, and beamerz 
 And laundry ninas 
 Flea the country to Argentina 
 Laid back in the beach (yeah) 
 Coastin with commuters 
 Smokin' the buddahs, on the cruiseline boat to Aruba 
 For awhile yo, pump the vowel so, I can pile dough 
 Then become a Harlem Kingpin just like Al Po' 
 Get paid so, I can lay low, in San Diego 
 With yay-o so I can ship it out whenever I say so 
 Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream 
 East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean 
 Whether its Uptown, Downtown you pick the scene 
 You gots to get your own scheme 
 We ain't splitin this cream 
 (Killa Kam) 
 Yo! Imma run hestrically, till they bury me, count numerically 
 Hills of Beverly, more grands than cherokee 
 President like Eric B., and Rakim 
 Drug game I'm top ten, locked in, right now it's not an option 
 And those who creep, got the Mac in the heat 
 They got the 5 inch screens in the back of the seat 
 And now they got to steady braggin 
 Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready when heavy 
 Was back tossed me in the paddywagon 
 But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love 
 'Cause we was 12 years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' Bub 
 So Hall of Fame without the fortune, Goddamn you wrong 
 Killa kid Kama'Ron surviving in the Amazon 
 (BloodShed) 
 Yo! I leave you dazed and froze 
 With all kinds of amazing flows 
 Money surrounded I counted with bathing with Asian Hoes 
 Back home niggas is after me 
 I'm back to sea sippin daquiri's 
 Coke factory, fiends baggin up crack for me 
 From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks 
 Nautica yachts, and knots busting outa my socks 
 Now that's bloods play the chub 
 All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby 
 Behind my back they say my babys ugly 
 Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini, jeeps 
 Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets 
 Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan 
 Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs 
 Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream 
 East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean 
 Whether its Uptown, Downtown you pick the scene 
 You gots to get your own scheme 
 We ain't splitin this cream 
 (Big L) 
 Check It 
 To be sittin' clean, in the mean beams is every teams dream 
 Big L's a Cream Fiend, with more green than Springsteen 
 Yo know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie 
 I'm known to mack a hoochie, do I got stacks of lucci? (absolutely) 
 Harlem Kids is known for felonies, and sellin keys, pushin 300z's 
 Gee-Es- 3's, and puffin trees, these Gees breeze while Dee-Tees 
 Be yellin' freeze, we stash cheese while keepin' pockets full of centuries 
 Aye-Yo I'm set for the rest of my life 
 Some clown that laid the threat 'cause I had sex with his wife 
 I stuck my tool to his brain, so that fool can get slain 
 Nigga, yo' bitch choose me, you know the rules to the game 
 Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream 
 East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean 
 Whether its Uptown, Downtown you pick the scene 
 You gots to get your own scheme 
 We ain't splitin this cream
