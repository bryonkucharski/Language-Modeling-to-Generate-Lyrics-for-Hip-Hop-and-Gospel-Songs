Yo. 1, 2, 1, 2. G'ahead, drop it 
 Yeah 1, 2, 1, 2. I go by the name of the Big L. Know what I'm saying? 
 Rock this for Rock N. Wills. Hardpack tape 
 A'ight. Goes like this 
 Ay yo. I've got the gift of gab 
 To lift and grab 
 The mic and recite hype rhymes 
 That'll rip and rag 
 And drag a fag MC 
 Who likes to nag a lot 
 And brag a lot 
 Talking about the lyrics that he has are hot 
 Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop 
 Rhymes I hook up 
 MCs I cook up 
 Like Campbell's soup 
 I throw rhymes like a quarterback 
 Front and you'll get bust 
 And dust 
 And crushed 
 Bum rushed 
 And all of that 
 Rhymes never sound wack 
 'Cause I've got them down packed 
 For you the time is over 
 So give me your crown Jack 
 I get hype fast 
 And MCs might last 
 A minute with me 
 Because their rhymes are light as 
 A feather and mine are heavy like a big brick 
 Rappers catch a fit quick 
 When I start to kick shit 
 And I record my battles on a camcorder 
 So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter 
 MCs that tried to get with me, hops 
 That's why they all got taken out like a pizza box 
 The crown is still mine 
 'Cause I kick ill rhymes 
 A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time 
 Or beat eggs or whip cream 
 I'm smoother than Vaseline 
 And I'm a stone cold rapping fiend 
 A lot of new jacks are coming out, but that's cool 
 'Cause I'm the principal of the new school 
 A'ight. Check this out another joint like this 
 A'ight. Check it out 
 I control the microphone like a robot 
 My lyrics are so hot 
 Props: I've got a whole lot 
 'Cause with a pen and some paper this man made 
 Rhymes: they're so damn great 
 With flavour like pancakes 
 I'm kicking rhymes like a game of kickball 
 I'm rough like a brick wall 
 MCs take a big fall 
 For trying to get with this 
 I'm too swift for this 
 A microphone murderer form of magnificence 
 A def rapper and also a swell one 
 In a battle I cook MCs well done 
 My hits are consecutive 
 I'm a lyrical executive 
 Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live 
 So to be safe on the microphone homes 
 Recite your own po'ms 
 Or get your dome blown 
 Or put in a boot camp 
 L's the new champ 
 I'm not the kind to go out like a? 
 I'm throwing rhymes like a pitcher throws a curveball 
 And I'm a serve all 
 Punks that try to brawl 
 So stop sleeping on me 
 Don't even dose hops 
 Or I'm a heat you up 
 And eat you up 
 Like Stove Top 
 Stuffing 
 I'm bum rushing 
 Shorts: I'm taking none 
 My rhymes weigh a ton 
 I'm not faking son 
 You're the one whose faking, trying to be a duplicate 
 Can't kick stupid shit 
 Tell you the truth: you should quit 
 Rapping 
 Start snappin 
 'Cause all you is a joke 
 Battle L and get smoked 
 Yo. I over throw ya 
 And have you screaming like a rollercoaster 
 Guzzle you down like a small cup of Coca-Cola 
 I'm going though MCs like a ransack 
 Stand back 
 As I cruise 
 Smooth 
 Like an Amtrack 
 Your rhymes are rusty G 
 You can't fuck with me 
 That's why you're hiding in protective custody 
 L's not the one an' 
 I keep MCs runnin' 
 I hurt them like bunions 
 Make them cry like onions 
 I'm a lyrical fighter 
 And I'm brighter 
 Than Einstein 
 Try to bite my lines 
 And get a size nine 
 Foot 
 Put 
 In your ass for being a crook 
 Hit with a vital hook 
 And get your title took 
 Pass it to my man 
 (Someone else) 
 Ha ha. ??? got flavour 
 Keep that flowing 
 (Big L) 
 I'm the microphone murderer 
 And I'm known for busting mad caps 
 I rip and rag tracks 
 With rhymes that back slap 
 Causing a nightmare 
 I don't fight fair 
 Niggas playing hard rocks hoping they might scare 
 The B-I-G L, but I'm not to be fucked with 
 You're trying to take your idol's 
 Title 
 You're on some buck shit 
 I keep the women fiending for my smooth shit 
 My rhymes are mad thick 
 And yours are dead as a poo stick 
 Fuck it 
 Bus it 
 I like it rough and rugged 
 Your style is wick wack 
 And played out like? 
 Bracelets 
 Face this 
 You can't erase this 
 Escape this 
 Break this 
 Take this 
 ? 
 I get so loose 
 On beats that I produce 
 Niggas be fronting crazy hard and got no juice 
 They're softer than paper plates 
 The lyrics I make is great 
 A few sheets of loose leaf 
 And an eraser mate 
 Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly 
 Mics I wreck and fry 
 Rappers I petrify 
 Pack a four fifth with eight shots 
 With one you get popped 
 And now your locked in a box 
 Dead with no props 
 I'm not joking. There's no time for snapping 
 Niggas that be yapping 
 I'm putting caps in 
 So ??? up 
 From the waist up 
 You'll be found face up 
 Cops can't trace up 
 Fingerprints. Why? Because I leave no evidence 
 Big L's the name, 139 is the residence 
 Peace
