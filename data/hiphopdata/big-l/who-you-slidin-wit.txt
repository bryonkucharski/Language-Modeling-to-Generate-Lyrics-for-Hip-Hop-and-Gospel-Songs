 I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste 
 She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test 
 We on the dancefloor, gettin' our boogie on 
 I see the haters watchin me with they hoodies on 
 Tryin' to peep the ice under the sleeve 
 I'm like, "It's time to breeze," told honey, "Let's leave" 
 Took her to Ema G's (?), got some eggs and cheese 
 Grits fishcakes and orange juice, freshly squeezed 
 When she finished her meal, I said, "What's the deal 
 For real - you goin' home or you tryin' to chill?" 
 She got close, whispered somethin' slow in my ear 
 And it ain't hard to tell where we goin' from here

 I'm a average nigga, then she said she was in the 6 
 My relationship, with that nigga called Jigga

 Guess I gotta be a ballplayin nigga to bone Da Brat 
 One bitch, I ain't even wanna fuck 
 She runnin' around, all open off Kurupt

 Told me she got a man and he's some beatmakin nigga named Stevie 
 What's wrong with these hoes? I'mma fly nigga 
 I don't wanna go flip Mo' to Rah Digga 
 Or Miss Lopez, bitch no feds 
 She used to be in the Bronx, rockin' Pro Keds 
 With some Dominican 'dro heads, ridin' on top this 
 On the back of mopeds, titties all out - what what?

 Is yo' game rusty? Around yo' dame, never trust me 
 Cause soon as you blink I'mma slide her off then bust three 
 And I only lay pipe to dimes 
 A lot of niggas I know are takin' care of kids that might be mines 
 I love to go low, I'm freaky like that 
 I never get caught creepin' 'cause I'm sneaky like that, uh 
 It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin 
 And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin' 
 Honey picked me up some dope shirts 
 It's because of me why she's walkin' crooked and her throat hurts 
 I hate to wait, 'cause I'm not on the patient tip 
 Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship 
 And when you mention my name, it ring a bell 
 Ask any female, nobody do it like L 
 I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda 
 Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda
