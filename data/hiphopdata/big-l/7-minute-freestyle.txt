(Big L) 
 Yo, check it 
 Yo, I got slugs for snitches 
 No love for bitches 
 Puttin' thugs in ditches 
 When my trigger finger itches 
 I got a rep that make police jet 
 Known to get a priest wet 
 I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat 
 Is Big L slow? Hell no 
 Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough 
 I'm known for yoking jacks 
 And beatin' them with smoking gats 
 Leavin' token blacks with broken backs and open caps 
 So with that bullshit, step to the rear son 
 The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one 
 Cause in a street brawl, I strike men like lightning 
 You see what happened in my last fight friend? 
 Aight then 
 I beat kids with lead pipes 
 I leave a trail of dead mic's 
 Where I'm from, niggaz jewels get ran like red lights 
 Old folks get mugged and raided 
 Crimes are drug related 
 And we live by the street rules that thugs created 
 Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts 
 For selling pounds of coke 
 Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat 
 I'm tellin' you shit is about to get drastic soon 
 I'm quick to blast a goon 
 And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon 
 I got the looks that make your hotty stare 
 I keep a shotty near 
 It's the nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear 
 Tracks I'm know to roast 
 Until the microphone is ghost 
 Props I own the most 
 I'm leaving niggaz comatose 
 Front and get your brain pinched 
 Big L will have your whole gang lynched 
 I started smoking dust and been insane since 
 This rap shit was a great gift 
 The other night some snake riffed 
 And got a hot lead face lift 
 All through high school I had braids 
 I kept mad blades 
 Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades 
 I cook the mic like a beef steak 
 Cause my techniques great 
 And I'm the nigga police hate in each state 
 'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper 
 Punk brother vamper 
 Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper 
 Cops drop when my glock makes a pow sound 
 I'm from a whyle town 
 You know my style clown, so bow down 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Brothers can beg and borrow 
 Still feel sorrow 
 When Jay-Z, like Zorro, get in that ass 
 Better luck tomorrow 
 I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush 
 You need slow down, or get your ass tore down 
 Check it out, I'm too cocky 
 To stop me, you gotta kill me 
 And when I'm gone, you can still feel me 
 On the real, B 
 The shit is eternal, I rock the Heavens well 
 Even if they won't let me in Heaven 
 I raise hell, till its Heaven 
 Recognize, the black cat with the nine lives 
 Get up off me, nigga, its bad luck to cross me 
 I'm poppin' Crystal, shooting game like missiles 
 As projected, all ho's affected by this style 
 I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldies 
 But the goody, pullin R&B bitches wearin hoodies 
 They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin 
 When I be goin', I be running the track like Jesse Owens 
 I disrupt the natural scheme 
 The way that you do things wit a swing and have 'em rockin' like... 
 You say never you run, if ever you come 
 It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won 
 Come on and ride the rhythm 
 I be producing like jizm 
 Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom 
 For greater understanding 
 I'm landing blows and 
 Knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha 
 Enticin when slicing through tracks 
 Your screaming, "Jesus Christ," he's back 
 And God knows he can rap 
 Me and L put rhythm on the map 
 So give him his dap 
 And me, I just take mine 
 Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that 
 You never see me stressed, in a GS 
 On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less 
 Jigga incredible 
 Even my thoughts is federal 
 Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption 
 So you know, beatin' me will never come 
 Like a nun or tomorrow, I'm too thorough, nigga 
 I make moves, cause bowels to move 
 When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes 
 Um. We're the peace like Islam 
 I make your eyes rise like yeast 
 Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all 
 Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars 
 Emcee's trying to be the best 
 And even in dying, couldn't be this def (death) 
 I see no reason to stop cheesin 
 Ever since L said "Throw three g's in" 
 And we can get down and split the wealth 
 That's when I found I could do it myself 
 I get up 
 (Big L) 
 My crew be deliverin hot lead when gats are clenched 
 Rappers I jack and lynch 
 Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events 
 Big L is the nigga you expect 
 To catch wreck in any cassette deck 
 I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet 
 I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate 
 My rap style is past great 
 I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake 
 I probably got your mommy strung 
 Niggaz hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung 
 My clan plans to get Guillianni hung 
 Never had a gassed head 
 Got loot 'cause I stash bread 
 Try to tax and I'ma beat your fagot ass half-dead 
 I stomp white cops till the life stops 
 For a low price hops 
 Cause my blood is colder than an ice box 
 On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war 
 Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor 
 And every time a mack eleven bucks 
 I'm killing at least seven ducks 
 I never was a follower of Reverend Butts 
 The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight 
 All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Miss Right 
 So we can never be a couple hun 
 Fuck love, all I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum 
 And clown emcee's I be attacking quick 
 I'm on some rappin' shit and some car jackin shit 
 I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black ac 
 And put the gat to his cap, click-clack 
 Sorry jack but get up out of that 
 My 38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate 
 I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate 
 He didn't listen to what I was speakin' 
 He started reaching 
 So I left him sleepin' with his temple leaking 
 Aight, back to my man Jay-Z 
 (Jay-Z) 
 As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage 
 And no I don't have it, I get it together like a marriage 
 I'm seeking all rappers, I'm on my p's and q's and carrots 
 Y'all don't understand, well, god-damn, don't you know my status 
 I'm flowing the fattest, mmmm that is, mmmm, I'm the baddest 
 No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters 
 For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow 
 Your thinking that's hollow, the rhythm is too rugged to follow 
 I hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam 
 Let me take a little breath... god damn 
 The kid is a wizard 
 I'm definitely destined to make eight digits 
 Met up with L on the road to riches 
 As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the, uh 
 Whatever I touch, whatever I clutch 
 You know I'm gonna end ya, uh 
 The nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey 
 Hahah, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in 
 Niggaz are do ducking I'm boo buckin, fuck it I'm whyle 
 But a boo boo boo bam, what you niggaz gonna do to the man? 
 I see you brought your little crew... and? 
 I'm still comin' with velocity, check it out 
 Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh 
 Ain't none of the clowns fuckin' around 
 Ain't none of clowns standing their ground 
 With the crowned prince of the underground 
 Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now 
 The heats on sweat now 
 Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town 
 Punk, jump up and get beat down 
 Check it out, check it out, check it out 
 Ladies be comin' out of their seats now 
 Shit I got crazy skills 
 It's a pity the way I'm ripping rugged rhythm through the city 
 Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty 
 I got rhythm, I, hit 'em with rhythm, I 
 Hit 'em and split em, I did em, I get rid of them guys 
 J-A, baby, baby please, gimme g's 
 Baby, baby, wit crazy ease 
 Watch Jay-Z get crazy G's
