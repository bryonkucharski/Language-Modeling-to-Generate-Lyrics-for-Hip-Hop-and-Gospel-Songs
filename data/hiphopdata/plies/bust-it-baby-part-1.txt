She my Bust it baby [6x] 
 1st time we had sex, it was like a movies 
 Both of us fell asleep, both of us was woozy 
 Love how she say my name, love how she do me 
 Gained feelings for her kinda quick, kinda blew me 
 Found myself thinking 'bout her, shit kinda spooked me 
 More time we spent together more she got attached 
 I love being around her, seem like the perfect match 
 She ain't blow my phone up and she ain't never hack 
 She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that 
 "What you doin" "Where you goin" questions she don't ask 
 She took my mind off the streets she helped me relax 
 She wanted to VIP her face she put me on my back 
 Her sex game crazy 
 Body so amazing 
 Kiss like she cravin 
 Walk like she taken 
 Attitude mistaken 
 Fiend for her daily 
 Care about her greatly 
 Why she my bust it baby 
 What we did last night got me wantin to call her 
 If I wasn't real homie I'd probably stalk her 
 From the hood, when she get drunk she talk proper 
 Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer 
 I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders 
 Worked it real good turned her round and doggystyled her 
 Told her if I gave her any more might have to charge her 
 Felt the vibe in the room the feelings getting larger 
 Took her from the bench and I done turned her to a starter 
 Tastes like sugar, smell like water 
 Now she into goons all off what I taught her 
 What I do to her make her care about me harder 
 Her sex game crazy 
 Body so amazing 
 Kiss like she cravin 
 Walk like she taken 
 Attitude mistaken 
 Fiend for her daily 
 Care about her greatly 
 Why she my bust it baby
