 Yo motto is you can't do the time then leave it lone 
 A sticky situation das when real niggas born 
 When niggas fucked up and you low das when you hold on 
 Ya main concerns das to make ya momma straight while you gone 
 You begged me not to worry about ya cause you can hold ya own

 We got jammed outa town car full of choppers 
 You looked me in my eyes and told me you would take the charges 
 Told you if we goin' down we goin' down together regardless 
 We always said we gunna leave this bitch how we started 
 As long as we got eachotha well fuck errybody 
 The love we got fo eachother it remain flawless 
 Ain't no money ain't no hoe in the world can spoil it 
 The niggas that turned on us priss but they werent tought it 
 If poems are real nigga you taught me how to shout it 
 Bein real is a blessin most niggas ain't got it 
 And why you fuck niggas mad at us we can't call it 
 When we die we want you to put us in the same coffin 
 You da realist fuckin' nigga I done met eva 
 To be your lil brotha dog is ma fuckin' pleasure 
 What you stand for ma nigga it can't be measured 
 I love you so fuckin' much bra I hope we die together 
 You da realist fuckin' nigga I done met eva 
 To be your lil brotha dog is ma fuckin' pleasure 
 What you stand for ma nigga it can't be measured 
 I love you so fuckin' much bra I hope we die together
