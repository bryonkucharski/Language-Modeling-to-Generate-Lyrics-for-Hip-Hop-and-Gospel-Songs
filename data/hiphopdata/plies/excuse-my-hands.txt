 Wit my hands I can make you do a lot of things

 Leave my fingerprints on every inch yo? damn frame 
 Wit this one finger I can make you get off the chain 
 Get that lick, gimme my hands, they get they own brains 
 They wanna touch ya, they wanna rub ya, they wanna feel yo? frame 
 Run my hands through yo? hair and go against yo? grain 
 Let me message ya baby and help ya ease ya pain 
 You wanna get comfortable?

 Wanna take my hands off, but I can?t, they just gon? call yo' name 
 If I can't squeeze and I can't hold ya it don't feel the same

 So jump up in dis Benz and let the seat back 
 I promise you gon' like da way I feel on you

 I said, ?Excuse my hands,? she said "Boy stop playin'? 
 Come make love to yo' number one fan, hello" 
 (Please excuse my hands) 
 Before I kiss ya or make love to ya, I wanna touch 
 Can you please face the wall? You 'bout to get strip searched 
 My hands talkin' to me, they want now what's under yo' skirt 
 Let me be the one that do the honors, help you wit yo? shirt 
 My hands don't like to be unemployed, they like to work 
 I been told my hands a little mannish, they like to flirt 
 God knows women the sexy thing he put on this Earth 
 My hand cravin? yo' little sweet body and it's gettin' worse 
 I wanna thank you and your body for helpin? me write this verse 
 My hands'll never leave yo? body, baby they so loyal 
 Do me a favor, look on the dresser and grab that baby oil 
 Ain't got to be the one that do it, my hands gon? spoil ya 
 Please excuse my hands 
 They just wanna touch 
 They just wanna feel 
 They don't mean no harm 
 Baby, just excuse my hands 
 Baby, please excuse my hands

 To squeeze on your behind 
 Baby, just excuse my hands

 Keep doin' it, keep doin' it, I swear I'll never leave 
 Keep doin' it, keep doin' it, keep doin' it shawty shawty
