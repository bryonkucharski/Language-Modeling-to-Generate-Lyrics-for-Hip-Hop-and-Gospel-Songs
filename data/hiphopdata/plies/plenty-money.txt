 What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds 
 Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted 
 I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed 
 'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money

 (Okay) 
 I like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign 
 Just bought another house, the last one was boring 
 Ten-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin' 
 These niggas dissin' me, it really ain't important 
 Take off yo shirt, nigga, I bet yo ribs showin' 
 You nigga starvin', my money over-flowin' 
 Jewelry game sick, got all these hos adorin' 
 Catch me in the club wit' all the 'gnac pourin' 
 If I ever go to prison, I'ma have plenty stories 
 Sleep real good, 'cause I ain't got no worries 
 Stay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin' 
 I got plenty money and all you niggas knowin' 
 What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds 
 Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted 
 I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed 
 'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money

 Next month, guess what, I'm buyin' rappers 
 'Cause I'm startin' to feel sorry for you lil' bastards 
 I'm pretty hot, yo career a disaster 
 I control you niggas, somethin' like yo master 
 Sixty-five grand, that's 'round ?? 
 Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar 
 I ain't fuckin' wit that ho 'cause she a dick hacker 
 Wanna know who I'm fuckin', my money, I just married her 
 She been good to me, I might 5-karat her 
 Ran me out the store, I bought too many plasmas 
 Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma 
 The old sayin' is, "The more money, the marrier" 
 What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds 
 Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted 
 I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed 
 'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money 
 (Okay) 
 Ion't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Mazerati 
 And what I paid for the "Goon" chain, one-forty 
 Scared to keep money on me 'cause I will blow it 
 My strip club name is "Mr. Will-Throw-It" 
 Keep fire on deck and I will show it 
 Fuck wit' me and get wacked and all you niggas know it 
 Scared to dance in the club 'cause my fire loaded 
 If you won't use it, guess what, then don't tote it 
 Mo' money, to most niggas, mean mo' hos 
 Mo' money, to me, it mean keep goin' 
 Haters gettin' tired, my money still growin' 
 Ball all night, catch a flight in the mornin'
