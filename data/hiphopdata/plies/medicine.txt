Baby, if you don't feel good right now 
 And yo' body hurtin' you right now 
 You just need a shot of me 
 I'm just like medicine 
 Shawty, I'm your insulin 
 Baby, I'm your insulin 
 I think ya need, I think ya need 
 I think ya need your medicine 
 Baby, I'm your insulin 
 Shawty, I'm your insulin 
 I think ya need, I think ya need 
 I think ya need your medicine 
 I'll be your prescription 
 Come and take a dose of me 
 Once you get a dose of me 
 You'll think that I'm your medicine 
 Shawty you my medicine, your medicine 
 I think I need, I think I need 
 I think I need my medicine 
 One teaspoon of me is something like a pack of blow 
 Too much of me too fast and you'll overdose 
 Treat you like a newborn baby, I'll feed ya slow 
 And if I really fuck with ya I'll give you a double dose 
 I'm yo' lil' double stack, pop me you'll really roll 
 Nighttime, daytime, I can give it to ya both 
 Anytime you want it, I can give it to ya that's for sure 
 Keep ya up all night I can be you No Doz 
 Need yo' prescription filled? Holla at me, let me know 
 Call me or text me, baby, when you need some mo' 
 I give you Becky, baby, when ya body sore 
 This is exclusive, you can't buy this in the store 
 Shawty, I'm your insulin 
 Baby, I'm your insulin

 I think ya need your medicine 
 Baby, I'm your insulin 
 Shawty, I'm your insulin 
 I think ya need, I think ya need

 Once you get a dose of me 
 You'll think that I'm your medicine 
 Shawty you my medicine, my medicine, your medicine 
 I think I need, I think I need 
 I think I need my medicine 
 I can shoot you anywhere, ain't gotta put it in yo' veins 
 Within the first two seconds, you will feel the change 
 Only discomfort that you might feel is good pain 
 One side effect of this medicine is butt-gain 
 A half a dose of me and I promise you won't be the same 
 Addiction to this medicine is common, don't be ashamed 
 And if you feel a lil' woozy after this just hold my hand 
 And I can numb yo' whole body just like Novocaine 
 I can make you come back, you can call me cocaine 
 And if you take this first dose good, I'mma up yo' range 
 On yo' prescription, it will read Plies name 
 The rest of yo' life, you will not accept no lames

 Once you get a dose of me 
 You'll think that I'm your medicine 
 Shawty you my medicine, my medicine, your medicine 
 I think I need, I think I need 
 I think I need my medicine 
 Call me when you feel bad, call me on yo' sick day 
 And I'll swing through and make sure yo' fever go away 
 I can make you sweat it out, sweat on me it's ok 
 Don't worry bout ya hair getting messed up it's ok 
 I'll get it redone for you, baby, I'll pay 
 And if it's top notch and it feel good, I'll stay 
 I drink straight 'Gnac, me no rosé 
 You want it, say I need my medicine that's all you gotta say
