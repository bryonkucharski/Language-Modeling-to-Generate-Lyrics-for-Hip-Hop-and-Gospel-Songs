Somebody loves you baby 
 Oh oh ooh 
 Somebody loves you baby 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Wish I could hug every nigga who done lost trail 
 And go see all da ones that visits inna while 
 To all da goons that's down Wish I can help 'em smile 
 To show my niggas I love 'em I'll walk a hundred miles 
 Bless my dawg who got killed in his own house 
 Help him pull through if they ont life support now 
 The only thang I live for is to make my son proud 
 My heart go out to all da young niggaz that's runnin' wild 
 I said ah prayer for all da mommas who done lost they child 
 That 12 year old who wanna fuck GOD slow it down 
 In life all dis? Help her to turn it round' 
 Please reach out nd Help her GOD before she drown 
 I know dat feelin' when it feel like nobody care 
 When you goin' through yo problems itseems like nobody there 
 I started question myself, "If GOD really care" 
 Sometimes I cut off all the lights in the room and stare 
 Wonder if he bought me this far To drop me off here 
 I know it seems sometimes like Life ain't fair 
 They say the only thing you can count on in dis world is prayer 
 I prayed so much I thought that GOD could'nthear 
 'Cause I done been through so much bullshit this pass year 
 It's hard to find muafuckaz 90 Sincere 
 The streets make it so hard for you to think clear 
 I'd give up all dis shit To have my brother here 
 I gotta call from my homegirl Her momma died 
 Somebody home invaded nd took her momma life 
 I just held the phone 'n' listened to her cry 
 She kept repeating herself All she asked was "why" 
 Could only imagine what she goin' through on the inside 
 'Cause when my brother went to prison Half me died 
 Ain't nuttin but pressures in the world homie they lyin' 
 U gotta take da good with da bad and take it and stride 
 The right amount of pressure could make you commit suicide 
 But imagine the pressure onna nigga who can't provide 
 When everything goin' wrong it's hard to do right 
 You goin' through it right now 
 All I wanna say is...
