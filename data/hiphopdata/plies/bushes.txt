Ay bra drop us off right here 
 Right here the blue house bra 
 Ay bra let's get in these bushes 
 When that fuck nigga get here he gets it 
 You don't know it but I done peeped where you stay pussy 
 Bitch you gettin' to yo house, I be right in yo bushes 
 Jump out with that choppa, actin' real foolish 
 Keep bullshittin nigga I'mma be right in yo bushes 
 You don't know it but I done peeped where you stay pussy 
 Bitch you gettin' to yo house, I be right in yo bushes 
 Jump out with that choppa, actin' real foolish 
 Keep bullshittin nigga I'mma be right in yo bushes 
 But get dropped off with them goons late night 
 We gone dug off with them choppas and sit tight 
 Lay right in yo bushes until you come back 
 And when we finish them crackas gone have to put you on ice 
 Nigga jumpin' up out them bushes ain't nothin' nice 
 We gone throw some shit but ain't gone be rice 
 Hollow points gone be whistlin comin' back to back 
 Nigga we murkin we ain't worried 'bout you buckin back 
 We ain't come for the money we come for yo life 
 Nigga we patient with this shit we'll lay all night 
 We done did it before laid till the sunlight 
 You don't know it yet but fuck nigga you gettin' wiped 
 Got on my monkey suit layin in this wet grass 
 Got me hot pussy I wanna give it to you bad 
 Soon as you turn up in this bitch we puttin' it on yo ass 
 Fuck niggas that run they mouths don't last 
 Me and my goons don't argue nigga we toe tag 
 You ain't do it right them crackas gone bring them body bags 
 Wanna see what you do when you see that ski mask 
 Want see you smile for that yoppa when you see it flash 
 We ain't gone let you get out we shootin through yo glass 
 Walkin' to yo car shooting that choppa lookin' mad 
 Bustin' from the front, the goons bustin' from the back 
 Clique of young niggas gettin' off in all black 
 My goons lurk all day lookin' for spots 
 Tryin' to find where you layin and what you got 
 Might done followed you home weither you know it or not 
 Until we peep something nigga we circling the block 
 Keep them yoppas on deck so we ready to squab 
 Nigga ridin' all mornin since 7 o'clock 
 I'm on yak they on pills we ready to wile 
 So if you slippin and we peep you we ready to plie 
 Four yoppas fifty rounds two hundred shots 
 All us ridin' with big toolies no glocks 
 All the yoppas off safety no locks 
 Better hope yo bushes ain't our next spot
