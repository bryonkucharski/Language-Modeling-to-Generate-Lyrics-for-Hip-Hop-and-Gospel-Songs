Aye can I please talk to my 
 Bust it babies real quick homie

 And let you know what I call lil' bust it baby

 If I wasn't married to the streets, it'd be you 
 Yo lips what make you so cute 
 Love when you poke yo mouth out when you mad too 
 Save your number in my phone under Lil Boo 
 Like your sex but more love what cha do 
 Turn me on how you stare at me when we through 
 When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose 
 Scared to moan around you, it's all I can say is "Ooh" 
 My favorite panties of yours the ones that's see-through 
 One wit the pink trim on 'em and they light blue 
 Speakin' for the goons, thank God for makin' you

 I just gave her a nickname, it's wet-wet 
 'Cause when we finished she mess up all my bedsets 
 She got something to relax me when I'm under stress 
 Never told her or let her know it, but she the best 
 She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest 
 If you had told me it was this good, I'da never guessed 
 She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next 
 But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck 
 And when she go out, she shut down the whole set 
 Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress 
 She like to do her own hair and get her own checks 
 My bust it baby I keep 'er on deck 
 She got me speedin' in the fast lane 
 Pedal to the floor mayne 
 Tryna get back to her love 
 Best believe she got that good thang 
 She my little hood thang 
 Ask around they know us 
 They know that's mine 
 Bust it baby 
 Everybody know that's mine 
 Bust it baby 
 Everybody know that's mine
