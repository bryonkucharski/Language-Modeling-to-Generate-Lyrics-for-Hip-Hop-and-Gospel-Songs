Shorty I wanna know if you come over 
 If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders 
 Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes 
 You want for you and I to do the freaky things you like 
 When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya 
 When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya 
 When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya

 Let's ride round the city, make love in the car 
 Let's get on express way, and let me tease you ma 
 And while you drive baby, I wanna taste your tongue 
 Pull in to rest area, and let me give you some 
 You ever been driving while your man made you cum 
 I wanna hit and stay, I wanna hit and run 
 Let's pull the car over, and have a little fun 
 The AC working, so we ain't gotta bun 
 Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it 
 Baby tell me can I have it 
 Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I grip it 
 Anyway I wanna get it
