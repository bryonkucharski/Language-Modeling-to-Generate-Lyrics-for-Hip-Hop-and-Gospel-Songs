I know it's somebody, somewhere, homie 
 That today they celebration 
 I might not know ya 
 But I wanna celebrate witcha 
 Gotta be somebody the police chasin' that done got away 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world today that'll beat they case 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world got off probation today 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world walkin' out them prison gates 
 I'm happy for that nigga, today, that done came home 
 And got that time behind 'em, now it's time to move on 
 I'm celebratin' witcha, the reason I wrote this song 
 Hope you done became a better person since you been gone 
 I salute you, my nigga, dawg, for stayin' strong 
 Now, getcha feet up unda ya, homie and keep it goin' 
 I hope ya walk straight, don't make the wrong turn 
 Them cracks waitin' to send you off on anotha long run 
 Just enjoy yaself tonight and have fun 
 And don't go fuckin' wit them niggas who ain't send ya nothin' 
 And if ya got kids, go'n get 'em and catch up 
 I'm celebratin' wit' you tonight, I'm holdin' my cup up 
 Gotta be somebody the police chasin' that done got away 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world today that'll beat they case 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world got off probation today 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world walkin' out them prison gates 
 He took them crackas to the do' and he beat 'em in trial 
 A lot of niggas thought you was gon' lose but you held it down 
 All I can tell you, homie, you made all the real niggas proud 
 They offered you a plea bargain, but you turned it down 
 Stood in the paint, what you believed in, you did it in style 
 I know your family, they was worried, but now they can smile 
 Should be happy 'cause ain't too many of us beat 'em in awhile 
 Just be careful in these streets 'cause this shit done got wild 
 A lot of niggas fucked up, so they playin' it foul 
 He was your homeboy, he your co-defendant now 
 If you gon' get money, get it, but lose the crowd 
 Niggas in prison 'cause they homeboys ran they mouth 
 Gotta be somebody the police chasin' that done got away 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world today that'll beat they case 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world got off probation today 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world walkin' out them prison gates 
 To that young nigga who took 'em on a high-speed chase 
 Ain't condonin' whatcha did, I'm just glad ya got away 
 I know ya heart beatin' fast, I'm just glad ya safe 
 Shit, you had to hit it, you couldn't afford another case 
 You tried to play cool, but you shoulda seen your face 
 Git a muthafucka, lost 'em in broad-day 
 Doin' a-hundred, dawg, goin' down a one-way 
 Jumped out on 'em, turned into a foot race 
 Git know the streets, so they couldn't keep they pace 
 He had to throw his pistol, they find it, that's okay 
 You ain't gotta do it, but for you I'ma celebrate 
 Do me a favor, dawg, stay out them cracka face 
 Gotta be somebody the police chasin' that done got away 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world today that'll beat they case 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world got off probation today 
 Gotta be somebody 'round the world walkin' out them prison gates
