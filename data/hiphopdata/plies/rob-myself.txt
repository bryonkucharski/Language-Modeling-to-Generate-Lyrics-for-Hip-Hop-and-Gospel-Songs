[Plies talking] 
 Bruh bruh (bruh bruh) 
 I got 'bought 80 stacks in my pockets right now bruh bruh 
 (Wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself) 
 And this the first time I ever though about robbin' myself bruh bruh 
 (Wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself, wanna rob myself) 
 I was walkin' 'round in my crib last night and said, "Damn, I wanna rob myself" 
 I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself) 
 I'm in the coupe windows clear 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself) 
 This a half a mill right here 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Hey Plies it's a robbery, get up! 
 I'm talkin' to myself though, what the fuck? 
 G-F four-fifty that's the biggest truck 
 Yo jewelry 'gainst mine nigga put it up 
 This a robbery don't move, don't buck 
 Got eighty stacks in my pocket nigga I gotta bump 
 Tight jeans don't work when your pockets stuffed 
 Another one-fifty in the whip add it up

 Got the forty on my waist right by my gut 
 Say she like a nigga jewelry but don't touch

 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself) 
 This a half a mill right here 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Looked in my garage and I got nervous 
 Half a mill worth a cars I ain't James Worhty 
 Know my neighbors must be sayin' this nigga ridin' dirty 
 Momma was washin' my clothes and said she found thirty 
 Thirty stacks and I ain't missed it must mean I ain't hurtin' 
 Told her gon' keep it buy some more damn detergent 
 I ain't bought nothin' all day I feel like a virgin 
 Don't step on my rug 'cause this shit Persian 
 I ain't playing that's what the interior decorator told me 
 Let me have some of my foam 'cause the nigga owe me 
 Told me he was on the dick that's how the nigga sold me 
 I'mma hit 'em in his shit, that's what I told 'em 
 I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself) 
 I'm in the coupe windows clear 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself) 
 This a half a mill right here 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Count a mill and a half and I'll stop countin' 
 Took some pictures of that shit that shit look like a mountain 
 Said, "God damn I can buy a lot of houses" 
 Said, "Hell nah dad'll send me ??" 
 And you snitchin' ass niggas, y'all need some snitchin' counseling 
 First forty-eight a nigga man you niggas wild'n 
 I don't fuck wit checks 
 'Dey got to worry 'bout 'em bouncin' 
 I'm a strip club nigga that deal with cash only 
 Reason I bought that fuckin' Bentley, I was kinda lonely 
 Felt like a bachelorship wit nobody on me 
 I'mma rob myself bruh in one moment 
 Got some real fuckin' clear diamonds fuckin' on me 
 I'm a million dolla nigga (Wanna rob myself) 
 I'm in the coupe windows clear 
 (Wanna rob myself) 
 Seventy-thousand in my ears (Wanna rob myself) 
 This a half a mill right here 
 (Wanna rob myself)
