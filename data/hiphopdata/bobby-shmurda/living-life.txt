Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch 
 They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch 
 You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch 
 I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch 
 Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip 
 Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live 
 Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib 
 CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this 
 Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life 
 I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight 
 Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right 
 Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right 
 You get the message, aight? 
 Now what you know about that kitchen life 
 When we was pitching white? 
 People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right 
 I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life 
 Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life 
 Now what you know about that kitchen life 
 When we was pitching white? 
 People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right

 Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life 
 I'm living life like a boss 
 Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star 
 I'm living large so don't know the total to my car 
 But I just know that shit real fast when it start 
 Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog 
 I'm a nigga that make music for a job 
 I'll drop a bomb on your big body cars 
 Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard 
 With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad 
 Give a little bit of Shmoney to my moms 
 Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob 
 Now we living large 
 Now what you know about that kitchen life 
 When we was pitching white?
