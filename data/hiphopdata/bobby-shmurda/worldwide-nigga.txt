I went to worldwide nigga from the block 
 I was fuckin' with some tools 
 (I was fuckin' some BLAW!) 
 Now I'm a worldwide nigga from the block 
 And I'm fuckin' with some jewels 
 (I be fuckin' with some) 
 I'm a worldwide nigga 
 On the block, I was moving six to twos 
 (I was moving six to twos, nigga) 
 The whole world know Bobby 
 They don't wanna meet the nigga Chewy true 
 Trap digits, crack picture 
 I was pack flippin' 
 Cash gettin', mad different 
 I was fast living 
 Mama always told me 'bout my bad living 
 Now days niggas say I act different 
 But fuck a case, my niggas still pack Smith &'s 
 And fuck the J's, my niggas do bag flippin' 
 And if they blowin' gray, my niggas gon' clash with 'em 
 Shoot ops broad day, my niggas is mad with it

 Boom nigga, let's go to war, let see you crew thicker

 You niggas know 'bout my shmurders, we will move niggas 
 Fool niggas, keep playin' wild like the school, nigga 
 So play with mines, we gon' leave you on the news, nigga

 Woop nigga, woop woop
