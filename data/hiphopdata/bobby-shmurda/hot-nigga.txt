Y'all tryna' make a next motherfuckin' scene up in here, huh? 
 It's like Shmurda she wrote 
 How much shmoneys that? Ah ah ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah 
 And Chewy, I'm some hot nigga 
 Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas 
 Like you seen him twirl then he drop, nigga 
 And we keep 'em nine millis on my block, nigga 
 And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas 
 And Trigger he be wildin', he some hot nigga 
 Tones known to get busy with 'em Glocks, nigga 
 Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga 
 Runnin' through these checks till I pass out 
 And shorty give me neck till I pass out 
 I swear to God, all I do is cash out 
 And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house 
 I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade 
 Really never made no difference what the shit made 
 Jaja taught me flip 'em packs and how to maintain 
 Get that money back and spend it on the same thing 
 Shawty like the way that I ball out 
 I be gettin' money till I fall out 
 You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out 
 Shorty love the way that I floss out 
 Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out 
 Mama said no pussy cats inside my doghouse 
 That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound 
 Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out 
 We gon' pull up in that hooptie, like we cops on 'em 
 With M16's, we gon' put some shots on 'em 
 I send a lil thot to send the drop on 'em 
 She gon' call me up and I'm a sick the hots on 'em 
 Grimey savage, that's what we are 
 Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star 
 GS9, I go so hard 
 But GS for my gun squad 
 And bitch if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl 
 Shots poppin' out the AR 
 I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Rod 
 Broad daylight and we gon' let 'em things bark 
 Tell 'em niggas free Meeshie, ho 
 Some way, free Breezy, ho 
 And tell my niggas, Shmurda teamin', ho 
 Mitch caught a body about a week ago 
 Fuck with us and then we tweakin', ho 
 Run up on that nigga, get the squeezin', ho 
 Everybody catchin' bullet holes 
 Niggas got me on my bully, yo 
 I'm a run up, put that gun on 'em 
 I'm a run up, go dumb on 'em 
 Niggas got me on that young shit 
 Got me on that go dumb shit 
 Got me on that go dumb shit, man 
 Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch 
 Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank
