I'm tired of muthafucking lawyer fees 
 I'm tired of these muthafucking court dates 
 I'm tired of seeing this judge 
 Why they want to pin a felly on me? 
 I ain't did nothing 
 They acting like they got the dime on me 
 Muthafuckers bluffing 
 I let my lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I let me lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I told my lawyer, "I got 40 on me 
 Is you trying to go to court for me?" 
 These niggas trying to put a charge on me 
 Why they wanna lock dudes up 
 Why they wanna put some fraud on me? 
 They said I ran with a tudge on me 
 My momma prayed to the Lord for me 
 While my niggas go to war for me 
 My daddy paid the price hard for me 
 He was trying to live life large for me 
 He ran the whole nine yards for me 
 And we was driving niggas 54 for grease 
 We was in the courthouse often 
 Even though they see a star in a nigga 
 The feds and sargeants still bother a nigga 
 Why they want to pin a felly on me? 
 I ain't did nothing 
 They acting like they got the dime on me 
 Muthafuckers bluffing 
 I let my lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I let me lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 Blow that case away, b-blow that case away 
 So I went and stashed 100K just for a rainy day 
 Niggas play, we letting semis spray, I catch a Fendi case 
 I dropped that body 'fore I hit the gate 
 That's on my granny's grave 
 My momma glad a nigga changed his ways 
 I was in and out of drama each and every day 
 We was flipping selling hard at my mama place 
 Nigga we was trapping hard like it was '88 
 First of the month, know that is my favorite day 
 Girl, when you come, know that I'mma let you stay 
 Girl, give me some, 'fore they try to take me away 
 I don't even know how long they gonna make me stay 
 Why they want to pin a felly on me? 
 I ain't did nothing 
 They acting like they got the dime on me 
 Muthafuckers bluffing 
 I let my lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I let me lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I let my lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away 
 I let me lawyer wipe that case away 
 Oh, he wiped that case away
