Charles Hamilton 
 Ayo n-n-n-niggers never wanna get credit when credits due 
 So they forever make me get better instead of lose 
 And any amount of money motherfuckers is makin' 
 They can wager it on a battle better believe I'll take it 
 And any of enemy losin the second option 
 Just put the mic down right now and get it poppin' 
 B-But I'm a cool cat and won't make it to that level 
 So I'm a stick to the drums b-base and the treble 
 B-b-b-but if you should fuck with nate then it's trouble 
 F-f-f-fuck us for real I'll pop your face like a bubble 
 The no gunplay just straight to the knuckles 
 Great with the hustle till I'm late to a puddle 
 Do you understand what I mean 
 I'll beat you with a branch from your family tree 
 You see the way we get down son you don't want it 
 And rob you like chris brown clown y'all run it! 
 Nah homie whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something? 
 D-d-d-d-did I st-st-stutter or something? 
 Did I st-st-stutter-st-st-stutter or something? 
 Nah shawty whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something? 
 They say I talk a little bit fast 
 But if you listen a little faster maybe you can catch up bitch! 
 Charles Hamilton 
 P-p-p-people always sayin' Charles you can sell 
 Lyrically you are a nuisance but you can't tell 
 I wanna beat they ass till my two hands swell 
 Yeah hit 'em upstyle like bluepaint trail 
 B-b-b-but since the new year I'm a new man hell 
 My team tight no way my crew can't gel 
 Like the wu clan the ku klan we roll od 
 You don't hold heat get a crew man hell! 
 N-n-n-niggas want me for free but relax 
 Me and my team proceed but lean back 
 No need to repeat the scene I've seen that 
 I'm a beat makin' beast you need me scream back 
 D-d-dudes are some fooly fools of whos pop 
 Truth is the new 2pac you not 
 And when these fools flop you gon see whos hot 
 Charles the rap huey freeman from the boondocks you got it! 
 Nah homie whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something?

 Nah shawty whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something? 
 They say I talk a little bit fast 
 But if you listen a little faster maybe you can catch up bitch! 
 Yung Nate 
 F-f-f-flamin faggots thought they could battle with the irrational 
 Complicated compatible spittin' I l-l-laugh at you 
 I undeniably spit fire without you tryin' 
 You might need to put your rhymes on the trash can diet 
 C-c-c-cannot be converted manipulated and murdered 
 Destroy yourself if you've heard it invincible is the verdict 
 K-k-k-killin' killas with German rulers I shoot for losers 
 Pop the tool just to remove his medulla 
 You you you niggas cannot see him demolish him or defeat him 
 Your resembling feces when compared to the demon fetus 
 I'm a? put 'em up and I'm rippin em 
 A million niggas out there now I'm sick of 'em I'm sicker than 
 Y'all sweeter than lickerish everything I have's ridiculous 
 That's why I don't mind sendin these bullets through your ligaments 
 Fall back y'all niggas don't want no beef 
 Me and Charles choppin niggas on this Charlie brown beat 
 Nah homie whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something? 
 D-d-d-d-did I st-st-stutter or something? 
 Did I st-st-stutter-st-st-stutter or something? 
 Nah shawty whatchu mean whatchu mean 
 I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something? 
 They say I talk a little bit fast 
 But if you listen a little faster maybe you can catch up bitch!
