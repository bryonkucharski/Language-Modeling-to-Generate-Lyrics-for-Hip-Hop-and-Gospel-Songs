Miles from home, my style has grown 
 Sick of getting played like a xylophone 
 My instrument is me with thousands of bones 
 Wilin', I just wanna zone 
 My mama knows 
 I need a chick to be kinda dope 
 Smile a lot, give a lot of (dome) 
 Only to me, spoil me with your bad (ass) 
 You're like royalty, baby, catch that 
 See the rain is makin' me feel painless 
 This relationship is so dangerous 
 If they find out, what will they make of it 
 So I say that every kiss like a sanction 
 You ain't missin' a thing 
 With other niggas who sing 
 I need cash just to give you a ring 
 Love at first sight, but it was blocked by pain 
 So for you, I'll exceed the top 5 in the game 
 In the city lights 
 I swear I hear you call my name (Call my name) 
 There's nothing right 
 I'm stuck here while you're miles away (Miles away) 
 New York raining 
 New York raining 
 It's too much my babe I need you 
 It's too much my babe I need you 
 Red wine and cheese before bed time 
 You and I fell in love is the headline 
 Instead of whinin' about what I've been findin' 
 I stay silent and let you chime in 
 You want me to talk? 
 Fine then 
 Someone broke your heart? 
 Let me find them 
 But I hate fights and now I got stage fright 
 Until I'm at your place at the late night 
 You make me smile, stop doing that 
 A lot is on my mind when I rap, in fact 
 You are a lot, I guess I rap for you 
 Needless to say, the (sex) is magical 
 After you, chivalry I have to do 
 I love it when you catch an attitude 
 I want to tease you just to laugh at you 
 So that make up (sex) could be a faster move 
 C'mon! 
 In the city lights 
 I swear I hear you call my name (Call my name) 
 There's nothing right 
 I'm stuck here while you're miles away (Miles away) 
 New York raining 
 New York raining 
 It's too much my babe I need you 
 It's too much my babe I need you 
 When the rain falls down, the pain is all out 
 My brain, you call out my name and that's fame 
 I'm looking great but I still feel shame 
 For real it's the game 
 I feel insane 
 But when I'm with you, my feelings change 
 I love you, I really hope you feel the same 
 You know what I am, you're holdin' my hand 
 No one else can so I'm your man 
 Your palm reads bliss 
 What are we miss? 
 You are what I miss and we all need this 
 Love and affection is all we miss 
 From the world but with each other 
 That's all we get 
 I wanna hear you out, talk to me, miss 
 I hardly wanna slip the awesomest kiss 
 Call me whenever, call me forever 
 As long as I can call us together 
 I love you 
 In the city lights 
 I swear I hear you call my name (call my name) 
 There's nothing right 
 I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away) 
 In New York raining (New York raining) 
 In New York raining there's too much 
 My babe, I need you 
 There's too much, my babe I need you
