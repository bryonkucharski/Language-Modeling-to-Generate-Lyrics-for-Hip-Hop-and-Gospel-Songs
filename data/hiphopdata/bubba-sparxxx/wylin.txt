She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free 
 Don't give a damn 'cause she wylin', wylin' 
 She'd rather go with a wild ass boy like me 
 Don't give a damn 'cause she wylin', wylin' (Drop drop it down low) 
 Here we go! 
 What's the good news, we're the league weed? 
 Them Lac boys, got 'em with me 
 Got a hundred bottles and some good weed 
 And if your boyfriend's here I think he should leave 
 Immediately, 'cause I'm wylin' you wylin' we wylin' 
 And there's nothin' he can do about it 
 Bubba K get it right on a Friday night 
 They can't see me dude I am out of sight 
 Do you really wanna hurt me baby? 
 Do you really wanna make me cry? 
 You don't love me, well guess what, 
 I don't love you either but can we lie? 
 I'm in town just for this one night and I can pretty much guarantee 
 That if it ain't goin' down right now well this just ain't never happening 
 Here we go!

 Watch her go when she heads to the bar 
 Showin' off like a brand new car 
 In her own mind she's a rockstar 
 Got all of the fellows comin' from afar 
 To watch baby girl shake shake that thang 
 Drop it down low don't break that thang 
 Yeah I know you like my country twang 
 Let me hit you off with some country game 
 I'm lovin' them cowboy boots 
 Country girl swag with them daisy dukes 
 Up top is a bathing suit 
 She downin' shots said whatcha wanna do uh 
 I can think of a couple scenarios 
 Jump in, just crank that stereo 
 Hit the backwoods in the four-wheel drive 
 Stay drunk, stay crunk, straight wylin' all night ay 
 She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free 
 Don't give a damn 'cause she wylin', wylin'

 Ain't a damn thing wrong with a short lil skirt 
 Done lost her phone 'bout to lose her shirt 
 Got the whole damn club on full alert 
 Done drunk so much all she wanna do is flirt 
 Oh, with a bottle of crown 
 Stand up slow so you don't fall down 
 Do your thang to this country sound 
 Bubba K, Lac boys done laid it down
