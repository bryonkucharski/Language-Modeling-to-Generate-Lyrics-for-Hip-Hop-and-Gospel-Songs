I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl 
 I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl 
 See I was made on my cas middle road 
 Where the rowdy fox come from 
 And if they ask you can tell 'em we drinking, we smoking 
 We'll do pretty much, anything but run 
 The graving line at the baring line 
 I was made of the Jordan side 
 Find a whole more in your pants 
 Find a shine, find a bill for that type of ' 
 Find you kind, you chop down and compress top the address of a better sound 
 But come to me, we get the deal 
 Gonna pop that chop off is sweet that, we get the meal 
 Me and mom get turn off 
 That wood part get burgh up 
 Hottest hill but it's feel all like 
 Having me sure it does 
 Anybody just anybody plus no body that's everybody 
 Knows about that meal dog 
 Dead crows is dead around it, to be as cold and get women around 
 We came to have a good time tonight 
 But disrespect might get to hot 
 I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl 
 I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl 
 See I was made on my cas middle road 
 Where the rowdy fox come from 
 And if they ask you can tell 'em we drinking, we smoking 
 We'll do pretty much, anything but run 
 I got my bear, bitch it's still like a mean night 
 Moon light my road is ' 
 That's how we living that real life 
 Chevrolets and 'up about that gravel 
 It feels still with that mind like hell 
 But a bumper does not devil 
 Just drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke 
 Maybe do what anybody do 
 Man what did you think, my flow was a joke 
 Now buddy that must be you 
 Got met on the grill, the music is loud, we have American veil 
 In case they forgot this is my car get, tell 'em again 
 We party like anybody just talk about how they party 
 Take a wick of that pow water just to get my day started 
 Born here, was made here and I'mma stay here I'mma beat bear 
 Right on there on top of the hill'on cemetery 
 I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl 
 I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl 
 See I was made on my cas middle road
