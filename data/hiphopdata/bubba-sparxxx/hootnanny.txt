(Justin:) 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 (Bubba:) 
 Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport 
 'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door 
 The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for ?? 
 Some scared at first, but usually those demand more 
 Really ain't conceited, I just call myself a cut above 
 A horny little parasite that all the women love to love 
 Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was 
 Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ?? 
 Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin' 
 Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening 
 I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck is all that's glistenin' 
 Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined 
 I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built 
 Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt 
 It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt 
 Y'all matter less every time this margarita tilt 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear 
 Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer 
 And another pig to give my other pigs some company 
 Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary 
 In due time, but there's business left to attend to 
 I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to 
 And another tractor for my great aunt Missy 
 Yeah, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy 
 Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about 
 He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout 
 I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good 
 Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could 
 I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy 
 Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me 
 Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop 
 Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hick hop 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery 
 Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be 
 Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally 
 I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be 
 An uncanny wit plus a timing that's impeccable 
 Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable 
 How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual 
 Confused them all at first so this time is understandable 
 Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now 
 Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found 
 Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown 
 Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny...
