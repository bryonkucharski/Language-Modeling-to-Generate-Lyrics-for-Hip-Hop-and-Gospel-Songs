 (Verse 1 - Timbaland) 
 Timbaland done lost his mind (mind) 
 I think I'm about to cross the line (line) 
 And find me somethin' that soft to find (find) 
 And hit it 'cause she swing right off the vine (oh) 
 You better hold me back, I told you that 
 I got enough heat to take your corners back 
 And I done took your freak, you want her back 
 (Well you can have that hooker, hooker, hooker) (c'mon) 
 I'm a dirty south nigga from the VA streets (oh) 
 And this is how I represent over this here beat (uh huh) 
 And why'all don't really want to fuck with me 
 I don't care what why'all say, why'all stuck with me (all right now) 
 Now I got the place panicin (oh) 
 Timbaland and my dirty shenanigan (oh) 
 And I might put two in the sky (uh huh) 
 Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (woo) 
 You better hold me back (oh) 
 You better hold me back (oh) 
 You better hold me back 
 'Cause I'm full of shenanigans 
 (Oh) You better hold me back (oh) 
 You better hold me back (oh) 
 You better hold me back 
 'Cause I'm full of shenanigans 
 (Verse 2 - Magoo) 
 Hold me back, cause rap sell more than crack 
 Stack my funds, my guns, take my quarters back 
 Don't resist I will put heat on the track 
 Matter of fact, we can take it off of wax 
 You and your team was livin' the dream, somebody shake 'em 
 I can't hold on these dreams they won't wake 'em 
 Fuck face, the street is a car chase 
 Ew dead set, do what it take, to win the race 
 I erase my fear and don't reappear 
 I'm a go to the bar and take your beer, bitch 
 Nigga, I must make shit clear 
 Fuck around with Ooh, I'll bite off your ear 
 You better do the same, I fight till your slain 
 On right just to bite, I'm tryna sever a vein 
 And I might put two in the sky 
 Like (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da) 
 (Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx) 
 Sucker live in fear of the day that I'm focused 
 Slow as he appear, it's clear I own this 
 Realm of Southern rap that despise to be competitive 
 North or northfolk, they jokes is our negligence 
 Sure they bounce to 112, I make a note of what sells 
 Down here the sign men don't promote it, look at us fail 
 Fuck it, I'ma just tell the truth as I perceive it 
 Most of them think our shit is useless, believe it 
 But me I got a love affair with all things Southern 
 The dirty is a territory why'all can't govern 
 We all ain't brothers, but this ain't the bitches neither 
 And all our rap songs ain't for bouncers drinkin' either 
 Let me hit the reefer, 'fore I forgot to be the 
 Little old country white boy, get to spittin' ether 
 Don't let this shit deceive ya, that cracker there crafty 
 I know you only heard me cause you have to stare at me (BITCH) 
 (Humming continues) 
 ... Full of shenanigans
