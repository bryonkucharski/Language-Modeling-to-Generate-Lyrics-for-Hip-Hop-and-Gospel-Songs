The world is cold as a winter 
 And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter 
 I got a whole lot of issues that are unresolved 
 I went 2 weeks without seeing nobody, just my dog 
 His name is Blao, he's the closest thing to a child 
 I may ever have, I'm selfish as hell, why lie 
 Too self absorbed of relationships, still I try 
 From time to time to find me one for my life 
 And my patterns are hard for a decent woman to 
 Respect or accept, so whores I keep em' comin' through 
 In the bed with a babbling bitch that loves me 
 And she bad it's just some about it's ugly 
 After we finish, I hate when she try to touch me 
 It ain't her fault, that's just me 
 I slowly weigh down, but I ain't perfect though 
 Relapse is a record that I done heard before 
 And I'm no Marshall Mathers, I'm talking Andy Mathis 
 I'm talking deadly habits, it's so sad and tragic 
 The world is cold as a winter 
 And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a sinner, 
 But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away 
 'Cause I'm cold as the winter 
 And life done got up under my skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a winner 
 But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today 
 I tried my best to be so good to some folks 
 The same people showed me betrayal up close 
 The flip side of that coin is I've been negligent 
 With a lot of my real friends I never meant 
 To let a day turn into a month and then a year 
 Without speaking to you, I know that it appears 
 I just forgot about y'all but really in truth 
 I forgot about me too, this igloo 
 I built around myself it's so frigid 
 And it ain't melting away, I don't dig it 
 I know life is gone, I'm gon' miss it 
 It's like it never was here, if you don't live it 
 I think about the past and get so livid 
 What the fuck was you thinking, I don't get it 
 You so capable, personality magnetic 
 Life could have been so good if you had let it 
 The world is cold as a winter 
 And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a sinner, 
 But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away 
 'Cause I'm cold as the winter 
 And life done got up under my skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a winner 
 But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today 
 I may not be the shit to you but where I come from 
 Them people love Bub, therefor I must just 
 Stay faithful, the lord got his hands on me 
 And you don't hate me, you just don't understand, homie 
 There from humble beginnings I saw limitless 
 Possibility, fear was my only nemesis 
 Along the way I forfeited my innocence 
 But that is ok, thank you lord 
 For all the pain, the affliction 
 It's like a mirror in my face that I need to see 
 All my loss, my addiction 
 Showed me something that I really needed to know about me 
 It's like a shape to me, you're more than me 
 Killing this heart is controlling me 
 Though I'm out of control, you still order me 
 Folding me up inside your hands and the words don't come 
 The world is cold as a winter 
 And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a sinner, 
 But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away 
 'Cause I'm cold as the winter 
 And life done got up under my skin like a splinter 
 I know I'm a winner 
 But all I can do is pray, let me make it through the day 
 Let me make it through the day
