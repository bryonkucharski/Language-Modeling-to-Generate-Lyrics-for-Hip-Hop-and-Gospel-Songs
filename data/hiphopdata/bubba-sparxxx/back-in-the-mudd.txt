1, 2 
 1, 2, 3, let's go 
 Back in the mud I've been in 
 I confess, I'm so happy here 
 There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away 
 He's just that country boy, city slick, pit bull temperament 
 At the Pony, at the Flame, either way it's an event 
 If it's me consider it more than a coincidence 
 Even though they mama like me sucka's keep they distances 
 Barber K, hey, what's that, they say 
 Hip hop redneck that's a safe place 
 Say what makes you comfortable 
 Wit me 'cause I like it here 
 How about a road-dwellin' urban music pioneer 
 Turn it up, let it bang, run wit me I bet you can't 
 Took too much to make it float, never will I let it sink 
 So when we invented it for our youth and generous 
 Hopin' that my moment passed, I can see no end of it 
 Twenty-five, livin' like I was born yesterday 
 Lovin' life, eatin' right, earnin' every breath I take 
 Standin' in the mud again 'cause it seem to pay me well 
 Playin' wit my not-so-distant cousins from the A-T-L 
 Ah! 
 Press it up, ship it out, call the Pony, rent it out 
 Everything I am today is really what I been about 
 Athens, Gerogia resident, native of LaGrange though 
 I don't love the peach state, "Buddy, say it ain't so" 
 Now all of a sudden, in fact, it's quite the opposite 
 I'm lovin' y'all from Brunswick up to the metropolis 
 Can't forget about my Betty Betty and DaLonica 
 They put the triple X's at the end of Andy's moniker 
 How could I run from everything that made me 
 Know that all the love I get's appreciated greatly 
 Now I'm on the brink of something truly inconceivable 
 Bubba's international but still he kept it regional 
 Tryin' to make my mama proud 
 We can laugh and see the smile 
 Gotta make sure loaded gun, this next CD is in your file 
 An-and everyone of my talented associates get's what they deserve 
 Nothin' short of that's appropriate 
 Kitchen cup, fill it up, soap-it don't appeal to us 
 If you're broke do what you can, that alone is still enough 
 Help us out, if you're rich, 'cause we gunna hit your bitch 
 Just stop by the store and grab a case of that and six of this 
 Hey Betty, get ready 'cause your daddy's in route 
 Let her join the beat club, keep that little trim out 
 Have her screamin' "New South" without pullin' "lewd" out 
 He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now 
 At the end of the day I would have no regrets 
 Got it done on every front and I ain't even focused yet 
 At the bottom of the pile swimmin' wit them mud cats 
 If you die, man I'm pullin' "soowee" for a grudge match 
 Spell it out, L-E-G, E-N-D I still believe 
 Whatever goal God set for me indeed I will achieve 
 In this life or in the next, whether drinkin' gin or Beck's 
 Bubba gunna bring it home, conceal it, and send the checks
