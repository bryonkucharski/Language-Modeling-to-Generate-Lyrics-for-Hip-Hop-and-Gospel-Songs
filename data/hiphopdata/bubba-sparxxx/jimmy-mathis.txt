 Any blood sheared causes to deserve it, Its blood well worth it, 
 We fought to preserve it, you caught him in person, 
 You know Bubba siked out, you hate it when they talk, 
 But love it when I shout, Fuck with me, I doubt that you really can 
 WHen I get to doin' my HillBilly dance, a step to the left, 2 steps to the right 
 Take a shot of petrone, and get back to the Mic, 
 Yeah I'm rappin' tonight, but as soon as the light hit, I'm all about the green, 
 The hell with this white shit, that speed yup ya pulse rate, Some 
 Cardiac arrest so sweet with an 'I'll' taste, this what they must face, 
 Ima be right here, spittin' these flames out, and drinkin' Bud Light Beer 
 Till the cows home and the dogs quit barkin, 
 Daddy tell 'em who I am and don't begg no pardons,

 They watch me in the country, like the rates on Sunday 
 And I wear the crown for 'em till you take it from me, I made some money, 
 But blew most up, bought and sold all the sh** that you bust up, 
 But I love my life, and ain't much I regret, I jus hope I rember, half of what I forget 
 Through years and the tears, the blood and the all of the sweat, 
 But if I ever believe, its time to double your bet, 
 'Cause I ain't even tapped half my potential, but I have shown growth thogh, 
 And that is half the essential, Grad you a pen, jolt a few notes down, 
 The questions they asked me, the answers I know now, bet I ain't no clown, 
 Fuck what you thought dogg, I'm with Jimmy Mathis ol truck with a saw dogg, 
 Jus to rip up, let some shit jump, We'll take it to the water, and yo shit will get sunk
