For those who come to San Francisco 
 For those who come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Franciscccco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 I rep my city, nobody flyer 
 Say something different, you a goddamn liar 
 Block on fire, streets stay cookin 
 Girl, you lookin' for a boyfriend, keep on looking 
 Downtown, Filmore, something like brooklyn 
 Uptown Harlem, yeah we ballin 
 Frisco, Frisco home of the brave 
 I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' paid 
 All of the TV, still ain't changed 
 Good in the hood, everywhere I go 
 Got a block full of haters everywhere I go 
 You Say you from the hood but you never there tho 
 Ay, HP love, lake view love me 
 Sunny dale, towerside let's get money 
 Bank, Bank three story 
 Game this movement 
 Street Cred music 
 Son let's do it 
 For those who come to San Francisco 
 From San Francisco 
 For those who come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Francisco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 It's a city situation, I keep Hunters point 
 In thee equation 
 I'm married to the block, you just got relations 
 And you gon need a doctor to play with my patients 
 You hatin', you'll get it in broad day 
 My neck shines like the lights on broadway 
 Never gave a broad away 
 Cause in Filmore they'll get it to pay 
 But HP, that be me 
 Check my street cred 
 I'm in the trap all day 
 (All day, all day) 
 I just count the cash 
 Now my whip bent like Alcatraz 
 And not one bars of fable 
 We got the cable car, but my car got cable 
 Boo banga, I'm on demand like comcast 
 And with these squares, I don't contrast 
 For those who come to San Francisco 
 From San francisco 
 For those who come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Francisco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 See it goes by no book 
 Anybody get took, from HP 
 To hayes valley we push 
 Come over the top of the bridge 
 It gets narrow 
 The grip go down ridin' on O'farrel young Filmore, Fa-rel 
 Golden gate treasure 
 Got it the warf, S.F. da letters 
 Roll in like fog, the battle is up hill 
 You witness Shit you will get killed 
 Cougnut Mr. C 
 Hit man r.i.p. 
 Much love from S.F.C 
 Handle bricks in the back of Candlestick 
 House in twin peaks, view panoramics 
 Still with the cannon, 40,50 caliber 
 5 time champion, destroy any challenger 
 Hit like Barry, score like Jerry 
 Still right here, Filmore to marry
