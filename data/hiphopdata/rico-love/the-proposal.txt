If we can't be happy, can we at least pretend 
 Even if you cannot love me, can you at least just tell me it 
 Ain't that what they all do anyway, yeah, they kiss each other on the face 
 They call each other bae, when deep down inside all they feel is pain 
 So we might as well get married cause ya so sick of me already 
 You want me to leave already, so hard to believe already, already, already 
 We might as well get married 'cause we're arguing already 
 You hate my guts already, fell outta love already, already, might as well get married, turn the lights on 
 Lets smile at each other, so we can please our friends 
 'Cause we both know just how much you care bout impressing them 
 Cause ain't that what couples do anyway, they lie right in each others face 
 And they call each other bae, when deep down inside all they feel is pain 
 So we might as well get married cause ya so sick of me already 
 You want me to leave already, so hard to believe already, already, already 
 We might as well get married 'cause we're arguing already 
 You hate my guts already, fell outta love already, already, might as well get married, turn the lights on 
 I buy you a house so you can kick me out 
 Take my ass to court and tell the judge what I'm 'bout 
 Don't forget to tell the kids that they Daddy ain't shit 
 Look at how he did ya Momma out there with that outta bitch 
 'Cause we're arguing already 
 Fell outta love already, already, might as well get married
