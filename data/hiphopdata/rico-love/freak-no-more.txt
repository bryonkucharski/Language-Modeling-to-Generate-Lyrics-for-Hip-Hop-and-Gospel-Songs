She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She says she don't wanna be a freak no more 
 Oh, I think she lying 
 Oh, oh, I think she lying 
 Hear they go acting all crazy, yo 
 Here they go talking but they don't know 
 I keep to myself 'cause they be shady, yo 
 Industry niggers, they'll hate on you, bitches, too 
 It's like their occupation 
 That's why she got her a reputation 
 But girl, you ain't done nothing to feel guilty about 
 I love when you be talking with that filthy mouth 
 Because grown people ain't got time to be worrying about you 
 All your bills are paid and your baby straight 
 You can do what you wanna do 
 But she says 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She says she don't wanna be a freak no more 
 Oh, I think she lying 
 Oh, oh, I think she lying 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna stay out all night 
 She don't wanna run the streets no more 
 And when she see me in the club she don't even wanna speak no more 
 Your knees don't get weak no more, you don't wanna skeet no more? 
 What's the occupation you chose? Dancer 
 So why you giving these hoes answers? 
 'Cause you don't owe no explanations 
 You blow smoke for recreation 
 I drink brown and you want white 
 It's like jungle fever on the best vacation 
 We might go over they head 
 While hold up both of your legs 
 Ain't tryina get you no stress 
 But I be missing your sex and she says 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She don't wanna be a freak no more 
 She says she don't wanna be a freak no more 
 Oh, I think she lying 
 Oh, oh, I think she lying
