They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 We be in the same room 
 We don't ever say shit 
 Let's keep it between me and you 
 And we cool, 'cause they don't know 
 I'm the one you be textin' when you be up at your job 
 I'm the one that brought that Benz that's in your garage 
 I'm the reason you don't stress when shit gets hard 
 And anything you want, it's all yours 
 They don't know 
 On your birthday I'm the one who saw your birthday suit 
 Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe 
 I keep it all real, I ain't gotta tell lies to you 
 You're the only one who knows the truth 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 We be in the same room 
 We don't ever say shit 
 Let's keep it between me and you 
 And we cool, 'cause they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't even know I know you 
 You don't be talking like a lame bitch 
 You follow the rules, we keep it cool 
 'Cause they don't... 
 We was at the same hotel, Super Bowl and All-Star week 
 You be acting shy but you're really an all star freak (They don't know) 
 That you got my name tattooed on your body 
 They don't know you belong to me, yeah (They don't know) 
 About the code names and the secret island trips 
 When I be up in that pussy I be callin' you my bitch 
 They don't know you like me, they don't know you like me 
 They don't even know that I share you with my wifey 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 We be in the same room 
 We don't ever say shit 
 Let's keep it between me and you 
 And we cool, 'cause they don't know 
 You deserve the rewards, G5 planes, you deserve the board 
 Tell them all the lames, they can swerve of course 
 And I swear to God I'mma curve the broads 
 'Cause they don't know, vacations they don't go 
 You stay patient and I respect that cause you know how to play your post 
 Them other bitches get antsy, that's why a nigga never treat 'em fancy 
 You get shoes off in Bergdorf while they bargain shopping on Delancey 
 You ain't even to your sister, Mama thinking you don't even like niggas 
 Instagram, you don't even like pictures, that's why I'm fuckin' with ya 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't, they don't know 
 They don't know 
 We be in the same room 
 We don't ever say shit 
 Let's keep it between me and you 
 And we cool, 'cause they don't know
