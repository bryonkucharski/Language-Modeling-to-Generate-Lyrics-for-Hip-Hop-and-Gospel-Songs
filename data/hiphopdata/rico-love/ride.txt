The winters too cold, the summers too hot 
 The days too long, the bullshit don't stop 
 The worlds gonna be here, whether you stay here or not 
 Oh no, I know 
 Ah, who knows where the road will take you? 
 Ah, just make sure you don't let it break you, enjoy the ride 
 You don't get much time, so make it the time of your life 
 'Cause I'm enjoying mine, 'cause I'm enjoying mine 
 Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride 
 Ride, ride, ride, turn the lights on 
 Ride, ride, ride, winter too cold, summer too hot 
 Winter too cold, summer too hot 
 The winters too cold, the summers too hot 
 And even if it all goes wrong, at least we gave it all we got 
 One day we gotta leave here, might as well leave here on top 
 Oh no, I know 
 Ah, who knows where the road will take you? 
 Ah, just make sure you don't let it break you, enjoy the ride 
 You don't get much time, so make it the time of your life 
 'Cause I'm enjoying mine, 'cause I'm enjoying mine 
 Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride 
 Ride, ride, ride, turn the lights on 
 Ride, ride, ride, winter too cold, summer too hot 
 Winter too cold, summer too hot
