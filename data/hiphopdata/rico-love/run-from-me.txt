Maybe I'm not ready for 
 Maybe I'm not ready to honest with you 
 Yeah 
 Maybe I just wanna fuck 
 Relationships can only lead to problems with you 
 And I know you wondering, who hurt you in the past? 
 Who made you feel so bad? 
 Who told you all those lies? 
 Who hurt you we goodbye? 
 But I promised that I'd only blame it on me 
 No sense in pointing the finger 
 Cause obviously, nothing's gon' change 
 The fact still remains 
 I'm still left here with this pain 
 So I'll advise you to, run from me 
 That's the best thing for you to do, go on, run from me 
 I'm no good for you, run from me 
 That's the best advice I could give you, run from me, go on girl
