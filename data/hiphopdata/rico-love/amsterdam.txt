Now it all seems like a blur all the things we saw and heard, at least for me it was a first 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 
 Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too, I know I was on you and I didn't even want to land 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 'Cause I remember clearly 
 So hard to describe the energy 
 You had to be there, you had to feel it for yourself 
 Walking through the static of the aromatics, started from the bottom made it to the attic 
 Hoping I don't leave up out this bitch an addict, halfway to the plane and we still going at it, damn 
 And you was so sexy cursing out taxi drivers 
 And you was so public, you was like fuck it, let me ride it 
 So I did and you did, you had that man getting big 
 Wishing I can take you back to where I live, thought about you all the way back to the crib 
 Now it all seems like a blur all the things we saw and heard, at least for me it was a first 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 
 Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too, I know I was on you and I didn't even want to land 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 'Cause I remember clearly 
 All those smoky rooms filled with tiny dancers 
 All those voices calling my name but I ain't tryna answers 
 And when you lay down on me, I couldn't help but stand 
 Had me all at attention, lost in this wonderland 
 I was so in tune, didn't notice anyone else that was in the room 
 Made a small shower, so all the wallflowers didn't have any other choose but to bloom 
 Each moment run to the other, saw the beauty in every colour 
 Me and you standing in the light, then you was like, let me get a light 
 Now it all seems like a blur all the things we saw and heard, at least for me it was a first 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 
 Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too, I know I was on you and I didn't even want to land 
 Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? 'Cause I remember clearly
