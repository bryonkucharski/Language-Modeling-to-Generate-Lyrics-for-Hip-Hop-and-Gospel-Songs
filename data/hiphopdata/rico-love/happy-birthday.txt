Wanna make her feel like she just turned 21 
 Wanna take her out with all her friends and let 'em all get fucked up 
 Throw an after party in the penthouse when we done 
 And Ion wanna see none of y'all walking around with empty cups 
 Turn the lights on, you me to tell me you flew this far, to be acting all bougie 
 Them heels, that dress, you bad and you ought to be shaking ya booty 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Happy birthday, happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 Happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 Of course I'm trying to flaunt you 
 I'll take you out to space I'm dying to launch you 
 I want you, I'mma always want you, you know I'mma want you 
 Can't say if I died 'cause I'm never going to 
 Fuck around and spend a hundred fifty on you 
 Wuarter on clothes, another fifty on shoes 
 Look so good with them jeans on 
 You should hit the surgeon and put some titties on too 
 Won't lie, time zooms by in Mumbai 
 Dinner in Abu Dhabi, the thrills I provide 
 Show you what the world 'bout, even bring your girls out 
 Whole lot of fly shit, you gon' soon try, yeah, turn the lights on 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Happy birthday, happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 Happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 I wish we could celebrate, I wish we could drink till we levitate 
 I wish that our ex's would never hate, and when they mix my shit give it hella bass 
 I told her zazazz, zzazz, zzza, how you make an outfit look so exquisite? 
 If I say hop, say how high and rip it, if I get knocked, then you better visit 
 Yo I think I gotta thing for them débutantes 
 The ones that be in the upper echelon 
 It ain't you birthday, but you in you birthday suit 
 So I might as well give you all the head you want 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Oh shit, here we are, champagne, caviar 
 Poke your lips out, blow them candles, you're a superstar 
 Happy birthday, happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 Happy birthday 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight 
 I really just wanna have a good time tonight
