Give me joy, give me violence 
 Give me noise, give me silence 
 Hear my voice, feel my torment 
 But don't rejoice, when I lay dormant 
 America, told me what I should feel 
 And there it was to my surprise I learned that nothing's real 
 And those clouds only come out when it rains 
 So don't get too comfortable, just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it 
 They told me to stay for the kids, so I did 
 They say love's only meant for the happy ones 
 So why do I feel like this? 
 Don't call a quits, stay for the kids 
 But what we gonna do when they grow up 
 Stay for the kids 
 But what we gonna do when they grow up 
 Turn the lights on 
 She say she love a nigga, she say she love a nigga 
 But if you fuck up, she gon' go and fuck another nigga 
 You wanna hate her, but you feel too deep in love with her 
 Now you got kids by it, and you know bloods thicker 
 No longer doing things that we once did 
 Eyes rolling, attitude over dumb shit 
 Direct deposit, you be smiling when the funds hit 
 For a second, then you bringing up that one bitch 
 Yeah I hit it, I'll admit it 
 Yeah, yeah I did it, when I shoulda been committed 
 The gloved fitted, so I would not be acquitted 
 Sentenced to death to us apart, who's fault is it? 
 And those clouds only come out when it rains 
 I just hope I get a couple of visits 
 So don't get too comfortable 
 Just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it 
 They told me to stay for the kids, so I did 
 They say love's only meant for the happy ones 
 So why do I feel like this? 
 Don't call a quits, stay for the kids 
 But what we gonna do when they grow up 
 Stay for the kids 
 But what we gonna do when they grow up 
 Turn the lights on
