Funny how strangers, can turn into way more 
 I'm waking up late night, calling ya name 
 First time that I saw you, I wanted to say more 
 I was speechless, but when you left I had so much to say 
 Our time has come to bid farewell 
 Let's hold on to these moments, for how long, time only tells 
 Wondering where will you be this time next year 
 Hoping it will be with me right here 
 I love you like, summertime, summer nights, summer days 
 It's breaking this heart of mine, whenever you go away 
 I love you like, summertime, summer nights, summer days 
 It's breaking this heart of mine, whenever you go away 
 Beach house in the Hamptons, the month of July 
 On the patio, bumping Mumford and Sons getting high 
 We got slightly acquainted 
 She unfamiliar with entertainers that's awesome ain't it? 
 Felt so far from famous, I felt more courageous 
 Them other brauds I dated, made me think all brauds were jaded, trippy right? 
 Is this a summer fling, or an every summer thing 
 Some many places she can be, why she up under me 
 Start to panic when I think about our separation 
 It's so romantic, but I think we got sleep deprivation 
 I learned your body, and I'm grateful for my education 
 Graduated straight A's, Damn this was the best vacation 
 Wondering where will you be this time next year 
 Turn the lights on, hoping it will be with me right here
