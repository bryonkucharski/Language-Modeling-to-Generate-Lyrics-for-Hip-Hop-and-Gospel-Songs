No you can't say if I'm mad or not 
 Smoking hella weed, I'm on that alcohol 
 Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off 
 I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out 
 What would you do if you heard I got it going on? 
 I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip (I had to) 
 Gotta watch for 12, 'round my town you might get killed (better watch for 12) 
 I'm out my mind, yea I'm high above the rim (I'm on my mind) 
 You cop it live, boy I got in on film 
 You gotta watch out where you rocking, shit get real 
 Drink your real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel 
 Gotta take a long drive up the hill 
 Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals 
 I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft 
 Chicago baby she just wanna drill 
 The vibes so wavy, it's too hard to kill 
 Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real 
 No you can't say if I'm mad or not 
 Smoking hella weed, I'm on that alcohol 
 Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off 
 I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out 
 What would you do if you heard I got it, burned it all? 
 I let it burn, skrt that mark, I had to dip (I had to) 
 Better watch for 12, 'round my town you might get killed (better watch for 12) 
 I'm out my mind, yea I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind) 
 You cop it live, boy I got it all on film 
 Must be cautious, told the lil' hoes I'm all in

 You know I hit in the morning, oh yeah she yawning 
 I met you in the club, bitch you know this shit be nothing 
 Oh then I hit your cousin, mhm, no no discussion 
 Sipping on lean, on Robitussin 
 Oh yea I know you love me, I beat it ain't no cuddling 
 You down bad, you suffering 
 I don't give a fuck how hard it get 
 That lil' bitch know I started this 
 Uh huh, oh yea 
 Get to the cash, no layup 
 Spend a big bag, Rodeo 
 Some may ride for the first time 
 Hoes come through just to touch us 
 I'ma tell the truth like Usher 
 You already know how I bust her 
 Slang my chop from Russia 
 I'ma swang, and a swang, and a swang to the left 
 Pop, pop my trunk 
 Dip, dip, dip, dip 
 I'ma swang, and a swang, and a swang to the left 
 Pop, pop my trunk
