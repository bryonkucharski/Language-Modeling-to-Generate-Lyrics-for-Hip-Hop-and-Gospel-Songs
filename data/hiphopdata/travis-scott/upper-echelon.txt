Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out)

 Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out) 
 We so high, upper echelon (Straight up) 
 We so fuckin' high, upper echelon 
 Dozin' off them Xannies, just popped a bandie 
 Wave rock like Atlantic, froze like Atlantic 
 Party at the Sphinx, damn that's so outlandish 
 She gon' make it clap, clap, throw them bands 
 Walkin' through the Waldorf they know my name here 
 Dropped out, got signed, got mom house all in the same year 
 Don't you come around me, ain't got the time, B, naww 
 Watch me do the Randy, touchdown 
 Knew how much I get, think La Flame the golden child 
 Ridin' right behind her, pull up beside her 
 We poppin' champagne, damn you apple cider 
 Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out) 
 We so high, upper echelon (Straight up) 
 We so fuckin' high, upper echelon 
 Aight Travis, let get it, Hustle Gang, nigga 
 You niggas a mess, I swear you best show some respect 
 Or else I guarantee you'll get wet 
 You fuckin' with us, I suggest you invest in a vest 
 A choppa no less than a tech 
 You niggas want trouble in that I'm the best 
 They just wanna talk, I ain't finna do that 
 I just might pull up wherever you at 
 Put my foot in your ass and a hole in your hat 
 Ok, hol' up, let me freeze up 
 These niggas must have caught amnesia 
 My face card in these streets cuh 
 A-1 credit, no Visa 
 Excuse me shawty don't get me started 
 If yo shit sick, my shit retarded 
 Motherfucker can't see the tree but before I get wrong 
 Get shot then leave 'em in the forest 
 Boom, wait till the end of the Earth 
 Just to get my check, interfere, get hurt 
 Hey, first thing first, this what I do 
 I'm a king mothafucka who the hell are you? 
 Check suckas off top, I bet I do 
 Hustle Gang in it bitch, you better lay down fool 
 We crème de la crème fuck them fuck niggas 
 Top shelf upper echelon can't fuck with us 
 Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out) 
 We so high, upper echelon (Straight up) 
 We so fuckin' high, upper echelon 
 Uh, pull up in the rari, my ho beside me 
 It's a two seater, your bitch can't ride, ho I'm sorry 
 Let's get it jumpin', call it center court 
 On the loud, you can smell that scent on me in court 
 Just beat the case, call it Larry Holmes 
 On the plane with your bitch and a carry on 
 I do it for my city, then I fly away 
 I can see tomorrow, I'm so high today 
 I told 'em let's pray, I keep killin' verses 
 Yo bitch with me, she wearin' killer purses 
 Pull out that 7, Mac-11 
 Pastor, reverend, Versace heaven 
 Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out) 
 We so high, upper echelon (Straight up) 
 We so fuckin' high, upper echelon 
 La Flame, straight up!
