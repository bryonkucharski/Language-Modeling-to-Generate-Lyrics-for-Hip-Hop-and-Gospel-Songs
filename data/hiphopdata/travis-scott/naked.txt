I just wanna spread my wings 
 Life ain't what it seems 
 Someone in this cruel world 
 Escaping through the night 
 Look into my night, my thoughts 
 Naked in this cruel world 
 Tears dripping on my pillow thoughts is in my head 
 See my dreams jump out my window if I follow I'll be dead 
 And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead 
 Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand 
 And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night 
 The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight 
 Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols 
 I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner 
 You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga 
 I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink 
 And she don't want to dance 'less she drink 
 Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx? 
 Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links 
 Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E 
 Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon 
 Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon
