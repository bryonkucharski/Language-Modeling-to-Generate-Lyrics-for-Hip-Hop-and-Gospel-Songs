Metro Boomin want some more nigga 
 Back hitting licks, back on that dirty 
 Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies 
 Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early 
 If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her 
 Black out nigga, deeper than a frat house nigga 
 Doper than the crack house nigga 
 20/20 Lambo, new edition 
 Gotta hit two gears just to back out, nigga (La Flame) 
 Been a hell of a night but hell of a dykes cost a hell of a price 
 With a devil in a new dress on the 35th floor, nigga 
 God damn that's a hell of a sight! 
 Damn right that is, damn right she drowned my kids 
 Damn right don't doubt, damn right 
 Damn right I hit, anything I said I did 
 Damn right, only roll that gas don't pass that mid 
 Just treat a pint like a handle 
 When I'm with your girl, I hit your girl in the bando 
 Know I go commando 
 Know I need my cheese, know my cheese, know the nachos 
 Fall back, back, back, when you see me 
 Fall back when you see me tweakin' 
 Throw that ass back, back, back, back, know a nigga might throw that ticket 
 Feds hit my block, it got hot 
 But I'm back up in this bitch and I can't stop 
 Back hitting licks, back on that dirty 
 Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies 
 Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early 
 If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her 
 Back hitting licks, back on that dirty 
 Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies 
 Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early 
 If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her
