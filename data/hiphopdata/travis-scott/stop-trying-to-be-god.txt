This is the rewatch, the hot pockets, the fritters, the missiles, the humans, all gathered in secrecy 
 And flying high as a kite 
 (Hm hm) just know what this about (hm, hm hm) 
 (Hm hm) palm trees, oceans 
 Fresh air that can break your heart 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm) 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's not who you are 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's just not your job 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God 
 Ride for it every night 
 Visions and these angles tight 
 Truth be told I never try 
 Diamonds of the wifin' like 
 All three Rollies look alike 
 After two you get a hook-up price 
 Stripper never worked a nine to five 
 Delta and I ship it overnight 
 Stop tryna be God almighty 
 Fuck the money, never leave your people behind 
 It's never love, no matter what you try 
 Still can see it comin' down your eyes 
 'Cause they did not create commandments (ooh ooh) 
 When you hustle, always make it fancy (ooh ooh) 
 The signal's far from what you can be (ooh ooh) 
 'Cause air traffic controls the landing 
 Yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm) 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's not who you are 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's just not your job 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God 
 Stop tryna play God almighty 
 Always keep your circle tight 
 I been wantin' shit my whole life 
 I wanted you bad, not tryna play God tonight 
 If I love her I'ma pass her one 
 First rule of war, you find an act of one 
 You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her 
 But never turn your back on her 
 'Cause they did not create commandments 
 When you hustle, always make it fancy 
 The signal's far from what you can be 
 'Cause air traffic controls the landing 
 Yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 You won't succeed tryna learn me 
 Stick to the roads in my journey 
 Stay out of court when you got the attorney 
 She say she love 'em, want to really burn me 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm) 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's not who you are 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God 
 (Hm hm) that's just not your job 
 (Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God 
 Is it the complex of the saint that's keeping you so, so still? 
 Is it a coat of old paint that's peelin' every day against our will? 
 Is it too long since the last open conversation you had? oh no 
 And did you see the void in the past, and can you ever see it comin' back? 
 Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me? 
 Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me? 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 That it?
