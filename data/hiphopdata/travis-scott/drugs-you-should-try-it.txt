I try it if it feels right 
 This feels nice 
 I've been down and lost for days 
 Glad I found you on the way 
 When the day gets better, the night gets brighter 
 I always feel this way 
 Through the hills 
 I hear you callin', miles and miles away 
 We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin' 
 I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options 
 I played the drums, she rolled the joints 
 I rocked the club, we both throw up 
 We was the band you never heard before 
 You got that tat above your crack 
 And on your cat you be right back 
 Your momma never know 
 We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones 
 When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone 
 I take that puff, you take that puff 
 You know we never care to overdose 
 I try it if it feels right 
 This feels nice 
 I've been down and lost for days 
 Glad I found you on the way 
 When the day gets better, the night gets brighter 
 I always feel this way 
 Through the hills 
 I hear you callin', miles and miles away 
 Shit I tried it, it feels nice 
 Shit just kinda feels nice 
 Miles and miles away 
 Miles and miles away 
 When you're home alone in the mood 
 I know you wanna move 
 I know you wanna dance 
 I know you're gettin' ready to 
 Chase the night away 
 When you're home alone in the mood 
 I know you wanna move 
 I know you wanna dance 
 I know you're gettin' ready to 
 Chase the night away
