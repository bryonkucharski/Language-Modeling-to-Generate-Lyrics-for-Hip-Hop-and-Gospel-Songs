Our first kiss in the livin' room 
 That's a hella way to end the night 
 A hella way to end the night 
 We did drugs in the bedroom 
 That's a hella way to end the night 
 A hella way to end the night 
 But she caught me fuckin' in the bathroom 
 Rubbers all over the bathroom 
 That's a hella way to end the night 
 Tonight (Tonight) 
 I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth 
 Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead 
 It's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes 
 All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes 
 She hit me twice in the face, there goes the base 
 She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace 
 She say she love me but don't know what love is 
 I lost love 'cause my daddy said it but ain't ever done shit 
 Pain is love and love is hell 
 I might need some bail if this shit don't sell 
 Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji 
 Slow motionin' through emotion just in case a nigga see me 
 They'll come and feed you but that felt a little easy 
 I brought the squeegee case it get a little greasy 
 After a moment I fell into the mist 
 She reminisce a nigga style, God damn a nigga rich 
 Wine and cigarettes under a light 
 Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night 
 I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth 
 Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead 
 Oh, it's a hell of a night 
 It's a hell of a night
