 Them lips on fire and them hips don't lie

 Let's lose each other's mind 
 Let's make each other's night

 Big blood like Freddy in dreams (Bitch) 
 Dressed in a tie like the Dean (Bitch) 
 Drunk and in love with my baby 
 Baby do not go fast, go slow, wait 
 Tell me, tell me information, I got rained on me 
 Let's take a shot together and then lay up like planks 
 Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady 
 Patrón down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake 
 Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise) 
 Every time I try to stick it in all the way 
 Baby girl be like "ay ay, ay ay"
