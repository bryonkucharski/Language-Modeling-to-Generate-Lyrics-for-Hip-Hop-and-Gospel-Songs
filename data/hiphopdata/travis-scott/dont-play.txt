I drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown 
 Has he got enough money to spend? 
 Leave? No! He's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go 
 Has he got enough money to spend? 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 Know I need my dollars 
 Know a nigga need my commas 
 She was down when I dropped out of college 
 Down, she was down when I rode Impalas 
 Played with her pussy in the Jeep 
 Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' 
 Jumped in the car when she hit my digits 
 Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects 
 Easy to me my nigga 
 Villa with a scene, youngin' always seen with a killer 
 Hand stitched by my dealer 
 Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela? 
 She even got the 'scripts for the cough 
 In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off 
 It ain't been a minute since they seen a weird nigga 
 From the corner put it on for the south 
 On my momma, know a nigga be coasting 
 Go nigga, go nigga grab my bottles 
 Go nigga, go nigga grab my chronic 
 Keep ya head up in the air my nigga 
 Niggas gon' be billionaires my nigga 
 Fuck how much time that shit might take 
 Niggas ain't playin' with 'em! 
 (Playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em!) 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 B.I.G Sean Don, my aura gold, you know it 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 Bitch don't you play me, don't you try me 
 I need the exact amount 
 Look at my face, ho, eye-to-eye me 
 I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire 
 When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it 
 I mean, goddamn, nigga! 
 You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from 
 Where you can't come, where it ain't none 
 Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns 
 Where they hate from 
 But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one 
 Where there's fuckin' tank guns 
 But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one 
 If I ain't got it then I'm huntin' 
 I'm either countin' or I'm cummin' 
 Swear I just done bought that mansion 
 Treat that shit like it's a dungeon 
 Up at 5AM still workin', but I treat it like it's 1 
 I'm never actin' like I got it 
 Bitch I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas! 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with these niggas 
 I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas
