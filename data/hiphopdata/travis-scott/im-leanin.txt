Studies say humans forget 90% of their dream 
 Upon the first 10 minutes of waking 
 They say most people don't even remember 
 99% of the dreams they ever even had 
 As dream chasers we're the exception 
 Hundred grand large on the watch, blessed 
 Quarter mil for the Mulsanne, flex 
 All my niggas gon' cash checks 
 And all y'all niggas look mad stressed 
 And we ain't even made niggas mad yet 
 'Cause next time I grab, I'm a grab jet 
 I might go Bugatti, with a bad bitch beside me 
 Nigga hotter than Wasabi, get that ass wet 
 Young niggas going hard in the streets 
 We ain't ever know to call the police 
 Got birds for the twenty five K 
 Sounds like a bargain to me 
 Young nigga getting money 
 In the Bent, leather looking like spalding to me 
 And I don't know what no line look like 
 Hundred bad bitches gettin' all in with me 
 Get 'em all in for free 
 Started, started with a quarter ounce of hard rock 
 And now I got a lot of cars 
 If a nigga talk foreigns, got a car lot 
 And everybody talkin' money 
 But they ain't showing numbers like the call block 
 And all I do is count money 
 Fuck pretty ass hoes, and car shop 
 Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin' 
 Young rich nigga, I'm leanin' 
 Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad bitches 
 Looking like Nia Long I mean it 
 Nigga I'm leanin', leanin' 
 Young rich nigga, I'm leanin' 
 Sippin' on promethazine that nigga 
 My team got money all season 
 Nigga I'm leanin' 
 Mmm, leanin', damn near spilled my semen (straight up) 
 Had a twenty-twenty on my preacher wife 
 Damn near see my demons (La Flame!) 
 Loose furs, hyenas 
 For the love of money, it's a leaner 
 Vatos losing their nerves, bird niggas on the curbs 
 And let 'em pull up and do the Macarena 
 H-town niggas spilled Peach Crush on my jeans 
 Never go far with no bitch with no condoms 
 Unless they can cover the lease on my beamer (straight up) 
 Ah, you know, Louboutins don't touch my hoes 
 Let's go down in Ibiza town 
 We get cold, you don't need no coat 
 Motherfucker, I'm leanin' 
 Don't talk to me, couple street niggas 
 Think twice before crossing me 
 Meek, these niggas shit can't last that long 
 Why these motherfuckers keep bothering me 
 I'm leanin', for a minute you had me 
 Then the second I caught it when it passed me 
 Oh no (straight up) 
 Somebody pass me a blunt and a double world cup 
 Motherfucker, motherfucker... 
 Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin' 
 Young rich nigga, I'm leanin' 
 Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad bitches 
 Looking like Nia Long I mean it 
 Nigga I'm leanin', leanin' 
 Young rich nigga, I'm leanin' 
 Sippin' on promethazine that nigga 
 My team got money all season 
 Nigga I'm leanin' 
 See we started trap, before we was rap 
 And then we was, trappin' at rap 
 Shining on these hoes, high life 
 This what we live now 
 Blowin' out the pop 
 Italian on the floor nigga 
 You understand me 
 Stepping onto a mil nigga 
 (They say money rule the world 
 You can't pay God with it) 
 Step your game up nigga 
 Or lose your bitch nigga 
 It's just that simple 
 Yeah, we dreamchasers 
 We out there gettin' this money 
 So you can't fuck with everybody 
 'Cause everybody ain't at your motherfucking level 
 So the motherfuckers that don't understand you 
 They wind up motherfucking hating you 
 So you know what you gotta do 
 You gotta hate those motherfuckers too 
 Fuck them niggas 
 Fuck they motherfucking mommmas 
 They daddies, they aunts, they uncles 
 And they little tee tees, too 
 Ayo, suck a dick 
 Meek Mill, let's get it
