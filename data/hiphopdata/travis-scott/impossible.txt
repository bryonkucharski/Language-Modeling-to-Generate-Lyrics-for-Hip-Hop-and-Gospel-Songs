You the one, you know me the best 
 You the one I call when I'm stressed 
 This the time of the year I feel alone 
 This the time of the year you treat me wrong 
 This the late night, you know the deal (deal) 
 On a late night, nowhere to chill 
 Yeah, I'm on the west, yeah, I'm on the west side 
 Off the drugs, no, I'm not the best guy 
 But you know I always get it done 
 You done had all of the rappers, I'm the one, yeah 
 Ain't gon' lie, I remember how it feels, yeah 
 Ain't gon' lie, I'mma tell you this for real, yeah 
 Split a pack of the woods down 
 Ride with me, yeah, you wish you could now 
 Always come and go and never fail 
 It was never love, I could tell now 
 She popping more Blue Chanel just to get it up 
 Parking lot full of foreign hoes on the regular 
 With them painted toes in them heels 
 Let's go find a place that's far from here, for real 
 Nights like this, nights like this, I wish I could do the impossible 
 I wish I could do the impossible 
 Nights like this, nights like this, I wish 
 I could do the impossible, I could do the impossible 
 You the one, you know me the best 
 You the one I call when I'm stressed 
 This the time of the year when I'm alone 
 This the time of the year we get our own 
 I can't lie when I ride on the west 
 Yeah, the west, yeah, yeah, the west side 
 And lately I ain't been feeling the best 
 'Cause you the best, yeah, you my best high 
 They know what you're dealing with 
 Now you know what's wrong, what the feeling is 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Rastas rolling in Benz up in here 
 Bandits poppin' them bars up. 
 Man don't run up the bands that make them gun claps in here 
 No fear, no fear, you rock, I hear 
 I'm gon' let you know that the man is for real 
 Yeah, for real, for real 
 Nights like this, nights like this, I wish I could do the impossible 
 I wish I could do the impossible 
 Nights like this, nights like this, I wish 
 I could do the impossible, I could do the impossible 
 I wish I could do the impossible 
 I wish I could do the impossible 
 I could do the impossible
