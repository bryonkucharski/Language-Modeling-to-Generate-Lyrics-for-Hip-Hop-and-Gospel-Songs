My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service 
 I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous 
 I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool 
 Gotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through 
 I got shit to lose 
 Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake 
 I got shit to do 
 Had to move, with the crew, away from you 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 And you never liked it, and you never liked them 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 And you never liked it, and you never liked them 
 My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service 
 I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous 
 I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool 
 Gotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through 
 I got shit to lose 
 Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake 
 I got shit to do 
 Had to move, with the crew, away from you 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 And you never liked it, and you never liked them 
 And I never liked it, and I never liked them 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 Steady with the crew, steady with the crew 
 And you never liked it, and you never liked them 
 And I never liked it, and I never liked them 
 You know what, we grew on 
 We go back like futons and coupons 
 We too bad, we too wild, we too young 
 Shake some, my niggas gon' shake some 
 Fall through and break somethin' 
 Broad day, and take somethin' 
 Backwards, I've been livin' backwards 
 On my mattress, orgies on my mattress 
 Flashes, dreamin', havin' flashes 
 Dashin', hopin' I don't crash it 
 My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
