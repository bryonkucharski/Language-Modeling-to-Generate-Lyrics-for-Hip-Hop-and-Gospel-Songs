Oh, no praying for love 
 Oh, say loud 
 Just ask the lonely, oh 
 Just ask the lonely, oh 
 Pray for who lost they fate, and died too young 
 Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love 
 Pray for my liver when I'm off, in this club 
 I pray that the, demons go away, they hauntin' us 
 Man I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been livin' 
 Man I can't take no more of the white powers in position 
 Gotta grab J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich 
 Told Chase we ain't goin' back, you know, we gotta hitch 
 I mean I'm, aggravated, agitated, I admit 
 Intoxicated, animated, got me feelin' kinda lit 
 Contemplatin' fornicatin', might as well fuck up some shit 
 They lookin' at me way too crazy, got me feelin' communist 
 But I'm just tryin' to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix 
 If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick 
 Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz 
 It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us 
 Oh, no praying for love 
 Oh, say loud 
 Just ask the lonely, oh 
 Just ask the lonely, oh 
 Pills 
 Have you ever been through life's 
 Challenges? Promises? 
 Get down here, I'm prayin' 
 Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques 
 Let me tell you how I turned Scott 
 How I went down on the block 
 Waterfall around ten o'clock 
 And how we came up gettin' all the knots, dodgin' cops, yeah 
 'Fore a nigga had the locks 
 'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops 
 Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch 
 Every time we in the party, took it up a notch 
 Now I'm thinkin' 'bout this new girl, and she doin' pop (Oh) 
 Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box 
 (Don't pray for love) 
 Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh) 
 And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Said I-) 
 Mama don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more 
 I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor 
 You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow 
 And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow 
 Pray for love 
 No, oh 
 We don't pray for love, no more 
 We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more 
 We don't wanna see you on the news, no more 
 All alone 
 Underrated is an understatement 
 They tryin' to test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid 
 These niggas fiends watchin' all of my moves 
 Cause the music like crack, got me cookin' all day 
 I'm right here, you know where I stay 
 And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way 
 She like my show lights, she want to be wife 
 She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life 
 So I pull out 'fore the climax 
 Faster than a hi-hat, sorry baby, I don't play 
 And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin' 
 And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me 
 My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce 
 Like they sell that coke boy, shout out to the Coke Boys 
 They never pray for us, nobody pray for us 
 Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no 
 Oh, no praying for love 
 Oh, say loud 
 Just ask the lonely, oh 
 Just ask the lonely, oh
