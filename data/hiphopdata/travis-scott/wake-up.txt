I don't wanna wake up 
 I want you spread out on the sheets 
 Said her pussy so good 
 And her pussy so sweet 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 I want it flowing through my streams 
 Getting me hot 
 Under my feet 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 Please don't wake me up, I feel it creeping (yeah) 
 Controlling how you moving, lucid dreaming (dreams) 
 Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah 
 Took the belt-way down to your hood 
 Say you was in the crowd, I never looked 
 Looking back how things came back around 
 Guess I was hooked 
 Burn the bread and then we burn the town 
 We both was cooked, yeah 
 Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin' 
 Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamon 
 I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend 
 That's coco out my ice tea (coco, yeah, yeah) 
 Bend her over for some piping (it's lit) 
 Bust a cloud, shoot the lightning (pop it) 
 Pop it now, no, we can't sleep 
 I don't wanna wake up (yeah) 
 Want you spread out on the sheets (it's lit) 
 Say, pussy so good (pop it) 
 Oh, pussy so sweet (yeah) 
 When I wake up (yeah, yeah) 
 Wanna drop top on the beach (straight up) 
 Getting me high, yeah (yeah) 
 Under my feet 
 When I wake up 
 You decide if I live or die 
 When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky 
 I just want your body close to me (oh) 
 And if I OD 
 I'll be alone with no heartbeat 
 I hold the hills with a coast in the Lambo 
 And the doors going up, suicide 
 I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up) 
 I want you spread out on the sheets (want you spread out on the sheets) 
 'Cause that pussy so good (pussy so good) 
 Girl, that pussy so sweet (pussy so sweet) 
 I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up) 
 I want it flowing through my streams (want it flowing through my streams) 
 Getting me hot (getting me hot) 
 Under my feet (under my feet) 
 I don't wanna wake up
