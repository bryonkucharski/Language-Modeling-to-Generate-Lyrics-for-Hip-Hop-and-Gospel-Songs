Dis type of shit happens everyday 
 All dem I'm under mourn for people pon stay 
 But none of dem have the guts to pull out and spray 
 None of them have the guts to pull out and spray 
 I got diamonds on my blocka, serve it to my flocka 
 Yeah, that's my flocka... to my flocka 
 Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper 
 Yeah, that's my flocka 
 I'm that Ferragamo Hussein, Tom Cruisin', Rock Of Ages 
 Semi-god estate, gettin' cake, could've thought I'm Jewish 
 Fuck, fuck, fuck, might lose your soul for my language 
 Nowadays's, niggas been at round tables talking all that heinous language 
 Plutonica, insomnia 
 Put that money on your head, Balenciaga yarmulke 
 Fifteen when I carried loads of them Ozium's 
 And them bag of nicks, I mean groceries 
 I mean daddy knows ain't no controlling me 
 My bad, look Scotty might sag 
 She give me head before the ass and never let no nigga smash 
 No puffing, no pass 
 We breaking if we can get half, thank you for making it last; 
 Get everything that you got 
 Break me a piece of that off, rest in peace niggas I lost 
 I got diamonds on my blocka, serve it to my flocka 
 Yeah, that's my flocka... to my flocka 
 Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper 
 Yeah, that's my flocka 
 Oh God, this shit too cold for the mink, Ye 
 Bang, bang, bang, my niggas ain't tamed 
 Might buried your ass in that Sphinx, mane 
 Sip Merlot, watch us make the champagne rain 
 Let my ding-a-lang hang, I'm a south side nigga where the 'caine reign 
 We running, summers, we running 
 Spring and fall, jogging be nothing 
 Winter, they cuffing, cuffing them up as they loving 
 The same month as my niggas stuffing 
 Riding through, rockin', Shaka Zulu 
 Block Crip or whole family blue; bloody, yeah, su-woo 
 Ain't you supposed to preach what you practice? 
 Put a rubber on if you stabbing 
 Get baptized if you baptist but ain't it evil to live backwards 
 Holy Ghost, hold on 
 Chakalu blakalu los: that's tongue for you niggas who lost 
 I got diamonds on my blocka, serve it to my flocka 
 Yeah, that's my flocka... to my flocka 
 Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper 
 Yeah, that's my flocka
