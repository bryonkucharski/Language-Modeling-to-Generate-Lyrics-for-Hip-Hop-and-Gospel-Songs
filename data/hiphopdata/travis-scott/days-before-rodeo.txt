Midnight awakin', hyper ventilatin' 
 Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe wild goose chasin' 
 After three number one albums woulda thought I'd feel amazin' 
 Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor 
 Still rollin' up swishas 
 Now its beamers double parking, fuck payin' the meter 
 In your club, on your couch, just got paid to be here 
 On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features 
 How could they tease us, only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out 
 I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house 
 Around 3 AM dog 
 I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall 
 Bad mamacita, Miami heat her, put it in a two seater 
 Too bad I couldn't three peat her 
 Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper 
 House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter 
 With more stamps than a skinny nigga got tats on my Visa 
 I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out 
 I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out 
 I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house 
 Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus 
 I might fuck around, lose my mind 
 Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus
