Mamacita, cita, cita 
 Mamacita, cita, cita 
 This the last days to the rodeo, last night 
 Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think 
 Sun shades and a pill gon' help 
 Once I'm gone, can't tame myself 
 Mamacita, cita, cita 
 You know I really need yah, need yah, need yah, right now 
 She get freaky when the... light's down 
 The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down 
 With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown 
 Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town 
 They got them pornstar big booties 
 Let me film it, then shoot it 
 3-D money, no illusion 
 Depending if I'm feelin' bougie 
 Might hit your line bitch 
 Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper 
 Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer 
 Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her 
 And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita 
 Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
 Mamacita, cita, cita 
 That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
 That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
 Mamacita, cita, cita 
 That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
 Mothafuck a girl 
 I love her, I'mma give her the world 
 Aye, fuck her, I wanna fuck her mother 
 Just might give her my little girl 
 No, no, I won't let go, roll down, oh 
 She look the best with a fro, natural nat-nat on go 
 Damn, Quan, turn on the stove, whip it till I have a stroke 
 I do not fuck with America, I get it straight off the boat 
 Oh, damn, the kush it never make me choke 
 Slow down, I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham 
 Damn, 25 thousand on an old school Cam 
 SS me, these bitches wan' molest me 
 Damn, they'll sex me, she a lesbi 
 She want chicken like sesame 
 And she tryin' to undress me, test me 
 Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, you dig? 
 Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper 
 Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer 
 Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her 
 And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita

 That's my bad little college ho 
 That I got on the east skirts of Decatur 
 Best believe that she cover Rich Homie Quan like a blazer 
 I smoke a lot of weed, keep my music turned up, fuck my neighbors 
 I fuck a nigga bitch and turn her like a table 
 Aye, I'm still practicin' so you know I'm gettin' greater 
 Aye, still wearin' long socks and shorts like Fabo 
 He was hatin' at first, now he tryna make the payroll 
 Got a stupid bitch who do whatever I say so 
 Money on my head like a Jesus piece 
 Blunt, now I'm higher than Khalifa be 
 Bad bitch lookin' like a Filipina 
 Oh, you're killin' me, oh, remember me 
 You, finna be, deceased if you keep callin' me 
 Therefore I 
 Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper 
 Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer 
 Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her 
 And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita 
 Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
 Mamacita, cita, cita 
 That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
