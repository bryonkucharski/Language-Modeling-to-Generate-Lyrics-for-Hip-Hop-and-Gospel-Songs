Where the weather is warm 
 Moonlight move when a nigga dance 
 Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance 
 Had to leave home wasn't working out 
 Kiss moms for me if you get a chance 
 Walk the streets where I stay 
 Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait 
 In the moonlight you can't see my eyes 
 And when I'm off the things I can't think 
 Man I been coasting the coast 
 Swear a young nigga done been through the most 
 Washing my mind out with dope 
 Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke 
 When they recognize a real nigga still 
 Ride with me, down with me, say he a float 
 And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP 
 Shoving champagne through the next girl throat 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Let's get high, and go dance on the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 We could fly, and go straight to the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon 
 Where the weather is warm and we forever live long 
 Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew? 
 Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was over due 
 Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway 
 Taking trips to the side of the moon 
 I just take trips to define my peace 
 But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb 
 I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick 
 Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke 
 Better let that jack roll down your neck 
 I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix 
 We just go'n cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry bout shit 
 It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party 
 All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist 
 Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa 
 She in that white dress it can't fit her 
 Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver 
 Hit it and she on the moon my nigga 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Let's get high, and go dance on the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 We could fly, and go straight to the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon 
 Where the weather is warm and we forever live long 
 Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up 
 I'm headed to the moon 'cause the west screwed up 
 Like the city I grew up so 
 I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up 
 Got a Xanax crushed up 
 If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up 
 Pull up to the moon with the trunk up 
 Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up 
 Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG 
 In the triple D I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me 
 Back wood feel with a Compton tree 
 Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease 
 Three lines poured up in the big East 
 Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest 
 Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks 
 OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit 
 Def' rocking link, what you know about this 
 Baby bass came through with the kush assist 
 Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon 
 Getting higher than a bitch and I'm doing my dance 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Let's get high, and go dance on the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 We could fly, and go straight to the moon 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon 
 Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
