Stepping of of that lear, diamonds on me so clear 
 Dime hoes that I share, y'all couldn't go near 
 I say, pussy nigga I dare, you try and reached and get aired 
 You fuck around and get checked, doctor pump your chest like clear 
 Yeah my niggas ball all year, y'all niggas so square (lame) 
 And all my niggas so live, why the fuck would I care 
 When that Lambo flow by, y'all suckas gon' stare 
 And all them haters gon' hate, fuck them, cause all them hoes gon' cheer 
 Yeah my might life and my bite life got a bad bitch and she tight and nice 
 'Cause I'm countin' green in my money machine, that bitch sound like I typewrite 
 Hustle hard in that daytime but I ball off in that night life 
 My chain lit with them black stones, but they shine hard as yo white ice 
 'Cause yo shit fake and yo shit late, no birthday but I get cake 
 Lame nigga yo album ain't fucking with my mixtape 
 Nigga smoking that Cali kush, that shit strong no lift weights 
 I tell niggas don't watch me while time tick on that big face 
 Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it 
 Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it 
 Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers 
 Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure 
 Wake me up and I'm snoring, choking over whole gang of chains 
 She slept over the morning, a nigga ain't good with this naming game 
 Ain't need you fucking me over, pyramids on my pinky ring 
 And we dipping out, she pulling in, I guess she get the hang of things 
 So what up (what up), I told her shut the fuck up 
 When I run my mouth diamonds falling out, I guess that bitch done nut up 
 Crazy thing about it, her best friend is riding shotty 
 I knocked her down in her 'Rari, then drove off on Ducatti 
 Holy mother Mary, guess who hitting my Berry 
 A pair of double D's, I guess she out in Paris 
 Damn Tony them cantaloupes, fuck about getting Mary 
 She said her ex was Larry, but fuck that nigga Larry 
 Damn this shit is scary, I thought I seen the fairy 
 Fucking with that white milk, just might call it dairy 
 Ride around just me and Meek, a couple dimes and that's 20 
 Sit behind while we pull around, we might blind with canaries
