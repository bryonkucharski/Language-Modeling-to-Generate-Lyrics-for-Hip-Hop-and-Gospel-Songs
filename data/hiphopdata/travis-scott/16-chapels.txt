I don't know about you 
 Feel like I'm floating through the night 
 Slow move to the groove 
 Often the feeling feels right 
 (Dance like a 90s baby) 
 Feel like I'm floating through traffic 
 (Then it "poof" like magic) 
 This shit be the coldest 
 Wake up nigga, smell the Folgers 
 Fuck she throwing up last night 
 Only if the dumb bitch did what I told her 
 She feel me, I feel her 
 And she even the let me move my fingers up her skirt 
 Fuck it live for the moment 
 Had no bread, now the hoes spread like toast is 
 Her legs spread like Moses 
 On my way, virgin glass we can have a toast 
 To the same ones that love talking that wild shit 
 Be the same ones who wanna be around the most 
 Tony said soon enough niggas will have a two-tone 
 Two blond chicks with the roof gone 
 Complaining now that her breasts out 
 Well at least you could've thought to put the mink on 
 I don't know about you 
 Feel like I'm floating through the night 
 Slow move to the groove 
 Often the feeling feels right 
 Feel like I'm floating through traffic 
 (Then it "poof" like magic) 
 Wet dreams with the prom queen 
 Now I'm tryna screw me a centerfold 
 Every nigga have their wild dreams 
 Mines is to fly to the summer in my winter clothes 
 Sin city is a mile away 
 I see the devil in a skirt, but it's a nightgown 
 Hallelujah, does it even matter if it's night or day 
 When we pull up, she gon' pull her shirt down 
 This where we find em' 
 Same niggas that sniff Donna 
 And get drunk of the Mimosa 
 Space green or designer 
 Hermes based off of drama 
 Call it spendin' yoda 
 Six years catch me trying yoga 
 In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga 
 Throwing a toga party 
 Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty 
 I don't know about you 
 Feel like I'm floating through the night 
 Slow move to the groove 
 Often the feeling feels right 
 Feel like I'm floating through traffic 
 I don't know about you 
 Feel like I'm floating through the night 
 Slow move to the groove 
 Often the feeling feels right 
 Feel like I'm floating through traffic 
 (Then it "poof" like magic)
