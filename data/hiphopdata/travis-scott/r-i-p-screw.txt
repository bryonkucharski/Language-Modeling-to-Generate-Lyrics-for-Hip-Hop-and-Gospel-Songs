Yeah know? 
 (South Side) 
 Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly 
 I gotta let you know, the way 
 I gotta let you know, the way 
 I'm gonna take it all and clean it 
 I'm gonna take it all and spend it 
 (South Side) 
 And that's all I've been sayin' 
 (South Side) 
 If you fall for the games then you're the one playin' 
 Because it's too much money out here 
 And there's too many honey's out here 
 They like to trip off the drank, that's weird 
 They like to trip off the drank, that's weird 
 Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly 
 Oh my God, I just can feel the love 
 Drop top with the windows up 
 Jump inside and won't you roll with us 
 Beat the devil, bite the angel dust 
 Shawty, shawty, please 
 Shawty would you go 
 Shawty what you like 
 Tell me what you want 
 Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly (yeah) 
 I just took a four to the head like "mane" 
 Drop the top on the slab, like "mane" 
 Off the top of the dome like "mane" 
 Nothin' beating home like "mane" 
 And the screw tapes on like "mane" 
 I go Pimp C on the phone like "mane" 
 Flip side platinum don't do chrome like "mane" 
 Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang 
 This shit SUC, smooth like "mane" 
 Rest in peace, Screw, like "mane" 
 Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly 
 Oh my God, I just can feel the love 
 Drop top with the windows up 
 Screw found international sound because 
 Throughout the South, and it's new to um 
 Shawty got a thing for us
