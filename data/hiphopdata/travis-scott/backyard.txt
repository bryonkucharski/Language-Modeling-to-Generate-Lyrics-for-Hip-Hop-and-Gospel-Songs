'Aight play the shit 
 Yuh, yuh, yuh 
 Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth 
 Got what you need, blow that dope, don't get too high 
 From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come take this ride 
 Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott 
 Over one lost trip to the sky 
 Let me tell the tale cause you told the tale 
 When you said I could make it this high 
 Who knew? God dammit who knew? 
 The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue 
 You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes 
 You ready to ride, that's true 
 When they look in my eyes, they see that real 
 How Scotty entired that juice 
 Had my back against that wall 
 Every summer felt so cold 
 My daddy ain't comin' home 'til fall 
 That's why my pimp game so moist 
 Had that du-rag and all 
 Had a 20 year old bitch in high school 
 Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do 
 On the south side of that HOU 
 Hollup, let's take it back to that room 
 No car but still had drive 
 Just a hundred niggas standin' outside 
 Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot 
 I'ma ride for all of my niggas 
 They forever here by my side 
 It was just 8 niggas in a two bedroom 
 No leg room, that was last June, yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah forreal 
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga 
 Let it be known, yeah it's that real 
 Yeah yeah forreal 
 Forreal 
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout 
 We them niggas everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real 
 Yeah, forreal

 Verses, one day you'll find your purpose 
 Now my show's packed out like churches 
 Fans never missin' out a word on the verses 
 Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it 
 That's for certain, I deserve it 
 Lord knows we don't get tired, did more dirt than a derby 
 Momma worked for AT&T and we still ain't get that service 
 She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous 
 Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent 
 If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens 
 And you can keep them herpes, go alert me 
 No house light on, cop light on, fuck this journey 
 You heard me, you heard me, now swervin', hittin' curbs 
 And my nigga, my nigga came home so it just got real 
 Yeah yeah forreal 
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga 
 Let it be known, yeah it's that real 
 Yeah yeah forreal 
 Forreal 
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout 
 We them niggas everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real 
 Yeah, forreal
