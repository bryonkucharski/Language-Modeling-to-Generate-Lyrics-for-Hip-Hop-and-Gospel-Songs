Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes 
 Hop off a jet, barely get rest 
 Cash through the month, I get a check 
 Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest 
 Chanel, her dress 
 Clean up her mess 
 I eat her flesh, you know the rest 
 Count up a hun', cop a Rolex 
 Shine like the sun, you truly blessed 
 Two-tone Patek 
 You tell me text in the club, ball like I Ubered these jets 
 VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet 
 Put a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks 
 I went to school where they teach you finesse 
 Five hundred shells for the drip I invest 
 I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk 
 Know the coupe fast when they end with a S 
 Now that I'm home, back off the road 
 We shut it down, say it ain't so 
 With checks in the streets, shade number four 
 Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes 
 Take it with me, double your dose 
 Covered with angels that's watching my soul 
 Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows 
 Said I'll be there in 10, but I got there in four 
 I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold 
 I left her wide open, no self control 
 Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove 
 Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes 
 Hop off a jet, barely get rest 
 Cash through the month, I get a check 
 Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest 
 Chanel, her dress 
 Clean up her mess 
 I eat her flesh, you know the rest 
 Count up a hun', cop a Rolex 
 Shine like the sun, you truly blessed 
 Two-tone Pateks 
 Fendi clipboard like I Uber the jets 
 VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet 
 It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks 
 I went to school where they teach you finesse 
 Five hundred shells for the drip I invest 
 I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk 
 Know the coupe fast when they end with a S 
 La Flame on a island 
 Me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet 
 Got Prada's, every color 
 And I got CC's you ain't seen yet 
 Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking, "where the codeine at"? 
 30 pointers and up, Eliantte 
 Drippin', my whole team wet
