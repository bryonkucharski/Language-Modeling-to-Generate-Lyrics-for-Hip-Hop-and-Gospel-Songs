 Take a sip revive, take a trip to the down south 
 I be flying high, can't you tell from my red eyes? 
 Took a trip from Pari down to Houston for your apple pie 
 Where the girls get way too drunk and they got that in they trunk 
 Now turn around and show the world 
 How you shake that rumpty rump 
 Say it, we don't fuck with cops, oh no, we don't fuck with cops 
 In my backseat, I got four freaks who love how my speakers knock 
 Don't bring no sand to the beach, all we want is love and peace 
 Find a girl to bring home, 'cause we about to take a flight to go be on, yeah 
 (It's true) 
 It seems like flying's all I do 
 (All I do) 
 There's no one's seated next to you 
 (Next to you) 
 In the meantime, I'll watch colors change in the sky 
 And I'll watch you go by (Get down) 
 I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
