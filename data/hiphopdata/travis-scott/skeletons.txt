 (Yeah, yeah) 
 Louder (louder) 
 Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (uh, yeah, higher)

 We just rocked Coachella, I gave her of half of the check 
 It was good sex, honorable mention to the net 
 Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect

 If she take her titties out do you expect checks? 
 First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace 
 Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
