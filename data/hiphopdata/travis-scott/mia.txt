 M-i-a-mi-m-i-m-i-a-mi 
 Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin' 
 Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley 
 Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari 
 Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari 
 Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope 
 Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega 
 Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know 
 Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam 
 Whippin' trans am, keep it low 
 She pulled out the hard white on the highway 
 For the line, listen, pimpin' 
 Your bitches might physic my disick, disick all business 
 Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele 
 Left jelly all over her biscuit 
 Last spring I lost 10K in teeth 
 I copped it but now I don't miss it 
 Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin' 
 In fact that nigga prolly missin' 
 These choppers and these planes 
 They all doin' the same, they take me overseas 
 M-I-A-I-M-I-A 
 M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A

 Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki 
 In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi 
 Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic 
 'Cause you might feel drowsy 
 Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women 
 And we all playin' hockey 
 Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane 
 Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass 
 Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam 'cause niggas be hoes 
 You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow 
 Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ 
 When I stock it up and then rack it up and then go 
 Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs 
 My nigga Yeezy done taught me that 
 Young niggas in the Soho house 
 Spillin' booze where the Barbie at 
 Damn homie, this a movie nigga 
 Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at? 
 If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women 
 He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin' 
 These choppers and these planes 
 They all doin' the same, they take me overseas 
 M-I-A-I-M-I-A
