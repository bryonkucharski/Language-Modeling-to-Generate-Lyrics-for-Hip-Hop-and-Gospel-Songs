2AM howlin' outside 
 Lookin' but I cannot find 
 Don't you fall asleep this time 
 I been on a long way drive 
 Only you can stand my mind 
 Only you can fix inside 
 So if I make it out tonight 
 Let's make it a badass time 
 Okay, I got it, copy 
 20/20, but I can't see nobody 
 One eye open, Illuminati 
 This might be the verse that make 'em drop me 
 Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies 
 No, that wasn't my girl, that was just a hobby 
 Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby 
 Elevator up, no need to find me 
 Yeah, yeah 
 X-ray vision, see through you niggas 
 Newspaper stand, we press the issue 
 We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles 
 Right up at your hood up north 
 Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental 
 Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals 
 Cookin' on a tune, I been cheffin' up instrumentals 
 Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the 
 When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat 
 Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet 
 Gotta watch my back now, 'cause these niggas at me 
 All black in a Benz when I pull up on you 
 They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends 
 Let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends 
 My choppa check-a-hoe like Indian 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Eh, to them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter 
 I guess it's all survival but please be careful 
 I gave up on the Bible long time ago 
 I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know 
 I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids 
 And dumped them in the creek up from where I live 
 Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around 
 We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around 
 Killer would show up with boxes of pizza 
 And said he had a label recruitin' people 
 Put that on my grandma and everythin' 
 My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne 
 It could've been me or could've been you too 
 What a memory in me, needing to lose 
 What's gon' patch up my inner tube 
 So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too 
 Oh yeah, La Flame with the nappy fro now 
 In the ends, I'mma kick your door down 
 Oh yeah, we keep wildin' out the Mo' now 
 Oh yeah, keep that 300 zero when I pull up on ya
