She say your bad ass always had a thing for sweets 
 Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street 
 Won't you and your friends come eat with me 
 And let me show you how to whip that recipe 
 She say your bad ass always had a thing for sweets 
 Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street 
 Won't you come over and eat with me 
 And let me show you how to whip-whip-whip that recipe 
 I don't want your apple pie, mama 
 I ain't tryna dap up niggas blockin' me 
 Made it out the spot, straight to quintana 
 And I'm still that nigga with diamonds on my blocka 
 I say when they come at me I bet they have some backup 
 I bet I take your bitch, she take that dick straight up the stasher 
 Keep an ounce of garlic just to keep away the Draculas 
 I just seek out to find my home, why can't they just leave me 'lone 
 'Cause I don't want your apple pie, no no mama 
 I don't want your apple pie, no 
 I don't want your apple pie, mami 
 I don't want your apple pie no more 
 I need my own pepper pepper, please, pepper, pepper seeds 
 I need my own reme-remedy, my own legacy 
 Yeah I don't want your apple pie, mama 
 I need my own pepper please 
 I need my own legacy, my own recipe 
 I came to get it nominated 
 From a spot that y'all seen Bun B blow up 
 I hate to break your heart, I bet I'll make the mark 
 That y'all see a legacy go up 
 Goyard done break your pockets 
 Boy I'm out in Paris lettin' all these beats go up 
 I make in one appearance what these niggas hatin' makin' in four seasons 
 H-Town, know we gon' stunt 
 I'm for real and your Rollie tick 
 Look bitch, this the Rodeo 
 But I ain't goin' out for your bullshit 
 I don't want your apple pie, mama 
 I don't wanna dap up niggas blockin' me 
 I am everything except a rapper 
 Shit I got at least 25 lighters on my dresser 
 Rocks in the night 
 Rocks in the night 
 Rocks in the night 
 Rocks in the night 
 Rocks in the night 
 Rocks in the night 
 Que sera sera, so the story goes 
 On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute 
 Tours and shows and groupie whores 
 Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot 
 Though he'd rather not 
 Forever been the elephant in the room 
 That everyone can't wait to run and tell about 
 The head to the body of the belligerent militant group 
 That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised 
 Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised 
 Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind 
 Will he make it? Was it worth it? 
 Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?
