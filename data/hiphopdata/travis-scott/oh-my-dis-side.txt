 Pouring syrup, everyday 
 Cuzo hanging at my aunty house (bando!) selling ye 
 I got shooters dressed in camo

 Mama kicked me out the house now, oh my

 About to get some cash now (cash!), oh my

 Wow 
 Let me tell you a little story about this side 
 You really can't make it on this side 
 Lot of lone stars on this side 
 I feel a lot home on this side 
 Ball until we fall on this side 
 Lit late night on this side 
 You never come around past midnight 
 You miss everything on this side 
 This side, this side 
 This side, this side, this side, this side 
 This side, this side 
 This side, this side, this side 
 I made a lot of money on this side 
 Lost a lot of money on this side 
 Had my first kiss on this side 
 Learned a lot of shit about this side 
 Clearly I've been thinking about this side 
 Tryna get back on this side 
 Tryna get back what's been mine 
 I gotta get back on this side 
 Really miss the feeling of the late nights 
 Shit we used to do around midnight 
 Hangin' on the corner had shit tight 
 Doin' all the drugs had to get right 
 If I could get my partner back it would be nice 
 He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice 
 He was too involved with the street life 
 Only way to live on this side 
 This side, this side, this side 
 This side, this side, this side, this side 
 This side, this side 
 This side, this side, this side 
 Young rich nigga from the north side 
 Paid my dues on this side 
 Flipping up bricks on this side 
 I made it out the hood I'm on the other side 
 All my niggas on this side 
 Keep it one hundred on this side 
 Love to get money on this side 
 No new niggas on this side 
 Look at my diamonds don't get blind 
 You better handcuff you ho with a zip tie (cuff!) 
 I will take a busta down on this side 
 Broke niggas stand to the left side 
 Handsome and Wealthy on this side 
 I came from the bottom and now I'm on top that's phenomenal 
 This side, this side, this side, this side 
 If I do not make it I wonder where I will go 
 This side, this side, this side 
 Graduated from the midget 
 This the life I was living 
 Graduated to a million 
 It's the money that I'm getting 
 Graduated from a hotbox now I ride around in a Bentley 
 How we do it on 
 This side, this side, this side 
 Always, always this side 
 This side, this side, this side 
 That's right, that's right 
 You ever come around that's midnight 
 Midnight, midnight 
 You know how I like my lean, po' up 
 Just right 
 On this side 
 Find everything you need, everything you need on this side 
 This side, this side, this side 
 Is right
