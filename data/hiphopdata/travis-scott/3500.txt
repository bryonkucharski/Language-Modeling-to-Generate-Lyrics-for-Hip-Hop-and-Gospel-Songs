Bandana wrapped, wrapped 'round your head 
 The bandana wrapped 'round your head 
 Fuck niggas, they're shit 
 Ain't nobody triller than me 
 Ain't nobody triller than Scott 
 Ain't nobody trill man, I'm takin' their spot 
 30s in the city movin' slow 
 $3,500 for the coat 
 Only real niggas keep you float 
 Only trill niggas I know 
 Only trill niggas I know 
 Only trill niggas I know 
 Only trill niggas I know 
 Only trill niggas I know 
 Ladies order up the champagne, a whole lot of it 
 Painkillers, they got back pain, know you gotta love it 
 Tens out in N-Y, they in my hallways, I gotta lobby of 'em 
 Up and down with Chase, Monday nights, we made a hobby of it 
 Still down with the same dogs, man they never loved us 
 Gave my niggas all gold chains to remind me of it 
 We're still holding that old thing, tryna rob me of it 
 One time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it 
 I'm papi though, they get it poppin' with me when I'm out in public 
 Flyin' through, I got a young 'Yonce with an Iggy on her 
 Me and Metro do the same drugs, got a lot of it 
 All these cups and damn, all these hoes, these niggas up to somethin' 
 Touch down out in H-Town, there it might get ugly 
 Its trill niggas wit trill niggas, a whole army of 'em 
 I run the check up, I'm a hot nigga, don't tell my 'countant on me 
 Free Rowdy Rowdy, free Bobby Bobby, them the Shmurda homies 
 Good lord!

 Dro with me, drank with me, lean like I'm Clark 
 Copping a Wraith then I throw it in park 
 You niggas from Mars, you ain't got no heart 
 I know lil one gon come with that A and that R 
 (Only trill niggas I know) 
 I know lil one gon come with that A and that R 
 I'm counting I'm dripping I'm fiending 
 I'm not from this planet, I was abandoned 
 Trill niggas real niggas popping them pill niggas 
 I stack up a mil nigga like it's a lil nigga 
 This for the one who's gon' load up the k for me 
 This for the ones that ran off and didn't wait on me 
 This for the ones that ran off and didn't wait on me 
 This for you bitch you ran off and did weight for me 
 (Only trill niggas I know) 
 Hood nigga fuck all that red carpet shit 
 Hood nigga I fuck a red carpet bitch 
 I put a Rolls and a Royce on my wrist 
 You can smell promethazine when I piss 
 I pray to God he bring me Actavis 
 Ain't nobody triller than Metro ain't nobody triller than Scooter 
 Hop on the private I do it, take all the mollies I do it 
 The Bentley put up with no mileage I do it 
 These Styrofoams with me legitimate 
 I'm proudly down these Percocets 
 We just want to be stoners lately, I've been on on on 
 This money an option, this weed is an option, this lean is an option 
 Your bitch is an option, her bitch is an option 
 I send them through auctions 
 You paying that price for that punanay 
 This gold on my neck is a new Grammy

 My bathtub the size of a swimming pool 
 Backstroke to my children room 
 Maybach in the living room 
 I spent racks on these tennis shoes 
 Niggas know what I'm finna do 
 Time for me to put the mink up 
 Forgiattos on a Brinks truck 
 My favorite rapper drove a pink truck 
 I do shit that you dream of 
 I was born with a mean mug 
 I was born with sum' nappy hair, drinkin' breast milk out a lean cup 
 Tity Boi's my alias 
 Real niggas my radius 
 Trill niggas on the song with me 
 (Only trill niggas I know) 
 If she bad as hell I'll pay the babysitter 
 In a black Mercedes with her 
 Doin' about 180 with her 
 I was born a hustler paraphernalia in my baby pictures 
 Resident all eloquent, leather shit in my front yard 
 TV by my swimming pool, got the bitch like a sports bar 
 Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car 
 Ya my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras 
 Crib bigger than your imagination 
 Call the trap house the gas station 
 Call momma's house the Jag station 
 Emoji sad faces 
 Look at these niggas 
 I need to buy pocketbooks for these niggas

 We ride on a yacht 
 Ain't nobody triller than Metro, ain't nobody triller than Scooter 
 Ain't nobody triller, I knew it, ain't nobody triller, we knew it 
 Pour up an Ace out on niggas, don't play 'round like Janice and Judy 
 (Only reall niggas keep it float) 
 Say fuck all the rumors say fuck all the rumors
