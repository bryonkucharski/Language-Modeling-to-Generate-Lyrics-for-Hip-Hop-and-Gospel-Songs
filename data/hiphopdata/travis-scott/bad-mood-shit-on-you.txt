(I just have one question) 
 Fuck outta my business 
 I did things that most men will ask forgiveness 
 Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants 
 Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin' 
 We ride with no limits 
 Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish? 
 I'm in a bad mood 
 Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house 
 We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror 
 A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better 
 We niggas new slaves, I do say (Fuck, fuck) 
 Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood 
 Ooh, your skin mahogany 
 Ooh, let's break the monotony 
 Government threw us in a maze 
 Had me trickin' 40K for some grades 
 Just to make 40K for the wage 
 Dropped out and made that in one day 
 I'm in a bad mood 
 Ooh nigga I'm wildin' on 'em, back pilin' on 'em 
 I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain 
 So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah 
 Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal 
 Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho 
 They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty 
 Anxiety, after the meds, Kris Bobbi 
 Skinny black bastard ridin' a Casper 
 I tend to lose my thoughts when I walk 
 They say I'm a slave so tell me the master 
 Now his head on the pendant by the cross 
 Coke'd it then I fucked her for the theory 
 You know I'm crazy, I'm straight, no weary 
 I hate when conversates can't relate 
 You know it be fucking up my groove when I'm in a bad mood 
 I can't wait... I can't wait... just to shit on you... 
 This one for the fuck fake niggas 
 That love to just hate, dog 
 Always talkin' that wild shit 
 See 'em never let them verbs off 
 All these fuckin' missed calls 
 Might delete the whole call log 
 Thousand dollars for the jeans, fam 
 She grip 'em when a nigga swerve off 
 Think I need a desert eagle, niggas in my face 
 Thinking they know Jacques, niggas don't know me 
 Grew up on my lonestar, niggas roll that weed 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 Just to shit on you 
 I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 (But why, Travis?) 
 Yeah 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you 
 Just to shit on you 
 I can't wait, just to shit on you
