I'm riding up uptown 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick 
 I'm a motherfucking monster 
 You riding up uptown 
 One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick 
 At the green light I'm speeding 
 Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving 
 I got red eyes and swag seizures 
 All my concerts filling them bleachers 
 Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us 
 Tossed in a little more dank 
 And a little more drank than La Flame might need 
 Tito Puente with the candy top 
 Fuck around, make the Latinas pop 
 It's a new world order 
 Never had my head on my shoulders 
 Beware of the monsters 
 Ain't that what your preacher told ya? 
 La Flame, 500 degrees 
 From the uptown to the Magnolia 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 I'm riding up uptown 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 One hand on the wheel, eh 
 Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know 
 Dice on the corner with the lights low 
 Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0 
 Damn you conscious 
 Gon' get your head off the plate though 
 Let me show you lil Yamamoto 
 Take a little lick of the mayo 
 Out on 135th, spending them pesos 
 Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked 
 'Cause we got a little bit of Tango 
 Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga 
 Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait 
 Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face 
 I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell 
 XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill 
 Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga 
 My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga 
 She can ride the dick no hands 
 While I'm riding uptown 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 It's that young Fergenstein (Little Frankenstein!) 
 Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line 
 Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine 
 Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine 
 I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay 
 Martin 'Giela so cold feel like Tommy gettin' his payday 
 Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy 
 My fraternity is the burna heat, I'm a Kappa nigga with an AK-ay 
 Barking loud like Q-Dogs, moving niggas like U-Hauls 
 Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls 
 I'm riding up uptown 
 I'm a mothafuckin' monster 
 I'm riding up uptown
