 You already know who it is 
 Ya' boy, Big Tuck 
 Freight Train Tuck 
 Astroworld is now in session, ya understand? 
 I'm the dean of this herr 
 I got this 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Parked at the Days Inn, ain't takin' no days in (yeah) 
 Don't need no vacation, I need a replacement (alright) 
 Bustin' the lights out as soon as we came in (it's lit) 
 What're they talkin' about, what's it pertainin' (yeah, yeah) 
 Need me a therapist to ask if I'm aging 
 This M-E-D it feel caved in 
 All of my demons invadin' 
 I live paranoid, hesitatin' 
 They bitin', they bitin', they K'd in 
 Got out their way, it's okay 
 'Cause like they dosing the basement 
 I got to get with my face in 
 Brand new, brand new 
 This new place I got to 
 New world, new sky 
 That's so blue, it's black too 
 New growth, new growth 
 All these fakes I outgrew 
 Blue bands, blue bands 
 Get my cash from drive-through 
 Boy you're too flash, too flash 
 Keep the flash minimal 
 Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold 
 See my breath visible 
 Yeah 
 Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold (yeah) 
 Mixing the water with cheeses, making the money get mould (yeah) 
 Trying to be like gang, you better go get it in vogue (yeah) 
 Put 84's on lanes, I robbed, how you think of the spokes 
 We did it, we said it, we spoke 
 We put it out, thought it was small, these five or four 
 This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo 
 Open his eyes, don't need to move in slow 
 Even though the speed got old 
 This perc and methamphetamines 
 On the D's, like the snow 
 But they soap 
 Vamanos, speed, see step swings on the rope 
 Come to reach, and it's broke 
 Got springs like a tote 
 Show for free, in the tuck 
 Shock you, drown like, brown, white diamonds 
 Class (yah) 
 Copy sound, might got two wings, Patek (alright!) 
 Landing down, went and caught two wings (it's lit!) 
 Tryna scrape, but the stage, two wings 
 Better pray, better pray in two wings (straight up!) 
 Brand new, brand new 
 This new place I got to 
 New world, new sky 
 That's so blue, it's black too 
 New growth, new growth 
 All these fakes I outgrew 
 Blue bands, blue bands 
 Get my cash from drive-through 
 Boy you're too flash, too flash 
 Keep the flash minimal 
 Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold 
 See my breath visible
