Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah) 
 Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit) 
 Whenever I'm down, it got me goin' crazy (yeah) 
 Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright) 
 I was always high up on the lean (yeah, yeah) 
 Then this girl came here to save my life 
 Look up to the sky, down on my knees (straight up) 
 Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night 
 In the night-time (whoa, yeah) 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (roll) 
 Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (oh no) 
 Niggas femalin', they excelling (yeah)

 Got me goin' crazy (it's lit) 
 On tour, we'll tell 'em, we bought the section (gang) 
 They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic like we projected 
 So we cut the plug, he's interjected (got me goin' crazy) 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah) 
 Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit) 
 Whatever I'm downin' got me goin' crazy (yeah) 
 Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright) 
 I was always high up on the lean (yeah, yeah) 
 Then this girl came here to save my life 
 Girl, look to the sky, down on my knees (straight up) 
 Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night 
 In the night-time (whoa, yeah) 
 Got me goin' crazy 
 Sound of a rollercoaster 
 Ok, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay 
 Just to drown out all these thoughts, I try all kind of things 
 If I take you to my past you will be traumatized 
 Got a thousand kids outside, it's tryna come alive 
 '99, take AstroWorld, it had to relocate 
 Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith 
 Before no car, she played the tourist guide 
 Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides 
 Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies 
 When you make it to the top, it's the amenities 
 Packin' out Toyota like I'm in a lead 
 And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries 
 I got 'em stage divin' off the nose bleeds 
 And she hit that booger, sugar till her nose bleed 
 Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees 
 She was talkin' 'bout forever got a whole week 
 But she know my baby mama is a trophy 
 She be throwing up them B's feel like we both bleed 
 She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby 
 I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe 
 Yeah, this right here is astronomical 
 I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible 
 They tryna say that all my problems is improbable 
 They keep itching at my spit, I'm diabolical 
 Ya feel me?
