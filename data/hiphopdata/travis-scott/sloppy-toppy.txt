Darling, when the moon is bright 
 I want you to be holding me tight 
 Migo! 
 She see me pull up in that 'Rari 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout choppin' the toppy 
 Got bitches on bitches, they run 'round the lobby 
 They know that I got it 
 I got too much money signs, sorry can't fit in my wallet 
 Sloppy toppy, you can't touch my wallet 
 Sloppy toppy know the bitches got it 
 Know that she got it, know that she got it (What she got huh?) 
 Sloppy toppy, sloppy toppy, uh 
 Know that she got it, know that she got it 
 Sloppy toppy, bet the bitch has got it 
 Sloppy toppy, bet that bitch has got it 
 Migos they know that I got it 
 Know that my wristwatch is sloppy 
 Now they want a double dutch in my pockets 
 Tell me one thing, is she 'bout it? Girl is you 'bout it? 
 Gotta know before we let you tip toe and run through the lobby (fuck is you sayin'?) 
 But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby 
 So she got me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy Goddess 
 Over the garden, over the garden, oh what a goddess 
 On my province, we don't do massages, just "ménages" 
 She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it 
 She don't tap out, no tap out, she rather just black out 
 Then we take trips to her trap house 
 We been pullin' them stacks out 
 Call over your friends, bend over, they poppin' for bands 
 Can't stop if I can, no I do not do beer cans, fuck is this a frat house? 
 I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it 
 I know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Quavo! 
 I pull up and pick her up, get her bruh 
 I know that she bad 
 And I know that the head is so good when she got around 
 I know that we call her the sloppy toppy 
 My pockets so sloppy 
 I pull out the whopper, the chopper 
 Just know that's who shot ya 
 Me, pull up in that 'Rari I don't have a key 
 She hop in the whip, disappear like a genie 
 She got the sloppy toppy, bitches want my broccoli 
 She after my money, Monopoly 
 Them twitter bitches wanna follow me 
 I make 'em swallow me then kick 'em off of my property 
 Paparazzi keep on stalkin' me 
 Feel like the Federali's keep on watchin' me 
 Worth 100 mil, niggas can't talk to me 
 Get sloppy toppy, but you givin' currency 
 I make your bitch work for me, she at the Doubletree 
 Chopping strong, OG gas bags of that Hercules 
 I'm whipping the top off the Audi, do surgery 
 Red on the bottom, my shoes it's a murder scene 
 I don't want your bitch she a natnat 
 Pull up in the Audi, it's a hatchback 
 Kickin', pimpin' and I'm luxury livin' 
 Makin' it disappear, I'm a magician 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Sloppy in the wrist and all my pockets 
 Come here lil bitch, I want sloppy toppy 
 Butt naked, fuckin' in Balenciaga 
 Her pussy wet, I call it Fiji water 
 I know she got it, I'ma beat it for her 
 Then I dismiss the bitch and ignore her 
 They know I got it, I'm at the top floor 
 Blue Benjamins on me, no dubs 
 Duffel bag filled up like I'm Money Mayweather 
 Boogers in my Rollie, Pikachu yellow 
 Pick a shoe, Balenci, Maison Margiela 
 Pick a big bezel, which bezel is better? 
 My jeweler know I got big cheddar 
 Double Lambo, double parking wherever 
 Double R ghost jump out with an umbrella 
 Come with me, we take off like space shuttles 
 Longway, Longway 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Offset! 
 Sloppy toppy in the Maserati 
 She gone get on top me, ride me like a Harley 
 I don't fuck with the molly, look at her body 
 She a hottie like a bag of Takis 
 Beat the pussy like I'm Pacquiao 
 Squeeze the nipples like you milk a cow 
 Pull up in the car that she can't pronounce 
 Dick in her mouth, you'd think she got a root canal 
 30 thousand for her Birkin 
 Fat booty, shawty perfect 
 She gag on the dick and she burpin' 
 She swallow my kids like a slurpee 
 Good brains, she nerdy 
 I'm wonderin' what is her purpose 
 When I get around her I get nervous 
 Little momma, she clean like detergent 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it 
 Know that the bad bitch got it 
 Know that she got it 
 I know that she got it, I know that she got it
