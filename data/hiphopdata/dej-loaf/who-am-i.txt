Who am I? 
 Sometimes I sit and I just wonder will I ever fumble? 
 Can't think like that, I got to keep this shit forever going 
 When it rain niggas get wet in the D, it's snowing 
 We got them fully automatics and them minks up on us 
 No tender loving care, nah we gon' creep up on 'em 
 Sick them demons on 'em, pray for me can't even function 
 Drum under the pillow, sleep in Gucci thermals 
 I can't get no sleep at night, I sit and think all night 
 I just need a peace of mind, I live a decent life 
 Who said this shit was easy, why they fucking lying? 
 Let me have you baby, promise I'm gon' treat you right 
 I be like show you right, yeah show you right 
 I can tell you're not ready for me, tell me what your last bitch like 
 I can see she had you stealing your shit, how long was y'all together? 
 Nevermind I'm single, rather be filthy rich and hardheaded 
 Low down, dirty shame Peaches pretty bitch ball headed 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who are you? Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Shooters sliding down your block in them suit and ties 
 Do you want to ride? No do or die 
 They tryna take your soul, nigga run and hide 
 I just be thinking the worst, surprise it's your birthday 
 When the last time you done been down to that church aye? 
 Say it ain't what you think, say how you feel, say what you think nigga 
 These niggas biting their tongues, biting my style, follow the leader 
 Follow me (come on) 
 Follow me, follow me 
 Follow me, follow me 
 Follow me, follow me 
 Ralph Lauren, I'm fleek look at me 
 Bullet proof feelings take a shot at me 
 We taking shots of Hennessy done had like 6 a piece 
 That's that Detroit in me so many memories 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who are you? Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I?
