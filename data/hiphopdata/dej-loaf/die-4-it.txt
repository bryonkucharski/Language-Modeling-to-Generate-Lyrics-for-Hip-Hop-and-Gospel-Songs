I be done killed me a nigga trying to take something away that I worked hard for 
 This is what I grind for 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 N-n-n-n-no, how can I sell my soul? 
 The devil be near, but I'm far too strong 
 I know my right from wrong, I know what's going on 
 Them niggas they want us to fail 
 But we cannot, we just gotta prevail 
 We got it 
 Bad bitch karma, in a red dress 
 I'm really from Detroit, what the fuck you expect? 
 Keep what you stole, reap what you sow 
 Word on the street niggas got sent home 
 Don't dial my phone, I'm booked 
 Free lil bro, he booked 
 Fake ass niggas been faking too long 
 We see ho niggas, they shook 
 Watch 'bout 50, bitch look 
 That's 'cause right there, he a crook 
 We ain't tryna act tough, we just tryna get paid 
 See with y'all, see it's all about the look 
 We can go song for song, whatever you want 
 Dome for dome 
 Knock knock, pop up at your home 
 Don't touch the kids or the wife, just get that chum 
 But if the bitch get smart, hell, give her the pump 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Don't let this life fool you 
 Don't let this shit get you 
 Don't let this life fool you 
 Don't let this shit get you 
 You can tell that she got a lot of pain in her 
 Tryna hide it but she on her third hangover 
 This week, ain't shit sweet, game over 
 See she ain't really want the fame, it just came with it 
 We ain't have AC, had fans in the window 
 Now I ride through your city, wave at fans out the window 
 From the city where the chopper gave you ten in window 
 In the summertime hit, and your man's ain't with you like damn 
 Like damn, where my nigga go? 
 Too many funerals over these hoes 
 Can't fall victim, had to get up and go 
 Change had to come or somebody had to go 
 They'll do any little thing for that paper 
 I done seen it, I done chased it 
 I done got it, and I'll be damned if they take it 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 Are you willing to die for it? 
 To die for it 
 To die for it 
 To die for it 
 To die for it
