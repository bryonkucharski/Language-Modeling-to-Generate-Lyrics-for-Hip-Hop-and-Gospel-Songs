Let a nigga try me, try me 
 I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family 
 And I ain't playin' with nobody 
 Fuck around and I'm a catch a body 
 Let a nigga try me, try me 
 I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family 
 And I ain't playin' with nobody 
 Fuck around and I'm a catch a body 
 Bitch I got the mac or the 40 
 Turn a bitch to some macaroni 
 Tell me how you want it I'm on it 
 I really mean it I'm just not recordin' 
 Still a blow the choppa, for all you oppa's 
 Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta 
 You are an impostor, ain't got no money 
 Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly 
 I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi 
 Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet 
 Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly 
 Pop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it 
 Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me 
 48214 real niggas know me 
 I been out my mind since they killed my cousin 
 Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me 
 All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me 
 Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin' 
 IBGM the clique bitch you see us scorin' 
 V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin' 
 Got a bitch that Set it Off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah 
 You rollin' around with yo nieces bitch TeeTee 
 Mind full money, got a heart full of demons 
 Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas 
 Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne 
 Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck with my family 
 They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin' 
 Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty 
 Let a nigga try me, try me 
 I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family 
 And I ain't playin' with nobody 
 Fuck around and I'm a catch a body 
 Let a nigga try me, try me 
 I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family 
 And I ain't playin' with nobody 
 Fuck around and I'm a catch a body 
 Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger 
 Lil Dej ain't 'bout it, bitch how you figure 
 I don't do no drugs, I be off liquor 
 So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture 
 See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin' 
 Niggas gossip like hoes, most of 'em bitches 
 I don't wanna do no songs, I don't wanna kick it 
 And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent 
 Let a nigga try me, try me 
 I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family 
 And I ain't playin' with nobody 
 Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
