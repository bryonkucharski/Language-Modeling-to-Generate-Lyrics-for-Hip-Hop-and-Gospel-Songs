Lately I been on my rap shit 
 Had to stop singing for a while I'm back bitch 
 Taking niggas easter baskets, talking cash shit 
 Taking niggas hoes too, I know you heard bout last year 
 Come back here this Ralph, feel it cashmere 
 Let me whisper something in your left ear 
 Shit got you harder than a brick yeah 
 Watch cost brick fare huh 
 Your watch don't tick tock huh 
 You ain't bought your kids a kids meal huh 
 Fuck outta here, you must think I'm dumb 
 You be perping on the net, you know you dead wrong 
 You know perping like you sipping purple popping pills 
 Perky, perky wakey, wakey it is 7:30 in the fucking morning 
 I was into Smacks nigga, I was not a Lucky Charmer 
 Yeah nigga, run this back don't forget the fucking charm 
 How much for a verse nigga? Your head and a fucking arm 
 Ducks don't quack, ok leave his head in the pond 
 Niggas can't make bail, go to jail they tell 
 End up locked all them years for what 
 All them fake ass friends and they fake ass words 
 Fake ass furs you are hanging on coat tails 
 Life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 They say life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 They say life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 And they life say is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 Lately I been on my fresh shit, and it ain't 'bout the designer it's about who wearing the shit 
 Making music wonder if these people feeling my shit 
 Like are you hearing this shit 
 Blood sweat tears in this shit 
 I get pregnant shit it's life I ain't killing my kids 
 That was random I'm just sharing things I disagree with 
 We all human, we all got secrets 
 Where you get that fit from I can't tell you it's illegal 
 Flyer than a bitch, feeling like an eagle 
 Too much grease see you're more like a seagull 
 Lot of rappers see through, I don't care 'bout no features 
 'Cause I make my own music that's really why I started singing 
 I figured I could do my own hooks, write my own rhymes in my notebook 
 See I know I got the image down pat, Ima drop my own shoe and have Finishline packed 
 I always been the one they ask you think you all that 
 If I don't think I'm all that, who the fuck gon think it 
 Gun to your head yeah what's the procedure 
 We gon catch that nigga, we gon wide receive'em 
 You can hide from bullets, you can't hide from Jesus 
 And the older I get the more I see myself preaching 
 What the fuck were thinking? Bitch is you thinking 
 She focused, no blinking 
 She got a vision 
 Life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 They say Life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 They say Life is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 And they Life say is but a dream, I gotta chase mine 
 Lately I been on my rap shit 
 Had to stop singing for a while I'm back bitch
