 I still taste you on my lips, yeah I do 
 Last night we made love till the Sun came 
 I know it's hard when I leave, I'm not with you 
 But when I'm gone, hold it down, you're my love thing 
 You be doin' it, that one and two, that four thing 
 Let's slow it down a bit, I'll hit you with that foreplay 
 Hop on top, I start to ride you, that's that horseplay 
 Strip for my baby, bitch we ballin', that's that sports play 
 I love you, I love you 
 Whaoo

 You a monster, baby, baby I want you 
 I'm starin' you in the eyes and tellin' you that I want it 
 No shame in my game, I'm a fein, I'm a junkie 
 You need a line of my love, put this pussy all on you 
 I got you bumpin' and grindin', got me screamin' and moanin'

 Soon as you wake, baby, ride on me, just for breakfast 
 Paparazzi wastin' time if they're tryna catch us

 And say fuck the earth, it's us against everybody 
 You on a team now, baby, yeah Pat Riley 
 You with a king now, it's only right you shine like a queen 
 And I still taste you on my lips, oh yeah I do 
 When we make love we on the top of the moon 
 But that oh, oh say my name now 
 Put my nose in that pussy, give you head now 
 She know I get that mula, man trappin' is a habit 
 We ballin' every night, baby, whoa Kemosabe 
 It Ain't no shame in my game, I'm a fiend, I'm a addict 
 Whoever knockin' at the door, I told 'em I got to have it, what's poppin' 
 Hey there, hey there (yeah, yeah baby)
