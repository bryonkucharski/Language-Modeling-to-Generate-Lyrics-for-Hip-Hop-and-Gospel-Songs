I've been on my hustle 
 It ain't too many people I look up to 
 I've been grinding, I've been grinding 
 I've been grinding, I've been grinding 
 I've been grinding 
 Look, I've been on my grind all week 
 I ain't been getting no sleep 
 But that shit don't matter to me 
 My momma said "it should matter to me" 
 She said "your health is everything" 
 Momma I've been road running 
 I just signed a few deals and the shows coming 
 I can't let my fans down, I gotta run it up 
 I can't let a bitch catch me, fuck a runner up 
 I said "lets turn the summer up" 
 All these other girls quiet, word to my mother 
 Man I put that on the bible 
 All this gossip people talking, man they got me fucked up 
 They want to see me down, broke bad on my luck 
 I don't trust nobody rather do it on my own 
 Get them squares out your circle, leave them pussy boys alone 
 Leave them pussy boys alone 
 Niggas with hidden agendas, I hope you offended 
 Cut the middle man out, I need all of my interest 
 'Cause niggas don't have passion, they just in it to fit in 
 I'm really in this shit to finish, niggas goofy they grinning too much 
 Get the fuck out my business 
 A lot of these niggas, they was raised like hoes 
 You ain't gotta be a killer to get my respect, pussy nigga 
 Ay just play yo role, you boys shaped like hoes 
 Y'all hate like hoes, we move different ain't like those 
 We ain't gon' fall, we ain't gon' fall 
 We ain't gon' fail, we ain't gon snitch 
 We ain't gon tell, nigga 
 (Why would we do that, huh? You gotta ask yourself) 
 Look, I done been broke before I ain't going back (naw) 
 Lil bro just came home he said "he ain't going back" 
 So I gotta protect him, I feel like I've been neglected 
 Ready for change but don't wanna work at no register 
 So, just imagine all that pressure on me 
 Man, this shit is chess not checkers homie 
 Can't get to you, we'll probably get your homie 
 Don't get stuck in living in the moment 
 I was raised by real niggas no Jabronie's 
 Said I was raised by real niggas no Jabronie's 
 I'm a living legend nigga Kony Kony 
 Ridin' with the woo, got my Kony Tony 
 Tony, Toni Braxton, or Anita Baker 
 Left wrist skating, diamonds dancing like Jamaica 
 I keep a couple niggas, but ain't got a lot of patience 
 If I want it, I'mma take it, ain't trynna sound like no rapist 
 I be in the D, bake potatoes all like papers 
 I know why niggas mad 'cause I never need they favors 
 And I still rock with bucks, I ain't never had a trainer 
 Miami beach trippin' got the doors off the wranglers 
 Times get hard, old friends call you stranger 
 But I ain't even change, I just bought something I made it 
 You should be happy, you should want to do the same shit 
 A boss is way more then just given out a paycheck 
 No music, couple old friends turnin' the bases 
 I'm getting closer to God, I'm getting back to the basics 
 I've been had the vision since That's So Raven 
 And I never needed to said things, I knew I was greater 
 If I stayed the same, they would've love it 
 Performing in my room to performing out in public 
 It's 2K15, niggas score getting bucket 
 Let them pussies have it, make it feel it in they stomach, nigga 
 (We gon' make them feel it every single time, every time. I mean why not?) 
 (It feel like, I've been waiting my whole fucking life for this.) 
 I've been on my grind all week (I ain't going back) 
 I ain't been getting no sleep 
 But that shit don't matter to me 
 (We tryna fuckin' win man)
