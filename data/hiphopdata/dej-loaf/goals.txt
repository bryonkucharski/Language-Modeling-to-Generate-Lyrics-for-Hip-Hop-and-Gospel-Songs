Stop making me promises that you ain't gon' keep 
 I tried to tell you once before, don't mean shit to me 
 If you don't know me by now I don't know when we gon' meet 
 Got a meeting at 3, studio is at 6 
 You know exactly where I'm gon' be 
 I'm busy, I'm busy, can't answer my phone, everybody keep calling me 
 Last week you was hectic, this week I ain't stressin' 
 I know I'm on a winning streak 
 Don't eat at Katana's, don't eat Benihana's, I take me a salad and wings 
 You gotta value your team 
 Play by the rules, keep shit soled up 
 If I put you in charge lil nigga, you better not fold up, nigga 
 I say hold up, what's the hold up, this shit bigger than ever 
 You remind me of a old pup 
 And I been gettin' money, why you bringing up old stuff? 
 Keep it real, niggas owe us 
 They can keep it, 'cause we don't need it 
 One in a million, you can ask Alliyah 
 Got it honest, no luck or cheating 
 I don't trust these niggas, can't even trust the seasons 
 When it's snowing in June, shit fuck you meaning? 
 No time for blogs, that shit silly 
 But you believe it, I'm like oh really? 
 Stay woken, stop dreaming 
 Bitches greedy, do not feed 'em 
 Gold diggers, dirty demons 
 Yeah they want your gold 
 Bitches ain't got goals, no no 
 I'm tryna school you, baby listen 
 Power of pussy fuck politicians 
 And the side bitches making side decisions 
 That's why you ain't been getting attention 
 You don't want your ring back huh? 
 See a man gon' think with his ding dong 
 What you fighting for? Gotta ask yourself baby girl 
 See I'ma tell you what they ain't baby girl 
 Gotta find yourself and create your world 
 Baby girl, baby girl, yeah 
 Stop fucking with niggas who don't have a conscience 
 How you end up pregnant, still live with your mama? 
 Hmm? I'ma get off that shit 
 Fuck your opinion, I know I'm great 
 Gotta drop this album, shit I know they can't wait 
 Got other folks' lives in my hands now 
 No handout, 'less he has pen out 
 Depending on 20 years, let's see the residuals 
 You're an ill individual, I know you gon' give it to 'em 
 I be in here off the top, but they say I ain't lyrical 
 Don't give a fuck 'cause shit where I'm from it's a miracle 
 Yeah I started off with Try Me but I'm older and spiritual 
 Get to knowing yourself, that's some shit that put fear in you 
 Put faith in you 
 Make you love niggas, but make you hate niggas 
 I got faith in you 
 Always thought you could do it 
 My mama, my brother 
 Well not my brother, my sister 
 When we ain't have shit they couldn't do shit with us 
 Walking 'round like who want to do what with us 
 What's my preference, my preference is people 
 Stop asking me questions 'fore I take y'all bitches 
 I'm single and the boss is my favorite position 
 Huh, I ain't what the game been missing 
 Put me in coach, they can't deny this pimping 
 I ain't overselling myself, just buy my ticket 
 I'ma put on a show, I'ma handle my business 
 They all know the words, shit 'cause I inspire the children 
 I bring out the life in the children 
 I'm from the slums like them, why would I be tripping? 
 Hmm? Why would I be tripping? 
 So you can put my music on when the lights are dim 
 When the fridge is low, when you're out with him 
 I'ma make all kind of shit that be exciting them 
 Add for quotes from my songs when you're writing him 
 Yeah, tell him I said hey 
 Keep your head up baby 
 Tell him I said hey 
 Keep your head up baby 
 Time ain't gon' last forever
