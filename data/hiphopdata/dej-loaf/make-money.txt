I think I seen this on the TV show 
 Bitch you ain't heard of me before 
 Been there, done that, that's my old ho 
 I was feeling like you need to know 
 Niggas tryna sneak diss 
 F&N, pussy peep this 
 It's a flood, pussy leaking 
 Cleanup on aisle 3 shit 
 Charge it to the game, no defense 
 In the game, tryna stay away from bleachers 
 I just got to stay away from leeches 
 'Cause I got a good heart, heart decent 
 Brown skin, short hair, come and get this 
 Low down dirty shame, call me peaches 
 One after another, that's a sequence 
 I ain't really really into all that beefing 
 All these nigga rats for that cheese shit 
 Snitching, telling everything they seen shit 
 Bout that action, I might pop up on his seam quick 
 Come through and shoot shoot, leave the scene quick 
 Yo 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Baby I can't dance, I can't bust no moves 
 But my diamonds they be dancing and might bust a move 
 Let a nigga try me, we gon' bust a move 
 They hit the block, being high like (Chris Tucker) do 
 Chillin', watching crush (groove) 
 (Oba) fat boy, what's up dude? 
 We might pull up in a truck or two 
 You can't get in, we don't fuck with you 
 Lazy ass niggas don't make no moves 
 Ain't check us at the door, we got in with the tools 
 One shot boom, two shoots ooh 
 I don't know shit, I'm like who shot who? 
 Margiela's, Chanel, I'm giving 'em hell 
 This shit should be a crime 
 I bet I make bail 
 Hold up, wait, fuck 12 
 I only pop champagne just to pour it in the air, yeah 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 In my Rolls, read the newspaper 
 8 ball, left pocket on the pool table 
 Stash the money in the pool table 
 Walk in, I need ones and a booth table 
 All these hoes love money, I'm (convinced) baby 
 I love money too, I'm a boss baby 
 I been going nuts getting off lately 
 Out of your league, I need that money like the golf player 
 Me and you together, heart to heart baby 
 I'm just joking, just a thought baby 
 You ain't got no job, boy you Tommy 
 All these fake ass mobs, y'all not Italian 
 Used to hit the candy lady and get Laffy Taffys 
 Back when they was singing "Girl shake that Laffy Taffy" 
 Niggas don't come direct, niggas try be petty 
 I ain't lying, I got 100 in my fanny packy 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money 
 Make money money, make money money 
 Take money money, take money money
