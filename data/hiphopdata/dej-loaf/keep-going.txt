Money train, money bags, I get money fast 
 Money came, if the money go I wonder who gon' last 
 I hit the money dance, these my money pants 
 Got 30 Gs in these 
 40 in my bag, I don't like to walk with cash 
 I change your life, come spend the night 
 I ain't gon' ask you twice 
 I asked you once 
 You with her? Ok wrap it up 
 I'm in the cut, I'm cutting up 
 Let's go get brunch 
 He like my eyes, so he hate it when I wear my buffs 
 I'm looking good 
 Hater bitches gonna pucker up 
 Kiss my ass 
 Pressure's on, the pressure's up 
 I'm on the move, I'd be a fool to let 'em catch up 
 Fuck next up, I'm blessed up 
 I got heart, that's chest up 
 I'm a don, see 
 I got snakes all on my head, Don see 
 Niggas say they want their bread, well let's meet 
 Get it in blood, get it from 'cause 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 Washed up, mama's boy 
 Nigga pick them suds 
 Take the trash out, you a little ass boy 
 They was making jokes like, "She a little ass boy" 
 But they niggas in my DMs and I'm starting to get annoyed 
 I hate liars pussy nigga, tell the whole story 
 How much for a feature, I don't know, ask Joy 
 Niggas play victim, my niggas play with toys 
 Catch them niggas slippin', have them shook, all noid 
 Don't say that it ain't worth it, some shit that you gotta avoid 
 But my grandma she a G so it's a must I keep it going 
 Expose you to the world, niggas lamer than I thought 
 I knew I was gon' shine, I felt that in that drought 
 I knew who I was at six years old 
 Looking in the mirror like I can't die poor 
 I gotta go 
 Beams everywhere, narcs kick in our doors 
 They say death come in three 
 I'm like so do these hoes, hold up 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I can't let 'em stop me, I can't let 'em hold me back now 
 I was born a G, tell me why the fuck would I back down 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going 
 I got to keep going and going, keep going
