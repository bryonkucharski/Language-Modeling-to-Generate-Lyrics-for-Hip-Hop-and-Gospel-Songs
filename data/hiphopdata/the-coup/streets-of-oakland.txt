(Ant Banks) 
 Yeah, to the break of dawn, you know? Let's do this 
 Niggas in Oakland all day long 
 Be pimping these hoes from dusk till dawn 
 Making cash real fast and you know it's on 
 Hanging on the streets of Oakland 
 All we do is smoke that weed 
 And drink brew on the ave till we get keyed 
 And a little bit of head is all we need 
 Hanging on the streets of Oakland 
 (Ant Banks) 
 Welcome to the danger zone, where the niggas don't play that 
 Every man for self, the rule is to stay strapped 
 Cause rat packers try to jack that ass 
 From the jealousy that's built in the streets when you stack cash 
 And they'll blast, hoping they can get get it 
 Punk, so if you got it, you best to get with it 
 Or quit it, cause niggas be flipping over dope and 
 Your friends might get you if you're slipping in Oakland 
 Yeah, so don't play no punk-ass nigga close 
 'Cause they'll mash on your cash and get ghost 
 And don't say Ant Banks didn't warn ya 
 About the loced-ass gangstas killing in California 
 That's where I'm from, nigga, rolling in my G-ride 
 Hey, you gonna see me slide when I'm on the Eastside 
 Making all my fucking gitnotes 
 Making sure my gat straight smitnokes, smobbing with my fitnokes 
 That's all we doing is the town is seeing bitches clowning 
 Kicking back getting high lounging 
 It really doesn't matter what you do, yo chilling with your crew 
 You're sipping on a brew, you're pimping bitches too 
 And the shit don't bother me if that's how it's gotta be 
 Then macking these hoes should be equality 
 See, the game goes deep when you're rolling 
 Hanging on the streets of Oakland 
 Nighttime falls and everybody's perking 
 No punks around so funks occurring 
 But the sideshow's back and everybody's flossing 
 In they ride trying to side and all the freaks are tossing 
 And brother with bump, trunk of funk is knocking 
 Candy paint on they ride keeps the bitches jocking 
 Knowing you's a balling-ass nigga everybody hates 
 Rolling in the town with a pound straight dropping weight 
 Blowing up like dynamite 
 Selling weed, yey, angel dust, hop, and China white 
 Fuck it, you're making duckets, never riding buckets 
 Playing punk bitches like puppets 
 Yo, but there's a lot of fake counterfeit macks 
 Playa hating on they homies trying to dry cat 
 To look good for the hoes, man these niggas ain't joking 
 Boy, you get that ass smoked in Oakland 
 (Boots - spoken) 
 Aw yeah, The Coup is up in here, and we be talking about the 
 Real. Motherfuckas know that we know, that they know, that we 
 Know the deal. Now the originality of our principality is that 
 We don't play the pimp. But the reality of our locality, and 
 You'll learn this gradually, is that motherfuckas do this shit 
 To pay their rent. But here's a hint: how we gonna get it straight 
 When we bent? Shit, see I ain't never had shit but my stripes 
 And my game and my life, and all them's just hand downs from my 
 Grandaddy. Yeah, I'm living large kidding with Ant Banks, but I'm 
 Still hustling food stamps for my candy apple red Caddy. All right...
