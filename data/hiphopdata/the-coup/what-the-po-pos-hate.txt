What the fuck? 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court 
 I scribbled this on an application for county support 
 I practice this like a sport 
 Met Donald Trump and he froze up 
 Standing on his Bentley yelling "Pimps down, hoes up" 
 Stop tryin' to front off 
 Break your ass a clump off 
 We gon' stop the world and make y'all motherfuckers jump off 
 Watch me chunk off molotovs and bricks 
 Mr. bailiff, you can put that in your transcripts. 
 Is you a have or you a have not? 
 When you run out of bullets, grab rocks and throw ham hocks 
 'Cause the door to the pen slams locked 
 It don't open when your fam knocks 
 'Less you rich and have stocks 
 I eat my dinner out of spam box 
 They carry cash off in glad-locks 
 This is for them babies with the empty plates 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 Life in the game 
 Showin no remorse and no shame 
 Rocks share up on thangs 
 Due to the imminent cocaine 
 In my brain 
 I know it's wrong 
 But a job would take too long 
 I'm robbin niggas at gunpoint 
 Just to keep my PG&E on 
 And we own 
 Kodiacin narcotics 
 To keep from going neurotic 
 Pushin the product 
 Padna was finer than gotti 
 Got shot in my body 
 Dropped a chopper in his lap 
 This shit is a distraction 
 From all the black on black 
 A systematic attack 
 On me and my race 
 Face it, found a way out 
 This cycle before 
 I'm six feet deep in the dirt 
 A consequence of puttin' it worth 
 This money and ho's and clothes ain't worth it 
 Even those my pockets is hurtin' 
 For certain, it's gonna be curtains 
 If I keep on for certain 
 As you get older you just realize man 
 It's human nature to have thangs 
 But I got to get out the game 
 Don't be shoutin my name 
 Temptation callin 
 Will I sacrifice my life 
 In order to be ballin' this all in time 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 This is that shit that the po-po's hate 
 Where we talkin' to our folks and they love to relate 
 Shaking in their boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us
