 Dub your shit baby 
 Everybody put/throw your lighters up 
 Tell me, y'all finna fight or what? 
 Everybody get your shit started 
 This is *y'all* motherfuckin party! 
 (Boots) 
 Every death is an abrupt one 
 Every cop is a corrupt one 
 Without no cash up in the trust fund 
 Every cat wit a gat wanna bust one 
 Every guest want a plus-one 
 Every tenement's a penitent 
 Every tried man is innocent 
 Time served should be the cent spent 
 Everybody wanna hear the lick 
 Every one a y'all is getting pimped 
 Every time I spit I'm feelin' ripped 
 Every cancer is a homicide 
 Every boss better run and hide 
 Every human is some kin to Black 
 Every Visa got a pin to crack 
 Every verse is from the cardiac 
 Every search is involuntary 
 Every inmate want commisary 
 Every bank note is promissory 
 Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang 
 And when we come we takin' everything. 
 (Boots) 
 Every mack want a cadillac 
 Every mark want they scrilla back 
 Every narc want a hit of crack 
 In the park or a pontiac 
 Every little cent is to the rent 
 Every roach is a resident 
 Every truth ain't evident 
 Every slave story, present tense 
 Every uprise a consequence 
 Every time it be something sweet 
 Every banker is a fuckin' thief 
 Everybody betta holla wit me 
 Every fiend need a dolla fifty 
 Every crime that I do is petty 
 Every criminal is rich already 
 Every lender got a complex 
 Every single is a bomb threat 
 Every sellout, may ya hate my verse 
 Everybody, they gon' get it first 
 Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang 
 And when we come we taking everything
