Yeah 
 I'll have a Long Island Iced Tea, neat 
 Or whatever kinda poison knocks me back in my seat 
 'Cause a little earlier we was out in that street 
 The police tried to smash and they felt defeat 
 You know they got no idea what they done unleashed 
 Keep my card open but it's done deceased 
 Them thieves wanna talk when they cash decrease 
 Here's a toast to the folks who let action speak 
 I'll have a Long Island Iced Tea, straight 
 But the way my heart thumpin', I already levitate 
 'Cause a little earlier we made the whole earth quake 
 When we shut they shit down and had the boss irate 
 We are only a fetus, we are modeling the shape 
 We gon' make a masterpiece out of all the mistakes 
 But man, I'm too damn drunk to continue this debate 
 'Cause I can't articulate and I need to urinate 
 I'll have one Long Island with one ice cube 
 'Cause as far as rap go, he the muthafuckin' dude 
 Let the record reflect that today we lit a fuse 
 If I take one mo' shot, I'm dancin' on the bar nude 
 And ay, you talkin' in my ear wit like hella amplitude 
 Every little fight could build up for the big feud 
 Today we struck a blow for all us in servitude 
 But the thousands of people got me drunker than the booze
