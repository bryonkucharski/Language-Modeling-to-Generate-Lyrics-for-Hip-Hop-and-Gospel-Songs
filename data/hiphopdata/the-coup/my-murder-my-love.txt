Hey 
 Oh yeah 
 Hey 
 Oh yeah 
 Well, I've spoke the name of the Lord in vain 
 In the gunpowder and flame 
 And I've vomited slang in porcelain 
 And then claimed it was champagne 
 And I can rhyme silk with cigarettes 
 I can rhyme Jack Daniels with Triumph 
 But no sentence I could spit could've shifted events 
 In the back of that Plymouth Reliant 
 And philosophy is calculated 
 To be worth its weight in air 
 But the way you told me to fuck myself 
 Well, the words had a certain flair 
 I hope he fits the tux 
 I am just a man in flux 
 Let me clarify things with the way I strut 
 So I can shout with my mouth shut, we all say 
 My murder, my love 
 What were the cookies made of? 
 My murder, my sweet 
 What kind of pills did we eat? 
 My murder, my love 
 What were the cookies made of? 
 My murder, my sweet 
 What kind of pills did we eat? 
 Hey 
 Oh yeah 
 Hey 
 Oh yeah 
 The machinery of lamps in the sky tonight 
 Unfurl above electric lies of light 
 C'mon, grip me tight against the wall 
 Where the cuss words, piss and masterpiece fight 
 I'm alive, through the power of explosion 
 Colt 45 and a busted Trojan 
 Motion is evidence of belief 
 Especially with the world's most beautiful slogan 
 Applause from the mannequins should be ignored 
 Look for the harmony of pen and sword 
 Statues of our heroes turn to dust 
 We sing to snort the dust up off the floor 
 Well, I hope he fits the tux 
 Even mountains are in flux 
 Let us clarify things with the way we strut 
 So we can shout with our mouths shut, we all say 
 My, my, my, my, my murder, my love 
 What were the cookies made of? 
 My murder, my sweet 
 What kind of pills did we eat? 
 My murder, my love 
 What were the cookies made of? 
 My murder, my sweet 
 What kind of pills did we eat?
