Now when I go to bed it's almost time to wake up 
 Tryin' not to go to jail, tryin' not to cake up 
 And even when I serve soda it would be cold as fuck 
 Shiverin' in my sock, servin' ice for ten bucks 
 And you'd be in the house, all warm and shit 
 And ya ass got the sweater with the fire lit 
 And whatever ya want you ain't gotta lift a finger 
 If ya wanna a glass of water hit the maid on the ringer 
 Got a job for you under this hot ass sun 
 You tellin' me to hurry up and get some more shit done 
 I be so tired when I spit all my words slur together 
 Got so many calluses my hands are like leather 
 Watchin' MTV in yo big ass chair 
 Tryin' out slang words while you combin' ya hair 
 Ya productivity is wack bring that box here fo-sheezy 
 Go get some coffee, player, punch out before ya leave 
 Gotcho' feet up on the desk noddin' off to sleep 
 While I lift, push, pull, dig, sweat, and sweep 
 I could work hard all my life and in the end still suffer 
 'Cause the world is controlled by you lazy motherfuckers 
 Lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 Now you don't wash yo ass, you got a personal bather 
 If you roll out of bed it's like you doin' a favor 
 You was born into paper and that behavior 
 For a midnight snack, you have the bedroom catered 
 You ain't never learned to drive or tie yo shoe 
 I got my ear to the street and my eye on you 
 You got a secretary to write down your thoughts 
 On how to make us work hard and fatten up your vaults 
 TV say if ya poor, you must be slow and shiftless 
 But you pay em' to say that, so we don't want it different 
 Got a cook and a girl to bring the tray for you 
 You're hearin' this 'cause somebody pushed play for you 
 My head is poundin' now and my hands are shakin' 
 To keep my eyelids open takes concentration 
 I don't get no rest it's just a stay alive hustle 
 Making you stay rich without you moving a muscle 
 You think of people as your tool, so when your dick salute 
 You have a butler get the phone and call a prostitute 
 And say your sex drive's stronger than the engine of a trucker 
 But she'll have to be on top cause you a lazy motherfucker 
 Lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 A hundred person house there just to sanitize 
 You know you don't give a fuck but they all despise you 
 Millions over millions makin' shit for you to sell 
 But police on alert just in case we rebel 
 But it's gon' happen, captain, hope ya know that's why I'm rappin' 
 Once the toes start tappin', hands with gats start clappin', 
 'Cause this whole system's waitin' for you to kick it in Paris 
 Or roll through Hong Kong in a rickshaw carriage 
 So when you spend a dollar that's ten seconds of my time 
 And when ya spend a billion that's my life and that's a crime 
 'Cause for me life is hard like a track that I'm reppin' on 
 Callin' for the freedom of the backs that you steppin' on 
 Later for the pull up ya boot strap fastened 
 'Cause hard work got me to the chiropractor 
 But we can work hard to take back the bread and butter 
 Cause all these multimillionaires is lazy motherfuckers 
 Lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker 
 You's a lazy motherfucker, lazy motherfucker
