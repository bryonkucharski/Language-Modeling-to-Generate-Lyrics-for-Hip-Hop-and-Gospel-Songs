Monday rush, I'm 'sposed to skip 
 But I just found Sunday in yo' hips 
 Magic in the fingertips, and lips 
 Electric touch, solar kiss 
 Thoughts wrangled up, legs tangled up 
 Baby, do this feel good angled up? 
 Can't be expressed by a single fuck 
 Wanna gently caress it and bang it up 
 And yo' smile just seems so comfortable 
 Sho' wish this clock wasn't functional 
 'Sposed to be punctual and not keep the boss waitin' 
 But the sheet's sweatin' and the ceiling's pulsatin' 
 Music from the birds and cars with beat 
 Stop, pause, repeat, the stars release 
 Y'know most of my time belongs to the boss 
 Baby hold on tight, this is ours at least 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 Givin' head to you 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 Every sober mornin wit'chu is like we drunk at the Super 8 
 With laughin' and plannin in between while we recuperate 
 We communicate with mouths, fingers and hands 
 Cell phones with clocks, a thousand free minute plans 
 Lose me in your details, break my codes 
 Till all the good breakfast spots is closed 
 Them rich folks gots to knows, it's 'bout controllin these minutes 
 They can party 'cause we work till our lower back goes 
 The world outside feels claustrophobic 
 Undercover of you is where my thoughts exploded 
 Now back to our ancient lost aerobics 
 And the study of how bodies maybe tossed and folded 
 'Sposed to get up for work and ride on through 
 But last week he paid me with a IOU 
 I got to work at 9, if he don't pay me by 5 
 I'ma burn the place down by 5:02 
 'Cause when we give 'em all of our ticks on the clock 
 They stack chips on the knot, we get pissed on a lot 
 We need a twist on the plot, but before we head to work 
 Scoot a little to the left, let me kiss on the spot 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 I just wanna lay around all day in bed wit'chu 
 Givin' head to you 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 When we come together, what time is it? 
 When we respect each other, what time is it? 
 When we got our self-confidence, what time is it? 
 What time is it? 
 (Babe we gotta go) 
 I know baby, but you know it's hard to pull away from you 
 'Cause we go together like grits and cornbread 
 (You silly) 
 You know we stick together like peanut butter and jelly 
 (Let's go!) 
 We all over each other like white on rice 
 (Corny) 
 We be in bed together like Bush and Hussein 
 (WHAT?!) 
 I said, we be in bed together like George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein!
