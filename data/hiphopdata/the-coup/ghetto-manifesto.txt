(* ...I'm trying to get into this house party 
 But they ain't playin' nothin' I can feel... *) 
 I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court 
 I scribbled this on an application for county support 
 I practice this like a sport, met Donald Trump and he froze up 
 Standing on his Bentley yelling "Pimps down, hoes up" 
 Some tryin' to front off, break her ass a clump off 
 We gon' stop the world and make y'all motherfuckers jump off 
 This is my resume slash resignation 
 A ransom note with proposed legislation 
 A fevered ultimatum, you should take it verbatim 
 'Cause I got two bangin' pieces and you don't wanna date 'em 
 Flyin' kites for my folks at home, who takin' tokes alone 
 We payin' rent on shit they ain't even s'posed to own 
 Narratin' through my verse, agitatin' when ya curse 
 It's a million motherfuckers just waitin' on the first 
 Anticipatin' on the worst, wanna weightin' up ya purse 
 Shut the jobby job down at noon and don't disperse 
 They wouldn't pay ya ass far as they can throw you 
 They think you punkin' but they don't know you 
 Dissin' turf operetta, play with twelve shot Berettas 
 By the Burger King workers who be slappin' on ya lettuce 
 Wrote that in the back of those apartments 
 A coupon from agricultural departments 
 When we put down the X-O, we can let the threats go 
 And start shit, it's the ghetto manifesto 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey 
 Call me bird, 'cause of my legs but my ass don't sing 
 Got a house arrest anklet but it don't bling bling 
 Got a homie with a cell but that shit don't ring 
 But at lights out bars clang and souls get stang 
 Now it's the hustlin' sound, trick where they muscle around blacks 
 Make ya thoughts heavy, drop a joint and make the ground crack 
 Even renowned hack-historians have found that 
 The people only bound back when they pound back 
 So I take out a spray can and paste the pavement 
 Defacin' gravements of a sufferin' nascent 
 The files are flagrant and that's the fragrance 
 I overheard them askin' vagrants for patients 
 So check the liner notes, I steal my finer quotes 
 From people trying to throw the Bougies in designer bolts 
 And party liner jokes and all kinds of folks who all kind of broke 
 But bought twenties 'cause they feel like a lot of smoke 
 The trees we got lifted by made our feet dangle 
 So when I say "Burn One" I mean the Star-Spangled 
 Let's all get high from the income angle 
 Bump this at the party even if it ain't the single 
 Here's a slum serenade on razor blades and grenades 
 By the nannies and maids who be polishin' the suede 
 You could let the sess blow but let's make the sets grow 
 Into brigades with the ghetto manifesto 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey 
 That's what I'm talking about 
 Make me scream and shout 
 East, west, north and south 
 Gonna turn this party out, hey
