 I used to kick it with a brother named, Moe 
 Moe used to kick it with a brother named, Joe 
 Joe used to kick it with his girlfriend Lateisha 
 Whose brother Elmo, looked like me 
 Elmo used to elbow lots of brothers in the nose 
 Kick 'em when they down and he'd steal they shoes and clothes 
 Elmo would develop lots of beef as a tweaker 
 And all of them was mostly come lookin' for me 
 Imagine that, fat motherfuckers with bats tryin' 
 To rat pack, uh, time to get a gat 
 So I'm strapped 'cause I'm trapped like Roger Thomas in his fat 
 Momma's lap, what's happenin' here's a rap 
 Saturday twelve o'clock, told E-Roc, the whole plot 
 And what not, about, how our men are spottin 
 (E-Roc) 
 It's funny bets the money that they scared of po-po's 
 And this supposed to be some ruthless negros? 
 They regretting, Len saying "Pull that Hoyle card" 
 Disregarding come a brother, and now they act hard 
 I ain't clueless, we can do this 'cause it's heated 
 But don't trip, I got a .380 if it's needed 
 This is a lesson you can pass or flunk 
 So pile on the Right Guard, we got serious funk 
 Singers: 
 Why you waaaaannaaaaaa, funk with meeeeee? (Repeat 4x)

 Bet George and Bootsy, never had funk like this 
 Catch twenty-two, twist no fist can dismiss this 
 Rift that I'ma go through, maybe I can flow through 
 This whole ordeal and not pull out the black steel 
 And my friends make suggestions... 
 That I should squeal to the cops but that's out of the question 
 If I die by the trigger of a misled brother 
 Could he be judged by the system that is scared of me and others? 
 I believe no, so I don't go, with the flow 
 Even though I'm bout to roll with no paddle 
 Up a creek called shit, light is lit on the situation 
 Is me and him is gonna decrease the population 
 Now we wonder why our revolution never grow 
 Killin' motherfuckers just for steppin on our toe 
 If we had as much funk for our oppressors as we did 
 For ourselves, the blood would never flow again 
 And then, the uzis that were once used to kill each other 
 Could be used, to serve and protect the brothers 
 And the sisters and the cousins or whatever others 
 But the funk keeps growing like a fungus... 
 Singers: 
 Why you waaaaannaaaaaa, funk with meeeeee? (Repeat 4x) 
 (Boots) 
 Four years till I'm twenty-five, now I got a forty-five 
 Caliber don't take no jive, just pull to fix 
 Don't want to be eighty-sixed, route six six six ain't in my mix 
 Don't flap your lips about me takin' no, trips 
 You won't be takin' no sips from a milk carton 
 Seein my face with a caption, askin 
 "Have you seen Boots, he's missing in action" 
 This shit is more Off the Wall than Michael Jackson 
 Cause brothers who be doin' brothers who be doin' others 
 Screwin brothers but The Coup be doin' more than shoo-be-doin' 
 On the corner, talkin' revolution from Petoria to Florida 
 It's why it don't make sense that they want me a goner 
 On a, run cause some brothers in a ratpack think I'm 
 Poppin' junk 'cause they don't see for centuries 
 The genocidal funk so I'm a punk if I don't blast they ass 
 But I gots more funk for the rulin class 
 Will it ever end, will we ever win, drinkin' juice and gin 
 Five-oh gets again, gets off with a grin 
 National Guard sent in for when we got beef 
 You wanna pop the trunk we got serious funk 
 Singers: 
 Why you waaaaannaaaaaa, funk with meeeeee? (Repeat 4x)
