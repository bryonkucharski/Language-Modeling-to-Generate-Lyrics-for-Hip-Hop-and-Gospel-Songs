(Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?) 
 Now check it, the topic of discussion 
 Is more than a financial profit 
 United Snakes won't stop it 
 Blow for blow, the flow with the commentary gets 
 Seventy-six septillion tons a-spinnin' 
 Steady steppin into a new phase 
 New thoughts representing our slavery days 
 The seeds of weeds and crops is much more than you figure 
 Yo, if he's a black man he must be a nigger 
 They make a gimmick I wouldn't doubt 
 A sucker selling out for the sake of a scream and shout 
 Elements don't grow with nonsense 
 Rather kick a little bit of science 
 Science about controlling actions of another 
 America was built on the sweat of black sisters and brothers 
 Never allowed to breathe but allowed to bleed and breed 
 Stripped of our creed and religion surviving on intuition 
 And what the master said, give 'em 
 And besides the black man is the original lord of the land 
 So I'm clenching my right hand 
 Brothers and sisters we must fight this slumlord 
 Overlord of the concrete jungle, but I'm humble 
 As I witness my opponent crumble 
 Like the shack that I live in the house that I rent from him 
 Roach infested I'm sure that the rats are nesting 
 The heat doesn't work he still hasn't checked it 
 Disrespected me for the last time 
 I loaded up the nine stepping double time 
 Bullseye 
 Another point scored 
 Right between the eyes of my landlord 
 Verse Two: Defrost 
 They tell me to hold my peace but I just can't 
 But I'm Defrost of the rap group of Point Blank 
 So me I'm chilling at the table with my family, hypothetically 
 The situation, hard for me to handle 
 I heard a bang, bang, bang at my door 
 While they sitting at the table, trying to say grace 
 Now I got three meals and a roof over my head 
 Cash is made in lump sums 
 Don't you know not to fuck with the mao mao 
 We didn't vote on it, this land was bought and sold 
 I learned the game and I became a revolutionary 
 I need $600 by the end of the week 
 I want to kill my landlord, murder in the first degree 
 And I laugh 'cause America is not my home 
 Landlord, I got a little message for you
