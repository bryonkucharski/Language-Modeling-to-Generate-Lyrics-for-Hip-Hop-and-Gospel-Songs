Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself 
 But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit 
 If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 I spit game on a regular basis 
 Now everybody looking at my hand like I'm holding all the aces 
 Cool that they know our faces from different places 
 But you can't catch up if you don't know what the pace is 
 Everywhere we go you know especially in the O we hear 
 "Coup, Coup, you know we got love fo' sho'" 
 But even mo' when they see us on B-E-and-T and 
 M-T-and-V but me and E can't pay the P-G-and-E 
 Power come from the barrel of a bucker 
 I use the mic so that we aim at the same motherfucker 
 'Cause your shit could go gold and the only cash you got 
 Is the silver kind that don't fold 
 I'm gettin dope when they ask about the road that I passed 
 My peoples really be thinking they gon' come up fast 
 And then come rap and shake they ass 
 You ain't the first motherfucker who done scheme to scam 
 Then plan to scram up out the ghetto let me break this down from kids to grams 
 Fuck the videos with the Benzes 
 And the cellular phones, spending hundreds like quarters 
 The Benz is they partner's, the money's on loan, and umm... 
 "The cellular number you have reached is out of order." 
 Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself 
 But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit 
 If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves 
 But a name don't mean wealth, well let me up you on this shit 
 If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 I mocked 
 "Rock Box" 
 wearin' socks in my basement, told my pops 
 I'm fi'n to have as much mail as they got, not 
 I still plot to keep my cash clot flowin' 
 My mind is bent on the rent, I'm barely makin it microphonin' 
 It's true, it's a few getting fund expansions 
 It ain't like Acorn Projects gon' move into mansions 
 Straight authenticized shit, over synthesized hits 
 With this misty eyed 'mental make your teeth grit 
 And I'm not tryin to diss like it's a bandwagon trend 
 They selling six-packs of them wavies out the ghetto again 
 In the 20's it was rocks, in the 50's doo-wop 
 It's 1994 and everybody's store hop'n 
 And ain't nobody really trying to hear me speak it 
 They too busy watchin' Luke, gettin' interviewed by Robin Leach 
 So if you're modest and don't hire economics 
 Just kick it with The Coup, smoke this dub sack of funk 
 Now motherfuckers done made a name for theyself 
 But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit 
 If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 Now motherfuckers done made a name for themselves 
 But a name don't mean wealth, but let me up you on the shit 
 If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 (Come with some game) 
 I'm gon' die before I lie to my peoples on the block 
 It's like frontin' you gon' shoot when you ain't got no glock 
 You bet' not 
 (that's a punk trick) 
 this is how we run shit 
 I'm fi'n to pitch a fit cause I'm tired of hearing dumb shit 
 Why do motherfuckers get up out and go for single 
 When the real high rollers draft a army to protect they Pringles? 
 Confusion, just a system based on prostitution 
 They done ganked you, don't be no stank fool with they solution 
 Unless you got about a million semi-automatics 
 You gon' think you strivin doin them ho-style acrobatics 
 No I don't have it like that, Planned Parenthood ain't got it 
 I keep my whole life savings stuffed in my back pocket, flock it 
 I'm scraping fronts off like plaque, no slack 
 I come realistic like Radio Shack 
 Intact and fat motherfuckers finally get they shit right 
 Ain't no fight, they scared shitless, all they do is grab the mic 
 Ain't no organizing real shit on the street, it's a fleet 
 Of revolutionaries in the studio making beats 
 So fuck the fame, fuck the game, fuck the riches foo' 
 I ain't got shit unless all my folks gon' have theirs too 
 Now motherfuckers done made a name for theyself 
 But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit 
 If we was up in this, just to get up out the ghetto 
 Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit 
 Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves

 The Coup is up in the house, and we run this shit like diarrhea 
 (Cheerio) 
 You know?
