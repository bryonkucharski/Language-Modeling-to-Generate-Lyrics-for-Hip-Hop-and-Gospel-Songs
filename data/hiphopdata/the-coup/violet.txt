Under hesitant flicker of neon glow 
 Where the trash cans bloom and the needles grow 
 I wiped that shit off my mouth and I grabbed the dough 
 And that's all y'all need to know 
 "Let the glitter of the burning debris bless me tonight." 
 Is what I thought and inhaled nicotine delight 
 Screams for my life scripted by deal memos 
 From the back of a bullet proof steel limo 
 It ain't nothin' in my life that's been real gentle 
 Till the day of your magnificent beer swindle 
 Told my story, you didn't look at me funny 
 And the kiss felt like you was payin' me money 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 I must a missed your call 
 C'mon 
 They said the sparkle in your eyes was just 'cause of the daggers 
 If they wanted us to leave they was gon' have to drag us 
 Skyscrapers crowded around to watch 
 As we laughed at the faulty perception of clocks 
 Every 43 bus stop on foothill could testify 
 Your middle finger in the air was like blessin' the sky 
 And the overpass, it shook like a overdose 
 And the rocks caught the holy ghost 
 And the wind made the chainlinks sing falsetto 
 We made a promise we would never settle 
 Standin' on a hydrant, you declared it a holiday 
 Against police and pimps we would have our way 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 I must a missed your call 
 C'mon 
 The room and that dude had layers of filth 
 We sprinted out with the cash and got higher than stilts 
 I wondered if the birds were flyin' to somethin' or flyin' away 
 You said, "Both" and hit the E and the J 
 Now, the stars up there are for the few who use 'em 
 We karate'd down the block like the new solution 
 Street level, eye level, make your wish 
 You told me I could write a novel and make us rich 
 That's the last time I seen your crazy, brown high beams 
 I'm still in front of that buildin' with the white screen 
 Stop through for a hot second, holla back 
 I don't even want my fifty dollars back 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 C'mon, holla at ya dog 
 I must a missed your call 
 C'mon
