Now another FBI monitor with no feedback 
 See me on the street, ask me where the weed at 
 Or the coke, "I don't sell", I yell, they don't believe that 
 Set me up for running, breathin' like a Sleestak 
 Run into a car and almost bent my knee back 
 'S better than the sale where my lawyers fee stack 
 Run into a liquor store, they ask what you do 
 Wearin' boo boo, I'm with my man M'duku 
 The fact don't come through, I said merci beaucoup 
 If they ask you was I runnin', tell them bastards I flew 
 Made it to the hood, palace to catch a few flicks 
 Police did a raid, terrorizin' crew shit 
 Bustin' dope eatin' mommas while they makin' cool whip 
 Face down, gettin' dirt on my back to school fit 
 My neighbor next to me got black and blue lips 
 When the fuse lit, you goin' see the view flip 
 Kick our boot up they ass, ask 'em if the shoe fit 
 'Til then they wanna see us pushing up tulips 
 Press my nuts so much, shit, I think I'm sterile 
 Got up, brush the gravel off my appeal 
 This girl, Sheryl got parole violation 
 Said she was high 'cause of pupil dilation 
 If you never been to jail now since infinity 
 You'll get searched livin' in this vicinity 
 Or harassed, beat the shit, I mean the living daylights 
 Wouldn't be no dope slangin' if McDonald's paid right 
 The ruling class ships dope to you and me 
 And don't get arrested, is this lunacy? 
 Or is it diplomatic immunity? 
 Is it a war on drugs, or just my community? 
 Now who gets paper and who gets perved 
 Who gets slapped and who gets served 
 This type o' shit get on my last nerve 
 I think about in the car and it starts to swerve 
 Who gets paper and who gets perved 
 Who gets slapped and who gets served 
 This type o' shit get on my last nerve 
 I think about in the car and it starts to swerve 
 I got a communist plot to get the federalizes out 
 So many cops'd run in flock it's been away 
 Tupac, you got a flake and two rocks and two Gs in the shoe box 
 'Cause was it after two knocks, you hurdled fences in your socks 
 This is full a junta, keep it caliente 
 Let's send the president on a one-way 
 Trip to Kaiser permanent not a teacher, but a sensei 
 These rhymes are for battle, plus you gotta get the rent paid 
 I bust a donut up in front of Winchell's 
 Make this police state officials 
 'Cause they talk differential, now it's essential 
 These rhymes ain't provincial 
 Coroners call our bodies white chalk stencils 
 Broke as fuck eatin' lentils with no utensil 
 That type a shit motivated my pencil 
 It ain't mental, it's material 
 Police are the fists of the imperial 
 I'm spittin' through your stereo 
 Babies need cereal folks, need currency 
 My job got a crowd wavin' applications fervently 
 Some'd get accepted, most'd get rejected 
 Guess they goin' have to hustle 'til the new prison get erected 
 And now they sully unemployment street 
 They be microchips for two dollars a week 
 And they'll be packin' us in there in droves and fleets 
 And Channel Two goin' call it cleanin' up the street 
 Now who gets paper and who gets perved 
 Who gets slapped and who gets served 
 This type o' shit get on my last nerve 
 I think about in the car and it starts to swerve 
 Who gets paper and who gets perved 
 Who gets slapped and who gets served 
 This type o' shit get on my last nerve 
 I think about in the car and it starts to swerve 
 Now who gets paper and who gets perved 
 Who gets slapped and who gets served 
 This type o' shit get on my last nerve 
 I think about in the car and it starts to swerve
