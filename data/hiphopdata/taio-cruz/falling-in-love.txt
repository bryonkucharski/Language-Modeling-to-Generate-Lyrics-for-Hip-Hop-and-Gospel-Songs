It must be love 
 Because we are too afraid to say 
 It must be love 
 And so we paint everything in gray 
 Lets not lose this chance 
 Hold on to my hands 
 Lets not waste this time 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, for falling in love 
 It must be hard 
 To know the we'll never be the same 
 It must be hard 
 To take this on on a leap of faith 
 Lets not lose our way 
 Lets not wait to say 
 How we feel inside 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, 5x 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, falling in love 
 When you're falling, falling 
 Just don't let go 
 When you're falling, falling 
 Just don't let go 
 Lets not lose this chance 
 Hold on to my hands 
 Lets not waste this time 
 Cause today, 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, falling in love 
 Falling in love, falling in love, 
 Falling in love, 
 Cause today 
 Is a great day 
 For falling in love, falling in love
