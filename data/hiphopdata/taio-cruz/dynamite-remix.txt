 Brands, brands, brands, brands 
 Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands 
 You, you 
 Cause it goes on and on and on 
 And it goes on and on and on 
 I throw my hands up in the air sometimes 
 Saying AYO 
 Gotta let go 
 I wanna celebrate and live my life 
 Saying AYO

 'Cause we gon' rock this club 
 We gon' go all night 
 We gon' light it up

 'Cause I told you once 
 Now I told you twice
