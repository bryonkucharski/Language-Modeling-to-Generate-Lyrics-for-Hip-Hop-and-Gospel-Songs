I'm in a battle with my heartbeat 
 The more I struggle the more I get deep 
 I go full throttle down the dark streets 
 And there is trouble ahead I can't weak 
 It's like I'm running through a red light 
 Girl you know you make me weak 
 I should be hittin' all the brake lights 
 Hold up, hold up oh 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 It isn't like me to get caught up 
 But when you running you're never quite free 
 I wasn't really meant to find love 
 But now you found me and got me all weak 
 It's like I'm running through a red light 
 Girl you know you make me weak 
 I should be hittin' all the brake lights 
 Hold up, hold up oh 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 I'm in a battle with my heartbeat 
 The more I struggle the more I get deep 
 I go full throttle down the dark streets 
 And there is trouble ahead I can't weak 
 I can't weak I can't weak 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on 
 You know you make my engine run, run, run, run 
 And there's no turning back us 
 We've gone too far 
 I'll drive you like a fast car 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 I'll drive you like a fast car
