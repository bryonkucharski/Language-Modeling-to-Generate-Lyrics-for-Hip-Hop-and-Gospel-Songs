Oh written in the stars 
 A million miles away 
 A message to the mane 
 No 
 Seasons come and go 
 But I will never change 
 And I'm on my way 
 Let's go 
 Yeah 
 You're listening now 
 They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while 
 That's why they play my song on so many different dials 
 'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child 
 When they see me everybody brrap's, brraps 
 Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack 
 I cried tear drops over the massive attack 
 I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat 
 Look at my jacket and hat 
 So damn berserk 
 So down to earth 
 I'm bringing gravity back 
 Adopted by the major I want my family back 
 People work hard just to get all their salary taxed 
 Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman 
 Where the hells all the sanity at, damn 
 I used to be the kid that no one cared about 
 That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out 
 Oh written in the stars 
 A million miles away 
 A message to the mane 
 No 
 Seasons come and go 
 But I will never change 
 And I'm on my way 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yeah, I needed a change 
 When we ate we never took because we needed a change 
 I needed a break 
 For a sec' I even gave up believing and praying 
 I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray 
 They say the money is the root to the evilest ways 
 But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake 
 Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed 
 Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam' 
 Since the day I thought of that cunning plan 
 One day I had a dream I tried to chase it 
 But I wasn't going nowhere, running man! 
 I knew that maybe someday I would understand 
 Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand 
 Everyone's a kid that no-one cares about 
 You just have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out 
 Oh written in the stars 
 A million miles away 
 A message to the mane 
 No 
 Seasons come and go 
 But I will never change 
 And I'm on my way 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh written in the stars 
 A million miles away 
 A message to the mane 
 No 
 Seasons come and go 
 But I will never change 
 And I'm on my way
