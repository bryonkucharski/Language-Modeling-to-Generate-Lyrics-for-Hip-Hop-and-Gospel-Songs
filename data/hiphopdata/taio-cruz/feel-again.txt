I believe that in time my heart will heal again 
 And I believe that in time my heart will feel again 
 So I keep on holding on, yeah 
 So I keep on being strong, yeah 
 'Cause I know one day I'm gonna feel again 
 I know one day I'm gonna feel again 
 And I know although my heart hurts now 
 I'll find a way to get up off the ground 
 Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again 
 I believe that this heart of mine can make it through 
 And I believe that my heart can make it over you 
 So I keep on holding on, yeah 
 So I keep on being strong, yeah 
 'Cause I know one day I'm gonna feel again 
 I know one day I'm gonna feel again 
 And I know although my heart hurts now 
 I'll find a way to get up off the ground 
 Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again 
 And though it's hard for me to breathe 
 And even harder to believe 
 I know that one day I'm gonna find 
 I'm gonna be just fine 
 'Cause one day I'm gonna feel again 
 I know one day I'm gonna feel again 
 And I know although my heart hurts now 
 I'll find a way to get up off the ground 
 Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again
