I can't believe I got a second chance at love 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love 
 Them mistakes I will learn from them 
 Now you've changed, you were stern back them 
 Close the case, where's the lid 
 Rebuild the bridge that I burned down then 
 Back to an item all resurrected 
 Now we're back online, we're connected 
 Your older, I'm wiser, let's paint this picture perfect 
 I could have been anywhere by now, 
 But nowhere feels better than home 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 If you don't know you should know right now 
 That you're the only that I want 
 Oh oh oh 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love

 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah, oh 
 Yo, if the vision ain't clear for now 
 Wipe my eyes, and I cleanse the mouth 
 Went from up to down to I nearly drowned 
 And now we're back around three sixty 
 And I missed you more than you miss me 
 It's a four letter word that my lips read 
 Now we're doing it faster in light speed 
 And the time is right so kiss me 
 I could have been anywhere by now, 
 But nowhere feels better than home 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 If you don't know you should know right now 
 That you're the only that I want 
 Oh oh oh 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love

 They said the doors were closing in 
 Grab the towel throw them in 
 Let's try a second time, if it's wrong we fit the crime 
 Now the doors are opening, take my hand let's try again 
 Yeah, we're born to fight, welcome some soldiers in 
 I can't believe I got a second chance at love
