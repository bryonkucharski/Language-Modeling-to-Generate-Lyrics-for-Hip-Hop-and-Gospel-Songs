Here you are again, sitting at our 
 Place with him 
 I can't believe that you would be 
 So cold, 
 I know that you wanna be, with 
 Somebody new and that's cool with me, 
 But this right here is just so cold 
 Didn't I give you all the things that I 
 Said I would, 
 Didn't I take you all the places that 
 I said I would, 
 Didn't I give you the love that I said 
 I would, 
 Tell me how could you go, and... 
 And Give my love away 
 And Give my love away 
 And Give my love away 
 And Give my love away 
 And Give my love away 
 And Give my love away 
 You're So cold 
 I'm hoping now my eyes deceive, 'cause 
 This really can't be what I see, 
 I can't believe that you would be so cold, 
 This house we bought for you and I, The 
 Bed we made love is where he lies? 
 Girl this right here is just so cold 
 Didn't I give you all the things that I said 
 I would, 
 Didn't I take you to the places that I said 
 I would, 
 Didn't I give you the love that I said I 
 Would, 
 Tell me how could you go, and...
