I think the stars are especially bright tonight 
 And I love the way they shine 
 Reflecting inside your eyes 
 It's you and me forever 
 That's what I know for sure 
 My heart is here for you 
 Just like an open door 
 I can't say in any better way 
 Hard to explain 
 What you mean to me 
 You're beautiful 
 And I can't find 
 Any better line 
 For design 
 Any better sing for 
 You're beautiful 
 I feel the sun 
 He's especially warm today 
 Well I guess you may 
 I guess the rain, go and come back another day 
 You know I love your smile 
 But that's all I need for me 
 And living my life with you, 
 It's just like a fantasy 
 I can't say in any better way 
 Hard to explain 
 What you mean to me 
 You're beautiful 
 And I can't find 
 Any better line 
 For design 
 Any better sing for 
 You're beautiful 
 I can't say in any better way 
 Hard to explain 
 What you mean to me 
 You're beautiful
