I search the world to find the girl 
 I need, I need 
 I know she's also searching out 
 For me, for me 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I search the world to find the girl 
 I need, I need 
 I know she's also searching out 
 For me, for me 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I will... 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 I keep on going way past the 11th hour 
 To find you 
 I will...
