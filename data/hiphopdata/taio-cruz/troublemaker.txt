I saw when arrived looking like a supermodel 
 You ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle 
 I like the way you ... put that thing on ... 
 So get, get get get up on the ... 
 I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica 
 Pretend that I am dinner you can be my song shake up 
 You ain't tryin' to hide it girl you're a troublemaker 
 And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker. 
 I throw my hands up if you believe in me now 
 I keep my hands up and do it all for the now 
 Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa 
 Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa. 
 Sexy little mama ...nice to meet you 
 Can I be in your classroom and be your private teacher 
 If I bring up my camera will you be in my future 
 'Cause we're gonna do some things 
 Hope your daddy ain't no preacher 
 I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica 
 Pretend that I am dinner you can be my song shake up 
 You ain't tryin' to hide it girl you're a troublemaker 
 And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker. 
 I throw my hands up if you believe in me now 
 I keep my hands up and do it all for the now 
 Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa 
 Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa.
