Now I feel that this hold of mine has taken many forms 
 Still sometimes the rain can turn into a waterfall 
 The prettiest things can come out of the coldest mind, yeah 
 And even with broken wings, sometimes you find your way to fly 
 It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 It's time to be 
 Now I feel that this soul of mine has had its many tolls, yeah 
 Still sometimes the pain is what we need for us to grow, yeah 
 So when it's time for me to look into my deepest side 
 I will, I will find a way to hold onto the love inside 
 It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be 
 See I can be anything I want to be 
 All I have to do is put my mind to it and I can do it 
 So what I want you to do is put your fist to the sky and say it with me: 
 I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder 
 Yes, I can be 
 I can be
