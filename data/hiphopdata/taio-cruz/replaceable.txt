Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't

 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 You're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 All it takes is just one more lie 
 One more small indiscretion 
 I don't wanna hear your alibi 
 I don't wanna hear your confession 
 You know I love you 
 But don't forget it's true 
 That you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 So many try to hold my hand 
 Try hard just to be a part of me 
 But you act with your single plan 
 So why shouldn't I take my heart with me 
 You know I love you 
 But don't forget it's true 
 That you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 Cause right now you are walking on dangerous ground 
 This could be over if you keep playing around 
 I'm keeping it ice, I'm keeping it diamond, keeping it crystal clear 
 You are inter-changeable 
 Baby it's unmistakeable 
 You're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause you're replaceable, replaceable 
 So don't you ever ever get too comfortable 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 'Cause I could easily easily easily 
 Oh so easily easily easily change you 
 Oh 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't 
 Don't think I won't
