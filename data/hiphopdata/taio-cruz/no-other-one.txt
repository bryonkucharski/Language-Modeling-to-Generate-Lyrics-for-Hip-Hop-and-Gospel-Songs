 Look, I don't need change but you know what that's funny 
 Can't you see the time, who's got money? 
 Money, cash out, leave with my tip 
 On a ten dollar meal, no change on my hunny 
 Rokstarr shades and you looking so stunning 
 Stunning, that's how it looks when we be hand in hand 
 And walking the streets when nobody else can match our flavor 
 How could you think I was ever gonna change ya 
 I ain't never gonna change ya 
 I don't need to ever exchange 
 (You know I) 
 I don't need to ever replace 
 (You know I) 
 I'm not going any damn place 
 (You know I) 
 You should know that I, I, I 
 (Oh, I) 
 I know no other one, I know no other one, I know, oh 
 I know no other one, I know no other one, all I need is you 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 All I need is you 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 I know no other one, I know no other one, I know, oh 
 I know no other one, I know no other one, all I need is you 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 All I need is you 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 All I need is you
