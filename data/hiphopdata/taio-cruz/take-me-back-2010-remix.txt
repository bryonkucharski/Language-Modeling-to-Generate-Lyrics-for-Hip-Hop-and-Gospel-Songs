Flee, she's telling me she's over me 
 Babe don't run no jokes on me 
 In my mind I'm taken back 
 And now it feels like make believe 
 Yeah! 
 I play the game, 
 Off the leash I strayed away 
 I found my way back home, 
 Let me in I'm at the gates stryde's! 
 I didn't mean to let you go 
 I didn't mean to let you down 
 I'm sorry that I led you on 
 But I really need you around 
 Tell me can I have you here 
 'Cause I really need you right now 
 And I'm hoping you'll take me 
 Hoping, Hoping you'll take me back 
 Oh I... I... 
 I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady 
 All I need to know is 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 'Cause I can't live without ya oh oh oh 
 (Girl I can't live without ya oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh) 
 I really wanna start again 
 I really wanna start it right 
 I just wanna do what I can 
 'Cause I really think you and I 
 Should give it just one more chance 
 Should give it just one more try 
 I'm hoping you take me 
 Hoping, Hoping you take me back 
 Yo I'm hoping you take me back 
 That's weight of my shoulders and aching back 
 Turn a different [~unverified~] life 
 I would show you that 
 Till I'm stuck in your mind 
 Like a favourite track 
 I'll find your spot 
 That's kinda soft 
 My cheeky smile I'm wiping off 
 If you say no 
 I will deal with that 
 I'm hoping you'll take me back 
 Flee, (Flee) 
 I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady 
 All I need to know is 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 'Cause I can't live without ya oh oh oh 
 (Girl I can't live without ya oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh) 
 Girl I need you back whoa 
 ('Cause I can't live without ya) 
 'Cause I actually thought I could cope on my on whoa 
 ('Cause I can't live without ya) 
 Girl I need you back whoa 
 ('Cause I can't live without ya) 
 'Cause I actually thought I could cope on my on whoa 
 ('Cause I can't live without ya) 
 I've played away I've grown (oh oh oh) 
 Now I need you back in my zone (oh oh oh) 
 I'm hoping you'll take me 
 Hoping, I'm hoping you'll take me back 
 Oh I... I... (flee) 
 (Flee) 
 I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady 
 I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady 
 All I need to know is 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 Can you take me back? can you take me back? 
 'Cause I can't live without ya oh oh oh 
 (Girl I can't live without ya oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
