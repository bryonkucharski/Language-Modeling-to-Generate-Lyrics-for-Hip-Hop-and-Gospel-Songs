I saw when you arrived 
 Looking like a super model 
 Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle 
 I love the way you ride 
 Put that thing on full throttle 
 So get get get up on the saddle 
 I wanna see you move like the movie in Jamaica 
 Pretend that I'm a dinner, she gon' me my salt shaker 
 You ain't tryin' to hide it 
 Girl you're a troublemaker 
 And I'm a troublemaker 
 I throw my hands up 
 If you believe in me now 
 I keep my hands up 
 And do it all for the now 
 I sing out 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Sexy lil mama 
 It's really nice to meet ya 
 Can I be in you classroom 
 And be your private teacher 
 If I bring on my camera 
 Would you be in my feature 
 'Cause we gon' do some things 
 Hope your dad ain't a preacher 
 I wanna see you move like the movie in Jamaica 
 Pretend that I'm a dinner, she gon' me my salt shaker 
 You ain't tryin' to hide it 
 Girl you're a troublemaker 
 And I'm a troublemaker 
 I throw my hands up 
 If you believe in me now 
 I keep my hands up 
 And do it all for the now 
 I sing out 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh 
 I love the way you dance 
 Oh, it makes me crazy 
 I wanna see you move 
 So just let it go baby 
 I feel like we can do this 
 If you wanna go with it 
 Let's take it to the top 
 Push it to the limit 
 Take it to the top 
 Push it to the limit, limit, limit 
 To the limit, limit, limit 
 I throw my hands up 
 If you believe in me now 
 I keep my hands up 
 And do it all for the now 
 I sing out 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh 
 Oheohoeoh
