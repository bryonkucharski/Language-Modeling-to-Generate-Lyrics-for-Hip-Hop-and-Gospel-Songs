Should we say go? 
 Should we say stay? 
 Do we stand tall? 
 Or do we fade away? 
 Do we keep on? 
 Or Do we fall down? 
 I won't say goodbye 
 I won't say that now 
 (I'll keep loving you forever 
 Because I swore I would 
 You know my word is good) [x2] 
 Love you 
 (Forever and ever love you) [x8]
