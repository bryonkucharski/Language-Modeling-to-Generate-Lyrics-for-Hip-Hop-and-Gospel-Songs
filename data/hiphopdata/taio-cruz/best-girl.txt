Hey Hey Hey [x8] 
 Young girl you're the type I need 
 Baby you should know you are the one that I see 
 Everything about you is the way that I like 
 We can do it baby anytime of the night 
 Cause you stay down and you always go right 
 Even when we tired girl you wanna go twice 
 I just wanna tell you're the one that I need 
 Baby you're the one, the only one for me 
 So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean 
 We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin' 
 I feel the lotion feel emotion 
 And I just gotta tell you one more time 
 You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world 
 Baby you're the best in the whole wide world 
 You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need 
 Baby you're the one, only one for me 
 The best damn girl I've ever seen in my life 
 Every time I look at you I'm proud that you're mine 
 You just got the shape, just the shape that I like 
 Everything about you got me feeling all right 
 So I know that we can do it, baby all night 
 We can make love anytime that you like 
 I just wanna tell you're the one that I need 
 Baby you're the one the only one for me 
 So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean 
 We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin' 
 I feel the lotion feel emotion 
 And I just gotta tell you one more time

 And I love the way that we dress, the freshest

 Pumpin' that brand new shizzle, by the R.K. 
 And I'm hardly, ever shy baby 
 That's why I say it lookin' at you in your eyes baby 
 I got the vehicle, let's take this for a ride baby 
 Now listen one more time

 You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need 
 Baby you're the one, only one for me
