One moment, one moment ago, I left, I left the road 
 And got lost with no map to find but just stop 
 And it got me right back home to where you are 
 To the place I need, to the place I started 
 Where I come home, the place I belong with you 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to 
 Only you, only you, only you, only you 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 Only you 
 I walked, I walked the road for so long, for so long alone 
 Until I found one ray of light I need 
 And it got me right back home to where you are 
 To the place I need, to the place I started 
 Where I come home, the place I belong with you 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to 
 Only you, only you, only you, only you 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 Only you, only you 
 When you are near the way is clear 
 You show me who I am 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to 
 Only you, only you, only you, only you 
 And when I'm lost it's you I turn to 
 Only you 
 One moment, one moment ago I left, I left the road
