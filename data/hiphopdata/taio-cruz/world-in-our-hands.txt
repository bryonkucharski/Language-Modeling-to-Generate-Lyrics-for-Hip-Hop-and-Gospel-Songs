No words can hurt us 
 No fire can burn us 
 No walls can hold us 
 Cause, no one controls us 
 'Cause we're strong and we're fast 
 Our time has come at last 
 Just hold on, don't go anywhere 
 'Cause we've waited all of our lives 
 Now we're seeing here in our rise 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 These hands can build up 
 All that we dreamed of 
 Our love will take us 
 Where no one can break us 
 'Cause we're strong and we're fast 
 Our time has come at last 
 Just hold on, don't go anywhere 
 'Cause we've waited all of our lives 
 Now we're seeing here in our rise 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'm not gonna lose you now 
 I'm not gonna lose you now 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Baby no more waiting tonight 
 We got the world in our hands 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
