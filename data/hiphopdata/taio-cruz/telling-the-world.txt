Every part in my heart I'm giving out 
 Every song on my lips I'm singing out 
 Any fear in my soul I'm letting go 
 And anyone who ask I'll let them know 
 She's the one, she's the one 
 I say it loud 
 She's the one, she's the one 
 I say it proud 
 Ring a bell, Ring a bell 
 For the whole crowd 
 Ring a bell, Ring a bell 
 I'm telling the world 
 That I've found a girl 
 The one I can live for 
 The one who deserves 
 Every part in my heart I'm giving out 
 Every song on my lips I'm singing out 
 Any fear in my soul I'm letting go 
 And anyone who ask I'll let them know 
 She's the one, she's the one 
 I say it loud 
 She's the one, she's the one 
 I say it proud 
 Ring a bell, Ring a bell 
 For the whole crowd 
 Ring a bell, Ring a bell 
 I'm telling the world 
 That I've found a girl 
 The one I can live for 
 The one who deserves 
 To give all my heart 
 A reason to fly 
 The one I can live for 
 A reason for life 
 Oe oh oe oh 
 Yeah yeah 
 Oe oh oe oh 
 Yeah yeah 
 Oe oh oe oh 
 Yeah yeah
