Wake 
 Me, I'm dreaming 
 Is my heart still beating 
 Cause this life has never felt so good 
 So hot, she's steaming 
 With no rhyme, or reason 
 Sexy has never looked so good 
 Right here, right now 
 This look on your face 
 I don't want it to fade 
 So strong I know 
 This just won't break 
 Like a diamond 
 Let's let this feeling go on, 
 And on, and on, and on 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Let's let this feeling go on, 
 And on, and on, and on 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Last night we rocked them 
 Tonight we poppin' 
 Tomorrow do it all again 
 This life we living, is just the beginning 
 Hell yeah, you know there's more to come 
 Right here, right now 
 This look on your face 
 I don't want it to fade 
 So strong I know 
 This just won't break 
 Like a diamond 
 Let's let this feeling go on, 
 And on, and on, and on 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Let's let this feeling go on, 
 And on, and on, and on 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Let's let this feeling go on, 
 And on, and on, and on 
 Going on, and on, and on 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Make it last forever
