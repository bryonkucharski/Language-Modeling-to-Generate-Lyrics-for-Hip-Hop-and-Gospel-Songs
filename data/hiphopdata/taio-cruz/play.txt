Oh they don't understand 
 That I just wanna dance 
 That I just wanna dance 
 I just, I just wanna dance 
 And they don't even know 
 That I'm about to blow 
 Yeah I'm about to blow 
 I'mma, I'mma bout to blow 
 And I just wanna hit the club 
 And drop it to the floor 
 And when they think I've had enough 
 Then I'mma give them more 
 We rock it through the night, 
 And then we rock it through the day 
 The only button we know 
 How to press is play 
 I wanna show it 
 So I'mma keep it going 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving 
 If you ain't from the play 
 Get up out of my way 
 Get up out of my way 
 Ge-Get up out of my way 
 'Cause I'm about to mosh 
 Do it just like a boss 
 Do it just like a boss 
 Do-do it just like a boss 
 And I just wanna hit the club 
 And drop it to the floor 
 And when they think I've had enough 
 Then I'mma give them more 
 We rock it through the night, 
 And then we rock it through the day 
 The only button we know 
 How to press is play 
 I wanna show it 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving 
 And I just wanna hit the club 
 And drop it to the floor 
 And when they think I've had enough 
 Then I'mma give them more 
 We rock it through the night, 
 And then we rock it through the day 
 The only button we know 
 How to press... Play 
 I wanna show it 
 So I'mma keep it going 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh 
 Play 
 Don't stop the music 
 DJ just keep it moving
