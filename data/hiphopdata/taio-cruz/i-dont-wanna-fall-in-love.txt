Strings 
 You're the one, the one I adore, 
 The only one my life was put here for, 
 Though people try to poison with lies, 
 I see the truth when I look in your eyes, 
 You're the one that I wanna grow 
 Old with 
 The only one I want by my side 
 And you're the one that I know I can 
 Grow with, 
 That is why I gotta say... 
 I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm 
 Loving you, unless I'm loving you, 
 I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm 
 Loving you, unless I'm loving you, 
 Now it seems to me the angels above, 
 Created you for me to love, 
 And the way I feel it can't be denied, no 
 'Cause you know it's true when you look in 
 My eyes, 
 I'm the one that you wanna grow 
 Old with 
 The only one who's really by your side 
 And I'm the one that you know you can 
 Grow with, 
 That is why you gotta say... 
 If I'm not loving you I don't want no one 
 Else, it's true 
 Baby I'd much rather be by myself, 
 'Cause you 
 You do something to me I can't 
 Describe, that's why 
 That's why I gotta say I... that's why I 
 Gotta say I... 
 I said I, I don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you) 
 Don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you,) 
 I said I, I don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you) 
 Don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you,) 
 I said I, I don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you) 
 Don't wanna fall in love 
 (Unless I'm loving you,)
