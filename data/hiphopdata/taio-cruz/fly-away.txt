We Could Fly Away, 
 Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
 We Could Fly Away, 
 Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
 Some where far some place where no one else can go, 
 Some place where only you and I know how to get there, 
 Some place where only doves have seen the skies 
 Some place where only you and I know how to get there, 
 And we can touch the sky, 
 Together we can find a way, 
 We can make it there, 
 And no one will stand in our way 
 We can even go where nobody knows, 
 Where only you and I... 
 We Could Fly Away, 
 Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
 We Could Fly Away, 
 Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
 A place in the sun, a place that's further than the stars, 
 A place where only you and I know how to get there, 
 It's not as far as Jupiter but further than Mars 
 A place where only you and I know how to get there, 
 And we can touch the sky, 
 Together we can find our way, 
 We can make it there, 
 And no one will stand in our way 
 We can even go where nobody knows, 
 Where only you and I...
