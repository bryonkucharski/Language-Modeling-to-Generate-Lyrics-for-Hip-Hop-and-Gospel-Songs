 That's how I'm gon want my girl to be. 
 Ima want my girl to respect me for who I am. 
 I want her to look real pretty you know what I'm sayin'. 
 Not Not real uh... sedity like you know what I'm sayin' 
 Not real prissy. 
 I want her to be able to ride with me for me to be able to ride with her. 
 You know, maybe if she like that I can take her out to the movies sometime, 
 Hit the Cheesecake Factory you know; 
 Have a couple of roses sent to her you know so when she get out of school 
 They'll be right there on the front porch you know.
