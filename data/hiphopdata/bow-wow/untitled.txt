West coast just crip walk-ipwalk wit me 
 East coast just Harlem shake sh- shake with me 
 Midwest just chicken head-enhead with me 
 Dirty South just b-b-bounce b-bounce with me 
 I'm B-A-C-K (oh!) (Repeat: x3) 
 Bow Bow Bow Wow 
 Me fall off? Dog you can't be serious 
 'Cause I've been doing this since I was in baby diapers 
 All my life this talent be bumpin' in my veins 
 I know these girls is happy that I'm back in the game 
 While I was gone the question was, When ya album come out? 
 Another one to go cop so y'all could scream and shout 
 Been away for a minute 
 Negotiatin' some deals 
 Discussin' some business on how I can make mils 
 Man, it feels good to know that ya fans love it 
 I've been flyin' back and forth just meetin' with Warner Bros 
 You know, sitcom's gonna be on yo TV 
 So all the Bow Wow fans could see me on GP 
 Every dog has his day so right now be mine 
 I ain't no unpolished I'm a polished diamond that shine 
 Had to retire my Mickey Mouse, I gotten too old 
 Peach fuzz on my lip, homeboy I'm grown 
 I'm that east side e-saving 614 
 Rep it girl get a playboy that flow, got that to look at 
 Be on top number one is my rank 
 I enjoy sittin' back watchin' y'all MC's sing (uhu uh) 
 You see that Z? That's me inside 
 I blow chicks minds when they see me pushin' the ride 
 I'm back and dog I ain't cuttin' no slack 
 I'm back for my homie (yeah) 
 Ya heard that? 
 Oh, you want some advice? 
 Well, without a doubt 
 Dog don't come out when Bow Wow's out 
 When I spit my rhymes be as sharp as a dart 
 Another album that's finished, shoot straight up the charts 
 Number one videos straight to 106 
 Every suburban middle American gonna be bumpin' this 
 See, I'm real don't worry 
 I got it on lock 
 When the boy wonder's around I shut down shop 
 Rapper slash actor slash 
 I cause total chaos 
 I got it in a smash 
 Homie ain't nobody hotter 
 I told you that I'm back 
 And I'm goin' back for the whole enchilada, you got it 
 Bow Bow 
 I'm B-A-C-K
