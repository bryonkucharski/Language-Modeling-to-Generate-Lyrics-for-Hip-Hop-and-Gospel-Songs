My Name is 
 B-O-W 
 This one goes out to everybody all around the world 
 Dog to dog 
 Girl to girl 
 I need y'all to help me spell my name 
 B, Bad 
 O, Outstanding 
 W, everybody know I'm the wickedest 
 Wow, that's what the girls all scream when I pop up in the screen, and 
 Proceed to get down 
 Ha ha, doggy bag 
 Everybody listenin' 
 Beats still pumpin 
 And mickey still glistenin 
 Around here we take ballin around to the next step 
 On them 22's back seat in the concept 
 I take full responsibility of infire 
 I won't stop rockin' till I retire 
 I'm so in the mix, so so sick 
 I know just what to do, that's why they so in love with the 
 B, bad 
 O, outstanding 
 W, everybody know I'm the wickedest 
 Wanna get close, so they can kick it how I'm kickin this 
 Hat to the back, pants down low 
 Gotta keep it G-H-E-T-T-O, huh 
 Uh, I been with Destiny, Jessica, Madonna 
 I'm at the tippy top, and I ain't never going under 
 1 shot nail it, now every body spell it 
 Ya chain might be thick, but mines is more thicker 
 Might know how to run. but I'm a whole lot quicker 
 Got so many ways to you, it's a shame to me 
 And ain't none of y'all out that can hang with B 
 Young, old, I don't care what you is 
 The name of your label, or the place you live 
 You betta recognize a real dyme when you see one 
 Sippin on a shirly, hollerin at your girly 
 One full pocket stay fatty 
 And I take it to the house so much they call me young Trick Daddy 
 And that's how it is when you dealing with a dog 
 I might lick you in your face, or bite your head off 
 After death I'm the under boss ain't no secret 
 Got everything lock and that's how we gonna keep it 
 Bandaned up, braided, still actin' a fool 
 Ha, still the hottest thing in high school, I'm the 
 I came through the door blazin' 
 Hotter than them California raisins 
 Back in them dayz when they was a lick 
 My money play is to hit you with the down and out 
 Look around everybody tryna go my route 
 And I don't drop no duds, I only drop burners 
 The game is mine, and I don't even gotta learn it 
 Can't drive but I can keep a party live 
 Both folks say I remind them of the Jackson 5 
 'Cause I only make hits 
 While y'all make record 
 I'm the deli as the homie with the full blown package 
 Can't leave your girl around me 
 'Cause I'm a true playa for real ask my homie JD 
 I'm the
