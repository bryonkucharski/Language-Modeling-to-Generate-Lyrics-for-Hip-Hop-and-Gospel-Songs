I've got sunshine 
 On a cloudy day. 
 When it's cold outside, 
 I've got the month of May. 
 Well, I guess you'll say 
 What can make me feel this way? 
 My girl. (My girl, my girl) 
 Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl) 
 I've got so much honey 
 The bees envy me. 
 I've got a sweeter songThan the birds in the trees. 
 Well, I guess you'll say 
 What can make me feel this way? 
 My girl. (My girl, my girl) 
 Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl) 
 Ooh, Hoo. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 I don't need no money, 
 Fortune or fame. 
 I've got all the riches, baby, 
 One man can claim. 
 Well, I guess you'll say 
 What can make me feel this way? 
 My girl. (My girl, my girl) 
 Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl) 
 Talkin' bout my girl. 
 I've got sushine on cloudy day 
 With my girl. 
 I've even got the month of MayWith my girl.
