 Ceilin so high you would think

 It's Bow Weezy Mr. Get em' wetter than a pool

 Bounce my ice where my chain be 
 All the fans be screamin like dey angry 
 Some call me cocky but how could ya blame me 
 And all da hoes like me

 Never been fake cause all the girls 
 Love official S.O.D cause 
 Girls love initials 
 I'm on another level I'm in my zone 
 Black car white rims can dey both get along 
 This is not the Matrix but I am the oricle 
 Do you wanna get wit me the 
 Question is rhetorical 
 Say the sam lines but the fans 
 Aren't bored of me, $7500 if 
 You want to order 
 Hold on let me chang my swag 
 My flow board band y'all boys dtill last 
 My whole click straight

 Last night ya girl forehead was on my abs 
 (Chorus: Soulja Boy)

 (Verse 3: Bow Wow) 
 Man I make the girls go crazy

 How many can I fit I'm my 
 Two seatter Mercedes 
 Lime-green Lambo no roof that's a droptop 
 Dey hatin' 'cause dey grilfriends on my jock 
 I let her lick da rapper 
 Let her lick da acto 
 The next Will Smith, and I be 
 Ballin like the Raptors 
 If you don't want no drama in the club 
 Then don't act up 
 How can I run out 
 My money longer than a tour bus 
 (Chorus: Bow Wow)
