You're my 
 You're my 
 You're my baby baby baby baby baby 
 You're my baby baby baby baby baby 
 Yeah yeah 
 Oh-oh 
 It was the summer 2001 
 All before the drama begun 
 When we first met 
 I seen you sitting out on your steps 
 You was broke down crying a mess 
 So I interfered 
 I asked what's the reason for tears 
 I was wishing you could tell me your fears 
 But I had to start with ya name 
 You told me how ya man playin' games 
 So I said that it was time for a change 
 And you just laughed 
 But it looked like you ain't laughed in while 
 I was glad I could give you a smile 
 Then we both blushed 
 But really girl it ain't no rush 
 I was thinking that maybe we can discuss 
 A future for us 
 Cause homeboy just got you crushed 
 You need to leave that clown in the dust 
 Trust 
 I just wanna talk 
 I'm thinking I can give you a call 
 And we can pick it up 
 Where we left off 
 I'll holla tomorrow 
 Girl I understand you loyal to ya man 
 And that's all right aww baby 
 But that don't change the fact 
 That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby 
 Girl you got to let him know 
 You can't live like this no more 
 Aww baby 
 Can't you see 
 Together you and me could be so special baby 
 Our feelings get greater 
 A million days later 
 Talking all night "please stay up" but 
 Here comes ya ex 
 Returned with that drama and stress 
 All the nonsense that you just left but yet 
 You accept and go back to try it again 
 Then return with a broken heart 
 That I gotta mend 
 That's unfair 
 I've only been your lover and friend 
 And homey there he just front and pretend 
 But you don't care 
 The life he leads is unsafe 
 I would never place my hands to your face 
 But still I chase 
 Cat and mouse 
 First you kick him out 
 Then you at his house 
 What is that about 
 I can't figure you out 
 Even your friend said I was better 
 But you listen to them never like "uh-uh whatever" 
 So the next time he hurt you again 
 You already knew where you should've been 
 And that's with me 
 Girl I understand you loyal to ya man 
 And that's all right aww baby 
 But that don't change the fact 
 That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby 
 Girl you got to let him know 
 You can't live like this no more 
 Aww baby 
 Can't you see 
 Together you and me could be so special baby 
 All the times 2way me 
 Telling me that you miss me 
 Wanting me to come over and keep you busy 
 Remember that 
 Now that you gone 
 It's been kinda hard 
 Can't think, can't sleep 
 Can't do nothing at all 
 Just tell me why you had to go back 
 See you ain't have to go through that (u ain't have to go through that) 
 My baby 
 You could've been here right by my side 
 Me and you at the park taking walks outside 
 But Instead, I keep on having these dreams 
 Waiting for my phone to ring 
 My baby 
 Wishing that it would be you 
 But I know that that wont come true 
 My baby 
 Girl I understand you loyal to ya man 
 And that's all right aww baby 
 But that don't change the fact 
 That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby 
 Girl you got to let him know 
 You can't live like this no more 
 Aww baby 
 Can't you see 
 Together you and me could be so special baby
