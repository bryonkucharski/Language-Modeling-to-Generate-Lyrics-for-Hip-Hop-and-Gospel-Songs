It's like Shad Moss's diary I've been dealin' with the Price of Fame from the beginning of this year until now 
 Even 'til this... even 'til this day 
 Every artist goes through that point 
 You know whatever happens happens umh 
 That mental break down I'm dealin' wit the Price of Fame I was like I hear that term all the time 
 But I don't think people really understand what that means.
