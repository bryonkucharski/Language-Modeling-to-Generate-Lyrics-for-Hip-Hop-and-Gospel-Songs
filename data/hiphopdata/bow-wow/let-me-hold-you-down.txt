This what you need to do girl 
 Let me hold you 
 I been watching you for a minute, come through here so sweet scented 
 In life girl you need me in it, I'm determined to win it 
 I know what you need, I know what's wrong 
 I know how to make it tight, everything will be all right 
 If ya let me hold you and introduce you to my world 
 And introduce you to the better side of life that you ain't been seeing girl 
 I'ma show you where it's at and I'ma show you how to get it 
 All you got do is be wit it and let me hold you 
 Down like a real man's supposed to I never would have approached you 
 If I ain't have intentions on doing good, see dude you wit is so fooled 
 To me girl your so cool and all I'm asking you to do is let me hold you 
 Down like a best friend and two homies in the game 
 When you cry I wanna feel your pain no secrets, no games 
 All excitement, nothing plain, keep you happy 
 That's my aim 
 And all you gotta do girl is let me hold you 
 In my arms, in my mind all the time 
 I wanna keep you right by my side till I die 
 I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right wit you 
 You can never go wrong if you let me hold you 
 Down like a real friends supposed to 
 I'm trying to show you the life 
 Of somebody like you should be living, ooh baby baby 
 You could never go wrong, if you let me hold you 
 I'ma keep you up on what's popping and shake you fresh to death 
 When we hit the mall we can ball till there's no more left 
 I know you ain't used to it but you gon' get used to it 
 'Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and just 
 All my homies think I'm tripping 'cause I got you a pad 
 See they just mad 'cause they ain't get you, they ain't get you 
 Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine 
 And I would do whatever in no time let me hold you 
 No shine, it's what your coming with but I'ma change all that 
 Rearrange that, put you in the range all black 
 With the rims to match phone attached, TV's in the back 
 How you gon' say no to that? Huh let me hold you 
 Niggas, look at me like now here you go really 'bout to blow some doe 
 But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it 
 'Cause I believe this was meant to be, I just gotta work at it 
 Like a crack attic up in rehab 
 In my arms, in my mind all the time 
 I wanna keep you right by my side till I die 
 I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right wit you 
 You can never go wrong if you, let me hold you 
 Down like a real friends supposed to 
 I'm trying to show you the life 
 Of somebody like you should be living, ooh baby baby 
 You could never go wrong if you, let me hold you
