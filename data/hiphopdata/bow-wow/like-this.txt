Ha, ha, listen, you know I do it for the ladies 
 Lambourghini Moss and uh see 
 I done had my share with the right but um 
 Look there's something about you, baby 
 Got me going crazy and that's my lady, yeah, ha, ha 
 Look, it's like this girl got me going all out 
 I got a few sick days, yeah, I'ma call out 
 Scoop shorty, hit the mall then we ball out 
 Catch a movie, grab a bite then fall out 
 I got her spoiled rotten 
 She keep her jaws droppin' 
 The latest wear she rockin' 
 Gotta couture poppin' 
 (Fresh) 
 And what's more shockin' 
 Them whores at the door knocking 
 Ain't worth a second in my g shock when 
 She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid 
 The only time we fight is on the wii boxin' 
 I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend 
 Usually I keep a safe with the key locked in 
 But she a new type, maybe a new wife, 
 Maybe the one I settle with in a new life 
 I gotta see, it's moving fast right now 
 I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow 
 'Cause ah 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like this 
 I was scared of being locked down 
 But you made me proud to call you my shorty 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like 
 It feels like I died and went to heaven 
 'Cause I never had no one love me like this 
 Like wha? Like this 
 Like wha? Like da, da, da, da, like this girl 
 I guess, I'm kinda open just sitting here hoping 
 That what we shared is more than a joke and 
 We can last like the great ones do 
 As long as our love for each other stays true 
 Look, I see the growth, we done both came a long way 
 Arguments here and there, fuss and fightin' 
 Just showing that we care can't nobody else compare 
 Start it over with another, neither one of us would dare 
 All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there 
 Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair 
 Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years 
 Try my hardest not to hurt her 
 Hate to bring her to them tears 
 And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear 
 No, I let her drive a stick, she know how to work dem gears 
 Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career 
 Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like this 
 I was scared of being locked down 
 But you made me proud to call you my shorty 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like 
 It feels like I died and went to heaven 
 'Cause I never had no one love me like this 
 She's my L O V E 
 Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny 
 You my L O V E, yeah, and when you see her 
 You see me for her, I ride or die like Ruff Ryders 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like this 
 I was scared of being locked down 
 But you made me proud to call you my shorty 
 I had a few loves before 
 But I never had no one love me quite like 
 It feels like I died and went to heaven 
 'Cause I never had no one love me like this
