If you don't wanna dance 
 I can find me somebody else that do, do 
 If you don't wanna dance 
 What you here for girl you need to move, move 
 If you don't wanna dance 
 Than it best you turn this off right now 
 'Cause I am the B-O-W-W-O-W 
 And it's about to 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 It's about to 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 Go, go, go, go (down) 
 I choose you, I choose you 
 Lil kids love me like Santa Clause 
 And I'm under 21 wit a Phantom Boss 
 Mane dressed like big 
 I called the play 
 Run, pass, shorty I can hand it off 
 You know I run wit a crew that ain't ever lost 
 We young, we rich 
 And we love to floss 
 You gotta pay the cost 
 To hear me breathe 
 Bow Wow representin that DPG 
 26 inch chrome 
 With a lake front home 
 Heavy in the hood, like straightening combs 
 I can have any girl in this world that I want 
 But I choose you, I choose you 
 Bow Wow still holdin' the top spot 
 Roll in the hot drops 
 Been in control since I came out the bow 
 And I sell like rocks in the 80's 
 Number one just like Tracy McGrady 
 This young thug 
 Can't non y'all see me, fade me 
 Keep cash money like Baby 
 I'm crazy 
 If I must say so 
 And I lust for the dough 
 Push 'em every time I bust my flow 
 I'm a blessed young man 
 And the best young man that you very heard rock befo 
 I can have any girl that in this world that I want 
 But I choose you, I choose you 
 But ugh 
 (JD) 
 Bow Wow lemme get some 
 I'm the wrong one for you to be tryin' to race wit 
 Face it dog 
 Ain't no replacement 
 I made a few mill off 
 Somethin' that I started in the basement 
 Y'all shoulda never lemme taste it 
 Back when niggas was wearin Asics 
 I ain't just do it, I aced it 
 I'm rich but I'm still tryin' to chase it 
 That's why everything I do I lace it 
 2 Bently's 
 A hundred grand for the braclet 
 To you that's a alot but to me that's basic 
 And it's so many girls out there 
 But I choose you, I choose you 
 But ugh 
 (Chorus (fade out))
