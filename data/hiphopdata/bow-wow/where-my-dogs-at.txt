 So make room next to your little backstreet poster 
 Cause Bow Wow's here and it's over; YA HEARD

 And the big body shotgun ridin' on dubs 
 I've been seen with the baddest

 And I got it lock down from the east to the west 
 Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'

 And all girls are runnin' where the love 
 Wherever the love is going down

 Now at the gates wide open 
 It is I who they runnin' from 
 Little with the ill, cross over like Iverson 
 I resentin' to kay my way and I'm the first to rock 
 First to drop, lice in the bezel of a G-shop 
 Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget

 Yeah that's me, that's got her arguing with her friends about
