I smell love in the air 
 All you missing is a cash money millionaire 
 And I know 
 You old enough to be my momma 
 I'm mature for my age 
 Tyra so that's ain't a problem 
 I got grown man paper 
 Monthly vacations 
 And you can be my girl 
 Like the temptations 
 Look them older guys can't treat you 
 Like I'll treat you 
 I'm Lamborhgini Moss baby let me two seat ya 
 I'll even put the Madden 10 away 
 All my focus is on you 
 Don't care what nobody say 
 And being with the dog 
 Tyra ain't no better place 
 Hold your hand, open doors every time we on a date 
 All you want is the respect 
 Well baby that's fair enough 
 My December boo 
 Yup she's a sagittarius 
 And all that hating from the media 
 Nope it ain't scaring us 
 And this ain't puppy love 
 I'm a pitbull terrier 
 Baby let me marry ya 
 I'll show you a better life 
 Show these old heads 
 How to really treat a woman right 
 Fell in love wit ya 
 When I saw you on the Fresh Prince 
 How can I breathe when it's no air 
 Girl I breathe less 
 No I'm Jordan Sparks 
 I'm baby got to walk 
 Don't I kinda talk 
 So I climb Jack beanstalk on her 
 Did I forget to mention 
 That your so beautiful 
 It's been that way 
 Since you went to John barrell middle school
