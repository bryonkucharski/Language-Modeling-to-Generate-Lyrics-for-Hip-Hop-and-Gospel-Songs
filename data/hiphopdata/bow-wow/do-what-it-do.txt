(Jermaine Dupri) 
 Down south let me see what ya bouncin' like 
 West coast let me see what ya crumpin' like 
 Mid West let me see what ya mono like 
 East coast let me see what ya shakin' like 
 C'mon 
 (Bow Wow) 
 (Verse One) 
 You seen my tapes, seen my shows 
 Heard my songs, you know how it goes 
 Since 87 I've been having this effect on these females 
 Power to make them stand and listen to me like a sea shell 
 I got what they want, I know how they like it 
 Got what ya need baby please don't fight it 
 You know my status, know my flow 
 You know thaty nigga that you wit, he ain't even close 
 I'm money in da bag, all I do is pop tags 
 Don't you wanna be down, with somebody that's gonna make you smile and laugh 
 Don't you wanna be down 
 I'm young, I'm fly and I got the swag, that you need in your life 
 I'm a young J.Brown, I'm super bad, guaranteed to treat you right 
 Let's ride 
 All I need is one time and I bet you go crazy 
 'Cause imma make you do what it do baby 
 No if's, no and's, no but's or maybe's 
 'Cause imma make you do what it do baby 
 Don't worry, don't trip, just hurry hurry and bring it over here baby 
 Don't worry, don't trip, just hurry 'cause imma make you do what it do baby 
 (Verse Two) 
 Ya nigga 18 now, you ain't know 
 If you touch me like you did when we was kids UH OH 
 It's on, its on, imma take ya home 
 I'm grown, I'm grown, I'll make ya moan 
 If you want it, better act like you want it 'cause the girl right beside you want your spot 
 If you know what it is, act like you know, bring your pretty self over here and drop it like its hot 
 For the Beezy weezy lil like easy, say in on the tele and do it like its for TV 
 You could win or lose, its up to you how you play it 
 You see it, I ain't gotta say it, I'm money in the bag all I do is pop tags 
 Don't you wanna be down 
 With somebody that's gonna make you smile and laugh 
 Don't you wanna be down
