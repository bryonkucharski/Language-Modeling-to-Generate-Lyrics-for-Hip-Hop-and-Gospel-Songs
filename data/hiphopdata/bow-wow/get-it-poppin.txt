One, Two One, two Bow Weezy, Swizz Beezy 
 Ladies 'n' gentlemen 
 Da ladies to da flo 
 Da fellaz to da flo 
 As we go a lil sumthin like dis 
 C'mon let's get it poppin' 
 Let's get it jumpin' 
 Let's get it poppin' 
 Let, let's get it jumpin' 
 Listen take a few minutes to mellow out 
 The names Weezy, girls I want to tell about 
 How I have 'em screamin at da top of dey lungs and 
 Let's get it poppin', let let's get it jumpin' 
 Ain't nothin' to da young dog 
 Run y'all, charts lock 
 Soon as I bark 
 I'm amongst top 
 B.Wizzle, Swizzle

 Dem boys just drizzle 
 Nop mo tryna be Like Mike 
 'Cause even Mike Jordan's two boyz want to be Like I 
 All I eva hear when da girls go by is 
 Why am I so fly

 All tha other lil homies be easy and 
 I gotta do my thang to get da cheese again

 The ease that I run through dem suck MC's 
 B.Dub like fist to gloves 
 I fit snubs and Swizz da mix it's like drugs 
 So, watch the clubs get hi-yi-yi 
 Feel like Cali when I dro by why 
 Bodies drop and all da mami's faintin 
 Watch tha candy paint change 
 Gangsta ain't it 
 Ain't since I dropped da anus 
 In da drop get acquainted 
 Wit da hottest in entertainment 
 I go by the name of Bow Weezy and 
 All da otha lil homies be eazy and 
 I gotta do my thang to get da cheese again-acapo
