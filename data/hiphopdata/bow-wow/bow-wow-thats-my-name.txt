Hair nappy but I'm happy 
 Pocket full of dough 
 From the C-O representing So So 
 The girls recognize and these niggas do too 
 I'm the flyest thing walking through jr. high school 
 So make room next to your little backstreet poster 
 Cause bow wow's here and it's over 
 Ya heard 
 I'm this 
 I'm that 
 I'm all of the above 
 And a big body shotgun riding on dubs 
 I've been seen with the baddest 
 Heard with the best 
 And I got it locked down from the east to the west 
 Look in my eyes y'all know 
 I ain't playing 
 That's why all through the streets all I'm hearing niggas saying is 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down 
 Now that the gate's wide open it is I who 
 They running from 
 Little with the ill crossover 
 Like Iverson in 2k 
 My way I'm the first to rock 
 First to drop 
 Nice and embezzled of a g-shop 
 Like Big and Pac 
 I'm hard to forget 
 What makes it even worseI'm just getting started 
 Yeah that's me 
 That's got your daughter in a frenzy 
 Yeah that's me 
 That's got her arguing with her friends 
 About who gone get me when they see me 
 Saying do you see him ooh he the man 
 13 
 Game lock 
 Don't trip 
 All that in a bag of chips 
 Hi my name is 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Woof mother***** 
 That dog game to play 
 Calgon calgon take me away 
 I'm in the dirty dirty with my nephew J 
 Dizzy izzy boy we getting bizzy 
 With little Bow wizzy 
 This s*** is off the heezy 
 I threw him like a frisbee 
 Yeah he came back 
 Like a boomerang 
 Dog pound gang 
 Hundred thousand dollar chains 
 What you say JD 
 Bling bling 
 Money ain't a thang 
 You ask me again 
 I'mma tell you the same 
 I'm flipping on these niggas 
 While I'm tripping on these niggas 
 Buck 1, Buck 2, Buck 3, Buck 4 
 You standing on a wall 
 Nigga bust a 
 But you can't trust her 
 That's good game 
 You all my niggas 
 Represent your thang 
 Put it up 
 Now click clack it up 
 And all them hoes back it up 
 'Cause I wanna smack it up 
 We do it to you doggie style 
 Big Bow Wow in your mouth 
 Bow Wow 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 Where my dogs at bark wit me now 
 Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeah 
 And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down
