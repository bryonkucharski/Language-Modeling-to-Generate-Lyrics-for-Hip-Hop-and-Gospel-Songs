I'm Looking for that 
 Pretty young thang 
 Up in the spot, looking hot playin' no games 
 And she steady tryina get it crunk right from the jump 
 And she playin' no games. 
 That you Shawty? (yeah that's me) 
 Did you come here to party? (Yes indeed) 
 Ha But could you drop it down low 
 When its time to get low 
 If so baby girl lets go. 
 (Come and get it boy) 
 They say I act old, but I got that old man game 
 'Cause I stay tryina find me a pretty young thang 
 That I call anytime if she ready to hang 
 And if sun'it jump off she be ready to bang 
 I like 'em fresh outta high school just about to graduate short shirts ed'day tryina show they little shape 
 Low cut jump jeans lugz on hea feet 
 Neighborhood girl but she love the streets 
 In a party she da main one doin' dat right thurr 
 Ev'time hea jam drop hands up in the airr. 
 And she ain't thinkin' you, she ain't thinkin' bout hea hurr 
 And if you ballin homie she don't even really curr 
 She got her mind set on what she wanna do 
 And she ain't come alone she got her whole little crew. 
 Her P.Y.T's that'll make ya head spin 
 Ery nigga in the club tryina get in

 They got a whole lot of attitude

 Stays in the sweet tryina find somthin new 
 Custom ipods with the rhinestones 
 Nextel camara phones with all the hot ringtones. 
 Light skin till black little PYT's 
 Boricua mami's that like to eat Mickey D's 
 Always into sumthin like NWA gota little bittie frame but home she don't play 
 You know a gyrl is the reason that a nigga wanna stunt 
 And I'm weak for 'em homie I ain't even gon front 
 See most young nigga's like 'em older not me spot they spot me like in the summer I run up hit them with 
 That Moss A game like "Baby wuz ya phone numba? Were ya live at? Shawdy what part of town? 'cause I just 
 Wanna be down!"
