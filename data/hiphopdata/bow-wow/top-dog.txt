They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed 
 And I'm never on the block no more 
 But I'm still the same so that's not the case 
 I'm busy getting money on tour 
 And I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 I'm the same man 
 Your boy doin' numbers, I do it for Columbus 
 I put my city on the map now go locate a compass 
 They sayin' I done changed, attitude ain't the same 
 I guess this the negative effects that money bring 
 I'm still the same Shad from Buck-town 
 Ain't nothin' changed but the label, I'm reppin' Cash Money now 
 Got love for the hood, I'm still giving back 
 And some still hate, well, boy, I'm used to that 
 Uh, and I got my mom a bigger house 
 Do it for the people, they the only ones I care about 
 Instead they make me out to be something that I'm not 
 Sayin' I only care about ho's and cash stacks 
 They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed 
 And I'm never on the block no more 
 But I'm still the same so that's not the case 
 I'm busy getting money on tour 
 And I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 I'm the same man 
 Through the recession I was helping people through the drought 
 This is for my niggas who was locked up and ain't gettin' out 
 And Bart came home, no more Fed time 
 While he was locked up I made sure that his daughter fine 
 Yeah, now that's real nigga shit 
 Got people registered to vote, now how much realer do it get? 
 And I love givin' back, puttin' smiles on kid's faces 
 Payin' off tuitions, makin' sure they get a education 
 It ain't nothin', I will never turn my back on y'all 
 We used to window-shop but now we tearin' down the mall 
 Now I'm put in a position to help and make a difference 
 I know I mess up sometimes so I ask God for forgiveness, let go 
 They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed 
 And I'm never on the block no more 
 But I'm still the same so that's not the case 
 I'm busy getting money on tour 
 And I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood 
 I'm the same man 
 Yeah, and I put that on my hood 
 Yeah, I say I put that on my 
 But y'all know I ain't changed, man
