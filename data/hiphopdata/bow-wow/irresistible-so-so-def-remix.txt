(JD) 
 Uh-huh, ha, ha 
 Sing for me 
 (Jessica) (JD) 
 You know 
 I don't know what it is 
 (It's the remix) 
 But everything about you is so irresistible 
 (Lil Bow Wow) 
 Fa' sure (So So Def) 
 It's the 2k top dawg 
 Don't nobody want it 
 I got 10K on it, I'm the hottest thing out 
 If you look at me, you're lookin' at a kid with a plan 
 If you don't understand homie, check soundscan 
 So So Def to grain 
 You know our motto 
 In the street throwin' paper like we just won the lotto 
 Guest on the beat, like dubs hit on the six 
 Irresistible to all chicks 
 Listen to the remix 
 (Jessica) (JD) 
 Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type 
 To hide what I feel inside 
 When he makes me weak with desire 
 I know that I'm supposed to make him wait 
 Let him think I like the chase 
 But I can't stop fanning the fire 
 I know I'm meant to say no 
 (Uh, uh, handclap, oh) 
 (Jessica) 
 But he's irresistible 
 Up close and personal 
 Now inescapable 
 I can hardly breathe 
 More than just physical 
 Deeper than spiritual 
 His ways are powerful 
 Irresistible to me 
 Oh I can hardly breathe, yeah 
 Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right 
 That I should really say goodnight 
 But I just can't stop myself 
 Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same 
 That I don't want to play no game 
 'Cause when I feel his arms hooked around me 
 I know I'm meant to say no (I'm meant to say no) 
 (Clap your hands) 
 (Jessica) 
 But he's irresistible 
 Up close and personal 
 Now inescapable 
 I can hardly breathe 
 More than just physical 
 Deeper than spiritual 
 His ways are powerful 
 Irresistible to me 
 Can't you see 
 Whenever he's close to me 
 I really find it hard to breathe 
 He's so irresistible 
 Think you know 
 Deeper than spiritual 
 His ways are powerful 
 He's so irresistible 
 (You're so irresistible) 
 {Like that, oh} 
 (Jessica) 
 But he's irresistible 
 Up close and personal 
 Now inescapable 
 I can hardly breathe 
 More than just physical 
 Deeper than spiritual 
 His ways are powerful 
 Irresistible to me
