Aye, aye Chris 
 Aye, man 
 You know, it's been a long time since we hooked up man 
 And did something real, you know 
 Something for 'em, for 'em ladies, you dig that? 
 Oh yeah 
 You know we hate, you know we hate, you know we hate 
 You know we do it for the ladies 
 You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out 
 You used to be the the only girl a nigga would think about 
 I got a couple girls on call, I'm goin' to bring them out 
 Imagine me seein' strip with one, so this what this is all about? 
 I'm in the club doin' my two-step, I pulled about 8 broads already 
 I'm just getting my feet wet 
 But I ain't even knocking yo style 
 'Cause I'd be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow 
 Ooh, I see you on the blogs, what you're doing and all that 
 But little do you know, you making yourself look whack 
 Your dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back 
 I'm goin' real big in V.I.P., hear that loud tack 
 See, it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here 
 Better get yo girl 'cause yo bitch is in here 
 Tryin' to see how many I can fit in my Lambo 
 I never go raw, got my strap like Rambo 
 I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone 
 So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on 
 I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind 
 Find a little shawty I like 
 And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up 
 I ain't goin' to think about you tonight 
 I ain't thinkin' about you tonight 
 We done been together for a minute 
 Now it feels funny 'cause to be doing something different 
 But it's all good, me and you finished 
 Callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin' 
 And I ain't sayin' that he don't love you 
 But I don't think he love you like I do 
 But it's okay, it's alright 
 My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women 
 Wasting time, steady tryin' to get you back 
 Get you back in my life 
 You don't care, you don't care 
 It used to be you that I like, but I'ma do what I like tonight 
 I'm gon' get tipsy 
 Over 21, all the girls have fun 
 And watch the ladies jump on me 
 I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone 
 So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on 
 I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind 
 Find a little shawty I like 
 And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up 
 I ain't goin' to think about you tonight 
 I ain't thinkin' about you tonight 
 I'm bein' honest, this is shawty, I don't want you no more 
 So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door 
 'Cause you lose it, and she chose it 
 And like Chris said, I'm chucking up the deuces 
 Onto the next one 
 All I ask is keep it real 
 Couldn't do that 
 So I'ma tell you how I feel 
 I'm poppin' bottles all night 
 'Cause that black card ain't got no limit, all right? 
 Hey 
 I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone 
 So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on 
 I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind 
 Find a little shawty I like 
 And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up 
 I ain't goin' to think about you tonight 
 I ain't thinkin' about you tonight 
 I ain't thinkin' about you tonight 
 I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
