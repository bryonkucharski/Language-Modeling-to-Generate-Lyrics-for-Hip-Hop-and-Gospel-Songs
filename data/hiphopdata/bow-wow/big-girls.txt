I'm the girl whose name be heard 
 Get a pen and pad so 
 I can write down this verse 
 Dem haters be hatin' thinkin' 
 They hatin' can cause me a curse 
 But they know if they keep it up 
 They gonna get it worse 
 I'm dat rapper that's known as 
 The teen that don't write a lick 
 And some never heard of me 
 Yes but the ones that did heard me spit 
 But some haters finna hate on me 
 So they gonna need a cross kit 
 Maybe a bandage 
 No, maybe some surgery 
 'Cause they finna have a 9 
 Through they head 
 Anyway my rapping was so good 
 I made an avalenge 
 And after I hurted dem haters 
 Let's just say they finna hop in that ambulece 
 Lie to they mommys and daddys that 
 It was all an accident on tha stage 
 They fell, oh well, boo hoo now they in a grave 
 I don't need to worry 'cause I'm tryna 
 Stack theses dollar signs like the twin tower 
 Make it taller, make it high and make it higher 
 Selling all of theses albums is 
 Just gonna make ya haters hate mo 
 'N make my pockets fatter 
 I'm a hop in my Chevy, hope dem bitches 
 Try not a still my cheese 
 Oh well, I'm not worried, I'ma lock my box with this key 
 So I'm gonna take a ride up in these streets 
 No, I'ma stop for some deeze 
 Chunk up tha duece, oh shit, dem haters stop 
 They trashed up whip in a slow creep 
 They got they 5's but I'ma be ready for them 
 I got my 9, don't got nothin' to worry 'bout 'cause 
 I'm a have dem in that hospitals bed at night 
 And after that I'm a make this cheese 
 Stacked like the twin towers 
 And I got so much witnesses 
 They thought I was Ms. Michael Myers 
 So if ya got another 
 Then I'm gone, holla back
