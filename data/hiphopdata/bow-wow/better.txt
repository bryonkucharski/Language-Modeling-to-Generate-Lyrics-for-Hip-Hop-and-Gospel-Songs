Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Yeah, T-Pain, Bow Weezy 
 T-Pain sing to em 
 Oh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do 
 (Do what it do, do what it do, do what it do) 
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you 
 (Hating on you, hating on you) 
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you 
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose 
 And you got better shit to do with your time 
 They hating on ya, because they know you bad 
 Must be doing something right, if you got these bitches mad 
 She never met her pops he left when she was five 
 Now she 19 stripping enough just to pay the bills 
 A single parent mom know it gotta be hard 
 Plus her baby daddy never seen the kid 
 She searching for love and she say that it's tough 
 Because she dances it's hard to find a man 
 And between all that she still in school 
 Using college as a back up plan 
 And like Pac said, keep ya head up 
 I know it's hard at times, you get fed up 
 But don't let up, gotta stay strong 
 But whatever you do just don't give up 
 Don't worry bout em, just do you 
 Stay focused, get on your grind 
 Just know that you can call on me 
 Whenever them niggas get out of line 
 And see a good friend is so hard to find 
 Somebody who down to ride 
 The best is yet to come for you 
 Don't let nobody steal your pride 
 Oh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do 
 (Do what it do, do what it do, do what it do) 
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you 
 (Hating on you, hating on you) 
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you 
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose (That's when they lose baby, yeah) 
 And you got better shit to do with your time 
 You done came up, that's why everybody done changed up 
 You would think you worked at Gold's gym 
 The way you done stepped your weight up 
 Got a new man and got a new life 
 She bout to become a new wife 
 Looking like a new woman 
 Feels like you been blessed twice 
 Done stopped dancing and graduated 
 All it took was a little patience 
 Never mind how you got here 
 Just know that you finally made it 
 I'm just living in it but it's your world 
 You deserve it, you worked hard, you ballin' now 
 Got a new car, no car note, 'cause it's paid off (Damn) 
 I'm proud of ya, (proud of ya) you came a long way (Yeah) 
 And if you need some inspiration 
 Just let this song play 
 Because a good friend is so hard to find 
 Somebody who down to ride 
 The best is yet, to come for you 
 Don't let nobody steal your pride 
 Oh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do 
 (Do what it do, do what it do, do what it do) 
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you 
 (Hating on you, hating on you) 
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you 
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose 
 And you got better shit to do with your time 
 Aye, let em, let em, let 'em hate
