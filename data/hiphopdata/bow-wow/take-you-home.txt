From the C O to across the seas 
 I'm guaranteed to make everybody bounce wit me 
 I been known to rip it down anyplace I be 
 You can count me, but it's only gon' be one me 
 I don't ride on cars, if the man can't rim it 
 14, I done started up a whole epidemic 
 Look, y'all know what I'm talkin' about 
 Ever since I hooked up with the homey down south 
 TV shows, magazine covers, girls in groups 
 Sayin' we goin' with each other 
 Sold out shows, pocket full of cake 
 What you know about sellin' tres mil out the gate 
 See, I'm the hottest thing around 
 (Hottest) 
 Neck full of bling bling like the Neptunes' sound 
 I got it locked from the left, right, front and rear 
 When I step up in the spot this is all y'all hear 
 I said "Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean, you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point where I just wanna take you home" 
 I said "Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean, you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point where I just wanna take you home" 
 (So so def) 
 Represent that 
 Right now how I'm old where I'm gonna be 
 How I flow, homey you can bet the house on me 
 I'm ma forever be up under the scope 
 I ain't tryna go out like Todd Bridges of 'Different Strokes' 
 See, I was born to rock, born to rhyme 
 What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time 
 Like the number 23 in the red and black 
 Mr. 106 and Park is back, Holla 
 See, I do it like no other 
 And attract more family than 'Ringling Brothers' 
 I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like, hash browns 
 See, I'm the best just ask around 
 Yo, I'm here now and ain't nobody takin' mine 
 It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can 
 You better get in a shirt and uh, makin' a sign 
 That reads, "shad moss" I'm your number one fan 
 I said "Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean, you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point where I just wanna take you home" 
 I said "Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean, you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point where I just wanna take you home" 
 (So So def)
