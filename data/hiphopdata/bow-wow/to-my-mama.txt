Yeah, this song right here is dedicated to that one special woman in my life, right 
 (Thank you for loving me) My Mother 
 (And thank you for holding me down) Theresa 
 (I know that you care for me) Rene 
 ('Cause you've always been around) Sing it 
 Ma (Thank you for loving me) This song right here is for you 
 (I wanna thank you for holding me down) All the love you showed me 
 (I know that you care for me) I'ma give it right back to you 
 Let's go 
 All of the things you do (Yeah) 
 I can never repay you (Uh huh) 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 All of the things you do (Yeah) 
 I can never repay you (Ah uh) 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 Anything you need from me, Ma, you know that it's yours 
 You're the only woman in my life that I adore 
 I remember back in the days when we couldn't get much 
 TV's wasn't covered and the floor was tore up 
 How you juggle three jobs just to take care of me 
 Yo baby boy, Bow Weezy 
 Late night shifts, daytime to the AM 
 Comin' home late, there was my best friend 
 My soulmate, yes, my big brother 
 The one who tucked me in, put me under the covers 
 When I had nightmares, you came right away 
 Read me bedtime stories and chased them away 
 My beautiful black queen, my everything 
 The one that keeps this heart pumpin' everyday 
 I'm a young man now 
 But my plan is to show you that I really understand 
 Mom, I love you 
 All of the things you do 
 I can never repay you 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 All of the things you do 
 I can never repay you 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 Look at you now, you sittin' up on top of the world 
 Got a X5 and a Benz just to swerve 
 Gotcha dream house now 
 Sittin' on big land, big money, big jewels, big game plan 
 You told me one day I'ma make it this far 
 Have God in my life and I'm gon' be the star 
 I did it, well, look where we at 
 Don't have to worry 'bout past due bills and all that 
 Don't have to worry 'bout them bill collectors all on yo back 
 Don't worry, if you ain't got it, I gotcho back 
 Don't even worry 'bout you workin 3 jobs real late 
 Don't even have to worry when you have no food to put on the plate 
 Back then, I didn't understand but I do now 
 I look back and I reminisce on how it all went down 
 Went from bad to good, from frowns to smiles 
 Mom, I really love you, understand now 
 I love you 
 All of the things you do 
 I can never repay you 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 All of the things you do 
 I can never repay you 
 I can't imagine life without you 
 My mama, my roll dog 
 Thank you for loving me 
 Say what now 
 Thank you for holding me down 
 Say what now 
 I know that you care for me 
 Sing that 
 'Cause you've always been around 
 Kick it back and 
 Thank you for loving me 
 Say what now 
 Thank you for holding me down 
 Say what now 
 I know that you care for me 
 Say what 
 'Cause you've always been around 
 Drop the beat back
