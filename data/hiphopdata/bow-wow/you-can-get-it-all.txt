 And when I think about you 
 That's the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo

 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That's the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo 
 Shawtie you can get it all 
 You can get it all 
 You can get it 
 I know you heard my reputation 
 You don't think I would ever do right by you 
 You think that if you and I was in a relationship 
 I would never be true (be true) 
 You think that anything I say is straight gang 
 And to me your just another new name 
 But what I'm tryna tell you for every man 
 There's a woman that'll make him change 
 And I believe you the one that'll make me 
 But any time I try to show you you shake me 
 I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious 
 But baby girl I am (I am) 
 And I ain't stoppin' right here, I'ma keep going 
 And I'm gonna make sure everyday tat you keep knowing 
 Weather if I have to send you flowers 
 Or talk to you on the cell-phone for few hours 
 I'm yellin' like... 
 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo 
 Baby you can get it all, 
 You can get it all 
 You can get it 
 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That's the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo 
 Shawtie you can get it all 
 You can get it all 
 (One, one, one, one) 
 One minute you act like you like me 
 And then the next you don't 
 You still sending me crazy emails 
 Like I know its just sex you want 
 I can't lie the sex is truly incredible 
 And every part of your body is so edible 
 I get tears from just thinking 'bout it 
 But that ain't the reason why I'm stuck and can't let you go 
 We got a serious serious bond 
 And when we kick it we have nothin' but fun 
 I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me 
 Even though we still young 
 Just your company ain't gota get none 
 Talk the same lingo, understand where I'm coming from 
 And if anybody ask me a question about you 
 I'ma tell 'em you the one 
 You got me like 
 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo 
 Baby you can get it all, 
 You can get it all 
 You can get it 
 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That's the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like 
 Woo-hoo 
 Shawtie you can get it all 
 You can get it all, you can get it 
 As long as you know that 
 I can have any girl I want to 
 Baby that sexual infectual 
 But still I choose you to be 
 With me and were gonna 
 So you better not break it up 
 You got me like 
 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That the first thing that come to my mind. 
 I'm like

 Woo-hoo 
 And when I think about you 
 That's the first thing that come to my mind.
