 Since day one when he came up, 
 I taught him everything and how to tear the game up,(Meeee) 
 What we went through was a shame but, 
 We back at it now, doing all the same stuff.(uh huh) 
 Being us, 
 (Bow Wow) 
 When I left I heard all the words and the lil birds in the background, 
 Saying how he gon act now? (uh huh) 
 Be stubborn lil homie couldn't back down, but I'm back now, 
 And we back around, 
 (JD) 
 Killin' all the daughters and they mama long with 'em (yeah)

 Stay with his shirt off, gang of tattoos 
 All the homies like nigga he act just like you, 
 (Bow Wow) 
 Jay and its true, I do and I ain't even gonna front, 
 Tryna hit it out the park while these other niggas bluff, 
 Roll up like a blunt, straight stuntin on these niggas 
 Like you and jay did when I was just a kid. 
 They say we talk just alike, 
 Walk just alike, 
 Same damn swagger, 
 When we Roc up on the Mic, 
 All the girls like 
 He can get it 
 All my niggas hands up 
 Lemme know that you wit it, 
 (Bow Wow) [Verse 2] 
 Come on now that Obama no drama all about the doe,(okay) 
 In with the new, (and) out with the old, 
 Stay making it, keepin' the people wantin mo', 
 And for L-I-F-E, W-E So-So, 
 (JD) 
 So cold like a winter night in Chi-Town,(yeah) 
 You Know,(yeah) you ain't hot homie pipe down,

 Stop running around, lying bout your motherfuckin life clown,

 'Cause you getting too old and slow, 
 Said he poppin' when you barely goin' gold nigga,(whoa) 
 (JD) 
 Same Lambo, Same Bent Different color, 
 More Like my lil son and just my lil brother, 
 See I had to let him go, 
 Just so he can really know, 
 You never know what you got, 
 Until its gone, 
 Welcome Home, 
 They say we talk just alike, 
 Walk just alike, 
 Same damn swagger, 
 When we Roc up on the Mic,

 More than like a dad and just a big brother, 
 We ain't always gonna agree, 
 Eye to Eye, 
 But for him I'm straight Do or Die, I... 
 (JD) 
 Couldn't of said it better 'cause I feel the same, 
 Its just somethings that ain't never suppose to change, 
 Like when Nicky Barnes switched the name of the blue magic, 
 For no reason and fucked up a good package, 
 (Bow Wow) 
 You don't get a ring, unless you got a team, 
 My niggas round you that'll hold you down, 
 Run with you around through the thick and the thin, 
 When the work ain't comin' in, 
 You know the ups and the downs, 
 That we all go through Jay, 
 (JD) 
 You See the moral of the story is, 
 We let the biz come through and separate this, 
 Dis been one of the realest and the greatest, 
 Relationships between 2 friends, 
 I'm talkin' true friends, 
 They say we talk just alike, 
 Walk just alike, 
 Same damn swagger, 
 When we Roc up on the Mic, 
 All the girls like 
 He can get it 
 All my niggas hands up 
 Lemme know that you wit it, 
 (Bow Wow talks..)
