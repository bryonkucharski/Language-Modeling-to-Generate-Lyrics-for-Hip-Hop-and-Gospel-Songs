Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl 
 No one else That means more to me in the whole world 
 No one else I would be with if I had one wish 
 No one else that could ever love you like this 
 No way I would Rather be and 
 Right here just you and me just 
 Laying 'round till lays are leaving 
 In your arms were full asleep 
 When I wake up you were try to leave 
 Trying to hold your back on your sleeve 
 But I know that you got to go so 
 Hope you know that 
 There was never that I would ever do that hurt you 
 Never leave your side, never would desert you 
 And you know I would ever be the first to 
 Tell you the truth even when it hurts to 
 Put that in reversal 
 Pray to god that you would do the same 
 For you ill walk through the rain 
 And thorugh the pain 
 Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl 
 No one else That means more to me in the whole world 
 No one else I would be with if I had one wish 
 No one else that could ever love you like this 
 Nothing I wouldn't do for you my baby girl 
 It's so beautiful never knew that you would touch 
 Me in a way that me make me wanna change the way 
 I used to do, how it used to be 
 I tell you truthfully 
 You know you only get the truth from me 
 I just want you to be happy 
 And I don't give a c that anybody loves you more than me 
 I hope you know that 
 There is no one else that ever could replace you 
 I would never take you for granted and every day I'm gratefull 
 And I will be eternally thankful 
 And on the 8th of April celebrate you 
 If you do I will be faithfull 
 I swear to God 
 Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl 
 No one else That means more to me in the whole world 
 No one else I would be with if I had one wish 
 No one else that could ever love you like this 
 (Singing girl) 
 I don't want no one else 
 Girl you are the best 
 What am I to do if I ever loose you 
 (End singing) 
 When you're gone I cry for you my baby girl 
 I would die for you 
 And I would do anything that you want me to 
 I'll take the stars out the sky for you 
 I never knew a love love love like this 
 Tell me what am I supposed to do 
 'Cause I would do anything in the world babygirl 
 If it means to be close to you 
 And you know that 'cause I show that 
 And I never hold back when it comes to my love for you 
 And it was like 
 Love on first night when we met at the hospital 
 And I ain't gonna lie so 
 I apologize 'cause I brought you in such a crazy world 
 But it's because it's I love you 
 No one has to love you 
 As my daughter as my baby girl 
 Nothing I Wouldn't do for you my baby girl 
 No one else That means more to me in the whole world 
 No one else I would be with if I had one wish 
 No one else that could ever love you like this
