(Scribe) And I hope you feel my pain 
 Hope you don't forget my name 
 For the 'cause I claim 
 Reason I came, tell me, was in all in vain 
 I walk all in chain 
 For the midnight rain I sing 
 And the man would say 
 (Stop the music playing loud and clear) 
 Instead I wanna hear 
 Oh lord that I wanna hear 
 Buts its loud and clear 
 And its deep inside my soul 
 (For dam nations near) 
 (PNC) yeah raise your hands say my name and let it rain X4 
 (Scribe) And I refuse to lose 
 No I never been a type to quit 
 I'll properly give it now 
 And just turn back around 
 And that's one of many differences 
 Because I don't care what the distance is 
 I told you ill take it all the way 
 I couldn't just walk away 
 And just pretend like I don't have more to say 
 (Stop the music playing loud and clear) 
 Instead I wanna hear 
 Oh lord that I wanna hear 
 Buts it's loud and clear 
 And its deep inside my soul 
 They can't hold me down no more they got to let me go. 
 (PNC) raise your hands say my name and let it rain X4 
 (Scribe) 'Cause I know what I got to do 
 I couldn't stop now even if I wanted to 
 They told me give it up its impossible 
 And if I bury my head in the sand like the ostriches do 
 And I'm young and I still got a lot to prove 
 Can't stop won't stop unstoppable 
 Elevated broken down all obstacles 
 Until I head a voice from other side of the room 
 Telling me to 
 (Stop the music playing loud and clear) 
 Instead I wanna hear 
 Oh lord that I wanna hear 
 Buts it's loud and clear 
 And its deep inside my soul 
 They can't hold me down no more 
 They got to let me go 
 (For dam nations near) 
 (PNC) yeah raise your hands say my name and let it rain X8
