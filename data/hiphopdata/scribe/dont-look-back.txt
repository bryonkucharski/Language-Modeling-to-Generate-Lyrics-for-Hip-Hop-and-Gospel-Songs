Back when I was 15, the year was 95 I use to dream one day I be the 
 Best rapper alive, I never went to 
 School without my walkman by my 
 Side and my tape-biggy smalls ready 
 To die. 
 I attended lewidhigh that's where I got into some mischief my dad found out he sent me to Auckland city to 
 Live with a reverend that was strict and very religious, I tried to resist it but there was nothing I could say, next thing I know my 
 Bags were packed and I was on my 
 Way begged my mum to stay I 
 Promised I would behave she told 
 Me, no you got to go and not be 
 Afraid she told me I would be ok 
 And I had to be brave knew my 
 Life from that moment would never 
 Be the same, I forced a smile in 
 Effort to mask up that pain. I said goodbye, took my seat on the back 
 Of a plane, I shed a tear and swore I wouldn't look back again. 
 ------------ 
 I won't look back I keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind. 
 And don't look back keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is now long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind.

 Meanwhile in 99 had a pad I'm 
 Writing rhymes, my girlfriend's 
 Pregnant she's about to drop at 
 Any time, I know I'm crazy young 19 with a baby-son on top of that I'm 
 Trying to contempt with my lady's 
 Mum, calls me a loser and a good 
 For nothing lazy bum, she says give up the music, that my day would 
 Never come, but I can't turn back 
 Now I got no option to fail cause 
 Mum and dad just lost a house in 
 Mortgage sale. 
 I say a solid prayer and yeah I 
 Know my god had heard me cause the 
 Next day p-money asked if I would 
 Sign it dirty next thing I know is 
 That I'm leaving to go record my CD I tell my son things will be 
 Different next time you see me, 
 Quickly change his nappy- he looks 
 Playful and happy, I got going 
 Catch my plane after the back of a 
 Taxi, as I drove away slowly I 
 Started to cry, because that moment deep inside a part of me died. 
 ------------------------- 
 I won't look back I keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind. 
 And don't look back keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is now long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind.

 Now it's been four years since 
 Crusader made its way to the top, 
 Went around the world represent NZ 
 For hip-hop now I'm touring 
 Nominations in the M2 seven home a 
 Five time platinum plaque with 
 Silver scroll, Australia went gold 
 That's 35,000 sold at 25 years old I just exceeded my goal, tell me 
 Where to from here tell me where 
 Else can I go, what can I possibly 
 Do, what don't I already know. 
 Got everything I need but still I 
 Feel something lacking in my heart 
 Don't feel content I can't get no 
 Satisfaction, my heart is full of 
 Love, hate, pain and frustrations I 
 Know my fans they got a lot of 
 Expectations, they think that I can 
 Make it, they think that I can take it, my true destiny I can not 
 Escape it but it will all be ok 
 'Cause I wasn't put here to stay, 
 But there's something things that I know before I go that I got to say 
 And its 
 ------------------------- 
 Don't look back I keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind. 
 And don't look back keep on and keep 
 Strong cause yesterday is long 
 Gone, don't look back there is a 
 Time keep in mind the human race 
 Don't get left behind.
