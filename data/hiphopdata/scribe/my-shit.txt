Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this, 
 Take some words that I wrote, 
 Put it down in a flow, 
 Make it sound dope like this, 
 It's my shit, 
 That's why it sounds like, 
 Like, like,.. like this. 
 Yo, If you see me up in the club, I be V.I.P., 
 On the low, sipping that X.O.V, S.O.P, 
 Got Ty-Ty and Ladi-6 on the left of me, We, 
 Tear the floor up all night like we was high on ecstasy, I, 
 See emcees try to pep my recipe for success, 
 Try to copy me, the way I rap, way I dress, 
 Damn, I'm not impressed, 
 Know you wanna be live, 
 Wearing your hat to the side, 
 You look like you wanna be Scribe. 
 Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this, 
 Take some words that I wrote, 
 Put it down in a flow, 
 Make it sound dope like this, 
 It's my shit, 
 That's why it sounds like, 
 Like, like,.. like this. 
 Yo I listen to my shit, 
 Everywhere that I go, 
 From my house to my car, 
 On the way to my show, 
 Just to spit my shit, 
 My shit get you high quick, 
 Switch it up, flip it up, my shit, 
 Pick it up, slow it down, like this, 
 My shit is so courageous, 
 Everyday with the flow my shit is so tenacious, 
 My shit is what we ride to, 
 What we get high to, 
 When I'm with my crew, 
 Y'all know how I... do. 
 Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this, 
 Take some words that I wrote, 
 Put it down in a flow, 
 Make it sound dope like this, 
 It's my shit, 
 That's why it sounds like, 
 Like, like,.. like this. 
 Yeah, My shit is blowing up, 
 Both hands, throw 'em up, 
 Put it in the air, 
 Say yeah we ain't slowing, no, 
 I ain't stoppin' now, 
 My shit is poppin' now, 
 Industry, lock it down, 
 It's that chocolate brown, 
 Dude from the antipades (?), 
 Skills like good, 
 Australia lovin' my shit like them hilltop hoods, 
 When I roll through the city from, 
 Melbourne to Sydney from, 
 Adelaide to Perth, 
 Got the Gold Coast with me, 
 I get busy down in Brizzy, 
 They see me, they on the d-low, 
 They lovin' my songs, 
 From Wollingong up to fre-o, 
 Hey yo, my shit's so dope I could say nothin' on a track like sshhhh. 
 (Listen,.. You get me.) 
 Ain't nobody else in the world that can flow like this, 
 Take some words that I wrote, 
 Put it down in a flow, 
 Make it sound dope like this, 
 It's my shit, 
 That's why it sounds like, 
 Like, like,.. like this.
