I started with an eighth, alright (alright) 
 And then I went and changed my life (my life) 
 I might take out the Wraith tonight (tonight) 
 Put your arms around me, baby 
 I just want to fly, make it last before we die 
 And I know you want a ride 
 What's on your mind? What's on your mind? 
 And my '92 got doors like my Lambo 
 Spend my last paycheck on some ammo 
 We don't follow trends, rest in peace to Yamo 
 Your new shit sucks, I feel like Anthony Fantano 
 Sayin' I was broke last year, I can't go back there 
 Nicotine fiend, couldn't even buy a pack, yeah 
 She don't know my music, told her I ain't mad, yeah 
 Let her cut that coco on my platinum plaque, yeah (wow) 
 Cut my fingers on my bands, oh yeah 
 Cut my locker with some Xan, oh yeah 
 Count me my guala in advance, oh yeah 
 Backstreet diamonds, watch them dance on ya, yeah 
 I started with an eighth, alright (alright) 
 And then I went and changed my life (my life) 
 I might take out the Wraith tonight (tonight) 
 Put your arms around me, baby 
 I just want to fly, make it last before we die 
 And I know you want a ride 
 What's on your mind? What's on your mind? 
 She don't want to spend all my dough 
 She gets paid to be a model 
 I take the lead, they just follow 
 Face it, you don't know what I know 
 Pull up, I got some' for ya 
 Somethin' in my trunk for ya 
 But I got a good lawyer 
 They always try to come for ya 
 I'ma pull up in that Bentley with the fuckin' windows tinted 
 Dependin' how I'm feelin', take a drop of the extended 
 Think I'm showin' signs of slowin', homie, just forget it 
 I guess this what happens when you fuckin' handle business, yeah 
 I started with an eighth, alright (alright) 
 And then I went and changed my life (my life) 
 I might take out the Wraith tonight (tonight) 
 Put your arms around me, baby 
 I just want to fly, make it last before we die 
 And I know you want a ride 
 What's on your mind? What's on your mind? 
 I was broke last year, I can't go back there 
 I was broke last year, I can't go back there 
 Got some lean and I went a little mad yeah 
 Try to take the swagger, I know it for a fact 
 I'ma pull up in that Bentley with the fuckin' windows tinted 
 Dependin' how I'm feelin', take a drop of the extended 
 Think I'm showin' signs of slowin', homie, just forget it 
 I guess this what happens when you fuckin' handle business, yeah
