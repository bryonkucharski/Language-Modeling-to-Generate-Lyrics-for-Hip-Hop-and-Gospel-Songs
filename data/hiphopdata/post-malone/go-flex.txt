Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke 
 They tell me to quit, don't listen to what I'm told 
 Help me forget that this world is so cold 
 I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more 
 Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on 
 It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt 
 I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha 
 In the cut and I put that on my momma 
 And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama 
 I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up 
 It's either the pussy or the commas 
 Man I just wanna go flex 
 Gold on my teeth and on my neck 
 And I'm stone cold with the flex 
 With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check 
 Man I just wanna go flex 
 Gold on my teeth and on my neck 
 And I'm stone cold with the flex 
 With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check 
 Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed 
 She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me 
 She got a man but says she really like me 
 She doin' things to excite me 
 She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks 
 Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next 
 I hit my plug up, got the paper connect 
 I drop a couple bands I just wanna go... 
 Man I just wanna go flex 
 Gold on my teeth and on my neck 
 And I'm stone cold with the flex 
 With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
