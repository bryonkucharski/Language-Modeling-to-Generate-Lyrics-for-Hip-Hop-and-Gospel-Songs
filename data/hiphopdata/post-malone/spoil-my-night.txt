I don't have much to say, I'll be out front 
 Won't you come spoil my night? 
 Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 Spoil my night (my night) 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 My necklace had a natural glow 
 She dancin' in the strobe 
 Let's fuckin' spoil my night (spoil my night) 
 Spent so much cash, I lost her 
 My cup was too toxic 
 I took her robe off (yeah) 
 I couldn't get her off me 
 Dropped plenty money on her thighs 
 There's plenty room in my ride 
 I've never been like a small fry 
 She took me in, that's on my life 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 Spoil my night (my night) 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 I don't have much to say, I'll be out front 
 Won't you come spoil my night? (spoil my night) 
 Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time 
 Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me 
 Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (ooh) 
 Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me) 
 I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (wow) 
 And she see those diamonds in my teeth (in my teeth) 
 I see her smilin' back at me (back at me) 
 I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji) 
 It's about time, Postmate Plan B 
 Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (and I know) 
 Damn, how many videos you gon' post? 
 Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know 
 My girl at home now my line about to blow (yeah) 
 I know what I'm doin' ain't right 
 But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 Spoil my night (my night) 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 I don't have much to say, I'll be out front 
 Won't you come spoil my night? (spoil my night) 
 Feeling's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time (yeah) 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night 
 Spoil my night, spoil my night
