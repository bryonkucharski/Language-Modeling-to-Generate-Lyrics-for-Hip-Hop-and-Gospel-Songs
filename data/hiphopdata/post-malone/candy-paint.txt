Yeah, yeah, mmm 
 Candy paint with the white on top 
 Lambo doors are the ooh-op drop 
 If you busy plotting on what I got 
 Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thought 
 Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
 Half price my whip, same price my watch 
 Got no jumper but I ball a lot 
 Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want 
 Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt) 
 Lambo doors are the ooh-op drop (drop) 
 If you busy plotting on what I got 
 Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thought (pop) 
 Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
 Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling) 
 Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish) 
 Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want 
 Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yuh) 
 Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot" 
 Goddamn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah) 
 I can do things that your man cannot (yeah) 
 Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot) 
 Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped) 
 Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked) 
 I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers 
 How you comprehend what you ain't understanding? 
 Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish 
 Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor 
 Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle 
 Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn) 
 Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza) 
 Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for 
 But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (aye)

 I've been rolling twenty ash, hit the road (wooh) 
 Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn) 
 We already know you vanished though (ooh) 
 Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh 
 All these motherfuckers so false with me (yah) 
 If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah) 
 I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no) 
 Take a second if you think about crossing me 
 It lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn) 
 Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza) 
 Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)
