Ooh I fall apart 
 Ooh yeah... 
 She told me that I'm not enough, yeah 
 And she left me with a broken heart, yeah 
 She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah 
 She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah 
 Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah 
 And now I'm takin' these shots like it's novacane, yeah 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, didn't know it before 
 Surprised when you caught me off guard 
 Hard as damn jewelry I bought 
 You was my shorty, I thought 
 Never caught a feelin' this hard 
 Harder than the liquor I pour 
 Tell me you don't want me no more 
 But I can't let go 
 Everybody told me so 
 Feelin' like I sold my soul 
 Devil in the form of a whore 
 Devil in the form of a whore 
 You said it 
 No you said it 
 No you said it 
 We'd be together 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, didn't know it before 
 Surprised when you caught me off guard 
 Hard as damn jewelry I bought 
 You was my shorty, I thought 
 Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin' 
 Try to brush it off but it keep on goin' 
 Covered in scars and I can't help showin' 
 Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin' 
 Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin' 
 Try to brush it off but it keep on goin' 
 All these scars, can't help showin' 
 Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, I fall apart 
 Down to my core 
 Ooh, didn't know it before 
 Surprised when you caught me off guard 
 Hard as damn jewelry I bought 
 You was my shorty, I thought
