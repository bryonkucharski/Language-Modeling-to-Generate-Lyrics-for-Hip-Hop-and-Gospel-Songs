It's true that all that you know is all that you are 
 You said that it's all that you want and more 
 Fuck off and pour another drink 
 And tell me what you think 
 You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now 
 You put your cigarette out on my face 
 So beautiful, please, woman 
 Don't break your back for me 
 I'll put you out of your misery 
 Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) 
 I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) 
 Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went 
 I'm here, but don't count on me to- 
 Stay a little longer if you convince me 
 And tell me all the things that you have against me 
 Every time we make up, the truth is fadin' 
 Everybody's blind when the view's amazin' 
 Damn, who are we right now? 
 Can we have a little conversation? 
 Figure it out with no intoxication 
 We carry on, what is our motivation? 
 We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it? 
 Maybe we're used to this 
 Tell me, what are we to do? 
 It's like we only play to lose 
 Chasin' pain with an excuse 
 I love that shit and so do you 
 But don't break your back for me 
 I'll put you out of your misery 
 Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) 
 I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) 
 Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went 
 I'm here, but don't count on me to stay 
 Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) 
 I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) 
 Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went 
 I'm here, but don't count on me to stay
