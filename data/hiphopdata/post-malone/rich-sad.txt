Hundred thousand for the chain and now my drop (drop, drop) 
 When I pull out the garage, I chop my top (top, top) 
 Just like a fiend, when I start I cannot stop (wow) 
 I got, I got hella guap, look at me now (at me now) 
 Ooh, covered in carats, ooh, mahogany cabinets 
 Ooh, I ball like the Mavericks, ooh, stable and stallions 
 Ooh, massive medallions, ooh, I finally had it 
 Ooh, but then you just vanished, damn, I thought I was savage 
 All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul (-oul) 
 Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone (-one) 
 Ay, I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay 
 You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ay 
 You know I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay 
 Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ay, ay 
 Buy me, love, try to buy me, love 
 Now I'm alone, Ice Box, Omarion (ooh) 
 Plenty sluts grabbin' on my nuts (whoa) 
 Might have fucked, it was only lust (trust) 
 I was livin' life, how could I have known? (could have known) 
 Couldn't listen to advise 'cause I'm never wrong (oh) 
 In the spotlight, but I'm on my own (oh) 
 Now they're all gone (now they're all gone) 
 All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul (-oul) 
 Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone (-one) 
 Ay, I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay 
 You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ay 
 You know I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay 
 Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ay, ay 
 I don't even wanna go home 
 In a big house all alone (alone) 
 I don't even wanna go home (no, no, no) 
 But I'ma try to call you on the phone 
 Brrt 
 I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay 
 You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ay 
 You know I would throw it all away 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) 
 Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways (separate ways) 
 I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ay, ay
