Ay, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies 
 Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
 Ay, ay, all my brothers got that gas 
 And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
 Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi 
 And show up, man them the shottas 
 When my homies pull up on your block 
 They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow) 
 Ay, ay, switch my whip, came back in black 
 I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" 
 Ay, close that door, we blowin' smoke 
 She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
 Ay, act a fool on stage 
 Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
 Ay, shit was legendary 
 Threw a TV out the window of the Montage 
 Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn 
 Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in 
 Sayin', "I'm with the band" 
 Ay, ay, now she actin' outta pocket 
 Tryna grab up on my pants 
 Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man 
 And they all brought a friend 
 Yeah, ay 
 Ay, ay, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies 
 Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
 Ay, ay, all my brothers got that gas 
 And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
 Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi 
 And show up, man them the shottas 
 When my homies pull up on your block 
 They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow) 
 I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars 
 Feelin' like a popstar (twenty one, twenty one, twenty one) 
 Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool 
 And they ain't got on no bra 
 Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks 
 And now she screamin' out, "no más" (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 They like "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage 
 And you only got six cars?" (twenty one) 
 I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?) 
 Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack) 
 Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks) 
 L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (twenty one, twenty one) 
 Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car 
 Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard 
 I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard 
 Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar 
 Ay, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies 
 Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
 Ay, ay, all my brothers got that gas 
 And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi 
 And show up, man them the shottas 
 When my homies pull up on your block 
 They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta
