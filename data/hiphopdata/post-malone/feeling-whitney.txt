And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit 
 I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring 
 And I have seen a lot of days since, well that's not important 
 It's been long 
 And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies zipped to Houston 
 Cars and clothes thought I was winning, you knew I was losing 
 You told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done 
 To each their own and found peace in knowing 
 Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping 
 Show no emotion, against the cold 
 And just act as hard as you can 
 You don't need a friend, boy you're the man 
 And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from 
 It seems like every plug we needs to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on 
 So what, ugh 
 I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it 
 I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune and 
 Lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance 
 Drank more 
 To each their own and found peace in knowing 
 Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping 
 Show no emotion, against the cold 
 And just act as hard as you can 
 You don't need a friend, boy you're the man
