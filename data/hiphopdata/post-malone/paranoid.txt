Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life 
 I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night 
 In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights 
 God damn, they right behind me 
 And I wake up everyday 
 I wake up every day 
 With this anxiety 
 And they know where I stay 
 Come alone on my place 
 And they followin' me 
 Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen 
 A little more up in the walls and the ceilin' 
 Even family and friends started switchin' 
 Ever since I got that check, seen a mission 
 Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you, yeah 
 More people wanna be, you don't trust no one 
 Tell me why I can get no relief 
 Wonderin' when they'll come for me 
 A paranoid man makes paranoid plans 
 I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands 
 Strugglin' just to find my peace 
 Sometimes feel like I got no friends 
 Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden 
 Right by the bed, keep it loaded 
 Lord have mercy if they broke in 
 I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake 
 If you try to pull up to my place 
 Beam is gonna hit you a mile away 
 I promise, one of us gonna die today 
 Helicopters in the sky 
 No, he can't escape the eyes 
 Politicians and the lies 
 Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides? 
 Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep) 
 Wonderin' when they'll come for me 
 A paranoid man makes paranoid plans 
 I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands 
 Strugglin' just to find my peace 
 Ay, mind is runnin' all day 
 Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah 
 Minute after minute, never had a limit 
 Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it 
 Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it 
 Either way, I know they'll come for me again 
 Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep) 
 Wonderin' when they'll come for me 
 A paranoid man makes paranoid plans 
 I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands 
 Strugglin' just to find my peace
