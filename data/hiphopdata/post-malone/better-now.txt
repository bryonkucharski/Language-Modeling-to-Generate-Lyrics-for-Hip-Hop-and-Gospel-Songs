You probably think that you are better now, better now 
 You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 You know I say that I am better now, better now 
 I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 I did not believe that it would end, no 
 Everything came second to the Benzo 
 You're not even speakin' to my friends, no 
 You knew all my uncles and my aunts though 
 Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes 
 We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives 
 Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside 
 Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like 
 And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' 
 With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas 
 Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget 
 But I can't get this shit outta my head 
 You probably think that you are better now, better now 
 You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 You know I say that I am better now, better now 
 I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 I seen you with your other dude 
 He seemed like he was pretty cool 
 I was so broken over you 
 Life it goes on, what can you do? 
 I just wonder what it's gonna take 
 Another foreign or a bigger chain 
 Because no matter how my life has changed 
 I keep on looking back on better days 
 You probably think that you are better now, better now 
 You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 You know I say that I am better now, better now 
 I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 Oh-oh 
 I promise 
 I swear to you, I'll be okay 
 You're only the love of my life 
 You probably think that you are better now, better now 
 You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 You know I say that I am better now, better now 
 I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around 
 You know I never meant to let you down, let you down 
 Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything 
 Oh-oh
