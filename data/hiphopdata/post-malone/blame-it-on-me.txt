I used to say I was free 
 Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me 
 They take away everything, had everything that I needed 
 They held me down, let me drown 
 They spit me out, right through the teeth 
 I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again 
 It was a breeze for you 
 These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy 
 Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain 
 Watchin' me bleed 
 You cut me down on my knees 
 No matter what you believe 
 I think we both can agree 
 That you can't blame it on me, yeah 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 Blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 I couldn't breathe 
 Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all 
 You can't blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 Everyday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go 
 As I scrape away through the impossible 
 Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show 
 Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though 
 Now I see dead people, most have no faith 
 Where did the time go? A watch with no face 
 They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space 
 I took my chances so won't you 
 Blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 Blame it on me, ay 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 I couldn't breathe 
 Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all 
 You can't blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault 
 It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes 
 It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah 
 It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul 
 It's all my fault 
 Watchin' me bleed 
 You cut me down on my knees 
 No matter what you believe 
 I think we both can agree 
 That you can't blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 Blame it on me 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 I couldn't breathe 
 Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all 
 You can't blame it on me, ay 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault 
 Blame it on me, yeah 
 It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
