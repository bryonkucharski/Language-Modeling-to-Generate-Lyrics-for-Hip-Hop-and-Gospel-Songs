Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael 
 Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you 
 My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload 
 Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos 
 My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael 
 Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you 
 My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload 
 Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though 
 You stuck in the friend zone, I tell her four, five, the fifth, ay 
 Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ay 
 Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ay 
 Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ay 
 I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ay 
 30 for a walkthrough, man, we had every slit, ay 
 Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip 
 Out the window of the Benzo, we get sin in the rent' 
 And I'm like "whoa" 
 Man, my neck so goddamn cold 
 Diamonds weigh my teeth so, so low 
 I got homies, let it blow, oh 
 My money thick, won't ever fold 
 She said, "Can I have some to hold?" 
 And I can never tell you no 
 Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael 
 Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you 
 My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload 
 Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos 
 My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael 
 Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you 
 My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload 
 Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though 
 The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy 
 We're hittin' lil' mamas, she wanna have my babies 
 Sippy on the Panky, chain so stanky 
 You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch 
 Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top 
 Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top 
 Just one switch, I can make the ass drop 
 Eh, take you to the smoke shop 
 We gon' get high, ay, we gon' hit Rodeo 
 Dolla Valentino, we gon' hit Pico 
 Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums 
 This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright 
 Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though 
 All VVSs, put you in a necklace 
 Girl, you look beautiful tonight 
 Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry 
 Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
