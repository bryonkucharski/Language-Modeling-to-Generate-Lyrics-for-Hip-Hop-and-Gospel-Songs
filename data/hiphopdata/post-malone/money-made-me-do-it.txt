Diamonds in my chain gold 
 Every 20 minutes change clothes 
 I had a mil before the label 
 Just as long as they know, money made me do it 
 I said rest in peace to Bankroll 
 You in a better place dog 
 You won't ever see me lay low 
 Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 Take a ride when we wake up 
 Hit the gas melt your face off 
 Spend the day counting cake up 
 With a dime who think I changed up 
 I took the Lincoln down Rodeo 
 Ran through it like some Drain-o 
 Lots of bags can't complain though 
 We was shopping until they closed 
 Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh yeah 
 New whip now I can pay my rent, ooh yeah 
 Diamonds in my chain gold 
 Every 20 minutes change clothes 
 I had a mil before the label 
 Just as long as they know, money made me do it 
 I said rest in peace to Bankroll 
 You in a better place dog 
 You won't ever see me lay low 
 Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 Got a bandana round my neck 
 Like Bankroll Fresh 
 Pocket full of street money 
 Bout to count my blessing 
 One hundred, one thousand 
 100K, one million 
 We smoke, we lay up, we rap 
 We talked about a vision (switch it up) 
 I got diamonds like a rainbow, every time I change clothes 
 Shawty fucked my friend but I act like I ain't know 
 I'ma buy a rain coat, the storm might approach you 
 Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus 
 I do on purpose, do it for the neighborhood 
 Smoking on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it 
 Got that leather and that wood, got the marble on the floor 
 Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando 
 Diamonds in my chain gold 
 Every 20 minutes change clothes 
 I had a mil before the label 
 Just as long as they know, money made me do it 
 I said rest in peace to Bankroll 
 You in a better place dog 
 You won't ever see me lay low 
 Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it 
 I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
