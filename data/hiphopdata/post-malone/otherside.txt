I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take 
 Take me right to you 
 One hundred bottles of the good shit, couldn't even bring you back 
 What am I to do? 
 Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth 
 One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I was puttin' on for you like a jersey 
 What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me 
 Never thought you were gonna do me dirty 
 Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin' 
 But that's just the way it goes 
 Wish that I could have control 
 Everybody dies alone 
 (And I ain't dead yet) 
 Save my breath, but I lost faith a long time ago 
 Dream nightmares 
 I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
 I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name 
 Are you on the other side? Will you save us? 
 Or will you run away? 
 I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take 
 Take me right to you (take me right to you) 
 One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back 
 What am I to do? (What am I to do?) 
 You're my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself of the ugly truth (what an ungly truth) 
 We're no strangers to the flame 
 We will never be the same if we make it through (and we can make it through) 
 My back is up against the wall 
 But I used to feel invincible 
 Yeah, it was us against the world 
 But somehow, someway, the take was comin' 
 I remember back then 
 Played my cards right you were my best hand 
 Still you keep me guessin' 
 Wonder if I'll ever get the message 
 Save my breath, but I lost faith a long time ago 
 Dream nightmares 
 I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
 I don't even wanna know why you don't answer when I call your name 
 Are you on the other side? Will you save us? 
 Or will you run away? 
 Are you on the other side? Will you save us? 
 Or will you run away?
