 She talkin' that noise, take her lovin' with the dawn, always talkin' on the phone 
 After we fuck in the morn' she wake up, she wearin' my clothes 
 She always be callin' my phone 
 She always be stealin' my clothes, yeah 
 Askin' me how does it feel when you know you could buy it at the store, yeah 
 Yeah, I'm bringin' that down to the floor

 Four days a hundred thousand 
 Forever like a diamond

 We can go half on a jet, baby we on to the next 
 Fuck all the stress 
 Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet 
 I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
