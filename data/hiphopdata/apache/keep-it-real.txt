And you don't stop 
 Rappers grow, develop flows, do shows, get hoes 
 Make it big, then start steppin' on toes 
 But you missed one, mine, now you can't last 
 Step on my toe, you get ten toes up that ass 
 Don't even think about tryin' some snake shit 
 Okay, today we're talkin' about fake shit 
 Was it a friend or colleague, tell me what was it? 
 You flipped your script when you got your bullshit budget 
 You went gold and can't speak no more 
 Fuck you, your crew, and your fuckin' tour 
 Poppin' shit behind my back, time to get got 
 The penalty for that is five to ten speed-knots 
 I'm here to bully and bogart, I hit hard 
 Set 'em up to get wet up, dump 'em in somebody's yard 
 Tie 'em up and make 'em squeel 
 The last three words he hears is 'keep it real' 
 Keep it real 
 And you don't stop 
 (And I'ma let you know) 
 Keep it real 
 (Probably a punk) 
 Industry rule number 4080-one 
 (If you come to battle, bring-bring a shot-shotgun) 
 I hate the fake, if you perpatrate, flee 
 Time to wreck shop, and all you can do is stop speakin' to me 
 MC's that get too big for their britches 
 End up in stitches or gettin' robbed for their fuckin' riches 
 Forgot where you came from, gased up 
 Go back to your old block and niggas smack that ass up 
 You know the rules, challenge him to a rap scrimmage 
 She said (Yo, 'Pache chill, that's just his image 
 And shit) So I chill and won't say shit, see 
 No bull, I got pull, only a handful can fuck with me 
 Bringin' mysery is my mission in '93 
 So be nice and think twice before steppin' to me 
 Tie him up and make him squeel 
 The last three words he hears is 'keep it real' 
 Some new fame is like a flame, let me explain 
 It can blaze for days, then it's out, but who's to blame? 
 You, or is it the things you do or did? 
 In fact, sometimes I think back to when I was a kid 
 Times were hard, I got harder 
 Couldn't afford a 40, so you didn't want to be bothered 
 Wouldn't pass a spliff, couldn't get a lift 
 Started runnin' with the Flavor you and got swift 
 Now you come around talkin' that 'we boys' shit 
 The way I live, I forgive, but I don't forget 
 Tie him up and make him squeel 
 The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'
