Ask around about her 
 She don't get emotional 
 Kill off all her feelings 
 That's why she ain't approachable 
 She know her pussy got a fanbase 
 A couple niggas with a suitcase 
 Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay 
 When it comes to money she play no games 
 She lick it up just like a candy 
 She wanna make them leave their family 
 She trying to live a life so fancy 
 She wanna pull up in a Bentley 
 She ain't got time for lovin' 
 Louis Vuitton her husband 
 She rather die in lusting 
 She rather die in the club, till she 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 You know how she get down, pop her for a check now 
 Six feet under, six 
 Six feet under 
 Six feet under, six 
 Six feet under 
 Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper 
 Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around 
 She don't depend on anybody 
 Know just what to do with her own body 
 Counting all that money like a hobby 
 She don't give a fuck about nobody 
 And she got her whole crew poppin' 
 And she bend it over like she got no back bone 
 Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone 
 She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it 
 She lick it up just like a candy 
 She wanna make them leave their family 
 She trying to live a life so fancy 
 She wanna pull up in a Bentley 
 She ain't got time for lovin' 
 Louis Vuitton her husband 
 She rather die in lusting 
 She rather die in the club, till she 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper 
 You know how she get down, pop her for a check now 
 Six feet under, six 
 Six feet under 
 Six feet under, six 
 Six feet under 
 Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper 
 Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around 
 Gonna turn that ass around 
 Oh murder, oh murder 
 Gonna turn that ass around 
 Oh murder, oh murder 
 Real love's hard to find 
 So she don't waste her time 
 So she don't waste her time, ooh 
 You ain't gon' catch her crying 
 She ain't gon' lose her mind 
 She ain't gon' lose her mind 
 Till she... 
 Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (Till she) 
 Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (Till she) 
 Six feet under she gon' kill me for the paper 
 Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around
