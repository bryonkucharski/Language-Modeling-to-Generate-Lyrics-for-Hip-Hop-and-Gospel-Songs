They all feel the same 
 Adjust to the fame 
 Cause no one will love you like her 
 It's pointless 
 Like tears in the rain 
 So now that she's gone 
 Embrace all that come 
 And die with a smile 
 Don't show the world how alone you've become 
 They all feel the same 
 Adjust to the fame 
 Cause no one will love you like her 
 It's pointless 
 Like tears in the rain 
 So now that she's gone 
 Embrace all that come 
 And die with a smile 
 Don't show the world how alone you've become 
 When it's said and done 
 I already felt love 
 And I let it end up 
 Dying by itself 
 And when it's said and done 
 You were better off 
 You deserve real love 
 And I deserve to be by myself 
 'Cause I've gone too far 
 And I started too young 
 To give up 
 And even if I changed 
 It would be too late 
 I exposed my ways 
 Now every girl I touch 
 They all feel the same 
 Adjust to the fame 
 Cause no one will love you like her 
 It's pointless 
 Like tears in the rain 
 So now that she's gone 
 Embrace all that come 
 And die with a smile 
 Don't show the world how alone you've become 
 They all feel the same 
 I should've let you leave 
 But, I let you watch me slip away 
 I could've set you free 
 But, I'm selfish 
 I watched you stay 
 She has no recollection 
 Of the life she had without me 
 She let it slip away, away, away 
 It's so sad it had to be this 
 She forgot the good things about me 
 She let it slip away, away, away 
 She has no recollection 
 Of the life she had without me 
 She let it slip away, away, away 
 It's so sad it had to be this 
 She forgot the good things about me 
 She let it slip away, away, away 
 They all feel the same 
 Adjust to the fame 
 Cause no one will love you like her 
 It's pointless 
 Like tears in the rain 
 So now that she's gone 
 Embrace all that come 
 And die with a smile 
 Don't show the world how alone you've become 
 They all feel the same 
 Adjust to the fame 
 Cause no one will love you like her 
 It's pointless 
 Like tears in the rain 
 So now that she's gone 
 Embrace all that come 
 And die with a smile 
 Don't show the world how alone you've become 
 She has no recollection 
 Of the life she had without me 
 She let it slip away, away, away 
 It's so sad it had to be this 
 She forgot the good things about me 
 She let it slip away, away, away
