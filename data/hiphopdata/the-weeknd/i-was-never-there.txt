What makes a grown man wanna cry? 
 (Cry, cry, cry, cry) 
 What makes him wanna take his life? 
 (Yeah) 
 His happiness is never real 
 (Real, real, real, real) 
 And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he feels 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter (it don't matter) 
 It won't matter (matter) 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time, babe) 
 It won't matter (it won't matter, babe) 
 It won't matter (ya) 
 It was like I was never there 
 (It was like I was never there) 
 It was like it was more than thin air, oh 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh baby 
 It won't matter, it won't matter, baby 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 It was like I was never there 
 It was like it was more than thin air 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 Ooh, now I know what love is 
 And I know it ain't you for sure 
 You'd rather something toxic 
 So, I poison myself again, again 
 'Til I feel nothing 
 In my soul (in my soul) 
 I'm on the edge of something breaking 
 I feel my mind is slowly fadin' 
 If I keep going, I won't make it 
 If I keep going, I won't make it 
 And it's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 Woah, woah 
 Don't you, baby, hey 
 It won't matter, baby 
 Don't you know? 
 Don't you know? 
 Ooh, no
