I know what you did 
 I know 
 So I'mma let you taste her 
 I ain't washing my sins 
 I ain't washing my sins 
 Now we're lying about the nights 
 Hiding it all behind the smiles 
 Take a look at what you did 
 You probably thought that you'd break my heart 
 You probably thought that you'd make me cry 
 But baby it's okay 
 I swear it's okay 
 'Cause I know everything 
 I know everything 
 I know everything 
 I know everything 
 Now these tongues don't twist like they did before 
 It's hard to keep me up 
 And you are dry 
 But baby it don't hurt 
 Oh, like you thought it would 
 The more of you the merrier 
 Now we're lying about the nights 
 Hiding it all behind the smiles 
 Take a look at what you did 
 You probably thought that you'd break my heart 
 You probably thought that you'd make me cry 
 But baby it's okay 
 It's okay 
 I know everything, yeah 
 I know everything 
 I know everything 
 I know everything
