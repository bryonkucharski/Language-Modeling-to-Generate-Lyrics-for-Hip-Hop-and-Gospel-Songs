This house is not a home to you 
 But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down 
 There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference 
 'Cause I see you're here to stay 
 Should've have known I picked my fate 
 I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong 
 (To let you in my) 
 To let you in my home 
 (Now you know where I sleep) 
 Now you know where I sleep 
 (Never felt so damn weak) 
 Hey there lonely girl 
 Did you have to tell your friends 
 About the way I got you screaming my name 
 Did you have to tell the world 
 Now your girls all wanna fuck 
 Girl you could've been the one 
 Now gotta change my number twice a month 
 When you could have simply kept it on the down low 
 Baby if I knew you'd be living in my sheets 
 I wouldn't have shown you any love 
 I would have left you in the club 
 You said you don't belong 
 You keep saying there's no one 
 And there's no where to go 
 But who keeps calling on your phone? 
 I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong 
 Girl if your man calls your phone again 
 Girl if your man calls your phone again
