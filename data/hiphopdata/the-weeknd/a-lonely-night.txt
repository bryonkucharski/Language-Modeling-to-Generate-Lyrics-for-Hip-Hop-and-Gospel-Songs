Gangster, yeah, yeah 
 Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey 
 Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us 
 There's nothin' between us 
 Why would you wanna use a life to keep us 
 To keep us together 
 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other, no good for each other 
 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other 
 A lonely night 
 Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night 
 It was the only time 
 And if I led you on then I apologize 
 How can I make you rethink your decision?

 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other, no good for each other 
 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other 
 A lonely night 
 Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, oh 
 It was the only time 
 And if I led you on then I apologize 
 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other, no good for each other 
 Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart 
 We're no good for each other 
 A lonely night 
 Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night 
 It was the only time 
 And if I led you on then I apologize 
 A lonely night 
 Baby girl I loved you on a lonely night 
 It was the only time 
 And if I led you on then I apologize 
 Baby girl I loved you
