Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago 
 All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringin' up my phone 
 Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby 
 Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun 
 You never thought that I would ever go this far 
 You said potential could never last this long 
 Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life 
 What makes you think that you can ever do me right 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 The same old song 
 And now I'm poppin' yeah 
 Ain't nobody showed me how 
 I made it big poppin' yeah 
 Tell me how you like me now 
 I swear I loved you girl 
 And you probably went and fucked the world 
 Well you can take another shot every time you hear me playin' in the club 
 You never thought that I would ever go this far 
 (Never thought I'd go this far I made it) 
 You said potential could never last this long 
 (You never thought it could last so long) 
 Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life 
 (I been alone for most of my life) 
 What makes you think that you can ever do me right 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 You're the same old song 
 The same old song
