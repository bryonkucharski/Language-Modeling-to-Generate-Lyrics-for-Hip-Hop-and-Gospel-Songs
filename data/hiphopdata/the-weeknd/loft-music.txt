Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 They say my brain meltin', and the only thing I'll tell 'em 
 Is I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist 
 So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this 
 You may never get to show off, show off 
 Show off what you talking about 
 Unless you like to tease, baby 
 When in reality you don't know how to please, baby 
 Blue-ball queen, take your fucking seat, baby 
 Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby 
 Better than your next man 
 And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man 
 'Cause I don't play 
 Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day) 
 You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day) 
 Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day) 
 I think you lost your morals, girl (What?) 
 But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going 
 In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city 
 After rolling through the city with me 
 I promise you gon' see 
 That I'm only fucking twenty, girl 
 Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world 
 What you doing in the bathroom? 
 I hear noises in the bathroom 
 Baby, it's okay 
 We can do it in the living room 
 Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with 
 Seem to have twenty different pills in 'em 
 They tell us that they love us 
 Even though they want a next man 
 And the next man's bitch want the third man 
 Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places 
 Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces 
 Yeah we know just how to get a buzz 
 Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us 
 I'm raw, motherfucker, I'm raw 
 My love so lost in my niggas, man 
 These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted 
 I'll plug any nigga that'll step, man, I got 'em, yeah I got 'em 
 Till the ending of our credits, life's such a movie 
 Filmed independent, us against the city 
 Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls 
 And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it 
 What's good, young ho? You about it? 
 Got a loft right now, you're inside it 
 You excited? 
 What you thinkin' about? 
 What you thinkin' about?
