Wasted times I spent with someone else 
 She wasn't even half of you 
 Reminiscin' how you felt 
 Reminiscin' how you felt 
 And even though you put my life through hell 
 I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you 
 I want you to myself 
 And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now? 
 Who you give that love to now? 
 Who you pullin' up on? 
 Who you gettin' sprung for now? 
 And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot 
 Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot 
 'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 
 Catchin' feelings 
 These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin') 
 But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah) 
 And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin') 
 I hope you know this dick is still an option 
 'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah) 
 I'll take my time to learn the way your body functions 
 You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (I'll beat it) 
 This sex will get you high without no other substance 
 So who do you belong to now? (Who do you belong to now?) 
 Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?) 
 Who you pullin' up on? 
 Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?) 
 And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot) 
 Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (blowin' up their spot) 
 'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (feelings) 
 Catchin' feelings 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 
 Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee 
 Feelings 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 
 I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 
 Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee 
 Wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 If you ain't layin' next to me 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e 
 On me, me, on me, oh, I 
 On me, on me, on me
