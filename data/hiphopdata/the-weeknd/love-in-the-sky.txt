There's no one inside 
 But you're free to relax 
 If you commit to this ride 
 There's no turning back 
 You've been here before 
 Remember these sheets 
 This world's not for us 
 It's not what it seems 
 We'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 You'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 There's no need to hide 
 Don't overreact 
 You said you've been to the sky 
 We'll go beyond that 
 You've been here before, girl 
 Remember these sheets 
 This world's not for us 
 It's not what it seems 
 We'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 You'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 I'll teach you to dream, ooh 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 How does it feel? 
 Do you feel like you did before? 
 Do you see the world getting small? 
 How does it feel, are you free? 
 As for me, I've been getting grown 
 As for me, I've been getting old 
 As for me, I've been flying around the world 
 I've been killing these shows 
 But I'm always getting high 
 Cause my confidence is low 
 And I'm always in a rush 
 Ain't no time to fuck slow 
 And even if I try 
 It's not something I would know 
 But I'm sure I'll make you cum 
 Two or three times in a row 
 But I'm sure you would have left 
 Got that pussy in control 
 Put that pussy in control 
 I got it in control 
 Control, control, control, mmmmh
