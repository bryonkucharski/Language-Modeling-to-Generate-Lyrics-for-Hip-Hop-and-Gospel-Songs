I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time 
 I'll be over you eventually 
 Time after time, you seem to brush me off 
 I understand what we have become 
 You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine 
 I was in love with your mystery 
 Now I just take what I can get from you 
 I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be 
 Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide 
 I don't pretend to have any shame 
 I got a box we could put all your lies in 
 Until the end of days 
 You know that I will be a call away 
 The call you make when you're all alone 
 And I know that I will always be the one 
 You repent when you are done 
 Well here comes the sun 
 And you're in my arms 
 And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance 
 That you'll stay through the night 
 You just wanna fill the void now 
 I can tell that you've been yelling at him all night long 
 And I can hear it in your voice now 
 He got you smoking extra packs a day 
 Don't you worry 'bout me talking 
 I know why you've been coming 
 I'll be quiet this ain't nothing to me 
 Just wrap your legs around my waist 
 I won't stop until you ask me 
 Don't you worry 'bout us messing up my sheets 
 Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide 
 You're gonna hate him 
 Then you'll want me 
 Then you'll miss him 
 Then you'll hate me 
 Girl, I know you so well 
 Girl, I know your routine
