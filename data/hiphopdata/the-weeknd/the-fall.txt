You can pick my voice to dance to 
 You say my money no good in here 
 Even though I didn't ask you 
 And it's the most you've worked 
 Even though I probably don't deserve this girl 
 But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to 
 Baby, it's OK 
 I got show money baby 
 I wanna show you how I blow money baby 
 I wanna show you how I throw money baby 
 I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby 
 'Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted 
 Got some choppers on the car 
 What kind of caps I got the finest of them all 
 Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all 
 Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need 
 And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel 
 And it feels so good 
 It feels so good [x3] 
 I ain't scared of the fall [x4] 
 I felt the ground before [x4] 
 'Cause I ain't scared of the fall 
 Mama I understand why you're mad 
 And it hurts to accept what I am 
 And how I live 
 And what I do 
 But I've been good since Thursday 
 Yes I've been good since Thursday 
 So you can watch my love vanish 
 Where it goin', no telling 
 But to make room, I'll vanish 
 Call a friend for my friend 
 And her friend's name's Lexis 
 I let my niggas test it 
 I'm always worth a cent 
 Best believe I'm already spent 
 My blunt full of BC 
 My cup full of Texas 
 Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it 
 I was born to be reckless 
 Was forced to make records 
 So you ain't gotta ask "who's next?" 
 Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need 
 And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel 
 And it feels so good 
 It feels so good [x3] 
 I ain't scared of the fall [x4] 
 I felt the ground before [x4] 
 'Cause I ain't scared of the fall
