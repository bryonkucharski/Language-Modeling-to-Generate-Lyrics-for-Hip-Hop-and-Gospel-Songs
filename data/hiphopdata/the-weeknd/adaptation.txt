When the sun goes up, you're searching for a love 
 So your heart won't lead you to anyone 
 When the sun goes down, I know what you become 
 You become awaken, like the rest of us 
 I lay my head on a thousand beds 
 It's been a test to see how far a man can go without himself 
 I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place 
 Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace 
 I could've stayed 
 But I chose the life 
 I chose the life 
 Then I realized 
 She might have been the one 
 I let it go 
 For a little fun 
 I made a trade 
 Gave away our days 
 For a little fame 
 Now I'll never see your face 
 But it's okay I adapted anyway 
 Adapted to these models 
 Who's adapted to the bottle 
 They take it down like water 
 Just to burn away their sorrows 
 I'll stay up till tomorrow 
 Just to tear down all their morals 
 And all is fair in love and war 
 She's pure, so pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw 
 And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered 
 Because I chose the life 
 I chose the life 
 Then I realized 
 She might have been the one 
 I let it go 
 For a little fun, oh 
 I made a trade 
 Gave away our days 
 For a little fame 
 Now I'll never see your face 
 But it's okay I adapted anyway 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one
