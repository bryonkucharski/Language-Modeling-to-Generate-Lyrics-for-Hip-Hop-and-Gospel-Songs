Any time is the time 
 Any time for you to get my call, baby (so, baby) 
 Are you alone, baby? 
 Babe, he ain't around, pick up your phone, baby 
 Whoa 
 Can you try me? (try me), try me (try me) 
 Once you put your pride aside 
 You can notify me (fy me), -fy me (fy me) 
 You're the best I ever had 
 Baby girl, remind me (mind me), -mind me (mind me) 
 Lemme know if it's on 
 And you know where to find me, find me 
 Having thoughts you never had, yeah 
 I didn't know you were down for him finding out 
 I thought you had some kind of love for your man 
 Well, I'm not tryna break up something 
 You've been workin' out, you've been steady 
 But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me 
 Don't you tempt me 
 You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you 
 It might have been, been about a couple months 
 But I just got the picture that you texted to me 
 You ain't steady, you look ready to go all the way 
 If you let me take you down on me 
 Can you try me? (try me), try me (try me) 
 Once you put your pride aside (once you put your pride aside) 
 You can notify me (fy me), -fy me (fy me) 
 You're the best I ever had (you're the best I ever had) 
 Baby girl, remind me (mind me), -mind me (mind me) 
 Let me know if it's on (let me know) 
 And you know where to find me, find me 
 Havin' thoughts you never had, yeah 
 Can you try me? Try me, try me 
 Once you put your pride aside 
 You can notify me, -fy me 
 You're the best I ever had 
 Baby girl, remind me, -mind me 
 Lemme know if it's on (let me know, baby) 
 And you know where to find me (find me), find me (find me) Having thoughts you never had, yeah
