It has begun again, my friend 
 In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed 
 You made me fall again, my friend 
 How can I forget when you said love was just pretend? 
 Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately 
 But she told me that to love her is so crazy 
 'Cause she loves to lay 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, I'm all to blame 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay 
 Know I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, it's all a game 
 I learned the hard way 
 It has begun again, my friend 
 In your heart, we are nothing but strangers in the end 
 Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately 
 But she told me that to love her is so crazy 
 'Cause she loves to lay 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, I'm all to blame 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay 
 Know I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, it's all a game 
 I learned the hard way 
 I feel there's someone else 
 Worth your time, from the start 
 He's just one call away 
 From your mind, and your heart 
 It has begun, begun 
 Again, again, my friend, hey! 
 'Cause she loves to lay 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, I'm all to blame 
 I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay 
 Know I learned the hard way 
 She loves to lay, it's all a game 
 I learned the hard way
