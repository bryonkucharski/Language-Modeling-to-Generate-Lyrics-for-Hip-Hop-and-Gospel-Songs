I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through 
 I just can't say I don't love you 
 'Cause I love you, yeah 
 It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold 
 But tonight I'm gon' let you know 
 Let me tell the truth 
 Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah 
 You know what I'm thinkin' 
 See it in your eyes 
 You hate that you want me 
 Hate it when you cry 
 You're scared to be lonely 
 'Specially in the night 
 I'm scared that I'll miss you 
 Happens every time 
 I don't want this feelin' 
 I can't afford love 
 I try to find reason to pull us apart 
 It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect 
 And I know that you're worth it 
 I can't walk away, oh! 
 Even though we're going through it 
 And it makes you feel alone 
 Just know that I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah 
 The distance and the time between us 
 It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby 
 I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah 
 I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through 
 But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you 
 Just don't blame me too, yeah 
 'Cause I can't take this pain forever 
 And you won't find no one that's better 
 'Cause I'm right for you, babe 
 I think I'm right for you, babe 
 You know what I'm thinkin' 
 See it in your eyes 
 You hate that you want me 
 Hate it when you cry 
 It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect 
 And I know that you're worth it 
 I can't walk away, oh! 
 Even though we're going through it 
 And it makes you feel alone 
 Just know that I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah 
 The distance and the time between us 
 It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby 
 I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah 
 I would die for you 
 I would lie for you 
 Keep it real with you 
 I would kill for you, my baby 
 I'm just sayin', yeah 
 I would die for you 
 I would lie for you 
 Keep it real with you 
 I would kill for you, my baby 
 Even though we're going through it 
 And it makes you feel alone 
 Just know that I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah 
 The distance and the time between us 
 It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby 
 I would die for you 
 Baby I would die for you, yeah babe 
 (Die for you)
