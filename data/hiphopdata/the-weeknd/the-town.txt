You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne 
 You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne 
 I haven't been around the town in a long while 
 I apologize but I 
 I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me 
 I remember on the bathroom floor 
 Before I went on tour 
 When you said we couldn't do it again 
 Cause you had a thing with some other man 
 You said it was love 
 And you said you were lost 
 Then you wished me good luck 
 To find somebody to love 
 But, ooh 
 Now I've heard that you're single 
 And oh, I'll give you something to live for 
 Yes, I would 
 Honey please 
 You never thought you'd ever see my face again 
 But your love just swayed the lies 
 When he stared into your eyes 
 He just might be too good for you 
 You're almost dead to him 
 You're sleeping with a frozen heart 
 Well baby girl it's over now 
 And you can always count on me 
 Your unshackled bind, unrestrainted touch 
 So immune to love 
 And it feels so priceless to me 
 That you're always free 
 That you'll take me in 
 Now, I'm everything, your everything 
 I bet you'll take me in 
 I know you'll take me in now 
 The same place I left you in 
 I bet you'll take me in 
 I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in 
 The same place I left you in 
 You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne
