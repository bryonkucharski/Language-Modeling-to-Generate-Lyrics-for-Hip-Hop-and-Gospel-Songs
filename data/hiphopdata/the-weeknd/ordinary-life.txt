Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue 
 I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump 
 Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum 
 Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum 
 David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum 
 She just givin' head, she don't know what I've done 
 Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young 
 Die when I'm young, die when I'm young 
 Heaven knows that I've been told 
 Paid for the life that I chose 
 If I could, I'd trade it all 
 Trade it for a halo 
 And she said that she'll pray for me 
 I said, "It's too late for me 
 'Cause I think it's safe to say..." 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 No ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 Valhalla is where all the righteous are led 
 Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept 
 Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck 
 Cross on my neck, cross on my neck 
 Over 45, I'ma drift on a bend 
 Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge 
 Everybody said it would hurt in the end 
 Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin' 
 She said that she'll pray for me 
 I said, "It's too late for me 
 'Cause I think it's safe to say..." 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 No ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 Angels all singin' in monasteries, yeah 
 My soul is buried in LaFerraris 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
 Halos are given to ordinary lives 
 No, but this ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 No ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 This ain't ordinary life 
 No ordinary life 
 Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
