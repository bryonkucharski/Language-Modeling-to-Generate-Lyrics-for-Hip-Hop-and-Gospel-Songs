I know you want your money, girl 
 Cause you do this every day, okay 
 The way you doubt your feelings 
 And look the other way 
 Well, it's something I relate to 
 Your gift of nonchalance 
 Nobody's ever made me fall in love 
 With this amount of touch 
 I'm not a fool 
 I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside) 
 I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too 
 But you to taught me how to feel 
 When nobody ever would 
 And you taught me how to love 
 What nobody ever could 
 Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
 And learn to mistreat you 
 Cause you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I want to embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But you belong to the world 
 And I know that I'm saying too much 
 Even though I'd rather hold my tongue 
 And I'll pull you closer holding on to 
 Every moment till my time is done 
 And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile 
 In such long, I've succumbed to what I've become, baby 
 I'm not a fool 
 I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside) 
 I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too 
 Ooh girl, I should leave you (I know I should leave you) 
 And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you) 
 Because you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But, you belong to the world 
 But, you belong to the world 
 But, you belong to the world 
 You belong to the loneliness of filling every need 
 You belong to the world, you belong to the world 
 You belong to the temporary moments of a dream 
 Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
 And learn to mistreat you 
 Cause you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I want to embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But you belong to the world
