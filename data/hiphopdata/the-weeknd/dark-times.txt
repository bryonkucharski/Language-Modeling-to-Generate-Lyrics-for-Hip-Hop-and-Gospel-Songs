Waking up, half past five 
 Blood on pillow and one bruised eye 
 Drunk too much, you know what I'm like 
 But you should've seen the other guy 
 This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me 
 Baby I'm just being honest 
 And I know my lies could not make you believe 
 We're running in circles that's why 
 In my dark times I'll be going back to the street 
 Promising everything I do not mean 
 In my dark times, baby this is all I could be 
 And only my mother could love me for me 
 In my dark times, in my dark times 
 Light one up, let me bum a smoke 
 Still calming down, dripping throat 
 I got another man's blood on my clothes 
 But an endless fog's the life I chose 
 This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me 
 Baby I'm just being honest 
 And I know my lies could not make you believe 
 Running in circles, that's why 
 In my dark times I'll be going back to these streets 
 Promising everything I do not mean 
 In my dark times, baby this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could love me for me 
 In my dark times, in my dark times 
 In my dark times I've still got some problems I know 
 Driving too fast but just moving too slow 
 And I've got something I've been trying to let go 
 Pulling me back every time 
 In my dark times taking it back to the street 
 Making those promises that I could not keep 
 In my dark times, baby this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could love me for me) 
 In my dark times taking it down to the street 
 Making those promises that I would not keep 
 In my dark times this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could've loved me for me 
 In my dark times, in my dark times 
 In my dark times
