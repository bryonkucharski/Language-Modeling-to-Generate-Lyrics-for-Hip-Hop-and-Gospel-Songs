I realized, I belong to you 
 I feel the darkness, I run away from you 
 Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me 
 Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed 
 I learned to love you, the way you need 
 'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same 
 I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 I was too busy tryna find you with someone else 
 The one I couldn't stand, to be with was myself 
 'Cause I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh 
 If I die tonight, would you regret it? 
 Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have 
 'Cause I can't function, no I won't last 
 I swear I'll love you just like the past 
 'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same 
 I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 Oh, I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 I was too busy tryna find you with someone else 
 The one I couldn't stand, to be with was myself 
 'Cause I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 When I feel the love, girl I hesitate 
 It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah) 
 I can't get enough, I'm insane 
 Without your touch 
 Touch, touch, touch 
 (I'd be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') 
 (Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing' without you) 
 (Without you, without you, without you)
