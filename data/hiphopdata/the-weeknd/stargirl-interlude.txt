I had a vision 
 A vision of my nails in the kitchen 
 Scratching counter tops, I was screaming 
 My back arched like a cat, my position couldn't stop you were hitting it 
 And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy 
 And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, (I love it), Starboy 
 And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy 
 And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy 
 I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl 
 I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl 
 I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl 
 I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
