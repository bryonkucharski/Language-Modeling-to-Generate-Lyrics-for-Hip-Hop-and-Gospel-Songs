We found each other 
 I helped you out of a broken place 
 You gave me comfort 
 But falling for you was my mistake 
 I put you on top, I put you on top 
 I claimed you so proud and openly 
 And when times were rough, when times were rough 
 I made sure I held you close to me 
 So call out my name (call out my name) 
 Call out my name when I kiss you so gently 
 I want you to stay (want you to stay) 
 I want you to stay, even though you don't want me 
 Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?) 
 Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love? 
 Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name) 
 Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way 
 I'll be on my 
 I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied 
 I almost cut a piece of myself for your life 
 Guess I was just another pit stop 
 'Til you made up your mind 
 You just wasted my time 
 You're on top 
 I put you on top 
 I claimed you so proud and openly, babe 
 And when times were rough, when times were rough 
 I made sure I held you close to me 
 So call out my name (call out my name, baby) 
 So call out my name when I kiss you 
 So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay) 
 I want you to stay even though you don't want me 
 Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?) 
 Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love? 
 Won't you call out my name? (Say call out my name, baby) 
 Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way 
 Girl, I'll be on my 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On my way 
 On, on
