It's ideal 
 You need someone to tell you how to feel 
 And you think your happiness is real 
 There's so much more the world has to reveal 
 But you choose to be concealed 
 So you're somebody now 
 But what's a somebody in a nobody town 
 I don't think you even know it 
 So you're somebody now 
 But what's a somebody in a nobody town 
 You made enough to quit a couple years ago 
 But it consumes you 
 It's everywhere you go 
 And just the thought alone got you trippin' 
 Got you losing your mind 
 And I don't blame you 
 It's everything you know 
 All this time this ain't you 
 Da da da da 
 I decide when we're through 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'... 
 What does it mean 
 When your heart's already numb 
 You're professional 
 Won't treat it like it's personal 
 No, this is just love 
 It always makes its way back around 
 It's dispensable 
 To fall is unacceptable 
 Cause everything you've been through made you stronger 
 And every day you learn about yourself 
 And nothing really played out how it's supposed to 
 Depending on somebody else's wealth 
 But now you know the value of a dollar 
 And girl I make enough of it to spend 
 I love the way you've put yourself together 
 I love the way you make that body bend 
 For me again, oh yeah 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'... 
 All of those nights you were up barely holding your own 
 Girl, you've got it made 
 Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong 
 Now, you've got it made 
 Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song 
 Girl, you've got it made 
 Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along 
 Ooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes 
 How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile 
 In a world where your dreams can't be real, no 
 Every touch that you sell is a lie 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'...
