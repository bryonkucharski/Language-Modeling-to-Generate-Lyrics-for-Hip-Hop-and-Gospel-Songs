I'm paying for all my father's sins 
 So I will thank him for you 
 I'mma thank him for you 
 My serotonin's got a while to go 
 Girl, it's gone cause of you 
 It's been gone cause of you 
 They say, they want heaven 
 They say, they want God 
 I say, I got heaven 
 Well I say, I am God 
 I never prayed a moment in my life 
 Girl I'm rewarded with you 
 I've been rewarded with you 
 So baby let me kiss your inner thigh 
 Let me kiss it for you 
 I can kiss it for you 
 They say, they want heaven 
 They say, they want God 
 I say, I have heaven 
 I say, I am God
