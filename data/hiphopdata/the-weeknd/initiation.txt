Oh yeah 
 Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas, all this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking 
 Baby get familiar with the order 
 Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low, my eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing 
 Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place 
 No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight 
 I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living 
 The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration (oh yeah) 
 For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines 
 There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line 
 And the clocks don't work you don't gotta check the time 
 And the blinds don't work you don't gotta check the sky 
 We been going all night, till light 
 I got a test for you 
 You say you want my heart 
 Well baby you can have it all 
 There's just something I need from you 
 Is to meet my boys 
 You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby 
 Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby 
 Don't mind, all my writings on the wall 
 I thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall 
 And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week 
 And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe 
 Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin 
 In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking 
 On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing 
 Call one of your best friends 
 Baby if you mixing up 
 Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning 
 Back from the come down, girl I been fiending 
 For another round, don't you blame it on me 
 When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep 
 I got a test for you 
 You say you want my heart 
 Well baby you can have it all 
 There's just something I need from you 
 Is to meet my boys 
 I got a lot of boys 
 And we can make you right 
 And if you get too high 
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out 
 Work that back till I tire out 
 Roll that weed, blow the fire out 
 Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth 
 Get so wet when I eat you out 
 Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out 
 If they're not down, better keep 'em out 
 Ex-man hollering, keep him out 
 Hard to let go, I could teach you how 
 Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now 
 Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out 
 Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out 
 Baby, baby 
 I got a test for you 
 You say you want my heart 
 Well baby you can have it all 
 There's just something I need from you 
 Is to meet my boys 
 I got a lot of boys 
 And we can make you right 
 And if you get too high 
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO, [x8]
