Why you rushing me baby? 
 It's only us 
 I don't want to die tonight baby 
 So lemme sip this slow 
 I'll give you what you called for 
 Just let me get in my zone 
 I'll be making love to her through you 
 So let me keep my eyes closed 
 And I won't see a damn thing 
 I can't feel a damn thing 
 But if I touch you right 
 I won't see a damn thing 
 I can't feel a damn thing 
 But I'mma touch you right 
 I'mma touch you right (let me sip this slow) 
 I'mma touch you right (let me get inside my zone) 
 I'mma touch you right (just let me) 
 And I'mma lean, till I fall, ooh yeah 
 And I don't give a damn 
 I felt the ground before 
 I left it all behind, baby 
 I didn't need no one 
 But I'm in here tonight baby 
 I've been alone for too long 
 Oh, oh yeah 
 So, I won't say a damn thing 
 I can't feel a damn thing 
 But I'ma touch you right 
 I can't see a damn thing 
 I can't feel a damn thing 
 But I'ma touch you right 
 I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (let me sip this slow) 
 I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone) 
 I'ma touch you right (just let me)

 Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole 
 Man if pole dancing's an art you know how many fuckin' artists I know 
 Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favours I owe 
 Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go 
 Well girl let's... go, walk your broken heart through that door 
 Sit yo sexy ass on that couch 
 Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth 
 I take it slow 
 She in love with my crew 
 She said make enough so I can try some 
 I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you 
 Yeah girl, just be you 
 And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new 
 That's that north north, that up top 
 That OVO and that XO 
 Your girlfriend at our next show 
 But it's all good, don't stress though 
 First night fuck, never really planned it 
 Take a deep breath, no one need to panic 
 Lips so French, ass so Spanish 
 You don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here 
 But she got me all up in my zone 
 Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own 
 Aw yeah
