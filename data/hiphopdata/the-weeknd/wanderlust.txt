It was so hard to say the same thing 
 And you're so weak to say the same thing 
 Girl don't hold onto your apprehensiveness 
 And let the wildfire shine 
 And repeat after me 
 Good girls go to heaven, 
 And bad girls go everywhere 
 And tonight I will love you 
 And tomorrow you won't care 
 (Precious little diamond 
 I leave it all to you 
 Precious little diamond 
 Let it come to you) 
 (Precious little diamond 
 I leave it all to you 
 Precious little diamond 
 Let it come to you) 
 You're in love with something bigger than love 
 You believe in something stronger than trust 
 Wanderlust 
 Wanderlust 
 You're too shy away from me 
 Just sacrifice your every last inhibition 
 I'm on your side 
 Don't patronize 
 You know tonight 
 Is the only time we'll have each other 
 Why would you try to waste this precious time? 
 Cause tonight I'll be right here 
 And tomorrow you won't care 
 (Precious little diamond) 
 Precious little diamond 
 (I leave it all to you) 
 I leave it all to you 
 (Precious little diamond) 
 Precious little diamond 
 (Let it come to you) 
 (Precious little diamond) 
 Precious little diamond 
 (I leave it all to you) 
 I leave it all to you 
 (Precious little diamond) 
 Precious little diamond 
 (Let it come to you) 
 You're in love with something bigger than love 
 You believe in something stronger than trust 
 Wanderlust 
 Wanderlust 
 They're in love with this idea of love 
 It's a shame that they'll believe it will come 
 For us all, for us all 
 You're in love with something bigger than love 
 You believe in something stronger than trust 
 Wanderlust
