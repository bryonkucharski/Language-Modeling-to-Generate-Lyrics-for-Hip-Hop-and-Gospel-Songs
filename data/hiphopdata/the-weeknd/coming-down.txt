I got somethin' to tell you 
 But don't know how I'ma say it 
 I guess that I can only say one thing: 
 Girl, I been bad again 
 Girl, I been bad again 
 'Cause with this money comes problems 
 And with these problems come solutions 
 And I use 'em but I'm fading 
 I forget 
 I forget what you mean to me 
 Hope you know what you mean to me 
 Pick 
 Up 
 Your phone 
 The party's finished and I want you to know 
 I'm 
 All alone 
 I'm feeling everything before I got up 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 (x2) 
 Poppin' again 
 I tried to quit again 
 I'm always tight wit' somethin' I begin 
 That's why my niggas got me to the end 
 So play what I take, I take what I spend baby 
 I ain't lyin' to nobody but me 
 And you 
 And me 
 But you especially 
 Pick 
 Up 
 Your phone 
 The party's finished and I want you to know 
 I'm 
 All alone 
 I'm feeling everything before I got up 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 (x2) 
 Pick up your phone 
 I'm all alone 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down 
 I always want you when I'm coming down
