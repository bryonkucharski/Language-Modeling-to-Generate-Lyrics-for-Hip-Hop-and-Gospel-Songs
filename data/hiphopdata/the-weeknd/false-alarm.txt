Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves) 
 High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves) 
 She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves) 
 For you, for you 
 All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves) 
 So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves) 
 You love her, but you can't deny (she loves) 
 The truth, the truth 
 She loves everybody 
 Can't you tell by the signs? 
 She loves everybody 
 She gets off all the time 
 It's a dark philosophy 
 And it haunts her constantly 
 It's a false alarm to me 
 She's a false alarm 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves) 
 Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves) 
 You love her but you'll never be (she loves) 
 The one, the one 
 Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves) 
 She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves) 
 You love her, but you'll never be (she loves) 
 Enough, enough 
 She loves everybody 
 Can't you tell by the signs? 
 She loves everybody 
 She gets off all the time 
 It's a dark philosophy 
 And it haunts her constantly 
 She's a false alarm to me 
 She's a false alarm 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

 She always leaves the man she loves 
 But the diamonds are forever 
 She always seems to be alone 
 But the diamonds make it better 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
