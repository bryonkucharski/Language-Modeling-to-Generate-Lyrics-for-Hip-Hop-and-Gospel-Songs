Only losers go to school 
 I taught myself how to move 
 I'm not the type to count on you 
 Because stupid's next to "I love you" 
 No? So what can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already 
 We make our own sense 
 And you're qualified to me 
 What can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already 
 We make our own sense 
 And you're qualified 
 And you're qualified 
 Only losers go to school 
 They can't teach what they can't prove 
 Come put this inside a test-tube 
 Because stupid's next to "I love you" 
 So what can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already? 
 We make our own sense 
 You're qualified to me 
 What can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already? 
 'Cause we make our own sense 
 And you're qualified 
 And you're qualified to- 
 And you're qualified 
 And now that we're all grown up 
 Who do we owe it to? 
 And now that we've gone this far 
 Who do we owe it all to? 
 We did it all alone 
 Now we're coming for the throne 
 We did it all alone 
 Now we're coming for the throne 
 And now that we all came up 
 Do we lose? Do we lose? 
 So what can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already? 
 'Cause we make our own sense 
 And you're qualified to me 
 What can you show me 
 That my heart don't know already? 
 'Cause we make our own sense 
 And you're qualified to me 
 And you're qualified to me
