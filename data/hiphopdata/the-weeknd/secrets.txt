Everybody here wants you 
 My love, my love 
 And I know that you want them too 
 My love, my love 
 I ask you what your heart desires 
 My love, my love 
 You tell me I'm the only one 
 My love, my love 
 It's a lie, a lie 
 I catch you every time 
 In your lust, your lust 
 Every time you close your eyes 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin' 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin' 
 You told me not to worry 'bout 
 Those guys, those guys 
 You told me that you left it all behind 
 Behind 
 It's a lie, a lie 
 I catch you every time 
 In your lust, your lust 
 Every time you close your eyes 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin' 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin' 
 Wipe... the... 
 Lust from your eyes 
 I see that you're not mine 
 I can see the lust in your eyes 
 You can't hide it 
 You can't be the one 
 I realize, we're divided 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin' 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you're talkin' in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep 
 When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
