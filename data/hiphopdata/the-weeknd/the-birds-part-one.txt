Hope you see 
 It won't mean a thing to me 
 I've been doing this too long 
 Baby girl, I've felt it all 
 So watch out 
 If you try to play your luck 
 Ain't nobody gonna care enough 
 To catch you fall 
 So don't you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Nobody needs to fall in love 
 I swear I'm just a bird 
 Girl, I'm just another bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Like Me 
 You tried 
 You tried to warn me 
 But baby, I'm warning you 
 Girl, I'll show you 
 This is no game 
 You'll be falling to the point of no return 
 No return 
 So don't you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Nobody needs to fall in love 
 I swear I'm just a bird 
 Girl, I'm just another bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Like Me 
 I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie 
 I know it's got a hold of you 
 I know you're rolling with it 
 Baby don't you lie, baby 
 I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie 
 I know it's got a hold of you 
 I know you're rolling with it 
 Baby don't you lie, baby 
 So don't you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Like me 
 'Cause girl I'm just a bird 
 Girl, I'm just another bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me 
 Like me
