Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back 
 Into your arms 
 Said you fucked another man 
 Finally, I knew this day would come 
 Whoa oh oh 
 Cause I see fear in your eyes 
 You've been living out your life 
 As long as you know that when I land you're mine 
 It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face 
 I've been living on the road 
 And you've been living all alone, at home 
 Girl I hope, he made you satisfied 
 Well baby I won't cry 
 As long as you know that when I land you're mine 
 And you will never feel so pretty 
 And you will never feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 There are certain things that I've come to understand 
 Expectations can kill a simple man, simple man 
 I try to master the art, of that far away love 
 Only so much can keep a woman warm 
 Now it's times like this that I say to myself 
 We've been living in a cold, cold world 
 But at least I have you to rely 
 Even if for a short time 
 As long as you know that when I land you're mine 
 And you will never feel so pretty 
 And you will never feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 And he can't make you feel this pretty 
 And he won't make you feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 And you will never feel so pretty 
 And you will never feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 And he can't make you feel this pretty 
 And he won't make you feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 And you will never feel so pretty 
 And you will never feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 And he can't make you feel this pretty 
 And he won't make you feel this beautiful 
 When I make it there 
 Oh when I make it there 
 Quand une putain de colombe chante sa chanson, 
 C'est tout ce qu'on entend. 
 Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent 
 Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux 
 10 ans mon ami, que ne rien d'autre compte 
 Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment 
 Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde. 
 C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans
