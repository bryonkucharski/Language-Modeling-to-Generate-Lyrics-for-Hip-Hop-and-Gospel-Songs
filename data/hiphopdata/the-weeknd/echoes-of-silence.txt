Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling 
 You say you don't need to go, don't you pretend you didn't know 
 How all of this would end up, girl, I saw it in your eyes 
 And baby I can read your mind and expectations were not in sight 
 You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here 
 'Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared 
 'Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end 
 It's gonna end how you expected, girl you're such a masochist and I ask, "Why?" 
 And you reply 
 "I like the thrill 
 Nothing's gonna make me feel this real 
 So baby don't go home 
 I don't wanna spend tonight alone 
 Baby please 
 Would you end your night with me? 
 Don't you leave me all behind 
 Don't you leave my little life 
 Don't you leave my little lie" 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no
