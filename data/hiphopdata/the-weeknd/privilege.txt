Enjoy your privileged life 
 'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night 
 We said our last goodbyes 
 So, let's just try to end it with a smile 
 And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering 
 You are suffering no more 
 'Cause I held you down when you were suffering 
 You were suffering 
 Blues away, way, way 
 I got two red pills to take the blues away 
 Blues away, way, way 
 I got two red pills to take the blues away 
 And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay 
 They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say 
 But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways 
 And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh 
 I don't wanna hear that no more, no more 
 No more, no more 
 I don't wanna hear that no more
