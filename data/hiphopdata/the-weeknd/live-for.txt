Getting sober for a day 
 Got me feeling too low 
 Always try and make me slow down 
 Tryna tell me how to live 
 I'm about to lose control 
 If they can watch me fuck it up all in one night 
 I'm in my city in the summer 
 Camo'd up, leather booted 
 Kissing bitches in the club 
 They wanna threesome, then some 
 Spend whatever come in, fucking income 
 Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke 
 And you, have to, do it all 
 Just to know where it gets you 
 Living dreams we can never afford 
 Now we sitting in the back saying 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I'd die for 
 This the shit you can't fake dawg 
 This the shit you need God for 
 How long do you think, 
 It's gon' take for y'all to fall 
 That's a serious question 
 'Cause I'm seriously questioning all of y'all 
 Been touring the world man 
 I've done spent racks in all the malls 
 And they know my story, flaws and all 
 I still got plaques hanging wall to wall dawg 
 She just offered a strip tease 
 But she don't look like Demi Moore 
 Hips all on 45, waist all on 24 
 And it's all love in the city 
 Still scream XO, when that Henny pour 
 But I'm that boy, not just any boy 
 What the fuck you think that I'm in it for 
 Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince 
 But they know I'm king 
 Chubbs might hold that thing, 
 If he get caught, he'll be home by spring 
 Things I shouldn't share, 
 I mean for the sake of my career 
 I'm not trynna stunt, 
 I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit you can't fake dawg 
 This the shit you need God for 
 This that shit we really gotta talk about in person 
 There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working 
 Nigga, champagne 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for
