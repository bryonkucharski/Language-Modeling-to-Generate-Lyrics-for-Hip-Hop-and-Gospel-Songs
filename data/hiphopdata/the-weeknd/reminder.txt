Recommend play my song on the radio 
 You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul 
 I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke 
 And I sweat too much on the regular 
 We gone let them hits fly, we gone let her go 
 If it ain't XO then it gotta go 
 I just won a new award for a kids show 
 Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag a blow 
 I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice 
 Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy 
 Whip game, make a nigga understand though 
 Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo 
 Hit the gas so hard make it rotate 
 All my niggas blew up like a propane 
 All these RnB niggas be so lame 
 Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane 
 You know man, you know man, you know man 
 Every time we try to forget who I am 
 I'll be right there to remind you again 
 You know man (pow! pow!), you know man 
 Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean 
 Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion 
 All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit 
 It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit 
 Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me 
 Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine 
 Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed 
 I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG 
 All my niggas get it they make money all alone 
 Wrap a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home 
 When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show 
 And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know 
 Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor 
 Now my shit straight 
 Eating all day, tryna lose weight 
 That good sex, we'll sweat it out 
 Hotel bed springs we'll wear it out 
 I ain't gotta tell you cause 
 You know man, you know man 
 You know man, you know man 
 Every time we try to forget who I am 
 I'll be right there to remind you again 
 You know man (pow! pow!), you know man 
 Why don't you shake something, shake something 
 For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing 
 Big girl won't you work something, work something 
 For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing 
 Big girl won't you shake something, shake something 
 For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing 
 Baby girl won't you work something, work something 
 For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing 
 Cause you know man, they know man 
 You ain't know man, now you know man
