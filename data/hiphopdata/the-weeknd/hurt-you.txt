And now I know relationship's my enemy 
 So stay away from me 
 I'm warning you 
 You try to fill the void with every man you meet 
 'Cause you're upset with me 
 I'm warning you 
 'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes 
 And all the nights you thought about takin' your life 
 'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time 
 But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me 
 Just call me up again 
 I'll make you weak 
 Girl, I'll come to put myself between your lips 
 Not between your heart 
 Can't you see? 
 That all the nights we slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby) 
 And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby) 
 'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste) 
 If you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't wanna, baby 
 I don't wanna, baby 
 I don't
