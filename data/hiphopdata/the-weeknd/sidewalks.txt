I ran out of tears when I was 18 
 So nobody made me but the main streets 
 'Cause too many people think they made me 
 Well, if they really made me then replace me 
 Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress 
 I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen 
 And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me 
 I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me 
 Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me 
 My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me 
 I know you wish that nobody ever love me 
 I feel useless when I'm never making money 
 Well, this the life we always fantasized 
 Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes 
 Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors 
 Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 They don't ever lie 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 They showed me all the signs 
 They don't let me down 
 But they lead me on 
 And they don't let me down 
 But they lead me on 
 And they lead me on 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Say, say, say 
 I come from Myrtle, one brung late night melee 
 Say, say, say 
 We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae 
 Say, say, say 
 Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day 
 Say, say, say 
 Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK 
 Say, say, say 
 OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways 
 How to segue 
 Pussy, power, profit in headache 
 I reminisce my life innocence 
 Or life innocent 
 Or life intimate, with fame 
 Like when repent 
 Like when we women up 
 Gon' get it, good game 
 She wanna hang with a Starboy 
 The sun and the moon and star, boy 
 Astronomer, anonymous 
 I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us 
 And five of us are probably fucked 
 She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy 
 Twenty legs, arms, head (head) 
 Head, head, more head (head) 
 Oh God, bless the dead (yah) 
 I'm livin' life, high off life 
 I wear my chokes off to bed 
 I'm the greatest nigga, why you so scared to say it? 
 I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land 
 I never stop 
 I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one 
 Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 They don't ever lie 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 Sidewalks saved my life 
 They showed me all the signs 
 They don't let me down 
 But they lead me on 
 And they don't let me down 
 But they lead me on 
 And they lead me on
