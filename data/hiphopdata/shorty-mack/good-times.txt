Killa House 
 Brick City 
 Style P. 
 When Funk Doc start takin' the drag 
 It's like who in the hell left this apron to lad 
 Broken glass 
 I'm swinging harder then cash is swung 
 The only kid with a Velcro, fabric thump 
 Neva! dropin' the blunt 
 Two for fine rollin' 
 Eighty nine in the bricks is fifteen and growin' 
 Killa House fan, you know what it mean 
 It mean your sifa ain't fuckin' wit the lord of the ring 
 Diggy! I pack your pipe wit nothin' but bomb 
 It roll on, like the Power Stripe under your arm 
 Oh Lord, involge 
 Massive indo, I'm breakin' the dress code 
 I ain't rockin' kinda-gos 
 I just came to get high with Styles 
 Like my, block D with wider vowels 
 I'm talking about A, E, I, O, U, my skills already have niggas 'prest 
 Fuck an interview 
 "I get high - high - high - high" (Every day) 
 "I get high - high - high - high" (Every night) 
 "I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory" (All the time) 
 "HIGH on your memory..." (Every day) 
 "I get high - high - high - high" (Every night) 
 "I get high - high - high - high" (All the time) 
 "I get high - high - high - high" (*laughing*) 
 "High-ighhhhhhh..." 
 I'ma blow it if it's sticky kid (what up!) 
 I smoke manage jars full a green like Biggy did 
 My pens my sagare 
 My bars be serious 
 You can't fuck wit me dawg, point blank period 
 I get high and hallucinate 
 A pound cast six in New York 
 But its half in Miami 
 Nigga move your wait 
 My dimes be one point O's, 20's be two point 2's 
 Bring a snack and some fruit punch too 
 And you know I the purple stuff 
 I'm so high I can piss on a cloud 
 And make a bird look up 
 Smokin' haze in the Hummer wile the bird look up 
 Gettin' high wit the hammer so the bird shook up 
 I get high like Doc and Meth 
 And "Let the Monkeys Out" 
 So I can "Bring the Pain" wile I pop ya chest 
 It's D block when the basters repin' (D block) 
 All I need is a lighter and some haze with a master collection 
 What 
 Okay 
 Who ya know smoke more Earth then Tical 
 Hit up a weed spot 
 Then off to the D block to smoke it wit Styles 
 I Fight my way up out the D-Tox 
 Who smoke a slip 
 But he don't need block (?) and cumulus clouds 
 Pull up your Rebox 
 This kid is goin' - mad, rapper like D-Doc 
 I got trees, but I'm tryin' to smoke a little he got 
 If not these niggas then who (Son tell me who) 
 Burn a leaf and get it Hot in Herre, like Nelly do 
 I get high, like Mary J. is all I need to get by 
 Stay red eye 
 No need to get fly 
 I get rush (RUSH) when I'm rollin' 'em up 
 The other day I saw sonz in the theater 
 Kids was throwin' 'em up 
 I get high, high, high 
 Every day I get high 
 Yeah I get high, high, high 
 And every night I get high 
 Yeah I get high, high, high 
 Mr. Meth I get high

 With Styles P. I get high-ighhhhhhh 
 I am the ghost
