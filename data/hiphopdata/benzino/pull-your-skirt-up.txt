What can I do sell a record? I can't even give this shit away! all my cds all went wood and I got something to say: 
 Let me start from the beginnin, I GOT NO CLASS, NO LOVE, NO TALENT 
 IF I COULD BUY EM's HEART MABYBE I COULD START ON SOMETHIN' 
 But he smoked me on the tracks and his rhymes are gettin' played while 
 I can't get no respect cause my tired ass is played. 
 Five shades DUMBER THAN JA RULE, BUT I'M STILL IN THERE SLINGIN' 
 PAC IS ROLLIN' IN HIS GRAVE AND MY PENIS PUMP IS CRUMPLIN I CAN'T THINK OF A REAL DIS SO I'm GONNA LIFT FROM OTHERS MY OWN PEEPS DON'T ReSPECT ME, SO why should I? 
 Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye 
 My time's never up cause real niggas don't die 
 I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV 
 BUT I'm STILL AFRAID TO FIGHT HIM 
 Cause moby's twice as man as me 
 I bring MY MAMA to your living room so you could see me 
 BEG Yeah you sold alot of units, but you can't be me 
 So thank the gods of hip hop and the world 
 That you're not a punk like me 
 The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up 
 Long as rage like my own source 
 Are gettin' space on the newsstaand 
 SEE I'm playin' by a different set of rules you got me fucked up 
 Respect the hood LIL RAY RAY, or the hood'll take you out 
 You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign 
 Disrespect Benzino, HELL, YOU GOTTA GET IN LINE! 
 What you know about pumpin, WILL YOU GIVE MY ASS A TRY? 
 Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend I'M LIKE AN ILLER BILLY BUCKNER 
 My number in the rafters fuck MY ASS IT's YOURS, I'm BEGGIN 
 I'M all right but I'M not real (Real) 
 I DON'T spit I SWALLOW GIMME YOUR steel (Steel) 
 The two thousand three Vanilla Ice? I TRIED TO BE IT 
 With that wack redemption shit, but the audience wouldn't 
 Buy it so I'm back here hawkin rags 
 If you ask me, I GUESS I'D SAY I'M TRULY UNDERrated 
 But facts is facts my sales is wack 
 And I'm not that hard, in fact I'm faded. 
 Better never let me see you with A HARD ON CAUSE YOU KNOW I'D GIVE YOU SKULLY. SURE I'D BEG FOR A TASTE, CLOSEST I CAN COME TO SHOOTIN' GIFT 
 And don't forget, how this shit all cccured to me 
 Your whole camp be surrounded by security 
 What you want? the black or the chrome? PUT IT IN MY MOUTH, MY MOUTH CAN BE YOUR HOME, HOMEY 
 I want A TASTE OF YOUR MAGIC SO I'LL BE KNEELIN AT your door 
 I'll earn my stripes AND THEN I'LL SWALLOW, I'm a pussy 
 Zino SWEET LIPS WILL WRAP AROUND YOU TILL YOU GIVE ME THAT SWEET NOOKIE 
 Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin' crazy 
 On my block THE GIRLS ALL FLOCK TO THE FLOW OF SWEET Slim Shady 
 I'M NOT SO WELL, I DON'T FEEL REAL (Real) 
 LEMME SWALLOW YOU WHOLE I WON'T spit EMINEM, MY MASTER, I WILL KEEP IT REAL (Steel) 
 I talk shit WITH MY MOUTH FILLED BUT AT LEAST I'LL GET A TASTE OF WHAT THE REAL GIFT REALLY TASTES LIKE, CUZ RIGHT NOW I'VE NEVER killed (Killed) 
 And that's how the motherfuckin story go 
 You shoot, I swallow, you spit, I wallow. I been beggin for a taste, so homey come 'n' gimme some. for your little ray-ray punk just a taste will bring me home.
