(Benzino): 
 In the studio all night makin' hits 
 Since you claim I don't right I'm a put it like this 
 Benzino shit tight when I flex my wrists 
 Check the publishing dawg I gets checks for this 
 And the public gonna love with the check for this 
 Motivated by the hate you better check the list 
 Shit's climbin' homeboy you better check these whips 
 Fully loaded with a tech two extra clips 
 Now it wasn't really that long ago 
 When I put it down with my team almighty R.S.O. 
 Hustler by night make beats in the day 
 Had that thing under the bed if you fuck with Ray 
 Damn shame why we gotta live this way 
 Protect my life by any means I ain't dyin' today 
 And I love rap music it's the reason I'm alive 
 And my faith in God is the reason I survive what 
 I'm prayin' forever 
 I gotta find another way up 
 Ain't no way I'll ever give up 
 I'm stayin' forever 
 And there ain't nothin' holdin' me down 
 Ain't no way to count me out 
 (Benzino): 
 Not too many chose the path that young Zino took 
 Where the R.S.O. or Made Men cats we shook 
 I find it hard to believe that dawg's still livin' 
 Let alone makin' music and I in prison 
 Destiny's some shit you can't avoid 
 Build a solid foundation and you can't destroy 
 Me Jeff and JD we keepin' it real 
 We stay-in homeboys fuck a record deal 
 Shit don't move less you got somethin' to prove 
 Caught up in the streets go gun for gun 
 Since day one I know I stack a million plus 
 Maintain keep my cash flow up bumble and sickly 
 Still got my .38 with me and my gangsta tight 
 Like invincible shit get critical 
 You face I ain't feelin' you 
 Dead upon arrival it's all about survival 
 I'm a rep for my title 
 (Benzino): 
 Dead before dishonor I'm a scream it loud 
 Put in work Four Corners where I move the crowd 
 Undenied my dawg's were the best around 
 Media constantly tryin' to test my ground 
 Attitude real 'noyed my trust is gone 
 Temper always flare up my patience worn 
 Association's a bitch when you known by all 
 Conspiracy with a snitch wanna see me fall 
 Raw shit revoke I don't seem to ever learn my lesson 
 Hayes blowin' out the roof spray envy and blessin' 
 Ray face the truth when niggas start confessin' 
 Hot up in the booth I hope I answered all your questions 
 Ain't no way to count me out 
 I'm gon' be here for you babe 
 We gotta find a way out 
 Ain't no way I'll ever give up
