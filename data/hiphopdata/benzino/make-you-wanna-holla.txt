[Benzino]: 
 Now we gon burn this right here 
 Ay yo dim the lights down 
 Yeah yeah 
 We gon let the track talk to em 
 Fly cars pretty hos rocks on my arm shit 
 You'd think I had the world in my palm 
 Surrounded by the team pockets full of C.R.E.A.M. 
 Still ain't all peaches and cream 
 'Cause it's hard being a rich man specially when you black 
 No margin for error no room for slack 
 Cops stay on your back 
 Lyin' tryin' to convict me 
 They wait to treat a nigga you would think it was the 60's 
 And it 
 Makes you wanna holla 
 To the top of my lungs but the weed smoke's blockin my lungs 
 Watchin my son 
 I know this game is mean don't let him go where I've gone 
 See what I've seen takin' puffs off the green 
 Keep my mind off this bullshit 
 It's like a mental tug of war 
 With every bullshit I got a keep a full clip 
 You niggas don't understand 
 I'm only human I'm just like you damn 
 Makes you wanna holla 
 'Cause it's hard sometimes on the grind 
 When you're tryin' to get them dollars man and 
 Prayin' for tomorrow 
 But it might not come so I'm a hustle till my work is done 
 It makes you wanna holla 
 'Cause it's hard sometimes on the grind 
 When you're tryin' to get them dollars man 
 Prayin' for tomorrow 
 But it might not come so I'm a hustle till my work is done 
 [Benzino]: 
 Livin' swimmin in bucks big boy trucks 
 Sometimes I feel like givin' it up 
 Drop top chrome pipes damn what a life 
 I'd trade it all just to sleep some nights 
 It's hard bein a gangsta 
 Specially when you get the D.A. still buildin a case 
 Everywhere you turn cameras all up in your face 
 I.R.S. audit your papes trying to take your estate 
 And your man's on the stand raisin his right hand 
 Cause you swear to tell the truth I bet you do 
 And it 
 Makes you wanna holla 
 'Cause when you got dollars every chick wanna holla 
 Claimin they swallow 
 Need the so-called cats you knew from way back 
 Suddenly they your cousin wanna run with the pack 
 He your man long as you givin' him stacks 
 But let you get fucked and need a buck 
 He ain't callin you back 
 Now what type of shit is that
