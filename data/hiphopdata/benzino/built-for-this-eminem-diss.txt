Yeah 
 You thought it was over? 
 Nah 
 You can't get rid of me 
 I'm the arch nemesis 
 And I'm not stopin 
 Until I've accomplished what I've came here for 
 Complete elimination 
 It's bout to be the death of slim shady, a little over 2 years, he still can't face me, that shit you pulled on the TV was a slick move, you should have got Dave, cause now I'ma get you 
 And I ain't even pressin up on a ya like I shoud beter double up on ya security, wish a nigga would 
 Tryin' to run up on the station, and I'll be waiting with fully automatics, blowin' out your patients, you got a fuckin' nerve takin' me to trial 
 Copyright infrigmit, you said it was a freestyle, and you lied about your age, you was 21, never ever make a move with an empty gun, I'll go to war, never fold, snipe you on the fifty yard line, why talkin' this way? And why you walkin' with Dre, it don't matter, catch you at a show, you ain't built for battle
