Look into my eyes and you will see: (My Struggle my pain) 
 My life my pain and the things that made me (made me who I am) 
 There's no other place that I would rather be (Benzino) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me... 
 (Benzino Speaking) 
 This one's for the world, my people 
 U think you know me? U have no idea who I am, This is my story 
 It's not about the magazine (no), about my baggy jeans (no) and my braidz (no) and my jewelery (ah ah), the money: nah, (non of that) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me 
 (Verse one) 
 It wasn't long ago when it all began 
 Standin' in the graveyard while they buried my men 
 It's when I first understood how this game was played 
 Either kill a nigga quick or you might get played 
 Street was never was that big, the hood's even smaller 
 Grew up in the projects that moved the four quarters 
 Pop's went to prison, I knew about the system 
 Every Sunday morning, me and mom's paid a visit 
 He was heavy in the streets maybe mafia connected 
 All I'm gonna say he was very well respected 
 They called me raydog, yeah that's Titos son 
 I met a lot of great men for many years to come 
 I'm gettin' money on my block all night 
 Runnin' with a bunch of niggaz born to fight, Nigga! 
 Boston was the first on the east to really bang out 
 Niggaz wanted streets while them automatics rang out 
 Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain) 
 My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place) 
 There's no other place that I would rather be (That's right) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me... 
 (Verse two) 
 Now fucking with these niggaz on the other side of town 
 The allmighty spalms, we the hottest click around 
 Jewelery was heavy niggas rolled thirty thick 
 Artillery was heavy niggas, Jake standn' on my dick 
 And I'm squeezin all types of guns, what eva 
 Mom's keeps cryin', but that's the life of thugs 
 And that's the life I love, I'm addicted to it 
 Street life, real thug niggaz makin' rap music 
 I met Dave at the radio, he cool 
 Started the source mag, always had to be in school 
 It was one piece of paper then they grew in to a book 
 But I had my own paper, cause my block was a look 
 I caught I couple of Benz, I'm fighting court cases 
 It was news at eleven, or in the news papers 
 Investigation federal, I knew it from the start 
 I knew that jealousy and envy tore my crew apart 
 Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain) 
 My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place) 
 There's no other place that I would rather be (That's right) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me... 
 (Verse three) 
 If money is the root of all evil then burn it 
 Or get up off you ass mothafucka and earn it 
 I moved to New York, It was time to make it happen 
 Dave is my dog and yeah zino's still rappin' 
 I walk trough the valley of death with no fear 
 I'm holding Dave down till the niggaz's outta here (beleve that) 
 I breath fore my niggaz disease, holding in 
 Exhale all the anger that I'm holding within 
 To many people in my life, never coming back (no) 
 It's never where you from, it's only where standin' now 
 Got a few good niggaz, a box of ammunition, that's all I really need for me to carry out a mission 
 If Eminem wanna squash beef tell him call me (where you at?) 
 Meet him any where, he can bring his whole army (Bring em') 
 The day will soon come when the world recognize 
 Zino is the realist, since Pac been alive 
 Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain) 
 My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place) 
 There's no other place that I would rather be (I didn't chose this life) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me...(yeah yeah) 
 (Benzino Speaking) 
 Yeah Troy you did it on this one nigga, believe that, yeah the Arch nemesis 
 In the hood me and you, yeah believe that, this is my story
