(Benzino) 
 Ima smoke until I'm fried 
 Help me cope with the demons that I can't hide 
 Intuition is a gift (nigga) 
 If you think that a nigga did it 
 Hit 'em in the chest and keep it movin' 
 Or go sit your silly ass down 
 Don't give me no excuses that you turned your little life around (naw) 
 You were born into violence 
 You weave pain, ain't nuttin but a g thang 
 Anyway, you better get him 'fore he get you (get you) 
 Fuck around, fall asleep then he wet you 
 Fuck around he call the feds then they get you 
 And your bitch is gonna flip and forget you 
 Drop to my knees, Lord I'm reachin' out 
 I'm ordain to the streets (Tell me what's it all about uh) 
 Kill them niggas with the clout 
 Eliminate these haters 
 Ima deal with you later 
 Man this shit got me fucked up (fucked up) 
 Right up 
 I gotta keep token (pass that shit) 
 Conversatin with the devil 
 I'm on another level 
 The evil thing that men do 
 Off with your head if you fuckin' with Benzino (fuckin' with Benzino) 
 God I'm droppin' to my knees (to my knees) 
 My Rosaries in my hand 
 And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please) 
 Gotta take the pain away (Gotta take the pain away) 
 Will I live to see another day (another day) 
 I was, boring in heaven, raised in hell 
 Fightin demons off my back 
 Attack and kill 
 Chill 
 When murder is an option 
 Gotta take precaution 
 I'm already known, the Lord has a plan 
 But it's so damn hard bein honest man 
 And I'm stuck in my ways 
 So Ima blaze for life 
 Give these streets some praise 
 I know they raised me right (haha) 
 Jesus Christ, if my life turns upside-down 
 I'll sit beside you in your kingdom with your angels round 
 Hear the sound of your choir 
 All in my brain 
 The streets is on fire 
 They callin my name 
 Even though they caused me so much pain (so much pain) 
 They lace a thugged up on so much game (so much game) 
 The agony in extacy 
 People mad at me 
 If Judas' is next to me 
 End up in tragedy 
 Fuck it 
 I'm destined to die young 
 I'm losin my religion 
 Speakin' in tongue 
 I'm on a one way trip to death 
 Inhaling this pain like it's my last breath (so what's next) 
 Ima kill you 'fore you kill me 
 Fuckin' with Hobby ya dead body 
 Your bitch gonna feel me 
 God I'm droppin' to my knees (to my knees) 
 My Rosaries in my hand 
 And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please) 
 Gotta take the pain away 
 Will I live to see another day (another day) 
 (Fatal Hussein) 
 Hussein the don 
 It's nothin' I get there early 
 'Cause I stay in the mix 
 Could you imagine all the demons 
 When you stay in the Bricks 
 And every night I hear 'em talkin' to me 
 It's like I hear 'em when they call me in my sleep 
 But I ain't tryin' ta feel 'em walkin' to me 
 Six million ways to die 
 I choose the one, that's easiest to me 
 So I choose the gun 
 And if you choose the wrong one choice 
 You better choose to run 
 I had a soul of Makaveli 
 When you lose a lung 
 Take it from me 
 I make niggas learn respect 
 Disrespect hurt but pain is when I burn a tech 
 And it ain't nutttin like gettin' ya head slittin ya wig 
 And the fed find you buried with your bitch and her kids 
 It was rough comin' up nigga, I ain't eatin 
 You think I'm tryin' to turn the tables now, I ain't beat 
 I'm finna do this, ride it out to the end 
 Rest In Peace to my niggas 
 Makaveli the don, Killa Kadafi 
 God I'm droppin' to my knees (to my knees) 
 My Rosaries in my hand 
 And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord Please) Rest In Peace 
 Gotta take the pain away 
 Will I live to see another day (another day) 
 (Benzino - talkin') 
 No doubt, this one goin' out to my brother Porky D 
 Hold ya head 
 Rest in peace Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, Big Punisher, Big L, Freaky Tah
