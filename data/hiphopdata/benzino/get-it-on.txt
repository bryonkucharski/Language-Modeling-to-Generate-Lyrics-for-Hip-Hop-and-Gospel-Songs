Yellow City Benzino 
 23 inches on the ride when we get it on 
 Honey look I'm really ride we should get it on 
 Got my people on the side we should get it on

 23 inches on the ride when we get it 
 Honey look I'm really ride we should get it on 
 Got my people on the side we should get it on 
 Let's chill tonight we gon get it on 
 [Benzino]: 
 Shorty lookin' high when she takin' it 
 On the floor lookin' right when she shakin it 
 Bartender get the ice start shakin it 
 Everybody gettin' fly how you playin' it 
 Since you wanna keep it real I'm a let you know 
 Got me open Ma now I don't wanna let you go 
 You remind me of these honeys in the video 
 Get her back to the telly and it's here we go 
 If the chickens on the rag we say hell no 
 Give her chips call a cab we say let's go 
 {You nasty Ray you nasty} 
 Please believin it 
 We had another glove shorty straight up teasin it 
 Stop playin' Ma tell me who you leavin' with 
 She said Zino what you sayin' who you creepin' with 
 Thought I'd really let you know that I'm feelin' it 
 And if I get you to the crib then I'm killin' it 
 [Benzino]: 
 Now we in the corner takin' Remy to the head 
 Put the Cardiers on eyes gettin' red 
 You like the chain or the watch or the wood-grain frames 
 Switch lanes in a champagne drop 
 Get brains on planes in Bangkok 
 Mami like them things that a man can't cop 
 Mami always saying please Ray don't stop 
 {Ray please don't stop} 
 And the beat don't stop 
 We on the scene and you already know 
 Zino on the stage with a real tight flow 
 Six figures paid for a real tight flow 
 My niggas made and they can't say no 
 So shake that Ma take that Ma 
 Make my eyes move where your waist at Ma 
 You know the don spittin' nothin' but nice 
 Ah freeze Ma please ain't nothing but ice 
 {You nasty Ray you nasty you nasty Ray you nasty} 
 [Benzino]: 
 In the DJ booth with my dawg 2-time 
 Smokin' on a J while he play Busta Rhymes 
 Hep's over there with a bunch of dimes 
 We don't go to bed till the sun rise 
 Up in the club hands on her butt 
 V.I.P. I keep Chris in my cup 
 See my peeps they call state kid it up 
 See that beat my beat state grit it up 
 Yellow City Benzino Yellow man and we did it again 
 {You nasty Ray you nasty}
