 [Benzino]:

 Gucci print Air Force with your sneakers on 
 Hair done phat streaks twist black and blonde 
 Throw a song on mami get her groove on 
 Prada lace black blouse with a matching thong 
 Pretty face in the place what you sittin' for 
 Once you wind up on your waist what you hittin for 
 Glitter on your face seven karats on you face 
 Caged out Cartiers Zino stay glowin' 
 Price tag I don't care you niggas ain't knowin' 
 Where we goin' with this breathe how we flowin with this 
 What we doin' with this breathe where we movin with this 
 Top down in the front vallet don't front

 Navy blue with Sean John G suit 
 This time with the camel ten quarter Timb boot 
 Ma you know my resume take you to a better place 
 Skip the line first class when we get away 
 Baby always smellin good honey always yellin' hood 
 Blue Coupe deuce time threes now it's really good 
 Shoes beat deuce threes now it's really hood 
 Blue jeans lately now I'm feelin' you 
 Got me goin' crazy I mean I'm feelin' you 
 Plus I'm screamin out your names in the interviews 
 Oh where we goin' with this breathe how we flowin with this 
 What we doin' with this breathe where we movin with this 
 Slap a bolly on your wrist when I ice you 
 N 5-5 in the garage when I wife you 
 [Benzino]:

 Incense heave scents drum towers hit the light 
 Mamasita wanna ride me oh seniorita wanna wind it 
 Strapped up in the Versace bedspread 
 Let's do the damn thing baby Zino do the damn thing 
 Where we goin' with this breathe how we flowin with this 
 Where we goin' with this breathe where we movin with this 
 Got you in my hideout let me find out turn you wide out
