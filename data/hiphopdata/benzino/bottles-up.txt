Yeah, yeah Storch 
 That's what I'm talkin' about, my nigga 
 Bottles and up, BS what up, nigga? 
 Bottles and up, no's and G's know 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 The club, shorty what get buck 
 The club, real G's roll up 
 The club, fight it out get drunk 
 The club, act wild, tear it up 
 Introducin' the nemesis, you've heard of me 
 Into the rebel, the legend, the rock the party took me to a new level 
 I'm a bad motherfucka, stones colored, illuminatin' 
 Roll up to the joint and the girls love it, the niggas hate it 
 Unstoppable, position myself to get cheddar 
 Incredible with these lyrics, I'm only gettin' better 
 I'm on a sour, my niggas, we poppin' vouf man 
 Don't want no bottles for niggas, you 'bout to lose, man 
 Buyin' bottles for brodies, you know it's nothin', dawg 
 Crush you something later fo sho, she breakin' somethin' off 
 Soon as zino step through the door she got it jumpin' off 
 Grab your chick and head to the floor, I'm callin' all the dawgs 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 The club, shorty what get buck 
 The club, real G's roll up 
 The club, fight it out get drunk 
 The club, act wild, tear it up 
 This one's for my niggas got felonies, we's haulin' at the bar 
 Throwin' Hypno and Henesie, she fuckin' with the hulk 
 We continue to roll and blow the best trees 
 Puff an ounce in the club, lookin' for sour D's 
 Plus downin' bottles of bub like it was ice tea, only bottles and up 
 That's if you like me, you got keys [unverified] 
 Fellin' lucky like a Celtics clover, lil' spit, lil' flip 
 Now the game is over, I'm on a mission ain't finished until I'm done 
 Make the crowd move wild like I'm bustin' the gun 
 Everybody hallucinatin', somebody set it off 
 You're callin' security, now it's 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 The club, shorty what get buck 
 The club, real G's roll up 
 The club, fight it out get drunk 
 The club, act wild, tear it up 
 (Bottles and up) 
 Apologies are never accepted, I'm on another level 
 Probably try to get me arrested because I'm so ghetto 
 So many victims of homicide accountable for only thorough niggas 
 Who want to ride or die with me 
 Poured a bottle out for homies who ain't here 
 Incarcerated niggas with numbers be gettin' mad years 
 I'm number 34, beyond all the glory 
 I'm the truth like the 'E! True Hollywood Stories', nigga 
 Zino king of the city, I'm 'bout to lock it down 
 Silly rap get smacked, let's get it poppin' now 
 Big dawg and I dop it the best 
 I'm in the club with a code million debt on my chest 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky 
 My niggas don't dance 'cause we all gettin' high 
 Semi in the waist, two-steppin' on the side 
 Keep gettin' money till the day that I die 
 The club, shorty what get buck 
 The club, real G's roll up 
 The club, fight it out get drunk 
 The club, act wild, tear it up 
 Bottles and up 
 Boston get it poppin' 
 Bottles and up 
 MIA get it poppin' 
 Bottles and up 
 New York get it poppin' 
 Ounces and up 
 LA get it poppin' 
 Bottles and up
