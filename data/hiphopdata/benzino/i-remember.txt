[Mario Winans]: 
 Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Oh baby 
 [Benzino]: 
 I remember when we had to keep it on the low 
 Flew you everywhere so nobody would know 
 And I remember when we got stuck in the storm one night 
 (Remember that) pulled over hopped out had a snowball fight 
 I remember havin' so much fun 
 Like fuckin' on the beach waitin for the sun 
 I understand when they say love hurts 
 So let's get it like we had it and make this love work 
 Mario 
 Chorus [Mario Winans]: 
 Yeah Oh I remember when we started this star 
 Hey girl you know that we belong together 
 So glad admit to mine forever 
 And love no matter what you'll never give it up 
 [Benzino]: 
 We used to shit like catch a flick 
 Sit back in the Roll hug and kiss 
 We used to pillow fight always makin' a mess 
 Everything's so right never feeling stress 
 We used to walk the mall shop all day 
 We used to watch movies at the crib all day 
 We used to talk it out instead of throwin' things 
 We used to pass Jacob's to steam the rings 
 Bumpin Brandy on repeat it's revealed to me 
 You my angel in disguise and it's real to me 
 Now it's clear to see it's on destiny 
 So let's get this back how it's suppose to be 
 My love 
 Baby I know we can make it happen 
 First let's get it back to where it started 
 Baby 
 [Benzino]: 
 I thought you said I had a special place in your heart 
 I thought nothin' in the world would tear us apart 
 You always said you understood what I did 
 I told you from the start I had to handle my biz 
 I can't believe you wanna act this way 
 After all we've been through you wanna throw it away 
 See I'm forever yours I gotta make it happen 
 And I just wanna get it back to where we had it 
 I love you
