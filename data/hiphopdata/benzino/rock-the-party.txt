 Checkin' in the closet for my blue Velour suit 
 Piping all around it wit the matchin' Timb boots 
 Hop up in the wagon wit the 20 inch shoes on... (oh) 
 Riding down the street wit a twenty G stack 
 Shorty paging me saying "Zino where you at?" 
 Look up in the mirror five all up on my back it's... uh oh 
 Pull up in the spot smoking in the parking lot 
 Everybody having fun niggas don't stop 
 Pray to God that I don't have to let the guns pop it's... 
 Maybe all the ladies wanna chill wit Benz and Hef 
 Pushing up the bottle till there's no more Heny left 
 Step it up to Louie now let's see what happens next... yo

 Lookin' at the shorty wit the Frankie B Jeans 
 Thong hangin' out, butterfly belly ring 
 Butter leather boots with the tassles that's mean... (oh) 
 Got up on that ass when she came up in the door 
 Rock it to the beat then we took it to the floor 
 DJ in the club spinnin' record back and forth {*scratching*} 
 People going hard cause you know the mood is right 
 Everybody screaming like they at a Tyson fight 
 Young Hef in the back wit a dime lookin' tight, oh-my, oh 
 Hit the sour diesel mami bouncin' on my lap 
 VIP crowded so I take it to the back 
 Up in the code room where you find Zino at, and Mario too 
 Yo (now everybody just)

 Then leave the party to the after party y'all... (oh)

 Whatchu waitin' for? mami get your ass in! 
 Hop up in the coupe, girls riding wit my friend 
 "Y-y-y-y-yo, y'all follow us, follow us" 
 Rollin' through the city wit the CD on blast 
 Pull up at the mansion had to dip up in the stack (yeah) 
 Scene lookin' sexy shorty got a fat ass, oh-my-God 
 Step up in the place everybody gettin' wet 
 Sweatin' on the floor dancin' like they havin' sex 
 Poppin' Champagne taking bottles to the neck, uh uh uh, yeah (c'mon) 
 Lookin' at my Jacob it's about that time 
 Suns comin' up 'bout to close the blinds (yeah)
