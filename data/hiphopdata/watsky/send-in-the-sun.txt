Send in that sunshine 
 Make everything right 
 Turn on your love light 
 'Cause baby I'm coming on by 
 Send in that sunshine 
 Make everything right 
 'Cause there ain't no suffering in life 
 That don't ease with the passage of time 
 If stars died of old age 
 They wouldn't explode, they'd burn out with a slow fade 
 But stars escape life with a gun shot 
 Which makes me think they stick a pistol in their sun spot 
 Bite the barrel, squeeze the trigger 
 Might have cared once, but the obstacles seem bigger 
 And they're stuck behind a giant 8 ball 
 The milky way is star brains that are smeared across the space wall 
 You know the red giant in sector two? 
 Yeah, Hector, true, he was a depressing dude 
 I think he thought nobody thought about him 
 And now that I think about it, I'm liable to guess it's true 
 Everybody wants the sun to come and cure their rough moods but suns need love too 
 I give out energy and don't receive. I'm tired now, I'll go to sleep 
 And when this is the coldest solstice, maybe folks'll notice me 
 Goodbye Maggie, Goodbye Jules 
 I wish you'd stuck around, you wise fools 
 'Cause friends they tend to come and go 
 The way the ocean ebbs and flows but there's reminders in the tide pools 
 But when the standing water's putrid 
 Who am I to say a choice you made was stupid? 
 There's a bunch of us who loved you 
 Fucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did 
 You you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase 
 You you you went away forever to a new place 
 You left behind a lot of blue faces and bouquets and loose ends like shoelaces 
 But my friend, it's too late 
 So all my lightweights and barflies, let's raise a pint each time a star dies 
 And toast the memory of hard lives
