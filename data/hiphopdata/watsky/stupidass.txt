If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 And step into the past (way back) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 I was a stupidass (dumbass) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 I might have a weak chin, but I don't have a glass jaw 
 So watch your fist glance off my cheek skin and back off 
 I cut my teeth on the blacktop, I'm used to something cruel 
 'Cause in my youth, my tooths were crowded as the public schools 
 Where we moved above the rules 
 Where the currency was percocets 
 Where I showed up early rocking headgear and turtlenecks 
 This nerd'll flex and you won't see this man pout 
 'Cause the traits that got us beat down, are what make us stand out 
 So let your tongue hang out if you got lips like Mick Jagger 
 Plant and stand proud with that little kid swagger 
 The subtle it factor of the baddest individuals 
 'Cause adamant originals don't end up in pigeon holes 
 Which gets my thinking it's a damn shame dorks 
 Don't pop their pimples like they're champagne corks 
 I work the quirks, 'cause if I didn't start sloppily 
 I'd never clean up this cotdamn properly 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 And step into the past (way back) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 I was a stupidass (dumbass) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 I never threw like Elway 
 Or overthrew like El Che 
 So I moved to LA, to the land of milk and self hate 
 But one day, I'll strip and then strut buck down 
 The sunset strip as it was a runway 
 I'm thinking maybe Sunday 
 And if you need sensei for sexy, just text me. 
 I stay by San Vicente and La Brea where the rent's cheap 
 So you can't tempt me, with a Beamer, Benz or Bentley 
 That's complete with penis envy, and even keyless entry 
 'Cause see, I'm making ends meet, so care to be friendly? 
 And make ends meet? In my backseat in an awkward frenzy 
 Once in a parking lot while practicing anatomy 
 I was knocking elbows till the music zapped the battery 
 And dammit it was bad but I'm not mad I brought my A game 
 Even we sat there naked the man from Triple A came 
 And it was way lame, but I've got on good authority 
 She boldly told the sordid story to her whole sorority 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 And step into the past (way back) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 I was a stupidass (dumbass) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 Some days I wake up and I wonder 'what would Buddha do?' 
 And then I jump into my fruity little Subaru 
 Some dudes'll front 'how do you do, mama?' 
 Because some women see the mula, and say 'ooh lala' 
 But I say 'woo-sah' 
 I don't smooch on muchachas who need mucha 
 To mooch off. I'm cool for like a futon out in Utah 
 A yurt up in the Yukon 
 When hurtin' I'll go back to herding wild yaks in Bhutan 
 Or cop a coupe with coupons 
 But when you get a F.U.P.A. like a dugong 
 I'll treat you supa dupa we can't do wrong 
 'Cause beauty is a dude who puts the moves on, then moves on 
 We're all moving as true pawns 
 And get chewed in the food chain 
 We're all nude in the new dawn 
 Brain screwed on 
 With a plain birthday suit on 
 So let's graduate human, summa kumbayah, huge honors 
 So you goners should do the do and do wander the blue yonder 
 'Cause trying to fool the future takes too long 
 I don't know quite where I'm going, but I'm on my way 
 I won't look over my shoulder, back at yesterday 
 I know that I'm getting older, a little bit grey 
 But I won't turn my face to look 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 And step into the past (way back) 
 I'd do it all again (again) 
 If I could go back then (back then) 
 If I could go back when (back when) 
 I was a stupidass (dumbass) 
 I'd do it all again (again)
