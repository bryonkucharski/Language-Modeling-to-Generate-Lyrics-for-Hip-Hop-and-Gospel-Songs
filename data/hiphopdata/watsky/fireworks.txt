It's hard to be living 
 You gotta play the cards you were given 
 You think it's simple but it goddamn isn't 
 It's tougher now than breaking out of Shawshank prison 
 And as you're hittin your prime 
 People say you been committing a crime 
 But I won't quit till I'm home 
 I'll chip the limestone a bit at a time 
 Wait! I'm a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male 
 I won't have an alibi the day I fail 
 'Cause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail 
 In a [boom-boom] heartbeat 
 Mom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back 
 And I gotta thank 'em for loving me 
 From the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat 
 When I needed a pep talk 
 I couldn't remember to wreck shop 
 Writer's block, staring at my laptop desktop 
 Or sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop 
 Shit in storage, living from a suitcase 
 Thinking "this is how a silver spoon tastes?" 
 'Cause you can make a dream possible 
 But it'll never be easy, no matter what you chase 
 If you wanna poke fun then do so 
 I'll do it for you, it's no crime 
 I'm like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme [Ooh!] 
 So tell me that I'm not a rapper 
 Tell Rudolph he can't pull sleighs 
 Tell Pluto it's not a planet 
 And he'll probably keep spinning in the same old way 
 On and on, every day 
 Right around the sun, wanna feel the rays 
 You do it 'cause you love it like nothing else in the universe 
 And fuck it, it's embedded in your DNA
