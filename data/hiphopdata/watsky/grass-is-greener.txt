Here, take my career 
 Give her your health 
 Let me have the love you share 
 I've been alone for a long time 
 Picked the faint praise of strangers 
 Over one who truly cares 
 He keeps the faith in a dark room 
 Fingers twitching like moth wings 
 Hoping to matter 
 But he can't see how he matters to you 
 You can't drink wine or coffee 
 And you're stuck with a body 
 That fights each small request you make 
 I got that brown grass dogs come pee on 
 Your grass so bright it's neon 
 Green and tie-dye and grows a mile high 
 We'll be betrayed by the seeds that we sow 
 Tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below 
 Your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow 
 You with the crumbling hips 
 She sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists 
 In these miles of highway 
 You're the prettiest pileup that I've ever glimpsed 
 I'm lost in the awful withdrawals 
 Grass seems much greener beyond these old walls 
 But my worries so small 
 When I walk through those hospital halls 
 Here, take my career 
 Give her your health 
 Let me have the love you share 
 I've been alone for a long time 
 Picked the faint praise of strangers 
 Over one who truly cares 
 He keeps the faith in a dark room 
 Fingers twitching like moth wings 
 Hoping to matter 
 But he can't see how he matters to you 
 You can't drink wine or coffee 
 And you're stuck with a body 
 That fights each tiny prayer you whisper to yourself 
 The tiny prayers you whisper to yourself 
 Tiny prayer you whisper to yourself
