And the moral of the story is 
 And the moral of the story is 
 (Work!) till your arms fall off 
 Till your abs get hard and your bone's all soft 
 (Just work!) till your hands go numb 
 And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb 
 I write till my fingers look like a bouquet of roses 
 You gotta bring yourself your flowers now in show biz 
 Focus it's Quiet Coyote come on let's go kids 
 Everybody get together with a study buddy 
 And then talk about the fuck that I don't give 
 Because it's so big and explosive 
 But a lotta people don't live, they don't ever get a motive 
 If you got a goal you gotta hold onto what hope is 
 If I didn't have it I would ask you where the rope is 
 Work is my church and so the studio's the closest 
 I spit it sick until my cootie flow's the grossest 
 Don't be so pissed just be focused on your own shit 
 'Cause we Supercalifornialisticsexyandweknowsit 
 You're not my biness, I go for number one, not a top five finish 
 You can have a chicken pot pie 
 But I'm thinking that I'm gonna have another can of Popeye's spinach 
 I'm Rottweiler, pop my collar when I pop my fur 
 You're on my nerves, but mark my words 
 Gotta put a leg up and then mark my turf 
 Work until I'm black and yellow black and yellow, worker bee 
 I just work until I'm black and blue and burgundy 
 Burgundy, work until I earn that rich mahogany 
 Honestly, can't you tell I'm working, bitch don't bother me 
 Show some modesty, if you're watching me 
 A bitch is anybody in my way it's not misogyny 
 But if yer blockin' me I will soon defeat you 
 I will build a bridge above you, or I'll tunnel underneath you 
 I will eat you and excrete you and I'll feed you to the flowers 
 If I need to I'll go through you and absorb your fucking powers 
 I put in hour after hour let's be crystal clear 
 I'm gonna get there if it takes a day or fifty years 
 I'll fingerbang my fears, I'll fucking punch a dragon 
 Even with the Himalayas in my way it's gonna happen 
 'Cause waiting doesn't work, and praying may not come through 
 And hoping doesn't work. So I will be the one to (work) 
 And maybe someday you might see me in a glossy photo 
 No weirdo's rocked the bells as hard as me since Quasimodo
