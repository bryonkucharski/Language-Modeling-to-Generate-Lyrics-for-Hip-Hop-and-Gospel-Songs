Chorus (Passion) (2X) 
 I got this love (3X) 
 Because because because because 
 Because of Jonestown 
 Because of Auschwitz 
 Because the leaves fall, and we can't stop it 
 But that makes fall leaves, 
 I'ma start a mosh pit 
 (Ch!) this is your captain 
 Hopping out the the cockpit 
 I forgot my parachute 
 But I got my bay sounds 
 So I'll be going dummy

 For the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony 
 Who hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani 
 For those lay waste to beauty with a straight face 
 Everywhere on earth we're all escaping from the same place 
 And yes occasionally we get drunk and out of line 
 And last night, there's a lamp post that I asked to be my valentine 
 Take a shady place, shine until it radiates 
 Seventeen to eighty eight, make a break and head west 
 Or make a promise to your lady in a red dress 
 Last night in my hot mess 
 That lamp post said yes 
 Detroit is equal till there's half its people laid off 
 While corporate lawyers and former employers play golf 
 Because of furor over every juror paid off 
 And because the f
