Yesterday I signed my first tit 
 Soft with the pen because I didn't want to burst it 
 I did it cursive. I took my sweet time 
 I tried to put my personality in each line 
 Like I do with each rhyme 
 'Cause in the worst case 
 That's what put this bust in my custody in the first place 
 Now I'm rounding first base, cruising 'cause I paid dues 
 Dude, I called my roommates and I gave them all the great news 
 They're pitiless 
 But so many nights up at the motel 6, tittyless 
 After gigs with hideously small crowds 
 It's been 5 years of playing colleges in small towns 
 I'm through with all doubt 
 I'm ready to bloom from wallflower 
 And just ball out 
 And live my fantasy 
 And if I get my name on a Grammy it's for my family 
 But for me I just can't top the memory of my John Hancock on that mammary 
 Why are we 
 Shy to be 
 Who we all would like to be? 
 Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see 
 Although you 
 Can't undo 
 All the pain that you've been through 
 Write your name 
 Write your name 
 Write your name 
 The future's here, and it's tangible 
 And kind of spongy 
 I'm a commie but I love my fucking country right now 
 Just let play the Fillmore and die now 
 I couldn't give a damn about who's raising an eyebrow 
 I thought I'd failed, I prayed for so long 
 God said "no way, " but I'm all like, 'come on' 
 And he's all like "okay" 
 And at first I'm all like "don't play" 
 But then I'm all like "hooray!" 
 And I grabbed that baton 
 And ran like a Cavs fan, away from Lebron 
 Now they gab about me in banks and salons 
 And they're mad to admit it, but pale kid's the bomb 
 From anonymous geek 
 To Don Juan in a week 
 And I'm calm 
 But if ever I seem gloomy 
 I can't stress enough how much this means to me 
 I held the tears in, 'cause I didn't dare to dream 
 Of the most beauteous booby I've ever seen 
 Why are we 
 Shy to be 
 Who we all would like to be? 
 Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see 
 Although you 
 Can't undo 
 All the pain that you've been through 
 Write your name 
 Write your name 
 Write your name 
 Right now 
 Right right right right on my command 
 The world is a booby that's in the palm of my hand
