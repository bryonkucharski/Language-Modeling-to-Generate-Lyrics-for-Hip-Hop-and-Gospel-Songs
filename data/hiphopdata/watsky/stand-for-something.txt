Never been the one to play it cool 
 I never been a fan of fancy shoes 
 I only want to stand for something 
 I don't care if they approve 
 They don't know what I've been through 
 I only want to stand for something 
 What was I thinking when I headed to SoCal? 
 Everybody gotta order the low-cal or no-cal meal 
 I don't even enjoy guilt 
 I think the city turned my semen to soymilk 
 But I'm a motherfuckin hypocrite 
 Acting like I never give a shit 
 But now I think about it maybe a tad bit 
 Cause pretty baby I be ready to admit 
 I'm thinking maybe I will never be Brad Pitt 
 Want the celebrity? You gotta be bat shit 
 To want to be a piece of meat, we treat 'em as cold cuts 
 But go nuts when we see 'em wiping their own butts 
 And the crowd goes wild 
 But we don't smile if you got no style 
 Gotta be kidding me, giving the pretty people the key to the city 
 I don't even know 
 We struttin 
 Ain't nobody gotta tell us nothing 
 Because a rose is a rose and I am what I am 
 And I wear it like campaign button 
 I don't want a side eye 
 I say bye bye 
 Roll up another one and hand me a Mai tai 
 Because the people who be running the show 
 Are kinda like the season how they come and they go 
 And we'll be living while they looking for parking 
 And we'll be digging while they woofing and barking 
 They kicking in the door and hoping to barge in 
 But this is what you get there's nothing to bargain 
 If it's a hundred to one and we're under the gun 
 I'm not gonna be groveling for the governor's pardon 
 Don't gotta suck in your gut if you want to guzzle a Bud 
 I'm about it baby, you can party with us
