They press our teardrops into diamonds 
 They change our sorrows into gold 
 They're gonna turn our blood to rubies 
 We just need someone we can hold 
 Got an issue but it's getting bigger and bigger 
 In the beginning it was something minor 
 Got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it 
 So we're bringing in a tiger 
 There's something inside her 
 Thought you were blissful 
 I heard you did it with a pink-handled pistol 
 But sadness, it tend to latch on 
 And it won't let go like a pitbull 
 Don't even know if you left a note 
 Should we blame the Depakote? 
 Or vilify the Abilify? 
 You were trying to find your vanilla sky 
 Then you unravel 
 Face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel 
 Because a human's so fragile. What can you do? 
 They press our teardrops into diamonds 
 They change our sorrows into gold 
 They're gonna turn our blood to rubies 
 We just need someone we can hold 
 They press our teardrops into diamonds 
 But they can't change our hearts to stone 
 They're gonna turn our blood to rubies 
 I know that we are not alone 
 I know it's sappy 
 But I want my family to be happy 
 Without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper 
 An army of zombies shuffling through a vapor 
 But I know folks who found something beautiful 
 And they credit the pharmaceuticals 
 For slaying the demons that they're running from 
 It might have saved their lives and I'm one of 'em 
 But there's a limit to the shit you can endure 
 You get a prescription and you're thinking that it's pure 
 But baby maybe it's a problem when you got a problem 
 And you get addicted to the cure 
 The spike ain't not mystery 
 We're any penny in a billion dollar industry 
 And there's a mothafucka on living on the hill pushing pills 
 Stacking bills off our misery 
 Had a teaspoon that's full of pain 
 Got an ocean that's full of sorrow 
 They press our teardrops into diamonds 
 They change our sorrows into gold 
 They're gonna turn our blood to rubies 
 We just need something we can hold 
 They press our teardrops into diamonds 
 But they can't change our hearts to stone 
 They're gonna turn our blood to rubies 
 I know that we are not alone 
 We are not alone
