Watsky? 
 I'm that dork up in the orchestra on oboe, trick 
 You're just trying to get some chickens on your pogo stick 
 But they'll be hopping off it when you stop the profiting 
 And then with no dough you'll be like a Dodo when you go extinct 
 I'm in San Francisco sipping on a boba drink 
 Tapioca in my palm I talk how Yoda thinks 
 The voice is so distinct 
 I like to write my rhymes with lemon juice 
 And so if you don't get it it's in coded ink 
 Better believe this 
 I'm ready to meet Jesus 
 Either him or Wilford Brimley when I die from Diabeetus 
 I've never been defeated since da fetus days 
 Lead the way 
 Raged out my momma's VJ, crazed and freed the slaves 
 Wait I take it back, that's racist and I'd need a time machine 
 I'm not pleased to be like T-Pain, a fleeting phase 
 But since My pre-Ks in PJs, I pre-date the Bieber craze 
 I've been rhyming crispier than Frito-Lays 
 Watsky!
