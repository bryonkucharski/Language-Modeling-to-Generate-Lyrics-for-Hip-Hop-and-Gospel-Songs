The first time I went back to homeroom from the hospital 
 I thought that being more embarrassed was impossible 
 But God, the second time it really turned my stomach 
 Now I'm the kid who collapses and then spazzes out in public 
 This time was a bowling alley, the first was in the yard 
 And kids in middle school just watched me trip and kicked me hard 
 Except this girl named Crissie Li, who flips around at her desk 
 And gives me the world's biggest Disney card 
 Wrote "best wishes," and "kisses" where she signed it 
 3 feet by 2 feet, I coulda hid behind it 
 I didn't like the pity from Christina Li though 
 I'm thinking "Crissie, can't you see I'm busy being emo?" 
 'Cause I think I mighta heard she maybe sorta liked me 
 And since she wasn't cool enough I guess I took it lightly 
 Had braces and glasses and wasn't Ms. Popular 
 And so I didn't really give a thought to her 
 A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping 
 It's the notes of the song that'll never happen 
 And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping 
 But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping 
 There's holes in my memory- it isn't photographic 
 There's holes in my yearbook but the cut-out folks were plastic 
 Ten years pass, I don't cross paths 
 With half the people from my class again 'til we meet at Crissie's open casket 
 Those who chose to ask it probably knew 
 I could have dug in deeper if I'd wanted to 
 But you couldn't tell a thing was off on the surface 
 And I didn't know she was sick until I heard about her service 
 She was born with a heart defect, used to the cold knife 
 She'd been in and out of hospitals her whole life 
 She knew the whole time, and never said why 
 She felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high 
 The nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis 
 Though I know it's crime to twist her life to fit my own devices 
 Why's it so hard to mourn, and then try to learn by this 
 But lights that burn shortest 
 Are the lights that burn brightest 
 A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping 
 It's the notes of the song that'll never happen 
 And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping 
 But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping 
 Our 8th grade yearbook page for dedicating songs wasn't long 
 Even in a school eleven hundred strong 
 The yearbook advertised for months, but when it's said and done 
 Crissie bought six, the third most of anyone 
 Alvin got "Your Faith in Me" by Jessica Simpson 
 Pebbles got Richard Marx's ballad "At the Beginning" 
 It feels like sloppy poetry the way her life would end 
 After sending Mariah Carrey's "Any Time You Need a Friend" 
 But corniness is honesty that's wrapped in cliché 
 And most slow jam lyrics aren't shit I'm brave enough to say without a smirk 
 But before she went to dirt she left us finally 
 "I Will Remember You" to Geoff, Mike, Bry and me 
 You can plot if you must 
 Say it's obviously fate, or explain that God is just 
 But all I know is that until my body's dust 
 I will try to think of her as much as Crissie thought of us 
 This one goes out to Christina
