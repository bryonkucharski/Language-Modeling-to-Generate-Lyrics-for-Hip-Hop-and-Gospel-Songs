Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job 
 Love you if you love a car for the road trips 
 Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar 
 Where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips 
 'Cause you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard 
 Right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp 
 And when you woke up, somebody was unclipping your seat belt 
 And pulling you from the open window of your flipped car 
 Cold pizza 
 Tie-dye shirts 
 Broken hearts 
 Give'm here, give'm here 
 Hand me downs 
 Give me give me leftovers 
 Give me give me sloppy seconds 
 Give 'em here, give 'em here 
 I don't care where you've been 
 How many miles, I still love you (2x) 
 Show me someone who says they got no baggage 
 I'll show you somebody whose got no story 
 Nothing gory means no glory, but baby please don't bore me 
 We won't know until we get there 
 The who, or the what, or the when where 
 My favorite sweater was a present that I got a couple presidents ago 
 And I promised that I would rock it till it's thread bare 
 Bet on it 
 Every single person got a couple skeletons 
 So pretty soon, in this room 
 It'll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants 
 Me and you and the elements 
 We all have our pitfalls 
 Beer's flat, the cabs have been called 
 And everybody and their momma can hear the drama that's happening behind these thin walls 
 I don't care where you've been 
 How many miles, I still love you (2x) 
 I don't care (cold pizza) 
 Where you've been (tie-dye shirts) 
 How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you 
 I don't care (hand me downs) 
 Where you've been (left overs) 
 How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you 
 My pattern with women isn't a flattering image 
 But I don't want to run away because I said so 
 I don't want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws 
 And I'll be giving you the side of me that I don't let show 
 Everything in fashion 
 That has ever happened 
 Always coming crashing down 
 Better let go 
 But in a couple years it will be retro 
 You rock Marc Ecko 
 My shirts have the gecko 
 'Cause in the past man, I was hopeless 
 But now's when my little cousins look the dopest 
 (Whoop whoop) 
 Fuck the fashion po-po 
 Have a stale doughnut, I don't need no tips 
 Fuck a five second rule 
 That's a plan I never understood 
 It's September in my kitchen in a Christmas sweater 
 Sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods 
 And there is not a single place that I would rather be 
 I'm fucked up just like you are, and you're fucked up just like me 
 I don't care where you've been 
 How many miles, I still love you (2x) 
 I don't care (cold pizza) 
 Where you've been (tie-dye shirts) 
 How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you 
 I don't care (hand me downs) 
 Where you've been (left overs) 
 How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you
