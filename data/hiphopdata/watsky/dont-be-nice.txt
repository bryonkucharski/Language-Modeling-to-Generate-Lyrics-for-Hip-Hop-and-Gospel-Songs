Don't be nice 
 My policy is to call 'em as I see 'em no filler 
 Quality people lift me up like the coliseum pillars 
 Some go from pitching religion to sipping on kombucha 
 Politicians switching positions like it's the Kama Sutra 
 Our narcissism has got us caught up like bars in prison 
 Claim we're winning gargling seven dicks and a jar of jizzum 
 Your mommas a true beauty 
 Butt makes me weep, I call it a "boo-hooty" 
 Truly a hot mom 
 Other moms are doing their squats wrong 
 And if you don't dig it when I spit it like an open spigot and I'm doing my duty 
 To drop bombs

 False modesty is a guilty habit 
 Some people simply have it 
 But the fact is I would not have spent a decade doing this 
 If I did not believe I was at least tiny bit ridiculously filthy at it 
 Wrote a book to branch out 
 After tour let's have a singalong and camp out 
 'Cause I came here for a single reason 
 And that's for friendship 
 And for drinking till I can't count-now 
 If you're Jesus then we break bread 
 If you're Beavis then we butt heads 
 If you're a butthead, or a fake friend 
 I smack ya back to Hollywood enough said 
 Skin scream jars 
 Thin teen stars 
 Wanna hear a laugher? 
 A white rapper walks into 16 bars 
 I am large, I contain multitudes 
 I'm in charge of a strange cult of dudes 
 Infinity versions of me in parallel universes from total teddy bear to ultra rude 
 True, I don't measure power by bravado, libido 
 Or by popping bottles with Hefner in the grotto in speedos 
 I'm never sharing my moscato if you suck like mosquito 
 So "open up" said the taco to the burrito, motherfucker 
 Don't be nice, don't be nice 
 Drop all the fuckery, stop it you ugly ignoramus 
 Don't be nice, don't be rude and brainless 
 Don't be super basic 
 Don't move if you're contagious 
 Don't be nice la-la-la-la-la 
 Don't be nice I'm not listening 
 Don't be nice, don't be nice 
 Got nothing nice to say then-don't be nice 
 Gather the wicked to sacrifice 
 Sucking the dick of the antichrist 
 Kicking the bucket is vital to life I know that's the price 
 Don't be candy striped 
 Don't be parasites 
 Don't do me dirty 
 Don't think you're worthy 
 Don't hurt me 
 Mercy is not a courtesy currently that occurs to me 
 I turn up eternally, you will not stop it 
 True my crew hotter than hot pockets 
 (This dude Watsky too cocky, let's cock block it) 
 We do what we do because it's true to us 
 While few puppets in suits up at the top profit 
 And if you got a new coup then I do not knock it 
 But I bukkake your Bugatti with snot rockets
