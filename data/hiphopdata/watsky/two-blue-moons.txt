The moon is out tonight (it's bright) 
 Is everything all right? (not quite) 
 I wouldn't act like I know (no) know (no) know (no) know (no) know 
 Just what you're going through (no shit) 
 But if you're feeling blue (don't quit) 
 I want to tell you my brother I feel same way too 
 A couple red sons popping out a new womb 
 Twins come twice once in a blue moon 
 Feeling a like a joke in the nude rude humor 
 We were born premature, and they said "too soon" 
 Sing a new tune, act less fickle 
 Most twins cling like a pair of testicles 
 We haven't been tight since we breast fed little 
 Said, me on the right, and you on the left nipple 
 Said it's that simple. have to discover if you act a bit smothered 
 When you're trapped with big brother 
 9 long months kicking it inside our mother 
 Never kicked her belly, hell we only kicked each other 
 If we suffer I'll be sentimental when we grow 
 Get born, ready go, got a separate embryo 
 Breaking like a levy though, wading through the heavy flow 
 When you see light let me know, bro 
 There were weeks you can bet I couldn't eat 
 Lookin' at the cooking with a set of wooden teeth 
 Opened up my big mouth, found that I could speak 
 So put another foot in it but now I couldn't leave 
 It's good to see all the losers taking days 
 To think of dumping shit on you in new creative ways 
 You can say that it's a phase 
 Or some rude complaining crap 
 It's a stupid way to act, man 
 But two can play at that 
 I been a brat, had more than one slip 
 My lips got unzipped, I quipped some dumb shit 
 Our folks were so sick, it made them cringe 
 I followed my jaw's lead, and came unhinged 
 I'm sorry, can the shit end here? 
 We haven't really talked in about ten years 
 And that's ten too many 'cause if you were anyone else 
 I wouldn't see you in myself 
 Aching in the chest, try to take it from the stress 
 Shrink made me quit, I was making him depressed 
 Usually I'm upbeat, tearing through the halls 
 But instead of bouncing off 'em I was staring at the walls 
 Care to make the call which separates faster 
 A fence of placenta, an inch made of plaster 
 A handful of strands of our DNA 
 Either we both were alone or it seemed that way 
 Kept to myself, I'd reflect by myself 
 Dude, I left and I fucking saw shrek by myself 
 It's no help to assume we're less than 
 To mom it's yes ma'am, I groom you'll best man 
 It's on the next fam to plan and proceed 
 But if we smoke weed, don't think we OD'd 
 No I don't know, all the shit you've been through 
 But I've seen a window, and I know I've been too
