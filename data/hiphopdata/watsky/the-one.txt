Everywhere I look it seems like everybody's pairing off 
 I'm staring at the pairs like they were tits on Lara Croft 
 Even all the dogs I see are clicking so terrific 
 Picking out their favorite puppy's ass to sniff and stickin' with it 
 All the faker single ladies twerkin' to Beyoncé 
 Every single one of 'em is somebody's fiancée 
 You never spilled your guts. You wanted your say 
 Wait a couple years and try again when they're divorcees 
 All the gentlemen are trynna get the pussy, wanna make that pelvis scream 
 But when I hit it and I quit it then it never really helps my self-esteem 
 We want some tonsil hockey, but we got hecka cocky 
 Overfished the ocean, so we're running low on tekka maki 
 Sushi douchey dudes are saying 'do me' but we're doomed 
 We run away from keepers and go creepin' on the goons 
 Most men and women full of crap, need a laxative 
 Want the ass when I'm waxin it, Uncle Sam how I'm taxin it 
 Do a backflip and try to land in it, then abandon it, pretty soon we're back to 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4 
 I don't believe in "the one" 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4 
 There's no such thing as "the one" 
 Wonderland is where I'll find an Alice who is radical 
 But I'm drunk on Facebook now and diving down that rabbit hole 
 Checkin' on my ex and soon I'm creepin' on her lover 
 And when the picture buffers I see her new boyfriend's buffer than me 
 Got those upper pecs his fuckin' V-neck couldn't cover 
 My dick is pretty lonely but my nuts still got each other 
 I suffer, suffer from a habit, yes I'm an addict 
 But someone else is out there, it's just simple mathematics 
 There's over 7 billion mothafuckas on the planet and 4 billion of us are of legal age 
 That's 2 billion ladies, 4 billion tittays, and I bet a couple of 'em aren't engaged 
 And I get it you've been looking for the one but they been running trynna hide like Kony 
 And you're gonna find 'em if you're getting back into the saddle, baby ride that pony 
 And if you never get over that early lover then it sucks for you 
 Gotta admit that it's difficult to be watching her with him but everybody want a love that's true 
 I'm waiting, batin' patiently, yo I'm a catch 
 I'm losing my head, playing musical beds, and looking for "the one" that match 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4 
 I don't believe in "the one" 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4 
 There's no such thing as "the one"
