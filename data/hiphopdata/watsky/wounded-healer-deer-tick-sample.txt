His footprints are fading away from the beach 
 We're not a family to pray or to preach 
 But daddy's best friend took a handful of pills 
 And now he's at a podium making a speech 
 Yesterday night after dark 
 He carefully wrote his remarks 
 But everyone said what he put on his page 
 So he threw it way and went straight from the heart 
 I thought this was a party 
 But all my friends are leaving 
 And I still want to play 
 You wrecked me when you stepped out 
 'Cause you're the wounded healer 
 And you're supposed to stay 
 A year's a bottle in a bucket of trash 
 It'll tip over the more that it stacks 
 Didn't notice it till now 
 But dad's been moving slower every time we play go play catch 
 I'm scared of the day when he'll carry a cane 
 I carry his dream 
 I carry his name 
 And when papa is gone he will never be gone 
 Because the sound of our sneeze is the same 
 God bless I 
 Hear your voice 
 In mine 
 I want to stop time 
 Like a carnival ride 
 Because 
 I don't know what I'm saying but I mean it 
 I thought this was a party 
 But all my friends are leaving 
 And I still want to play 
 You wrecked me when you stepped out 
 'Cause you're the wounded healer 
 And you're supposed to stay 
 I thought this was a party 
 But all my friends are leaving 
 And I still want to play 
 You wrecked me when you stepped out 
 'Cause you're the wounded healer 
 And you're supposed to stay
