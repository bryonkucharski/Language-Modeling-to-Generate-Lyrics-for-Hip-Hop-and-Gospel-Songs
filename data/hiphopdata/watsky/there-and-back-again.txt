Sometimes I think I'm too honest 
 But to be honest I'm sick, I'm bubonic 
 But less black than the plague which is vague 
 'Cause the Black Plague as a name's kinda ironic 
 In that most black folks don't actually kill 
 Entire populations of European people or move chronic 
 Who said they move chronic? 
 Were you away 'cause 
 'Cause if you ever smoked bud you know trees 
 Make you cough like the plague does 
 I hold my smoke in, toke up 
 Lightweight Yankee you'd faint from a baby buzz 
 Fuck you random English guy, take a long nap 
 This my song. Begone, move along chap 
 Bugger 
 Yeah, that's right, walk away bitch 
 Remember what my name is (Watsky) 
 Good, now that square dude is gone we can party 
 Let's get some Mardis Gras beads, weed and bacardi 
 The weed's gone, that British nobleman smoked our shit 
 And no one noticed it 
 Who cares bro, I party sober, I'm over it 
 I'm with my dogs yo, my dobermans at In N Out 
 Feeling dope and shit 
 It's a local thing I get the cheese fries 
 Then go home for a Boca Burger and a mocha drink 
 I go to Yogurtland 
 I'm blowing smoke rings and speeding in the fast lane yodelling 
 Road soda tucked in the lap of the kid riding shotgun 
 When the cops roll past motioning 
 For us to pull over but I don't, I roll through a toll booth 
 And then do donuts in the shoulder, knowing I'm the Sofa King 
 I won't brag 
 But believe me, I know swag 
 I'm feeling so sav 
 My friends in the backseat follow our police chase 
 Live on the plasma screen Headrest TVs that I don't have 
 They warn me about the spike strips I swerve 
 And I fly through the burbs, but then I hit the curb 
 And my tire pops 
 I flee on foot but get tired stop 
 And invite the the firefighters and the night cops out to iHop 
 This is the life, homie, why knock it 
 I get high fives when I pop the top off my beer bottle with my eye socket 
 And I'll be fine 
 I'm bleeding but the best beer goggles is to be blind 
 Is this seat taken? 
 Is that you British fool? 
 I can't see shit, but know there's a seat vacant 
 It's me 
 Well sit down dude, there's mad room 
 We just got food, but there's bound to be round two
