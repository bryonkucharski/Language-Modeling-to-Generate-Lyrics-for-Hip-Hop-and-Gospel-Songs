I ain't afraid, I'm the man, I'm the great 
 I laugh in the face of danger 
 I'm on the edge so you best be prepared 
 There's something in the air, it's danger 
 I never cared, lions, tigers and bears 
 I ain't scared, you can bring that danger 
 If you want to survive, better stay on your side 
 Or you're putting yourself in danger 
 I drive a hooptie, not a Humvee 
 My bed's hella comfy 
 Sometimes I get hella clumsy 
 You more He-Man, me more Gumby 
 You more Bun B, trill 
 Me more One Tree Hill 
 Me Will 
 You Uncle Phil 
 I'm nothing but a punk with skills 
 If that's confusing, then I'd like to ask you humbly chill 
 Cause last I checked, it was a fucking free country still 
 I'm so hungry. It's time for din din 
 We do our thing thing 
 All we do it win win win 
 And then draw some 
 Because I fight with my friends, and my friends like to win and they're awesome 
 And if you cross em 
 Well then you crossed me 
 And you better watch out 
 'Cause if you watch me 
 You know I fight to the last for my fam and my friends are my fam so a friend is a Watsky 
 I never pack switch blade (Danger) 
 But in the middle of the night I run a black ops fridge raid 
 Jackpot, man, never play the good cop 
 When I'm at the kitchen door negotiating push pops 
 I just got here. watch your boy stay 
 Stepped in the building and I'm chilling in the foyer 
 Oy vey. man I'm colder than the South Pole 
 I don't give a damn if it's a no-shoes household 
 This bonehead's in his PRO-Keds from outset 
 That's why I stay grounded like a three-prong outlet 
 It's how I pull off looking like a Boy Scout, yet 
 I'm rocking sneakers that are cleaner than a moist towelette 
 And yes, my rider calls for Grey Goose and Applejacks 
 It's how I rose so fast from the cabbage patch 
 I use some four letter curses, and then I drop a triple word score that'll scrape you in a Scrabble match 
 Here comes lover lover, on some other ish 
 Quick to blow up like a pufferfish 
 The toughest puppet with 
 Purple plush stitched in my flesh 
 Snuffaluffagus up in this bitch 
 On some raw rubber ducky shit 
 And you muggles mean mugging 
 Better cut it quick 
 Chuck another diss, and then pucker lips 
 Kiss my voluptuous hips 
 And then button it 
 Stopping fuckery's on my bucket list 
 And I like monsters under beds, But I'm a kitties and puppies man 
 Slap that peppermint frap from a yuppie's hand 
 Didn't clean my room. I puff the magic dragon 
 So go ahead and stuff me in the paddy wagon 
 You dilly-dallied while I called shots 
 I'm not babyfaced, my beard's got bald spots 
 Fresh mind, mentos for my mental 
 Fuck the #2, I use a #1 pencil
