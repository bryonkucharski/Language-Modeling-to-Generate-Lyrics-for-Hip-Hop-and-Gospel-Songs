Back in the day 
 Daddy would say 
 That if I kept on making ugly faces 
 And I wasn't careful it'd stay that way 
 Oh great! Wow, no shit 
 Ooh, hooray, that's so sick! [Ooh! Ack! Brrrr] 
 With a little bit of luck maybe one of those sticks 
 I'll be feeling a hella of a lot of swell 
 And from the second that I step in I'll be smelling like a big cheese 
 Everybody better be ready to get it get it 
 'Cause I'm getting nekkid if you really want a strip tease 
 And the babies in their highchairs taking off their bibs 
 And their mommies all be ripping out their wig weaves 
 And the pretty people in the oil paintings on the wall 
 Are popping molly and they're stripping off their fig leaves 
 Better burn your clothes 
 It'll curl your toes 
 Kissing women and they turn to toads 
 I'm pimping Kermit's hoes 
 And I'm sure that every girl is a pearl and the world is a perfect globe 
 But when I'm joking with my little cousin 
 And he pulls my finger then the motherfuckin' earth explodes 
 Boom. 
 Sorry, not sorry (x7) 
 Everybody been in it to win it kickin' in for a minute 
 And chilling but you're tardy it's why I gotta kill it 
 And then hit the pretty people in the building with my party trick 
 I think I'm gonna walk out of the door 
 Hop in my DeLorean and I'm gonna soar 
 'Cept that it's a Subaru, and I'm yelling hoodie hoo! 
 Hanging out the window like I'm Marty McFly 
 A lot of the chickens in the flock wanna squawk and they get obnoxious 
 And all I hear is bawk bawk 
 And I'm not gonna wanna talk shop 
 Better put a sock in it if you gotta cock block 
 And be toxic and knock us and all we wanna do is rock rock and be raucous 
 I'm not gonna ever stop if you think I'm chopped liver in the crock pot 
 'Cause I am a boss hog and I want the top spot and I got this
