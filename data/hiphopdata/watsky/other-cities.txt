There's nothin' like the feeling of the plane flight homeward; 
 The way my stomach dips when the landing gears lowered; 
 Because no matter how many miles that I wander; 
 The bay bridge curves like a smile on the water; 
 I'm like, what up missy? 
 Tell me you were missin' me; 
 With this pretty city skyline lit up like a Christmas tree; 
 The buildings shimmering like pinky rings from Tiffany's; 
 Every time I witness it I have a damn epiphany; 
 That this is me! This is where I've got the richest history; 
 Stacked with six or seven memories on every single street; 
 I never missed a beat; 
 I'm soaked in city pride; 
 And me oh my, this foggy sky got me misty eyed; 
 There might be other cities half as raw as ours; 
 (Just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it) 
 Out in some distant galaxy among the stars; 
 (But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it) 
 We don't play tiny violins over minor things; 
 We slide into the ring takin' Tyson swings; 
 Because this city will defend our fuckin' pride 
 And raise each other up like Simba in the Lion King; 
 We're not shy; 
 I ain't no coy coward; 
 I'll be doin' trust falls offa Coit tower; 
 My boys on the ground floor providin' man power; 
 But if I die now, mix me into clam chowder; 
 Put me in a bread bowl, feed me to the seagulls; 
 But not the freakin' tourists; 
 I'm sure they're peachy people; 
 I guess I'm just a purist; 
 It isn't oil, but there's somethin' in the water 
 And it's got me feelin' diesel; 
 There might be other cities half as raw as ours; 
 (Just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it) 
 Out in some distant galaxy among the stars; 
 (But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it) 
 Ain't no love, in the heart of the city; 
 Ain't no love, in the heart of town; 
 Ain't no love, in the heart of the city; 
 Ain't no love, in the heart of town; 
 Ain't no love.
