Chorus (Talkbox) 
 If you don't like me 
 And it's looking likely 
 I don't like you 
 You'll have to fight me 
 If you don't ease u 
 Then roll your sleeves up 
 And we can meet outside right now 
 Spun a web of lies, took notes from charlotte 
 Throw a red herring, paint the white house scarlet 
 Pennsylvania ave was the last red carpet 
 Then Bush relapsed like a rehabbed starlet 
 (I feel carsick) Stop the Paris Hilton carousel 
 Hot as hell it smells like kerosene and caramel 
 America's flaring and we're carrying a parasols 
 Paranoid of terror cells parents scared of aerosols 
 Said if you care at all 
 Fight for the ones who fall 
 Fight for the ones who can't 
 Fight for the one for the all 
 And fight for the ones who rep (yes) 
 For the one percent 
 At the bottom 
 And against the one two one two step 
 For ones who come correct 
 I don't want to sit back 
 With a big mac and a rack of natty ice 
 Six pack in my lap 
 Skinemax on blast 
 Sticking to the facts of life 
 (Right) said If you're taller better follow who you're stepping on 
 'Cause I'll be brawling like the fighting Irish leprechaun 
 Verse 2 (Dahlak) 
 I don't need a chart to see 
 That I look hard to me 
 No Chardonay pumping through my arteries 
 My heart'll say 
 I should take the harder way 
 If I got a part to play, I won't make it Bartleby 
 At least this Starter T is feeling like an armor piece 
 The cloth is guarding me 
 Like it's righteous artistry 
 So far to lead us to indagadenevita 
 To seeking god in your freedom 
 To god I gotta lead a vida bonita 
 Cause see to lead a beautiful life 
 Is more than eating, sleeping and meeting suitable wife 
 You gotta fight! 
 While luda's throwing bows in A-town 
 I'll be throwing blows like little children on the playground 
 Hey now, you should know the bay 
 Seeming sorta tame 
 We can go insane 
 If you're on lower plane like when a boeing lands 
 My fist detaches at the wrist 
 So I'll be throwing hands
