Keep it fresh like I'm Tupperware 
 Quail man, outside underwear 
 I'm the Mail man, always deliver 
 I don't have it in my pocket then I got it in my other pair 
 Baggin' saggin' Barry 
 Slap an adversary 
 I'm not tan 
 But a lady had been sucking on my milky body 
 Till my neck was like be the only place 
 I didn't have a hickey busting all my capillaries 
 I'm a human in a cyborg uniform 
 Find me riding on five horn unicorn 
 Five horns cause it got five heads 
 Five heads And they all got dreads 
 Neon dreads, watch the braids glow 
 We're Going dummy getting blazed on a rainbow 
 Blaze the rainbow, I'm so enfuego 
 It's great to see you on the Today Show 
 I'm in the future on the Day After Tomorrow Show 
 Smoke a fatty while you're puffing on a Marlboro 
 I don't have to be a billionaire 
 I'm a gummy bear hundrednaire snacking on the Haribo 
 And I got sickest barrio 
 And I got the biggest heart and so 
 Every time I see an adorable little puppy 
 I know that I be working on my cardio 
 I'm working on my Carter flow 
 I'm Attila the Hun I'm bucking the run of mill 
 I'm a fucking gorilla I'm coming to thrill 'em 
 And I'm no bigger than a garden gnome 
 And I'm not gonna stop till locked in a coffin 
 No fuck that, I'll keep going off when dead 
 And I'm rotten and propped up and stuffed full of cotton
