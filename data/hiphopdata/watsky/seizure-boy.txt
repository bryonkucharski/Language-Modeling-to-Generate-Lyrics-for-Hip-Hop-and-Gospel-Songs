 Seizure Boy 
 The first thing that happens is the world goes black 
 You just hear a little snap when your neck rolls back 
 You don't bite your tongue off, or foam at the lips 
 And before you hit the ground there's a moment of bliss 
 It's like toking a spliff, it's like shedding your skin 
 It's better than the best trainwreck there's even been 
 You have to let it in, as much as it's upsetting 
 To wake up with bruises you don't remember getting 
 You don't remember how the hell you ended up indoors 
 You don't remember whether you were wetting your gym shorts 
 In front of Amanda, the girl you're after 
 Who already thought you were a fucking disaster 
 It's not like a last will, it's making me laugh 
 Unless you get your next one while you're taking a bath 
 I'm seizing the mic fast at middle school dances 
 I'm done being seized and I'm seizing my chances 
 It's all too much 
 I said it's all too much 
 Said it's all too much 
 And the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch 
 It's all too much 
 Said it's all too much 
 Said it's all too much 
 And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch 
 Maybe true 
 I got baby blues 
 And you got navy blues 
 Paid your dues 
 Name the tune 
 Name a hue 
 What shade are you? 
 I see purple people eaters more than world beaters 
 And I've jumped a couple hurtles burned some sneakers through the meters 
 (Copesthetic) 
 Please, get the medic 
 Let it breath 
 I'ma be the baddest motherfucking epileptic I can be 
 I would grieve 
 Asking why's it me sleeping in the ER with an IV in my arm and my V card hurting saying God fuck if I'm a die a virgin 
 I'ma grab the first nurse working, flirt and draw the curtain 
 So who's perkin Doctor Phil's Pills 
 Tyler Durden Still ill 
 Thrillville Uma Therman hurting in the Kill Bills 
 This is to my sick kids 
 Time to flip this shit 
 Depakote, Aderol, Ritalin pixie stix 
 I don't give a fuck what you're on in the setting sun 
 Use it as a weapon when it's Said and done 
 Hey say that I'm crazy or call it a pitfall 
 I'll win a game of bloody knuckles hitting a brick wall 
 It's pinball hitting the limit to smash that glass 
 Take a minute to sit in the whip and then I'mana Mash on gas 
 'Cause I be crashing that impasse with fat ass syntax 
 Skinny motherfucker off a bucket of slim fast 
 You ever had a gran mal seizure in gym class? 
 Had whiplash back when life was dishing out pimp slaps? 
 Fed up and we've all been better but I'm set to step up 
 Never let up cause the fall is just the setup now to get up 
 Regret'll never get the better of me with a sawed-off 
 When I'm having trouble talking someone knocks my writer's block off 
 If my eyes glaze and my knees drift south 
 And you think to stick a credit card in my mouth 
 I take Mastercard and Visa for my risk rewards 
 I'm not biting my tongue, why don't you bite yours?
