Kush Mody! 
 Andy Paak 
 I'll never it die, I'll never let it die, I'll never let it die 
 Cause it isn't the fashion, the cash, and isn't the trashing hotels 
 It's the pit of passion you feel, in the moment you crashed and you fell 
 Then get up and you're smashing it well, like it was a pistachio shell 
 And you gotta be gnashing your teeth, and be giving 'em hell 
 Cause to love is a radical act, give your brother a pat on the back 
 And if you get a panic attack, feel like you're at the back of the pack 
 An opinion's exactly that. If they say that your magic is black 
 Just do what you do when you do what you do, keep on pulling that rabbit from hat 
 You might think that you're ruined. You might think you're defeated 
 If you love what you're doing you've already succeeded 
 But there's gonna be bleeding, when another one bites that dust 
 So get ready to beat it, cause maybe it might be us, and I'm telling em 
 That the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say "no no no" 
 Cause to make it is difficult, but we go go go 
 And my father was telling me that I better be ready ride on through 
 'Cause I know that it's tough, but it's gotta be somebody, so then why not you? 
 I'll never it die, I'll never let it die, I'll never let it die 
 Carry the spark as we're marching into the darkness 
 I don't care if they're marking where they bury my carcass 
 I'm working in this circus and searching for purpose 
 Learning from the bird who's perched on top of the church and chirpin a sermon 
 You want that early worm? Be the determined sparrow 
 Flying in loops around the sternest scarecrow 
 Once cupid hit me with his burning arrow 
 He lit the lava in my churning marrow 
 So when I'm tested I remember I've been blessed 
 With that tender ember resting left of center in my chest 
 And yes, if you fuck with us you'll see my game face 
 Cause no matter who you pray to when you say grace 
 And no matter where you come from in this great space 
 Every single person is escaping from the same place 
 So if you got a flame that's blazing hot within 
 Take a deep breath and feed it oxygen 
 I'll never it die, I'll never let it die, I'll never let it die 
 So I was really interested and loved folk music, and then when I was in seventh grade, in the fall of 1963, I started getting interested in politics 
 This was about a year after my dad died, and I think it was a real way to connect with him 
 With my memories of him 
 I'll never it die, I'll never let it die, I'll never let it die 
 Tore the pages from their Torahs. Hurled torches at their doors. 
 So they departed Polish ports and boarded boats to court the green lady with that copper torch who rose up gorgeous off the shore. 
 Endured that stormy, weather for me 
 Ellis Island, hellish journey 
 Maggots in the hard barley 
 Some shot off their own toes so they couldn't be forced to march in the Tsar's army 
 Bodies pitched in ditches, singed and bludgeoned 
 Burned the children in the ovens by the dozens 
 Burned the witches in New England by the coven 
 They burn the different ones, so clutch your cousins close 
 'Cause such is life, it's cuts and strife, stitches, punches, knives and hungry crows 
 Nothing guarantees survival 
 And we won't stop this terror sticking flowers in the barrels of their rifles 
 We fight the hatred with the light 
 And when they think we'll fold and wave that bright rag 
 We won't surrender 
 We'll wipe the blood up with the white flag
