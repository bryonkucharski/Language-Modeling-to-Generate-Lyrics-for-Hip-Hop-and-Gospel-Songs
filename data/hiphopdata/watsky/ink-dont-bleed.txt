Some got hits about the racks that they earn 
 Say there's Benjamins and Jacksons in their pockets to burn 
 But when they shoot the video, producers pass around a bucket 
 Full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return 
 I know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder 
 A vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder 
 But when everybody's sleeping he be creeping 
 Slugging back the whiskey, hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger 
 There's a pop idol at the top of the charts 
 And when her records being cut she's on the beach in St. Barts 
 While a session singer who didn't have the face to make it 
 Signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts 
 It's hard 'cause I got bars that are big uppin' Woody Allen 
 But maybe he's a predator whose diggin' in his talons 
 There's a balance and often I don't know how to feel 
 In a fake and painted world seek the real 
 Now I can't change the past but a man's gotta man up 
 It's hard to believe shit, sometimes I get the best of me 
 Now, I'm doing what I can but I'm a man not a damn chump 
 I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed 
 We dismiss our heroes' skeletons no matter how grim 
 My fans saying "I'd be honored to be injured by him" 
 Well fam, this branch is thin, but I'll go out on a limb 
 To say she didn't love her ulna poking out of her skin 
 Being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines 
 They cut off my jeans, I heard her in the ambulance scream 
 She's in school to do tattoos and might of had nerve damage 
 So I could have cost a girl a chance at her dream 
 Meanwhile, he pops painkillers until the dude is numb 
 Knew I was a stupid ass, just not that I'm a ruthless one 
 Youth is easily influenced 
 So should you be rooting for me if I touch a thousand lives but on the way I ruin some? 
 The rule of thumb is "all publicity is your advantage" 
 But human lives are not collateral damage 
 Bandage the wounded then vanish blank as the newest of canvases 
 When they zoom in the cameras, give them the truth 
 Now I can't change the past but a man's gotta man up 
 It's hard to believe 
 Shit, sometimes I get the best of me 
 Now, I'm doing what I can but I'm a man not a damn chump 
 I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed 
 Mega church leaders sleeping with male hookers 
 Mayors hitting crack pipes with their cookers 
 Each week a crooked politician gets caught 
 We're not shocked when they're cheaters 
 These days we're shocked when they're not 
 Are they the person you thought? 
 If they're perfect and hot 
 Often we blame the victim scoff and they deserve what they got 
 Actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot 
 But they're amateurs and we can see the boom in the shot 
 If perception is reality then this could be a shocker 
 I've done my share of fucked up things that didn't get on Gawker 
 Lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye 
 That if you saw would probably out me as a complicated guy 
 Mike says you got to separate the person from the art 
 But if the arts about that person you can't pull them apart 
 So you better watch the choices that you're making now because 
 They are something that matter, they're the only thing that does 
 Everything they say conflicts with everything I do 
 But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true
