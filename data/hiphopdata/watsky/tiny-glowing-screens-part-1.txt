And when the sun burns out 
 We'll light the world with tiny glowing screens 
 Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens 
 And when the sun burns out 
 We'll light the world with tiny glowing screens 
 Tiny glowing screens 
 I've seen a person go to shows and raise a lighter app 
 But if you're at my concert please don't ever try that crap 
 Let's set fire to the heavens 
 Turn the motherfucking speakers to 11, this is Spinal Tap 
 The future might defeat me, the internet can eat me 
 It really tastes like chicken when I bite the hand that feeds me 
 And I say me me, me me, play my CD, CD 
 Yes indeedy deedy 
 We be greedy and it's tragic that we yawn 
 We got every gadget but don't care there's magic in our palm 
 'Cause it's been getting so hot, I can feel the slow rot 
 But let's not die before we get to fuck a robot 
 Because we all need something to live for, something to live for, something to live for 
 We all need something to live for, something to live for 
 There was a time before the pot really got strong 
 Before the hippies got jobs talking long, long 
 Before the people talked in English out in Hong Kong 
 Before the holy Dalai Lama had a dot com 
 Before God's dad got it on with God's mom 
 Before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs 
 Before the war crimes 
 The rich and poor times 
 I'm talking in the land before The Land Before Time 
 But then the planet lost its baby fat and got crazy 
 And we've been acting like some fraidycats a lot lately 
 Something'll kill us like cigarettes or the commies maybe 
 Or maybe AIDS or scabies, rabies or zombie babies 
 Even the KGB, pray we be free from ADD, wade in and bathe in Hades 
 No army or Navy's saving me 
 And I can't tell our little victories from epic fails 
 It's either heaven or hell and I can't make heads or tails 
 Are we useless? 
 No excuses 
 We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
