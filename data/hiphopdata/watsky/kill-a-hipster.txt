Rent's up (That shit's no good) 
 Starbucks where the skate rink stood 
 It's a fixture (it does no good) 
 (I know) kill a hipster (Save your hood!) 
 Wrote congress (it did no good) 
 Read scripture (it did no good) 
 You could take a picture or knock on wood 
 (Fuck that) kill a hipster (Save your hood!) 
 I'm getting Hummus, hummus 
 I'm getting hummus, hummus 
 I'm at the park playing dodgeball 
 Drinking San Pellegrino like it's Cristal 
 No school, alcohol 
 Living no rules-Calvinball 
 You wanna brawl? Ho please 
 I sprinkle you with some goat cheese 
 I get it straight from the fuckin' farm 
 I even put goat cheese in my lucky charms 
 I'm at the taco truck looking like a mack 
 I roll my Rs hard like I'm busting off a gat 
 It's like, "hola mama, I'm your papa" 
 May I please have dos Horchatas? 
 I'm like brap brap brap! 
 When I smack your ass fast with my backpack strap 
 Rent's up (That shit's no good) 
 Starbucks where the skate rink stood 
 It's a fixture (it does no good) 
 (I know) kill a hipster (Save your hood!) 
 Wrote congress (it did no good) 
 Read scripture (it did no good) 
 You could take a picture or knock on wood 
 (Fuck that) kill a hipster (Save your hood!) 
 Pencil to the neck, razor to your inner tube 
 Bullet to your disrespect, I hate your hipster attitude 
 Your whole chassez, acting like you own us with your whole passé 
 Dance around the issue patna, no plié 
 But you'll get broke for that French shit, so cassé 
 And you can put that in your lit mag and your Tumblr blog 
 Eat it with the bacon off your farm fresh hog 
 Sip it like Kombucha, hope your last meal suit ya 
 Do-gooder types, commuters on bikes 
 Brooding 20-somethings with the coolest of "likes" 
 You be loving on my city like johns 
 Rubbing on her titties leaving money in palms 
 Our rumbling guts can only hunger so much 
 Plus we redundantly blunted in lieu of giving a fuck 
 We'll cut you for the scratch 
 Leave in on a tee 
 And if we've done it properly you're copping it from Treat, 'cause 
 Rent's up (That shit's no good)

 Look in the mirror and it's clear I've become one of 'em 
 Kill me please if I'm one of 'em 
 I walk the block like I'm hot shit 
 I gentrified the corner store just buying hot chips 
 But now I'm caught red-handed 
 With this land so make me a dead bandit 
 And if you see me sipping at an open keg 
 Put me down like a horse with a broken leg 
 Rent's up (That shit's no good) 
 Starbucks where the skate rink stood 
 It's a fixture (it does no good) 
 (I know) kill a hipster (Save your hood!) 
 Wrote congress (it did no good)
