She freaked when she saw me 
 Calmly eating my tamale 
 She followed me home from the diner 
 Now all day she be on me 
 On the other side of the street 
 You can see her through the blinds if you peek 
 With a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair 
 What do you care when I'm home what I do there? 
 You're creeping out my neighbors 
 When they grab the paper 
 You probably think I'm inside 
 Like some kind of savior 
 Solving world hunger 
 Working on sudoku 
 And filling in the numbers 
 Polishing my halo 
 Ooh I bet you wonder 
 Life can be bogus 
 We all wanna be noticed 
 But we're the ones in the background fuzzy 
 When the ones in the front are in focus 
 And it's pretty difficult in general 
 When you really think a person is incredible 
 And I get it why you're setting 'em up on a pillar 
 But the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal 
 Frankly I am flattered 
 We all want to matter 
 Do you see when you pass by 
 That we let the grass die? 
 I'm late with the rent check 
 We park on the lawn 
 Like we're a bunch of fuckin' rednecks 
 I'm just watching netflix 
 Jerking off to porno 
 (I have a subscription!) 
 And I got a suspicion 
 You think my life is different 
 I get your confusion 
 But you got some delusions 
 Yeah I'm fucking awesome 
 But I gotta out you 
 You probably think I'm in there 
 Writing songs about you (ooh!)
