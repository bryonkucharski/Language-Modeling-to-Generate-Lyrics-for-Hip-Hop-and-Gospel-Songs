It's the American dream 
 But if you pull on the thread, it's gonna tear at the seam 
 See what I mean? We don't tend to scream 
 Baby, we just stare at the screen 
 Like it's a preacherman up at the pulpit 
 Some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip 
 Another angry kid unloading a full clip 
 And I could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit 
 But let's not lie for another second 
 We see the trouble, we're rubberneckin' 
 No doublecheckin', if it's an issue we have to grapple 
 The words are caught in my Adam's apple 
 I make my body a happy chapel 
 Cause every person's a tabernacle 
 But there's no feeling you gotta hide 
 So let's all pray to the God inside, say it now 
 Never needed a hand till you needed a hand 
 You never know how to walk until you understand 
 Coulda been anything that you needed to be 
 How many more do you want? How many more do you need? 
 Still I wish I could break free 
 It's that same old simple song I still believe 
 How many more do we need? 
 Before it's hand over hand 
 Love over everything 
 That's me with the long arm 
 Screaming at the top dog, spilling my blood on the cement 
 We willing to roll now, sick of getting mowed down 
 Fuck if I dope now, it'd kill me 
 'Cause I'd rather be known for the dealing 
 Than known to be hooked on the feeling 
 How many more gotta go now? How many more gotta go down? 
 I'll stand in the rain witcha, just to get a little bit of glimpse of the plain picture 
 People need a pinch just to get 'em to wake up 
 You'll be in a ditch before I get you to wake up, say it bruh 
 Whoever said it wasn't fair, they was telling the truth 
 I'd be a liar if I said there was nothing to prove 
 Never needed a hand till you needed a hand 
 You never know how to walk until you understand 
 Coulda been anything that you needed to be 
 How many more do you want? How many more do you need? 
 Still I wish I could break free 
 It's that same old simple song I still believe 
 How many more do we need? 
 Before it's hand over hand 
 Love over everything 
 They say we gotta know our role 
 Kiss the bottom of the totem pole 
 Set goals, and then go for gold 
 But we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes 
 I wanna smoke a bowl, a hand on my dick 
 While the other one is busy clicking the remote control 
 I'm no Dalai Lama of the sofa but I hear I gotta go to 
 Where the sinners face the roasting coals 
 You say that your heart ain't got no holes, well bitch please 
 Let's all admit that we got souls like Swiss cheese 
 But wishing isn't gonna fill this abyss 
 And no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin what's missin' 
 If I wanna kill this monotony 
 I know the answer is a light that I got in me 
 I got no university degree in philosophy 
 But I know that every baby's born with the lock and key 
 Sing it now 
 Never needed a hand till you needed a hand 
 You never know how to walk until you understand 
 Coulda been anything that you needed to be 
 How many more do you want? How many more do you need? 
 Still I wish I could break free 
 It's that same old simple song I still believe 
 How many more do we need? 
 Before it's hand over hand 
 Love over everything
