It's '86 when my mama has me 
 30 seconds later when the doctor slaps me 
 15 years till I get my permit 
 And then 4 more till we're in the backseat 
 Of a taxi, crazy youngfolk 
 And then sun came up but none woke 
 It's 4:20 when I made that dumb joke 
 I was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke 
 And then it's later in the afternoon 
 In my backyard when we write this tune 
 2 days later when I pen the verses 
 Probably 8 months till you first heard it 
 So punch the clock, adjust your tie 
 Spike the punch and touch the sky 
 Life is hard and then you die 
 So let's all go hard tonight 
 Remembering the days that felt so long 
 I bet you miss me 
 We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up 
 We're making history 
 Right now is right now 
 Too loud to die down 
 Right now is right now 
 No other time now 
 If time is money a second's a penny a minute's buck a couple years are a milly I'm getting really really filthy 
 Bitch, get me a bathtub! 
 I'm filthy rich, watching my pennies stack up 
 I shower in a typhoon 
 If time is dimes then I'm a tycoon 
 I'll glue 'em together and the climb to the moon 
 Climb to the moon! Climb to the moon! 
 We on Today, Today, Matt Laur 
 Every 24 we going like Jack Bauer 
 Hear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour 
 Turning on my light and I set it to max power 
 Let's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low 
 And then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go 
 Remembering the days that felt so long 
 I bet you miss me 
 We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up 
 We're making history 
 Right now is right now 
 Too loud to die down 
 Right now is right now 
 No other time now 
 Pushing offa the ground tonight 
 I be up in the clouds tonight 
 Looking over my town tonight 
 In the shadow we found the light 
 Remembering the days that felt so long 
 I bet you miss me 
 We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up 
 We're making history 
 Right now is right now 
 Too loud to die down 
 Right now is right now 
 No other time now
