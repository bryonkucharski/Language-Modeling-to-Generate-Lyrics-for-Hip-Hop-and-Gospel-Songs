Chorus- Mieka Pauley 
 When the sun sets on the city 
 It's something to behold 
 'Cause when the sun sets on the city 
 Everything turns gold 
 For now you're young and pretty 
 And you'll be lovely when you're old 
 'Cause when the sun sets on the city 
 Everything turns gold 
 Verse 1- Watsky 
 The frog in my throat was the size of a mutt 
 The fat toad ate the butterflies in my gut 
 The dog in me knows that it's a bitch in dark black 
 So I spit the frog out and I took my bark back 
 Till that I'd been afraid of night 
 My cradle never stayed in sight 
 It might have all abated if I played it right 
 I hated trynna find and face a place I didn't dare go 
 Diving with the worms and liking looking like a scarecrow 
 Do a mellow jig instead of tripping off a dollar 
 I'll just skip the yellow brick with wicker sticking out my collar 
 It's all or nothing I'll be cultured when I'm older 
 Fuck a parrot, I don't care I'll feed the vulture on my shoulder 
 (Polly want a collarbone?) 
 Try the lake for fish 
 Or just say yes to yesterday break it and make a wish 
 I ate dirt as a baby, I did it for the flavor 
 In a couple years I'll let the dirt return the favor 
 Verse 2- Gift of Gab 
 Yeah 
 I used to consider the riches and the props 
 And the houses and the fame and the fortune, everything 
 Seems when you get here, there seems more desirable 
 All that old fear (?) doesn't leave, it's inside of you 
 Everything material, it passes like the night'll do 
 Into day 
 Came and went away 
 Nothing penetrates the void that illustrates the noise 
 Mental states annoyed with a attitude of zero gratitude that may destroy 
 Beneath the lies is truth though 
 You seek and find the proof 
 Only place to be is here 
 Dig in, peep it how the roots grow 
 From out of nowhere into nothingness and back 
 Constantly expresses everything and everyone 
 And acting as a thread 
 Arm Leg Leg Arm Head 
 Karma that you spread 
 May be relived again after you live again after you're dead 
 Until you merge into the blissful field of mighty power 
 But time is an illusion, all of it's within you now 
 Bridge- Watsky 
 The sun is going down 
 Drink another round 
 Play until you fold 
 Paint the city gold 
 Remember what you've heard 
 Don't say another word 
 Until you shake your bottle up and spray a little on the curb 
 Remember what you own 
 Take the sunset home 
 If no one's out right now, 
 I hope you know you're not alone 
 Try to find some nights 
 To watch the shining lights 
 Park see the city sparkle out on diamond heights 
 All those attractive glass spires 
 That we love to stack higher 
 I'm starting grass fires 
 When my car backfires after four flat tires 
 Rolling off road to avoid the bad drivers 
 Coming back home and I climb the walls into the sky on tall risers 
 To make it all brighter 
 Blaze your lighters up 
 Raise your cider cup 
 And let's pull an all-nighter
