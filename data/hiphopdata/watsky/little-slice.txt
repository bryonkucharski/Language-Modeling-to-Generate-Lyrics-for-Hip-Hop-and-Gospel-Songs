And the clouds are red and pink like they're wearing a tube of lipstick 
 The Sun is dimming while dipping a toe into the Pacific 
 Just gimme a hot jacuzzi 
 A spliff and we'll watch a movie 
 I'm spiffy, man in a jiffy I'm lifted and living groovie 
 I'm a groupie to the good life 
 Looking for a taste of paradise 
 I don't need the whole pie 
 Just wanna have my little slice 
 I found the fountain of youth and went skinny dipping up in it 
 I pick up the lucky pennies, epiphanies every minute 
 I run the money to Coinstar and watch the cash from the ticket 
 I snatch my homies whatever they want at Denny's and kick it 
 'Til the mothafuckin' Sun rise 
 So many folks I love right here 
 But it hasn't been a good night 
 Until the shit gets kinda weird 
 I'm a groupie to the good life 
 Looking for a taste of paradise 
 I don't need the whole pie 
 Just wanna have my little slice 
 I'm a groupie to the good life 
 Looking for a taste of paradise 
 I don't need the whole pie 
 Just wanna have my little slice 
 I got a stylish private island inside of my mind the size of Hawaii 
 And when I'm vibing you're likely to find me deep in my psyche 
 Hiding out peeping a flying V of neon pelicans filling the psychedelic horizon like 
 Wow, what just happened? 
 I'll please have what he's having 
 And how can I come ride that wave? 
 Don't give a damn if I'm damp, I dance in the rain 
 I decided to celebrate like the sky is dumping champagne on me 
 Paint every clap of thunder as Heaven popping a bottle 
 Jump in and paddle the deepest puddles 
 Strap on my goggles 
 I gotta seek what I lack 
 When I'm weak, gotta act 
 I'm a freak, it's a fact 
 But I can't say that I mind 
 Gotta leave those thoughts behind 
 And I hop in my car and I bob in my seat 
 When I'm dropping to the beat as I mob the beach 
 And I stop and I park at the top of a cliff in the dark 
 And I'm digging on the stars in the sea 
 Shining like a fistful of diamonds 
 That somebody went and threw into the sky but they ricochet off 
 And a couple of 'em fell into the water and they sink the bottom 
 And I think that I saw some 
 But I blink and lost 'em 
 And I drink in the awesome view 
 Infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across 'em 
 If I'm getting money then I get it while I can 
 But if I'm not, I better live it up and dammit I demand 
 To give it every single breath I got inside of me and try to be the man 
 I'm a groupie to the good life 
 Looking for a taste of paradise 
 I don't need the whole pie 
 Just wanna have my little slice 
 I'm a groupie to the good life 
 Looking for a taste of paradise 
 I don't need the whole pie 
 Just wanna have my little slice
