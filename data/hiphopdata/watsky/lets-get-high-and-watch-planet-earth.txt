Why don't we get high and watch Planet Earth? 
 Planet Earth, Planet Earth 
 Watch it spin, watch it spin 
 You and me, planet earth 
 And yes, yes, let's let's let's get some takeout 
 Press our hearts together like when kids make Barbies make out 
 Let's make out, no toothpaste 
 I only want to know how you taste 
 We don't need to tie no shoelace 
 And we don't need to pack no suitcase 
 To, to find a new place. Let our moment linger 
 We'll weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers 
 Until the whisper, whisper of time's undying rivers 
 Come decorate our skin with crow's feet, spider-veins and fissures 
 But we won't cry, we won't cry, we'll step into that cyclone 
 Together when we're blinded and our minds erode like limestone 
 And all we can remember's how we make each other feel, then 
 Why don't we get high and watch Planet Earth? 
 Planet Earth, Planet Earth 
 Watch it spin, watch it spin 
 You and me, planet earth 
 Ah, the hippies, ah, were sort of wide-eyed with floppy pants and things like that 
 I thought there were some good things about what they were doing 
 A lot of good things, especially the sex
