 Fu-Fu-Fu-Fu-Fuck an MC Name 
 I don't need a god damn MC Name

 (George Watsky doesn't need a fucking MC Name)

 If I go spit a poem 
 If I go kick a flow 
 Doesn't really matter man cause the jam is a Watsky 
 When I get a mic and I go rip a rhythm ain't a name in the whole damn gonna stop me 
 Probably gonna rip it too 
 Cause the city wants a hippy with a bit to prove 
 I got shit to do 
 I got the sickest crew 
 And so what the fuck is it to you, dude 
 If I got no stage name 
 I got stage game out the ass 
 And a master plan 
 It's an avalanche 
 When I spit a little bit of slam 
 And I hit you with the battleram 
 Got a cattle brand "GW bar none" so what do you park man? 
 Got money and cars? I study the stars 
 And I couldn't care less who you rep in your set show respect 
 I'll be rapping I bet 
 Lean to the left flow right Oh my god! 
 A rose by any name got thorns as sharp 
 Yo, stage names are for porno stars 
 And Watskeet skeet skeet skeet is far 
 From what I'm trying to do, who I'm trying to be 
 Mother fu-fu-fu-fuck this industry 
 If I gotta be MC You to do MC Me 
 (George Watsky MP3) 
 Fu-Fu-Fu-Fu-Fuck the limit I got a keep it coming if I wanna make it to the top 
 So I be giving you what I been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock 
 'Cause if I walk the walk and I talk the talk and I'm popping off cause my flow is hot 
 Then I'm pretty motherfucking positive I never gotta be somebody I'm not

 What's in a name man, flow comes first 
 I'm never gonna curse - that I got it worst when I roam the earth 
 It's a ridiculous coincidence that shows my worth 
 You know my parents went and chose my emcee name at birth 
 I don't need a mask 
 To cover my ass 
 So why would you ask? 
 Go put me on blast 
 I'll take you to task 
 This name is my last 
 (Gasp) So put it on my tombstone when I pass 
 (Here lies a fine emcee, the kind who grasps the fact 
 That these aren't circus acts to make you clap, it's rap to make you think and act) 
 I think you understand by now the thought involved 
 That if I wanted to be called another name I would have scrawled it on the bathroom wall 
 I'm not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself Thugdog and not expect assault 
 I'm marching on and calling all dissenters who 
 Would like to be included in this emcee designation coup 
 I'm set to get a crew 
 We're gonna get a clue and then we'll put it up for you to view 
 Coo coo ca choo 
 I am the "insert you" 
 Come on everybody do it too
