The first time I listened to Watsky 
 I was like, "He sounds like a fucking honkey" 
 And I don't even think he knows 
 But, then, I listened to him some more times 
 And, don't tell anybody about this 
 But, he kinda goes hard, though 
 I'm Driving to the burbs and before I am coming back 
 I'm pulling in your driveway and I'm rolling front to back 
 I'm shifting forward than reverse my car a bunch 
 As if my Subaru's a wiener getting sexy with your cul-de-sac 
 L-O-L-O-L I'm from the avenue 
 A rapping labradoodle, half a wasp and half a Jew 
 If you's a Saturday cartoon, I'll smack ya black and blue 
 I'm acking ratchet with Daffy Duck and snacking on rabbit stew 
 Yabba dabba doo, I gotta lick my lips 
 Smoke a bowl with Yogi Bear, I'm sticking up your pic-a-nics 
 All of this is in my head; my 'magination's colorful 
 Crayons on the brain, I'll scribble silly shit all on my skull 
 Holy cow, I don't think they're gonna hold me down 
 I recommend you listen to the record in a theater with the Dolby sound 
 And I'm sipping on the coldest round 
 With the preppies and the Goldie Locks 
 But I bet a bunch of hundreds everybody's gonna scatter 
 Any minute when the police knocks 
 Like "Sorry ociffer, that getting sloshed occurred 
 But rastas broke in and they made us all smoke lots of herb 
 I'm sorry, Honest Abe 
 Popo don't take me away way 
 'Cause if you ever try to lock me up, I'm pleading cray cray" 
 And then they'll all say may day 
 May day, oh what did we do? 
 He be creepy givin' me the heeby jeebies, he be Hebrew 
 He be robo, beep boop beep boop, please untie me he's behind me 
 What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me, can you please remind me? 
 A lot. That's a life changing amount of money for normal people
