These color lines will make you break you make you choose a side 
 These color lines these color lines been here since jump 
 I write these color lines 'cause if I don't I'll lose my mind 
 I write these color lines these color lines 
 Verse 1 (George) 
 Your first rap show posted in the back row 
 Of a sea of white kids bent on supermanning that hoe 
 Pretty soon you're buying fitted hats and high tops 
 Pretending that you're black enough and rapping with the lights off 
 It's like a cyclops with one closed eye 
 You can tell me that you're winking, but the grin won't lie 
 And no mouth supplies, what your skin tone hides 
 About a thousand miles south as the jim crow flies 
 And then we're playing he said she said 
 I see red when I peep a pink cheeked boston meathead 
 I wanna go Bruce Lee 
 When I see him on the T taking up two seats 
 And say, "excuse me, but would you move if hell froze?" 
 You know the subway is the underground railroad 
 Lynch trees have the same white limbs 
 Check out my arms, I look just like him 
 Verse 2 (Catch) 
 Let's you and I get one thing straight 
 The game never been equal, ain't no food on my plate 
 I gave birth to this and you just took it and co opted it and profited 
 And packaged it and wouldn't give me half of it 
 Peep how I master this and break down how you took it all 
 Raped the culture and you standing there looking all 
 Innocent, take a mile when I give and inch 
 And how you getting rich, is it a coincidence? 
 Or is it ignorance? You don't know your own privilege 
 You own riches and don't know what homeless is 
 You got a lot to learn before you even think about 
 Hip hop, black culture and which fitted you pickin' out 
 Nigger in the street, I don't think so bro 
 My people ain't supportin your black history show 
 So stop what you doing we won't take it anymore 
 Before you come in my house wipe ya feet at the door 
 George 
 I see the color lines 
 It's tough that Every other time a bother rhymes 
 White mothers think of gutter crimes 
 We keep our standard higher 
 We don't kick lower rhymes 
 Other times it undermines the fact the mine are over minds 
 Catch 
 All you gotta do is get past the guilt 
 We ain't living in a house that master built 
 If you understand that, tell your people what you know 
 Because one of 'em got enough money to pay back what you owe 
 George 
 Yes, My great grands had land, had slaves 
 I guess I pressed this record off the bank he made 
 But I want independence, past the declaration 
 But one down ass white boy can't pay for reparations 
 Catch 
 I'm running out of patience while you do the work of Satan 
 Like an impulse. Edu Leedz Black history's an insult 
 George 
 Number one. I'm not. trying. to tell. your. story 
 I just want to sit on my porch, drink a forty and spit 
 Number two, cause You can smell bullshit 
 I just love hip hop 
 Pinky swear that's it 
 Catch 
 If you love hip hop respect it 
 That includes the people who created it and paved the way for this 
 So that you're making it 
 George 
 Well if you're talking on who's making it, I'll play devil's advocate 
 A lot of black music has white dollars backing it 
 (Kweli's got it on lock) 
 Rupert Murdoch funded Rawkus 
 You looking for the keys, then you better check the pockets 
 Catch 
 I'll be checking pockets all right 
 As soon as it gets dark and all night 
 I'ma get my money we can all fight 
 George 
 You taking out the high and the mighty 
 And their kids 
 You say kill whitey 
 I say call I live? 
 You're not black militant 
 Killing us diligent 
 Grab my fam, and grandma and light us up like a filament 
 I thought we were cool now I'm this close to giving in 
 Just put a bullet in for each missed dose of Ritalin
