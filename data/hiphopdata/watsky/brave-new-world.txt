Veneficia! 
 Veneficia! 
 Seven trumpets! 
 Veneficia! 
 Easy, with a ballot, we can put a reality TV personality in DC 
 Speak free if you can see how this delicate fucking matter developed but 
 Man it beats me 
 (Oh my god!) 
 Two fleets keep peace on the mean streets 
 One treats brown people like they're beastly 
 Nothing like the force that police me 
 (That's so odd!) 
 What's the fate of the species? 
 Get a metal plate and then mate with the PCs 
 Or retreat back to a monkey chucking feces? 
 (What's the deal?) 
 Wanna ease this pain 
 Different than the BC years 
 Now we BCC Jesus on the email chain 
 Way too many threats to flee 
 Way too many heads to feed 
 Not too many beds to sleep 
 Chief said that it was best you leave 
 F-U please to the refugees 
 And it's seeming like it's every other day that I been tugging at my collar 
 Thinking "damn it's toasty" 
 Where did all the people at the supermarket go that used to scan my groceries? 
 Vanished mostly 
 And wassup with all the homies in the camo and the ammo with the rifles on 
 Their shoulder walking through the city thinking that they're Annie Oakley? 
 That's quite enough 
 But this shit is fucking unbelievable 
 I swear you couldn't write this this stuff 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Veneficia!) 
 You couldn't write this shit, no 
 Every minute, deeper in it 
 (Veneficia!) 
 Another fantasy is brought to life 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Science Fiction!) 
 You couldn't write this shit, no 
 Every minute, deeper in it 
 (Veneficia!) 
 And now I never get surprised 
 Young George Jetson stepping up in this motherfucker gripping a butcher 
 Knife hoping I can cut the chord 
 Where the horde is plugged to the motherboard 
 That is not a legitimate hoverboard 
 (Shit's got wheels!) 
 I look at the sky saying "my god run!" 
 Life's heavier than an ipod one 
 My twitter ain't gonna matter when the tripods come 
 (Let's get real!) 
 From the hieroglyphs to the crowded malls 
 Never mind if, but the how it falls 
 I'm vibing out watching Ow! My Balls 
 (Oh yeah) 
 Core defects tend to wreck my sleep 
 The quest to be more perfect than Ford Prefect 
 While I'm dreaming of Electric Sheep 
 'Cause Soylent Green is people 
 Resistance is just futile 
 Pop a red pill and a blue pill and I dilate my pupils 
 Moving light speed 
 We all got vile needs 
 Living is a violent deed 
 Spread my soul like Wild Seed 
 Why would it be any wonder I act weird? 
 I'm trying to find out who the fuck I am while looking in a cracked Black Mirror 
 You got a finish that you thought about? 
 How this is gotta bottom out? 
 You wanna flee the reaper but they're bombing the city and the single haven 
 To creep in is the slaughterhouse 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Veneficia!) 
 You couldn't write this shit, no 
 Every minute, deeper in it 
 (Veneficia!) 
 Another fantasy is brought to life 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Science Fiction!) 
 You couldn't write this shit, no 
 Every minute, deeper in it 
 (Veneficia!) 
 And now I never get surprised 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Veneficia!) 
 You couldn't write this shit, no 
 Every minute, deeper in it 
 (Veneficia!) 
 Another fantasy is brought to life 
 Everywhere that I stare 
 (Science Fiction!)
