I'm pleading guilty with the Crown today 
 That's all I got to say 
 I will not lie to you 
 I had to try my luck across the sea 
 Now we're history 
 I'm saying goodbye to you 
 Yes, I've been a mess 
 With the pressure the stress 
 See ya never, I guess 
 Nevertheless, finding you I was blessed 
 Swear I'm trying my best 
 Lion inside of my chest 
 Trying to claw his way out 
 Crack my ribs, pop my lungs I don't know if there's a safe route 
 Now-we can cut this frayed rope 
 Or hope and wait us to fade 
 Babe- after how great the ups were 
 We can't be living with love when it's lost it's luster 
 Frosted over, busted, exhausted, ruptured 
 Another couple who settled for less 
 We want something real 
 A relationship 
 Wanna feel 
 And quit chasing shit 
 Gimme a shield 
 Or she'll break me quick 
 And we will never be the same again 
 I'm pleading guilty with the Crown today 
 That's all I got to say 
 I will not lie to you 
 I had to try my luck across the sea 
 Now we're history 
 I'm saying goodbye to you 
 All we're seekin's a person that we can cherish 
 I don't think you really want a green card marriage 
 Nothing is fair but you're caring and can't bear it 
 A lot of people perished tonight in Paris 
 The planet is a mean is a motherfucker 
 You wanna scream but we gotta lean on each other 
 We suffer and pick ourselves up off of the floor 
 Your dad at stage four, what could I say to support? 
 Can we just quit each other 
 The way you did cigarettes? 
 Up and split, cold turkey, no regrets? 
 I'd even miss tasting the nicotine on your breath when we kiss 
 I'm not ready to say good bye to you yet 
 Like sayonara 
 I don't know if I can try tomorrow 
 Am I supposed to say a hallelujah 
 Smile I knew ya 
 And go on my way? 
 Oh, yes Britannia 
 I surrender 
 Book me and toss the key 
 Oh, yes Britannia 
 I'll remember your generosity 
 Oh, yes Britannia 
 Poison testers, princes and hooligans 
 Oh, yes Britannia 
 Loves a jester, and what a fool I've been
