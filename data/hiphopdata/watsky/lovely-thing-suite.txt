Arthur stepped off, yeah he stepped offa the chair 
 Couldn't weigh a hundred forty pounds 
 And the rope snapped yeah the rope snapped 
 And then Arthur found himself looking up from the ground 
 Looking up, looking up, found things looking up 
 Looking up, looking not so down, no not so down 
 No knots don't have to stay that way 
 No, not so tightly wound 
 What a lovely thing it is to fail 
 To release those grasping fingernails 
 Arthur thought the end was near 
 Then Arthur played for fifty years 
 And then my father walked down 8th and 57th street to 
 Carnegie Hall, yeah it was Carnegie Hill 
 The show was past sold out for weeks 
 But they said "if you don't mind, if you don't mind sitting on stage 
 Sometimes we release a couple seats" 
 Twenty feet, twenty feet, yeah my dad's twenty three 
 Tweet feet from the hands on the keys 
 Yeah, the hands on the keys of a man with the hands that almost didn't exist 
 That almost didn't exist to see 
 Back in 97 when Dad was my chauffeur 
 He'd play radio and I'd try to guess the composer 
 Chopin sprinkled over the hum of the motor 
 When I was young never I'd doubt my composure 
 Everything's kosher, man I was so sure 
 I'd say that I'm good 
 Don't want no adulthood 
 I never understood 
 Couldn't get how anyone would ever want to end to their life 
 Until the day that I could 
 I've heard it said we're alone in the ether 
 That we're the only intelligent creatures 
 So you don't need to adjust your receivers 
 If they were out there they'd be texting us, hitting our beepers 
 Invading us on some alien Julius Caesar 
 Or begging "take me to your leader" 
 But I got a theory it's neither 
 That there's a billion brilliant alien planets at leisure 
 Smoking alien reefer 
 The evolution of the mind's not the hunger to conquer 
 Or to want or to seek or to wander 
 Or even wonder, but to simply to be 
 Until we cease to be any longer 
 There's nothing wrong with heavy eyelids 
 I hope you enjoyed my twenties as much as I did 
 You'll never know how much that all of you provided 
 And I'm gonna try to do the same for
