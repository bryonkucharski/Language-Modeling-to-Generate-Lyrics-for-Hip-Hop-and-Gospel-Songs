Well I've made enemies along the ride 
 I'm afraid I could never be satisfied 
 But each way that I turn I face ahead 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 Now you know your soul is dark 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 You don't know the name of like half of these folks 
 And they'll be sprinting for the exit the minute you're broke 
 A bunch of bobblehead Muppets to laugh at your jokes 
 Wipe your ass and come and give your ego a stroke 
 I had to break it to you- sorry buddy it was time you knew 
 Nothing you ever said was funny, man the punchline's you 
 One time for the palm trees and the sunshine 
 Two times for the two-timers being unkind 
 Confined to a small mind, but the fault's mine 
 I always keep on crawling back across the San Andreas faultline 
 I keep on climbing underground to sweat out all my principles in darkness with you in this salt mine 
 Where we're all blind, I should fall back, I know all signs say that I should halt 
 But I golf clap for this false crap 
 But from now on counterfeit suckers suck on my ball-sack, all right? 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 Now you know your soul is dark 
 Straight through to your midnight heart 
 Well I've made enemies along the ride 
 I'm afraid I could never be satisfied 
 But each way that I turn I face ahead 
 I know you know it's way too late now and your soul is dark 
 Yeah motherfucker I see through you to your midnight heart 
 It's tough to care about stupid bullshit all of the time 
 So I gotta say I'm glad that's your job and not mine 
 Everybody's got a topic at the top of their mind 
 A choice of how you wanna let your life be defined 
 (Is it honeys?) sleeping around is your taste? 
 (Is it money?) are you the paper you chase? 
 (Kinda funny) You said that I've been playing safe 
 If you got the bravest voice say that to my face 
 (Is it your career?) pretty shitty to hear 
 But I took a difficult look in the mirror, and I checked in the rearview 
 Objects are never what they appear 
 The past tends to look crooked from here 
 The mask- that I put on out of fear, the tracks that I didn't put out 
 The facts that I kept out of my ear 
 The slack that I cut people who didn't deserve it is tragically clear 
 No no no not this year 
 I'm not done changing yet. I'll get these old knees checked 
 I can't bend over for someone I don't respect 
 Well I've made enemies along the ride 
 I'm afraid I could never be satisfied 
 But each way that I turn, I look ahead
