I know I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 Because it's wired in my circuitry 
 And if I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 You'll see I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 In 1638 they came from Sweden, 
 Ship shape settlers late looking for Eden, 
 The Delaware tribe wasn't really keen on leaving 
 So they "bought 'em out" or slaughtered them quick and got to breeding 
 1659 they built a fortress 
 Stationed soldiers, and gave them horses 
 But now their forces were losing their resources 
 Moving in the living quick as moving out the corpses 
 Started changing courses, when we got the Quakers 
 And they been running town since Cromwell met his maker 
 They didn't take pay cut, Quakers got their cake up 
 The paper came triangulating, trading with Jamaica 
 Now in the 1700s they took care of biz 
 Built the families through some noble marriages 
 Still in WIlmington, doing what their parents did 
 Living up on 7th street in Mansions they inherited 
 1800 and in step the du Ponts 
 Irenee du Pont was fleeing the war in France 
 He made the jaunt cause apparently murder rate 
 Was higher for gentle people spitting on the third estate 
 He started working late, he had grand design 
 And when we cut a couple fingers off the hands of time 
 The Du Ponts were running under Delaware like panty lines 
 They built a mill for small explosives on the Brandywine 
 But gun powder's just as temperamental 
 As the rich kids with CEO potential 
 It's essential to compete for our emergencies 
 Which brings me to a company called Hercules 
 I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 But when it comes to stacking currencies 
 I'd like to be as strong as Hercules 
 Hercules Gunpowder started kind of small 
 Du Pont had it all, were sparkling wall to wall 
 They were ballin in the fall of 1899 
 When T.C. Dupont crawled up the Brandywine 
 Now Thomas Coleman, started as a coal man 
 In the mines in Kentucky with his old man 
 Joined whole fam, and flipping the strip tease 
 Went from fig leaves all the way to big cheese 
 Never got on his knees for the love it won him 
 From couple of brothers, Lewis and Russell Dunham 
 They were running shit with Coleman's muscle 
 Lewis wasn't clueless 
 But Russell's on his hustle 
 Now brother Lou, was Coleman's true blue man 
 T.C. would Idea and Lou drew plans 
 Dupont had seventy percent of GDP 
 When it came to gun powder and TNT 
 They bought even bought Hercules 
 "Scandilous!" 
 Said the government, so brought on anti-trust 
 Litigation, and they split business up in three 
 Into Atlas and Dupont, and Hercules 
 But certainly they were busting heads 
 Put in work at Hercules, then made Russell prez 
 In 1912 up the road from Dover 
 My great great grandfather Russ took over 
 I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules 
 I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules 
 Because It's written in my history 
 I know I'm just as strong as Hercules 
 Russell Dunham, we said Daddy D 
 Or sugar Daddy D to half the family 
 Ran Hercules as an affable property 
 Slap on the wrist from capitalist democracy 
 And so between TC and Papa D 
 A bit improperly they adopt a monopoly 
 And instead of dotting the I's and often crossing the T's 
 They take a walk in the trees, and talk and pocket the cheese 
 And when Russell dropped to his knees, his heirs cashed out 
 Every generation after the shares passed down 
 (So where's that now?) Split between six ladies 
 And my mother had the stocks till the 1980's 
 (If Stonewall pays my phone calls 
 If San Juan fills my scantron 
 If every molten shower out in Okinawa fueled by smoking powder 
 Pays my broken power send my folks the flowers) 
 If it's irrelevant to my intelligence 
 Gimme a shotgun, I'm dropping these pink elephants 
 I'll take a tranquilizer shot and sell the sedatives 
 Out in delaware well aware the fella lives 
 (And what if Iwo Jima) 
 All the skeletons in my closet are dead relatives 
 (And if the Fall of Saigon) 
 And then I grow up to be another screw up 
 (And if the Tet Offensive) 
 But if I blow up 
 It'll be 'cause they blew up 
 My mother loves me more than Hercules 
 My parents work harder than Hercules 
 But if I think of this as burglary 
 I know I'm stronger cause of Hercules
