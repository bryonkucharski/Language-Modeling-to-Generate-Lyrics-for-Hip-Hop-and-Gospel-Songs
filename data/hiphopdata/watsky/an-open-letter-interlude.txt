(Intro: Watsky) 
 An open letter to the fat, arrogant, anti-charismatic, national embarrassment known as President John Adams 
 Shit! 
 (Verse 1: Watsky) 
 The man's irrational. He claims that I'm in league 
 With Britain in some vast international intrigue 
 Trick, please! 
 You wouldn't know what I'm doin' 
 You're always goin' berserk 
 But you never show up to work 
 Give my regards to Abigail 
 Next time you write about my lack of moral compass 
 At least I do my job up in this rumpus 
 Ooh... 
 The line is behind me, I crossed it again 
 While the president lost it again 
 Aw, such a rough life 
 Better run, tell your wife 
 "Yo, the boss is in Boston again" 
 Let me ask you a question. Who sits 
 At your desk when you're in Massachusetts? 
 They were calling you a dick back in '76 
 And you really haven't done anything new since 
 You nuisance with no sense 
 You would die of irrelevance 
 Go ahead, you aspire to my level 
 You aspire to malevolence 
 Say hi to the Jeffersons! 
 And the spies all around me 
 Maybe they can confirm 
 I don't care if I kill my career with this letter 
 I'm confining you to one term 
 Sit down, John, you fat motherfucker! 
 Cool
