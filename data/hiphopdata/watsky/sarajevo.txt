And they wonder what our parents say 
 And they wonder how we'll raise our children 
 And they tell me that I'm living with a monster 
 And they whisper that she took up with a villain 
 But I don't see dragon's scales 
 And I don't see claws and fangs 
 All I'm looking at is arms that hold me 
 Brown eyes that understand 
 And when she closed those eyes one final time no pipers came 
 But I know we got a love that's truer than a military sniper's aim 
 But we won't die in vain 
 Tie that chain round my waist 
 And pull me from the bottom of the pit of hell up to your final resting place 
 Sarajevo, Sarajevo 
 You're the altar that I pray to 
 God is love and love is all we have 
 We were trynna run from the city 
 Had the hope and the pride of the kids 
 People wanna put up walls to divide us 
 Kinda fitting that we died on a bridge 
 Same souls, both sides of the banks 
 They say we're different and they're fillin in the facts 
 But they put the same metal in the bullets 
 And they put the same bullets in our backs 
 Kinda love that we got is one in a mill 
 Ain't no God that I pray to would wanna kill 
 It's not God but it's fear and it's politics 
 And a Molotov that was lit with a dollar bill 
 Don't say that all is lost 
 Escape this holocaust 
 My God, Allah, my darling, star and crescent and my cross 
 Sarajevo, Sarajevo 
 You're the altar that I pray to 
 God is love and love is all we have 
 Sarajevo, Sarajevo 
 I will honor and be faithful 
 God is love and love is all we have 
 Where do we come from? Where do we go? 
 You could fill up the sea with the things I don't know 
 But I know what I feel and I know when it's real 
 And I hope that we heal 
 We're two drops of the blood and tears 
 Over thousands of years of the clash of the steel 
 I'm not blind to the cycle 
 We're pressed in spine of a Bible 
 They define the divine by the title 
 But what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival 
 You're my kind of revival 
 It's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah 
 You my you my favorite Hallelujah 
 Sarajevo, Sarajevo 
 You're the altar that I pray to 
 God is love and love is all we have 
 Sarajevo, Sarajevo 
 I will honor and be faithful 
 God is love and love is all we have 
 Yeah 
 God is love and love is all we have
