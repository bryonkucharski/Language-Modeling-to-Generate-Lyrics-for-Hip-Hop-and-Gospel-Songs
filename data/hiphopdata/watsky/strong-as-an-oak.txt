Everything is A-OK (yep) 
 Because I'm strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!) 
 But money don't grow on trees 
 And I'm B-R-O-K-E (Broke!) 
 Them rims them rings them things, you can bring 'em out 
 I just had my debit card declined at In-N-Out 
 The line is flipping out, giving me evil eyes 
 Fuck the soda, re-run it with just the cheesy fries 
 'Cause I don't think money is THE devil 
 I'm not sinking, I'm just kicking it at sea level 
 I got my floaties on 
 I'm focusing on all the wonderful stuff with the force of Obi Wan 
 Kenobi bro, I'm broke although I won't be woebegone 
 'Cause even though my bank account is low or overdrawn 
 I'm down to mow yer lawn 
 I'm getting open I'm soaking up every moment 
 And so we should make a toast we won't be sober till the BROKE of dawn 
 Because beer is cheap 
 And because love is free 
 I'm buzzin' feeling like every friend is a cousin, G 
 And someday we'll be reminiscing on some wasn't we 
 Just so down and out 
 But we were happy then 'cause... 
 Why should I sit on my ass on the couch and be asking why life isn't equal? 
 With lesser possessions I'm light as a feather and so I can fly like an eagle 
 'Cause everyone dies and I wonder why leaders in power would lie to their people 
 Be planning like they could be fitting a camel up into the eye of a needle 
 But dammit I'd settle for fitting a 94 Camry inside of my driveway 
 I'm sick of the image I'm living my life and I'm doing it my way 
 I'd rather be making the choices I'm proud of than chasing a mountain of money 
 But if that mountain comes to me, I'm climbing it 
 Got a brick and I'm laying it down 
 Got a shovel, I'm breaking this ground 
 Because I'm in the red, but it's only a color that I will be painting this town 
 Because when I make it then I dedicate it to the friends I stayed with 
 Who would do me favors even lend me paper when I couldn't pay for a little takeout 
 And to the fact 
 That whatever you think that it means 
 I be here and I'm living my dreams 
 And it's 'cause of the people I leaned on when I came apart at the seams 
 So gimme the moon 
 And gimme the spoon 
 I'm licking it clean 
 Until there just ain't nothing left 
 But who would lend a hand 'cause 
 Everything's A-O 
 Everything's A-O 
 So when I say Day-O 
 You say Everything's A-O
