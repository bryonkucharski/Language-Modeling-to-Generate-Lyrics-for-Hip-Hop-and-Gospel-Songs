Hey, asshole 
 See the sun is shining 
 But you are not smiling 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 I'm an asshole 
 'Cause the sun is shining 
 But I am not smiling 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 I know I'm often told 
 That there's a pot of gold 
 But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold 
 I know I should be grateful 
 I know I'm good and able 
 But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table 
 This kind of shot comes once 
 Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away 
 And that's the fifth this month 
 But when you take a punch 
 Don't you ever forget 
 Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next 
 Got the power of my will 
 I don't wanna win a mil 
 But I'm looking at window sill 
 Gotta take a bitter pill 
 Gonna pay for what I did to my head and my heart'll foot the bill 
 Got a foot in my mouth and because I'm kicking myself I developed 
 A habit of knocking out my front tooth 
 Looking uncouth 
 Want to hear the truth 
 Give it to me straight 
 151 proof 
 Telling myself it'll happen when I'm happy 
 But I'm climbing up a ladder that has got no end 
 Hung up on a rung I'll never make it to the top 
 I'm looking at the bottom and I must descend 
 All I want to do is buck this trend 
 Everybody need a buck to spend 
 And I'll be working on myself, till I work on someone else 
 Till I get there Ima just pretend 
 I know I'm often told 
 That there's a pot of gold 
 But I don't see a fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold 
 I know I should be grateful 
 I know I'm good and able 
 But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table 
 This kind of shot comes once 
 Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away 
 And that's the fifth this month 
 But when you take a punch 
 Don't you ever forget 
 Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next

 I'm an asshole 
 'Cause the sun is shining 
 But I am not smiling 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 And I don't know why 
 When I'm in a crisis 
 In a moment of silence 
 I look under my eyelids 
 And I'm checking my mileage 
 I been using a pool of water as a mirror but not for style it's 
 So I can reach in and pimpslap my reflection for acting childish 
 Spent a half an hour sitting at the bottom of my shower 
 Lettin the water run over my body and dammit I wanted to get up 
 But I didn't have the power 
 I don't have the answers anyway yay (yay yay yay) 
 Don't want to panic but I gotta come clean 
 Because the plan of the planet is just mean 
 Knew if was tough, but dammit it's obscene 
 I've been huffing and puffing up to the top of the summit 
 And I'ma rough it if I have enough steam 
 I'll keep on coming and coming until I'm coming with the stamina of a salmon 
 Who's heading upstream (nah nah nah nah nah)
