Chorus (Mariami) 
 In the waking hour I see your face 
 In the waking hour I feel your (oh) 
 In the waking hour feel my body race 
 In the waking hour 
 Baby I see that the game is unspoken so if you play with me 
 I don't need nothing broken 
 I've got patience you see 
 And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby 
 But a woman will teach you to believe 
 You're in the bed in that pretty little thong 
 With a ribbon on it, when I said to pick a song 
 You had a feeling for some healing with that marvin gaye 
 Begins with "let's," ends with "get it on" 
 I get it. you're ready to fuck 
 And it's time for me to let it erupt 
 But. I got a confession to make 
 When I get nervous 
 I can never get it up 
 I gotta get it together, I better meditate 
 I want to set it straight 
 I gotta separate the passion I had 
 From the fear that came 
 Alone I get a boner when I hear your name 
 But when I'm near the game, I veer to shame 
 Clearly, my dear it appears the same 
 Severely lame! 
 My genitals' flustered 
 Make a last stand like general custer! 
 I'd take a cluster fuck or a just some animal lust 
 I know you're looking for a man who can thrust 
 (Trust) I was in the sack with a faster women than danica patrick 
 When I had a panic attack 
 I can never fake it, I make another mistake 
 And I'm aching and so I pray to the have the pastor take 
 An erection collection and pass the plate 
 But no one donated, so I had to masturbate 
 I know the girls want it 
 I'm close, and if it grows I can put a condom on it 
 Her moan is onomatopoetic, 
 I groan. because my bone is gone as soon as get it 
 Got a risky trick, for frisky chicks 
 Have a drink, then blame it on whiskey dick 
 Wait a couple hours, I'll be horny good 
 And can wake up with a little bit of morningwood 
 Chorus (Mariami) 
 I know that many men are waiting 
 To be penetrating 
 You think I'm panting 
 But I'm hyperventilating 
 I would get to mating but I'm so damn nervous 
 I called my dick, but I can't get service 
 The worst is I'm a pervert- I want you 
 I'd make harness from your tan brassiere 
 Last night I had a fantasy 
 We're banging hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier 
 Slip into your chimney singing "santa's here!" 
 But it's a grand veneer 
 Damn, it's enough to bring a man to tears 
 With a hand on my gear 
 But a strand full of blanks in my bandoleer 
 There are times when I wish it away 
 There are nights when I wish I was gay 
 It'd be quicker- I go to theater school 
 Shit I figure I could stick it to pick of the litter 
 Man I'm sick of it 
 Want to stick a dick in it, lick a tit 
 Get some cliterature, for the illiterate! 
 Hit it in the middle of the night 
 In the waking hour 
 When I take a shower, we can strip 
 Luckily I studied up on being cuddle buddy 
 Would rather have sucker who fronts? 
 Fucking you once, making ugly grunts? 
 I'll be casanova (in a couple of months) 
 I'm making you mine 
 Maybe later for the sake of taking our time 
 Tonight we can lie naked 
 If you don't mind waiting 
 Give it like five dates and I'll have your thighs shaking 
 I get her in bed and then we're attending a seminar on a bit of sex ed 
 I hope this song proves 
 How fast my tongue moves 
 'Cause it's true I give the best head 
 Bridge (Mariami)
