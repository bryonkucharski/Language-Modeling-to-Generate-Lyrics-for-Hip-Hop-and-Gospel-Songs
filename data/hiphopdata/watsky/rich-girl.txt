Am I the only one who thinks a bit of soul is nice? 
 Some women suck it from you like the poltergeist 
 'Cause I can tell the time of day without a diamond on my wrist, 
 I give a, about your rolly's price 
 I like 'em bold, and I'll roll the dice 
 'Cause I been crushing on all these crunchy granola types 
 I'm over being over it and women on a mission got my heart melting like polar ice 
 I might 
 Be looking for a little bit of Bay 
 A little San Francisco in these women in LA 
 Ashe 
 Nothing I can say 
 And if you're being fake 
 You should be walking away 
 I don't play babe 
 Don't give a damn how low your earrings hang 
 Your favorite brand, I don't needa hear it, dang 
 'Cause Everybody's born nekked and maybe later I'll be licking on your Gucci 
 And you, rubbing my Vera Wang 
 Sooner or later you'll figure out it's a hard world 
 You could get stronger doing arm curls 
 But this is a stickup and I'm coming saying break yourself, better gimme that heart girl 
 Just put it in the bag 
 And if I give it back 
 Don't put it in the trash 
 'Cause I been looking for a partner with a passion saying 
 Don't recycle 
 Don't recycle me 
 But in this economy 
 I don't really think it's cute for you to flaunt your property 
 What about some modesty? 
 That'd be a shock to me 
 'Cause the only time you walk on the block is on a shopping spree 
 Mother-eff that song and dance 
 Baby girl there's not a chance 
 Not unless you wanna grab a coffee in pajama pants 
 We'll be looking like we just rolled out of bed together 
 All we really need is you and me
