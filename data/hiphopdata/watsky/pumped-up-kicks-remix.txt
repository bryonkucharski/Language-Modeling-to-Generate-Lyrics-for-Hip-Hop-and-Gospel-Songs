I've been on the blacktop 
 Steady throwing elbows 
 Ever since I was was in corduroys and velcros 
 Ever since you did your impression of Melrose 
 Pace 
 A giggling gaggle of Tickle Me Elmos 
 I ate some wheaties and graduated to shell toes 
 Running from a bully, man I'm thinking hell no 
 Chain me to a tree, I'm waiting for the bulldozer 
 You only woulda seen me skate away if hell froze 
 May not be bigger but you're never gonna pick on me 
 You're Cedric Diggory. I'm Nicholas Nickleby 
 You better pick a team 
 There's no in between 
 You want a nickelbag 
 You want some nicotine 
 You wanted a fix 
 I will never be your goldmine 
 Taking my kicks 
 And I'm hanging 'em over the phoneline 
 So you can find me, posted feeling so fine 
 Robert's got a quick hand 
 He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan 
 He's got a rolled cigarette 
 Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid 
 Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun 
 In his dad's closet with a box of fun things 
 And I don't even know what 
 But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
 At Buena Vista elementary in second grade 
 One whistle is when recess ends 
 Two whistles is an earthquake drill 
 Three means every kid better hit the deck 
 Unless you want to catch a stray bullet or a ricochet from a fight across the chainlink fence 
 I know that I don't look it but grew up in the middle of the city where only the quick make friends 
 A kid in Frisco 
 Navigating Lombard 
 No On Star 
 I'm on BART 
 No lawn darts 
 Not saying I'm hard 
 But I got street val for my Pokemon cards 
 Better put me onto Pawn Stars 
 And I'll Barter like my gramma when she wants art 
 Every block or two I skate around another beggar 
 Leaning on a cop car 
 Baked as a pop tart 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun 
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
