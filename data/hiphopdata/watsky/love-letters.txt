The drum is never the enemy of the pen 
 But when I'm meeting mentally with beat and melody then 
 One of me can turn into ten of me 
 If there's ten of me, tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend? 
 Like women and men would fall with no friends 
 Like a rose would fall with no stem 
 Like most folks follow trends 
 Like Os follow LMNs 
 That's how well I know life flows with the elements 
 As sunrise kills an evening 
 As stars die and a night sky is grieving 
 As man sees what he has when it's leaving 
 You gone is as asthma to breathing 
 That's how much I need you in my life 
 I'm never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime 
 'Cause every time I hear line that shows me I'm not alone it's saving me 
 'Cause I know that that's a lifeline 
 Like minds-this is our home and they won't ruin it easily 
 'Cause the wolf is gonna blow until he's blue in the cheek 
 And me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street 
 And the bulldozer can come chew on our feet 
 We never let 'em through 
 We'll build a levy 
 Limit the river's level 
 Steady the flood and begin with a pebble 
 Lend me one syllable 
 Come if you're ready to shovel 
 Run if you're shaking 
 But I know that today is not my Waterloo 
 You've made a place where I'm welcome 
 And although I give voice to it seldom 
 Know I love you 
 Nobody's above you 
 And if you love someone then you tell them 
 Every day the planet's losing IQ points 
 But people still bumping Ice Cube joints 
 So I've got hope 
 And every day I'm seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice 
 'Cause everybody's got a hustle and everyone's trying to push it 
 It's tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit 
 And there's another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money 
 And strippers they're selling as good shit 
 It's nothing new up at the core though 
 Everything same as it's always been only more so 
 Of course so same token, while there's life there is truth 
 While there's truth it demands to be spoken 
 And someone's gonna speak it 
 It's really not a secret 
 You just need to search it 
 You just need to seek it 
 And though we like to worship a genius in a coffin 
 We often forget that there's prophets among us walking 
 And I know because I hear 'em when I am in the clouds 
 And I got my music up and jamming it loud 
 And dammit whatever I am or could ever become I'm positive that I will 
 Always be a fan in the crowd 
 So gimme gimme gimme 
 Dylan and Biggy 
 Hit me with Jimi, Emily Dickinson, Eminem, Nikki Giovanni 
 Lennon, Kendrick, Gambino, Rafa, Chinaka, Dahlak and Missy, 
 Saul and Beau and Paul and Kweli, Chali 2na and Chance and Seneca 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 I was thrown in the mix, saying 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean 
 You've made a place where I'm welcome 
 And although I give voice to it seldom 
 Know I love you 
 Nobody's above you 
 And if you love someone then you tell them 
 So if you're blocking the future I wanna to walk toward 
 Suit yourself we're gonna lock swords 
 But it's a wash if you're saying "Watsky I could rock withcha if you didn't talk 
 Like some nails on a chalkboard 
 I can tell, that you're really on your dope writer tip 
 But you'll trip if you don't try to fit 
 Maybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit 
 And sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip" 
 Shieeet I say no sirree 
 I can smell the weak shit through the potpourri 
 So I'm just gonna do what I do 
 You take a minute or two and Google "Tim and Magoo" 
 I love the that life I picked even if it ain't plush 
 I'm too glad complain much 
 I'm in the lab in a drab world 
 While these fuckers dab and do dabs and I dab on my pad with my paintbrush 
 This is for the kids whipping up some home-cooked 
 Spitting 86 bars, fuckin' no hook 
 Lying in the grass 
 Passion their chest 
 And a ballpoint pressed in their notebook 
 Listen to me, this is for the word 
 Looking so fine I'm rubbing coconut oil up in the crack of dat spine 
 This is for the times I'm reminded my mind isn't mine alone 
 This if for the poems and the lines 
 (And the letters in 'em) 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 I was thrown in the mix, saying 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean 
 (Go in poet!) 
 86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean 
 You've made a place where I'm welcome 
 And although I give voice to it seldom 
 Know I love you 
 Nobody's above you 
 And if you love someone then you tell them
