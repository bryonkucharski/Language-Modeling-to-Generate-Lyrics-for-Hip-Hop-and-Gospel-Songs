One day you opened up your eyes inside of you 
 Inside a world inside a universe you didn't get to choose 
 You didn't get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace 
 Or cast the cast and crew you didn't get to pick your starting place 
 And though it was a race you didn't understand 
 You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran 
 And when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground 
 And picked your scabs you knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began 
 As you got older there were days of cold surrender 
 Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor 
 But as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view 
 By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew 
 Yet there were moments 
 There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head 
 Outside your pain outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage 
 Outside the need to get it, get it, you will never get it, that's okay 
 Have you felt a little off today 
 Had a lot to say 
 But wound up talking to yourself? 
 Have you hunted for a kindly ear 
 But couldn't find one near 
 And wound up talking to yourself? 
 Had a little spot where you been going through a lot 
 Wanna shove it to the bottom but a trouble gonna bubble to the top 
 Then the bubble gonna pop and the hustle never ever gonna stop 
 'Cause you get up in the morning get ahead then get to bed 
 And then you do it all again until the moment that you drop 
 You need a plot, what you wanna witness with this life you got 
 You kicked and fought trynna get up in your skin and pick this lock 
 That ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu 
 Issues someone fit to quick should sit you should down to talk 
 Ever wonder who's the crazy the one, people walking to work as if nothing is off 
 But if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle 
 On somebody's head and looting from shops 
 Are there times you're alone now when nobody's home 
 But you walk around muttering under your breath second shit 
 Saying goddammit goddammit goddammit just whispering soft 
 Do you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts 
 Tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through 
 When you tie your stomach into knots that you don't know how to undo 
 But do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see 
 There's no one way this has to be? Or maybe that's just me
