Swing, out of your shoes 
 And if you should lose this time 
 Keep on swinging and swinging and soon 
 When you connect 
 With all of your strength 
 Look up and you might see a dent in the moon 
 Yeah, you see them craters? 
 That was 'cause a kid said there'd be none greater 
 In ten years Hammering Hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later 
 Skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack 
 Watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap 
 Watch him rinse and repeat till he's on the map 
 Going from the cheap seats to the autographs 
 Papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever, ever, ever rock a Dodger hat 
 And whether you win or you didn't you gotta be getting dirty 
 And we better send your jersey to the laundromat 
 It was in the cards 
 I knew someday I'd be a big league star 
 Playing second base for the Giants wearing number 9 rocking knee-high socks 
 If I just worked hard 
 We had our 6th grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts 
 So a fastball-had hops 
 We didn't have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders 
 Off the asphalt-I dropped 
 A lot and so he hit 'em faster and I took 'em off my ankles 
 Yelling that's all you got? 
 And when I saw my name on the roster I went insane 
 Like I was sniffing bath salts, I'm not-here to play soft 
 I'll go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off 
 Until it rains candy out of its neck-hole 
 I don't go flexing my pecs, or get swole 
 I wasn't the fastest 
 And when I moved it kinda looked like I was running through molasses-true 
 It's silly to give a shit about a game but earth 
 Is a little ball that's spinning on its axis-too 
 I wasn't cut out for the bigs, guess I been a fool 
 And middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule 
 But when you step into the ranks of the man 
 It's like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool (thanks) 
 It's time to ballroom waltz that plank 
 We're little minnows in a small shark tank 
 You try to swim without getting blood in the water 
 But you're all heart and guts like a ballpark frank 
 Never an all-star 
 I had to keep score 
 If I were perfect I would quit and join the Peace Corp 
 I'm not a hero, if I didn't try my doubts eat at me 
 Like I'm a carcass on the sea floor 
 So say this shit is too corny 
 It tastes better to me than, 'ooh poor me' 
 I'm just trying to sing a different tune 
 And then fit into a world that didn't have room for me
