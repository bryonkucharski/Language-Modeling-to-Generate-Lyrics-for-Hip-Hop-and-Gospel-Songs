I tend to vent a lot. it's hard to end a thought 
 I get pent up and I guess I don't know when to stop 
 If I get a mental block, you can hear a pencil drop 
 But if not I'm all talk like a rent a cop 
 I don't wanna mock 
 Ever yet I let it slip 
 Said I gotta get a grip 
 'Cause I know you're delicate 
 And I'm pretty adament 
 I can learn some ettiquette 
 Bet on it that I can talk a book and never edit it 
 Seldom elegant, guilty of embellishing 
 Yelling but I'm holding shit together like I'm gelatin 
 Everyone's selfish and jealous, I'm hella slim 
 But I gotta bigger mouth than a pelican 
 Check a fella sing, messing up the melody 
 I know my alphabet, A to Elemopee 
 I like you, it's shouldn't be shocking 
 My heart's beating just as loud as I'm talking 
 Danny: I know you know 
 I know you know 
 Sometimes I say things 
 I don't quite mean 
 George: don't be alarmed 
 I mean no harm 
 Danny: Ca-a-a-a-an't I run my mouth? 
 I'm a fast talker 
 Louder than a brass knocker, 
 Cricket or a grasshopper 
 Not another. word 
 I don't want to ass kiss 
 Sniffing like a mastiff 
 That'll be my last ditch 
 Effort to be. heard 
 Take me as a hostage 
 I'm feeling lost 
 With my neck out like an ostrich 
 Totally absurd 
 I squawk like a bird 
 Cause my clumsy heart feels like it's doing cartwheels 
 Put me in a dunce cap 
 Treat me like a hunchback 
 Say my mind is one track 
 Every single. day 
 Call my mug a megaphone 
 I don't beg and moan 
 If I get in bed alone 
 I don't want to say 
 You're forgiven briefly 
 If I call you sweet pea 
 Then you say to eat me 
 And I don't know which way 
 I've had a taste and I know you're gourmet 
 An argument's just the makeup foreplay 
 George: 
 Danny: Listen 
 Calm down 
 Hear me 
 Watch your mouth 
 Careful 
 That stung 
 Give me lip 
 Bite my tongue 
 I'd say 
 Stop it (that) 
 But we both 
 Talk shit (trash) 
 How about we work it out? 
 (Repeat) 
 Chorus after Bridge 
 Danny: You know, I know 
 You know I know 
 Sometimes You say things 
 You don't quite mean 
 George: I'm not alarmed 
 If you mean no harm 
 Danny: Go ahead and ru-u-un your mouth 
 Take the silent type, gimme the opposite 
 You look so damn sexy when you're talking shit 
 Every time I want to say to put a sock in it 
 I melt again and buy your ass a box of chocolate 
 I guess that's why they call me georgie porgie puddin' pie 
 Before I kiss my girl I put her on a sugar high 
 And then we cry after a little old 'how are you?' 
 Turns into an argument I bet'll scar you 
 Is it hard to always have to complain 
 Taking something mundane and give yourself a tongue sprain? 
 You talk about your day and go off for a year 
 And I could walk away or hold the phone off of my ear 
 I don't love what I hear, but I've got to stay 
 Cause man, smart girls have a lot to say 
 I want to shout with someone that I'm down with 
 There's no one I'd rather run my mouth with 
 Chorus (fade out)
