Never have I ever seen Passion of Christ 
 Never have I ever crashed on a bike 
 Or been trapped on an island and had to survive 
 And yeah I've been trashed a Saturday night 
 But never have I ever smoked crack from a pipe 
 I've never started one slow clap in my life 
 I never ever sat first class on a flight 
 Or drank cognac from a bird bath 
 Never tried to fly 
 And yeah, I'm known to cop a dub sack 
 But never have I ever rolled my own blunt wrap 
 Never have I banged to Purple Rain or Dove Shack 
 Never have I ever loved and been loved back 
 Fun fact 
 'Cause I've had a broken heart 
 But I've never ever ever ever put a woman over art 
 And I'm never gonna start 
 Never cheated on a chick 
 But ask me if I've lied, then I'll likely plead the fifth 
 Never have I seen a ghost or a spirit 
 But if one appears then I'll know when I'm near it 
 And if I ever paid a prophet I'd be quick to repent 
 But I've never known Jesus in the Biblical sense (Ah) 
 But I've I think we'd be friends 
 If he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem 
 I've never kissed a dude (Ew) 
 Well that's partly true 
 Are we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party too? 
 Oh my god, so gay 
 Pause 
 (Tick, tick, tick, tick) 
 Press Play 
 I've never raved 
 I never been tased 
 Never maced or been maced 
 Or been punched in the face 
 Never have I ever contemplated suicide 
 Or been crucified 
 Never have I ever mooned another driver 
 From the side of my hooptie ride (whoop-whoop) 
 Never have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride 
 And I can't really tell 
 If I'm a good person or I'm faking really well 
 'Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone 
 But I never really went to visit Grandma at the home 
 And I've always known 
 That I won't be happy 
 Until I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone 
 So fuck thinking of marriage 
 Until I learn to put another person first and be a parent 
 I pinky swear it 
 I don't know much I 
 I won't know much I 
 I won't know much until I 
 Till I know myself 
 I know I don't know much, I 
 No, I don't know much, I 
 No, I won't know much 
 Till I 
 Till I know myself 
 I know I don't know much, I 
 No, I don't know much, I 
 No, I won't know much 
 Till I 
 Till I know myself
