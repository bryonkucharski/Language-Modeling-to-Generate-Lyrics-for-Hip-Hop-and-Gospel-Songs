Suspended the same month I won the city science fair 
 I won most likely to succeed and teacher's nightmare 
 Guess I was quite scary, some hate a binary 
 Sent to the principals office straight from the library 
 But since my voice was about as high as Mariah Carey 
 When I had the douchey spiky hair like Guy Fieri 
 My flavor was a mystery you never knew 
 What you were getting it could be some mild or some Wild Cherry 
 Just read my diary, 'cause I'm wirey 
 But I'm irie, and I spit it firey, hire me 
 I wouldn't hurt a fly 
 Though sensitive you never heard me cry 
 But I got a certified dirty mind 
 So grab some turpentine, a dash of Listerine 
 And splash my mouth out with a gallon jug of Mister Clean 
 I'm flashing on every asshole up in the classroom 
 I'm planning on coming sick I hope you had your antihistamines 
 Before I split the scene, and we can puff pass 
 'Cause I'm an honor roll kid who liked to cut class 
 A babyface but I tend to shave with a cutlass 
 And If you switch the picture to HD you'll see my mustache 
 I tend to slow it down when they want just fast 
 I'm a vegetarian who thinks that PETA sucks ass 
 I bring the ruckus, while shmucks be kissing my tuchus, 
 I bookishly bust it nasty, you should be rocking a dust mask 
 I like smoking dope, but won't pop a pill 
 I think Oprah's ill, but I loathe Dr. Phil 
 I got the propers to a topple your whole metropolis 
 Stomp an impossible obstacle I won't be stoppin' to chill 
 From Chapel Hill to the big apple I travel the map 
 Just trampling bastards but then I handle their hospital bill 
 If there's bees in the trap I'm catching em 
 By the thorax and abdomen 
 And sanding the stingers down to a rough quill 
 Then I dip 'em in ink, and I scribble a bit 
 But if it they wriggle then I tickle 'em until they hold still 
 Lemme say it again 
 In my land of pretend 
 I use bees as a motherfuckin' pen 
 But a lot of the guys I know 
 Have been saying that I'm so so 
 They're not a believer 
 That I'm a keeper 
 B-b-But I don't know 
 Maybe it's 'cause I be looking like Leave it to Beaver they're thinking that I don't flow 
 Even if I could be running in circles around 'em as if I'm gyroscope 
 I'll enter the draft and I'm thinking I might go pro 
 Running the jungle like I'm an albino rhino 
 Deep in the undergrowth 
 Fuck a disaster, bring on the asteroids 
 Never gonna be massacred like all of the dinos though 
 Bring on primal vinyl magic show 
 I'm turning a blind eye to the bull crap, waving bye bye 
 Zippity doo dah 
 Suck on my booty 
 Done with the bad luck 
 Put on my brass knucks 
 And I cold cock any Pol Pot in the whole spot, with that boom 
 I'm Fiddler on the Roof 
 Hitting Hitler in his fruits of the loom 
 I'm Jew, on the right side but it's true 
 I'm a Christian on the left 
 Side of my family crest, dude 
 I've been to public school and private, 
 Been unpopular and popular and I don't think people pop from a test tube
