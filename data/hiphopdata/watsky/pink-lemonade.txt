Air salad 
 Sex vinaigrette 
 Intravenous internet 
 Jazz cigarettes 
 Blazé frenzy 
 Officer friendly 
 Venti Trapaccino 
 Gluten free Henny 
 Crocodile skin in the Bentley 
 Graveyard shift at the Denny's 
 North side plenty, south side pennies 
 I vote Yeezus/Deez Nuts 2020 
 You want to run a country? that makes me shiver 
 Bitch I wouldn't trust you to run with adult scissors 
 Flushed ass face 
 Flash that cash 
 Your fleshlight wouldn't let you smash 
 Collection plate passing through the church benches 
 Pastors pull up to their chapels in Benzes 
 I guess that I musta missed class that day 
 It's so senseless, baby please pass that J 
 How do you make pink lemonade? 
 (Pink lemons!) 
 How do you make pink lemonade? 
 (Pink lemons!) 
 Is it real? (Yeah!) 
 Is it real? (Yeah!) 
 Good! We only want it if it's real 
 Can't bear a bear market with a bare body 
 Rich heir-hot air choking errbody 
 They swore you'd soar, check your sore body 
 See the sweat pour from each pore of your poor body 
 Someone wise once wrote 
 "Our world's divided into two types of folk 
 Now there's the type of people who divide the world into different types of people 
 And then there's the type who don't" 
 My uniters, crack a beer on the couch 
 If we're not eye to eye I'm hearing you out 
 And my dividers, get your center-part ready 
 'Cause I'll divide your skull with a dull machete 
 We don't play 
 Fetch or rollover 
 No way - it's cold shoulder 
 For Machiavellian, Martin Skhrelian suit and tie soldiers 
 How do you make pink lemonade? 
 (Pink lemons!) 
 How do you make pink lemonade? 
 (Pink lemons!) 
 Is it real? (Yeah!) 
 Is it real? (Yeah!) 
 Good! We only want it if it's real 
 Uh oh, uh oh 
 I lost my ticket to go to the gun show 
 I was gonna be front row 
 My mind it used to be sharper than CutCo 
 Uh oh, uh oh 
 Somebody came at me cutthroat 
 Broke open my dome and graffiti'd inside on the stucco 
 Fuck no 
 I'm gonna shine like DayGlo 
 We gotta show 'em how the locals who come from the Bay go 
 Beethoven lovers or Juggalos chugging a Faygo 
 Welcome 
 Got a caseload of queso 
 No filet mignon but plenty of steak and potato 
 Pay no attention to henchmen, okay bro? 
 No way Jose Canseco 
 If I'm a shark I'm not your Great White I'm maybe a Mako 
 Makeover, without taking over some shit not a day go by
