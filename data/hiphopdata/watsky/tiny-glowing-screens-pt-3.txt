You're officially welcome to grab your crotches 
 Synchronize your watches and pour us a couple scotches 
 People still as statues can't catch you, turn pockets empty 
 If they're packed with plenty move some to ones lacking any 
 While I take a crack at hacking the bank to jack 'em to cover high debts 
 You're screening floating bullets with a butterfly net, if there's any screaming 
 Pause it and cut out sound, deposit the slugs underground 
 I'm positive that we don't fuck around 
 No we go scooping up the diesel that's leaking a sinking tanker 
 Forever stuck at anchor like beetles get stuck in amber 
 Halted like the thaw of the iceberg that shoulda sank her 
 Halted right beside the temperature spike and the spread of cancer 
 And all my peoples' engagements and babies my friends are making 
 We quit getting lamer, days quit getting later, life quits being labor, quick- 
 You should come through to our party, dude bring your crew bring your an army 
 Youth is inside of the heart, the future can never harm me 
 We're never tardy (freeze, freeze, freeze) 
 Late or early don't worry we'll wait 'cause we're in no hurry to see the pearly gates 
 I sit outside and watch the pigeon shit and tiny airplanes hanging in the sky and then I 
 Hit a McCartney show and trip off how his arm is superglued to his guitar and then I 
 Enjoy the lovely view and stand there for a month or two 
 My headphones looping Love Me Do on repeat 
 Paul might not die if we try to wall off this diorama 
 We'll buy all the time we want and then spend it all to 
 Move this crowd-to join as converts to the church of blessed concerts 
 And then conjure up some conversation 
 Yes, I'm proud-my country is my heart and so in every combination 
 We all rep a common nation 
 That is how-I know that all we lepers and we shepherds 
 Join together now in holy congregation, everybody 
 Stop right now! 
 I want to hear the church bells ring 
 I want to see the fog roll in 
 I don't mind the muddy water 
 I don't mind the ocean wind 
 Show me I'm alive right now 
 Even if you gotta prick this skin 
 Open up your eyes 
 Some days I throw my hands up like this shit right here is hopeless 
 But today I throw my hands up like this shit right here's the dopest 
 I'll never sew my family's holes up saying hocus pocus 
 So I focus love on what is whole and chase my magnum opus 
 There's so much more life before I leave this skin behind me 
 Right now I'm feeling finer than Aaliyah in the '90s 
 Yeah, today I'm feeling firmly like my faith could never burn me 
 Like I'm apt to move that mountain just by glaring at it sternly 
 Then San Francisco used to seem bigger than Jupiter 
 From the view of an atom, the human body's a universe 
 How impossibly big it be this symmetry 
 This brutality and beauty and synergy 
 And beyond what we'll live to see, I know nothing limit me 
 Just take everything ever, and we are that times infinity
