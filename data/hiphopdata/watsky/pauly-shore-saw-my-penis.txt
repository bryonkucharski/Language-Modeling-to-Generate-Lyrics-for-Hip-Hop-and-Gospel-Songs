You couldn't see a lot 
 With our crotches under froth 
 On timer-jets the trouble started when the bubbles stopped 
 Now if you wanted you could see each little boy wand 
 Bobbing there as clear as little goldfish in a coi pond 
 And I was hot and prunie 
 As dry as styrofoam 
 I needed to escape the tub like Pauly from the Biodome 
 I know no boychik's poifect 
 But I made my lifetime's choice 
 And hoisted myself out of the moistness 
 Slowly which exposed my joystick 
 And Pauly must have seen it 
 Plain as I'm waving at you 
 Because I stood there dripping, naked like the David statue 
 Pauly I've gotta ask you 
 Because I'm just not psychic 
 If my penis was a Facebook post 
 I wonder if you'd like it 
 All my life 
 I prayed for a friend like you 
 And I wish I could see your linus too 
 But you wore a fucking speedo, you bitch 
 I can't express just what it's meant to me 
 To have my genitals vetted by a celebrity 
 And one with Paulie's pedigree 
 I'm talking Breeder's Cup 
 If Charlie Sheen had seen my seen peen it wouldn't mean as much 
 He doesn't have the Weasel's touch 
 I'm not some stupid groupie 
 This dude was in Biodome, Encino Man, a Goofie movie 
 And probably other stuff 
 I just think it's fucking nuts 
 That mister Pauly Shore himself was gazing at my buttercups 
 I dreamed to be discovered 
 I hope the wait is over 
 Not sure if this is it 
 But either way it's great exposure 
 And I can't blow this chance 
 To have a bro romance 
 I hope he picks the fruit the dangles from my lowest branch 
 I'll pick the slowest dance 
 I just can't handle this 
 Perhaps I should expect it at a men's spa in Los Angeles 
 I wish I could see your pud too 
 But I'd twitpic your dillsnick, it's true
