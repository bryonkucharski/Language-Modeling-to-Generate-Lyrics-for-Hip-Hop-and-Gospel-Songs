Ciphers in front of The Apollo as a shorty 
 Now I got a clip full of hollows in the.40 
 Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris 
 I take too long to come back, send for me 
 Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit 
 Maintain till it surface 
 The nerve of these peasants 
 Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it 
 Think they get the message 
 Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session 
 So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression 
 Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson 
 What used to be superb now is depressing 
 Negative energy 
 Generated from the snakes and the centipedes 
 You will remember me 
 I just get the storm started 
 Cold-blooded, warm-hearted 
 Either way you on target 
 Move to the side, let the lane merge 
 The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred? 
 Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life 
 Always see the crew in the hindsight 
 Yeah! 
 American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand 
 This is Mafia, veterans'll plan 
 Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw 
 I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip 
 The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick 
 Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch 
 And my car's like a spaceship 
 Got gold in my Nike checks 
 Jordans got ice in the laces 
 Pants got a gun where the waist is 
 It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke 
 Chirp, yo, Chirp back 
 Let me know who getting murked, though 
 Yeah, we getting money, nigga 
 Who getting work, though 
 And I got the Kush, nigga 
 I got the Purple, move squares 
 'Cause we got a hold on the circle 
 Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue 
 Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew 
 Homie, live life to the death 
 We gonna make it to the top, just one more step 
 Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check 
 We gonna make it to the top, just one more step 
 Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet 
 We gonna make it to the top, just one more step 
 To the family, friends, whole life is set 
 We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step 
 Yo, living my life, what's left of it 
 Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it 
 If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate 
 It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga 
 Death's a definite 
 This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it 
 Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless 
 Gun play make you do whatever son say 
 If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way 
 Put that work in when you young, you get power 
 The money don't match the running it get sour 
 Still rep the hood to the death 
 A promise is only good if it's kept 
 Niggas'll kill you for less 
 Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing 
 The window of opportunity keeps closing 
 We gon' see if you really a clutch baller 
 A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller 
 Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit 
 That's street shit, Jada & P shit 
 Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies 
 Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci 
 Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous 
 Court shit, gave them Jews money for Porsches 
 Made a couple mil for the small shit 
 We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit 
 Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip 
 Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it 
 If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about 
 Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it 
 Leave some blood up in it 
 Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast 
 The seats is like butter in it 
 No hammers in the club, box cutter in it 
 Long money and big checks 
 Get popped in the chest, face, wig, neck 
 Tre Pound, Sig, Tec 
 Play the game, get a plane is ya ship wreck 
 Learn from the best if you ain't learn shit yet 
 Yeah! Motherfucker
