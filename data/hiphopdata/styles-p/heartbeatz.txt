And my heart beats... (X 8) 
 Alone tonight, 
 Stars shining bright, 
 And I dream that you're beside me, 
 I wait for you... 
 What can I do? 
 Heaven knows if only he loved me 
 And my heart beats, 
 Just like a drum, 
 And my heart beats, 
 It goes boom, boom, boom, 
 And I'm pleading you won't let me go, 
 You started this desire, 
 And my heart beats, 
 Just like a drum, 
 And my heart beats, 
 It goes boom, boom, boom, 
 And I'm pleading you won't let me go, 
 You started this desire, 
 And my heart beats, 
 Just like a drum, 
 And my heart beats, 
 It goes boom, boom, boom, 
 And I'm pleading you won't let me go, 
 You started this desire, 
 Feeling the heat, 
 My body's weak, 
 In my world your love surrounds me, 
 I wonder why, 
 We have begun, 
 Won't you put your arms around me? 
 And my heart beats... (X 8) 
 And my heart beats, 
 Just like a drum, 
 And my heart beats, 
 It goes boom, boom, boom, 
 And I'm pleading you won't let me go, 
 You started this desire, 
 And my heart beats, 
 Just like a drum, 
 And my heart beats, 
 It goes boom, boom, boom, 
 And I'm pleading you won't let me go, 
 You started this desire,
