Uh, uh 
 We blowin' money fast on this side, nigga 
 Catch you up, nigga 
 I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover 
 Whippin' work, hallelujah 
 One nation, under God 
 Real niggas gettin' money from the fucking start 
 I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover 
 Gettin' work, hallelujah 
 One nation under God 
 Real niggas gettin' money from the fucking start 
 My Rolls Royce triple black 
 I'm geechy, ho 
 Balling in the club, bottles like I'm meechy, ho 
 Rose, that's my nickname 
 Cocaine runnin' in my big vein 
 Self-made, you just affiliated 
 I built it ground up, you bought it renovated 
 Talking plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated 
 Funny you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetratin' 
 Hold the bottles up, where my comrades? 
 Where the fucking felons, where my dogs at? 
 I got that Archie Bunker 
 And it's so white I just might charge ya double 
 These motherfuckers mad that I'm icy 
 Stunt so hard make 'em come indict me 
 I think I'm Big Meech, look at my time piece 
 It's an Audemar, hundred racks at least 
 Look at yourself, now look at me 
 You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be 
 Look at it this way, you niggas sideways 
 Always getting money, my nigga crime pays 
 So fuck a nigga, I'm self-made 
 You a sucka nigga, I'm self-paid 
 This for my broke niggas, this for my rich niggas 
 Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga 
 The thirty-six holes leave you bleedin' fam 
 Word to them thirty-six O's in a kilogram 
 Blunt tip, orange like Caviar 
 Wild 'n' out, fishtailin', Subaru Rally car 
 Out the passenger, lettin' the automatty off 
 A egg of that girl'll knock ya mommy and ya daddy off 
 Fuck around and knock the emblem on the caddy off 
 Four-shooters buggin' out, blickin' at ya caddy doors 
 Did I mention, guns from Red Dead Redemption 
 Nine mils, fifty clip extensions? 
 Hope is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flippin' on it 
 And the money's like a chair, I'm sittin' on it
