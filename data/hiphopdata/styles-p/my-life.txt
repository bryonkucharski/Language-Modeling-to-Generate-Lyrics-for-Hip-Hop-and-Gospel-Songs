Akon Styles P 
 Konvict Konvict Konvict 
 Feel This One Kon 
 Please Tell Me It's over 
 (Styles P) 
 I'm in the streets where the soldiers stay 
 You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days 
 You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze 
 Maintained in the game, and I'm so amazed 
 Only Jews that we got was advice 
 From the brothers that been through it 
 But I can ask my mother she's been through it 
 Back home in Africa where the struggle is real 
 I can say my blood line is spectacular 
 But it's a sin and I don't know my kin 
 I'm a ghost don't know my beginning know my end 
 Yo Konvict calm my soul pray that I live 
 And I hope the lord forgive me for all of my sins 
 (Akon) 
 Saw my life I could fight like a solider 
 Hustling was another mode a 
 That I can use to survive 
 Even though they said it ain't right 
 So tell me where were you when those nights got colder 
 The day I thought that it was all over 
 As you can see I survived 
 Made the best of My Life 
 (Styles P) 
 I'm a man so I shed tears 
 For my homies in the jail and my dead peers 
 Lot of blood dropped the police the red years 
 Don't show, cold sores, so the feds here 
 A lot of gangsters in my town like the Greb there 
 Outside all night 'cause it's red there 
 Want to beef, forget invest, get headgear 
 This is the town where you get down 
 And drown nobody tread here 
 I swear to god that I'm telling the truth 
 Was a felon when I fell in the booth 
 They want me to feel 
 Like I was feeling I was scared of the truth 
 Yo Kon turn me up so I can give them the proof 
 (Akon) 
 Saw my life I could fight like a solider 
 Hustling was another mode a 
 That I can use to survive 
 Even though they said it ain't right 
 So tell me where were you when those nights got colder 
 The day I thought that it was all over 
 As you can see I survived 
 Made the best of My Life 
 (Styles P) 
 I said I'm man enough to cry 
 I ought to let you know that I 'm man enough to die 
 War for the 'cause when I do 
 21 salute, can into the sky 
 Have it for the drought when the grams gon' get high 
 My friends are saying your man gon' get high 
 Slide in the five just to gon' get a buy (LIIIIIIIIFE) 
 Sixth gear, 200 trying to die on the ride 
 Now I can outlaw, still arise, trunk full of pies 
 (Akon) 
 Saw my life I could fight like a solider 
 Hustling was another mode a 
 That I can use to survive 
 Even though they said it ain't right 
 So tell me where you were when those nights got colder 
 The day I thought that it was all over 
 As you can see I survived 
 Made the best of My Life
