Exhale and ventilate 
 If you can't build and destroy then you renovate 
 Thoughts that innovate, blinding on the interstate 
 Back with the Devil when me and Death had a dinner date 
 Yeah, I'm a cynic but I don't know how the venom taste 
 Snake ain't I me, wolf is 
 Chip on my shoulder, another one where the tooth is 
 If I'm in the building then I'm probably where the roof is 
 Wonder it the angels' music is acoustic 
 Cause mine is electric 
 The depth of my soul can't be measure by the metric 
 Raised where it's hectic, black magic 
 And the flow is majestic 
 Magician on the tarot card 
 Ask myself can I disappear from Babylon 
 Been this and that, I could breathe in a store 
 Make the mannequins rap, what up 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink 
 All my niggas going to war 
 I'm a go first, ask the guy where should I look 
 On a soul search, can't cross the bridge unless I pay the toll first 
 Can't make the point unless I score the goal first 
 Pull that sour kush, I don't roll dirt 
 Niggas will clap but you gotta give 'em a show first 
 Niggas is acting, improve your improv 
 The ride ain't pretty cause the life ain't no rim job 
 You gonna break down, the down breaks 
 Standing on shaky ground or you make the ground shake 
 Niggas will merk you for a pound cake 
 And then cry about it, down state 
 Till I blow ain't a nigga in the town safe 
 Outside pitching until the motherfucking mountain break 
 Don't you ever cop no ground weight 
 Lean on the white work, nigga, that's life work 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink 
 In here for the insight, flow Gs, probably an OZ in my windpipes 
 Cloud of smoke on my frontal lobe 
 Told my niggas my vision is still tunnel, though 
 I could see the light at the end 
 I wonder why you know it's a mic at the end 
 In the audience still, I dream an end, tryna make about 40 a year 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink 
 It's like I make niggas shiver and think 
 I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
