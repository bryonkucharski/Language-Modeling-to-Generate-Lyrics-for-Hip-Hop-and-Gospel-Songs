(I just wanna tell you that I love you) 
 (And I appreciate everything you've done for me thus far) 
 When they ask we don't play around 
 Load up, roll up, and then we lay 'em down 
 Niggas hustle on the block with them thangs round 
 Keep the fast cake, keep a choppa' just to lay 'em down 
 If he try, give that lame a lullaby 
 Make him touch the sky, and if he gotta we lay 'em down 
 Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound 
 I won't hesitate for one second, to lay 'em down 
 Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em 
 I had the whole town talking 'bout what you did to 'em 
 Funny how quickly they forget what I give to 'em 
 Life or dead situations I had us live through 'em 
 Still let the ? off 
 Couple more to pick off 
 When the drama is lit you can't cut the wick off 
 Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him 
 Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune 
 Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him 
 So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him 
 Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees 
 Four door shit from overseas 
 Underboss from the other side, 
 Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side 
 Never the money, always for the love of it 
 After you put 'em to bed, I sing 'em a lullaby 
 Mwah 
 Give that lame a lullaby, bed time story 
 You wouldn't die to do fed time for me 
 You gon' fuck around and make the headline story 
 Bitch in the whip, lettin' it redline for me 
 Fuck ? get somethin' on the freeway, sucka free 
 Five less than twenty for the bird, nigga fuck wit me 
 Three less than six for the P, get it on the arm 
 Organic dope, 'cause you can get it on the farm 
 I'm a Godfather, I'm a Don 
 My ? is my word, word is my? 
 Can't be stopped in the first, or the fourth quarter 
 Work coming in on the dock, now that's a boss order 
 Big diamonds, clear like VOS water 
 Payin' money to the judge fuck a court order 
 Do it big like Frank White 
 And the K'll put your brains on the floor, like it ain't right
