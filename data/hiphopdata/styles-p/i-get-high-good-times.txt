I Get High, I Get High 
 I Get High, I Get High 
 I Get High, I Get High 
 I Get High on your memories 
 High on your memories 
 High on your memories 
 I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (All the time) 
 Highhhh (In background throughout song) 
 (Verse One- Styles) 
 Everyday I need an ounce and a half 
 S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half 
 Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash 
 So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave 
 I get, high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns in around 
 It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now 
 And I'd rather roll somethin' up 
 'Cause if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up 
 I get high as a kite 
 I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin' tonight 
 So I roll 'em up back to back, fat as I could 
 You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood 
 I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (All the time) 
 High, high, high, high (Everyday) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight) 
 I Get High, high, high, high (All the time) 
 I Get High, high, high, high 
 Highhhh 
 (Verse Two- Styles) 
 Ayo, I smoke like a chim-in-ney 
 Matta fact I, smoke like a gun 
 When a killa see his enemy 
 I smoke like Bob Marley did 
 Add to that, that I smoke like the Hippies did back in the 70's 
 Spit with the finishing touch 
 Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch 
 I get high like the birds and the planes 
 I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged 
 I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand 
 Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin the floor 
 I get high 'cause fuck it, what's better to do 
 And I'ma neva give a fuck 'cause I'm better than you 
 (Verse Three- Styles) 
 I'ma smoke till my lungs collapse 
 I'm from a era where 
 Niggas cause terror over guns and crack 
 Where a dolla bill is powerful 
 I smoke weed 'cause time seem precious, and I know what a hour do 
 High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin' 
 Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' 
 Shit I get as high as I could 
 'Cause if you see things like I see things 
 'Cause I'ma die in the hood 
 Muthafucka understand its full service to you 
 I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue 
 And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die 
 This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch I get high 
 (Chorus Till Fade)
