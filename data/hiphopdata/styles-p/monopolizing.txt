Like I'm sitting on the tear with years left ahead 
 Too much pain but I ain't got a tear left to shed 
 I'm speakin' to myself like yeah, get the bread 
 The meat and the cheese too, the money will appease you 
 In case the love leaves you, nah 
 It's only a meth that gets this type evil 
 All I know is takers and givers and fowl niggas 
 Ain't no love, they just scared to throw paper around wit us 
 And we gotta go to heaven 'cause the underground wit us 
 If we all don't blow then I'd prolly die bitter 
 I figured the equation, everything's amazing 
 You locked in the cage or stuck in the maze and 
 I burn your rat though, I tip my hat though 
 'Cause now it's been said that the game is the devil's last hope 
 I just wanna play God's house 
 I'm on the streets though, still taking the hard route 
 Monopolizing, or how this game is being played 
 Every day I sit back and think if I should quit or stay 
 In many ways, this paper be calling, this is not a dream 
 I write rhymes to keep me from falling, tryin' not to sleep 
 Monopolizing, or how this game is being played 
 Every day I sit back and think if I should quit or stay 
 In many ways, this paper be calling, this is not a dream 
 I write rhymes to keep me from falling, tryin' not to sleep 
 Kill all racks then hard crack 
 Yeah that D block bullshit, I'm still on that 
 All rappers be aware 'cause the villain's back 
 50 shots, let me see who tried to dodge that 
 I had a crime scene lookin' like we in Iraq 
 Hit the spot, jades closed and I spin right back 
 Hold up, Poovs wait, let me fix my hat 
 Now please raise the volume up so I can spit that crack 
 Smoke loud, pop perks till my lips get chap 
 And niggas I done seen grown men get kidnapped 
 All 'cause they said they stash at endless racks 
 Back on my block we used to have endless packs 
 We started with it, pulling both Bentleys back, nigga

 Insane like jackin the shinin, money rhyme it in Han sight 
 I only look for it when I'm findin 
 But you gotta find more than what you look for 
 Fool, but I know that there's a book in the jewel store 
 Smoke good, get it high I cook raw 
 Tired of this every day ghetto shit 
 Hoes, strippers that try to get fellons to get your melon split 
 But if you know the game no tellin' shit 
 These is the rules, I ain't make 'em up 
 Yeah they put 'em to sleep but couldn't wake 'em up 
 He was just in the strip club throwin' paper up 
 Now the family is throwin' roses down 
 And these niggas is yelling they gonna hold it down 
 You know the streets, it's the same old cycle 
 9 on my mountain bike, the same old cycle 
 Ghost me in the cut 'cause the game so tryful yeah
