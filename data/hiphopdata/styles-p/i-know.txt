Heroin addicts, arms got needles in it 
 Jails is packed, niggas is getting diesel in it 
 Streets is wild, niggas is all evil in it 
 A M16 to kill the people in it 
 Cocaine currency is calculated 
 A lot of wolves, but only the real alphas make it 
 If it's war then the blood gon' flow 
 I might tell you some shit, but not all I know 
 I know the coke game, I know the dope game 
 I know the shooters, the jack boy, the whole game 
 I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes 
 I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough 
 Summer time, fly niggas will pull the whips out 
 Stepping out the penthouse, the kush from the zips out 
 It's usually Black Label if I'm dipped out 
 Hit the strip, make sure and get shit made out 
 Dior, drinking Pinot Noir 
 About to open up the Carter to play Nino before 
 Yeah I've seen it before, niggas will kill you with the nina for raw 
 Mama singing Tina Turner, trying to smile 'cause we poor 
 Me, I'm with the Beamer with boys that make noise 
 The noise is real but we down to a fake joy 
 Ask me while I'm smoking the tan in St Croix 
 Trying to move around the world while dealing the girl and the boy 
 Pink diamonds, like pink panther 
 Never ask the question that the missing link answers 
 Cuban link, big knots, and thick dancers 
 This the fast life, sick like cancer 
 I know the coke game, I know the dope game 
 I know the shooters, the jack boy, the whole game 
 I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes 
 I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough 
 Riding out again I said fuck 'em all 
 Shoot a nigga first, watch the sucker fall 
 Yeah, I move squares but I love to ball 
 I'm on the sixth foul in this game nigga, fuck a call 
 Lot of cops on the block, try to duck them all 
 Lot of gunshots, nigga, better duck 'em all 
 Lot of models in this party here for sucking off 
 Lot of rich niggas really trying to fuck them all 
 Broke niggas mad, stuck on the wall 
 They don't live this life, they don't really love to ball 
 You ask me, I say fuck them both 
 45 with the grip that's rubber close 
 Keep my enemies and my brother close 
 You ain't high the first time, fuck it, take another dose 
 And there will never be another Ghost 
 I'm my brother's keeper, fuck around and get your brother smoked 
 I know the coke game, I know the dope game 
 I know the shooters, the jack boy, the whole game 
 I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes 
 I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough
