 Lettin the heat spread, yeah 4th day on a week day 
 A real strong man hear out what the weak say 
 Real small wolves tryina sleep where the sheep stay 
 Told you it's a sport like EA 
 But it'll cut you and eat half, yeah just like the DJ 
 Check 1-2, check come through 
 Cashin and bringin' up, that's what the slums do 
 Either you know or you don't 
 Either you will or you won't 
 We could leave it at that 
 I'm the sick scare, clutching it, leavin' in hat 
 The aperon hold the season 
 And I ain't stopping for the cops 'cause the weed stay 
 Got some work and I'm gunnin the club, it's kinda funny 
 But you always runnin' ahead, runnin' from love 
 Yeah, fuck the cops, slip the flick plate 
 I just bounce till it gets straight, get safe

 We turn one into two types 
 2 into 4-5's, yeah we get alright 
 Sal with some hash, burning the stash 
 You would think it from the self, I'm a rock school dash 
 Smile on my face like everything funny 
 I don't understand broke, all I do is talk money 
 All I do is see green, I'm a currency fiend 
 500 horses in that white Selly 
 First class, sitting like an African king 
 That's Frank Luke on him, get coke from Beijing 
 Nop, don don, caught a ki 
 See me? Niggas don't eat, Ramadan 
 White Airs, ball shorts, pajamas on 
 They callin me Jerry Lewis, telethon 
 Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly

 Couple niggas on the red side 
 Couple niggas on the blue side 
 Arise when I hoop fly 
 Stand up niggas, lookin' for where the truth lies 
 All shout a shoe 5 
 Man I'm Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly 
 Get empire state building roof high 
 Higher than the hollin cloud 
 But I'm still like a werewolf howling 
 Like I'm born in the chamber, you're shouting out 
 Impeccable tour style 
 No Iron Maiden to kill me, you can't block my slow style 
 Nor the fast one, the master, the last one
