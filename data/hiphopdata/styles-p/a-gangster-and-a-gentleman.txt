(Styles talking) 
 Yes, pay full attention 
 This is for gangstas, this is for gentlemen 
 There's two kind of people out there 
 I happen to be the boss type 
 I'm a product of my environment 
 Blame the streets, I am what they made me 
 (Styles - Verse One) 
 My pops came from Bed-Stuy, my mom came from Africa 
 I'm more a nigga if you know what I mean 
 They hooked up in the '70's when liquor and weed was heavy 
 And had me in Corona, Queens 
 By the time I was seven my mom left my pop 
 Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers, New York 
 Then my mom remarried, had my little brother Gary 
 My sister a year later, let me gather my thoughts 
 By the time I was nine I was outta my mind 
 My step pops didn't like me beat me outta my mind 
 Ten and eleven the same I never would change 
 He still had to hit me, aggravate a little nigga 
 Still wearin' Skippys 
 Bob had Adidas and Pumas, I could a had a pair 
 My mommy said wait till Christmas but I needed 'em sooner 
 If you heard I was broke dawg it wasn't a rumor 
 (Chorus (repeat 2x) - Styles) 
 I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me) 
 Gentlemen live your life (Live it up) 
 Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die) 
 It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin) 
 (Styles - Verse Two) 
 It was 1986 and I was twelve years old 
 That's right around the time when crack came out 
 It was the best thing that happened to me 
 I swear to God 'cause I was gettin' everything that I was askin about 
 First we started off baggin up, me and golf 
 Then shit start addin up, we gettin' smart 
 Now we on Broadway, coppin our own base 
 Bring it home and put it in bottles, send us a rottle 
 Drink an OE and scramble like it wasn't tomorrow 
 I'm gettin' kicked out of Junior High, thinkin' I'm grown 
 God bust with the yellow rabbit 
 And I had every color dealt we was gettin' it on 
 I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn' 
 Mom said I'd had to ep again, rip it I'm gone 
 Nigga get a little loony and grown, soup in the dome 
 Fuck me up worst when I went to the group home 
 (Chorus (repeat 2x) - Styles) 
 I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me) 
 Gentlemen live your life (Live it up) 
 Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die) 
 It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin) 
 (Styles - Verse Three) 
 I'm leavin' out a lotta shit, nigga it's too real 
 My alcoholic backround, the welfare motels 
 Abuse that I had to take struggle at my mom's recruit 
 How the fuck I'm gon bomb wit you 
 And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight 
 Got niggas I can't name, outta state niggas fuck with weight 
 Little brother gone but I got a baby angel 
 You fuckin' with a dirty name, don't let these niggas change you 
 The present's what you get 
 And the past is what make the man future 
 I can't tell you I ain't God or lil' Superman 
 No there ain't a 'S' on my chest, but it's a 'D' on my block (D-Block) 
 And said life the deepest lesson is death 
 I'm determined and I'm disciplined and destined to rest 
 I'm a Gangsta and a Gentleman, Panero the best 
 When I pass I'm like gas, motherfuckers 
 'Cause I'm a leave a stain that you'll never forget 
 (Chorus (repeat 2x) - Styles) 
 I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me) 
 Gentlemen live your life (Live it up) 
 Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die) 
 It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin) 
 (Styles talking in car) 
 This gangsta and this gentleman shit, is about being humble 
 But at the same time, let niggas know what's real 
 And when I say you real, I could flip 
 But at the same time, I could talk to a nigga at the same time 
 If he don't respect that, then you gotta show 'em you're gangsta 
 He respect that you show 'em you're gentleman 
 Cause you respect him as a man 
 That's what a gangsta and a gentleman is about
