Open up up and take the block over 
 Pause and stare at me, felonies in the holsters 
 38 special, don't let them bullets catch you 
 But pull out that long thing and long range stretch you 
 Lace the Easy Rider with elephant tranquilizer 
 Came through with niggas 'cause most of 'em 85'ers 
 Hit yo baby moms, embody yo baby father 
 Proud of couple rappers, they probably yo favorite artists 
 Fuck is all these charts? A lot of these niggas garbage 
 From D Block to the Bullpen we the hardest 
 Still keep that riffle clip loaded, who the target? 
 I move anything and everything's on the marble 
 Layin niggas down, roll 'em up in the coffin 
 I'm drawin from the waistline, I'm drawin from the arm pit 
 This is that front page, continue to page 4 
 Every time the D's come and kick in the same door 
 Alive niggas' time, cut short when they change loads 
 Some niggas came up, some of 'em still lost 
 Floss all niggas, that's whatever the bill brought 
 Feed yo whole team, now you being a real boss 
 Can't smell the sour or the kush 'cause it's sealed off 
 I'm lightin up the night, take flight and I peel off 
 2 guns up, yeah nigga that's 8 scratch 
 All pan like canned up, it ain't wax 
 We open up up the shop, drop down 
 Open up, we got the block locked down 
 Real niggas is reppin the streets first 
 G's coming here first, remember to squeeze first 
 Loadin up the tray deuce, sippin on the deuce deuce 
 Lightin' the blue dream, it's blue like blue screws 
 Rap of the street, yeah I'm in the who's who's who 
 I don't floss, I sit on money like the jews do 
 Robbing in the vits, another 5 star with the bricks od down south and the trap of the pits 
 I don't pump, I just come through the spot shed 
 Visions of the M8 wagon with the ostrich 
 Seats and the steering wheel, 
 You a liar lil nigga, you just appearin' real 
 Niggas know to fear the real 
 There never was a nigga like I 
 The town that hold me down like I'm big in Bedstock 
 Pull it out, cock back, nigga let it fly 
 Then a nigga gone and a riga red eye 
 My movement is laudable, my hand in 
 Any type of handgun seems so compatible 
 Rappin' emphatical, dogs so radical 
 Pull out the mack so I can rat tat tatter you 
 Nigga you should leave it at that 
 I'm a cool fly nigga that get weed in stacks 
 Driving in a hardtop drop 
 Couple homies got killed, couple homies got popped 
 Dumping seven grams 'cause the plan don't stop 
 Like when it's hot in the projects the fans don't stop 
 I'm in the lex land with my hand on the gwap 
 Off the end of island, camp 10 on the block 
 Told you 'bout the fam, just imagine when the shit hit it 
 Niggas got a pound then you know we getting lit with it 
 You getting money then stick with it 
 Pass me the mic, I'm sick with it 
 Something like Cyrus the Virus 
 Came from the dirt but my touch is like the Midas
