 Dyce talking that shhh... it (that's that shit)

 (Styles P) 
 Blunts or papers I might use both 
 Bombs and vapers until I choke 
 Smoke till I croak so I'm on that floor 
 I won Bugs Bunny money and that's all folks 
 Smoke all day, falling asleep 
 I stood awoke all day, get to the bread 
 I go for broke all day, come from the hood 
 Where they move coke all day and we toak in hallways 
 7 grams in the dutchie tho 
 Expiring the vics acting like nuckie tho 
 Boss of the mob, I ain't really lucky tho 
 Thinking of life and they praying they let Buckie go 
 Heaven got a ghetto for G's I know Fats there 
 Lighting a fat one just thinking of last year 
 Praying and a hope all day tryna cope all day, you know what 'em do 
 (Dyce Payne) 
 I smoke all day 
 Just to see if I can blow my problems away 
 But I'm still here 
 I smoke all day 
 Just to see if I can blow my problems away 
 I'm still here 
 (Styles P) 
 Gotta OC Imma light myself 
 No wifeys or homies ride by myself 
 Now what I'm going do I'm beside myself 
 I never had wings but I can fly myself 
 I'm B.I, I'm ready to die myself 
 I'm the weed man, I could just supply myself 
 Roll papers and some bamboo sheets 
 We can meet at high noon under these random streets 
 I smoke all day 
 Hitting the strain from west coast all day 
 Yeah I'm a playa but I can coach all day 
 Got me a pound but hit the roach all day 
 Tryna float all day 
 We clad when P pop up 
 Armoured vest will stay the same like the G5 truck 
 We got now, and we got next 
 So you know what we saying when we light up 
 (Dyce Payne) 
 I smoke all day 
 Just to see if I can blow my problems away 
 But I'm still here 
 I smoke all day 
 Just to see if I can blow my problems away 
 I'm still here 
 Sometimes it gets lonely 
 Smoking on kush girl 
 No shorty to hold me 
 Sometimes I might see myself 
 'Cause only I know me[x2] 
 Low key 
 Probably got a pound or an O.D

 Raised up [?]

 Hope I don't get pulled by the po-lice 
 See I'm in the game and I'm so deep 
 Knee deep

 Niggas listen up when we speak 
 On top of the game and you be-neath 
 Roll up the leaf and let me cheef
