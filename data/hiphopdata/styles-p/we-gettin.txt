Yeah Pools, turn me up 
 Trey On Da Beatz, I hear you're my nigga 
 Ghost 
 High, fly, shit's crazy, you know? 
 Sitting in the dark, sipping on the bark 
 Reminiscing the days when I was dipping on the narks 
 Pretty bitches in high school, tripping off the clarks 
 Jordan and Nike head, Perry Ellis jeans 
 Then I learnt that a sucka nigga come with a jealous gene 
 If you from the hood then you know what "whatever" mean 
 Some making a movie, some niggas is never seen 
 I'm like at the record tryna get me a better scene 
 If the shoe ain't right - Cut 
 In the telly with mamma tryna dig out a little guts 
 Hit it from the back while I roll me a big dutch 
 No smoking in the telly, but I don't give a fuck 
 I still got the bark shots spillin' 
 Niggas in the hood either walking or four wheelin' 
 The shooters get the guns but the hustlers do the dealin' 
 Move the family to the 'burbs, don't worry 'bout the children 
 (2X) 
 Homie we gettin' money, homie we gettin' high 
 Homie we gettin' women, homie we gettin' fly 
 Do this with no effort, homie we don't try 
 Homie we gettin' rich, homie we gettin' by 
 Feel me 
 Usual suspect, when the work hit the dock 
 The gun jerk first, and then it pop 
 Rather do the verse devil's ad-libs, then it drops 
 Got beef with a couple niggas, and the cops 
 I'm in the pickup truck with cinder blocks 
 You sweeter than cinnabon, you don't want me to bang your block 
 Big ditch lit, [?] 
 Run a team of bad boys like I'm Harve Pierre 
 Got classical cost on, Cartier 
 Watching you watch me, watch you high time 
 Yeah nigga, fingers to the eye signs 
 I'm a funny nigga but no joke 
 Said she was from SoHo, I said so hoe 
 I just wanna see you up and down like a yo-yo 
 Dump a bucket on ya head, no polo 
 Did you come with a crew, are you solo 
 (2X) 
 Homie we gettin' money, homie we gettin' high 
 Homie we gettin' women, homie we gettin' fly 
 Do this with no effort, homie we don't try 
 Homie we gettin' rich, homie we gettin' by 
 Feel me 
 Style on them niggas like my surname 
 Hit your girl, left her there, never knew her name 
 Rappers basketball, I'm dropping fifty, per game 
 Double digits on the boards, assist too 
 And I'm on the team with Donnie and big Kiss too 
 Rocky white, told em, you can't win 
 Motherfucker I'm cocky, you can't win 
 Cocksucker, this the mafia that you ain't in 
 For real
