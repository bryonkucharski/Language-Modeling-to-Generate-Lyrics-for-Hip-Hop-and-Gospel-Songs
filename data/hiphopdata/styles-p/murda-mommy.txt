Rafael and RJ too, good lookin' 'cause 
 I got a little story to kick on this one 
 Ghost style 
 So Authentic 
 Sitting in a bullshit apartment that is rented and my soul's tormented 
 A big pile of coke, a grimy ass bitch I don't trust for a minute because her nose all in it 
 The shit's still for sell though, my man went to jail though 
 Left fifty birds,10 guns, weed and a scale yo 
 She hit me on my jack right 
 I was in the lab blowin' Ackright 
 In the booth tryna get my stacks right 
 She said come through, because dinner lookin' mad nice 
 She went to Shop-Rite and got the chicken for the half price 
 I'm like this bitch don't cook, and me and her don't eat 
 So I know she sweet 
 Yeah her man went to jail I know he up shits creak 
 She got keys in the crib I'll get them off this week 
 So I hopped in the truck yo, blowin' on the dutch yo 
 I know I shouldn't do it but I don't give a fuck though 
 x2 
 If you fuck with a murda mommy 
 You gon' fuck around and have to murder mommy 
 I'll do her greasy like I never heard of mommy 
 ? big poppa can deal with a murder mommy 
 She said they 12.5 
 I got 125 on me, I can buy 10 break 'em down let 'em dive on me 
 250 can get me twenty though 
 Shit ain't lookin' funny though, a nigga need money though 
 Half a million can get me forty 
 Me and my little shorty can kick it like Barry Gordy 
 Soon as I thought it, heard a knock at the door 
 Pause, heard a lap cock at the door 
 That sounds like a Colt .45 
 Government issued, I'm thinking that I don't wanna die 
 My shit was on my side, pulled it out hit her in the eye 
 Gun buck, the dumb slut wanna die (bitch) 
 Door flew in, so did the mass dudes 
 Cash rules, fuck that we all gon' blast tools 
 They hit, she hit, I'm good some g shit 
 Left with the cash in the coat that's P shit 
 x2
