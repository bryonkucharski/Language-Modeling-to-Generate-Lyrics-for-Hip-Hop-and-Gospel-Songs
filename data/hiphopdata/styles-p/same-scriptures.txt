Huh 
 Word (echoes) 
 Huh 
 See the streets taught me well so I keep it real witcha 
 Cross my heart and hope to die 
 Follow the same scriptures 
 It's hard out here 
 Can't survive again 
 We got no heart out here 
 Nigga figure the angle 
 Even the reaper of death is called an angel 
 A slug to your face will rearrange you 
 Nigga will straight bang you 
 Street life will change you 
 What do you see you close your eyelids 
 Vampires, lycans and wolves a couple hybrids 
 And the pigs don't fit 
 But the snakes going hiss so the cigs going whiff 
 And the apes going blast and the whips going splash 
 And the funny thing about it is the pigs goin' laugh 
 And the raps going eat, so I rap on beats 
 Before that I had to sell crack on streets 
 We ain't playin' lil' homie 
 That's the game lil' homie 
 Don't be dumb, living for a name lil' homie 
 I did that, now I'm making change lil' homie 
 You hungry, but never show your fangs lil' homie 
 Whaddup, whaddup (ooh)[x3] 
 Whaddup, whaddup
