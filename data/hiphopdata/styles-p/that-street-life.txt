Chrous - [Tyler Woods] & ad-libs 
 Living that street life (living this street life) 
 That hood life (out on the corner) 
 Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life) 
 Gotta sacrifice (Gotta do it) 
 Living that street life (living this street life) 
 That hood life (living oh yeah) 
 Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life) 
 Gotta sacrifice (ohow) 
 (Styles P) 
 I don't need no pen, I don't pad 
 Yeah I miss my brother yeah I miss my dad 
 Wanna kill the whole world, sometimes I get so mad 
 Tell myself to slow down don'T get so fast 
 Light a bigger Blunt let the shit go pass 
 But the pain still here so the shit gonna last 
 Yeah I sit in the dark I'm addicted to weed 
 Stop buying fast cars 'cause I'm addicted to speed 
 I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go 
 I don't fit up in this industry but know I can flow 
 Why I'm standing in the ghetto when I know I could blow? 
 Why I'm standing on the corner when I know I should go?

 Trying writing a movie, trying writing a book 
 But even all alone I spend my night with a crook 
 Try to overstand, try to overlook 
 Remember how a pig and a rat had a colder look 
 I'm spiritual, I don't read Jehova's book 
 Or Allah's book, or God's book 
 Just a man and it's easy not a hard look 
 I don'tt trust you, so don't trust me 
 Bullets shiny, blades rusty 
 Fuck with me, Fuck you that's how it must be 
 This is D-Block, This is L.O.X. 
 Yeah I'm saying Goodbye but I ain't said hello yet 
 Chorus (2x times)
