(Lil' Mo) 
 Styles P... 
 It's ya girl Lil' Mo, holla at me 
 Get that cash daddy 
 (Styles) 
 If it's you versus me - think about it 
 They gon yell my name when they announce the winner 
 And I ain't bout to sell much 
 I got my honeys on the plane but the birds flyin south for the winter 
 Don't get ya self familiated 
 I'm so gangsta that, just know'n myself makes me affiliated 
 What chu think honey hold 'em hammers for? 
 So she can spend 10 cent at Jill Sander store? 
 We gon hit Rodeo Drive, drive on Beverly Hills 
 Though I love her, so I'm spendin like 70 bills 
 I bringin' what she be on went, keep ya payroll big 
 Light a blunt, and just beg me to chill 
 Ain't a player but my life is real all of the time 
 So she went and copped a gun a 'lil smaller than mine 
 That's a down ass chick, and she keep it real 
 So I'ma keep it real back all of the time 
 (Chorus: Lil' Mo (Styles)) 
 Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it) 
 Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it) 
 Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it) 
 Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it) 
 (Styles) 
 Daddy go and get that cash 
 Go and get the black suit, grab the burner plus get that match 
 She said "Tell my where you goin" 
 It's no doubt that I'm comin' in 
 'Cause she could fit a little 9 or a 22 
 Right inside her bra or Calvin Klein underwear 
 Mami you could stay home and bag up the work 
 I'm just goin' out to play chrome or nag up a jerk 
 If I kiss her then her heart'll melt 
 Listen dogg, you don't understand the work 
 That she carry in the garter belt 
 No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth 
 But don't get it fucked up, and get fucked up 
 Only thing sweet about P is his tooth 
 And she could sleep with another dude 
 She gon tell me where the safe at 
 The coke at, how to rob his mother too 
 "Daddy go and get that cash"... 
 That's what my honey holla'd out every time I hit that ass 
 (Styles) 
 Since you helped daddy get that cash 
 Get the condom and the mink, and the ring and the gift wrapped Jag 
 And you still got the bomb ass, I pay the phone and the rent 
 But keep it real Boo, you pay the Conair 
 If I get knocked, she in the BI room 
 With some money on my books, give weed to a nigga 
 Don't worry about shit, 'cause I be out soon 
 No doubt that's my Booby-cat 
 She drop my bricks off right on Broadway 
 And she go and get a doobie wrapped 
 Lookin' at the God, like "We all a little" 
 One pop for the pasta, one pop for the coke 
 Holiday Styles, dick one shot for the door 
 And it's sorta like we Bonnie and Clyde 
 I load the ooby up, she gon roll the booby up, then mami abide 
 And she said "Daddy get that cash" 
 She know I would but had no idea that I would skip that fast
