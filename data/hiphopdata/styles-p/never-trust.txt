Let Me Out 
 Dawg... Let Me Out 
 Black what up? 
 Let's Go Fools 
 (Styles P) 
 Whatever rapper think he the best he the copy 
 Need to see me, I run the city you need a block 
 Whoever your shooter is 
 Should know who the shakers and movers is 
 Know where the dealers and jewellers is 
 Hand on the gat, that's such a medula kid 
 The good, the bad, the ugly 
 When Vince made buggy eyes 
 Homicides occur whenever the money rise 
 You don't want your brains on the sunny side 
 Eggs sinking, legs crushed 
 I ain't never rapped, never said much (never said shit) 
 Niggas fed up in the fed clutch 
 Niggas on the run in the dress or they dread up 
 I know the pain well 'cause I come from it (I knew the pain) 
 A nigga catch a body then he run from it 
 Loading up the clip you hollow tip for dumb dummy 
 That's if you out there like that 
 You never let a nigga say "I'll be right back" 
 (x2) 
 Shooters, Hustlers, Private customers 
 You ain't bout that life then don't fuck with us 
 You about that mob then get in touch with us 
 But we ain't God so don't trust in us 
 (Chris Rivers) 
 The only thing I fucking trust is just my word and my nuts 
 Maybe my words, my nuts be on they shit when they bust 
 That's all I got though 
 Trust no man, woman or gato 
 Pussy got the power to turn the nigga to fossils 
 All you dimes out fucking these whores getting sores 
 Getting divorced cause shorty came to your door 
 Poor decision, forced admission, lost with your flawless wisdom 
 You ain't listen, causes a four collission 
 That's the truth nigga 
 Bet your crew would be aloof 
 Quicker than mute [?] 
 If other dudes would pull triggers 
 And that's sad, high fives and a back stab 
 When you need a nigga he gone like a bad dad 
 Fuck custody, trust is just a false luxury 
 Sleep with one eye open long enough you do it comfortably 
 It's all about developing habits 
 Watch you watch your own back before you fall in the casket 
 (x2) 
 Shooters, Hustlers, Private customers 
 You ain't bout that life then don't fuck with us 
 You about that mob then get in touch with us 
 But we ain't God so don't trust in us 
 (Styles P) 
 I'm an animal but I'm civilised 
 I'm sophisticated but niggarised 
 It's the fly shit that I visualise 
 That make a nigga ride, till a nigga die 
 So it's all for the green 
 Or the dream in the nightmare or the nightmare in the dream 
 I don't go to sleep so y'all don't know what I mean 
 You can look where I'm looking but y'all don't know what I've seen 
 (x2) 
 Shooters, Hustlers, Private customers 
 You ain't bout that life then don't fuck with us 
 You about that mob then get in touch with us 
 But we ain't God so don't trust in us
