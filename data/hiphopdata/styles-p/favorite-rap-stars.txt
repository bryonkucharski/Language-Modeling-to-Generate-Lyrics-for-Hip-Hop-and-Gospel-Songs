My niggas flippin' it all day 
 Either on the corners or up in the hallways 
 Coke from Cuba, but they got it on Broadway 
 Pitchers on the front stoop, shooters in the doorway 
 Humph humph, you want marble in the jacuzzi 
 The elevator ride to the top'll make you woozy 
 Either shootin' the Uzi or the MK 
 Starter in the game, you just get in when the bench play 
 At your door with the four, "bonjour" like the French say 
 Nigga you just plain, cut you up like a sensei 
 Take you down like the statue at Penn State 
 Get you off your feet like an Olajuwon head fake 
 Come, come, comin' with Havoc to bring the havoc 
 Lightin' the chronic, Techtronics and automatics 
 Beware of the short niggas 
 Yeah I'm cool, but I'll motherfuckin' torch niggas 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone 
 I'm one in a million, diamond in the rough 
 Supplying that stuff that got every whip that I drive 
 Tough lion took steroids, Olympian status 
 Gold medalling them niggas, ain't nothin' 'bout me average 
 Cannons bigger than me, we go deaf when we shoot 'em 
 And niggas on the floor with they cerebellum oozin' 
 Every homie I brand with them featured on Gangland 
 Ice picks in pencil pockets and nines on they waistbands 
 Money over bitches, we smother then we ditch 'em 
 I'll have 'em bag 'em up, butt-ass in the kitchen 
 I'mma leave bitches foamin' at the mouth 
 Fuck what you heard, it wasn't drought, they lied 
 Over here it's all the way gully 
 In the morning, answer to God's calling 
 Snoring, I can't afford to sleep, the cousin of death 
 The city never sleeps, so why the fuck would I rest? 
 It's all about the motherfuckin' 'jects, Lex Diamond's up next 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone 
 Pull up, clap and distract you 
 Six cars away, yo, your brother in the back of the Ac' 
 I move pistols, hold 'em like infants 
 Jump out, rims, tints, guns is French, I can dent this 
 Out in Moscow Seagal style, look at the pair 
 Don't stare when the chain is a watchtower 
 We when we comin', ain't a glock pulled 
 Rock the pajama look 
 So now drama look like an eye-full 
 Coats Colombian with money in it 
 Ruthless Gotti, leather gloves on, the Wallies is blue body 
 Movin' through the dice game kickin' 
 Should have mittens on 
 Plottin' to dig in your pockets, we break niggas 
 Jumpin' in the A8's with swish men 
 Watches is Swiss, Chase Bank niggas 
 Drop you and then sprint 
 Don't ever dare walk in front of me 
 Cold as I wanna be 
 An old nigga who pump where the money be 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone 
 All along, been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs 
 Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads 
 And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone
