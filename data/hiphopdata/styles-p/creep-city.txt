(Sheek Louch) 
 I'm a, G about mine 
 I'm always holdin' a nine 
 These niggas crossin' the line 
 I'mma leave it right in his spine 
 I regulate on these herbs 
 I'm sickening with the words 
 I pitched on these curbs 
 I'm Iron Mike with the birds 
 Hold up 
 Donnie mathematical 
 Golden cross, sabbatical 
 Black hoodie, black panther 
 Huey Newton, I'm radical 
 Fuck around with them boys 
 I'm sittin' low in the Taurus 
 Diamonds on my wrist-piece 
 Fifty-something [?] 
 The Silverback of the Rap 
 In front or back of the track 
 And from the back of the trap, we forever clappin' the Mac 
 I done seen niggas get shot 
 I done bagged up in the spot 
 I done ran when it got hot 
 I done slept on that cot 
 Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do 
 You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you 
 Get popped up, find yo ass chopped in two 
 Let's go! 
 (Styles P) 
 I'd rather be a have than a have-not 
 But there's a lot of shit that I'd rather not have 
 Drama, bein' a nigga that the shot blast 
 Hustlin', bein' a nigga that the cop pass 
 Smokin', sayin' to myself, "this will not last" 
 Lookin' at a bottle of pills, 'bout to pop half 
 I put a bullet in your body, yeah, the top half 
 You's a funny-ass nigga, I did not laugh 
 (Styles P) 
 Bloodshed, tears fall 
 Fuck the hero, it's the villain that we cheer for 
 Family, money, and weed, the things that I care for 
 [?] is a war, that I'm prepared for 
 Cold heart, black soul 
 I ain't got to be drunk to wild and let the gat go 
 Lyrically I'm on a whole 'nother plateau 
 Talkin' to the holy ghost, but we ain't in the chapel 
 (Sheek Louch (Styles P)) 
 Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do 
 You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you 
 You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two 
 (We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do) 
 Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do 
 You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you 
 You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two 
 (We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do) 
 (Styles P) 
 Niggas lettin' them hammers off 
 Givin' cocaine out like Santa Claus 
 The Phantom playin' Diana Ross 
 From a 'hood where niggas tell you to handle yours 
 You don't wanna be the one, that they light the candles for 
 Hit him in the face, broad day, like channel four 
 Ghost scientifical, think it is not typical 
 Holdin' a nickel-plate, killin', is not difficult 
 Gettin' money, imagine what I'm 'bout to do 
 You from D Block, I'll lay a nigga out for you 
 I'm a wolf, so I show 'em what the alpha do 
 Cut guts out, even chop a scalp or two
