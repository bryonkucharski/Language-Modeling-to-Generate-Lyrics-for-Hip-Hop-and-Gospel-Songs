 Bullpen, G-Host, D-Block 
 (Styles P) 
 If I say so myself, we the best 
 When the lead pop, it's headshots, you don't need a vest 
 D-Block, LOX, we don't see the rest 
 My blade cut a thousand niggas, that's a key of flesh 
 You either (-) or (-) squeeze the TECs 
 I blow a smoke with the Ghost, bars speakin' death 
 I keep her wet, straight cash, yo, I'm 'bout paper 
 Pay (-) bars, every line another (-) 
 Bullpen style, kill you now, rhyme later 
 I clip from a block away, nine with the laser 
 They can hate us, but they know they can't never play us 
 We heat-sprayers, plus you know the streets made us 
 Live life to the fullest because death is waitin' 
 Too wild of an animal for domesticatin' 
 Get a room full of rabbits and I'm defecatin' 
 Fully-loaded gun, no hesitatin' 
 I heard your gangsta rapper name resonatin' 
 We don't believe you, you'll never make it 
 Discipline - the term meant dedicated 
 Educated, actin' on medicated 
 Weed high, liquor high, drug dealers, stick-up guys 
 LOX, Wise Guys Enterprise 
 You ain't got to cop it, we got you, you could rent a pie 
 God, forgive me for contributin' in genocide 
 The cranberry Beamer, MAC-10 and the nina 
 Smokin', visions of Mecca and Madīnah 
 Mobster, kill you, send a fixer and a cleaner 
 [Bullpen] (x2) 
 You look scared, lil' nigga 
 Don't start hangin' 'round here, lil' nigga 
 This shit'll get you the chair, lil' nigga 
 We makin' ourself clear, lil' nigga 
 (Bullpen) 
 Nigga, we in here, it's me and (-), lodge 'em out the bullpen 
 Remember gettin' processed, sittin' in that bullpen 
 Thinkin' to myself, 'If niggas rattin' and some bullshit 
 I'm comin' home dumpin' out that clappin'-up-your-hood shit' 
 I had dreams of gettin' hood rich 
 This year, approachin' six figures, life good, bitch 
 And I admit, yeah, I love fuckin' a hood bitch 
 Give her good dick, she ridin' out with that wood grip 
 The front page of them tabloids 
 About paper, known for movin' grams and mad toys 
 Real nigga never back down, quit the fight 
 I lose, I'm like (-) when he told (-), 'Hit the lights' 
 Speak the truth, know these frontin' niggas can't stand facts 
 Pops taught me Santa Clause wore a Klansman's hat 
 And he rolled through the night like the Klu Klux 
 So I flipped Os of the white for a few bucks 
 Yeah, I guess I see what they can't 
 Do what they won't, then have what they don't 
 Ride to work raw, where the work, y'all, I sit and curse, y'all 
 Lodge the bullpens, Clayton Kershaw 
 Lookouts in the buildin', play the first floor 
 Yeah, it's D-Block, nigga, we come with the pain 
 Gonna cause straightjackets and shackles and chains 
 If it's drama, come and get you, ain't callin' your name 
 We roll up on you like them niggas that howl in pain
