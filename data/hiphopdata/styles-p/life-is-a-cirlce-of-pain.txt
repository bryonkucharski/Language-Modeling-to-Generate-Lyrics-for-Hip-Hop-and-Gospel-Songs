(Answering machine): I'm not the only one living here, 
 Please be considerate and leave a nice message after the tone. One! 
 (Styles): I just wanted to speak to him... I got too much words... 
 I got a lot of words... let's see... yo, yo 
 Life is a circle of pain 
 The darkest clouds, end up like the purplest rain 
 They say patience is a virtue in the game 
 Fuck it, I guess I died when my brother died 
 Cause to tell you the truth, I feel like I'm the curse in the game 
 My vision is blurred, dreams is shattered, my heart is broke 
 Pain so deep I find it hard to cope 
 Missin' your smile and missing your style 
 I figured I'm the next one dead so we could kick it a while 
 Cause your name lives on, the sun still shine 
 Every time your baby mom life up your child 
 I guess I gotta switch my angle now 
 Take a positive look, hit a blunt my little brothers with the angels now 
 Some of us fall and some of us fly 
 But at the end of the book baby all of us die 
 Word, my nigga 
 There's my brother 
 I could smile, 'cause I know he right next to Allah 
 Right next to the prophets and the soldiers that died 
 And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky 
 There's my brother 
 I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more 
 But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me 
 And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more 
 I said there's my brother, wit Allah 
 Best place he could be 
 If I could get my miracle on 
 Listen to me, I would bring my brother back in the physical form 
 Cause the spirit still here, but the visual gone 
 And sometimes I gotta think if I'ma live to the morn 
 I guess it's no more schooling you 
 I know it's something in our blood, because us niggas in the street as usual 
 Left with a robbery charge, pack and a stash 
 Crushed a lot of niggas that it happened to gav 
 But I'ma just light a blunt, look in the clouds 
 And I'ma ask my little nigga what's happening hav 
 You died on mothers day, mom it's a gift 
 I know god took my brother cause his honor and strength 
 And we all gonna die Allah tally us up 
 While you there say what's up to lil malla and duck 
 And I know y'all niggas restin in peace 
 You might be gone, but your soul is still here and is blessin the streets 
 There's my brother (My niggas) 
 I could smile, 'cause I know he right next to Allah 
 Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died 
 And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky 
 There's my brother (My brother) 
 I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more 
 But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me 
 And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more 
 I said there's my brother, wit Allah 
 Best place he could be 
 I could see you when I'm all alone (I see you) 
 So I guess I'm not all alone, I know my little nigga callin home 
 The good die young, so they could get to heaven early 
 And watch over the rest of the slums (watch over us please) 
 Move the clouds so we could see the rest of the sun 
 You might've died, but you in heaven that's a blessing in one 
 Nigga Robert to the death, Gary died wit a close friend 
 You and Allen together, smiling together 
 It's like now I could hear the world 
 I understand that, I'm in the physical you're in the spirit world 
 I see you when I get home 
 They can't separate brothers, so I still see you when the spit flown 
 You died, I died (you still here) 
 But I'm alive, you alive, so we gotta keep the shit going 
 Now I got a new ghost 
 And a baby brother angel I could feel, every time the wind blows 
 There's my brother (My niggas) 
 I could smile, 'cause I know he right next to Allah 
 Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died 
 And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky 
 There's my brother (My brother) 
 I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more 
 But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me 
 And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more 
 I said there's my brother 
 This is where all the people we lost 
 Right here, they ain't goin' no where 
 It's all love 
 This is just the first right daddy 
 The next one is the next one 
 Do the best you could, hold your head 
 You know; you lost somebody, you gain a angel
