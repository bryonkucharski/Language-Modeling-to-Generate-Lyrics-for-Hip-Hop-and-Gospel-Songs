I gotta few things I wanna ask the Lord 
 Why my people gotta be so poor, feel me 
 And why's it so rough when you're young and black 
 They say you go to jail or get strung on crack 
 Why the girl have a baby she was twelve years old 
 Ask the state why the cell's gotta be so cold 
 And why these niggas here with so many years 
 Whole family in court crying so many tears 
 Can you picture us living with hope [hell no] 
 When the same ones hanging us is giving us dope 
 Shit, it's hard to get by 
 I pray to God it's still hard to get by 
 Just wanna hold my son [my man] 
 But I can't leave my house until I load my gun 
 I gotta grab my sword 
 And when I die I got some things I wanna ask the Lord 
 Like, why we dying from AIDS 
 And why on TV it's aight to be gay 
 Ain't that sorta like my gun got the right to be waved 
 If I could sit back and watch a whole cipher of slaves 
 Ask my man where the blacks at 
 Ask myself where the next Malcolm X at [I don't know] 
 Is he makin' Salat, or upstate like a ape in a box 
 Am I a human or a fallen angel 
 Got to pray by myself 'cause I'm out of angle 
 I ain't facin the east, tell the brothers I was shakin the beast 
 Had the nine and the eight in the streets 
 Open your eyes, stay wise, 'cause even Satan is deep 
 I pray for a better living 
 Even though I think I'm better dying 
 Why, 'cause I'd rather hear the angels singing 
 Why, and I don't wanna hear my people crying, feel me black 
 We ain't gotta die no more, I said we ain't gotta die no more 
 Black woman Listen 
 You ain't gotta cry no more, I said you ain't gotta cry no more 
 Black child Listen 
 We gotta provide for y'all, I said we gotta provide for y'all 
 Devil man Listen 
 We got a surprise for y'all, I said we got a surprise for y'all 
 Black man Listen 
 'Bout to be on some clever shit [I got to be] 
 I gotta think if the president is prejudice 
 And that's another eight years down 
 The 500 year warn, that's a eight year round 
 I don't really mean to sweat it 
 But the war been on before they came on your TV and settle 
 They don't need lead to shoot ya 
 Why would a man make a computer to head the future 
 I think about it in a weed session 
 They said better technology, all I see is regressin 
 Blew up our buildings in fact [blow us all up] 
 But if they live under the sun then them children is black 
 'Fore the devil get more time I'd rather see the world cease 
 Hit the afterlife of world peace 
 Where black men don't die, the women don't cry 
 And the little kids get provided for and play in the sky, what
