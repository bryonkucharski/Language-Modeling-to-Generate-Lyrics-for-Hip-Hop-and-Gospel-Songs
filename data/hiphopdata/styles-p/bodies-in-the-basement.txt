Bodies in the basement 
 Bodies in the basement 
 Bodies in the basement 
 Get your ass turned into a memory 
 Bodies in the basement 
 Bodies in the basement 
 Rock 'em off more 
 Bodies bodies in the basement 
 If you left it up to me, yeah all of 'em be shot 
 Cocaine, red rum, heroin, automatic gun 
 Watch the led come, twerking money then spread some 
 Nigga you'd die if you'd try me 
 Warner Brother, my gun is Death Jam, Joey ID 
 Definitely won't jam when you ride up beside me 
 Straight pound, straight A, bring 'em on my paydays 
 And every day is payday 
 I shoot yo shit down like mayday 
 Ain't a better rapper, if it is, I don't know of em 
 My raise is hoe ass bitch and she's blowin' em 
 Cuban necktie off buck 50 
 Realest nigga in rap, come fuck with me 
 Niggas know and bitches too 
 LOX, D block, sickest crew 
 123, showin what the 4 5th will do 
 I don't give a fuck about your family that's missing you 
 Pretty watch and the pretty whip 
 Pretty much it's a pretty gun I get busy with 
 Playin' belly dancing, little fizzy shit 
 Think the killa nigga want some silly shit 
 Silly niggas gotta die too, I'm serious 
 You crip a piroo, couple niggas is curious 
 Now I'm in my own gang and my style's furious 
 Hating niggas, banging niggas, 
 Wolf pack niggas, show the fame niggas 
 Quiet niggas do yo thang nigga 
 To calm down I need a bunch of weed 
 Or I'll crack yo head like a pumpkin seed 
 Or a sunflower, or the shell on a walnut 
 I'm G'd up but I'm all nuts 
 Or coocoo, or loco 
 But I'm just fine with a 9 and trade ocho 
 Stay the fuck away from me if you talk to popo 
 This is beast music provided by Scram and I 
 Light it up nigga, get phantom high 
 Try to keep up with the Jones 
 Keep up with the beats and keep up with the poems 
 Spittin' out the dome while I'm lightin up the zones 
 See that, or see me lightin up the chrome 
 You ain't fuckin' with me nigga, neither is yo homeboy 
 Hardest nigga out, standing all alone boy 
 You want the title? Set the match up 
 I'll push you down and you ain't getting back up 
 I'll fuck around until you're back up 
 Phase 2: niggas gonna say go slate you
