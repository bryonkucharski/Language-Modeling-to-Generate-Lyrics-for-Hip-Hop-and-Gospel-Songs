Wha, wha yeah 
 It's like a team over here daddy 
 One for all, and one for one [let it flow, flow, flow... ah yeah...] 
 If it ain't that then it ain't right 
 If you be knowin' that, you'll be aight 
 My heart goes out to the homeless and poor 
 And my niggas in the bing that didn't go to the board 
 Wit a 25 to L on your back the shit is too cold 
 And for the kids that didn't get they school clothes 
 For the gods that lost they earth 
 The world's a song you'll get it back you just lost your verse 
 It's P verse the demons, that's why I'm feenin for weed 
 'Cause I don't wanna forfeit first 
 I could even bust my gun and do some office work 
 But I still wanna off this jerk [shit...] 
 I can't leave it out my rhymes [why] 
 'Cause it be part of my dreams, to see 20 porsches murk 
 Three houses for the family, two for the niggas 
 When I die I was true to the niggas [true soldier] 
 And I never practice voodoo 
 But it's like Black Magic how I spit this fluid to niggas 
 (CHORUS: Angie Stone) 
 How do you go all this way 
 Maintain through all this stress and pain 
 There's gotta be a better way 
 There's gotta be a better way yeah 
 If I should give up hope today 
 Please would you help me find my way 
 All I really want... 
 Is to just realize that we can just get high yeah, yeah 
 Ask God when he stoppin' the pain 
 A fiend got a shoelace on his arm and he poppin' his vein 
 And the needle look dirty but I'm close to reaching thirty 
 And the only thing I know it's a profit to gain 
 I might cry but I'm still cold 
 I might be cold but I still cry 
 And bottomline I'ma still die 
 I can see the doors openin now 
 I can see the ghost floatin around 
 That's why P come down with the potenest sound 
 Spit the shit that'll open the ground [crack the ground] 
 My third eye got a horoscope [see it all] 
 So if you wanna know my horoscope, listen to the bars I wrote 
 Build and destroy 
 Come through the strip wit, bricks of the girl and keys of the boy 
 'Cause all I really want [what] 
 Was a gun and blunt, a lil money and some keys to a TAURUS 
 My whole life been a sacrifice 
 So if my nigga need my help he ain't never gotta ask me twice 
 I'm the nigga you could kick it wit 
 You gotta spot you wanna rob I'm the nigga you could stick it wit 
 I'm in the studio, I'm droppin' pain on the beat 
 I'm famous indeed, but those is two differences 
 They tryin' to understand me, but I overstand 'em 
 I'm the flowin phanthom, till we blowin' random 
 And to my corner niggas holdin' cannons 
 That want the money and jewels and everything 'cause we so demanding 
 To the hoes that think I'm handsome 
 That know a gangster when she see one ma, yeah money that's the anthem 
 Callin niggas like that's the ransom 
 You could take 'em you could leave 'em but your man ain't a happy camper 
 If P flowin then that's the cancer 
 Holiday the hottest shit point blank dog that's the answer
