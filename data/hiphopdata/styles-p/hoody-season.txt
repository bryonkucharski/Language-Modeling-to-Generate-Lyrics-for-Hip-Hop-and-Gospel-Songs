Tired of springs cause the weather broke 
 Yeah money and guns, we go to get them both to spot with my hoody on 
 Making sure I stay awake, blunt after blunt after blunt 
 So I stay in 
 They say money talk so I should have spoke 
 Mind nigga to the day I die, nigga, to the oath 
 Old rapper, new rapper, get smoked like the dutchie and the blue rapper 
 That's the motherfucking engineer, a nigga harder than me that's send them head 
 I put the hoody on, pull the drawer strings 
 Give it a second, you hear the phone rings 
 And I don't mean the 4G cellphone 
 Salute to the nigga that call a cell home 
 You know the goals to hold it down know 
 Hoody season put a coward on the ground know 
 Keep it real g, and the hoodies 
 Pop the shit off, cause its hoody season 
 Hoody season nigga X 2 
 Zip up pull over 
 Keep it G like the alphabet upper case 
 Your pigs, stay the fuck away 
 All I know is 4 kilos is a buck a day 
 This is more than you talk but fuck what a sucker say 
 Police coming through then its tucked away 
 If not, 3 words, duck or pay 
 Airshit, like the night people 
 You can get it for the low you know the right people 
 The day times cool but the nights evil 
 Dream weed, white coke and white diesel 
 Niggas all up in the mix, niggas used to have grams 
 Now we all up in the bricks 
 Polo hoody and the Jordan hoody 
 Got it down town cocaine scoring hoody 
 Champion and the night hoody 
 Are all black murder one likely hoody 
 I got all types of hoodies 
 Old and the new hoody 
 Even got the shooters in the red and the blue hoodies 
 Keep it real g, and the hoodies 
 Pop the shit off, cause its hoody season 
 Hoody season nigga X 2
