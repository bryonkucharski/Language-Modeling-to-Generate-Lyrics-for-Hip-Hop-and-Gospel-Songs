Beast Music, D block, yeah 
 Nigga, you know 
 I used to keep money in the shoebox 
 Knockin' if I die, the night from 2 Pac 
 Or into the stage from buckshot 
 Dream of the Europeans standing at the bus stop 
 Headed to a fuck ass stop job 
 Never seen a fuck boy I would not rob 
 That's why I thank God for the contracts 
 Run up with niggas that would push the wig, be your mind back 
 Reckless, less wreck, less def 
 Nigga just come up off the necklace 
 Matter fact, you can keep that 
 Get the safe ready, know where you sleep at 
 Hit yo man up, did you peep that? 
 You don't want me assin with a B fat 
 Getting in like a key in the keyhole 
 Leave a nigga dead just for a kilo 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, hey yeah yeah 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back 
 Back 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, hey yeah yeah 
 I loves the music 
 I just call it believe in it 
 Take it back 
 I used to move the C and the D rock 
 Knockin' every day, struggle from BI 
 Malcolm, Raekwon and Ghostface, purple tape 
 On the crib yo, that means I'm working late 
 New 25, IRS with the snitchers 
 125th pictures with the fly bitches 
 That was the days of the Willy murda 
 Now I'm getting any nigga in the city murdered 
 European vehicle sippin swerving 
 914's the call, 911 
 If I said I'm gonna get you 'cause the time gon come 
 It ain't Nore or Vado but the Slime gon come 
 Oozing out yo eyes and yo ears 
 And I ain't gotta brag, I've been getting money for years 
 So do you, I'mma do me 
 But you could fuck around, I'll break yo neck like Bruce Lee 
 Fuck what I used to do, tell you what I'm doing now 
 All I do is make money and move around 
 It's from around, you know the shooter round 
 4-5 filled with arrows to put you through the ground 
 You makin' it rain, you throw loot around 
 Your mom got a dress, hope yo pop got a suit around 
 Get a candle to circle the whole crew around 
 Find a nice little spot to boohoo around 
 '90 P, yeah just do it now 
 The gun is greezed, the shoe's so fluid now 
 Motherfucker this is beast music 
 All these rappers is food, I feast to it 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, hey yeah yeah 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back 
 My life ever since 
 Start it now, it's gonna have more meaning girl 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu 
 Take it back, tu ru tu tu
