This ain't something for the radio 
 This ain't something for the radio 
 This is for the niggas like me that's lettin' the 3-80 go 
 With the model chick that love to act a felatio 
 Bullet to your body, I know the exact ratio 
 Come from the soul like pasta noose and macyo 
 Plug 1, plug 2, plug 3 
 Rip slow, 1 slug, 2 slug, 3 
 On the block, drug 1, drug 2, drug 3 
 Epitome at heart, balls in delivery 
 It's hard to the day niggas is giving me the god 
 And if Satan waitin' 
 I try to kill him, no debatin' hatin' 
 I'm on all like my niggas elevatin' 
 Kinda fascinatin' 
 You down bitch? Or you in the cell masturbatin'? 
 Soul assassination, either you get it or you don't get it 
 Either you will or you won't, with the smell smoke ghost lit it 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out 
 Nustso, schizo, go for the gusto 
 Bounce when it blitz though, house of the rich though 
 I didn't wanna die from the balls of the pistol 
 Lie, keep a nigga brain fired like Crisco 
 Niggas wanna shine like the ball at the disco 
 Want that money long like a headline of frisco 
 It's not the young boys or the OG's that get you 
 Yeah a bullet might, but a missile won't miss you 
 D block on me but we went and enlist you 
 We all ball but we wanna assist you 
 I don't ref but got stripes and I'm official 
 Never been got but my nigga I get you 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out 
 Money coming and going fast but the weed burn slow 
 Other niggas will die but their seeds gon grow 
 Yeah I move H, you kept the G from the dough 
 I will lay a nigga down with the 4 
 Or any caliber gun that's in my hands 
 Defend my land and defend my man's 
 I ain't the judge but recommend you stand 
 'Cause I'm your honor when they move guns and grams 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out 
 If it's a lockout, we gon hop out 
 We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
