Zoned like the Twilight 
 8 mill a bid, niggas that live the high life 
 All of my niggas fly right 
 Whutchu know about staring out the skylight? 
 Why you lookin' at the skyline 
 Mad high, you probly readin' the high times 
 The room dark but my 9 shine 
 The room dark but my mind shine 
 Something like the cat, yeah you better kill me 9 times 
 I smoke loud but I'm on the hush 
 Weed ain't coke but I get a rush 
 Never gon' give it up, only gon' live it up 
 You ain't got to touch me, you can feel the pain 
 You could close your eyes, still see the pain 
 Every couple of minutes I'm lightin' up the weed again 
 Breathing in, breathing out 
 Goin' through some bullshit, weeded out 
 Sittin' on the couch mad high with my Nina out 
 Right path, wrong shoes 
 A pawn could kill a king but the king could kill a pawn too 
 Pray to God that you do what you're born to 
 NBA shit, no 3, take the long 2 
 Try to figure what you belong to 
 A lot of niggas rhyme, me, I smoke and make song food 
 I'm in the zone that you never saw 
 Family over everything, or what you getting cedar for? 
 Fuck boy, grimy shit is what you get, deaded for 
 Talking to the pigs is what you get beheaded for 
 Up in the spot, niggas is high like that 
 Out on the strip, nigga are ridin' like that 
 Anybody could die, it's live like that 
 Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that 
 Up in the spot, niggas is high like that 
 Out on the strip, nigga are ridin' like that 
 Anybody could die, it's live like that 
 Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that 
 Smoke to till I'm dozin', weed keep me warm 'cause I'm frozen 
 What if the chosen one wasn't chosen? 
 If everything was golden like silence 
 You wouldn't talk shit, and we wouldn't have violence 
 Salute to the stylish, styles that I'm stylin' 
 Always on the move like the meter that clock mileage 
 High like the pilot, deadly like a virus 
 Talkin' G shit, I'mma look you in the iris 
 Smoking on that loud pack, everything is quiet though 
 Starin' at the skyline, shit is lookin' brighter though 
 Caught up in my web but you ain't see the spider though 
 I ain't got a silencer, pillow or a Idaho 
 What nigga? 
 Up in the spot, niggas is high like that 
 Out on the strip, nigga are ridin' like that 
 Anybody could die, it's live like that 
 Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that 
 Up in the spot, niggas is high like that 
 Out on the strip, nigga are ridin' like that 
 Anybody could die, it's live like that 
 Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that 
 Zoned like the Twilight 
 8 mill a bid, niggas that live the highlife 
 All of my niggas fly right
