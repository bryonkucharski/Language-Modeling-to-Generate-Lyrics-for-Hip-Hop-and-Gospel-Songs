 Sour, sour, sour

 This that "drink up with it", and I can't smoke it less it 
 You drop the hits, they gon' get 
 Soon as you get rich, they gon' be 
 Yeah, they gon' hate when you get power 
 They gon' be sour, they gon' be sour

 Opposite of sweet, hottest in the street 
 I rep that purple haze, not that sour D 
 I rep that L-O-X, that's a power three 
 When you gettin' money, (that's just how cowards be) 
 New crib, new ice, new car, hatin' niggas start gettin' S-O-U-R 
 You can act like you ain't but you know you are 
 But there's nothing you can do 'cause we just go too hard 
 From the booth to the block, you get robbed, you get shot 
 That's the feeling that you usually have after gettin' got 
 Turn it into rock, or just leave it powder 
 If that haze is all gone, fuck it, roll a lil' 
 (Rocko) 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 This that "drink up with it", and I can't smoke it less it 
 You drop the hits, they gon' get 
 Soon as you get rich, they gon' be 
 Yeah, they gon' hate when you get power 
 They gon' be sour, they gon' be sour

 Ay, make the ham in a hour, bake it up, where is flour? 
 Stack that money tall, tower, nigga play, make it shower 
 I don't give no fuck 'bout no coward, ain't no "i" in "team", I'm talking "our" 
 Nigga, call my team, we in Ralph, I don't give a fuck if you in Okinawa 
 Well prepared for that slime though, I go ham though, I'ont eat swine though 
 I take vitamins, I keep iron on me, guarantee I keep more than slime on me 
 (Early morning, drink cold coffee, patron and lime, shake the haters off me) 
 I ain't jump off the porch, I lived in these streets 
 And beast on these beats, a beast in these streets 
 Real as fuck, how could you hate my guts? 
 I was just waiting, I knew you hate my guts 
 Straighten your face when I walked in the place 
 You make it obvious that you ain't proud of us 
 A1FB, we global, don't even come around if we don't know you 
 Ever since we been in power, these pussy niggas been sour 
 (Rocko) 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour

 Soon as you get rich, they gon' be 
 Yeah, they gon' hate when you get power 
 They gon' be sour, they gon' be sour

 Need a six-month, run with the Mexicans 
 I don't touch the haze if the sour's on deck again 
 'Nother six-month, run with the Colombians 
 L-O-X concern is which, house to put the money in 
 Half a stack of them indoors, half a stack of them outdoors 
 Ride around in them Benzos, fuck it, nigga, we outlaws 
 And I ain't even mad if you mad at me 
 You came, on some sour shit, I came with a strategy 
 I ain't out to get swag money, but I'm into that hard money 
 Think about all my yard niggas, bathtub, now that's car money 
 I blow a lil' haze on the appetize' 
 But you knowin' what I'm lightin' if I have to fly But 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 But you knowin' what I'm lightin' if I have to fly 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 But you knowin' what I'm lightin' if I have to fly 
 Sour, sour, sour 
 This that "drink up with it", and I can't smoke it less it 
 You drop the hits, they gon' get 
 Soon as you get rich, they gon' be 
 Yeah, they gon' hate when you get power 
 They gon' be sour, they gon' be sour
