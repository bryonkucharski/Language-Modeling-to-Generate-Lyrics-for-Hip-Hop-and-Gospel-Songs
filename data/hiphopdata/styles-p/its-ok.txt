(2x Jadakiss) 
 Niggas talk shit about us - but it's ok! 
 Game ain't shit without us - but it's ok! 
 No, you can't live without us - it's ok! 
 But go ahead, you can doubt us - it's ok! 
 (Jadakiss and Styles P) 
 Checks get cut after the clearance 
 But what we dealing with is hard work and perseverance 
 Still send a nice ransom note to your parents 
 I'ma wrap this bitch till it needs some ball bearings 
 Trying to renovate the west wing of the mansion 
 I ain't thinking recession, I'm thinking expansion... 
 I be in the malls 
 But my chain is dancing 
 More than 200 on the dash? 
 I'ma tear it 
 But you ain't gotta be nice 
 Pass off for parents 
 44 mag is the last thing you hearing 
 If the work don't make it, that's a pass interference 
 Shots of tequila, spending car money at the jeweler 
 Spending house money at the dealer 
 Rubber bag of piff 
 Sour need a sealer 
 Wanna see a real nigga? 
 I just look into the mirror. 
 2x chorus: 
 Niggas talk shit about us - but it's ok! 
 Game ain't shit without us - but it's ok! 
 No, you can't live without us - it's ok! 
 But go ahead, you can doubt us - it's ok! 
 We about dough 
 Never without dough, moving work out of state 
 In and out flow 
 Real lyrical 
 Ralph lauren table, ralph lauren couch, yo 
 Ralph lauren everything that fit up in the house though 
 Whaddup to them polo boys who know tony 
 Couldn't have been manolo's boy 
 Cartier frames 
 Clear lens tho! 
 8 series beemer, 7-series benzo 
 Mobster: I probably go to hell if my friends go 
 Never shoot in a blind fury 
 Diamonds like sprite! 
 It's lemon and lime jewelry. 
 2x chorus: 
 Rap with the connect - it's ok! 
 Hope you force somebody to test it - it's ok! 
 Lookout on the lookout - it's ok! 
 We gonna have the fiends singing like michele 
 Bang hard like the niggas out in east la 
 Know we from the bay in the pink all day 
 Still dope money in the grey mink all day 
 Just do it right, don't sit around and think all day 
 (2x chorus:)
