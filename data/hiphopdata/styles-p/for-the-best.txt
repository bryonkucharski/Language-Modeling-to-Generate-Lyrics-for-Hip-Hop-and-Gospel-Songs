Yeah 
 Ghost 
 Now whaddup? 
 I'm on my Balkin joint flow you know 
 (Dub: Music by HarryFraud) 
 If you ballin then pass the ball off 
 I promise to God that even the angel falls off 
 I might be in tune with the sun and the moon 
 But I ain't slipping on some shit like ain't a gun in the room 
 Probably burning some frankincense 
 Gritty version of Frankenstein 
 Rockers didn't make me 
 The streets did 
 I made the grind 
 I'm probably reciting Jada lines 
 Newish lines, Jet star blade in ma gooseline 
 Sitting on the balcony 
 Lounging at the Ritz 
 Guerilla nigga 
 I can hear the sounds in the mist 
 Tell 'em consigliere leave the burner wid consierge 
 Take from under the stairs cause niggas taking the [?] 
 I even know Blanco the one who sent Frank 
 And the cussing Columbians just looking to buy a bank 
 Me I'm just chillin' just looking to buy a bank 
 Constrainin the stank that's leaving my mind blank 
 Live through the worst 
 Prayers through the best 
 Drinks in the system 
 Smoke in the air for the stress 
 Live through the worst 
 Prayers through the best 
 Drinks in the system 
 Smoke in the air for the stress 
 (x2) 
 Prayers for the homies in the box to the day of death 
 Salute to the hungry, we going eat we just gotta rep 
 Hungry 
 Reppin for real niggas that never eat 
 Living in Hell's Kitchen praying to get to heaven's gate 
 They say Death is part of the four horsemen 
 With Famine, Conquest and War in small coffins 
 I ain't even [?] but yeah bread needs endorsements 
 I know I swear to God I'd kill a nigga through [?] 
 You other niggas praying that it works out 
 That's real crazy cause a jail cell is the worse hell 
 Back on delivery 
 Mar bars sharpen up the cars 
 Sharpen up industry 
 Running from Yonkers where niggas think it's the Middle East 
 How you going kill that nigga you went to Little League 
 OG's is diggin it 
 Yeah, and the young boys too 
 They say fuck that the flip is what the gun boys do 
 I know that 'cause I've been one 
 Put a nigga out when you ain't like doing the income 
 Pray when the end come 
 (2x) 
 Live through the worst 
 Prayers through the best 
 Drinks in the system 
 Smoke in the air for the stress 
 (x2) 
 Prayers for the homies in the box to the day of death 
 Salute to the hungry, we going eat we just gotta rep
