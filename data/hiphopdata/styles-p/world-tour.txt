 Uh-huh, SP, what up? 
 Slime, what up? Huh, Vado, no, crazy 
 It's off to the next life for you, homie 
 I guarantee you won't be lonely 
 (Styles P) 
 We know what money buy 
 But what's the price that the money cost? 
 The mob wasn't involved, but shorty went to knock sonny off 
 Be careful when you go to drop your honey off 
 Money off, find out what them niggas actin' funny for 
 On a world tour in the spot, where's (-), dog? 
 Fuck around and get your ass killed by a gun of yours 
 I'm a hundred bars, still'd get a ton of raw 
 Fly like them niggas that was comin' through the tunnel doors 
 Yeah, in Palladiums, now we in the stadiums 
 Weed for my Cali niggas and my Canadians 
 Probably forgot the spot I parked my Mercedes in 
 On a world tour, I got blunts and I'm blazin' 'em 
 (Vado) 
 We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand 
 Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand 
 Harlem, YO, Queens flow, y'all know 
 We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand 
 Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand 
 BX, BK, Staten Isl', we play 
 (Vado) 
 Uh, clip in the Cuban Cuban link holdin' Jesus head 
 Foot on the table cause the bottom my sneaker red 
 Sneakerhead, money flat, call it pita bread 
 Derek Jeter's bread, run the base till I see the feds 
 Huh, it's too much money the crib for 
 Could 'ford, duck and aim at your target and then pour 
 Far as eatin', man, I been full 
 Cookin' up, hear my minute soda like the Timberwolves 
 Renovatin', just bought the flash in 
 Old gangsta spot where the niggas with cash win 
 Ballgoers like lawnmowers, get to grassin' 
 Try 'em, show us Louboutin loafers we be flashin' 
 Uh-huh, we only speakin' for paper 
 Barzini, whoever set up the meeting's a trader 
 Players ball, I slip my feet in some 'gators 
 Coogi blazers, mansions, white people for neighbors 
 (Vado)

 I could never get rich enough to go and buy the ocean 
 I play in (-) and just sit up in the ocean 
 Close your eyes and you can feel emotion 
 Blowin' a lie while I'm ridin' the wave floatin' 
 Spot in the Ritz, 'nother one in the Trump too 
 Get what I like and what little brother would want too 
 Smoke for the dead, drink for the incarcerated 
 Suede parka, (-) made it 
 Loro Piana suits, smooth it if it's tangible 
 Niggas is animals, killing's understandble 
 You could manage the money or let the money manage you 
 Fuck out of here when the forty bullets is blammin' you 
 Makin' a toast with niggas niggas remember 
 Standin' in the Center, Oscar de la Renta 
 Shades, boots and suits, I'm a die a member 
 Mafia nigga with a real boss agenda 
 (Vado) 
 We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand
