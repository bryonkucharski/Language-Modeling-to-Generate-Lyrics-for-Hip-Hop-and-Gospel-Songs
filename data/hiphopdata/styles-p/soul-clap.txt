I'ma drink till I drop on my ass, this is Holiday 
 I'ma go and celebrate and hop on the ass 
 That's one more chance, Dick Frank White ain't dead 
 Think you the shit, leave me your chick, the light ain't red 
 Matter fact just wanna leave 'cause the fights is on 
 I'ma still be here when the lights is on 
 Got a fat ass in front of me, Dutch in my mouth 
 Wit a Corona in my left hand 
 You try to front I'll coma your best man 
 I keep a trick on my sleeve, more like a two fifth on my sleeve 
 Then I switch it to the trey-duce 
 In my back pocket, so me and love can stay loose 
 It's like thugs ain't partyin, I smoke 20 dimes 
 I seen 20 dimes I love they body and 
 P tryin' to score for the night 
 And to tell you the truth, my shit blown if we war for the night 
 We gon' drink till we drunk, dance till we drop 
 And ain't nobody leavin' till the music stop 
 Can I get a Soul Clap (gun clicks) 
 Can I get a Soul Clap (gun clicks) 
 Ayo shit is still gravy though 
 I keep a open case, the block hot I need a song for the radio 
 P at the club, niggas scared to let they lady go 
 Foot Locker 4 for 20's 
 Coulda had her some jeans, Nike Airs, I keep all my money 
 Still slide out the club wit a gorgeous honey 
 I don't care if it's a hole in the wall, I feel comfortable 
 Violate P, that's a hole in your jaw 
 All I want is cranberry and Courvoisier 
 I'm trying to talk to a dime 
 Motherfucker, but I still take my time 
 Cocksucker, to rob y'all niggas for y'all Cardiers 
 I got a flow that you hardly hear 
 And a gun wit a silencer, why 'cause they hardly hear 
 I got honies flockin around, smoke in the air 
 Wit a cool ass bomb like Bob Marley there 
 I'm the gentleman to hold the door 
 I'm the gangsta that's lettin off the three while loadin the four 
 Rather get a Soul Clap than clap your soul 
 Honey askin how many blunts I have to roll 
 I'ma smoke till I'm high, drink till I'm drunk 
 I'm on my tour, shit and I ain't get a wink in a month 
 My favorite color is green 
 But I'm stacked for the moment so I'ma pick pink for the month 
 If you could take a hint, then after this party 
 If you want, hop in the Viper limo with the tints 
 Got the fifty Cal, so hold that 
 Tell 'em roll back 
 I show niggas the real meaning of Soul Clap
