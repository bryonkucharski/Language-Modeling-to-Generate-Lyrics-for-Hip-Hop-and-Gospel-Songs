 Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self 
 Make the ground crack 
 Make the ether melt 
 Make the wind whirl 
 Make the river rise 
 Even pre-recorded the nigga live 
 You can't see the world through a nigga eyes 
 Hear through a nigga ears 
 Yeah, real nigga here 
 Ghost back 
 Space Ghost 
 I'll bake it up to keep the cake close 
 (Styles P) 
 Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self 
 Plug the mic in 
 Make the speakers melt 
 Touch me, I touch you; 
 Let the heater melt 
 I'm from the 'hood 
 Where everybody need the help 
 Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self 
 Plug the mic in 
 Make the speakers melt 
 Touch me, I touch you; 
 Let the heater melt 
 I'm from the 'hood 
 Where everybody need the help 
 You a follower, better lead yourself 
 (Styles P) 
 Materialistic, but wouldn't sell my soul for material 
 Homie die, we all go fly to the burial 
 In the slums I'm grand royal imperial 
 Who ride, burner with the scratched off serial 
 Niggas act funny when the money get made 
 But I ain't the turkey the honey glazed 
 Niggas'll eat your food like a plate that your honey made 
 I think of the Lefty and Sonny days 
 I inhale, I hold it in 
 Salute to the silence of all the golden men 
 Smoke touch the pain, but I just couldn't hold it in 
 Exhale, the pain stay 
 Used to pitch, the game didn't cancel on rain day 
 Cy Young; I'd rather live old than die young 
 And smile at death when my time come 
 [?] niggas even wonder where my mind from

 Let the heater melt 
 I'm from the 'hood 
 Where everybody need the help 
 Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self 
 Plug the mic in 
 Make the speakers melt 
 Touch me, I touch you; 
 Let the heater melt

 Powder, power, pretty bitches and pistols 
 Playin' you, prayin' them people do not get you 
 Real jack boys, them niggas will not strip you 
 Hit you, headshot; niggas will not miss you 
 Closed casket, your family will not kiss you 
 Fishscale niggas don't care about the fiscal 
 Time in the drought'll make a dope boy dismal 
 We can stick the spot, get paid; see the visual? 
 It's that easy, it's that quick 
 I'm after it, since crack dealers was pushin' Acuras 
 Time move forward and not backwards 
 Bastards; we take ours, we not askin'
