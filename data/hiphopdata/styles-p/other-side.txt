I love my motherfucking brothers, my word 
 If you feel right at the bottom 
 Your homie got killed and you praying God got him (pray for him) 
 Wishing you could shoot who shot him 
 You see them in the zone just know that the pack got em 
 Smile at the good look forward to the better times 
 Weed up there, look forward to getting heaven high 
 Peace sign to the sky, we'll forever ride 
 See you on the other side, knowing it's the better side (I see you) 
 I'll be down here lightin' pot 
 For niggas that got life and niggas that got shot 
 Niggas that rap nice but niggas would not pop 
 They never got signed but niggas did not stop (they didn't) 
 It's pain in the vocals, more in the dubs and the ad libs 
 If you know where the path is 
 Road to perdition, the ride die 
 Nigga jump start the ignition and you done your trippin' 
 Yeah 
 (x2) 
 Praying for my niggas on the other side 
 Represent your memory till the day I die 
 I'm trying to make it through the hard times 
 No matter what you're going through 
 You know you got to fight, fight 
 Now you're down and you're out cause you broke 
 And the motherfuckin' bills do you wanna merk somethin' 
 Yeah, I feel you (I feel you) 
 But don't let that stress kill you 
 Light it, come up with a plan to make 'em feel you (come on wid a plan) 
 You can be broke, but not broke down (don't break down) 
 There's a faith for your life and it's a close round 
 Ran to faith hold hope down, hope hold faith down tryin' to get it straight now (I'm tryin') 
 Let God, Imma need to say more, pray more, know I got sins I got to pay for (I know) 
 What you think I'd be lighting up the Jays for 
 I got a lot but I seem to want way more (I want way more 
 Struggle to make you stronger 
 So I keep the hunger just to last a little longer 
 That's why I stay reppin for the corners 
 Promise to keep it G, till the day I'm goner 
 (x2) 
 Praying for my niggas on the other side 
 Represent your memory till the day I die 
 I'm trying to make it through the hard times 
 No matter what you're going through 
 You know you got to fight, fight 
 When you die, you wanna said you ate with your niggas 
 Basically saying break down your plates, you niggas 
 Or at least smoked an 8th with your niggas 
 You don't smoke, then you should drink a case with your niggas 
 Tomorrow ain't promised 
 Tryna make the best of today tho (try) 
 As long as you're breathing, you're okay though (you're ok) 
 Light up the blunts get some more smoke 
 This is for the dead and alive and all the poor folk 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 (x2) 
 Praying for my niggas on the other side 
 Represent your memory till the day I die 
 I'm trying to make it through the hard times 
 No matter what you're going through 
 You know you got to fight, fight 
 No matter, no matter 
 You gotta fight 
 Eeh 
 Hey

 Ooh

 (x2) 
 Praying for my niggas on the other side 
 Represent your memory till the day I die
