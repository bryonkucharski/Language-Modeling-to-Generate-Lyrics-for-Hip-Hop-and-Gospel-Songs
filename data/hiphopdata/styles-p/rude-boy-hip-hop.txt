That 187 when the ghost on spree 
 I like the toy rappers run for cover tonight 
 It's 187 when the lights on spree 
 It's that rude boy hip hop, New York shit that you like 
 Vocals out of the windpipe is giving you insight 
 Real New York nigga, that's word to the pin stripes 
 Can't fly the kite less the wind right 
 Blow the city up then skip on that Jeremy Lin light 
 Yeah, I'm a shooter like Glen Rice 
 Long range and the Range the color of corn 
 Watching the Bull game 
 Like bird in the garden with the leprechauns 
 Everything is money, upper echelon 
 Cheaper than the food in a Chinese restaurant 
 On the corner in the hood 
 They come to body a man, you'd warn them if you could 
 If you can't you body them niggas and leave 'em in the woods 
 Faith before favor, lighten our senses since Scarface here 
 Niggas will kill your family for Scarface bread 
 I'm on suicide dough, SP, the ghost on coast with no strap flow 
 What up 
 That 187 when the ghost on spree 
 I like the toy rappers run for cover tonight 
 It's 187 when the lights on spree 
 It's that rude boy hip hop, New York shit that you like 
 Lyricist, the weed is the therapist, the therapy 
 Cause my pedigree is higher than yours will ever be 
 Devil got kicked out of heaven because of jealousy 
 Balls is like mental telepathy with melody 
 Niggas can't measure my wave length 
 Playing Max B when I'm pounding the pavement 
 You should get paid off the shit you engaged in 
 Fresh every day like the shit's an occasion 
 Tell my son to do what I say, don't do what I do 
 Did shit I shouldn't have done for a dollar or two 
 And you'll always be the leader, never follow the crew 
 Study today then peep what tomorrow could do 
 And you keep your ears open for wise words 
 The bird's the only animal that's meant to fly first 
 Cause you crawl before you walk and you walk before you run 
 And you fly around the world and you shine like you the sun 
 That 187 when the ghost on spree 
 I like the toy rappers run for cover tonight 
 It's 187 when the lights on spree 
 It's that rude boy hip hop, New York shit that you like
