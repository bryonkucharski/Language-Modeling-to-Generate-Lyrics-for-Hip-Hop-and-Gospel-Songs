Looking in the mirror, just telling myself to pray more 
 God ain't taking cash for them sins you got to pay for 
 Ghost here, but you don't need to the ouija to work 
 I blow the blunt, travel the smoke, leaving the earth 
 And I'm on an ill journey, you pussy then pull your panties up 
 Spit on Satan's face, tell the antichrist to ante up 
 Serpents in my sleep, bullets fully awake 
 I guess the angels got my back, or it could've been faith 
 'Cause my soul travel the earth, out in the space 
 Think of my niggas on the highway, out of the state 
 Touching weight, but a gym ain't around 
 If you're the king of the deadman, rarely do we give them a crown 
 Shit, I'm just trynna talk sense to ya 
 Said he's your homie, but I bet he won't pay the rent for ya 
 But he's chillin' and gettin' bent with ya 
 Sittin' in the whip, just thinking of what I said to ya 
 Will he feed your seed if you need him to? 
 We all follow the path that greed lead us to 
 If you bleed for me, I'ma bleed for you 
 And be right there when you need me to 
 Other than that, let's go our separate ways 
 'Cause I'm in the jungle where the lions and all the leopards stay 
 Niggas let it spray like pepper spray 
 But everybody prays for a better day 
 I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate 
 Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe 
 Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe (x2) 
 Street niggas is lookin' for a better contact 
 Rap niggas done signed up the devil's contract 
 Niggas'll leave their brother behind just to shine 
 Back then, you told him you'd give him your last dime 
 You and him would kick it, that's just a pastime 
 Now it's past times when you both would blast nines 
 All the money went where the hoes was 
 Your mind ain't designer like the clothes was 
 You a low down nigga, no love 
 No tears, no sweat, no blood 
 Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe 
 Pound of the kush in the telly, trynna levitate 
 You a bitch nigga, don't make me demonstrate 
 I'm heavy where you're featherweight, every bullet'll penetrate 
 But fuck that, I'ma meditate 
 Blowin' on this OG medicate 
 I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate 
 Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe 
 Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe (x2)
