Light it! Light it! 
 Light it! Light it! 
 Light it! Light it! 
 Light it! Light it! 
 Put it in the air 
 Light it! 
 Light it up in here 
 Light it! 
 Put it in the air 
 Light it! 
 Light it up in here 
 Light it! 
 Turned up, turned out 
 Burned up, burned out 
 OG kush and some girl scout 
 Cookies to turn my fuckin' world up 
 Sour diesel, cat piss aids 
 So high I'm gone, I'll be back in days 
 Light one, light two 
 Keep lighting up if you like to 
 I'm so high, I'll make a weed cloud Skype you 
 Mary Jane is that shit 
 Take it to the face of the brain with that spliff 
 Addicted to the loud, I'm insane with that shit 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuckin' it 
 Say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuckin' it 
 Say fuck that 
 Fuck that, I need weed (light it!) 
 Fuck that, I need weed (light it!) 
 Fuck that, I need weed (light it!) 
 Fuck that, I need weed (light it!) 
 Stoner, loner 
 Tell yo girl to bite the boner 
 Woke up out of the kush coma 
 Like it's was up next 
 Hell yeah I rap nice, it's racks on deck 
 Hit the bay and go dumb 
 New York to get a guy, West Coast Lungs 
 I always look for the angle 
 The weed is right, this is from the City of Angels 
 I need it, believe it 
 If I ain't high then I'm heated 
 But I'm real cool when I'm weeded 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Fuck that, light that 
 Police come, put it out and light it right back 
 You got a lighter use a strike match 
 I rose up, I twist up 
 I don't give a fuck, I light my shit up 
 I love weed, I need weed 
 My blood breathe, I probably bleed weed 
 Fuck yeah, I'll probably breathe weed 
 Proud head and I'm proud of it 
 In the loudest let till I'm out of it 
 Then I find more smoke till I'm out of it 
 Styles be the ghost, Cloud 9 with it 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Say fuck that, say fuck that 
 Oh, man I live to get high with some weed 
 Oh, man I live to get high with some weed
