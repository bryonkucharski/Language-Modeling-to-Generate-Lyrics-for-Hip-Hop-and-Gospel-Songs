Nah, you don't roll enough 
 Louis duffel bag don't hold enough 
 Drinking the brown liquor for both of us 
 Rose on table, Jesus head with the cable 
 Gun shots is fatal, my bars is prenatal 
 I kill little niggas, up close, peel little niggas 
 We the hottest out, still, little niggas 
 I'm better in my prime, spitting harder 
 Looking better than y'all little niggas, and I've done been here a dime 
 Your opinion didn't matter since Big heard me rhyme 
 Little nigga and Puff, or caught a spot with a nine 
 Hand all sticky, my tires is all Mickey 
 She kissing on my neck, I'm too black for a hickey 
 I'm still down with Kobe, got a feeling he could make it 
 If Miami and Oklahoma don't take it 
 Your face found up, like I won't come there and break it 
 Jake the Snake and hatchet, can't Crystal Lake it 
 Most of my goons is bow-legged, bald head niggas 
 From Syracuse, four-fifths, gold plated 
 Doing lines off coffee tables in the Waldorf 
 Nose red, walk into to the bathroom, door off 
 My man said I went raw last night 
 Heard I slid up in the whore last night 
 Still saucy, I plead the fifth, six G's 
 I sniffed if I sneeze, the left side of my nose might rip 
 Dark skin, hunchback killing machines 
 Who eat seal meat, dick stay up for a fucking week 
 Attending brutal rap battles in Zaire 
 I heard Toney Boom-Bye-Yay from the crowd, yeah 
 My man hate ice, luck smooth right there 
 Blood diamonds sitting real chunky in my right ear 
 Killas, skin your ass with no contracts 
 And little niggas got nowhere to hide but the projects 
 I just woke up, I got money on my mind 
 Grab my nine from underneath the bed 
 I put my vest on, smoke something 
 Cock my gun back, make sure it's filled up with lead 
 I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head 
 I'm coming for your head, yup, yup 
 I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head 
 I'm coming for your head, yeah 
 Ralph Ellison, invisible man, vanishing 
 Come back like Arizona Ron, speaking Spanish 
 And you're panicking, oughta stay still like a mannequin 
 Dark side like Darth, yeah, young Anakin 
 Skywalker, fly talker, rhyme even better though 
 Salute them niggas that died, those with a federal 
 Charge yo, Incarcerated Scarface, yard flow 
 Polo overalls, short set, son of Mars, though 
 Probably in the crib, getting high, watching Fargo 
 A lady cop and some hit men 
 A quarterback that coke like Big Ben 
 To a bunch of a dirty niggas like Pig Pen 
 No Charlie Brown, though, pump in the pound, though 
 Coming for your head, I run your ass out of town, yo 
 This is Sheek Louch, Ghostface Killah 
 And the other Ghost, you can fuck around and get your mother poked 
 Bees wax all in the spinners, most of my killas is winners 
 Hiding in Stevie glasses in Venice 
 Blast first, drop the burner and burst 
 Burgundy blood, fell out the thug, he got trapped by a team curse 
 I'm more relentless, aiming to strap, from off the benches 
 Hit you from right field, intensely 
 Your money ain't long, your money is gone 
 Your money mine now, homeboy, now run to your moms 
 Sorry gangstas get thrown in the hole 
 We chilling in the Trump Towers, onions and soul 
 Let's roll, 'cause when the clock hit, my niggas'll bowl 
 It's like dice, nigga, open the hole 
 Fisters on the get go, silk shirts, this is how the click roll 
 Strong hammers, doofy like Klitschko 
 And where your bitch go, surrounded by the rich, yo 
 Power mitts and bricks, yo, what 
 I just woke up, I got money on my mind 
 Grab my nine from underneath the bed 
 I put my vest on, smoke something 
 Cock my gun back, make sure it's filled up with lead 
 I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head 
 I'm coming for your head, yup, yup 
 I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head 
 I'm coming for your head, yeah
