 What these clown niggas hollerin'? 
 What they need to be hollerin', is "There go Theodore!" 
 Put the ball down, we can't score 
 They pen shit to blackboards, make queens out of wack broads 
 You see us comin'? Fuck that Fam shit, just pass off, you bitch 
 Crystal' Dana Dane's wrapped around your neck 
 Lookin' rich, baow, you fucked up now 
 See my gun, nigga? This baby got stuffed uptown 
 Shouted out, made a whole safe with the pump root pounds 
 My buddy, keep my gun, right next to my tummy 
 Ask the click, yo, they spit metal lungies 
 Detach wigs, kill flunkies off contact, sonsee 
 Didn't mommy tell y'all niggas to wear clean undies? 
 See why'all should of listened to her 
 She knew her son had a big mouth, and some day death would occur 
 Please for Ms. Gale's sake, and her seeds 
 Pass the flurry, ain't fuckin' around, they knocked to her weave 
 Uh-oh (word up) 
 This still (what you talkin' bout, baby?) 
 Real kids spit that shit 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, yo, yeah 
 Me and Starks clear projects parks 
 With our '93 shit, army coat green and light tan Clarks 
 Niggas think I'm lucky, bitches want to fuck me 
 And put me in the tub with them like I'm a rubber ducky 
 I got a revolver in the pump about the size of Chucky 
 I remember faces easy as I tie my laces 
 Here, put the metal in your mouth, like you was rockin' braces 
 I spit an iron lungie, yeah, I'm old school like the Iron Monkey 
 My shit powerful enough to lift a fuckin' donkey 
 I got heavy chrome, niggas don't care if you live to die 
 They happier than Marbury home 
 Y'all niggas better kill me, my street niggas feel me 
 Louch gotta eat, ends gotta meet 
 The hard shit you kickin' bout is on beat as Tweet 
 This is Theodore, D-Block, the year adore 
 It's son who fall, with the four-four, niggaz like 
 Yeah, nigga this is Ghost with Ghostface 
 I don't sell millions but I get millions from the V's who smoke base 
 Somebody leavin' out with a poked face 
 Tone, you burnin' to kick his teeth out, and swear don't catch no case 
 I'm a make you look like you smoke taste, and we don't leave no trace 
 These rap niggas swear that they so safe 
 I don't want to talk to you holmes, I don't communicate 
 My guns they in my hand, one in my palm 
 And I could dial your number, like a smile off the face 
 With the H.K. 9, I'm the all black hummer 
 Metal lungies'll spit the grungiest shit 
 Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip 
 Tell them rap niggas to suck my dick, fuck the industry 
 And shift, shut down the store, bust my shit 
 I got some hustlin' ass niggas that'll pump my bricks 
 And some dust head niggas that'll dump my clips, what?
