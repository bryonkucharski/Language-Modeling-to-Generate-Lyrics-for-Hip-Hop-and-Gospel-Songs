 Yo, somewhere in (brooklyn) is where you'll find this nigga, in my comfort zone 
 Semi circled by the grimiest niggas (c'mon!) 
 Walk with me, spread chalk with me sod 
 In the field where the real niggas are born (ghetto) 
 There's no surgeons here, we don't cut up body parts 
 We blast and leave yo' ass wherever it start 
 A half a block from the precinct, the homies are beyond thuggin' and buggin 
 My whole borough's in judgment indecent 
 The thoroughest dimepieces straight out of action flicks 
 (Gangsta bitch!) angela jolie this 
 Notion, forward motion, do what you gotta do 
 To get what you gotta get to get your shit rollin' 
 And keep closin, by any means 
 The 50 cal the 40 or the 30 carbine 
 Let it steam motherfucker let's go, we in them greends 
 And on the grounds with it we down with it, that's how we bling
