New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam 
 Actavist pouring up lean 
 Got Flacko, yeah Rocky, he pass me the bean 
 I shoot like a king 
 All of these knots on my jeans, Alexander of McQueen 
 Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike 
 Stack up my cash I got height, take advantage of the Sprite 
 Take the bando bring the hype 
 We just go hard in the kitchen 
 Had a catch up with my bitches 
 They know that young nigga be living 
 Run it up, run it up, run it up 
 New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa 
 Run it up, run it up, run it up 
 I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say 
 Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play 
 New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa 
 I roll up an L in the lobby 
 My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy 
 From H to the E double hockey sticks 
 Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch 
 Let's see who next on my homi' list 
 Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative 
 Shit on them, that's on my potty list 
 Accused of being boujee by a snobby bitch 
 Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas 
 She say I'm special, that's obvious 
 Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part 
 "I rap," when they ask what my hobby is 
 Run it up, not one of them 
 Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up 
 Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus 
 It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush 
 Run it up, run it up, run it up 
 New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa 
 Run it up, run it up, run it up 
 I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say 
 Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play 
 New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
