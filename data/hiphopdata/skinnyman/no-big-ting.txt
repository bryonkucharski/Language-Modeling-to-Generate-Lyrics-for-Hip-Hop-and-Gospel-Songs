I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin' to be no big thing) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life blud) 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (no role models up in here, what?) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice 
 Blud I'm not sayin' that I'm anything, who am I to give man advice? 
 It's not that I know best, when trust blud I don't 
 All I know is if your comin' from this manor I'm from 
 You'll find nuff man'll test ya don't think they won't 
 Everybody is on their own little hustle just to find a way to try get through 
 When your raised in this fuckry 
 And if your makin' some papes on these estates man'll try and get you 
 So you run and grab your bucky 
 You count your blessins everyday but still accept you'll have to take your loses 
 It's money that your makin' 
 Especially if your comin' up in the ranks 
 Against the big crime bosses that are all sittin' hatin' 
 The jealous ones'll always envy so you dare say it now who wants it 
 Let them fuckers spite ya 
 They're out to get you so you get them first 
 And look now uve done it cause your arrived in a lifer 
 Stop 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (man ain't tryin' to be nothing big blud) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice (I can't really tell you how to live your life, get me) 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (nuttin big star) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice 
 I'm from a manor where the last 20yrs have been infested 
 By the crack-cocaine, that you'll find man endeavourin 
 To come down from the ? man are shovin needles in their vein 
 With juice full up of heroin 
 We are all stuck in this struggle but it's not as if we can't see 
 That nuff man's out there shottin work 
 They use it for an escape as if its really gonna set man free 
 When we are still diggin in the dirt 
 The schools are underacheivin in the grades so its minimum wage 
 By the time you go to look a job 
 But on the streets we are learnin every other aspect of the criminal trade 
 So instead we gonna look to rob 
 It's like a gamble for your life on this manor so you hope that you win 
 Or else you'll just be runnin' shook 
 And I can't tell you how to live any better I ain't no big ting 
 Trust me listen to the hook 
 Look 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin' to be no big thing) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life at all) 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing (I ain't tryin' to be no biggie blud) 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice 
 So what's the method for the madness 
 For any of these kids who get left out on these streets 
 Where you find ev'rybody's frettin 
 And walkin' round with screw faces thinkin' that 
 Pure bad beefs is all their likely plan to getting 
 Don't let anybody get in your way 
 From tryin' to chase your dreams blud, whatever they might be 
 You've got to go for whatever you wanna be no matta 
 If that might seem however unlikely 
 If you don't go make a start for the betta then your shit won't change 
 And you'll just get left behind 
 And end up like so many brothers who still out here 
 Goin' insane feelin' like they've lost their mind 
 So get lost in the dust if your not goin' to make your start 
 Instead of just sittin' and wishin 
 Nobodys getting any younger so you know 
 You 'av to play your part 
 If you wanna betta your position 
 Listen 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice 
 I'm not tryin' to be, no big thing, no no 
 I'm not tryin' to give you, no advice
