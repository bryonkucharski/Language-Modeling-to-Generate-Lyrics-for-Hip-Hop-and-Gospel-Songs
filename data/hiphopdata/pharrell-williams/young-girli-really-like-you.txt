(You know) 
 (You know listen to me) 
 Mama help I fell in love with a young girl 
 (That's true, so true) 
 (You're the only girl I love too) 
 My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world 
 (So true, so true, listen) 
 I wasn't tryin' to lead her on 
 See I didn't wanna be alone 
 But when she smiles she brought me home 
 So I brought her home, 
 It's not that the feelin' of love is gone 
 Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown 
 I can't give a fuck what so and so says 
 Crushes hurt both ways 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Young girl, so in love with you 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Young 
 Young girl, so in love with you 
 The single girls are out tonight 
 But you have one word, my heart, one life 
 And I'm not lookin' around 
 So why you lookin' down? 
 (What you lookin' down for?) 
 I fucked up a long time ago 
 See I should have never let you know 
 See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say 
 (As the People magazine) 
 And crushes hurt both ways 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Young girl, so in love with you 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (HOV!) 
 My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (HOV!) 
 Young girl, so in love with you (HOV!) 
 (Jay-Z) 
 HOV got a young girl 
 HOV got a young girl 
 Still not quite 21 
 So high strung 
 Such a vibrant thing 
 I introduce myself, hi Ms. Thing 
 You're 19? 
 No, you're lighting in a bottle, I give you a ring tomorrow 
 The scene that follows 
 Screens of horror 
 Classic Steven King novel 
 Mamma don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance 
 You should just wait 
 Papa don't preach 
 HOV don't bite 
 Hopin' through it I might mo' your life 
 'Cause imma show you right 
 Proper etiquette how to hold your knife 
 Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice 
 Be like Janet, take control of your life 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 (Young girl) 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (young girl) 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 (Young girl) 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 (Young girl) 
 Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 (Too young, I'm never top young) 
 Young girl, so in love with you 
 ('Cause I'm never too young) 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 (Too young, I'm never too young) 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 ('Cause I'm never too young) 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 (Too young, I'm never too young) 
 Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 ('Cause I'm never too young!) 
 My heart was soakin' and I broken in a young world! 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? 
 Young girl, so in love with you 
 (This is where the story begins baby)
