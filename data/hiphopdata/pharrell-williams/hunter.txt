Just because it's the middle of night 
 That don't mean I won't hunt you down 
 'Cause something deep inside 
 is pulling me and I want you now 
 You and I should be getting it right 
 Ain't no sense in you roaming around 
 If I can't have you nobody can 
 This an animal speaking that'll hunt you down 
 So baby (woo-hoo) 
 My love is calling (woo-hoo) 
 Hey baby (woo-hoo)

 I am showing my teeth 
 And I hope you know that look in my eye (hey!) 
 I've got lightning speed 
 I won't hesitate to rescue what is mine (hey!) 
 Well hold up baby what's going on? 
 Tell the truth, I wanna know!

 Something say you ain't alone! 
 You say, "baby keep holding on"

 I ain't never smelt this before 
 Something say it's time to go!
