Yo, uh, huh, yes sir 
 Turn everything up some more 
 The drums you know, the music and shit 
 (Holla back) 
 I'm goin' for it now 
 (Holla back) 
 Yes sir 
 (Holla back) 
 Hey, yo 
 In the heart of a re-up, it's somthin' like a G up 
 MCA fingering that B up or that C up 
 Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin' beat up 
 And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup 
 He opened up his jacket 
 I opened up my packet 
 He pulled out his money 
 I'm pullin' out that honey 
 He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me 
 Yellow teeth chaffed lips and his nose is runny 
 He lit that shit, he hit that quick as if I was high 
 I asked him where them bricks at shit 
 He smiled as if he was payin' homage 
 He said in the back of the apartment 
 Where they be selling ganja 
 But beware of the AK held by HM Thomas 
 Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pyjamas 
 I said shit ma nigga take another hit 
 We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs 
 Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids 
 Did I get that work, what you think? Yes I did 
 I didn't actually that wasn't true and 
 If you aspire to hustle, that's a how to, to you 
 This that shit make you wanna hustle 
 Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles 
 Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles 
 So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles 
 We gonna show you how to hustle 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Ya follow that) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Well, follow this) 
 It's incredible how I etch my plans out 
 To be physically subtle and financially stand out 
 You should see me stick that big S on my anso 
 And literally call destructure so no one can touch ya 
 Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya 
 Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover 
 So much money that the lid threatens eruption and 
 The bank says you don't have to call like you're Usher 
 And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody 
 But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates 
 Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me 
 When them fiends hit that shit they kicked just like karate 
 We named one Bruce lie, one slim Kelly 
 Who issued too much quicker than Luis rank and M belly 
 Yeah, I escaped but there's nothing you can tell me 
 'Cause thought I paper chase, my memories won't fail me 
 This that shit make you wanna hustle 
 Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles 
 Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles 
 So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles 
 We gonna show you how to hustle 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Ya follow that) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Well, follow this) 
 In the hood, wake up to the hammer noise 
 Sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys 
 Pull up and them eyes wide open, stack of toys 
 If your girl want to leave with us that's her choice 
 The feelin' throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomanal 
 Nigga signed a million dollar cheque with his pyjamas on 
 Film it like a porno no need to re-word it 
 Nigga the enzo just came and I ain't have to jerk it 
 Yeah, niggas you heard it the perversion of stars 
 I guess if I go in my garage, it'd be a menage 
 Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84 
 When we high off potato chips 
 New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors 
 Yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on my reefa 
 Rewire my brain, aspire to attain, tell Jacob 
 Light on the platinum, keep the fire in the chain 
 Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam 
 I guess if my ice is fire, it leave you niggas stinged 
 See there's you there's me and there's between 
 If you remove the between, you see I achievin' you dreams 
 This that shit make you wanna hustle 
 Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles 
 Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles 
 So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles 
 We gonna show you how to hustle 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Holla back) 
 So you can style all these sneakers 
 (Ya follow that) 
 So you can style all these sneakers
