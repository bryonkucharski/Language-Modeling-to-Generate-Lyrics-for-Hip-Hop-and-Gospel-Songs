My heart is filled, with love and care 
 Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there 
 The answer's simple 
 You lift me up 
 The view up here, I see all the stars 
 There go Venus, and there go Mars 
 Somethin' you been through 
 You're from above 
 When I first saw you, I got excited 
 Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it 
 But I didn't know 
 I didn't let go 
 Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it 
 Just like a kite, you learn to ride it 
 But I didn't know 
 You're s'posed to let it go 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You head me off sometimes 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You push me back every once in a while 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You remind me there's someone up there 
 Who ushers in 
 The air I need to power my sail 
 When I open the window 
 I wanna hug you 
 Cause you remind me of the air 
 I said yeah 
 Cause when I'm feelin' real low 
 I remember I love you 
 I put my hands in the air 
 And you were there 
 With your love, I can board the skies 
 Running away that electrifies mothership other 
 Can I stow away? 
 Colourful winds of the northern sky 
 Is the closest thing, and here is why 
 Cause we're color 
 You blow me away (blow me away girl) 
 I need it like I breathe it 
 Music and colors can make one hover 
 Who cares if they don't see you? 
 Don't you know that they're the same? 
 I need it like I breathe it 
 If you never discover, forever you'll suffer 
 Who cares if they don't see you? 
 You got until then to learn the way 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You head me off sometimes 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You push me back every once in a while 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You remind me there's someone up there 
 Who ushers in 
 The air I need to power my sail 
 When I open the window 
 I wanna hug you 
 Cause you remind me of the air 
 I said yeah 
 Cause when I'm feelin' real low 
 I remember I love you 
 I put my hands in the air 
 And you were there 
 When I first saw you, I got excited 
 Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it 
 But I didn't know 
 I didn't let go 
 Then I realize I'm trying to fight it 
 Just surrender, learn to ride it 
 But I didn't know 
 Oh had to let it go 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You head me off sometimes 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You push me back every once in a while 
 Like a gust of wind 
 You remind me there's someone up there 
 Who ushers in 
 The air I need to power my sail 
 When I open the window 
 I wanna hug you 
 Cause you remind me of the air 
 I said yeah 
 Cause when I'm feelin' real low 
 I remember I love you 
 I put my hands in the air 
 And you were there
