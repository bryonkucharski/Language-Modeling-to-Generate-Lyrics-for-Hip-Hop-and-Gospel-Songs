(Pharrell:) 
 We do this in our sleep ... 
 Yes sir 
 (Snoop Dogg:) 
 You ever been in love before? 
 Let me holla at you mann 
 You know it's hard for a playa to admit that sometimes 
 But I'm a spit that sumtimes 
 You know wat I'm sayin' 
 Ay p, give it to 'em one time, nephew 
 (Pharrell and Charlie:) 
 There's sumthin bout this girl 
 From around my way 
 Ever try to hold back your feelings, 
 But it just wouldn't stay? 
 But when I finally found the words to say 
 I wanted to run away 
 Simply run away 
 (Pharrell:) 
 You can try to run and hide 
 It wont make a difference 
 You can lie to urself 
 Of the reason 
 Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
 That you're in love with the girl 
 Yessir, that's her 
 But it wasn't like that back wen I met her 
 The lavish life from all the do? spun 
 Before the double R had the hitchhike thumb 
 Her friends didn't like niggas like us but i 
 Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed 
 Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up 
 But there's more to it 
 I remember once 
 Sayin' let's shit on the peons 
 Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion 
 Make 'em say 'wat we on?? 
 You say no like you was doin' it for eons 
 Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
 Wen it rains it pours 
 I laughs to myself wen I change the score 
 You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more 
 And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
 I guess he played games 
 There's only diamond dice here 
 Not tryin' ta justify 
 But wen ya shut ya eye you can touch the sky 
 You in trouble ma 
 And you should pray about speed 
 But if this 'bout you 
 Wat that say about me? 
 (Pharrell and Charlie:) 
 But when I finally found the words to say

 (Pharrell:) 
 U can try to run and hide 
 It wont make a difference 
 U can lie to urself 
 Of the reason 
 Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
 That ur in love with the girl 
 (Snoop Dogg:) 
 See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks 
 And I does wat I does 
 Yeah I might say 'cause? 
 It's really weird 'cause a nigga got love 
 Snop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a what?? 
 She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug 
 Now it is wat it is and it was how it was 
 I'm hollin lil mama like wat 
 Money mo stacked tryin' ta get my g's back 
 All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser 
 Laid back while we sippin on a breeza 
 Fresh 4-pack sittin' in the freeza 
 Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
 She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
 Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!? 
 It's been a lil min since I seen her 
 Hope her man don't run up 'cause ill have to pull the neena
