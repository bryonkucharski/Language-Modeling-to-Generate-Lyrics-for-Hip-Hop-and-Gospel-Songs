Mamacita, oh my God I think you're on fire 
 Do you want me to get you water? 
 You make me want to be your baby father 
 Cause the dance you do is getting hotter 
 I better come for you before the boys follow 
 What you think? 
 I think you wanna... 
 I think you wanna... 
 She wanna break it down 
 She want some reggaeton 
 I been long overdue, something overdone 
 You been on the tuss, well I can make you overcome 
 I know he tellin' you what he can make you and 
 I know he tellin' you where he can take you and 
 By the way ma, hey is that your hair? 
 If it ain't, it took two days in the hairshop chair 
 I'm just jokin... 
 I make ya smile right? 
 Come in, I mean excuse me, baby 
 You dance so fast, ma, this ain't merente 
 But your butt is certain yo palente 
 Sh, I'm just bein honest 'cause it's just nice 
 You're lookin' different, sayin' to yourself 
 "Is he all right?" 
 Sure you're cute, but you know you won't dismiss this plight? 
 When my chain keep blinkin like Christmas lights 
 Get it right... 
 Mamacita, oh my God I think you're on fire 
 Do you want me to get you water? 
 You make me want to be your baby father 
 Cause the dance you do is getting hotter 
 I better come for you before the boys follow 
 What you think?

 Hey girl! 
 Let's go finish at mi casa 
 Trust me, it'd be proper 
 I got muchos negros on my lache with the choppers 
 If they suspect us, someone trespasa 
 All you hear is BRRRAT and then scream, Kukaracha! 
 Trust me, P is no pimp 
 See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp 
 One night with he, and I'll make ya scream 
 You'll wake up, like it's a dream 
 Call downstairs, tell 'em to make us PJs 
 Right after that, dry cycle our PJS 
 Right after that, book us a PJ 
 What you mean how? When you got money, it's easy 
 This ain't dookie, ma, I'm not Green Day 
 Wake up, you're about to miss your damn dream day 
 Now everybody just sing what the screen say 
 It goes...
