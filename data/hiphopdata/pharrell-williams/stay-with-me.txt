Flush flush. 
 Turn me up some more. 
 (Verse 1: Pharrell) 
 You're that girl 
 Who thinks the world 
 Is somethin' beautiful 
 And that's all baby 
 But your lookin' for a brawn 
 With shed upon the wrong star 
 Cause it don't know 
 That's not how it goes 
 So, I can't explain, why things are made the same and others change 
 He made it that way 
 But the perplexities of world 
 Leaves more oysters and pearls 
 And I don't know 
 It's just the way it goes 
 But I know you can 
 Stay with me 
 Lock the door 
 Take the key 
 Hide yours 
 Feel the bate 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hey! 
 (Verse 2: Pharrell) 
 Don't take the time 
 To relax your mind 
 So unusual 
 Oh baby 
 But your priorities are disheveled 
 But your emotions and your health just don't go 
 Your body says no, So... 
 I can't concieve 
 That leaves will grow on trees in loweth degrees 
 And comeback next spring 
 But the perplexities of life 
 Brings more days that bore new skies 
 So who's to know, possible that you could 
 Stay with me 
 Lock the door 
 Take the key 
 Hide yours 
 Feel the bate 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hey! 
 (Verse 3: Pharrell) 
 Up, up and away 
 I be the wind that blows yourself 
 The pixie does a Tinker Bell 
 Up, up and away 
 I be the wind beneath your wings 
 Living color comes with you 
 (Pusha T Verse) 
 Baby let's it pour it up 
 Let them galardo doors up 
 Pat eve for them Louis as soon as the tours up 
 The million dollar frame is his and her the same 
 I took it on the chin when I heard about the lane 
 I ain't here to try to rewrite your past 
 That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed 
 When considering love you take the Good with the bad 
 I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had 
 Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad 
 Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags 
 Reverse it I want perfect 
 That was half the reason I bought half them purses 
 That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface, 
 She ain't have to rehearse, My baby's real 
 That's why I put the chill on her 
 So good make a... wanna kneel on her, not yet 
 Stay with me 
 Lock the door 
 Take the key 
 Hide yours 
 Feel the bate 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hear the choice 
 Hey.
