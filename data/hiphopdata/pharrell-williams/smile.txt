I wish I could tell you how I feel 
 It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried 
 Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin' 
 Just close my eyes, and I stand there 
 And I smile 
 Smile 
 I smile, for you 
 Never give up on the things that, that can make you smile 
 Even if it means you gotta crawl for a thousand miles 
 Don't you worry, about how far to go 
 Enjoy the journey, and you know who you know you know 
 (Cheers, cheers) 'Cause the moment they underestimate me, I win 
 (Cheers, cheers) To you, good life's success, good sex, and kids 
 (Cheers, cheers) What I got for you, they can't contain with lids 
 (Cheers, cheers) When I look into your eyes and see our kids 
 I wish I could tell you how I feel 
 It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried 
 Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin' 
 Just close my eyes, and I stand there 
 And I smile 
 Smile 
 I smile, for you 
 Your known life is full of pressure, but don't you break 
 Just know a smile is a curve that sets everything straight 
 So don't you hurry, take your time, I have no fear 
 'Cause fear stands for, false evidence of appearin' real 
 (Cheers, cheers) 'Cause the moment they underestimate me, I win 
 (Cheers, cheers) To you, good life's success, good sex, and kids 
 (Cheers, cheers) What I got for you, they can't contain with lids 
 (Cheers, cheers) When I look into your eyes and see our kids 
 I smile 
 I smile 
 I smile 
 I smile 
 I wish I could tell you how I feel 
 It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried 
 Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin' 
 Just close my eyes, and I stand there 
 And I smile 
 Smile 
 I smile, for you
