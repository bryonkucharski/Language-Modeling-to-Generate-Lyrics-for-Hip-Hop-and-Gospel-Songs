Different 
 Oh yeah 
 This one goes out to all the lovers 
 What can we do? We're helpless romantics 
 We cannot help who we're attracted to 
 So let's all dance and elevate each other 
 Dear diary, it's happenin' again 
 This energy, like I'm 'bout to win 
 I just close my eyes and visions appear 
 She's everything I want and it's crystal clear 
 Not even Marilyn Monroe 
 Who Cleopatra please 
 Not even Joan of Arc 
 That don't mean nothin' to me 
 I just want a different girl 
 Girl, girl, girl, girl 
 Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough 
 Why, why do I have to lie 
 Pretend, make believe or hide? 
 When I love what I've described 
 But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl 
 Dear diary, it's happenin' again 
 This energy, like I'm 'bout to win 
 I just close my eyes and visions appear 
 She's everything I want and it's crystal clear 
 Not even Marilyn Monroe 
 Who Cleopatra please 
 Not even Joan of Arc 
 That don't mean nothin' to me 
 I just want a different girl 
 Girl, girl, girl, girl 
 Girl, girl, girl on girl 
 Girl, girl, girl, girl 
 Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough 
 Dear diary, it's happenin' again 
 This energy, like I'm 'bout to win 
 I just close my eyes and visions appear 
 She's everything I want and it's crystal clear 
 Not even Marilyn Monroe 
 Who Cleopatra please 
 Not even Joan of Arc 
 That don't mean nothin' to me 
 I just want a different girl, oh 
 What's wrong with that? Eh 
 What's wrong with that? 
 What's wrong with that? 
 In honor of the groove and to all who's surrendered to it 
 We say thank you and we take it back 
 We're so hard, we're so hard that it came true 
 Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon 
 I put my arms around her and I promise not to abuse you 
 Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?
