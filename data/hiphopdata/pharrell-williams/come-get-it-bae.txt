 Women, I can do anything you like 
 I can do anything you need 
 And I got a better body

 None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy 
 And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me 
 I know you certainly been gone 
 And it's been much too long 
 And there's some things we need to do 
 So I know you need to get home 
 Come get it bae

 Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too 
 Take it easy on the clutch, 'cause girl I like you 
 I can see it the way you like 
 I can do anything you need 
 I can give you dirty looks 
 Like them niggas that's on TV 
 None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy 
 And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me

 You'll need a sugar fix, baby
