Ladies and gentlemen. 
 Yes sir. 
 Let's do this. 
 Yes sir. 
 Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming, 
 Take 2 of these and call me in the morning 
 You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin' 
 Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado 
 Shit pop your bottles toast to screen cheers! 
 Getcha 2-step 'cause it's the record of the year 
 Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair, 
 Officially announcing that this is warfare 
 'Cause back in the day my clouds was grey 
 And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away 
 But then I sold my first verse that cut the NSX 
 But I was still ridin' in them thin ass jets, 
 But now, 
 Made my business so clear out the window of the leer 
 And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear, 
 Listen clearly now, 
 Hello, can you hear me now? 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that

 So act like your tryin' to get this money right quick, 
 So can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 On and on and this beat is zoning, 
 I control the mind straight over the phone, 
 Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist, 
 They never get addicted unless the haddy wibes the surice... 
 From Louisdales to Jimmy Chaos is real, 
 She knows the time she sees the richard mille, 
 Flat double skeletal tourbillon 
 It's just like her body move it turns her on, 
 She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers, 
 And all our car doors go up like Transformers 
 See I can do it this-a-way I can do it that-a-way 
 From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway 
 So cool like new edition that she hollas your scent, 
 I'll get it okay, let it boil away, 
 But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong, 
 And I got some right for 'em right after this song 
 'Cause my name is Skate-Board-P 
 Ladies and gentlemen,

 On and on and the temperatures warming 
 I spit heat flashes, niggas get nautious, 
 Bright as a bitch 
 So analyze with caution 
 When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit 
 Should I mention the fact the transition is the track? 
 No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at 
 No skateboy P too grown 
 Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone 
 It's so cold you don't wanna feel the chill of it. 
 Uh! 
 Just stand back and just look at the grill of it. 
 Uh! 
 I don't smoke but I bet the... love it! 
 It totally intensifies VIVD ass appeal of it, 
 You could be jealous, and grit your teeth, 
 But all these little niggas got something in reach 
 While on my boat party trying to sunseek, 
 Ladies and gentlemen,
