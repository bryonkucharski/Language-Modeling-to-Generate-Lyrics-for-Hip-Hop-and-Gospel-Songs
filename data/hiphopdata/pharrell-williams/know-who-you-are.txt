I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 Bad day at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse 
 Finger pointin', but they, they depend on you 
 Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal 
 No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress 
 When your environment seems to get brighter 
 You know it's good 
 And the situation doesn't seem that bad 
 You know it's good 
 Can you imagine this started with a lighter? 
 You know it's good 
 Perception that you never had 
 You know it's good, yeah 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 I want every woman to make a pledge with me 
 Say your name, I pledge to live life on the edge 
 Want you to know, I see, the power is in me 
 No more acquiesce, standin' up, with no stress 
 I will do, what I need, till every woman on the earth is free 
 When your environment seems to get brighter 
 You know it's good 
 And the situation doesn't seem that bad 
 You know it's good 
 And you imagine this started with a lighter 
 You know it's good 
 Perception that you never had 
 You know it's good, yeah 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 (feelin') 
 oh yeah 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin', let me tell you one more time 
 Let me tell you all one time, 'cause I don't mind 
 I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin' 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind 
 And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time 
 We just shake our heads and dance, the moment so surreal 
 Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels 
 Yeah 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin', what you're feelin' yeah 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin', yes I know what you're feelin' 
 Let me tell you one more time 
 And I don't mind 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 I know who you are 
 And I know what you're feelin' 
 Yes I do
