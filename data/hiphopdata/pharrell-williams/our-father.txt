Our Father, Which art in heaven 
 I'm so grateful 
 Of all the beautiful things 
 That you are allowing me to see 
 Birds, Bees 
 The ability to do what I do 
 The opportunities 
 I know you love me now 
 And I think it's time 
 And my duty, to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you, oh) 
 ... Don't let me fall 
 You watch for who I'm friends with 
 I got tattoos, you forgive me 
 You know I'm so sensitve 
 You know I'm chased by women 
 You know mt mind is drivin' 
 To you my heart is givin'...oowww 
 You're the greatest 
 You're the greatest (wow wow) 
 You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you) 
 Your're the greatest 
 Don't let me fall 
 They don't understand 
 What you do for me (do foe me) 
 And nothing by my actions 
 They don't I believe (I believe) 
 Not talking 'bout what I wear 
 When I drivin' where I sleep 
 I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep 
 Thank you for my brothers 
 Thank you for my daddy (daddy)
