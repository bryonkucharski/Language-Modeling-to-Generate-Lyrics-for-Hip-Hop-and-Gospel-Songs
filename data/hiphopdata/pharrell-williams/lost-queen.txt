What planet are you from, girl? 
 And are there others like you there? 
 And could you do that magic trick again? 
 Poppin' up from nowhere 
 Though my planet's full of warfare 
 You make it feel like a dream 
 Man I hope they never find you 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Hot sex and gold, shiny things 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Remind you that you are a lost queen 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 I don't have a problem with multi-taskin' 
 Takin' care of you is my number one passion 
 Put it before my eyes, you know I'mma smash it 
 Only if you want it, want it 
 You don't have to ever think about askin' 
 I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it 
 Can I start you up? It's automatic 
 Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom 
 I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty 
 Ain't gotta ask me to 
 Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty 
 Ain't gotta ask me to 
 What planet are you from, girl? 
 And are there others like you there? 
 And could you do that magic trick again? 
 Poppin' up from nowhere 
 Though my planet's full of warfare 
 You make it feel like a dream 
 Man I hope they never find you 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Hot sex and gold, shiny things 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Remind you that you are a lost queen 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 I don't have a problem meeting mama and daddy 
 Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy 
 Half of me is good, the other half nasty 
 Can't help it if I want it, want it 
 Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior 
 Talk about relationships, I used to be a player 
 And like Geico, the time I saved 'em 
 Can get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom 
 Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown 
 Ain't gotta ask me to 
 And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it 
 Ain't gotta ask me to 
 What planet are you from, girl? 
 And are there others like you there? 
 And could you do that magic trick again? 
 Poppin' up from nowhere 
 Though my planet's full of warfare 
 You make it feel like a dream 
 Man I hope they never find you 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Hot sex and gold, shiny things 
 I think you are a lost queen 
 Let me serve you, serve you 
 Remind you that you are a lost queen 
 I think you are a lost queen
