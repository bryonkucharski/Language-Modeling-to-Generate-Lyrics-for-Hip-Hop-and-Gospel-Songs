The moment when you see that nigga face again 
 Replay it in your mind then your breathing change 
 He's reaching in his jacket, he gone make it rain 
 The bystanders screaming lawwwdd 
 The DJ screaming lawwwdd 
 The AK screaming lawwwdd 
 That's the nigga mama hard 
 Her baby stretched out on the boulevard 
 Niggas trying to shit on me and make history 
 Supposedly I help chicks, help them with groceries 
 Supposedly I still break, gripping my rosary 
 Still shoot ya block up then make you notice me 
 (Lawwwdd) Bullets flyin in the air much 
 Fuckin' gheard the guy hurt, I don't even care much 
 (Lawwwdd) And I'm still smoking bogomill 
 Still have the street meeting, stop one broker deals 
 You my nigga nigga fuck how nigga Oprah feels 
 Papi, I pop guns, they don't pop me 
 Known shooting niggas, but nah, they never shot me 
 Hang hang good bell gang, don't make us pop three 
 Yeah, I hear you talking what year, nigga whatever nigga 
 You did time, me too nigga, whatever nigga 
 Pussy plus dick could only equal to fuck 
 NORE + Pharrell could only equal to what what what what 
 From blood money to love money and thug money 
 Nino what up? Fucking the oldest G's money 
 I've shot niggas in they motherfucking peep holes 
 Winter time, shot niggas in they ski clothes 
 (Lawwwdd) still I stay focused still 
 Catch cases, got cases is open still 
 (Lawwwdd) slime fall or slime out 
 Good bell gang hang hang, nigga ride out 
 Neptune, cocker spaniel, underground? 
 My dick, two can handle two chicks, tu Cumpleanos 
 Italian shit, The Soprano, I attack like a rebel 
 I attack, I attack, counteract, cardiac 
 Shootin' at yo Pontiac, wherever were your army at 
 (Lawwwdd) Mascato with the peach mix 
 (Lawwwdd) I'm just rollin' with some freak chicks 
 (Lawwwdd) here the drinks come spiked, prefixed
