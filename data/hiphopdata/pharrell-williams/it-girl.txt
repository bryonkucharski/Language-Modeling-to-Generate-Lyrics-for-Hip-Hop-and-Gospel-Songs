You the it girl, hey hey 
 My inspiration 
 My compass spinnin', baby 
 It's the right destination 
 Oh, come on, come on 
 Give me what I came for 
 I got treasure to hide 
 So let's keep it from the strangers 
 Your waves, they wash all over me 
 Your tides, they pull me back to sea 
 (back to sea) 
 When you bite on my lip 
 And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass 
 When you kiss on my lips 
 And hold my hand and moan again, I'ma hold that ass 
 You don't know, I've been missin' you 
 Baby when you, go 
 ..only way...
