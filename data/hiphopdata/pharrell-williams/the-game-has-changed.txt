I know, I disappeared and popped up in paris making chairs with a beard 
 And those that love me probably thought that it was weird 
 While the haters was happy, they thought my destiny was cleared 
 And any artist that you love have veered 
 Especially when they hated the image that they mirrored 
 I got a text that said "p, please get up" 
 Some light shining brightly outlining my shit up 
 The penthouses, the homes, the cars, the chains 
 The stones, the admirers, mini-me's and clones 
 Selling you n-ggas dreams that are boxes full of foam 
 In and out of dimensions I walk through walls 
 Just saying you can't put me in a box, that's all 
 No davinci codes and twilight stubs 
 Don't take this wrong, but I'll let you taste the blood 
 So fitting, the sound in my system, makes me want to squish them 
 King kong foot, the beast has awakened 
 The pro tools taping, my position blatant 
 You knew I was coming, choiceless, you waiting 
 Now I look up and ask why you've been for Satan 
 I shall hover for splendid covers 
 That alone makes me other, plus the return of the jedi 
 I study how the brooklyn machine works 
 That's word to big and his dead eye 
 I rise to the top like the sun 
 I rise to the pocket like a gun 
 I fire, drop ya body then it's done 
 They like, what happened, we trapped him 
 Hatred is obliverated when I imagine 
 Look at you drowning in ya lungs, gasping 
 Blood on the dancefloor, he, he michael jackson 
 Bitches should stay home they do so much cummin' 
 Y'all should stand backwards you do so much frontin' 
 Take this sun block we got too much sunning 
 Now lets examine what you thinking, running 
 Run too hard, you might tear ya meniscus 
 And if you try to run up you only get ya wig split 
 And this campaign that we runnning is viscious 
 I hate to eat and run but this was delicious
