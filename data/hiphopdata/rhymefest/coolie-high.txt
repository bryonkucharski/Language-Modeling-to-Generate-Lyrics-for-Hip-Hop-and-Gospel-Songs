 You need to come inside and check Lo 
 Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow 
 Coolie got you wide 
 You need to come inside and check Lo 
 Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow 
 Verse One:

 With the buddahs and rugars 
 And shot cruisers and rovers 
 Diamond crooks... takin' it over 
 With razors and cutters

 We live for Coolie High treasures 
 And... 
 Check the queen bee Lady Ree diggin Grace 
 Check the place 3 o clock shat no we ain't

 Blasts of dynamite sing my superfly to the... 
 Cleopatra in the casino with gold sugar 
 Dig my harlequinn 
 And drench you with my diner garments 
 From Beva to Bevro in the Montaro slidin to Dero 
 With bottles of Asti Spumanti to tranquilize my heaven 
 Count seven we gettin' explicit shootin sugar to the shorties 
 Luchini to spare let me see you 
 Its losin the air

 Coolie High got you wide

 On the night vision decision underneath the silver moon 
 Boy from company see A day sugar love 
 Chief be for stonin

 The safety's off the toaster 
 And my shadow's by the moonlight 
 'Cause Data's on the levels and the Lo is on the EQ 
 My stamina is sugar 
 And its love love forever y'all
