 Rap rap is like a set up 
 A lot of games 
 A lot of suckas with colorful names 
 Rap is like a set up 
 A lot of games 
 A lot of suckas with colorful names 
 Rappers bein set up 
 Yup yup a set up 
 No more Tupac telling bitches to keep their head up 
 A whole lot of hipsters 
 Internets, and kids now 
 Took the Mario mushroom 
 Oh, you big now? 
 Well, let me show you bout things 
 Take the Red Bull 
 So I can rip off ya wings 
 I make 'em promise now 
 To never wear tight jeans 
 I ain't a skater 
 So I never rock ice cream 
 And I ain't dissin Pharrell 
 But be for real 
 Some of y'all is gay as hell! 
 I'm Hell Boy, lil boy 
 You like Elroy 
 I'm more like T'Challa on steroids 
 That's Black Panther 
 Arm and Hammer 
 You miss your biggest moment 
 Like Obama's grandma 
 Rhymefest 
 I'm armed with grammar 
 You'll get arrested 
 Fuck reading mirandas 
 I'm from 
 Chicago 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch Chicago 
 Sta-sta-sta-sta stand up! 
 Rap rap is like a set up 
 A lot of games 
 A lot of suckas with colorful names 
 Rap is like a set up 
 Yup yup a game 
 Get around Kanye 
 And try to degrade my name 
 That's insane 
 You hatin' the gang 
 Clown those lames 
 Nothin' but a shit stain 
 I'm Rhymefest 
 You can feel my reign 
 Arms out to here 
 Here feel my range 
 We from 
 The slum 
 Lord keep me calm 
 The plate I help make 
 Is the one they eat from 
 Coat tail nigga 
 Got the lil room in the hotel nigga 
 They'll always love me 
 'Cause I'm a mo real nigga 
 You the male version of a gold digga 
 Go figure 
 Hoe nigga 
 Wait a minute 
 I ain't done 
 Made about a million dollars 
 Spent it all on my son 
 Took two years off 
 But I still had fun 
 Been all around the world 
 Now I'm back where I'm from 
 Chicago 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch Chicago 
 Sta-sta-sta-sta stand up! 
 Rap rap is like a set up 
 A lot of games 
 A lot of suckas with colorful names 
 I ain't never came out of my face 
 And try to talk sideways 
 And step out of my place 
 Before I ate 
 I always said my grace 
 It was just me in the biz 
 Right now it's the ace 
 But now I'm born to roll 
 Jesus saves Christ 
 I wrote this on a scroll 
 Not that song 
 That song is old 
 My career starts here 
 Here take my soul 
 My heart, my suicide thoughts 
 My religion, my God 
 My money in the vault 
 Got my momma shaking her head 
 Like this her fault 
 I ain't sorry that I did it 
 I'm sorry I got caught! 
 You don't wanna get lost 
 In the city where I'm from 
 It's plenty of white chalk in... 
 Chicago! chicago! 
 Chicago! chicago!
