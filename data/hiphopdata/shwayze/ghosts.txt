(Austin Paul) 
 Do you believe in ghosts? 
 Do you believe in fantasy? 
 Can you take another dose? 
 Step away from reality 
 You're my beautiful, the most 
 Mystery to all but me 
 'Cause I believe in ghosts 
 I believe in fantasy 
 (Shwayze) 
 I start lady, chillin' with my family 
 As I do with dime and I wake up to a xanny 
 The jeans fit skinny, style fresh like many 
 I met her in LA then I hit that in Miami 
 Kicking games to my sons nanny 
 She got the booty, brought an ounce and some pirate's booty 
 In my tumi, mile high in my ray bans is this a movie 
 Either way when the plane lands, Imma do me 
 Eyes god lady, I'm stuntin like a ghost 
 Hearts black out when you see you should know 
 From the chicks on the beach to the G's selling dope 
 I do it for my coast, I do it for my folks 
 Eyes got lady, baby senorita 
 Black hearts, black sand sippin on the margarita 
 I do it for my folks, I do it for my cost 
 I do it cause, I do it 'cause I'm dope
