(Shwayze) 
 Shway. Let's go! 
 (Shwayze) 
 Uh! You're a fairy tale 
 I wanna get to know you very well 
 The club is packed and the music's bumping 
 So it's kinda hard for me to tell you something 
 Your legs are long like a limousine 
 My life's a movie you my favorite scene 
 I'm directing, I ain't gonna say cut 
 You so sexy how you move your butt 
 Oh! So you know my ex and coincidentally she from Texas 
 I'm kissing your neck with no regrets 
 But it's like an interview with these 20 questions 
 What's my age ? What's my sign? 
 I wanna take you out the back through the exit sign 
 We ain't gotta rush, we can take our time 
 I just want you to be mine (Let's go) 
 (Marco) 
 Where do you go ? I know you're feeling alone 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Just let it all go, and lose all control 
 And I'm hoping you can see the light 
 Wanna take away the problems that you came with 
 I'm a show you how to look the other way when 
 You're up in the zone, and there's nobody home 
 Better close your eyes and realize 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 And I'm hoping you can see the light 
 (Shwayze) 
 Oh you're girlfriend like me ? Ya she's real cute 
 But she ain't my style 'cause she just ain't you 
 There ain't too much that us two can't do 
 You're a piece of art, let me finger paint you 
 I'm a gemini so I'll double date you 
 Mke you laugh, and I'll make you think too 
 Buy you clothes, I ain't trying to change you 
 Strike a pose I wish I could frame you 
 Uh! Staring up at the city lights 
 I wanna hide behind your eyes pretty lights 
 I can tell you them many lies 
 You ain't tripping off drama and petty lies 
 Free falling like a pretty song 
 We can take another shot but I'm already gone 
 You a star shining bright like the sun right 
 'Cause I finally see the light 
 (Marco) 
 Where do you go ? I know you're feeling alone 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Just let it all go, and lose all control 
 And I'm hoping you can see the light 
 Wanna take away the problems that you came with 
 I'm a show you how to look the other way when 
 You're up in the zone, and there's nobody home 
 Better close your eyes and realize 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 And I'm hoping you can see the light 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 And I'm hoping you can see the light 
 (Marco) 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 Can I get you next to me tonight? 
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh... 
 I'm hoping you can see the light
