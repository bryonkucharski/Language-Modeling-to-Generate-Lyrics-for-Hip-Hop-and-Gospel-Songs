Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint. 
 I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point. 
 Must have been a lie. 
 That's what my mother said. 
 Every now and hten there's going to be daze like this. 
 If good guys finish last then I'm bad. I'm trying to take you to the pad. 
 Black James Dean on a moped. 
 No cigerettes nah 
 I got the big bam booze with the weed instead 
 And I always got a helmet on my head. 
 Bad girls go fast slow up and crash. 
 Baby on top like a ball of hash. 
 Nino don't stop till he gets the ass. 
 Half full but not half bad. 
 And I really don't want to make you sad girl. 
 But I gotta be on my way.

 Oh yeah daze like this. 
 I'm in a daze like this 
 Daze like this. 
 Momma said there'd be daze like this. 
 Momma said there'd be daze like this. 
 It's 8pm two girls pull up in a grey BMW 
 Like Shwayze we in love with you. 
 They said we got your CD for Christmas. 
 Do you wanna have a threesome with us? 
 It could be a dream but I don't want it to end. 
 Opened up the back door and I hopped in. 
 Women and weed over bitches and guns. 
 I ain't from the hood.

 Pulled up to the club with no cash 
 Like I'm doing cannonballs with no splash. 
 But I pulled a ten 
 And I'll do it again 
 I dunno it might be the mustache. 
 And you never gonna know if you must ask 
 But my new CD is a must have. 
 I'm about the quality not the price tag. 
 Better have a nice brain with that nice ass.
