 You gotta meet my new girlfriend 
 There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 (Shwayze) 
 Yo, she's at it again like Marilyn 
 Out of control like Anna Nicole 
 Stuck on her love like heroin 
 My baby's hot, my baby's cold 
 Life is a game, must stop and go 
 Vanilla sky to my rocky road 
 She said, "This ain't the life I chose." 
 But she my little miss rock 'n' roll 
 (Shwayze) 
 Hot tan lines in the summer 
 Rock fe berg in the center 
 Move your waist line to the bass line 
 Groove, 'cause I don't wanna waste time 
 I think I like her, I think I really do 
 'Cause I keep running back to you, to you 
 (Paul Couture) 
 There she goes, walking down the street 
 To the march of her own drum, can you feel the beat? 
 There she goes, the kind of girl for me, she's gotta be

 You gotta meet my new girlfriend 
 There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 (Shwayze) 
 She's Mary Kate, she's Ashley 
 She don't care that I'm ashy 
 She's hella cool there by the pool 
 Dropped out of school, but she classy 
 I know she ain't no shady chick 
 I even like her crazy ticks 
 She's fucked around with baby dicks 
 But now she on that Shwayze shit 
 (Shwayze) 
 Hot tan lines in the summer 
 Rock fe berg in the center 
 Move your waist line to the bass line 
 Groove, 'cause I don't wanna waste time 
 I think I like her, I think I really do 
 'Cause I keep running back to you, to you

 You gotta meet my new girlfriend 
 There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend 
 There's nothin' like, there's nothin' like my new girlfriend. I kinda like ya, there's nothin' like my new girlfriend
