(Shwayze) 
 And, I don't wanna lie no more 
 Don't wanna see you cry no more 
 Don't wanna get high no more 
 But it's all I know, all I know, all I know 
 (Shwayze) 
 Now everybody want the Shwayze flow 
 Let me meet your lady, be prepared to let your baby go 
 Beach boy, surf's up with a Jane Doe 
 That mean she fresh to death even in plain clothes 
 She a rich girl, we in a Range Rov' 
 She ain't my girlfriend, she my main, know 
 I put the CD on my back like a Jenks point 
 That's when I told her I'd be back and I hit the A pole 
 This new city is pretty, tonight we gonna party 
 I bet the bar, totally, is already flooded with hotties 
 Left my bag in the lobby, got a tequila and probably 
 Gonna be drunk at the show, my cutie cute, she saw me 
 (Shwayze) 
 And I don't wanna lie no more 
 Don't wanna see you cry no more 
 Don't wanna get high no more 
 But it's all I know, all I know 
 And I can blame it on the alcohol 
 And take another adderall 
 And you're not even mad at all 
 'Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know 
 (Tayyib Ali) 
 All these new place got me seeing hella faces 
 We smoking doobies with Shwayze looking at my life in HD 
 It's crazy how things can change 
 And you probably thought I'd be different but I stayed the same 
 Riding in my lane, looking sippy, ass licking 
 And I just won the bad chick with ash tits and brains mashed 
 Then run into me after a long day, it's how we play, it's how my grind work 
 In my line when you come to Philly 'cause I got work 
 I just hit the town and roam, don't know where Imma go 
 The music makes me feel all lonely on this rocky road 
 Smoke another O, I think I'm better off alone 
 But we just party and get drunk until the morning sun 
 (Shwayze) 
 And I don't wanna lie no more 
 Don't wanna see you cry no more 
 Don't wanna get high no more 
 But it's all I know, all I know 
 And I can blame it on the alcohol 
 And take another adderall 
 And you're not even mad at all 
 'Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know 
 (Shwayze) 
 I know that I love you 
 I know that I care 
 Yeah, I know that I want to 
 But I can't always be there 
 And now every day I'm thinking about 
 What would've been, what could've been 
 What I should've did but I didn't do 
 I say I'm over you but I'm missing you 
 An apology is overdue but this is what I do 
 (Shwayze) 
 And I don't wanna lie no more 
 Don't wanna see you cry no more 
 Don't wanna get high no more 
 But it's all I know, all I know 
 And I can blame it on the alcohol 
 And take another adderall 
 And you're not even mad at all 
 'Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know 
 (Shwayze) 
 I know that I love you, I know that I care 
 I know that I love you, I know that I care 
 I know that I love you, I know that I care 
 I know that I want to but I can't always be there
