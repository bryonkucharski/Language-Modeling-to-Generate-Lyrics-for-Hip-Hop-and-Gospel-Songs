Come, come summertime 
 Love, love hold my hand 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love take a ride with me 
 Sweet little nectarine 
 Sit down next to me 
 Take a load off, Annie 
 I think you're beautiful 
 Do-ah-diddy-diddy-dum-diddy-do 
 When the moon is full, I'll be a wolf 
 Howl at you and growl at you 
 Ladybugs and flowers, too 
 I want to go out with you 
 I'm just a kid, living a dream 
 Slid in the scene like an old pair of jeans 
 You know my name, but you don't know me 
 Wanna go out with me? Show me. 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, hold my hand 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, take a ride with me 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Black smoke billow out the black tinted window 
 In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto 
 She wore blush, it gave me a rush 
 She was a lush, I gave her a touch on the tush 
 I gave her a push on the bed 
 And we smushed our lips together 
 Like blue and yellow, we made a green meadow 
 Chilled together forever, real mellow 
 She fell in love, I had to act, hello 
 I couldn't say goodbye, she was too special 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love hold my hand 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love take a ride with me 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 All my ladies, put your hands in the sky for me babies 
 And say my name, they call me Shwayze 
 Turn it up, turn it up, Play me 
 Turn it up, turn it up 
 Turn it up, turn it up 
 Turn it up, turn it up 
 Black smoke billow out the black tinted window 
 In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto 
 (Turn it up, turn it up 
 Turn it up, turn it up) 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, hold my hand 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, take a ride with me 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, take a ride with me 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Come, come summertime 
 Love, love, take a ride with me 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy 
 Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don 
 Don't be shy
