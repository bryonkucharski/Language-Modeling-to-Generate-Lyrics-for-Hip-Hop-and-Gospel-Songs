Just when I thought I got you, it was the same single moment realized that I lost you 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning 
 Tryna give you all my loving but you ain't really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 She's the life of the party, don't believe in karma 
 Every moment she's living is another that I'm done 
 She the life of the party, wanna take a bump and grind 
 But when she feeling naughty she hits me up every time 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning 
 Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning 
 Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it... 
 You give me that love, and you give me that hate 
 Then I put that smile up on your face 
 The you say you gotta go but you always stay 
 Then we make that love till it's all okay 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it 
 You were calling me sexy, and I really didn't mind 
 But now it's just messy because I'm wasting my time 
 You ain't looking for love, and neither was I 
 But a down ass chick is so hard to find 
 Roll the weed up, baby kick your feet up 
 They gon point and stare 'cause they all wanna be us 
 (It was the same single moment realized that I lost you) 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning 
 Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning 
 Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it... 
 You give me that love, and you give me that hate 
 Then I put that smile up on your face 
 The you say you gotta go but you always stay 
 Then we make that love till it's all okay 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment 
 So I guess that's how I want it 
 I want it, I, I, I want it 
 I want it, I, I, I want it right now 
 I want it, I, I, I want it 
 I want it, I, I, I want it right now 
 I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it right now 
 I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it... 
 That's how I want it, that's how I really want it 
 You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
