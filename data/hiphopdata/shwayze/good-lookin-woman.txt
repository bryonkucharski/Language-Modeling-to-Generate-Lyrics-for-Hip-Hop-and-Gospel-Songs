Good lookin' woman, where did you come from? 
 There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone 
 You don't know what you got till it's gone 
 Let me lay you tonight and twice in the morn' 
 She love when we fight, I write her a song 
 But she hate when I drink and gone too long 
 You always going to think the grass is greener 
 Till you lying in the mud, alone and freezing 
 Shit, I just found love and I let it leave me 
 I'm so fucked up, I can't believe me 
 I'm love drunk and hungover 
 I don't want to get up yet 
 (I don't want to get up yet) 
 We struck like a perfect match 
 But love burnt me like a cigarette 
 Oh no 
 Good lookin' woman, where did you come from? 
 There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone 
 Someone is you, you, you, you 
 Life on the road is a life alone 
 I wish we could make love through the phone 
 They say distance ain't that hard to fight 
 Though all I got is this mic and this marijuana 
 I'd rather get love then returned the love 
 Than never get love I deserved the love 
 I just found love and I let it leave 
 I'm so fucked up I can't believe 
 I'm love drunk and hungover 
 I don't want to get up yet 
 (I don't want to get up yet) 
 We struck like a perfect match 
 But love burnt me like a cigarette 
 Oh no 
 Good lookin' woman, where did you come from? 
 There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone 
 Someone is you, you, you, you 
 And I don't wanna go to sleep (go to sleep) 
 Without you laying next to me (next to me) 
 Don't you wake me from this dream 
 Oh no, girl you too good lookin' 
 Good lookin' woman, where did you come from? 
 There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone 
 Good lookin' woman, where did you come from? 
 There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone 
 Someone is you, you, you, you 
 You, you, you, you
