 If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want 'em? 
 If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt 'em? 
 If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand? 
 Ms. Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted 
 And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me 
 (Shwayze) 
 I keep on hittin refresh up on your Insta, lookin' at the same picture 
 And if you post another, best believe I ain't gon miss it 
 Still thinkin' bout your kissin', reminiscing on our history 
 I should have paid attention, in high school during history 
 'Cause it's always gon repeat, like the hook up on this beat 
 Before you loved the money I could swear that you loved me 
 That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin' is free 
 Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

 (Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love) 
 (Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)

 Damn, that's really not feel enough 
 So many fish in the sea and that money's a good hook 
 If currency was currently about the talent 
 Then we wouldn't have to worry 'bout the commas in my balance 
 But when the label dropped me, all you did was copy 
 Trynna find the new Shway, but he's not me 
 I'll never be second cause second's way too sloppy 
 When all you did was doubt me, I just bounce back like Rocky 
 Don't know what you got till it's gone, hope those shopping sprees are good 
 Love defined in a dollar sign, I wish you understood 
 That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin' is free 
 Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

 Money over love, over love. She chose money over love 
 Money over love, over love. She chose money over love 
 She'd rather have the money than me 
 She'd rather have the money than me 
 But love makes you rich, don't you get it?
