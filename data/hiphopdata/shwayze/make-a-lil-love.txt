Turn out the light. Lock the door 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 And tonight, baby I'm yours 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 Little miss, can I steal the kiss 
 And put it in a bottle with a lemon twist 
 Pop the cap, and sip it slow 
 It goes a little something like this 
 I wanna see your glow 
 Don't wanna leave tomorrow 
 You blew in like the wind in Chicago 
 Sippin on silver shots of Milagro 
 Guess what Los Angeles dove 
 Thinkin' 'bout your body got the kid all messed up 
 Fessed up to the crime of this love 
 I just wouldn't feel right if I left ya 
 I wish I knew how to say, I really want you to stay 
 Turn out the light, lock the door 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 And tonight, baby I'm yours 
 We can make a little love, let's make a little love 
 Yeah, uh 
 Click, click take a picture of it 
 You and I like a mixture of it 
 Sex and love, put it in a cup 
 And when I drink, I drink to get drunk 
 Lights out, who'd I think I was' 
 Peach fuzz, I'm a sucker like a leech 'cause 
 Beg you the keys like Alicia 
 You my modern day Mona Lisa 
 I wanna hug ya, I wanna squeeze ya 
 Keep you up all night like the beasta 
 And when I leave ya, I wanna need ya 
 I wanna feel ya in my bones like fever 
 One hundred and three degrees of heat 
 Got my heart skippin' beats when I see ya 
 Walkin' down the street, walkin' down the street 
 Turn out the light, lock the door 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 And tonight, baby I'm yours 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Make a little love 
 Let's make love when it's pourin' outside 
 Let's make love when it's war outside 
 Let's make love just because 
 The people of the world don't make enough of it 
 And when this song is on bump it 
 Leap for love like you long jumpin' 
 Keep it up 'cause we all strugglin' 
 All you need is 
 Turn out the light, lock the door 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 And tonight, baby I'm yours 
 We can make a little love 
 Turn out the light, lock the door 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more 
 And tonight, baby I'm yours 
 We can make a little love, then make a little more
