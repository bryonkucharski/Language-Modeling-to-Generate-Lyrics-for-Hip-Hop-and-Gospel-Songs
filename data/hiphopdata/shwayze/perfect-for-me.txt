What it do, baby blue 
 Who am I? Who are you? 
 Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two? 
 What it is about you is 
 I love everything, your kiss 
 Your lips, your eyes, your nose 
 You're perfect 
 (You're perfect for me) (me x 4) 
 (You're perfect for me) (me x 4) 
 (You're perfect for me) 
 I know I never get you girl 
 If I let you go and forget you girl 
 So I call and I text you girl 
 To let you know I want next to you girl 
 We've been playing musical chairs for years 
 Walking up and down the stairs 
 Smile as we pass every once in a while 
 I used to buy a little grass from your brother as a child 
 Now I'm grown up 
 Maybe not but I know enough 
 And if I don't I aight gonna show her love 
 Be strong, take her broken heart, sew it up 
 No stairs, this elevator's going up 
 I be in paradise, million dollar gamble 
 The odds are against us but I got a handle 
 Of course I'm talking in the mirror today 
 'Cause when I see you in the street I never say: 
 I know you never get me girl 
 If I don't let you know who I am pretty girl 
 But in my head I see you dancing and twirling 
 I be your beach boy, you can be my city girl 
 Love and happiness 
 Butter napiness 
 Peanut skin 
 Salt water taffy lips 
 Cupid said love ain't an accident 
 Ran out of arrows so he hit me with the javelin 
 Travelin' 
 Wildberry mixed with the ramblin' 
 Man I want to feel more like a jam band 
 You my good time girl, what's happen' 
 TV on the radio, static keep crack-eling 
 I ain't an acter, You ain't an acter-ess 
 I want a real love, no cameras 
 No videos, no cameos 
 No champagne 
 Damn 
 I'm talking to myself again 
 'Cause what I saw on the street I never say 
 It hurts when I bite my tongue with my teeth 
 Now it's three years later and I still can't speak 
 I got every sneaker but I still can't sneak 
 I peaked so I'm looking for a thrill that's cheap 
 I'm a freak, little like the hunchback 
 In the corner with a dunce cap 
 With a hole in my heart with a thumbtack 
 If you loved me I never would've done that
