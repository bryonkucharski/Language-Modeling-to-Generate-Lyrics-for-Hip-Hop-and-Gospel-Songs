You should be sleepin' in my bed 
 Hangin' on to every word that I said 
 You should be ridin' like my shotgun 
 Don't need a bad bitch 'cause I know I got one 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 You could be my chick, and I could be your man 
 Picture perfect land, baby, toes in the sand 
 What would you do, with a hundred grand 
 You'd probably build a school, give it all to the kids 
 That's why I dig you, 'cause you're an individual 
 Only thing I don't know is baby are you single? 
 Baby are you single ? Tell me that you're single 
 She like diamonds so I took her to the diamond lane 
 She bout to get fly like the paper plane 
 She knows what's on my mind, we goin' to the rock 'n' roll hall of fame 
 You should be sleepin' in my bed 
 Hangin' on to every word that I said 
 You should be ridin' like my shotgun 
 Don't need a bad bitch 'cause I know I got one 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 We got the whole world in the palm of our hand 
 Sing a little song just to see you dance 
 This could be fun, this could be tragic 
 This could be luck, this could be magic 
 You're the only one for me, I know 
 But there's only one thing I need to know 
 Baby are you single ? Tell me, are you single? 
 She like diamonds so I took her to the diamond lane 
 She bout to get fly like the paper plane 
 She knows what's on my mind, we goin' to the rock 'n' roll hall of fame 
 You should be sleepin' in my bed 
 Hangin' on to every word that I said 
 You should be ridin' like my shotgun 
 Don't need a bad bitch 'cause I know I got one 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 You should be, you should be with me, whoa 
 You should be, you should be, be my chick, whoa 
 Oh, you should be, you should be with me, whoa 
 Ah, you should be, you should be... 
 Be my chick, whoa (Yeah, come on!) 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 (Oh yeah! You look good with me!) 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 (Oh won't you be my girl ? Pretty baby, won't you be my girl ?) 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 (Oh won't you be my girl ? Pretty baby, won't you be my girl ?) 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 (Oh won't you be my girl ? Pretty baby, won't you be my girl ?) 
 You should be, you should be my chick, whoa 
 (Oh won't you be my girl ? Pretty baby, won't you be my girl ?)
