If Michael Jackson came alive right now 
 He'd ask you to smoke one for him 
 So in his honor 
 You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short 
 Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want 
 I put it on my momma and her very last nerve 
 Ricky made off everything I deserved 
 The square root of a kilo is me nigga 
 The square root of a kilo is me nigga 
 Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga 
 It's all on me now, as you can see now 
 I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied 
 Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now 
 When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now 
 I'm at the round table, where your seat at? 
 Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass? 
 We ain't never left, acting like we back 
 You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap 
 This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit 
 Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit 
 This here reserved for soldiers most definitely 
 So watch what you say and where you step more carefully 
 If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me 
 Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me 
 Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em 
 Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle 
 You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh 
 This famous that'll still throw copper 
 Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle 
 Fire the ganja back up 
 Throw some blow in my tobacco 
 Then crank the Lac up 
 One match left, this the last turn 
 Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn 
 I'mma earn till the last court adjourn 
 Till the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked 
 We gon' have it locked 
 We gon' have it locked 
 I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto 
 But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company 
 It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably 
 But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me 
 My future's so bright but my past so ugly 
 And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me 
 Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me 
 So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair 
 All this space created, all that hard work it got me here 
 So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here 
 Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear 
 And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair 
 Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there 
 Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air 
 Secluded in my thoughts in fear 
 No one to talk to, no one there 
 Not even a voice, not even an ear 
 No one alive, no one to care 
 Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip 
 And they calling me counterfeit 'cause I ain't gave a coward shit 
 Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it 
 It's funny how it comes full circle 
 Now they wanna be a part of the power circle 
 They wanna be a part of the power circle 
 May the wind be at your back 
 May the bad be in your past 
 May the kids take all your good 
 And your wife have class 
 And you realize your goals 
 And what's life without grind 
 Those niggas, yo' niggas? 
 Hope those niggas real as mine 
 There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it 
 Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred 
 There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya 
 There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower 
 And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford 
 And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore 
 Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy 
 I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety 
 Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining 
 And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza 
 Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it 
 I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation 
 Allah got us 'cause if we hollered a lost numbers 
 I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers 
 So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians 
 My circle small but regardless, my circumference official 
 My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage 
 They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us 
 I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it 
 Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music 
 Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls 
 At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts 
 If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it 
 And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle 
 We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle 
 I'm like welcome to the power circle 
 I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle 
 Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you 
 'Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal 
 Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, till you hear that chopper speaking 
 Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it 
 If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up 
 'Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up 
 My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up 
 Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup 
 And still make the profit 
 The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest 
 I'm just being honest 
 Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us 
 Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers 
 Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered 
 And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas 
 Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster 
 And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia 
 Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout? 
 Probably talkin' 'bout us, we the only thing to talk about 
 'Cause we the only thing to talk about 
 'Cause we the only thing to talk about 
 Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived 
 You won't last a weekend outside 
 Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise 
 Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried 
 See a demon don't compromise 
 And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone 
 I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons 
 I might as well put all my killers in YSL 
 Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell 
 Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind 
 I know the priors they running by us when we do crime 
 I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms 
 When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July 
 Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life 
 When they day breaks and you earned them stripes 
 And you learned that strike 
 From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life 
 It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write 
 Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied 
 The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm 
 On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns 
 So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind 
 Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five 
 Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine 
 And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine 
 But pussy, where it hurt you 
 Life in the power circle 
 Regardless of how it goes down 
 Life goes on, am I right? 
 Tried to warn you niggas 
 I tried to warn you niggas 
 It's too late now 
 Double M-G 
 Too much cake 
 Too much power 
 Too much respect 
 Bow down, nigga, ugh!
