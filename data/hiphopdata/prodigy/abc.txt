 Young P: 
 Ayo daddy show these mothafucka's how we do it 
 P, P, P, P 
 P, P, P, P 
 Who holding down NYC huh? 
 P, P, P, P 
 Yeah, listen 
 Prodigy: 
 It don't matter who popping for the moment 
 P is forever, it don't matter what's the new hot shit 
 My shit better, courtesy of myself, thanks to me 
 I've work hard to come with these 
 Sixteen's is much more than a rap, this is pure facts 
 You see what's really good when you catch him by himself 
 Dolly, I leave a fool holy like Jesus Christ 
 It's a miracle he still living 
 And you could say a whole life time of prayer 
 But you never in this lifetime player be the mayor of the murder murder 
 Killer killer, bloody rap songs out the slums in the squala 
 Made a few dollars, now they say I'm too rich 
 I give some to you, now a nigga cool 
 Ha, I ain't got two cents for you bums 
 Now watch as I burn rubber in the six-huns 
 CL made my gun ring a bell 
 Where the shots came from they never can tell 
 They just here to fire and everybody bails 
 One nigga on the ground dying in hell 
 Fo'real! 
 (Chorus: Prodigy and kids) 
 A B C D E F G 
 H I J K L M O 
 P P P P P P P 
 And numero uno P 
 There's no other 
 Kids tell 'em who I be 
 A B C D E F G 
 H I J K L M O 
 P P P P P P P 
 The one and only 
 H.N.I.C. who holding NYC huh? 
 Prodigy: 
 Listen, R.I.P season begins 
 Dead bodies popping up, niggas getting hit 
 Others getting beat the fuck out and bashed out 
 MOP style, they get mashed out 
 I razor blade you up and cut you bad 
 You gon' need plastic where your face's at 
 Boy I'll bullet riddle you up and chop you into parts 
 Then scatter you all over the East Coast, kiko 
 You're playing with your life 
 You play with me you're like a baby running with a knife 
 You're upset your wife got my CD in the changer 
 And you rap too and she don't bump your bangers 
 Your shit wack and then on top 
 Your life style don't match the shit you pop 
 This is gon' be simple 'cause you're easy 
 Like 1 2 3, I do it niggas greasy as... 
 (Chorus: Prodigy and kids)
