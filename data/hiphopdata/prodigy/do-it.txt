P 
 Pack up 
 All you out your league 
 I be the Nigga In Charge 
 Y'all be the niggas under me 
 This is my house 
 What the fuck you think 
 You get spanked comin' up in my shit 
 I run this 
 My shit pop like them white boys on MTV 
 Your shit sound weak when its played after me 
 There is no competition 
 I'm the number 1 album of 2000 
 Cause your shits suck 
 Me and Hav be the best niggas to ever do it 
 What you think its just music 
 We live this shit 
 We from the soil the dirt the grain the pain 
 It still hurts 
 You can never satisfy my thirst 
 Y'all niggas had best disperse 
 I charge niggas with intent 
 You ain't gangstas 
 Go ahead jump and get plucked nigga 
 My guns buck and we love to fuck niggas up 
 If y'all niggas want to get at P 
 Do it 
 You got problems you want it with me 
 Come on 
 If you gangstas, gangbangers, thugs what 
 Do it do it come on do it 
 If the ladies want to holla at P 
 Do it 
 Gettin' hot you want to slide with me 
 Come on 
 For my mamis honeys big body bunnies 
 Come on come on do it 
 And the shit that kill me 
 Is radio be acting like they can't feel me 
 Said we too filthy 
 We uncensored 
 Not to mention all the drama and tension 
 When we step in 
 Your event get shut down when we dumb out 
 We got good hearts though we ain't start the bout 
 We just brawled 'em out and hauled 'em out 
 Promoters get scared and put on the lights for the house 
 Dun we just tryin' to have fun 
 Go at the ladies and possibly get in the jump 
 You crazy 
 You get blown open son 
 You tried to stop that flow on a big showboat and got cut the most 
 While your dogs afloat 
 Me and mines keep partyin and sparkin dope 
 Its simple 
 P is not to be fucked with 
 Put your thugs up put your guns up and shit 
 If y'all niggas want to get at P 
 Do it 
 You got problems you want it with me 
 Come on 
 If you gangstas, gangbangers, thugs what 
 Do it do it come on do it 
 If the ladies want to holla at P 
 Do it 
 Gettin' hot you want to slide with me 
 Come on 
 For my mamis honeys big body bunnies 
 Come on come on do it
