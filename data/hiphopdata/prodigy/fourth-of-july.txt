 Looked up the DJ, and said may I? 
 (Large Proffesor) 
 Blow and pow like 4th of July explosives? 
 Lit it up, like the 4th of July? 
 (Evidence) 
 Alchemist. 
 (Prodigy) 
 We doing it, getting our paper 
 We ain't rookies, we major 
 Name brand gangsters, you still a demo taper 
 Niggaz they want to hate us 
 Bitches they want to rape us 
 Everyday is like July 4th nowadays 'cause 
 We moving independent units 
 We sold out in any store in the US 
 Getting that independent cake 
 We sold out in any store in the UK 
 (Twin Gambino) 
 We came to pop in 
 Got ya ladies, draw dropping 
 Nobody can stop us, I was brought up in the projects 
 And I got, tonz of haze from uptown 
 We not trying to sell that shit, that's how we burn it down 
 Niggaz always drilling me, till they see my four pound 
 Bitches always feeling me, try to give me some head 
 While I'm in the studio, try to make that bread 
 Not a contriet dude, or of with ya head 
 Yo, 1st Infantry and fed 
 We gonna give you that gangsta music that hurts your ears 
 But the fear in ya heart, when you see the gift 
 We think big, A-L-see we get right 
 (Evidence) 
 Yo, every time I rest, I put it all on the line 
 Yo money never slept 
 That's why I barely get blessed 
 That's why I rarely go out, unless it's love at the club 
 Time is bread, that's what I'm about 
 And all my peoples got cloud 
 Check the resumé 
 One step closer to goal everyday 
 The game is to be sold not told 
 I tropping heavingly, world connected got the livest crew 
 We infinite, dropping gems but no clue 
 (Alchemist) 
 Every dollar I spend on wax, I turn it back into cash 
 Jetting back to the lab, I'm getting back on my job 
 I'm fully backed by the Mobb, I keep my back to the wall 
 Keep the blacks to my wall 
 I'm trying to stack till I ball 
 Until they cashing 'em all 
 I want to stack till this tall 
 Ain't gonna rap for to long 
 Gonna have to move on 
 I'm gonna stash till I'm gone 
 Green grass on my longue 
 Fuck a bank account, I need extreme cash in my palm 
 Smoke blur in ya vision, 
 You don't know who ya dissin' 
 I don't learning no lesson 
 I just hold my position 
 I don't go with a pistol 
 They just know I'm official 
 Shit, all I gotta do is start blowing a whistle 
 My name is ringing 
 My chain is swinging 
 Right now I'm speaking, but these beats are what I'm famous for fleaking 
 (Twin Gambino) 
 It's like rolling dice, we taking the bank tonight 
 Cut your face with a knife, now your scared for life 
 All I want is ice, a car, a girl and a crib 
 Tired of doing biz, I just want to live 
 Take care of my kids, fuck all that stress 
 Never wore a vest, only holding tecs 
 (Evidence) 
 We sold out every store in L.A. 
 It's loyalty where I stay, but ain't promised today 
 I keep my headlights on for 9-1-1 
 And on July 4th I might shoot one at the sun 
 Independent regardless of the fact I'm a signed artist 
 Fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest 
 When I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name 
 Hunger is just a different form of pain 
 I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street 
 To the point where I don't talk, my trackrecord speaks 
 To the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks 
 To the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week 
 Bringing the heat, so clear you understand me 
 Raise the stakes, up the antique 
 The better place, yo we land on winds 
 Dilated, Evidence, Alchemist, Big Twins
