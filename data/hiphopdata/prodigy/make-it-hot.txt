Super now smoke few bottles on the sleety 
 Parkers on racks 'cause I raps like Christmas 
 Holy shit get light, get light 
 It's hot outside I got the keys to the bike 
 Gone full bottle, tonight we're going in like it ain't no tomorrow 
 Take drugs, make love now war I'm a gangsta hippie don't start nothing 
 Keys tot he crib, while I'll be poppin' it all 
 Like belly the kid, yeah hoe whip bang it out 
 To the death, fuck it north, 
 Everything from the couch to the bed 
 Can't stop, won't stop till they superman though 
 Give me superman fly 
 And slash oh to the hood, I'm a creature 
 I grew up in the woods 
 No time for fake ones, 
 Come and smoke a little bit with this real ones 
 Live a little risky don't be a shuck one 
 I'm not stingy the shots on me 
 Oh, I'll make it hot, make it hot 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot 
 Yeah my pockets on loud, I'm in the string volume 
 My closet on swag, my balls at the top few 
 Best nigga spittin', pee how you livin' 
 Couldn't be better you could say stakes giving 
 You're my cold bottom drop 
 The hood gonna cop, the streets going crazy for that new more I 
 Set up in the box that's where I got stronger and 
 Came back home, took the ice off the watch 
 Automor Rolex couple hew blotch 
 Nothing fancy just enough for the potch 
 When your bitch is the baddest bitch how could you not 
 Feel like we're gonna parry on in the spot 
 Get off of my flag, hoe you let dancing 
 Is you what you do, don't worry about the handsome 
 Shoot 'em with the rubin kill 'em with the baby face 
 And be the humble that it squeeze slugs when you're late face 
 Hoes wanna grip, foes wanna trip 
 Then ever move on me 'cause they know how I get 
 Got real street power and it ain't about... 
 Met the top of the fool chain now here on the block 
 And you just a little snack, my hunger insatiable 
 Easy as 1 2 3 you niggas base the cool as millions of bros 
 But I just take one of them, these billions of dollars 
 I need the one of them 
 No time for fake ones, 
 Come and smoke a little bit with this real ones 
 Live a little risky don't be a shuck one 
 I'm not stingy the shots on me... 
 Oh, I'll make it hot, make it hot. 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot. 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot. 
 I'll make it hot, make it hot.
