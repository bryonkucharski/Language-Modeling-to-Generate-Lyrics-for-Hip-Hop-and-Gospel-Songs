Oh, baby I'm talking to you. 
 U-u-uh, yeah. 
 I would buy anything you sell, follow you to hell 
 You got me actin' over in myself 
 Don't drop me, 'cause I'm in the palm of your hand 
 My boys laughed at me, I don't even care 
 How may it sound 
 I'm just being real, well 
 I'ma speak from the heart 
 I'ma be sincere 
 You seem to be the type I could love for life. 
 I'm tryna found out for myself 
 See if I'm right baby 
 You're killin' 'em close 
 You'd be dressing your ass off 
 Hair and your nails looking fresh from salon 
 You ain't got to be on TV or magazines 
 From my POV (point of view), you're a star to me. 
 Can I, may I get your autograph 
 Or perhaps you could put your number under your name 
 And give the young man a chance to prove you 
 Worth a young woman such as yourself. 
 If I'm deserved it? 
 Oh, girl 
 Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of? 
 You my angel, yeah 
 Thug angel! 
 Oh girl, oh 
 I can't get enough of you 
 Come here baby (I need you), yeah. 
 Thug angel! 
 There goes my baby, my lady, my heart beat 
 She the blur circulating 
 Do my thing, she the torch in my brain 
 It go lavish trap for so long to obtain 
 'Cause yo dope, she mine 
 If I want her kit, got to treat her everyday as if 
 We just met, and she treat me the same 
 Smile on her face when I walk 
 Inside the room, nothing else matters. 
 Everyday silouhettes, the only living colors 
 Is me and my bitch. 
 Come here, give me kiss and your real hug too 
 They jealous, they tell us to get a room 
 But everyways I'm loveless, and I swear 
 We could make love right here. 
 Get my soft candy, I unwrap you 
 And then pop it in, the flavour everlasting. 
 Oh, girl 
 Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of? 
 You my angel, yeah 
 Thug angel! 
 Oh girl, oh 
 Come here 
 I can't get enough of you. 
 Come here baby (I need you), yeah. 
 Thug angel! 
 My baby like a simple bass, to give her happiness 
 She not into all of that, she ain't into all of this 
 I think we found the rest 
 And growing all together is in our future, 
 Love chow, waw, orgy, gorgeous 
 Flawless 
 She's all that I'm wanting when I'm boring 
 To my thugs, when we hang out in the clubs 
 'Cause I turned down all thet upper brothers 
 But, to her I'm the best thing 
 Since sex is been here 
 She cry when I'm in it, 'cause 
 It feels so good, like ball beauty 
 I doubt that you ever found another like mine 
 And I'll never ours. 
 So if we split, then we both had a loss 
 You're my soft candy, I unwrap you 
 And then pop it in, the flavour long lasting. 
 Oh, girl 
 Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of? 
 You my angel, yeah 
 Thug angel! 
 Oh girl, oh 
 Come here 
 I can't get enough of you. 
 Come here baby (I need you), yeah. 
 Thug angel!
