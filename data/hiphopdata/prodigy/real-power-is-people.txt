Sample: 
 "They are a secret network of international pirates 
 Who identify with no nation, no national flag 
 And no established religion. 
 Their flag is the skull and cross bones 
 And their God, G.O.D. spells Gold, Oil, and Drugs." 
 (Prodigy: talking) 
 One, two, aiight 
 Yeah, that's right, uh-huh 
 Uh, uh 
 Prodigy: 
 Live from the belly, they got me behind the fence 
 I run shit from the inside of the fucking President 
 Of the Infamous Gang - get whiff from my stank 
 I got that iky-iky cotton picky shit that have you dazed 
 I'm a quadruple O.G., a O so call me 
 The reincarnation of the Pharaoh with an ole E 
 The barrel full of hot lead; shoot a pot head 
 Talking that shit about Hip-Hop dead 
 Nah it's alive behind the gate; permanent smiley face 
 Any nigga stunting on the God; nah you outta place 
 I beat a lot of cases had to take an L 
 I see you in a hot sec', yep hold it down 
 Money's worthless, real power is people 
 Real strength is in the streets where everybody's equal 
 Fuck jewelry, fuck rims; let's spend on our protection 
 Get armor, get cameras, get with' it lil nigga this man's shit 
 Real power is people 
 Real strength is in the streets where everybody's equal 
 Prodigy: 
 This is live from behind the wall 
 Sitting, starring at the wall 
 I'm fit to pop out this bitch like a newborn 
 I'm fit to cut out all the smoking and the drinking 
 The wine and the spirits is evil where you take it baby 
 So I'm telling the truth, you live it then you see it 
 You breathe it then you be it 
 I'll tell you a lil secret 
 It's secret government that work shit for hours 
 They practice witchcraft to harness their power 
 Pedophile rape lil kids for energy 
 The Satanic rituals; W.T.C. (R.I.P.) 
 They let the Pentagon on fire 
 That's lightening the pentagram on fire 
 All these bodies for what? 
 So you could scare everybody into one world huh? 
 All my grime's is on deck 
 So if you ain't come for war then run 
 (Crowd protesting and gunfire)
