If I start rambling, don't mind me, 
 I might get off track, but who doesn't it? 
 I love rap music, but I hate the fake light... 
 Usually calls the lord Weedy. 
 So, I choose not to take part in it 
 On that extra seat, and just I do what I do 
 I'ma write this writters 
 Sometimes I'm overthink. 
 It's not ... it's how remind myself 
 My clean activity flows best. 
 Nigga, I'm not concerned you tryna make hits, 
 It's all bullshit, if you ask me. 
 When you bend over just to go Platinum 
 No, thank you. 
 As I'd be as clearly 
 That I'm comfortable with myself. 
 And that's all that matters 
 I made the point in my life with. 
 I'm cool with exterming perks 
 I just roll my shit, 
 And I can show you how to live to the f-ckers. 
 But you got to follow me like Twitter 
 This is not the casino... it won't be sweet 
 Helo hard boulevard, not easy streets 
 Without Rhyme or Reason 
 I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence 
 (x4) 
 It feels so good to have my own staff, 
 This over rappers they try it 
 They might like it, 
 Spend so much time copying tunes. 
 They don't even know what it's like to be 
 Themselves. 
 Or is it that they don't like they sell. 
 Maybe you defend who do you ... doing 
 What ? None. 
 Or maybe they would love you more, 
 Two actually tried, they never resured. 
 I know, we act like potential and? 
 Reality is not so gorgeous 
 The ugly truth, that you ain't got the heart to face it 
 You would lie, sex, money, fool, music 
 I score points like a ... win trophy 
 Yes, that nigga... balled out, but 
 I'm really just having fun with you 
 Don't hate, you should be concerned with ours 
 Cause my life's awsome. 
 I'm all buried in stash food 
 I might take a little time off 
 I'm out at tropics 
 Sending emails, drinks, laughing 
 Getting tanned. 
 Without Rhyme or Reason 
 I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence 
 (x5) 
 Do what I love, I don't follow low sequence.
