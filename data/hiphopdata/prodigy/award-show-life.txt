Then it goes a little something like this 
 Award show life, get dressed 
 Red carpet, cameras, get fresh 
 It's best you always look your best 
 'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah 
 Award show life, yeah we 
 Cameras, seats and arm candy 
 All access, badges, backstage passes 
 Big dark sunglasses, to match it 
 My life is like a video, eryday's a movie 
 The press tryna kill me, please don't shoot me 
 Coming out the spot with my mistress love 
 Holding hands and kisses and hugs 
 Front row, next to Bieber, Kanye and Carmen 
 In the spotlight life, Biggy told me you on touring 
 We was doing shows tryna reach our goals 
 He said P, don't forget how you got where you going 
 I was just a little nigga back then, I didn't care 
 If I didn't have a tux, afford a black tie fair 
 'Cause it wasn't my type of party, type of crowd 
 I'd rather be with a ...shootouts go down 
 A young ball mentality, ball down, 
 When you grow up in the hood, 
 You live the hood lifestyle 
 Now I own, network with big millionaires 
 And you prolly seen my picture in Vanity Faire 
 Award show life, get dressed 
 Red carpet, cameras, get fresh 
 It's best you always look your best 
 'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah 
 Award show life, yeah we 
 Cameras, seats and arm candy 
 All access, badges, backstage passes 
 Big dark sunglasses, to match it 
 I'm a publicity whore, fiend to be seen 
 I die for more air time on the screen 
 Nah, 15 minutes ain't enough for me 
 I need the endless run, don't try to kill my dream 
 I got a rock star house wife, she like nice things 
 Tavern on the green, breakfast at Tifanny's 
 Strictly Rolex and Cartier on her wrist 
 She high maintenance, it's my fault she like this 
 Spoil my bitch, award show lifestyle 
 We on our way to another show right now 
 My son growing up he thinks he Chris Brown 
 My lil daughter need that college money no doubt 
 I must bust my ass continue to shine 
 I cannot stop no, on the road I'ma die 
 Just like, give me my props 
 So I'ma take mine and climb over you, city top 
 Award show life, get dressed 
 Red carpet, cameras, get fresh 
 It's best you always look your best 
 'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah 
 Award show life, yeah we 
 Cameras, seats and arm candy 
 All access, badges, backstage passes 
 Big dark sunglasses, to match it.
