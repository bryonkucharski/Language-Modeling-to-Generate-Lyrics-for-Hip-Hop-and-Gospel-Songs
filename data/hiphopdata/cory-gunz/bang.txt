(Verse 1: Lil Twist) 
 I put the kush in the stogey, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive 
 I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive 
 I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back 
 I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back 
 These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me 
 I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie 
 I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz 
 I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang 
 Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up 
 This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck 
 In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh 
 My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's 
 Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome 
 I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it 
 Like when KG went to Boston 
 Or when Melo went to the Knicks 
 And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin' 
 Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans 
 Let me take a break, let me catch my breath 
 Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything 
 Nigga, I don't need nothing else 
 It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in 
 I fucked homegirl and her best friend 
 You don't wanna miss out on your blessing 
 Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon 
 I just 
 Shooter, BANG (x5) 
 (Verse 2: Euro) 
 Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson 
 Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson 
 Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum 
 How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether 
 Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features 
 See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend 
 No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in 
 Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim 
 Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him 
 All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching 
 Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin 
 Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win 
 The room's spinning 'cause I'm faded 
 Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related 
 I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it 
 Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it 
 I owe you one girl, I owe you one's 
 Money always been the main attraction 
 Homie told me women always been the main distraction 
 And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed 
 I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing 
 So you know I had to 
 (Verse 3: Cory Gunz) 
 Wanting manners when I don't even want a mask on 
 War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on 
 Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me 
 So for certainly I'mma get my blast on 
 To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us 
 Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon 
 Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home 
 With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm 
 And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm 
 Any nigga want it he gotta get it 
 The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it 
 I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going 
 Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom 
 Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's 
 You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs 
 Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off 
 When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off 
 Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off 
 Say making a remarkable pay 
 Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay 
 Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may 
 Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray 
 Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate 
 If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face 
 You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe 
 Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang
