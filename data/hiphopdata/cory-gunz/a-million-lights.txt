A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow 
 I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know 
 I'm breathin' fire in your cup 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 New Hermes duffle bags 
 On the plane, see the sky through a little glass 
 Twenty hour flight, now we jet-lagged 
 Sipping white wine, watching the sunset 
 Real love this close? I ain't never had 
 Sitting with you all day till the night pass 
 Damn, I ain't trying to fight that 
 But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last? 
 Now I'm lookin' over my shoulder, shoulder 
 Champagne, good dine and good times, and now it's all over 
 But can't blame me for all that 
 You was bright, now your heart all black 
 Try to outshine the good with the bad 
 You a cold motherfucker, I ain't mad at you 
 Still shinin' 
 A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow 
 I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know 
 I'm breathin' fire in your cup 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 You gettin' old and your heart turn cold 
 Time line froze, mad at the world 'cause you lived your life 
 But this the life that we chose 
 Lights on the road for the nicest road 
 I mean long-ass flights with these trifling hoes 
 But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled, I mean no life, low life 
 Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live yo life 
 Lame ass nigga, you cookin' with no spice 
 Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like 
 Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend 
 Leo lion and king, I'm lookin' for a dope queen 
 Uh, first thing baby, I'm ready to rock 
 Baby car goes high, man smash flocks 
 Me does, Millz, Tyga, we give 'em the chills (Millz-y) 
 Keep riders, get birth control pills 
 Uh, young money, bright lights 
 Lord knows I live for these nights 
 You're damn right, I'mma sip champagne till it burn my sight 
 Yanks fitted cap to the front, like Jeter 
 My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs, Jesus 
 Mouth jewelry, loud speakers 
 Blowin' loud weed with some loud divas 
 A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow 
 I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know 
 I'm breathin' fire in your cup 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 Uh, it's that summertime, money time 
 Gonna rhyme good time, when a dime gimme mine 
 Brown smoke, quiet engine out the silly lines 
 Pretty toes hangin' out the window to the finish line 
 Spikes pokin' out my kicks like a porcupine 
 Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line 
 Uptown thoroughbreaded from the south Bronx 
 How blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome 
 You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest 
 Life nothin' like a movie, I just date a? 
 Remember it was hard trying to page wagers 
 Nice spittin' hard rhymes on the main stages 
 Independent, yeah I told 'em major later 
 We some independent niggas gettin' major paper 
 Shout to 'em, Stunna, Slim, Mack 
 We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that? 
 YMCMB, lights, camera, action! 
 A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow 
 I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know 
 I'm breathin' fire in your cup 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold 
 It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
