What, yeah I'm on nigga run up 
 I'm runnin' with the gym blade in my fitted now 
 Fuck around with me and get knitted down 
 So much green can't remember the last time I shitted brown 
 Thirsty niggas ain't admitting they bitter sound 
 Now I'm hungry to show 'em I'm the hottest fucking kid around 
 Show 'em how it go I don't kid around 
 Fuck ya crew and label go get a town 
 And set off and spit around 
 YMCMB in the bee and pee on ya bean 
 Why and if I see 'em tell 'em I wouldn't wanna be em 
 Run off gun out, gun off run out 
 Fuck the what nigga bring the fun out 
 Militia gang rap for the dumb out 
 Try me for a come up 
 I bet ya niggas raps never come out 
 Smooth drinking swigga with a temper like a bliquor 
 On the itchy finger nigga bought a liquor on the victim goin' 
 Don't you know my name? 
 Gunz Militia Pop 
 Show these little niggas I'm not playing games 
 I'm a pro with the dot I'm a cold nigga pop 
 Like cash with the flames

 What, bitch nigga you ain't saying shit 
 I got business on the block, Amber, Wayne and Nick 
 If ain't depending on the watch then we made 'em sick 
 I knew a witness on the watch who became a vic 
 Had a wife of a life then became a bitch 
 Most my niggas lay the bricks so they lay in bricks 
 Or they laying bricks 
 I love the south like potato grits 
 But I bet whatever if you say the knicks 
 My niggas midwest with a plate of fix 
 Staged up and off the dimes and they making knicks 
 Caught a jooks by mistake I ain't mean to get em 
 Shit, he was the trick he ain't need to spend em 
 See me in any whips bet the nina's in em 
 Gimme Christinas lips put the penis in em 
 My closet looking like I got a cleaners in em 
 Y'all ain't poppin' tommy's y'all are just alotta gleamers with em 
 Don't you know my name?
