Where there's, more hungry mouths 
 Than food to eat 
 It's where the homeless 
 Roam the street 
 Where broken glass 
 And broken dreams 
 Are shattered and scattered 
 Amongst debris 
 Sufferation wrath 
 And still they laugh 
 And dream of a mansion 
 Above the half 
 No one to speak 
 Upon there behalf 
 Now tell me do they stand a chance? 
 Where there's, more food 
 Than mouths to feed 
 Where you find those who 
 Claim to lead 
 Because of all their personal greed 
 They always want more than they need 
 They don't help those 
 Below the half 
 Instead they stand aside and laugh 
 As if it's all we'll ever ask 
 When will they make a change? 
 CHORUS (Yami Bolo) 
 Children lift your heads 
 To the one 
 Who create the sun 
 My children 
 And your light will come shinning again 
 Show the world 
 Jah love is okay 
 When we rise and greet the sun 
 Lets give him thanks and praise 
 Illegal guns 
 They roam the night 
 In hungry hands 
 Waiting to bite 
 The first sign of 
 Any food in sight 
 Youths in the dark 
 Searching for light 
 Hard time they face 
 Is not a choice 
 Police curfew 
 Is no surprise 
 And with no one 
 To be there voice 
 Do they stand a chance? 
 Where there's, more hungry mouths 
 Then food to eat 
 Where you find those who 
 Claim to lead 
 Because of all there personal greed 
 They always want more than they need 
 They don't help those 
 Below the Ave 
 Instead they stand aside and laugh 
 As if it's all we'll ever ask 
 When will they make a change? 
 It's like a punk never check 
 Or dem did forget 
 Say a death 
 We nature naughty 
 Ah true mi go born uptown 
 Tell dem fools don't cross me 
 That's only where Cindy brought me 
 And that's why they can't impress me 
 With no boasty car 
 Me know dat ah kill dem softly 
 And then they're not 
 Really even who they think they are 
 They're not really moving crafty 
 Mi get fi understand 
 Say them plan dem faulty 
 Well nuff a dem a twenty 
 And favor forty 
 Filthy rich big belly 
 And hearty 
 Di real Gideon will 
 Be arriving shortly 
 Rasta nuh beat Binghi 
 Drum we claatt it 
 We live longer 
 'Cause we food nuh salty 
 We grow stronger 
 And dem can't assault we 
 So haile Rastafari love 
 And exhalt it
