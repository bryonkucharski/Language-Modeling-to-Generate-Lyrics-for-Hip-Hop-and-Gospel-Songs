 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of 
 KRS, Wild Style'n today 
 I stay controversial like Guantanamo Bay 
 My society is secret, sort of like the boulet 
 I'm not a average MC, I don't say what they say 
 I don't play what they play, I'm the type to find the needle 
 At the bottom of hay, that's why I'm rockin' today 
 Often they say "No way", until I say 
 Da-da-da-day and the crowd go "Hey" 
 From the time I stepped in the game 
 Kris been clear 'bout his rep and his name 
 I don't tolerate disrespect to my name 
 To uplift my people that's the reason I came 
 If you believe in peace then we believe in the same 
 If you believe in war I got that tec for your brain 
 If you think I'm a whore, man, you must be insane 
 I'm war in reverse like Big Daddy Kane raw 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of

 Poet on the track with the nigga that dissed Queen's bridge 
 Let me show y'all how to bury the hatchet 
 The Blastmaster, with the Black Bastard, a classic 
 This is one for your dome 
 Niggaz must understand, it's hip-hop full blown 
 Gimme the mic, I'ma stay shittin' 
 I'ma stay rippin' and banana clip spittin' 
 Niggaz know, Blaq Po', green beret flow 
 It's nuttin' to me, I do it all day yo 
 The victory is almost here

 We got the shit surrounded, time to wild out 
 Nigga what you wan' do, nigga don't ask me, this is your LP 
 Marley hollered at Preem, Preem hollered at me

 Marley Marl whattup 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of 
 This ain't what you're used to 
 KRS-One, Marley Marl, BDP with the Juice Crew 
 Who knew 20 years after Scott Marley Marl would pass the rock? 
 And I'd dribble it, dribble it, livin' it, nibble it a little bit 
 Before I enter the club and start killin' it 
 K-are-are, S-wah-wah-One 
 Yes they'd be the stars, me I'd be the sun 
 Jump right off the stage, breakin', breakin' you off 
 KRS is the best, of see-see-course 
 Street to the see-see-core, down by l-law 
 You the number 1 MC, oh sh-sh-sure 
 Meet me at the see-club, if you thinkin' you thug 
 KRS and Poet, this the type of hip-hop you love 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of 
 Marley Marl 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of 
 You rocked it, kid, you rocked it 
 The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
