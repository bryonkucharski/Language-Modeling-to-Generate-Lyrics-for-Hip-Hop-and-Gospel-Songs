Send 'em to Allah kingdom, pistol-grip pump rap 
 It's like music to my ears when the gun clap 
 You a stupid motherfucker, here's a dunce cap 
 Shoot you in the fuckin' stomach where your lunch at 
 I ain't listening no more, cause son whack 
 I'm like bustin' inside a rubber, I come strapped 
 Y'all wanna hear a fun fact? 
 My guns is heavy on the scale, god, dumb fat 
 Where the Mossberg? Where the dum-dums at? 
 Ninety-three million miles away from where the sun's at 
 I'm Jimmy nine times, cousin you a dumb rat 
 I put you in the back of the ac with Pun mac 
 I'm a grown-ass lion, you a young cat 
 Wet 'em up, better hope the ambulance comes stat 
 Take the shotty off the gun rack 
 Toss his body on the ground like when Charles Bark sonned Shaq 
 Wild motherfucker since birth, get hurt 
 Who's first? Got blood thirst, shoot up your hearse 
 It's insane, let me explain the pain 
 I came to reign supreme, hammer damage your brain 
 Highly flammable, easily slaying you 
 I do what I came to do, your hood should be ashamed of you 
 Blaq Po, murder motherfuckers up, yo 
 What the fuck is up? I don't care what they say, you fuckin' suck 
 The black monster go harder 
 Spit pure lava, word to the father 
 Don't make me show up at your crib with the pump 
 I can find out where you live, where you from 
 But you're not a threat, you're puppy-dog harmless 
 Tail between your legs when I start to bomb shit
