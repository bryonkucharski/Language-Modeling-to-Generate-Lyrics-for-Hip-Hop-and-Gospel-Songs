 (Killa Hoe) 
 Yes, motherfuckers 
 Yet you have entered the psycho ward 
 Where the X-Raided lays his head, niggas 
 So let that nigga tell his story... beotch 
 (X-Raided) 
 I be stalkin' like jason, nigga I ain't sayin' shit 
 Mask on wit' a machedi in my right mit 
 Ain't gon' be no "cha cha cha... cha cha cha" 
 'Cause all you gon' be hearin' is "ratta-tat" and "pop pop" 
 And it ain't gotta be no Friday the thirteenth 
 I don't give a fuck if it's Sunday the fifteenth 
 Any day is good for me to go and kill a ho 
 So fuck the money, mo murder mo murder mo 
 And it's a nightmare on yo' mama's street 
 But freddy's bitch-ass is dead, so now you got to deal wit' me 
 And ain't no need to make no part two, three or fo' 
 'Cause I'm gon' kill 'em all in that first episode 
 Slit 'em open with the straight razor 
 Killin' 'em quicker than that mother fucker pinhead on hellraiser 
 I'm hellbound so the X-Raided loc ain't no joke 
 When I creep I use that nine-millimeter to split yo' face wide open 
 'Cause nigga you know I got no brain 
 Mama said when I was young I didn't play I liked to gangbang 
 My psychiatrist told me I was totally insane 
 I'm packin' a millimeter nine-a nina it's same daisy 
 I got that loco-active siccness 
 Makin' a nigga lunatic 
 I fit you filthy murderous when I'm blastin' on them bitches 
 Killin' 'em up, fillin' 'em up with lead 
 I'm full of that liquor I'm stickin' my trigga unloadin' da shit sicc 
 So psychoactive nigga bangin' the deuce-fo' s t r to the double e t 
 Don't tell my nina you seem to be incubate 
 And I ain't trippin' on all that payback shit you ripped in jail 
 By then I'll have that nine to make that brain thang hang out, nigga 
 You fuckin' with the g'sta 
 When you runnin' up on the x you better bring your favorite preacher witchya 
 'Cause you gon' need him to be a witness when I smoke ya 
 Look you in yo' eyes and say "you shoulda been a loc'sta" 
 (Killa Hoe (Da Misses)) 
 Creepin' through the dark with that motherfuckin' mask on 
 Packin' that nine-millimeter niggas be ready to get they blast on 
 Creepin' through the dark...

 Aimin' for the heart... 
 (..Slaughterin' motherfuckers)

 (Da Misses) 
 Pick up yo' god damn remote turn on your TV 
 Ya hit the channel to one eighty-seven faculty 
 Look in the light you'll see that sista, "hey LSG" 
 Oh with the stogie-ogie-ogie now follow me 
 And to your death, yeah bitch you shouldn'tna fucked with a g 
 'Cause I got that S A C on my motherfuckin' family, uzi 
 Shit it gets crazier, disect your fuckin' heart 
 And bury your ass in the motherfuckin' park 
 Pop chop chop goes your head 
 'Cause it's the bloody murdy with the ammo gat that ya felt 
 My dear, catch the needle in your eye 
 Time to get wicked oh yeah time to die 
 'Cause the voices be sayin' 
 "Misses start sprayin' 
 On these punk-ass niggas talkin' shit and nuts ain't even hangin'" 
 So slippedy slip slip slip slip slide 
 Got the fuckin' glock and on your soul I'm 'a ride 
 Because it's the motherfuckin' bone 
 Ready to get gone 
 And it's da motherfuckin' miss with the mask on 
 (Killa Hoe) 
 Creepin' through the dark with that motherfuckin' mask on 
 Packin' that nine-millimeter niggas be ready to get they blast on 
 (Chopah) 
 Biatch get your grip 'cause I'm on that mission 
 I slit first like O.J. so don't let me start rippin' 
 Shift up like a wind storm, now hollow ones make your body warm 
 But niggas are wanted for the life I have no pitty 'cause I love harm 
 So i... want to bust caps like a g 
 Hey g pass me the hk afta that nine-millie so them fools come remember me 
 "You crazy nigga," not crazy, I'm psycho 
 Once I'm bustin' shots at them niggas moonwalk just like michael 
 I flip, 'how you flip?' 
 I'm flippin' it back and forth 
 I'm havin' one of them bitches movin' they mouth and playin' poor sport 
 Oh shit mista nigga where's yo vest I'm 'bouts to pop ya 
 How many times do I have to tell you you cannot like fuck with the chopsta 
 I rip shit the fuck up, that's the perfect sign to 
 Slit your throat, and bury your ass where no one can find you 
 With my mask on, my paths leave no evidence 
 Black gloves black scarf crept I creep nights so handle shits 
 You punk-ass bustas 
 I heard you couldn't trust us 
 Your set be should be on move sorry 'cause your whole block is bustas 
 Vamp like that, black is cool I see no sunshine 
 Knocka full of AKs and a backpack full of tech nines 
 Biotch!

 (Lunasicc) 
 Whan ya see my nina, ya shoulda ducked 
 Just knowin' a nigga like Lunasicc don't be givin' a fuck 
 So uh, I lit it up now I'm gettin' up out of that bitch 
 Tear my bucket down march with fo' fo's burned up on the fuckin' ground 
 I left him dead his bloody head left on the concrete 
 There he lay when the AK spray brains lookin' like hamburger meat 
 I'm gettin' ghost like casper 
 But I'm not that friendly nigga I'm that Lunasicc bastard 
 I'm hazardous to my own health 
 Just any minute I just might grab that nine millimeter and bust my own self 
 So we can take it to the next level 
 I go to hell and get at the grim reeper yellin' "fuck the devil!" 
 So we can take it to the crossroads, motherfucker 
 Even then my nine steadily loaded killin' all you bustas 
 Fill it up with hollow tips then pop nigga drop me one 
 Fillin' all you devils up with them hot ones 
 Kickin' down doors with x, shoot my gat in fuck the discussion 
 All I want is the cash, if there ain't none I'ma blast 
 Killin' ya doctor, ya ambulance driva, and ya nurse 
 You're walkin' to your funeral 'cause x'loc blew up your hurse 
 You'z a victim of the lunasicc, hell of quick to blast 
 Ash to ash dust to dust right up on yo' motherfuckin' ass 
 With the quicka, the reepa the nigga 
 Takin' the gat with a blast straight to the dome 
 Lunasicc for the nine-five bitch creepin' with my mask on
