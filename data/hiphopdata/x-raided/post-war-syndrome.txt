I cocked my mind back mental magnum spit hollow point venom vigorously 
 So you can respect my way of closing people lyrically 
 Rappers be plantium and call on me level high skill is my criteria 
 With prize for smashing on men for the inferior 
 It's nefarious not biggie, nas or jay-z 
 Fact not non-fiction I'm truly living this ghetto legacy, it was blast for me 
 Wen the source neglected the don killuminati 
 Can shoot a stri lyric unease so they can ride past me 
 I'm a vigilante equipped with infinite lyrical arson 
 Deliberate and intentional this is war I hope you taking it 
 Personal not reversible, dispersible 
 I need a batik semi automatic 
 Blasted, blast quik x-raided the rhyming achromatic 
 I done had it up to here with these pathetic fabricated war stories 
 Being spit by these over exaggerated master of cermony's 
 Polly prolly want a cracker cause you parrots parrot all you hear 
 Prepared your day of reckoning is all to near 
 If you disrespect that my cock take back and shoot till it jams 
 Post war syndrome sticking it on like blue to the dance 
 So many of my men gone died in the war didn't make it home 
 Never at ease I'll never step on my g's in this warzone 
 Miscellaneous elements create this magnum opus 
 Optimist prime suspects knowing I'm the illest lyricist 
 Rhyme catalyst, hella bent and extremely hazardous 
 Chemically war in balance the rare and the dopest 
 Have me on hiatus politically exiled x-raided 
 Nefarious elminating rapper's cause it contract madated 
 Penetrated the game with stolen no limitations 
 Black market's mad man 5 star generals stripping y'all maggots 
 Holding all ar's hostage by the flocks cock glocks 
 With ransom notes demanding mad man's increase in stocks, poisoning as ham locks 
 Specifically delivered to you 
 X-raided wont pay ridiculous revenue 
 For a record review if the truth, rearview 
 Reflections of a misanthropist past this 
 Now my squad dominanting bill board top 100 hit list 
 Criminologist the culprit Jon rambo bound 
 Orignal jacka mysterious murder glove never found 
 Infiltrated I crossed all the enemy lines 
 Obliterated many infiltrates like secluded land minds, conscious minds 
 Shoot at hypocritical politcal factus 
 Evious gats systematically killing ignorant rappers 
 Unsympathically expressed briefly pressed in options gotta spit your mind 
 From the highest elevation on earth can top this 
 I'm relentless steadily brain bashing weak MC's 
 Please I question if you really klack gats and push key's, unexpectedly 
 The rap game dictated y'all tragedy, heavy arterially 
 Infiltrated what you claim flawlessly game tight I profess my ghetto star exquistely 
 I'm pulling hoe cards of all wack rapper's within this industry 
 Prepare for the impact of my catastrophic clarity, you can't damage me 
 Nor defeat this post war strategy 
 I sit on the strong of the western hemisphere yelling who got my back 
 All literal under achievers suck my testical sac
