(Feat. Chill Bola) 
 (Chill Bola) 
 I'm so sick of these little 
 Trick ass cats 
 And their bitch ass raps 
 Acting like they factors 
 They ain't nothing but rappers 
 They need to miss us with that shit, that they try to make us believe 
 You ain't no killas dog, just like you rap and blow weed 
 I hang with, cake movers 
 3-time losers 
 Big body pushaz, and marijuana abusers 
 Chickens never refuse us 
 They always go with us 
 Even your baby daddy wanna roll wit us 
 Y'all some wack niggaz 
 I'ma nigga that rap 
 Without this rap shit you cats would be some square ass macks 
 Its bola and X-raided 
 Them niggaz they love hating 
 Middle finger salute for all of the thug nation 
 This is for my true trippaz 
 Door hing kickaz 
 Forty cal packaz, and all of my thug niggaz 
 So I'm just rapping just what you see trick 
 I take it to the streets quick 
 I let it be known 
 What you gone see is what you get BITCH! 
 (Chorus x3: X-Raided) 
 Let it be known nigga 
 Call your bluff like a phone nigga 
 Chrome trigga make your bone splinter 
 Its on nigga 
 Connecting puzzle pieces, put together the trigga releases 
 He projected 'cause we down for whatever 
 (X-Raided) 
 Fuck around and get kidnapped by a masked man 
 Tossed in a black van 
 Either give us the cash, or they find your ass in a trash can 
 I'ma mad man 
 Figurative, and literally speaking 
 Life is a game and I'm trying to win and nigga I ain't above cheating 
 Deleting enemies like a mistake on a computer screen 
 It's a horror flick and I'm the director 
 We gonna shoot a scene 
 Shotting me a forty-four caliba gat 
 And I blowing your brain right out the back 
 Of your cerabellum like J F K 
 And watch 'em get the fuck out of the way 
 Coming to spray parabellum 
 Got tired of trying to tell them 
 I'm ready to buck 
 Leaving you stuff, bout to erupt 
 Like mount st. Helens 
 Da felonies crimes committed 
 'Cause I'm committed to living this gangsterism 
 Killa 'cause me and my nigga 
 Ain't down for riding for mistaking our senses 
 We making decisions 
 Is it life or death 
 I suggest you pick a later date to be painless 
 Splatter your brain with the smith and wesson stainless 
 Is a lesson to be learned 
 You better pay attention 
 Y'all nigga is bitches, I blew up your stomach like water retention 
 I'm water resistant 
 Ain't no wetting nefarious 
 Niggaz wanna bury us 
 'Cause they hoes wanna marry us 
 Niggaz is scary as a calvary line 
 Ain't got no courage 
 Il serve fitin to that shit that you heard 
 Every word bitch let it be known nigga! 
 (Chill Bola) 
 My nigga I never hesitate, to extend an extra clip 
 When them niggaz be running off they mouth with all that excess lip 
 Let his blood drip 
 Let the nine kick 
 At anytime, take frame of mind 
 To immobolize your whole clique 
 Punk bitch 
 Get addicted clpis to your clips 
 And if you playing the captain 
 Then you falling with ship 
 Let it be known 
 I send a squad of killaz up inside your home 
 Strapped with fully's and chromes 
 Leaving your body exsposed to bones 
 While I'm posted at the tele 
 Hit me on my celly phone 
 No love your orders is carried out 
 That problem you had is gone 
 So bitch niggaz break bread 
 And cough up my dividens 
 Before they stay to view the body 
 While I'm contacting your next of kin 
 We packing straps for caps 
 Pulling jacks for scratch 
 Infest your hood with bombs 
 Like we did them japs 
 Making you fumble up your bundle 
 When I hit your ass with one of them slugs 
 Based up on the fact that there ain't no motherfucking love nigga
