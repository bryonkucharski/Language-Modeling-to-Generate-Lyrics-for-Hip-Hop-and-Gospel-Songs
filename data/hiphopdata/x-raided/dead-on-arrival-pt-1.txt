I'm have visions like Frank Lack the millenniums dead 
 Wakin' up in this cell thinkin' why am I here 
 Can you tell me how many times can one man die 
 Mr. Kavorkian, please give me one more try 
 I'd rather rest in peace than live my life in this living hell 
 Real niggas living bad while them fake niggas livin' well 
 Bustas is picking on me, what can I do about it 
 I'm gonna ride and you rhyme and when I spit it I shout it 
 No doubt about it its misery but these niggas ain't knowin' 
 Got me in this penitentiary tryin' to keep me from flowin 
 So I'm going 51-50 local bitchmade busters 
 By all means necessary nigga 
 ? Motherfucker 
 I heard that if I die it's a casualty to war 
 I know you niggas is dissapointed but I'm back once more 
 The disciple will judge what the fairness is 
 Playa haters wanna bury the snitch 
 Had me dead on arrival 
 No chance for survival 
 I know everybody gotta die 
 But when it's my turn to go I wanna go out with a BANG 
 Fuck pain and suffering, shoot me in the brain 
 Now there ain't no way up out the game when you in to deep 
 Bullet holes through the brain put me in to sleep 
 Put you out your misery like you the Lazy Duff 
 If I get to heaven first I'm gonna wait for ya 
 When you with 25 like the only way to escape 
 Is to run for the gates and let 'em hit you with eight 
 Right in the middle of the door I blow my brains to pieces 
 And send me straight to gangstas paradise with the trigga releases 
 I rest in peace and at last lord that's all I ask 
 Throw me in a casket and throw some dirt on my ass 
 Let's get it on but no more pain and no more expectations 
 I know my dead homies up there waitin 
 Dead on arrival no chance for survival 
 I know everybody gotta die 
 But can you tell me why I'm having visions of slugs 
 My head penetrated 
 Them niggas murdered X-Raided 
 Guess who retaliated 
 You risk the game to the broad 
 It was your decision 
 My designated assassin got infared vision 
 He did it quiet no mention the murder on the news 
 Game over you knew the rules 
 Callin all soldiers 
 Load up the clips and your holdsters 
 50,000 dollars reward on wanted posters 
 Ride till you die puttin' it down like you supposed to 
 It's the beginning of the ending 
 Game over can you feel it 
 Tension is in the air 
 Scaring niggas to death producing heart attacks 
 A black spread with green dots your pulse is fading 
 Flatline 'cause your ass is hating 
 (Chorus: x4 till fade)
