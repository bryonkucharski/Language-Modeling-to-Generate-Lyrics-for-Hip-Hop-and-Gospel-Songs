(Feat. Kingpen, C-lim, T-Nutty) 
 (X-Raided) 
 Niggas is coming for me from all directions whole court the streets 
 Fuck the police we never call protection 
 I'm right here mothafucker I ain't hard to find 
 Them niggas you came with riding they ain't as hard as mine 
 I heard a bitch nigga say raided needs to die 
 Wanna see raided dead what's the reason why 
 Retaliation, Revenge for convictions and murdered ones 
 I'm in the pen one phone will murder ya son 
 Your homeboys is bitch-made don't even speak with the ?? 
 Its deuce four six eight rip your teeth out ya face 
 I walk a daughter cross a nigga never roded up [??] 
 Selenas valley ride time never folded up 
 So who da bomb x cazenscy? raided 
 Una bomb future mind mad man shot caller like juvalon super don 
 Sin capater capture attack niggas capital punishment 
 Dumping bodies in Sac Rivers 
 (Chorus: X-Raided) 
 Niggas is coming for me 
 Where can I go what can I do 
 Niggas is gunning for me 
 For the shit we did to they crew 
 And now they hunting for me retaliation on they mind 
 But I'm waiting for them with dessert eagles and tech-nines [x2] 
 (Kingpen) 
 Niggas is coming for me retaliation for past sexes 
 Niggas is gunning for me because of ????? 
 Niggas is hunting for me locating me and black sacks 
 But ain't got nothing for me stay straped nasty and fat sacks 
 Get me ?? I know these niggas play for keeps 
 They wanna catch me slippin by and lay a nigga six feet deep 
 But peep I'm a savage in these co streets like Jay Joner 
 So bring the yellow tape and the white cheeks around the corner 
 These niggas gonners if they call us when the wars on 
 Return the streets into a warzone full of chrome 
 Desert eagles moving ? in the reaker about that nigga and his people 
 Kill 'em all wont be no sequel because I'm lethal like street nine 
 Lunatic wit a sick mind like Manson 
 Empty the clip 187 dancing 
 Leaving them lethal creeping why you creeping with a mask on 
 Kick in the door and get my blast on
