It's the motha fucking X and I'm back on a dope track 
 And ya gotta listen how to keep a ho stacking 
 What you got to do to have your bitch clock in 
 Is put her in a skirt, and sit her on Stockton 
 Fish-net stocking tied around the thick thigh, 
 Make her look good to the normal nigga eye 
 She'll make a killing even if she ain't fine, 
 'Cause a big ass and some titties is a gold mine, 
 Deuce-nine dollars, a nut, two nuts is 58, 
 An extra 4 if want the hoe to masturbate, 
 A blow job is 30 bucks a hit, 
 But it's worth it to see the hoe swallow the gooey shit, 
 And when you're through she's coming to see daddy, 
 Like a O.G., you know me, I'm sitting in a Caddy, kicked back 
 Looking at the hoe like wow, Bitch you're my slave, 
 What should I make you do now? 
 You can't treat a bitch good, you know, 
 What good is a pimp if he ain't slapping his hoe? 
 So niggas, let a bitch know you don't play, 
 And say that they gotta price to pay, yeah 
 I want my motha fucking money 
 You either pay me or pay me no motha fucking mind 
 I gotta get it through every motha fucking time nigga 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Who's the motha fucking ho nigga 
 Bitch give me my motha fucking money when I ask for it bitch 
 Nigga fuck that stomp that ho nigga uh nigga bitch 
 I want my money bitch you know what I'm saying, fo sho 
 Who's the hoe? A bitch named Tammy was the trick, 
 She gave up the pussy for not one cent, 
 She didn't pay me, but fuck it I kept the hoe, 
 And every night at 6 A.M. I was climbing out her window, 
 My nigga Neko hit 'em too, 
 But I don't give a fuck cause the nigga's from the crew, 
 I can't lie, I hella liked the bitch, 
 But like Vamp Dogg said, "Once a bitch, always a bitch", 
 So why bother trying to change her, 
 I'd rather play the role and treat the bitch like a stranger, 
 The only women I respect, 
 Is my mother and my sister, disrespect I'll break yo neck, 
 It's hella easy pulling hoes, 
 'Cause they all on the dick 'cause of the daytons and the vogues, 
 So stupid bitch you gets no play, 
 We from the gardens and you got a price to pay, yeah, 
 Like I said, pay me or pay me no motha fucking mind, 
 If you see me walking through the mall, 
 Sagging my Levi's with a motha fucking cellular phone outside, 
 You know the gold D's and the vogues and shit, 
 Don't even say shit bitch cause you know what I want, 
 If you ain't gonna drop the draws don't even stop and pause, 
 Just by the greedy bitch all you have to do is flash, 
 A little bit of cash and the question that she asks is 
 How much money do you make, but if you really listen, 
 It's how much money can I take, 
 Fake niggas don't know the game though, 
 They in love with a pretty ass burning ho, 
 But fucking with me she'll get a pat on her back, 
 A tore up pussy and a tic-tac, 
 Based on the fact she swallowed all the sperm, 
 The bitch thinks she's getting a free perm, 
 And a dress and a sweater, get real, 
 Fucking with me and you'll be grinning with a happy meal, 
 And Oprah Winfrey you'll get your ass whooped, 
 You better keep fucking with a Cookbook, 
 You're intelligent and a black lady but don't let yo-yo get ya tore up, 
 And if you think I'm treating you wrong, 
 Pack your shit and get your monkey ass on, 
 Go stay with your mama and say, 
 Them niggas from the gardens don't play! 
 Ya ya ya you gotta do the right thing 
 You gotta do the right thing 
 And the right thing is to pay me 
 You could lick me from head to toe 
 You know what I'm saying a quick blow 
 'Cause I'm from the 4 
 And you got to give me all your mail 
 You know what I'm saying 
 I need a double up you gonna pay for it? 
 The bitch that's giving up the cash 
 I know some hoes who will straight up jack your ass 
 You might go to the mo-mo and get you some 
 But you waking up broke and feeling dumb 
 She made you cum then your ass went to sleep 
 She got your keys and out the door the hoe creep 
 You got ganked by a sneaky ass bitch 
 Who's riding with another nigga fronting your shit 
 But you had to have the cock that's what you said 
 And you thought the hoe was sprung 'cause she gave you head 
 But it was all part of the bitches plot 
 A big spider web, yo ass got caught 
 You bought dinner that night, loc 
 Yeah, red lobster, a big fucking joke 
 She got fed, ate, and paid quick 
 And all you got was the short end of the stick 
 See, niggas just love to buy shit 
 The hoes cry to make a nigga go for it 
 Not me, cause see I do it my way, 
 And every bitch got a price to pay, yeah
