We got a price on ya head 
 Baller Niggaz wanna see ya dead 
 It's a fifty g contract 
 I don't know what you did 
 But they wanna kill you ya wife 
 And ya kids on contact 
 We got a price on ya head 
 Baller Niggaz wanna see ya dead 
 It's a fifty g contract 
 I don't know what you did 
 But they wanna kill you ya wife 
 And ya kids Mortal Kombat 
 (Verse One) 
 Close ya eyes and envision what the scene was 
 Hit a nigga with an AR-15 slug 
 And then I grab the loot 
 Absolute 
 We had to shoot 
 'Cause he was lookin' at a nigga with a mean mug 
 And the theme was we was in kahoots 
 He played games shot his ass dead in the brain 
 Had the liquor red fluid 
 Was a bitch and I knew it 
 When it came down to it he was scared to bang 
 That nigga dared the game 
 To get his ass with his actions 
 Been through it many times before 
 He was down to side 
 But how many of them niggaz 
 Really gonna be down to ride when it's time to roll 
 Ain't got no time for distractions 
 Money over bitches 
 Cause them hoe's ain't nuthion but some agravators 
 Unnessary temptations 
 Instagatin' situations 
 By makein hoes swell up like activator 
 My nigga jumped out the lincoln Navigator 
 Packin more heat it's the Cash And Tango 
 Dot-Dog hit the corner with the infared 
 On you in the blue 99 dodge durango 
 You don't wanna test this 
 Fuck around and get stranggled 
 Till they leave you breathless busted 
 Ya must have a death wish 
 Ya got heart 
 But don't get it cardiac arrested 
 It's to late for retractin y'all statements 
 Y'all mutha fuckas done wore out my patients 
 On my momma I'm a make sure ya hood gets rolled on 
 More than some triple-gold-daytons 
 Nigga you don't know what you facein 
 Up and tied in the ups 
 Take a dance on the x-side 
 With mad men and they medalions 
 Even all funny style niggas with a trail 
 Get they neck tied 
 We got a price on ya head 
 Baller Niggaz wanna see ya dead 
 It's a fifty g contract 
 I don't know what you did 
 But they wanna kill you ya wife 
 And ya kids On contact 
 We got a price on ya head 
 Baller Niggaz wanna see ya dead 
 It's a fifty g contract 
 I don't know what you did 
 But they wanna kill you ya wife 
 And ya kids Mortal kombat 
 (Verse Two) 
 Take you outta the game 
 Cause you a rookie makin' mastakes 
 You'll fumble the ball 4th quarter down seven 
 Infiltrated ya game 
 Workin for the state 
 Lookin' for dirt 
 But all ya shookin ass found was seven 
 Desintergrated ya brain 
 Me and Dot-Dog crumpled them all 
 Like a 6 pointer earth quake 
 Bent you outta shape 
 Stapped a fifty pound weight to his chest plate 
 Dummped his fake ass in the lake 
 Sleepin' with the fishes 
 Cause me and my niggas get vicous 
 And hittin it with us 
 Is impliable to bullets and bitches 
 Impossible 
 Have ya momma visitin the hospital 
 Trama center where ya delayin-ma fittles 
 I'm soon to be layin in bed 
 Body bruised green purple to red 
 Like a bag of skittles 
 And I'ma pack a little 380 
 Creep into the room 
 Infa beam circle on ya head 
 Boy now ya dead 
 Time to creamate em 
 Seen photo 
 I'ma blow up ya stomach for nine months 
 Rosemary baby stab but up out ya guts 
 Hear his mom screamin 
 Mia fyral gave birth to my demon 
 I was meant to be a fyrl screamin 
 Callin all mad men 
 If we deeper than the pack 10 
 Packin mack 10's 
 X-raided for life 
 And nigga ya life is in danger 
 Based on a true story 
 Niggaz wanna hang your wife 
 Feds find a corpse in a two story building 
 No head no hands 
 Ain't no checkin' dental records 
 Or the the finger prints 
 As for Identifyin the body there ain't no chance 
 Got the cops shot 
 Leavin' niggas propped up 
 In fucked up positions 
 Like dean koonts hide away 
 I'm a psyco and my motto is 
 All of ya bitch niggaz gotta die today 
 I'm takin' off wherever I go 
 If you in the car with me 
 Then you'd betta have a gat and a mask 
 Ain't no tellin' when we have to blast 
 Homicide at the crime scene pickin' up the aftermath 
 I'ma forever gonna be after cash 
 That's why I'm at that ass 
 You wanted dead or alive 
 First man with ya head get the prize 
 If we kick down the door and catch you in the bed 
 Don't be surprised 
 We gotta price on the head 
 Baller niggaz wanna see ya dead 
 It's a contract worth fifty g's 
 Every killa in the town lookin' for ya 
 With murder on they mind 
 A nine milla and a fifty to squeezee 
 Niggaz wanna gun ya down 
 I don't know what ya done but it was major 
 My nigga hit me on the pager 
 You been indited 
 Every single body in the town know about it 
 (Chorus: repeat to end)
