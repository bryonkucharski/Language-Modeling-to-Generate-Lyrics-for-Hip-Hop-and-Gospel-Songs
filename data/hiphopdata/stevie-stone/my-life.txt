As I travel this road and that this road 
 Unfolding its cold but I'm holy 
 Need a sacrifice you know, livin' a life 
 To make the peep coly 
 Story of my life 
 My life 
 Yeah, I been writing this one for a year or two 
 Sittin' here, smokin' what know I been through 
 Rely on my dream, thoughts want to continue 
 To my loves one, I hope this one don't offend you 
 As a kid Momma taught me how to withstand the weather 
 Daddy said life will be trails at first it will make you better 
 Took it by money and woman, niggas is out to get me 
 Cost for detraction, the 'clipse and glam on my back are with me 
 Is what a crystal would see 
 A trapped in a hole, no turning around 
 Liftin' my head above ground nigga 
 Its destine to be, I can fix the goal 
 Since I dot the one, who die within me, ridin' me turning on the heat 
 There's a fork in every road 
 North short cut, live up turn on stone 
 Envision it right, get prettied right 
 I givin' you the story my 
 Story of my 
 Story of my life 
 My life 
 Been ridin' down this one way lately 
 I found myself in middle of g 
 I'm missin' all my kids growing on grief day 
 Daddy's already doing this all for you 
 Can't justify my time for no money 
 Sacrifice was made, is true 
 But I want to let you know, I'll never leave you lonely 
 When far out thousand miles away from you 
 Been long since the deal, body said she don't feel like 
 Found away for us to break through, tryin'a hold tears back 
 Pourin' my heart out as I write 
 90 miles for hour thinkin' as I travel through the night 
 Envision it right, get prettied right 
 I givin' you the story of my 
 Story of my 
 Story of my life 
 My life 
 Story of my life!
