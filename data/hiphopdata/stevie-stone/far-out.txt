The following entry has... uh... seen mankind complete 
 Its first evolutionary steps into the universe 
 Leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe 
 I'm far out, off the chain 
 Took the star route, I done lost the plane 
 (I spit the bars out, with the quick of our mouth 
 Get the feeling of the tip and let them take the dart out 
 With the superstar route, I can take it far out) 
 Find me, I'm off in low Earth orbit 
 I'm far out, now I'm talking 'bout gotta get ready 
 Your gravity to come towards it 
 I skyscrape, jump up in a cloud and absorb it 
 Rain down on you niggas like a storm hit 
 I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, important 
 You know that I am dumb fresh, super fly, stupid high 
 Around business like suit and tie 
 Trying to get paid like that Youtube guy 
 I'm one of them dudes, that get to running your dudes 
 You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible 
 You never gonna fill in my shoes 
 The unforgettable truth is 
 I'm a beast when I get in this booth (Oh) 
 OK, OK, they know me, now don't they? I'm glad to say 
 Tech ain't need a track and turn me loose like J. Obama way 
 So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin' 
 I really get it crackin', never would've imagined, back when 
 I was on the block, I be rappin' 
 With one of the illest niggas to ever make it happen 
 I'm off to my zone, that's that fly zone 
 I don't give a damn about a hater, I'm goin' 
 Eyes on the motherfuckin' prize and 
 I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne 
 B. Hood, full effect strange, you digging it? 
 We living it up, man, it's all about the bigger shit 
 Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feeling it 
 Why would anybody wanna do it any different? 
 I think I fit this track so perfect 
 Tecca Nina gave me a chance and I deserve it 
 I been putting in my work in, cutting it like a surgeon 
 Urgin my people to rebel like an insurgent 
 I grab my sword and shield, jump in the field 
 To feel my enemy's pain, the look in his eyes, surprised 
 Realized denied by the stand up guy 
 You don't really want it with me, please don't try 
 (Wait a minute, aren't you that Romanian guy?) 
 Damn right, dirty, you can bet your life 
 And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice 
 So leave it like I see until my afterlife 
 If this is wrong, then I can't be right 
 They wanted me dead, but I stayed alive 
 Enemies who post like my favorite five 
 I'm dropping at 'em, then I wave bye bye 
 I'm off my noodle, ain't I? 
 And my secret ain't mine, gotta play fight 
 Ain't white, hate night in the daylight 
 You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain, right? 
 So please proceed with caution, and just don't speak too loud 
 'Cause they go headhunting, in the Mississippi you found 
 They say I'm far out, I'm a giant in this large crowd 
 Get the fire with my heart out 
 I feel your hatred like the far south 
 See the truth is everybody wants the money 
 But they faking it to make it if you pay attention 
 Look at the way I'm coming out the middle of the map 
 And attacking the track with the ways of a gremlin 
 Sim-sim-salabim, that don't mean anything 
 But I can make it mean get alotta green 
 And make everybody to get up and sing with the Nin 
 I'm a menace, they wanna put the Nina in guiness 
 'Cause I'm in the percentage of killers who finish 
 Any nigga without a limit, they get it 'cause I'm sinister 
 This ain't a gimmick when I rip it and damage your mimica 
 I be like a meteorite, I'm blazing everything 
 In my way so quick, you hear my humming 
 But the scientists gotta get multi-million 
 Dollar machinery for me just to see me coming 
 I'm far out, look at the people with the eye of an eagle 
 Tech, now look at the steeple 
 It's Tecca Nina and Beasel coming to defeat and 
 Diminish an evil, hit you with the strength of a Diesel 
 I - fifth street to Grain Valley, Spain to Cali 
 Can't hang if you ain't strange, nigga, bang bang, you in pain alley 
 Another dimension, you better repent 
 And you never ever let a nigga discover the tension 
 I gotta sever the punk, another was sent in to Allah 
 Given away today, but the lynchin's tomorrow 
 Potato, [open up a barrel?], I pop it 
 And have a motherfucker living in peril 
 I damage a devil, never doin' it for [dinero?] 
 Taken out of his body like a nigga's on Cuervo 
 Tecca Nina gets colder with them 
 That'll mean everyone of the whores kissed him 
 On the tip of this big one 
 Dig it because I'm truly beyond the solar system
