Posse in effect, scramble up, new rhyme 
 Big Goretex, crushed down, two time 
 Rumble in the street, neighborhood shakedown 
 Emerald City posse, gonna take this town 
 Suckers gettin' mad, swift kick, broke rib 
 Serve it in a dish, name it up, rib-tip 
 Metal in the front, big stomp, crush neck 
 Punks on tip, call the boots, GoreTex 
 Laugh if you want, but you might get crushed 
 Walk through the dangerous Hilltop brush 
 Bullet-proof, steel-toed, down to kick butt 
 Roughin' up character who drop weak cuts 
 One twenty five was the price tag on 'em 
 Cool brothers buy 'em, even though they don't want 'em 
 Style is a must, but the style is rough 
 China Beach boots couldn't crush more stuff 
 Strap 'em down, lace 'em up, get in the bucket 
 Reach for the tongue, pull it out, then tuck it 
 Ten pound boots could destruct all comers 
 My whole posse wears them Fort Lewis runners 
 Death to a white pair of nikes - sound effect 
 Kickin' over big motor bikes - sound effect 
 Steppin' over puddles in the hood - sound effect 
 Girls laugh, but you know they look good - sound effect 
 Waffle-like prints in the snow - sound effect 
 Pulverize punks when we throw - sound effect 
 Salute to the group in the booths - sound effect 
 Bow, and we kick you in the snoot - GoreTex 
 Hollow-point nine, to the boots, ricochet 
 Leavin' mud prints when I romp in the rain 
 Draw black scars on the new gym floor 
 Pimps like to wear 'em when they kick them whores 
 This is it baby, big shiny black boots 
 Runnin' over punks like Iranian troops 
 Trample, crush, hittin' like a dump truck 
 Jump in my face and a size twelve get stuck 
 In your butt, 'cause you wanted to box 
 One-two punch and the GoreTex drops 
 On your toe, your brother got caught 
 By GoreTex boots from the GoreTex shop 
 Git it!
