I'm peelin' off domes with a baseball bat 
 Forty-four Magnum, choice of gat 
 Mercury tip fillin' up my clip, I can shoot him 
 In the dome or I can get him in the hip 
 But boom, look at all the niggaz runnin' out the room 
 Just another soldier, causin' doom, no, I don't bang 
 But I like to wound my enemy, who is the enemy? 
 I'm glad you asked any motherfucker standin' in my path 
 Got a Bentley Turbo, now you wanna jack 
 But remember, Mack Daddy is strapped 
 And when your platinum niggaz start dissin' 
 Record companies think you're missin' 
 But I'm back, I'm back 
 I'm back and I got a bigger gat 
 Now the positive rhymes is on 
 And I'm positively hittin' that dome 
 You might want mine but you can't get mine 
 Rather put a hot nine right up in your behind 
 I'm not the nigga that you wanna recoup 
 And I don't wear a Giorgio suit 
 But I'm down for my business so please don't step 
 You heard about my law firm's rep, I check my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, checkin' my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, ah I checks my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, straight checkin' my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash money 
 In the magazine I look like a dope, man 
 'Cause I'm paid and I'm suckin' up to no man 
 And in the rap game, I gets no respect 
 'Cause I'm checkin' more bank than the heat check 
 Yeah, I'm a pimp and my hoe is the system 
 Uncle Sam might think I just dissed him 
 But nah, I'm just pumpin' straight facts 
 You either be a mack or you get macked 
 Some of the jealous wanna roll on the boss 
 But this HK's keepin' 'em tossed 
 'Cause I duck them deuce, deuce treys 
 At point blank range, attitudes get changed 
 I'm about making these dividends 
 And every motherfucker ain't my friend 
 And I check my back when I count my snaps 
 And niggaz that snatch get slapped 
 Girls wanna roll, that's cool 
 But I'm not to be played that fool 
 Some niggaz think a brother with money is slippin' 
 But I've be down, so quit trippin' 
 My goal to increase the size of this bank 
 I hold and bring up the brothers whose down 
 To roll and keep all the shit under my control 
 That's how I'm livin', I check my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, checkin' my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, ah I checks my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Boom, here I am, rich, straight checkin' my bank 
 Cash money, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash money 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Clockin' more dollars than Chase Manhattan 
 Cash money, cash, cash money 
 Clockin' more dollars than Chase Manhattan 
 I check my bank, come on punish 
 Cash money 
 A word to the cops, I can't be stopped 
 A word to my enemies, I don't drop props 
 A word to the Klan, I don't pick crops 
 You can run up with your whip 
 But you'll just run up and get popped 
 A word to the Tipper, rap won't fall 
 A word to the bourgeoisie, fuck all y'all 
 A word to Apartheid, you 'bouts to fall 
 You can kill a couple brothers but you'll never get us all 
 Straight laced game's what I'm poppin' at the new jacks 
 Mack Daddy, niggaz like to snatch fat sacks 
 I used to be nice with my rhymes and now I drop dimes 
 What's the time? 
 It's time to get paid in the nine-two G 
 Recession never stopped a nigga like me 
 I'm breakin' no laws but I'm livin' on edge 
 Puttin' CEO's to bed 
 Business straight yankin' in dead presidents 
 It's like sellin' dope, but the money ain't bent 
 The game is stiff, but I'ma get mine 
 My set is a dollar sign, I check my bank 
 Yup, checkin' my bank, fool, ha, ha 
 Yup, I check my bank, shit 
 Straight checkin' my bank 
 Come on, punish, punish 'em, punish 'em 
 Show these DJ's what time it is 
 Punish peace out y'all, and I'm checkin' my bank 
 I checks my bank, I checks my bank, straight paid clown 
 Checkin' my bank, I checks my bank
