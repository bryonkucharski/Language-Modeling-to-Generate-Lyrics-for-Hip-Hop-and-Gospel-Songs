Beavis: 
 "Whoa! Butt-Head, check it out! It's a monster! It's like, Frankenstein!" 
 Butt-Head: 
 "This monster is not human! It feels no pain! It can't be reasoned with!" 
 Beavis: 
 "Yeah! Yeah! And he's really horny, too!" 
 Butt-Head: 
 "That's cool!" 
 Riggidy-run for the hills 'cause the mack is back 
 I'm hookin' up girls by fax 
 If you're stacked 
 You can rub a big mack 
 I gotta gas 
 So don't worry about scraps (No no) 
 Five-foot-eleven with a seven-foot game 
 Got a big mouthpiece and I shows no shame 
 Monster kinky have no morals 
 Monster love to get oral (ummmm!) 
 Got ten cars and the girls like that 
 I was born and bred to be a mack 
 "What's your sign?" is played 
 You gotta put a little style in your game nowadays 
 In the sixties, girls was all high 
 LSD had 'em givin' up thighs 
 The baby boom was on and I dropped 
 No more Woodstock, but now you got Mix-A-Lot 
 So put me in your CD changer 
 Watch your girl, 'cause Mix'll rearrange her 
 Ooh, he's sexist! 
 Ooh, he's sexist! 
 Keepin' Rush Limbaugh restless 
 I'm da mack and that's monsta 
 Straight chase girls through the tail 'cause I wants ta 
 You can call it wack 
 But you respect this black 
 When it comes to game I'm a monsta mack 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 I'm a monsta mack 
 Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Strike the pose 
 But she ain't nasty as me 
 'Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky 
 Can't stop tappin' that tweety 
 Give it to the needy 
 Nope, 'cause I'm too damn greedy 
 Here I go walking through the mall 
 Don't play ball 
 But I got game for 'em all 
 Focus on a victim, focus on a victim 
 Mr. Richard is hot, so let's sic 'em 
 And like a Tomahawk jumpin' on a SCUD 
 Girl, you got to gimme my pud 
 The pick-up king is back, buddy 
 Tryin' to give lessons to these thick-ass ballers and understudies 
 But I'm not tryin' to call you no bitch, girl 
 Don't give a damn if you're poor or rich, girl 
 And we can play a li'l pool 
 And I'm pokin' that 8-ball cool 
 And the booties 
 I still like the booties 
 She got a little waist, doin' squats just to keep me on my duty 
 Giant-size game's what I'm droppin' 
 Straight freaks with them thick ol' glutes is what I'm knockin' 
 Now the right-wing wanna test me 
 If likin' sex is a crime, then you arrest me 
 But don't tell me who to sing to, Jack 
 Cause a third of your life is in the sack 
 I'm a monsta mack 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 I'm a monsta mack 
 Lookin' for sex 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Lookin' for sex 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Drivin' my car by the bus stop 
 Till I spot a young cutie straight suckin' down a soda pop 
 Baby girl's winkin' 
 Mix-A-Lot's thinkin' 
 Hope this girl's feet ain't stinkin' 
 Here we go 
 Swingin' by Franglor's 
 And get a little soul food 
 Now you got a brother in the mood 
 Damn, gotta get her home with the quickness 
 'Cause this thickness, boy, you oughta witness 
 No need to put my girls on tilt 
 'Cause straight-up game'll get you milked 
 The nasty dog is back 
 With straight pimp game black 
 Ain't no shame 
 I'm a monsta mack 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Monsta mack, fool! 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 I'm the monsta mack! 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough 
 Monsta mack, wit' big game, baby! 
 'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
