The Mack Daddy, rippin up skirts in the back of Caddies 
 If +Baby Got Back+ then baby can have me 
 Controversy made them ban me, understand me 
 Girls, bringin' many problems to my world 
 Tryin' to make Mix pay for them pearls 
 One had a baby and it's a girl *baby giggling* 
 I swore I had protection, got an erection 
 Must resist temptation 
 Girls flock, ride my jock 
 'Cause a big fat Porsche went around the block (mmm) 
 Met a young girl named Angel 
 She had a big long weave I'd love to mangle 
 So I'm puttin' in work, lovin' tight skirts 
 So you know a mack poppa gotta flirt (woo!) 
 Room triple deuced me and baby got loose 
 Look at baby wiggle that big caboose 
 Got a little tiny waist, everything's in place 
 I'm pacin', facin the situation 
 It's on, put it on tape, troop 
 Got a little sex now I'm sittin' on a lawsuit 
 Nine months later, little baby pops out 
 Blonde hair, blue eyes, with her feets in her mouth 
 Well that can't be me (nope) 
 'Cause I'm a nappy haired black man, dressed like a O.G. 
 Angel's gold diggin, this girl's driven 
 Tryin' to catch Mix on slippin 
 Just because I get paid don't mean I get played 
 For the bank I've made 
 And after the blood test I got proof 
 Your baby is cute ... but don't call me Da Da! 
 <Da Da Da> 
 <Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <D-Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da! 
 <Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <Da Da Da> 
 <Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 The next story, met a young skirt, said her name was Laurie 
 Smoked much dank, but her life was boring 
 Got with Mix, now she adores me 
 Nasty nigga named Mix (yep) 
 On a tour bus with the porno flicks (mm) 
 Anxious 'cause I want to knock boots 
 And I don't sleep with the girls in my group 
 So Mack Daddy is strollin and patrollin 
 Big fat bank I'm holdin' 
 Bus pulls up to the mini mart 
 And that's where Laurie works and my game starts 
 Laurie knows nothin' bout rap though 
 And that peeled my superstar cap, so 
 I'll just go back to the basics 
 And even that game is stiff, baby, face it 
 So now Laurie and me is headed to the ?monkey dope? 
 Straight gettin' to the ?monkey poke? 
 Dip dip dip, one two three 
 *She moans* 'Cause I'm a vet'ran, see 
 I kissed her cheek while Laurie was asleep 
 Let one more groupie use me (mm) 
 One year later she's tryin' to creep 
 On my money 
 But I ain't the one to get played the sap (uh-uh) 
 When I hit the sack, big Richard is capped 
 Your man's a punk for leavin' kids with you 
 The baby's cute, but don't call me Da Da! 
 <D-Da Da Da> 
 <D-Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <D-Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da! 
 <Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <Da Da Da> 
 <Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 I'm sittin', in Long Beach Cali, eatin Popeyes' chicken 
 Thinkin' 'bout the next snake charmer I'm hittin 
 Met a fly skirt, nickname was Kitten 
 And I start spittin', 
 WhassUP with the brother in the passenger seat? 
 Homeboy bailed 'cause his game was weak 
 And he was callin her bitch, I was callin her baby 
 He got the finger, I got the lady 
 Me and Kitten left the place quickened (yep) 
 Busta, you and cousin Kitten need a stickin 
 To the 'tel, to the 'tel, to the 'tel we rush 
 (Gasp) The jimmy-hat bust 
 I start sweatin, conscience bettin 
 That I'ma have to deal with bed wettin 
 But I'ma handle this thing like a man 
 Settle down and bring the kid up, that's the plan 
 Three weeks later I get this call though 
 Kitten sounds happy on the telephone 
 She said "Go on and live your life, bro, 
 'Cause EPT said no," so don't call me Da Da! 
 <D-Da Da Da> 
 <D-Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <D-Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da! 
 <Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <Da Da Da> 
 <Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da! 
 <D-Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <D-Da Da Da> 
 Da da! 
 <Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da! I ain't yo daddy, baby! 
 <D-Da Da Da> <Dad-dy> 
 <Da Da Da> Da Da! 
 <Da Da Da Da Da Da> 
 Don't call me Da Da!
