How you like your game, baby? 
 You wanna sell hot? 
 I make this game resonate baby, yeah resonate 
 C'mon c'mon 
 I put the ball in balla I made it resonate 
 I put the pop in these girls and made 'em shake 
 I put the b in the game and kept it true 
 No cock blockin' this game for you 
 New star, big cars, some of this game with a big cigar 
 Cashmeire, cat fat, six foot broads standin' on stacks 
 I understand, no plan, you stole my banner, southern 'bama 
 Sellin lies when you was dumb and broke 
 You never had a topknot, joke! 
 It was the shit you spoke 
 No rhythm in your spittin' 
 I don't need no bling things to make my game swing 
 Your game is runnin' tight but your motor pings 
 I make it resonate 
 You drive a nice truck, Escallade 
 Gotta show 'em all you're paid 
 But the truth is you're lackin' what you're mackin' if you're paper fed 
 Your payins last to fuck 'em 
 If you're broke then can you trust 'em 
 Give her diamonds and a beeper but you can't keep her 
 She gets the benefits 
 Go on, girl, treat that man like a bitch! 
 Takin' from the rich, Robin Hood 
 Get it back to your crib 
 Another rap star slaving to this game he claim he's saving 
 Cut his legs when he's shaving 'cause he bitch made 
 I make it resonate 
 I make it resonate 
 Rap's first super-balla 
 Yeah, before y'all could spell balla, I was ballin', fool 
 Blew 15 large in the 80's, nickrally 
 You work a max scheme, clean 
 Bought her that Lexus, bought it in Texas 
 Just like Dada bought you a mansion in Nevada 
 Situation bleak, your girl got a new physique 
 You got a baby comin', wife naggin, bought a Taurus station wagon 
 Aha! Put 'em on the glass and made your ass a balla! 
 Now you got a naggin' wifey and a toddler, ahah! 
 Don't wanna be a playa no more? 
 Mack with your mouth and match your dollas 
 I swing a mean verb, big word, some if this game you've heard 
 I gotta hear it, your appearance shakin' Daddy's lyrics 
 I ain't an OG, I'm an OP, original player 
 Papi gran-D, I signed your wife's booty, remember me?! 
 Chorus till end
