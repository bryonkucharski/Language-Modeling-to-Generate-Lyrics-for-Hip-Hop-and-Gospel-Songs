 Brothers, we've messed over our sisters for years 
 (Years and years) 
 I said for years 
 But now we're being messed over 
 I said now we're being messed over 
 You done fell in love with the cat 
 You know what I'm talking about "The Cat" 
 It'll get ya 
 *RAP* 
 Meow, meow, the cat will get ya 
 If you let it get wit' ya 
 Some brothers wanna spend alotta money 
 Just to get a little honey 
 But the honey gets runny when the money's funny 
 'Cause I'm hipped an' a brother like Mix don't slip 
 'Cause them girls will put that cat right on ya 
 And don't say I didn't warn ya 
 Go down to the beach 
 See the girls in bikini's 
 Wonder why you don't see me, brothers (Yeah) 
 Should I preach (Preach, preach) 
 Awreit, back to the beach 
 A O.G. from the hood 
 Went down to the beach but his game was weak 
 Met a sweet thing named Yolanda 
 She had the go mo-mo's on her brand new Honda 
 So my boy stepped up with a gangsta pitch 
 Better come on an' get wit' dis 
 A forty-dog in his hand and he's saggin' 
 But pretty soon the cat's goan tag him 
 Later that night, Yolanda got busy in the back 
 Of his big black Cadillac 
 The next day, the O.G. wasn't playin' no ball 
 'Cause he took her to the mall 
 Buyin' everything from skirts to boots 
 Oh, speakin' a boots, yeah he knocked 'er boots 
 But in the end another fool got jack 
 'Cause he was sprung on the cat 
 Sprung on the cat, check it out 
 There's a brother named Dave in a Corvette 
 Had a job at the U.P.S. 
 I ain't dissin' 'cause U.P.S. pays money 
 But Dave wants to kick it with the honeys, huh 
 He shoulda got 'em a girl 'n' settle down 
 But Dave wants to get around 
 Put the top down on the 'vette 
 Hit the south side of Seattle 
 Lookin' for sex 
 Got a full pack of Seagrams under the seat 
 And boom, there it is... three freaks 
 Thick, walkin' with a natural switch 
 And Dave starts getting that itch, huh 
 You know a 'vettes only got two seats 
 But Dave wasn't listening to me 
 All three of them jumped in the car 
 Hit Red Lobster and went straight to the bar 
 But them drinks ain't cheap out there son 
 Five dollars for one of them daiquiris 
 And Dave was treatin' 
 And the girls was sure 'nuff eatin' 
 Two hundred dollars worth of fish 
 And Dave wants to make a little wish 
 A little something that he'd seen in a porno movie 
 Play BBD and said do me 
 At Daves house they left him in a cold sweat 
 He gave 'em the keys to the 'vette 
 Ooh, that's the wrong move, black 
 You must be sprung on the cat 
 Sprung on the cat 
 Sprung on the cat 
 Old girl named Joyce tried to put that cat on me two weeks ago 
 You mean she DID put that cat on you, you're talkin' to 
 Attitude, be straight with me man 
 I'm cruisin incognito 
 850i with the smoked out windows 
 An' I'm thinkin' I'm raw 
 When it comes to girls I done seen it all 
 Then along came a girl named Joyce 
 She had a black Corniche Rolls Royce 
 At the stop sign she did something with her tongue 
 Could Mix be sprung? 
 Her cat was calling me 
 And I started rolling slowly 
 Pulled up to the bumper 
 'Cause I wants to thump her 
 So she pulls up into Texaco 
 And I roll up slow and jump in the Rolls 
 Now I'm checkin' out the body 
 This hotty gotta body 'n' I wanna get naughty 
 Followed her to the motel 
 Yes, motel, I'm too cheap for a hotel 
 Room deuce deuce deuce and it's time to get loose 
 I dipped in the juice 
 So what's up with the Rolls 
 Checked the registration 
 And the Rolls was stole 
 Baby girl tried to break with my keys and gat 
 But I ain't sprung on the cat 
 Don't pet the cat, if you just met the cat 
 If you're sprung on the cat 
 You might as well eat the cat 
 Sprung on the cat 
 Sprung on the cat 
 Maharaji over there all quiet 
 I think Maharaji be eatin' the cat 
 How 'bout Attitude Adjuster 
 Attitude, you eatin' the cat or what? 
 I think it's Critical Mass 
 Critical Mass be suckin' on that cat 
 Yo, P.L.B. I know you eatin' somethin' 
 ME? What you snackin' on??
