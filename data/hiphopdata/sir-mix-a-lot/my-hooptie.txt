My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin' 
 Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin' 
 Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin' 
 One hubcap 'cause three got stolen 
 Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin' 
 Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin' 
 Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug 
 He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug 
 Runnin', movin' tabs expired 
 Girlies tryin' to dis 'n' say my car looks tired 
 Hit my brakes, out slid skittles 
 Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle 
 Who's car is it? Posse won't say 
 We all play it off when you look our way 
 Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block 
 Gotta roll this bucket, 'cause my Benz is in the shop 
 My hooptie - my hooptie 
 Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck 
 Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck 
 Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin' 
 Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin' 
 Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep 
 Cars barely movin', but now we got heat 
 Made a left turn as I watched in fright 
 My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight 
 She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes 
 Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes 
 Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin' 
 We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin' 
 Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous 
 The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us 
 Hit a side street and what did we find? 
 Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign 
 Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse 
 Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt 
 Homey got scared, so I got on 
 Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong 
 Posse moved north, headin for the CD 
 Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me 
 Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight 
 Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right 
 Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded 
 This is what I sport when you call me big-headed 
 I pot-hole crusher, red light rusher 
 Musher of a brother 'cause I'm plowin' over suckers 
 In a hooptie 
 It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper 
 Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er 
 Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft 
 Some get bold, but some get smashed 
 Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen 
 It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions 
 Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned 
 (Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a u-turn 
 Spotted this freak with immense posterior 
 Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area 
 Brother start lettin' off, kickin' that racket 
 Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets 
 I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject 
 Hit I-5 with the dope cassette 
 Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope 
 The tape deck broke 
 Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex 
 Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex 
 Found a little club called the N-C-O 
 Military, competition. You know. 
 I ain't really fazed, 'cause I pop much game 
 Rolled up tough, 'cause I got much fame 
 "How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot" 
 "Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock" 
 Ooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing 
 Runnin' that game with the home made slang 
 Baby got ished, Bremelo gip. 
 Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped 
 By a hooptie 
 Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic 
 Far left lane, throwin' up much static 
 Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot 
 "Whatcha want me to do Mix?" 
 Push freak, push 
 Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters 
 Cars dip low with hard core brothers 
 Tank on E, pulled into Arco 
 Cops on tip for Columbian cargo 
 We fit a stereotype, that's what he said 
 Big long car, four big black heads 
 Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators 
 'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nothin' like Noriega 
 Cop took my wallet, looked at my license 
 His partner said "Damn, they all look like Tyson" 
 Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go 
 This bucket ain't rollin' in snow 
 It's my hooptie
