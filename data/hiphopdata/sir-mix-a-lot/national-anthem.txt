Huey B. Newton shot in cold blood in west Oakland 
 Oliver North receives community service hours 
 For selling weapons to known terrorists 
 Tawana was brutally raped, but two fools said she did it to herself 
 A six hundred million dollar stealth bomber fails to fly successfully 
 And you say I should be proud of this song 
 Think about it AMERICA! 
 I'm living like hell in a world of death 
 Protectors of the people wear bullet-proof vests 
 Your little nephew, flipped him a Uzi 
 Took to the streets, shot 'em up and then "Who me?" 
 Locked in a trunk by Republican villains 
 Pinstripe suits, experts at killin' 
 Civil war, but some want out 
 Trapped in a box called the ghetto we shout 
 Headin' for the strip 'cause the squares ain't hip 
 Sell a couple keys, make the home boys trip 
 The president is a dope man's friend 
 The governments strong but the dope got in 
 Punish the accused, but the trial was short 
 A black man's dogged in a all white court 
 The jury dismissed, prosecutor says, "Can em" 
 Now I'm ashamed of my national anthem 
 The pentagon had a plan for a rescue 
 They said intelligence never makes miscues 
 The thirty-first was a day of death 
 Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, you know the rest 
 No negotiations with a terrorist force 
 But Iran's still buzzin' offa Oliver North 
 The Ayatollah's dead but the hearts not gone 
 The burning of the flag in Iran goes on 
 Anti-American, we're loved by few 
 We pay big money to the ones that do 
 The christian militia, they give us big knowledge 
 But the pentagon messed up and wouldn't acknowledge 
 Ollie took orders from the number one man 
 But the crap hit the fan and superiors ran 
 Democrats tripped, the committee said can em 
 Now I'm ashamed of my national anthem 
 Am I a communist? No. But my brain ain't slow 
 Not long ago, Mix-a-Lot was po' 
 Never helped out by the ones with clout 
 I was mad at the world 'cause I felt left out 
 Stealin' hub caps, stereos, anything to get paid 
 I realize I'm a modern day slave 
 Posse downtown, the sight was set 
 I saw my home boys mother with a buggy and a bag 
 People walk by, laughin' at poverty 
 I looked in her face and I soon saw me 
 College educated, but she can't get a job 
 The American Dream once again got robbed 
 Vietnam vets on the street, that's a shame 
 Fight for the man, and the man plays games 
 Dogged by the hippies, dope smokin' critics 
 You blame it on the soldier, but your government did it 
 My national anthem 
 My national anthem 
 You gonna teach me now about the care and feedin' of politicians 
 Bolivia, Columbia, the CIA 
 Any similarities, I won't say 
 But the dope gets in, uncut like P-Funk 
 Headin' over borders in a scent-free trunk 
 Coffee over dope, but the dog can't sniff it 
 Remember that lady that was broke, she's widdit 
 Started with a key, clocked 17 G's 
 Then got another shipment, pure D 
 Headin' for Brumlen, the money was betta 
 Rollin' in a Porsche, in a cashmere sweater 
 Crime, revenge, I'm tellin' you this 
 The people that laugh are the people that knows 
 Her community complained, callin' the police 
 But where was the community when she was in the street 
 Dope's comin' in, it's killin' 'em at random 
 And I'm ashamed of my national anthem 
 My national anthem 
 My national anthem 
 My national anthem 
 I'm ashamed of my national anthem
