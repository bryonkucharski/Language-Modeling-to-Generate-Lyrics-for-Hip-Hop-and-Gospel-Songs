 Mack Daddy 
 Ain't you tired of that gameless mark smackin' you in your face baby? 
 Mack Daddy 
 You better roll with the big mack, the man with the game 
 Mack Daddy 
 Gotta big snake, all you gotta do is make it dance, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Mack Daddy 
 *RAP* 
 I'm rollin' to another neighborhood 
 Me 'n' my boyz, up to no good 
 Chasin' miniskirts 'n' the ride is packed 
 Rollin' to a mall called SeaTac 
 Cruisin' 'n' the cops don't like that 
 'Round the mall once 'n' don't come back 
 Four-door Rolls with the black exterior 
 Turbo Bentley, white interior 
 A Rolls Royce fulla big black men 
 In the suburbs, messin' with citizens 
 Walkin' in the mall, looka how I spit 
 Sloppy dressed brothers make the females blitz 
 Big long starters, black low tops 
 Mack daddy hat got me lookin' like Pops 
 But that's cool, 'cause, I'm mackin' anyway 
 'N your females my prey 
 'N I'm callin' out skirts like Chuck D 
 Sista we missed ya, get wit' me 
 Comin', runnin', your boyfriends gunnin' 
 The big boss is so cunnin' 
 Some of my home boys hate me 
 They get a microphone, then try to take me 
 But you ain't slip, sayin' what's up Mix? 
 Boy I'm hip to your tricks 
 I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Mack Daddy 
 Yeah ain't no reason to bet ya 
 'Cause I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Steadily mackin' 
 Mack Daddy 
 Kickin' in a buffed up Lamborgini 
 If your females proper she gots to see me 
 'Cause I'm the king of the roll outs 
 Mack Daddy is back still runnin' my mouth 
 I see a freak on the SeaTac strip 
 My Lamborgini's brakes get grip 
 So I pull up on to The Spot 
 I start frontin', 'cause I wanna get jocked 
 Topped off the gas, whipped out my cash 
 'N one girls starts to laugh 
 But I'm still smooth 
 'N my game is on, so I make my move 
 Say, you in the white pants 
 I'm a step close to ya, but I won't dance 
 'N what you laughin' at 
 All the girls start pointin' at my hat 
 'N I'm a giggle wit' 'em, 'cause I just wanna get wit' 'em 
 I don't hit 'em, I just wanna stick 'em 
 So I pull baby girl to the side 
 She said she likes my car 
 I said take a ride 
 So we flipped up the doors on the Contach 
 But gettin' in a Lamborgini is hard 
 So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end 
 I thought she might need help gettin' in 
 So I clos' the do' 
 'N now you know' 
 Mack Daddy is about to sco' 
 The girl said, baby you can have me 
 So I stopped at the tail 
 'Cause I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Mack Daddy 
 All you all gameless marks know 
 Mack Daddy 
 I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Mack Daddy 
 Yew 
 I don't smoke no weed, but I like to G 
 I don't mean O.G., I mean sex baby 
 'Cause a brother like me don't date 
 I sling records 'n' tapes 
 The Rhyme Cartel with the Def American 
 Gettin' brothers sprung like Farrakhan 
 'N I'm stuffin' my ladies pumps 
 In the backa my Benz I humps 
 I'm nasty 'n' proud 
 To hell with cool, I'm G'in' 'em loud 
 Other people at the hotel gets no rest 
 'Cause Mixalots bumpin' them headrests 
 She got booty for days 
 Other brothers is pullin' up 
 But she ain't phased 
 'Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab 
 She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have 
 Rollin', showin' her off 
 'N some fool tried to call me soft 
 He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy 
 A old superfly mack daddy 
 So my girl stepped out 'n' he tried to mack 
 But she ain't havin' that 
 You see your game is weak, G 
 My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin' 
 'N rappin' 
 Mack Daddy 
 I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Mack Daddy 
 I'm the Mack Daddy 
 Mack Daddy 
 Come over here and get some of this snake 
 Mack Daddy 
 I'm the Mack Daddy
