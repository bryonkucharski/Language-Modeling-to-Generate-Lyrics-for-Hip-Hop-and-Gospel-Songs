 Big man is back, oh no, it's a brand new flow 
 Lettin' you Jakes and females know 
 Ain't a damn thing changed and I still got dough 
 Still gettin' watched by Po-Po 
 You know what a flow like, never grab a ol' mic 
 Never been down wit the slow life 
 Baby, I'm a low life, lookin' for the right type 
 To get it goin' on for the whole night 
 King of the backside, look at my rep 
 One of these West Coast veterans 
 Known to lay bone and make miniskirts moan 
 Young hotty got me sittin' like stone 
 So, I'm at the Magic City 
 So many freaks in one spot, I'm dizzy 
 I'm a playa, so you know I wanna play 
 It ain't nothin' like the city Blacklanta, GA 
 Now, I start lookin' through the mist 
 Swangin' my game like this 
 Wassup wit the table poppin'? 
 Fine, 5 feet, 9 inches and I'm jockin' 
 But the girl won't dance 
 And I pinch me a 10, 'bout to wet my pants 
 She got body fo' days but the girl won't flaunt it 
 You betta bark like you want it 
 Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby 
 Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

 Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby 
 Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby 
 Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby 
 Bow wow, bow wow, gimme my dog chow 
 Put me on a leash or else I'm gonna have to snap now 
 Humpin' yo' leg, this doggy don't beg 
 Got a tight rubber cap on my head 
 So, check this game when I'm comin' through the hood 
 Swingin' 'round blocks but I don't sell goods 
 Mad brothas mean mug 'cause they wish they would 
 Get a fine thang like I could 
 You bought a 6-4 wit the 3-wheel mo' 
 Got no females in ya passenger door 
 You wanna playa hate 'cause you just don't know 
 'Bout the fast track makin' yo hoe go 
 Damn baby, why don't you let me ride witchu? Here I go again 
 Done took yo' girl 'cause I don't like men 
 Got to the crib, romance don't phase me 
 Pulled to the house playin', freak me baby 
 Video check 1-2, 1-2 
 Me and baby girl's 'bout to get loose 
 And just when I thought I could palm it 
 You betta drop to yo' knees and bark like you want it 
 Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby 
 Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby 
 Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby
