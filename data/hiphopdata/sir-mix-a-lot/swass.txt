Get busy! 
 Sir Mix-A-Lot bread the ultimate freak 
 So cute in a suit, my beats can see 
 Intelligent freak, wardrobe complete 
 You can fold my robe, if you be my freak 
 I got a big Cadillac with the bass in the back 
 Try to take my freak, boy you must be whack 
 Bicep's flex, so kiss my neck 
 Buying pounds of gold with royalty checks 
 And I'm Swass ... 
 Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass) 
 Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass) 
 Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass) 
 Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me 
 Gold gettin' live in a fresh fruit vest 
 I'm the king of the beat in the Great northwest 
 Packin more dollars than chase Manhattan 
 A, after eaten sure my billfold fatten, yeah 
 Yep, my phone be ringin' like you wish yours would 
 But my girl stays cool 'cause she looks so good 
 Punk motherfucker... call me weak 
 Just turn up the bass and feel this beat 
 Feel my bass drum ... 
 (Break) 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass") - 4X 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass") - backwards - 4X 
 Now the ground be shakin, when my bass drum's breakin 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass") 
 Suckers in the crowd think the boy be fakin 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass" - backwards) 
 Now put this beat in your Nissan truck 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass") 
 But don't start cryin when your woofers get stuck 
 ("Stop it, get silly, swass" - backwards) 
 Check it out ... 
 (*Solo of the beat*) 
 Hit bigger! 
 I done 23 points when I count my bank 
 All imitators I will spank 
 I'm a freak and I know it, so why not show it 
 I design my rhymes like a worldwide poet 
 NEW freaks every week in my contract 
 So cold with the rap you'll get contact 
 Innovative beats with a brand new twist 
 Don't you wish your man could rock like this 
 Break it down ... 
 Eighty dollar slippers to wash my car 
 It attracts more freaks than a beach lifeguard 
 Ah, imitate me and you'll bring about pain 
 Better wear dark shades when you look at my chain 
 Swass, point, no introduction 
 I come complete with freak instructions 
 I work for myself don't have no boss 
 Boy you gotta have brains if you wanna be swass 
 And I'm swass ... 
 (Interlude - Female talking) 
 Oh Mix-A-Lot you know I want to, 
 Oh Mix-A-Lot you know I like you (backwards) - 4X
