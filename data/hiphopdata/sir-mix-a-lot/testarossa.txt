I'm your Testarosa. First gear 
 Watch me go, keep 'em in fear 
 Rumble, young man rumble 
 Brother won't fumble, muthafukas just crumble 
 Gaskets crank, rappers get spank 
 Stripes get yank, a superior rank 
 Won't stop the jock in some American car use a lyrical radar 
 But I'm rolling, the cartel's tolling 
 For the D's keep folding 
 Most Cadillac rappers get look and disturb 
 By the jet black blur 
 Me, the Testarosa running like it suppose ta 
 Don't try to get closer 
 Cause you might get lost in the dual exhaust 
 Don't ever try to fuck wit' a boss 
 High octane there ain't no ping 
 When I swing on a lyrical speed king 
 And that's just first gear, listen for the upshift 
 Who can get wit' this 
 I'm your testarosa 
 Second gear, look it here queer 
 I'm in here, hitting like spears 
 The rhyme cartel slings legalized dope 
 Some cope, others get (gunshot noises) 
 Lost on the boss, it's finish is flawless 
 12 cylinders listen to the horses 
 It accelerates smooth 
 Move or else get move 
 Run for cover my brother, suckers are getting smothered 
 I ?cutted? you other ?smutters? rammed in the gutter 
 My rep is kept, muthafukas must step 
 The best get swept and let out to rest 
 Huuuu, look at that air intake 
 Second gear, passing fakes 
 Revolution per lyric get higher 
 How can I chill when my rhyme's on fire 
 As I approach the end of my tach 
 My lyrical horse power blows to the max 
 Red line is reached to the peak of my speech 
 And I told ya, I'm your Testarosa 
 Testarosa 
 Gear number three, get off the clutch and don't let 'em up 
 Keep 'em all down on these young bucks 
 Let 'em know big boss is just a bit quicker 
 Get the picture 
 Backtalk tolerated none, son 
 Left you at the gun when I hit gear one 
 Now I'm in third and you think that's quick 
 Huh, wait till I hit fifth 
 Me and my pack, we keep plenty of snackpacks 
 You said fat now I'm yo to the max 
 Want Mix-A-Lot for your next attack 
 Hey, yo, critical mass, yeah, I got your gat 
 Two hundred sixty pounds of pure pain 
 Critical mass is my homeboy's name 
 My personal trainer, taking weight gainer 
 Got the bulk to crush and contain ya 
 On the tach, I'm like a wind ax 
 Cutting up air like Boeings aircraft 
 Time to shift and let my lyrical seatbelt hold ya 
 I'm your Testarosa 
 Up to fourth gear, the speed increase 
 Police got beef wit the word chief 
 Move or lose, I excuse the wack dudes 
 You light my fuse and clear out or get used 
 I go 100 in a 55 
 No need to lip synch, I'm straight out live 
 So I'm rough lust who wanna be tough 
 You fuss and cuss wearing that Raider's stuff 
 Fake fools from around the way 
 Knowing damn well, you ain't from LA 
 Ashamed where you come from son, so you rattle 
 Like it or not, I scream straight up Seattle 
 Rip up streets wit a lyrical sweet 
 Don't peep or creep or you lose your freak 
 The cam's growl, engine loud 
 My tongue keep beating 'em down 
 Rev it up, get ready for fifth 
 Just hit 'em wit a maximum dis 
 I roll ya, fold ya, mold ya, I told ya I control ya 
 And I'm your Testarosa 
 I'm your Testarosa 
 Yo Punish, show 'em what time it is 
 Gear number five, you're eyes get wide 
 So realize that I survive and I rhyme for mine 
 I rope the dope and is he coming up, nope 
 I ain't the joke so don't hope for my throat 
 There it is, the whiz gets his 
 The word quiz is what it is and Mix don't give 
 Sight to the wack who act like Max 
 And try to jack a pop rap to hit the map 
 That ain't like me, it ain't cool 
 To rob another fool them claim you rule 
 You boot but not me, troops, you like juice 
 So you hit the stage wearing my boots 
 Uh, uh cupcake, I ain't about to get rape by fake 
 Just look at the tail light shrink and then think 
 How I left you pink in a lyrical kink 
 Time to drop to my gears and then stop 
 'Cause I lock the box on them clowns that jock 
 Turbo cone is 230 up on ya 
 I'm your Testarosa
