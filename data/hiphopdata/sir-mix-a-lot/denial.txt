You are my only daughter, I guess I made you twice 
 You look inside my other, he'll give you bad advice 
 I will tell you I'm OK, but deep inside I'm afraid 
 I don't drink holy water, I'm not a son of Christ 
 I ain't no black messiah, and I don't load my dice 
 You can tell me you're all right, but why you so afraid? 
 You're in denial, you never will believe it's you 
 Denial, you always hide behind the truth 
 You'll never believe it, you never believe it's you 
 I don't think I'm amazing, in fact I'm quite insane 
 To live inside my bucket, with all my plastic chains 
 People tell me every time, I look at the wrong all right 
 You're in denial, you never will believe it's you 
 Denial, you always hide behind the truth 
 You'll never believe it, you never believe it's you 
 You'll never believe it, you never believe it 
 Secrets told you, dreamland holds you, secrets told you 
 You wouldn't believe it, you couldn't conceive it 
 Secrets told you 
 You wanna receive it, you gotta believe it's you 
 You're on a trip already, I'm tripping out alright 
 I'll get there slow and steady, just sit and hold on tight 
 Denial, you never will believe it's you 
 Denial, you always hide behind the truth 
 Denial, you never will believe it's you 
 Denial, you always hide behind the truth, yeah, yeah 
 Behind the truth, yeah, yeah 
 It's true, yeah, yeah 
 Behind the truth, yeah, yeah 
 It's you, yeah, yeah 
 Behind the truth, yeah, yeah 
 It's gonna be alright, just hold on tight 
 It's gonna be alright, just hold on tight
