My Posse's On Broad Way 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 Me and Kid Sensation, at home away from home 
 In the Black Benz Limo with the Cellular Phone 
 I'm callin up the Posse, It's time to get drippin 
 I'm freakin each sunroof, to keep ya suckers trippin' 
 Everybody's lookin', if your jealous, turn around 
 The amg kit keep us closer to the ground 
 We gettin' good grip from the 50 series (gator back) tires 
 The Alpine bumpin, but I need the volume higher 
 Cause the 808 Kickdrum, makes the girlies get dumb 
 We're rollin' Rainier and the jealous wanna get some 
 Everytime we do this, Sucker MC's wanna battle 
 I'm the Man they love to hate, The JR Ewing of Seattle 
 Pickup the posse on 23rd and Jackson 
 Headin for the strip, yes were lookin' for some action 
 The Limo's kinda crowded the whole car was leanin back 
 Maharji's watchin TV with 2 girlies on his lap 
 On Martin Luther King, the set looks kinda dead 
 We need a new street, So Posse move ahead 
 We all look kinda suave, the crew you can't forget 
 The Mix A Lot Posse, cold rippin up the set 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 Posse Up 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 A Rollin' in my Posse was gettin' kinda board 
 There's not another Posse with More Points scored 
 We don't walk around like criminals 
 Or flex like big gorillas 
 My homeboy Kid Sensation 
 Is the Teen-Aged lady killer Maharaji's on the def side 
 Dancin like a freak 
 The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak 
 Larry is the white guy, people think he's funny 
 A real estate investor who makes a lot of money 
 Clockin lotsa dollars, we all got gold 
 Crusin in his Benz, and got no place to go 
 Wheelin 23rd, we saw nothin' but thugs 
 The girlies was to skinny from smokin' all them drugs 
 Cause the Rockman got 'em and there butts just droped 
 The freaks looked a depressed because our Benz won't stop 
 At 23rd and Union the driver broke left 
 Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def 
 My girl blew me a kiss, She said I was the best 
 She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress 
 OR she's lookin' at me freaky and she's getting undressed) (Godzilla remix) 
 The closer that we get the crazier we feel 
 My Posses on Broadway it's time to get ill 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 My Posse's On Broad Way 
 Posse Up 
 Crusin Broadway and wheels spin slow 
 Rollin' with your posse is the only way to go 
 The girlies by the college were lookin' for a ride 
 We tried to pick 'em up but we had no room inside 
 We put 'em on the trunk, we put 'em on the hood 
 Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good 
 The posse's gettin' bigger there's much to many freaks 
 My mufflers draggin, my suspension gettin' weak 
 Now the freaks are gettin' hungry, and Mix A lot's treatin 
 We stopped at taco bell for some Mexican eatin 
 But taco bell was closed the girls were on my tip 
 They said go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dicks 
 Dick's is the place where the cool hang out 
 The swass like to play 
 And the rich flaunt clout 
 Posse to the burger stand? so big we walk in 2's 
 Were gettin' dirty looks from those other sucker crews 
 Kid Sensation droped a 20 and didn't even miss it 
 Skeeser from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it 
 Her boyfriends illin he went to slap her face 
 My homeboy PLB Cold sprayed the boy with mace 
 'Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl 
 If ya don't have game then let her leave you world 
 We took his girl with us with him she rode the bus 
 She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss 
 Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch of dudes 
 Your broke cold cryin about the Rockman blues 
 Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset 
 She's with the Mix A lot Posse on the Broadway Set
