I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket 
 I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy 
 Keep all them squares from round me, Master P boy is you 'bout it 
 Roll past, came back around, they like Chief Sosa you clowning 
 Eat all the green it's so clean hoes think we downy 
 I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning 
 Ay, I'm so damn ignorant I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing 
 My wrist look like pee 
 My name is Keef 
 Roll it up and chief the weed 
 I'm so high I don't know my damn A-B-C's 
 Count it out like one two three 
 Four five six no these not G's 
 These hundred thousands bitch it's legal 
 Now my doors go up I remember stealing regals 
 I'm counting cash no I'm not sleeping 
 I ain't sleeping till two weeks from next week 
 This hoe gone fuck me 'cause my tweet 
 And I only tweeted if she wife she get a treat 
 I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket 
 I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy 
 Keep all them squares from round me, Master P boy is you 'bout it 
 Roll past, came back around, they like Chief Sosa you clowning 
 Eat all the green it's so clean hoes think we downy 
 I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning 
 Ay, I'm so damn ignorant I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing 
 I pulled out my dick and I pee'd 
 In public, I don't care no fuck who sees 
 My watch blinging it is freezing 
 It's the reason why I ain't hiding this heater 
 I put the money with the money let it sing 
 Sosa T-Pain let me buy you a drink 
 I ain't got to talk I hit her with that wink 
 Then she start telling me her favorite color's pink 
 When I was young my mom told me to go hard 
 Now I am dancing with the stars 
 I bought a lion then I turned it to a rug 
 I bought a bear and I mixed it with some fox 
 It's the reason why my leather is so soft 
 I got python all up on my drawers 
 I got satin all on my fucking sheets 
 Diamonds in my Glo man no Jesus piece 
 I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket 
 I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy 
 Keep all them squares from round me, Master P boy is you 'bout it 
 Roll past, came back around, they like Chief Sosa you clowning 
 Eat all the green it's so clean hoes think we downy 
 I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning 
 Ay, I'm so damn ignorant I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing
