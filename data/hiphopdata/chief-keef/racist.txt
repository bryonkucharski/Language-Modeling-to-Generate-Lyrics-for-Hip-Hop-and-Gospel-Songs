I put big ass rims on my car 
 Money long, this shit going too far 
 I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car 
 I told them bitches, "bitch I'm freaking you tomorrow" 
 Police pulled me over they thought I was racing 
 I told 'em my car ain't with the damn pacing 
 Got my guns from Indiana think they with the Pacers
