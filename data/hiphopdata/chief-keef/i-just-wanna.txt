These bitches want my money, I won't give it 
 These bitches fronting, they just want your money 
 Yeah, I see you bitches on the come up (I see ya) 
 I see these bitches on the come up (I see ya) 
 See these bitches on the come up 
 Always into something crazy 
 Uh uh, don't care who you fucking lately 
 Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it 
 Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it 
 Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana 
 All I wanna, smoke some weed and get some commas 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys 
 I'm on a green diet, I don't want no French fries 
 I just wanna get by, I just wanna get high 
 I just wanna get a cake, I just wanna get pie 
 I just wanna live my life, I just wanna rock my ice 
 I just wanna fucking shine, I be glowing all the time 
 Smoking ganja, counting commas 
 Fucking thotties, I probably fucked yo momma 
 Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya 
 If your dumbass try running, then them bullets run for ya 
 'Cause I be minding my business, I love money and THC 
 Who the fuck just hopped out with that rock on, that's Keef Jay-Z 
 Me baby, all I know is eat baby, all I know is eat baby 
 All I know is top baby, all I know is freak baby 
 Now what you wanna? What you tryna do baby? 
 Say you coming through, who with you? 
 Okay cool baby, it's cool baby 
 It's me and my jewels and the crew baby, and the goo baby 
 You was talking nonsense I was through baby 
 I hop in, in my car, vroom, vroom baby 
 You crazy 
 Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it 
 Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it 
 Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana 
 All I want to, smoke some weed and get some commas 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys 
 I'm on a green diet, I don't want no French fries 
 It's just me, myself and money (all this money) 
 Don't need nothing else 
 I don't need nobody (need nobody) 
 Don't even trust myself 
 Swear I need some fucking help 
 Doing drugs to numb myself 
 Rolling blunts and popping pills 
 That Molotov, that bomb for real 
 I'm nodding off, unconscious 
 Wake up nauseous, god damn alcoholic 
 Pulling ten grand out my wallet 
 Know they 'bout to judge me 
 I been sitting at the crib, I'm sick of counting money 
 Bored of being rich as fuck, tried every single drug 
 It's not exciting anymore once that first million come 
 I got my business up, now I just don't give a fuck 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 (Get faded every day of my life 
 Getting laid every night, like) 
 I just wanna 
 (Sip liquor, I'm a sinner 
 Take a picture, remember tonight) 
 I just wanna (another car) 
 I just wanna (a couple bars) 
 (I just wanna get faded, with some of the greatest 
 I don't care who the fuck you are 
 I still ride around with 
 Every single motherfucking homie I been down with 
 They keep me grounded, smoking on the loudest 
 Neighbors telling us to turn it down 
 Shut your mouth bitch 
 Shut your, shut your mouth bitch 
 I just bought two houses 
 Just spent two years of your salary on this outfit 
 Ain't no way around it 
 On the phone with my accountant 
 It feels good to be this wealthy and well rounded 
 We got you surrounded) 
 Ganja, counting commas 
 Fucking thotties, I probably fucked your momma 
 Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya 
 If your dumbass try running, then them bullets run for ya 
 'Cause I... I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna 
 I just wanna
