I was on my way to go and get some money 
 The clouds gon' red Be-fore I get some money 
 I'm riding in my 2 door, running from cops, I'm by my lonely 
 You see how I shine, boy just tell me how bad you want it 
 I'm like "Go and get that sack!" 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack 
 You see I'm getting the cash, go get a sack, why is you mad? 
 I'm riding in foreign's they mad, I'm in the mansion, where you live at? 
 Put the guns in the bag, weed in the blunt, blunt I'm my hand 
 Cash up in my pants, getting the top, fucking a bitch 
 I'm so fly, bitch I'm so high, I got jet-lag 
 I walk in the store, spending the cash, flappin' them bands 
 Member sellin' rocks, now I'm the man, I'm on demand 
 Pull up to the light, fexlin' a lot, what is you in? 
 I'm sipin' the lean, smoking the dope, don't do the xan's 
 They like "Why you running so slow? On a tight rope, and how did you win?" 
 I tell 'em "I'm glo, I got the dope when my slow was fast" 
 Cookin' the swag, leave it to me, I be the man 
 I was on my way to go and get some money 
 The clouds gon' red Be-fore I get some money 
 I'm riding in my 2 door, running from cops, I'm by my lonely 
 You see how I shine, boy just tell me how bad you want it 
 I'm like "Go and get that sack!" 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack 
 Coulda bought me a boat, but I ate it, like what is you on? 
 I'm not driving slow, driving so fast, like where is you going? 
 They like, you got the cash, you got the swag, but where is you going? 
 I'm from Chiraq, but if you make it out, then you won 
 Don't wanna fuck the hoe, make them mow my lawn 
 I won't look at the hoe, but made her do my laundry 
 I know I got a maid, but my maid is gone 
 She don't speak Ingles, bitch my maid is foreign 
 I was on my way to go and get some money 
 The clouds gon' red Be-fore I get some money 
 I'm riding in my 2 door, running from cops, I'm by my lonely 
 You see how I shine, boy just tell me how bad you want it 
 I'm like "Go and get that sack!" 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack, go and get that sack 
 Go and get that sack
