Green light, green light 
 Green light, green light, green light 
 Girl you know I get that yellow light, yea that slow money 
 Yellow bitch, bright white snow bunny 
 Bang, Bang! Bang! 
 Green light, green light 
 I mixed it up, at first it was clean sprite 
 Yea I get that green light, go money 
 Girl you know I get that yellow light, yea that slow money 
 Yea I get that green light, green light 
 I get stop sign money, kill you 'bout my money 
 Green light, green light, green light 
 Yea I get that green light money 
 I was ridin' with my beam 
 Going fast, I done spilled the lean 
 Syrup like some Redbull, I think I got wings 
 Then I pop a flat, bitch this coffee got the cream 
 I pull up on yo block everybody wanna greet 
 I hop up out the car, everybody want to meet Chief Keef 
 But do you got the cheese, do you got the fees 
 Knock you out, sting like a bumble bee 
 Mike Tyson (Bang! Bang!) 
 Countin' on this white man 
 His bitch gave me head and I liked it, Katy Perry 
 Got milk?, bitch I'm a dairy 
 You be telling tales, you's a fairy 
 Green light, green light 
 I mixed it up, at first it was clean sprite 
 Yea I get that green light, go money 
 Girl you know I get that yellow light, yea that slow money 
 Yea I get that green light, green light 
 I get stop sign money, kill you 'bout my money

 Bad bitches on me, ughhhh you after me 
 Dope got me coughin', ughhhh it's nasty 
 'Cause you ain't getting money 
 Whaah, you mad at me 
 When the money call gone (Let's get it) 
 At the yellow light I never go slow (Let's get it) 
 At the red light I run fuck the po's (Let's get it) 
 Yeah you damn right, I don't care if they pull me over 
 I hit the club fuck the line, bitch I'm Chief Diddy 
 Blackhawks pride, got the Chiefs with me 
 Boy you you know these hoes ain't loyal, think I got CB with me 
 I be eatin' all day, I got my teeth with me 
 Green light, green light 
 I mixed it up, at first it was clean sprite 
 Yea I get that green light, go money 
 Girl you know I get that yellow light, yea that slow money 
 Yea I get that green light, green light 
 I get stop sign money, kill you 'bout my money 
 Green light, green light, green light
