I got shows I got verses, I got numbers 
 I got bitches, I got niggas, they be on it 
 I got money, I got guns, I got ganja 
 I got drink, I got commas, I got karma 
 I got volcanoes, don't got Benihanas 
 I got cars, I got cribs, I be fleein' 
 Don't give a fuck about him, I do me 
 Don't give a fuck about them, I be T'd 
 I be T'd from my fee, to my jeans, to my wrist 
 From the bling on my rep to the bling in my ear 
 And the bling on my neck, try'na take it got a Tec 
 Got a Mac, go burrrat, leave you wet, stankin' ass 
 I don't sell PTs, bitch, I sell shine 
 Fuck with me and you'll be gloin' all the time 
 Too much ice in my watch, I can't tell the time 
 I tried to tell the time and that shit made me blind 
 I got a 40, got a 4-5., got a 9 
 I hop out with the 9., I'mma rock star divin' 
 You better takin' swimmin' classes or you'll be dyin' 
 After I take you out that flour, you'll be fryin' 
 I got shoes, I got verses, I got numbers 
 I got bitches, I got niggas, they be on it 
 I got money, I got guns, I got ganja 
 I got drink, I got commas, I got karma 
 I got volcanoes, don't got Benihanas 
 I got cars, I got cribs, I be fleein' 
 Don't give a fuck about him, I do me 
 Don't give a fuck about them, I be T'd 
 I be T'D, I be T'D, countin' G's smokin' B's with my Bs' 
 Out in Cali fuckin' with the C's and the B's 
 Chiraq ass niggas sting like a bumblebee 
 Soon as I pull off, police start followin' me 
 Soon as I hopped out the car, your bitch start talkin' to me 
 You ain't tryna give me top?, Bitch, don't talk to me 
 I be hoppin' in my car, she be tryna walk with me 
 I count the money with no finger tips, lift me up, bang this shit 
 Google this shit, Yahoo the shit 
 Tell me what you think, read that shit 
 You steady talkin' cash money, me I don't believe this shit 
 I be walkin' 'round with money, you know I T'd with it 
 I got shoes, I got verses, I got numbers 
 I got bitches, I got niggas, they be on it 
 I got money, I got guns, I got ganja 
 I got drink, I got commas, I got karma 
 I got volcanoes, don't got Benihanas 
 I got cars, I got cribs, I be fleein' 
 Don't give a fuck about him, I do me 
 Don't give a fuck about them, I be T'd
