GG sports, it's in the game 
 Ain't no pillow talkers in the game 
 He's a dork, he's a lame 
 No you can't hang with the gang if you ain't gang 
 Boy, I know it, know it, know it 
 You ain't down like a fuckin' doormat 
 I'm ridin' 'round lookin' for the money 
 I hop out, I be gloin', gloin', gloin' 
 Ring, ring, what's on my line? 
 Girl, it's that, money, I swear it call all the time 
 Bang, bang! What's that? - My gun 
 I up this muthafuckin' blow it boy, better make it, run 
 Ding ding, what's that? A pizza pie? 
 If it's an enemy then I won't be surprised 
 Ding, ding, it's a friend in a disguise 
 Nigga act like they with you, they out to get you - ah 
 Smokin' on this chimney

 Walked up in the jewelry store, walk out like a damn mini freezer
