G-L-O G-A-N-G you know how we be 
 We be going wee 
 G-G-L-O you know we 
 Smokin' weed, I count cheese 
 Came through with that cash and that swag 
 Fuck a bag, put the racks in my pants 
 I went in Saks spent a sack 'cause I get it right back 
 Fuck your bitch give her back 'cause I get it like that 
 Came through with the hammer I don't dance 
 You want beef? I'ma turn you to a tranny 
 I don't wanna fuck your bitch, she want romance 
 I wanna fuck, don't wanna dance 
 I got a million in my pants now 
 I don't use no rubber bands now 
 Big bank take lil' bank, stand down 
 'Fore I pull the racks up out my pants now 
 I pulled up, million dollar cash down 
 'Cause I got that sack now 
 All I talk is racks, all I talk is cash now 
 You not flexin', sit your ass down 
 What is you, a class clown? 
 Only language that I speak is million dollars cash down 
 Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars 
 Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars 
 Pulled up, trunk bangin', car swangin', now we gangin', war gangin' 
 Excuse me, I mean that we're gangin' 
 You want me in your club, you gon' have to let the gang in 
 Look here, I'm very well respected in the streets 
 Hop out my Emmy, and my wrist we got a P 
 I smoke dope, you be smokin' wack reefer 
 All the loud I smoke you think I spent a million on this weed 
 Told that bitch you had to go it's time to eat 
 She thought she was T, but she we 
 When I say "T" that mean two turnt, that's how I be 
 You want a show, you better million dollar me 
 I pulled up, million dollar cash down 
 'Cause I got that sack now 
 All I talk is racks, all I talk is cash now 
 You not flexin', sit your ass down 
 What is you, a class clown? 
 Only language that I speak is million dollars cash down 
 Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars 
 Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars
