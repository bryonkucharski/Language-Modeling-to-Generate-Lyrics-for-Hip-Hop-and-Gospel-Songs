I be ballin', like I play for the Thunder 
 I was riding with his mama 
 Let her roll a blunt of ganja 
 She say I'm gnarly 
 Then I say cowabunga 
 I know why I love lil mama 
 See me pull up in that Tonka 
 I know I'm heavy like my ice 
 Got a lot of drink and ice 
 You say "Can you spend the night?" 
 No baby, that shit ain't right 
 She say "What's the hold up?" 
 I got these bands in my pants 
 I need hand on everything that I told ya 
 Money, get it up get it up get it up get it up 
 I smoke 93, you smoke 51 
 Pop out the truck, got the truck with the semi up 
 Lil nigga act up, Chief So hit 'em up 
 Snuck in the club with the snub, hit the DJ up 
 Made a million dollars from a motherfucking penny though 
 Pull us to the strip, hop out, what's the deal-io? 
 Fat ass Backwoods looking like a Philly Dog 
 Let his bitch hit the weed, she a silly hoe 
 She start talkin' about being in my video 
 Pull up like a video, pop me a wheelie though 
 She started screaming, I got me a silly hoe 
 I don't talk bands bitch, I talk millions 
 I can be outside in the bity like Diddy though 
 Bitch then say she love me, really though? 
 So she like me for me, but bitch it's really gwau- 
 I be ballin', like I play for the Thunder 
 I was riding with his mama 
 Let her roll a blunt of ganja 
 She say I'm gnarly 
 Then I say cowabunga 
 I know why I love lil mama 
 See me pull up in that Tonka 
 I know I'm heavy like my ice 
 Got a lot of drink and ice 
 You say "Can you spend the night?" 
 No baby, that shit ain't right 
 She say "What's the hold up?" 
 I got these bands in my pants 
 I need hand on everything that I told ya 
 Got the Ruger and the Ruger, hit your medulla up 
 Ain't gotta be on the radio, to turn it up 
 Pull to the party, know I'ma turn it up 
 When I start ballin', you know I'ma do it up 
 I was seeing so much money I done threw it up 
 Pull on a opp block, you know I blew it up 
 Came to the club, bitch you know that I'm toolied up 
 Dirty hoe act like she won't get her coochie up 
 Sosa Jefferson, bitch you know I'ma move it up 
 Hoes in all rooms, bitch you know that I'm bootied up 
 Ready for the war, I'm suited, I'm booted up 
 Bitch ain't tryna fuck, you know I root it up 
 I sip lean, nigga you can't brew it up 
 Don't like it too much if the shit ain't new enough 
 Say you got a background, fuck nigga pull it up 
 Talkin' bout war, on money I'm pulling up 
 I be ballin', like I play for the Thunder 
 I was riding with his mama 
 Let her roll a blunt of ganja 
 She say I'm gnarly 
 Then I say cowabunga 
 I know why I love lil mama 
 See me pull up in that Tonka 
 I know I'm heavy like my ice
