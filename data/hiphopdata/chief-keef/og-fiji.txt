I got that Fiji water, that OG 
 I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police 
 I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed 
 I got that Fiji water, and that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that OG, got that OG 
 I got that OG, I got that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG 
 Got that Fiji water and an O of skunk 
 Walk in the mall, pointin' like I know what I want 
 I walked on the lot, pointin' like I know where I'm goin' 
 I'm goin' to the spaceship, you should know where I'm goin' 
 Went up in the bank takin' out 50K 
 Walked in the bank smirking in the teller's face 
 I walked in the bank they say I smell like an 8th 
 I said I smoked a muthafuckin' 14th today 
 She say she want some cheese, but she won't get paid 
 I say go roll some weed, baby it's not laced 
 I'm smokin' OG up in my spaceship 
 He say he wanna race me, I'm nothin' to play with 
 I got that Fiji water, that OG 
 I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police 
 I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed 
 I got that Fiji water, and that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that OG, got that OG 
 I got that OG, I got that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG 
 I got Fiji water, OG, cops come, fuck that police 
 Bitches come, they want me, ask 'em, yeah they know me 
 On the lot I coped that foolish whip, I'm like Shawty Lo me 
 I pull off with that stupid whip, I'm like Tity Boi me 
 Cash on me, all me, big counts, only me 
 And Gambino he got my thing, and he gon' make it sing 
 I tell 'em "do it slowly", don't got no time for police 
 Hop in the car, we speedin', runnin' from the police 
 I'm in that thing with four seats, I ain't feel like two seats 
 All these bitches call me, ask me what I'm doin' 
 I lie and say I'mma call 'em back, I'm colder than my jewelry 
 All these bitches text my phone like "Sosa, how you doin'?" 
 I got that Fiji water, that OG 
 I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police 
 I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed 
 I got that Fiji water, and that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that OG, got that OG 
 I got that OG, I got that OG 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, Fiji water 
 I got that Fiji water, Fiji water 
 Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG
