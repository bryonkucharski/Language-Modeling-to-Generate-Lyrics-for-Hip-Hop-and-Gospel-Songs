My glove department filled with residue 
 Had to shit on you 'cause you thought you was cool 
 When I pull out them hundreds boy I'm blessin' dude 
 I got a hundred for you, you, and you 
 Hop out at the gas station 'cause I'm a star 
 Full tank 'cause I didn't even charge my car 
 I let the doors go up, then your bitch get in 
 She sees all this money, she say, "Chief Sosa you winnin'" 
 I rolled up 10 joints, I got weed for days 
 I got all this green I swear that it's my baby 
 I've been getting money since my senior days 
 But I forgot I didn't go to school I'm crazy 
 I put Margiela's on my fucking shoes 
 I poured 2 deuces nigga fuck some booze 
 I'm rollin' up 3 grams in the fuckin' wood 
 Don't worry 'bout me, I'm getting money I'm good 
 I pull up to the club and them doors go up 
 Motivation? No-you's only dumb fucks 
 Gotta use the shower, hella hundreds in the tub 
 The police can run in here, I don't give no fucks

 I got a million un-read texts 
 I got a million red text messages 
 I only read 'em if you're talkin' benji's 
 Can't be talking small, gotta be talkin' plenty 
 I got 6 hoes in 6 different beds 
 Dro and Mike told me I'm the black Elvis Presley 
 I got hoes in 50 different states 
 Been all around the world, can't tell me 'bout a penny 
 Member kickin' doors and hittin' stains 
 I'm eatin' good, fuck your Craig Jenny 
 For all you dumb ass fucks, I'm talkin' Jenny Craig 
 Try to make me go on a diet, pussy I ain't wit it 
 (Bang bang)
