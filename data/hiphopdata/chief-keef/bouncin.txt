Big rubber bands, I be poppin' 
 I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it 
 I talk all this shit 'cause I'm 'bout it 
 You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin' 
 Call me baghead Milonakis 
 All I get is bags, all I get is money 
 Smoking big Backwoods of that funky 
 I pull up, get that money then I'm bouncin' 
 I pull up hop out, I don't pop out 
 I got the cops out, it's hot out, I got Glocks out 
 I up this 40 Mayweather, it's a damn knock out 
 [Mumbles] I ain't make it in school, Chief So was a drop out 
 Something something something, I forgot now 
 I was thinking about the guap then put my guap out 
 I'm Sosa Ray Charles, you can still get knocked down 
 It's a parade here, all you see is Glock shells 
 I dress myself, bitch I don't need a stylist 
 I got my pistol just in case the violence 
 I think my chopper gay, I pulled him out the closet 
 I call my chopper Ye' 'cause he half went to college 
 I call my desert eagle "Desert Storm 'cause we be warrin' 
 I think my Mac wanna be a rapper, we be touring 
 Like Kobe, Shaq, D.Rose and Butler, we be ballin' 
 If you talking 'bout some millions, we be on it 
 Big rubber bands, I be poppin' 
 I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it 
 I talk all this shit 'cause I'm 'bout it 
 You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin' 
 Call me baghead Milonakis 
 All I get is bags, all I get is money 
 Smoking big Backwoods of that funky 
 I pull up, get that money then I'm bouncin' 
 I pull up, get that check then I'm in to win 
 I got two Glock forties, them be twenty twins 
 Don't wanna fuck your bitch, she got a shitty wig 
 Shot four out the thirty, we got twenty-six 
 Pulled up swagging, know you seeing this 
 Bitch came to my crib, you know she eatin' this 
 She can't have her phone, hoes be leaking shit 
 I'm an anti-ass nigga, I don't speak for shit 
 Chief So got over totin' llamas 
 I got a HK caliber, Da Forty 
 I wasn't good in science but I knew my numbers 
 I'm ballin' 
 Ring ring, tell your bitch stop callin' 
 Big rubber bands, I be poppin' 
 I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it 
 I talk all this shit 'cause I'm 'bout it 
 You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin'
