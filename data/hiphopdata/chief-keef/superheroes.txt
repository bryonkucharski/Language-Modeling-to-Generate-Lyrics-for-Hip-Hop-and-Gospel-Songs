By myself 'cause these niggas yes men 
 Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman 
 Know I got my Smith & Wesson 
 That be my illegal weapon 
 I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman 
 Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine 
 Come through yo' block like Green Goblin 
 Wetting shit up Spiderman 
 Come through your block, ay 
 Like Batman with a Glock, ay 
 Red beams on the gun bitch, Cyclops, ay 
 Wonder Woman, I name my watch, ay 
 I got my heat, I feel like He-Man 
 Bought sandman to the beach so bitch I'm Seaman, ay 
 I got a cold from all this ice man, ay 
 Don't make me flash my fuckin' pipe man, ay 
 I'm Spiderman, my oh got killed off white man 
 Come through your block, Star Wars with the shots 
 Daredevil with a cane 'cause I'm shootin' like I'm blind, ay 
 Smokin' Liu Kang kush, Sub-Zero, the whole nine, ay 
 Now I'm feelin' like I'm Walkin' Dead bitch, Sosa Rick Grimes 
 By myself 'cause these niggas yes men 
 Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman 
 Know I got my Smith & Wesson 
 That be my illegal weapon 
 I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman 
 Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine 
 Come through yo' block like Green Goblin 
 Wetting shit up Spiderman 
 Flacko order quarter coke straight from Sosa man 
 That's that soda, eyes the color of Coca-Cola cans 
 Green like Cloverland, everyday I'm blowin' grams 
 Everything is purple, yes I am the Joker then 
 Life's a game of poker, tell that nigga "show your hand" 
 I'm pullin' cards, I think it's time you niggas fold again 
 Told you soldiers with the scope I show attack 
 Told you, blow you, John Doe you then 
 Now nobody know the man, damn 
 From rippin' the Benz 
 Flippin' the rims, flippin' a fifth to a gram 
 Now I get in advance, I'm rich again 
 Switchin' more bitches in France 
 We ain't rapin' hoes, or we out here cookin', stealin' 
 You Captain Save-A-Hoe, nigga I'm the pussy villain 
 Spiderman, Peter Parker, I'm like Peter Pan 
 Treat my ops like Cyclops if I see the man 
 Wolverine in skinny jeans, diamonds Billy Jean 
 They tap dance, the Batman is a black man 
 By myself 'cause these niggas yes men 
 Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa Batman 
 Know I got my Smith & Wesson 
 That be my illegal weapon 
 I'm off this Earth I feel like Superman 
 Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine 
 Come through yo' block like Green Goblin 
 Wetting shit up Spiderman
