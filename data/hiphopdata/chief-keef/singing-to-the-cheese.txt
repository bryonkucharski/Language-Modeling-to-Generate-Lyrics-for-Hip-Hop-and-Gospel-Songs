Hopped on the road and let's go get that money 
 I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic 
 Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money? 
 You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s 
 I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed 
 I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's 
 I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's 
 Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese 
 Boy ya know, pissy wrist pissy throat

 My palm itching plenty guap get plenty o's 
 You think it's sweet them weapons I get plenty those

 Want some billions, don't want no friends 
 Want some weed, want some killers

 Don't be against me boy you better be with me 
 You better call the SWAT and they better come get me
