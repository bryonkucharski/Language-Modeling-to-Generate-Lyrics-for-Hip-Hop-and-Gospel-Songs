(Hook x2: Chief Keef) 
 Bitch I'm cooler then a cooler 
 Big shouts out to my jeweler 
 Hit a lick been rich ever since 
 Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor 
 These broke ass niggas need tune ups 
 I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah 
 Broke niggas we see right through ya 
 Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula 
 (Verse 1: Chief Keef) 
 Every time I look up my bitch starting some shit (Bitch) 
 Damn I hate a bitch that like to argue and shit (Bitch) 
 Got so much designer shit you'll think I model this shit (Sosa Baby) 
 There go the glory boyz again they popping bottles and shit 
 I say if you need a feature, homeboy hit up my line 
 I love when me and Ben Franklin be spending some time 
 Walk in the mall buy all the stores, bitch get on this ride 
 And if your boyfriend wanna be like me, tell him get on his grind 
 (Verse 2: Chief Keef) 
 Tadoe off the molly he retarded and shit 
 Take a look off in my closet lots of Robins and shit 
 And MJ bring the same shoes out, I'm still copping them shits 
 Bentley coupes and hummer trucks and raris and shit 
 I do this so Lolo won't have to worry again 
 And KayKay can be like pops and ride raris and shit 
 There go Chief Sosa, girl he ducking paparazzi again 
 You looking for me I'm in the woods with Holly in shit
