We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action 
 He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action 
 He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action 
 I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage 
 And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap 
 Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get that fast attraction 
 Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic 
 And where I'm that's 300, normal spelled backwards 
 Letting a nigga go on me, I can't imagine 
 But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic 
 My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it 
 My niggas do it for me, ain't no way around it 
 Blood hound for that money, bitch I gotta have it 
 Going crazy, 20's, 50's, 100's, bitch I'm cashing 
 And I ain't really with the talking, bitch I'm money stacking 
 And he ain't really bout' that life, 'cause he don't love that action 
 And they don't come from where I come from, they wasn't born a savage 
 Late night shit, catch him in traffic 
 I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic 
 And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin' 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action 
 He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action 
 I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage 
 And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap 
 Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get that fast attraction 
 Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic 
 And where I'm that's 300, normal spelled backwards 
 We don't really play, homie we about gun action 
 Pistols get to flappin', ball like the Mavericks 
 Chief Keef bitch I'm savage, I'm paper stackin' 
 Pistols get to clappin', niggas get to lappin' 
 Bad bitches packed up inside a Maxima 
 That bitch gon' give me neck, neck like a Dracula 
 Fuck nigga talk shit, delete him, no schedule 
 That bitch want some ransom, she say I'm handsome 
 I need me a dancer to come and dance up 
 On me while I'm wildin' and I'm throwing sets up 
 I need me a dancer to come and dance up 
 On me while I'm wildin' and throwing sets up 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action 
 He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic 
 We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action 
 I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage 
 And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap
