Bang bang 
 Gang gang 
 Bang bang 
 Gang gang 
 Bang bang 
 I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No matter what my friends say 
 I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt 
 I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone 
 Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead" 
 I was like, "He couldn't have had his head on" 
 I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything 
 Give me the chance then I'll head home 
 I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe 
 On the freeway I'm headin' home 
 I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi 
 Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties 
 We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis 
 Now only thing that I care about is breathing 
 Why I go hard, Blood be the reason 
 Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin' 
 Gotta take charge, every four seasons 
 Every month, every day and every weekend 
 I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No matter what my friends say 
 I bet you remember posted on the block 
 All we knew was shots 
 We ain't really know about the guap 
 All we knew was Glocks 
 I remember when you called my phone tweakin' 
 You got your first deal, you was geekin' 
 Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone 
 Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus 
 You was like, "Nah you're Almighty" 
 Almighty don't like nobody 
 Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40 
 Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning 
 God chose us, and gave it up 
 Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us 
 It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D 
 I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up 
 I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No matter what my friends say 
 No matter what I might say 
 No matter what you might say 
 No matter what I say 
 No matter what your friends say 
 No matter what our friends say 
 No matter what, what I say 
 No matter what, what I say 
 Just know this, I miss you Big Glo
