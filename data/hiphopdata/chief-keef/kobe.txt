(Hook: Chief Keef) 
 I been ballin' so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe 
 Young bull of this rap shit but I think that I'm Kobe 
 I swear I'm dunkin on these hoes on these niggas I'm free throwin' 
 These boys they don't like me 'cause I think that I'm Kobe 
 Watch me hit the strip club make it rain like I'm Kobe 
 Industry full of lames I play the game like I'm Kobe 
 And since I think I'm Kobe my bitch don't like to know me 
 This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe 
 (Verse 1: Chief Keef) 
 I say baby I got the racks she like you need to show me 
 She gon wanna blow me 'cause I ball like I'm Kobe 
 On my right wrist Versace on my left wrist a Rolly 
 I hold my Rolly up and now them bad bitches on me 
 I pull them hundreds out my right pocket fifties out my left 
 I'm ballin' like I'm Kobe I got plug with the ref 
 Watch me shoot this three, infirmaries, death 
 I got twenty seven more of them be courtesy shells 
 Since I signed with Jimmy Iovine I swear I think that I'm Kobe 
 You boys won't be like me and I think that you owe me 
 Since I signed with Jimmy Iovine I swear I think that I'm Kobe 
 You boys won't be like me and I think that you owe me 
 (Verse 2: Chief Keef) 
 Man I smoke so much dope I swear I think that I'm Smokey 
 Tadoe off that Molly and me I love smokin' 
 Hundred thousand in one pocket I get paid like I'm Kobe 
 When these fuck boys play games man I just play like I'm Kobe 
 My lil bitch just asked why I be stuntin so hard 
 'Cause them guns shoot one two one two ain't no stompin the yard 
 I want top in the car she say boy you goin' too far 
 I said I'm Kobe bitch don't act like you never done this before 
 I been ballin so damn hard I got them ugly faces 
 I'm so Nowitzki bitch I'm Kobe I got plug with the yay 
 I been ballin so damn hard I got them ugly faces 
 I'm so Nowitzki bitch I'm Kobe I got plug with the yay
