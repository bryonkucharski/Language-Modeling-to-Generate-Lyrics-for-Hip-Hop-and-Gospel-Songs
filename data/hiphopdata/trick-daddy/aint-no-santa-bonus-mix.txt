(Trick Daddy Talking) 
 Turn It up, Because I have something to say y'all 
 Y'all pay attention ova there Repersenting Page County 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Everybody doin' songs talking about what they gat 
 And they jewelry and they cars, 
 I want to talk about somethingwe never had shit, be real 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 And there damn sure ain't no Santa Clause because, 
 If it was like Santa what happen to Thingsgiving dinner 
 While y'all was dreaming of a white Christmas 
 I was out chillen wit my niggas out stealin trying to make a living 
 And if I robe for a million 
 I just hope god would forgive me after I spent it on his children 
 See I was born in da struggle 89 stepdaddy's me and my mother 
 And ten others, Lets see that's 3 sisters, 7 brothers 
 All we had was each other and I did 'cause I love'm 
 I never seen a flying raindeer so if rudoff called dawg 
 Ya'lljust tell him I ain't here, 
 And I ain't da grinch who like to stillChristmas, 
 But if you pay attenion there a lesson to learn just listin 
 See I beleave dat da children know our future but if you don't rise 
 Them right they'll grow up and shoot cha

 He never even hear them 
 Only HO HO HO, Is da Hoes I know 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 I was born amunch raseism, that's why the police hate me and I 
 Cam see it in their faces

 They wanna see me in jail hell 
 They can't wait to take me, 
 Wanna hog tie me and take my bar,

 If you know the moral to the words of this song, 
 What about the words of Rodney King "Can we all get along?", 
 Huh cause niggas just when I nervus back, 
 Matter fact sent them ova there where them terorist, 
 And they ain't coming back till Bin Loden 
 And all thoes fighters are found 
 Dead shoot up in the mountins of Airkida 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 Mr. President tell me why my people doin' bad 
 Some blacks wit no dads doin' bad shooting bad 
 And fo sho getting a limo got a wardrobe 
 I'm stuck wearing dis niggas clothes 
 Hell I go to school and dem teachers straight dog me 
 I try to learn but my brain just wont, I'm not dumb but mad 
 And sad which I should be, 
 You tryed framing me, I'm forced to live wit out a job 
 Or work at Mike D's or 
 I could robe circuit city and get 5 or 3, 
 Slanga kane its no thing but I'm scared to of tab, 
 And if you think I'm gonna change 
 Than cracker you can kiss my ass
