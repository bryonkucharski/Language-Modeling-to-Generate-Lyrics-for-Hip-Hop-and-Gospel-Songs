Man, this street don't remind y'all of Hollywood man 
 Damn, I miss my nigga man 
 That shit was gay how a nigga got killed dawg 
 Man, I wonder what he was thinking about man 
 My nigga, I know what he was thinking about dawg, I been there 
 I got word inside of me 
 My nigga I know exactly what he was thinking, my nigga 
 Sire, I got a problem, I wanna holla 
 "Holla nigga", I keep hearing sirens 
 In my sleep, I'm having flashbacks 
 A guilty conscious naw, "Why ya ask that?" 
 It's like this a nigga tried to cross me 
 I made him pay and now the devil calls me 
 But I ain't going 'cause I'm rolling with the Lord G 
 And now I lay my soul to sleep 
 Ah pow, keep hearing gunshots 
 Bullets flying, seem like they won't stop 
 A call for help, but momma can't hear me 
 Save me, damn this nigga, trying to kill me 
 I'm bleeding bad, this nigga started bustin' caps 
 I feel cold, boy, where them paramedics at? 
 The first stop is intensive care 
 I'm seeing tripletts, blood flying every where 
 I'm stone black, but who turned the lights out? 
 Holy sire, is it true I might die? 
 My blood's low, my heart's beating too slow 
 I'm on the edge but I can't let go 
 Is this the end, I would stop breathing? 
 Talk to me, why is everybody leaving? 
 Hold up wait, take these covers off my damn face 
 Looking like it's gonna be a long day 
 What time is it? What's the days date? 
 What brings the crowd, oh, why these long faces? 
 I'm getting kissed but why on my forehead? 
 Pretty flowers, don't tell me that a nigga dead fuck 
 Oh my, why all a sudden me, fuck it, I wanna be free 
 Free to fly with the birds and now the sad words 
 Past the dust, the last words that I heard 
 Lower the casket, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
