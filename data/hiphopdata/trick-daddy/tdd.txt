 Machine: 
 You call has been properly delivered, but the party you just reached does not answer... 
 Unless you're calling about getting that paper, stacking those chips or gettinh your motherfucking hustle on. 
 If it's none of the above, please hang up, and don't try again. 
 Kiki: 
 What the fuck? 
 Machine: 
 Bitch, you heard me. Please hang up, and don't try again. 
 Kiki: 
 Fuck you bitch. 
 Machine: 
 No, Fuck you. 
 Kiki: 
 Why the fuck is you arguing with me? You ain't real... 
 Machine: 
 Realer than you bitch... Please, do not call Trick Daddy's phone. 
 Hang up, and don't try again. 
 Kiki:
