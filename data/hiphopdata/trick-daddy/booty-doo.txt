 I like 'em tall dark, skin, thick and fine ass 
 Nice around, pants size 7, 8 or 9 
 And when she walk, she walk like she on the run way 
 And the paparazzi taken pictures of that booty 
 And when them flashes go to flashin' she go to shaking that ass 
 Faster and faster, big ol' ass just clapping 
 And when they put her song on it's like 'Girls gone Wild' 
 'Cause she the headliner and the girl poor and proud 
 But if they break it down she'll slow it down 
 And look back at it dat's if she's a real vet wit it 
 But she gotta have hips wit it 
 And know that one flat ass can make a whole clique look bad 
 To all you li'l booty bitches eat ya biscuits 
 Get thicker bitches, I know some niggas wanna fuck wit cha 
 But it's plain and simple they like 'em thicker 
 A lil' bit bigger like to tussle wit 'em 'fore they hit' em

 Go put yo clothes on 'cause ya comin' wit my crew 
 Oh, you a big girl, I just love when them thighs loose 
 No time to fuck around it's goin' down in my room 
 A whole thang of ice 5th of brown and a thang of goose 
 Man, call trick and tell them niggas to bring the juice 
 And a couple more boxes of rubbers 'cause she the truth 
 I'm sayin' she a bad ass bitch and she'll prove it 
 Ass and some fat ass titties, yeah, they juicy 
 Dancin' just like one of them bitches that make movies 
 Bust my nut quick she was ready to take boosie 
 She bent over and told him she want it in her booty 
 Big fine work it right on time wit the music 
 Make a nigga spend his last dime on that coochie 
 A you know how she do it Chanel, Prada or Gucci 
 Super fire rough bitch make a nigga nut quick shit

 She gotta tattoo of a kitten by her cat 
 And a pair of paws runnin' down the side of her draws 
 She from the tri-state dawg and she done tried it all 
 She so fine you mash rewind and nigga press pause 
 But let a play be a playa bout' it 
 Shackle handcuff her da sucker, hell give that girl some love 
 But not you ya like it when her booty do 
 She like it too and likes what it do to you 
 She playin' her mind games, flirtin' wit you havin' conversations 
 While she playin' wit her tongue ring 
 She lookin' mean in the low cut fitted jeans 
 The finest thing you ever seen wearin' a belly chain 
 Plus her man, he gettin' a lil' change doin' illegal things 
 And she expect for you to buy her things 
 They say money can't buy you love 
 And it's funny 'cause money damn sho' can buy you her
