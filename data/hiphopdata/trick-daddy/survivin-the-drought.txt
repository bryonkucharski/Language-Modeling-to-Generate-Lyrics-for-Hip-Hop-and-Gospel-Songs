Last year was a great year, ask the click 
 But this year was scarred to our last half of brick 
 Trying to survive in the drought where it ain't no blow 
 It ain't no [Incomprehensible] so with ain't no dough 
 Yo 95 south sun roof moonlight 
 Po-pos tight down before the turnpike 
 The last lick went sour Fed's jammed the blow 
 But like a weather man it's a light chance of snow 
 Lay low at the bottom at the tell 
 Wait patient for my Haitian to hit me on the cell 
 'Cause my Haitian cartel they always work 
 They even had shit when the Cubans were hurt 
 My nigga hit back he ain't got no coke 
 He said the coast guard just knocked off the boat 
 He said them Fed's in Texas they out of control 
 Knocking off major bricks with the border patrol 
 A nigga couldn't rap long 'cause the phones they be wired up 
 I be goddamned the whole East coast dried up 
 A nigga went from raw dope to cheap base 
 Ridin' 'round with the block Fed in the brief case 
 Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow 
 It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough 
 It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food 
 So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do? 
 Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow 
 It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough 
 It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food 
 So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do? 
 In the drought I look the dope fiend right in the grill 
 Slang him a Asprin or a vitamin pill 
 In the drought niggaz panic when that money stop 
 Start slinging wamis and them dummy blocks 
 Hit the projects twurking in that 87 fleet drop 
 Set up shop with a 9 pack of sheet rock 
 Watcha a nigga get hot, now he wanna hit pop 
 He wanna brain wrestle he don't know I got my shit cocked 
 'Cause in the drought you get stuck like a thumb tack 
 Dixie man got a 20 pack worth of come back 
 A player fucked up till that drought go down 
 A nigga got to spread his hustle when the drought come 'round 
 I'm stuck a player fucked up now I'm finna come back up 
 It's back on with then pack playboy the blow flooded 
 The base heads happy and my workers show love it 
 My dog hit the lick about two hundred birds 
 Off a Bahamian cruise ship that nigga got nerves 
 Now Cubans is beeping and the Haitians is calling 
 I'm back to slanging whole chickens popping cases and balling 
 I got to put the team on so I'm looking them up 
 RJ he the chef, he be cooking them up, hookin' them up 
 While I'm whipping 'em, flipping breaking 'em down 
 With the straight razor chipping 'em 
 We got 'em harder than hard plus we pitching soft ball 
 Jumping for that how high this year gone cost y'all 
 Since we the only niggaz wit it 
 It's the lick of a life time 
 Coming up in the drought through the paroofeal pipe line 
 This time I'm gone sit on me 'bout ten 
 'Cause you never know when that drought coming again 
 Surviving in the drought, surviving in the drought 
 Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow 
 It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough 
 It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food 
 So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do? 
 Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow 
 It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough 
 It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food 
 So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
