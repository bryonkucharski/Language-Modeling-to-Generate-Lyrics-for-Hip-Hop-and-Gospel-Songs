 Mystikal: 
 Say dog I smoke that, I smoke chronic, you need to stop 
 I tryin' to stop smokin', smokin', smokin' 
 I tryin' to stop smokin', but naw I don't think so 
 I tryin' to stop smokin' (I'm tryin'), 
 Smokin' (I'm tryin'), smokin' (I'm tryin') 
 I tryin' to stop smokin', but naw I don't think so 
 Verse 1: (Trick Daddy) 
 This time I had to get physical, 
 So I went and got that nigga (MYSTIKAL) 
 He was like (hombre), I say I got pounds in this bitch to blow 
 Smoke like it's yo's, nigga we'll go get some mo' 
 I know this dread named Fred next do' and I'm hitting' his ho 
 Got damn it, I'm BLOWED 
 Behind the wheel and I can't even see the road 
 Done smoked fo' Joe's and got three mo' already rolled 
 I shouldn't drive my shit when I'm high, I might tear it up 
 Shit got my eyes all red up, nigga can't even hold they head up 
 Got my brain waves, elevating in a daze 
 But I ain't afraid 'cause I now see life from so many ways 
 Done smoked up so many j's 
 Been high for so many days 
 So many ??? broke down and we roll with brown weed for days, hay, hay 
 Chorus (repeat 4x) 
 I'm tryin' to stop smokin' (I'm tryin'), 
 Smokin' (I'm tryin'), smokin' (I'm tryin') 
 I'm tryin' to stop smokin', but naw I don't think so 
 (Train effects) 
 Verse 2: Mystikal 
 I be puffing like a choo-choo train 
 Nigga with the bonafied smokers on my team 
 I got the urge for light green, 
 The same way a fiend crave for ice cream 
 Smoke that, what track that, shit we ain't rollin' to be looking at 
 So much smoke becoming out the window 
 Bitches in the next car saying daddy what that 
 We be smoking on the green, 
 Give me fifty dollar ??? I be coming in the hood 
 But you ain't got to worry 'bout catching no motherfucking headache 
 Under stress I be smoking on the good shit 
 No matter where I'm at, in a ride or at home in the studio writing 
 Hold ya breathe if you can't take it, 
 'Cause if ya with me and I got motherfucker I'm lightin' 
 Not trying to say I'm no hype, 
 But after killing 'gars then I know I be tight 
 And I been smoking all motherfucking day 
 And I'm bout to smoking for the rest of the night 
 That's why my chest be hurting and I sleep so much 
 And I can't remember shit 
 I went to the emergency room already, I think I better quit 
 Chorus (repeat 4x) 
 Mystikal and Trick Daddy: (talking) 
 Chorus comes back in till fade
