(Trick Daddy - Intro:) 
 You lookin' real good baby 
 Yes you is 
 I just want you to know 
 I had a wonderful time this evening 
 But unfortunately 
 I guess this part of the story 
 Well we tell each other good night 
 Nah how about this? 
 How about I break all the rules? 
 And tell you what I really been thinkin' 
 (Jaheim:) 
 Girl you got the big ol ass 
 And bowed legs 
 And fine hair 
 And all the shit that I want 
 Sexy mothafucka 
 You acting like you want it right now 
 Let a nigga know 
 Is we gon fuck tonight? 
 My dick is gettin' rock hard 
 Oh my god 
 There's gonna be some fuckin' tonight 
 Take your panties off 
 Or move them things off to the side 
 And let a nigga know 
 Is we gun fuck tonight? 
 (Trick Daddy - Verse 1) 
 See good pussy 
 Will bring the freak out ya 
 But if you eat it and don't get cheated 
 The first off I beat the breaks off her 
 No sense in half-steppin' 
 Gettin' serious 
 Get the titties suckin' like 
 Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin' 
 I eat that pussy ass backwards 
 A few strokes of this long warm tongue 
 Should make the pussy cum 
 So much for round one 
 I spend a whole round two in back of u 
 Stick and move 
 Stick and move

 (Trina - Verse 2:) 
 I need a real man 
 I'm sick of playin' with lil' boys 
 I'm tryin' to explore more 
 Like hot oils and sex toys 
 I can't keep fakin' 
 Man I'm so backed up and 
 I can't eat I can't sleep 
 My knees weak makin' me keep shakin' 
 I need a real nigga to come save me 
 One who pamper me and bathe me 
 And make me wanna swallow his baby 
 Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy 
 From the back or in the butt 
 I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby

 (Trick Daddy - Verse 3:) 
 All the matter is 
 I can get you wet again 
 Suck you fuck you better than 
 Any other nigga can 
 I specialize in multi-orgasms 
 Gettin' rid of back spasms 
 And do it all without viagra 
 I'll fuck you all night 
 Make you sleep all day 
 Treat you to breakfast then 
 Eat you for breakfast 
 I know baby 
 I'm so unselfish 
 But you're lovin' it besides 
 I'm a freak so I can't help it 
 All I need is old slow songs 
 One cold shot of patron 
 See you walkin' around me in a thong 
 And it'll be over before the chorus come back on 
 You'll be leavin' and I'll be ad libin' 
 And we'll be singin' our damn song 
 It's like the first time we made each other cum 
 We'll be sucked and fucked each other 
 Taste each other cum 
 No soul alive can erase what we done 
 All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanantly
