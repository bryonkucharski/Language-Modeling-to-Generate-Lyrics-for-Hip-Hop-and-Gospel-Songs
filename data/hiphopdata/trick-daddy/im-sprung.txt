Oh 
 She got me doing 
 What she want to 
 Now you sprung and I told you 
 S-p-r-u-n-g 
 Now you see [x4 fading out] 
 I'm Sprung (I'm Sprung) 
 Dog she got me 
 Got me doing things I'd never do if you ain't been I'm telling you 
 (You do) 
 Its something 'bout you 
 That's got me doing things I said never do (never do) 
 And I can say I'm amazed 
 The way you put it on me 
 How you got me chasing you (chasing you) 
 And I can care less 
 I could give a damn 
 To see you (ride and die?) 
 Look down this bitch 
 You can take no shit 
 Keep it real, but I still look fly 
 (Look taller?) 
 (I'm tell ya how feel?) 
 It ain't your face and it ain't your hips (your hips) 
 Its how you (run around?) to lick them lips 
 And when I do, shawty you don't even trip 
 And keep it rumble band for my (crib?) 
 Keep it fly for my seven (my wheel (my wheel)?) 
 I'm you nigga gonna be like this done 
 And when you hoops got me like that (oh) I'm sprung 
 She got me doin' da dishes 
 Anything she want for some kisses 
 I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry 
 All she do is actin' like she want me 
 She cuttin' off all my homies 
 Even all my other ronnies 
 She ain't even my main lady 
 See I been thinking 'bout it lately 
 Man she really don't deserve me 
 All she wanna do is hurt me 
 So I gotta get away from her 
 But now I'm leaving quickly 
 Before she come and try to get me 
 And I'm takin' everything with me 
 Well it all come down to her 
 (You do) 
 Ain't never been a sucker for love (never been a sucker for love) 
 Never had a girlfriend till I start fucking with her (start fucking with her) 
 Ain't never even had me locked me down (locked me down) 
 And she hooked on the wall tryna lock me down (lock me down) 
 One flip of the tone and I was sprung (I was sprung) 
 And we get done till 4, 5 in the morn (4, 5 in the morn) 
 She had me deep in the zone (deep in the zone) 
 You can get a brand new wardrobe, 
 But baby you ain't going home (but baby you ain't going home) 
 But the new jag and all the Louis bags (all the Louis bags) 
 She nearly got him strait from (bale harbor, bale harbor) 
 I told my home boys I'd holler (I'd holler) 
 I got plans for my date, my girl want steaks (girl want steaks) 
 And she preferred being honest (being honest) 
 We can go Monday to Sunday don't even matter 'bout the money ('bout the money) 
 I'm stuck on her (stuck on her) 
 Never should have let her suck on it (suck on it) 
 And she hit us up and be home in the next morn 
 (You do) 
 So we went our separate ways 
 It's been a couple of days 
 But now I'm doin' what I want to 
 With nobody tellin' me what I'm gonna do 
 And I'm feeling so free 
 With nobody but me 
 Now I can handle all my business 
 All my fellas can I get a witness 
 But I'm feelin' kinda lonely 
 On top of that I'm kinda horny 
 And I gotta get back to her 
 Now I'm leavin' quickly 
 Before she come and try to get me 
 And I'm takin' everythang with me 
 Well it all come down to her
