Gotta change my life 
 Lord knows I ain't livin' right 
 Y'all know I ain't chillin' right 
 Smokin' out everyday and night 
 Gotta ease my mind 
 Gotta find time to rewind 
 'Cause I'm fallin' way behind 
 Me and my dogs we known to ride 
 Gotta watch my back 
 Represent for the soldier 
 Die couple years older 
 Have boulders, a lil soda 
 Get rich with a motive 
 Now shit done changed 
 Niggaz gunnin in the rain 
 On straight cocaine 
 And it ain't no thang 
 Since the game in his arm 
 Straight aim at his arm 
 Gotta watch my back 
 Gotta stack my flow 
 Gotta pay my bills 
 Leave bread in the will 
 All to the old girl 
 See y'all hoes betta chill 
 Now back to the game 
 Lotsa niggaa been dying for this 
 Done lost they lives to this 
 Got me on this survival some type of AK rider 
 Na I started with thug 
 A thug with a heart 
 Took a trip with some heart 
 Had a dude he was scarred 
 See his maom in the park 
 Tears dried up 
 Mom what's wrong (what's wrong) 
 Your son's gone 
 Is he ever comin' back home 
 She said you straight young nigga 
 Take a look in tha mirror 
 I was there when you was gone 
 Now back to the streets 
 Where young niggaz like me 
 Gon do what we got to do 
 You ain't nuttin without ya crew 
 Betta light in tha night and I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
 In the bedroom tied uo 
 With ya mouthpiece wired up 
 Just shaped on tha floor 
 Had none of ya guns keep muthafuckaz fired up 
 An see that's the truth 
 I done told my nigga this street shit ain't a game 
 But it seem the same 
 Young nigga get slanged 
 For a lil bit a fame and cocaine 
 Try to do thangs 
 Just for the benzs and beamers and bithces 
 Thinkin' riches gon take care snitches 
 And niggaz wit triggaz 
 Niggaz betta watch they back 
 'Cause the same time I'm tryin' to speak to you and realease to you 
 Some shit ya need 
 Young nigga wit greed gon try to put the heat to you 
 Speed to you 
 They callin in the gat 
 In the dunge with a guy 
 Ski mask and a vest 
 Let his heart do the rest 
 Thuggin', broke niggaz be the best 
 Yes, and gon die if ya buck 
 So get fucked right up 
 Come back if ya like 
 Bring ya gat if ya like 
 And get stacked if ya like 
 On ya back if ya like 
 All I neded was a chance 
 A MAC-10 and a benz 
 So I can clown with my friends 
 Show the world I'm a man 
 Then broke but those in the pen 
 When I'm off in the club 
 Much love for the thugs 
 See hennessy in the clubs 
 Got all these rabid ass, maggot hoes 
 They love the thugs 
 Now bout dem hoes 
 Try to find them a man 
 That can pay they bills 
 And yes they can 
 Weight 28 grams 
 Take a tour of the land 
 Ain't got no plan 
 They'll wait for a thug 
 Go give 'em a hug 
 Show 'em how to be loved 
 Then suck 'em up 
 Straight fuckin' 'em up 
 Then get in his benz 
 Get with all his friends 
 Take all his ends 
 Then send him to the pen 
 Then do it all again 
 Amen 
 But lord forgive em 
 Have mercy on they're souls 
 For livin' like hoes 
 And say a lil prayer for me and my life 
 'Cause I ain't livin' right you know I 
 Hook (till fade)
