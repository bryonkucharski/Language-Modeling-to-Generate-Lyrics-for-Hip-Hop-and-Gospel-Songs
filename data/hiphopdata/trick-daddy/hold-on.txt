Hey cue that shit that the verse mixed up 
 (See what I'm sayin'?) 
 Gotsta hold on 
 I been trapped for so long 
 Gotsta hold on 
 I been trapped for so long 
 Gotsta hold on 
 I been trapped for so long 
 Gotsta hold on 
 See, 
 See marijuana got me copin' wit my problems 
 And Hennessy got me hopin' I could solve em 
 My baby mama full of drama 
 Tryin' to scar me 
 But unlike my old sorry ass father I tried harder 
 My baby raised to hate her daddy 
 Her mammy playa hate and wishin' that she had me 
 She hate to see me on tha street 
 And still on my feet 
 Betta yet this bitch wish them crackers had me 
 See everybody wantsa hustle 
 But don't nobody wanna suffer 
 Nobody wantsta die 'cause they all bustas 
 And suckaz 
 Ain't never gon have nothin' 
 'Cause they be frontin' 
 Gotta sacrifice 
 Three time for every dime they be wantin' 
 And believe me 
 Being a thug it ain't that easy 
 I once was a fool but see they had to free me 
 I'm undercover man 
 But still they ain't respectin' me 
 Tryin' to get the best of me constantly stressin' me 
 We gotta hold on (hold on) 
 See you must be strong (so strong) 
 Against thug happiness (gotsta hold on) 
 You can go wrong (I been trapped for so long) 
 For my homies in the hood (gotsta hold on) 
 What will you do (I been trapped or so long) 
 Which life will you choose (gotsta hold on) 
 (I been trapped for so long) 
 See big daddy gave her diamond rings 
 He introduced her to the finer things 
 Looked out started buyin' her things 
 Minor things for the small change 
 And had her off the chain 
 And it's a awful thang 
 She ain't even cost a thang 
 Even though I'm thugged out 
 She loved how 
 I did wrong for so long 
 And still got by 
 See thug money got blood on it 
 Plus it leave residue 
 Boy I'm tellin' you 
 I put mo bread on it 
 I lost a homie in the struggle right 
 And just the other night 
 Somebody tried to take my dog's life 
 Attempted homicide 
 They outside and ain't gon let 'em ride 
 Don't wanna talk 
 And ain't gon let 'em slide 
 They want war instead 
 They want more for dead 
 Rather die open fire or do life for theirs 
 Take a life instead 
 Kill his wife in bed 
 Ten times to tha head 
 What tha shooter said? 
 See 
 I thinkin' 'bout when I was younger 
 I had to hustle in the summer 
 No time for cryin' had to help my mama 
 Any time and any weather 
 Whatever's clever 
 And hardly ever never 
 Had to step and get my shit together 
 I left my homies in tha pen and reason being 
 See every man got his own sin 
 But I'm a always remember y'all 
 'Cause after all y'all still my dogs 
 And when ya jump we can still ball 
 My nigga Ronnie, Lil Willie and Fat Fred 
 Big Black, my dog Sparky and Lil Ed 
 It be times like this 
 I sit around like this 
 Cryin' 'bout this 
 Thinkin' why my clique 
 Gotta go and die like this 
 No duckin' 
 No fearin' nothin' 
 Hearin' nothin' stayin' rich but buggin' 
 We call that thuggin' 
 But don't be thuggin' for nothin' own somethin' 
 Do or ya kids and ya mama 
 Save the drama 
 Young nigga hold on 
 Na it ain't no time or no suicidal shit nigga 
 While you still thinkin' you a thug 
 You might as well go head and suffer 
 'Cause that's what we doin' 
 That's what it's about 
 I ya forgot
