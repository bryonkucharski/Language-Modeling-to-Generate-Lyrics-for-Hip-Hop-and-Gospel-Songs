 Chorus: Trick Daddy (4x) 
 Ah ha, Okay

 Trick Daddy: 
 Ridin' 'round in my brand new, '99, 4 do', Volvo 
 I got a pocket full of B's, cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go tho' 
 But all my Boca Boys they know though, that's fo' sho' though 
 (Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?) Hell nah ho you know they Polo 
 I been used again, choosed again 
 This time been wrong to chop somethin' dumped by one of my union friends 
 Soon as they seen the Benz, hatin' season was in 
 Hell 'cause they figured me for not understandin' their reason being 
 But I'm the man for this 
 While y'all was doin' fine I was doin' time just, prayin' for this 
 Locked up, make a plan for this 
 Without all that fancy shit 
 Way too advanced for this 
 Just Polo socks, tanks tops and drawers up under my pants and shit 
 Shut Up 
 Chorus: Trick Daddy (8x)

 You need a grand just to speak to me 
 Okay, are you sure you wanna sleep wit' me 
 Okay, you better be fo' sho' 
 'Cause I don' left niggaz like you stuck befo'
