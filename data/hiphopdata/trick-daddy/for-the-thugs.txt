 So I, say a prayer for that playa 
 And I, take my fire everywhere, see 
 Its kinda hard when you missin' yo' dawgs 
 Another name on the wall 
 They keep takin' the fall 
 Yes I be livin' though 
 Dead and gone befo' we twenty fo' 
 Or in jail but cha'll don't here me though 
 Is this world about to end 
 If not then explain to me, how come I'm losin my friends 
 And why I'm livin' wit my kid 
 And why I'm fifty grand short from gettin' me a brand new benz 
 Its kinda hard for the black man 
 I watch the million man march for the black man 
 And through the sun and rain 
 I love enjoyin' pain 
 I know we be livin' strange but we'll maintain hey 
 I'm doin' this one for the thugs 
 And the niggas on the corner sellin' drugs 
 For the thugs yes sir

 And the boys down south much love 
 For the thugs yes sir 
 For the thugs and the boys in the city much love 
 For the thugs yes sir 
 For the thugs 
 And the dogs in the grove much love 
 See, I, I, gotta called from the crib 
 My dawg got killed 
 Gotta all my homies in tears 
 And we don't know who the killas is 
 It could have been the lick 
 It could have been the hit 
 I 'on't know we stayed in some shit so 
 We put his face on a shirt 
 And shedded tears for the game 
 (A thug in memory boy) 
 'Cause it's hard to hide the pain 
 They teach us some better thangs 
 The shoes his mama a back 'cause she could use the change 
 That's how you ride for yo dogs, shit 
 Ride or roll take sides for yo dog 
 Suppose to die for your dogs, shit 
 Hard time in gangsta livin' 
 And got us villain chillin' 
 Try to start no crossin' me and you so 
 And you cry for yo' dogs 
 Hell, I don't understand 
 Man, I say a prayer to all of y'all 
 And for the cause 
 For my motherfuckin' dogs 
 Nigga! 
 I'm doin' this one for the thugs 
 And the niggas on the corner sellin drugs 
 For the thugs yes sir

 And the niggas Overtown sellin' drugs 
 For the thugs yes sir

 And my Carol City niggas much love 
 For my thugs yes sir 
 For the thugs 
 And my niggas out in Gouls 
 For the thugs 
 If it was a hundred dollar bill 
 Would ya, could ya ride for me 
 Start a fight, better yet, would you die for me 
 Under oath baby girl would you lie for me 
 Getta gackin open 5 for me 
 Now would you cry for me 
 Turna trick, or do or die for me 
 Food stamps, if you apply for me 
 Well certified for me 
 Can't count but you'll try for me 
 Or do it all for me
