 You ain't, you ain't, iced out 
 Tuck, tuck that ice in

 Tuck, tuck that ice in,

 Lights on, lights off

 Tuck, tuck that, ice in 
 You ain't, you ain't, iced out

 (Trick daddy) 
 My shit is platinum, 
 These assholes wearin' white gold 
 See I'm to smart for this cause, 
 All my shit paid for 
 And why should I rent a house, 
 When I can huy it and write it off 
 Make it my Florida home for the summer, 
 Round winter time just rent it out 
 See I ain't none of them, 
 Who ride around on rented rims 
 Change on the weekend, 
 And floss in him mama's Benz 
 See when I hit the scene, 
 I be so fresh so clean 
 White fitted, white tee, 
 Ain't nan nigga like me 
 What kind of shit you on, 
 Wearin' fuckin' rhinestones 
 Them cubic zirconia son, 
 Them ain't fuckin' diamonds, 
 So you gonna fuck around, 
 And get gangrene at the arm 
 Who'd rob and kill one, 
 Over some mother-fuckin' slum 
 Your chain is crazy, 
 That shit for gazey 
 And it ain't real, 
 Unless its copper or stainless steel 
 So whoever made it... 
 You shouldn't have paid it 
 Twenty grand for a watch 
 That's fuckin' gold plated! 
 (BABY) 
 16 out the house, 
 17 gold mouth, 
 18 on the block, 
 Nigga got them thangs out, 
 Birdman stunna, nigga we don't sit in jail 
 Real n (Chorus)

 16 out the house,

 18 on the block, 
 Nigga got them thangs out, 
 Birdman stunna, nigga we don't sit in jail 
 Real nigga's do real thangs, 
 You know we make bail 
 Trick hit me on the cell, 
 Know I gotta make a sale 
 Found myself in Dade County, 
 Nigga's movin' pounds of bail 
 So fresh, so bright with the ice, 
 Nigga you could loose your life playing with the bright lights! Yeah, 
 Cali got my back, 
 I'm strapped nigga and prephase, 
 Doin' it big, poppin' bottles, N*** the g-way 
 Black handles, black ice, we'll get it right 
 For a cheap price nigga that cutter'll get your mind right, 
 M.O.B. to a bitch, 
 Made my hood rich 
 Quick cash, young money, it's that uptown shit, 
 Ballin'one them bitches, 
 Shock callin' on them bitches, 
 Two million on some ice and some cars on them bitches 
 (Trick daddy) 
 They asked the kid the difference between mine and his, 
 See my shit blindin' 
 His shit don't shine, 
 Cause that shit ain't real 
 His gemstones, they fruity pebbles, 
 Just like Flinstones, 
 And he had his "Roley" on, 
 But I ain't even notice his arm, 
 But his diamonds cloudy, 
 And he ain't shiny, 
 And I heard his shit "Tick Tick Tickin'" 
 Oh man, this nigga trippin'! 
 See we poppin' bottles and smokin' bugga, 
 Actin' cocky 
 Big thangs with fat pockets, 
 Wearing seventy-thousand dollar watches 
 My overseas friends, 
 Are breakin' thangs in, 
 Invest in a smaller hit town, 
 Shakin', bakin'and breakin' it down 
 We gettin' top dollar, 
 'Cause we got that top powder 
 Hoes slob on our johnson, 
 Cause johnson got that best powder 
 We call a grand a dollar, 
 We gettin' money holla 
 Rollin' hard with five fives, 
 Real fucking street ballers 
 I did five trucks since the first quarter, 
 I'm on the right path at this rate, 
 I'll be sellin' slabs by the halfs 
 Tuck, tuck that, 
 Tuck, tuck that, 
 Tuck, tuck that, 
 Tuck, tuck that, 
 Tuck, tuck that, ice in 
 You ain't, you ain't, iced out 
 Tuck, tuck that ice in 
 I shine like a lighthouse 
 Tuck, tuck that ice in, 
 You ain't, you ain't iced 
 Lights on, lights off 
 I shine like a lighthouse 
 Tuck, tuck that, ice in 
 You ain't, you ain't, iced out 
 Tuck, tuck that ice in 
 I shine like a lighthouse 
 Tuck, tuck that ice in,
