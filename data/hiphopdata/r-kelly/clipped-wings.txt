Sunny days, I promised you 
 Life's window pain 
 With a perfect view 
 A vow to love, unconditional 
 Be there for you, all season 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love 
 Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby 
 Now I'm wishing you 
 You would fly right back to me, yeah 
 I made a vow, to walk with you 
 Through anything, life puts you through 
 Told you the world is yours and everything in it 
 Then you took your heart, for granted 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, never 
 Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby 
 Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby 
 Now I'm wishing you 
 You would fly right back to me, yeah 
 I was your eagle, you were my daffodil 
 And nothing would come between us, no, no, no 
 Now the fun and laughter, going to the park 
 And all the pictures we took 
 Now it's all gone away 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love 
 And baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby 
 Now I'm wishing you 
 You would fly right back to me, yeah 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby 
 I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love 
 Baby girl I never, 
 Meant to clip the wings of an angel 
 When I was supposed to love you baby 
 For eternity 
 Now I'm wishing you 
 You would fly right back to me.
