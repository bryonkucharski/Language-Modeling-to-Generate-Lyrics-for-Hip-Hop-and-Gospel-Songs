Mm damn this sound familiar 
 This sound real familiar

 VIP wit all my thugs, Hennessy make me tear up the club 
 Drop top V, rollin' on dubs 
 Chicken heads, showin' nutin' but love 
 So much money 
 Hands in the air like what the fuck 
 DJ say this mix is the cut 
 'Cause we be on the flo' like we some rugs 
 So come here gurl, give daddy a hug 
 Don't play me, like I'm one of these scrubs 
 Girl if you don't get yo ass off up here and get yo ass in this tub
