I never knew that I could get so close to Heaven! 
 No! 
 I never knew that I could write a song like this! 
 No! 
 And I never knew that it could feel so good to know you, 
 No! 
 And fall in love with you from one simple kiss! 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 I feel like hearts are fallin' on us! 
 Oh, yeas! 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 Can you feel the hearts raining on our love? 
 Never thought in a million years I could feel like this! 
 No! 
 Never ever thought that I would ever get my wish! 
 No! 
 Never thought that I could feel like... 
 No! 
 Never thought that I could be someone's special one! 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 I feel like hearts are fallin' on us! 
 Oh, yeas! 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 Can you feel the hearts raining on our love? 
 Girl, can you feel it? 
 Fallin', fallin'! 
 All the hearts fallin' down 
 Fallin', fallin'! 
 To make you feel it! 
 Oh! I never thought that I would reach the end of a rainbow, 
 No! 
 And I never actually thought that I could feel the sky with my hands! 
 No! 
 Never thought that making love could touch me into my soul, 
 No! 
 And I never thought that I would be interested in marrying her! 
 I feel like hearts are fallin' on us! 
 Oh, yeas! 
 I feel fallin' hearts! 
 Can you feel the hearts raining on our love? 
 Girl, can you feel it? 
 Fallin', fallin'! 
 All the hearts fallin' down 
 Fallin', fallin'! 
 Baby, tell me, can you feel the falling hearts? 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 I feel like hearts are fallin' on us! 
 Oh, yeas! 
 Fallin' hearts! 
 Can you feel the hearts raining on our love? 
 Girl, tell me, can you feel it? 
 Fallin' on us! 
 Oh, no! We don't need no umbrella, 
 Let it rain on us! 
 Fallin', fallin'! 
 Just let the hearts come down! 
 Fallin', fallin'!
