Things that I have to say to you 
 You need to hear 
 And I know we've got some rebuildin', oh 
 But I believe time will heal 
 Anything that you wanna do 
 Baby girl I'mma support you 
 And anything that you're going through 
 I swear I will be there for you, you 
 It's been so many years so I know it feels awkward 
 Know you had to tuck all of your (?) in your school locker 
 And I understand your position 
 And why your heart went missin' 
 And things that you wondered 
 Oh oh-ooh 
 I know that you mad at me, thinkin' that I didn't care 
 Talk to me, cause 
 I just wanna be there 
 When you conquer the world I just wanna be there 
 But no matter how successful baby girl 
 When you need someone to lean on I just wanna be your shoulder 
 When you need someone to call on I wanna be the one to hold ya 
 I just wanna be there 
 (Be there 
 Be there, be there) 
 I just wanna be there 
 Call me back when I be calling you 
 'Cause I be feelin' like I'm stalking you 
 And I know you've got issues with rejection, oh 
 I'm just being honest, I know what you're thinking, never did I neglect ya, no 
 'Cause I love you too much (?) 
 And I would just kill myself before I do anything to hurt ya 
 One hunnid, all I ever wanted to do is please you 
 And I don't know what happened to us but I need you 
 I just wanna be there 
 When you conquer the world I just wanna be there 
 But no matter how successful baby girl 
 When you need someone to lean on I just wanna be your shoulder 
 When you need someone to call on I wanna be the one to hold ya 
 I just wanna be there 
 (Be there 
 Be there, be there) 
 I just wanna be there 
 I know that there were so many things going on 
 And there were some times I thought I wouldn't make it 
 But my brothers and me kept each other strong 
 How do I tell 'em why you're not there when I don't even know myself 
 I hate you, I love you, I do and I don't wanna see you 
 You tell us you need us but that we just need to believe you 
 My heart is broke, it's so hard to cope 
 And every night I cry out to heaven 'cause I need you both more 
 And sometimes it was easy to not say anything 
 My mind was at war, baby you're not the enemy 
 And it still feels like we're miles away 
 But I can meet you halfway cause at the end of the day 
 I just wanna be there 
 Be there for you, yeah, yeah 
 When you conquer the world I just wanna be there 
 But no matter how successful baby girl 
 When you need someone to lean on I just wanna be your shoulder 
 When you need someone to call on I wanna be the one to hold ya 
 I just wanna be there 
 (Be there 
 Be there, be there) 
 I just wanna be there
