 Can you really step? Can you cut a rug? 
 Aight, so what we gonna do is slow it down 
 And see if you can step to this one 
 Another one for the ladies

 Your music weatherman

 Can't wait till your clothes hit the floor 
 I want you so bad, my pretty baby 
 Oh, baby, you should know how I feel 
 When it comes down to making love with you (whoa) 
 So come on (come on), let's get on this plane of love baby 
 And fly through the night 
 And our destination is wherever your spot is baby (oh baby) 
 And woman please believe me I'm gonna drive you crazy, so 
 Welcome to (welcome to) the greatest show on Earth (the greatest show) 
 Welcome baby, to my bedroom girl (hello) 
 Welcome to the greatest show on Earth 
 Girl welcome to the greatest show on earth 
 What you're about to witness 
 Is unheard 
 I'll be kissing places on you (kissing you baby) 
 All the way from your head to toe and everything in between 
 I promise to keep you a happy camper 
 While we make history (Lord have mercy) 
 Tonight we'll rescue love and set it free 
 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be 
 Oh baby, tonight we'll reach the skies 
 Just you and me girl, 'cause 
 All I want, all I need, is you here loving me tonight, girl 
 So come on (come on) and let's get on this plane of love baby 
 We'll fly through the night (girl through the night) 
 And our destination is wherever your spot is baby (oh baby) 
 And I guarantee (my body) I'm gonna drive you crazy 
 Girl like a circus when it comes to town 
 (So many bills in my switch, flips and tricks, in places all around) 
 Oh baby come on, girl 
 I'll be kissing you, baby up and down 
 Giving it to you round and round 
 So 
 Welcome to (welcome to the greatest) the greatest show on Earth
