Hey, me and my baby got into a fight 
 Man, it must've lasted all through the night. 
 By the time we rest the crawl at the crack of the light 
 We made love, now everything's alright. 
 All rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight 
 Said, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight 
 Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby 
 Everything gonna be alright. 
 Hey, bartender fix up a drink for everybody in here tonight 
 Smell in my face and I'm ready to rock 
 No bad news tonight 
 Where the band is crookin', the girls are looking 
 And I only want a night 
 We and my baby reunited 
 Feels so outside 
 Told her I was sorry, she said she forget me 
 We gon' make some love tonight 
 Where the joy is swinggin' and everybody's singing 
 Rock 'n roll songs tonight 
 Hey, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight 
 Said, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight 
 Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby 
 Everything gonna be alright. 
 All rounds on me, all rounds on me, all rounds on me 
 All rounds on me, all rounds on me, all rounds on me 
 Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby 
 Everything gonna be alright. 
 He-e-ey! 
 Oh, everything I own I'm gonna give it to my baby 
 Lou girl, know she drives me crazy 
 Last call and the party's over 
 We're going to a motel room and we're gonna make some love. 
 Shots on me 'cause feel real good tonight 
 Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby 
 Everything gonna be alright. 
 All rounds on me, all rounds on me, all rounds on me 
 All rounds on me, all rounds on me, all rounds on me 
 Said I'm back with my baby, 
 Everything gon' be alright. 
 Hey, hey, hey
