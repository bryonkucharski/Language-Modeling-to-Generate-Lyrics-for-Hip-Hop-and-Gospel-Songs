Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building 
 Kels' in the building, Kels' in the building 
 Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building 
 Kels' in the building, Kels' in the building 
 I'm in the building tonight, it's goin' down, my nigga 
 Got a pocket full of cash an' some 'dro, my nigga 
 Attitude like 'I don't give a fuck', my nigga 
 Probably the drunkest fool on the flo', my nigga 
 One of the best that ever did this here, every year 
 It's the number one R an' B singer this year 
 But y'all know, still mo' money, mo' problems 
 Mo' niggaz, mo' chicks, mo' clubs, mo' bottles 
 One little note in your ear an' I gotcha 
 Ladies call me the Black Frank Sinatra 
 Yeah, a real pimp floss an' the pimp be blingin' 
 It's just the same reason why a young pimp be leanin' 
 Hard liquor, couple sips an' I'm passin' it 
 Maybach so big you can dance in it 
 Jigga, lil' nigga, fuckin' with the baddest chicks 
 Got your girl lookin' at you like the maddest chick 
 We goin' 
 Oh oh, oh oh 
 We got everybody up in the club 
 Hands high goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got players, ballers, hustlers 
 An' they back goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got all of the pretty girls 
 Repped in the city goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 Yo, yeah, it's the boy, Hov', yeah, I blow O's 
 Circles around competition, not an optimo 
 To sit low in a six oh, oh 
 Solo on lo-lo's, fuck po'-po's 
 Take a photo, last time you see a nigga so cold 
 So below zero, so froze 
 So so rappers are so sore, hate his soul 
 It ain't my fault I'm so rock 'n' roll 
 I'm just Hov an' we goin' 
 Oh oh, oh oh 
 We got everybody up in the club 
 Hands high goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got players, ballers, hustlers 
 An' they back goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got all of the pretty girls 
 Repped in the city goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 Jeah, it's the kid from the sty an' I stay high 
 In my A O L A blowin', "La la la" 
 Goodbye, I see you chumps on top 
 Or on the highway in somethin' that ends with I 
 Like I 745, I 
 Or the F E double R the A R I 
 AR 15 to spray y'all guys 
 You die, goodbye 
 Oh oh, oh oh 
 We got everybody up in the club 
 Hands high goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got players, ballers, hustlers 
 An' they back goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got all of the pretty girls 
 Repped in the city goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 From New York to Chi, we blow like hydro 
 Blow out live shows without pyro 
 See how I combined the I O flow 
 Tone'll rep, Memph Bleek, Kels an' Hov 
 Bottles, models, follow to the hotter 
 Way we play like it's no day tomorrow 
 Spendin' my dough like I just hit the Lotto 
 Bounce, park an' stop, shall not wake I'm straight safe 
 Oh oh, oh oh 
 We got everybody up in the club 
 Hands high goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got players, ballers, hustlers 
 An' they back goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got all of the pretty girls 
 Repped in the city goin', "Oh oh, oh oh" 
 We got 'em goin', y'all 
 We got 'em goin', y'all
