Umm pum pum pum 
 Pum pum, pum pum, pum pum 
 Look behind myself 
 As I reflect on all the memories 
 Good times, they come and go 
 Lost everything from friends to family 
 If I could turn back the hands 
 There would be some things I'd change about me 
 I know that my past is not what my future holds 
 Where I come from who could believe 
 All the pain and misery? 
 Look in my eyes and you'll see 
 The diary of me, of me 
 Rewind my life 
 Just go back and correct all the wrong 
 And ask God to direct my path 
 So that I can make it home 
 And if I could turn back the hands of time 
 There would be some things I would change about me 
 But I know that my past is not what my future holds 
 'Cause where I'm from who could believe 
 All the pain, misery 
 Look in my eyes and you will see 
 The diary of me 
 Years ago a child was born 
 And raised without a man 
 My mother's gone 
 But still reached out her hand 
 Just open the book 
 Turn the pages of my life 
 And you will read 
 A true story about one man's journey 
 Where I'm from who would believe, yeah 
 That all the hurt and pain and misery? 
 Look in my eyes and you'll see 
 The diary of me 
 Where I'm from who could believe 
 The hurt and pain and misery? 
 Look in my eyes and you will see 
 The makings of my diary 
 Where I'm from who could believe 
 The hurt and pain and misery? 
 Look in my eyes and you will see 
 The makings of my diary 
 Where I'm from who could believe?
