Entrea 
 Ay, tantas cosas que quiero 
 Decirte yo quiero 
 Hacer por ti 
 But first we must dance 
 Private cotillion style 
 One lady's fantasy 
 Trip to Milan tonight 
 Exclusive shopping spree 
 Mansions await, your scent 
 That smells just like treasure 
 Dining with me in suites 
 That overlooks the shore 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 Kissing the feet of you 
 While listening to bonsais 
 And your angelic grace 
 Wearing Victoria 
 Passionate love with you 
 Hearing you, "Oh, oui oui" 
 Some antique jewelry from 
 Kenshire's gallery 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 And when you'll elevate 
 Like visions of grandeur 
 Mademoiselle and me 
 Behind the villa doors 
 Sunsets on yellow sand 
 That's where we rendezvous 
 Chapels of Valentine 
 Is just to name a few 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we move, then we touch, then we dip 
 Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss 
 Dancin' with a rich man 
 As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
