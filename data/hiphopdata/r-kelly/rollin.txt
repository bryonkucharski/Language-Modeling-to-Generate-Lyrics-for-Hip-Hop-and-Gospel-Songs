Kellz 
 I'm back Niggas 
 What? 
 Y'all thought I was gone? 
 Nope 
 Rollin' 
 Coming out them fruity colored candied doors (rollin') 
 Catch me hopping up and down on 24's (rollin') 
 Rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 When I was down you bitches didn't want to be my friends (rollin') 
 And now I'm rollin' all you bitches wanna hop in 
 Rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' (hey) 
 I be rollin' (hey) 
 I be rollin' (hey) 
 I'm going toot toot, beep beep 
 Pulling up on them wheels now 
 All black on body got it shining much like a seal now 
 And a shoty much like a seal now 
 Got them cars in my garage 
 No less than a mil now 
 Kellz about to take the bar 
 And I'mma set it real high 
 Double take, double take 
 When I roll up to the club 
 Players hate, players hate 
 When I walk up in the club 
 I got them shades on doing about 75 
 Just call me speed racer 'cause I'm rollin' in at mach 5 
 Y'all niggas ain't fucking with me 
 And I put a mil on it 
 Niggas and bitches they lie 
 But home boy them stats don't 
 R & B Boss 
 Hussling like Rick Ross 
 Man my flow is so raw, 
 So niggas don't piss me off 
 I'm a player homie and that's a well known factor 
 Plus the wheels on that coup got it looking like a tractor 
 Take my ice hold it up 
 Then my city toss it up 
 Chi town, summer time 
 Kellz got traffic backed up 
 Rollin' 
 Coming out them fruity colored candied doors (rollin') 
 Catch me hopping up and down on 24's (rollin') 
 Rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' 
 When I was down you bitches didn't want to be my friends (rollin') 
 And now I'm rollin' all you bitches wanna hop in 
 Rollin' 
 I'll be rollin' (hey) 
 I be rollin' (hey) 
 I be rollin' (hey) 
 Yellow ice 
 Cash money, I got cash money 
 Just to hear them horses go 
 Vrrrrrmmmm 
 I spent that cash money 
 As for the haters, they ass funny 
 My money like a road block 
 So watch how you roll roll your crash dummy 
 I'm rolling in, I roll and bounce, I roll and stop 
 Roll slow motion, then I let the beat drop 
 Honies love it when I roll up on them wheels 
 Top down, looking fly, 
 Climbing on them wheels 
 I got them 24's on that coup 
 You know they chop and spin 
 I put an S on my maybach cause that's my super benz 
 I own a nightlight shining when I roll through 
 Hop out that Zerogi 101 color Smurf blue 
 Silver bullet Lex Jeap parked out at my beach home 
 Think I'm from the swamp the way I step out with them gators on 
 On the hood on that old school, I be smoking trees on it 
 Just copped a Cadillac, I'm about to throw some D's on it 
 Rollin'
