From beyond this bed of mine I see, 
 Ceiling fans with you on top of me, 
 And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun, 
 And all your secret fantasies thy will be done (done), 
 And inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn, 
 That will feast your body all night, 
 And if keep this up then our love child will be born, 
 All because of the greatest, 
 The greatest you, the greatest me, 
 We have found, the greatest chemistry, 
 The greatest touch, the greatest kiss, 
 What came to be, is the greatest wish, 
 The greatest show, the greatest song, 
 The greatestwords, the greatest all night long, 
 Baby your love stays constantly on my mind, 
 This is the best sex I've ever had 
 I know twelve ways to make your love come down, 
 And the secret places on you will be found, 
 Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar, 
 There's no telling what this night could have in store, 
 Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn, 
 That will feast your body all night, 
 And if we keep this up then our love child will be born, 
 All because of the greatest, 
 The greatest you, the greatest me, 
 We have found, the greatest chemistry, 
 The greatest touch, the greatest kiss, 
 What came to be, is the greatest wish, 
 The greatest show, the greatest song, 
 The greatestwords, the greatest all night long, 
 Baby your love stays constantly on my mind, 
 This is the best sex I've ever had
