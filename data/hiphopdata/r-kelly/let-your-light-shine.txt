This song is dedicated 
 To the city of New Orleans 
 From the whole world, let's go 
 I feel your heartbeat, I see your tears fall 
 I see your hands go up, now you've given up on it all 
 I see your head go down, I know you've lost hope 
 You're walls keep on comin' down and you can't take no more 
 Every road you travel seems like your journey's end 
 That life's an endless battle that you can't seem to win 
 Well I say, stand up and claim what's yours 
 Leave those troubles behind and don't you look back no more 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 I know your struggles and I feel your pain 
 You're doin' everythin' to stop yourself from goin' insane 
 Tryin' to find the strength to fight your way back 
 But life keeps swingin' on you 'cause you're under attack 
 You prayed and cried about it but still no change has come 
 My life is livin' proof that you're not the only one 
 And that's why I say, stand up and take your place 
 Hold your head up high and put a smile upon your face 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 When the storm sends it dark clouds 
 (And put it right over you) 
 And a step seems like a million miles 
 (And you don't know what to do) 
 You gotta stand and be strong now 
 (You've got to get up now) 
 And the morning will come and victory will be yours, yours 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 Let your light shine on the world 
 (No matter the weather) 
 Let your light shine, let your light shine 
 (We gonna shine together)
