Quik talking: 
 Yeah ain't nothin' changed y'all niggas still obvious. 
 Yeah it's for real though hmph 
 (Rapping:) 
 Now we don't want to talk about all the people I'm supportin' 
 That's more important to a nigga than them diamonds you sportin' 
 Ain't a sell out or a bail out although life is a bitch 
 And I'm beginning to think that they don't want to see Quik rich 
 'Cause I'm gon' gather up my homiez and put something in they bellies 
 Ride around the town bumpin' that CD from R.Kelly 
 Gettin' at them ghetto queens if you know what I mean 
 'Cause it ain't nothin' like some lovin' dipped in afro sheen 
 Break it down with two gates in that burgundy eight 
 'Cause real riders don't three wheel they just drown on the skate 
 Send a care package to my homiez up in Natches 
 And shoot a kite 'bout how these suckas keep my Benz up in scratches 
 It ain't no puzzle that's to be expected 
 Sometimes I think they only come around it just to see if I wrecked it 
 I feel like hittin' the 101 leavin' town on a bike 
 On my way up to the Bay to clear my mind 'cause it's like... 
 (Chorus (R.Kelly)) 
 Everyday is a scuffle 
 Turnin' them corners to get my hustle 
 Every single dollar is a struggle 
 That's how it is comin' up in the ghetto 
 (Maus-Berg:) 
 Now I don' been through it all pushin' work on the boulevard 
 Runnin' from the 5-0 in somebody else car 
 Ghetto dreams so it seems to be easy 
 Think about my life & I get queasy 
 Pumpin' the pimp knowin' it ain't helpin' me 
 But the ghetto got me trapped thinkin' this is how it's s'posed to be 
 A cold thang when you knowin' yo' gang ain't got yo' back 
 But you still put yo' life on the line for no snaps. 
 (R.Kelly:) 
 This ghetto world is one big battlefield 
 That's why we get rich and move to them hills 
 Everywhere we go the haters tag along 
 But don't let that stop you get yo' hustle on 
 Maus-Berg: 
 But dog you gotta do yo' thang get yo' grind on 
 Eliminate the fake and keep yo' game strong 
 Don't let the streets be yo' downfall 
 Keep it real with yo'self and you gon' rise till you ball dog 
 Quik: 
 It's gettin' down to ground level but tryin' to keep time 
 'Cause my hustle and my tustle is my beats and my rhymes 
 And I'm lovin' this collabo' 'cause Rock Land is saucy 
 And Quik is trying to get Versace staying flossy wit Mausy 
 But the... 
 (Maus-Berg:) 
 ...Drama don't stop but you can make it better 
 Don't point your finger at the next man get yo' cheddar 
 Lifestyles of a thug ebonic definition dog nothin' but love 
 But we gon' ride to till we can't ride no mo' 
 Pop a bottle a pair of D's and let the wind blow 
 When you get it appreciate it 'cause those who ain't got it gon' hate 
 Every dime is a struggle so I'ma suffer everyday 
 (Quik:) 
 Now my conscience got me wonderin' do I be in the flow 
 And this sucka's got me wonderin' if he friend or foe 
 Now do I sin to grow, knowin' there's consequences 
 And I'm tired of gettin' bent 'cause it's dullin' my senses 
 (Chorus till end)
