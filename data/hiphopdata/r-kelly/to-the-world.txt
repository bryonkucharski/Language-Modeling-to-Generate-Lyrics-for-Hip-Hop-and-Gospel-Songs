Let me see you put your middle fingers up, to the world, 
 I made up in my mind 
 I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight 
 I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway 
 Let me say it one more time (fingers up) 
 To the world, to the world, to the world 
 To the world, to the world, to the world 
 Let me see you put your middle fingers up, middle fingers up! 
 (Motherfucker) Deuces minus one 
 Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay) 
 The whole world is a couch 
 Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck) 
 Throw it up, throw it up 
 'Cause you can't take it with you 
 Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you 
 To the world, to the world 
 Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way, 
 Let's take it a notch up, take it up 
 Let me see you put your middle fingers up! To the world 
 I made up in my mind 
 Doin' things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight 
 I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway 
 Let me see you one more time (fingers up) 
 To the world, to the world, to the world 
 Mm' ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador 
 And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord 
 Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score 
 This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola 
 I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that 
 Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs like, "These niggas tryna hold me back 
 These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks 
 Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax 
 Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back 
 Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at? 
 "Ease up there, baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that 
 R. Kelly and the God of rap 
 Shitting on you, holy crap 
 Let me see you put your middle fingers up 
 To the world, to the world, to the world 
 To the world, to the world, to the world 
 Let me see you put your middle fingers up 
 I could give it all up, but it's not enough 
 Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger 
 To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon 
 Hills to the mountains, yeah hands to the roof 
 Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me 
 Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
