"The victims are what mean the most to us and that we cared so much about..." 
 "I just really feel that we are going to be known as the school that overcame". 
 I know you're feeling pain right now 
 And you don't wanna talk right now 
 I know you're going through something 
 And you don't wanna be bothered right now 
 Not gonna lie and say I understand 
 I just wanna be here for you if I can 
 To hold your hand and be by your side 
 And together we will get through these times 
 And we will cry together 
 And we'll fight this together 
 And we'll be strong together 
 Stand together, pray together 
 Rise up, when you feel you can't go on 
 Rise up, when all of your hope is gone 
 Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, and when the tears start to fall 
 Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all 
 Rise up, when your back is up against the wall 
 Rise, rise up 
 Now I know the burdens that you've had 
 And you don't think nobody cares 
 A storm comes out of nowhere 
 And you're feeling like it just ain't fair 
 Not here to preach about the private side, no 
 'Cause I understand and now is not the time 
 See I just wanna help you make it right 
 Walk with you, holding the candle light 
 And we will cry together 
 And we'll fight this together 
 And we'll be strong together 
 Stand together, pray together 
 Rise up, when you feel you can't go on 
 Rise up, when all of your hope is gone 
 Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, and when the tears start to fall 
 Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all 
 Rise up, when your back is up against the wall 
 Rise, rise up 
 You see struggle so hard 
 No color, no color 
 And you missed the price 
 You are my sister 
 I'm your brother 
 And side by side we'll face this thing 
 Standing tall, you and me 
 Rise up, rise 
 Rise up, rise 
 Rise up, rise 
 Hey we gon' rise 
 Rise up, rise 
 Rise up, rise 
 Rise up, when you feel you can't go on 
 Rise up, when all of your hope is gone 
 Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, and when the tears start to fall 
 Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all 
 Rise up, when your back is up against the wall 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, when you feel you can't go on 
 Rise up, when all of your hope is gone 
 Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, and when the tears start to fall 
 Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all 
 Rise up, when your back is up against the wall 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, when you feel you can't go on 
 Rise up, when all of your hope is gone 
 Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong 
 Rise, rise up 
 Rise up, and when the tears start to fall 
 Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all 
 Rise up, when your back is up against the wall 
 Rise, rise up
