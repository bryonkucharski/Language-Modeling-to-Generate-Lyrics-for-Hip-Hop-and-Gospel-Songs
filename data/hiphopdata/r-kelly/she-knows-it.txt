(R Kelly) 
 She did something to me, I don't know what it is, but when I walked in the club I was like..(all right, uha, owh!) 
 When I first saw shawty in the club she was walkin' through short skirt and stiletto's on 
 Walk right be me with a switch and a hip lookin' at me all sexy turning me on 
 While I'm posted up like a player, folded my arms and rubbed on my chin 
 I am focused on that booty man just plot know how to get in 
 She's a bad girl and I want it 
 She's a bad girl and she knows it 
 Man I give her a ten in a do? 
 It's a rap shit competition no mo? 
 She got the whole club in slowmo? 
 And she knows it... 
 Said she know what she's doin'?, ey... ey... ey... 
 Said she know what she's doin'?, ey... ey... ey..(look at her she know that) 
 Said she know what she's doin'?, ey... ey... ey..(girl is a pro) 
 Said she know what she's doin'?, ey... ey... ey..(oeh oeh) 
 (R Kelly)

 And in case you didn't know I'm a bulls eye man so I'm bout? to hit the target 
 She's goin' lower and lower and I'm aksin' myself how low can she get 
 Than she took it to the flo? and made it clap and I said damn lil' momma's got it 
 She's a bad girl and I want it 
 She's a bad girl and she knows it 
 Man I give her a ten in a do?

 I come from L o n d o n and that's inside the United Kingdom 
 My name is Taio Cruz and I love the way that you do your dance for me, yes! 
 She leaned in close whispered this story wait until I'm out of this dress 
 She's a bad girl and I want it
