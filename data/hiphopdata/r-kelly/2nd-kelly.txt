Hey yo, R. 
 Let me handle my business 
 I just wanna take over the show for a minute 
 Not the whole show, just a little bit 
 Now that he's outta the way 
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 
 Can I break it down and break you off 
 Some of this computer lovin' type of shit 
 Lookin' at you from the inside of this internet 
 I'm in the mood, and my tongue is in the mood 
 Ladies, can we have a little fun? 
 Can we play a little game? 
 Said, can we have a little fun? 
 Can we play a little game? 
 I got something for y'all 
 Can I give it to you? 
 Now listen, 2nd kelly what you got for me, y'all say 
 I got some down low, down low, sing it for me 
 Now 2nd kelly, what you got for me, y'all say 
 I got some 12 play, 12 play, sing it 
 Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, sing 
 I got some bump and grind, bump and grind, sing it y'all 
 Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, say 
 Do you mind if I stroke you up 
 Do you mind if I stroke you down 
 Ladies, ladies, tell me do you want more? 
 I said do you want more? 
 Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na sing 
 Now y'all having fun? 
 Too bad it's time for me to get up out of here 
 But before I do 
 I wanna blow the roof off this place with this last one 
 Are y'all ready? 
 All right, now everybody let me hear you say 
 Ooh na na na na na na 
 Ooh na na na na na na 
 Yeah, now, that was loud, right? 
 But I think y'all can get a little louder 
 If y'all what Kelly to come back out here 
 With what he about to get dressed in 
 Y'll do it louder come on here we go, come on 
 Ooh na na na na an na what 
 Ooh na na na na na na 
 I know y'all must be trippin' on me 
 Damn
