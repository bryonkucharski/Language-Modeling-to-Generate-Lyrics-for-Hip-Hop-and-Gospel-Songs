You bring me joy 
 Night and day 
 Girl you and me should getaway 
 I got a special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone 
 Ooh, baby this love making is so good that I can't picture myself with no one else 
 And girl God is good because he put you here just for myself 
 The way to walk and dress, your smile, your grace and sex 
 Tonight nothing's gonna come between us but sex 
 You bring me joy 
 Night and day 
 Girl you and me should getaway 
 I got a special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone 
 Imagine you and me naked 
 Like a mountain 
 Girl I'm gonna climb all on top of you 
 Like a river 
 I'm gonna be flowing all over you girl 
 And like a horsey 
 I'm gonna saddle up a ride you girl 
 Like a something 
 Something again 
 And our bodies shiver 
 Heaven must have sent your love to me 
 'Cause when I look at you heaven is all I see
