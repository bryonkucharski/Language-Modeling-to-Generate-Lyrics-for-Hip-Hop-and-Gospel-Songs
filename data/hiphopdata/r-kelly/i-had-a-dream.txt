Heard 'em say man wasn't made to fly 
 And when he wanted to go to the moon, 
 They said he wouldn't make it past the sky 
 And with all odds against him 
 They said he'd never reach his goal 
 Said he didn't have the strength 
 To travel that long road 
 But I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 That I made history 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 Now the dream is real to me 
 Heard 'em say that the mountain couldn't be climbed 
 And when ever thers an under dog 
 They count him out every time 
 Some body say that the storm will never... 
 And in the crunch of the game 
 They said that there's no way that team could win 
 But I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 That I made history 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 Now the dream is real to me 
 When the battle seems lost 
 And all your strength is gone 
 Just know that the winds are faithful 
 In carrying you home 
 Just believe in the power 
 The power of Love 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 That I made history 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 I had a dream 
 Now the dream is real to me
