This is my story 
 Yeah, I'm from that Trap-town dirt 
 I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts 
 This is my story 
 Money, cars, bad hoes

 And I'm sticking to it, and I'm sticking to it 
 And I'm sticking to it, and I'm sticking to it 
 Came from humble beginnings 
 Now I'm cocky with my spending 
 They say "life is just a game" 
 And I thank God that I'm winning 
 Models roll my indo 
 I beat the pussy, Django 
 Them niggas talking money 
 I got more digits in my GEICO 
 She make a pole disappear like hokus pokus 
 You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focus 
 I got every block, every street corners sold up 
 Whatever club represent my city, throwed up 
 I own the game, coach slash player shown up 
 Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

 Velcro, I'm sticking to it 
 Hating, I've been a victim to it 
 Your conversation is sanitation 
 Ain't no hesitation when I finna do it 
 I stick it in, switch it up and try to hit a friend 
 Live it up and count my dividends 
 Roll, like cinnamon 
 Whoa, big face Benjamin's as she looked at me 
 Like yeen nothin' but a star 
 I looked at her like this ain't nothin' but a car 
 If you ride with them you ain't going that far 
 But if you ride with me, crib so big we can play hide-and-seek 
 You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat 
 Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot 
 Kiss a ass in both mouth's 
 Them talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips? 
 Drop her ass at the chocolate factory 
 Yeah, we did them 12 play's 
 And you know who you is girl 
 We been fucking since the 12th grade, goddamn

 Pull up to the club at about 3 
 I'm killing it, guilty no plea 
 I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece 
 By 9 O'Clock, we on round three 
 I speak of rain, they say I'm crazy like they didn't know 
 See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar 
 Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes 
 Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the holy ghost 
 They asked them in a interview, "why do he love these girls?" 
 They only thing he had to say was, "motherfuck the world!"
