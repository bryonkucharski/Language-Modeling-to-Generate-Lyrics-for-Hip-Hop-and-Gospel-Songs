How he makes her feel 
 When he look her in the eyes and tell her 
 I love you, yeah 
 He seems so for real 
 When he whispers and says 
 I'll never leave you, no 
 And he speaks them words to her heart 
 And make her feel like she on top 
 Of the world, yeah, oh my 
 Then turn around and break her heart 
 And make her feel like the whole world's on top of her, whoa 
 And now something other made me talk about it 
 When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman 
 Yes he does, yeah 
 I'm just telling the truth 
 When a man lies, he kills every reason 
 She ever had for loving him, yeah 
 Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah 
 How he promised her things 
 While he's making sweet love to her mind 
 Selling big dreams, yeah 
 That's what he do, or he can paint the scene 
 With every word out of his mouth 
 Make her wanna believe, oh she believes 
 That everything that he says is true 
 Now all the dreams she bought and the tales he told 
 Cinderella to the old pot of gold 
 Broke up for a heart and stole the glory 
 And it let me here to tell the story 
 When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman 
 Yes he does, yeah 
 I'm just telling the truth 
 When a man lies, he kills every reason 
 She ever had for loving him, yeah 
 Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah 
 Hey now don't ya all shoot the messenger, nah, nah 
 I was sent here to deliver, whoa 
 Y'all can go ahead and call me a lawyer 
 Call me... to the day I'll represent, the woman 
 'Cause when a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman 
 Yes he does, hey 
 I'm just telling the truth 
 When a man lies, he kills every reason 
 She ever had for loving him, yeah 
 Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah.
