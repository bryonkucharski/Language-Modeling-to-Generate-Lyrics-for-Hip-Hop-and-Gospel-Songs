You know nothin's gettin' done when talk is all you hear 
 Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear 
 But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around 
 He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground 
 Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show 
 When it gets down to it, everybody knows 
 It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done 
 If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun 
 It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts 
 Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work 
 You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground 
 Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down 
 You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night 
 Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light 
 There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get 
 But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat 
 It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done 
 If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun 
 It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts 
 Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work 
 I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm 
 Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door 
 But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half 
 The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin' 
 It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done 
 If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun 
 It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts 
 Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work 
 Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work 
 Ah yeah 
 Gonna getcha 
 Getcha good
