Had the landlord at my door 
 I heard him saying, 
 Tomorrow no more 
 Pay me now or leave 
 But we didn't have anything to give...(ah can you feel me) 
 Searching for restoration...(and we need restoration) 
 Make the church my family 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 And I can sing it all night long... I tell you why because, 
 The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see) 
 The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man) 
 There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto) 
 The ghetto is a part of me 
 Children cry no more...(children cry no more) 
 Because heaven is upon you 
 Please put down your guns 
 And we shall overcome 
 Thought your load may be heavy 
 Know that the weight makes you strong 
 Take my life for example 
 While I sing my song 
 Mr. Kelly help me sing this song... 
 The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see) 
 The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man) 
 There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto) 
 The ghetto is a part of me 
 The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see) 
 The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man) 
 There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto) 
 The ghetto is a part of me 
 La la la la la lala la... 
 La la la la la lala la... 
 La la la la la lala la... 
 The ghetto is a part of me 
 The ghetto is a part of my religion
