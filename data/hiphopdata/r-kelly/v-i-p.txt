Rock on, come on, come on 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 Chillin' at the club 
 Showing niggas how we ball 
 Ever since the drought 
 It's been nothing but the trump 
 Can you really blame me for getting these G's 
 Something I don't understand 
 Why you fools after me, VIP 
 Got the haters after me 
 'Cause I push these V's 
 They wanna be like me 
 If you agree 
 Then raise the roof with me 
 In the party place to be 
 Living VIP 
 Since when did money, oh 
 Become such a problem 
 I just wanna live a life 
 That only involve the numbers, yeah 
 Can you really blame me for getting these G's 
 See what I can't understand 
 Why you fools don't rock with me, VIP 
 I got the haters after me 
 Because I push these V's 
 They wanna be like me 
 If you agree (If you agree) 
 Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me) 
 In the party place to be (In the party place to be) 
 Living VIP 
 Ha ha, nothing but the 
 Stretch Bentleys with the top that's drop, that's right 
 Kelly CD's with the sound that knocks 
 Di di di di di di di 
 When the party rocks 
 Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin' but rocks 
 I know you haters wanna come to Rockland's party 
 But you can't get in unless you VIP 
 Can you really blame me for getting these G's 
 See what I can't understand 
 Why you fools are after me, livin' V 
 So if you're ballin' and you know, raise your hands 
 And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet 
 And if your man ain't spendin' money on you 
 Then ladies, you can come and get with me 
 A little V 
 Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters 
 I mean, I wish I could make a phone call 
 To all the haters around the world 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 This is what I'd say 
 What's goin' on in the world today, huh? 
 Seems like every nigga got beef 'cause they ain't got steak 
 When I ain't had no money see, everything was cool 
 But now that I got a little money and y'all wanna act a fool 
 And none of 'em VIP 
 VIP, I got the haters after me 
 Because I push these V's (What?) 
 They wanna be like me (Raise the roof, y'all) 
 If you agree (Now let's lock) 
 And raise the roof with me 
 (Over this here's, just bring it on) 
 In the party place (Uh, Rockland) 
 To be living VIP, VIP 
 I got the haters after me 
 Because I push these V's 
 They wanna be like me 
 (Wanna be a...)
