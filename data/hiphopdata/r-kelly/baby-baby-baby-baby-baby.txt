Anything you want baby 
 Anything your heart desires 
 Because you've been there for me 
 (Truly there for me) 
 I'm gonna give it to you 
 Listen 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Anything you want, I'm gonna give it to you girl 
 Because when I was down you always lifted up my head 
 Gonna show you all the love I have in store for you 
 I gotta let you know that I am truly down with you, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Like no other homie, you are always there for me 
 The only girl I know that truly satisfies my needs 
 When I was down and out you were hangin' by my side 
 And now that I am holdin' you, you'll always be in my life, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Taking me to church on Sunday morning, girl is cool 
 Because I found a blessing and some happiness in you 
 Whenever there is darkness, G you brighten up my day 
 I thank the Lord for you because you understand my ways, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 When I look at you I see the breaking of the day 
 I'm mighty glad to know that Heaven sent your love my way 
 It's something about the way you do your lovin' when you do 
 And now until forever, baby, I'll be lovin' you, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 You were always there for me - you know what I'm saying? 
 So today I'm taking you out - buy you something real nice 
 I'm gonna be here for you until the day becomes the night 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 From the bottom of my heart, yes promise me we'll never part 
 Let's say a prayer together, say a prayer together baby 
 Can we say a prayer together baby 
 Heavenly Father which art in heaven 
 I pray that you keep this love together 
 This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you
