Can't you see we were meant to be, oh baby 
 Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby 
 Let me know if you're out of my life 
 (Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye 
 I used to be the one that you could call on 
 Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off 
 Memories like the corner of my mind 
 You know just what to do to make my love come down 
 I know just what you need, but you don't come around 
 Let me know if you're out of my life 
 Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby 
 I used to be the one that you could call on 
 Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your lovin' baby 
 Look at what you're doing to me baby (2x's) 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off 
 I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby 
 If chances are that I'm gonna fall off
