Baby, is it all right if I break it down and give you something romantic? 
 I figured since it's raining, this would be the perfect time for us... 
 Can you hear the sounds of the, love angels calling us 
 Sweet violins and harps playing, then suddenly there's this kiss of trust 
 Dapper then the morning dew, tonight has chosen me and you 
 And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true 
 I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing, a full orchestra and a choir singing 
 The oceans calm and the rivers flowing, it feels so good, keep on going 
 Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love 
 We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us 
 Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love 
 We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us 
 Can you see the flowers blooming, slowly as the seasons change 
 The gift of joy is founded when I softly hear you call my name 
 Rose petals, and all these oils, surrounded by 100 candles 
 An eagle delivers a letter that says the night will last forever 
 Dapper then the morning dew, tonight has chosen me and you 
 And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come true 
 I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing, a full orchestra and a choir singing 
 The oceans calm and the rivers flowing, don't you stop, keep on going 
 Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love 
 We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us 
 Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love 
 We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us 
 Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows then suddenly a rainbow... 
 And an ocean filled with white sailboats and huge waterfalls that overflow 
 See those in well are fairytales, I will buck for love 
 And imagine far away from here in a land where the sky cries joyful tears 
 Baby another words... Will you marry me?
