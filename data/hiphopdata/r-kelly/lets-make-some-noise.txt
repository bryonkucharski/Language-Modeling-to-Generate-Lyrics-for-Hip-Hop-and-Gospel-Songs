Welcome to the quiet before the storm 
 No worries, love 
 Oh yeah, ain't no pressure 
 Baby when I'm fuckin' you 
 The whole world can get tuned out 
 Like we've been smokin' on that loud 
 Cloud 9, we on 
 Both in the zone, yeah 
 Oh baby, sounds you make when I sllllllrp 
 Sounds so good, rewind them 
 Your man callin', decline him 
 I kill that pussy every time, bang bang 
 The thing I like about you 
 Is baby girl you're freaky too 
 Till I hear the sirens 
 All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin' 
 Let's make some noise 
 Let's make some noise 
 We'll be bangin' on the wall 
 Till they hear it down the hall 
 Till them sirens goin' off 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 And I love the noise we're makin' 
 So let's keep on doin' it, baby 
 Tell me how you feel inside, tell me 
 I like the way you fill inside 
 Can you keep it up all night? 
 I wanna keep this up all night 
 You know I am down to right 
 'Cause I like the view from here 
 Say this pussy is the end all, be all 
 Riding that thing just like a seesaw all night 
 You know that I'm small, so baby, break me off 
 I know you just got off work 
 But now it's time to get me off 
 See the thing I like about you 
 Is baby, you are freaky too 
 So until we hear them sirens 
 I'ma be screaming your name 
 Let's make some noise 
 Let's make some noise 
 We'll be bangin' on the wall 
 Till they hear it down the hall 
 Till them sirens goin' off 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 And I love the noise we're makin' 
 So let's keep on doin' it, baby 
 Shhh I'm deep off in it, stammering 
 Got your legs shaking like a tambourine 
 And I'ma be doing it till the morning 
 When the morning come give you more dick 
 Feel it, can you take all these inches? 
 In it, you go from 0 to a hundred when I kiss it 
 And I know the neighbors gotta hate our guts 
 'Cause we be making all kinds of noises when we fuck 
 See the thing I like about you 
 Is baby girl you're freaky too 
 Till I hear the sirens 
 All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin' 
 Let's make some noise 
 Let's make some noise 
 We'll be bangin' on the wall 
 Till they hear it down the hall 
 Till them sirens goin' off 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 We'll be makin' some noise 
 And I love the noise we're makin' 
 Let's keep on doin' it, baby 
 Let's keep on making these noises 
 Let's keep on making these noises 
 Let's keep on making these noises 
 Let's keep on making these noises 
 Let's keep on making these noises
