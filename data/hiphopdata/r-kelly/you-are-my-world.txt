Why you insecure 
 When you know how love is pure 
 And why is it so hard to trust 
 When we vowed that we'd be forever in love girl 
 And when the morning comes you'll see I'll still be right by your side 
 And you don't have to worry cause baby girl you're all mine 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 Got to believe me 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 Tell me why 
 Should you ever have to wonder who's gon' love you right here for you 
 Girl tell me why 
 Should you ever have to question who's not gon' be loving you 
 Oh girl 
 Oh I 
 And when the morning comes you'll see I'll still be right by your side 
 And you don't have to worry cause baby girl you're all mine 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 Got to believe me 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 Here and now 
 Cast all your fears away, girl 
 Take my hand and we will fly away 
 Baby don't you know that you are my world 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl 
 You are my world 
 My heaven 
 My whole girl
