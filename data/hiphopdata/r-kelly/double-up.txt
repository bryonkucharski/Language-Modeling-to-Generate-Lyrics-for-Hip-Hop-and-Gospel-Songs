Step up out the club with a dizzy head 
 I got two chicks both got dizzy legs 
 I'm bout to double up 
 You know I'm bout to double up 
 Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide 
 I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back 
 I'm bout to double up 
 And you know I'm bout to double up 
 Double up 
 I fall though the spot 
 Kelz on the prowl 
 I see these honies and they dancing all wild 
 All up on each other windin real freaky 
 I'm plottin how I'm gonna take 'em home with me 
 Maybe her cousin maybe her girlfriend 
 I just wanna get 'em both up out of here 
 Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib 
 Start off in my game room 
 Pop a little bub 
 Then have 'em dance for me like they danced in the club 
 Ooh they so freaky and both of 'em horny 
 Shots of tequila puff some dro and now they ready 
 Her girl holla out we're best friends 
 And then I holla out y'all look like twins 
 Ain't no competition y'all a couple of tens 
 And then they say Kelz tell us whatcha wanna do 
 Well I'm about to double up with you and you 
 Step up out the club with a dizzy head 
 I got two chicks both got dizzy legs 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 You know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm) 
 Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide 
 I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 And you know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm) 
 Double up 
 Pimpin' don't stop when I walk up in the club 
 See a girl with a girl and try and get a group hug 
 Get em' to the hotel 
 Get some group love 
 Her (her) me man I just can't get enough 
 All up in my tub 
 Steady poppin' bub 
 Who is she to you and she replied "First 'cause" 
 Man I could tell they so naughty, naughty 
 The way they took me down like a forty, forty 
 One in the bed and one in the chair 
 One massage my toes while one braid my hair 
 In the private spot like two of these playas 
 In the car lot like two of these playas 
 Hatas saying damn how he doin' this playa 
 Doublin up for me is like routine playa 
 I'm a go getta 
 Mix 'em up like I'm a deala 
 Man three's company bitch call me jack trippa 
 Step up out the club with a dizzy head 
 I got two chicks both got dizzy legs 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 You know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm) 
 Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide 
 I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 And you know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm) 
 Double up 
 I'm back up in the VIP 
 In a cloud of smoke 
 Be poundin surrounded by all my folks 
 Give me another shot 
 Damn the music loud 
 I'm bout to mix it up and blend in in the crowd 
 Grip slip slide by the dance floor 
 Baby grab me by my hand say she wanna dance OH! (oh!) 
 Is that ya girlfriend peepin me out? 
 Sho nuff it must be 'cause now she freakin me out 
 She get behind a nigga 
 Grindin on a nigga 
 Touchin on me 
 Whisperin in my ears 
 Damn it sound lovely 
 I'm infatuated 
 We evacuated 
 Now we at the crib it's 
 Two for the money that's the life I live 
 Kiss me, kiss her, now kiss each other 
 It's a trip the way y'all make these chicks twist each other 
 Take your shirt off 
 Now ima take hers off too 
 It's double or nuttin baby that's how tha boss do 
 Step up out the club with a dizzy head 
 I got two chicks both got dizzy legs 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 You know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm) 
 Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide 
 I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back 
 I'm bout to double up (One on each arm) 
 And you know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm)
