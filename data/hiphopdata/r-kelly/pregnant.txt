Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up 
 Usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man 
 And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand 
 See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates 
 But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight 
 Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty 
 Sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie 
 I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while 
 And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child 
 Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off 
 But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog 
 Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress 
 I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up 
 All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me 
 How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese 
 Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies 
 I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies 
 Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous 
 We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin' 
 Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew 
 I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too 
 And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe 
 So come on ladies let's get up out of this club 
 Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party 
 Come on f*** with us 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up 
 Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby 
 So tell me that you want me, baby, baby 
 And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines 
 And girl, I promise I will make you my mine 
 Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks 
 And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid 
 Sounds like heaven's callin' us 
 And girl, well, it's about makin' love 
 If you choose me I guarantee 
 That the rest of your life would be man drama free 
 I think both of us should leave this club 
 And get somewhere alone with me 
 Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up 
 Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up 
 Your city, my city don't matter, give it up 
 Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby 
 Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby 
 You can play all you want but I know you feel it too 
 For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms 
 In New York meetin' with the realtor 
 There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it 
 Oh girl, I'ma take care of you 
 And I'ma still hold you like we brand new 
 So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks 
 I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up 
 Take you out to eat, wine and dine 
 Shoppin' spree, you sexin' me 
 See, I'm not cheap or selfish, babe 
 Girl, I'm just thurstin' for that booty, babe 
 And it's all your fault, baby, you look so good 
 It's all your fault that it feels like wood 
 And you look so bored up in this club so let's go 
 We can hop in the Lamborghini, roll to my big home 
 Shorty let's go crazy, let's make a lil' Kelly 
 Baby, I got goodies and I want you to have some 
 I ask that you let me explore your secret garden 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant 
 Lay your body down and get you pregnant 
 Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up
