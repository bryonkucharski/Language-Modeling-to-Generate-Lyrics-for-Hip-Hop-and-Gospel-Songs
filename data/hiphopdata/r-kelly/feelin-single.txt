I can't believe you're playing me like this, 
 I thought the love we shared, the good times we've had. Remember? 
 Yeah 
 Feels like it's over, 
 My heart tells me she's in love with someone else. 
 Gave me the cold shoulder 
 But that's her loss, 'cause I can find me somebody else 
 If she wanna hit the town 
 And party all night with her friends 
 If she wanna fool around 
 Then two can play that game, baby 
 You got me feeling single, 
 About to get up. 
 Find somebody 
 Who's gonna love me, girl. 
 Feeling single, 
 Night is young, 
 Hit the club 
 Take somebody home with me 
 Get it, get it 
 Get it, get it 
 We can get it, baby 
 Get it, get it 
 Now I'm better single 
 She said 'forever' 
 Turned out to be the biggest lie 
 Of all time 
 And she changed my weather 
 Rainin' all day 
 No chance of sunshine 
 If she wanna hit the town 
 And party all night with her friends. 
 If she wanna fool around, 
 Then two can play that game, baby 
 You got me feeling single 
 Feeling single, 
 About to get up. 
 Find somebody 
 Who's gonna love me. 
 Feeling single, 
 Night is young, 
 Hit the club 
 And take somebody home with me. 
 Get it, get it 
 Get it, get it 
 Till the morning, baby 
 Get it get it 
 Now I'm better single 
 The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right 
 About me, baby girl. 
 And I might as well (I might as well) 
 I might as well get out a mingle, girl 
 Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single 
 Yeah 
 And I don't wanna do it, baby, 
 But you're gonna make me 
 Find somebody 
 Who's gonna love me, 
 Treat me right, baby 
 Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby. 
 And she's gonna love me, baby 
 And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby
