(R. Kelly) 
 A lot of these cats out here be fakin 
 When it comes to makin' love 
 But you and me baby 
 This is real... 
 And that's why it's... 
 (Number one) 
 Sex that we're having 
 Here girl 
 Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
 Sex that we're having here girl 
 You better ask somebody... 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Can't nobody do it like us 
 Can't nobody mix chop and screw it like us 
 All over the living room hittin it like us 
 In the middle of the night wake up the building like us 
 But it's oookay if you wanna brag 
 The sex so good 
 Go and pat yourself on the back 
 And them haaaters, they gon hate 
 But we just gon keep on blowing up cause girl 
 They gon hate, anyway 
 You are now rocking with the best (best, best, best...) 
 I'll make you forget about the rest 
 Having sex with you is like makin' hits 
 Girl we got egos they can't tell us that we ain't the shit 
 I'm in your mix like a number one record 
 And the beat goes on and on 
 And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day 
 And I love it when you take me down and make me say-ay... 
 (Number one) 
 Sex that we're having 
 Here girl 
 Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
 Sex that we're having here girl, oh 
 Keri! 
 (Keri Hilson) 
 You know you stay at the top spot 
 When you're breaking me down like a chop shop, eh 
 Cutting like some blades on a caddy 
 That's how you're working me, daddy 
 Everytime you put that on 
 You are now rocking with the best 
 I'll make you forget about your ex 
 This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first 
 I know what I'm doing ain't no need to rehearse yeah-ee-yeah 
 A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast 
 But you be steady cruising like you want it to last 
 That's how you made me a chocoholic 
 And right now my body's calling 
 I gotta know how you got the knowhow 
 Baby you the champ of all that goes down 
 If your ---- was a gun it would stone cold? 
 With my RNB thug when I bang bang 
 You know Kells and Keri hook up like that you make it number one 
 (Number one) 
 Sex that we're having 
 Here girl 
 Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
 Sex that we're having here girl, oh 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Hands down you the best 
 Ain't no competition 
 You and me in this bed 
 Just what I was wishin 
 Them other girls was cool but it's somethin' they was missin' 
 And I don't call them back every since we hit it in the kitchen 
 That night 
 At my home 
 Trench coat 
 Nothin' on 
 Your sex 
 Got me gone 
 Went straight 
 To my dome 
 And I love it woo 
 Girl I love it woo 
 And I love it woo 
 Girl I love it woo 
 Girl it's somethin' about you that thrills me 
 That's why after we lay you get to know the real me-e-e-yeah 
 And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day 
 And I love it when you take me down and make me say 
 Ey 
 (Number one) 
 Sex that we're having 
 Here girl 
 Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
 Sex that we're having here girl, oh 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Girl I vow that I would do anything to pleasure you 
 All I wanna do is make this last 
 I'll kiss you up I kiss you down 
 Be real quiet or making sounds 
 Take it slow or take it fast 
 And woo 
 And wee 
 And yoouuu 
 And me 
 Havin' fun 
 And when it's over in the morning I'll say gracias baby 
 Before you go I'll scream damelo 
 (Num-num-number one, number one 
 This is, this is number one)
