Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R 
 Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R 
 I ain't a doctor, can't save a life 
 To say I could I'd be outta my mind 
 I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles 
 That's another thing I won't even try 
 See, there's a lot of things that I can't do 
 Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of 
 But in a couple of categories I do 
 I blow the competition out of the water 
 There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true 
 Number 1 is music and baby girl 
 Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 I ain't a painter, ain't got a brush 
 To paint a portrait of love 
 I ain't no pilot, can't take you up 
 So you can fly through the heavens above 
 See, there's a lot of things I can't do 
 Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of 
 But in a couple of categories I do 
 I blow the competition out of the water 
 There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true 
 Number 1 is music and baby girl 
 Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer 
 Come in health club and baby, let me train you 
 Bend it over, stretch, stretch, stretch 
 Baby, let me you train you 
 I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer 
 Come in health club and baby, let me train you 
 Bend it over, stretch, stretch, stretch 
 Baby, let me you train you 
 There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true 
 Number 1 is music and baby girl 
 Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do 
 Gonna make your body say 
 Come on baby, baby, oh baby 
 Forget about it, baby 
 Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R
