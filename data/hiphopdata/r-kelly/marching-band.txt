King of R&B, R. Kelly 
 Juicy J in the building 
 Whoa 
 Grab on it 
 Turn you over, find that spot like there's a map on it 
 Call my (?) will be the way that shawty snaps on it 
 I keep that pussy cummin' like I ran a tab on it 
 Hey we in here flexin' like it's nothin' 
 Runnin' and we bumpin' 
 Booty so big got a nigga hearin' trumpets 
 Sit it on my face like ba-da-bum-bum-bum 
 Make shawty make it clap like ba-da-bum-bum-bum 
 I'm gone throw this cash here, we gone lap it up 
 Purple on deck baby, we can smoke it up 
 She know what she doin' in that see through lingerie 
 I'mma have this room soundin' like a Mardi Gras parade 
 She blow me like a tuba 
 I beat it up like a snare drum 
 That girl make me want it 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 I know the neighbors next door can feel that base 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 She like it on her chin like a violin 
 And she be dancin' like a Majorette 
 Wetter than a river and I'm divin' in 
 Everyday a good day for sex 
 Four in the mornin' just like two in the evenin' 
 Take her into my world now ain't no way she leavin' 
 Give her just what she need 
 Take her smoke and a breather 
 Ass soft as a feather, I TKO it, Mayweather 
 In the lobby Four Seasons with like ten or twelve broads 
 All headed to my suite, it's a million thot march 
 Only thing we ain't about to do is sleep 
 Beat it like a drum, it sound like we at a Jamboree 
 She blow me like a tuba 
 I beat it up like a snare drum 
 That girl make me want it 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 I know the neighbors next door can feel that base 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 After the party she gone leave with me 
 Yeah we gone lay up for the freakin' weekend 
 And I'mma have her soundin' like a symphany 
 After the party she gone leave with me 
 Yeah we gone lay up for the freakin' weekend 
 And I'mma have her soundin' like a symphany 
 She blow me like a tuba 
 I beat it up like a snare drum 
 That girl make me want it 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 I know the neighbors next door can feel that base 
 Cause every time we in the bed room 
 It be soundin' like a marching band 
 It be soundin' like a marching band
