Hey 
 You baddest in your city I'm the realest in my city 
 All my home boys rich all your home girls pretty 
 Pull up all doors up in that Lamborghini 
 Wish I could fuck 'em all 
 Just playing but anything goes 
 When you a fine little bitch 
 And she bad like this 
 Anything goes 
 With a nigga this rich 
 And it shine like this 
 Anything goes 
 Anything goes 
 Anything goes 
 Anything goes 
 When the diamonds on your wrist 
 And the engine sounds like this 
 And you drive slow just so they can see you 
 Girl when you got ass like that 
 And a pretty face just to match 
 I'm fly you out just to see you 
 You like to go shopping 
 I like it when you're topless 
 I'm being serious but anything goes 
 Girl you already 
 And when I say anything, anything 
 You baddest in the city I'm the realest in the set 
 Yeah 
 All we ever do is smoke weed take shots and have sex 
 I pull up on 4 G's in that Maserati 
 Said you had to go to work but you still gave me top 
 Yeah 
 You know I like that type of shit 
 I know you like that (?) 
 These hoes so jealous of you and me 
 What about the passion got up on her shoulder right now 
 Right now 
 She probably don't know I know you (?) to her 
 Anything goes 
 That bullet on your wrist 
 And your engine sounds like this 
 And you drive slow just so they can see you 
 Girl when you got ass like that 
 And a pretty face just to match 
 I'm fly you out just to see you 
 You like to go shopping 
 I like it when you're topless 
 I'm being serious but anything goes 
 Girl you already 
 And when I say anything, anything 
 Pull up in that time machine 
 Ain't shit I would change though 
 I could buy your whole life 
 And still have me some change though 
 I'm just serious 
 'Cause I'm, tired of playing with nigga's 
 Anything goes if you try me nigga 
 I throw a cheque boy I'm talking 8 figures 
 I put a pool on a jet 
 I save her number as elevator cause that shit went down when we met 
 Cause anything goes 
 Behind closed door 
 Legs in the air clothes on the floor 
 Shit I love when I meet a girl just like me 
 Cause anything goes 
 When the bitches look like twins 
 But they say they're just best friends 
 Then you know damn well they both want you 
 'Bout a hundred bottles of that Henny 
 And you've had one too many 
 And that Ihop is the only thing left to do 
 Girl what you gonna order 
 'Cause I know my order 
 You hurry her no particular order 
 Anything goes 
 If it wasn't for the finest cars and all the things I got 
 They would say no, they would say no 
 And nigga that's real talk 
 That's why I'm quick to tell these hoes walk 
 You've had one, you've had them all 
 Till she came along 
 And she just changed my mind 
 'Cause I love her demeanor 
 Man I knew when I see her 
 I fuck around put a ring on her finger 
 Anything goes 
 When I'm feeling crazy 
 Might just fly you to Haiti 
 Might go half on a baby 
 You never know 
 Anything goes 
 When the diamonds on your wrist 
 And the engine sounds like this 
 And you drive slow just so they can see you 
 Girl when you got ass like that 
 And a pretty face just to match 
 I'm fly you out just to see you 
 You like to go shopping 
 I like it when you're topless 
 I'm being serious but anything goes 
 Girl you already
