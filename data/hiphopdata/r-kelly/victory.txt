Seems like the more I climb the hill gets deeper 
 And the more I rise see I get deeper 
 It's like the more I give see the more is taken 
 And the more I'm loved the more I'm hated 
 Still the more I fall the more I'll get up 
 And keep on driving when the road gets tough 
 And I won't stop till I get what's mine 
 But un till then 
 See I'm 
 Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains 
 I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change 
 Putting out the fire indure it to the end 
 They will come and I will shout victory 
 Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains 
 I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change 
 Putting out the fire in dure to the end 
 They will come and I will shout victory 
 Seems like the more I win the more I lose 
 The more my minds made up the more I'm confused 
 It's like the more that I search the more I get lost 
 And just when I get on seems like I fall off 
 But the more it rains the more I pray 
 'Cause I know tomorrow will bring a brighter day 
 So I won't stop till I get what's mine 
 But un till then 
 I'm 
 Tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains 
 I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change 
 Putting out the fire in dure it to the end 
 They will come and I will shout victory 
 I'm 
 Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains 
 I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change 
 Putting out the fire in dure it end 
 They will come and I will shout victory 
 When the morning comes I will rise 
 There a angel for me in the sky 
 As long as heavens right by my side 
 I'm 
 Tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains 
 I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change 
 Putting out the fire in dure it to the end 
 They will come and I will shout victory
