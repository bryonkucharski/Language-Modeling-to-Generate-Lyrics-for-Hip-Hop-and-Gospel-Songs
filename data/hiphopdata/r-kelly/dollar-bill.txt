Unstoppable, Trackmasters, Rockland, come on 
 Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch 
 Get up in yo' ass and ride that shit 
 Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady? 
 Let's go half on this baby 
 Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a Swiss ho' 
 Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo'? 
 Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her? 
 Nothin'. Hey, do a somersault 
 All that platinum shit you bought? 
 Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault 
 Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky 
 Next time you see me, address me like "Miss Foxy" 
 It's for the wrist cop it, if it's a six drop it 
 Thongs with topless how you like that Robbie? 
 Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style 
 From the back, in the back, hit it like that 
 The dollar bill 
 Nothin' but stacks get you anything 
 Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill 
 Say what you want baby 
 While you be stalling at the lights 
 We be dippin in Mercedes 
 Dollar bill 
 Can get us from here to Rio 
 In two hours first class still time to take a shower 
 The dollar bill 
 Where ever we be it's VIP stats, no doubt 
 So what y'all cats know about that 
 Say lady, I'm liking what I see 
 Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby 
 Can't you see one night is all I need 
 We'll go somewhere and be 
 Talkin' about your future plans with me 
 I would do anything 
 To have you in my life, that's right 
 We can take a flight out of here go anywhere 
 Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12 
 Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth 
 Put some in the vault CD's overseas 
 Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust 
 Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill' 
 But it's my fault I got my own label deal 
 Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's 
 On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na 
 Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day 
 From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that? 
 A lotta sass and ass with that 
 And I'm strickly for the dough 
 So fuck you think I'm here fo'? 
 Princesses in a row, row platinum status 
 Ice lace to pink face 
 Then I back the faggots 
 See me rocking aye'thang from Mongolians to Persians 
 Y'all still learning, I got ¡Rem swervin', through a sermon 
 And there's nothin' you can tell me 'bout these cats that I 
 Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack 
 Must I continue this? 
 Might be a couple of cats that I miss 
 We could skip the French kiss, take it straight to the wrist 
 And it gets no iller than this 
 Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice 
 Did y'all niggas hear me right? 
 Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chitown 
 His town to my town, for the dollar bill 
 The dollar bill 
 Nothin' but stacks get you anything 
 Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill 
 Say what you want baby 
 While you be stalling at the lights 
 We be dippin in Mercedes 
 Dollar bill 
 Can get us from here to Rio 
 In two hours first class still time to take a shower 
 The dollar bill 
 Where ever we be it's VIP stats, no doubt 
 So what y'all cats know about that 
 Tell me who dat said dat we couldn't rock 
 I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop 
 I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block 
 I bless the day that R&B music meet hip hop 
 You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot 
 Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not 
 Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block 
 Merridian CD's with five TV's 
 College honeys follow in your GS3 
 We on the way to IHOP, coming from the spot 
 Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock 
 Y'all mad 'cause you can't get what we got 
 Who's the number one contender, January through December? 
 Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin' Timothy 
 Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami 
 Banks know me, so I could give a damn about the Grammies 
 The dollar bill 
 Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all 
 The dollar bill 
 Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all 
 The dollar bill 
 Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all 
 The dollar bill 
 Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all 
 The dollar bill, Track Masters, Rockland
