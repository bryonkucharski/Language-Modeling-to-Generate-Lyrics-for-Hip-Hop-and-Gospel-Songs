Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody 
 And I mean every, every, every 
 Take your time, we got all night 
 Trust in me I'm gonna get it right 
 Whatever's on, take it off 
 I wanna get inside with you baby and get lost 
 And the more I lay with you 
 I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do 
 And I don't care if they leave this room 
 'Cause we'll be... 
 Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody 
 And I mean every, every, every 
 The way we touch, the way we kiss 
 Oh girl I love it when it feels like this 
 Just forget what you had to do 
 Cause the night is all about me and you 
 And the more I lay with you 
 I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do 
 And I don't care if they leave this room 
 'Cause we'll be... 
 Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody 
 And I mean every, every, every 
 So open the window baby 
 I don't care if the world hears us baby 
 Cause as long as you're here lyin' next to me 
 Girl, we can lay on the floor 
 Don't need any privacy 
 Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody 
 Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody 
 Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody 
 When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
