This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty 
 Hey pretty mama how you doing? 
 Said I'm just in town for the weekend 
 Looking for a little trouble to get into 
 Baby tell me what you're drinking 
 And I got you, ooh 
 Playas wanna play 
 Ballers wanna ball 
 Rollers wanna roll 
 But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty 
 Now your body's got me feelin' like spending 
 With a backroom I could come to live in 
 And your hair weave looking kind of pretty 
 The way you back it up on me baby 
 God have mercy 
 Playas wanna play 
 Ballers wanna ball 
 Rollers wanna roll 
 But I'm taking off after I dance, yeah 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty 
 If it's your birthday 
 Then put your hands up 
 You wanna get drunk 
 Then put your hands up 
 And if you got some cash 
 Then put your hands up 
 Have your own job 
 Put your hands up 
 Playas wanna play 
 Ballers wanna ball 
 Rollers wanna roll 
 Feel so good, say it again 
 Playas wanna play 
 Ballers wanna ball 
 Rollers wanna roll 
 But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to the dance floor 
 We begin to dance slow 
 Put your arms around me 
 I'm feelin' on your booty
