Yeah, like I was saying 
 I ain't, ya know what 
 I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you 
 You know what I'm saying 
 I don't wanna hurt you, baby 
 Just sometimes you do things 
 That push me to say things I don't wanna say 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 You know I love you 
 You know I care about you 
 This time, you just brought it on yourself 
 Yo, check it out 
 Now I shoulda been more man 
 About the way things went down 
 Especially since we been dealin' 
 For like seven years now 
 I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down 
 No conversation, no good sex in a while 
 But still you search and find a way 
 To love me somehow 
 Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow 
 Got my faces, some ice and a tie 
 Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down 
 (I don't mean it) When I hollar at you 
 (I don't mean it) When I say that we're through 
 (I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through 
 (I don't mean it) Baby 
 (I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry 
 (I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me 
 (I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning 
 (I don't mean it) I don't mean it 
 Running around here talking about 
 How I'm a big player now 
 Hidden in corners, blinging out our share 
 Kelly makin' hits now 
 Thinking about this industry 
 And how I put it out 
 You were there for me 
 When I used dish rags for ties 
 There's times that I didn't hear you 
 I was talkin' too loud 
 When I didn't come home 
 I was hanging with the crowd 
 Whenever we fight I try to win every round 
 Can you find a way to forgive me now 
 (I don't mean it) 'Cause I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it) When I hollar at you 
 (I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through 
 (I don't mean it) Whoa 
 (I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive 
 (I don't mean it) Ooh baby, I 
 (I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin' 
 (I don't mean it) Ooh I don't mean it 
 Father, can you help me? 
 What do you need from me? 
 I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely 
 I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly 
 You been so demanding 
 You need to read my word, son 
 And get some understanding 
 But I been busy with my music 
 Stop making excuses 
 Recognize the love she gives 
 And try not to abuse it 
 Is it too late to get her back? 
 Not as long as I'm a fact 
 Well father, show me a sign 
 That will make her mine 
 (I don't mean it) I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through 
 (I don't mean it) Or whenever I hollar at you 
 (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 (I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby 
 (I don't mean it) See what was straight is now SLANTED 
 (I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh 
 (I don't mean it) Whoa 
 (I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it) I put it on my life 
 (I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price 
 (I don't mean it) When I was down and out 
 (I don't mean it) You reached out your hand 
 (I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman 
 (I don't mean it) To raise a man 
 (I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby 
 (I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you baby
