Worldwide 
 Right about now 
 We ain't gon' leave 'til four in the morning 
 Thousand dollar tab, what? I can afford it 
 On my fourth drink, but I'm not an alcoholic 
 Shawty say she want me, she way too scrawny 
 5'4" Park, I might be too horny to go home lonely, I can't be lonely 
 Left the last club 'cause the DJ was boring 
 Came back, valet parked in the valet parking 
 Nigga, true story, that was 12:40, 'bout 1 o'clock I was back in the wary 
 Tipsy, Ferrari, Tennessee got me, oh baby, I'm so sorry 
 But if you're drinking what I'm drinking 
 Put your hands up in the sky 
 If you're thinking what I'm thinking 
 You'll say what a crazy night 
 Way oh 
 (Hey) 
 Way oh 
 (Hey) 
 Way oh 
 (Hey) 
 Way oh, a what a crazy night, way oh 
 We ain't gon' leave 'til four maybe later 
 Swag so punk it make, it make ya ugly face, uh 
 Run that back, it means start that over 
 Shawty, get closer, hot like a toaster 
 Body so tight like she walked off the poster 
 Kells caked up, make her call me the baker 
 Man, he a hater, she gon' see me later 
 He got good intentions but not another favor 
 We left doing 80, called up, fly up on a Friday 
 Headed back the highway, I think that there's my place 
 So fucked up, man, it's just not my day 
 I need another shot of that Bacardi 
 But if you're drinking what I'm drinking 
 Put your hands up in the sky 
 If you're thinking what I'm thinking 
 You'll say what a crazy night 
 Way oh

 Nice young lady 
 And she already talking 'bout having my baby

 She waan me tickle her fancy up in a me back seat 
 Sexy body gal looking all foxy 
 Posted up in front a di speaker 
 Inna pum pum shorts and a wife beater 
 Now this is why I just had to meet her 
 Wine and dine so that I can freak, freak her 
 Next week her den delete her 
 Man, a shotta yute gal, you are not a keeper 
 But if you're drinking what I'm drinking 
 Put your hands up in the sky

 You'll say what a crazy night
