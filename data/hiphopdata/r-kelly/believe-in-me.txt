Baby, if we're gonna make it 
 We're gonna make it together 
 That's right, you can do this 
 I'll been gone for a minute, no you can't take it 
 The Lords walkin' with me so, I'm gonna make it 
 Girl dry your eyes, Baby be strong 
 Look at me I'm gonna really need ya to be strong 
 Girl for the both of us, and for our family 
 I can make it if you just stay beside me 
 Hold it together up until my returning 
 Light a candle, read a scripture from a journey 
 I know that heavens gonna make a way for me 
 So write a kiss on a letter send it to me 
 An I'ma think about ya everyday 
 But until the sun shine my way 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me 
 Gil, while I'm gone just know 
 I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back

 Wait on me and I'll come back to you 
 Ya so tough, smile through this sh, and Baby walk with ya head up 
 Don't let 'em tell ya that's the end of me (no no) 
 I'll be back just like the boomerang 
 You ain't really gotta worry 'bout nothing 
 I'm not a dummy, I stashed something (baby) 
 For you an me girl when I get out 
 And believe me I'm gonna get out 
 And I'm gon take you straight out the hood 
 You gotta know this ain't forever babe 
 You gotta know we goin' make it to a better place 
 Until then I'll be thinkin' 'bout you everyday 
 Till the sun shine my way 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me 
 And whenever I'm gone just know 
 I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back 
 Girl I'll be back for you

 Wait on me and I'll come back to you 
 Girl save ya strength you're gonna need it to be there for me 
 All odds against us and I hope you still believe in me 
 'Cause I believe in us you know I'm all about our destiny 
 And let no man take us under. Rise to our victory, 
 Turn back the hand of time, reminisce the memories 
 Put yo hand in mine walk with me spiritually 
 In a minute of the storm with the pourin' rain 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me 
 Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me (in me) 
 And whenever I'm gone just know
