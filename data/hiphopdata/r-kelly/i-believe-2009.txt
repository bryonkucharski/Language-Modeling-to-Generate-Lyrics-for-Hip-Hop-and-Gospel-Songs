I Believe lyrics By R. KELLY 
 Barack obama: 
 In small towns and big cities 
 We came together 
 As democrats, republicans, and independents 
 To stand up and say that we are 
 ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE 
 And our time for changed has COME... 
 R. kelly: 
 When the mountain seems too high 
 And you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb 
 And the road you're on won't end 
 But still you run though you cannot see the finish line 
 And dark clouds are over you 
 Your skies no longer blue 
 But you marched on straight ahead 
 Somehow you made it through 
 Got to the mountain peek 
 They left a path of me 
 Your victory made history and now 
 I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh I 
 When it felt like you were weak 
 And couldn't fight no more 
 On the ropes and it seemed like 
 You was gonna run out of breathe 
 When the world was on your shoulder 
 And the walls were in your way 
 You leaped and made it over 
 Through it all you kept the faith 
 With hope you set us free 
 You showed us how to dream 
 And now we can lift our voices 
 And forever sing 
 Now's the time to look ahead 
 And thank our hero's of the past 
 And celebrate this history 
 Let's raise the flag cause 
 I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh I 
 And when they tried to keep you down 
 You kept up your head 
 Never losing sight 
 You believed in what was right 
 You endured to the end 
 Walked through the strongest wind 
 The storm's over 
 And a new day begins 
 And when our hope was dying 
 You brought us healing 
 And now I got something 
 To tell my children 
 I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe 
 Oh I
