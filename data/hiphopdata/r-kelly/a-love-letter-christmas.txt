Do do do do do do do do do 
 This is a Christmas remix 
 And it's sang 
 La la la la la la la la la la 
 Baby 
 Did you get my card 
 Did you read my love letter 
 Did it touch your heart 
 When you read my love letter 
 Pour the wine, read the signs 
 Baby, it's Christmas time 
 You and me underneath this tree 
 Candle stories told 
 Kisses under mistletoe 
 And everyone's asking their family 
 Did you get my card (Christmas card) 
 Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter) 
 Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl) 
 When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter) 
 Sleigh bells, sweet dreams 
 Kids are sleep, you and me 
 Wrap the gifts I can't wait till morning 
 'Cause, this moment's so heaven sent 
 Marshmallows, hot chocolate 
 FIreplace, you and me cuddling 
 Did you get my card (Christmas card) 
 Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter) 
 Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl) 
 When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter) 
 (My hope is) I hope these words find you 
 I wrote this letter according to my love for you 
 So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are 
 You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box 
 Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love 
 Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder 
 If you are reading this I hope that things are well 
 And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail 
 Did you get my card (My Christmas card, yeah baby) 
 Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter, girl) 
 Did it touch your heart (When you read it) 
 When you read my love letter (My love)
