My time, my patience, my love 
 My blood, my sweat, my tears 
 My burdens, my drama, my pain 
 My car, my money, my home 
 My ups, my downs, my fears 
 And my hours, my work, my strength 
 My fault, my this, my that 
 Nigga please 
 If you don't stop 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna lay in your bed 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna eat your food 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna wear your clothes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna fit your shoes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna get your keys 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna open your doors 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna get your check 
 (This is a warning) 
 This is a woman's threat 
 Baby, this is a woman's threat 
 My shakin', my sleep, my stress 
 My days, my night, my rest 
 My do's, my don'ts, my dares 
 And my church, my pastor, my prayers 
 My all, my faith, my powers 
 And my kitchen, my sink, my towels 
 My joy, my sad, my hate 
 And my sister, my cousin, my friends 
 My lights, my gas, my bills 
 My role, my way, my will 
 My hollerin', my fussin', my fights 
 Nigga please 
 If you don't stop 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna lay in your bed 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna eat your food 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna wear your clothes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna fit your shoes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna get your keys 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna open your doors 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna get your check 
 (This is a warning) 
 This is a woman's threat 
 Baby 
 My future, my hopes, my dreams 
 My panties, my socks, my things 
 My flowers, my dress, my ring 
 My man, my lover, my king 
 My live, my chance, my fault 
 And my guts, my courage, my wounds 
 My fence, my neighbors, my yard 
 My chains, my lock, my guards 
 My win, my lose, my gain 
 And my credit, my card, my name 
 Myself, my freedom, my roof 
 Nigga please 
 If you don't stop 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna lay in your bed 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna eat your food 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna wear your clothes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna fit your shoes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna get your keys 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna open your doors 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna get your check 
 (This is a warning) 
 This is a woman's threat 
 Baby, this is a woman's threat 
 Listen 
 (Whoa, whoa...) 
 Have you ever heard the story 
 About the three little bears 
 See they papa was gone 
 For a long, long, long, long time 
 When he returned 
 To his sweet little home 
 He had come to find 
 That all of his porridge was gone 
 If you don't stop 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna lay in your bed 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna eat your food 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna wear your clothes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna fit your shoes 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna get your keys 
 (This is a warning) 
 And someone's gonna open your doors 
 (This is a warning) 
 Someone's gonna get your check 
 (This is a warning) 
 This is a woman's threat
