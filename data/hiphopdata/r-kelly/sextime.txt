Got nowhere to be 
 Except right here with you and me 
 Phone's off no clock 
 Cause imma hit it non stop 
 Baby 
 Yeah your body's talking and I'm listening 
 You've got my undivided attention 
 I'm feasting on it like the last meal 
 Heartbreak baby take me like an Advil whoa 
 Chop and screwed tonight we going slow 
 Wrap around that thing just like they do the pole 
 'Cause you're the only thing on my schedule 
 Fuck a club, fuck a flight, girl tonight 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 Spend some time baby 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 Spend a little sex time with you

 (Girl I want to spend some) 
 Spend a little sex time with you 
 Spend a little sex time with you 
 (Spend a little time) 
 Spend a little sex time with you 
 Baby 
 Let's get away from population 
 Take your body on a sex vacation 
 You like the rain on a window pain 
 I'm going down baby say my name 
 Time don't exist when we're alone 
 Girl welcome to the 'R' zone 
 I be hitting it hard from the back till the wall shake 
 It's so damn good I declare this night a holiday 
 Your love is sweet and I gotta crave it 
 Imma need an extra hour in it daylight saving 
 Tonight I'm trying to be a slave 
 Tell the whole world it can wait cause 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 (Yeah) 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 (Would you like that girl) 
 Imma spend some time babe 
 (Imma spend some time) 
 Imma spend some time babe

 And I be 
 Filling up your body baby 
 My work my pleasure you're my business and my hobby baby 
 You're the call, I'm the answer 
 Thin walls 
 With the neighbours 
 Man I been up for two days 
 Murder murder 48 
 You no longer have to wait

 Spend a little sex time with you

 Spend a little sex time with you 
 (Let's steal away) 
 Spend a little sex time with you 
 (Come on let's steal away) 
 Spend a little sex time with you

 Spend a little sex time with you
