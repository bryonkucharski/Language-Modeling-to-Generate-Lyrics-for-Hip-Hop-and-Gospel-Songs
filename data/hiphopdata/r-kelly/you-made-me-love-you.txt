 I was just minding my business when 
 Ms. Purdy you came walking 
 My heart stopped said what is this just 
 As soon as you started talking 
 Something happened deep within me (well) 
 All of a sudden I got this feeling 
 A chill came from feet to head and then I 
 Turned away from you and said to myself 
 This is not supposed to happen brother you've been hurt too many times before 
 First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell 
 You made me love you 
 You made me love you babe, made me love you babe 
 Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe 
 Said you made me love you 
 You made me love you babe, made me love you babe 
 Made me love you babe, (good Lord) made me love you babe 
 You made me love you babe, made me love you babe 
 Made me love you babe, (said it wasn't in my plans) made me love you babe 
 Ooh, look at you 
 Said you must be one of the top models 
 Body curved like a pop bottle 
 Got me sweating like a boxer baby 
 I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (awww) 
 Could this be what heaven sent to me 
 An angel come to set me free 
 Love has been a stranger to me 
 And myself keeps telling me that 
 This is not supposed to happen brother you've been hurt too many times before 
 First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell 
 You made me love you 
 You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe 
 Made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe 
 Hey you made me love you 
 You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (yeah) 
 Made me love you babe, (aw baby) made me love you babe 
 You made love you 
 You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (aw love) 
 Made me love you babe, made me love you babe 
 Said the power of love you see 
 Are 10 billion wonders to me (like the moon and stars above) 
 There's a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir) 
 So much joy darling you put in me 
 And now the sun is shining where there used to be rain, oh Lord 
 And now no more loneliness, no more hurt, no more pain 
 You made whoo!
