Good evening ladies, shall we start with horderves? 
 I can tell your body's been lacking the plater of satisfaction your body deserves 
 We have reservations and I'm so glad that we're here 
 'Cause I'll be toasting your juices all night like cheers 
 See you need someone who understands you have a delicate pallet 
 Let me cater to you while indulging in my own bad eating habits 
 It's a celebration and you're the cream of the crop 
 Let me *slurps* and I promise I won't leave a drop 
 But wait... this is just the appetiser 
 By the time I reach dessert a climax couldn't get no higher 
 A leg couldn't shake no harder, we goin' at it so crazy 
 This love so tasty, I'm talkin' my jelly in your pastry 
 See baby I got every need, every want, every craving you seek 
 I'll be going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper until lemons taste sweet 
 This is all you can eat from steak to sorbet 
 Welcome to the buffet
