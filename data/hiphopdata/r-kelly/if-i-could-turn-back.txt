How did I ever let yo slip away 
 Never knowing, I'd be singing this song someday 
 And now I'm sinking to rise no more 
 Ever since you closed the door 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 Funny, funny how time goes by 
 And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye 
 Why oh, why oh, why should one have to go on suffering 
 When everyday, I plead come back to me 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 And you had enough love for the both of us 
 But I, I did you wrong, I admit, I did 
 But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin', you would be mine 
 I'd never hurt you 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Never do you wrong 
 (If I could turn back) 
 And never leave your side 
 (If I could turn back) 
 If I could turn back the hands 
 There'd be nothing, I wouldn't do for you 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Forever honest and true to you 
 (If I could turn back) 
 If you accept me back in your heart, I love you 
 (If I could turn back the hands) 
 (If I could turn back) 
 That would be my will 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Darlin', I'm begging you to take me by the hands 
 (If I could turn back the hands) 
 I'm going down, yes I am 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Down on my bended knee, yeah 
 (If I could turn back) 
 And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me 
 (If I could turn back the hands) 
 (If I could turn back) 
 If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Then I'd come to realize how much I love you 
 Love you, love you, love you 
 (If I could turn back the hands)
