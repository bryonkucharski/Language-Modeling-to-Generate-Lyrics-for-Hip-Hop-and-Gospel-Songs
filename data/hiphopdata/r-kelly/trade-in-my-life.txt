Trade in my life 
 Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes 
 Trade in my life for you 
 Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong 
 Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home 
 Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend 
 Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way 
 Though the sun is going down, I need you around 
 I'm willing to trade in my life 
 Trade in my life 
 Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes 
 Trade in my life for you 
 Now I'm sitting here 
 Reminiscing on what we used to share 
 And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah 
 I cannot believe we've thrown it all away 
 Tell me will I see you again someday? 
 Now the past is gone away 
 But tomorrow's on it's way 
 Though the sun is going down 
 And I need you around - trade 
 Trade in my life 
 Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes 
 Trade in my life for you 
 We both know that we made a vow 
 Said we'd always be together 
 That our love would endure, yes 
 But now you're gone and I'm all alone 
 But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it 
 Trade in my life 
 Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes 
 Trade in my life for you 
 I mean it from the bottom of my heart 
 Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it 
 And I don't even have to think about it twice 
 Hey, I'll trade it 
 Somebody help me say I'll trade it 
 Until you return to me 
 I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees 
 And when I see you I'm gonna stand up 
 And reach my hands out to you, and trade it 
 Said I love my music and I love my fans 
 But I've got to step back 
 Look at this thing like it sure enough is 
 Tell me do you remember when we used to say 
 Everything is in their love tell me 
 What does it profit a man 
 To gain the world and lose his soul? 
 I'm gonna trade it to be with you
