I'm sick and tired of the games you played 
 Every move I make your ass got something to say 
 Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper 
 Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way 
 Everybody is trying to figure me out 
 What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life 
 I can't go one day without y'all in my face 
 Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say 
 Cops chase me when I'm standing still 
 You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell 
 You don't like my songs well it pays the bills 
 And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real 
 Sometimes I want to fly far away from here 
 To another place it ain't worth these tears 
 Sometimes at night when I close my eyes 
 I know the haters are busy making up hater lies 
 Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying 
 If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust 
 See I work so hard just to get ahead 
 If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead 
 Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down 
 But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out 
 If yo had your way it'd be lock and key 
 Everywhere I go trouble follows me 
 Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes 
 There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind 
 Forgive me father for I have sinned 
 When was your last confession 
 His true fears he left without a care 
 And that was more than I could bare 
 When you need my help I never tell you no 
 When I need your love you got somewhere to go 
 I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit 
 I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick 
 I get mad as hell but that's ok 
 Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay 
 I gotta let you know got no time to play 
 So feel me and all that you hear me say 
 What I'm building up you can't tear it down 
 'Cause it's built on solid Rockland ground 
 We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style 
 Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky 
 Nothing in my view, hey I can fly 
 Y'all just hate, I can't take no more 
 And if you feel me raise your hand and show 
 This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel 
 Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo 
 Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh 
 Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south 
 Southside tell me can you feel me 
 Feel me, feel me
