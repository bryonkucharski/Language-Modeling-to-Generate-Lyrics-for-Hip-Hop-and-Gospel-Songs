All hope was gone 
 Hard to hang on 
 Hard to be strong 
 Was blind, could not see 
 Nothing but walls in front of me 
 And inside no peace 
 And the mountains seemed impossible to climb 
 Until you stood on the front line 
 You led the way 
 Out of the darkness 
 We didn't go astray 
 You were ready to die for our sake 
 And that, that takes a soldier's heart 
 Oceans so deep 
 Uphill, so steep 
 But still we believe 
 And when the road was too far to travel 
 Heroes, you cared, you came and carried us there 
 And the mountains seemed impossible to climb 
 Until you stood on the front line 
 You led the way 
 Out of the darkness 
 We didn't go astray 
 You were ready to die for our sake 
 And that takes a soldier's heart 
 And so our flag was still there 
 All because you decided to care 
 Our burden to bear 
 You stood on the front line 
 You led the way 
 Right out of the darkness 
 Didn't go astray 
 You were ready to die for our sake 
 And that takes 
 You stood on the front line 
 You led the way 
 Right out of the darkness, hey 
 You could have let us go astray 
 You were ready to die for our sake 
 And that takes a soldier's heart 
 Whoa, that takes a soldier's heart, hey 
 It takes a soldier's heart
