 Hitting them tricks on the pole 
 Can you work it like that if I take you home? 
 I wanna do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

 You something special, cut like a diamond 
 When you do it like that, other chicks forget it 
 All that ass, all this cash, baby, you about to get it 
 Have dinner on the jet, you ain't seen nothing yet 
 Think I'm good with this flirting shit, wait till we get to sex 
 And whoa, gonna turn you to a singer 
 Get you in my bed, have you hitting them notes like Aretha 
 And whoa, if you don't know I'mma teach ya

 The way you do it on the pole, girl, you straight wilding 
 Out of all the other chicks, it's your number that I'm dialing 
 When I get you to myself I'mma show you what you're missing 
 Excuse my French when I go low, baby, that's just how I kiss it 
 So put your legs around my neck, get it Aquafina wet 
 I back up what I'm talking, baby ain't no need to flex 
 And whoa, 'mma be your addiction 
 Doctor Kama Sutra, filling your prescription 
 And whoa, girl, I'm on a mission 
 We ain't leaving this room till we hit every position 
 And whoa, shorty, say it like you mean it 
 You been looking for that work, baby girl, about to bring it
