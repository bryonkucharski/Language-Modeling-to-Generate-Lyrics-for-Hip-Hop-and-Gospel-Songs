I can see my destination 
 I can hear my call 
 No more hesitation, mmm 
 This time I'm goin' for it all 
 'Cause I know where this road leads to 
 And therefore I will rise 
 I know this dream will come true, uh 
 And I will soar the sky 
 (Spirit, spirit) 
 Would you guide me, oh 
 (Spirit) Oh (Spirit) 
 Stand by me 
 Come on, Come on, Come on 
 Set me free 
 I can feel the penetration 
 Of a strong wind movin' me, mmm 
 I feel can the elevation, mmm 
 Of an angel lifting me, mmm 
 'Cause I know where this road leads to 
 Therefore I will rise 
 I know this dream will come true, oh 
 And I will soar the sky 
 (Oh, Spirit) 
 Now that I've found my way home 
 I've got to get there, get there 
 Though one step seems one mile long 
 Your bridge before my face 
 I will take the leap of faith 
 (Chorus, Until fade)
