I decided to stay home tonight 
 I decided I'ma treat you right 
 I decided to be there for you 
 Decided to be on my P's and Q's 
 I decided to give up my friends 
 Decided I'ma take you out weekends 
 Decided to give you a reason to trust 
 These are decisions that I make for love 
 Enough is enough no more running around 
 (Searchin' for what's right here at home) 
 Because my luck is 'bout to turn around 
 (And I just can't keep doin' you wrong) 
 Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always 
 (Tired of this ego trip) 
 'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man 
 And I just can't have that happen to me 
 I decided to stay home tonight 
 I decided I'ma treat you right 
 I decided to be there for you 
 Decided to be on my P's and Q's 
 I decided to give up my friends 
 Decided I'ma take you out weekends 
 Decided to give you a reason to trust 
 These are decisions that I make for love 
 Now I've had about all that I can stand no more 
 (I'm turnin' in my playa's card) 
 See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose 
 ('Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart) 
 It was silly of me to be the way that I was 
 (First was blind, but now I see) 
 Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love 
 And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I 
 I decided to stay home tonight 
 I decided I'ma treat you right 
 I decided to be there for you 
 Decided to be on my P's and Q's 
 I decided to give up my friends 
 Decided I'ma take you out weekends 
 Decided to give you a reason to trust 
 These are decisions that I make for love 
 When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me 
 Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality 
 So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here 
 For always 
 Forever more, I decided 
 I decided to stay home tonight 
 I decided I'ma treat you right

 Girl I'm going to dump my friends 
 Yes I will 
 Truly I will 
 We are going to be together on the weekend 
 Whoa, whoa 
 See these are the decisions I made for love 
 For the two of us 
 Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust 
 Yeah, yeah, oh no, whoa 
 There will be 
 No more cheatin' 
 No more creepin' 
 No more fuckin' 
 No more sneakin'
