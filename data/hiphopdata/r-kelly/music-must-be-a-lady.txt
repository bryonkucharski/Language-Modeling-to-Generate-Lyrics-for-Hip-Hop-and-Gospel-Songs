Music must be a lady 
 The way it makes me love to me 
 Me, you, music, music, 
 I'm so amazed by your choice of melodies that you used on me 
 Lady music, when we make love it's like we're making love with the same key 
 Music must a lady cause of the way you sing your melody, woman, oh, 
 Walk on by your sexual energy 
 Miss conduct all up orchestration means how to please you 
 In this room music I do for you 
 I hear a drum roll as we... 
 When you grace my stage I can't find the words to say... 
 Music must be, must be a woman 
 You're my anthem, you're the reason why I dance 
 Music, missis music, miss music, I wanna make your body sing some come joy and happiness 
 Write your words in my bed 
 Miss music, said I'll never fall in love, never ever fall in love 
 Now here I am in love, so so in love with you 
 Miss music, this love making is so unique, 
 Come on let it break out over me like a quiet... beat 
 Music, said I celebrate you and I honored you and I salute you 
 And I sing my heart out to you, 
 Music, cause you deserve it and I would like to do some things to you 
 Music, so get ready, miss music, get ready darling, 
 'Cause I'm about to add, I'm a need to your life 
 Love making do it, just to be precise baby 
 Music, hello sweet soprano, miss music 
 I want you to meet mister tenor 
 And I love your music, as a matter of fact I'm quite a big fan 
 Music, missis music, missed you, missis music, music
