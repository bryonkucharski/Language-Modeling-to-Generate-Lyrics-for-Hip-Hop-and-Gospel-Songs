There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
 I wanna make you moann 
 Do it all night long 
 Once I get you home 
 Baby girl it's on 
 I'm gonna kiss yo lips 
 Then I'm gonna raise yo slip 
 I'm gonna take your hand 
 And let you feel these ribs 
 I'm a winner..., I'm a winner..., I'm a winner... 
 I'm a winner in bed 
 Go to dinner..., go to dinner..., go to dinner... 
 Go to dinner in bed 
 Listen babe,

 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
 I wanna show you love 
 From the bottom up 
 Once the light goes off 
 You can't get enough 
 I wanna be yo man 
 Not a one night stand 
 And if you take my hand 
 I bet 1 hundred grand 
 I'm a winner..., I'm a winner..., I'm a winner... 
 I'm a winner in bed, yes I am 
 Go to dinner..., go to dinner..., go to dinner... 
 And the dinner in bed, there can only be... 
 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me 
 Girl open your dictionary look under love 
 And your gonna see my face 
 Come to bed right now lets cover up 
 Nothin' but sweat comin' between us in this place 
 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
 There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me 
 Do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be... 
 Wanna be with me tonight 
 Do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see... 
 How I'm gonna do yo body right 
 Do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go... 
 Go on a 12 play ride 
 You'll be goin' all out 
 Like a prom night 
 And you won't make it home 
 'Cause you realize
