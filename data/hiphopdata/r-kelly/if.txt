I mean everybody say, what if? 
 What if I could fly? What if man could fly for real? 
 Wouldn't that be somethin'? 
 Man I would surely touch the sky if I could just fly 
 You know we have our dreams 
 We always say, what if, what if this, what if that 
 What if you and me were together? What if? 
 Forever! I mean eternity for real! What if? 
 If yeah, baby 
 Listen, if I were a painter baby, I'd paint a picture of us 
 Somewhere on a private island makin' love, yeah 
 Now if I were a pirate baby I'd discover, yeah 
 You for me 'cause girl you are a treasure, yeah 
 If I was a dream baby here's what I'd do 
 Allow every good dream you dream to come true, yeah 
 If I were a promise baby, then you could bet, yeah 
 That every promise made to you girl will be kept, yes, it would 
 If I was a magician baby then you'd have no fear 
 'Cause I'd snap my fingers and make your worries disappear 
 If I were 
 If I were all these things then girl to you I'd give all these things 
 Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing 
 I'd ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring 
 If I could, I'd do those things 
 Now, if I were a preacher baby, my sermon would be 
 About how God opened up Heaven and rained you on me, yeah 
 If I was a doctor baby I surely would 
 Give you somethin' for your pain that'll make you feel real good 
 Now, if I were a psychic baby then our love would last 
 'Cause I'd go into the future and prevent 
 All break ups from comin' to pass 
 Lord, if I were feeling down baby and really goin' through 
 All friends are gone then I know 
 That I can count on you 
 One more, if we were at a club baby and this jam came on 
 I'd grab you by the hand and tell you let's step to this song 
 If I were 
 If I were all these things then girl to you I'd give all these things 
 Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing 
 I'd ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring 
 Baby if I could I'd do those things 
 If I could blink my eye and be a giant eagle in the sky 
 Girl, I would swoop down and fly you straight into the sun 
 Oh if I could pick a number out of every number girl you'd be 
 My number one 
 If I were all these things then girl to you I'd give all these things 
 Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing 
 I'd ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring 
 If I could I'd do those things 
 If I were all these things then girl to you I'd give all these things 
 Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing 
 I'd ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring 
 If I could I'd do those things 
 If I were all these things then girl to you I'd give all these things 
 Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing 
 I'd ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring 
 If I could I'd do those things
