I don't know how to make it stop 
 I don't know how to make it stop 
 I don't know how to make it stop 
 (No) 
 I got a phobia when it comes to heights 
 Even if it's a first class flight 
 And as a kid, I never really liked to climb 
 If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry 
 If I had a dream that I was flying, 
 Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming 
 And now you take me up and away with you 
 Push me out of the plane with no parachute 
 And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me 
 It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky) 
 And I need somebody to catch me 
 Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 Will you catch me? 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down 
 I never ever wanted to climb a ladder 
 And I never wanted a house in the hills 
 I'm comfortable living in a big high rise 
 Cause in nightmares of getting killed 
 I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep 
 Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leave 
 Even if I was bummin' on the streets on the streets of Chi 
 You couldn't pay me to leave 
 And now you take me up and away with you 
 Push me out of the plane with no parachute 
 And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me 
 It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky) 
 And I need somebody to catch me 
 Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 Will you catch me? 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down 
 Girl I'm running out of time, come back around 
 Only a few seconds before I hit the ground 
 How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings? 
 Oh I can't breathe, no 
 Baby it's like I'm dreaming, got nothing to hold on to 
 I can't wake up girl, laying next to you 
 I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat 
 It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky) 
 And I need somebody to catch me 
 Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 Will you catch me? 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down 
 It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky) 
 It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky) 
 And I need somebody to catch me 
 Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 Will you catch me? 
 When I come down (down, down, down) 
 When I come down
