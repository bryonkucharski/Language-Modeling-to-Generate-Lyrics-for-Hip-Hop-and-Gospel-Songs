First of all you gotta understand 
 This album is not about 
 Me trying to show somebody I can do reggae music 
 Or I'm reggae or anything like that 
 This song is about is about reaching the masses 
 You know what I sayin'? 
 As a matter of fact 
 The whole MVProject is really about 
 It's not about R.Kelly shinin 
 It's about me shinin the light 
 On my people in Jamaica with my music 
 'Cause I got fans there and they love me 
 You know what I mean? 
 Don't like confrontation 
 Don't like inconsideration 
 Don't like false accusations 
 Can't stand victimization 
 Don't like starvation 
 Oh I never liked discrimination 
 It's not all about separation 
 It's about healing the nations 
 I like love 
 I'm all about that thing called love 
 Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love 
 I don't like aggravation 
 Don't like humiliation 
 And I can't stand defamation 
 And I really don't like temptation 
 Don't like exploitation 
 I don't like decamation 
 It's not about tribulations 
 It's all about salvation 
 I like love 
 I'm all about that thing called love 
 Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love 
 It's all about love 
 No matter where I go there's this one thing I know yeah 
 It's all about love 
 City to city when I'm up in the club yeah 
 It's all about love 
 Oh block to block all around the world holla 
 It's all about love 
 And if you feel me real people then put your hands up 
 I like love 
 I'm all about that thing called love 
 Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love 
 Yeah I hope y'all understand 
 You know what I'm sayin' cause 
 There's people out there that 
 You know fans that will probably never get to see me 
 I'll probably never get to see them 
 But I want them to know that I love em 
 I appreciate them for supportin R.Kelly 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 The different countries 
 All different cultures 
 The world 
 Y'all made me who I am 
 And I just wanna take this song to say thank you 
 God bless you and your families 
 Peace
