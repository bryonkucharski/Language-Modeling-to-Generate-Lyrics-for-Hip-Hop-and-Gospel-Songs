You know we trap all day, play all night 
 This is the life of a, the life of a go getta (eh!) 
 Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!) 
 And in the club, you see a bad bitch; point her out (oh!) 
 Yeah, you damn right I'm a (eh!) 
 You damn right I'm a go getta (eh!) 
 Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!) 
 (Young Jeezy) 
 In the immediate state they callin' me Will Smith 
 Thing on my side, you can call that Jada 
 The boys talkin' down; yeah, we call 'em hatas 
 I'm ballin' right now, so we'll get back to that later 
 Be the first to admit I'm such an alcoholic 
 Only blow that good shit, yeah, that whatchamacallit 
 Catch me posted on the block in something exotic 
 '07, yeah, same color Hypnotic 
 I'm on the outside lookin', and I want in 
 My homie did the same thing, and he got ten 
 Just took a loss; still tryin' two win 
 And you tryin' to get back, so what you tryin' to spend? 
 (Young Jeezy) 
 We live life on the edge like there's no tomorrow (yeah) 
 They grind hard like there's no today 
 They do the same shit like it's yesterday 
 The game never stop so who's next to play? 
 Against all odds you can place your bets 
 Yeah, I'm just gettin' started, so I ain't done yet (naw) 
 Risk it all, you can lose your life 
 What else can I say? That's a hell of a price (damn) 
 I don't under 'cause I over-stand 
 No time for mistakes, so I over-plan 
 I'm in the club like what? 
 Four-five wit' me, and I'm a stay thuggin' till the feds come get me 
 (R.Kelly) 
 Hey, hey, this is how we play 
 When we roll up to the club high, sittin' on twenty treys 
 Hop out like we fabulous 
 Top models grabbin' us 
 They love them go gettas, only in America 
 Put D on chicks like Wallace 
 Turn 'em, throw 'em down 
 Thinkin' they can have all this 
 Can't deny it when you see the wheels spinnin' 
 Boy Kells out the coupe in Miami white linen 
 Chips big spendin', walk out the club with a shit load a women 
 Soon as I see one I like, I'm a go getta 
 I'm a get it 'cause I'm a go getta
