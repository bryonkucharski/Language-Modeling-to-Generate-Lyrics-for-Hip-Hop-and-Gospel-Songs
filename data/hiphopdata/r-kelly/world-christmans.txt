(Merry Christmas) 
 (To all of the world) 
 Hearing the bells go ding dong, 
 Hearing the choir sing songs, 
 Letting us know its Christmas, 
 Time for the world to spread love. 
 I open my eyes, 
 And to my surprise, 
 I've come to realize that 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you. 
 Looking out of the window, 
 Seeing the winter white snow, 
 Kiss under the mistletoe, 
 I see the angel's halo. 
 I open my eyes, 
 And to my surprise, 
 I've come to realize that 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you. 
 (Yeah Yeah) 
 So, come on, come on, 
 A child is born, 
 Onto us, a King 
 So, joy to the world, 
 Woman, man, boy and girl, 
 With this love and Christmas brings. 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you. 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you. 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you. 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 All around the world, it's Christmas, 
 And I'm so glad to be, 
 Sharing peace and harmony with you.
