Bright nigh, city lights and a city that never sleeps 
 Loud music and talks people where all the party sings 
 I saw a girl and I notices that she noticed me 
 Whe set mojitos then she told me all about her dreams 
 And we made love in a taxi cab, It reminded me of a dream I had 
 Now the memory's like a photograph and I can't get her out of my head 
 Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab X 3 
 And the ... now she's been 
 I come alone, come at floor what she said? 
 I come alone, come at door to me 
 Looking at the rear view she said to me let go and be free 
 Then she told the driver mind his business and then where there on me 
 Then I told her which is 15 minutes from my home 
 But she didn't stop, she kept saying it feels so incredible wrong 
 And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had 
 Now the memory's like a photograph oh baby girl, and I can't get her out of my head 
 Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3 
 And the ... now she's been 
 And all have been so soon, girl 
 I didn't even get a name, ... don't ... got a room 
 It was like a hotel room, ... people love the best ... 
 And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had 
 Now the memory's like a photograph oh baby girl, photograph baby, and I can't get her out of my head 
 Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3 
 And the ... now she's been 
 The girl's meant for me 
 We made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, X 3 
 That we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had 
 Now the memory's like a photograph, and I can't get her out of my head.
