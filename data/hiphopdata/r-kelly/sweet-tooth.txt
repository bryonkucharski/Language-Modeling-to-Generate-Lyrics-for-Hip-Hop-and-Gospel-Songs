This is for them big girls, smalls girls, tall girls 
 And this is for them skinny girls, white girls, black girls 
 Don't matter the color, any nationality 
 I got a sweet tooth come and get with me 
 When I saw you at the club girl leanin and rockin' wit it 
 Ooh you made a nigga wanna giggle with it 
 Let me put you in the back of the coupe and hit it 
 And now all I wanna do is babysit it 
 I been feenin, wantin to kiss it 
 Hungry girl let me raid your kitchen 
 Fix me a plate of that 
 I'm not playing girl I'm on a mission 
 Legs won't stop shaking once I do it (uh uhn) 
 Tongue game tight girl let me do it (uh huh) 
 Tease you then please you girl 
 Open up let me in your world 
 Girl I wanna be alone with you 
 I'm tryna to see what that booty do 
 Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth 
 Got a sweet tooth for you girl (for you girl) 
 Baby I'm tempted to taste (tempted taste) 
 I can't wait to drink your milk 
 Your looking like a big ol' piece of cake 
 I'm all up in your middle 
 Ooh it taste like skittles 
 I'm just keeping it real with you 
 Girl I got a sweet tooth 
 Now that I got you on my bed 
 Clothes off 
 Lying next to me 
 Girl I'm about to give myself a cavity 
 Plus I'm gonna need band-aids for my knees 
 Girl set the table 
 Now let me feast 
 Strawberry shortcake 
 With whipped cream 
 I can taste it 
 My mouth is watering for you 
 Come here girl let me show you 
 Hop in the rain 
 Slide through 
 All up in your crib 
 And toss you 
 When it's over 
 I want more of you 
 So open up let me spoil you 
 Girl I wanna be alone with you 
 I'm trying to see what that booty do 
 Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth 
 Got a sweet tooth for you girl 
 Baby I'm tempted to taste 
 I can't wait to drink your milk 
 Your looking like a big old piece of cake 
 I'm all up in your middle 
 Ooh it taste like skittles 
 I'm just keeping it real with you 
 Girl I got a sweet tooth 
 I don't want no dinner babe 
 I'm going straight for dessert 
 You don't need no panties babe 
 Girl up under that t-shirt 
 When you taste so good to me 
 And, I can't get enough 
 See, doc say stay away from sweets, fuck it 
 Come on and get my sugar up 
 Got a sweet tooth for you girl 
 Baby I'm tempted to taste

 Your looking like a big ol' piece of cake 
 I'm all up in your middle 
 Ooh it taste like skittles 
 I'm just keeping it real with you 
 Girl I got a sweet tooth
