You have reached R.Kelly 
 Unfortunately, I'm sleep 
 Been out partying all night 
 And I'm blasted off that Hennessey 
 I hop to hotel lobbies 
 Going to them after parties 
 Throwing up and carrying on 
 Bout to have somebody drive me home 
 I get through the door 
 Fall on the floor 
 Get up 
 I'm staggering 
 Look upstairs 
 Shit is blurry because I'm real bent 
 And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going 
 And this goes out to all of my honeys that's calling 
 Leave your name right after the beep and I'm sure to get back with you 
 If I'm not asleep or 
 Smoking on some trees or 
 Having a little sex or 
 If I'm not faded or 
 Making a baby

 Leave your name right after the beep and I'm sure to get back with you 
 If I'm not asleep or (Said if) 
 Blowing on trees (I'm not) 
 Having some sex (That's all, yeah) 
 If I'm not faded or 
 Making a baby 
 Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin 
 I told myself never again 
 Sleeping while the club is crunk 
 Don't make no sense to be that drunk 
 Arguing through the night 
 Pushing on people and starting fights 
 I was fucked up 
 I confess 
 People saying Kellz is a hot mess 
 Even after that I was taking shots 
 Shot after shot 
 Shot after shot then 
 I couldn't even open the door to my Benz 
 Dropped off and I get in the door now 
 Lying on the stairs snoring now 
 Why you calling me calling me calling me? 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up Kellz 
 Why you calling me calling me calling me? 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up
