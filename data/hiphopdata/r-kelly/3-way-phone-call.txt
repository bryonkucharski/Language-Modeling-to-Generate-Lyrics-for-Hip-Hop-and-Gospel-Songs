Ok Ok, I give you that 
 Nothing's wrong, I take that back 
 There is something on my mind 
 But sis, I don't want to waste your time 
 But I done told you time and time again 
 Whatever you're going through 
 You can come and talk to me 
 And I will say a prayer with you 
 But I done prayed and prayed night and day 
 I still can't seem to find my way 
 Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you 
 That you're washed up and you're through 
 But sister's here to let you know 
 Boy you're gonna make it through 
 Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again 
 Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins 
 Can you tell me what to do? 
 Well first you gotta believe the truth 
 Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him 
 That's okay because he believes in you 
 The winds, the rain 
 The storm 
 The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive) 
 The trying times 
 The sleepless nights 
 Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah) 
 Through all of the hills 
 And valleys roamed 
 That we must come to (whoa) 
 Walk side by side 
 Follow the light 
 And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah) 
 So, so what you're saying is believe a little more? 
 Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door 
 What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive 
 Especially when trouble follows me 
 When we're keeping it real 
 Robert sometimes 
 Trouble can follow where you lead 
 Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I... 
 Just wait, let me make a phone call 
 To who? 
 A prayer buddy of mine 
 She can help you tear down your walls 
 I don't want nobody in my business 
 She's a friend 
 And besides you need this 
 You know how church folk can be 
 Boy I'm your sister, trust in me 
 Now hold on 
 Maybe she's gone... 
 No 
 Maybe we ought to just try... 
 Hello 
 Shh shh, hello, is Kim there? 
 Yes, I think she's around here somewhere 
 Hold on 
 Now you just let me do the talking 
 Mmm hmm 
 Hello? 
 Hey girl, how you doing? 
 Hey Kelly 
 My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you 
 Ooh what can I do for you? 
 Hello? 
 Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you 
 Oh, well, I know you must be very busy 
 So I'm not going to mess around, nah 
 Just telling my sister how my life is upside down 
 And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time 
 Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me? 
 Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through 
 Really? 
 Yes, and sometimes I still do 
 Yeah? 
 See it doesn't matter who you are 
 Or where you're from 
 If you struggle, God will use you 
 Amen sister, what you're saying is so true 
 Rob are you there? 
 Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you 
 It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do 
 Yes but if you stand the truth 
 It will free you 
 Oh 
 Just stand strong 
 Stand strong 
 With your head held high 
 With your head held high 
 Said it won't be long 
 In time he will provide 
 Will he? 
 Yes he will 
 You just stay in the race 
 Just stay in the race 
 And keep on running 
 And down to the end 
 Cause your day is coming 
 The winds, the rain 
 The storm 
 The weapons that are formed against us 
 The trying times 
 The sleepless nights 
 Just know that faith is with us 
 Through all of the hills 
 And valleys roamed 
 That we must come to 
 Walk side by side 
 Follow the light 
 And we'll make it through 
 He'll give you peace 
 In the midst of your storm 
 Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me 
 But he'll never leave you 
 No way 
 You just gotta hang on 
 Hang on 
 Robert say a prayer, keep your head 
 God will do just what he said 
 Finally I think I get it 
 Yes, that's it 
 That's the spirit
