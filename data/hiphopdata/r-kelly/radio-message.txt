This is a radio message to my baby, 
 And I'm begging her 
 Come back, come back, 
 Come back, come back, 
 Come back 
 I'm sorry that I made you cry 
 I'm sorry for the rest of my life 
 And I'm sorry that I hurt you 
 And I'm sorry for lying to you 
 And I'm lost without you, 
 'Cause I'm all about you, 
 'Cause you're here to stay 
 Oh my, oh me 
 I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend 
 Can you hear me, can you forgive me 
 I don't want no tickets, no limo ride 
 I'm the next caller on the line 
 This is a radio message to my baby, 
 And I'm begging her 
 Come back, come back 
 Come back, please come back. 
 Won't you come back? 
 This is a radio message to my baby, 
 And I'm begging her 
 Come back, come back, baby 
 Come back, come back 
 Come back 
 And I'm sorry for treating you that way, 
 I'm sorry for all of those silly mistakes 
 Sorry I didn't to what I promised 
 And I'm sorry you're sorry that we ever met. 
 And I'm lost without you, 
 'Cause I'm all about you, 
 'Cause you're here to stay 
 Oh my, oh me 
 I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend, 
 Can you hear me girl, can you forgive me 
 'Cause I don't want no tickets, no limo ride 
 I'm the next caller on the line 
 And this is a radio message to my baby, 
 And I'm begging her
