Baby, oh baby 
 I know we had an argument and all 
 Ooh babe 
 And I must have said some pretty foul shit but 
 I just want you to know that I ain't mean none of that 
 Baby, baby 
 None of it 
 Now I was supposed to be a man about it 
 Shoulda never left your side 
 No way, no how 
 Put too many years in this relationship 
 And it's not that serious for us to split 
 Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes 
 But still I appreciate the love we make 
 Stop at the door and put your bags back down 
 Now baby please can we work this out 
 Now I might say you can walk 
 (But I don't mean it) 
 And I might name call 
 (I don't mean it) 
 I may pull some silly stunts 
 (Uhm mmm) 
 But that's just a front, I don't mean it 
 (Now wait a minute hear me out) 
 Now I may holler at you 
 (I don't mean it) 
 And I may tell you we're through 
 (But I don't mean it, no, no) 
 May give you looks that can kill 
 (Can kill) 
 But it's not for real 
 (Not for real) 
 I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it hey) 
 Now I was supposed to be more understanding 
 Instead of tryin' to be so damn demandin 
 Baby I'm willing to drop my ego 
 And do the things I should have done and more 
 See I know that I can be a better man 
 Girl all you gotta do is take my hand 
 Promise me this time 
 I'm goin' all the way 
 And show you all the reasons why you stayed 
 Now I might say you can walk 
 (But I don't mean it, no, no) 
 And I might name call 
 (Girl I don't mean it) 
 I may pull some silly stunts 
 (Ooh yeah) 
 But that's just a front, I don't mean it 
 (Listen baby) 
 Now I may holler at you 
 (But I don't mean it) 
 And I may tell you we're through 
 (Girl you should know, I don't mean it) 
 May give you looks that can kill 
 (Um mmm) 
 But it's not for real 
 I don't mean it 
 (Come here girl) 
 See I never meant 
 To break you down 
 And make you cry, make you cry 
 Oh please baby please 
 Turn back around 
 Don't you say goodbye, say goodbye 
 Sometimes I know that 
 I can take it 
 Just a little bit too far 
 But yo my heart is good 
 Heart is good 
 So baby you don't have to worry 
 You're gonna see a change 
 Girl you know I love ya 
 Even though I may say 
 Now I might say you can walk 
 (I don't mean it) 
 And I might name call 
 (But I don't mean it) 
 I may pull some silly stunts 
 (Hey) 
 But that's just a front 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it, I don't mean it) 
 Now I may holler at you 
 (When I'm hollerin' at you) 
 And I may tell you we're through 
 (I never mean it when I say we're through) 
 May give you looks that can kill 
 (Kill) 
 But it's not for real 
 (Real) 
 I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it) 
 Now I might say you can walk 
 (I don't mean it) 
 And I might name call 
 (But I don't mean it) 
 I may pull some silly stunts 
 (Hey)

 (Hey, hey) 
 I don't mean it 
 (I don't mean it, I don't mean it) 
 Now I may holler at you 
 (When I'm hollerin' at you) 
 And I may tell you we're through 
 (I never mean it when I say we're through)

 Now I might say you can walk 
 (I may say that you can walk but I don't) 
 And I might name call 
 (Girl I promise I don't mean it) 
 I may pull some silly stunts 
 (Silly stunts) 
 But that's just a front 
 (Just a front) 
 I don't mean it 
 (Thinkin' I'm cool but I'm a fool) 
 Now I may holler at you 
 (When I'm hollerin' at you) 
 And I may tell you we're through 
 (I never mean it when I say we're through) 
 May give you looks that can kill 
 (Kill) 
 But it's not for real 
 (Real) 
 I don't mean it

 Now I might say you can walk 
 (Girl I don't mean it, I don't mean it)

 May give you looks that can kill 
 But it's not for real 
 I don't mean it
