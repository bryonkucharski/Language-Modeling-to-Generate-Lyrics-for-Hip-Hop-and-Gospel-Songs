I can see my destination, I can hear my call 
 No more hesitation this time I'm going for all 
 'Cause I know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise, 
 I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky 
 Spirit spirit would you guide me 
 Spirit spirit stand by me 
 C'mon and c'mon and c'mon and 
 Set me free 
 I can feel the penetration, of a strong wind moving me 
 I can feel the elevation, of an angel lifting me, 
 'Cause I know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise 
 I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky 
 Spirit spirit would you guide me 
 Oh oh Spirit spirit standing by me 
 C'mon and c'mon and c'mon and 
 Set me free 
 Whoa whoa spirit 
 Now that I found my way home 
 I'm gotta get there get there 
 No one step seems more miles long 
 No bridge before my face, I will take the leap of faith 
 Spirit spirit would you guide me 
 Spirit spirit stand by me 
 Spirit spirit Set me free 
 Spirit spirit Spirit spirit spirit Set me free 
 Spirit come and find my way spirit stand by my side 
 Spirit take my hand and be my guide 
 Spirit run free spirit run free run free run free spirit run free
