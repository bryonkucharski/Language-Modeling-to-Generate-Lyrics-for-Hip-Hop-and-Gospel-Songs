La da da da da, la la 
 Oh yeah, yeah 
 Where there's no sun, there is that girl 
 She is the one that spins my world 
 When I am down, she makes it better 
 When there are clouds, she change the weather 
 My wishing well, oh my peace and my glory 
 As a fairytale, then she is my story 
 When I feel drained, her love is like a fountain 
 And when I'm weak, she can move mountains 
 I never felt a love, no, this way 
 I never felt a kiss, no, this way 
 I never felt joy this way 
 Till my lady Sunday came 
 Oh, I am her ground, and she is my sky 
 If life is a road then she is my ride 
 When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling 
 When I am sick, she brings me healing 
 Whenever I call, she is right there 
 And when I fall, she says a prayer 
 When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it 
 Introducing Mrs Music 
 I never felt a love, no, this way 
 I never felt a kiss, no, this way 
 I never felt joy this way 
 Till my lady Sunday came 
 La da da da, Miss Got-Me, Miss Righteous, Miss Hallelujah 
 La da da da, take my hand and be my Mrs Future 
 La da da da, 'cause your loving makes the groove much better 
 As long as we got music, as long we got music 
 As long as we got music, we'll dance forever 
 I never felt a love, no, this way 
 I never felt a kiss, no, this way 
 I never felt joy this way 
 Till my lady Sunday came. 
 I never felt a love, no, this way 
 I never felt a kiss, no, this way 
 I never felt joy this way 
 Till my lady Sunday came. 
 I never felt a love, no, this way (I never felt a love this way) 
 I never felt a kiss, no, this way (No, no, said I never felt a kiss, no, no) 
 I never felt joy this way (No, no, no, I never, felt joy this way) 
 Till my lady Sunday came (till my lady Sunday came to me) 
 I'm so glad, glad 
 That I would shout
