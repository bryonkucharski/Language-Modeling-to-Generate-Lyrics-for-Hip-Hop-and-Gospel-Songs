It's Saturday 
 I'm ready to go out and have some fun 
 Get in the club around 'bout twelvish 
 Me my homies hoochie huntin' 
 Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin' 
 And everybody's on the floor 
 Moet, Alize 
 Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin' 
 All I wanna do 
 All I wanna do 
 Summertime, Saturday night (background) 
 Conversation: "Hey, what'cha doin'? (female) 
 "Chillin', strokin' the town." (male) 
 "Sure you don't wanna come over here?" 
 "Nah, I ain't comin' over there, man." 
 "What you mean you ain't comin' over here.?" 
 "'Cause you don't be talkin' about doing shit." 
 "Who you wit?" 
 "Don't worry about who I'm wit." 
 "See, that's why I don't call you." 
 It's time to be havin' a good time tonight 
 Music got you in the mood, you'll be dancin' all night 
 Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin' and everybody's on the floor 
 I can't seem to stop thinkin' about you, baby 
 No matter what I do 
 Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin' 
 All I wanna do 
 All I wanna do

 Leave all your troubles behind 
 Let me see you hump and bounce 
 Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin'
