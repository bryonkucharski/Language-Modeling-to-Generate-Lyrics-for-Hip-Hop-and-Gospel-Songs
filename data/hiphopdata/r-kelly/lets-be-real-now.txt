I don't know if I'ma be able to give you what you want 
 No disrespect to the things that you want girl but you fuckin' crazy 
 Got me working this overtime shift lovin' you but you don't even pay me 
 And now you wanna blame me 
 Say it's my fault for your heartache and pain, shit 
 You created this storm, so don't try to run, baby here come the rain 
 Tell me how can I trust you when you're still in contact with all of these guys 
 Do you really think I'ma come home and lay in your bed full of lies 
 You're just an actress, and this love is a scene 
 But you expect me to show up with a ring 
 Come on 
 Let's be real now 
 Let's be real now 
 Come on, come on, come one 
 Let's be real now 
 What do I look like to you, seriously? 
 Come on, let's be real 
 No disrespect to the time that we spent but boy you must be trippin' 
 You expect me to post up at home for you, but now the tables are flippin' 
 And now you wanna blame me, cause everyone else realized what they was missin' 
 I bet you feel dumb now, bet you feel so dumb right now 
 It's hardly a secret, you fucked with my head 
 Had me believe it was all because I did it for love 
 And that was enough 
 When really you put in no effort instead 
 You're just an actor and this love is a scene 
 Damn I just wish you would say what you mean 
 Come on 
 Let's be real now 
 Let's be real now 
 Come on, come on, come one 
 Let's be real now 
 (Real now, real now, oh) 
 What do I look like to you, seriously? 
 Come on now let's be real 
 (Let's be real) 
 There ain't nothin' that I won't do 
 From jumping off buildings, moving the mountains 
 Swim the sea for you 
 Whatever you want babe, I'll do it 
 You just let me beg, I'll do it 
 Anything you ask, I'll do it 
 See that smiling face 
 There ain't nothin' I won't do for you 
 Ride or die, I'd take one for you 
 Any and everything except your fool 
 Let's be real now 
 (Girl let's be real) 
 Let's be real now 
 (Baby come on) 
 Come on, come on, come one 
 Let's be real now 
 (Real now, real now, oh) 
 What do I look like to you, seriously? 
 (What do I look like, let's be real) 
 Come on, let's be real 
 (Now let's just keep it 100 baby) 
 Let's be real now 
 Let's be real now 
 Let's be real now 
 Come on, come on, come one 
 Let's be real now 
 (Real now, real now, oh) 
 What do I look like to you, seriously?
