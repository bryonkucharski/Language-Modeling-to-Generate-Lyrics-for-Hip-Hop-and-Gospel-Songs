Ooh I'm so excited, I can't help it, I'm so fortunate to be here with you girl 
 And I promise that you are the only one for me out of every single woman in the world, yes you are 
 And it's so much joy in the things that you do, how you do, when you do those things you do to me 
 Let us lay down baby and imitate the lifestyles of the birds and bees, mmhm 
 Heaven must have sent your love to me 
 'Cause when I look at you heaven is all I see 
 Baby you bring me joy 
 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away 
 I've got this special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone (lovin' ya body all night long) 
 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away 
 I've got this special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone 
 Ooh baby this love makin' is so good I just don't know what to do with myself, mm 
 And I'm sittin' here thinkin' God 'cause girl he could've place you with somebody else, uh 
 The way you walk, the way you dress, your smile, your grace, your sex 
 Girl, tonight nothing's gonna come between us but sweat 
 Heaven must have sent your love to me 
 'Cause when I look at you heaven is all I see 
 You bring me joy 
 Baby now that I've got you here with me, I just wanna break it down 
 And tell you, what I wanna do, to you 
 Like a mountain, woo I'm gonna climb up all on top of you girl 
 Like a see-saw, I'm gonna be going up and down on you girl 
 And like a horsie, ooh I'm gonna saddle up and ride you girl 
 Like the river, ooh ooh ooh ooh hoh I can't wait to see us flowin' 
 As our bodies shivers, ooh 
 Heaven must have sent your love to me 
 'Cause when I look at you heaven is all I see 
 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away 
 I've got this special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone

 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away 
 I've got this special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone

 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away 
 I've got this special hideaway 
 Where you and me can be alone 
 You bring me joy, night and day 
 Girl you and me should get away
