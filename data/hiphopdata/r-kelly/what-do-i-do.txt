Heard you speak one time in an interview 
 Was the sweetest lil' thing I ever heard 
 (Sweetest lil' thing I heard) 
 My eyes going down on you like a parachute 
 I wanna creep wit' you and that's my word 
 (Creep wit' you and that's my word) 
 Now I been knowin', mommy, for a while now 
 (A long time) 
 And GOD know she's been good to me 
 (Real good, real good) 
 But uh, I can't help it when I see you smile 
 Some thing tells me what I'm doin' to her 
 That you would do to me 
 So what do I do... 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 Some body tell me what will I gain 
 What will I lose 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 Somebody tell me what will I gain 
 What will I lose 
 Help me out 
 Now Proverbs 18 verse 22 says 
 Standin' by the wife defines a good thing 
 Lyin' by her side thinkin' of you 
 I got to get up, go to the toilet 
 Wash my face, and clear my head 
 I gotta take you to a broad way show 
 'Cause I don't wanna go by self 
 I'm like a kid wit' two ice creams, baby 
 And I don't want either one to melt 
 Cause ever since I heard you speak in that interview 
 It is an awful feelin' if I hurt her 
 Then some day you gonna hurt me too 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 Some body tell me 
 What will I gain 
 What will I lose 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 What do I do 
 Some body tell me 
 What will I gain 
 What will I lose 
 I heard that 
 What goes around 
 Comes back around 
 And you're gonna read what you saw 
 Then everyone knows
