As I lay me down 
 Heaven hear me now 
 I'm lost without a cause 
 After giving it my all 
 Winter storms have come 
 And darkened my sun 
 After all that I've been through 
 Who on earth can I turn to 
 I look to you 
 I look to you 
 After all my strength is gone 
 In you I can be strong 
 I look to you 
 I look to you 
 Yeah 
 And when melodies are gone 
 In you I hear a song 
 I look to you, you 
 About to lose my breathe, 
 There's no more fighting left, 
 I'm sinking to rise no more, 
 Searching for that open door, door 
 Every road that I've taken 
 Lead to my regret. 
 I don't know if I'm going to make it. 
 Nothing to do but lift my head 
 I look to you. 
 I look to you. 
 After all my strength is gone, 
 In you I can be strong 
 I look to you. 
 I look to you. 
 And when melodies are gone, 
 In you I hear a song. 
 I look to you (Whitney) 
 We love you Whitney, rest in peace
