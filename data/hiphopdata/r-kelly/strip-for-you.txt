Hey baby... 
 What you doin'? 
 Well, stay there. 
 I got a surprise for you. 
 I'm on my way over. 
 Suddenly I feel like I wanna break loose 
 Jump in my six and come and see you 
 Girl, I'm gonna do something that's brand new 
 Umm, I got a kinky surprise for you 
 So girl get ready 'cause I'm on my way 
 Put your sexy body in some negligee 
 And if you feel me, let me know it right now 
 Baby, this is how it's all going down 
 There'll be 
 Three knocks at the door, my baby 
 My trench coat hits the floor, my baby 
 Sit back in the chair, my baby 
 'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby 
 And get your body real open, baby 
 Do what you been hopin', baby 
 Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo 
 Do you mind if I strip for you? 
 Now I'ma stop and get some gas, my baby 
 That gives you time to freshen up, my baby 
 And if you want, just leave the door unlocked 
 I'll be creepin' in 'bout 12 o'clock 
 So turn the telephones off, my baby 
 No interruptions while I'm driving you crazy 
 Girl, I want you to know tonight is yours 
 Start in the bed and end up on the floor 
 There'll be 
 Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks) 
 Trench coat hits the floor, my baby 
 (Sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby 
 (Oh) 'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby 
 (And get your body) And get your body real open, baby 
 (Do what) Do what you been hopin', baby 
 (Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo 
 (Do you) Do you mind if I strip for you? 
 Baby, watch this 
 Slowly rolling 
 For you (for you) 
 Whatever you want me to do 
 I will do 
 Girl, I promise 
 Will not regret 
 (You won't regret it) 
 I'm everything that you ever wanted 
 I'ma strip to the bone 
 And just let you get on it, girl 
 Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks) 
 My trench coat hits the floor, my baby 
 (Just sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby 
 (Relax) 'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby 
 (About to go there) And get your body real open, baby 
 (Open) Do what you been hopin', baby 
 (Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo 
 (Oh hoo) Do you mind if I strip for you? 
 (You) 
 Three knocks at the door, my baby 
 (I bet three knocks, I bet three knocks) 
 My trench coat hits the floor, my baby 
 (Baby just sit back) 
 Sit back in the chair, my baby 
 (I'm about) 
 'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby 
 (Get you open, girl) 
 And get your body real open, baby 
 (What you been hopin', girl) 
 Do what you been hopin', baby 
 Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo 
 (Pull a switcheroo) 
 (Do you mind) 
 Do you mind if I strip for you? 
 (If I strip for you)
