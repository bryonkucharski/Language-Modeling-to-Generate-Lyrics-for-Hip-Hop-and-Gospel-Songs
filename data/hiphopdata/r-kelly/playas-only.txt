"I hope y'all got y'all playa's card cause y'all ain't getting in unless ya do 
 Its Kell's y'all still got the world surrounded for the non-believers" 
 Playa's only where them chicks be checkin' their bodies 
 Up in the club where they get real naughty 
 Take um from here to the private parties where there ain't nothing but 
 Playa's only where the playa's be spinnin a lot of dough 
 Honies got ass bouncing on the floor 
 This is how we do behind the playa's door 
 (She on the floor) surrounded by them playa's and thugs 
 (She on the floor) the girls gone wild in the clubs 
 (In V.I.P.) Got drough with a bottle of bub 
 (She don't care) Shakin ass just throwin' 'em up 
 I'd really like to get to know her the way she warms her 
 Bodie up now she heated got me heated up 
 I can find I really wanna beat it up 
 So her how I hit the bottle and spend it up 
 You don't gotta worry bout being alone 
 Cause tonight we'll be together in my home 
 Exit out the club bouncin' our domes 
 Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome 
 Put that body in motion motion 
 And watch it wave like ocean ocean 
 Now break it down and worm it worm it 
 Now bring it up and shake it shake it 
 Playa's only where them chicks be checkin' their bodies 
 Up in the club where they get real naughty 
 Take um from here to the private parties where there ain't nothing but 
 Playa's only where the playa's be spinnin a lot of dough 
 Honies got ass bouncing on the floor 
 This is how we behind the playa's door 
 I'm still fresh like uh impala uh 
 Dre's young guns still ridin' the base drums (Chi) 
 Four times platinum hate it or love it I'm still number one 
 Still in the hood one hand on my gun 
 And my trigger finger still make bitches come 
 I mean the one with the ring and the tongue 
 Compton uh Kelly found her in the slums 
 Shakin that rump both hands on the pumps 
 Send her home with me I'll have your girl yellin' uh 
 Kell's my bitch drunk but until girlfriend still wanna have fun 
 Pass the blunt let her drink red rum 
 Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump 
 Me and R been around the world and we'll give it to you just how you like it girl 
 Girl you on a mission step in club shuttin down competition 
 The way you walk it talk it switch it 
 And when the doors close handle yur business 
 Now make your booty go 
 (Boom boom boom boom) Break it down now 
 (Boom boom boom boom) Bring it up now 
 (Boom boom boom boom) Push it back girl 
 (Boom boom boom boom) Now shake shake it shake it shake it 
 Out the club in the coupe to the mansion 
 We gone get bent up to the morning 
 Layin back in the chair while you wind it 
 Lap dance on me girl bump and grind it 
 We gone do it till we drop it until the part stop we gone keep it hot 
 Playa's only where them chicks be checkin' their bodies 
 Up in the club where they get real naughty 
 Take um from here to the private parties where there ain't nothing but 
 Playa's only where the playa's be spinnin a lot of dough 
 Honies got ass bouncing on the floor 
 This is how we behind the playa's door 
 I like it when you flip that bump that roll that 
 Shake that drop that rope that Make it go clap clap 
 I like it when you flip that bump that roll that 
 Shake that drop that rope that Make it go clap clap 
 Playa's only where them chicks be checkin' their bodies 
 Up in the club where they get real naughty 
 Take um from here to the private parties where there ain't nothing but 
 Playa's only where the playa's be spinnin a lot of dough
