Here I sit waiting on you baby 
 Please. come back to me 
 Dearly beloved why did you go 
 When being with you forever is all I hoped 
 Slowly the rain is falling in our home 
 Come back and start right from going wrong 
 I'll be still until I hear from you 
 And I'll be waiting until you return this message 
 A religious love for you baby 
 Every night I pray 
 That heaven will send you back to me 
 Baby you're all I ever needed 
 A religious love for ya baby 
 Every night I pray 
 That someday I'll have you for my wife 
 Baby you are my life, please believe me 
 For only God knows how much I miss you 
 And for us to be as one it takes two 
 So don't you go dying on me not right now 
 Please change this impossible to somehow 
 I'll be praying until you return this message 
 In the middle of the night, I'll be calling on you 
 Every single breath I take I hope to see you there 
 If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend 
 Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me 
 Oh baby come to me-don't you leave me lonely 
 I need you here with me so return this message 
 In the middle of the night, I'll be calling on you 
 Every single breath I take I hope to see you there 
 If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend 
 Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me
