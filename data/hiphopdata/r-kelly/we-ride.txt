Uh, huh, I remember when I back in the days when I ain't got shit 
 But now that I got shit, niggas wanna keep up shit 
 But it's all good watch me do this shit 
 Yo yo yo yo ay yo from my town to Chitown 
 R. Kelly got some thugs to make you lock down 
 Voice cry hot sounds tied down cop twisters 
 Shop lifters with Benini schemes 
 Smoke greenie green candyman up in cabrini green 
 Some cats I know like to splurge on they wrists 
 But my man karate man cut the nerves out his fist 
 But yo put your hands up y'all it's love in here 
 It ain't shit but a thug affair 
 I'm at the bar spendin' thug money 
 Hustle much huh, they say I love money carats like Bugs Bunny 
 So let's slide you got the right thong 
 Ju don know I'm all night long 
 The DJ playing all the right songs 
 To the BM, rims are muy bien 
 It's R. Kelly killer camp 
 Girl can you dig now 
 Next time you see him yo he lay Mr. Big style 
 To all my players and my thugs, to the all the honeys in the club 
 To all the hoods that show me love, we ride, we ride 
 To all my ballers rocking ice, getting a room for the night 
 Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride 
 I used to be in Chitown and collect panties 
 When I'm in cabrini green you know I hit Sammy's 
 Thugged out yo my people giving eye jammies 
 Now them shorites say I'm cute when they can't stand me 
 R. Kelly yo I'm right from the belly you know the soul 
 Everything that we spit on is platinum gold 
 But now it's on the love all the players and the thugs 
 Yo it's a party going on meet me right at the club 
 We got some chickens in the living room getting it on 
 And they ain't leaving till six in the morning 
 Thugged out some people gettin' head while we on and 
 Tear the club up every time we performin' 
 Gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place 
 Because this shorty right here lookin' good in my face 
 Ay yo it's so deep I told shorty just last week 
 Uh huh, it's like you remind me of my jeep 
 To all my players and my thugs, to the all the honeys in the club 
 To all the hoods that show me love, we ride, we ride 
 To all my ballers rocking ice, getting a room for the night 
 Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride 
 Only ballers be allowed up in here 
 Moneymakers got my thug niggas watchin' my rear for player haters 
 18 and I'm livin' the dream go figure 
 How a nigga that's younger than you ice bigger 
 Don't sweat that stick the rap nigga try that 
 Call my nigga R. Kell if you need a hit black 
 And when you get make it known baby who did it 
 It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it 
 Now here come a bitter sweet note for the fellers 
 Left out the club with her friend now she jealous 
 Mad 'cause she chan't ride on the LS 
 Yeah she kinda mad but a baller could care less 
 While you sleep sleep sleep 
 I'm inna Benz going beep beep beep 
 Got your girl sayin' yo who he 
 So let's ride to Rockland's party 
 Ghetto prone federal Jay-Z shake the dice let 'em go 
 Better know I tear down every show better known cheddar prone 
 Like the chrome big Rolls say it y'all all I need is four bars 
 I'm hotter than a lotta men switch up cars like Rodman's hair color 
 And hit your broad I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind 
 Every time you order me wine finder's mortify now pop that cork then pour the wine 
 Represent New York to Chitown like what floss mine like of course mine what 
 Never cross my family can we all get along hell naw I'm tryin' to tell y'all 
 Here it is that rule that biz got your baby daddy but Jay-Z true that is 
 Better school that kid on whose shoes that is or who I be nigga V-I-P jigga 
 To all my players and my thugs, to the all the honeys in the club 
 To all the hoods that show me love, we ride, we ride 
 To all my ballers rocking ice, getting a room for the night 
 Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride 
 Let's get together and make this loot 
 All I wanna do is make the loot 
 Come on players, come on players
