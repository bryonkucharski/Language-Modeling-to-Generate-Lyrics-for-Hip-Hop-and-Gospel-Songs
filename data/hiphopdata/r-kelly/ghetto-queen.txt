Crucial Conflict come out and play, hey come on 
 Crucial Conflict, Kelly and Rockland, collabo' 
 Funny faces is all I see 
 At my place, you on top of me 
 Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi' 
 I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets 
 I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty 
 Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now 
 Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this 
 Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this 
 My ghetto queen 
 You're my ghetto queen 
 Right around the way from me 
 Watering those ghetto trees 
 We be high just like them weeds 
 Might be ghetto but you queen to me 
 That's how it's suppose to be 
 Do whatcha gotta do for me 
 Forever fulfill your fantasy 
 When you think of me, have your cream 
 Everything my team must to do one thing 
 You're the meanest queen on the scene 
 Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams 
 For real, it's real as it seems 
 You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's 
 Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please 
 Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland 
 I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10 
 Want some ends? You outta there 
 No more funny face, put you in your place 
 Come be the dinner, I'm a bring a plate 
 She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen 
 Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring 
 Personality rings bells in my dreams 
 Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing 
 Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough 
 Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat 
 But watch her stay cool, calm and collected 
 Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin' 
 'Cause she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin' 
 Right around the way from me 
 This ghetto queen got up with a king 
 Keep it clean and in essence 
 You're my ghetto queen 
 Right around the way from me 
 Watering those ghetto trees 
 We be high just like them weeds 
 You're my ghetto queen 
 Right around the way from me 
 Watering those ghetto trees 
 We be high just like them weeds 
 Where the players live 
 Have to deal with the Macks 
 Like the traps in the concrete jungle 
 Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin' 
 In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos 
 We be like this, gettin' high 
 Ghetto queen you look so delightin' 
 Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby 
 Tellin' me to rodeo ride it 
 Don't fall off, hold on 
 Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back 
 She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty 
 You're makin' me wantin' to snap 
 I know your man is mad as hell 
 'Cause it to a player and I did it well 
 And I added one more for the road, to let ¡Rem know 
 Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm 
 Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans, 
 That think they're mean 
 I'll massage you with whip cream 
 I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady 
 Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me 
 Lovin' how you sound when we get ¡Rem off 
 Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick ¡Rem low) 
 Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac 
 Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang) 
 Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang 
 Me and you, everyday keep it high like flames (your game) 
 What's my name? What's my name? 
 It's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame 
 Me and the ghetto queen comin' up the main 
 Switchin' four lanes, to the airplane 
 Sky high we fly when we roll by 
 On the down low, doin' my thang man 
 You're my ghetto queen 
 Right around the way from me 
 Watering those ghetto trees 
 We be high just like them weeds 
 Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo' 
 Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo' 
 You're my ghetto queen 
 Right around the way from me 
 Watering those ghetto trees 
 We be high just like them weeds
