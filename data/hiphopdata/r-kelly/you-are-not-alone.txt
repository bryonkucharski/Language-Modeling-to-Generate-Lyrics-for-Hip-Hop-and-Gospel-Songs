Another day has gone 
 I'm still all alone 
 How could this be 
 You're not here with me 
 You never said goodbye 
 Someone tell me why 
 Did you have to go 
 And leave my world so cold 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 You are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 You are not alone 
 All alone 
 Why, oh 
 Just the other night 
 I thought I heard you cry 
 Asking me to come 
 And hold you in my arms 
 I can hear your prayers 
 Your burdens I will bear 
 But first I need your hand 
 So forever can begin 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Then something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 And you are not alone 
 Whisper three words and I'll come runnin' 
 And girl you know that I'll be there 
 I'll be there 
 You are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 You are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 You are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone
