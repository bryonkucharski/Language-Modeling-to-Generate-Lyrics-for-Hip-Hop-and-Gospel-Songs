(R. Kelly) 
 Said I'm feeling pretty good right now baby 
 Good about our loving darlin' 
 Listen 
 Like the world goes around everyday baby 
 That is how you spin me 
 Might as well call me a telegram baby 
 Cause darlin' that's just how you send me 
 (K. Michelle) 
 I might as well take me a pen and sign a waiver 
 To be yours for the rest of my life 
 You rescued me from heartache just like a savior 
 Now being in your arms is my paradise 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Ain't no love like your love ain't no kiss like your kiss 
 Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this 
 (K. Michelle) 
 You a genie to me babe the way you grant my wish 
 And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it 
 (Both) 
 This is how our love is 
 You and me forever baby sing it darlin' 
 This is how our love is 
 Can't nobody come between it nah babe 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Listen honey 
 Ain't no doubt what we got baby is one of a kind 
 We're in the hall of fame as the greatest love of all time 
 So mamny said that this love wouldn't last too long 
 But we got the victory darling and proved them all wrong 
 (K. Michelle) 
 Just like the sun comes in and chased away the rain 
 See I love you boy cause you take away my pain 
 And it don't matter where you are just call me baby 
 'Cause I'd run a million miles just to get to you baby 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Listen honey now 
 Ain't no love like your love ain't no kiss like your kiss 
 Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this 
 (K. Michelle) 
 You a genie to me babe the way you grant my wish 
 And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it 
 (Both) 
 This is how our love is 
 You and me forever baby sing it to me darlin' 
 This is how our love is 
 Can't nobody come between us babe 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Now let me tell you how I feel 
 See our love is like an antidote and we deliver 
 Whole wide world with it darling preach to me 
 (K. Michelle) 
 This love is like the people's hope something outta heaven baby 
 'Cause it's gotta colon 
 (R. Kelly) 
 Oh girl when we're touching ooh when we're feeling 
 It's crazy like walking on the ceiling 
 (Both) 
 This is how our love is 
 You and me sing it to me girl 
 Oh this is how our love is 
 Can't nobody come between us babe 
 This is how our love is 
 Rain sleet or snow I want the whole wide world to know 
 This is how our love is 
 Forever and a day it will always be this way 
 This is how our love is 
 Take it or leave it you and me together take it or leave it 
 This is how our love is 
 Take it or leave it take it or leave it
