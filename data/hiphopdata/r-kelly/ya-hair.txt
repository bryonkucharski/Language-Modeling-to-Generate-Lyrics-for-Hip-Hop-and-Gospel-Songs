She got some micros, she got a weave wrap 
 She got it locked up I can smell the beeswax 
 Now let me pull ya hair (pull ya hair) 3X

 And you treating if you got it so I paid for the nails 
 She told me she was hungry so I paid for the 
 Her body like a coin flip heads or tails 
 Beep beep) girl don't back it up on me, 
 She did it anyway and it felt like a truck on me 
 Stop teasing hit this dro, and let's get woozy 
 Turn the flat screen off, girl forget that movie 
 Follow me to the bed room, or we can hit the back of the mayback 
 Its something like a bedroom, a lot of pillows and head room 
 Hips and thighs, a nigga trying to see what that ass do. 
 She said be careful, of her hair, do. Last chick said that 
 I pulled on her hair too. Its kellys, listen up all women 
 I sweat weaves out, you should call me Richard Simons, 
 Kells make it hurt at the same time feel goo! 
 Label me a bad boy, true but I;m damn good

 Fuck like a gorilla straight up out the damn woods 
 As I a kid man I should to play tug of war, now I grab chicks 
 By the hair and play rug a war. I'm a king baby girl wanna see 
 My home, let me refrase that wanna see my throne.

 Make you hear the dun dun dun dun, you grade the bed rail

 But don't act like you don't f** to this R and b got kids off this R and b 
 Get b*** off this r and b. you need a hook, who you call, the 
 King of r and b.

 And if you got real hair, wrap it wrap it, if you don't want me f** it up,
