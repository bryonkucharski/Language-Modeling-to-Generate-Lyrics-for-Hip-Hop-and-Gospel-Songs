Baby we've been knowing each other for a long long time for something like this to just go and break up everything 
 Here we are just sitting here knowing were all alone 
 My Roli's looking at me saying its time to get it on 
 You know what I want and baby I know what you need 
 So stop hesitating girl and give your love to me 
 All I really want is to love you baby 
 Make ya body feel like heaven baby 
 Just wanna satisfy you baby 
 That's all I want that's all I want 
 Just wanna give you something baby 
 Just wanna keep you company baby 
 Just wanna make you happy baby 
 That's all I want that's all I want 
 Thought of fire places burning marshmallows just right 
 To whom it may concern you won't be coming home tonight 
 Body parts that he couldn't kiss girl I will kiss for you 
 Just put this CD on repeat and let me pamper you 
 All I really want is to love you baby 
 Make ya body feel like heaven baby 
 Just wanna satisfy you baby 
 That's all I want that's all I want 
 Now the swimming pools out back come on skinny dip baby 
 With breakfast in the morning now with compliments of me 
 In the middle of the night please believe I'm going in 
 So hold your pillow tight 'cause I wanna do it again and again 
 All I really want is to love you baby 
 Make ya body feel like heaven baby 
 Just wanna satisfy you baby 
 That's all I want that's all I want 
 Till the sun comes up baby we'll be making love 
 And when the song goes down still we won't have enough 
 Take this love to cure 
 It will take care of all your needs 
 Baby rest assure 
 I just wanna set you free (free yeah) 
 All I really want is to love you baby 
 Make ya body feel like heaven baby 
 Just wanna satisfy you baby 
 That's all I want that's all I want
