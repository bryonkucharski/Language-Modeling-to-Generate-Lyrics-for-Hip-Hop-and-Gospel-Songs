It's gonna be a party y'all 
 Keith Murray roacks wide and universal and most come 
 Combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done 
 Non stoppin' Def Squad and Rockland 
 I here somebody knockin', yo R the party's startin' 
 Step into the crib with me tonight[what's up baby] 
 Kelly's in the mood to make it right 
 Word is gettin' all over town 
 The party's over here and gettin' down oh yeah 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Beat is bangin' up and down your spine 
 And all the single women here are fine 
 (It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing) 
 Let your body give into your soul 
 Release the freak and you will lose control 
 Girl there's a party goin' on, my temperature's warm 
 So let me freak you to the floor, while the bass is thumpin' 
 All night if your body can handle it 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Chillin' at the house on the hill 
 We gotta sing my my my like Johnny Gill 
 Rich girl, poor girl get the same respect 
 You can all drink for free and call Earl collect 
 At the moment of truth with burden of proof 
 We stacks the stuff and spread love like it's used 
 The lyrical genius and R&B messiah 
 And the roof, the roof, we sets on fire 
 But as long as the party is jumping, we ain't concerned 
 We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn 
 And everybody knew somebody who was there 
 With they hands in the air bringing in the new year, yeah ay yo, come on 
 Nuggets on the wrist, it's just the shine 
 'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time 
 Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind 
 Maybe it's all good so there's tonight 
 All we want is a party a reason to celebrate 
 Now that we got the money we dance the night away 
 Nothing but the hands up 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do 
 Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills 
 Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around 
 Me and the crew, doin' what we do
