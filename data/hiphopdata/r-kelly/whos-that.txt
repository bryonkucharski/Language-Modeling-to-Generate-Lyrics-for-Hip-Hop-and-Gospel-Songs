What? Keep going baby! 
 Whoo! Whoo! Terror Squad! Uh, uh-huh 
 Rockland! Joe Crack, the R 
 Sitting at the bar with mama 
 Shorty tryin' to bring da drama 
 But she cannot phase a playa 
 'Cause this pimp is a moneymaker 
 Meetings from Shawtown to LA 
 Yo I came to get down at this party 
 I got my eyes on Keesha and Shante' 
 Rolling it like this track was raggae 
 I roll through the hottest club! 
 With about a hundred thugs! 
 Get about a thousand bucks 
 For chicks who wanna roll on dubs 
 Yo, whose that in the jeep (some mami's) 
 Whose that off up in the truck (my n***az) 
 Yo what y'all doin' tonight (we thuggin') 
 Yo what's off up in that cup (some liquior) 
 Well, I'm rollin' with y'all (we'll let's go) 
 Shorty where's the alcohol (right here) 
 Now lemme hit that pace (for shizzle) 
 Shorty can we make our day 
 Here, take a brodda to a pool party 
 Right off up at Miami! 
 Ten g's for the best bikini 
 Looking for the biggest booty 
 She got the crowd goin' crazy 
 'Cause this track here is so amazing 
 Yo we with a little (whoo!) life lookin' hazy 
 Still you R&B cats can't phase me 
 Yo, whose that in the jeep (some mami's) 
 Whose that off up in the truck (my n***az) 
 Yo what y'all doin' tonight (we thuggin') 
 Yo what's off up in that cup (some liquior) 
 Well, I'm rollin' with y'all (we'll let's go) 
 Shorty where's the alcohol (right here) 
 Now lemme hit that pace (for shizzle) 
 Shorty can we make our day 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 I'm driving a fast car, jump to the third lane 
 Mami in passenger, spilling the champagne 
 We stop at a red light, she driving me insane 
 Yo we fiending like the **** was **** 
 Stop playin' girl the way ya shake a fatty back 
 So sexy the way you telling daddy that 
 Turn that ass around and lemme patty that 
 Got me saying man I'm tryna marry that 
 Oh no! They did it again (who?!) 
 Rob and Joe they slip with ten (what?) 
 Damuses, wamuses, big Bahamas's 
 All kind of missis 
 Don't matter ya ma misses 
 What's love got to do with ****in' there 
 Everyday a new group of chicks there 
 We headed to the islands, the games is life 
 Where the fame is 
 Shorty almost died when we came there 
 Girl I know you diggin the ditty dop 
 This my world come through 
 The whole city stop 
 Looks like ice but actually it's really not 
 Damos, blandes, no lies around me

 In the south bronx where you can find me 
 Never mind me

 I'm rollin' with y'all 
 Now tell me shorty where's the alcohol 
 Yo, whose that in the jeep (some mami's) 
 Whose that off up in the truck (my n***az) 
 Yo what y'all doin' tonight (we thuggin') 
 Yo what's off up in that cup (some liquior) 
 Well, I'm rollin' with y'all (we'll let's go) 
 Shorty where's the alcohol (right here) 
 Now lemme hit that pace (for shizzle) 
 Shorty can we make our day
