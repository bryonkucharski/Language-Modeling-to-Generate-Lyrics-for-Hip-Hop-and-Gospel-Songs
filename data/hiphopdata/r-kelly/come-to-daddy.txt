Ooh (I know what you're going through) 
 Come to me (I can see it in tour eyes) 
 Oh baby (c'mon) 
 Come to daddy (you know I ain't got no problem with this) 
 Ooh (just say the word, I come and get you) 
 Come to me, yeah 
 (Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it for you) 
 Well it's obvious to me that he don't love you 
 Baby can't you see I'm that player for you 
 Baby talk to me help me understand 
 How can you go on putin up with this man 
 Going out your way to make him happy 
 Don'tappreciate all that you give 
 Time to take a stand no more second chance 
 If you feel this way than baby take my hand 
 Chorus Come to daddy let me 
 Please your body tonight 
 (Since he) Since won't do it right 
 Come to daddy let me (let me) 
 Please your body tonight 
 (Since he) Since he won't do it right 
 It seams like everything you do for him just stop right 
 Same got damn excuse 
 Got a head ake tonight 
 How can you ignore 
 The slammin'of a door 
 Open up your eyes it's not the same no more 
 Girl you need a life with someone who is gonna love you 
 Treat you like god let you free and 
 Guide you 
 Time to say ok 
 About to make a change 
 Don't mean no player hate 
 But baby come my way 
 All I wanna do is get next to you 
 Baby I can understand what you're going through 
 It don't have to be this way if you don't want it to 
 Baby call him up and tell him that "I'm leaving you'
