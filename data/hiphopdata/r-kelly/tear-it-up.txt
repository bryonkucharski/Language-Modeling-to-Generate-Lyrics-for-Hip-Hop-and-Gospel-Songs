I hope it's all right 
 Shorty, I'm gonna go hard tonight 
 (Hendrix) 
 I hope you're ready, babe 
 (Kells) 
 I hope you're ready cause 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma tear it up then I'mma chop screw it 
 Not gonna waste time, girl, let's get to it 
 Lay your body down, got you feeling like you never 
 When I ask you what you want, you say do whatever 
 Baby, hands down, your sex feels so good 
 Staring in the mirror, checking out how that ass look 
 Up, up, up - down, down, down 
 Side, side, side - round, round, round 
 Ain't nobody that can do it like you do it, baby girl 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 Hit her in a back of a whip that cost a lot of money 
 Lemme see ya dance like ya scrip that costs a lot of money 
 I can make ya pretty cat squirt, keep it 10 hundred 
 We gonna have a sick cypher, chop you down like a rifle 
 Future Michael Jackson, Future Thriller 
 Future stone cold pussy killer 
 Take her to another planet 
 Never seen her in her panties 
 Body language real manish 
 (Girl) 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 Glad you're with it, won't forget it, how I did it, girl 
 How I kiss it, how I lick it, how I stick it, girl 
 I won't stop till you say 
 Kelly no more 
 Scream 
 baby 
 till they hear you outside the door 
 Baby, got your legs up and I'm all between your thighs 
 Poking that up while you looking back at me with those eyes 
 Thinking to myself as you coming down that pole 
 Have no idea what you in for when I get you home, shorty 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma pull your back out, I'mma break the bed 
 I'mma hit it hard, babe, I'mma pull your hair 
 I'mma get down right freaky up in here 
 Kiss you anywhere you want, shorty, I don't care 
 Do it in the closet, all over the floor 
 Up in your apartment, all out in the hall 
 Hit it from the back while I'm smoking my cigar 
 You can look out the window while I'm getting' it in the car 
 I don't give a damn where we are 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up 
 I'mma, I'mma tear it up
