It doesn't take much for me to know when a woman's lonely 
 Especially when I'm alone myself 
 If there's anyone out there that needs love like I need love 
 Just hold on and I'll be there 
 (When you call on me, babe) When you call on me 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin') to you (To you) 
 When you call on me (Yeah) 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin' 
 If ever I find that someone special for me 
 I will do all that I can to keep her in my life 
 Now I lay me down to sleep and hope that heaven hears my heart 
 Send me someone right now 
 (When you call on me, babe) When you call on me (Hey) 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin') to you (To you) 
 (Hey, hey) When you call on me (Call on me) 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin' 
 When you call on me (Me) 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin') 
 When you call on me (Yeah hey) 
 Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin' (I'll come runnin' to you, baby) 
 Oh, I promise when you fall asleep 
 At night I will be there 
 To cuddle you in love 
 And show you that I care 
 It doesn't take much for me to know when a woman's lonely
