Baby happy valentines yeah 
 You've been a lover and a friend of mine 
 And I'm still glad to meet you 
 'Though we've known each other all this time yeah 
 Is such a blessing how we've managed to get this far 
 Because nowadays the average couple would be apart uh huh 
 Want to be each other's everything 
 I'm you king and you're my queen 
 And of course we're gonna go through somethings (Cause that's what lovers do) 
 There will be some fighting and bickering (Between me and you) 
 Oh after all this have been done (Baby we'll make love) 
 Listen how we go back on again (This is a message from up above and it says) 
 Heaven chose you to be my valentine (Girl you're my valentine oh yeah) 
 Heaven chose you (listen baby) to be my valentine (And I'm so glad I'm so glad) 
 Heaven chose you (uh huh, uh) to be my valentine (In my heart I believe it) 
 Heaven chose you (Heaven chose you) to be my valentine 
 Every since that vow we made (baby) 
 I have not regreted one day (no) 
 And girl since we've said those words "I do" (I do) 
 You see my life has been a dream come truth 
 Two hearts beating as one 
 Oh is like a perfect match uh huh yeah 
 And I bless the day each morning comes 
 Cause the sun shines on me through your eyes 
 And of course we're gonna go through somethings (Because that's what lovers do) 
 There will be some fighting and bickering (Between me and you) 
 But oh after all this have been done (Baby we'll make love) 
 Listen how we go back on again (I've a message from up above and it says) 
 Heaven chose you (heaven) to be my valentine (Oh I believe it) 
 Heaven chose you (heaven chose you girl) to be my valentine (And I'm so so so so glad) 
 Heaven chose you (to be) to be my valentine (I believe I believe down in my heart) 
 Heaven chose you (and I'm so thankful) to be my valentine (oh oh..)
