When a woman loves 
 She, she loves for real 
 When a woman loves 
 She, she, she loves for real 
 She took me back 
 After I broke my heart 
 About a thousand times 
 She gave her life to me 
 With no regrets, she followed me 
 And she, and she, the girl she raised me 
 And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted, I'm forever indebted to her cause 
 When a woman loves 
 She, she, she loves for real 
 When a woman loves 
 She, she, she loves for real 
 She filled my soul 
 With the very touch of her hand 
 She really did 
 And she's got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand 
 And I like to tell ha, I like to tell ha, that I'm forever indebted, that I'm forever indebted, forever indebted to her cause 
 When a woman loves 
 She, she, she loves for real 
 Yeah, yeah 
 See a woman love 
 It would never die young 
 Even when I'm dead and gone, I'm gonna love her from the sky, yeah 
 'Cause she's given me 
 Something that no other woman has given me (Whooooo) 
 When I think about you girl it makes me think 
 When, when, when, when a woman 
 When a 
 Woman 
 Loves 
 She loves for real (oh) 
 When a woman loves, loves, loves 
 I'm tellin' you when she loves 
 She, she loves for real 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 When she loves (When she loves) 
 She (When she loves) 
 She (When she loves) 
 She (When she loves) 
 She loves for real
