 Signs and wonders that the television shows 
 Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know 
 That life is a stage and we're all in the show 
 Starring the World, 'cause we all blow 
 (Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling) 
 If we just give each other a chance 
 (Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling) 
 We might just fall in love 
 Picture us (in a land) 
 Where there's no more (no more war) 
 Shaking hands with my (brother) 
 And respecting my my my (my sisters) 
 (I'm offering) a dance that heals 
 (A melody) you can feel 
 Love is the key 
 All it takes is you and me 
 If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance) 
 Then they would dance something like this 
 If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove) 
 Then they would groove something like this 
 If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing) 
 Then they would sing something like this 
 If I could make the world love (if I could make them love, if I could make the love one another) 
 Then it would be something like this 
 Tell me why can't more hungry people overcome 
 When they've got the means to build bombs, yeah 
 We're so quick to say God Bless America 
 But take away In God We Trust 
 Tell me what the hell is wrong with us 
 (Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling) 
 If we just give each other a chance then 
 (Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling) 
 We might just fall in love 
 Picture us (in a land) 
 Where there's no more (no more war) 
 Shaking hands with my (brothers) 
 And respecting my (sisters) 
 I'm offering (I'm offering) a dance that heals 
 (A melody) you can feel 
 Love is the key 
 All it takes is you and me 
 If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance) 
 Then they would dance something like this 
 If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove) 
 Then they would groove something like this 
 If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing) 
 Then they would sing something like this (if I could make the world) 
 If I could make the world love 
 Then it would be something like this 
 Happy people baby 
 Dance with me mama (come on) 
 Dance with me mama (yeah) 
 Dance with me mama (oh) 
 Dance with me mama (come on and) 
 Dance with me mama (dance with me) 
 Dance with me mama (oh) 
 Dance with me mama (come on) 
 Dance with me mama 
 Dance with me mama 
 Dance with me mama (whoa) 
 Dance with me mama (come on) 
 Dance with me mama (dance) 
 People, there's got to be 
 A place that we can go 
 And dance out the day 
 So meet me at the 
 Spot that we used to go 
 And just step the night away 
 Please let's just rewind time 
 And go back because I miss those days 
 If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance) 
 Then they would dance something like this 
 If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove) 
 Then they would groove something like this 
 If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing) 
 Then they would sing just like this (if I could make the world love) 
 If I could make the world love (I surely would) 
 Then it would be something like this 
 If I could make the world (if I) 
 If I could make the world (could make) 
 If I could make the world (the world) 
 If I could make the world (oh if I) 
 If I could make the world (oh I) 
 If I could make the world 
 If I could make the world... 
 Chocolate Factory 
 If I could make the world dance 
 I truly would 
 Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one y'all 
 Just as Frankie Beverley inspired me to write love street 
 You know every day is a special occasion y'all 
 You know why? Cause you woke up this morning 
 Happy People baby
