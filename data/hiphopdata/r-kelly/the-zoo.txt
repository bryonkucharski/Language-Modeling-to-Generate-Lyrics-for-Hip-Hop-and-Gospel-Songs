I wanna see (your body) 
 I wanna feel (your body) 
 I wanna touch (your body) 
 I wanna kiss (your body) 
 I wanna freak (your body) 
 Wanna sex 
 It's nothing like (your body) 
 (Your body) 
 It's like a jungle atmosphere 
 And we're two monkeys baby 
 It's like we're on a vine 
 The way we're swinging it baby 
 See, you're a tiger girl 
 The way you're scratching me 
 I'm a lion 
 In this jungle I'm a king 
 Girl, I got you so wet 
 It's like a rain forest 
 Like Jurassic Park 
 Except I'm your sex-a-saurus baby 
 You and me hopping 
 Like two kangaroos 
 Rattling and moaning 
 Out here in these woods 
 Those are the sounds I wanna hear 
 When you're moaning in my ear 
 Girl you're singing to me 
 You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy 
 And I don't wanna be free 'cause it's 
 Wild like a zoo 
 And that's the way I like it baby 
 Crazy me and you 
 Making love like we was just two heated animals 
 Baby come and lay with me in my jungle 
 Ooh, I swear I'm about to go 
 Turn your body around and beat the skins like it's a bongo 
 A thousand birds up out the tree 
 Girl, like a swarm of bees 
 That is how it's gonna be 
 Climaxing you and me 
 Touch the root of your soul 
 Let Mother Nature take control 
 Over us is rain and leaves 
 So come on girl 
 Let's plant these seeds, yeah 
 Baby, those are the sounds I wanna hear 
 When you're moaning in my ear 
 Singing 
 (Oh yeah) 
 You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy 
 And I don't wanna be free 'cause it's 
 Wild like a zoo 
 And that's the way I like it baby 
 Crazy me and you 
 Making love like we was just two heated animals 
 Baby won't you come and lay in my jungle 
 Y'all don't understand 
 Like two cheetahs running free 
 African butterfly to me 
 You're my safari fantasy 
 Girl this is heaven to me 
 Baby we are like coconut and banana trees 
 (It's a tropical) 
 Tropical chemistry 
 Like the wild life 
 I'm doing you baby 
 (I'm doing you baby) 
 You're doing me baby 
 (You're doing me baby) 
 It's you and me 
 (It's you and me) 
 Going wild 
 Wild like a zoo 
 And that's the way (Oh baby) I like it baby 
 Crazy me and you 
 Making love like we was just two heated animals 
 So baby come and lay with me in my jungle 
 (I don't wanna break free 'cause this is) 
 Wild like a zoo 
 Just the way I like it baby 
 Crazy me and you 
 Making love like we was just two heated animals 
 Girl come and lay with me in my (lay with me) jungle 
 (Girl I like it 'cause it's) 
 Wild like a zoo (Wild like a zoo) 
 Crazy me and you (Crazy me and you, Yeah) 
 Heated animals (Heated animals) 
 Girl come and lay with me in my jungle 
 And the whole jungle goes
