I wanna bring love, back to the radio, 
 Can I bring love songs, back to the radio? 
 I wanna be... tonight, while I'm loving you, 
 I wanna have to find my way, 
 And I don't wanna have a clue. 
 Just let the universe surprise me, 
 When I walk into your room, babe 
 I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching 
 And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, babe. 
 Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling, 
 And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you. 
 So, let's turn off all the lights because: 
 Babe tonight, I wanna be lost in your love,

 To me, babe!

 And get trapped in your wilderness.
