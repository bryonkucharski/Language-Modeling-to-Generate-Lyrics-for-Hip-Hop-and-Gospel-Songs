Girl you're in the kitchen 
 Cooking me a meal 
 Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel 
 Walk around in your t-shirt 
 Nothing else on 
 Strutting pass, switching that ass while I'm on the phone 
 Cutting up tomatoes, fruits and vegetables and potatoes 
 Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing 
 I want 
 Sex in the kitchen over by the stove 
 Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls 
 Hands on the table, on your tippy toes 
 We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed 
 How would you like it, baby 
 (How would you like that?) 
 Tell me right now pretty baby 
 (Hey man, I'm gon call you back) 
 Girl you're in the kitchen, chillin' in your robe 
 I'm sayin' to myself she better go put on some clothes 
 Tickling and teasing 
 Doing that little dance 
 Girl, you gon make me lay you down and give it to you one mo 'gain 
 Sex in the kitchen over by the stove 
 Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls 
 Hands on the table, on your tippy toes 
 We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed 
 Sex in the kitchen over by the stove 
 Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls 
 Hands on the table, on your tippy toes 
 We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed 
 Girl I'm ready to toss your salad 
 While I'm making love, girl I'll be feasting 
 Girl you're in the kitchen 
 Sweating up a storm 
 The oven's on 500 
 So you know the kitchen's warm 
 Girl you know just how to get into a brother's mind 
 Cause here we are still in this kitchen 
 Doing it for the third time 
 Sex in the kitchen over by the stove 
 Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls 
 Hands on the table, on your tippy toes 
 We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed
