Down low double life 
 1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves 
 How could something so right go so wrong 
 Just coming in on flight 412 
 But she was listening on the phone 
 I thought I had it all together 
 But I was wrong obviously 
 'Cause what was once done in the dark 
 Came to light eventually 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 It ain't right 
 I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's 
 I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job 
 Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf 
 I told you that I would return 
 But by the look upon your face you had already discerned 
 You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay 
 But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 It ain't right 
 Okay you, you're saying you came in and 
 And these two women they, they poured 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that 
 All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in 
 Woke me up pourin' hot grits 
 And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit 
 Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn) 
 With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights 
 On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife 
 A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong 
 But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song 
 So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf 
 Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 It ain't right 
 Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin 
 Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids 
 Now every day I live I regret all that I did 
 Out smoking with friends as I reminisced 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 Living down low, down low 
 Living that double life 
 It ain't right 
 I can't take it no more I've got to confess 
 See now, I don't know why 
 I thought that I could keep creeping 
 'Cause you see what goes around 
 Comes back on around and back on around 
 And back on around again, yes it does 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 In a state of shock that's what it left me 
 Take it from a man who knows 
 That three ain't company 
 No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself 
 Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs 
 Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house 
 And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help 
 Must be because of what my old man did to her
