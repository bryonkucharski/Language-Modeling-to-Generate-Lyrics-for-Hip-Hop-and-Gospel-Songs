Ooh mmm, ooh yeah 
 Ooh mmm mmm mmm 
 Ooh mmm, ooh uh 
 Ooh uh uh uh uh 
 You made the sun 
 You made the moon 
 Gave seasons change 
 (Whoa) 
 You made the clouds 
 You put the rainbow 
 After the rain 
 (Whoa) 
 Created time 
 Now which one's mine 
 Gave pictures frames 
 (Whoa) 
 Created man 
 Gave him woman 
 Why did you do that for me? 
 These are the questions asked 
 Before I lay me down and go to sleep (ooh sometimes I wonder) 
 Sometimes I wonder why you decided 
 To keep your hands on me (hands on me) 
 Of all the miracles, signs and wonders 
 There's still one mystery 
 How did you manage... to love me? 
 You breathe the life 
 Right into me 
 Then made my heart beat 
 (Whoa) 
 Created the mountains 
 All of the deep seas 
 Flowers and the trees 
 (Whoa) 
 You made tomorrow 
 Come again 
 You calm the strong winds 
 (Whoa) 
 After all I've done 
 You gave me a son 
 Tell me why would you do that for me? 
 These are the questions asked (yeah) 
 Before I lay me down and go to sleep (right in the middle of my prayers) 
 Sometimes I wonder why you decided (oh yeah) 
 To keep your hands on me (hands on me) 
 Of all the miracles, signs and wonders 
 There's still one mystery 
 How did you manage... to love me? 
 (How did you manage that) 
 How did you manage... to love me? 
 Said I've got to know how 
 (How did you manage to love) 
 After all the wrong I've done oh Lord 
 (How did you manage to love) 
 After I've been so bad oh Lord 
 (How did you manage to forgive me) 
 Even when I didn't believe you believed in me Lord, how 
 (How did you manage to forgive me) 
 Jesus you sacrificed your life for me 
 (How did you manage to forgive me) 
 Ooh Lord tell me 
 (Why did you pay the price... for me) 
 Ooh yoooo ooh... 
 (How did you manage to love)...
