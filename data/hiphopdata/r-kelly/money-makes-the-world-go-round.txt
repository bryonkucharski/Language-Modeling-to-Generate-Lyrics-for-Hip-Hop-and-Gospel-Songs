 Money make the world go round 
 Money make the world go round 
 (What? Go money) 
 Money makes the world go round 
 TM 
 Yo, for those who live the way that I live 
 We came a long way 
 From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest 
 Fake Gazelles to black Pradas 
 Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father 
 OG's would send me to the store with a dollar 
 Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow 
 Ain't nothing free in the world in life 
 No matter who you are, everybody got they price 
 And some cost more than other's 
 When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living 
 But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin' 
 With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips 
 I play with the six 'cause money make the whole world spin 
 But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends 
 It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL 
 It's Nas and R. Kell 
 Never thought that I'd ever live this life 
 Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side 
 Anything I want, I can say it's mine 
 No more worries 'bout how can I provide 
 Money makes the world go round 
 (Nuttin' move but the money) 
 You believe it if you want to 
 Money makes the world go round 
 (Said nuttin' move but the money) 
 Oh, many say it's wrong 'cause I love to spend 
 Ice in everything countin' Benjamins 
 All I wanna do try, and let you know 
 If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke 
 Money makes the world go round 
 (Money makes the world go round) 
 You believe it if you want to 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Yes it does 
 (Still nuttin' move but the money) 
 Said money makes the world go round 
 (Money make the world go round, what? 
 Still nuttin' move but the money) 
 Nothing but the money 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Yes it does 
 Feels so good, yeah, yeah 
 So good, this life I finally live 
 And feels so real 
 So real this freedom I finally feel 
 Show me the money 
 Money makes the world go round 
 (Go money, go money) 
 You believe it if you want to 
 Money makes the world go round 
 (Go money, go money, yo) 
 Said that almighty dollar 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Yes it does 
 (Still don't nuttin' move but the money) 
 This brother's got to have it 
 Money makes the world go round 
 From sun up till the sun goes down 
 (Yeah, what?) 
 So much money 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Hey, makes the world go round 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Show me a man that don't need money 
 Money makes the world go around 
 And I'll show you a world 
 (Show me a world) 
 Standing still, oh 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Yes it does, talking 'bout the loot 
 Money makes the world go round
