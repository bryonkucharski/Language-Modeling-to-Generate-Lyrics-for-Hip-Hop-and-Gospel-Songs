Seems like we're done here 
 Looks like that's everything 
 She walks by one last time 
 Checks for her things and leave the keys behind 
 There will be more tears 
 As she's beginning to drive away 
 It's all clear now 
 There's no real reason to have the pain 
 Now I know love has kept me here and my pride has kept me here 
 And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine 
 But she'll be going elsewhere 
 And she'll be lying else where 
 And she'll be wanted elsewhere 
 And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
 And she'll be living elsewhere 
 And she'll be laughing elsewhere 
 And she'll be happy elsewhere 
 And I'll be just fine without her someday 
 That's what I keep telling myself 
 Was it the right thing? 
 Was this our biggest mistake? 
 Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say 
 And still she stays away 
 It's got me questioning 
 If I ever meant the same to her 
 How could she? Why would she do these things? 
 Put me through this pain now 
 If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad 
 That she don't think it's worth a fight, she won't try 
 But she'll be trying elsewhere 
 And she'll be loving elsewhere 
 And she'll keep secrets elsewhere 
 And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
 And she'll be willing elsewhere 
 And she will be giving elsewhere 
 And she'll have feelings elsewhere 
 But hope keeps saying Kells, you can make it 
 But in the meantime I can't sleep, I can't think 
 There's so many things in my head 
 Things she said, things that she meant 
 Things that I started feeling the day that she left 
 Things that I slept on, things that I should have accepted 
 Things I expected and the things I neglected 
 I better get up off my 
 Catch the first flight out and get her back or else 
 She'll be living elsewhere 
 And she'll be crying elsewhere 
 And shell be feeling elsewhere 
 And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
 She'll be smiling elsewhere 
 And she'll be laughing elsewhere 
 Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere 
 That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight 
 I'm out of time
