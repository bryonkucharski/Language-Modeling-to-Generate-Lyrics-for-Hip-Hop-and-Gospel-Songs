 With all that meat hangin' girl I feel like a butcher 
 Just wanna chop you up and cut ya 
 Got the whole place schemin like a hustler 
 With that beautiful skin the color of Muster 
 I can't help but to bother you, lookin' like my white BMW 
 Love you sittin' on my rim, matter fact 'gon hop in 
 Now jump in the backseat and chill 
 Got some for you girl you can feel 
 Lay your body down in the six forty five 
 Let the soft leather caress ya while I drill 
 I know you like it, I know you like it 
 Just ran into Divine with a shorty so fine lookin' so excited 
 Now she thinks we all cassonovas, that's when I put the legs on my shoulder 
 And just ride her like a Range Rover 
 Like a dollar bill I had to unfold her, ummm hmmm

 You know we beat till the early mornin 
 Daylight come and now we want a little more of that
