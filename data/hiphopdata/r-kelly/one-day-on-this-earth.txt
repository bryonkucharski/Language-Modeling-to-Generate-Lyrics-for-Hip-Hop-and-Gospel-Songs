Yeah whoa~ 
 I dropped a tear in the ocean eh 
 And when you find it 
 That's the day I'll stop loving you 
 C'mon 
 If I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight 
 I'll sleep tonight with you by my side 
 And if I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right 
 Spend the rest of my time with you by my side 
 If my time was slipping away 
 And I didn't have long to live 
 I'd appreciate the time we've shared 
 And I won't want you to shed a tear 
 If the road was coming to an end 
 And I couldn't turn this car around 
 I know faith will get us, get us through the wind 
 And I'll be somewhere on heaven's ground 
 If I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight 
 I'll sleep tonight with you by my side 
 And if I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right 
 Spend the rest of my time with you by my side 
 Now if this life gets the best of me 
 And all the fame starts to fade away 
 Just know our love made history 
 And know that life is a better place 
 If there's nothing on the television 
 That the world was gonna end today 
 Girl I'll be on a mission 
 To love you the rest of the night away 
 If I had one... 
 If I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight 
 I'll sleep tonight with you by my side 
 And if I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right 
 Spend the rest of my time with you by my side 
 We could see the sunrise 
 We could see the stars bliss 
 Make love in the moonlight 
 I'll make you my bucketless 
 We gone shop like no tomorrow 
 Live it up like no tomorrow 
 Pop champagne like no tomorrow 
 In the club like no tomorrow 
 You can have anything you like 
 You're my girl I'm gonna treat you right 
 And when I shine you shine 
 So have fun you only get one night 
 And they all hating you 
 Diamond on you're face you behind and back 
 They wanna take your place 
 You can see no never ever 
 We gone run forever 
 We gone be together 
 Till forever and ever 
 If I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight 
 I'll sleep tonight with you by my side 
 And If I have only one day on this earth whoa 
 Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right 
 Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
