Yeah 
 Uh, uh 
 Uh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 There could be dark clouds up over me, yeah 
 Still I know I can stand tall, yeah 
 And I can be the only man in the middle of the sea 
 And still somehow I wouldn't feel small, no, no 
 Ever since I found you, baby, it's been my attitude, yes, it has 
 I wouldn't trade you for the world, uh-uh 
 If I bet my money on you, baby, I would never lose, no 
 'Cause you're my inspiration, girl 
 With you by my side, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Yes, I 
 (I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe 
 (I believe) Yes, I 
 Now there could be a roadblock right in front of me, mmm 
 And it wouldn't be in my way, no 
 Even if they locked me up and threw away the key, yeah 
 Somehow I know it would be okay, yeah 
 'Cause ever since I met you, girl, I've been positive, oh, yes 
 You gave me a reason why, yes, you did 
 I kinda gave up on life, but now I wanna live, yeah 
 'Cause in the tunnel you were my light 
 And with you by my side, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe, yeah 
 (I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Woo... I 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe 
 (I believe) Oh, ho, I believe 
 And I remember when I wrote this song 
 It was at a time when I, I couldn't go wrong 
 But since I met you 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Said I 
 (I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Yeah 
 (I believe) Yes, I, when the clouds are hanging over us, woo 
 (Oh, I believe) And the going's tough 
 (Oh, I believe) I 
 (I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) If we stand tall, yeah 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah 
 (I believe) I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah 
 (Oh, I believe) I believe 
 (I believe) Oh, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Whoa, oh, I believe 
 (I believe) I believe, Yes, I do 
 (Oh, I believe) If the mountain's too high and the valley's too low 
 (Oh, I believe) We can do all things 
 (I believe) If we believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Ho... whoa... I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Hey... yeah... ey... yeah... 
 (I believe) Hey, I believe 
 (Oh, I believe) Said America 
 (Oh, I believe) America
