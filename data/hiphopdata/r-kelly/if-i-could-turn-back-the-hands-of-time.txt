How did I ever let you slip away 
 Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day 
 And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more 
 Ever since you closed the door 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin' you'd still be mine 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine 
 Funny, funny how time goes by 
 And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye 
 Woah, why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering 
 When every day I pray please come back to me 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin' you would be mine 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine 
 And you had enough love for the both of us 
 But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did 
 But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then my darlin' you would be mine, woah 
 If I could turn, turn back the hands of time 
 Then darlin' you'd still be mine 
 I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back) 
 Never do you wrong (If I could turn back) 
 And never leave your side (If I could turn back) 
 If I could turn back the hands 
 (If I could turn back) 
 If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall 
 (If I could turn back) 
 Then I'd come to realize how much I love you 
 Love you (If I could turn back the hands) 
 Love you (If I could turn back the hands) 
 Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
