Girl, I want to be alone with you 
 Just to see what you can do 
 Ow, you're dancin' all over me 
 Baby, this is like some kind of fantasy 
 The way you move, you're teasing, girl 
 So tonight I want you in my world 
 There you go again, girl, on my mind 
 See you in my dreams all the time 
 Ow, baby girl, you're so fine 
 Standing in front of me 
 Now will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Girl, the time has come 
 To show and prove 
 I've seen enough, I wanna feel the truth 
 Put your voodoo on me, babe 
 Kiss my lips 
 And curse me, babe 
 Show me how you do your magic, babe 
 Lead me to your secret jungle, babe 
 There you go again, girl, on my mind 
 See you in my dreams all the time 
 Ow, baby girl, you're so fine 
 Standing in front of me 
 Now will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 You're a Jamaican Queen 
 I'm an American King 
 You're a Jamaican Queen 
 I'm an American King 
 You're a Jamaican Queen 
 I'm an American King 
 You're a Jamaican Queen 
 I'm an American King 
 You're a Jamaican Queen 
 I'm an American King 
 Let's get together 
 And make sweet love 
 Let's get together 
 And mix cultures 
 Let's get together 
 And change the world 
 Wind for me, jamaican girl 
 There you go again, girl, on my mind 
 See you in my dreams all the time 
 Ow, baby girl, you're so fine 
 Standing in front of me 
 Now will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me 
 Will you wind for me 
 Slow wind for me
