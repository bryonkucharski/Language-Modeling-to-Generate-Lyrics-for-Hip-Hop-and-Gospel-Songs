I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, oh what am I gonna do? 
 'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you 
 I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth 
 I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced 
 And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end 
 Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend 
 Go ahead and slap me again, 'cause I can understand how you feel 
 When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real 
 I should've been a man and told you a long time ago 
 Instead of stunnin' I should have broke it down and let you know 
 Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind 
 And I blame myself for wastin' your time 
 Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me 
 But her body language kept on temptin' and teasin' me 
 And plus she knew what she was doin' when she did it anyway 
 I knew what she was doin' too and that made it okay 
 Truth is that we don't even regret it 
 About the closet I will be the first to say it 
 I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, oh what am I gonna do? 
 'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you 
 I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth 
 I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced 
 And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end 
 Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend 
 Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down 
 These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around 
 I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin' her 
 And how we get away sometimes and make love 
 I never wanted to mislead you, lead you 
 At first I just wanted to please you 
 I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again 
 Because I came between you and your best friend 
 I did not ask for this 
 It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed 
 And the truth is that we don't even regret it 
 About the closet, I will be the first to say it 
 I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, oh what am I gonna do? 
 'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you 
 I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth 
 I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced 
 And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end 
 Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend 
 I'm sorry again, never meant to hurt you 
 I'm sorry again but girl I love her 
 I'm sorry again, I never meant to make you cry, no 
 The first one out the closet 
 I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, oh what am I gonna do? 
 'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you 
 I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth 
 I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced 
 And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end 
 Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend
