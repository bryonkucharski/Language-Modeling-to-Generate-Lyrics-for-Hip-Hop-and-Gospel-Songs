Uh huh alright 
 This time I'm gonna do my best to make it right 
 Can't go on without you by my side 
 Hold on 
 Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm 
 And out of this cold I need someone 
 Oh why oh lord why why 
 If you see her 
 Tell her this for me 
 All I need is 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (One more) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (See) 
 (One more) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (One more) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Alright) 
 One more chance at love 
 Searching, for that one who is going to make me whole 
 Help me make these mysteries unfold 
 Hold on 
 Lightning about to strike and rain only on me 
 Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe 
 Oh why why 
 If you see her 
 Tell her this from me 
 All I need is 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (One more) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (One more chance for love) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (One more) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 And I will walk around this world to find her 
 And I don't care what it takes no 
 Why 
 I'd sail the seven seas to be near her 
 And if you happen to see her 
 See tell her this from me 
 One more chance at love 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Tell her this for me) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Yeah, Yeah) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (Lovin' you) 
 One more chance at love 
 (I can't stop) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Lovin' you) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Yeah one more) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (For love) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (Yeah I can't stop) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (Lovin' you) 
 One more chance at love 
 One more chance at love 
 (I can't stop) 
 One more chance at love 
 (Lovin' you) 
 (Aaow) 
 One more chance at love 
 (I can't stop) 
 One more chance at love
