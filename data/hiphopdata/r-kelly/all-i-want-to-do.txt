Oh 
 Lady Lady (rpt 8x) 
 Sitting by myself, in my cell of loneliness 
 I'm caught up, in a worldwind 
 Like a little girl, in a doggie pin 
 Scratch a calendar on the wall, just counting down the days 
 That I'd head on back that way, Sayin' 
 All I wanna do (all I wanna do) 
 Make it home to you 
 Get it on with you 
 All I wanna do (all I wanna do) 
 Make it home to you 
 Get it on with you 
 Now, sometimes we can be so selfish baby 
 In our own little world 
 And sometimes we have to go blind to see 
 That it's both of our worlds 
 And I refuse to be, somewhere in a lounge 
 With my drunk head hangin' down, Sayin' All... 
 All I wanna do (ooh) 
 Make it home to you 
 Get it on with you 
 All I wanna do (is make it home babe) 
 Make it home to you 
 Get it on with you 
 Soemtimes this road can be long 
 So long, somebody, just hold on 
 Keep holdin' on, won't be long now 
 'Cause I'll be comin' around that mountain when I... 
 Chorus (rpt till end)
