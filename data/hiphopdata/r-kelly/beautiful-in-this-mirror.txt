La, la, la, la, la 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 The most incredible vision 
 The most miraculous sight 
 By far prettiest position 
 Reflection in my eye 
 Wish I could seize this moment 
 Then I would post (?) 
 Girl I would frame this picture 
 And keep it by my side yeah 
 'Cause we look so good 
 We're going so hard 
 We're not gonna stop (not gonna stop) 
 Just look at you 
 This side view 
 Do you know what we are 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 You're so beautiful 
 It's like watching a movie 
 Except that it's for real (so real) 
 It's only right to call this 
 Lovemaking fairytale (yeah) 
 'Cause I have never seen 
 Or witness quite a show 
 Your love so 3D 
 It's like I'm in the front row 
 'Cause we look so good 
 We're going so hard, we're not gonna stop 
 Just look at you 
 This side view 
 Do you know who we are 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 You're so beautiful 
 Baby this is good for us 
 In this mirror making love 
 This ain't dirty, this ain't nuts 
 Scene from heaven above us 
 ? Under discover 
 I'm so glad I discovered 
 Sweet lovemaking treasure 
 Canvas needs a painter 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror 
 We are beautiful in this mirror
