Girl, you're mine, and I thank the Lord for you 
 'Cause ain't no other girl ever did me like you do 
 And all those times I did you wrong you stayed 
 Got my back, sheltered me from my enemies 
 Shared my pain even when it was all because of me 
 Make me throw up both my hands and say 
 Oh, there's somethin' religious about you 
 I wanna testify 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl 
 Hey, there's somethin' religious about you 
 Girl, there is 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 Tellin' everywhere I go, I want the world to know 
 There's no other way to explain just how I feel 
 Kinda like the R in R 'n' B, who's the big deal 
 And that's why I'm on my knees, oh 
 Because of you, girl, I repent and change my thuggish ways 
 Got a playa wakin' up extra early on Sunday 
 And you always prayin' for me, oh, that's why I say 
 There's somethin' religious about you 
 I wanna testify, oh 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl 
 Oh, there's somethin' religious about you 
 I can't put my finger on it 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 Gonna tell it everywhere I go 
 You make, you make me better, this is forever 
 Just say, just say the word 
 I remember, baby girl, it's whatever 
 When I was trapped you was the key that set me free 
 Out the streets, baby, you rescue me, I call you 
 You're my hero, you're my miracle 
 You're my miracle, there is no other, no 
 Baby, you remind me of my mother 
 And that's why I'm sayin' 
 There's somethin' religious about you 
 There is somethin' religious about you 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 Somethin' church about you 
 And I'm glad that you're my girl 
 Listen, all those times I lied 
 There's somethin' religious about you 
 Hey, all those times you forgave me 
 There's somethin' church about you 
 I broke your heart and made you cry 
 Cheated on you and you took me back, yes, you did 
 It's somethin' religious about you 
 See I know there somethin' about you 
 Somethin' church about you 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 That you're my girl 
 There's somethin' religious about you 
 There's somethin' church about you
