If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels 
 And all these things I got 
 I wonder, hey 
 Would you still want me (Want you) 
 Would you still be calling me (Still calling you) 
 You be loving me? (I'll be loving you) 
 Wanna keep you flawed with no dough 
 Pimpin' ain't easy 
 Trust me I know 
 When gangstas and hos 
 Go go go go go go together 
 Like chinchilla and bad weather 
 I'm good but been better 
 All my bros, chedder and glamorous things 
 Copped a few cars 
 A crib with a east and west wing 
 'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets 
 Of how to get it and keep it 
 How to prey on my weakness 
 'Cause I want the p-you-s-s-why 
 Got a lotta niggas wonderin' it ain't just I 
 Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life 
 If it wasn't for the money and the things I got 
 Shit, she probably wouldn't like me 
 But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy 
 Sip seraphin 
 Who doesn't like me 
 And the murderous I-n-see 
 If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels 
 And all these things I got 
 I wonder, hey 
 Would you still want me (Want you) 
 Would you still be calling me (Still calling you) 
 You be loving me? (I'll be loving you) 
 How many girls does it take to get to 
 Mack status 
 Player status 
 Pimps that get 
 Ya boy half rich fore we hit show bis 
 But show bis brought next level chicks 
 Pull up in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga 
 I came from the dirt what you want me to say 
 I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet 
 And that's why I get m-I-a 
 Shut the game down so the busteras can't play 
 Hell yeah I splurge money 
 Hell yeah I act funny 
 Look at you like fuck you 
 All the shit I been through 
 It's a wonder why I'm still here 
 Said I was gone but I'm still here 
 And all you bitches that left me here 
 Its mighty strange how you right back here 
 If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels 
 And all these things I got 
 I wonder, hey 
 Would you still want me (Want you) 
 Would you still be calling me (Still calling you) 
 You be loving me? (I'll be loving you) 
 I wonder why love is about money 
 And why you wanna take it all from me 
 Honey 
 My life is dark but its lovely 
 Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly? 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 Y'all bitches don't know 
 Money ain't a thing 
 Mami need a lil change 
 Girl I'm pitchin' quarters 
 Closest to the arches but live in a fortress 
 New Benz's new Porsche's 
 New cases new lawyers 
 I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule 
 Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes 
 Niggas don't possess the heart that I do 
 And it's a wonder that I'm still here 
 Thought I was gone but I'm still here 
 And all you bitches that left me here 
 Its kinda funny how you right back there 
 If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels 
 And all these things I got 
 I wonder, hey 
 Would you still want me (Want you) 
 Would you still be calling me (Still calling you) 
 You be loving me? (I'll be loving you) 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh
