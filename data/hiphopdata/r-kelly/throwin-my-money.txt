In the club throwin' money 
 Turned up, Kells and the Twista 
 The way she work it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 They way she twerk it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she pop it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she slide down on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 Pop that booty, let me watch it girl 
 Drop it, I'll not knock it 
 Better yet I'mma reach into my pocket girl 
 Watch it girl she sluggin' 
 Come over here 'cause I see what you do 
 Tippin' off the plenty booze 
 How you be attracted to plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in 
 What you doing takes some talent 
 So I gotta say that I'm enjoying what I witness 
 My money flow is endless 
 Lookin' at her work that pole like gymnast 
 Climbin' up to the top, turn it upside down then open up her legs 
 Lookin' sexy all the way to the bottom 
 I'm throwin' dollar cause it look like she finna hit her head 
 Now she twerlin' around it, then do a split right in front of it 
 Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get 
 She do it caterpillar, ballerina diamond toes aerial and vert 
 Full rockin' it verti crucifix fan kick 
 Pro pound with mils stacks spin in reverse 
 The way she work it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 They way she twerk it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she pop it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she slide down on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 I ain't got no plans tonight 
 Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right 
 And I love your swag, 'cause it's just like mine 
 Siamese twins me and you, we two of a kind 
 Strip club is our playground 
 She playing on her monkey bar 
 Up and down like a roller coaster 
 Call that ass a theme park 
 Way she handle her business 
 From the sky she make it drop 
 My money no limit, tonight I'm about to go astronaut 
 Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me 
 She'd been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy 
 Rolex that's real crime, these niggas exaggerating 
 Her ass can hold a glass, that's no exaggerating 
 The way she work it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 They way she twerk it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she pop it on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money 
 The way she slide down on the pole 
 Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
