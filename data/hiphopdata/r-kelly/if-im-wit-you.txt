I don't understand 
 I do all this for you 
 You contemplating on me 
 Or is it him 
 Or is it me 
 Or is it him 
 He told you he'd be there for you 
 And he wasn't 
 I told you I'd be there for you 
 And I was 
 And still is the real is 
 Who takes care of biz 
 Took you from apartments 
 And got you home like The Wiz 
 I'm not the kind of guy 
 To give you everything 
 But if you're real then 
 You can get some ice in your rings 
 You and me straight to the crib 
 Off the tour bus 
 Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us 
 It really don't matter 
 Who's first in the shower 
 Fruit platter from a young maid every hour 
 And when it comes down to the dollar 
 You can have it 
 All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit 
 Friends come around don't be ready to change 
 Treat me like a stepchild when I';m up on my game 
 Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain 
 So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name 
 Ooh baby, I want you here with me 
 And give you everything 
 That your heart desires 
 Lady can you feel me 
 Do you wanna be with me for always 
 Baby can't you see 
 What you do to me 
 When he do the things that he has done to you baby
