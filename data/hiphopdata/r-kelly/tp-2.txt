Hit it hard from the back 
 Roll around on the front 
 I know you've heard a lot of tracks 
 But 12 Play is what you want 
 Just let me call the studio 
 Then we can go all night 
 Girl I hope you can hang 
 'Cause I'm horny as hell tonight 
 One 
 Taking off your Secrets with my teeth 
 Two 
 Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky 
 Three 
 Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom 
 Four 
 Now open your eyes 
 Surprise you've entered twelve play two 
 Stop 
 We need to catch our breath 
 We've been going for a while 
 It's been about two hours 
 And we're still going round for round 
 The water's getting cold 
 And the movie's going off 
 This is how we do in TP-2 
 Five 
 I'm about to take you for a ride 
 Now feel it come inside 
 Six 
 Baby it's as hard as a brick 
 Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh 
 Seven 
 That's when to slow it down 
 'Cause I'm not ready to 
 Eight 
 We're almost at the peak 
 'Cause I'm feeling tingly 
 Now flex your body like, what (what, what) 
 It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut) 
 The hottest out of your friends 
 The way you take it from me 
 Girl you put it on me like draws 
 Moaning when you talk 
 I'm about to tear your shit out 
 New millennium style 
 Nine 
 Lookin' you in your eyes 
 As I'm about to do that thing 
 Ten 
 Then on down to your thighs 
 I'm gonna make you scream 
 Eleven 
 Now put your body on top of me 
 I'm about to grab your waist 
 Twelve 
 Now quick before we get to thirteen 
 Set it on my face
