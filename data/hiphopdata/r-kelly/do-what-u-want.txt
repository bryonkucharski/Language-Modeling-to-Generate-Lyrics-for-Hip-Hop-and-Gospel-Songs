Yeah 
 Oh (Turn the mic up) 
 Yeah (Eh) oh, oh 
 I feel good, I walk alone 
 But then I trip over myself and I fall, I 
 I stand up, and then I'm OK 
 But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream 
 So do what you want 
 What you want with my body 
 Do what you want 
 Don't stop, let's party 
 Do what you want 
 What you want with my body 
 Do what you want 
 What you want with my body 
 Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me 
 If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry 
 Do what you want, what you want with my body 
 What you want with my body! 
 You can't have my heart 
 And you won't use my mind but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 You can't stop my voice 'cause 
 You don't own my life but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Early morning, longer nights 
 Tom Ford, private flights 
 Crazy schedule, fast life 
 I wouldn't trade it in 'cause it's our life 
 (Well let's slow it down) 
 I could be the drink in your cup 
 I could be the green in your blunt 
 Your pusha man, ya I got what you want 
 You want to escape, all of the crazy shit 
 You're the Marilyn I'm the president and 
 I love to hear you sing, girl 
 Do what I want, do what I want with your body 
 Do what I want, do what I want with your body 
 Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty 
 No invitations, it's a private party 
 Do what I want, do what I want with your body 
 Do what I want, do what I want with your body 
 Yeah we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up 
 And we lay in the cut like we don't give a fuck! 
 You can't have my heart 
 And you won't use my mind but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 You can't stop my voice 'cause 
 You don't own my life but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Sometimes I'm scared I suppose 
 If you ever let me go 
 I would fall apart 
 If you break my heart 
 So just take my body 
 And don't stop the party 
 You can't have my heart 
 And you won't use my mind but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 You can't stop my voice cause 
 You don't own my life but 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with my body 
 Do what you want with me
