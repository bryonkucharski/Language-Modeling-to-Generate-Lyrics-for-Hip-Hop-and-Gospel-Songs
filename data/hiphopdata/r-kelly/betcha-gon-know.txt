Oh, welcome to a day of my life (day of my life) 
 The memoir of an imperfect angel 
 Woah, welcome welcome welcome to a day of my life 
 The memoir of an imperfect angel oh 
 Though the lights were low, I could see you both 
 In a lover's silhouette 
 And my heart stood still, I was froze right there 
 Staring down at her red dress 
 So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car 
 It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are 
 Rolled down all the windows, just so I could breathe 
 Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me 
 I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running 
 Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny 
 Been too good to you 
 I've been virtuous and true 
 To have something like this, happen in my own bedroom 
 Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when I get you back) 
 Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when your heart's been cracked) 
 Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when we fade to black) 
 How it feels for real 
 And you see your whole world collapse 
 Before we both get loud, I'ma break it down 
 And let you know what happened for real 
 I was over her house, me and her on the couch 
 And the whole plan was just to chill 
 And then it got hot, after taking some shots 
 The time must have slipped away 
 Because all I know, I woke hungover 
 And girl it was the very next day 
 With the sun in my face 
 I woke up in a rage 
 Screamed, "What have you done to me?" 
 And I'm telling you babe 
 I know it sounds crazy, she must have put something in my drink, uh 
 I know you don't believe it 
 And you think I'm dead wrong 
 Standing there butt naked 
 With nothing but a sheet on 
 Then she come down 
 With nothing but a robe on 
 And that's when 
 I put my damn clothes on 
 Got the fuck up out of there 
 Girl you know I know how it looks 
 (See I know how it looks) 
 Baby you know I know how it looks 
 (But baby it ain't like that) 
 Girl you know I know how it looks eh eh eh eh 
 So don't go accusing me of something 
 That I didn't really mean to do 
 This is for real, for real, for real (no) 
 Oprah Winfrey whole segment, for real, for real (no) 
 20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no) 
 60 Minutes for real 
 (Baby) 
 I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through 
 (You got me all crazy) (this is not my fault, no know it baby) 
 Somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk 
 (Your were supposed to save me) you were supposed to save me (I'ma love you) 
 Oh sweet baby (I don't love her, no) 
 (Fading away) (don't fade, don't fade, no) 
 But you gon' know how this feels 
 Even if it's the last thing I ever do
