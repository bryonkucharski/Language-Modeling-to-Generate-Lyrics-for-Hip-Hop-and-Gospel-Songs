 Whatchu know about the Mobster Elites, Crucial Conflict and dem Do or Die flows 
 Whatchu know about Kellz and Twist- two multi-platinum artists steppin'out the suicide doors 
 I ain't claimin' the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone 
 Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while I tell you 'bout the ground I be on- Chicago 
 Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places 
 Caught her starin' at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers 
 Feel the words when I spit 'em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light 
 Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight 
 The party so live, and I'm bout to set it off for the 0-5 
 It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass hoe to ride 
 And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room 
 Come let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh 
 Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think imma make her wifey 
 Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a White-Tee 
 Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get 'em on 
 After dis one night, Imma be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon... pimp on

 Tryna get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean 
 (Rub her down) with some heated lotion 
 (And now) got honey soakin'

 Wanna show you what a true playa's like, you would swear you was in paradise 
 Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys

 Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie

 I was out West at the circle when I met this woman 
 She was dark-skinned had a shape like a mountain so I know she ain't fryin 
 Put that ass in the back of the jeep and I know she's comin' 
 Says Belo when her toes curl up when I know she's cummin 
 They supposed to be cummin 
 I can give you what you want like some dick for days 
 Belo be a nimfo girl, and I can kiss you where you wanna sex you 3-4 ways 
 Like ya lips, cheeks, arms, back, middle place 
 But I gotta stay true 'cause I'm a realist so I gets paid 
 Do or Die and Kell
