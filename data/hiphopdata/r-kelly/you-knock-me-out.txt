You got you got you got (whooo) 
 Come on baby and show me what you got 
 Come on baby (don't be shy, no don't be shy) 
 Let the music hypnotize you (whooo) 
 You got me feelin' good 
 From head to feet like I knew you would 
 Baby heaven must have broken the fall 
 Cause girl your love is out of control 
 And it's caught up 
 In you 
 Cause don't don't nobody do me like you do

 You hit me 
 You knock me out 
 Yeah you hit me

 And it's caught up 
 In you

 Come on come on baby Whoo 
 Come on come on baby 
 Come on Whoo 
 (Dance with me baby- Dance with me baby) 
 Oh

 Like the father's house on Sunday morn 
 You give me joy 
 Like victory after the war
