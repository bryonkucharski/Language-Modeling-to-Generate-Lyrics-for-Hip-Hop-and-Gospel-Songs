 Hi, my name is Teddy 
 Unfortunately, y'all don't know me 
 But I couldn't help but overhear 
 What y'all was saying 'bout TT 
 See I, I know her too, obviously so do you

 Y'all I done turned her back up 
 And you just can't tell me 
 That you didn't see that ring on her finger 
 I'm even tryna help her be a singer 
 That's why she was at that party in Atlanta 
 When I told her ass not to go out to Chicago 
 While I'm out here doing my thing in Tallahassee 
 Y'all out here treating my wife like a straight hoe 
 I can't believe this bitch, I can't believe this shit 
 Everything I ever did for her 
 I'm taking it back, I'm so through with it 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

 To have these niggas fuck my wife 
 And they call her 
 The same girl, same girl 
 T-Pain and Kells, Kells

 And I call her bobble head 
 The way she wiggle it when I'm hitting it
