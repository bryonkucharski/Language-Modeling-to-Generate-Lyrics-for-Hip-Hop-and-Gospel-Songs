Whoa 
 And you say New York City (uh huh) 
 Back by popular demand (ah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya) 
 You been waitin' in the bay for us so long baby 
 We had 'em starvin' 
 Hey yo E, the big homie 
 Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded 
 DJ's want to rub it, bootleggers want to dub it 
 Easy does it 
 Ladies love it, cats with big budgets 
 We be gel two jets and Tar Smith luggage 
 Clowns talkin' rubish and pretendin' they thuggish 
 But I'm a young livin' legend like Pee Wee at the Rucker's (uh huh) 
 I was raised outta Queens 
 But rap kept me off of the cover of Fed's magazine 
 Put me in a Gulf Stream 
 Your man done it, push the EX 100 
 And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered 
 Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic 
 Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it 
 I know there's got to be a fine honey 
 With her hands up in this club for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 And I know there's gotta some kind of 
 Chick up off in here that's got the hots for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak 
 That want to leave with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come 
 To V.I.P. and drink with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake 
 The safe in the floor with a life time of cake 
 Wifey emailing, make my side vibrate 
 Cats can't believe I'm still hot, I got 'em irate 
 The hip hop boss of the Empire State 
 Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight 
 He's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J 
 They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray 
 Okay 
 They don't know how to act 
 And my B-D-S was miles ago to Cali and back 
 Minimum 
 Private jets in the millennium 
 Plenty of Benjamin's, hot ladies and gentleman (but I said) and 
 I know there's got to be a fine honey 
 With her hands up in this club for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up 
 Off in here that's got the hots for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak 
 That want to leave with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come 
 To V.I.P. and drink with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 I know that it's ridiculous for y'all to picture this 
 The way I keep reein' up, servin' and flippin' this 
 Dot the I's cross the T's meticulous 
 The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish 
 The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice 
 The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace 
 There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin' this 
 My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebelish 
 I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson 
 That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson 
 Young black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar 
 Bring honey to the V.I.P., I'm about to get her 
 Let's go 
 I know there's got to be a fine honey 
 With her hands up in this club for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here 
 That's got the hots for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak 
 That want to leave with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 I know there's got to be a girl that wants to 
 Come to V.I.P. and drink with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 Uh, put your hands in the air 
 Yeah 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 Throw ya hands in the air 
 I know there's got to be a fine honey 
 With her hands up in this club for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here 
 That's got the hots for me 
 I'm about to get her 
 See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak 
 That want to leave with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 I know there's got to be a girl that wants to 
 Come to V.I.P. and drink with me 
 I'm about to get her 
 Uh 
 The definition 
 Yeah 
 Change 
 Change 
 Plenty 
 Uh 
 Cash it in baby 
 From pennies to ten-thousand dollar bills 
 I prefer wires though 
 Yeah 
 Bee Daughtry, E Nix, the definition 
 Tar Smith clothing line baby 
 Uh 
 Yeah
