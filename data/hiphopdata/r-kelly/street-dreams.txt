Uh, what, what, uh 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody's looking for something 
 My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square 
 Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear 
 Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed 
 With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave 
 Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts 
 Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print 
 Though I'm innocent, till proven guilty 
 I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty 
 For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream 
 If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream 
 The first trip without the clique 
 Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it 
 Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes 
 I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes 
 God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million 
 Without the FBI catching feelings 
 From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat 
 Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back 
 Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back 
 Living with moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet 
 Two sips from bein alcoholic 
 Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it 
 My man saw it like Dionne Warwick 
 A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with 
 The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
 Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina 
 Trina got the fishscale between her 
 The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her 
 She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar 
 Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins 
 Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM 
 Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this 
 Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming 
 Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing 
 Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans 
 G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n 
 Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady 
 Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me 
 The street raised me up, giving a fuck 
 I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up 
 I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody 
 Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty 
 Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money 
 With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry 
 A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years 
 Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career 
 But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt 
 With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out
