Girl, you know you knock me out 
 You're a real girl with your looks now baby 
 Girl you know you knock me out 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet 
 Where ya goin' off to? 
 The beach, that's a bet 
 It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny 
 Some of those and I won't call 'em whores 
 'Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies 
 So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie 
 That's how you get your true mock on but 
 Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song 
 Hey don't I know you from somewhere? 
 Can we go somewhere to be alone? 
 I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks 
 Make their heads bob 
 And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22 
 So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move 
 I'm on my way to a picnic, we got time 
 But I wanna be early, fool 
 So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in 
 Like the old school 
 Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery 
 The sun plays, the day is feelin' good to me 
 I can just semll the funky beats 
 You know the flavor in between the sheets 
 I told my boy Big Al, said just keep it straight 
 Said, I know I got a novelty to validate 
 So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb? 
 He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own" 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 This party is packed, word to the mother 
 I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother 
 And wine coolers is what I'm packin' 
 And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin' 
 Jackin' fools for their bunnies 
 'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y 
 They wanna get with me 
 And the PAs in the house 
 So check, check, check it out 
 My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on 
 Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on 
 I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie 
 Been invited to a block party 
 So we roll up in all our style 
 With the brothers yellin', summer bunnies 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Let's break it down - 
 You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby 
 Let's break it down - 
 You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby 
 Let's break it down - 
 You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy 
 Summer bunnies drive me crazy
