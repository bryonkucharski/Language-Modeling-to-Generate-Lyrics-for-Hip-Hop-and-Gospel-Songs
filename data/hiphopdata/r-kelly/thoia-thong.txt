 I met a girl in the shopping mall 
 She had hazel eyes said she's form Africa 
 She broke it down right in front of me 
 Rollin' on her knees I said, "I'm scared of ya" 
 Tattoo on her back, lovin' the way she work it 
 Body movin' like she's dancin' in the circus 
 Back forth up down when jerk it 
 Put the thoia, thoia, thong on, now, watch her murder it 
 I had her singing

 We make a lot of noise 
 We come through the club 
 All of the ladies in the house 
 Come, show ya boys some love 
 Last call for alcohol 
 We're closin' down the bar 
 Tell me where's the after party at? 
 We rollin' with the R 
 I had her singing 
 Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong, thong 
 Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong 
 She had me singing
