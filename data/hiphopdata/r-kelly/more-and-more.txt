More and More Lyrics 
 Na na na (Baby) 
 Na na na (You got that look on your face) 
 Na na na (Like you wanna go all night) 
 Na na (And I like that) 
 Whoa na na na (I want you to know) 
 Na na na (That I ain't got no problem) 
 Na na na (Just long as we can go) 
 Na na na (The next night also) 
 Na na (Check it out) 
 For as long as you're willing girl 
 Want you to know that I'm willing too 
 And where you want me to go girl 
 I'll be willing to go there for you 
 And if you want me to take my time 
 Then I'll be willing to spend the night 
 All you gotta say is please stay Joe 
 And I'll be staying as long as your saying 
 More and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Then after that more and more 
 Then after that more, more 
 I hear you saying more and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Then after that more and more 
 Then after that more, more 
 Now, if you want me to make your love come 
 Then I'll be willing to do anything 
 And even if you want to kiss places 
 Then I'll be willing to make you scream 
 Said I'm down for whatever you say 
 Girl all you gotta do is speak your mind 
 Want me here Monday to Monday 
 The baby girl it's fine 
 As long as your screaming more and more 
 More and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Then after that more, more 
 Wanna hear you saying more 
 More and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Then after that more and more 
 Then after that more, more 
 Baby we'll be going - in the bed to the floor babe 
 Then we'll be going - from the bedroom to the kitchen babe 
 Girl we'll be going - from the kitchen to the dining room 
 Straight to - headed straight to the living room 
 I'll be taking you up - taking you up the stairs babe 
 Girl I guarantee - guarantee I'm bout' to drive you crazy 
 We'll be all over the house - we'll be all over the house babe 
 As long as you're screaming for me, saying give me more 
 More and more 
 Then after that you want more and more 
 Whoa yeah, more and more 
 Then after that you're screaming more, more 
 Wanna hear you saying more 
 I can hear you saying more and more 
 More... more and more 
 More and more, more and more 
 Then baby after that more, more 
 (Outro to fade) 
 All the ladies sing it for me - na na na 
 Sing it for me - na na na
