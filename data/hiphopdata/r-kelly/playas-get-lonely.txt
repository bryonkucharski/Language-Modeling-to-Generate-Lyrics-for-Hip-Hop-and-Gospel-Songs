 From my iPhone 
 To my sidekick 
 Jet planes 
 Schedule hectic 
 My love life 
 I neglect it 
 Had a fast car 
 But I wrecked it 
 Plenty chances 
 To fall in love 
 So many weekends 
 I went to clubs 
 In the fast lane 
 My life's 
 A picture flick 
 Let my drink decide 
 Who is 
 The next chick 
 I ain't gone lie 
 On the plane 
 It don't matter to me 
 She say she me love me 
 But it's just chit 
 Chatter to me 
 But deep inside 
 I was always 
 Missing something 
 But I'm a thug 
 So I'm always 
 On something 
 So many girls 
 Always drinking 
 And having fun 
 Life's a beauty shop 
 And I keep 
 My hair done 
 Seems like 
 I'm on 
 A marry go ride 
 And it makes a thug 
 Want to settle down 
 Sometimes

 Sometimes 
 Playas get lonely 
 Too, too 
 (And you know I do) 
 I want to settle down 
 With you 
 Baby you and me 
 Life that's brand new 
 Quit running 
 These streets 
 Take away your pain 
 Chase away the rain 
 Off my love game 
 I might even 
 Change my name

 (And you know I do) 
 Uh, uh 
 V.I.P. 
 Uh, uh 
 I will be 
 Always 
 In the spot light 
 Living the good life 
 All of that suckers 
 Still just ain't right 
 Videos and all 
 Of these interviews 
 All I really want 
 Is to be next to you 
 I spend more time 
 With my car now 
 Land 
 Of the Hollywood sign 
 I'm a star now 
 My life is more 
 Than the cars 
 And awards 
 It gets lonely 
 And I can't ignore 
 Always in the streets 
 Going hardcore 
 I spend 
 A couple of G's 
 When I'm bored 
 Sometimes

 More 
 Flying sticks 
 With lonely 
 Flying sticks 
 With birds grass 
 Flying sticks with 
 Nobody 
 To share it with 
 Out of all 
 After parties 
 I still need 
 Somebody 
 To be there 
 When a playas 
 Going through 
 Some shit 
 To be there 
 When a playas 
 Can't ever see
