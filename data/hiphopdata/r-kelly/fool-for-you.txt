Oh yeah, listen 
 I used to say I'll never let a woman break my heart, no na na 
 And I used to say I'll let no girl leave me scars 
 I was so, so proud 
 Cause in the mist of us breaking up 
 Uh baby I talk like, I was so, so tough 
 Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl 
 But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby 
 Oh yeah, girl, 
 I'm just a fool for you baby 
 All right now baby, yeah, 
 And I don't mind 
 I used to tell my friends no girl could ever break me down 
 Oh no, no, ah 
 No girl is sweet enough to ever turn my world around 
 And you changed my mind 
 Cause every time I walk out of the door 
 Uh baby, I yell out, I ain't coming back no more 
 Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl 
 But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby 
 Oh yeah, girl, 
 I'm just a fool for you baby 
 All right now baby, yeah, 
 And I don't mind, I don't mind 
 And I don't care what my friends have to say 
 Baby... feeling this way, oh no 
 Whatever the cost, I'm willing to pay 
 'Cause I can't see me walking away 
 I'm your baby, girl 
 Oh, yeah, whoa, no, na na, baby 
 Na na baby, 
 I'm just a fool for you baby 
 Oh yeah, girl, 
 I'm just a fool for you baby 
 All right now baby, yeah, 
 And I don't mind, cause your loving's just hat good baby 
 Uh, my friends say I'm crazy 
 But I'm crazy about you baby 
 Yes I am, I guess it's my honey 
 That's why your love keeps me running, for you baby 
 I'm a fool, for you baby 
 I'm a fool, yeah, for you baby 
 For my baby, baby, baby.
