Lately you're be acting strange towards me baby 
 And your heart seems to grown straight cold 
 You used to laugh at everything I said baby 
 Now you play me like my jokes are old 
 And girl we used to talk about everything 
 Like make love until we're old and grey 
 And all these photo... I took 
 You don't give me the same love 
 And when I ask you, you say everything is ok 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 Tell me how where we go wrong 
 Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house 
 'Cause you're distance brings the worst of you 
 It's like a battle of silence... for 
 Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you 
 And girl we used to talk about everything 
 Like make love until we're old and grey 
 And all these photo... I took 
 You don't give me the same love 
 And when I ask you, you say everything is ok 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 Tell me how where we go wrong 
 I remember we used to make love through the night 
 And we we're doing it till the morning light 
 ... Put you are not there 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 Tell me how where we go wrong 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere 
 Well I'm not feeling the love no more 
 Tell me how where we go wrong
