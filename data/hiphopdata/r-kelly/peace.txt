 (Peace) hurry 
 Come on in this house children 
 The war has started 
 Light the candles right now 
 It's about to be darkness, oh yeah 
 There's no telling when the sun will shine again, no 
 When it's over there's a question asked 
 Who wins? Who wins? 
 Spirit 
 Through the land 
 Spirit of peace 
 Oh yes 
 Spirit move 
 Oh move 
 Oh yeah 
 Heaven send down

 (Peace) hurry 
 Turn your head, close your eyes 
 There's people out there dying, oh 
 With so much wealth in the land 
 Why is this land starving? 
 As I look over this place 
 There's so much hatred 
 If I could I'd pack my bags 
 And hitch hike to heaven 
 Spirit move 
 Oh move 
 Spirit move 
 All through the land 
 Won't you move 
 Oh move, oh move, oh move 
 Oh move, yeah 
 This is what I prayer for 
 (Peace) for peace 
 (Peace) all around the world
