Everyday and night I pray 
 Love will swing you back this way 
 Life without you here with me 
 Ain't the same without you G 
 Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby come and talk to me 
 Let me know what's on your mind 
 Every time I see you 
 You're running from me all the time 
 Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you 
 I only wanted you to be happy 
 You to have the best of things 
 To be down with me, baby 
 'Cause your lovin', it's so good 
 You're giving me the run-around 
 Thought our love was going down 
 Baby don't you know 
 That I'm down until the day I die 
 Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you 
 Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you 
 'Cause baby I love you 
 Every night and day I pray 
 Your love returns 
 Oh I'd give my life 
 If it would only make you happy 
 Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin' 
 Spittin' in faces in public places 
 Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months 
 Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front 
 Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda 
 She's fillin' your head with he said, she said 
 Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that 
 But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted 
 Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran 
 Y'all stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs 
 Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets 
 You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals 
 I made you - why would I play you? 
 Think about it while the streets you roam 
 It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home 
 You to be, be happy 
 You to have the best of things 
 Baby everything you want it for baby 
 You to be down with me 
 So give me that ass back baby 
 'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe 
 Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way 
 Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G 
 You to be, be happy 
 You to have the best of things 
 Baby everything you want it for baby 
 You to be down with me 
 So give me that ass back baby 
 'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe
