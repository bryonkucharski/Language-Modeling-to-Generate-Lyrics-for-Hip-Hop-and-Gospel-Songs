Oh, c'mon, oh, ah, c'mon 
 I'm a menace to society, baby 
 The police wanna relocate me 
 They runnin' with gun up but they can't fade me 
 They wanted to come up but they ain't crazy 
 I ride one in the chamber with gun on cock 
 '6-tre Chevrolet rollin' without no top 
 Got them hydraulics that's dumpin', makin' it drop 
 California to Virginia, Timmy makin' it hot 
 Takin' long rides in the G4 plane 
 X Man to the stage, got 'em goin' insane 
 Yeah, got the world sayin' my name 
 I'm 'bout to make a little change 
 I'ma keep it the same, ya dig? 
 X to the Z, baby, run up on you hittin' corners 
 Phantom platinum grill, c'mon 
 X be the life of the party 
 Don't be scared, girl, reach out an' touch somebody 
 Can you feel the speakers jumpin'? 
 Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nothin' 
 Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 All the girls mean muggin' 
 'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in 
 In the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 Hey, girl, look where I live 
 40 acres an' a Maybach, Benz 
 You wanted to party but I got biz 
 This ain't entertainment, I'm feedin' my kid 
 On a 4 or 5 in the carpool lane 
 Gotta hit some corners, I'm ridin' the caine 
 Wanna ride out to a island an' tan your frame 
 An' just waste away a couple of days, holla back at me 
 Look, where I bat 
 Make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat 
 'L.A.' on my baseball hat 
 Where they runnin' right up on you in that black on black 
 So move, better bounce like a mother 
 When brother got Mass Weapons of war with each other 
 X gettin' big, not ready to die yet 
 My militant mindset got you runnin' for cover, so, yo 
 Can you feel the speakers jumpin'? 
 Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nothin' 
 Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 All the girls mean muggin' 
 'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in 
 In the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 I'm the life of the party 
 I got a moon roof, we poppin' up out of 
 Look at the whole world, they talkin' about us 
 I got a mean hook to rattle yo' body 
 I wanna talk a little, pick ya brain 
 Wanna see you in somethin' little, walk around the plane 
 Yeah, I got a lot to gain 
 Gettin' my label off the ground like David Blaine 
 So now, what you know 'bout me? 
 I'm a self-made man from poverty 
 Yeah, now I own a lot of property 
 I pimp rides, lifestyles an' companies, so, yo 
 Now let me spit you the facts 
 I used to hustle the corner but I ain't bringin' you that 
 Naw, I'm like swingin' a bat 
 Run at yo' kneecaps for comin' out ya face like that 
 Baby girl, touchin' my chain 
 Now let me tell you who I ain't 
 You can't run no games 
 I'm gangsta, baby, ain't nuttin' changed 
 Can you feel the speakers jumpin'? 
 Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nothin' 
 Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 All the girls mean muggin' 
 'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in 
 In the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 Can you feel the speakers jumpin'? 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 All the girls mean muggin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 Can you feel the speakers jumpin'? 
 Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nothin' 
 Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 All the girls mean muggin' 
 'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in 
 In the club like they wanna do somethin' 
 Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now 
 Let's ride on out, let's ride on out 
 X to the Z, Timbo, [Incomprehensible]
