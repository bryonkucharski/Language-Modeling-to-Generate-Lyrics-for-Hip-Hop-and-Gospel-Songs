This is the long drop method it was supposed to be more humane 
 Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand 
 Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane 
 Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain 
 But if the calculations ain't correct when the rope's set 
 The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker's neck 
 My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows 
 With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle 
 Man you gon' get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame 
 Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name 
 Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh 
 Keep you alive until you pray for death 
 Drawn in the corner disembowel until there's nothing left 
 Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death 
 Li chin translated this the leader in death 
 A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest 
 Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess 
 Ask the AT about the south African necklace 
 Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you 
 Call me the prison bull I came to fucking kill you 
 Have must I come through merciless 
 Be quick with that bullshit you heard of 
 Uncut mole what have we ride through 
 And always remember that death will come off swift wings 
 Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever 
 I came to peel 
 Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel 
 Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill 
 For what the bullets cost I'm on my China shit 
 Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government 
 Impaled and left at the front gates 
 Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes 
 Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel 
 By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free 
 No compassion don't expect it when I fucking see you 
 Lethal injections is my profession loading up my needles 
 My iron maiden the Caucasian the Asian 
 The information received by the ancient art of persuasion 
 I'm 'bout to drop like a guillotine 
 The cut is quick and clean I promise you won't feel a thing 
 I'll never kiss the ring 
 I rather storm the castle kill the king then set fire to fucking everything
