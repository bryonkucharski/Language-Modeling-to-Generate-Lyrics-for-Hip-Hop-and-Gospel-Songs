Man, I'm talking about that six four rag top 
 Green, with the back racked 
 Everything mat black, caught it in a six pack 
 You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do 
 Now put your hands up in the air, like I'm about to shoot 
 My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear 
 Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear 
 We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules 
 Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes 
 That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs 
 Every bad bitch you can think of 
 Swagged out, locked out, flamed on, purve out 
 Shit face from shots, your words come swirled up 
 Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre 
 I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers 
 You can fuck around, who else get the fly 
 You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over 
 Order in the court, that's what you came to see 
 The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z 
 Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth 
 Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot 
 I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down 
 Testimony testifier from the underground 
 Order in the court, that's what you came to see 
 The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z 
 I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart 
 I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart 
 I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change 
 Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim 
 That means I can arrange haters and hideous things 
 I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein 
 Paranormal presence to people who can never explain 
 Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same 
 I got a proposition for all you bitches listening 
 Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion 
 Give you what you've been missing 
 A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision 
 Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system 
 I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition 
 It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing 
 We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player 
 I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools 
 Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool 
 This is not for the week, this time works for the streets 
 Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think? 
 Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs 
 Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall 
 I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew 
 Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do 
 Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements 
 You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it 
 If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit 
 Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit 
 Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future 
 Ain't no time like the present, live the past and excuses 
 Fucked on anything, fuck it, I keep it exclusive 
 You just saw as if acoustic, this that real nigga music
