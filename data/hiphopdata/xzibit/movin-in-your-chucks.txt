Mov-mov-movin' in your Chucks 
 We come through extra whylin' 
 Y'all love it, who don't like sex and violence? 
 She got a camera phone, send a picture and a text 
 Fiends want dough, tricks want sex 
 Bitches want dick, pimps want a grip 
 Motherfuckers wanna know when you gon' slip 
 Man, you rich, you still kick it in the hood? 
 Sellin' coke and fuckin' bitches real good? 
 Don't let 'em fool ya, these bitches ain't innocent 
 They'll change the game and make the gangsters start pimpin' women 
 He don't want her, she's just a decoy 
 You gotta use her, you know hoes love the d-boy 
 So let 'em do ya, put them hookers to work 
 He want to save the hoe, so he took her to church 
 Bitches slangin', lootin', hookin', recruitin' 
 Work the credit cards, stealin', cookin' and shootin' 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators

 Beotch, mov-mov-movin' in your Chucks 
 Have you ever seen fluent flow? 
 Well, this is how you do it though 
 Man, I don't give a fuck 
 Fuck it, how I ride, slide in the bucket 
 Trip, I told this nigga to hold his bitch 
 Come equipped but don't trip, nigga mold his bitch 
 The bitch bomb, I think he in possession of mine 
 Cause the bitch is tryin' to put my dick on top of her mind 
 I'm too G'd up to play games with bustaz 
 Got somethin' to start trippin' niggaz lanes and bustin' 
 I'm Gotti, motherfucker, Chucks and T's 
 Nickels and semi-automatic ninas and beams 
 I don't really give a fuck about your hood, my nigga 
 I'm just tryin' to make all bad good, my nigga 
 Got gators for the pimpin', Chucks on the daily 
 I ain't trippin' off these busta niggaz, bitches gotta pay me 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks

 Yeah, beotch 
 Always poppin' that shit like you want to 
 But you don't say a fuckin' thing when I come through 
 I call the shot, somebody gon' touch you 
 But you ain't even half a fag, nigga, fuck you 
 Always talkin' 'bout what a nigga gon' do 
 But you a hoe, so nobody don't believe you 
 Lightin' it up for the world to see 
 The return of Mr. X to the Z, damn 
 To my niggaz in them Cadillacs, swingin' that battle axe 
 A million dollars every 90 days, imagine that 
 My habitat is black, ramsacked with heavy gats 
 Hit a nigga so hard that his head gon' touch his back 
 Dog, set it off, motherfuck them haters 
 I keep it pimpin' for my paper in my now or later 
 Made my mark for my spark, terror tear you apart 
 You better have you some heart, comin' out here after dark 
 If you gon' start, you must finish, nigga, handle yo' business 
 Because you spoke like a menace, you got sent off to the dentist 
 I don't be goin' back and forth like full court tennis 
 We gon' handle what we gon' handle, have you walkin' in sandals 
 In a hospital robe, back of your body exposed 
 I stay in militant mode, I staple holes to your clothes 
 Because it's one for the hustle, two for transition 
 For my brothers in position still cookin' in the kitchen 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators

 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators 
 And all my gangsters, movin' movin' in your Chucks 
 Beotch, mov-mov-movin' in your Chucks 
 Gators, gators
