Never has it been so brightExplain 
 Gotta tail bitches, get outta my sight 
 Bitch, you blocking my light 
 I'm in Vegas front seat at the fight 
 I'm a alcoholic so you know I'm getting it right 
 Louis the 13th 
 Hennessy black when I'm thirsty 
 I like my liquor dark milk chocolate Hershey) 
 But first we 
 Gotta bang loose for the niggas that's been waiting on it 
 Patiently debating, even hating on it, bitch 
 I started this gangsta shit 
 House shoes and the shotgun, check the pinks) 
 The hangover is over, Tila created the lynx 
 (So tell the whole world to suck my dick, real shit 
 The addiction that you can't deny 
 Twelve steps to recovery, or else you die) 
 Yeah, this is for you and I 
 Fly, pelican, fly 
 Fuck trying to get by 
 Or we can put that bullshit aside and kill 'em 
 L-B Cool S 
 Put a (?) out in Sweden out in (?) 
 So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh? 
 We on the coast, yeah, you know to the left 
 Louie the 13 
 Back down original, pack-town originiator 
 I'm full of 40's like the g-thang refrigerator 
 Getting paper with my neighbor like that Clippers and the Lakers 
 Drinking Jac' next to Jack, courtside at the Staples 
 Affiliation is vital for survival, we rolling 
 (?) Pull it up with a million bucks 
 (And I'm feeling like a million bucks 
 A all-star nigga still in shucks 
 Louis the 13th 
 You can say what you say, just spell (?) right 
 Still got a lot of Louie's leftover from last night 
 We alcoholic minded, DJ rewind it 
 Bitches in liquor, we only fuck with the finest 
 King-T your higness 
 I'm timeless, y'all niggas is spineless 
 Drinking everything on the wine list 
 So yeah, nigga, come and catch this fade 
 Or break bread and we can all get paid 
 Louis the 13th 
 I got 14 courts, all sorts of imports 
 Premium spirits, mixed with marked lyrics 
 Don't fuck with Xzibit, I will crush your frame 
 Say my name, I will hunt you down like Saddam Hussein 
 I'm crown royal 
 Coming out the Compton soil 
 Niggas in the kingdom stay loyal 
 It's the old English, linguist, distinguished genius 
 Always got a cup in my hand 
 Louis the 13th 
 Lets have a conversation on my present situation 
 I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation 
 Professional inebriation, we having a celebration 
 A live nation and heavy rotation 
 Patience 
 Hold more information than a free mason 
 It's a secret society, never try sobriety 
 SS Bugatti, live with the Illuminati 
 (?) Picking up the bodies 
 We crash the party 
 (?) And Harley's mixed with Bacardi 
 Man, fuck everybody
