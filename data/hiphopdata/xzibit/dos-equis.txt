I'm a plastic surgeon, dick shape face 
 I got Nascar novels, I was build to race 
 Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space 
 It's the next best thing, making soda and base 
 It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the people we're chasing 
 Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic 
 I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a poor start 
 She walking around naked like she my personal all star 
 I push one button and boom 
 Hey, baby, how can I serve you today? 
 Pussy wet like a typhoon, ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon 
 Immaculate back stroll, anal and deep throat 
 Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen 
 Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action 
 Shit, I'm about to miss my flight 
 First class to London, fucking with you all night 
 Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her 
 Because I don't care blowing kush in the air, dropping car 
 Feeling like spaceships, riding with models and stripping ace in the club 
 Show international girls how to do it with dub 
 While my chain swing left to right 
 Came with the party with you, do it all night 
 My money never run out, we party till the sun out 
 We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out 
 From west to uncut, working at home 
 From BJ to YJ, now the J grown 
 One click of the wrist, I compare her to gun flight patrol 
 On your turn flight to predator draw more 
 Not to mention Pitbull bully razor heads 
 Bloodline, Wu-Tang fans, police 
 Stupid, get it right, off the chain for a fight 
 Or the flash green lights meeting at your door sight 
 Let's go to war now, off the world is steady 
 Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready 
 Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price 
 Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice 
 Running bullshit over here, get you shot 
 Stupid, I retreat that, everything you're not 
 Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot 
 Walk right upon you and run everything you've got 
 Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her 
 Because I don't care blowing kush in the air, dropping car 
 Feeling like spaceships, riding with models and stripping ace in the club 
 Show international girls how to do it with dub 
 While my chain swing left to right 
 Came with the party with you, do it all night 
 My money never run out, we party till the sun out 
 We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out 
 I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke 
 Get the pussy and they're scared to shoot 
 My niggas get you with the 21 gun salute, I paratroop to your city 
 Hit the club, recruit, let's see some titties 
 Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest 
 Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess 
 I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down 
 Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now? 
 This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds 
 Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds 
 I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown 
 It protect my self silence oppressed the sound 
 You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground 
 Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town 
 Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now 
 Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud 
 Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her 
 Because I don't care blowing kush in the air, dropping car 
 Feeling like spaceships, riding with models and stripping ace in the club 
 Show international girls how to do it with dub 
 While my chain swing left to right
