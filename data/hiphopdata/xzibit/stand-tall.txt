Sometimes it all just come together, you know? 
 I put my city on my back, now 
 And push the haters in the background 
 Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall 
 Got my city on a map, now 
 That's why I could never back down 
 Never back down, show 'em through it all 
 You gotta stand tall 
 To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates 
 Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips 
 Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment 
 You couldn't have told me none of this back in '96 
 The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch 
 This is our time I'm spending mine up in this bitch 
 I still remember the very moment I was enlisted 
 I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business 
 And when there's blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters 
 They wanna debate on television about the victim 
 Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man 
 I would take a chainsaw to z...? my man 
 For all the moments I wasted on making others happy 
 Attack me, I'm bulletproof, tag me, I've seen the virus through 
 I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views 
 Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you 
 'Cause I'd rather be in hell than a jail cell 
 I'm hancock, superheroes lend me cocktails 
 I never feel, don't try to patronize me 
 I learn, I'm painfully aware of everything in my surroundings 
 I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning 
 The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds 
 I hear my city calling, here come the jogging 
 Now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot 
 So, failure ain't an option 
 How do you think I made it out that corner apartment? 
 Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same niggas 
 That taught on all that dumb shit 
 Because when the gun clicking 
 That bullet leaving can't get that life back 
 Karma is a bitch and believe me, she'll get it right back 
 They say that success is the best revenge 
 But who really wins if we all die in the end 
 If I had it all, then I probably wouldn't pray the same 
 And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain 
 My name good in every corner in my city 
 You don't believe me, then come fuck with me
