Yeah, you thought that this was over 
 Thought you got away with murder 
 Watch me murder my deserters 
 This is congress secret service 
 Got your epidermis calling 
 From the toxins in the water 
 Use the oxygen to slaughter 
 This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits 
 Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch 
 Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance 
 'Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch 
 I'm okay now, bring the napalm 
 I'll fly over and blow you away 
 No more sunshine, no more playgrounds 
 I'll fly over and blow you away now 
 There's no glamor, no guts, no glory 
 When I fly over, and blow you away 
 Blow you away now 
 The fuck can you say now? 
 I'm loading my napalm 
 The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go 
 Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo 
 HIV, Polio, positive identity 
 Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity 
 Homeland Security, false is superiority 
 Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community 
 I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that? 
 I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brat 
 I just wanted to live my life like the common man 
 Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends 
 Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right 
 Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights 
 And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all 
 Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn 
 I come inside just in time to see our baby walking 
 And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often 
 I'll be working a 9 to 5 till I'm old and grey 
 Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away 
 And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right 
 Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify 
 I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall 
 How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled? 
 Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall 
 Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all 
 Average for an arsonist, tagging up the apocalypse 
 The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite 
 All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments 
 The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious 
 This is for the populous, population genocide 
 Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize 
 Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise 
 When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind 
 But hey, hey 
 Serial killer
