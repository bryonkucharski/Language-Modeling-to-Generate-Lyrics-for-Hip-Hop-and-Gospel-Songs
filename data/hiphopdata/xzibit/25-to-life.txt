Wyclef talking: 
 Yo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to 
 <Wake up everybody> Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on 
 Bring the heat. 
 Xzibit <overlaps> 
 Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain 
 Stuck with a thousand street hustlers 
 Down on they luck 
 Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin' 
 And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin' 
 But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense 
 If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground 
 Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down 
 By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual 
 Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General 
 Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal 
 Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal 
 I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys 
 I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne 
 See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth 
 Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside 
 (Wyclef) <For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life> 
 Juvenile 
 You got me fucked up I'm innocent 
 Look I ain't do this shit you don't want to hear my side 
 But you believin' that bitch 
 You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo' 
 'Cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go 
 Where my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya 
 Y'all go tell that to my mother and my father 
 But they gon' 'cause y'all so don't you even bother 
 You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin' 
 'Cause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks 
 Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball 
 This is my third felony plus my third strike 
 Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life. 
 <For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life> 
 QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you 
 Been the same muthafucka since in high school 
 Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage 
 Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars 
 Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious 
 So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us 
 Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court 
 Think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin' 
 Indy's throwin' Tyson back in another year 
 Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air 
 Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight 
 Till I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts 
 And turn killers into girl scouts works of art 
 Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier 
 <For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life> 
 Ja Rule 
 Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short 
 Still the thought of murderer true to the sport 
 I bang with the best niggas them career criminals 
 Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out 
 Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now 
 Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial 
 New kicks new trial I don't give a fuck 
 I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts 
 Ready to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die 
 But what powered your honor to hit me with 25 
 I know that real recognize every hustle 
 And die with these niggas in the struggle 
 Ya feel me 
 Reptile 
 Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted 
 Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene 
 Huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween 
 Mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends 
 Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve 
 In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess 
 Ruffneck love liquor and act figures bloodsport on the streets 
 No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts 
 Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug 
 You 'bout to die thug! 
 Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence 
 Spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence 
 Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti 
 Guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty 
 <For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life> 
 Wyclef: Y'all need to <wake up everybody> 
 Repeat 
 For all my people doin' time keep your head up
