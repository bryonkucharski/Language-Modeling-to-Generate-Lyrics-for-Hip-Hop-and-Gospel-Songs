I luv you the way you are why is it you hate me 
 You the right guy for me well... that's what I think 
 People say I'm crazy that's because of your love 
 Why... why do you hate me 
 When you be with your mates why do you ignore me 
 I cry my self to sleep thinking your besides me 
 Why... why do you hate me. 
 I've given you all my numbers 
 And I wait every moment by the phone 
 But you have no inters in me 
 You have never phoned me 
 Why... why do you hate me
