Witness the downfall of men 
 I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor 
 Linking in Japan, I am here 
 Got the gangsta for all your chain chains 
 March to the heart beat of the city 
 You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me 
 You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks 
 It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck 
 I never worry about the referee 
 The gate keepers keep him locked for me 
 Push all to shallow, forever 
 Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z 
 Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at? 
 Hit the park, build at the car scene 
 Blowing red everywhere, look how strong we are 
 So there will be no war or shots 
 I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real 
 And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke 
 Than a power water drill, concentration, determination 
 The very thin line between paradise and incarceration 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming 
 Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am 
 They say right before you day you 
 Get the irry feeling of peace, then walk into the light 
 My soul want me take it without a fight 
 She says she wanna spend the whole life 
 But she only got me here for one night 
 Said it's time, better get it in 
 Call your best friend, I'm a call you wonder-twins 
 Stop and go like red light traffic 
 Innovation made it another classic, we made it happen 
 And big hip hop want us gut cut 
 Niggas dare too much than offense popped up 
 Another game fucked up 'cause the lanes clocked up 
 But the content sucks 
 I wanna fill up some big red trucks 
 Tour then through the whole world, motherfuckers lining up 
 'Cause these tickets won't move like crap 
 You're tying west coast around my back 
 And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming 
 Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am 
 Can't even rely on your own eyes 
 Everything fake now, toast to the bad guys 
 That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes 
 Part machine, part skill, part intuition 
 I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen 
 He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken 
 Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know 
 That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both 
 This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear 
 Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us 
 In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front 
 Caught there, they try to tear me down 
 I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it 
 The focus study my literature 
 Clean house, taking out the trash 
 I'm in the fly zone, where you past, gangsa? 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming 
 Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I 
 Gangsters, gangsters 
 Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am
