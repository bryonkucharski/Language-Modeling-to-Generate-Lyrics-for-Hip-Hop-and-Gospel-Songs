Something more, something more than faith 
 Something more, something more than fairytales 
 Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life 
 Touched in all the stray but bound he pound his way 
 And so he shines so bright in the sky 
 I'm designed in oasis, wide open spaces 
 But naked bitches having sexual relations 
 Major operation, let me take conversations 
 Sense of the intel, pay attention in detail 
 Yeah, deign your flat, not your vital son 
 AC, DC, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your bag 
 Gonna be removed when the clips just slap 
 You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back 
 Something more than fairytales 
 Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life 
 Touched in all the stray but bound he pound his way 
 And so he shines so bright in the sky 
 My hip hop is outstanding, outlasting 
 Already all stars, they fizz a lot fast week 
 Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole 
 Stuck in my style and get over my flat 
 This colors don't run, we attract you 
 Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew 
 Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme 
 I'm not the average, no one's back home 
 Super rap killer, extremely great spitter 
 Make a door, hit the door, solve the queen's riddle 
 Sinister, ailing off the bank with the sickest 
 So get up and get down with the sickness 
 This is something more than just songs 
 I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with 
 Better lines than them, they crush their dreams 
 And attempt to my sport when I do this thing 
 It's something more than fairytales 
 Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life 
 Touched in all the stray but bound he pound his way 
 And so he shines so bright in the sky 
 What you know about dead money and sacrifice? 
 What you know about people scheming and take your life? 
 What you know about these Cali G's? 
 That mister penitenciary invested movement on a bigger better day 
 What you know about the harder man? 
 We paint the outer water décor to the promised land 
 You understand, is in my nature not to walk away 
 'Cause I'm a beast, my beats are open up your chest in face 
 Call the police, it's still the same and I don't give a fuck 
 I speak the truth and all my catalogues are living trust 
 Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point 
 We cut broke niggas in what point 
 You gonna realize we came for 
 Something more than fairytales 
 Is a story of a little star 
 Looking for a place to shine this life
