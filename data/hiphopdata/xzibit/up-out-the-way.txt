I'm in my 7 deuce kelis with the slappin' bat 
 With the slappin' bat, with the slappin' bat 
 I got that rag top Impala with the French blue back 
 With the French blue pack, with that French blue 
 I got that rag top Impala with the French blue back 
 Could you loan me a dollar? Bitch, I can't do that 
 Got a flight in an hour, got my bags all packed 
 Bring it in for the huddle, a hundred and 50 bags pow 
 Want me to take ya to the club and throw it on the ground? 
 Instead I can't get by, fin this make you double girl 
 I'm back up in this, you pussy niggas in trouble now 
 Shake, what you gon' shake the city? 
 Clearly you are from outta town 
 I made my scraper catch your paper on the turf 
 Stackin' yaper like a Laker, hit exactly where it hurts 
 Better put that shit in reverse, you might cross over the ledge 
 The king of the castle swingin' screamin' off with they heads 
 Round up and raggel your ratchets 
 Mad 'cause they given aside shit 
 Fuck it, we keep it, we mack it 
 Don't 'em nigga, wut's happenin'? 
 What is it? Let's get 'em cracking 
 Millions and millions reactin' 
 Focused, no longer distracted 
 Put it down, let's see you mack shit 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day 
 All day, all day, all day, all day 
 If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the word 
 Out the word, out the word, out the word, out the word 
 They gonna walk and they sleep and drash 
 Now the reefer's on fire, let the motherfucker burn 
 The farm once you came here when it was my turn 
 Everybody up in here spazzin' 
 Prouder than a hippie, fuckin' hella pussy 
 Everybody tipsy, feelin' hyper tripy 
 My wrist real brisky icy 
 Bitch man niggas don't like me 
 'Cause their wife want me to pichy 
 But only since 1990, body, body, boom, boom 
 I'll be racoonin', me and a few of my goonsie 
 Alcohol consuming when I raisin' the grip 
 When these fin niggas 'bout to hit you in the head 
 Better pack astroclickers 
 Niggas ain't playin' and it's really with this shit 
 Ballin' like prowlin', I shoot a pimp, say it like stalvin' 
 All I hear is money countin' 
 Thousands on thousands on thousands 
 Relentless, put the pousie 
 Look tall player, no jawsin' 
 All about my allowance 
 And the money countin', just countin' 
 Sheesh but bitch I'm heavy off in these streets 
 UFC front seats, no salmon man, we feast 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day 
 All day all day all day all day 
 If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the word 
 Out the word out the word out the word out the word 
 Let's get whatever you drinkin' and drink it by the case 
 Then let me pound on your pussy and knock it out of place 
 I wanna hook you and book you, hedges sometimes the face 
 While we vacate in the destination for motivation, ace 
 Separate hundreds from 50's 
 Ball it up, bring it all with me 
 Call it an audible hit me, I'm open, never forget me 
 Down shit punchin' approachin', 160 
 I'm crawling like Pauline LeBailey 
 Bouncing around the city, pity you feelin' shitty 
 It's 25 to life for this pushin' 
 And spike off did anybody hit by a sniper 
 Live the rest of your life in a diper or chill the fuck out 
 Oh you can walk? Better keep walkin' or they could carry you out 
 This is the end of the drought, homies is bouncing around me 
 Too many 0's to count, I let these women surround me 
 Jump off their clothes to give mouth 
 But then they never confine me 
 Holding unholy amounts 
 Already showed you the route 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 I'm a rich ass nigga 
 (You's a bitch ass nigga) 
 Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day 
 All day all day all day all day 
 If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the word 
 Out the word out the word out the word out the word
