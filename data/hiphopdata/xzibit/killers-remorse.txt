I'm sorry I met you 
 I'm sorry I hurt you 
 I'm sorry I killed you 
 I'm sorry I murked you 
 Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me 
 Nobody to threaten that they about come get me 
 I wish I could go back to where we began 
 I wish you was alive so I could kill you again 
 I wish we had more paths to cross 
 Nobody even cares if they survive my loss 
 My killer's remorse 
 For me we are the same should be laughed at 
 Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked 
 You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back 
 I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that 
 You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath 
 I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left 
 My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately 
 Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately 
 I'm so christian I'm so muslim 
 Super size on your mom trigger get push up 
 I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking 
 And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked 
 To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you 
 Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off 
 I said memories fade just as blood washes off 
 Hope to see you soon 
 I feel so guilty my hands are filthy 
 From decorating your face all over the building 
 I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear 
 I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here 
 But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam 
 I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam 
 I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie 
 We smoked you like the weed in the bong 
 Have you ever seen the bloodstain 
 And know that person has returned from every once came 
 Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain 
 But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing 
 What's done is done chop that shit up to the game 
 You're still dead when I'm still alive 
 And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi 
 Started the bullshit escalated to violence 
 In result of the violence infinite permanent silence 
 Now I feel empty not even existing 
 My worst enemy is no longer against me 
 I remember the hatred and how it consumed me 
 And you felt the same thing but never could move me 
 A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies 
 The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving 
 So I should rejoice now because you are past tense 
 The last of my enemies the last of you bastards 
 The dirt on your casket 
 I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out 
 And I just sold out and wait for the contact 
 And life for the combat and now we be on that 
 And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now 
 What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down
