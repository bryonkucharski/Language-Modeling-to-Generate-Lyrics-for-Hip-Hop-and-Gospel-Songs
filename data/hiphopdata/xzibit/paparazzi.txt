Yes, 
 1996, Disfunctional member of the Alkohaliks family 
 It's XZIBIT, Bring it live, one time, like this 
 Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while 
 Xzibit stay versitile 
 With Million Dollar lifestyle 
 And I could feel it as a child growin' up 
 The niggaz that was real and the niggaz that was scared as fuck 
 That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few 
 You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you 
 So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin' shit 
 It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin' with 
 I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof tickets 
 Nigga you make a gang of noise and never sing like a cricket 
 I guess that's why we never kick it 
 A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin' to fuck with the liquid 
 How many niggaz do you know like this? 
 Always claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch 
 It don't make sense 
 Either you're a soldier from the start 
 Or an actor with a record deal tryin' to play the part 
 Like that 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Extra large 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Paparazzi (2x) 
 I don't need no lights no cameras 
 Just action god dammit 
 Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet 
 So my composure is kept while others start to sweat 
 Emergin from the fog with my fucked up dialogue 
 Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt 
 And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck 
 Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis 
 Home of the scandalous 
 Big Bad Los Angeles 
 Dangerous, Vandelous 
 Yo, not to be trusted 
 So how the fuck is you hard 
 Not being scared by the boulevard 
 I'm pulling that card and sayin' Gin motherfucker 
 Flowin like liquid, soak it in motherfucker 
 I'm breakin it down, my sound surrounds like death 
 From the West 
 Puttin' whole counties to the test 
 It's all in perspective 
 Break a one-nine copy 
 This is for the niggaz gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Extra large 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Paparazzi (2x) 
 Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress 
 But I just played it back 
 Others going through schemes and pipe dreams 
 For a contract 
 Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel 
 I made a cool half mil 
 Before I had a record deal 
 Therefore you look and stare like it's magic 
 But too much of anything can make you a addict 
 When devils be startin static, bring out the automatic 
 I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait 
 Who dare to cross this path 
 Yo, I'll do ya like math 
 Cut with glass, make a blood bath 
 So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with 
 Smoke them blunts with 
 I dispose of your punk shit 
 Keep it all in perspective 
 Carbon Copies gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi 
 Once again, It's the liquidation crew, and we return for you 
 Like this 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Extra large 
 It's a shame 
 Niggaz in the rap game 
 Only for the money and the fame 
 Paparazzi (2x)
