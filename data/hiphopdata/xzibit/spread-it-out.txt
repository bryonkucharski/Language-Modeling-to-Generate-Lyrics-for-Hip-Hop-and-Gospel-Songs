I'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it 
 Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon 
 I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood 
 Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood 
 I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice 
 Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice 
 This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage 
 Conversation with God, spilling my soul out 
 I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron 
 The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone 
 So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones 
 Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind 
 Put my motherfucker records on 
 So they can relate to the hate and the pain 
 To the struggle and strain 
 Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same 
 Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain 
 So now 
 Let's spread it out, nigga 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out 
 It go ooh, ooh 
 And you can't get none, you don't want none 
 You can't get none 
 Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones 
 I try not to get involved with the nonsense 
 I'm from the time where you couldn't pause comments 
 Couldn't hide behind a computer 
 Catch a fatal get shot by a shooter 
 A barracuda for Buddha 
 I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion 
 My bad, sorry for all the confusion 
 If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done 
 The saga continue, bring it back on the one 
 I'm coming back with a gun, 'cause I saw that I know 
 Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go 
 Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression 
 A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion 
 And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference? 
 I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction 
 They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good 
 Make you well understood, put you back where you should be 
 This go for all my people, people who see we're equal 
 I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil 
 We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion 
 People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere 
 Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger 
 We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at 
 Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights 
 She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night 
 But she know that you go off with that stripping ho 
 While your woman is wondering where does all your money go 
 You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain 
 Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere 
 Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game 
 Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain 
 Children retain, remember living upon the pain 
 That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same 
 Yeah, so spread it out, nigga
