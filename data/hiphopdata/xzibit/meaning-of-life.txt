So what's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life 
 Man I don't know, I don't know 
 All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage 
 Grand arsony 'cause I'm still in the show 
 What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life 
 Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya 
 All I know if you spend too much time without being refined 
 Then your life will be described as a failure 
 Let me tell you about this bitch ass half cock pussy ass niggas 
 It's never gonna pull the trigger to protect no figures 
 Never seen a hard time in your life beating the shit out of your kids and your wife 
 Because what you lack in a fight 
 That we all fight similar self aided mutilation 
 Never lost angel Los Angeles congratulations 
 From admiration to aggravation to the highest level 
 Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle 
 Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all 
 Praying for my downfall got the fuck from around y'all 
 Know when niggas bringing me down even include myself 
 I celebrate life for nobody else 
 Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health 
 Memento tried in stealth 
 Explain Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fail for the dollar 
 Now watch Xzibit rise to power 
 I turn these fifteen minutes to hours 
 But still ask 
 Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits 
 Caught up into politics 
 Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it 
 Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast 
 Becoming one with technology surveillance's a bitch 
 And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone 
 The few will see freedom while most of the masses will conform 
 The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war 
 Immaculate platform 
 We back and prepared for 'em attacking the land lords 
 'Cause the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for 
 And if I should die may it not be in vain more 
 Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly 
 Got my future in front of me focus is fucking phenomenal 
 Nobody can touch us I turn the impossible possible with it 
 Do me a favor man do not try to tell me shit 
 It's just me and my bitch 
 When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body 
 I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries 
 My father was there, my wife was there, my children 
 That was alot of my motivation because I knew the way that they were looking at me 
 I had to get stronger I had to become independent again 
 And I think that's why I pushed so hard 
 Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights 
 Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife 
 And not to mention time is short you better make it right 
 Before you see that final light get all your business tight 
 This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone 
 So get it on into your destiny and set the stone 
 The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death 
 So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets 
 This for the set this for the ones that never waken up 
 Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck 
 They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth 
 That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof 
 Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth 
 It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute 
 That's why they shoot have your ass in a box dressed in a suit 
 'Bout time you got in touch with your roots 
 The best help that you can do is help yourself 
 You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you 
 To pull yourself through it because you know you can 
 You can have people pull you everyday 
 But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward 
 Then you're gonna be stuck in the road 
 Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing 
 And holding you back 
 The only person that can set you free is yourself
