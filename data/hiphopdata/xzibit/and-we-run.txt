It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear 
 You were never free, and you never realized 
 And love, is a word you've never heard 
 Your heart is cold cause it burns, the desire to leave the mind 
 Take your breath till nothing's left 
 Stars of life upon your chest 
 And I know you wherever you go 
 And we run and we don't look back 
 And we run till we've had enough 
 And we run, tell me how to run 
 And we run, till we break down 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 And we run till we've had enough 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head. We gotta get gone 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 And we run, for this killing love 
 And we run, tell me how it's enough 
 And we run, far ahead we go 
 I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain 
 Never looked back, never quit, worked through the pain 
 This blood in my veins run cold when I hate 
 Give enough to keep sane but I never lose hope 
 This is my time now, no time for tears to celebrate 
 Put it in the air right now 
 Never back down, you'll never wear my crown 
 Cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch 
 This is what I've never loved so much 
 Get involved what's the worst stand up 
 Here my mic before I ever get far 
 Man in lights, you lost all my trust 
 Now it's time to face all of us 
 Get in line just to spar with us 
 And it feels so far from us, just take my hand and run 
 And we run, for this killing love 
 And we run, tell me how it's enough 
 And we run, till we never don 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 And we run, till it's enough 
 Yeah, we out of here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 And we run, for this killing love 
 And we run, tell me how it's enough 
 And we run, till we never don 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 And we run, till it's enough 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it 
 Lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone 
 Yeah, we outta here
