Maybe it's time I change religions on you turning Christians 
 To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian 
 Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it 
 Sipping red wine inside the pentagon 
 Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone 
 Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN 
 My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians 
 Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master 
 The mic is my sword the booth is your casket 
 I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet 
 Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit 
 Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes 
 Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow 
 Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck 
 Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up 
 I think it's time you salute me or shoot me 
 Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth 
 They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse 
 It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt 
 Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt 
 This automatic will turn your home into a hearse 
 Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial 
 They gonna have to bury your twice 
 The scary cat on this night life 
 The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight 
 My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk 
 Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch 
 She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental 
 Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all 
 I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge 
 Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor 
 Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more 
 Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi 
 We turn your block to a motherfucking movie 
 Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you 
 But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you 
 Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me 
 Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie 
 Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings 
 Rep in the full train smoke in solely green 
 I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor 
 I might made my super armor running from karma 
 The good die young no country for old men 
 There will be blood deeper than leviathan 
 And my platoon full of bad lieutenants 
 X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals 
 Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow 
 48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango 
 Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the 
 Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life 
 Miami Vice what to get right 
 It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing 
 Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels 
 Above the hunger games 
 The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring 
 Because the devil wears prada 
 The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather 
 Animal house, standing to live with the case speech 
 Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach 
 Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven 
 The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend 
 Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express 
 With this American History X 
 Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum 
 Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium 
 Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game 
 Like fluorine or sodium on a door 
 But holy I'm only in it for the cash part 
 Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport 
 With officer walking and my side mirror in 
 He don't like me 'cause I'm dark as an nigerian 
 Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian 
 In the look in the American eyes said I'd bury him 
 I said it before don't ignore it again too 
 Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due 
 Life's a hooker the hall raised me 
 This poor baby was born crazy 
 Put in the middle of drug wars 
 Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me 
 Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie 
 Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you 
 But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you 
 Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me 
 Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie 
 Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you 
 But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
