Everyday lead to late nights 
 Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite. 
 Homie, pass me a light, I got that master kush 
 Gave birth to you, bastards, told your momma the bush 
 Now here you are, I see you're feeling strong 
 My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long 
 Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate 
 I wait my banner a piece, won't you take the paper? 
 Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face 
 Hit you with the cage, back in place, rip another page off the book of life 
 Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate 
 My motive for motivating my niggas, come on 
 Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see 
 I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a G 
 All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed 
 Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need 
 A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made 
 Won't you change, I want you stay the same 
 But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G 
 I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G 
 It's getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive 
 Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies 
 Too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping 
 Niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action 
 Do you, do you? 
 Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do 
 'Cause when I bring it to the whole court 
 Putting up a play of stats, while you're hanging with the roaches 
 And rats, we're way above that 
 Now how you're loving that? 
 Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch 
 I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch 
 Can't believe how deep in your shit 
 Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate 
 My motive for motivating my niggas, come on 
 Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see 
 I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G 
 All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed 
 Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need 
 A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made 
 Won't you change, I want you stay the same 
 But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G 
 I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G 
 The greatest trip that devil ever put together 
 Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection 
 I see the down could crawl, quickly spreading like gun infection 
 And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon 
 If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through 
 Shoul've been a screen play when I get to 
 More niggas away, IET, quit playing games in the middle 
 Of the street, fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me? 
 We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now 
 Back for the forth fly, back to the back who was back with a tour bus 
 Get it round the world for a few months 
 Down dead, way niggas gotta dumb trunk 
 Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate 
 My motive for motivating my niggas, come on 
 Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see 
 I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G 
 All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed 
 Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need 
 A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made 
 Won't you change, I want you stay the same 
 But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G 
 I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G
