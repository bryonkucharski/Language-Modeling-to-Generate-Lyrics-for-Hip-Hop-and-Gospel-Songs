Introducin' the X-Man, phenomenal, 
 X-Files, the chronicle, 
 Aerostatical, nautical, 
 Magnificent beast. 
 Xzibit stick to the logic, 
 You can be bullish and rollick, 
 Yo ass will still get demolished, 
 Polished, and keeping' a mulish. 
 My niggas eat like piranhas, 
 We party stupid, retarded, 
 Most niggas jaded and guarded 
 'Cause they not popular product. 
 This ain't no Gucci or Prada, 
 This is a topless Impala, 
 North Hollywood body armor 
 For when they come with the drama. 
 (For when they come with the drama.) 
 So I continue the saga, 
 Move out the path of the lava, 
 Move in position and conquer. 
 You have created a monster, 
 Wake up and call out the culprit. 
 I never weaken or soften, 
 Might catch me weezin' and coughin' 
 Because I blaze very often, 
 I need to knock this shit off of shit 
 I got problems my nigga, 
 And they get bigger and bigger. 
 You can not solve, what a thriller. 
 This is a pivotal moment, 
 This is my time of atoning, 
 This is my world and I own it, 
 So come and take if you want it, 
 Please God forgive me for sinnin', 
 Winnin', and makin' a killin', 
 Witness revenge of the villains. 
 Sexual healin' from women, 
 I bust a nut to their ceilin', 
 I crash a plain in their buildin', 
 But now I'm married with children. 
 Katal and balance the millions. 
 I'm in another direction, 
 Life bless is taking it's blessin's, 
 You need to hear my confession. 
 Forever walk with a weapon, 
 I live and die like a soldier, 
 (I live and die like a soldier) 
 C'mon let's take this shit over. 
 Make patches and master my master piece, 
 Niggas have the audacity, 
 Trynna adapt to capacities 
 Of your highness, your majesty. 
 What the fuck is you asking me? 
 With my accurate accuracy, 
 Immaculate faculties, 
 With a nation in back of me. 
 I see promising situations evolve into tragedies, 
 I just hustle and hustle because it comes to me naturally. 
 I'm a buffalo soldier clappin' you back to Jehovah, 
 C'mon let's take this shit over. 
 (C'mon let's take this shit over.) 
 I'm a super nova eclipse 
 On your current events. 
 This ain't no novelty spittin' hotter than barbeque bits, 
 Lorena Bobbit, you ditched! 
 Trigger's still good in my grip, 
 You showin' off for the cameras while I just stick to the script. 
 People get Hollywood quick, 
 When people thinkin' you sinkin', 
 I got everybody thinkin' I got a problem with drinkin'. 
 I'm just enjoyin' my weekends so stay the fuck out my business! 
 I roll with serial killers. 
 (We fuckin' serial killers.)
