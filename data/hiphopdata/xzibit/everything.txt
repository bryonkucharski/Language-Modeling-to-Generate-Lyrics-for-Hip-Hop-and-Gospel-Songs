I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen 
 I remember underage drinking at sixteen 
 Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen 
 Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything 
 My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me 
 Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet 
 Then everything I write around got a cotton seat 
 Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly 
 Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions 
 The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position 
 But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag 
 Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass 
 Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out 
 Picking the shit up where I left off 
 You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel 
 I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle 
 Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business 
 Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance 
 Make every revenue street flood to where it took me 
 And make that money stack higher than giraffes 
 I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen 
 I remember underage drinking at sixteen 
 Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen 
 Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything 
 I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack 
 So it will leave no shells at the scene where I was getting my kid back 
 Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up 
 On hard to make the west defined a united fund 
 Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck 
 So I can crush the corner, welcome to California 
 Where people fake it till they make it or take it with their hand gun 
 Take your chances, swing, try to land one 
 Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness 
 My symphony deliver something classic 
 Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it 
 Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with? 
 I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity 
 People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony 
 Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back 
 Gave my girl a son and my last name 
 I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen 
 And I remember underage drinking at sixteen 
 Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen 
 Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything 
 They're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion 
 I'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in 
 Nobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed 
 'Cause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything 
 Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in 
 When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins 
 Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in 
 Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything 
 Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind 
 Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind 
 Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors 
 You mould them and lead them, fuck the positive message 
 This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence 
 There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence 
 Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me 
 And make that money stack high and you run a pussy 
 I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen 
 I remember underage drinking at sixteen 
 Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen 
 Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything 
 They're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion 
 I'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in 
 Nobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed 
 'Cause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
