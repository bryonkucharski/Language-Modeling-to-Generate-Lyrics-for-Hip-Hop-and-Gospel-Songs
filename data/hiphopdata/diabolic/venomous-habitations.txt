Grinding out evil emotion 
 Murder is death envisioned in devotion 
 Criminal mind committed daily 
 Sentenced to their thoughts deadly 
 Death is all death can do 
 Final judgment I'll call through 
 Evil gives to the demise 
 The essence of a forgotten soul 
 The great dying, Loss of God 
 Dissipate, The evil grows 
 Through the destroyed world that ends 
 The efforts of unknowing fools 
 Bless the wretched herds of Christians 
 With a bath unholy water 
 Cleanse them all of unholy thoughts 
 Deprogram everything they're taught 
 Slave of God, Lost souls 
 Transform into blasphemy! 
 Once a begotten son 
 Only to question faith 
 Keep the soul forever 
 Burning down heaven's gates!
