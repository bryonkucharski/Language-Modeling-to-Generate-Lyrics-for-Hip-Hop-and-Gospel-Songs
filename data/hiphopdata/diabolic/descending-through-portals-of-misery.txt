(Hersemann) 
 Life was a journey, a search for the truth 
 Many years passed but nothing was new 
 Just random occurrences all of them trite 
 Then, on the way, I gave up the fight 
 Walking through quicksand is how it would feel 
 Sickened by people, their spirits revealed 
 Humanity's lost to me this is now known 
 I've drowned in the current of life's undertow... 
 Bouncing from one place and then the next 
 One more would follow and so goes the text 
 Depression would increase and so would the hate 
 Grip lost its hold, I fell towards my fate! 
 But on the way down, my mind's eye would see 
 No one could know what it meant to be me 
 Deep down I knew that no one would care 
 When they woke up one day and I wasn't there 
 Based on my thoughts I gathered my strength 
 Empowered myself with my freedom to think 
 Plotting and hatching my plans for revenge 
 All the while seeing society's end 
 Focusing energy into a singular goal 
 Using my misery to bolster my soul 
 Between the depths and ear-piercing highs 
 I found the clarity, and reached for the prize 
 The choices were many, the decisions were few 
 Many of options, but I knew what to do 
 Decide who and what were the cause of my plight 
 And make them discover the scope of my might. 
 Now thinking clearly; I moved ahead 
 Aside from my misery my emotions were dead 
 But soon during the process, my hate returned 
 It went from a smolder to a flesh-searing burn! 
 Now... 
 I know what must be done 
 Stalking and waiting 
 They'll all disappear one by one 
 Unexplained 
 My exploits will proceed unchained 
 Like a wraith 
 I'll pass through them I can steal their soul 
 Rotten corpse 
 Useless to me except to fill a hole 
 Many will grieve 
 Until they turn -- and -- see -- me!
