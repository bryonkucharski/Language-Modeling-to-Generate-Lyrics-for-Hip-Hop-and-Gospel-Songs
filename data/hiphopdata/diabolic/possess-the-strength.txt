We possess the strength 
 To conquer the vicious 
 Reverse the negative spiral 
 Adapt and attack! 
 Undaunted! 
 Unmoving! 
 We possess the power 
 To defend the ideals 
 Negate the unjust assault 
 Enemies obsolete! 
 We possess the knowledge 
 To surpass the weak 
 In defiance of cowardice 
 Pure thought ascends! 
 Undaunted! 
 Unmoving! 
 Unrelenting! 
 We stand strong! 
 Observe and evaluate! 
 Deploy the punishment! 
 Eye to eye 
 No mercy 
 We hold no fear! 
 Into the storm 
 We walk as one! 
 And to the end 
 You'll find torment! 
 Strength, power, knowledge 
 Our weapons remain! 
 (Lead: Brian) 
 (Lead: Jerry) 
 Possess the knowledge! 
 Possess the power! 
 Possess the strength!
