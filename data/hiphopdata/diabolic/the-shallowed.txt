Shallow life seemed to be scarred 
 Wasting away don't know who you are 
 Aimlessly leading your visions are blurred 
 Foolishly acting you seem so absurd! 
 The path is walked walking on glass 
 Barefoot through life blood will 
 Flow fast 
 No direction surrounded by lost 
 Being ignorant at any fucking cost 
 Talking your shit none that is true 
 Our gratification is going to haunt you 
 All's said and done and you're still where you are 
 Never to advance never to go far! 
 The shallowed! 
 Wrecking all you ever dreamed! 
 Relish the human decay! 
 Pathetic ways in a haze! 
 (Lead: Brian) 
 Smothered waste! 
 Breathless phase! 
 Shallow ways! 
 Lowest of lives! 
 Self deceivers! 
 Non-believers! 
 Herd mentality no original thought 
 Jealous mind venomous plot 
 Starting wars never to be fought 
 Can't break the bond 
 In your own web you're caught!
