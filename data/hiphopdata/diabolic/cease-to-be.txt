Cease to be at 3:33 
 Deprived of life the family 
 Demonic forces it's work put 
 Forth 
 Commit murder possessed to 
 Kill! 
 Terminate with lethal fate 
 Descend to a treacherous act 
 Dreadful slaughter 
 Abhorrent methods of demons 
 Dwells! 
 Unsuspecting prey 
 At the weakest point 
 The unseen coming 
 Evil takes it's course 
 Haunting them 
 Rejecting the blessing 
 Holy vomit 
 Priest with lies 
 Before his eyes 
 10,000 flies 
 Lord of maggots 
 Crucifix falls 
 Blood flows from the walls 
 From the bloody chamber 
 Purify with fire 
 Wicked winds blow 
 From powers down below 
 (Lead: Brian) 
 Unchristian behavior 
 Consequences will be reaped 
 Heard the voices 
 Bloodshed reigns 
 Dark clouds linger 
 Thunderous blasts 
 Powers and energy clash 
 Embrace the goat! 
 (Lead: Jerry) 
 Blasphemation of souls! 
 Crushing the mighty savior!
