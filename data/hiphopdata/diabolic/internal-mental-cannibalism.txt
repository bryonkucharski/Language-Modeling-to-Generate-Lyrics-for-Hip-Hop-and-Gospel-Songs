(Malone/Hersemann) 
 Two sides 
 Of the same coin 
 Hemispheres 
 Mental imagery 
 Disarray 
 Of the inner self 
 The "ID" has split 
 Causing sanity to melt 
 Trains of thought 
 Start to form 
 Unbeknownst 
 To the main persona 
 Leading to 
 Calamity 
 As the mind 
 Begins to consume itself! 
 Why? 
 Am I? 
 So cursed? 
 Inside? 
 Within 
 The form 
 Behind 
 My eyes 
 Exists 
 Too much 
 To 
 Survive 
 I must 
 Abide 
 The war 
 Of my 
 Selves. 
 As I exist here alone 
 I feel as though I'm not alone 
 Things around me are inside me 
 Making all my senses thrown 
 Beating fists within my brain 
 Swelling veins, am I insane? 
 Voices calling in all directions 
 Frequencies are ever-changing 
 Now the voices turn to shrieks 
 Drowning out benevolence 
 Rolls of skin beneath my nails 
 As I pull my flesh away 
 I must find out what is in me 
 And show the world that I'm sane 
 Until that time arises 
 I will make the world feel my pain.
