Masters to create 
 Gathering in the dwelling 
 Darken the imagination 
 Uniting of the minds 
 Forging forth we think alike 
 Absence of anything light 
 Blacken hearts we then begin 
 Ceremonies in the devil's den! 
 Burning desires! 
 Unholy sinful lives! 
 Practice the art of rage! 
 Fearless for maximum cause 
 Reckless we captivate 
 Blasphemous immaculate 
 Dominance at unrest! 
 Mindstorms and mania 
 Meditate to overpower 
 Vanquish sounds of the deep! 
 Assault on your sympathy 
 Disruptive human nature rage 
 Unrelent the only way 
 On a razor's edge 
 The flame we keep 
 Pronounce to devastate 
 Supremacy behold!
