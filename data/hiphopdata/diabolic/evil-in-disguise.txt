Evil! 
 A different breed of animal 
 Somewhere driven by death 
 Every breath is dead air 
 Leaving millions in despair 
 A gift that no one can believe 
 Seventy two virgins, their motive to kill 
 To spend eternity in bliss 
 All they gave was one last wish 
 Cunning and deceptive 
 They had a master plan 
 Years in the making 
 To kill as many as they can 
 Evil in disguise 
 Evil from the skies 
 Mission from the master 
 The end is coming faster 
 The hate will never stop 
 For those who avenge us 
 Mentality of carnage 
 Offered to their kind 
 Ancient hatred destroyed 
 Future hatred deployed 
 Ancient hatred destroyed 
 Future hatred deployed
