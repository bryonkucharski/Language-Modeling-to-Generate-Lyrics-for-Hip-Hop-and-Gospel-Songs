Ancient witchery an evil sorcerer 
 Supernatural powers brings life's death 
 The devil's cohort a chilling specter 
 She is a shadow that is out for blood 
 Beautiful deadly she's the night 
 Practices of black infanticide 
 Orgies of unearthly acts 
 Is the nightmare of the human mind 
 A goddess figure a divine force 
 Ritual incantations brought forth 
 Possess powers of divination 
 A mortal vision of the forbidden 
 Soars to nocturnal gatherings 
 Face to face with Satan's sister 
 Worship the ensemble of the witch 
 Lucifer appears to partake in lust 
 For those who condemn evil 
 They would torture to confession 
 Found guilty of witchcraft 
 Burn Witch 
 Burn Witch 
 Burn Witch 
 Burn to fucking Death!
