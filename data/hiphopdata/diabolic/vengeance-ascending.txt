In the beginning 
 We fought to find 
 Our rightful place 
 Destined to reign supreme! 
 With desperate visions 
 We fight until death 
 And banishment of cursed souls! 
 This battle for survival 
 In eternal war! 
 Ancestral blood of distant warriors 
 Flows through our veins 
 Ignite the white-hot flame 
 Desire burns, burns burns 
 Infinitely 
 Our blood boils with rage 
 Ignite the white-hot flame! 
 With desperate visions 
 We fight until death 
 And banishment of cursed souls! 
 This battle for survival 
 In eternal war! 
 Vengeance screams! 
 The ally of strength 
 We beckon the call 
 To accelerate the demise 
 Enemies bloodied and maimed 
 Bleed, bleed, bleed 
 With hatred we spit on your corpse! 
 No honor 
 Pathetic speck of vile existence 
 Despised even in death 
 Victorious we reign!
