(Hersemann/Malone) 
 All our futures once were foretold 
 First etched stone now carved flesh 
 Despite our frail human stock 
 We traverse the realms of death 
 With knowledge bestowed upon us 
 We proceed to forge our paths 
 Despite all the lies around us 
 We will dominate this quest! 
 Subconscious strength 
 Deep inside 
 Will not accept 
 Cannot abide! 
 Forever onward 
 Never relent 
 No forgiveness 
 No repent! 
 Defeated legions 
 Lie behind 
 Their corpses stuffed 
 With their leader's minds! 
 Holy symbols 
 Now ablaze 
 Like the congregation 
 Mindless slaves! 
 Overtaking the realms of ignorance 
 Force feeding the spirits of simple minds 
 Kicking and screaming the fools are dragged, 
 From -- the -- mines! 
 Our display, to show unending strength 
 Taught and reinforced since the birth of time 
 When will the maggots start to learn 
 We'll be here until the end of time! 
 Defeated legions 
 Lie behind 
 Their corpses stuffed 
 With their leader's minds! 
 Holy symbols 
 Now ablaze 
 Like the congregation 
 Mindless slaves! 
 With resilience, 
 The strength of steel 
 The attack proceeds 
 Through infinity! 
 Now our dominance has been displayed 
 Trampled underfoot the mindless slaves 
 Learn by example -- we stand as one 
 With this knowledge now our quest is done.
