Devastate 
 Evolution of our planet 
 When the age of man will be erased 
 From negliegence of distant past 
 Extinction Level Event! 
 Eradicate 
 Cast away the mass appeal 
 As burning rock falls from the sky 
 Scales of time weigh our fate 
 Prayers to heaven cannot save! 
 Dust and ash 
 Deadly rain 
 Land swallowed by tidal waves 
 Lifeless bodies 
 Drift out to sea 
 No atmosphere left to breath 
 Extinction Level Event! 
 Technology 
 Warnings of the coming days 
 Shelters built in mountains deep 
 Voyage from unknown regions 
 Ruthless violence nature brings! 
 Disaster 
 Panic stricken world 
 Destruction! 
 Massive graves 
 Eternal darkness reigns 
 Annihilation! 
 Omission 
 Of fallen mortals cease 
 Perpetual demise! 
 Barren plains 
 Universal cycle complete 
 Elimination of all humanity!
