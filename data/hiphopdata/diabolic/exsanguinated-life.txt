(Malone/Hersemann) 
 Bodies 
 Upon Bodies -- lifeless 
 Heaped in graves 
 Faces, 
 Reflecting -- soulless 
 Soon to be my slaves! 
 Throats split 
 Yawning gape 
 Digits twitch 
 Re-animate 
 Pushing through 
 Dirt and clay 
 Ever burn 
 Like an unholy blaze! 
 My purpose -- sorcery 
 Forbidden arts 
 Rites long which have been cursed 
 Daemonology -- a love of hate 
 Takes control 
 I enter an altered state! 
 Now my minds eye has been opened 
 Showing me my purpose is true 
 The elder ones have been awakened 
 The storm has broke the demons burst through! 
 Minions --Attack! 
 The harvest -- of death! 
 My army 
 Of demons -- swarm the earth 
 No quarter 
 Or mercy -- just rebirth 
 As golems -- programmed 
 For destruction 
 I rise -- the almighty 
 Enslaver-of-souls! 
 Exsanguinate 
 Exsanguinate 
 Exsanguinated 
 Life!
