Godless lifeless outcast 
 Alone in darkness I live 
 Stripped of all emotion 
 All I feel is nothingness 
 To live is a murder of thyself 
 Do you like to see death 
 Destroy the dreams of faces 
 Power of Satan in my hands 
 I am God I make demands 
 To die would be a blessing 
 Second from karma's fate 
 Outcome is evil hate 
 To end the lives of countless 
 A sorry existence lies ahead 
 For those who die first 
 It will cleanse my thirst 
 Fulfill my need to kill 
 From a deviant demon 
 The conquest has been won 
 The time has come to count the dead 
 For those who don't belong 
 From all the pain inflicted 
 Now it's time to die 
 Never know the reason why 
 Made their lives a living hell 
 They will never be the same 
 From my twisted killing game 
 As I descend deeper 
 Kill myself to the keeper 
 Satan!
