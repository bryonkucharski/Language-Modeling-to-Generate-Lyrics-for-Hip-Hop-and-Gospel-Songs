(Malone/Hersemann) 
 Saturated with blood 
 Battlefields multiply -- covering the earth 
 Urged on from beings below 
 At one with the purpose -- rebirth through extinction 
 Singular in need 
 Steamrolling the majority -- rejoice in perversity 
 The strike will never cease 
 Domination, termination, shattered skulls beneath marching feet. 
 Feeble opposition 
 Unspeakable mutilation they endure 
 Their pain only supplements 
 The collective hate held by this regime 
 Mentally unfit 
 To be able to comprehend enlightened thought 
 Masters will be slaves 
 As downtrodden souls unify as one. 
 Awake! 
 Both weak and the strong. 
 Unite! 
 We'll form devil throngs 
 Brought together by the steel 
 That's ruled all along! 
 All our lives you've waited for this call 
 Now scream havoc and unleash your dogs of war! 
 Storming satanic barbarians 
 Take all that we deserve!
