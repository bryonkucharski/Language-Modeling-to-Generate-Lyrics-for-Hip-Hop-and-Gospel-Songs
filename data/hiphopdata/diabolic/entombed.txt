Make your decision to die 
 No other choice, you soon will lie 
 Burnt, charred, excruciating pain 
 Flesh burned to the bone 
 By the relentless flames 
 Beyond recognition 
 Without a name 
 Is how they find you 
 If your body remains 
 Pile of embers could only be 
 Incinerated to ashes and cremated 
 Descend into your tomb 
 Imminent doom 
 Burnt, mutilated, crushed 
 Now you are entombed! 
 Last chance to decide 
 One way or another you will die 
 Declined the thought to fry 
 Now it's time to fly 
 Twenty seconds to death 
 You made up your mind 
 Your life flashes in front of you 
 Now you know what to do 
 Splattered on the ground 
 It makes a horrible sound 
 End up a lump of meat 
 Closed casket, no one will see 
 There's no way out 
 Trying to escape 
 Time is running out 
 Now you meet your fate
