Heaven's such a vicious lie 
 Only Satan's word can I rely 
 Even when I question fuckin' honor 
 Turn my back in disgrace 
 Ask and you shall receive your gift 
 Devotion to evil must believe this 
 All the pleasures of this world 
 Must be hailed from within 
 Soul is gone for eternal faith 
 Prayed to God seems such a waste 
 Rituals have always prevailed 
 Given lust beyond this world 
 Sent a demon from his horde 
 His only aim is just destroy 
 Everything built that stands 
 Torn down, all that's left is man 
 Dedicate the being of foreseeing 
 The future brings death to the deceiving 
 The unholy truth survives 
 In the blackened eyes 
 Weaken to the power, only to die 
 Offered in the face of God 
 False belief, false belief
