Walk! 
 Left hand path to life of success 
 And ambition! 
 Live! 
 Indulge pleasures, selfism reigns 
 Pride without guilt! 
 Supreme form of evil! 
 Perspective of clarity! 
 Embrace the seven sins! 
 The paths to pleasure! 
 Society of the elite! 
 Philosophy of the strong! 
 Hail! 
 The accuser adversary 
 Symbolic one! 
 Heed! 
 Rules of the earth, natural thought 
 Instinctual ways! 
 Archangel of Satan! 
 Laveyan sect of wisdom! 
 Advance into the higher realms of 
 Thought!

 In the name of Satan 
 We assail the holy rites 
 Break the chains of mental slavery 
 Surrounding magic succeeds! 
 With the strength of belial 
 Gather forces under black 
 Standard of satanic might 
 March forth to victory! 
 By the flames of lucifer 
 We enlighten stagnant minds 
 Crumble walls of falsehood 
 Foolish fears your demise! 
 From the depths of leviathan 
 Boldness obtains our desires 
 Instilled instincts undenied 
 Immortal souls eternal rise! 
 Rise! 
 Majestic satanic! 
 Rise!
