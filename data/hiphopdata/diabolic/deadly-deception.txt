Obliterate christian mentality 
 Torture and salughter maliciously 
 They only wish it was a dream 
 Leaving their souls in agony 
 Reverent life living despair 
 Lying god compelled 
 Deceptive belief unanswered prayers 
 Deadly belief the fools ensnared! 
 Crucified condemned to die 
 Behold the hatred in the eye 
 Slowly lashing beating down 
 Hang Christ up and bear crown 
 Opposing preachers blessed faith 
 Converts of our vicious sect 
 Balance in the behalf 
 The world's cosmic battle! 
 Obliterate christian mentality 
 Torture and salughter maliciously 
 They realize it's not a dream 
 We left their souls in agony 
 Reverent life living despair 
 Lying God repelled 
 Deceptive belief unanswered prayers 
 Deadly belief the cross they bear! 
 Crucified condemned to die 
 Behold the hatred in the eye 
 Slowly lashing beating down 
 Hang Christ up and bear our crown 
 Opposing preachers blessed faith 
 Converts of our vicious sect 
 Balance in the behalf 
 Deadly deception!
