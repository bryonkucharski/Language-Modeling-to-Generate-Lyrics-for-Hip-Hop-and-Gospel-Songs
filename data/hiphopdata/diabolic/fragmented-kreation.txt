Evil from an inborn birth 
 A monster lives inside 
 An angel on exterior 
 A demon dwells alive 
 Subjected to the darkness 
 Propaganda glorified 
 Became a part of the dark world 
 Young at heart, evil then starts! 
 Behind the darkened eyes 
 No rhyme or reason 
 Influenced by religion 
 A wrath of devastation 
 Satan gives, Satan takes 
 To pull in all that he hates 
 To unleash upon the weak
