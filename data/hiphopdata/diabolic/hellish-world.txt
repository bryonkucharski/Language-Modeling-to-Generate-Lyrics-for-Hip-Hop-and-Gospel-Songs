The will to survive is strong 
 Look inside thy inner self 
 Integrity that drives persistence 
 Constant strive dwells inside 
 Comfort zone, state to be alone 
 Deep strength unheard of 
 Harden feelings to be numbed 
 Emotions gone, hard as stone 
 To live on the dark side of the law 
 Lawless is the path of thy self 
 Flying free with dark wings I soar 
 The dark lord will conquer all! 
 No one knows the hell I live 
 One day Satan will soon give 
 All the pleasures of this world 
 Matter of time, have my rewards 
 Staying true to the beliefs of 
 The motivation to stay alive 
 Death would be solution to some 
 Desecrate the criminal fools! 
 To live on the dark side of the law 
 Lawless is the path of thy self 
 Flying free with dark wings I soar 
 The dark lord will conquer all! 
 Crutch for God need not have 
 I am God in my broken land 
 Believe in myself to crush all 
 Stand as one, I will not befall 
 Sheer fear of unruly law 
 Respect to the powers of us all 
 Without force war can rise 
 Violent streets can kill 
 Ganglands are taken over 
 Don't feel pity, out to kill 
 No remorse for the death 
 Kill all in the way 
 Terrorize, intimidate the weak 
 Uprise will survivors seek 
 Dark years, the sun is shadowed 
 Despair, misery of all 
 Decimate is the calling of sin 
 Committed to Demonic Evil 
 Evil... Evil... EVIL!
