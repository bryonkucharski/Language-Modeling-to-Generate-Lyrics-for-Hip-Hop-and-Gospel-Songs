Marked for banishment 
 Condemned in the eye 
 Inhabit bad karma 
 Deport desensitized! 
 Do unto thy enemies 
 As they have done to you 
 Put them on a hit list 
 Curse them with illness 
 Promise doom and destruction 
 Their fate will do the rest 
 Burning candles rituals done 
 Their end has just begun! 
 They tried to hold us back 
 Now we siege the assailant 
 The battle they cannot secure 
 Our triumph over obstacles 
 The greatest men are alone 
 Without suffering there's no wisdom 
 Ravage the night terror 
 Marked by the master! 
 Marked for banishment! 
 (Lead: Brian) 
 (Lead: Jerry) 
 Righteous ones! 
 Victorious! 
 Overall! 
 Triumphant!
