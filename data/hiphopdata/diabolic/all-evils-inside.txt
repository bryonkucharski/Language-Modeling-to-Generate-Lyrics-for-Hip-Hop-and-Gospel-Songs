There's a void you can go 
 A region you don't know 
 Shadows waiting to please you 
 With pleasures and evil 
 You can perceive what you need 
 But be rigorous of greed 
 It's dangerous, unwilling 
 Some find it fulfilling 
 Abyss of depravity! 
 Don't go to the hole 
 The darkest of holes 
 You just might not know 
 What Ill harm is lurking 
 Because you are flirting 
 With menace unknown 
 You could come to your death 
 Shot blast to your head 
 Left for dead 
 Stripped of your life 
 The demons entice 
 Just may be sliced 
 If you get out alive 
 You played with your life 
 Until the next time 
 All evils inside!

 Abyss of depravity!
