Born in the heart of darkness 
 The Incubus of life and death 
 Divination and enchantments 
 Gateway to Sorcery 
 Rebellion against God 
 Rejection of Jesus Christ 
 Testament of Necromancy 
 Dabble in the world of fleshcraft! 
 Conjurier is the voodooistic 
 Deepen oath in vain 
 Brillance of the bewitched 
 Fateful to the pitiful 
 Impurity needs the flesh 
 Infested by the swarm 
 More than just a deity 
 Consecration of our bliss 
 Mystic charm of shaman 
 Enchanting in the ghost dance! 
 Fleshcraft! 
 Succubus transformed 
 By the unbaptized 
 Hawthorn uneffective 
 Figments of imagination 
 Calling upon the entities 
 Materialized through powers 
 Practitioners of magic 
 Intrusion of evil! 
 Apostacy constituted 
 Worship of the christian devil 
 Presence of angelic forces 
 Feelings of magnetic charm 
 Thirst for fascination 
 Surface incarnation 
 The moment has arisen 
 Adverse effect possession!
