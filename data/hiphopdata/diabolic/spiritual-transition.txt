(Hersemann/Malone) 
 Spiraling reality consumes itself 
 Pushing in directions once ignored 
 Knowing nothing until death is dealt 
 Then you will rely on what was stored... 
 Your spirit now unshackled from its shell 
 Now free to observe that which was lost 
 More new knowledge than you can retain 
 Rewards in all this far beyond the cost... 
 Glide... 
 Glide upon wings of death 
 Soar... 
 To heights unwitnessed by mortal man 
 Hear... 
 The lamentations of unrested souls 
 Smell... 
 The sulphorous smoke that follows you into death 
 Alight... 
 And view the planes of the underworld! 
 Now you have seen the hereafter 
 Burned out eyes just empty orbs 
 Endless searching for something not there 
 Just wandering on Styx's shores 
 Lifelong quest for your enlightenment 
 Now your spirit has its due 
 Bleeding blisters cover your feet 
 Now your search for God is through.
