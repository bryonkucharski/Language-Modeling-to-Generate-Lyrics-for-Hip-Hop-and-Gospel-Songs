Jaws of death hammering down 
 Killing is the way I live 
 Seriously taking life regrets 
 Doing Satan's will at best 
 Fuck God 
 Fuck Christ 
 Hoathe Satani! 
 The slaughters have not been found 
 Until they find the dead I killed 
 I defeat God and make my own 
 Spend eternity in hell 
 Prepare for the great battle 
 Watch his weak children die 
 To serve in heaven no longer 
 Leaving victims for dead 
 One crushed with deadly force 
 One beaten with blunt trauma 
 One hung, gutted from within 
 Deserve to die for their ways 
 Don't need to live another day 
 Once gone forever forgotten 
 Left for dead begin to rotten 
 He came back to have his way 
 Life or death a trade with evil 
 On a path of destruction 
 Innocent people gone forever 
 Met a mad man out for pleasure
