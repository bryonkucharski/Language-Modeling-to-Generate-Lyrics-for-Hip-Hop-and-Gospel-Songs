(Hersemann/Malone) 
 Perpetual 
 Limitless 
 Unending 
 Infinite 
 Everlasting 
 Never-stopping 
 Forever! 
 Procession of the Soulgrinders! 
 Left unchecked 
 Collective thought 
 Led to guilt 
 No-self-will 
 Humanity's 
 Weakest links 
 Sympathy 
 And cognizance! 
 Unexplained 
 What causes a human to feel insane? 
 Influence surrounds 
 Yet all directions lead to pain 
 Mass hypnosis 
 Ceaseless scourge of rational thought 
 Unblinking idols 
 Gazing blankly at battles fought 
 The soulgrinders proceed!
