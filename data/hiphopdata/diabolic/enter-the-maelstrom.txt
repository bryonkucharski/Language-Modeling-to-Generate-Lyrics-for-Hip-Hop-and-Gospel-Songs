(Malone) 
 Pulled away from life and 
 Thrust into 
 A world without a God 
 No longer sheltered by 
 The confines of the mainstream world 
 Confidence wanes and is replaced with uncertainty 
 Surrounded by the sights, the sounds and grim foreboding creeds 
 Something in you urges on 
 Demands that you proceed 
 Is this what you wanted? 
 Or do you turn and flee?! 
 How and why could this 
 Gathering of humanity 
 Co-exist and thrive 
 Amongst the huddled sheep 
 The wolves are gathered here 
 And have no shame for their deeds 
 It would seem their time has come 
 To rule eternally! 
 Enter the maelstrom 
 You're fated for battery 
 Relentless pursuit of satanic reality 
 Caught in the vortex of 
 Endless brutality 
 Embracing the traits of life's abnormality 
 Spinning and whirling 
 Your life flies in front of you 
 Adrenaline pumping 
 Blood boiling inside of you 
 Eyes turning red 
 Seeing another view 
 Open the gates 
 This is inside of you 
 Feeling the power 
 Of united mentality 
 Ultimate strength 
 In numbers and family 
 Using our minds 
 To subvert negativity 
 Together as one 
 We grind towards infinity 
 Join us and increase 
 Your mental capacity 
 Diabolical visions 
 And dark surreality 
 Enhancing your spirit 
 And growing maturity 
 Open your eyes achieve your true destiny!
