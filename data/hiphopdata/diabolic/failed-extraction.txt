Falter 
 Removal of a possessed soul 
 The body denies injections of your filth 
 Time surpass 
 Universal life force 
 Inevitable judgement has been revoken 
 Deceptive covering 
 Altered visions of the pure 
 Holy disgrace 
 Offended by the church of God 
 Trickery 
 Fool the weak minds of the flock! 
 Immoral unworthy of the cross you bear! 
 Sinless water useless to iniquity 
 Vain attempt to read the final word! 
 Failed extraction 
 Sercomes the angelic decline 
 Evil is the devourment 
 Transparent to the hidden eye 
 Strenghtless to the deed 
 Betraval that is feeble 
 Witness to the bible burning 
 Master of a dismal faded essence 
 Witness to your crucifix melting 
 Servant of God will be the one exorcised!
