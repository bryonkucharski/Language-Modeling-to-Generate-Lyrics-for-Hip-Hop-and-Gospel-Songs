L attention in the world today 
 All the little girls fillin up the world today 
 When good comes to bad the bad comes to good 
 But I'm gonna live a life like I should 
 Now all the critics wanna hit it 
 Shit can ever did it 
 Because they don't get 
 But I'll stay fitted 
 Knew there committed 
 Unless this red cap 
 Gets a bad rap from his critics 
 Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry) 
 Do we always gotta be inside a lie (a lie) 
 Life is just a blast 
 Movin very fast 
 Better stay on top 
 Or life will kick you in the ass 
 Follow me into a solo 
 Remember that, kid 
 So what you wanna do? 
 The way you wanna run 
 When your starin' down a cable 
 Of a mic put it that you grill like a gun 
 Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set 
 It's like Russian Roulette 
 When your placin' your bet 
 So don't be upset 
 When your broke 
 And your done 
 'Cause I'm gonna be the one 
 Till I jet 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 Now I know why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Now you wanna hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Now you wanna hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Does anybody really know the secret 
 And the combination for this life and where they keep it 
 Its kinda sad when you don't know the meaning 
 But everything happens for a reason 
 I don't even know what I should say 
 I'm an idiot a loser and a phone abuser 
 I analyze every second I exist 
 Beaten on my mind every second with my fist 
 Everybody wanna run (run) 
 Everybody wanna hide from the gun (gun) 
 You can take that ride through this life if you want 
 You can't take that edge off that knife (no sir) 
 And now you want your money back (money back) 
 But your denied 'cause your brains fried from the sac 
 And there ain't nothing I can do 
 'Cause life is a lesson you'll learn it when your through 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 I know why you want to hate me 
 Now I know why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Why you want to hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 Now you wanna hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 (Now I know why... Now I know why... Now I know why) 
 Now I know why you wanna hate me 
 Now I know why you wanna hate me 
 Now I know why you wanna hate me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me 
 'Cause hate is all the world that's even seen me
