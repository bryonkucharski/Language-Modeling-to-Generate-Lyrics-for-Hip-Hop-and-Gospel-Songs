How it goes in this gutta, how it goes in this gutta 
 It can all end while ya tryin' to getcha butta 
 How it goes in this gutta, how it goes in this gutta 
 It can all end while ya tryin' to getcha butta 
 How it goes in this gutta, how it goes in this gutta 
 It can all end while ya tryin' to getcha butta 
 How it goes in this gutta, how it goes in this gutta 
 It can all end while ya tryin' to getcha butta 
 So this is how it ends? Hype standin' o-ver my carcass 
 Snatchin' up my dope, runnin' off, in-to the darkness 
 Hyde Park, niggaz, Hollywood, killin' for war just 
 Dope bein' sold, out the back, do' of them porches 
 Told my lil nigga leave the paint, off of the Caddy 
 Carjacked and killed, his lil' girl, left wit' no daddy 
 Ten years later daddy's death, still ??? 
 The saw was bein' drought, momentarily buy marijuana 
 Rock, after rock is bein' slung, daughters are hungry 
 Mama's debit card is zero, I got the moment 
 Trappin' in this trap, coldhearted guns that'll kill ya 
 Smith and Wessun hollow tips, mayne that'll drill ya 
 Standin' in the door-way, hand on the throw-way 
 Some niggaz ride by, I spy, lookin' my way 
 Shady looks don't make sense, so I got on de-fense 
 Mossberg cocked mayne turn yo' flesh to meat mince 
 Poppin' off, at the first sign of some static 
 Gotta keep it safe for the dope, and the addicts 
 We swangin' these boat loads, dodgin' the po'-po's 
 Duckin' time on this crime, mission out a boat load 
 Don't know, if we have to blast or get blasted 
 K bullet blow ya skull off, it was drastic 
 You niggaz don't, really want beef, you can sang it 
 The real question is cow-ard, will ya brang it? 
 (Music to fade)
