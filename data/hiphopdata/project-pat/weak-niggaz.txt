 I grab my swatter I swat this bug, he laid to rest 
 Fuckin' wit T-R-I-P-L, E-S-I-X 
 Niggaz be talkin' but in the end I like fuck 'em up 
 In the beginnin' they could've survived but they had no nuts 
 Bitch where you graduated from, I said a school of hoe-in' 
 'Cause in yo face, off in the streets ain't nothin' but hoe is showin' 
 Too fuckin' light, too fuckin' light to try to fight 
 Stick you with knives, shoot you with - nines and take yo life 
 Yeah we know you niggaz are fuckin' scared 'cause we don't play around 
 Never wanna step 'cause Three 6 Mafia put you in the ground 
 People say you buck but we all know that's just that liquor bro 
 Niggaz swear you hype but all that hyper is from hittin' that snow 
 If a member call me then I'm gonna pack my yawks and roll 
 Ride down on yo block and close up shop and leave yo body cold 
 Foo this ain't no game so tuck ya chain and coward hide yo grill 
 High cappin' and dissin' in yo rappin' just might get ya killed 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
 You got no ends, now you got no friends 
 Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
 You got no ends, now you got no friends 
 Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 
 Whachu doin' round hea? My nigga I gotta get ya 
 Fresh outta jail-ie, my mind on bailin', so I split ya 
 Head to the meet-ie, give to the needy so fuck the rest 
 No understandin', Projects the greedy, ya could be next 
 I'm robbin' victims with of the face of a? 
 No hesitatin', I come out buckin' so watch the nine 
 Off in East Memphis transactin' bizness I know you straight 
 I'm buckin' you fakers who ain't got cheese, the ones I hate 
 Could it be me, could it be somethin' in the fuckin' air 
 I'm seein' niggaz, them niggaz bodies flyin' everywhere 
 You wanna know if the Lord is mackin' or a fuckin' player 
 I'm keepin' all of you muthafuckas in my fuckin' prayers 
 Everywhere that I go I'm gettin' all these evil stares 
 I'm sick of all of these hatin' muthafuckas in my hair 
 All in my bizness, God is my witness I don't even care 
 Cause all you bitches you get the *blaah* died hell yeah 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
 You got no ends, now you got no friends 
 Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
 You got no ends, now you got no friends 
 Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 
 Deep deep in them trenches of Memphis where I'm seriously pimpin' 
 Da Koopsta da Knicca breakin' mo bitches than London got bridges 
 Send this to you niggas so you besta listen well 
 Touch me and you'll die see you can burn wit me in hell 
 This hi-zo gi-zo-zy iz-I for you niggas that've lost it 
 Spl-izat yi-zo iz-ass, will?off it

 Witness this wicked bit whipped up outta the Six riders 
 My nigga CB he be back out here on these bricks again 
 He kickin' in doors, he lookin' for him some dividends 
 He kidnappin' hoes so he can make him some money mane 
 And fuckin' wit him is like fuckin' wit somethin' different 
 Ya gotta be tough, nigga ya gotta be rough 
 Like ash to ash nigga, and dust to dust 
 In gats we trust nigga, it really ain't much nigga 
 'Cause talkin' to us nigga, we blowin' ya up 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
 You got no ends, now you got no friends 
 Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 
 They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
 Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
