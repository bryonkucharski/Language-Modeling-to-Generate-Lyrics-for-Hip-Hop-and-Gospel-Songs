Yeah, you muthafuckin' hoes 
 Y'all know the muthafuckin' dead Hypnotize Camp 
 And Profit Posse in this muthafucka 
 Get one of these gold plaques on the wall 
 Before you talk some old muthafuckin' shit 
 Bitch, it's whatever nigga, we in this muthafucka 
 For the 9-9, 9's to your head ho 
 (Mafia, mafia, mafi-ya, ya, mafia, mafia, mafi-ya, ya) 
 Glock 9's, Tech 9's, any kinda gun bitch 
 Evergreen gats have got these cowards on the run bitch 
 Kill 'em like they convicts 
 Know they hear them guns click 
 Doped up like a muthafucka 
 (Cough, cough, snort) 
 You could catch me in the same hood, on the fuckin' same block 
 With a pearl Rolex watch and a knot, and a glock 
 9 o'clock clock nigga like to slang 'cause I be hustlin' weight 
 And we gon' put a end to you hoes and you niggaz hatin' 
 I'ma be every fuckin' piece of skrilla cheese out here I can make 
 I'ma break every fuckin' bitch, fatalities that I can bring 
 I'ma millie my pillie but killie, killin' everything that I wanna kill 
 You weak ass niggaz don't want Lord Infamous 
 From South Parkway to get ill 
 Long from the norm, we get dumb with a bomb 
 With the guns you bitches y'all best get steel 
 Scarecrow, Club House, yes it gets ill 
 So, all y'all listen closely don't you ever forget 
 Y'all wouldn't, y'all never be shit without us bitch, don't forget 
 Killin' ain't shit, bitches ain't shit 
 Niggaz ain't shit, bodies in a ditch 
 How any niggaz gonna talk dat shit 
 About da Cruchy fuckin' Black, Thug Posse ya bitch 
 Niggaz gon' talk, bitches gon' start 
 Muthafuckaz gonna get they bodies in a trunk 
 All I want is cash muthafuckaz have 
 Get down on your knees, gimme all your cash 
 Whoa, muthafucka watch yourself, just watch your back 
 'Cause still we chillin' with Pat, straped with them gats 
 Be ready to attack, all you hatin' ass niggaz 
 That wanna jump, yo punk what's up 
 You better come up real with your muthatfuckin' shit 
 'Cause boy, it's gonna get rough 
 Situation's gone bad for you niggaz claimin' killaz 
 Automatic triggaz pullin', drillin' holes inside your liver 
 How you figure, I was gon' let you talk that shit 
 And peep these streets sayin', "That ScanMan boy's a bitch" 
 Know watch them throw lights out in my head 
 Killin', buckin', buckin' up in gunfire 
 Bullets rickin' off the walls, nigga this is warfare 
 Suckaz claimin' they got nuts 
 You don't know these elephants 
 Specialize in takin' notes, specialize in nappy hoes 
 Niggaz this is serious, I can't play no games no more 
 Niggaz actin' curious but I think they know the score 
 Bitches know the Hypnotize medallion show what click you claim 
 Hold it up strong, only those, who stay real, or maintain' in this game 
 Alot of niggaz talk that shit and end up gettin' the wig split 
 It's MC Mack, the nigga known for smackin', jackin', Cracker Jacks 
 Busta ass nigga, run you mouth and get your ass blowed off 
 Watch me put my ski mask on 
 Come a gat back now trick now drop it off 
 Shoot a super soaker in a minute 
 Don't you give a fuck about another nigga 
 If he's speakin' use your counter attack 
 Rollin' like a nigga smack a nigga like a nigga 
 Smack a bitch, you crump, you ain't no busta 
 Ain't no love lost off in my heart, there's no place colder 
 Won't you come a little closer nigga, you won't be rollin' our 
 Socialists up actin' miss servin' sevens 
 Have 'em in jail suspended, in the middle 
 Started rivalries civil, homies swithin', actin' fickle 
 But if you fuck with family ties, we leave you triple 
 That nigga there know his gun a missile 
 Lord don't flash on him, only man ain't chival 
 Erasin' ample businesses all in the name of the T-Rock 
 Suckaz eat pot, swallow D, and get punished for three rocks 
 Bangin' the hit stops, it won't be over, till your heat pops 
 Away from the gravity, stand and point you're a tech and see him drop 
 Yeah, I know, I know, down, down, baby goin' down, down 
 Sweet dreams baby, rock-a-bye, baby 
 Niggaz wanna run up, we be flexin' the Tech 
 And be pointed at ya we comin', and I bitch, I bet ya, I bet ya 
 You wanna hit 'em but nigga you an't forget 'em, forget 'em 
 Because you sorry and sorry ain't nothin' but venom 
 I know bitches out there lovin' me, niggaz got dreams of fuckin' me 
 Fuckin' me ain't the story gon' fuck you up more than me 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever, whatever ho 
 It's whatever, whatever ho, whatever 
 A lot of gunfire, bustin' on you hoes to get my point across 
 Ridin' in your hood and let the muthafuckin' bullets toss 
 Tossin' me a berries pack, now I'm tossin' you some dramma 
 Ridin' with my congregation and we smokin' on marijuana 
 If you wanna go to war with us, we prepared to bust 
 Caught that niggaz slippin' at his place, shot him in his face 
 Now I race, from the scenery, blowin' on greenery 
 Know I got a temper but you tricks wanna be mean to me 
 It's the weak, told to tell 'em, Julius Caesar, how he rolls 
 Newspaper, told to tell 'em, how he just got lnocked of his toes 
 You should know, that we rollin' deep, hittin' like a train 
 Kiss the floor, don't be lookin' dumb 'cause I don't explain 
 I maintain, killaz catchin' drinks, Project cathin' cappers 
 Shootin' at your muthafuckin' lane, they be catching vapors 
 Playa Haters, violaters, bullshiters, this for y'all 
 Boy I keep a big gun, you don't want none
