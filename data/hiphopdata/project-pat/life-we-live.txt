 I was broke pocket full of lint now I'm on the bricks 
 Getting paid like no other dog now I'm stackin' chips 
 On the road like a trucker man had to take some trips 
 Doing shows for my brothers but strapped with extra clicks 
 Just in case any sucker would wanna run his lips 
 A female I don't trust her cause women like to trip 
 I stay all by my getty green hell with some time 
 There some crime that was petty seem still getting mine 
 All this hate trip I'm hearing though you I ain't fearing 
 Better try to be growing old man with your children 
 Escalate what a nigga staring his last days nearing 
 Trying to get it right with god only one who I'm fearing 
 Hopin' I'ma make it keep it real 
 Never knew I get the chances for a nigga to get paid 
 So I take it living like a player should 
 Wishin' that you could knowin' it's all to the good 
 Still down with the hood 
 (Chorus: repeat) 
 This Life We Live (Life as we see it) 
 See it's oh so beautiful (Oh it's so) beautiful 
 Oh so beautiful (Oh it's so beautiful)

 Last year my cousin took a fall, a sad song 
 Seem like we were just on the phone now he gone 
 People use to try to judge him sayin' he was wrong 
 But you can't try to judge a man you do you wrong 
 Smokin' out on a daily base I'm in the clouds 
 Drinkin' liqour fallin' on my face 
 Wondering how I survive all this foolishness 
 Up in the street ridin' dirty I ain't new to this 
 I'm packin' heat but the streets very hazardous 
 To a niggaz health watch your step you ain't Lazarus 
 You'll meet your death 
 I'm the man from the North, North site of the town 
 With the will to support me and keep 'em found 
 Stayin' down got your gold grills dro in the air 
 Barbecue on the grill sun cool for a player 
 When I ride through the streets hoes are plentiful 
 Cause the life that we live so beau-ti-ful 
 (Project Pat) 
 Gotta take the good with the bad 
 Smile with the sad, love what you got 
 And remember what you had messin' with the ones 
 Who help me in the times 
 When I was flat broke didn't even have a dime 
 My family they was there, my niggaz they was there 
 The rest of y'all left me for dead didn't care 
 I use to have dreams livin' large in this thang 
 And by the grace of god I'm still alive in this thang 
 I strive in this game to get all that I can 
 Never said I'm the man, respect me as a man 
 To you ones think I owe you somethin' 
 Now that's a joke think you bad come and get you somethin' 
 How low to dope 
 Either treal either fake 
 You can love you can hate 
 Either go and get your own or you can't sit and wait 
 On the next man to come up you can peep this 
 You can do what I do handle your bu-si-ness
