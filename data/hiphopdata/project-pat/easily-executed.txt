Easily Executed X4 
 Cracking niggas jaws, running hoes into walls 
 Punks begging for they lives, mothafucka I don't pause 
 When I blast on yo ass I'm gone empty this clip 
 Nigga live by yo rep, but I ain't taking shit 
 When I slip in my disguise, letting you know what I'm about 
 And I'm blasting at the dark, that's gon blow yo brains out 
 Of yo head, leave you dead, in a pool of yo blood 
 Niggas died, niggas scared, cause, I don't show no love 
 Ain't no fear, when I hear, that the police got a witness 
 Now they looking for a suspect in North Memphis 
 Whose this realistic killa wit no conscience 
 Full of that alcohol, never smoking blunt junts 
 Get the pump, known as the seven shot scatter gun 
 Splatter some suckas head open, then I break and run 
 To the car, parked round the other corner of the street 
 Hit the gas fast, dog a nigga gotta beat the heat 
 Fuckin' wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe 
 When I come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe X2 
 Easily Executed X8 
 Bow down and recognize, nigga it's a homicide 
 Fuckin' wit the nigga like the pastor, that's a suicide 
 Mission that yo ass on, besta pack a chrome tome 
 Suckas play that role, like they killas bring it on jones 
 Roaming in ya neighborhood, and I got my sawed-off 
 Caught cha getting yo shit, I got my junt and blew yo ass off 
 Fool, I'm fo real black, caps I'm gon peal back 
 Not that psychopathic crazy nigga, but I'll snap 
 You in half wit my bare hands, trick this ain't no candy land 
 Hoe this ain't no game, they gon find you in a trash can 
 Down-town fulla flys, blood drippin from yo eyes 
 ?Dig? a hoes body for days, and they can't decide 
 Who did it, who done it, police on that okey-doke 
 Say it's drug related 'cause I did like them white folks do 
 Late at night, wit no witnesses around bro 
 Letting yo ass know, if you step, you can die hoe 
 Fuckin' wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe 
 When I come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe X2 
 Fuckin' wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe 
 When I (When I) come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe X2
