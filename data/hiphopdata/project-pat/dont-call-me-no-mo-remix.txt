 Get up out of my ride, I forgot you aw forget ya 
 Let the chevy door hit ya where the good Lord split ya 
 I ain't with that instant messagin', callin' and textin' 
 Saw me on them 30s downtown, Hummer flexin' 
 These broads that be beggin', ice around my neck and 
 A hood nigga hustlin' gonna get my respectin' 
 There ain't no acceptin yo calls, so ya see your daddy 
 Yo moms, yo aunt, greasy greasy grand mammy 
 Like a Johnny Cochran team to try to plead your case, 
 Heard ya in the background hung up in they face

 And you knowin' that we through, need some wood in yo life? 
 Don't be booty callin' me, you can keep yo legs closed 
 Neva get this thang again, fo yo coochie'll throw 
 Used to be a glamour queen 'cause I kept you with some money 
 I done cut yo water off, now you like a dust bunny 
 Hoody Hoody hood rat, nuck yo booty real fat 
 I'm in love with a stripper, let me hit it from the back 
 Like this girl Lil' Red, stood me up on some head 
 She come callin' me now, found out I got that bread 
 Little girls that be scared, go to church and hit the door 
 Don't call me no mo' and don't text... me (Wind Down)
