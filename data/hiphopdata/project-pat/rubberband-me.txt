 Rubberbands on my wrist 'cause it's stacks on deck, 
 Robbers get a death wish, 40 cal to the neck, 
 50 geeze on the wrist, I'm a get my respect, 
 I heard you talkin' with a lisp, wants to holla seat check, 
 Goochie shoes on my feet, goochie looking just to cure, 
 Ridin' 30's on the hummer, 07 is the year, 
 Smokin' purple marijuana, sippin purp in the cup, 
 Ghetto nigga with some money, buy the bar nigga what? 
 Ain't no slack in my mack, cause there's cheese to be gotten, 
 All this candy on the chevy makes a haterz eyes run, 
 20 geeze in my pocket, spend it all at the mall, 
 Girl flaggin me down an egyptian lookin' broad

 Peanut butter recuss, with an orange paint job, 
 Strip a club flash money like I bought a bank job, 
 Diamonds flyin from the bezzle see the rolex watch 
 Desert E runnin' chambers so a nigga can't rob 
 24's on the chevy they be ooh that nigga clean girl 
 Itbezzle jeans white tee mane that nigga clean girl 
 We trapped with the cane came from Texas the valley 
 Smokin' good bubble cush call me straight outta Cali 
 Chain got so much ice mane you can call me frosty 
 They shine like my 24's you can call me flossin 
 For checkin' size guns got me hositle, 
 You ain't Tom Cruise cause your mission is impossible
