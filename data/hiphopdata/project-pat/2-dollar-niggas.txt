 On a punk trick, knowin' good and well he counterfeit 
 All you do is talk out'cha mouth, you don't never do 
 Nothin' that you say out'cha cap, it ain't never true 
 Bury you, quicker than a *** who done told somethin' 
 Seen you in the club, beat you down like you owe somethin'

 One day you wearin' red and then it's blue the next 
 2 dollar *** be the main ones flippin' sets 
 You say you grippin' techs, regulatin' wit' the torch 
 Was 25 and you decided to jump off the porch 
 If he get caught, mouth run hot like broke radiator 
 Tell about the spots and the plots and the perpetrators 
 You treat the cops, like ya pops 'cause ya runnin' to 'em 
 I'm non-stop wit' that glock, put that gun into him 
 These older *** put these youngsters on a bloody stage 
 That's why these young *** get killed at an early age 
 Sent on a dummy mission from a dummy in a cage 
 2 dollar leadership will put you in a early grave
