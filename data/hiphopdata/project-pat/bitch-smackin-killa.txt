Pistol packin, never slackin', bitch killa 
 Pistol packin, never slackin', bitch smackin killa 
 As I slip into the back of my mind 
 And thinkin' of gettin' caught man how could I do the time 
 The crime is a murder heard you fuckin' with my nig 
 The magnum's gonna serve ya, bitch I'm fixin to split your wig 
 I'm thinkin' out ways to get lose without a trace 
 You see without a pistol man they do not have a case 
 Erasin a fool wait until he leaves the house 
 Walkin' around his corner ride by and takin' him out 
 The box on the blocks police ride up on the scene 
 Witnesses saw the shots and I know they heard her scream 
 Redeem me the testimonies would not even last 
 In court because everybody they saw wore a mask 
 The blast from the gun was the hollow point tips 
 The kind that leave you dead in a damn perfect hit 
 I trips off a fool tryin' me on the for realla 
 He's fuckin' with a pistol packin, bitch smackin killa 
 As I ride through the hood with some undisputed niggas 
 Pain sellin, dope smokin', cold-blooded killers 
 Trigga, my nigga from the north Frayser area 
 Down with the Patster causin mass hysteria 
 Well ever stoked out best we leave with no doubt 
 Ridin' through the other side ready to take a punk out 
 Assed out sucker types you gonna learn your lesson 
 Let me see your gangsta friends shootin Smith and Wessons 
 Testin the clan just to see if you can get enough 
 You's a foolish man I'll be damned if we don't fuck you up 
 So whassup with your posse with your fuckin' game punk 
 Fuckin' with these hitmen you gonna get your ass dumped 
 Pop the trunk, get your pump, let's see what you made of 
 Watch me kill a bitch with a .38 bullet slug 
 Sell your drugs I don't care if you a dope dealer 
 Best pack a pistol bitch 'cause I'm a killer 
 You say I need to take care of my business 
 Well why are you pussy-eatin motherfuckers in it 
 You about to witness a mafia called Triple 6 
 Real niggas that don't fall all over bullshit 
 I'm tired of these motherfuckers lickin' and my Joesta 
 Let me ride up on ya with the tec and Imma show ya 
 You don't know me well punk bitch nigga bring it on 
 Niggas don't fight no more junk niggas carry tones 
 I tried to be done at first now I'm just another devil 
 Walkin' with a psychotic mind and a piece of metal
