 The pain is what, I'll bring it to you dawg 
 No love for those, who ain't about there hog 
 The script has flipped and Hypnotized has came 
 'Cause we the crew are rich off in the game 
 The hood is hard like cotton pickin' day 
 We breakin law just like we bayin slaves 
 We blaze and ride my mouth it fool of gold's 
 We sell the snow we also kick in do's 
 The murder rate increases to the full 
 The 'dro is passed after I take a pull 
 I'm hustlin sun up until sun down 
 A pharmacist wit client out on the town 
 We wild just like the gorillas in the zoo 
 If you fo weed then I'ma fuck wit you 
 Retaliation nigga it's a must 
 Don't get too close the rugers they will bust 
 (Project Pat) 
 I'm the main nigga on these bricks who don't give a fuck 
 If I had to rob a trick or a armored tuck 
 Lay it down don't you make a sound or I shall unload 
 Face the ground fo I buck you down project ain't no hoe 
 To the rule of society heavy in this shit 
 Slang chan standing on my feet playa I'm da nigga 
 Who could say when the bullets spray that I won't get hit 
 That's the change my nigga strapped with extra clip 
 Projo in and come in to blast lookin' through the mask 
 Full of gin question neva ask murder is the task 
 Poppin' lead till I empty the whole magazine 
 To yo head tryin' to chop it off like a guillotine 
 Costing me and you know I can't except a loss 
 In the M we like to get high and we like to cross 
 Who's the boss is the man standing round the chock line 
 Growin' old with his wife and kids didn't do time 
 (Project Pat) 
 Keep a trick and it ain't a hoe know dat I ain't a hoe 
 Pull the triga back aI'm fo dome crush a cantalo upe 
 Kill 'em by my weaponry 
 Man I got no preferences 
 Nothing but some bullets fo you punks with discrepancy 
 Conflicts bully shit anna and I hateraed 
 Don't be talking crazy to me hoe 'cause I ain't your bitch 
 Convict busten head with a heart neva scared 
 Quick to pull a chesten o will shoot the fuckin' lead 
 Police think they can get some 
 Drunk and strapped with a gun 
 You can see what I'm bout 
 They goin' to have to take me out 
 Chill nigga keep it chill weak niggas fake the deal 
 Goin' out to goin' out to do some shit, hesitation got 'em kill 
 Worried bout consequence, worried 'bout the witnesses 
 Put a mask on go'n in and do the shit 
 Tell the nigga chop it off, make the suckas give ya some 
 Take the goody good, don't just stand there nigga run
