Hot Boys) 
 (Project PAT) 
 Man, why these niggas always hatin' on Hynotize and Cash Money? 
 Man, fuck these niggas! 
 (Baby) 
 What's up wodie? It's these gold girll and these platinum-mouth boys 
 These big time Hot Boy$, these 3-6 boys, 
 Wit the self made millionaire Cash Money boys 
 (Turk) 
 You done fucked with the wrong nigga 
 Must they know that I ride and I shoot quicker 
 Should have known not to upset this lil nigga 
 You got a click so what nigga my click thicker 
 A bunch of real niggas that'll burn ya 
 With no waitin' catch ya slippin then jam ya up 
 Slangin' weight ain't no thang for me 
 Play by the rules 
 Or shit I'll kill yo' family 
 That's what I do 
 Bust ya chest wide open 
 And split ya fade nigga 
 And them all frozen 
 Moves from the 'K nigga 
 Turk don't play, when it's time to get serious 
 Think I'm a hoe keep it that way and stay curious 
 (Baby) 
 Niggas be shoutin' one love but wearin black gloves 
 Some niggas 26 and 28 still live in they mom house askin' for play 
 Them niggas shouldn't be respected, they fake 
 Instead of hittin' blocks with glocks and touchin' niggas money spot 
 And breakin' bread with the woman who put 'em in that spot 
 These niggas wanna trick they hoes 
 And play with they nose 
 Instead of totin' fo' fo's and movin' fuckin' kilos 
 Nigga I done bought more cars than niggas done bought pussy hoes 
 And bought more rims than niggas done fucked they main hoe in they assholes 
 3-6 told me to roll and unload 
 But nigga fuck that 
 I'm tryin' to stack and mack 
 And that deal with Universal shoulda showed that 
 But Uptown is where it's at 
 Playboy won't you tell me how you luv that? 
 Won't you tell me how you luv that? 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 Ballers 
 We be on some twanky twankies 
 Playa hatas get found stanky stanky 
 Trickin fat blunts of that danky danky 
 Big diamond rangs on our panky panky 
 (Juvenile) 
 Fuck with 3-6 Mafia gon' make me millions 
 Fuck with CMR gon' make me some more millions 
 I can see it, I'm a kill 'em 
 And build me and building 
 And put some money to the side for my mom and my children 
 Ridin' with my nigga Rambezee, to the easy 
 Drinkin' for my nigga Babyzee and B.G.eezy 
 Ducked off 
 Tinted windows on my candy apple cut dawg 
 It's a classy nigga fuck y'all 
 (Juicy J) 
 I'm representin' Northern Memphis to the fuckin' fullest 
 We ain't the kind to tote a gun when there ain't no bullets 
 And when that drama starts the strap we expect to pull it 
 You see a nigga holdin' gauge and you wish he would have 
 Rolled by yo' mama house and put her in a coma 
 'Cause niggas gone on that Hennessey and marijuana 
 And now we back up in the hood on a burner phone-a 
 In that game slangin' came to you blood donors 
 It's on, coward 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 They call me quick draw 2 pistols Lil Wayne 
 Champagne took my brain I don't think I just aim 
 Drop tops on a Z-3 
 Start shootin' like 3 burners 
 How come them try me 
 Never know me block burner 
 Better watch for lil shorty in black 
 Nigga get back 
 Bout to make my glock 40 click clack 
 Brrr kill it 
 It's yo Life 
 Spill It 
 Playin' with the realest 
 Pop fire like a skillet 
 Now nigga what the dilly 
 Highly influenced on Cristal 
 I'm warnin' you to clear the set because it gets wild 
 I be disguised as a mailman with a pistol 
 Then deliver him 50 shots and take his child 
 (DJ Paul) 
 Punk bitch I dare ya 
 I double dare ya step against this pot belly 
 Bitches they try to step to the ruler but they ain't ready 
 Weak ass them cowards try to make moves but I knock 'em out 
 2nd ones step y'all need more help 2 barrels in his mouth 
 Face it when this shits fucked up you gotta deal with it 
 This is my game, live with it or get killed with it 
 These are my dice 
 This is my board I let you roll off 
 And how you gon' have ice when I cut your fuckin' water off 
 (Project Pat) 
 It's the project nigga roll back I own them bricks 
 Kickin' game with the Hot Boy$ and 3-6 
 B.G., Juvenile, Baby, Lil Wayne 
 North Memphis, Uptown, and we havin' thangs 
 AIn't no thang when ya come real ya gotta shine 
 I'm strapped with a glock 9, he ain't takin' mine 
 We in our prime puttin' in work players never rush it 
 Full of gin, fucking hoes, like I'm mad Russian 
 A discussion amongst men means a power move 
 Is about to be made for a come-up fool 
 Slang that iron when you get in my business 
 Hypnotize, Cash Money, on the rise bitch
