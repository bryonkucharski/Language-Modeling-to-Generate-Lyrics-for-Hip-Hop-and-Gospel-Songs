Man, you got me goin' crazy Baby 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 (Chorus: Butch Cassidy (Snoop Dogg)) 
 (Butch Cassidy) 
 Feels like I'm losin' control 
 And I don't even know 
 Girl you hurt me oh so bad 'cause I love you so, hey 
 But it don't matter now 
 I'm doin' better now 
 Whatever you do, Bitch 
 Will come back to you, Bitch 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey, hey 
 (I was in love at times) 
 (I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes) 
 (Snoop Dogg (Butch Cassidy)) 
 Now who would ever think that I wanted her home? 
 Three kids and a wife, never be alone 
 A dog in the front yard and that picket fence 
 Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense 
 (I'm a family man sportin' a wedding band) 
 I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn 
 I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you 
 The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through 
 (The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in) 
 I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
 "Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'" 
 We was makin' chemistry, but who is he? 
 And how this nigga know the deal about you and me? 
 (I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?") 
 She looked at my eyes with no reply 
 So I cried 
 I was in love at times 
 I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I was in love at times 
 They say game don't wait, ha Warren G? 
 Well the game better wait for me 
 I'm spendin' my time while I'm writin' these rhymes 
 In the Hills for real, sippin' wines 
 Girl, you's a dime 
 Got me losin' my mind 
 Well if lovin' you is a crime 
 I'm down to do my time 
 Lock me up and throw away the key 
 I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be" 
 I see you with me forever 
 We can do things that you never, 
 Thought you could've 
 Up out the hood-uh 
 Is where I took you 
 Never overlooked you 
 I can't believe that you shook to another spot 
 And left me cold, now I'm hot 
 I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do? 
 I gave you everything that you needed 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 You know what girl? 
 I was in love with you and you treated me like that, 
 But you know what they say? 
 What goes around comes around 
 (Butch Cassidy) 
 How could, how could, you do me wrong? 
 You be messin' up my songs 
 Now a nigga must move on 
 Gave love, and you just, straight played on me 
 Had a nigga sick for weeks 
 Now I must begin my streak
