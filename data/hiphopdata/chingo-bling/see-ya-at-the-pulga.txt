He primo wachala con mi disco is gonna com out real soon 
 Its called Chingo Bling, the name of the CD is "what did he said", because, 
 A lot of people they like to say "what did he said" all right, I don't know whys 
 Y'all some little putitos some little jotitos 
 Got more wood in my wrinkle 
 Than them boys in home depot 
 Chingo Bling culero the number one freestylera 
 You might know me from el grupo "Los Traileros" 
 Hog the lane swang and bang Chingo Bling piece 'n' chain 
 Got a rooster on my back and under that it says my name 
 Little diamonds on my chain, 
 Big diamonds on my ring, 
 Other one is on my pinky crawlin on some twinky inky 
 Chingo Bling I'm on fire 
 You can't stop me, you don't know 
 I just bearly met your hoe, took her back to M'xico (wachala) 
 Diamonds platinum how I chine 
 You don't wanna see me pull out my 9 
 Diamonds on my wrist that'll make you go blind 
 Cover your eyes if you don't wanna go blind 
 -Hey louisa why you left me for Chingo- 
 -Cause you don't got no diamonds stupiiiiid- 
 You see me at the pulga you don't see me at the mall 
 I started to run fast, but the migra made me fall 
 Sopita de rice, sopita de pollo 
 Tengo dientes de ice you got dientes de foil 
 Aqui mero culeros por Los Stone City Records 
 Mirame girl mira mira 
 Platinum and diamonds stupid no chingaderas 
 You know what you wanna see me with big tiggers en el basement 
 Or you might see me with Johnny Canales 
 Mismo jale just different canales okay 
 And you little boot leggers bootleggin my chit in underground 
 Stop it! 
 'Cause I already know ok stop it! Putaaas... 
 Stop bootleggin my chit culeros!
