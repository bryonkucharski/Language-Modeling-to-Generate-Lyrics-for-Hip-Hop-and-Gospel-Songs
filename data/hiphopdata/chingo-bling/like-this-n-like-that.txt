It's like this and like that, the hood got my back 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks, slangin masa like crack 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks (x3), slangin masa like crack 
 They said you've never been caught, boy you must be lucky 
 But don't go parkin by my tires, you better hush puppy 
 They never catch us all, it'll never stop 
 Any time, any corner, baby I'm a set'em chopped 
 As long as that trunk go pop, as long as that trunk open 
 I'm a steady be served and board my hustle, before they broken 
 Flip it, flip it, flip it more that burger king 
 We use this distribution, we be servin' thangs 
 Don't perk your smuggle, in my big belt buckle 
 The border got the feds, but we the underground tunnels 
 We pack the back, two trucks on the road 
 So if they stop the first one, we lose half the load 
 Systema, got ostrich seats in my beama 
 I'm rappin' for my people, you can put that on selena 
 And right now they got us cleanin up katrina 
 Yo kanye!, bush don't like mexicans eitha. 
 It's like this and like that, the hood got my back 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks, slangin masa like crack 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks (x3), slangin masa like crack 
 Stacks, rubberband them, tamales I still sell them 
 So next year, I can pull up in a brown phantom 
 Them boys can't stand him, 'cause he too too flashy 
 Went from ashy to classy, to down right nasty 
 (Voice:) (ey mijito, your gonna get jacked)- 
 Boy, I wish you would 
 Monte Carlo pimpin' wood, same color as? blood 
 Slabs on driveway, that make 'em say ay wey 
 Catch you on the highway, pendejas from the myspace 
 Mouth wide open, tongue hangin' like a pervert 
 When they see the wrist, it'll sing lookin' like some churbert 
 I sold the masa just to see how the paper feel 
 Either cop a field, 'cause I caught the better record deal. 
 It's like this and like that, the hood got my back 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks, slangin masa like crack 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks (x3), slangin masa like crack 
 Lately, I've been havin' rich people problems 
 I made another couple million, hopin that will solve'em 
 Promise, lookin' to reject your favorite rap star 
 Willy's chain, balls, grillz, puffs house to sims car 
 They lookin' at me like where the fuck they found them 
 Whoever the fuck signed them, I bet that they gon fire'em 
 But it's official, big chile slash asylum 
 You know the three digits, bitch you better dial'em. 
 It's like this and like that, the hood got my back 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks, slangin masa like crack 
 Yeah I'm makin' paper stacks (x3), slangin masa like crack 
 Chingo Bling! The quiero 
 Por favor, believe it 
 Tamale king pin, king pin, king pin.
