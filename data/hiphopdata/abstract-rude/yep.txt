Yep! 
 That ATUY2K, here. 
 Up and do it on my mass men affiliates. 
 Now, vibes. 
 You like that? 
 All we gotta do is 
 Record the song and tweak the mix 
 Compile the album, go down the list 
 Some hit some miss, that risk you take 
 One hit, you rich, that dream you make 
 Ya cash advance, for master dat 
 If you have the chance, don't slack on wax 
 Get radio spins, from shakin' they hands 
 When you read they palms, they made you spend 
 It's sold not told, go platinum gold 
 Pay back what's owed, whether fast or slow 
 Be black and bold, just have some soul 
 Many lack the flow, only half of whole 
 I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
 People not open never fall asleep 
 Yep! 
 I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
 People not open never fall asleep 
 I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
 Hip hop (Hip hop) 
 Hip hop, if it were not for you, I'd probly 
 Walk the street, carry clocks and heat 
 Be on some ill shit that you would not believe 
 Maybe a cat thief, givin' you grief, family beef 
 Instead I use the inner-eye energy and chi 
 That all seems simplified for you and me 
 Though we hardcore unorthodox mass ministry (Yep!) 
 So my folks is loc's, all my dogs is hyped 
 You for sure got jokes, all talk with a mic 
 You lost your stripes, ghetto pass revoked 
 Don't let cash get low, can't go back no mo' 
 In the game there's pain, small fries big names 
 Some die in vain, it's a cryin' shame 
 Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
 Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
 Yep! 
 Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
 All we gotta do is 
 Collect the wards, show respect on tour 
 Don't neglect the floor, to the top we soar 
 Dear God it bumps, if you've got the humps 
 Speakers in your trunk, and you're blazin' skunk 
 And you're diggin' the vibe with me and Tribe Unique 
 Up to the highest peak, public outreach 
 See what works for you may not work for me 
 I give 'em the same feelin' of our first LP 
 You want work released, I move merchandise 
 Yeah you took that heat, was it worth the price 
 Many hurt themselves, helps they record sales 
 End up next in jail, makin' threats and bail 
 Be a musical person, you're confused and you're searchin' 
 You know danger is lurkin', you'll be hurtin' for certain 
 Many chase the lights, but they game ain't tight 
 Coulda sunk the shot, but they aim wa'nt right 
 I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
 Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
 Yep! 
 I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn
