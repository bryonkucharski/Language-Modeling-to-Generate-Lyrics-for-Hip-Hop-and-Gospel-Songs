Mass distortion the amps are screaming 
 Pandemonium in the B-Boy Kingdom 
 Destroy and sting 'em venomous sharp tip 
 Feeling his pen strokes 
 For women and men folk 
 Ab's recording for bastard orphans 
 All homes is broken life's in your hands 
 Don't let the moment stifle your plans 
 God bless the homeless no one supports them 
 Puffin' Alaskan or maybe some Oregon 
 Feel the wrath of Scorpion to your misfortune 
 Set the torches, my last one scorched 'em 
 Now they back for more of this natural order 
 'Stract is sort of addictive on ya 
 Strong as a prescription for some pure ganja 
 Code of Honor and secret holdin' 
 From the oldest shamen to youngest, quote it in 
 Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?) 
 With swords and shields and guns and knives 
 With pens and pads turntables mics we're 
 Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?) 
 With chains and bats brass knuckles pipes 
 With rhymes I write that can shed some light on this 
 Mass confusion the spotlight beaming 
 Trip like illusions in colliseums 
 My contribution will fry their braincells 
 Blaze a tight rhyme now it's time to raise hell 
 We come with the bomb and best cuts 
 And when the show's over your hair is messed up like 
 Mass distortion grabbin' the porcelain 
 Drunk too much gin throw it back up nauseous 
 Cautious, do not drink too much nightly don't know 
 When my last day here might be 
 Rights of passage, life's a math test 
 Add up your successes and losses clashes 
 With arch-rivals, we tribal 
 My whole discography's a Bible 
 Don't bite your idols 
 Won't play high-post 
 But when I sleep it's only one eye closed, niggas
