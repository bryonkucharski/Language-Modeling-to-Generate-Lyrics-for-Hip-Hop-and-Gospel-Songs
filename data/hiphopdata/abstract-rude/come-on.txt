Ugh, ugh, scorpion sting crush 
 A.T.U. with DJ EQ 
 Come on [scratched] "Come on" 
 Come on, "Come on" Scorpion sting crush 
 Come on, "Come on" 
 Butterfly wing dust, scorpion sting crush 
 Lion tough, lion rough 
 COME ON, follow and burrow and bite 
 I'ma twirl the line when you cross and my phenomenon strikes 
 Tomorrow tonight like it's the Armageddon fight 
 The bomb in my book, drop it when I'm ready to write 
 It truly run through me, like the blood's in my pen 
 And the ink's in my veins while I'm thinkin' these thangs 
 Got my brain overloaded often 
 My life gotta change before I go to my coffin 
 Not in the game for sortin, we offer the pain of losses 
 Hope I ain't the end to pallbear 
 Because many are slain, I'm cautious 
 I'm tryin' to refrain from nightmare 
 I'm wakin' in cold sweats, I eliminate stress to my own best ability 
 None of you rappers shiver me timbers 
 What if a fashion statement Ab makes 'em remember 
 'Stract Rude with the massive agenda 
 Come on, "Come on" 
 I said come on, "Come on" 
 Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush 
 Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush 
 Shadowbox, hit the punch bag, acceptor 
 Won't win battlin, Tribe Unique's got wetter 
 Who that sayin' the Ab ain't gainin the game 
 They're mistakin identity and blasphemy of my name 
 Breakin your energy field, lion untamed 
 Smartest of the artists, hardest of thugs gettin' game 
 Like mobbers were marching that Malcolm X-type pain 
 Fill out the carcass with heavy blood flow, slain 
 Gotta rhyme for each kind in your crew 
 Or any other solo appearance you might do 
 Too tight to go against, to the severity of your punishment 
 Reflects the gravity of the offence 
 Heavy casualties, my battles be intense (ugh) 
 Your lyrical obituary reads that of the events 
 That took place, I gave chase, you couldn't save face 
 What a disgrace, that's what makes great heavyweights 
 Come on "Come on" 
 Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush 
 Come on "Come on" 
 Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush 
 You could train five miles on an exercise bike 
 But you couldn't gain my styles, we the flexin 'em type 
 Though I appear docile, I know when to get hype 
 You wanna make me hostile on the radio mic 
 And when I'm in person it's worst, my no rehearsin, free versin 
 And it hurts when I let my jagged edged words disperse 
 You won't get a word in edge, why? 'Cause I served ya first 
 You can second guess and live to rhyme, what's your purpose on Earth? 
 Well I write in cursive and print, and jot down in my pad 
 Toss out your turf in the war, till you throw out the white flag 
 Surrender contender, when I chop your lumbar say "Timber!" 
 And I got your number, 17th of November, I take you under 
 My inner eye, a thunder remembers like elephants 
 With big trunks and big tusks, big topics to discuss 
 Butterfly wing dust, scorpion sting crush 
 Lion tough, lion rough, all right
