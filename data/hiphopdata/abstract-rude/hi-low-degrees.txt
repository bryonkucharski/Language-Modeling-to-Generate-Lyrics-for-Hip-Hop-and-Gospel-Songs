(Intro/Hook: x2) 
 From the high degrees to the low degrees 
 Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze 
 Fahrenheit, very low 
 Icicle, hail storm, below zero 
 Temperature, closed doors, wet conditions are unhealthiest 
 Weather war, about minus four Celsius 
 Sky's presence, absence of solar there 
 Snow's essence, existence of polar bears 
 Only strong survive in this habitat 
 Forever off and on, life is a thermostat 
 Will you melt? Apply with the belt tractor 
 Still you felt my style's wind chill factor 
 In a pack of rappers, actual, natural disaster 
 Raps that go faster than wind speed 
 Tracks by the masters indeed 
 The season for freezin and green need 
 Dog sled stampede by the freezed slave calvary 
 I relieve those updated, cowardly fools never made it, through the art 
 Fire logs, oven on 
 Hot metal, hot wax, brimstone 
 In a hell hole, sell your soul for the go 
 Burn rubber, burn blunts, burn coals 
 For the smell-good, tales from the hood well understood, so 
 Hot I shook the spot to pop a squad on this block 
 Pressure cooker pot, to know the time look at her watch 
 For the boiling point, evaporation and your life stops 
 You bring the heat they can't believe that (They can't believe that) 
 They gathered together the flare up, tear up and bring the heat back 
 Like modern day Nat Turner's with black burners 
 Everybody gotta heater and we'll burn ya 
 Just like Kilbey's for loin cloth 
 Cocktail tusk, not a roof is lit 
 Hell we don't need no water, burn down the shit 
 Seems ain't nobody quiet in a riot 
 My amp is HOT, high voltage in my WATTS 
 Blowin' up the spot, blow up your radio box 
 See me with the bingin, steamin like an engine 
 Can't take the heat get out of the kitchen quick bitch 
 High degrees to the low degrees 
 Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze 
 (From the) High degrees to the low degrees 
 Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze 
 I burn blunts with my Gz...
