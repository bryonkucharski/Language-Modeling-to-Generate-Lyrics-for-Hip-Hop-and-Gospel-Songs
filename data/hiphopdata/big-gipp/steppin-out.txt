(Feat. Sleepy Brown) 
 (Sleepy Brown) 
 Mirror Mirror on the wall... 
 Who's the freshest of them all, Baby? 
 Ooh... 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 Feeling good with the Shamoe just like I would 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 Don't really care long as you and I are there 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 'Cause we're on the scene 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 With the gangster lean 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 You wanna be on my team? 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 (Ooh ooh, We're Steppin Out!) 
 (Verse 1: Bigg Gipp) 
 Mirror, Mirror, Mirror 
 Tell me what do you see? 
 My face, I.D. samilo poochies 
 Pants by Gucci, cordoroy chucks, cordoroy cap 
 Presidential smoking the strawberry wrap 
 So chilly my reaction to my presence, like Burrr 
 Minks, lambskins, gorillas, the fox furs 
 Whatever the flavors that she would like to see 
 I'm a Doctor peep me in my Fruit of my D's 
 Off in my closet alone with my favorite cologne 
 That I cadone I'm ma skeet skeet skeet skeet on 
 Fresh feet on so much candy on my boat 
 You can eat on the hub 
 Put my heat on the wood 
 Speed on, is good 
 Tonight there will be no commericials or re-runs 
 Just coolin sipping freon 
 Talking to my folks on the phone on the freon 
 Takin' my favorite rocccck whenever we steppin ouuut 
 (We're Steppin Out!) 
 (Chorus: Sleepy Brown) 
 (Verse 2: Big Gipp) 
 You wanna meet the authentic 
 The way I walk it, the way I talk it 
 They can't be ready 
 My hat bent smoke scent blueberry scent 
 Either I'ma B.R.O. or your mind just moving too slow 
 Gipp... 
 Flip it at best give it right back to you in gifts 
 As I slide piering out the doulley wop window 
 Checking out the talk that walk the sidewalk 
 As I critique the streetbeat on this street called 
 Beatstreet 
 Ol boy y'all killing me what will it be 
 Visions of level 3 or one twezzy 
 Catch 'em breezy sometimes its just too easy 
 Star struck to eager to please me 
 Should I play pimp make 'em pay feezy 
 Straight fucking 'em up leaving these crows dizzy 
 Without a doubt you see me 
 Bigg Gipp Steppin Out I'm the king to the city 
 (Chorus: Sleepy Brown) 
 (Verse 3: Big Gipp) 
 No matter the cost still floss ross 
 Post up charlie trading post 
 Buttondown dickies hips still squeeky 
 Post fly ladies in them 240 E's now ooh weee 
 If the world could see me really how it be 
 So cashmatic acromatic then when I proceed 
 Let it subseed, bunglow over seas 
 Keep an attitude like Dame Dash look at that ass 
 I can't, let that pass not that fast 
 And I ain't spending no cash I bring color to the outside 
 Go head and decide unlock your car doors 
 And let a G-Ride that stay sit 
 Now I'm on the inside lets slide 
 Spare a doubey for the jacuzzi 
 Me and my new fluzy 
 That's how I put on that's what I'm talkin' bout 
 The lights and the phone off finger snap 
 That's a wrap 
 (Chorus: Sleepy Brown)
