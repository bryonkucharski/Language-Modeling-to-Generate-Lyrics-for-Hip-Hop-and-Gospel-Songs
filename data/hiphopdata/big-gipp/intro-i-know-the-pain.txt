I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 Let it be known Gipp love to bury muffins with no stuffin' 
 Problem child to this industry like David Ruffin' 
 155 pounds going straight in your kisser 
 And take a position, then split a partition, I started rollin' with a mo' home 
 Pick up a penny hope it turn into a twenty but the day end home 
 A classic in the street like Reebok 
 Grew up on the human beat box, I kick the door up off the hinge 
 I roll the windows to the ceiling 
 Been on a mission, dealing with my feelings like Max Payne 
 Analytically driven, emotionally living in pain 
 If I had to do it, oversee, I do it again 
 I know 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 Yeah, I do this for the kids, I do this for the mommas 
 I do this for the children that ain't ever had a father 
 Too many to remember mentally but yo I try 
 Sometimes I'm blinded by the cataracts up in my eye 
 Like Little Bo Peep, she standing in the street 
 And even ain't got no shoes for them mutilated feet 
 Good golly Miss Molly, addicted to Bacardi 
 Don't even know the difference between love and a party 
 And old men con young women, that's wrong 
 Don't they know the 30s and the 40s been gone 
 Inconspicuously, I slide to the side on 
 [Incomprehensible] I hypnotize through the voice tone 
 Already been, confronted myself to transcend 
 Tales from an adolescent years to young teens 
 When everything I used to own, used to sit on the dresser 
 I rode the bus to [Incomprehensible] the train 
 I know the rain, I know the pain 
 Construction jobs kept callouses on my hand 
 I know the pain 
 Crystallize me to a man 
 I know the pain 
 Believe in something higher then man 
 I know the pain 
 When it didn't work I fell on my knees and called his name 
 (I know, I know, I know, I know pain) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain 
 I know, I know, I know, I know pain
