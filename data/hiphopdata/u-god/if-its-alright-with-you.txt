(Featuring you God) 
 Yeah ninety six Park Hill style 
 Burial ground sound in it forever Dunn 
 Politic 
 Verse One: Cappadonna/Cappachino 
 Here we come right through your eardrum Dunn 
 Cherry head catch feel the draft of the aks 
 You catch one trying to pretend you could win 
 Headlock show the block kid counterattack 
 Don of mine stay connect 4th Disciple trife 
 Ain't nothin' ice cream, kid you get blown like steam 
 Park Hill Projects, the black Idi Amin 
 Ninety-six era, not the crossover lever 
 Chain swinger talk swing, probably wardrobe king 
 So what now? Industry kids'll lock it down 
 Only two loyal, dustin that find you there for 
 You wanted to enter thirty-six in the soil 
 My technique is speak have you knocked out weak 
 Forever in it, my slang dick goes so deep 
 Thirsty for hip-hop, Staten Isle niggaz can't stop 
 Runnin' wild like a child till we reach the top 
 Stapleton, New Bright, and West Brighton the harbor 
 Connect, me for vet, Don King and a tech 
 Thug cats'll get done up on black man's sun up 
 Cap the imperial, bring out new material 
 You hold me down, analyze all cherry-head 
 Wu is in town, catch the hand-off 
 Prepare for my dancehall standoff 
 Mercy when I come blow your mic-hand off, sorry I touched him 
 Here they come again through customs 
 Mad ways to dead the wax one way to bust him 
 If it's all right with you it's all right with me 
 We can take this rap game to a higher degree 
 We can do this Spike Lee or how you want it to be 
 Check it, Golden Arms plus new Cappadon 
 Verse Two: you-God, AKA Golden Arms 
 These ninety-nine powerful circling swords 
 Impact from all the heat dug deep and locked on 
 Chip off the bone, hard face and hard fists 
 Chop off your option, have you felt a neck twist 
 Cassette disc and wrist, meltdown your pistol mist 
 Burnt to a crisp, bombarded my pistol grip 
 Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone 
 Leaning Tower Pisa sounds of the Mars zone 
 Chef dropped that bomb, the takeout will still linger 
 Twenty crazy christians, to lock in hole and heat up 
 Who the finger rap singer with hip layers of phlegm 
 Caused by blunt smoke, heart disease plays the friend 
 I ran out emotion, my rap style's devotion 
 I got hosts for you Soviet peoples across the ocean 
 My path releases, volcanic acids 
 Engage in the page activity is autographics 
 Fraction of my busting microphones start to lust and 
 Words plays over power practice might bust em 
 The black male persuasion known to hunt you for sane 
 The Big Apple verbal concert, for the occasion 
 The vital snap, now insert my Spinal Tap 
 I got forty more swipes to pipe, thirty slapped 
 The power from the cram broke the bottom of the pan 
 With Earth Wind and Fire, ice water dead grams 
 American hustler up and coming with a vengeance 
 Makes no magnet charge, plug vivid my extension 
 One lesson motivation for my pistol profestation 
 Slang person nailed now we move on a motation 
 Location, point-blank, on point be the vessel 
 Politic the defecit measure, point the decibel 
 We're credible, renaissance, eatin off the barrel 
 Advanced chemo, Die Hard to my demo
