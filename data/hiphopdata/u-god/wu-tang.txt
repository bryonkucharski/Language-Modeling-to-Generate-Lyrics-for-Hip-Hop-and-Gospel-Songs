(U-God) 
 You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man 
 (Wu-Tang!) 
 I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man 
 (Wu-Tang!) 
 I love bankrolls, stank hoes, camera shots, Kangols, bangles 
 Pink records, check it, yeah, I make those 
 More paper than Kinko's, check my lingo, bingo 
 On my face, honey, not a wrinkle, trinkle 
 My twinkle twinkle, make your toenails crinkle 
 Twist up a dinkle, and honey, let's mingle, jingle 
 When the nightfall, I'm tight with my white walls 
 The greedy pain, draining on my life force 
 Behold the pale white horse, the hype loss with tight jaws 
 Fight law off, 'cause I don't like y'all 
 Huh, I'm from the tar pits, the hard target to squash the market 
 You're brain washed, watch the starships 
 I make cars flip, Deck bomb atomic, Islamic arms 
 Kiss the comet, this time, he's gone 
 I grip the don, rip arms out the socket, cock it 
 Fly logic, now watch me sky rocket, watch it 
 Hot as the tropic get, bulletproof asaphogus 
 Steel cage confidence, burn it on a floppy disc 
 Swerve the metropolis, my whole team in back of me 
 You just a half of ki, I'm a coke factory 
 (x2) 
 You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man 
 (Wu-Tang!) 
 I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man 
 (Wu-Tang!) 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo, thank god it's Friday, like it's just me and my chick 
 Cruising the highway, she twisting my piff 
 You see I'm living proof that crime pay, the type that go at a bitch 
 The type to shoot the gift, and blow every clip 
 I know this money like the back of my hand, you get the back of my hand 
 Just like a fiend who took a package and ran 
 Po-po be hopping out of passenger vans, harassing niggas in Park Hill 
 For marked bills, ratchets and grams 
 So I move like I'm ducking a charge, I'm trying to set up shop 
 Get this gwop, get the fuck out of dodge 
 Most my niggas like to puff in the car, most these hoes emotionally scared 
 And keep the works stuffed in they bras 
 This is ghetto rap, where the pot be calling the kettle black 
 My bullets trynna see where they head is at, I'm heading back 
 To the slums, back to the block, I got the Clan on my back 
 And you know we heading back to the top, nigga 
 [U-God] (x2) 
 You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man 
 (Wu-Tang!) 
 I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man 
 (Wu-Tang!)
