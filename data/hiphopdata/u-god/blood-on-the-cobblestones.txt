Ayo it's war on the street, blood on the cobblestone 
 I leave 'em buried alive, just like a fossil bone 
 Body bags line the streets, reporters reportin' 
 Mafia ties, drugs and extortion 
 DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news 
 Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose 
 Judges get kidnapped, casualties get decapitated 
 Starks rise above all to be emancipated 
 Black Godfather, families at war 
 Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score 
 Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties 
 I made sure to keep guns, you know my faculties 
 The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us 
 Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected 
 To each is own, grab a gun off the shelf 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware 
 Never close your eyes in the barber chair 
 The heart of a lion, that's what got him here 
 Bulletproof the car, yo we outta here 
 Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines 
 Bone-crushing niggas like a football team 
 Under a new regime, The old we throw it out 
 Spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out 
 Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse 
 Sip the brown liquor, while we move a quarter ounce 
 Pick the territories, move north or south 
 The high power shine, Yours is watered down 
 I'm underground, with the vest is on 
 Open up your head, now your flesh is torn 
 Never turn my back up at restaurants 
 Put holes in your chest, come test the don 
 45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today 
 Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay 
 Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain 
 Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game 
 Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard 
 Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve 
 Make a lead on me, repping for the territory 
 No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory 
 You want a war? These men pop dangerous 
 Taking all in a 10 block radius 
 Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip 
 Like it got hit with a couple of missiles 
 8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib 
 In a wig, in a cable guy uniform 
 My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope 
 Moving close, say the word, Tone, do this Ghost
