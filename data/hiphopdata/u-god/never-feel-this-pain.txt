Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs 
 Fillin' blunts in the building front thuggin' for ones 
 Full clips, fly dicks, down somethin' to pump 
 Whole cliques fly whips, dimes nothin' to son 
 City boy on the corner, I was so involved 
 So the drama I embraced it with open arms 
 Was tryin' to shake the pain, hopin' I could break the chains 
 Every day the same, who am I to make a change? 
 Will my niggas risk it all just to play the game? 
 And the young'uns goin' through it tryin' to play the same 
 Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire 
 Sent to your son, forgive me for the sins that I've done 
 My life, my pain lasts forever 
 Nothin' in these streets makes it better 
 My life, my pain lasts forever 
 Nothin' in these streets makes it better 
 And so I live on 
 Sittin' here thinkin' drinkin' got a, lot on my mind 
 Is my, life shrinkin' am I, caught in the times 
 It's a, quarter to nine and I'm, grabbin' my nine 
 I had dreams I just, wanted to rhyme 
 Climb my ways out these whack-ass ghettos 
 I signed my name on the line with the devil 
 Still in my prime weight but lost minds are settled 
 Pots on the stove, move grandma's kettle 
 Late for my job, he thinks he's a star 
 She hates her husband, she says I'm a slob 
 Mixed feelin's she ain't gettin' involved 
 Battle of the sexes, the planet's off its axis 
 The IRS God damn I owe these taxes 
 The truth hurts, but I can take it 
 It's a long time comin', but I can make it 
 No mistakin', the cream is back 
 I'm standin' on my own two 
 I got my niggas, true niggas, real niggas! 
 Stop the wheel really? You only feel me 
 If you walk the same road, talk the same code 
 Still dwellin' in the hell and find the time to make a home 
 The few who escape will try to find a safer zone 
 I ain't waitin for Obama, never doubted him, I'm proud of him 
 He real, he'll spend a couple million in the housing then 
 Seein' is believin', my vision is blurred 
 'Cause I ain't seein' nothin' I heard, really nothin' but words 
 The bottom line I'm still stuck to the curb 
 Sky high but it wasn't the sherm, really nothin' but herbs 
 I risk it all for the cause 
 Even if it's war with the law won't pause 
 I can't won't don't stop, I ain't got an off switch 
 Dyin' tryin' to live it just to get a small part of it 
 My squad is sick, type that you don't want problems with 
 Rollin' like seventy Mack trucks, what's stoppin' it? 
 Oh oh said I live 
 I live, I live, ooh whoa
