(U-God) 
 Ruff out here 
 I'm out here fightin 
 Cold and hungry 
 Fish ain't bittin 
 Life's so frightening 
 I'm damn near thumpin 
 Cold and crumbling 
 Nothin's hatching 
 Now I'm back 
 In stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go 
 Whoa 
 Stuck in the cold in the cold no place to go 
 Whoa 
 I'm out here fightin 
 Cold and hungry 
 Fish ain't bittin 
 Lights so brightlin 
 Damn near thumpin 
 Broke and crumbling 
 Nothin's hatchin 
 Now I'm back 
 In stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go 
 Whoa 
 Stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go cold 
 Exploooooooooooooooode 
 (U-God) 
 I hit the concrete 
 Show and prove to all the ruff man in stove fuse burn it's bomb week 
 Watch when I snug e'm 
 You won't see nutin 
 But the dust when the mightiest to the finest crust 
 The blindest the vodka's don't yo 
 We rabbit the land 
 Unkind it's hard to manage 
 FBI 
 And the Public Eye 
 The rap seems sord of savage but those 
 Live in the math 
 As doc cash livin' fast 
 Shang fool anger 
 Consealed in IMS 
 Out the ass of the 36 chamber 
 God get a grasp 
 It's rhyme time 
 Time's is gettin' harder 
 Damn he spoilled rotten 
 Hot livin' colla 
 Remember when coke was $18.00 a gram 
 Now I was a scholar for sellin bottles 
 Now I'm in the high class models 
 Never to rest 
 Material's his Eyes 
 On fire on my chest 
 Stress full throttle 
 Russian's still place yard testin my strengh 
 Fuck you with my motto 
 "Huff" 
 Here why ??????? For survivel I monster truck you 
 Buck you some more 
 You be stuck to the wall with a big fuck you fuck you 
 In the search continue 
 I build to fill my cup 
 For peace of American life 
 I don't really give a fuck 
 I don't wanna die I don't wanna go 
 I wan't total knowledge I don't wanna be hold left in the cold pickin' up 
 Our garbage 
 My lung's are grungy die harder four course swash by diction in the graphd 
 Man lord's Hungry... 
 I'm out here fightin 
 Cold and hungry 
 Fish ain't right in 
 Nice so bright in 
 I'm damn near thumpin 
 Cold and crumbling 
 Nothin's hatching 
 Now I'm back 
 In stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go 
 Stuck in the cold the cold no place to goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 I'm out here fightin cold and hungry 
 Fish ain't right in 
 Nice so bright in 
 I'm damn near thumpin 
 Broke and crumbly 
 Nothin's hatchin 
 Now I'm back 
 In stuck in the cold 
 In the cold 
 With no place to gooooooooooooooooooooo 
 Stuck in the cold 
 In the cold 
 With no place to go 
 Cold exploooooooooooooooode
