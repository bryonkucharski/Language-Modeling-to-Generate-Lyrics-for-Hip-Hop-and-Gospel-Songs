(Verse 1: U-God) 
 Thanks for the rap action pack satisfaction 
 Snatch over match kiss the grand dragon 
 I'm tramplin the mass riddin head champion 
 Back draft crash landin 
 Last man standing 
 All bodies full of swords 
 Cards of confusion 
 Killa bee guarntee 
 The guilotine execution 
 Reviloution air pollution 
 New budda diva fairy, beaver, be cleaver, fever, curry speaker 
 Sweet creature hurry knockin' 
 Dirty rockin' jockin 
 One stand word is thirty shell shockin 
 Unlockin fell through the flurries 
 Hurry, don't worry cherry blow 
 Go beyond wall rip a hardcore 
 Right 
 (Chorus: U-God) 
 Someone's knockin' at the door 
 Someone's brining the swell 
 Y'all really want the fuckin' war 
 Golden Arms bringing the swell 
 Somebody knockin' at the door 
 Somebody brinin the swell 
 Young guns down for the cause 
 Golden Arms bringin' the swell 
 (Verse 2: Letha Face) 
 Last hope Staten force, stack a few thoughts 
 Burn a mens courts 
 German imports adapt to the sport 
 Smash your courts like elevator deaths 
 Hell raizer checks 
 Shells faith invest it dwells in the plate in your chest 
 Facial sweats away in your breath 
 Scrapin your best patriot blessed warzone 
 No escapin the death 
 Snake you inject venom from poison glands 
 Boy scans destroy man's 
 The only survivor if the weak hold jams 
 Boths man's a pyrex measuring cups 
 Fo' better bust permanent headrush 
 Body illustrius 
 Infamous selfdestruct 12 bomb mechanisms 
 Expertism sets down your power gland systems 
 (Chorus: U-God) 
 Somebody rockin' hardcore 
 Sombody bringin' the swell 
 Y'all really want the fuckin' war 
 Golden Arms bringin' the swell 
 Somebody rockin' hardcore 
 Somebody bringin' the swell 
 Somebody rockin' hardcore 
 Golden Arms bringin' the swell 
 (Verse 3: U-God) 
 Titanium bat 
 Drainin the crainium crack 
 Strainin your back 
 Late flap played back flippin 
 Disco daddy caddy shack 
 Glad he back, novelty size 
 Swallow me in poverty pimpin' 
 Finger lickin' hood stricken 
 Muffle detect slide 
 Shuffle the deck muscle respect, good riddens 
 Rag time drag through 
 36 pistons jerk your wrist in friction 
 Crash y'all since you in fast ball 
 And gas your last ass-whippin 
 Ask canned equipment 
 Risky district sound effect 
 Kickbox to get lift the gold shipment 
 The upmost control cut most amounted track 
 Polish my knaps 
 Now get simplicity twisted 
 Guys on top 
 Won't he despise out the meisor 
 The crypt tall bricks hit em' 
 Rip torn the bits got flipped shredded then chipped over dicer 
 (Chorus: U-God) 
 Someone knockin' at the door 
 Someone bringin' the swell 
 Y'all niggas really want the war 
 Golden Arms bringin' the swell 
 Y'all want the fuckin' hardcore 
 Golden Arms bringin' the swell 
 Young guns out for the cause 
 Golden Arms bringin' the bell 
 Bell, bell, bell, bell, bell...
