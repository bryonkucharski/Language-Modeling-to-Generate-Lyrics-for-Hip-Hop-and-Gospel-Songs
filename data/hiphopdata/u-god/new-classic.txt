 Classic, classic, classic, classic (yo) 
 Classic, classic, classic (yo, yo) 
 I got book rhymes, Crook lines, Built like tankers 
 Look Ma they took mines hook line and sinker 
 Big time thinker nailed in a pine box 
 Watching like a hawk kid, Seats in the sky box 
 Cut you with a dry ox, Slapped with a bank roll 
 Stank hoes on salary loving my lingo 
 Get money, Make moves, Burn more calorie 
 Bruise your anatomy, My atom is hard 
 Slam you on the granite dammit, Rap bandits at large 
 Pin metals on my chest, Stir up the hornet's nest 
 Burn holes in your neck, Control your flesh 
 Fat back wheels, Crack kills children 
 Every time the mack spits in the back of the building 
 Splash with a feeling, You need a healing 
 Hot shots of sake, son, you can't stop me 
 You can't drop me son or cock block me 
 I'm powder puff so ruff, slot time, Dough rush 
 Hit my enemies in your guts, Cold crush 
 Rib cage blow up, Everything's hurricane 
 Red beams tear your frame, My dick game's never lame 
 Slang right, Daylight, Hot grease and egg whites 
 Hog mics all night, Fisticuff dog fights 
 With Dillinger's, Motorized mouth out the cylinder 
 War tone, Guerrilla hormone, Vast in the ominence 
 Dance with the Ramadan, Throw y'all armor on 
 Gift wrap your karma strong, Shots out in Lebanon 
 LeBron James, Golden Arms, Large Professor, Niggas cocaine niggas
