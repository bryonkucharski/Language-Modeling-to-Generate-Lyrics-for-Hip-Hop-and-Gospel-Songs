(Chorus: U-God) 
 I got a heart of stone, flesh and bone 
 Red skin tone, rap syndrome 
 (U-God) 
 I'm that street sweeper, dope beat finder 
 Forty four piece, keep on pushing with a meat grinder 
 Heat mizer, to all you competitors 
 You regular, regular, I'm ten steps ahead of ya 
 Return of the predator, let me demonstrate 
 Make niggaz spill blood like women menunstrate 
 And I'm, fresh out the gate, guess who trunkin' through 
 If he fight to the death, I'mma buckle you 
 Yeah, I'm all stressed out, I'm not comfortable 
 I don't play by your rules, I stick and move 
 Everyday that you do, catches up to you 
 I want my cake and eat it too, stop the game 
 Leave bruises on your neck, when I pop your chain 
 Yeah, the hunger/pain, make me an awesome thug 
 I'm my own verdict, fuck the jury, the judge 
 Yeah, hear me loud, I bring fury to clubs 
 (U-God) 
 I rap gritty, 'cause the city's infested 
 I got the city trapped, trapped in my deathgrip 
 When the tech spit, we bang out excedrin 
 Yeah, you wet kid, the aftershock's around ya 
 Can't wait to let off, the eighteen pounder 
 The bulldog growler, potato on the end 
 I don't turn belly up, or jelly on a friend 
 They held me in the pens, twenty three hour options 
 Locked in, now I'm in the top ten 
 I'll never bend, heads give up 
 When I, see ready for, dead in the dust 
 I throw up the crust, then I shatter they mask 
 It's a must, it's a must, that I shoot fast, come on! 
 (U-God) 
 The streets is like Satan, I'm from the Hill 
 'Cause people keep hating, 'cause I score at will 
 Don't fuck with new niggaz, I figured they wired 
 I set 'em on fire, like the name was Pryor 
 I'm a livewire brother, that's something superb 
 Want a glass room mansion, up in New Jers' 
 Puff a dutch and an herb, stay in touch with ya bird 
 In an all black Phantom, crushing the curbs 
 Spill my guts on my word, 'cause my measure is lethal 
 From the Ooh Building, my Resident Evil 
 Throw consecutive free throws, I'm poppin' the Don 
 Better, clear the way, another blow from the Arm 
 And don't be alarmed, when I'm scrappin' this CREAM 
 With knicks the size of ice cubes, taking your fiends 
 And I popped out the rifle and M-16 
 You see me on the screen with the Charlie's Angels 
 All in the closet, keep nothing but Kangols 
 Catch him in Bahamas eating all the mango's 
 Call in for drama, bring on the pay load
