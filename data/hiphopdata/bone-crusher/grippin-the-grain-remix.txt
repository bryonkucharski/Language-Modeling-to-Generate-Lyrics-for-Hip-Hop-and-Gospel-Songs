(Bone Crusher) 
 AttenCHUN! 
 (Intro - Bone Crusher (Bun B)) 
 BC: Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone (This line repeats 4X) 
 BB: Break Em' Off (4X) 
 That Grippin' the Grain remix 
 Break Em' Off in here 
 UGK in here 
 Lil' Flip in here 
 We all in here, know what I'm talking about 
 (Chorus 2X - Bone Crusher) 
 Grippin' The Grain 
 From the front to the back 
 Can you feel my wolfers bang? 
 Coming down bumping, knocking pictures off the wall 
 (Verse 1 - Bone Crusher) 
 87 while I'm gripping the grain 
 Pimping is hard though, ain't a damn thing changed 
 Coming down so clean, shouts out to Texas man 
 I'm so fresh, my nigga you didn't know 
 Crispy starch jeans, starched down to the floor 
 Heavy set exterior, deep into the floor 
 What's y'all bitches talking about, you niggas ain't hardcore 
 This here the major don 
 Got the speakers in the trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump 
 (Chorus 2X - Bone Crusher) 
 (Last line in verse 1 run through 1st line in chorus) 
 (Verse 2 - Bun B) 
 Yeah! 
 It's Bun B, that underground king on top of ground 
 In that Cadi slabbed out with rags out and it's down 
 Chromey belts, buckles and blades that chop up and pound 
 See the Neon in my trunk when I'm popping surround 
 You be sipping on that oil, you dip off in that foil 
 Put that water in the pot, watch me whip it when it boil 
 PA I'm staying loyal, I keep letting them hang 
 Until they free that Pimp C, Steven Jackson get the rain 
 We gonna be... 
 (Chorus 2X - Bone Crusher) 
 (Verse 3 - La Chat) 
 I'm riding I - 85, big body Benz with spinning tires 
 Bubbling eye signals on the mirror, when I turn the ride 
 And the inside is just plushed out, wood grain and leather 
 Clothes like feathers, navigational system ready to go where ever 
 Ain't that clever, TV's in the backs of the head rests of the seats 
 Plus that beat, you can hear the words of twist when I'm rolling down the streets 
 So beep beep, let me have a lot of room while I'm switching my lanes 
 Fast like a train, styling and profiling while I'm grippng the grain, we... 
 (Chorus 2X - Bone Crusher) 
 (Verse 4 - Lil' Flip) 
 Well I'm gripping the grain and flippng the caine, keeping my pockets fat 
 I got dubs on my Jag, screens on my Cadillac 
 I pack a gat, nigga take it cause it ain't no time for wasting 
 Got a tech on my lap, plus a nine by the Play Station 
 I riding high, getting bent, smoking weed, passing by 
 Even when I'm just chilling, I still dress fly 
 I'm a pimp until I die, I'm putting it down for Break Em' Off 
 So if you ain't riding 20's, you got to take them off 
 Cause you looking shitty boy, 'cause I run your city boy 
 With Big Goon, Pastor, and my nigga Tity boy 
 We came to get it crunk, so fire up the slunt 
 And if that nigga talking shit, he will get jumped 
 But I just came to chill, I ain't trying to have a fight 
 I'm trying to show you niggas how a pimp turn out a dyke 
 I do this every night, motherfucker how you feel 
 From the land of the trill, the youngest one with a deal 
 I'm Lil' Flip 
 (Chorus 2X - Bone Crusher)
