The Wall The Wall 
 And we keep on struggling 
 And we ain't got nothing 
 And we need to get something [2x] 
 This woman can't put the bread on the table 
 It isn't like she isn't willing and able 
 Went down to the department of labor 
 They gave her a job, made it minimum wage uh 
 And it's like mental slavery (uh) 
 Got love for my 
 Got to war for my 
 For my 
 Be strong for the struggle 
 Hard for the struggle 
 Got to keep you hustle 
 Got to show your muscle 
 We down for the streets 
 We live in the streets 
 What's that trappin' 
 But it got to eat 
 Wanna bust your cap 
 And life makes you snap 
 But hoes don't 
 Gots to adapt 
 Lift your head up 
 Get your chin off your chest 
 Remember its hard for us all 
 That's out here on the quest 
 To be the best at what we do 
 And never accept it less 
 We all got our own destinies 
 That we must manifest 
 You can't 
 Let 'em stop you 
 And let 'em drop you 
 Sometimes a part of you just gotta do what you gotta 
 But you always keep swinging 
 From my force always know you gotta keep singing 
 You gotta get up, stand up, never give up [9x]
