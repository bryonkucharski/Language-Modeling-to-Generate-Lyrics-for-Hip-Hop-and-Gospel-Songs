Listen let that music hit you for about 5 seconds 
 There are thingz in life 
 We of people need to get, need to get our weight up 
 Together the struggle starts today people 
 Listen here we go 
 In life sometimes things ain't what they seem 
 Some say they love you don't mean a damn thing 
 Sometimes it makes me wonder why 
 This pain it hurts me deep inside 
 'Cause all I wanna do is give love 
 But all day wowdees mean mug 
 So it brings the thug in me 
 And all I want is my family wit me 
 To share in this love of life 
 For my lil shorties to eat right 
 It's the short life that we live 
 And there's a lot that you can give 
 Get up yo weight people 
 Tell 'em Tell em 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Please let me know 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Guess that's how goes 
 The wars the battles the tussles the struggles 
 From nobody to a legend 
 Give in here 
 I command your attention 
 As if I was a band, you the people in the stand understand 
 I keep my lyrics slum and rigid 
 Young prospects watch, my feet don't miss my pivot 
 Don't matter my year, my gives stay consistent 
 I went from born to blazed 
 To beautiful days and beautiful ways 
 Laying down the truth for a bankhead, respect it 
 I try to interject it, I say through the music and the medic 
 I'm dedicated to my pen and my pistol 
 My family and my hood I wish you nothing but good 
 Tell 'em Tell em 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Please let me know 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Guess that's how goes 
 We don't love ourselves, 'cause we hate who we see off in the mirror 
 A people that don lied to us 
 In the quipped to 24 7 
 Show us in the good book, if we go off to heaven, reverend 
 We swerving in our innocence 
 Taking off in yo G 44 tell the truth about my ken 44 
 Po Po scared my up honey, and gave her a stroke 
 Jammed her up wit coke, strung out on soaps 
 Just listen a beat, ain't no love in these streets 
 And it's a shame what a nigga gotta do to feed his family 
 Trappin, scrappin, head stung 
 I made my mistakes in the past, but I was young and dumb 
 Learn from the thug, learn from the bars, learn from the ghetto, learn from the slum 
 I forget 'bout the struggle, I can't get by without the help from my sister and my brothers 
 Tell 'em Tell em 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Please let me know 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Guess that's how goes 
 Never say never, I'm clever 
 Cutter butter brother 
 Shut her motherfuckin lips wit my clip 
 Take a trip, take you way up in yo whip 
 A legendary, underestimated, underrated, hated by the critics 
 But I spit it, make 'em git it 
 Kick it when I hit yo city, 
 Hook me up with the best greens they serve 
 I took a bird in the red eye 
 I'm workin' till I'm dead eye 
 The mission never ends 
 I'm up for them lazy ass 
 Mo gon clap dough, silly from they growth 
 True niggaz they know, stay together till it's over 
 Staring out the window of my old home, 
 We older 
 I'm never sober 
 I'm never sober 
 Tell 'em Tell em 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Please let me know 
 Why we hate ourselves so 
 Guess that's how goes
