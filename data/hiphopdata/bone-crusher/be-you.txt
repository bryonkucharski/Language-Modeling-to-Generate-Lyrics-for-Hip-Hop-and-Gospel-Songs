Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life' 
 I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life' 
 All throughout my life I done the best I can 
 Ignore the people trying to lecture me on how to live 
 I made my own rules, I played my own game 
 And now my so called friends are jealous on how far I came 
 I tried and tried again, sometimes I even failed 
 But through my struggles I will never give up on myself 
 So hear me loud and clear, listen to every word 
 Your petty ways don't exist in this bad boy's world 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me 
 You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life' 
 I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life' 
 Please don't worry yourself, I'm doing perfectly fine 
 Besides your helping hand wasn't extended all this damn time 
 They criticized and laugh, they said I could never win 
 But now I see they smiling faces time and time again 
 Looking for a hand outs, broke, with their hands out 
 Shameful, trying to keep their food out my baby's mouth 
 Just trying to feed my family and do right by God 
 Just let me live my life and do my job, job, job, job 
 You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life' 
 I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me 
 My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'
