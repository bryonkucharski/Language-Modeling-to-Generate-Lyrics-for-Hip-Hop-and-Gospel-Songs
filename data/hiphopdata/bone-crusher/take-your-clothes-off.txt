 Make you're in, now, run a long and let me holler at your friends 
 Shake it like a motherfucker, move it like a vibrator 
 Shorty kinda a sweet and they shook her like annihilator 
 Popo with their bed breakers, all they got their bread makin' 
 Alcohol with this fish brining mo makin' all I need is new shoes 
 'Cause he about to start a screw 
 Momma gotta work gotta do what she gotta do 
 Beat up the dude, she was down under love the rent man 
 So she went to work at Nintendo
