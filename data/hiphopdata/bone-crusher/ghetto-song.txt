 D.S.G.B 
 Y'all know how we do it 
 What's up 
 (Lil Pete) 
 Nigga ghetto for life and I'm Be here forever 
 Thug niggas from these streets and we hustler for cheddar 
 So we can live better and have bigger thangs 
 Blow joke all day and sip on champagne 
 See in this that I call home 
 We slang crack all night till the early mourn 
 First street across the Georgia where I got it on 
 Sticky pants and t-shirts with my fucking stone 
 Mean-mug on my face everyday, home 
 I keep my radio tune to this ghetto song 
 And pray to God that it won't be long before we hit the top 
 I shit blow up nigga and hit the fucking chart 
 A nigga riding 
 (Bone Crusher) 
 Hit the rib shack for a little snack 
 I see this little shawty with the donkey in the back 
 "Only in the hood with ya fineness, just so fine ghetto princess" 
 Why not? My focus is all that I got 
 Shout's out to Goodie Long stay strong Cool Joe 
 We done it we all foe 
 I wish them young niggas would get off the blow 
 But it's like this in every ghetto 
 But I stay strong maybe thers's some hope 
 I like to have fun but life ain't a joke 
 Sometimes I just wanna sit back and smoke
