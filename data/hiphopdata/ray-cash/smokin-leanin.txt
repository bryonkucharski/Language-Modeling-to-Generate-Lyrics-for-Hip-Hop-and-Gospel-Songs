(Feat. Tucan) 
 What you know about smokin' 'n' leanin, tryin' to get paid, tryin' to get paid, tryin' to get paid 
 Well it's your boy Ray Kizzy in the motherfuckin hizzy welcome y'all to the place to be, 
 I just got back yesterday hopped off the plane from Houston out there with Face and Free, 
 But now I'm back in the city with the bop like ditty came to snatch somethin' pretty pimpin' hard, 
 I got a call this morning from my nigga in mansfield shout to niggas doin' time in the yard, 
 Now I'm sittin' here thinkin' wishin I was on my mission with my niggas see he gettin' down raw, 
 But I said fuck it I get duckets from this rap and sat back and thought about it shit I'm the best by far, 
 I guess what I'm sayin' is if this rap ain't workin then I got work pimpin' we can get this bitches twerkin' have the block 
 Doin' her pussy I mean have it poppin' pussy niggas gone get shot down for cock blockin if God's willin' to let me see another 
 Day nigga all I wanna do is get paid, 
 And if a nigga wanna buy then I got folks who supply when you see me nigga fuck with Ray, 
 Well I just can't stop gettin' gettin' paper I think I'm addicted tryin' have my summer whip up on them 24, 
 Inches bitches itchin for me to scratch them kitten 'cause they see the way I'm livin' and my rose gold glow, 
 Chain swangin nuts hangin' niggas on them corners slangin swangin to my music when I open up my dough (door), 
 Action pistol packin got that thang up on my lap before you niggas think you jackin Imma clap and let it blow 
 Nigga smoke somethin', smoke somethin', Ray Cash bout that nigga no frontin, Imma act a real for real or pow hold somethin',
