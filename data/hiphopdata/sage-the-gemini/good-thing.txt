Yeah 
 Uh, and they already know me, S-A-G-E 
 Look, they be speaking on what they don't know 
 They don't know because I keep it low 
 When I go low she tell me "Way to go" 
 I make her act up, when I come back up 
 She says her feelings too strong, make her wanna back up 
 And I respond like "Damn" 
 Believe me when I tell you why I agree 
 (Like damn) An hour later it was gon' be you or me 
 (Like damn) Now I don't wanna let you go 
 But there's something that you gotta know 
 This ain't nothing but dangerous 
 We about to be over it 
 Why can't it just be what it is? 
 Why can't it be what it is? 
 We're both getting emotional 
 Same time getting so sexual 
 Why can't it just be what it is? 
 Why can't it be what it is? 
 I know, you know, we know 
 We can make the good shit keep happening 
 Good shit keep happening 
 I know, you know, we know 
 We can make the good shit keep happening 
 Good shit keep happening 
 I ain't never felt the way you make me feel 
 Continue so I know it's real 
 Think about me like I know you will 
 Fall for me, let it fall for me, give it all to me 
 Stand in the middle of the floor, throw your broad to me 
 This is real, yeah, this is real, let your guard down 
 This is good shit, ain't no time to call it off now 
 (Like damn) Now I don't wanna let you go, but there's something that you gotta know 
 This ain't nothing but dangerous 
 We about to be over it 
 Why can't it just be what it is? 
 Why can't it be what it is? 
 We're both getting emotional 
 Same time getting so sexual 
 Why can't it just be what it is? 
 Why can't it be what it is?
