Nigga where you from, rep that shit (what) 
 Heart, Break, that's that clique (what) 
 I be riding sliding slipping and dipping 
 I'm about money clothes cars and women 
 And that's that 
 Chuck a deuce when you see me in the street nigga 
 Holla at me when you see me in the street nigga 
 Ride around my city like the only one 
 Niggas hating on me I don't understand 
 I'm from Fairfield rep it like the only one 
 Wouldn't waste a bullet on niggas cause this my only gun 
 Pull up 50 cars [?] in the radio 
 Punch a nigga for speaking retarded now he his radio 
 Trigger boy that's a flash like a camera gave you a cameo 
 Your bitch screaming she like the way, I should be sammy uh 
 S-A-G-E mister two hit wonder 
 I hit your bitch two times leave that bitch to wonder 
 A few party songs got a young [?] thunder 
 I got hella cheese waking bitches out they slumber 
 And I can really rap man I swear I could 
 I ain't gotta explain shit I just thought I should 
 And all my niggas carry gym and honor wood 
 Never been scared but I like the fact you thought I should 
 Bitch

 Life, ain't that a bitch

 Said it's Heart Break Gang just me and my homies 
 Pressing you squares no Sony 
 PlayStation haters need a vacations fast 
 Check so big that they can't pay in cash 
 You talk business I talk math 
 Cause nigga all I do is multiply and add 
 Joint so big it look like half 
 My arm all I smoke is gas 
 91 dressing like it's '91 
 Ain't a rapper better then me but I'ma find me one and sign him 
 Only wear designer

 More money blew so I don't stack green 
 Don't fuck with police but we both say freeze 
 You would think your girlfriend on a rock band spree

 All a hater see no snow Auto-Tune 
 Married to the game we are bride and groom

 Thank the lord for the nice things 
 Me and my wrist went to the hood they think I'm ice cream 
 Money sky scrape [?] 
 Too many Jordans think I should join the flight team
