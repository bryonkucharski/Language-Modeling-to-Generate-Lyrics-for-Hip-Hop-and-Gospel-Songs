Now that's what I'm talking 'bout 
 DF to the ASAP Mob 
 Lines, tell them read between it 
 Tripping while I'm slipping, busy fighting off these demons 
 Listen while I'm spitting boy, you probably won't believe it 
 But life is so terrific, tell them pinch me if I'm dreaming 
 Revenue's what I get get, your bitch is what I did hit 
 And I'm bout my business, them pesos what I did get 
 Made a hit, had a fix, they saying you's the shiznit 
 Tell them get off my diznick, you bucket headed bitches 
 Crossing all the lines, time is only racing time 
 He flippin' to the bars so I'm only raising mine 
 Depending on the grind is the only way to shine 
 So I'm feeling like that odds is the only state of mind 
 And it's finna give me peace, life up in these streets 
 Equipped with a piece, case you niggas wanted beef 
 Cause man gave us laws and God gave us time 
 It's the art of storytelling and I'm only telling mine 
 The lines we've crossed, the lines we crossed 
 Have always been why I've lost 
 It changes all the time 
 'Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how) 
 I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life 
 (Talk that talk boy) 
 Straight out of the belly of East Point, yeah that's my origins 
 Was born in West Savannah, Georgia then I was born again 
 Like the baby in the manger 
 I gave my life to Jesus because he could protect me from the dangers 
 In the circle of angels, just to help me shine my halo 
 Attended Sunday school but it felt like it was every day though 
 I didn't have a suit or no fancy shoes, we went in our play clothes 
 Received the word and it moulded me like Play Doh 
 We don't play though, we don't play though 
 They say we get lower than an alligator's navel 
 And when I say gator I mean that gator that match that sable, fur coat 
 I wish that PETA would throw some blood off on my fur, folk 
 Boy, ass whoopin' 
 They out 'chea eating flesh but wanna worry how I'm looking 
 I stay simply fresh to death, Sir Luscious Left Foot, best foot forward 
 You reap what you sow, and now it's showing 
 The lines we've crossed, the lines we crossed 
 Have always been why I've lost 
 It changes all the time 
 'Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how) 
 I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life 
 (Talk that talk boy)
