Hey, Big Boi 
 Kelly 
 Player, player 
 As the world shakes unharmed 
 Twan, calm in the middle of the storm bomb 
 Flow tsunami, ring the alarm 
 Big Boi for dummies come and get some huh, wisdom, 
 Like yo back teeth or get the fuck on, like some bad chi 
 Negative energy not tolerated 
 You all about a dollar and I'm exonerated 
 Freefalling, Tom Petty heartbreaker, living legend, rap scholar, art major 
 'Cause I make major art 
 Like Beethoven, Van Gogh, or Mozart so don't start 
 Around these parts we reign supreme and stay Krispy Kreme clean 
 Blue jeans, Jordans Number 3's, that's important 
 Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me) 
 Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what mama told me) 
 Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me) 
 I always knew I'd be a star (That's what mama told me) 
 Mama used to say take your time 
 Well I'm a pickpocket when I design rhymes 
 Every little step I take like Bob Brown 
 And It's so profound that when I throw those nouns 
 We gon' get low low down until we get back up while everything gravy, taters mashed up 
 You know I keep a full plate 
 And a full thing of hot ones, throw away 38's 
 But everything's straight, Bleed, shit 
 I got everything I can need 
 Me, boy, I'm everything you can't see 
 Like three blind mice, on the chase of some great cheese 
 And Cheddar Man say he got some great trees, say he serve me and my nigga Three G 
 Butt tees, Jordans, number 5, you niggas boring 
 Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me) 
 Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what mama told me) 
 Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me) 
 I always knew I'd be a star (That's what mama told me) 
 'Cause I travel like a rocket, I do 
 Mind riddle every socket for you 
 I sway on the edge of the lightning (Yeah) 
 Magnetic, can't stop 
 Just floating won't drop 
 I slip (I slip) I slide (I slide) 
 Back up the ride 
 I'm skippin' every mountaintop 
 I'm reachin' for the highest high 
 Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me) 
 Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what mama told me) 
 Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me) 
 I always knew I'd be a star (That's what mama told me) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's what mama told me 
 That's what mama told me 
 Mama told me 
 That's what mama told me (Mama told me) 
 Mama told me 
 Auu!
