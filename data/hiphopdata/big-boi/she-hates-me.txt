She said she love me when I'm gone 
 She miss me being home 
 I'm always at the studio that makes her alone 
 Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs 
 Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone 
 Where did we go wrong I'm sitting here thinkin' 
 She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin' 
 Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln 
 Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking 
 I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming 
 It goes both ways and I was trying to get even 
 Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and 
 Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in 
 Came home late I just put the key in 
 It would probably be straight if she was European 
 She's not she's hot and mad as she can be 
 If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me 
 She hates me, I know it I know' 
 She hates me, I know it for sure 
 But I'mma make her love me 
 I'mma make her love me again 
 She hates me, la la la 
 She hates me 
 I mean it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem 
 By the car, while I was thinking "Damn here we go again" 
 We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo 
 Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'mma go? 
 Well let's leave pronto and that's what we did 
 Then we yelled out Geronimo and jumped off that bridge 
 Had a couple kids, you can move where I live 
 I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did 
 The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole 
 Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul 
 I should have a live band preparing for my show 
 But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow 
 Now I know I ain't quite rich, but bitch I ain't broke 
 If she acting like a bitch, I guess we're around white folk 
 Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand 
 But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man 
 She hates me, I know it I know' 
 She hates me, I know it for sure 
 But I'mma make her love me 
 I'mma make her love me again 
 She hates me, la la la 
 She hates me
