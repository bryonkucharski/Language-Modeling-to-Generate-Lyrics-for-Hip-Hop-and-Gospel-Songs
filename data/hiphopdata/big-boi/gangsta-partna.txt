(Featuring Big Boi) 
 Who knows why we won't stop 
 It goes on and on and on... 
 Who knows why we won't stop 
 (Nobody move nobody make a sound) 
 It goes on and on and on... 
 Hey My Partna got this way wit his toungue 
 He told ya boy give me tha money wait right here till I'm done 
 And made bomb 
 When we get ya we gon' floss like stars 
 From buyin outfits to everybody drinks at Charles 
 We got them cars Black Range Rover wit bars 
 Big Beama AMG kit with them stars 
 Bro we hard 
 Like when everybody buck at tha park 
 Them girls be screamin 
 Y'all don't want to make them start 
 When we say Shhhh! 
 They be quiet 
 When we say jump, 
 They say when 
 When I say get out my face don't preach 
 They do it right then 
 It ain't no mystery my partnas know I'm gangsta as Hell 
 Bustin' raps but so first I got some dank ta sell. 
 Four mo bails 
 Three mo blocks two mo owes 
 Ay everybody ridin' gatorbacks and rims got chrome 
 All the cribs got gates and all the Kids wear Nikes 
 And ain't nobody girl trippin' 'cause we'll cut of the lights 
 Lets hit tha club 
 Hate ta be a lamppost 
 This tha night we get it tight and see who clockin the most 
 Just bailed in off them dangerous streets 
 Fresh off a Lick 5 G's a piece 
 Me and my favorite gangsta partna did good this mornin 
 We get love from Decatur 'cause we run this Point 
 It felt good bro runnin' off wit all that dough 
 Man I had that nigga lay it down feel it for sho 
 Suckas flexin 'n' flauntin they gonna buck what they want to 
 When police look we ask 'em what tha fuck they want 
 We some high school drop-outs wit high class jobs 
 Gettin' weight from outta state 
 And tell 'em we got robbed 
 Calhoun Jeans brand new ride pockets fat 
 3 level condos wit a hustle ta match

 Gangsta partna, Boots?Be dirty from all the workThat we put inNigga got 
 Cut up

 Get so fiery from the gentlemen's club and 
 Cheapinin out ya crops

 And You know the (?????) on the camps 
 And SouthernPlayalistic drop 
 But I think I'm gonna catch the crib 
 Gotta get up in the mornin and fix some breakfast for my kid 
 And I did boy sho as my name is Dwayne but it ain't 
 My gangsta partna pulled some young bitches at tha skating rink 
 Don't let them niggas smoke up the dank 
 He said nigga what you thank 
 Your gangsta partna turnin' cake
