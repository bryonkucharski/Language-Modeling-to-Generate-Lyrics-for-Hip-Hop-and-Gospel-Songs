And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 The world is yours as soon as you log on 
 I'm long gone like the dro that's blown in the wind, friend 
 Pretend that this life is but a dream then reality syncs in 
 The fantasy begins and it never ends 
 We like to role play, throw on some Coldplay 
 Go get some drugs and alcohol, fuck our whole day 
 Now we're trapped in the matrix 
 While Big Brother out here making movies, nigga, don't say shit 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 The information age (age) 
 The age of information, but we're still enslave 
 So let me behave like a coon, bring the goons, go out and sell dope 
 That's what they shoving down our throat so I choke 
 And regurgitate truest lyrics I ever wrote, folk 
 My crew is loc'd out without the bandanas 
 Yet we keep it cracking like a egg yolk, nigga, that's Atlanta 
 By way of West Savannah 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 As I scroll through the centrefolds 
 Wishing that the screen was three-dimensional 
 I know it doesn't seem too conventional 
 But it'll do until I get you in the physical 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 The flash memory that I'll hold is all I know of time 
 What was waiting all along is all I have to realize 
 I've got the dial tone 
 The glowing screen, it means we're not alone 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 And it's you that's on my computer screen 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind 
 'Cause it's you that's on my mind
