We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 No introductions needed boy just call me the undefeated (Big) 
 And underneath this Georgia dry I know I can't be seen with (Bigger) 
 Bifocals because my vocals are classic 
 Like Coca-Cola when they had cocaine in the package 
 I meant to say blow in the ingredients 
 I went to the mall today and all the niggas had on smediums 
 Little bitty ass clothes 
 Like Dancing with the Stars without the judges or the dance flo' 
 (Oh) And niggas don't dance no more, all they do is this 
 Beef it up, call me Venus fly trap, waiting on fly emcees to eat 'em up 
 I'm fly as I can be, them weak as fuck 
 And ain't no keeping up, I'm balls deep and them ain't deep enough 
 Fat stacks nigga, Cadillac killer, cataract prescription filler 
 I got my medicinal card from Los Angeles, the city of lost angels 
 A connoisseur of cannabis and from Atlanta bitch 
 We never shop with strangers, no matter what strain they slanging 
 Some of the game rules done changed 
 Niggas is out here talking like a cockatoo to a cop or two 
 Now they watching you and yo mama too, bird's eye view, view 
 We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Uh, I'm getting blowed on the regular 
 Riding and talking dirty on my cellular 
 Playa I got some young girls that'll sell you some 
 And if you my homeboy, she gon' give you some 
 And it's all for the paper but she still gon' come 
 You dipping in the cookie jar and now you're sprung 
 I'll have you tripping like you smoking furl 
 Playa my hoes don't talk, anybody gon' tell yo girl 
 Okay, now niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 'Cause they pussy wasn't hitting and they lip was super sloppy 
 Suck a, duck a mothafucka, rims chop with brains a sloppy 
 Want my money corner pocket, plenty game ho 
 Sop it like a biscuit, King of Diamonds, king of tricking, what's the difference 
 Got it popping like a skillet with some chicken grease in it 
 Country boy, I'm country raised, from the belly to the grave 
 Roll the Benz nobody tripping cause the money already made, Krizzle 
 We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 We gon' fire (Fire, fire, fire) 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip 
 'Nd hater all the time, I got haters in my biz 
 Talking 'bout the trill but don't know what the fuck it is 
 Mothafuckas nowadays are seriously sorry 
 Thinking that the key to life is putting your business on Maury 
 You say you rocking Mauri but that motherfucker Rockport 
 Always talking 'bout you bust it, but your Glock short 
 I know the truth so ain't no need in your lying 
 Bullshit ain't working, ain't no need in your trying 
 Dying to be the nigga that's spied in the telescope 
 Crime with trilla niggas, put iron to ya belly folks 
 Telling them tall tales, fibs, and humdangers 
 Save it for Jerry caught Steve, or Jerry Spranger 
 Buzzing like a bee, tryna stick me with your stanger 
 You can get the middle (What middle?) the finger 
 Stick it in your ass and let it langer 
 No homo and hit the high note like and R&B singer on promo 
 Hold up
