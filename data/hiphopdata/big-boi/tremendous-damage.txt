Sometimes I wonder how I get over 
 The weight of everything is tearing up my sober 
 Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder 
 People telling me be strong like a soldier 
 But I suffer tremendous damage 
 Just make it fade away 
 Just let it fade away 
 Just make it fade away 
 I suffer tremendous damage 
 So many things that I didn't know 
 But still I've seen my dreams come true 
 And now the little kids are watching my videos 
 And telling me "I wanna be you" 
 See, I'm just a man so I ain't scared to fall down 
 No matter what ever I go through 
 I told the man in the mirror keep pushing on 
 But I can't say the same about you 
 Nah nah, nah, I done made it this far 
 And ain't no way I'm gonna turn back 
 I started out with no car 
 And graduated to a Cadillac 
 But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me 
 'Cause we don't worship that 
 But like the Wright brothers, you gotta crash and burn 
 Before you take flight, I know ya heard that 
 Sometimes I wonder how I get over 
 The weight of everything is tearing up my sober 
 Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder 
 People telling me be strong like a soldier 
 But I suffer tremendous damage 
 Just make it fade away 
 Just let it fade away 
 Just make it fade away 
 I suffer tremendous damage 
 February 28th, the day my daddy died 
 Well, not really, his energy passed to the other side 
 And ever since that day I've seen him fade away with my own eyes 
 I never doubted God, the Marine corps they say semper fi 
 My daddy fought in Vietnam 
 This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre 
 Just like this song say 
 I've suffered tremendous damage, got me tougher than a motherfucker 
 And since the days of Player's Ball 
 Y'all thought it was about all these broads and slamming Cadillac doors 
 Now your American idol is just a fraud 
 You kiss a man he's still gonna be a frog (ribbit) 
 A bitter old negro not at all 
 See, I look 26 and still hit your broad 
 Still pitch a ball, hike, pass, shoot, kick and all 
 Practice make perfect and first it was Bamboo now it's Cross 
 Sometimes I wonder how I get over 
 The weight of everything is tearing up my sober 
 Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder 
 People telling me be strong like a soldier 
 But I suffer tremendous damage 
 Just make it fade away 
 Just let it fade away 
 Just make it fade away 
 I suffer tremendous damage
