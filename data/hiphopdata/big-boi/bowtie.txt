 Nasty Noompsy Knightingale fresh in that tuxedo 
 Cumberbun with no suspenders my torpedo, you libido 
 Need to chat 
 (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze) 
 I'm your R O L A I D S, release the squeeze or release the keys 
 To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this 
 Smack on smack on some of this dick Tracy 
 Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker 
 You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor 
 Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream 
 She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things 
 Whatcha mean? 
 (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze) 
 In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I's 
 Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back

 Oh, Lord, how can it be so hard? 
 To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard 
 But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique 
 You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak 
 Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that 
 But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat 
 So why don't I chase this Hennessey down with some of that 
 On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack 
 As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance 
 We look fine, right on time 
 As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play 
 Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door 
 While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor 
 To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need 
 Throw your hands up if you feel me 
 Throw your hands up if you feel me 
 'Cause we well designed and fine as wine 
 Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why 
 I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny 
 So raise your hands to the sky 'cause we super fly 
 Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back 
 Bowtie 'round my neck 
 That's why they call me the gangsta mack 
 In the Cadillac, yeah
