It's funny right? They say things done change 
 No more messages in the music, record sales down, gas prices up 
 No more love in your love, no more love for your love 
 Change is long overdue, Mary, something's gotta give, Big Boi 
 You can trot around the planet or watch it on the news 
 Sombody's getting shot, the weather man's looking confused 
 He's reporting to a nation full of zombies strung out on starbucks 
 And stitched up and bitching Abercrombie 
 Uh, don't get it mixed up me too 
 I have insomnia at times but don't be walkin' 'round here blind 
 Nigga feelin' all around, trying to find a righteous path 
 It's appealin' when I rhyme 
 So every time I hit the masses, you know the common folk 
 Blue collared day to day workers 
 That squeeze a dollar so they baby can swallow 
 A little not a lota just enough to fill that bottle 
 But it's a million dollars a gallon for some gas to get to work 
 Tomorrow that's if you gotta get it, you can't swim in carpool 
 You Rob Peter to pay Paul to make due 
 Make you wanna write a note and take a pistol to that bank too 
 And pass it to the teller but you know better 
 They trying to tell us to stay strong 
 But every day we losing jobs 
 From College Park out to Beverly Hills 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 Across the world they live in fear 
 But it's the same thing over here 
 If you can hear me on Capitol Hill 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 The great debators debate about who's the greatest MC 
 Subject matter don't matter because the verse is empty 
 No food for thought nothing for the brain to digest 
 So I guess it'd be about who can bullshit the best 
 But I give them light on like the traffic I direct 
 Inspiring their life like they was actors on my set 
 As if I was a pilot, take'em higher then a jet 
 I'd be a liar if I wasn't sick and tired of this mess 
 They trying to tell us to stay strong 
 Nut every day we losing jobs 
 (Everyday, everyday) 
 From College Park out to Beverly Hills 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 (Give it up y'all) 
 Across the world they live in fear 
 But it's the same thing over here 
 (Over here, yeah) 
 If you can hear me on Capitol Hill 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 Single mother in a struggle and it's no fun 
 But you don't really understand until you are one 
 A child is sick and is losing he's endurance 
 She want to fix him but she 'ain't got no insurance 
 Now we don't even want to talk about the man's life 
 Out on parol with the promise that he'll do right 
 But a felon has no chance for a new start 
 So it's back to doing hand in hand on his own block 
 And blacks and whites we're all the same and I know you feel my pain 
 And the only hope I have to help me deal with the drama 
 Is that maybe in November I'll be cheering for Obama 
 They trying to tell us to stay strong 
 (Yeah) 
 But everyday we losing jobs 
 (Every day) 
 From College Park out to Beverly Hills 
 (Ooh) 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 (Give it up, give it up) 
 Across the world they live in fear 
 But it's the same thing over here 
 (Over here) 
 If you can hear me on Capitol Hill 
 (Listen to me now) 
 Something's gonna have to give 
 (Give it up y'all) 
 The world is too big 
 Free your mind or be stuck like porcupine left behind 
 That's the bottom line gotta find the grind 
 'Cause the time won't be coming back around, get it now nigga 
 The world is too big 
 Step on the stars while you're reaching for the sun 
 But never burn a bridge, each one, teach one 
 If you lend a helping hand, you may never be one 
 The world is too big 
 And I heard him say that every man, woman 
 And child was gonna be okay 
 I heard him say that they would bring 
 Our soldiers home in one piece today 
 The world is too big but it's not that way 
 They've been selling us a dream telling us 
 We on the same team 
 Now we all gotta deal with the lies 
 They trying to tell us to stay strong 
 (Yeah) 
 But everyday we losing jobs 
 (Every day) 
 From College Park out to Beverly Hills 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 (Have to give) 
 Across the world they live in fear 
 (Oh yeah) 
 But it's the same thing over here 
 (Over here) 
 If you can hear me on Capitol Hill 
 (I know you hear me) 
 Somethin's gonna have to give 
 (Yeah)
