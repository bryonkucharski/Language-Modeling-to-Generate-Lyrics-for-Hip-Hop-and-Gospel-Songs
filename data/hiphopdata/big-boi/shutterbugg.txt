Uh, I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe 
 Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A 
 And I been witness to this history, ever since the 10th grade 
 We went from rockin' braids to temp fades 
 I twist my A hat to the side just for style 
 Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly 
 Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down 
 It ain't so country though, nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle 
 I'm Sergeant Slaughter, I keep my shit cooked to order in order 
 To satisfy my people in Georgia and 'cross the water 
 And across the border the eses are gettin' smarter 
 They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas 
 If you follow, wink wink, no doubt, we don't speak 
 In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink 
 I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat 
 It's that nigga the B-I-G, B-O-I, O-U-T 
 Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug 
 And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs 
 I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup 
 Boy, stop, I'm just playin', let me dap you up 
 Baby, baby, you're in my system 
 Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin' 
 Why, it's after twelve, club like a hive be 
 A beehive cause now everybody buzzing around me 
 Could it be the way that the verse is sounding 
 Came up on the Geto Boys and the Underground Kingz 
 Toys, I had a Brougham, call it “Pretty Brown Thing” 
 Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining 
 Known to keep a bad bitch, no niggas beside me 
 Index finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning 
 Not to flex but to protect my neck like the Wu-Tang 
 Self preservation is the rule when you do aim 
 Or get at something more sinister, you gotta be the finisher 
 Make it so the doctors, they can't replenish him 
 Or bring him back to life, back to reality 
 Go on, get him some hoes, leave it alone 
 Triple OG status, A-town's very own 
 Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug 
 And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs 
 I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup 
 Boy stop, I'm just playin', let me dap you up 
 Baby, baby, you're in my system 
 Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin' 
 Now this goes out to all my playas in the back 
 Sippin' 'ngac, bending round corners in the 'Lac 
 Cut a rug, playa now, cut a rug 
 Throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg 
 (This goes out to all my ladies in the front) 
 What you want, you make me want to breed, girl, freeze 
 Cut a rug, cut a rug 
 (And throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg) 
 Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug 
 And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs 
 I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup 
 Boy stop, I'm just playin', let me dap you up 
 Baby, baby, you're in my system 
 Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin' 
 Tell me you're listenin' 
 Cause you're all up in my system 
 I can feel you from my head to my toes 
 (You're in my system) 
 Luscious Leftfoot got his best foot forward 
 Darling, Lord have mercy 
 How the flow stay so cold, froze 
 (Tell me you're listenin') 
 Cut a rug, cut a rug 
 (You're in my system) 
 Shutterbugg 
 Cut a rug, cut a rug 
 (Tell me you're listenin')
