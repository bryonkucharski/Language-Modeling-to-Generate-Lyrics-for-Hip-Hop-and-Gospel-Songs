I wanna get in higher res 
 I wanna see it on the sick screen 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna put it on the five point one 
 I just want to get it on 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna get in higher res 
 1080p, now what can be clearer when your vision is blurry 
 Well, I say wiping away the steam up off the mirror 
 And bathing in the fog dog 
 She about this lumberjack so she gonna get this log cause 
 I'mma get that thunder cat when I get up under that thang 
 Her natural habitat is a bang bang 
 Surrounded by the jungle, the sea, the tundra 
 B.I.G. stay cooler than the pussy on a penguin in the summer 
 Niggas in slumber, but we running this bitch and never fumbled fumble? 
 Fumble, hot tomato, wake up 
 I wanna get in higher res 
 I wanna see it on the sick screen 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna put it on the five point one 
 I just want to get it on 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna get in higher res 
 Turn on, burn out, it's all about 
 How you wanna give it to me 
 I'm up, online, press send, don't rush 
 I know you wanna get it in 
 I wanna get in higher res 
 I wanna see it on the sick screen 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna put it on the five point one 
 I just want to get it on 
 I wanna get it now anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna get in higher res
