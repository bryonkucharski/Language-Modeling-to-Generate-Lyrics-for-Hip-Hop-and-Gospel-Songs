Gimme one reason why 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Why, you're the apple of my eye 
 In the beginning they say Eve bit it 
 They're still sinning 
 'Cause they letting every Tom Dick and Steve hit it 
 Therefore I'm quick to not believe in it 
 Like the weed with the seeds in it 
 Now proceed like a G pimping 
 And some of the things you've probably seen in your life 
 Made you think a certain kinda way about finding your wife 
 Or your better half, it's better to love and to hold 
 Than to never have it at all and ball on these hoes 
 Make your stock go up, my Apple stock split 
 Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six 
 I'm rich trick and that's in hundos 
 So overseas you might catch us eating Nando's 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Why, you're the apple of my eye 
 Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones 
 They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose 
 Like everybody else they wilding try to find theyself 
 And by the time they do they barely have nobody left over 
 Feeling empty and alone, cause the youth is gone 
 The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told 
 Look in the mirror my dear, and it appears 
 That the eyes are the window to the soul, oh 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Why, you're the apple of my eye 
 I, I need a big bite baby, a big bite baby 
 Of your sweet red delicious love 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Gimme one reason why 
 Why, you're the apple of my eye 
 You're the apple of my eye
