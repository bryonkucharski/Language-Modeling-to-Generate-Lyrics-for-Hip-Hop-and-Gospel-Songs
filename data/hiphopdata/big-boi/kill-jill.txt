(Hatsune Miku sample from Aura Qualic - DATA 2.0) 
 愛してよ　私を 抱いてよ　ねぇ、側においでよ 
 Aisheteyo, watashi wo daite yo ne, soba ni oideyo 
 (Love me, please embrace me, come by to my side) 
 私の　最後の　記憶に 君の愛を　残したい... 
 Watashi no saigo no kioku ni kimi no ai wo nokoshitai 
 (I want to your love to be left off as my last memory) 
 (Killer Mike) 
 Polo to the floor though, you already know doe 
 It's Adamsville forreal, you see it hoe, just take a photo 
 I'm reppin' as I'm fo' door with a fo'-fo' on your bro though 
 Cause that dodo thought that he could rob a player for some dough tho 
 I (pff-pff-pff-pff) oh no, on some Allen Temple 
 On some England manor, I'm so Mysty' Valley 
 And I gotta couple pounds yesterday outta Cali 
 And my bad bitch from the Valley brought me brand new Bally's 
 And I'm playin' with a new American dream, Dusty Rhodes 
 Man, she been ridin' clean since her daddy rode on vogues 
 I done fucked her in every hotelly, every hole 
 I ain't fucked her with my wife, but if she meet her she might be a go 
 Ric Flair, Ric Flair flashy, bitch, don't I look dashin'? 
 Bitch don't I look classy, bitch, don't act so sassy 
 I'm the, I'm the man boo, that's with or without you 
 To hell with what your mouth say, show me what that mouth do 
 (Jeezy) 
 I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress 
 Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it 
 They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever 
 Hey don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch I'm barely flexin' 
 I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this 
 Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it 
 They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever 
 And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever 
 Live forever 
 (Big Boi) 
 Daddy Fat Saxxx with three X's, fuck niggas hit the exit 
 No S is on my chest but all these diamonds got me blessed 
 Usually I don't do this, dumb it down, go stupid 
 Since 17 been countin' M's, my bank account's on Goofy 
 They say Cosby gave 'em roofies, now who knows what the truth is (what?) 
 Chicago's full of shooters, my garage is full of hoopties 
 Got that Southern drawl and all that 
 My pretty rose look like ball-bats 
 The South got somethin' to say 
 And all y'all niggas can't get y'all ball back 
 If I ain't a hot boy then what it is, call Sax 
 Daddy Fat in it y'all, never fall back 
 Like clocks in the wintertime 
 We stay eating like it's dinnertime 
 Been feasting and chiefing and blowing big 
 But it ain't no reefer round 
 We don't know the meaning of drought 
 Cause we keep it so wet, boy swear now it's been a while 
 Just speaking in general 
 While there is no formidable 
 Opponent or/and nigga that want it 
 Pure uncut, never step on it 
 Line for line, dope when you want it 
 Mine the kind to give a nigga hope 
 When they down and out 
 Nigga dig a hole so deep, ain't no climbin' out 
 (Jeezy) 
 I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress

 And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever 
 Live forever
