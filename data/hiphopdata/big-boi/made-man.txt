Kurupt 
 It's nothing but murder my nigga, you hear me? 
 Big Boi 
 Get mad when a nigga wanna take that knee 
 But they clap when he catch that ball 
 These cats nowadays straight pussy I see 
 They scrap but ain't got no paws 
 Law break an oath, take his jaw 
 The biggest liars of them all 
 I set fire in the mind and the hearts of the men 
 That wanna clap but it pop off 
 No excuses, all applause, revolution, all the soft 
 Restitution ain't solution for the lives that have been lost 
 By the time you hear this song 
 There'll be plenty niggas gone 
 Talkin' 'bout six feet under grass 
 While the killers be at home 
 Now my dealers keep that chrome 
 And my pimp niggas keep them hoes 
 I'm gon' keep on pushin' this pen 
 I don't write on no iPhone 
 Alright, alright, I'm old-fashioned 
 But my style cannot be cloned 
 Timeless classics on you bastards 
 Jedi rap shit all day long 
 Renegade El Rey 
 If you lookin' for the real 
 You know exactly who to come and get 
 Watch how you approach me homie 
 Miss me with that sucker shit 
 Hangin' out the window 
 Like I'm Malcolm with the yopper 
 If I said it then I meant it 
 Ain't apologizing partner 
 That's some real shit 
 They say they lookin' for the real 
 Said the music lacking feeling 
 Well this is somethin' they can feel 
 Killer Mike 
 Rollin' in the coupe, jammin' Dre and Snoop 
 Niggas know that I'm movin' through the hood 
 In my, in my, in my hoopty-hoop 
 Fuck around nigga, I might shoot 
 Get your ass spint the fuck around like a Hula-hoop 
 I play the block in a foolish coupe 
 Ooh, tell 'em, fella; ooh, tell 'em, fella 
 Them pussy niggas are hella jealous 
 They hella yellow, they hella yellow 
 They talkin' tough but they Mellow Yellow 
 You catch 'em slippin', what's happenin', fella? 
 Watch they ass go Helen Keller 
 Can't hear, can't see, can't tell a fella 
 Lord have mercy, I done prayed 
 So many days for y'all to try 
 I've been waitin' to buy ya flowers 
 Send 'em to your mama, let her cry 
 I bought a new AK today 
 And I'm so happy (I'm so happy) 
 I might bust it on you bustas here in traffic 
 Kurupt 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 I'm terrible 
 Words that I spill 
 Will lift niggas out of graves while I kill at will 
 Frozen like ice cubes, chipped like bricks 
 Two to your chest, five to your hip 
 .30 to your homies, everybody left 
 I understand exactly why he shouldn't fuck with us 
 I looked at the homies, like anybody else 
 Fuck saving ya homie nigga, you need to save yourself 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Made man, nobody being me 
 Let me say somethin' 
 When you was growin' up 
 And yo grandmama had plastic on the couch 
 I know all y'alls grandmamas had plastic on the couch 
 You know why y'alls grandmamas had plastic on the couch? 
 Because your grandmama was a squirter
