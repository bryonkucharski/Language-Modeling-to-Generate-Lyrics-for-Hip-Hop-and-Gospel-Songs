I used to be in lust, I wouldn't call it love 
 Or give my heart away, that's somethin' that I never does 
 See I'ma leave it to the scrubs and the cake boss 
 Let that broad go, uncuff her, take your cape off 
 When she with me, she feel free, like her days off 
 Balls in her hand, but that bitch don't ever say cough 
 'Less we playin' doctor 
 With no stethoscope, just heels and those knockers yeah 
 I'm mister wrong but she sure know not to 
 Get fly at the mouth, or step outta pocket 
 Never violence, I give 'em silence 
 Then I'll rub this stick on your chick like a violin 
 Les françaises ont peint le portrait de celui qu'on appelle 
 Au États-Unis, le mec au portefeuille remplis 
 Et nous réclamons qu'il soit mis à sa place, au Louvre 
 It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside 
 You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why 
 I'm Daddy Fat Saxxx, S-A triple X 
 My music sounds so good it's almost like we're having sex 
 Whether you like it or not I'm next 
 And I got the time after that, and the time after that 
 Because see time and time again I gotta turn back around and tell 'em 
 My cerebellum, get way more deeper than these other fellas 
 Not only about cheddar 
 But what about the seasons never change and the weather stays the same 
 We could come together but that might be lame, could learn something 
 Peep game, nah nigga burn somethin' 
 (Nah nigga burn somethin') 
 (Nah nigga burn somethin') 
 It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside 
 You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why 
 I ask for a slice of her pie 
 Sweet potato with the cool whip, oh my 
 She gave me a hug and on her thigh she felt my buddy 
 From touching I'm excited 
 Am I invited 
 Let let me in 
 You puddled up 
 Gon' me swim 
 It's all you want these days, cause you feel nothing inside 
 You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why 
 I read the horoscope, and it's been telling me lies 
 I thought I knew you but your heart is almost blind 
 I thought I knew you but your heart is blind 
 I thought I knew you but your heart is almost blind 
 I thought I knew you but your heart is blind
