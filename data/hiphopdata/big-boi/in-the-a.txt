 Ain't lost a step, but some of y'all niggas flaw to death 
 Since Player's Ball, I was called the best 
 And now they only call me Daddy Fat Sax 
 The Cadillac-a with the diamond in the back

 Brand new again, never get old 
 When I was little, boy they said I had a old soul 
 Old gold

 Got them racks, slanging them packs and no we can't leave them sacks alone 
 Hired an assistant cause my weed need a chaperone 
 (Luda!) And then Big Boi will pass the lighter 
 I'm convinced that we started the California brush fires 
 One, two, and it don't stop, so many whips at my crib 
 Ya chick came, the bitch thought it was a road block 
 Spending cash so fast, you'd think I'm foolish 
 And I love chicks with ass so it arch like St. Louis 
 Got chicks hugging my nuts like a speedo 
 'Cause when I'm on the mic, I go for broke like T.O 
 But we know I'm rich and pay the bills at my mother house 
 Atlanta cribs jealous 'cause I'm chilling at my other house 
 Yeah you may be able to out-trap me 
 But none of you niggas will ever out-rap me

 They stay out all night on the basketball court 
 Practising, and practising their jump shot 
 Practising their hook-shot 
 And practising and practising, and then they're qualified for the majors 
 Well why can't you stay up all night practising your multiplication 
 Practising your Chemistry, practising your Physics 
 Why can't you stay up practising that? 
 If practice makes perfect, then why do you just specialize in fun things 
 And not in the things that require effort, commitment, and sacrifice
