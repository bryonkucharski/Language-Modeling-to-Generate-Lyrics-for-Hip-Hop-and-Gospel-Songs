Shoes for running, and I'll race ya 
 Sun is coming, it'll chase ya 
 Through this dead beat town 
 Through this dead beat town 
 The end is coming, I would race ya 
 But there's no running, it'll chase ya 
 Death will hunt you down 
 Death will hunt you down 
 What about the people that's barefoot 
 With no shoes for running when the sun come up? 
 Hey one percenters, the 99 say what you gonna do for us? 
 We'll run up in your house like the first runner up 
 Be the first one to buck and the last one to get laid down, stay down 
 And now we're looking at the top of the pile 
 Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off 
 Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft 
 Bubblegum, just popping off 
 At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes 
 Got all the dough and all the women 
 Boy, what you gon' do in the penitentiary 
 Got a lot of money, can't take it with me 
 I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me 
 To the moon and back with a cure for cancer 
 And save the lives of my great grand-mama and my great gran-daddy 
 Now that's the answer to the question 
 But they make money of the medicine 
 Leaving us all stuck in elections 
 With no progressions, just recessions 
 Shoes for running, and I'll race ya 
 Sun is coming, it'll chase ya 
 Through this dead beat town 
 Through this dead beat town 
 The end is coming, I would race ya 
 But there's no running, it'll chase ya 
 Death will hunt you down 
 Death will hunt you down 
 Just as I expected, life gets deadly 
 It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded 
 The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it 
 So my niggas will draw when shit gets sketchy 
 That's a masterpiece, a work of art 
 A gallery, not photo-shop 
 Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk 
 Even in your local talk, niggas say you know he boss 
 Every time my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk 
 That's why she give me geek till her shins weak 
 I'm blazing everyday, you can call that demp week 
 You're running from your life that you didn't see 
 That's like playing hide and seek with the Grim Reaper 
 Shoes for running, and I'll race ya 
 Sun is coming, it'll chase ya 
 Through this dead beat town 
 Through this dead beat town 
 The end is coming, I would race ya 
 But there's no running, it'll chase ya 
 Death will hunt you down 
 Death will hunt you down 
 You can run, but you can't hide 
 Spent your whole life trying to escape 
 When everybody stayed 
 Getting tired of living in a lie 
 Different nights, same town 
 Say goodbyes, but we tried 
 'Cause we know there's no getting out 
 And when the pawns are playing themselves 
 I just lay and wait and straighten myself 
 ? To the rhythm sells out 
 Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth 
 Shoes for running, and I'll race ya 
 Sun is coming, it'll chase ya 
 Through this dead beat town 
 Through this dead beat town 
 The end is coming, I would race ya 
 But there's no running, it'll chase ya 
 Death will hunt you down 
 Death will hunt you down 
 You can fight and try to get away 
 But there's no way to run and hide to 
 You better know that there will come a day 
 Eventually it's gonna find you
