You don't have to go home 
 One time, one time 
 Easy, that cook shit got me sleepy 
 Rollin' down 85, leaning but I ain't weaving 
 Man, you should stay a day in the A 
 A parade of them Chevelots, colors of flavor aid 
 Can you, believe I got it made 
 Impala in the garage, got forces and all the J's 
 I'm leaning bad, ride shotgun in the Chevy 
 With the homeboy burning sacs 
 We heading to the spot where we get down 
 Where the bitches at, they talking right, acting right 
 Walking right, now to take flight, they ain't gotta go home 
 They can stay the night 
 You don't have to go home 
 You can stay right here, put one in the air 
 While we are in the, corners of my chrome 
 Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere, wait a while 
 Nigga hold up, hold up 
 Make sure they see you when you roll 
 Hop out that truck all ready fucked up 
 Tore up from the motherfucking floor up 
 From the floor up, to the ceiling 
 Smoke kiss in the walls in the top of the building 
 Little momma's on [unverified], sitting next to me 
 She's catching a feeling and I'm feeling, like I'm 'pose to 
 I'm as fly as a Jordon poster, I'm leaning hair breathe 
 Smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic by the the time 
 My click find me in VIP I'm lost in a cloud of chronic had sex 
 With the best, got head from the rest, motherfucker believe I done it 
 You don't have to go home 
 You can stay right here, put one in the air 
 While we are in the, corners of my chrome 
 Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere, wait a while 
 Hot tub tony sucka free and still bublin' 
 Truck still rattling and bumping now move something 
 Hold up Big Boi, I'm still weed crumpling 
 Sac keeps shaking and block keep jumping 
 Lay back, lay back, treat this eight six cut like a Maybac 
 Hey, show these suckas that after 50 million sold 
 Daddy fat sacs is still where the hood at, hood at 
 Hood rats and decoy be-boys understood that 
 Wheater its creme de la creme, where the good at 
 I got it in that 1.5, I had to put the swisher down 
 'Cause my lugs got tired, now let's ride, let's ride 
 Back down 85, five 
 With the click in the truck 
 Full of chick in the back of the 6 
 Nobody going home tonight
