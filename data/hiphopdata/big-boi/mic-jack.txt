(Big Boi) 
 Niggas still ain't fuckin' with Hollywood Court 
 'Cause they fuckin' wit' ya boi like the Hollywood dough 
 Everything big, no comin' up short 
 Jack the buzzer beater up, all net, half court 
 The game winning shot, your name sayin', not 
 That same skinny thot you got, she be in and out 
 She never spit it out either, we call her Poke-mouth 
 Big mouth bass, start to smash that ass 
 I build a bear before I build a bitch 
 I take her to the mall and fill her with the sugar dick 
 With the same lips give a nigga sugar whits 
 Give me brain, so intelligent with plenty sense 
 I took her innocence, yeah she was turnt out 
 And by the time I gave her back she was burnt out 
 Like the tires on the Huracan, you ain't good Antwan 
 Or better yet, stay great, we stay puttin' on 
 (Adam Levine) 
 You're hotter than July (super hot) 
 Super colder than December (so cold) 
 You got me dancin' 
 The dancefloor tells no lies 
 Give them something to remember 
 You got me dancin' 
 Please don't stop movin' your feet 
 While the music's hot on that ecstacy 
 We can dance all night, till we both get weak 
 Come on, come on 
 (Big Boi) 
 Stayin' fresh that's the gameplan 
 Out the oven 'cause we never microwavin' 
 We break it up like the smile of Michael Strahan 
 And keep shinin' like the glove on Michael J hand 
 I do not play man, sure I'll eat your ass up quick 
 I'm on that boss rap shit, they on that toss salad 
 Old chick, I sees ya nigga and I delete her 
 I used to have a bench full of bitches but didn't need 'em 
 But still fill arenas and killin' the coliseum 
 ATLiens, they on top of ya human beings 
 From the mothership, I'm on some other shit 
 Lowkey like the blow soul back in '86 
 But we don't sell dope, we pimp ink pens 
 To provoke the folks and keep 'em thinkin' 
 What is you drinkin', or better yet 
 Do you really know the meaning of life or are you sleeping 
 (Adam Levine) 
 You're hotter than July (super hot) 
 Super colder than December (so cold) 
 You got me dancin' 
 The dancefloor tells no lies 
 Give them something to remember 
 You got me dancin' 
 You're hotter than July (super hot) 
 Super colder than December (so cold) 
 You got me dancin' 
 The dancefloor tells no lies 
 Give them something to remember 
 You got me dancin' 
 Please don't stop movin' your feet (you got me dancin') 
 We can dance all night, till we both get weak, come on 
 (You got me dancin') 
 Morning, we don't stop till the morning 
 We don't stop, keep it going 
 We gonna see it through 
 And the rest is up to you
