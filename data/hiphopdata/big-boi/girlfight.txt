 There she goes talkin' her mess 
 All around town 
 Making me stress 
 I need to get this off my chest 
 And if her friend want some then she'll be next 
 It really ain't that complicated 
 Y'all walking 'round looking all frustrated 
 Want some plates come on let's make it 
 Actin' real hard but I know y'all fakin' 
 I wasn't really the one who startin' this 
 Really don't know why you're talkin' shit 
 You're about to catch one right in your lip 
 It's about to be a what, girl fight! 
 We're on our way to the neighborhood 
 The reason why we comin' is understood

 We're down the ride 
 Steppin' your hair's pulled up and your girls outside 
 Don't be tryna call your cousin on me 
 Don't forget that I got some wit me 
 Bout to go real far bout to swang dem thangs 
 Bout to el elbows all in your grain 
 I wasn't really the one who startin' this 
 Really don't know why you're talkin' shit 
 You're about to catch one right in your lip 
 It's about to be a what, girl fight! 
 Oh snap these bitches they act like cats 
 In the middle of the dance floor now they're preparing to scrap 
 They're takin' out their scrunchies and they're pullin' off their press-ons 
 The one on the right is the girlfriend (What) 
 And the one on the left is the other woman 
 Someone please call the security these girls too purty 
 To get down to the nitty titty 
 I mean the nitty gritty 
 I mean her titties pretty 
 I'm trippin' bein' silly willy man
