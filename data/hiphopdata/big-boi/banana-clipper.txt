I move with the elegance of an African elephant 
 I presented the evidence 
 Eloquent as the president 
 Evident is the emphasis 
 I deserve me a championship 
 But before I banana clip 
 I'mma chill so my man can rip 
 Little man against Hellion 
 With the heart of an orphan 
 I got the words of a murderer 
 And an eye for distortion 
 You take a slice of my portion 
 I'll take a piece of your profit 
 I drive at illegal speeds 
 Keep an oz in my pocket 
 We run the jewels in your town 
 A quarter pound on my person 
 I'm known for pounding the stage 
 I'm talking burning and cursing 
 Producer gave me a beat 
 Said it's the beat of the year 
 I said El-P didn't do it 
 So get the fuck outta here 
 You wanna hang, bring your throat 
 I got stools and a rope 
 I'mma slang pope 
 Haranguing the land with a man's flow 
 A new edition to the art of the old code 
 That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome 
 Ay El 
 We the villains, we antagonist bad guys 
 Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes 
 It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader 
 I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her 
 So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect 
 Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck 
 Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce 
 Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort 
 Lil' nigga!" 
 The style is 
 Radiation leak at Mile Island 
 Also known as Chernobyl talk 
 Listen for the sirens 
 For the green I'm a hoarder 
 You're the poor distorter 
 Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers 
 I'm bored 
 Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure 
 You suck a good dick for the fame 
 And couldn't resist getting played 
 I fuck like I'm headed to war 
 I'm really not playing no games 
 But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name 
 Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat 
 I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet 
 If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet 
 I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth 
 Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap 
 Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet 
 I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter 
 Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys 
 Next time do better 
 Bitch 
 We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city 
 Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me 
 Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons 
 Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing 
 But what I be rhyming, no payola is required 
 My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet 
 Nigga your lease is up, you're fired 
 Quiet, that's how the boss talk 
 Retain ownership on everything, every car bought 
 And paid for, no neighbors 'cause I'm sitting on acres 
 Went to Vegas, jumped the broom 'cause I wasn't trippin' on papers 
 Or no prenuptual agreement for mama 
 If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas 
 Eight figures nigga
