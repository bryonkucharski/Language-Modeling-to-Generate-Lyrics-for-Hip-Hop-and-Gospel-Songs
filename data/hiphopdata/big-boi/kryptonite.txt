I be on it all night, man I be on it (day day) 
 All day, straight up pimp 
 If you want me, you can find me in the A! 
 AYE!(I'm on it) Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell these hoes 
 That I am the H-N-I-C, bitch that's just the way it goes 
 I be on that shit that'll have you on that "I don't want no mo'" 
 At this time, I need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo' 
 If you came to rep your set, right now nigga, let 'em know 
 If it's jail I get for stompin' a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go 
 Freak, I'll be off in the wheep 
 Straight geeked swerving down your street 
 In a stolen Bonneville with 23's on the feet 
 The Legend, Rocky D Brown, back in town to plea you down 
 Give me face, I love the sound 
 Slap the taste, they hit the ground 
 Back in the A 
 Cliqued up, picked up with some people that don't play 
 On that Kryptonite stay 
 So high, we might fly awwway 
 I be on that Kryptonite 
 Straight up on that Kryptonite 
 I be on that, straight up on that 
 I be on that Kryptonite 
 I-I-I-I-I be on it all night, man I be on it (day day) 
 All day, straight up pimp 
 If you want me, you can find me in the... 
 AYE, (I'm on it) Whoo! 
 AYE, (I'm on it) I'm on that Kryp, tonight (I'm on it, I'm on it) 
 I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it) 
 I'm on that Kryp, tonight (I'm on it, I'm on it) 
 I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it) 
 Time and time again, I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes 
 I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we slang that blow 
 Get dope on a daily basis 
 Get high, make them ugly faces 
 Toke the 'dro, and I'm on probation 
 My blunts I don't be lacing 
 I'm on that Kryptonite 
 Come to my crib tonight 
 Let me beat that puss all night 
 Run tell your buddies I fucked you right 
 Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall 
 Tell 'em how you licked my balls 
 Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets 
 Big Boi, he put us on 
 Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Rd., Dixie Hills 
 Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels 
 Grind Time rap game, remember bitches Killer Kill 
 Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp 
 Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell C-Bone 
 Grab that cologne on out my book bag, I smell 'dro all on you, homes 
 Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folks gon' trip 
 Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff (Arf, arf!) 
 Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry 
 So may we be on our merry way? 
 'Cause you just ain't gon find no yay 
 Play, I got a tough team of attorneys 
 Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy 
 They play dur-ty, he cain't touch me 
 Verdict be not guilty, search me 
 Boy stoooppp hahahaha
