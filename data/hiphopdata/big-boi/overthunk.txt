Eric Bellinger: 
 If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be 
 I can't ask nobody nothin', really who know more than me? 
 Really who seen more than me? 
 Really who make more than me? 
 I'm just overthinking now 
 They know who I am and they all got love for me 
 Kept it gangsta for forever, just call that my energy 
 I'm just overthinking now 
 Goin' back and forth and back 
 Goin' back and forth for what 
 Conversations with myself 
 Overthinking is a drug 
 Big Boi: 
 And I'm overdosing, train off the tracks, locomotion 
 My way, big, spans like the ocean 
 Peace be still, ain't no commotion 
 Hocus pocus, watch them jokers 
 Keep my focus, till the locusts 
 Swarm, no harm done 
 'Twan, calm in the middle of the storm 
 I'm in the eye, also a pupil 
 Of the game, but don't stay neutral 
 Follow trends, now that's what you do 
 Jedi Master, they that booboo 
 Here that new new, Claimin' True to 
 Never fake, authenticate who 
 Fuck a password, hack the hackers 
 Back to the future, never backwards 
 Average bashers, new dimensions 
 Middle classers, losing pensions 
 Higher taxes, rules for women 
 Lower learning, lose the children 
 Lose the feeling 
 Trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me 
 I said, trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me

 Big Boi: 
 Old school players to new school fools 
 But new niggas play without no rules 
 It's true when I say that I don't lose 
 The crew been on flame since Tri High School 
 Barbecue lit, light the coal 
 Tiptoein' through the two lips on swoll 
 Bold, cold, sometimes throwed 
 Only when I'm in Texas on Vogues 
 Candy paint, swangers swangin' 
 How these entertainers bangin'? 
 Cut the grass, kill the snakes 
 Fuck the past, fulfill your fate 
 'Cause hate don't make the day go great 
 Them folk gon' think what they gon' think 
 Just float yo' brain as your think tank 
 Attack like shark, don't take the bait 
 Octopuses spill the ink 
 Pop that pussy, kill the beat 
 Still a freak of nature when this ballpoint hit this paper 
 Boomeranging, 'cause I'm... 
 Trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me 
 I said I'm trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me
