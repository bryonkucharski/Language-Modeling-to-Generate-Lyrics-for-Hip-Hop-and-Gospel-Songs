Marky Mark intro: 
 Ha, yeah. I know what you're all thinking 
 That this is some old Janet Jackson type of @#! 
 But it ain't about that 
 This if the real, the street life trauma 
 Yo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts 
 Lived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid 
 Did some #@! that he never shoulda did 
 Had to learn the hard way 
 That some day you gotta pay 
 So what the hey, I say 
 Prince Ital Joe: 
 Life in the streets ain't easy 
 All I see is pain and misery 
 I kneel and pray for the betrayed 
 Strength and protection to survive in the society 
 This is the life in the streets 
 And that's how we live it 
 Marky Mark: 
 Hard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme 
 Out scheming for the green 
 Quick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill 
 I cut ya throat for your goose-down coat 
 'Cause statistic show that kids with no dough 
 Ain't got no chance, got nowhere to go 
 That's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat 
 It'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete 
 Prince Ital Joe: 
 Life in the streets is a mystery 
 Don't know my friends from my enemies 
 Up to lot, could be trouble 
 But I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight 
 This one is dedicated to all the homeless people 
 To every youth that's growin' up on the streets 
 You know, we're living for a dream one day 
 That there'll be no more homeless people in the world 
 Life in the streets is not easy
