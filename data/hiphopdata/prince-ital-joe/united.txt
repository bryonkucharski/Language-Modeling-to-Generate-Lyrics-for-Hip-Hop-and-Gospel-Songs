Maybe one day we'll be united 
 And our love won't be divided 
 If love was a thing 
 That me say money could buy 
 The rich man would live 
 And me say the poor man would die 
 If freedom was thing 
 That they would keep upon earth 
 Happiness would be abundant 
 Unity would give birth 
 For a hungry nation 
 Yes you get a hungry people 
 That is mentally cripple 
 And a kind a always hope 
 Gundshi a fight in a South Africa 
 And the youth them a suffer in Dominican 
 Peace, I got a plea calling 
 I see too many kids simply falling 
 In the streets, it's trife a waste 
 Of a life either you die by the bullet 
 Or struck by a knife 
 But yo it ain't the way to go 
 You can't kill the next man 
 Just to get the doe 
 We gotta fight tonight 
 But we gotta fight right 
 Can't fight for the doe 
 We gotta fight to unit 
 In America the problem take over 
 Robber, shot 
 Robber shot down in Kingston Jamaica 
 Me not joke 
 Me not play, me not get stop 
 Respect Abubaka, respect Mandela 
 Bob Marley tell the dread rasta world 
 Stevie Wonder 
 If you live by the gun 
 And you well well bit by the fun 
 And when ja ja guy come 
 The babylon them have to run 
 We need o-n-e, l-o-v-e 
 U-n-i-t-y before we all die 
 But you don't listen 
 You don't understand still kickin' 
 The bullshit tryin' to be the man 
 Well you want to go and do old piece 
 You gotta to get the man 
 With the cop and an education 
 To rebuild the nation
