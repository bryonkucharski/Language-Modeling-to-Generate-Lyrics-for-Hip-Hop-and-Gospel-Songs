Take a piece of America back 
 It's called truth 
 We the last of the vintage flowers, we carry it on our shoulders 
 I keep my friends close and the devils a lot closer 
 When the Freedom Riders approach them, their appetite is vulturous 
 Soldiers of fortune ain't never no match for soldiers of culture 
 My flow is so fucking honest, you said you wanted to hear it 
 You're lying, cause all you wanted was for me to lift up your spirits 
 The truth is too fucking ugly and trust me the shit got layers 
 You touch me, you think you tough, leave you toothless as rugby players 
 From sufis to soothsayers discussing the true saviours 
 We move with the gangstas 
 You niggas sweeter than the fruit flavors, the booth slayer 
 Proving it's futile to hide from us 
 You misguided as missiles so a suicide bombers 
 Taking orders from the mullah and waiting for karma to pull up 
 Their stones are no match for bullets, Israeli rachets are fuller 
 Gotta race to meet Allah like they chasing them with a cop car 
 Like there's honor in being a martyr and a terrorist is a rockstar 
 Dodging the Abu Dhabi or dodging the paparazzi 
 Still probably as popular as Swastikas for nazis 
 The cops protect the property properly when they crack your heads 
 Murderers get as cocky as Perseus when the kraken dead 
 I wonder what be running through these crackers' heads 
 So my niggas is spilling more blood than 
 Cincinnati caps, black and red 
 I'll take an Actifed, go back to bed, allergic to the fumes 
 Having a funeral for the news cause the facts is dead 
 The trust is gone from the neocons to Barrack Obama 
 America eats its young from Casey Anthony to the Octomom 
 Fix it and mix it up, like martial Law for the Octagon 
 I spit the fire till it burn down Babylon 
 Take a piece of America back 
 You will learn 
 It's called truth 
 Death by suicide bomb, protestants, Bibles, a Koran, or Islam 
 From Genghis Khan to Vietnam I can smell the napalm 
 Rape victims, ripped stockings 
 Redneck clan members doing church bombings 
 Innocent fetus' being aborted with no options 
 Human governments ruin 'em 
 Worrying what weapons could be used to be nukin' 'em 
 Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem 
 Slaves treated like property, to Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima to Nagasaki 
 Adolf Hitler, to every murderous Nazi 
 To the Gambinos, to the Gottis, to every mafia atrocity 
 Child pornography, babies starving and dying in poverty 
 Serbians fighting Croatians in Yugoslavia 
 Muslim women being raped, up to 40,000 in the war in Bosnia 
 The 50 million killed in the second World War 
 The government's poisoning the minds and the bodies 
 Of the babies that are born poor 
 Airplanes blown up by Islamic extremists 
 In religion there's always drama 
 Whether worshipping the Prophet Mohammed or Jesus 
 Small pox to Napoleon's troops dying from typhus 
 From the Spanish flu to the black plague, today its AIDS virus 
 Bodies in coffins, political extortions 
 Racist mobs murdering, Willie Turks, Michael Griffith and Yusef Hawkins 
 Check the murder rate, is it human nature to murder and hate? 
 The Catholic church claimed women were witches andburned 'em at the stake 
 Pedophile predators attacking 
 .38 Beretta used by Gandhi's assassin 
 16 bullets in Malcolm, it happened uptown Manhattan 
 And the homicide, Reagan '80s epidemic of crack 
 And soldiers in action dying in Iraq and never coming back 
 And now let's 
 Take a piece of America back 
 You will learn 
 It's called truth 
 It's called truth 
 You will learn 
 It's called truth 
 It's called truth
