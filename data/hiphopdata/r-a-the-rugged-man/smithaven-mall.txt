This ugly motherfucker in the mirror (this fuckin' mirror) 
 Punch a hole through this mirror (what am I supposed to do?) 
 This faggot in the mirror (can't deal with this breathin shit) 
 I hate this breathin shit (life is fucked up) 
 Yo yo yo 
 I can't believe the way I'm feelin' 
 I wake up still poor plus the pain that exists ain't never healin 
 (Day by day) day by day goes by time is wasted 
 My situation make me want to take a permanent vacation 
 I'd die for my pride plus I'm tired 
 I got no more respect left for the people in the past that I admired 
 (I'm not shit) I'm not shit (I'm not shit) 
 I won't be shit (I won't be shit) 
 I eat shit; I cut my veins and then I bleed shit 
 Plus kid, no man can be trusted 
 I lusted for the spare custard 
 I see the mirror close, fist got busted 
 I get no bitches 'cause I'm broke 
 The last bitch I had fucked my crew and tried to play me like a joke 
 It's gettin' closer to my big hour 
 I bought my first gun at six hour 
 Y'all know it's the only way to get power 
 But I ain't shit 
 Even with this gat I ain't shit (I ain't shit) 
 Ten years down the line the same shit (I ain't shit) 
 I blame myself but at the same time blame society 
 If yo ass don't know me then yo ass shouldn't be tryin' me 
 Put the stick in my pants and grabbed the switchblade 
 That I got from my man the Harley Davidson rider 
 Better known as One-Eyed-Jake the Suffolk County biker 
 (I can't deal with this shit no more yo, oh man) 
 I start to feel the shit 
 I see this clique they think they ill as shit 
 But they won't think they ill when I start killin' shit 
 Hey na na na now (x4) 
 Now let's get back to business 
 Witness the finish, shit is menace 
 Being broke make motherfuckers turn to sinners 
 I go to Smithaven Mall to see if anybody wants some 
 Anybody want some? But this is gonna cost em 
 I walk in the sneaker store 
 My ass is about to get raw 
 Look at my watch it's a quarter past four 
 My mind's blank, flippin, shittin 
 This the dead zone 
 I see this Spanish kid listenin to reggae on his headphones 
 I grabbed him, snatched him backwards 
 Smacked him, he tried to react is when I was tempted to put a cap in him 
 But I didn't, I figured it was best if he was livin' 
 Pulled the stick out everyone inside the store started shittin 
 I made everybody in the spot get down on they fours 
 I made a 300 pound woman strip down to her drawers 
 It was sickenin, I couldn't believe what I was doin' 
 My life is ruined at the age of 22 
 And it's for real, tryin' to find the spot the safe is 
 Cannot escape this, I'm scared to be in jail with all the rapists 
 I tried to rule the world but I blew it 
 I gave the fat naked bitch the gun to kill me, she wouldn't do it 
 So I took the gun back and beat her down 
 I gotta find a place to creep now (I gotta be out) 
 Yo, yo 
 This where my shit stops 
 I turned around, surrounded by six cops 
 Put the clip in my stick got six shots 
 They made my skull almost cave in for misbehavin 
 It's 'cause I chickened out and threw the gun down and gave in 
 I had no respect on the outside 
 But now I got less respect on the inside (inside) 
 I tried to rule the world but I blew it 
 Wishin I was dead but I still don't got the guts to do it 
 Hey na na na now (x4)
