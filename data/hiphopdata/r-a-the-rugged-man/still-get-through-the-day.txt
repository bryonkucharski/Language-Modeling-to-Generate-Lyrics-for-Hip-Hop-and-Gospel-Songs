Little ones listen, learn from me, see, you could be the best 
 But sit in your room depressed and you'll never progress 
 My sister Dee-Dee was born mentally retarded 
 She was a beautiful woman at 26, but now she's dearly departed 
 This May Tenth she suffered from a heart attack 
 The depletion of oxygen in the head left her in a coma braindead 
 Her internal organs was failing, her body no longer releasing excreations 
 My parents wouldn't pull the plug 'cause she was still breathing 
 Black, white, let's unite us, never divide us 
 X-Clan, Professor X died from spinal meningitis 
 So many like us are in Riker's suffering, struggling, slumming 
 A few years ago you was sucking your thumb 
 And now you're busting your gun 
 And dumbing, an innocent man is done 
 And enough of your bluffing, your thugging 
 And enough of the ruckus running, the roughest is coming 
 It's a miracle just being born 
 Learn to enjoy life, it ain't that long 
 Sing the words to my song, come on 
 Wake up, don't cry 
 So sad inside 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway 
 Wanna give up, feel like hiding 
 Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway 
 Away, away 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway 
 Living ain't a breeze, please, life's full of tragedies 
 We see our friends die, some get murdered, some die by disease 
 Got your finger on the trigger, don't do it 
 Contemplating suicide, just put the gun down, we've all been through it 
 An infant in his crib sprayed by straight bullets and dies 
 He was a future genius, he would have won a Pulitzer prize 
 The racist cop shot an innocent black 
 An 8-year old prostitue hoing getting mommy money for crack 
 A little boy molested by his step-father, hopeless 
 The little boy grew up now, he's molesting his own kids 
 The government watching you from a satellite like you ain't had it right 
 Your best friend snitching on you, that's animal-like 
 It's horrible watching your loved ones die and having to bury them 
 To seeing my cousin found dead, she overdosed shooting heroin 
 My family dying from sickening disorders 
 We found my brother Maxx 
 He was blue and purple and he was stiff with rigamortis 
 My father got spots on his lungs, they think it's cancer 
 I'm praying every night, even if God don't ever answer 
 We can do it together, women hold your man's 
 Men hold your women, everybody let's hold hands and sing 
 Wake up, don't cry 
 So sad inside 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway 
 Wanna give up, feel like hiding 
 Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway 
 Away, away 
 I still get through the day 
 I'm gonna make it anyway
