Hell Razah 
 : 
 1-2, 1-2, girl you could hear me? 
 1-2, turn me up 
 I've been a threat since Benetton, Gazelles and Ballys 
 The icon and graffiti in the Brooklyn alley 
 Touch hearts of the pharaohs in the Egypt valley 
 My engineer can't see me cause the booth is cloudy 
 Still rowdy even though we in BMs and Audis 
 Looking like black Saudis in black Denalis 
 I'ma terrorist attack when I get on the track 
 If I'm riding shotgun, I need one in my lap 
 I adapt to any habitat, a BK desert rat 
 It's war, then we sending back bodies and gats 
 Put up your white flag homey, it get worse than Iraq 
 We know the CIA game was to frame us with crack 
 So each bar's more dope, heroin in my pen 
 Got a Marvin, back robbing, head nodding again 
 Who you shit on to get on top could make it pop in the end 
 Who's a flop and what's hot got you locked in the gym 
 Tell Jacob I spit jewels I could drop him a gem 
 And if he's looking for a diamond I could hook 'em with Timb 
 I'm Hip Hop before Sugar Hill signed a deal 
 Before Studio 54 popping pills 
 It was real when Kool Herc worked the wheels of steel 
 Now we bring the game back into a New York field 
 I'm Hip Hop before Sugarhill signed a deal 
 Before Studio 54 popping pills 
 I'm Hip Hop (since EPMD 'You Gots to Chill') 
 I'm Hip Hop (since Beastie Boys 'Licensed to Ill') 
 Tragedy Khadafi 
 : 
 I'm Christopher Wallace with street knowledge, apostle of the projects 
 Sneaker boxes with the g-packs stuffed in a G's closet 
 I'm tenement buildings, cement streets 
 I'm British Walkers, I'm scuff marks on your brand new Ellesse 
 5% Nation of Godbodies, greeting with peace 
 I'm raw like Kane, my lyrics are formed in solid rock 
 Spit it hotter than '86 on drug infested blocks 
 Last photo of Pac before his Beamer got shot 
 I'm the Queens, one man Supreme Team, triple beam dream 
 Microphone cream fiend, top five dead or alive, I'm so amazing 
 2-5 costra nostra, heart of this culture 
 The game ain't over 
 I'm the truce troop war reporter, legal life stick you 
 Against All Odds, not the ordinary shit you used to 
 I'm C-Murder before the life sentence 
 Predicate felons, homicide chasing niggas, hopping over benches

 I'm Hip Hop 
 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 The best, oh yes, I guess, suggest the rest should fess 
 I'm Tribe Quest, I'm Moe Dee 'Wild West' 
 Treach, Naughty, Jazz Jeff, Slick Rick, I'm Doug Fresh 
 I'm Def, I'm Canibus before he met Wyclef 
 Original, I don't bite, I don't need nobody to ghostwrite 
 Kool G Rap strike the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like 
 I'm Sweetback, I'm Uptown Saturday Night 
 I'm Black Caesar, I'm Rudy Ray Moore, Dolemite 
 I'm an assassin rapping 
 I'm Grand Wizzard Theodore when he invented scratching 
 I'm Wu-Tang Killa Bee, epitome of Public Enemy 
 Gambling, hustling like Smoothe and Trigger be bitter, b 
 Bums diggedy-diggedy, Das literally 
 I'm Pun in the middle of Little Italy, didn't do diddly 
 Didn't he listen to me, I'm all good, I'm hood 
 I'm Ice Cube before he turned soft and went Hollywood 
 I'm Poetic from Gravediggaz, I'm ODB 
 I'm HeadQCourterz, I'm Ted Demme, I'm Paul C 
 If I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest 
 I'm Richard Pryor before multiple sclerosis 
 I'm beef, I'm gold teeth, peace 
 Mantronix, Stetasonic, Symbolic, Bambaataa, Soul Sonic 
 I'm Dre 'the Chronic', Melodic with logic Islamic 
 A poverty prophet, economy robbery, cock it 
 I probably properly drop it, it gotta be honesty 
 Opposite a novelty, 'Rockit', I Herbie Hancock-it 
 I'm Onyx Throwin' Ya Gun, I'm Funky 4 + 1
