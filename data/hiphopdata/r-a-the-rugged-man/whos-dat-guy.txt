(Rugged Man have it, Mobb we infamous) 
 Yo, the Jess Franco of hip hop, leave you faceless 
 Torture chambers, sadist in the basement 
 Rugged Man, who's the foulest? Who's the rudest? 
 I grip my dick while I do this, HG Lewis 
 The two thousand maniacs, who this? 
 Blood feast, old school splatter, occupation 
 Famous rappers, straight razors, we dead broke, we playa haters 
 Violaters, up your bitch pussy with vibrators 
 That's why they hate us, scum dripping 
 Under age, coogi sticking, pussy licking, put the clip in 
 I take a shit on your album when it drops 
 Plus your whole crew is pussies, like Suffolk County cops 
 Suffolk County, meets Queensbridge, don't be foolish 
 Rugged Man, Jack Johnson, Joe Louis 
 R to the A, no life, lowlife 
 The pretty bitch offender, the fat bitch complementer 
 Top five lyrical contender, the lyricist's career ender 
 White trash trailer park representer 
 Who can stop this? Who rock this? Who lock this? 
 Who got the Glock? Who cock this? Lucio Fulci 
 R.A. the Rugged Man (on the reals) 
 Rugged Man, Havoc (no doubt) 
 Havoc 
 : 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 A nigga you don't wanna fuck with 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 Four pounds will make 'em duck quick 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 Getting lifted at the bar, no doubt 
 Rugged Man, Havoc, Mobb we infamous 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 A nigga you don't wanna fuck with 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 Four pounds will make 'em duck quick 
 (Who's that guy?) 
 Getting lifted at the bar, no doubt 
 Rugged Man, Havoc, Mobb we infamous 
 Got my drink on, reminiscing drama on God 
 Stepped out my crib, politic with the gods 
 Over gats, even though the hood is hot 
 Jakes on bikes, gotta hold down the block 
 Cause my life this automatic instant, ice grills, without a blink 
 Permanently stained, they surface like Big 
 They shitting on my name, some ask why 
 Cause the sign just a regular gangsta, fuck DKNY 
 Scuffed Timbs laid up in Holiday Inn's 
 And shortie wanna fret, I'm running up in her friend 
 Official roaches, Scarface, shitting on mister Sosa, stay bent 
 Hold my liquor, like a cup coaster, handle mines 
 Sever great lines, cut throats while you drop dimes 
 Snitch niggas on my shit list, quietly cock the biscuit
