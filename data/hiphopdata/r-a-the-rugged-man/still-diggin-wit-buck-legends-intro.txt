Life-life is a beautiful thing 
 You just gotta get, through it 
 Yo, yo, it's me 
 Nah, Legends never die 
 I'm back the dip-dip-diver, warrior, industry fighter 
 Film producer, director, screenwriter, legendary rhymer 
 Congrats I bring you a classic for the fans that supported 
 I give you props if you ain't stole it and you actually bought it 
 If not, purchase it today and own it 
 A brand new R.A. the Rugged Man album, this is a historical moment 
 A hip-hop artist with a hundred percent creative freedom 
 Million dollar budgets and corporate endorsements, we don't need 'em 
 Anyone dissing go listen to them industry puppet musicians 
 This for hip-hop heads, everyone else fuck your opinions 
 This ain't generic pop novelty rap, I'm reigning supreme 
 You're 'bout to hear a level of skill you won't hear in the mainstream 
 This is writing rhymes in notebooks, venomous bars 
 Boom bap beats, murderous scratching beat boxing and dope hooks 
 Analog, two inch reel, boom boxes and tape recorders 
 This ain't trippy emo hipster rapping or girly acting skateboarders 
 This ain't about Hollywood fame or chart positions 
 It's about credibility of being one of the great technicians 
 No internet nerds, trend following critics or dick lickers 
 No fake image or gimmicks just vivid pictures and lyrics 
 I'm not the most known, but commercial rappers can't compete 
 I make records for the shepherds and not for the sheep 
 Not impressed, you'll be impressed soon 
 Let's get it started like Kool Herc did in that Sedgwick Avenue rec room
