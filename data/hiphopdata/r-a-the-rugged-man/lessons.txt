"R-A what's the lesson for today Rugged Man" - Sadat X 
 "I am the legendary... R-A" - Sadat X 
 Yo aiiyo people wonderin' where the fuck I been 
 At the VIP section they ain't lettin' me in 
 They say; maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland 
 They say; a white boy need a black boy to win 
 Uh Bubba Sparxx did it and so did Slim 
 Just Blaze is hot now why don't you get with him 
 I watch mad rappers bite my shit and blow up 
 And make millions of what I created, that's tough luck 
 I first started gettin' coverage around the same time 
 Steve Stout used to carry kid and placed luggage 
 I seen rappers turned from sex symbols in hard throbs 
 To bein forgotten now they out lookin' for jobs 
 I seen EPMD break up 
 I seen my little brother Max fall asleep and he ain't never wake up 
 So when I rhyme listen, seriously 
 When I spit I'm givin' you the truth clearly who I really be 
 It's an audio version of reality TV 
 I had deals from Russell Simmonds to Master P 
 Even five year old white girls be rappin' today 
 On the playground like 'go shorty it's ya birthday' (Go, go, go..) 
 "Here's a little story I got ta tell" 
 "I am the legendary" 
 "R-A" "Rugged Man" 
 Yo yo yo I seen good days sun rays church sundays 
 Made love made war been rich been poor 
 Lost friends lost hoods lost my dough 
 Seen beef between Bad Boy and Death Row 
 I seen deceased take the life for my sisters kid 
 Six months on the Earth is what he had to live 
 I seen Biggie Big L Big Pun pass away 
 Buffy from the Fat Boys, Jam Master Jay 
 I mumple 'fore they blew up with Mystikal and Jay-Z 
 The Neptunes came to see me at D & D 
 I knew this chick named Norah a lounge singer 
 A year later she a six Grammy award winner 
 I seen flatliners I seen cannabisses 
 I seen Lil Zane see I seen mad misses 
 You ran through that ten percent disses 
 I seen A & R's get fired for takin' pisses 
 Stop whinin' and bitchin' nobody listens 
 Who else riskin' they career they stick to be indifferent 
 Switchin' the tradition stickin' to this shit they really livin' 
 I don't care what's hittin 
 Listen this is my fuckin' life that I'm spittin' 
 "Here's a little story I got ta tell" 
 "I am the legendary" 
 "R-A" "Rugged Man" 
 I made peace with myself now how bout that 
 I hated life I wanted to die a few years back 
 I was mentally ill it's hard to come back from that 
 But I got through it now I got my sanity back 
 Y'all are like H-B-O fighters get the money and fame 
 Get beat up like Klitschko and Sugar Shane 
 Or get beat like Vernon Forrest or Prince Naseem 
 And you all turn pussy when you get that green 
 I got love for Havoc from Mobb Deep 
 When I was broke sleepin' in the street 
 He hooked me up with a free beat 
 Alchemist you still my little buddy 
 Althought you stole that Royce the 5"9 +The King+ beat from me 
 I ain't down to sign autographs and shake ya hands 
 I don't want trendy ass followers as fans 
 I don't wanna sell records, I don't wanna be big 
 I don't want MTV runnin' up in my crib 
 I don't wanna be light in the music biz 
 I don't want fans that don't know who G Rap is
