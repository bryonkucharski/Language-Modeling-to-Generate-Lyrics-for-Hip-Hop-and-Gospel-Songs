I walk in the Pentagon with a blood soaked hatchet 
 Leave the president's nose shattered 
 Stretch his neck like go gadget, and toe tag it 
 You a stone cold faggot 
 I hold the chrome in a jacket 
 Go toe to toe with a savage 
 And roll you over a cactus 
 Funeral's are closed caskets, coke addicts 
 Chrome ratches, the whole package 
 I'll beat Moses on the head with them stone tablets 
 I killed Kennedy, brains blown all over Onassis 
 I'll hold my own with the axes 
 And turn the pope into ashes 
 Designed frequency, I'm a holy divine lyrical deity 
 Even atheists and heathens and non-believers believe in me 
 The punk-ass devil was born soft 
 I'll piledrive you like Paul Orndorff 
 Steal his pitchfork and rip his horns off 
 I'm the born force 
 Sick fuck, I'll skin you alive and then carry the bones 
 Load the ruger up and shoot you up like I'm Marion Jones 
 Vinnie is out of his dome 
 Guinea that carry the throne 
 Gimme, it's that or be stoned 
 Trinity, that'll be home 
 We bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz 
 We don't give a fuck 
 New jack pussy, young rappers think their rapping is good 
 Young rappers get treated like fetuses in planned parenthood 
 This ain't no Mickey Mouse, zip-a-dee-doo-dah Disney 
 It's the claws of a grizzly 
 It ain't Wayne and Drizzy, it's Thorburn and Vinnie 
 And R.A., that's my brother there, anyone who unaware 
 I'mma leave 'em stumbling as if they had a ton of beer 
 I'm from Philly, it ain't a sucker to ever come from here 
 You a pussy, you see confrontation and you run from there 
 What kind of dirty bitch did your daddy put his sperm in? 
 Kiddie porn web searchin', pervert jerkin, you serpents is Satan's servants 
 You get slain for certain if you put your faith inside of Satan serpents 
 Stick the blade in you while I embrace you like my favorite person 
 Stay in Hell burning, slaves with chains on your brain like a turban 
 I make Abel kill Cain and get bible pages reversin', brains burstin' 
 It takes a taste of bourbon for me to rape a virgin 
 And Vinnie deal with mathematics like an Asian person 
 We bout to spaz, R.A.Annotate and Vinnie Paz 
 We don't give a fuck 
 Hands like Roberto Durán, it's the flight 103 Pan Am 
 It's the Gulf War between Iraq and Iran 
 Treat you like Indians I'm snatching your land 
 I'm more dapper than Dan, I'm Rakim I master the plan 
 I bring the roots without having a band 
 Without having a fan I coulda never took care of my fam 
 I coulda never done all the tours on the shores of Japan 
 Still would've slaughtered your man, still would've aborted the plan 
 Still an apostle from Sham, still I'm like God in Sudan 
 We bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz 
 We don't give a fuck
