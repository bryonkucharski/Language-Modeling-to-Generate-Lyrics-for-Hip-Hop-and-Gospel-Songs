Hell Razah 
 : 
 I keep it ghetto where it's grimey, grimey, you know how Bed-Stuy be 
 Throwing them block parties, building with God bodies 
 Before Dirty died, BK been lively 
 My project army, Red Hook been behind me 
 I spit jewels shiny, bright as Illuminati 
 The black owl see the white inside Colin Powell 
 Hitler and George Bush, they got you acting Nazi 
 I be a child of Israel, young Haile Selassie 
 Ghetto Government, ark of the covenant 
 A track with Rugged Man, I had to come fuck with it 
 JoJo, Remedy, Blaq Poet, running shit 
 JoJo Pellegrino 
 : 
 Mmm, that's how you comes with it? I fucks with it, yo 
 Pelle' keep it a thousand, a hundred percent 
 He got clout and a ton of respect 
 Never sold my soul, I leased to him when he cut me the check 
 Sit pretty, spitting ugly, I say this nice and clear 
 I'm the best that never did it, all them other guys is eh 
 Unimpressed with the state of rap, I'mma help them embrace the fact 
 Move forward, take it back, shedding light, watch 'em fade to black 
 Blap, and fuck rappers that can't compare to me 
 They scared of me, Pelle' the streets, keep your ear to me 
 Remedy 
 : 
 I pop a pill, chill, sit back, release my anxiety 
 Got two exotic Colombian bitches on both sides of me 
 Make clothes, raid codes, Mr. Secret Society 
 I hate liars, this is the truth, there's no denying me 
 Fuck you, pay me what you owe me, let 'em know 
 Staten Island like Joey, I'm Israeli like Razah is 
 Young Haile Selassie, white Jew, never Nazi 
 There's black and white poets in hand, yo Rugged Man 
 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Like Bo King cousin, bass in your face, displaying hate in the place 
 White folks hate me, I'm disgracing the race 
 Underground I hold the crown and I ain't gon' pass it 
 Every verse that I spit, I give birth to a classic 
 Am I ignorant? Hmm, maybe, hmm, probably, am I genius? 
 That's a possibility, possibly, as amazing 
 As I spit it's obvious, I'm the cockiest, I write hits 
 I don't need no Gwen Stefani's or Fergie white chicks 
 Kill the species of weak MC's, faggot rappers 
 I'm allergic to your sweetness like diabetes 
 Master of mack, and max relax and jab in slabber 
 You battle, you bagging your bitch, waving and bruising 
 Will leave in a broken ragged Caddy, babbling 
 Traveling, bullets splattering 
 Rat-a-tat shattering, I'm the Gracie family grappling, yup 
 And hating on me is like hating the truth 
 You can lie to yourself, but deep down you know I'm the truth 
 Blaq Poet 
 : 
 Why? Blaq Poet motherfucker 
 That's the name, and I'll, blow your troubles 
 Right out your brain, it's insane how I penetrate 
 Your dome piece, microphone fiend, fuck the police 
 I'm a known beast, I get it popping, I'm not stopping 
 Lyrical AK spray, got your body flip flopping 
 Yo, R.A., who the fuck want it? 
 I have these punks running back up in they mama stomach 
 I'm a real deal, straight from the gutter 
 Might fuck the hood, but you dumb motherfuckers 
 Y'all can give it up, I don't give a fuck, just 
 Get out the way, I'm coming through like what, plus 
 The guns bust, no dust, no rust, trust 
 You better roll with the rush, don't oppose us 
 Or get crushed by the truck, all G's up 
 When the shit start you better not freeze up
