 Yo, let's begin it like this 
 The definition of a rap flow, I'mma reinvent it like this 
 Now what's that? Bust first, I bust back 
 Must crush, bust gats, must bust, a small time crook 
 I'm stealing your hubcaps, ain't nothing for discussion 
 I'm crushing you're dust and you're done in when I'm busting the rough raps 
 The Biz Mark, Biz Mark 
 What is it? A blizzard - Is it a limit? 
 Any crime you could name I committed 
 I admit it, I did it 
 Lottery, gotta be in it to win it 
 I'm just a white boy ruining what blacks invented 
 But I'm the baddest, undefeated 
 Beat it, believe it, leaving you leaking, losing blood like an anemic 
 I'm rather conceited 
 Rappers are comedic, heated leaving you paraplegic 
 I'm undeniable, diabolical, biological warfare 
 Rugged that raggedy bastard 
 His breath stink like he gargling with battery acid 
 Who would've figured me to be deadly? 
 They never be ready to bury me 
 Better be ready, nobody better than me 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now 
 Rugged Man's flow will fuck your whole head up 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now 
 (Let's begin it like this

 Rugged Man's flow is uglier than blind dates 
 My mental is heavy like Heavy D & Chubb Rock combined weights 
 I love myself, I'm so vain 
 I'm not just the king of New York, I'm the king of the whole game 
 Putting rappers in hibernation, they're hiding away 
 For retirement they're racing, it's funny, like a pie in the face 
 And devastating, made a mistake 
 And you're waiting, debating, facing your fate 
 And creating, hating, raping, imitating, the great 
 And break in your place and taking your safe and taking your paper 
 Paying for faking, this is history in the making, but wait 
 Spit at the cops, I'm resisting arrest 
 They wanna see me fry like a chicken wing and a breast 
 The truth is, behind closed doors I'm a bit of a sissy 
 Singing love ballads to bitches like Lionel Richie 
 No joking, bragging and boasting hoping to get close and approach 'em 
 Poke 'em, perking, and posing, putting poison in the potion 
 Cooking the coke and cutting your throat and opening the potion 
 Leaving you floating in the ocean 
 You was Aaliyah rocking the boat and 
 Leaving ya broken, you could get Smokey to second that emotion 
 Explosion of flowing, overdosing, the chosen has spoken 
 Sing 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now 
 Rugged Man's flow will fuck your whole head up 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now 
 (Let's begin it like this 
 The definition of a rap flow, I'mma reinvent it like this) 
 Rat-tat-tat sporadic, attack panic 
 Laying you down like craftmatic 
 You dissing missing your fingertips 
 You crack addict, I've had it 
 I'm back at it, the mathematic 
 Bringing the black magic attack 
 Hold up, let's slow it down with these raps 
 Let me catch my breath, let my brain relax 
 I'm so fly, I'm basically levitating 
 I'm in the Guinness book, record breaking 
 Hit you with a chair like the World Wrestling Federation 
 I got a bad reputation 
 Doc want to put me on a better medication 
 Cops hate me, harass me, interrogation 
 I'm dumb in the head, lack of education 
 That's enough, wait a minute 
 I'm finished, I'm done with it 
 Yo Swan, sing it 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now 
 Rugged Man's flow will fuck your whole head up 
 I'm feelin' so groovy now
