Krizz Kaliko: 
 (Holla-Holla-Loo-Yuh) 
 I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing 
 (Holla-Holla-Loo-Yuh) 
 I am everything you ever were afraid of 
 (Holla-Holla-Loo-Yuh) 
 I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing 
 (Holla-Holla-Loo-Yuh) 
 Yeah, you rappers bore me, I wanna kill you 
 Do it for me and I'll holla-holla 
 Tech N9ne: 
 I am the pinnacle of sin, it shows when he begin his flows 
 Timid women show genitals, then it's "go" when it's presentable 
 Finna show women some in this moment diminish whores 
 Skin it, no gimmicks, replenish, no - grim No Limit shows 
 Call it what you want it - middle finger my opponent 
 Really seem defiant, don't it 
 One Moment 
 I will demolish niggas with the rawest scriptures 
 Y'all is just balls of shit in a stall, let's hit, this be the hardest pisser 
 Then a tramp will tell me, my piss enhance her belly 
 But I chose to give her a dirty mouth like Lisa Lampanelli 
 Yes, she demanded jelly, but I re-ran the Kelly 
 I'm springing the yelly and it's swell because I slammed the Belvy 
 I'm a monster, on the mic or when I'm on her 
 Have a motherfucker somber, cause of ill shit that I conjure 
 Juggernaut, he never conquered, if she wants for me, I haunt her 
 Wandering where've we gone, sir? R.A. and Tech, yeah we bonkers 
 R.A. The Rugged Man: 
 Yo, it's a brutal system, assume position 
 You superstition? or Jew or Christian? 
 School religion is a cruel depiction 
 They can blind your hearing, they can mute your vision 
 Live in the dirt, burn, slithering earth worm 
 Leave you like MJ with a hit and a burnt perm 
 Soon to be unity, murder me, what could you do to me? 
 This is foolery, I'm a hooligan, leaving you drooling 
 When I'm beating you brutally 
 Slappin' your bitch and takin' your jewelry 
 Your mama crying when she reading your eulogy 
 Let me slow down, put your dough down 
 I've got enough flow for it to go around 
 This is profound, you a broke clown 
 With a coke frown and an old sound 
 I'm like "sell 'em the heroin and givin' 'em the needle" 
 I'm in your cerebral, this wigger is evil 
 Limit the people, piss in a cathedral 
 Aborting your mission like a position that's fetal 
 My impolite stares give 'em nightmares 
 Burn 'em like the bush, give 'em white hairs 
 Jiving and shucking your ass, sufferin' succotash 
 I fuck with the gutter trash, don't fuck with the upper class 
 Sellers and buyers, political liars 
 The drug suppliers, the fake Messiahs 
 Is it negative energy hiding their identity? 
 Every enemy wishing they were shooting me like a Kennedy 
 I spit at Satan and I kick his face in 
 Make him lick the pavement for misbehaving 
 You got a vendetta? Better be ready to forget it 
 Bullets is headed to your head and embedded, the slug met it 
 I be tripping on my ego like I'm Ultra Magnetic 
 Makin' dollars like I'm Parrish and Erick 
 I'm back, check it bitch
