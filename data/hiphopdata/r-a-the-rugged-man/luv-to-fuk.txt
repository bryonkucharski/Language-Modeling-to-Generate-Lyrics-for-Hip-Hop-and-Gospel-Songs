Ayo, ladies love Rugged, I'm a casanova 
 And once I make love to you, baby, it's all over 
 Your boyfriend beat you up, call me if you need some loving 
 Or if he's corny in the bed and you just need a good fucking 
 I'm living every man's dream 
 I'm in my mid 30's and I'm strictly fucking bitches that are barely 18 
 In bed women say "oh, he's clever" 
 When I'm dead chicks will probably miss me more than the late Heath Ledger 
 Yeah, they love me long time, it's like it's '89 
 And I'm Christopher Williams and Al B. Sure! combined 
 And I'll never leave 'em, man-eater, dammit, I need her, she a diva 
 Lend her the visa to feed her, please her, I'm eager to ease her 
 Turn on your radio, chica chica, I know my voice turn you on 
 Take off your panties, make love to the speaker, come on 
 You know I love to fuck, tearing up that butt 
 They always make me feel at home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone 
 I swear they love the dick, drip, drip, drip 
 They don't forget my balls 
 They often long to bring me home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone 
 Ayo, figured the way to get paid is to grab the mic rehearse, you know 
 Smooth as Jermaine, so baby, don't take it personal 
 Say I'm arrogant and cocky, wha, who me? 
 Kissing on your neck, woman, you can't refuse me 
 I got a crush on that big bitch Missy Elliott 
 After I fuck Missy maybe she can write me a hit 
 Your man repeatedly cheating, I'm treating you decent, we meeting 
 I'm leaving you screaming, fiending, reaching, you making your weekend 
 Call me Mandingo Kenny Norton 
 It's true I'm the ugliest dude getting pussy since Billy Bob Thornton 
 You need drugs, I can get 'em a little coke for your nose 
 In the clubs that's how you get models to take off clothes 
 In high school I was the type always beating up teachers 
 And getting head from the cheerleaders under the bleachers 
 Smoother than Jeffrey Osborne, more buttery than popcorn 
 Beautiful women all over the globe keeping my cock warm 
 So don't be jealous 
 That you're stuck home with a bunch of kids and a fat wife 
 Yeah, you wished you lived my life 
 You know I love to fuck, tearing up that butt 
 They always make me feel at home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone 
 I swear they love the dick, drip, drip, drip 
 They don't forget my balls 
 They often long to bring me home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone 
 Women can't handle my voice, it's so sexy and smooth 
 All I gotta do is talk and bitches get in the mood 
 You're the best at dicksucking, here's some mouthwash 
 Clean your mouth before you go home and start kissing your husband 
 You're insecure, you feel low? I'll give you some attention 
 You need a confidence booster, a little love and affection 
 Girl, you look good enough to eat, so sweet Aand petite 
 I'll take your shoes and socks off and I'll suck on your feet 
 And lick your ankles and your knees and your thighs and uh 
 Slowly making my way, I'mma make you cum all day 
 After the sex it make me nervous how these bitches be acting 
 They on some rabbit in a pot shit like Fatal Attraction 
 I'm back 
 Filthy's my friend, sex is the term 
 Difference with them, face full of sperm 
 Once I was blind, but now I see 
 These ladies want me more than I believe 
 And I love how they love everything I'm about 
 Poking that ass, bust through that mouth 
 After we cuddle and kiss through the night 
 You know I love to fuck, tearing up that butt 
 They always make me feel at home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone 
 I swear they love the dick, drip, drip, drip 
 They don't forget my balls 
 They often long to bring me home 
 Never leaving me alone, never leaving me alone
