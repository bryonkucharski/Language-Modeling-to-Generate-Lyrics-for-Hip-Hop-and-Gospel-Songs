(Feat. Killah Priest and Masta Killa) 
 (Intro: Killah Priest (Masta Killa)) 
 Let it flow, deh-deh-duh (yeah) it's on (beh-deh-deh-deh) 
 (Den-e-neh) on... (yo, aiyo) 
 (Chorus: reggae sample) 
 Keep on knowin' what you know 
 Keep on knowin' what you know 
 End up, up, up, in chains, chains, chains 
 (Masta Killa) 
 Back in '88, son was gettin' a little paper 
 Caught a few stings, rocked the phat rope cables 
 Pushed the white Mercury Sable, known for holdin' heat 
 Pharaoh garmer marks on his feet, serpents whisper 
 You can smell the deceit, they greet me like peeps, to blend 
 And try to befriend, to get up, underneath the skin 
 My long wind'll blow ya head piece degrees 
 Murder One Team, Barcelini Noodle had lean 
 Microphone fiend, step into the rhythm 
 This is how I'm servin' them, no need for medic attention 
 I just murder them, murder them... pussy, I just murder them 
 (R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 I'm a dip-dip diverse, socializer 
 I'm a hoof flat top rule, in eighty niner 
 They say Rugged, by now, you should of at least blown 
 It's funny, I'm mad famous for being unknown 
 I'm just a dirty motherfucker, they hate my guts 
 All I talk about is bitches, and bustin' nuts 
 Yeah, I got a foul mouth, yeah, I cuss too much 
 I'm just so Ricky Ricardo, ri-di-cu-lous 
 And I ain't got no fly whip, I still ride the bus 
 I got Mitch Blood Green on the scene with us 
 Hospitable, hitable, cooler, than Jacob who criminal 
 Miracle, lyrical, take every syllable literal 
 Little riddle, profitable, visible, iritibal 
 Little brittle, pitiful, for so through little, you tickle, you typical 
 Yeah, I talk shit, I'm cocky with it 
 It's hard for you to admit it, but I'm one of the best in it 
 (Killah Priest) 
 My mind is haunted, filled with the extension of slaves that's torment 
 Slow down my steps, one foot from the grave to con it 
 Our young black males, they lick pon gate 
 Son of the morning, roasted souls, tell Minister "come pray" 
 It's gun trade inside of smokey apartments 
 Flow process, one nine, two tech, four revolvers 
 Coke overballing kettels, it's like we struck oil in the ghetto's 
 We supply it to addict's, the devil work 
 He practice, he's like a search backwards 
 Till they throw that dirt in our casket, and that's it 
 I live where the fiends are nothin', just a scene of the projects, similar to 
 Osama's 
 An old man, at the top of the stairs, he just stare 
 'Cause his mind ain't there, victim of the war 
 Polar signs, the times is near 
 He drop the jewels, till you buy him a beer 
 He said he was a linebacker for the Bears 
 Said he did it all back, while he's dryin' his tear 
 Yeah, it's that real shit, that made me 
 That music from the '80's, the child's of the '70's 
 I live long till they bury me...
