I can see your halo 
 Yo, my heart feel like it's suffering from strangulation 
 Tears flying outta my eyes, my heart racing and my hands shaking 
 The last days of your life as a cancer patient 
 I'm staring at your corpse praying and waiting for you to awaken 
 21 gun salute for the hero, the burial was beautiful 
 Both Green Berets and Screaming Eagles attended the funeral 
 I was mad at God like he murdered you 
 As a father you couldn't have done a better job 
 All six of your children basically worshipped you 
 If I needed advice I always came to you to discuss 
 You was the only person since the day I was born I ever trusted 
 Through poverty, death, disease and sickness 
 You always somehow found a way to turn the situation optimistic 
 I was a big fat kid overweight 
 So to clown me you bought me the Fat Boys, it was my very first rap tape 
 In the neighborhood you had a name, you was feared and respected 
 Other fathers walked out on their kids and left them neglected 
 My only regret about not selling out and getting richer 
 Is that if I made millions I could've shared it and spend it with you 
 I miss you, I love you daddy 
 I can see your halo 
 Yo, part good samaritan, part criminal, a master with weapons 
 Nice with his hands, he was Rugged Man the original 
 As children we saw you losing your sanity 
 Even though we watched you struggle financially 
 You kept the love in the family 
 Daddy, I'm thinking about you every day though 
 I can see you holding a machine gun in heaven with angel wings and a halo 
 You was always quick to pick a pocket 
 You're the only one in heaven 
 Probably slick enough to pull off stealing God's wallet 
 In life the Lord ain't really deal you a fair one 
 I watched you bury your baby boy, you daughter and your grandson 
 You lived one hell of a life from being highly decorated 
 To being homeless sleeping in the park with your pregnant wife 
 If I acted up in the restaurant I knew I was being brave 
 'Cause you'd take me to the bathroom and spank me till I knew how to behave 
 Taught me prayers at night and you'd tell me Bible stories 
 Taught me history, Crazy Horse and his tribal glories 
 How many times as a kid I seen you handcuffed by the cops? 
 You taught us black music, Sam Cooke, The Drifters, The Four Tops 
 Taught me about boxing, Ray Leonard and Larry Holmes 
 Around the same time you left my mother for Debbie Jones 
 I told the world your true story and after the record got made 
 Uncommon Valor, some said I dropped the verse of the decade 
 Everywhere you went you would tell the world about your son Rugged Man 
 You was so proud of me, daddy, you was my number one fan 
 You was always bragging about me to no purpose 
 On your deathbed you'd play my Mayweather interview for the nurses 
 Losing you, daddy, it hurt more than any physical pain 
 You was too young when the cancer went from your throat and into your brain 
 You was my teacher, my idol, I worshipped you, you was the best, daddy 
 You lived a tough life, now get some rest, daddy 
 I love you daddy 
 I can see your halo
