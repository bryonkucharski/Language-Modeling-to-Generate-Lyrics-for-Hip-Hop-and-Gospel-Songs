Akinyele 
 : 
 It's the Ak that rock that freaky beats 
 Staying on the job like them niggas home from work release 
 I hear rappers talk like they're the hardest 
 Well, I be in jails trying to get bails to come over from the real murder charges 
 I put you in a hearse, kid 
 Rock with vanity virgins so fuck her right in the rhyme without the cursive 
 Huh, I get illy ripping this shit like a villy 
 You fish ass niggas, you best go free Willy 
 I recite paragraphs that'll razor label rappers who bite 
 So I can rip it from their ass to their appetite 
 You not ready for this y'all, nope 
 You silly dopes know that I cut your throats like Stacy Lattisaw 
 Rugged Man

 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Yo, down with my man Akinyele, rock well east in L.I 
 I know the spot well, when we die we go to Valhalla, not hell 
 We vikings, see the way I trill, spit the real shit, don't care about selling 
 That's how shit is, I don't need shit, remix 
 Larry Holmes, 81 inches, that's what the reach is 
 Eat this, lay down, face down, stay down, way down 
 It's too late now, you ain't safe now 
 It's getting crowded as Auschwitz 
 You fuck without shit 
 How's this on some hillbilly down south shit, acknowledge 
 Rugged Man always bring the wild shit 
 I'm sick of big budget videos and shiny outfits 
 ('Cause we was up in the prison, prison, prison 
 Up in the prison 
 Rugged Man, what the fuck is going on? 
 Come on, word bond) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Rugged Man, what the fuck?) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Akinyele, what the fuck?) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Rugged Man, what the fuck?) 
 Is going on? 
 (Up in the prison, prison) 
 What the fuck? 
 (What the fuck? 
 What the fuck? 
 (Up in the prison, prison) 
 What the fuck is going on?

 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Some people hate us, some people love us 
 See us in the club getting fat bitches' numbers 
 I'm scared to get tested 'cause I never wear rubbers 
 The basics, break it, race kids 
 See us spray kids, dangerousness, dangerousesses 
 People too scared to walk where we live 
 You got beef, I'm at the crib 
 And I'll be waiting with my shorts off 
 Sitting on the porch with the sawed off 
 Blow your balls off, you all soft 
 Akinyele 
 : 
 Guys, you better recognize 
 I'm one of the illest lyricists that ever exist 
 So watch your back like Zorro 
 I take a toll on your ass like the crown Burrough 
 Fuck it, I'm thorough 
 Niggas better face the facts or get smacked 
 In the face with the gat 
 I turned pretty boys into Craig Mack's 
 Sometime it be's like that 
 The name Akinyele remains a true remaining fact 
 ('Cause we was up in the prison, prison, prison 
 Up in the prison 
 Rugged Man, what the fuck is going on? 
 Come on, word bond) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Rugged Man, what the fuck?) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Akinyele, what the fuck?) 
 What the fuck? 
 (Rugged Man, what the fuck?)
