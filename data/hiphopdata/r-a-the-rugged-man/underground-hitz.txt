It's a jungle out there, you gotta have 
 It's a jungle out there, you gotta have 
 Yo, I'll put my dick out and I'll pee on your property 
 Being a mockery, I'm abusive cheating never believing in monogamy 
 Mediocrity, pockets full of singles at the strip club, cash dropping 
 No class ass riding, I'm heinous, atrocious, repulsive, I'm past shocking 
 Rappers is speaking with no heart, don't start 
 It don't matter, I can slay you to Bach, Bethoven, Amadeus Mozart 
 At the dinner table cursing wiping cum on your curtain 
 I'm a poverty pirate, a poor penny pinching pitiful person 
 I'm from the 80's where we were skeezing and pleasing the skeezers 
 Thieving and popping and shooting and robbing 
 And boosting and stealing your sneakers 
 Won't be in Forbes mag on no Forbes listes 
 But my life is parties and gambling 
 Hookers, whore houses and porn bitches 
 Hotel orgies with groupies, we rock stars, heart throbs 
 On the roof throwing cinder blocks from the hoods at cop cars 
 I'mma disrespect you to pigs, you was squeeling too, they didn't protect you 
 Living and learning and losing listening to the lecture 
 Hitting it and giving it extras 
 Snatch your prom date, rip the cunt hole 
 I'm the bully, get your lunch stole 
 House parties, stick my balls in the punchbowl 
 Come on, sing it

 Yo, it's Rugged Man and Hop, we never get handed props 
 We keeping it dope and underground as the planet watch 
 If you want some bullshit, we spitting lyrics, then dammit stop 
 Talking like you the hardest artist and you just can't get knocked 
 So keep thinking that, take this track and play it back 
 Just to remind you that everything you fucking say is wack 
 But don't get mad and start cussing at us 
 'Cause we just finally fixed the shit cause you was fucking it up 
 Yo, I'm sick of the game and everything it deals with 
 Yo, R.A. come over and bring the kill switch 
 Our brains are real sick, insane and filled with 
 A gang of ill shit, we can't be killed, bitch 
 Who want it with us? We never tow and get up 
 Don't try to step up 'cause I promise that you'll only get bucked 
 Emcees are scared running as we slowly erupt 
 We was born for this, yo, it's time to bring the chorus in
