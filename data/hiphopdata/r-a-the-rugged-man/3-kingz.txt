Kool G Rap 
 : 
 Yeah, you know the clique move deep as the Red Sea 
 7:30 like a nigga be on PSP 
 Be in VIP, VSOP doing it B-I-G 
 Nigga you know me 
 Soon as the motherfucking jakes on him he low key 
 Take a little journey O-T where that dough be 
 The fifth on him 
 I O-D like the O-D the fish on him 
 Brim of the hat to the nose piece the chicks on him 
 Some wild hoes, in wild style clothes 
 They download and videotape 'em like al po 
 The wild road facing the chair if the trial blow 
 That's with the best friends and the sounds Tical knows 
 Know that killers come with calm faces 
 Shakes and hugs ace with gloves 
 Hate from love the traits of thugs 
 Snake like characteristics 
 Me, Big J, R.A gun barrels get lifted 
 3 kings, there ain't no snatching our crowns 
 We be them 3 kings, we here to fracture you clowns 
 3 kings, Big John, Rugged Man and G Rap 
 Talking trash, no talking back, we slaughter you cats 
 R.A the Rugged Man 
 : 
 Who the master in the rap game? Thorburn last name 
 Reigning smacking attacking ya brain aiming back with the flame 
 Attract pain and learn from the best murdering burning the rest 
 We ain't no GQ rappers like Pharrell or Kanye West 
 I'm an abomination, I'm bombing a nation's population 
 You just a chick with a dick without no operation 
 I'm barely eating badly beaten, beaten badly in the precinct 
 I'm the hardest that God ever gave the privilege of speaking 
 Frantically banning me, Rugged Man'll panicky that'd be fantasy 
 Loaded hammer he handing me blabber the bragger be 
 A man who'd be damned if he happily married with family 
 Splatter ya mammy mammary gland insane insanity anarchy 
 Swagger the rapper the biter biting his flattery 
 Beating buzzing you battery agony back to reality 
 Bring it back you deliver that pitiful pitter pat 
 Pull the trigger snitch hit a rat you wick-wick-wack 
 3 kings, there ain't no snatching our crowns 
 We be them 3 kings, we here to fracture you clowns 
 3 kings, Big John, Rugged Man and G Rap 
 Talking trash, no talking back, we slaughter you cats 
 Big John 
 : 
 Decapitation vaccination Big John ain't no mental patient 
 Been on medication ever since the day I could talk 
 You want a sedative you can drink the blood from my heart 
 We magnificent glistening banging bitches while we christening 
 You kelters and helters we here to body you cowards 
 My occupations slaughtery for wack rappers who try and bother me 
 You not as hot as me, Big John it gotta be 
 Exceptional technical poison pumping through my ventricles 
 I'm fresh in 0-7 those battles pseudo-intellectuals 
 Y'all faggots get smashed quick, for rapping that wack shit 
 Chop with the hatchet throw it in the trunk of a black whip 
 You can't imagine my passion combined with rapping adaption 
 And with the comic book caption reads I'm the bombest kid rapping 
 I smack cliques with wack writs cause really they that bitch 
 Big John, Giancana stuff bricks in the mattress 
 Fuck with R.A and I'm leaving you backless
