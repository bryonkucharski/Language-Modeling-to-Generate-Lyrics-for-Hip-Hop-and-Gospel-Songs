Hear ye, hear ye, yah 
 In this future of hip hop history 
 I'm here to bring out the people's champ 
 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 Put your hands up, tell 'em wild out 
 This is how we do it, we here to turn it out 
 Put your hands up, tell 'em wild out 
 This is how we do it, we here to turn it out 
 Yo, my flow reminiscent of a prime Grand Puba 
 My tongue sharper than the sword of the Japanese Yakuza 
 Beats always slamming like Dilla, like Ali was the man in Manilla 
 Man or gorilla, I'm a nicer striker than Anderson Silva 
 I'm conquering like Hannibal on the back of an elephant 
 I'm the best even if I'm pink and pale and I'm lacking in melanin 
 I've been a problem since my first birth date 
 In the delivery room my dick hit the ground and it caused a earthquake 
 The school hallways I was pissing in 
 As a kid I was lacking in discipline 
 Ignoring authorities and never listening 
 I come from the slummiest of slum villages, killing evil 
 You come from a village of disco dancing; Village People 
 You other rappers I'm obliterating 
 My flow is the Michelangelo Sistine Chapel 
 You ain't even finger painting 
 Bitch, I'm swinging nunchucks and hitting you dumb fucks 
 And making you duck down like Ruck and Ruste Juxx 
 I'm eyeing you fat bitches and seeing which one fucks 
 I'm making the gun blust, I'm bringing the blood guts 
 Come on 
 I get it done for the (people, people) 
 I'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people) 
 I bring home the title to the (people, people) 
 I'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people) 
 I'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people) 
 This isn't money and a Grammy and an Academy Award 
 This a brutal lyrical verbal version of Gatti and Ward 
 If I bust in your eye, it might blind ya 
 As a kid I was too hyper, sniffing pancakes syrup from Aunt Jemima 
 Sip wine with Jesus till I'm in a drunken stupor 
 Then I slap box God and sumo wrestle with Buddha 
 I ain't dumbing it down, I'm murdering and gunning it down 
 These others artists I'm above them even if I'm under the ground 
 A rapper with a Maybach or a car that my ass can't afford 
 I'll rip out the windshield and I'll shit on your dashboard 
 Don't make me laugh, young blood newcomer 
 Your mother was a crackhead, you a crack baby fresh out of the dumpster 
 Smacking ya, hurt ya, I murk ya, massacre mass murder 
 Blasting your ass, stashing the burner, the trash lurker 
 I'm worser than Rambo in Bhurma 
 I'm dumb in the head, I'm not a fast learner 
 The white boy version of Nat Turner 
 Come on 
 I get it done for the (people, people) 
 I'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people) 
 I bring home the title to the (people, people) 
 I'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people) 
 I'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people) 
 Tommy Hearns Marvelous Marvin Hagler with the vernacular 
 Bullets splattering through your kidney and flying out the back of ya 
 I'm shining like diamonds in Africa 
 I'm mathematical, scientifical like Benjamin Banneker 
 Rowdier than riots in Attica 
 I got identity issues, it's self hatred, a pissed off 
 Wigga acting like I just stepped off of the slaveship 
 I kill any beat, murder any track 
 Mutilate the snare, rape the kick-drum and shit on the hi-hat 
 Come on 
 I get it done for the (people, people) 
 I'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people) 
 I bring home the title to the (people, people) 
 I'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people) 
 I let it rock for the (people, people) 
 I'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people) 
 I really live for the (people, people) 
 I'll win it all for the (people, people) 
 That's what we are, we just (people, people) 
 I'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)
