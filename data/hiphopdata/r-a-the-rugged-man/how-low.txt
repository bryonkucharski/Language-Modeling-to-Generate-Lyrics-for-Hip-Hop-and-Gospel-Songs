Ayyo, round and round, it's the new crew in town 
 The Mandingos, we get down, the Bad Brains 
 Rugged Man, yeah, we the type that ??? your chains 
 Underground shit in case you don't know our names 
 See I got hip hop flowin through my veins 
 Stop that crazy thing Jane 
 Jammin, the Germanan, Deutschlanden 
 Standin, who the fuck let the Rugged Man in 
 I'm like you don't know how we rock the show 
 And ya can't see how we bout to blow 
 It's like ???, off-beat guitar, he chubb, with the heat up 
 ??? 
 You're a gangster right, why you're scared to fight? 
 I'm like Rugged Man eat yo, defeat yo 
 Educate yo, teach yo, to the beat yo 
 Rock rock on, baby, loose control 
 Get on the dancefloor 
 I'm like what you suckers can say to me? 
 Throw your hands in the air if you fuck for free 
 And girls put that hands up if you make money 
 And ??? hoes, you ain't gettin' shit from me 
 ???, Cock the hammer, body slammer, that's the way am I 
 Now party people in the place to be 
 You see the Rugged Man rock on the m-i-c 
 Capital W, H, I, T, E 
 Ain't no one rapper out there can fuck with me 
 Who we? We the D-I-double B 
 Do your homework, let 'em know your history 
 Hypnotic, hot shit robotic, dirty dance erotic 
 Get, get retarded 
 If you ain't got a nickel to your name 
 And you still bringin' home none with you then scream 
 You got a big fat nice juicy fat behind 
 You over 200 pounds, I'ma make you mine 
 See you in the club ??? bump and grind 
 Let's party like it's 1999 
 ??? 2000 Queens, NYC 
 Suffolk County, me, Washington D.C. 
 All the dirty white people, raise the roof 
 All the dirty black people, raise the roof 
 ??? Hand in hand, this ain't just your ordinary jam, it's the Mandingo fam 
 And if you got big titties and a big fat ass 
 All the women in the house go get that cash 
 You see nobody messin with the Rugged Man 
 I'm back by unpopular demand
