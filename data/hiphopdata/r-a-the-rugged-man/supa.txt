Yo yo yo 
 Miraculously the blacklist could not rid me 
 Sissy pigs frisk me, it's me 
 Everybody in the club tipsy 
 Fuck that, bring hip hop back to New York city 
 Get busy with the white grizzly, wiggy wiggy wiggy 
 Blowtorch leave ya ass crispy - hidden delivery 
 No tricking me with evil and trickery, history, misery 
 Mystery like Agatha Christie 
 My enemies wanna physically cripple me, bitch strictly 
 Specifically wordplay, Slick Ricky, I'm slicker than Slick Ricky 
 I'm the top notch, the elite, we meet, me defeat 
 Me be beat, repeat in this street life is cheap 
 Baa baa black sheep, no shoes, dirt black feet, pack heat 
 Track meet run from cops, ghetto athlete 
 I'm back that deep, you lack lyrical heat 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I used to sneak in windows and steal Nintendos 
 Pimp hoes, white mandingos, I wear black, I don't wear pink clothes 
 Suffolk county anything goes 
 Why you trying to copy my shit like Kinkos? 
 I drop brickloads, sick flows, I done did those 
 Hit hoes, ripped shows, quotables kicked those 
 All the criminal shit and the sinning 
 They wanna know do I have a religion 
 Is there a god, do I believe in him? 
 Oh yes, how the fuck else could I be so blessed? 
 God put me on this earth to be one of the best (of all time) 
 And don't question it, it's a definite 
 The all time best in it, kept in it, repping it 
 The last one left in it 
 I'm A plus, you get a F in it 
 Negative, pessimist, effortless 
 Caucasoid, leprosy, lepedist, method in repping this 
 Fresher, so fresh in this, catching the specialist 
 I'm ol' D, special K, treacherous, I'm supaaa 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I gets papers in small amounts 
 Ooga booga bounce 
 Small fry born 4 pounds 8 ounce 
 I like to drink, milk, it helps me grow 
 And think like a champ 
 Suckers I vamp 
 I, I don't care, I'm ugly as shit bitch 
 Stop and stare, American nightmare 
 I'm super duper, I'm the newschool 
 Of the oldschool school 
 Voice is smoother than Luther 
 Don't let the ugly grill piece fool ya 
 I'm Kostya Tszyu, you Zab Judah 
 Two rounds through ya forget the past, I'm the future 
 Crowd mover, I'm super duper duper 
 Supa supa supa 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa) 
 I'm supa (supa, supa)
