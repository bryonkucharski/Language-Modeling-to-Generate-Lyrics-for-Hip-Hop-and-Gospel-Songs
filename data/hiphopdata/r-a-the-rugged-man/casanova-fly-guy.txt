(R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 Yo, yo 
 I'm the headliner, the first white pornographic rhymer 
 Banned local bar fighter 
 Hide your kids, pedophiler 
 Lowlifer, advise ya 
 I'm the world's illest rhyme writer 
 You play the background, like Casanova Rud 
 I'm a underground legend, slashin blood 
 TLC was talkin' 'bout me when they wrote No Scrubs 
 I'm the shit talking rapper all the dirty hoes love 
 These little white boy MC's tryin' to be like me 
 Whitey, the first white MC to be grimy 
 Back when Just-Ice was kickin that 
 Fuck shit ass bitch your mother's dick shit 
 That's when it all started 
 Walk down the street with a shotgun 
 Totin on jackets, trenchcoats 
 Look like Inspector Gadgets 
 "Look at that fat fuck over there 
 A ugly white dude with the big gut and shoulder hair 
 Look at the clothes he wear, barefoot 
 No shoes on, do even own a pair 
 Smell the odor over there" 
 Obvious, he don't care 
 He's a 
 Fly guy, hey oh 
 A fly guy, oh oh 
 "Casanova" 
 Oh, ouee, oh 
 A fly guy, oh oh "fly... fly" 
 He's so fly 
 Fly guy, hey oh 
 Fly guy, oh oh 
 "Casanova" 
 Oh, ouee, oh 
 A fly guy 
 Ooh, "fly... fly" 
 (R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 It's the Port Jeff, Long Island house party 
 Open the door, see the White Trash Army 
 We ??? religious, we ??? with us 
 Lizards, rip the bible 
 Write our own scriptures 
 Scripts kitsch fixtures, pussy lickers 
 Tongue blisters, the ol' school five-one-sixers 
 Opposite of winners, played slitchers 
 Hillbilly shit kickers, dick swing like Dirk Diggler 
 In case you not feelin' me, do you think that I give a fuck? 
 You, you, you 
 Bitch, you can't front on the pussy, guaranteed that I still get to fuck 
 You, you, you 
 You should wise up 
 Ignorant open your eyes up 
 Kidnap, tied up, gasoline, match, light up 
 You lied right up 
 Fuck your life up 
 Hate us?, You don't like us? 
 Join the club, sign up 
 I'm a 
 (R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 I'm a has-been known for boastin and braggin 
 Babblin, battle rappin', battle me, imagine 
 Staggerin, batterin the soul 
 Low blow, beat your bladder in 
 Hammerin your lips, Mick Jaggerin 
 Imagine everlastin like Jimmy Dean 'n' Marilyn 
 Gaggin in your mouth, put the barrel in 
 Better be swallowin, when you're scared to be in ??? 
 Or take the bullet and bite it 
 And write shit to make the whole world recite it 
 That's my final answer, I do a Cool J 
 And live my drawers in your hamper 
 Rugged man's temper 
 Dirty this, dirty dick shit 
 Dirty dick you can't piss with 
 Hit dirty bitch with shit 
 You get pissed of ??? shit 
 License to ill, Beastie Boys 
 I' ma autograph on your bitch tit 
 Yeah, I'm that guy that you all hatin' on with that bullshit album 
 Everybody waitin on, I'm a
