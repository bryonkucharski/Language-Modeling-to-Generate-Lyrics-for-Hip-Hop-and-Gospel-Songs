Yo, ayyo, I don't care what the people say 
 I'm a piece of shit, I'ma live my life this way 
 I'm a total fuck up, my whole album sucks 
 I spent half my advance gettin' cock sluts cocked up 
 If the bitch won't fuck she'll get chocked up 
 I went double platinum last month, then I woke up 
 When I was young I was a loser, but now I'm grown up 
 There ain't shit changed on, still broke as fuck 
 Oh, that there's the Rugged Man, he's a troublemaker 
 It's like work, Human Beatbox Bub will take ya 
 We double hate ya 
 See what these ??? are made of 
 Brought the dildo, you love the ??? 
 At the Academy Awards with Angelina Jolie 
 Ask her, the winner is the White Trash O.G. 
 Rugged Man, ??? Mayweather, Shane Mosley 
 "That's that dirty motherfucker!", yeah, you know me! 
 Ayyo, some people believe I'm fucked in the head 
 Some people believe I'm better off dead 
 Parents please don't let your kids listen to me 
 They might break out in the school, pull they dick out 
 Pull the full feoff out 
 Be like "Mister School Teacher, I ain't gotta do shit now!" 
 (Sit down, you, sit down) 
 Yeah, I'm mad negative, you want positivity? 
 Buy a Mos Def and Talib Kweli CD 
 In the music biz, Rugged Man known for his freaks 
 Used to bring groupie bitches up to fuck Mobb Deep 
 I brought Biggie Smalls to the Long Island "Whore Pit" 
 He boned the bitch in the bathroom and broke the toilet 
 Yeah, you said it, I'm a little bit strange 
 I don't think rational, I got no brains 
 I'm the last American hero 
 Real weirdo, real zero 
 Real deal, "Die Rugged Man!" 
 I'm like John Rifkind, stickin Nicole Kidman 
 Fist fuck, stick my whole fist in 
 I'm crazy but they won't listen, these hoes are trippin' 
 Go diggin hoes, coke up they nose sniffin, I'm cold pimpin' 
 Oh, I am the one that they say is crazy 
 Make way, the R.A. hateway 
 Make sure they pay, may lay 
 They say we crazay, make way (make way)
