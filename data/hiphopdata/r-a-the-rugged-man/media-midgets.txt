You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down 
 See, you ain't rocking for instance 
 You popping, but you robbing hip hop of traditions 
 You ain't rappers, you more like crooked politicians 
 Part of who's creation, new nation 
 Trying to fuck us with no lubrication 
 Raping, never losing to Lucifer Satan 
 Calling me Canaan the caveman in the cave, came close but never caved in 
 The false image of a prophet you praising 
 You living in a nation living in intidimation 
 Due to primitive media manipulation 
 Terror tactics and intidimation, we lack innovation 
 Looking for more fame they control your brain 
 The gullible puppets of the public get played like a board game 
 Get your jaw reconstructed, I ain't no puppet 
 Ain't throwing up no diamonds, here's the middle finger, go shove it 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is 
 Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 You can murder me before I let you take control 
 (My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul) 
 Telling you their lies and you believe in it 
 The mob minded media mentality speaking to the 
 Insecure sheep looking for leadership 
 Television producers looking for losers 
 Looking for stupider viewers 
 The advertisers dumb it down to consumers 
 You lost your integrity, you sold your soul for fame and fortune 
 You the fetus, I'm the rusty hanger in the back alley abortion 
 You ain't stopping the progression 
 My musical expression always got them guessing 
 Whem I'm dropping a lesson let it rot in your intestines 
 And why so many folks is jealous that I was co-signed by Biggie? 
 Internet nerds rewriting history lying saying he dissed me 
 I know in your small brains it might hurt 
 But I was there, the closest you ever got was wearing Biggie on your t-shirt 
 Whatever hype they supplying in advertising you buying 
 Let me guide and enlighten their lying 
 I ain't frightened of fighting 
 If you get offended by me and my honesty 
 Tell my publicist, she'll never find me making no public apology 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is 
 Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 You can murder me before I let you take control 
 (My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul) 
 Yo, from murdering children to dead soldiers to dead civilians 
 To the killings and the bombings of the buildings to borrowing trillions 
 Who's to blame when the brain of the next insane psycho flips? 
 Brain cells are programmed like they're membrane micro chips 
 I'm guns and Bible, I'm pro-life and pro-war, pro-fighting 
 Profanity writing, reciting 
 Gambling, tossing the dice and trifling 
 Riot inciting, no low lighting, no hiding 
 You wanna see the true racist? Just take look at Joe Biden 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is 
 Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements 
 Fuck the media posing as experts 
 Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks 
 You can murder me before I let you take control 
 (My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul) 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep down 
 You can't keep me down, you can't keep down 
 (My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)
