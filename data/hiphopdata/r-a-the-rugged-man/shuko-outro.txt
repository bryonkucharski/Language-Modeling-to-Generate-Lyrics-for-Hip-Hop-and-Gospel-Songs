All right y'all 
 To all my fans that are stuck with me through 
 All my career trials and tribulations 
 I love you motherfuckers for that 
 Legends Never Die 
 I mean, I had a lonely ass career 
 But honestly this album is only the beginning 
 I got so much more in store for you motherfuckers 
 I just wanna thank everybody for letting me be part of their lives through music 
 The album is officially over 
 Except, I got this one little personal joint 
 I'mma leave you with one more
