 Yo, yo that's some, that's some like, Stanley Kubrick 
 Stanley Kubrick 
 The track bouncy, no-body, get more rowdy 
 Than Suffolk County, peace to Crackhead Crowley 
 Honky Thomas, Keb McGlocklin the whole crew 
 Cab Morada, what you gon' do we roll through 
 Fuck that, Big Dirt, the midget face drop 'em 
 Bring 'em to the Port Jeff house stayed on top 'em 
 Nobody move this, I don't give a fuck, we untouched 
 Strictly lust for papers and live life to bust nuts 
 We're God killers, let's be realistic; 
 We probably gon' be punished - we fuckin' bitches by the 100's 
 Why me? Wanna fight me? Try me 
 Why these people don't know me - don't like me 
 Society, they wanna see me dead I stick out 
 You see me in the public, I probably pull my dick out 
 Smack the fuck out of women, see me knock your bitch out 
 Do somethin' tough guy, who the fuck wanna die? 
 Clash of the Titans, broken bottles, bar fight 
 You wanna battle I'ma freestyle you can start writin 
 I can do that, tip the bouncers, make sure we get 
 Our gats in the club just in case the action 
 Everybody want it, try to take my title 
 Let's see, left your chest messy, test me 
 Stanley Kubrick, don't stress me 
 R.A. the Rugged Man, remember the name - Rugged Man! 
 Ride with us (Rug y'know the bitch beater) 
 Ride with us (Suffolk County, Long Island) 
 Ride with us (Dead broke black people) 
 Ride with us (Dead broke white people) 
 Ride with us (My man Smoothe Da Hustler) 
 Ride with us (Rest in peace Jason Edmands) 
 Ride with us (Gordon Heights, ghostland) 
 Ride with us 
 Aiyyo the R-to-da, A-to-da, Rugged... *echoes* 
 Now think about this, who diss us? Suffolk County 
 Cops frisk us, they handcuffs never fit us 
 Our wrists turn purple, that's why we act vicious 
 Plus if we die tomorrow, won't nobody miss us 
 Get half a page in The Source maybe, if that 
 It's a whole town of people actin' shady, where I live at 
 We spit lyrically releasin, you don't stop 
 Ain't nobody ceasin till your heartbeat stop beatin', bring it 
 You know where to find me; actin' like you lookin' for me 
 You saw me you walked right by me 
 A true test, the Rugged Man, the tru-est 
 The most violent, in the U.S., we see you stressed 
 Now take it easy, Fat Man greasy, sloppy 
 Peace to Khadafi, I'ma do this 
 They tried to stop me, way back in nine-four 
 You look into my future, I'ma probably die for it 
 We proud to be the lowest, low life losers 
 We flip your car over like Long Island steroid abusers 
 When they 'roid ragin, white boy caning 
 Let me do some explain, misbehaving 
 Rugged Man, hairy fat slob, unshaven 
 The Ten Commandments, we constantly disobeyin 
 Ride with us (Dirty crusty asses) 
 Ride with us (The whole Infamous Mobb) 
 Ride with us (My main man Akinyele) 
 Ride with us (The whole white trash nation) 
 Ride with us (All the Stony Brook kids) 
 Ride with us (All the Port Jeff kids) 
 Ride with us (My man Ev Casuchi) 
 Ride with us (Capital of Crime Lords) 
 Ride with us (Miguel the cop in the house) 
 Ride with us (Sho' nuff, Dave Greenberg) 
 Ride with us (All the starvin artists) 
 Ride with us (All the starvin artists) 
 Ride with us (All the starvin artists) 
 Ride with us (Rugged *echoes*)
