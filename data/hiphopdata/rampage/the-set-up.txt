I seen many MC's getten laid to rest 
 Under stress, shot through they're bullet proof vest 
 Now you wanna be hardcore 
 You were never an outlaw 
 Until you just came off tour 
 Yo you talk a good game, brothers around your way knows your name 
 They wanna burn you in the flame 
 The other day you told me that you bout some new steel 
 You was like "Yo Ramp, yo I'm keepin' it real" 
 The only type of real puttin' down your steel 
 Pick up your pen and show me you in it for real 
 Before the next man put you to the test 
 He's a killer, he's from a town called brownsvilla 
 Him and his whole click be movin out of town 
 When they get back your six feet underground 
 You didn't listen 
 You didn't play your position 
 They shot your baby bombs and she turned up missing 
 Some where in Whitehovas 
 Your ass is to blame 
 That's what happens when you enter the game 
 No matter who you are, you still catch a bullet scar 
 If you a rap star you won't go far 
 They wanna skin you alive, they know the type of jeep that you drive 
 You'll be dead by the end of night 
 No matter who you are, you still catch a bullet scar 
 If you rap star you won't go far 
 Now you on a run you can't see them son 
 You livin' by the sword plus you packin a gun 
 Now you on the S train talkin' about you going home 
 The brothers is in front of your door with the chrome 
 You sneak in through the back way 
 To that's nervous 
 They wanna get your moms before Sunday service 
 They wanna get your Pops before he goes to work 
 Even though he's a doctor or world expert 
 Yo they ripped your baby sister and threw her 
 In the ditch with your brother Mitch 
 He's an inside snitch 
 He told brothers where you rest and where you be 
 Now you upset 
 You wanna flea the country and lay low 
 In the East with this girl named Mes 
 Yo she works for the beach you and her in peace 
 She's a snake, all she do is hustle weight 
 Take the money and break 
 Sell it back up state 
 You can't sleep 
 So you keep your hand on your steel 
 Watch your back before a brother gets killed
