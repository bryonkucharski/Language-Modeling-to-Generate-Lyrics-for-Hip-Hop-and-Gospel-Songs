Verse One: 
 I can fall from a building and fall from the sky 
 Make a rapper wanna know why, who's the fall guy? 
 A lot of people wanted to know, what I was comin' with 
 The buzz was that the Boy Scout was the shit 
 Now I got to maintain in my rapper brain 
 Put a rapper rapper to shame, what's my effin name? 
 The Boy Scout, Rampage, still makes the hits 
 Straight from the Dungeon Shack with the rugged 
 Don't even hold me back my brain it start to work 
 I make, others do the dirt, because the Boy Scout, is the expert 
 I'm rated six from the new school ford, I'm the microphone lord 
 Don't cock block me, and put it on record 
 Cause you would get gunned down, in a blood bath 
 Niggaz don't know the half, the Boy Scout got a craft 
 Death to all, I'm havin' a ball, watchin motherfuckers fall 
 That's the way it is when ya bounce the ball 
 Nothin' but the dog in me, I'm smokin' niggaz like a chimney 
 Me and the Boy Scouts with the remedy 
 Pull up a chair it's a world premier, I'm about to bring it here 
 Just like 2 Black Guyz great, and I'm swift 
 I be the dope nigga for the nine-four 
 And I'm kickin down doors, score with a metaphor 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 Verse Two: 
 I'm comin' Off the Wall like my name was Michael Jackson 
 New attraction, I'm showin brothers I got action 
 Step to the Ramp the Boy Scout is here in nine-four 
 Wack rappers hit the floor 
 I know there's been competition, Ramp and Alge's on a mission 
 Plus we got crazy ambition 
 Now I walk around girls wanna say hi to me 
 'Cause I'm rollin' with Busta and the New School society 
 Some wanna see me 'cause I'm on another level 
 Skippedy-dippedy-whip and showin brothers I'm the rebel 
 Now I'm on the dash that's gonna last, I'm only fast 
 Whippin a rapper fuckin' ass 
 He didn't get enough of the Boy Scout stuff 
 That's why he got stuffed, plus his heart pump Cocoa Puffs 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 Verse Three: 
 Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an englishmon 
 Straight from Brooklyn, Crooklyn 
 Where I rest, as I'm puttin' two to your chest 
 The Boy Scout man is takin' no arrests 
 Rappers try to hold me about a buck and some change 
 Now I'm goin' midrange, wreckin my brains 
 Some wanna bite my name just to get fame 
 You know that fuckin' game, yo Bin toss 'em in the flame 
 Like the infrared, of the words that I said 
 Killin' rapper niggaz dead, and I'm goin' straigh to the head 
 Another bad creation, ramp is on station 
 I got my foul MC, to build a bigger nation 
 I'm droppin' hard just like your girl on the Kotex 
 Like Funkmaster Flex on my brain it's like Memorex 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack 
 With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks 
 Beware of the rampsack
