I keep on fallin' 
 In and out of love 
 With you 
 Sometimes I love ya 
 Sometimes you make me blue 
 Sometimes I feel good 
 At times I feel used 
 Lovin' you darlin' 
 Makes me so confused 
 I keep on 
 Fallin' 
 In and out of love with you 
 I never loved someone 
 The way that I love you 
 Oh, oh, I never felt this way 
 How do you give me so much pleasure 
 And cause me so much pain 
 Just when I think 
 I've taken more than would a fool 
 I start fallin' back in love with you 
 I keep on 
 Fallin' 
 In and out of love with you 
 I never loved someone 
 The way that I love you 
 Oh baby 
 I, I, I, I'm fallin' 
 I, I, I, I'm fallin' 
 Fall 
 I keep on 
 Fallin' 
 In and out of love with you 
 I never loved someone 
 The way that I love you 
 I'm fallin' 
 In and out of love with you 
 I never loved someone 
 The way that I love you 
 I'm fallin' 
 In and out of love with you 
 I never loved someone 
 The way that I love you 
 What?
