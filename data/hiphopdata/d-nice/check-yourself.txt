You know, $hort 
 A lotta people out there wanna be my friend, you know 
 Just because I got a little hit record out, you know I'm sayin' 
 I know, I know 
 Rap groupies, you know 
 He-he 
 Definitely rap groupies 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yo, we should do a little somethin' for em, you know 
 Check em 
 Let's just check em 
 Check 'em real quick 
 Let's check em, man 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else 
 Now I can recall the first time I was out on tour 
 With my boy Too $hort, leavin' everyone in awe 
 I met this little honey, she said, "Hi, my name is Bunny" 
 I never would have thought she was out for my money 
 Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit 
 Equipped with hips that'll break your whole shit 
 But before that I can get a chance to knock it 
 The goldigger's goldiggin' in my pocket 
 First she tried to say that she was playin' 
 She must have thought I was a fool 'cause she was sayin' 
 "Ugh, oh D-Nice, I want you, I want you" 
 I wouldn't try to trust her even if I want to 
 I wanted just to smack her in the face 
 But hittin' females is just a bad mistake 
 I guess tryin' to get your money is a hobby or a sport 
 Cause next she tried to kick it to my boy Too $hort 
 It's kinda funny: you want money from a pimp 
 (Bitch) you're thinkin' like fifty percent 
 I put my foot in your ass and then I owe you the rest 
 I know the game, hoe, 'cause I'm the best 
 Playin' broads ain't based on luck 
 You want money? I want a fuck 
 And after we do all that 
 I'm takin' my money back 
 Bitch, kiss my pimpin' ass 
 Cause all the time I didn't have this cash 
 You wouldn't call, wouldn't give me a number 
 I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder 
 I made a hit record, now I got money 
 You wanna play $hort Dog for a dummy 
 You're so cool cause you think I'm rich 
 You know you wanna be my bitch 
 I'm not single, baby, not for you 
 Fuck a bitch, and that's the goddamn truth 
 If I was you, I wouldn't hold my breath 
 Cause all you money-hungry hoes might starve to death 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else 
 Now I'm not tryin' to come down too hard 
 If you need some money, you should go and get a job 
 But this one does not go out to all women 
 Just those who try to kick game for a livin' 
 'Cause I'm not the one to be played 
 So don't step to me when you wanna get paid 
 'Cause you're the type of woman that survives on greed 
 Yo $hort, won't you tell her what she needs 
 What you need is some type of financial support 
 You won't get shit from your boy Too $hort 
 I don't pay bitches and never will 
 I'm too busy tryin' to pay my bills 
 I understand your reason for tryin' 
 But I been mackin' since '79 
 You better check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Short Dog's in the muthafuckin house, bitch 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else 
 I know that you're are out for my wealth 
 You better just check yourself 
 Cause in these days we don't go for that 
 So you better try someone else
