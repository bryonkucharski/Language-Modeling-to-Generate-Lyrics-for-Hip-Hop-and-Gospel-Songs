I grew up in the city where everything is rough 
 Where everywhere I turn, I seen somebody gettin' bust 
 Plus everywhere I look 
 All I could see is a crackhead or a goddamned crook 
 Runnin' around with a pistol or a blade 
 Stickin' up -- in other words, gettin' paid 
 But I chose not to follow those ways 
 Cause the only place you headin' is to jail or the grave 
 But on the other hand 
 I know a man named Stan 
 Who in the future had plans 
 To be successful on his quest to 
 Take his moms and pops out the ghetto 
 But that plan was soon to be crushed 
 When one day he realized he must 
 Get a better job to pay for his schoolin 
 While his friends would sit around just coolin 
 He applied for a job in the system 
 And everywhere he looked, everybody would diss him 
 He doesn't have any type of skill 
 And life is not all games, it's real 
 He took a long walk down the street 
 Tryin' to think of a way to make his ends meet, huh 
 So he could buy the fly things he adored 
 And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more 
 As he walked home, he thought to himself 
 Now what am I supposed to do to get wealth 
 He felt that his life was worthless 
 Then he ran into his man named Curtis 
 Now Curtis, he's the type that stops and brags 
 About all the things he's got 
 Drivin' a Saab with a black ragtop 
 Come to find out Curt's workin' for the cops 
 He told Stan there's a job that's open 
 Makin' it all sound good, just hopin he would take it 
 Yup, and like a big dummy 
 Stan said "Freak it, yo, I need the money" 
 Curt took Stan to meet his boss 
 Officer Sims, a sergeant on the force 
 He gave him a gun and Stan began 
 His new career as a damn hit man 
 His boss really liked his work 
 And gave the boot to his partner Curt 
 He didn't realize what he was in for 
 And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more 
 A few dollars more is what he started to make 
 Now he's drivin' around a Saab, with a house upstate 
 He got gold and diamond rings 
 Crazy girls and all those glamorous things 
 But one day this life-style end 
 When one afternoon while hangin' with a friend 
 Sittin' in the park, drinkin' quarts of beer 
 And somebody said "Throw your hands in the air, 
 It's a stick-up" and put the gun to his head 
 And said, "Make another move and you're dead" 
 Now Stan had to make is choice 
 He paused and said I recognize that voice 
 Huh, where have I heard this 
 Now he remember, it's his man named Curtis 
 Curtis is mad and felt he'd been robbed 
 "Cause Stan is drivin' around in his Saab 
 He looked at Stan and said, "I can't believe him, 
 Now its' time for me to get even" 
 Stan made a move real quick 
 Curt jumped back and said, "Yo, that's it" 
 Shot him in the back of his head with a nine 
 Reached in his pocket, grabbed his cash and then dashed 
 Now here lies the man on the side 
 The same way he lived was the same way he died 
 He never knew what he had in store 
 And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more
