("So much drama in the..." -- Snoop Doggy Dogg) 
 Verse One: Ras Kass 
 No disrespect to the opposite sex 
 But I ain't flexed punani yet that's worth my royalty checks 
 Men be trying to get laid, women be trying to get paid 
 So, somebody gotta get played... {right} 
 Now you claim I'm runnin' game and still let us run the train 
 Pulling Coolio's braids, it wasn't me, it was the fame 
 Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen 
 Ass hangin' out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin 
 Damn I love civilization 
 Wants to know my occupation home location and means of transportation 
 The correct combination unlocked your placenta 
 I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna 
 On a three story house, drive a four door Ac 
 Favorite song of all time Mobb Deep's "Hit It From the Back" 
 Then jet, I turn a bitch into my favorite 
 She know my name 'cause I got more game than Sega CD 
 Chorus: Coolio, Ras Kass 
 You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
 You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 
 You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
 You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 
 Verse Two: Ras Kass 
 I try U.N.I.T.Y. but why? 
 'Cause when I was lackin, bitches made me want to roll over and die 
 So now I lie, cause bitches are like flies {why?} 
 They attract to the best shit {oh!} 
 You gotta play Max Julian's role unless you plan on being celibate 
 Cause bitches want the money clip and whatever dick that comes with it 
 {The bitch} saw me in the Lex and didn't know it came from Avis 
 Now she's on the Tip like my name was John Davis 
 And I'm knowin' what she thinks {what?} 
 I'ma sweep her off her feet because I bought the hoe a drink 
 Bitch, haha yeah I'm living nice, got a two o'clock flight to Atlanta 
 {Tomorrow} so maybe we can kick it {tonight} 
 Right there I knew my dick was getting wetted 
 'Cause I played into this bitch's Cinderella complex 
 Whatever you want to hear, I can say 
 Forget the bitch the next day, instant replay 
 Verse Three: Coolio 
 Yo Ras, let me talk about these bitches for a minute 
 But let's get it straight, when I say the word bitch 
 I don't mean all women 
 Cause hookers come a dime a dozen if you thought they wasn't 
 You can hit this hoe today, and tomorrow you can hit her cousin 
 Or her mama, you gots to have drama 
 Nigga flash some currency and go up in her auntie! 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the skanless type loc 
 You know the type that seem to like the taste of swipe 
 Check it 
 When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it 
 Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass 
 But as soon as the hoe tried to get in my pocket 
 I shot her ass away from me *schch* like a skyrocket 
 Take it from a G, period, no comma, to keep these hookers 
 On they toes... you know the rest
