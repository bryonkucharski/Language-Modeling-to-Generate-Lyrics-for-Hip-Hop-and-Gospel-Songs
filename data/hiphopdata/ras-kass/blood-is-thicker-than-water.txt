Like sand through an hour glass 
 I sift through the past 
 In retrospect 
 And recollect 
 The circumstances 
 Creating ras kass miosis 
 X Y genes, create the male human being 
 Like jeru damaja, I come clean 
 2 point 5 million years ago 
 My dna through 
 All my ancestors make me who I am today 
 And to my predecessors I paved the way 
 No time to eat swine 
 Standing on the county line 
 Hey, despite we endorsing this family fuedin 
 Domestic disputes 
 Your peeps mad as alfred e newman 
 And it took me some more time to see 
 When ain't nobody got your back you always got your family 
 So to me yo 
 You served that crack head bastard over your kin, you violatin 
 Just 'cause a nigga makes kids, doesn't make him a man or father 
 Who loves ya baby 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 From my grandmomma to my lil daughter 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 From my grandmomma to my lil daughter 
 And I, I never put a hoe before the homies, nigga 
 Seems like a short while ago 
 Me and byrd swore to god, we'd never stop playing with g I joe 
 Now we play with h, o, e' s's 
 Women with big breasts's's 
 And niggaz compete to bag the freshest bitch 
 But brothers stay true through thick and thin... 
 Clocked a major, knew all it really takes is a few good men 
 But couldn't stand the rain 
 After the pain of betrayal goes away 
 You learn a nigga ain't ur homey just because he knows your slave name 
 Lemont Le-Dale, Curtis Bryan and Jason Terrents 
 Revealed like a mason, but got 
 326 and 2 3rd more degrees 
 All you brothers got love like you was part of my family tree 
 I'm not anti-white but I'm pro black as hell 
 Gotta save myself first 
 My family and my race before I save some god damn whales 
 Let it surge through my veins like lava 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 From my grandmomma to my lil daughter 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Son, blood is thicker than water 
 From my grandmomma to my lil daughter 
 And I, I never put a hoe before the homies, nigga
