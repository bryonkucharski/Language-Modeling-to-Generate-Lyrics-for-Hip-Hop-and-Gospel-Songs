Well I think I'm going out of my head 
 Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, 
 I think I'm, think I'm, think I'm... 
 Life's a bitch then you never come back... 
 Yo! peep the realness... 
 Verse One: 
 I'm a shadow of my former self 
 So when the sun sets west, 
 I rock and slap box with hip-hop; 
 'Cause its much harder to get props than it is to fall off and flop 
 I paid dues till I paid do nots. 
 And will never will what you say affect the outcome -- 
 See, momma always told me opinions are like assholes; 
 'Cause everyone has got one. 
 But you couldn't tell me shit if I stepped in it. 
 Once I enter psychosis, paranormal, focus I perplex niggas and niggettes, 
 I play this rap shit closer than gilettes against the neck and juglar vien 
 Blowing out my own fucking brain without lead projectiles, 
 Bled when I project styles and meanwhile, existence is a life sentence 
 And since I'm broke I take the risk, forced to hustle 
 'Cause raw power moves, require muscle knowing I'm going out trife 
 Already got one strike, two more and that's life without possibility of 
 Paroll 
 Having to stroll in my shoes ain't easy 
 Lookin' forward to 3 hots from a cell block fuckin' my fifi nigga feel me? 
 'Cause if it ain't the cancer sticks I hit this hypertension's gonna kill me 
 And fuck a platinum plaque, all I want is a niggas dap 
 And enough snaps to put clothes on my daughters back Steph. 
 See this without an optometrist I'm stuck in the middle of this bitch - 
 Like ya momma's gynacologist. 
 Make a radio hit - headz criticize it; 
 Underground classic - nobody buys it: 
 So, rap is fucked 
 And everything blowing up sounds redundant 
 But money talks and bullshit does 9 flat in the hundred 
 And goddamn if I don't slam my wallets in danger 
 So I'm coming out like unborn baby's with hangers 
 And chronic stress is comtemplated so fuck being high Ras Kass is elevated 
 Well I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn 
 Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn 
 Well I think I'm going out of my head 
 Yes, I think I'm going out of my head 
 Verse Two: 
 Who can I blame 'cause my skull can't contain these thought waves 
 My syntax hydroplanes as though my brain 
 Slides over liquidated grains of asphault caught cranial calluses 
 Over analysis leads to paralysis, mediocrity my nemesis 
 Try to fuck every radical feminist I meet, call it engage and defeat 
 That's the reason why black men hide in the womb, homes 
 'Cause life is all taxes and tombstones 
 So as flesh and bone I zone my thoughts explode with rap shranel syntax; 
 That'll wax to the past, and present the future of Ras Kass lies in the 
 Skull 
 Like the coronal suture 
 So I write truly fat shit for the core audience 
 But sometimes I wonder does it really exist? 
 'Cause true lyricists in hip-hop Joe Public be dissin 
 Niggas don't relate 
 Elevate and its treated like elevator music 
 'Cause nigga don't listen 
 But ridicle is the burden of genius 
 Have you ever seen this socioeconomic gullitine rip? 
 A nigga's hopes and dreams 
 And now I'm lead to believe that life is all about CREAM 
 I'm living a life idealistically principle over profit 
 But realistically good intentions are micropic to fat pockets 
 Exploitation is world's oldest occupation 
 And it's the task of Jamaican chicken when a nigga gets jerked 
 Causing me to revert to verses - 
 Versus snapping like your neighborhood post office worker 
 (Before the Source and Rappages) 
 Niggas said my rhyme wasn't fly now I have the juice like Omar Epps 
 And crooked I 
 Fools be on my dick like foreskin 
 But what before then, so now when niggas prop me I'm skeptical 
 Becuz this rap shit is extremely unethical 
 And with slight notoriety comes anxiety 
 Now I'm supposed to play celebrity when nobody celebrated me at my D.O.B 
 And label reps wanna play me; 
 But I'm familar with record company rule #4080: 
 Fuck Luther and Sadie for talking food out my babies mouth denying sample 
 Clearance 
 I'm losing my mind 
 Outter body experience it's paranormal 
 I say it ain't all good though 
 So fuck the world with an AIDS infected dildo (doggy style) 
 Life's a bitch named monogamy -- you only get one -- 
 I'm trapped in this path of pathology 
 And I think I'm going out of my head, check it, reelishymn, reelishymn 
 Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, check it out, reelishymn, 
 Reelishymn 
 Well I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn 
 Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, it's the reelishymn 
 Well, I think I'm x 7, Yes, I think I'm x 7... <fade>
