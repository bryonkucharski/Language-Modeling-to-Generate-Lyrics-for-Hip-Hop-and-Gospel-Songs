Hook/Chorus: 
 Now I'm a rap fan who never saw Bam Rock the park 
 In the Bronx, but I still snap skulls in the dark 
 So can you recoginze shit is real 
 When I shove this ampex 4-9-9 up your rectum 
 I'm ready to bust every bitch niggas cherry 
 See these floods in January got me lookin' in the mirror 
 Screamin' Bloody Mary 
 Unnecessary representin', equal set trippin' 
 Divided by my tennis hoe pimpin' 
 Got all y'all niggas dippin', like Lipton Tea Bags, son 
 His stilo Jeet Kune Do the way of the intercepting fist 
 Intercepting every sublimial dis 
 Geographic, prejudice against increments of incredulos legislature 
 Pschologically, I masturbate with the hands of fate 
 So bust nuts on Mother Nature coming on your landscape 
 I'm pressing California license plate 
 For niggas in all 50 fucking states 
 But its biting me and fighting me 
 Inviting me to rhyme I can't hold it back 
 I'm lookin' for the line 
 Takin' off my lamb skin, Marc Buchanan 
 'Cause I'm a make you see L.A. (U.C.L.A.) like Ed O'Bannon 
 Nigga come in peace and brothers can kick it 
 But you ain't gonna walk me streets 
 When back east you sellin' wolf tickets 
 Reciprocate the player hatin' 
 Bring the bullshit to you 
 Going through yo coast, like the Green Gar GNU 
 Who said no is good gnews 
 But gniggas is gnot gnowing about the gnext shit that I be flowin' 
 So don't represent at my expense 
 It's too expensive 
 The first and last line of my definse is my sentence 
 You got causght off the coast of the Pacific Ocean 
 Found face down floatin' 
 With yo' fuckin' neck broken 
 I walk the planet and create tremors 
 If nnuttin' else here's all you need to remember 
 LLA'Y LLA KCUF for all you backwards niggas 
 Pschologically, we grapple an MC 
 Like Gracie at the UFC so place me in your octagon 
 Coward on mix tapes and interviews, I be hearing you 
 Certain dissiden'ts dis from a distance 
 Disresect and discriminate 
 Bitch I laminate that ass 
 And wear it at the New Music Seminar for a badge 
 Mash or get twisted 
 Dem gwan front like Rosa Parks 
 But them marks is broke wristed (bytch) 
 YOu got superiority complex 
 Based on old statisitics, now listen 
 Respect due to the pioneers 
 But what you burrogh did in 83' 
 Is ancient history brah' 
 So why these niggas actin' like 
 Since they live in the state 
 That rap originates 
 They automatically, all time greats? 
 It takes classic material to phat shit 
 Not proof of New York residence and an accent 
 Who expresses the freshest the 
 West Coast was ressurcted 
 By me, I'm the mother fuckin' man like homo erectus 
 So why it matter where rap started 
 If I wanted to hear from asshole I would have farted 
 I'm a West Coast artist down wit' clicks from 510 to 516 
 But dis indiscriminately and you sid me 
 Fundamentally is the ability to smother suckas 
 So if rap was born to another then that makes me your mothas-fucka 
 'Cause I'm the type of nigga to go to yo' show 
 Fuck yo' ho 
 Then nut on yo' promotional T-shirt 
 Eternally, verbally I fucks your head up like 
 Florence and Normandie (Easily I approach) 
 Hook: repeat 8X
