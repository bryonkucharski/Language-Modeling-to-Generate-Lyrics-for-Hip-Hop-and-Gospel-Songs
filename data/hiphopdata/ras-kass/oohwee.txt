(Ras Kass) 
 Everything I say don't be yae yo 
 Haters in batter rams, I slam 
 Like syringes in heroine, four hundred and fifty grams 
 Overdose, every coast, one hundred spokes chrome 
 Knock off some malt liquor by the malzatof 
 Don't gotta floss, huh, ain't that the truth 
 Flyin in boobies, silver six hundred Coup 
 Like whoop whoop, holla at me big baby 
 Sop me up wit a biscuit, 'cause you know it's all gravy 
 Linquistical flow, I ain't Mystikal, but y'all ain't ready 
 If a nigga don't rhyme about crack, clothes, pussy and fatty 
 Eat a dick, that's music to my balls, 
 Like Gloria Estefan fuckin' Hakeem Olajuwon 
 How this black lil nigga get more head than a beauty salon 
 Guam, blowin' ya shit out like Chaka Khan 
 For sheezy, my favorite women is sleazy 
 Bisexual triplet freaks, forty five at they sexual peaks 
 I'm fuckin' three Tony's, like Rafael Saadiq 
 And got a trick up my life, manufacturin cheese 
 My matrix will triculate wit melodies 
 Rehabilitated hood rats, shake the specie 
 I'm tryin' to die filthy, rich and ruthless, I'm easy 
 See Austin niggas is know for flossin 
 But I still buy my T-shirts and socks from the slossin 
 (Chorus: Ras Kass and Curtis Daniels) 
 It's so must that I smash when I mash for me 
 Ask Cash -N- Gash, nobody ride for free 
 OohWee, they say Ras you a rider? 
 I reply wit "Hell yeah, I'm a rider" 
 I give it up for C. Austin 
 That's the city north of Long Beach, South Western Compton 
 They say Ras you a rider? 
 I reply wit "Hell yeah, I'm a rider" 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Watch me catch bitches, the llama and the patch bitches 
 Fuck sex whippin homey, don't even trip 
 I never seen a hood wit a retirement plan to medical benefits 
 I'm bout seein black folk wit chips, and hundred thousand dollars whips 
 Instead of monkey see, monkey power rule feelin' you wit banana clips 
 I plan to flip my manuscript, like dyslexics 
 To sed it, to bet it all, genetic telekinetic brawl 
 See I'm the difference between booty calls and blue balls 
 Telethon wit Lou Rawls, and bevelin two percent off the top 
 S-s-sorry, couldn't got to break mines off 
 Decapitated, so where's he headed? 
 I decapitate niggas, damage is bodily 
 Put your tire on flat, and kill by a gat like Enis Cosby 
 Ain't no problem hoe, recognize 
 (Ras Kass) 
 My tenant shoot pimpin' is more like twenty shoot 
 'Cause no woman love me like the wimmy do 
 I write raps while pullin the lent off my nut sack 
 You 50% butt crack, I mean half assed 
 MC's we discover the mathematic format 
 Beneath your north plan, I'm guaranteed to come will 
 Like a reverse doormat, 64% Sega, 80 proof Congac, 
 And toll free pagers 
 I'm still comin' out like I'm born babies wit hangers 
 My crew consist of millionaires, failures and gang bangers 
 The dangers of loaded language, my glock lick click 
 Got it made, me no fillet, pay then sat out like sway 
 Raid the police, 'cause they sellin more crack then latinos and blacks 
 See we knows the facts, how Europeans jack 
 I'm sellin Native Americans gats so they can take they land back
