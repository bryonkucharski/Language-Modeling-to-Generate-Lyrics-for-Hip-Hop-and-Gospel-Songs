Psssshh, I guess niggaz don't realize a good thing till it's gone 
 You know what I'm sayin' man? 
 Runnin' around in these streets trickin, shit's hard man 
 You know? But sometimes man 
 Fools be bringin' that shit on they god damn self 
 Verse One 
 Nappy headed nigga stigmatism at birth 
 Born to a family of four and so that makes me one-fourth 
 Of a dysfunctional home 
 I had a father who only stayed to see me grown 
 When I turned twelve he was gone 
 Alone, no role model 
 I used to watch my Granddaddy and Uncle hit the bottle 
 And then hit each other 
 Granddaddy beat Grandmother, but that's before my time 
 But I still see how it affected her mind 
 As a child I introverted, and drew pictures 
 While my mother prayed to Jesus reading King James scriptures 
 She used to take me to church so I could put money in the basket 
 Tell the preacher how she used to get her ass kicked 
 And me, I mastered the art of hatred 
 After pops left ran with my niggaz tryin' to take shit 
 Petty theft, I got caught a few times, but bust it 
 Life is a bitch so fuck it 
 In eighty-one I remember the night 
 I covered myself with baby powder, so my black ass could be light 
 Cause God is white, and Bo Derek is a ten 
 I hate my black skin, it's just a sin to be a nigga 
 Then again, I'm like the Frenchman, cause Granny's creole 
 And therefore, we're black French people 
 So I think it's best if I go to Catholic school 
 And study under nuns and then I'll be a Catholic fool 
 Cause none of these cults want none of us up 
 And don't none want to see none of us live to be adults, sheeit 
 No wonder brothers take lives for red and blue 
 It's the evil that men do 
 But every nigga on my block 
 Can't stop, and he won't stop, and he don't stop (repeat 4X) 
 Nigga, nigga wake yo' punk ass up nigga! 
 Nigga *smack* *smack* wake yo', wake yo' punk ass up! *siren* 
 (Where the fuck we at?) *helicopter* 
 Nigga, one time nigga 
 (Man I feel strange man, and I'm fin to go man) 
 Shit, I'ma get you out, shit, bitches man) 
 (Fuck that shit man, nigga what the fuck am I gonna do man?) *siren* 
 We go make another gold LP nigga stop trippin' nigga 
 Nigga we own a gold LP, nigga stop trippin'! 
 Verse Two 
 By the time I hit adolescence and found hair on my nuts 
 I grew twelve inches so now it's time to fuck sluts 
 Never respected women, just had to keep my dick wet 
 Fucked this virgin named Lena, I made a bet 
 With my homies I could hit it first, then kicked her to the curb 
 Till next year, I got a call from my man Kurt 
 Since I never used jims I left a seed in the Earth 
 That left a nigga feelin' like dirt 
 Cause now I'm a father, and got a two-week old daughter 
 Ironically, don't even know her name it's a damn shame 
 And ol girl never told me she was havin' my baby 
 The more I thought about, she fuckin' played me 
 Cause the family's lookin' at me like I raped her 
 Plus with another fuckin' mouth to feed I need paper 
 Did a caper, and took my Guinness Stout to the head 
 September 1990, drunk drivin', the light turned red 
 Somebody hit from the rear, I hit the brakes 
 Then lost control of the steering wheel 
 Hit a black Camaro and that's all I remember that night 
 I woke up to a five-oh flashlight 
 The car that I hit had exploded on impact 
 One woman escaped, but the driver was trapped, he burned to death 
 Manslaughter, off to C-Y-A 
 Liftin weights in the yard and playin' spades all day 
 Now I'm eighteen, hit the County in the mix 
 "Name and last three!" Austin, oh-six-six 
 By now Grandpa went crazy and my Uncle had died 
 And me I'm at the ranch makin' pruno in Wayside 
 In ninety-three, I got probation 
 Searchin for an occupation, cause now I'm pickin' restitution, confusion 
 I'm lookin' at myself and seein every other nigga I knew 
 It's the evil that men do 
 Chorus (to fade)
