We Could marinate, get nice and and stack riches 
 (But it's B.Y.O.B.) Bring your own bud, brew, and bitches 
 Ain't no set trippin', actin' ill and don't steal, for real 
 (You got's to chill) 
 I woke up in my Tommy Hilfigures boxers at 10 from a knock at the door 
 But why they at my door for? 
 Oh! My peep's they got a half gallon, smilin' 
 My talons totalled ten one empty round from putting it down 
 But now, my day is starting off Coca-Cola and Remy Martin 
 Some of the homeys from L.A. and Carson want to throw a private party today 
 Threw on some Gautier and my Rolex link dressed to kill like Bernard Getts 
 My squad flex like Lee Haney, so its best I keeps myself on house arrest 
 Cause you never know, maybe they might wind up at 429 Bauchet 
 Locked away, plus can't keep the boody calls waiting 
 I'm marinatin' 
 Dialed up some micehead to see what's crackin' tonight 
 She said she just broke up with her man 
 And since she free like Mnadela, she bringina box of Philly pantellas 
 Acapells, I game like Lou Panella made sure to tell her 
 Don't bring no fellas, cherral, girl you can braid the tweed 
 And then you can show me how to do the pepper seed 
 Agreeded, 'cause we get down like this on a regular, loungin' 
 Watchin' bootleged tapes, shooting jokes, your choice of imported smokes 
 Craps and Celo on the patio for more chips than Bingo 
 Chips like the MGM casino 
 Just make sure your homegirl is single, so it's popping 
 Cause ain't nothing worse than fifth wheels that's cockblocking 
 And knocking while I"m knocking talking about she ret' to go 
 I want some of your brown sugar while I bump D'Angelo 
 (Fo'sho) No special holiday, but sometiems just being alive is a reason for 
 Celebratin' 
 So we mariniatin' 
 I get around like Dolby Pro Logic, 
 But running them streets too much get fools hated 
 Incarcerated, or terminated 
 At the house we safely intoxicated, Nonoxol-9 lubricated 
 Playing questions, everybodys faded and now, we got the ladies undressing 
 Like 1st King strippers bouncin' on nigggas balls like the LA Clippers 
 The phone rang, my little shorty said "What you up to, boo?" 
 Nothing, just chillin' like bruh-man on Martin do 
 See only when I'm tipsy, when my words start slurring 
 Do I get causght telling lies like Mark Furhaman 
 So I'll call you later drink was low, went to the stash and pulled out the 
 XO 
 The T.U.'s is down for whatever 
 Let's run more trains than the metrorail but y'all got to be out by two 
 I'm getting sleepy and plus my boo is coming through 
 So let the front door hit you where Ru Paul probably might 
 And everybody asking what's up for tomorrow night
