Verse One: 
 Stay in school was the motto, but I'd rather hit lotto 
 Swallow a shot of tequila but leave the worm in the bottle 
 In the spot with a BAC of .13 
 And when my voice hits the mic I electrocute Spit like Beat Street 
 I lounge with a clique, thick as the '93 Freaknik 
 Smokin' a beadie, flippin the script like a hermaphrodite 
 So choose your weapon if ya got beef, chief 
 'Cause we can take it to the looseleaf sheets or concrete streets 
 Cause Ras not strapped is like LL without a hat 
 Syntax attacks, head cracks, they know David Horowitz would strike back 
 The night I got dice accidentally stepped on money's Nikes 
 He tried to break fool and threw a glass full of ice to incite the fight 
 But didn't know who flew heads 
 I got ??? like Ricky Randall takin' the legs off Chavez 
 Instead ya lose, he got punked for his shoes 
 Cause just like BB King I'm givin' niggaz the blues 
 Times is hard, brothers is frontin' but they ain't about nothin' 
 So ya won't catch me runnin' (x4) 
 Verse Two: 
 I step through crews as if they was holograms 
 Been inside of more vaginas than a diaphragm, so I don't give a damn 
 Kid, I am the man that you think you are 
 5'5" and throwing hooks like Abdul-Jabbar 
 Servin' these kids like pediatrics, practice the tactics 
 And suckers cover your head, just like a prophylactic does 
 Thought he wasn't when he was gettin' retarted 
 Rented a U-haul truck when the LA riot started 
 Slid my homeless brother a buck, and ducks duck 
 The verbal buck-buck, boo-ya, who ya 
 Figure will be stylin' when Cali is an island (FAT!) 
 It's my fault, my shake from Brooklyn to Vegas 
 The earthquakes on lyrics ya plates like San Andreas 
 Would be rumblin', you're not ready for my fly type of genre 
 I'll rock your world like ugly Wanda 
 Verse Three (LP Version): 
 Now money talks and bullshit walks in the street on the daily 
 And niggas pull my strings like a ukelele, but 
 I lust ruckus like I used to lust Halle Berry 
 But now I bat wack motherfuckers like Dave Justice 
 Must bust nuts 
 Because he's married 
 1 time this brother tried to step and thought the little guy was scar-ied 
 Tryin' to freak all up on the girl I was dancin' with like he's invincible 
 Not that the ho was important but it's the principle 
 Involved, I said, "Yo black this my lady pal" 
 The stupid nigga laughed and said, "Well she my bitch too now" 
 So what can you do when boys is men 
 Our self-image depends on the next man's scrimmage so I sin 
 Cause thou shalt not kill, but I tried my best 
 Left my fingerprints in his neck 
 I never understand why brothers try to act up on one another 
 But if the static is comin' 
 Fool, you won't catch me runnin' 
 Verse Three (EP Version): 
 Stop your flow like its menopause the men all pause 
 Cramp your style like P.M.S 
 Suckers checking for lumps in they chest 
 Like breast cancer 
 My stanza gets censorship from Reverend Calvin Butts 
 But he could suck my diction, dictation is ridiculous 
 Indicative of dictatorship 
 Today's four letter words were standard English until 1066 
 And ignorance is bliss 
 So as I sag my Ralph Lauren chaps 
 Walking into lyrical scraps 
 I'm knocking niggas off the map 
 See more stars than astronomy 
 Not near one can follow me 
 Thougts premeditated like two Melendez brothers 
 That's word to the father and the mother
