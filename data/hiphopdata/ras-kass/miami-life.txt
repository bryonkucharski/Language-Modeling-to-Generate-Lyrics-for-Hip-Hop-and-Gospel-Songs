Miami Life, at any price, keep my pockets right 
 Eff the po-lice, Miami Life ain't nuttin nice 
 Miami Life, at any price, keep my pockets right 
 Eff the po-lice, Miami Life ain't nuttin nice 
 Verse One: 
 I'm launchin rockets and SCUDs at Crockett and Tubbs 
 [And Tye] full of more Rum than a [Mai-Tai] again despite high 
 Schoolin, I be high refusin to listen to what the PTA say 
 Eff a four point oh GPA I got a five point oh GTA 
 Hittin the chop shop, with an ETA of 3 o'clock, so shake the spot 
 Like Luke and them girl with the Daisy Dukes 
 'Cause life's a beach and I forever be wearin my bathing suit 
 Met this Colombian mommy said her daddy traffic cavy 
 With government permission, no DEA intervention 
 Filthy rich and hit lines for recreation snortin coke up 
 But Pinoche's rollin', 'cause I don't know the next hoe be the loc'est 
 You still can't teach me or reach me with history 
 When the story is his, and who gets to be 
 The future Pablo Escobar don't need a diploma 
 Minimum wage the rest I'm livin' whale like Jonah 
 Verse Two: 
 Walk these streets with more Heat than Alonzo Mourning 
 Now how many toasters can these smokers keep pawning? 
 My school days was like Porky's 
 In class doin' the butt, on the hallway ditchin 
 Teacher's pet snitchin, but ain't no Miami Bass like the triple beam 
 So fool please, I move MC's like OZ's 
 I want more cheese than Kraft Ravioli 
 Got love like Chachi and Joni micraphone Michael Corleone 
 Only the homies really know me, but everybody 
 Want to dip in my Mixelplic [what part of the game is this?] 
 Keepin' CoInTelPro stickin into brothers like Velcro 
 Fightin felony convictions, a closer shave than Norelco 
 Well though, stay and lose it, I'm still official 
 [Why?] 'cause I'm on a roll like toilet tissue 
 [Rider] anything less would be uncivilized 
 At any price... Miami Life... 
 Verse Three: 
 Accept no Substitute 
 And I'ma make it known to specialists like Stallone 
 And Sharon Stone watchin your spot get blown 
 You don't even understand, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers 
 [Senator Bob Dole] and C. Delores Tucker 
 What the world needs is less free cheese 
 More white collar J-O-B's, these ghetto MP's 
 Stretchin fools on the block for crack rock 
 But part of power brokers is gettin' over like unprotected sex with Oprah 
 Float, like a Tournament of Roses parade 
 Sting, like a bee, but of course 
 I put my foot so deep in yo ass 
 The water in my knee will quench your thirst, I got juice freshly squeezed 
 Words 100 percent bom-Bay, made from more concentration than Minute Maid 
 Renegade rhyme ride ruckus non-fiction me and my kin 
 Slippin mickies and puttin' hickies on your chest 
 I never been seen like the Loch Ness... 
 ...Monster, heh, and now a word from our sponsor 
 Yeah, and now a word from our sponsor
