Chorus: (sampled from Black Moon's "How Many MC's Must Get Dissed") 
 Pen predator 
 Pen predator, et cetera et cetera (7X) 
 Pen predator, et cetera, yeah right 
 1st Pull: 
 Niggaz know it's about that time without a Schoolly D Gucci 
 I pop that pussy ass rapper and leave it up to Luke to Pop the Coochie 
 Truly a wretched steelo -- kept you Under Seige like Seagal 
 'Cause I housed more niggaz than that faggot named RuPaul 
 Y'all all suffer the consequences 
 I dispense dope sentences without a prescription 
 Prefixes asphyxiate bitches who flips linguistics 
 Representin the West, relevant to relentless sentences 
 If renegade rebels resent this wicked syntax (then jack) 
 Revert to revolution Ras reverse, reverberates 
 Revolvin with written retalliation, rate repetitious 
 Reflex flex, regret niggaz regress to less than recoup 
 When recording, I wreck, records 
 Reflect stupid, it's so much more than just another rap and sample 
 'Cause I model more styles than Naomi Campbell 
 See we been burning idiots with lyrical syphillis 
 Since E.S.T. was Ackniculous, the nickel slick meticulous 
 Ventriloquist when I throws my voice over the Western HemisFear 
 While my peers step over a Trail of Tears 
 Go get a job as a chandelier wit a glass jaw like dat 
 I brings the impact to fracture mandibles, and manhandle the youth 
 Since my mental exceeds every MC I've perceive credible 
 Now becomes edible, kid! 
 And yo, I'm D for wreckin when reputations collide 
 But zhoom dum da dum, dadada dum dum 
 Suicide it's a suicide 
 ("Pen predator, et cetera, et cetera") --> repeat 10X 
 ("Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right") 
 2nd Pull: 
 I pull bitches like a lesbian and could come the fuck off 
 With a vasectomy, in depth I be deeper than Bosses' recipe 
 Incite recitation forever Ras Rock Steady like Buck when breakin on ducks 
 Who get props by association 
 Buy if ya lyrics suck, then fuck ya record label's juice 
 Ock, I rock hip-hop non-stop and got more juice than Snapple 
 Intricate to simplistic stylistics I solicit 
 It gets niggaz open like fallopian ovulation 
 Fuckin' these kids like the Michael Jackson molestations 
 Sendin ya back as the U.S. Nation did AIDS infected refugee Haitians 
 Uh, yeah niggaz so what's the haps 
 You could put up ya dukes but in the West they bust caps 
 So bulletproof fists is the only way I'm gone miss, but peep this 
 My mental's the bullet, my tongue's the finger that pull it 
 Check the method, soundtrack voodoo uh and bamboo like strapped 
 Come better you, oh sorry verbal dyslexic 
 You better come strapped like bamboo and a voodoo soundtrack 
 And make sure not even one bar sounds wack (bitch) 
 'Cause we take the best shit and make it classic 
 Word to Guru, take two fuckin' pulls, and pass it
