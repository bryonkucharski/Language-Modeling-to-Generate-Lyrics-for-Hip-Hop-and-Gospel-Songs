One quarter HRSMN, one quarter stallion offspring 
 You ain't half the man my bars been 
 The Carhartt King, molecules spin 
 As we sit by the river and peel caterpillar skin 
 Capricorn was the first one born 
 It wasn't long before Aquarius was warned about the meteor storm 
 I go to Area 51 with my fifteen-year-old son 
 Riffles and guns, tasers on stun 
 Gemini Janus, dream merchant dangerous 
 Doctor Doom's stainless faces locked behind cages 
 Frustrated with the Scorpio with Cancer crustaceans 
 Pacing back and forth from the basement to the bus station 
 Lock horns with Taurus and Ares 
 Big house on the prairie, various versions of the Virgo Mary 
 Vendetta, light as a feather, heavy go-getter 
 Libra lawyers writing me letters to sue me for my cheddar 
 Sagittarius statues, black Jews in white shoes 
 In hues of dark reds and bright blues 
 I'm a lion in the shade, I'm heavily sedated so I behave 
 Drink Pisces tea and eat fish eggs 
 But this shit right here got legs 
 Run you right off the edge, wake up in bed next to a horse head 
 We the HRSMN
