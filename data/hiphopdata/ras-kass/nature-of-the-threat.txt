Let freedom ring with a buckshot, but not just yet 
 First we need to truly understand the nature of the threat 
 The pale man walks in the threshold of darkness 
 Roughly 20,000 years ago the first humans evolved 
 With the phenotypical trait, genetic recessive 
 Blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin 
 Albinism apparently was a sin to the original man, Africans 
 So the mutants traveled North of the equator 
 Called Europeans later, the first race haters 
 So here's the Devil's alpha to the beta 
 Cause history's best qualified to teach one 
 Quoting German philosopher Schopenhauer 
 "Every white man is a faded or a bleached one" 
 Migration created further mutation 
 Genetic drifts, evolution through recombination 
 Adaptation to the climate 
 As the Caucus Mountain man reverted to that of a primate 
 Savage Neanderthals, until the late Paleolithic age 
 That's when the Black Grimaldi man came 
 With the symbol of the dragon, fire and art 
 Check cave paintings in France and Spain to the Venus of Willendorf 
 Around 2000 B.C. Southern Russians migrate in small units 
 Those who travel West populated Europe 
 Those who went East settled in Iran, known as Aryans 
 1500 B.C. some crossed the Khyber Pass into India and 
 Created Hinduism, the first caste system, the origins of racism 
 A white dot on the forehead meant elite 
 The black dot - defeat; untrustable, untouchables 
 They wrote the holy Vedas in Sanskrit 
 That's the language that created Greek, German, Latin and English 
 Now the Minoans around 2000 B.C. 
 Starts on the island of Crete, in the Agean Sea 
 The Greek culture begins Western Civilization 
 But "Western Civilization" means "White Domination" 
 Myceneans learned from Kemet, called Egypt in Greek 
 It existed since at least 3000 B.C. 
 Creatin' geometry and astronomy 
 This knowledge influenced Plato, Socrates and Hippocrates 
 Cause Imhotep, the real father of medicine 
 Was worshiped in Greece and Rome in the form of a Black African 
 The word Africa comes from the Greek "Aphrike" 
 Meaning "without cold"; the word philosophy means "love of knowledge" 
 Stole from first man, Greek power expands 
 The first Greek fraternities band 
 The word gymnasium is Greek for "naked" 
 This was the place where adolescent boys were educated, and molested 
 This was accepted because Greek culture was homosexual 
 For example, Sappho trained girls on the island of Lesbos 
 Hence, the word lesbian (Ay let these dumb motherfuckers know) 
 December 25th, the birth of Saturn 
 A homosexual god, now check the historical pattern 
 December 25, now thought the birth of Christ 
 Was Saturnalia, when men got drunk, 
 Fucked each other then beat their wife 
 Fact is, it was still practiced, till they called it Christmas 
 So put a gerbil on your Christmas list 
 The Hellenistic Era, Alexander the Great 
 Conquers all the way to India leavin' four successor states 
 By the Fifth century B.C., R.O.M.E. 
 Succeeds to be the conqueror of Egypt and Greece 
 But had the threat of the Black Phoenicians in Sicily 
 The Punic Wars began 264 B.C. 
 The Black general Hannibal and Carthaginian Peace 
 In 146 B.C. Carthage fell after a six-month siege 
 Rome sold every citizen to slavery 
 The first genocide of history 
 And more bisexuality in sight; Julius Caesar was known as 
 "Every woman's husband and every man's wife" (Beotch!) 
 Spartacus Revolt, a slave rebellion that lost 
 Where 6,000 slaves was nailed on a cross 
 Cross? Aw, shit! Jesus Christ! Time for some-act-right 
 Christians get your facts right 
 Cause Christ was not his name 
 That's Greek for "One who is anointed" 
 Yeshua Ben Yosef was his name, do Christians know this? 
 So who do you praise, do you know his name? 
 Or do you do this in vain? 
 Accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave 
 Peep the description of historian Josephus 
 "Short, dark, with an underdeveloped beard was Jesus" 
 He had the Romans fearing revolution 
 The solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him 
 After being murdered by Pilate how can it be 
 These same white Romans established Christianity 
 Constantine would later see the cross in a dream 
 In his vision, it read "In Hoc Signo Vinces": 
 "In this sign we conquer" - Manifest Destiny 
 In 325 he convened the Nicean Creed 
 And separated God into three 
 Decided Jesus was born on December 25th 
 And raisin' on the third day is a myth 
 Plus to deceive us 
 Commissioned Michelangelo to paint white pictures of Jesus 
 He used his aunt, uncle, and nephew 
 Subconsciously that affects you 
 It makes you put white people closer to God 
 (Yo, 'The Man' got game like a motherfucker!) 
 True indeed, fuck it, Jihad 
 In the eight century Muslims conquered 
 Spain, Portugal and France and controlled it for 700 years 
 They never mention this in history class 
 Cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson 
 Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians 
 Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ 
 On November 25th, 1491 
 Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Grenada 
 King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory 
 And the Pope of Rome and declared this date to forever be 
 A day of "Thanksgiving" for all European Christians 
 Now listen, when you celebrate "Thanksgiving" 
 What you are actually celebratin' 
 Is the proclamation of the Pope of Rome 
 Who later, in league with Queen Isabella 
 Sent Cardinal Ximenos to Spain 
 To murder any blacks that resisted Christianity 
 These Moors, these black men and women 
 Were from Baghdad, Turkey 
 And today, you eat the turkey, for your "Thanksgiving" day 
 As the European Powers destroyed the Turkeys 
 Who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers 
 Now fight the power, you bitch-ass niggas! 
 Now around this time, Whites started callings us Negroes 
 That's Spanish for black object meaning we're not really people 
 But property, and the triangle trade begins - they seize us 
 Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus 
 Stealin' land from the indigenous natives 
 Gave them alcohol to keep the Red Man intoxicated 
 Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals 
 But up until 1848 there's documented cases 
 Of whites bein' the savage cannibals, eatin' Indians 
 In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer 
 They slaughtered a whole race with guns 
 Drugs, priests and nuns 
 1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfare 
 As tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery Amherst 
 Passed out clothin' and blankets to the Indian community 
 Infested with smallpox, knowin' they had no immunity 
 Today it's AIDS, you best believe it's man made 
 Cause ain't a damn thing changed... let me explain 
 Now since people of color are genetically dominant 
 And Caucasoids are genetically recessive 
 If Whites expect to be predominant, meaning survive as a race then 
 They simply must, take precautions 
 That's why they're worried about their future now 
 Cause by 2050, almost all the Earth's population 
 Will be brown, then black, so understandin' that, whites counter-react 
 (I'm sayin'... man... them fools 
 Ain't nothin' but a teaspoon of milk in the world color majority) 
 So they created a system 
 To force blacks into an unnatural position 
 That re-enforces the position of natural inferiority 
 In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view 
 That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do 
 Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized 
 And every other culture considered primitive - not true! 
 Racism is the system of racial subjugation against non-whites 
 In every areas of human relation 
 Entertainment, education, labor, politics 
 Law, religion, sex, war and economics 
 See blacks were 3/5ths of a man with tax purposes intended 
 You think you're Afro-American? 
 You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga 
 Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastika 
 But niggaz pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya 
 They never teach about the breaker islands like Jamaica 
 But before slaves came here whites would take a 
 Pregnant women, hang her from a tree by her toes 
 Slice her stomach with a knife 
 And let the unborn baby fall to the floor 
 And stop an unborn child in front of all the slaves 
 To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave 
 And not rebel more 
 Understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators 
 I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango 
 "Understand that regardless of the lofty ideas ingraved on paper 
 In such documents as the Constitution or Declaration 
 The basic nature of the European American white man 
 Remains virtually unchanged"... so check 
 This is the nature of the threat.
