I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 Catch me at the North Pole, living with the Inuits 
 Seal-skin hoody, hunting Saint Nich-o-las 
 European holidays and niggas so ignorant 
 Got Prancer and Blitzen's heads mounted in my kitchen, bitch (funny!) 
 My Uncle family, Jehova's witnesses 
 As kid's we thought they was crazy for not celebratin' shit 
 Went to college, learned Christmas is ridiculous 
 Pagan holidays, ain't no Christ in it 
 Cause a holiday, means a 'holy' day 
 And December 25th was the birth of the God Saturn 
 Ancient Romans would celebrate 
 The upper class worshipped Mithra 
 The God of the uncontrollable Sun 
 And that's Christmas 
 In the western hemisphere 
 December 22nd is the shortest day and longest night, of the year 
 Rains for 3 days, hence the Sun died 
 The Sun resurrects December 25 
 So the S-U-N, is the Sun of God 
 In man-made religion, metaphorical Son of God 
 Named him Amen-Rê, named him Saturn, named him Mithra, named him Christ, the same pattern 
 Ancient astrology, the Egyptians wrote this 
 Scientifically put, it's the Winter Solstice 
 And after the Catholic Church came to power 
 They absorbed festivals already popular 
 In the slave days, they gave us as gifts, fuck! 
 Bound us in metal chains and they whipped us 
 Went to church and smiled, right after they lynched us 
 You still a fucking slave if you celebrate Christ-mas! 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 Snow in Bethlehem is rare as fuck 
 Ain't no evergreens and reindeer, y'all is nuts 
 The history of Christmas is a mix of customs from pagans 
 Y'all clowns just decoratin' Satan 
 The Yule tree was first decorated in the 16th century 
 In Livonia in Germany 
 In northern Europe, the Druids during winter nights 
 Kept evergreens as a symbol of everlasting life 
 Vikings in Scandinavia went a little farther 
 Thought of the special plant of the Sun, got bolder 
 The Germanic tribes worshipped Amerigo - a flying white horse 
 Original Santa Clause, rode one of course 
 And the Dutch called him Sinterklaas 
 His sidekick, a demon named The Krampus 
 Bad children killer dawg 
 Sinterklaas myth, combined with Saint Nick 
 A 4th century Greek bishop who gave gifts 
 Said he liberated an Ethiopian from a slave ship 
 Who was so grateful he became his servant 
 It's so racist, the boy he called Peter 
 The origin of the elves is so fiendish 
 Black Peter in English, Zwarte Piet in Swedish 
 Why do you need this, look it up if you don't believe it 
 And even to this day in the Netherlands 
 They still dress up in blackface, now go to bed again 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 Listen 
 I respect fact over faith 
 The Catholic Church paves its celebrations on pagan dates 
 Culturally, every European participates 
 Then after the pilgrims emigrate to the United States 
 All those European customs assimilate 
 Forcibly imposed on every other race 
 New York city was first colonized by the Dutch fam 
 It was called New Amsterdam 
 Now I see a lot of sinners in dementia 
 Worshipping 70ft trees in Rockefeller centre 
 Stupid if you ain't Viking or a Druid 
 If you Christian and or black, you are fucking foolish 
 I've seen Miracle on 42nd Street, wasn't no Asians or Latinos, you disrespected me 
 Mental genocide, it's black lost 
 I'm just being real, this is fact from Jack Frost! 
 (Chorus + Ras Kass Outro) 
 We live in a country where 1% of the population controls 99% of the wealth. Where a black President kisses corporate American ass. Not one single criminal Wall Street banker spent the day in prison, but they'll arrest 5,000 peaceful Occupy Wall Street protestors. We in the biggest recession since the Great Depression, but y'all throw your fucking money away, 5.3 billion on Black Friday 
 You not just a stupid consumer, that's not capitalism, that's a slave mentality
