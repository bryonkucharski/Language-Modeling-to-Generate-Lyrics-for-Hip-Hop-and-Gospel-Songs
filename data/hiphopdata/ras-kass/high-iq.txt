(Scientist voice: 
 "Say, what do you suppose is the most important part of the body? 
 Some people say the feet, because we all have to walk. 
 Some say the eyes, because we all have to see. 
 Some say the heart...[voice becomes distorted]") 
 (You got emcees, you got entertainers, 
 And you got lyricists, which one are you?) 
 Brace yourself... impact... 
 Crack... BOOM... 
 Motherfuckers, 
 My molecular structure 
 Is that of an alien 
 Coming out a bald white bitch 
 On some shit that's wig-splittin' 
 Got niggas' heads dividing faster 
 Than nerds at a calculus convention 
 Beyond comprehension 
 I implement my mental 
 Over instrumentals 
 And it becomes as detrimental 
 To a nigga 
 As Tuskegee experiments with syphilis 
 The fundemental rudiments 
 Studying the phonics of yesteryear 
 Pioneers found buried in sediment plates 
 Trying to metrate alphabetics 
 It took two weeks to estimate the way the old school emcee's said it 
 I break down the elements 
 Of rocking a mic cable 
 Like a periodical table 
 Subject matter, (1) production (2), delivery (3) 
 With the collection of all three 
 Theoretically, 
 E = emcee squared 
 But there's a sucka born every minute, it appears 
 That's 1,440 a day, 
 525,600 redundant rappers a year 
 (Complex concepts) 
 And I'm positive as protons, 
 Niggas won't comprehend John 
 So fuck Bone, I'm bad to the chromosome 
 All 46 that dwell in each somatic cell 
 Could raise more hell 
 Than Darryl, Jones, Rusty, or Satan 
 Exercise my mind 
 And turn fat tracks to muscle 
 I come from every angle 
 Like 90 degrees in diameter 
 The Hemis chemist 
 Isolating isotopes 
 Under microscopes 
 I bioengineer (Jacob's Coil???) 
 Let your lens focus 
 Through osmosis, 
 Just standing next to me 
 I thought you knew (I thought you knew) 
 I'm the B-boy scientist 
 "With the high IQ"
