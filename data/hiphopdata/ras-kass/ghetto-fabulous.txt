Ras Kass 
 Once again, we take over cash 
 Ras Kass, Dr. Dre and Mack 10 connected 
 We ghetto fabulous, baby 
 The best food, drink and pussy that money can buy 
 Every day of my life is off the ringer 
 That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer 
 I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava 
 So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars 
 From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C. 
 We drinkin' V-S-O-P (?) the beats beep 
 Bangin', catch me with a dimepiece next to me 
 My Body all over Your Body like LSG 
 Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city, like the mayor 
 Rookies askin' us how to be a playa 
 Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked 
 No matter how much money you make 
 Stay true to the game, loc, guest list terror clothes 
 In jeans and tennis shoes, breakin' your strict dress codes 
 Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen deep 
 So I can be richer than Master P sellin 'Ghetto D'

 Dr. Dre 
 You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin' hard enough 
 Started in Compton servin' from a ice cream truck 
 Now, ten years later, whippin' a custom Navigator 
 Steppin' on your toes. playa, stuffin' up your alligators 
 I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me 
 Boom, bap and slap that ass silly 
 This is for the full time students slash part time strippers 
 And young niggas, clockin' at least five figures 
 Some of us pro athletes 
 Some of us rap over fat beats 
 Some of us hustle in the streets 
 Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle 
 Trickin' (?) off a pocket full of singles, huh 
 And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra 
 Pop a thirteen shot glock to make you go see the doctor 
 Ain't nuttin' nice 
 From hood to hood, love livin' the lavish life

 Ras Kass 
 Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS, three ooh ooh 
 Playin' number two Tekken, zero to sixty 
 In six point seven seconds, hangin' out the window 
 Actin' up, chickenheads like "You doin' fo' months" 
 Flexin' the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds 
 Across the face, still eatin' out foam cups and paper plates 
 We don't call it playa hatin' in the nine-eight, it's P.I. 
 That's pass interference, automatic first down 
 Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown 
 Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin' DK 
 Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say 
 "L.A. niggaz got crazy came 
 Like John Elway got a superbowl ring" 
 The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda 
 Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella
