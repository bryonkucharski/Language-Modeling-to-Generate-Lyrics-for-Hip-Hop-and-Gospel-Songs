[Ras] The beginnin' of the end niggaz! 
 [Can] Yeah, we goin' rock this shit forever 
 The alpha and the omega 
 The Canibus'll make your eyes redder 
 FUCK y'all niggaz talkin' bout cheddar 
 [Ras] Brought to you by your millennium group, The Horsemen 
 [Can] Four swordsmen 
 [Ras] From the land of the lost 
 [Can] Ras Kass, Killah Priest and Kurupt wit Can-I-bus 
 Throw your 4's up or get your vocal cords cut MOTHERFUCKER 
 [Both] Wavin' the four-four! 
 (Kurupt) 
 I'm headless nigga, but I packs a big piece 
 Blastin, they let assassins loose on the street 
 Murderous notes I wrote, I lacerate throats 
 I toss fire at niggaz; motherfuck the six 
 The condos is supposed to be flip bricks 
 All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga 
 I'll throw some fucked up kicks on 
 Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up 
 Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt 
 See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality 
 I'm a Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be 
 See I'm tired of the sparkly shit, niggaz talkin' shit 
 I want to see the streets dark again 
 Let the heaters spark again, police callin all cars often 
 Powerful as a motherfuckin Vulcan 
 My specialty is - poetically lyrically energetically 
 Ultra magnetically Dogg Pound pedigree 
 Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit 
 Dirty shit, holocaust in thirty-thirty shit 
 Missile flick assassin Sicilian 
 Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children 
 For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen 
 Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman 
 And we abide by, the code of the streets 
 The makings of a real MC (C... C... C... C) yeah bitch! 
 (Canibus) 
 So just abide by what you ride by 
 'Cause we abide, by what we ride by 
 Just abide by what you ride by 
 'Cause we abide, by what we ride by 
 (Killah Priest) 
 What the fuck y'all done started; four apocalyptic prophets 
 Appearin out of floatin' objects, wearin' Middle Eastern garments 
 Long trench coats with our hands in our pockets 
 Slappin' all you scary-ass rap artists, half-retarded 
 Swear by our forefathers 
 Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded 
 Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness 
 Bring you out the other side, as a carcas 
 I'm heartless, regardless if y'all claim to be Gods or Goddess 
 To me, y'all all garbage; I see all of y'all as movin targets 
 And my lyrics be the atomic rockets, cosmic vomic - spittin' 
 Hittin' at y'all Vietnam vets 
 Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest 
 Castin' meteor storms and comets 
 Now who want to make the next ras comment 
 And be the first one left unconscious? 
 After I squeeze your head like the Charmin 
 Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat 
 And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts 
 Satanically sacrifice your ass like an occult 
 Have your seance inside of a dark synagogue 
 We was lyrically sent to y'all 
 Like the Men of God to put a end to y'all 
 I sniff bites like dogs to get the scent of y'all 
 Horsemen, we be scorchin when we be walkin' 
 With the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Let's air it out like the breeze 
 Now watch me do one-armed handstands 
 And hang these N-you-T's over seven continents and seven seas 
 Streets is Lebanese 
 Be rockin' Bulgari wrist watches and sniper marines 
 Most of these MC's can't even rap, just model and go gold 
 And get big-headed like they swallowin colleges 
 I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em up 
 You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck 
 Me? I ain't even in my prime 
 When I write my dopest rhyme, Western civilization declines 
 Catch me hoppin off the A train in a New York state of mind 
 But I rep Westside, so I keep L.A. time 
 That's a three-hour difference; 
 So when my bitch is a six, she's really a nine 
 In seven days, she'd still be a dime 
 Call me Blaze Skywalker hittin jugular veins 
 Crack open your skull wit a paper weight and suck out your brains 
 Kiddo, I be doin' my thug-thizzo for shizzo 
 And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow 
 So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden 
 Since police be jackin blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin: 
 Uck-fay ou-yay itch-bay at-lay a-igga-nay-play, 
 And free Keith Mur-ray (Horsemen) 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 I kick a verse at six-hundred and sixty-six meghertz 
 Make lightnin flash across the sky every time I curse 
 Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes 
 Give out six-hundred and sixty-six lashes 
 To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six Master of Ceremony has-beens 
 Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is 
 If he's a *Catholic* I nail him to a crucifix 
 Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish 
 Then perform acupuncture wit six-hundred and sixty-six toothpicks 
 Beat 'em with two whips; with pieces of broken glass glued to it 
 Your whole crew get spayed and neutered 
 As soon as I aim and shoot it, you get sprayed with bullets 
 Your armored cars and your kevlar vest, is useless 
 I'm a fuck all of you pussies like group sex 
 You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment 
 For biting off another nigga's shit, you bitch 
 You got caught, now you on the other side of the law 
 Snitchin on mad niggaz in a soundproof court 
 To get some of your sentence knocked off (nah nigga) you wildin 
 But you still be in Riker's Island gettin' forced to toss salads 
 You scared of that, wit a phobia fear of that 
 I'm a tape it on the digital video DAT 
 And send a copy to Miramax - leave you exposed 
 Turn all the fiction to fact, so everybody will know 
 You a sucker-ass nigga, father-fuckin' ass nigga 
 That got fucked in the ass by your father figure 
 (No matter who?) I'll bruise and bash you, blast you 
 Autograph you wit a bullet wound for a tattoo 
 Deliverin mind blowin' rhymes and poems 
 Controllin my tongue when I'm flowin like pilot controlled Boeings 
 When I get bitten, I bite back, Quicker than Tyson attacks 
 I don't give a FUCK if I don't get my license back 
 So, take caution 
 The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then 
 Gallop Northward 
 MC's take caution 
 The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then 
 Gallop Northward motherfuckers; yeah 
 So just abide by, what your ride by 
 'Cause we abide by, what we ride by 
 Just abide by, what your ride by 
 'Cause we abide by what we ride by, HA! 
 (All) 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Priest, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Bis, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Ras, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! Aiyyo Kurupt, hit them niggaz wit the hardcore! 
 (Kurupt) 
 Yeah nigga, I'm headless without thoughts 
 With my motherfuckin arms crossed 
 I transform from a Dogg to a Horse 
 Took over the whole race course 
 To throw the jockey off the saddle 
 Now who the fuck really want to battle? 
 Got me a pistol, launch it off like a missile 
 Let it whistle, they fall fuckin' round wit the Dogg 
 I'm a hog... {*fades beyond audio*}
