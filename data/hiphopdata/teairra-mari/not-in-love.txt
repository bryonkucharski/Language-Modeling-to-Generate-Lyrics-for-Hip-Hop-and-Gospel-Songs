What the hell is this 
 Seems like THAT bullsh-t 
 And I CONSIST THAT we're through boy 
 But It's YOUR TONE AND you can lie if you want to 
 That doesn't mean I GOTTA believe it 
 Oh no 
 I ain't nicole and britney 
 I got to know you're with me 
 Don't need your money tricky 
 I got my own billy 
 Why do you lie to me 
 When we're together it's not you it's what you try to be 
 I know I gotta be 
 (I GOTTA BE) So right 
 And NOT say that you're tired of me 
 Wait wait wait let me catch my breath 
 'Cause I'm looking out for myself 
 Nobody's perfect but this isn't working 
 It's not hard to see THAT YOU'RE 
 You're not in love with me 
 Oh no 
 Baby and that's okay 
 Two can play at this game 
 CAUSE I'm not in love witchu no more 
 Ever since you've taken your heart away 
 We're not in love 
 No no 
 No we're not in love 
 Oh 
 No 
 No 
 You've been playing round 
 And it's too late now 
 For you to prove it to me 
 I wanted to see if we could be happy 
 And now I see who's fancy fancy 
 CHANCE OF A LIFETIME... you just passed it passed it 
 'Cause I thought we were inseparable 
 But I was wrong 
 I don't know what the fuck we're doing doing 
 But I know teairra is moving moving 
 To another scene 
 I gotta close this book 
 You thought you had me shook 
 But no 
 I told you that I couldn't stand A LIAR 
 So why boy 
 Would you leave me in the dark 
 And I try boy 
 To be faithful to you 
 Tell me what can I do 
 I was grateful for you 
 You're not in love 
 You're not in love with me 
 Oh no 
 Baby and that's okay 
 Two can play at this game 
 CAUSE I'm not in love witchu no more 
 Ever since you've taken your heart away 
 We're not in love 
 We're not in love 
 We're not in 
 We're not in 
 We're not in 
 You don't see my 
 Not one of my tears 
 Oh baby 
 And now it's time for you to let it go 
 'Cause I promise 
 It ain't working 
 You're not in love 
 You're not in love with me 
 Oh no 
 Baby and that's okay 
 Two can play at this game 
 I'm not in love witchu no more 
 Ever since you've taken your heart away
