Do you, 
 Do you have any idea what you do, do 
 So on point you make a liar 
 Tell the truth, truth 
 And on the low the hood is buzzin over you 
 But baby I got ya 
 I'm talking square, biz (biz) 
 I'm too cool to be glowin' like this (this) 
 After only a movie and a kiss 
 Baby you're the one (Yeah) 
 It's all much too much (Yeah) 
 But I can't get enough 
 I promise to stay in pocket 
 Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right 
 If I put my money on you every time 
 I know I'd bet right 
 Checkin' my call log 
 To see if I missed your call 
 While I was in the shower (Boy you got that) 
 Boy you got that act right 
 The way you love me 
 I swear that it's a life changer 
 If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper 
 Don't know what to do with you 
 OD'in over you 
 But I think I like it (Oh) 
 Boy you've got that 
 Oh, oh, look at me 
 I'm out of control ('trol) 
 Cell phone is dead so 
 I'm going to the corner store, store 
 To check my voice mail on the pay phone 
 Hope you left a message 
 Baby you're out cold, cold 
 Wanna say you're the shi- 
 But boy you're much more, more 
 What the streets call the reason 
 Baby you're the one (yeah) 
 It's all much too much (yeah) 
 But I can't get enough 
 I promise to stay in pocket 
 Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right (You got it) 
 If I put my money on you every time (Boy I know I would) 
 I know I'd bet right

 While I was in the shower (Oh) 
 Boy you got that act right 
 The way you love me 
 I swear that it's a life changer (It'd change a life, yeah) 
 If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper (Taking all my paper) 
 Don't know what to do with you 
 ODin over you 
 But I think I like it (Yes I am baby) 
 Boy you've got that 
 Oh 
 Never thought a hood chick (Never thought I could) 
 Could feel like I do (Feel this way, oh yeah) 
 Writing to the sky boy about you 
 In the daytime with a flashlight looking for you 
 Oh baby, baby (oh baby baby baby baby) 
 Oh 
 Never thought a hood chick 
 Could feel like I do (I put that on everything that I own) 
 Writing to the sky boy about you 
 In the daytime with a flashlight looking for you (Oh baby you've got me looking for you) 
 Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right (Oh my, you've got it) 
 If I put my money on you every time (If I put my money down)
