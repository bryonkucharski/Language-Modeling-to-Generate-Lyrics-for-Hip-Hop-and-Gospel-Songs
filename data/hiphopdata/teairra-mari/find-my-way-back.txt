You are like a habit and I know I gotta have it 
 Shoulda never ever ever let you go 
 Was the kind of situation that got my imagination running overtime I couldn't take no more no 
 But 
 Now that I know it's really over over 
 I just can't get it off my mind 
 That everything I had before I just let walk out the door 
 Now I want you back in my life 
 What what I'm gonna do cause without you 
 Baby nothing matters anymore 
 What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you 
 You 
 Not ready to let you go 
 (When you was with me) I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay 
 What what I'm gonna do 
 Is find my way back to you you 
 What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you 
 Please tell me you don't hate me 
 And that you just couldn't shake me 
 But I know the chances really aren't that good 
 That's somebody so amazing could be still out there waiting for someone who let's you be so misunderstood 
 Please don't tell me it's really ova ova 
 I just can't get it off my mind 
 That everything I had before I just let walk out the door now I want it back in my life 
 What what I'm gonna do cause without you 
 Baby nothing matters anymore 
 What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you 
 You 
 Not ready to let you go 
 When you was with me I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay 
 What what I'm gonna do 
 Is find my way back to you you 
 What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you 
 Damn 
 What what I'm gonna do 
 I fucked up this time 
 What what I'm gonna do cause without you 
 Baby nothing matters anymore 
 What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you you 
 Not ready to let you go 
 I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay 
 What what I'm gonna do 
 Is find my way back to you you 
 What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you
