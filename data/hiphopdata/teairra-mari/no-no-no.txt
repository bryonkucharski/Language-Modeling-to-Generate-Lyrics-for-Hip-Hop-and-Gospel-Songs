 You running out of luck, yeah ya stars are not aligned 
 And now, played the last game with you for the last time 
 Threw the cards on the table can't take another round 
 Got these chicks callin me it's about to go down 
 You messy, I can't take a man who can't get his stuff together 
 Can't get his words together (you can go into whatever) 
 Keep my name out ya mouth, yeah the door has been closed 
 Every chick had yours, baby that's a no no 
 Gotta take it babe, you've been warned, so you know ya gotta go 
 To caught up in the wrong, oh no 
 Get ya bags and run, said ya messin with the wrong one 
 Take ya back and let it go, oh hell no 
 That's a no no, no talking to me, no more causing drama (no) no loving from me any time ya wanna (that's a no), No getting with me, no more causing drama (that's a no no, no, no no, no no no) 
 Did ya didn't think I'd find out, she was chilling at the house 
 Yeah ya tried to clear it up, baby I don't give a what 
 Boy ya know ya free to go, changing what was wrong before 
 Thought it was about you, boy ya acting brand new 
 Save ya money, flowers and cards it ain't working out 
 Ain't no kisses for ya go (that's a no no) 
 You can have ya stuff back, you can have ya pictures of 
 But cha can't have my love, oh no no 
 I thought about it I don't want it, I don't need it, naw 
 The games, the problems, the drama, yeah they can have it all 
 So I don't know why y keep callin my phone, mightest well leave me alone, cause ya know I'm a say no 
 And quite frankly I'm sick and tired of your bull shh, my time is exclusive, ya lying is useless 
 A ha ha, and right now I'm on my new shh, I'm not on you shh, a no no 
 I can't take no more, no means no, I'm out the door, no~ 
 No no no no, That's a no no...
