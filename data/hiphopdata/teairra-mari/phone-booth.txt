 Damn ring, now my life ain't been through nothing but the drama 
 Just had the worst fight ever with my mama 
 She believes that you've got two or three on the come up 
 Telling me you're loving me, but you're going home to them 
 Damn I hope she's wrong cause boy I love the ground you walk on 
 She knows that your ties in the streets can be fatal 
 She's threatening to disown me if I don't let this go 
 Lord can you help me before I blow 
 I'm so afraid 
 I'm at the phone booth 
 My mom just pissed me off, I can't take no more 
 Can you come and get me from the phone booth 
 She's telling me to break up 
 Cause you ain't gonna do nothing but hurt me 
 Come get me from the phone booth 
 It's raining, I'm crying 
 Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me 
 Come get me from the phone booth 
 My mom just pissed me of, I can't take no more 
 Can you come and get me 
 Boy on phone: Baby, baby are you all right? Why you crying man? Teairra 
 If I leave where will I go 
 Will you take me in like you told me before 
 Prove that she was just being hysterical 
 Show that what she thinks ain't reality, no 
 I love her, I do 
 Same time, I love you 
 But you both are making me choose 
 See what I go through for you 
 Boy you better hope the future that you're promising me 
 Is as real as the 45 up under you seat 
 Come on 
 I'm at the phone booth 
 My mom just pissed me off, I can't take no more

 I've been through so much 
 I can't be done like that again 
 Hope you ain't been running game 'cause I'm so in need 
 All my love that's gonna give me what every girl prays for each day 
 Though I don't see your care, I hope that you're on the way
