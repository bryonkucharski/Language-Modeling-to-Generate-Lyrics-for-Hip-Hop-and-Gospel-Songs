 Damn you looking incredible these days you know 
 Are you still with ol' dude?

 But you know he can't do what I can do for you 
 I can change your life you know 
 (Teairra:) Uh huh, Oh for real?

 All y'all wankstas be talking that La 
 Think I'm gonna leave my nigga, you smoking that La 
 He may not have millions but he give me enough 
 That feel good conversation and trust 
 Any time I need him he will out, want to bust 
 Damn well will lay a nigga out for the us 
 Yeah you might be gangster 
 But gangster ain't enough 
 'Cause these dickies have his name written in the cut 
 Oh, he treats me so good 
 Oh, you wishing you could 
 Axe him, nix him, make me forget him 
 But there ain't nothing out here that's like him 
 La La me, you think you gon' La La me

 You need to quit puffing that La La (La La)

 See that's the damn problem with the male species (Uh huh) 
 Y'all think y'all can hit every ball in the league (Uh huh) 
 But you'll keep poppin' foul as you talk to me 
 Wondering why girls dating girls got you intrigued 
 But that's irrelevant when it comes to me 
 My man got it locked when it comes to heap 
 I can see that you won't ever succeed 
 At pleasing a girl 101 so class is ending

 Axe him, nix him, make me forget him 
 But there ain't nothing out here quite like him
