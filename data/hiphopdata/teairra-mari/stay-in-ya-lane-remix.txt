 (Streetz Verse:) 
 Shorty Wanna go shoppin', 
 I just copped a new coupe for her to plop in 
 Thatz how we rockin' 
 Don't slam doors mami 
 This ain't yourz mami 
 Put you on timeout like you ain't did yo chores mami 
 Hom-o-cide I kill da streets, I'm on FIRE! 
 Young boy conceal da heat, you want a RIDAH 
 Well you need to holla at me 
 You starin' don't change a thing mami, stay in ya lane, HOLLAA 
 Yes I, got a tight crew 
 So, yes I know what these jeans are doing to ya 
 Yes you, like how we move but 
 Just be careful, we don't start clowning you 
 Yes I, might give you a chance if your game is times four (four) 
 Might give you the sell if your backseat sits four (four) 
 Until I do 
 Respect my whole crew 
 And stay in your lane 
 I see you baby 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy 
 Keep getting at me 
 But stay in your lane 
 I ain't easy 
 My frame is crazy 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy 
 You want me, but be easy 
 So look upon me, just stay in ya lane 
 Yes we, came in five coups 
 So, just be easy, it's the first time I met you 
 Yes, we're particular too 
 So, watch your mouth 
 Or bottles are flying at you 
 Yes I, came to play around and shut this place down 
 As fine as I am, I can't take this route 
 If your mouth is loose 
 You're with the wrong crew 
 We're gon' handle you 
 I see you baby (Oh) 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy (Take it easy yeah) 
 Keep getting at me 
 But stay in your lane 
 I ain't easy 
 My frame is crazy (So crazy) 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy (Easy) 
 You want me, but be easy 
 So look upon me, just stay in ya lane 
 I see you baby ('cause me and my girls came to have a good time baby) 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy 
 Keep getting at me (And we don't need nobody getting out and poppin', thinking they're hot, just stop it) 
 But stay in your lane 
 I ain't easy 
 My frame is crazy (I know you like what you see, but stay in your lane please) 
 But stay in your lane 
 Take it easy 
 You want me, but be easy (And I'm not gonna tell you no more) 
 So look upon me, just stay in ya lane 
 I'm not really trying to play you 
 But certain things I can't tolerate (tolerate) 
 Like a nigga up in my face (in my face) 
 I really need my space so 
 I'll show you how you can get through 
 And most important stay in your lane 
 But you really can't play these games with me (Oh)
