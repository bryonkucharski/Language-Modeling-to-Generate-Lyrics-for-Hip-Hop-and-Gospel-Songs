(Yeah, New Shit) 
 I got plans for you and me 
 We both need to move on 
 'Cause you ain't what I need 
 It took some time for me to find out 
 I didn't sign up for misery 
 And no we can't work it out 
 Things ain't the same way that they used to be 
 'Cause you don't feel for me no more 
 I got some new clothes, new kicks 
 I got a new crib, new whip 
 All your drama, I don't miss 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 I can't believe I was with you 
 All the pain that I went through 
 I sing a new song, new hit 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 Now boy don't start blowing up my phone 
 I thought I told you to be gone (be gone) 
 Had the chance to make things right 
 But you kept doing me wrong 
 This ain't a break up to make up game 
 I'mma do you how you did me 
 'Cause this is a new day, new change, new me 
 I'm moving on to some new shit 
 I got some new clothes, new kicks (new kicks) 
 I got a new crib, new whip (new whip) 
 All your drama, I don't miss 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 I can't believe I was with you 
 All the pain that I went through (All the pain I went through) 
 I sing a new song, new hit (new hit) 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 Now that I know he ain't the one for me 
 (Now I know this, now I know this, now I know this, so tell would it) 
 Tell me would it make sense for me not to leave 
 You know I'm already going 
 I guess its time to move on 
 I got some new clothes, new kicks 
 I got a new crib, new whip 
 All your drama, I don't miss (I don't miss) 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit (Boy I'm on some new shit) 
 I can't believe I was with you 
 All the pain that I went through 
 I sing a new song, new hit 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 (I'm on some new shit) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 (I'm on some new shit) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 (I'm on some new shit) 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit 
 I'm so over you boy 
 I'm on some new shit
