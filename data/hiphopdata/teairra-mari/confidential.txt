Teairra, I want you ma, can we do this 
 Can I trust you? 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow 
 And promise to not let nobody know 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving 
 Its confidential 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow 
 And promise to not let nobody know 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving 
 Its confidential 
 If I (If I) 
 Let you get me (Let you, let you) 
 Take off my jeans (Let you, let you) 
 You're gonna be 
 The first one to score 
 And if I let go (Let go, let go) 
 Act irresponsible (Oh no, oh no) 
 After all this is over 
 Will the joke be on me 
 Though my body's saying (take me) 
 I got my mind saying (same thing) 
 Slow down, don't be fooled, by the things you say 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow (Oh) 
 And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know) 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving (It's so confidential) 
 Its confidential 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow 
 And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know, oh) 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving 
 Its confidential 
 I'm so close to giving you all of me 
 But I can't be sure that you gon' stay with me 
 I know that I said that we were meant to be 
 But I can't say this time and its right for me 
 Your swagger is right our vibe is strong 
 You're beggin' to see me with nothing on 
 So many of my girls are home alone 
 Wishing that they would have remained strong 
 Though my body's saying (take me) 
 I got my mind saying (same thing) 
 Slow down, don't be fooled, by the things you say 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow 
 And promise to not let nobody know (Promise that you won't betray me) 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving (No, it's so confidential) 
 Its confidential 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow (No) 
 And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know) 
 About nothing, if I come off of this loving (Whoa, it's so confidential) 
 Its confidential 
 I like you 
 I mean, (Nothing, loving) 
 I really like you 
 I just don't know (Nothing, loving) 
 If I'm ready 
 If I take it off 
 Would you take it slow (You feel me) 
 And promise to not let nobody know 
 About nothing, loving (You willing to wait?) 
 If I take it off would you take it slow (Huh) 
 And promise to not let nobody know 
 About nothing (nothing), if I come off of this loving 
 Its confidential
