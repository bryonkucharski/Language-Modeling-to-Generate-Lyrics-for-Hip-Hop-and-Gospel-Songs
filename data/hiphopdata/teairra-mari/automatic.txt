 I got that automatic, (automatic) 
 That ready rock, (ready rock)

 (Verse 1: Teairra Mari) 
 I got that automatic, 
 The super good, 
 I know you wish you had it, 
 That coca-ina, 
 Have you feelin' like an addict, 
 I got that lean, 
 I'll have you walkin' into traffic, 
 And you so hot, 
 You need that push, 
 And this ain't regular, 
 Baby this here is kush, 
 A sour diesel got you goin', 
 When you wake up you'll feel like an eagle in the morning 
 (Yeah-yeah) 
 I got that automatic, (automatic) 
 That ready rock, (ready rock) 
 And you can have it, (You can have it) 
 But it might get you high then a mu... 
 Might you high then a mu-fa... 
 (Repeat) 
 I got the cherry cola, 
 With extra ice, 
 I got that A-1 yola, 
 But if you want it, 
 You gon' have to get your dough up, 
 And if you ain't got money, 
 Don't even show up, 
 And I hear you braggin' on your dick, 
 But you'll be jones'in once you get a hit of this, 
 You'll be feinin' when you want me, 
 Used to be a balla now your just a fuckin' junkie 
 (Ay) 
 I got that automatic, (automatic) 
 That ready rock, (ready rock) 
 And you can have it, (You can have it) 
 But it might get you high then a mu... 
 Might you high then a mu-fa...
