Gotta be honest I've been down this road before 
 And it's a real problem 'cause I know just where it's going 
 I don't wanna do this but I don't wanna lose him no 
 Caught up in this tug of war oh (oh oh oh oh) 
 Don't know where the lines got blur (oh oh oh oh) 
 Somewhere between love and hurt 
 We're everything we should be 
 Why can't I see that he's no good for me 
 Feels like love but inside I'm torn 
 It's a struggle 'cause I can't let go 
 My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it 
 'Cause the truth has to travel too far 
 From my head to my heart 
 I never really notice everything you took from me 
 It's hard to be focus when this love is holding me 
 Tryna find a reason, I mean a really good reason why 
 I should fight to keep him in my life (oh oh oh oh) 
 Don't know where the lines got blur (oh oh oh oh) 
 Somewhere between love and hurt 
 We're everything we should be 
 Why can't I see that he's no good for me 
 Feels like love but inside I'm torn 
 It's a struggle 'cause I can't let go 
 My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it 
 'Cause the truth has to travel too far 
 From my head to my heart 
 Everybody keeps telling me what's best 
 But it just goes in one ear out the other 
 And I'm still right where I've been 
 What is this thing you've got on me 
 That makes me stay when I should leave 
 Is this how it's gonna be 
 Feels like love but inside I'm torn 
 It's a struggle 'cause I can't let go 
 My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it 
 'Cause the truth has to travel too far 
 From my head to my heart 
 (My head to my heart, my heart) 
 'Cause the truth has to travel too far to my heart
