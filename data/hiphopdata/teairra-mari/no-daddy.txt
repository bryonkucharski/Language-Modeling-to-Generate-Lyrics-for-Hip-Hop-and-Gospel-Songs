 I didn't have no daddy around when I was growing up (huh) 
 That's why I'm wild and I don't give a (huh) 
 Y'all think 'cause these jeans fit, I would give it up 
 Don't let my cute face fool ya 
 Been through so much in my life 
 Seen things in my life 
 That I never thought I'd make it through 
 Had a few close calls in my life 
 That could have ended my life 
 But I'm here looking at you 
 Never thought that I'd be here 
 I'm the type that don't give a damn about rules 
 I was forced to survive on the streets 
 Make my own way to eat 
 Gotta do what I gotta do (Best believe) 
 I know plenty of girls like me 
 That done been through hell just like me 
 Keep what your mama teach ya 
 Don't let cheat or the street defeat ya (Girlfriend) 
 And all my kickass girls like me 
 That ain't ever afraid to speak 
 Next time that they try to treat ya 
 Like you a freak just so he can look good 
 Tell them 
 No I don't strip in the club 
 Nor trick in the club 
 But I got friends that do 
 So my girls that's getting the dough 
 The best way they know 
 Don't hate girl I got you 
 Even though it ain't me (I understand) 
 That its real in these streets (I understand) 
 When it comes to that rent, that whip 
 That check, ain't nobody gonna protect your neck like you 
 I know plenty of girls like me 
 That done been through hell just like me 
 Keep what your mama teach ya 
 Don't let cheat or the street defeat ya (Girlfriend) 
 And all my kickass girls like me 
 That ain't ever afraid to speak 
 Next time that they try to treat ya 
 Like you a freak just so he can look good 
 Tell them 
 All, all my girls from a broken home 
 When you're feeling all alone 
 And you feel you can't go on (call me)
