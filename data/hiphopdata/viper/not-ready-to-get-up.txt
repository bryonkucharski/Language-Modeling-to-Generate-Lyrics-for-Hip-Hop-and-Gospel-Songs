Sunday 
 I'm never in the mood to find a place 
 Where I can get a bit of inspiration 
 It's also hard to be awake 
 I never meant to be too hard 
 But I can never be nice on sundays 
 If I can give you more and more 
 Tell me if you're here 'cause I'm not sure 
 Or leave me while I sleep 
 When you're feeling down you're feeling down 
 You turn the radio and never find your sound 
 You know I'm not ready to get up 
 Lonely 
 I'm waiting for the night to come 
 To walk away from people calling me for something 
 That I don't care anyway 
 You say that I should have more friends 
 But why 
 I live as all my days were sundays 
 If I can give you more and more 
 Tell me if you're here 'cause I'm not sure 
 Or leave me while I sleep 
 When you're feeling down you're feeling down 
 You turn the radio and never find your sound 
 You know I'm not ready to get up
