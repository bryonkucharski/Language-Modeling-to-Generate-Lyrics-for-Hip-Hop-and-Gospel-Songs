(Pit Passarell - Yves Passarell) 
 In the age of fights 
 I'm running wild 
 I saw the people screaming 
 I need the glory 
 This land is bloody 
 Just the power had given 
 The wind the sound 
 The star the sky 
 Signs of the night 
 The fire burning bright in the air 
 Signs of the night 
 The fire burning bright till the end 
 Of the world 
 The swords are burning 
 You can hear the sound 
 Many souls has risen 
 The beast is rising 
 Death is her mate 
 She got the rage of the VIPER!
