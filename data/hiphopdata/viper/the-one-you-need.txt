So many nights 
 I look inside 
 And I saw the light 
 Of your cold eyes on me 
 So I spend all day 
 I couldn't lay 
 I shouldn't stay 
 Like that so easily 
 Down on my knees 
 Like this 
 My dream is now so far away 
 I'm not livin' anymore 
 I'll be around you all the time 
 Till you realise that I'm the one you need 
 Screaming loud 
 No time to walk 
 Or voice to talk 
 I'm just through memories 
 Feeling like a slave 
 Wishing my grave 
 Such an easy way 
 To get me out of here 
 Stepping near 
 More tears 
 My dream is now so far away 
 I'm not livin' anymore 
 I'll be around you all the time 
 Till you realise that I'm the one you need
