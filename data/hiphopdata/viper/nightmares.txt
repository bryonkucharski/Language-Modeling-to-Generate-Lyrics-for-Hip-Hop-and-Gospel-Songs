My time is ending fastly 
 My pain is growing 
 You have to hear my prayers 
 Evil thoughts are coming 
 The midnight train will leave me 
 To live in shadows 
 Don't walk across my meanings 
 There's no return 
 The curse is waiting for me 
 The sky is crying 
 And while we're fighting lonely 
 Our honor dies 
 So why do we keep on fighting 
 Beside the disgrace 
 The final comes as lightning 
 We'll rest in peace 
 In front of my eyes the men shout 
 I've got no fear 
 We hear the bombs cry loud 
 Nightmare is here 
 Legions of blindmen marching 
 No fate no future 
 For fucking flag we're fighting 
 Our death is right 
 Seconds are running faster 
 They are my life 
 I'm just a slave of violence 
 Ready to die 
 My cross prove that the olders 
 Control the youngers 
 Of children they made soldiers 
 Of soldiers they made deads
