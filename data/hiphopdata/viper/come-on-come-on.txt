Feeling like a wicked mind 
 Memories of sadness are my world 
 The great moon comes every night 
 I'm tired of the stones that keep me inside 
 Come on Come on 
 An only son 
 Living in a tower all alone 
 Come on Come on 
 If I had a gun 
 I could end this dream and find a soul 
 Keep away from the wings of fear 
 Climb the walls, keep searching for the light 
 Darkness is not the only ghost 
 I don't want to keep it all inside 
 Come on Come on 
 An only son 
 Living in a tower all alone 
 Come on Come on 
 If I had a gun 
 I could end this dream and find a soul 
 What is mine? I know it's not the answer 
 But I'll take it if it's all right 
 Running feeling healing meanings 
 I'm doing it all right for the last time 
 Come on come on 
 I have a gun 
 Dressed in black I'm feeling so alone 
 Souls I've never seen before 
 Another castle then another hole 
 I can't take it anymore 
 An evil soul I've got nowhere to go
