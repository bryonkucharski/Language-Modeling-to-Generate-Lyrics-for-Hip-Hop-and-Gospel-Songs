Fate always from above 
 Never lets us know 
 The taste of the world. 
 Jake opened heart and mind 
 Is bordering the line 
 Between the races. 
 The deepest we fall is always not enough 
 Facing the world, back to the wall. 
 All right I must say no 
 But it's coming from the inside 
 All right it's stronger than I thought 
 'Cause it's coming from the inside. 
 Fate playing with our souls 
 Spreads to everyone 
 Boards of salvation. 
 Jake living black and white 
 He never wants to hide 
 What comes from his inside. 
 The deepest we fall is always not enough 
 Facing the world, back to the wall. 
 All right I must say no 
 But it's coming from the inside 
 All right it's stronger than I thought 
 'Cause it's coming from the inside. 
 I only know one color of blood. 
 The deepest we fall is always not enough 
 Facing the world, back to the wall. 
 All right I must say no 
 But it's coming from the inside 
 All right it's stronger than I thought 
 'Cause it's coming from the inside.
