Growing more despite then lies 
 Plague destroys in front of my eyes 
 Everything could be better 
 Nobody cares if it's sun or moon 
 The silence is loud 
 In motel rooms 
 Everybody around the world 
 Is getting sick 
 Makin' love Oh yeah yeah yeah 
 Dead hearts bleeding 
 So while we taste 
 The poisoned blood 
 Waiting the cure 
 Or salvation from God 
 I can't see no regret 
 Man loves woman man loves man 
 Man loves needle 
 And needle loves vein 
 Everybody around the world 
 Is getting sick 
 All you need is love 
 Is it true or is it fair 
 A manipulation 
 For a nation's warfare 
 So why don't they find the cure 
 At least we have our final bomb 
 Destroyed love 
 Put the world in a tomb 
 Everybody around the world 
 Is sick of it
