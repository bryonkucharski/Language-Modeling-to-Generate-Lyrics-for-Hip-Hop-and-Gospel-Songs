God put a heart in the body of a man 
 Beating in chaos with no defense 
 Always begging mercy from the blue sky above 
 Hiding his sins but heaven knows. 
 I'm running with my 
 Bad dreams, good scenes 
 Loneliness and sadness 
 You left too deep your mark 
 No I've got you inside my heart. 
 Dance of madness 
 Shadows running in the night 
 Dance of madness 
 You and me dancing on the fire 
 God put a heart inside of me 
 And love is a knife that makes us bleed 
 So let's bleed together at the "Suicide Bar" 
 Let's spread colors no matter how far. 
 Dance of madness 
 Shadows running in the night 
 You and me dancing on the fire 
 Running on the wire 
 So let's dance 
 Burning 
 God put a heart in the body of a man 
 Beating in chaos with no defense 
 You're the dancer of the "Suicide Bar" 
 Spreading desire no matter how far. 
 Dance of madness 
 Shadows running in the night 
 You and me dancing on the fire 
 Dancing on the wire.
