Four knights of the light 
 Riding in the air through the clouds 
 And the stars of the sky 
 Are warning the curse to the ground 
 Escaping from the evil land 
 Bringing the war and the hate 
 God will look after my soul 
 But my sword will guard my fate 
 Terror and destruction 
 Brought by the four knights of hell 
 I'm prepared to win, I'm prepared to fight 
 Four rider beasts ride the sky 
 Hell's bells chime 
 See the damned horses that ride 
 Carrying the woe of hell 
 Through the world 
 Cry and pain 
 Four rider beasts kill thousand men 
 Just one sword across the land 
 Can save us of the woe in the world 
 Reaping all the enemies 
 Four swords of hell feed the graves 
 But rulings of the world 
 Are nearing the day when we'll fade 
 We will kill all those 
 Who menace destroy our world 
 Now is our final fight 
 Ride up your eyes and raise your soul 
 Knights of destruction 
 I will take you off this land 
 Evil will not put fear in our minds 
 And all the pain will find 
 Then they fight 
 There's not any mercy in their eyes 
 The beast of disgrace and pain won the war 
 We wrote in the sand 
 That we must brought peace to our land 
 And thousand years will pass 
 Until return the life to this world
