(Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado) 
 He was born between weapons he grew 
 Day and night he learned to survive 
 The wine was food that the graced with blood 
 His bible was the law of the sword 
 But the chains were broken 
 Now the gods want his soul 
 The law of the sword will guide his hearts 
 Day after day he saw the pain 
 Harlot women and hamlets in flame 
 On their horses they had the force 
 Till de death change their routes 
 Angels of sky and demons of hell 
 Will not change the destiny of men 
 He fought with grace he die with faith 
 This was his tale god bless his name
