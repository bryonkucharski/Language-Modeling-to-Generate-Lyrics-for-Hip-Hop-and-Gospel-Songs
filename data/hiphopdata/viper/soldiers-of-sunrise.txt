(Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado - Yves Passarell - Cassio Audi) 
 Sunlight into the end and dark breed a new day 
 Now we'll prepare our lives to keep eager our faith 
 Soldiers of metal walking through the frozen souls 
 Showing the rage to set our flag into this world 
 So we fight! 
 DIE 
 Soldiers that don't fight to win 
 HATE 
 Flowing in my veins to destroy 
 TIME 
 Time to the battle begin 
 Death 
 We are it 
 Fast we ride we're Soldiers of Sunrise 
 Run and win the world 
 Strong we fight we're Soldiers of Sunrise 
 Break the chains of all the time tonight 
 Masters of reason make mistakes and you take the blame 
 The truth was made only to serve who have more age 
 But the rebellion comes today when we're united 
 To break the rules and chains that don't let us have rights 
 Now we are millions we are united by our hearts 
 Our sun will always bright when we'll be in the dark 
 We fight for metal and the sunrise is our sign 
 To start of the whole end with the force that we have found
