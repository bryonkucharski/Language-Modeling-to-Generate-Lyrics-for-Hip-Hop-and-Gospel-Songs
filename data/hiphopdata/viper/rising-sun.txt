My hands are shaking holding the gun 
 Why god sent me here to the front line 
 Politician's war I'm not a part of this 
 I bet that they won't take a bullet for me 
 All those nights I've cried in my bed 
 The fear of dying doesn't make any sense 
 The rain baptizes me in this bloody hell 
 When will they appear? I can't tell 
 Lightning, thunder and rain 
 Our lives are wasted in vain 
 Rising sun 
 It will come to enlighten me 
 The war has begun 
 Will I kill to survive in this? 
 Game of death 
 We are pieces played by someone else 
 Now my life passes before my eyes 
 In my childhood I used to play dead 
 With a wooden gun in my hand 
 Learning this horror innocently 
 Bullets, bombs and a flare 
 Soldiers shooting everywhere 
 My hands are tired of holding this gun 
 I let it fall down, hitting the ground 
 My eyes are blinded by the rising sun 
 I cry the death of all those around
