Late in the night 
 I walk alone and thousand pictures 
 Are flying in my mind 
 And all my steps 
 It's like the beating of my passion 
 Exploding in my heart 
 Always ready to run through the life 
 I never throw, never throw my time away 
 Say that it's a crime 
 Take me off the line 
 Qive me what I need 
 Another night 
 I'm ready to begin again 
 Sometimes it's faked 
 When our hearts can't find the feelings 
 We're trying to forget 
 Sometimes your fate 
 It's not the same what you believe in 
 You just can't runaway
