Have you ever said the truth 
 In all these years that I trusted in you 
 Have you ever shown your face 
 When I was tryng to get safe 
 A day before you hide your hands 
 You wanted more 
 I took your mask I took your plans 
 You got nothing left to say 
 Now you're gone and I've found my way 
 I can live without your lies 
 I'm not afraid I won't waste my time 
 All the money I've ever seen 
 Ended up being far from me 
 If you'd ever said the truth 
 In all these years I'd trust in you
