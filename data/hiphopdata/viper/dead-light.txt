Looking for a smile inside this place 
 Walking through the rooms 
 Makes the time go away 
 Every time is madness time 
 You close your door to me 
 Screaming in the night is the music here 
 I'll go on looking for the dreams 
 'Cause I never found you inside of me 
 I watch the sunrise behind your eyes 
 See the future don't pray tonight 
 Don't you ever cry please get me out of here 
 I'll never find the answer for you and me 
 I'll go looking for the screams 
 And I'll never find you inside of me 
 Running for the day, bleeding in the night 
 Nightmare fills the dreams and I'm hungry for life 
 Love is insanity, impossible to find 
 And going on means going far into the dead light 
 Waiting for a light in the sky 
 Colors and reality 
 Are black and white 
 Give me back the things I had 
 And leave me alone 
 Some day we'll meet again after my dawn 
 I met you in the dark 
 I brought you to the light 
 Now there's a dead light 
 Burning deep inside of you and me
