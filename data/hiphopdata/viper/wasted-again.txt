Ten thousand endless nights 
 I felt my fingers touch the skies 
 Last wind carried away my soul 
 I will never find myself anymore. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy dreams 
 And you know I'm keeping 'em in my memories 
 I'm at the limit that I can afford 
 Everyday I see my thoughts coming from my skin. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 Lead the way 'cause I don't know. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy words 
 I'm writing everything In my life's book 
 Snow wings take me out of here 
 Mow I'm hiding in a place where I see no fear. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 But believe I need it so. 
 Many times I've spent my life 
 And all I've learned was wrong 
 And many times I've trusted in you 
 I wish I'd never ever told you all the truth. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy eyes 
 Have been watching me always and I can't disguise 
 And ail those years I'm still waiting for 
 Anyone to blind my heart and open my door. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 You showed the way but I can't go.
