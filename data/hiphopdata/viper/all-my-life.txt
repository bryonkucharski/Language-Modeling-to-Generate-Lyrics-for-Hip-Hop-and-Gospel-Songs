All my life 
 I watch the stars falling 
 Like tears in the dark blue sky 
 The universe is crying for our faults 
 Crimes of hate and misunderstanding 
 Between races and between faiths 
 Forgetting that we're part of the same dust 
 But there's so much more 
 In this whole wide world 
 That is beautiful 
 Like when a child is born 
 And when a flower grows 
 Or when we find true love 
 Inspiring us to carry on 
 All my life 
 From time to time the world gets closer 
 When it seems all hopes are over 
 For mankind to live in peace 
 For those who trust there's something above 
 That cares for all of us 
 One god, one love, one soul 
 All my life 
 Forgetting that we're part of the same dust 
 But there's so much more 
 In this whole wide world 
 That is beautiful 
 Like when a child is born 
 And when a flower grows 
 Or when we find true love 
 Inspiring us to carry on 
 Giving me hope to carry on 
 All my life
