Breaking rocks in the hot sun 
 I fought the law and law won 
 I needed money 'cause I had none 
 I fought the law and law won 
 I left my girl and it feels so sad 
 I guess my race is run 
 She was the sweetest little woman 
 That I ever had 
 I fought the law and law won 
 Robbing people with a six gun 
 I fought the law and law won 
 I lost my girl and all of her fun 
 I fought the law and law won
