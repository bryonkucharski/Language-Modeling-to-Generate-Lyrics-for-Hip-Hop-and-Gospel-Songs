Let me show you all the lights 
 Through my eyes 
 Paint your soul in black and white 
 To disguise 
 Keep searching for mercy 
 Keep praying and hoping 
 I'm alone 
 In the back of your mind 
 It's a real real real world alive 
 You just told me 
 We're close to the end 
 In a real real world so I go 
 Straight ahead 
 Learn the things you wanted to 
 Out of school 
 Live your life in search of truth 
 Not in books 
 The existence where I drown 
 Is deeper than I thought 
 Is longer than I planned 
 And stronger than I am 
 Everlasting state of mind 
 Are you blind 
 Go find what all of us try 
 Right now
