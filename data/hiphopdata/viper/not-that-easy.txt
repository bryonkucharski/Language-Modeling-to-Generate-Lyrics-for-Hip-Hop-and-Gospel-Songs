It wasn't a waste of time 
 I was learning on my own 
 When reality met passion 
 Craziness and destiny 
 Love is all I seek 
 To drive me through this life 
 Waiting for greetings from above 
 Make this world my home 
 A womb with hopes and affection 
 How I wanted to believe 
 Love is all I need 
 To bring peace to my heart 
 Everybody knows it's not that easy 
 And everybody loves you 
 But you're just a dreamer 
 I wasn't a waste of time 
 I was learning from your love 
 If reality meant sadness 
 If this is my destiny 
 Love is all I need 
 To drive me through this life 
 Waiting for greetings from above 
 'Cause this world is not my home 
 To taste some love and affection 
 God I wanted to believe 
 That my heart-shaped seeds 
 Would grow and reach the skies 
 Everybody knows it's not that easy 
 And everybody loves you 
 But you're just a dreamer
