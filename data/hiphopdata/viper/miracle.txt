I am feeling closed inside my world and now 
 I am trapped in my own dream so lonely 
 I try to run away from these sad memories 
 But my mind cannot escape from drowning 
 Turn around 
 I wake to win but not today 
 I think it is not working for me now 
 I feel inside 
 But I'm still not free 
 Where's the miracle 
 I've seen in my dream? 
 Dark is my heart 
 My soul can't be free 
 I need some kind of miracle to save me 
 I can dream there is a hope but where is it? 
 And reality is not so close to me 
 Draw me paintings of my memories 
 Put some colors in my life to live on 
 Turn around 
 I wake up to win but not today 
 I think it is not working for me now
