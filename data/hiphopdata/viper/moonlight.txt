Lifestorm broke my anchors 
 Like a wreck I've been 
 Sea and sky were just one darkness 
 Such a brilliant radiance you came 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Just by the light 
 From your eyes 
 And I need you to be 
 Like the heaven I seek 
 But clouds showed me 
 And I saw 
 You were just the moonlight 
 And the moon belongs 
 To no one, no one...
