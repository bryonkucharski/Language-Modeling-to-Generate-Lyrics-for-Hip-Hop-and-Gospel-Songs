Buddy you're a boy make a big noise 
 Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day 
 You got mud on your face 
 You big disgrace

 You got blood on your face

 Wavin your banner all over the place

 Pleadin with your eyes gonna make

 You got mud on your face 
 You big disgrace 
 Somebody gonna put you back in your place
