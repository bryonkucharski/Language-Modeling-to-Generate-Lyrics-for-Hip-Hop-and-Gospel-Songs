Something about my perception 
 Tries to freak me out all the time 
 I do things with no intention 
 I know that this is no crime 
 Everyone thinks I am insane 
 I live in a world far away 
 My thoughts and my feelings can make me 
 Observe the drops of the rain 
 Like crystal tears from heaven 
 The cry of a god with no prayers 
 The roar of the beast can tell them 
 Why fire is burning the hater 
 All this misunderstanding 
 Follows me time after time 
 Trapped in my own memories 
 I carry this weight with my life 
 Nothing can make me come back from the start 
 I'll tell you not to even try 
 I'm not a sick man, you're just wasting time 
 These are the words that describe me 
 Just a dreamer, running through fields in the rain 
 I am living life as if there's no tomorrow 
 A dreamer, tell me you can understand 
 My heart is filled with ideals, not with hollow
