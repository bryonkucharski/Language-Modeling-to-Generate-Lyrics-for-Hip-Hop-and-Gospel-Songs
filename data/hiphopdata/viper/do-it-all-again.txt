I'm not the hours that I've lived 
 I'm the love and pain deceived 
 I'm the moments that define them all 
 I decide who it should be 
 From beginning to end 
 I love life to heal my heart and soul 
 And do it all again 
 Real life breaks all my dreams 
 Nightmares wash away my sins 
 Can't you see, I'm not the one to blame 
 Just my heart knows when it ends 
 Sorry not to tell you friend 
 Now is the time to rule the world 
 And do it all again 
 A little bit of a little sin 
 Wasted time will kiss my lips 
 I'll do it all again 
 A little weak, a little freak 
 I'll cross the world to kiss your lips 
 I'll do it all again
