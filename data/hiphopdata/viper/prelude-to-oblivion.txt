Cruel reality 
 Wears away our will to live 
 All the world will look at me 
 And hold its breath to hear my speech 
 So when I leave this world unfair 
 They will cry for me and understand 
 I just can't find my way 
 Or meaning to my life 
 World will remember 
 Not at all 
 And take my example 
 Not at all 
 Am I wrong? 
 Yes! Because the world won't take example 
 From somebody who won't fight 
 For better days and hide away 
 Not facing problems in their life 
 To be alive is the best way 
 That we must show mankind 
 We want a better world for all 
 I ask all the world 
 To follow the song
