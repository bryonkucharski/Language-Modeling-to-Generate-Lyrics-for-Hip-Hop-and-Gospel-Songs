How many miracles have you seen 
 You've committed a thousand sins 
 Do you know the name of god 
 He is a messiah at your back door 
 Last night I asked my soul 
 Who I am and where I'm from 
 The answers were as loud 
 As a machine gun blow 
 I feel no harm today 
 Through the windows of my face 
 Stand up tall 
 Shout out loud 
 Feel strong 
 A face in the crowd 
 There's a place I wanna go 
 But it's far from where I am 
 All the lies that I've been told 
 Build the bridges to this land 
 I control a million men 
 With the power of my hands 
 But a sound you'll never hear 
 Is the voice of my command
