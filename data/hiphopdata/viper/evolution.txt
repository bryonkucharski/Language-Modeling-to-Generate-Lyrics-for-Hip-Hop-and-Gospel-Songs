The big desert is far from here 
 Scarlet clouds in the atmosphere 
 Built by hands of a million men 
 Darkest silence of a dead land. 
 Every night I say a pray 
 Asking god to see you again 
 I will bring you back home 
 Dead or alive, I don't know. 
 A million dollars cross the sky 
 Invisible plane a brand new kind 
 A million people cross the sands 
 Following the hunger guide. 
 I hear the siren in sector one 
 A new rebellion get your guns 
 Hold your breath if they are close 
 They take hostages to get drugs 
 Miles I'm walking seeing the hand of men 
 Destroying the land. 
 Is the future on my side? 
 Evolution 
 Self destruction 
 Space battles in the fifth war 
 Science fiction is for real 
 Happiness we never feel it 
 We only see it on the movie's screen. 
 Human being have a killer instinct 
 Though we came from the same womb 
 How can men celebrate 
 Everytime we drop a bomb? 
 Evolution 
 Self destruction 
 Disease and fear 
 I walk every night to see the end 
 To see the end by our side. 
 Very soon we'll be trapped in our own trap 
 Our private hell. 
 When there's nothing left to destroy 
 Will we destroy ourselves? 
 Yes! 
 Miles I'm marching seeing the hand of men 
 Destroying the land 
 Evolution 
 Self destruction 
 Evolution 
 No solution 
 Disease and fear 
 I walk every night to see the end 
 Come see the end 
 By my side.
