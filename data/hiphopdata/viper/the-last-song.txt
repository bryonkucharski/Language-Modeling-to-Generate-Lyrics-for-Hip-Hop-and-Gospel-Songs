Under the dark I'm growing 
 Cut by the light that goes to nowhere 
 I don't want salvation 
 I feed my vice with simple isolation and 
 Observation 
 Nameless faces from unknown races 
 Cross my back 
 Just waiting for death 
 To get some respect 
 Life is free to love and die 
 Tonight we breed tonight we cry 
 Tonight 
 Second street with 64th 
 Somebody watches somebody 
 Lying on the floor 
 As lonely as I want to be 
 I follow the trace of blood 
 Left on the streets 
 The vision of somebody dying 
 Fills the night 
 What you're calling death 
 I just call it life 
 So get away it's not your life 
 And run away somewhere so far 
 Take the chance that you have now 
 To get away
