I'll give the keys but you know 
 You'll have to close the door 
 Sometimes I take a chance 
 But I don't know what I'm looking for 
 Every time you say goodbye 
 But you're always back again in my life 
 I'm still looking for the good times 
 But I left them all behind 
 To live this life it's so hard 
 Better days are coming and I need some more 
 I need some action and I can feel 
 Feel the dream and the dream's so real 
 Another way and another time 
 I can feel I'm gonna cross the line 
 Face to face, close to me 
 You can feel, feel I'm gonna cross the line
