Take the stairs to the second floor 
 Look the name, it's on the door 
 Pull the gun in the right time 
 Just one shot took his life. 
 Hate is spreading very fast 
 Check the list and see who's next. 
 Where do you go? 
 Running 
 What do you feel? 
 Lonely 
 What do you know? 
 Nothing 
 About me. 
 Everybody, everybody 
 Everybody gets me wrong 
 No one, no one, no one 
 And nobody understands me 
 Be prepared for my attack 
 'Cause I'm the rebel maniac. 
 Every night is day for me 
 Energy and insanity 
 If it's right or if it's wrong 
 Don't ask me I don't know 
 Strange ideals fill my head 
 I walk hand in hand with death. 
 Where do you go? 
 Running 
 What do you feel? 
 Lonely 
 What do you know? 
 Nothing 
 About me. 
 Everybody, everybody 
 Everybody gets me wrong 
 No one, no one, no one 
 And nobody understands me 
 Be prepared for my attack 
 'Cause I'm the rebel maniac.
