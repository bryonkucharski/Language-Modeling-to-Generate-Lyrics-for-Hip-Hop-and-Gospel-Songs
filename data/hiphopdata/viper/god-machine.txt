I don't see a single thing 
 I don't feel a single thing 
 I don't see you 
 I don't need a single thing 
 I don't read a single thing 
 But I can save you 
 Tell me what you're here for 
 I stay with you 24 
 Hours in a day 
 Seven days a week or more 
 I don't care what you believe 
 If God machine can make me rich 
 U$ 200 000 is money enough 
 To build a church 
 But I don't care for profit 
 If I am closer to god 
 All this faith will make you blind 
 If you walk outta line 
 Switch off the machine 
 Live yourself to pray and lie 
 I don't care what you believe 
 If God machine can make me rich
