Fate is a fake shall we doubt 
 A fever flows and seems it's all around 
 Desolation it sows our roads 
 My seeds of power in fields away from home. 
 I've been blinded 
 By all the mist that we shared. 
 Lean back your regret 
 Before the differences of my heart 
 Now is still the time 
 Before you throw away 
 The shelter you should be instead. 
 Ride the words to get your fame 
 You hide with shields, the lead outside is rain 
 Mighty fear down and out 
 Seeds, the call of truth is all around. 
 Lean back your regret 
 Before the differences of my heart 
 We remain apart 
 Because you've blown away 
 The shelter you should be instead. 
 Fate is a fake shall we doubt 
 A fever flows and seems it's all around 
 Desolation it sows our roads 
 My seeds of power in fields away from you.
