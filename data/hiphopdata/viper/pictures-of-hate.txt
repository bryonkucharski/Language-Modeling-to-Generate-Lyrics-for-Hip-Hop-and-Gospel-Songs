Cynical describes me 
 But yesterday was intensity 
 Who's to blame, it is a shame? 
 Sad alone tale of a common man. 
 I say to you I've tried, I've got no alibi 
 Many times I looked up to the sky 
 And saw your face, I wonder why. 
 Once again I'm flying high 
 In the thoughts of my tomorrows 
 From my past no regrets 
 Only memories of sorrow, lies. 
 Innocence nobody sees 
 All the intentions underneath 
 Childhood dreams are nightmares to scenes 
 Now I know what liebe means. 
 Everyone I met before in this game are only pawns 
 I find myself in shadows 
 Searching for the distant echoes. 
 Pictures taken from nowhere 
 Seasons taken from me 
 Faces coming and going 
 So life love death and dreams 
 Become my pictures of hate. 
 Memory is beyond your personality 
 Everybody thinks 
 Everybody sees 
 Boundaries of a hopeless mind 
 Drawing frontiers just before my eyes.
