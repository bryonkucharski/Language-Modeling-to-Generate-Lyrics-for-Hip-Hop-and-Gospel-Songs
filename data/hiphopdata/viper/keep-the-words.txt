Excuse me my heart is cold 
 Excuse me I have to go 
 All these people all around 
 Asking what will happen now 
 A lot of things went through my head 
 Ow could I have been so sad 
 And how these feelings are around 
 Can go away she said: 
 "I traveled the world trying to get high 
 But now is time to say goodbye 
 So excuse me but I have to go 
 Keep the words I said so far" 
 I never was afraid 
 'Cause a dream to hold 
 You hands someday 
 And say "let's do it again" 
 Oh this day will come 
 But one feeling I can't refrain 
 If at least I could just pretend 
 That one more night 
 You're not away 
 I traveled the world trying to get high 
 But now is time to say goodbye 
 So excuse me but I have to go 
 Keep the words I said so far
