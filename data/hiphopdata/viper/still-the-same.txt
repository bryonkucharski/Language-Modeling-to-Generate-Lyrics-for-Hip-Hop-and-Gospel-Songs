See the fools as they run away 
 Crawling the stars again 
 Blinding season seems OK 
 To leave is just another game. 
 Reasons to live my time 
 Reasons to live 
 I feel like having to hold inside 
 All the questions from before. 
 Keep on knowing 
 In distant skies 
 We hide the meaning of our voiceless cries. 
 So many answers 
 Who's to blame 
 'Cause my existence is still the same. 
 That's right! 
 All the walls are falling 
 Looking from my room 
 Everywhere seems nowhere 
 Unless I see you soon. 
 I'm the nearest trophy 
 Of our consequence 
 Even moments in my mind 
 Are no evidence. 
 But I still live, I still live. 
 See the dreams as they drown away 
 In oceans of today 
 Lightning season seems OK 
 If all the rest remains.
