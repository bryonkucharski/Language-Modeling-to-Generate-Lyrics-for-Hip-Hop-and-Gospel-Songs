Walking through the silent town 
 Footsteps are the only sound 
 You see darkness in the light 
 You call violence what we call fight. 
 In the streets nowhere to run 
 Our minds are free our work is done. 
 Who's my silent enemy 
 Where's the silent enemy 
 Who cares or understands 
 Who's my silent enemy 
 Where's the silent enemy 
 We believe, it's all right. 
 Army of a single man 
 Bringing justice to the land 
 History is in their eyes 
 Dollar writers tell no lies. 
 Underneath our hearts and souls 
 We free our minds the mirror shows. 
 Silent enemy 
 Under a nation's flag 
 Future will absolve you 
 From the laws of men.
