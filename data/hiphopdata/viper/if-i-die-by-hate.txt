Try to make yourself natural 
 I want to see you crawling now 
 Down on your knees I'll crucify you 
 Nail your hands into a brand new cross 
 I'm the pain that you always love 
 I'm the hurt when you wanted more 
 If I die by hate 
 Who will forgive me 
 If I die by hate 
 Will you forgive me 
 Bury me burn me alive 
 Enslave my brain 
 Blind my eyes it's alright 
 If you want to see me dying 
 If you want to see me begging 
 You will wait for a thousand years 
 I will fade when you disappear 
 Build a life so I tear it down 
 Brick by brick in your own hometown 
 Fear and hate walking side by side 
 I'm the dark of your endless night
