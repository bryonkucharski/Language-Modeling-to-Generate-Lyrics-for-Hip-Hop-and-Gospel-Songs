Four billion faces 
 Are searching for their dreams 
 Fighting for a better way 
 Despite how hard it seems 
 Oh! Do you remember 
 Those words from long ago 
 That inspired us to progress 
 To make our future grow 
 Life goes on 
 It's brutal lessons 
 We must accept 
 Even through the tears 
 Maybe someday 
 A hopeful light 
 Will lead all the people 
 To live better lives 
 It will be 
 Like childhood dreams 
 Like cries in the silence 
 But I'll have at least a chance 
 Street filled with tears 
 Are the picture of my life 
 I've got someone to forget 
 Somethings that I can't hide 
 The rain is so cold 
 It cuts me like the past 
 And the scar deep inside of me 
 How long will they last? 
 Life goes on 
 It's brutal lessons 
 We must accept 
 Even through the tears 
 Maybe someday 
 A hopeful light 
 Will lead all the people 
 To live better lives 
 It will be 
 Like childhood dreams 
 Like cries in the silence 
 But I'll have at least a chance
