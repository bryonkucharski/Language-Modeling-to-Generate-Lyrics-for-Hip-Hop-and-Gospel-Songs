I listen almost everyday 
 To the same lies hitting my face 
 That will be better in the end 
 But I don't really give a damn 
 I trust a lot in who I am 
 That's the only way 
 Blast! 
 I know I know you're waiting 
 But I'm not gonna be waiting 
 Waiting for the time 
 That you blast me 
 It took some time to realize 
 If you don't kill sometimes you die 
 I use the weapons that I have 
 So if you wanna fuck 'em all 
 You gotta make 'em beg and crawl 
 That's my way 
 Blast! 
 I know I know you're waiting 
 But I'm not gonna be waiting 
 Waiting for the time 
 That you blast me
