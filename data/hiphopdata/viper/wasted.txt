Ten thousand endless nights 
 I felt my fingers touch the skies 
 Last wind carried away my soul 
 I will never find myself anymore. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy dreams 
 And you know, I'm keeping'em in my memories 
 I'm at the limit that I can afford 
 Every day I see my thoughts coming from my skin. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 Lead the way 'cause I don't know. 
 Many times getting high 
 I've spent a lifetime being wasted 
 Sad eyes dry tongue 
 I've been there million times, wasted. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy words 
 I'm writing everything in my life's book 
 Snow wings take me out of here 
 Now I'm hiding in a place where I see no fear. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 But believe I need it so. 
 Ten plus ten thousand crazy eyes 
 Have been watching me always and I can't disguise 
 And all those years I'm still waiting for 
 Anyone to blind my heart and open my door. 
 For you I'm leaving all my hope 
 You showed the way but I can't go. 
 Many time getting high 
 I've spent a lifetime being wasted 
 Sad eyes dry tongue 
 I've been there million times, wasted.
