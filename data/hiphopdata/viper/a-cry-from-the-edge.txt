Six AM and I'm still awake 
 Living thoughts and words of yesterday 
 But I'm too tired to think what is right 
 And I'm alone, I can't decide on my own 
 Take me beyond the lies 
 All the time you can stay by my side 
 And if you show me 
 A little and everyday 
 Then you'll know that I can find my way 
 All you hear now 
 Is a cry from the edge 
 Hey my friends! You've got to bring me back 
 We all begun and now you hide the fact 
 Illusions fly for those that understand 
 Memories that keep me tied to my past 
 Take me beyond the lies 
 All the time you can stay by my side 
 And if you show me 
 A little and everyday 
 Then you'll know that I can find my way 
 All you hear now 
 Is a cry from the edge 
 Painful mystery to be alive 
 Scary visions of my future life 
 Time for change give me a better way 
 Free me from the shadows over my eyes 
 Take me beyond the lies 
 All the time you can stay by my side 
 And if you show me 
 A little and everyday 
 Then you'll know that I can find my way 
 All you hear now 
 Is a cry from the edge
