Filling my head in any bar 
 With some good friends 
 No worries so far 
 It's incredible like some good news 
 It can't be real 
 A wish that came true 
 Somebody told me you're dead 
 So what's the cause 
 An overdose of cocaine and hax 
 Get happy underground jerk! 
 Now we'll celebrate and have some fun 
 Sometimes life is cruel 
 But what is done is done 
 The lamentation that now I have 
 I had no luck 
 I would like to be there 
 Rage has no limits 
 But I don't care 
 Love, I'm so happy 
 Now that you're dead
