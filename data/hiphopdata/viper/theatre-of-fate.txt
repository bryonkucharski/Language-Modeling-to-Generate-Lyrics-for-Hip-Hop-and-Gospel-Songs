The crowd came to silence 
 The spotlights are shining 
 A tale has to be told 
 In any age 
 All the world is a stage 
 A play will now begin 
 There once was a child 
 With a dream in his mind 
 And a thousand things to learn 
 But with each passing day 
 His childhood slips away 
 How soon the first act ends 
 All the dreams that we have 
 Are lost along the way 
 Victims of real life 
 Now the child is a boy 
 And new dreams have evolved 
 He strives to make them real 
 Not the fear in his heart 
 Nor a past full of pain 
 Will take away his hope 
 But how cruel life is 
 And although he resists 
 New problems will appear 
 So he'll lose one more chance 
 Time destroys all his plans 
 The second act is done 
 All the dreams that we have 
 Are lost along the way 
 Victims of real life 
 We are looking for the meaning of our lives 
 But our faults remain the same 
 And the truth will be distant from our hearts 
 Where our dreams will never end 
 But our fate is in command 
 Now the boy is a man 
 Though his visions remain 
 He knows they have no chance 
 A heart full of hate 
 All his hope driven away 
 Life's worn down his defence 
 How many lives 
 In the world born and die 
 In disillusionment 
 Not allowed to have dreams 
 And one day make'em real 
 This tale will never end 
 All the dreams that we have 
 Are lost along the way 
 Victims of real life 
 We are looking for the meaning of our lives 
 But our faults remain the same 
 And the truth will be distant from our hearts 
 Where our dreams will never... 
 We are looking for the meaning of our lives 
 But our faults remain the same 
 And the truth will be distant from our hearts 
 Where our dreams will never end 
 But our fate is in command 
 But our fate is in command 
 But our fate is in command
