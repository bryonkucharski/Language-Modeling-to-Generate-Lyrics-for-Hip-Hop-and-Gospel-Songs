(Pit Passarell) 
 The blades bright in the night 
 Brighting at the moonlight 
 The cold wind freeze my veins 
 And snow blinds my eyes 
 Under the sacred oath 
 Evil force will rise 
 They gave me wings of steel 
 And power to fly 
 And the last death angel warned 
 Flying under the sun you'll break the oath 
 Out of the moonlight and the night 
 Angels of evil will take my life and steal my soul 
 Wings of the evil will take me through the sky 
 I need the evil force to stay on high 
 Flying across the stars riding in the air 
 No mercy to kill the men no fear of the death 
 Staining the clouds of blood 
 Spread the ashes of riot 
 Reaping who fight to live 
 Messengers of hate 
 The night into the end 
 Clouds don't show the day 
 While comes the sunrise ray 
 The death laughs by my side 
 Now the dream forever ended 
 Wings of death fall to the earth 
 Force of light have broken the oath 
 Masters of evil now you have my soul
