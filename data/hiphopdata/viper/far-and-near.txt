Hey you! You know who I am 
 It doesn't matter 'cause I don't care 
 I crossed the line I'm not a slave 
 I have the world to find my way 
 So I'm running I keep running 
 I'll go running I'm always running 
 Save a prayer but not for me 
 Life is wrong as you can see 
 Nobody knows about my plans 
 I said goodbye to all my friends 
 So I'm running ain't got money 
 Always running 
 Far and near 
 Twisted souls around the night 
 Concrete deserts million lights 
 I look for your changed face 
 To follow your extinguished trace 
 Ask yourself try to get something new 
 Ask yourself try to get something real 
 So I'm running ain't got money 
 I'm always running 
 Far and near
