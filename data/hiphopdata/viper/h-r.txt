(Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado) 
 The steel is in my veins 
 Fire is burning my head 
 Where H.R. is played 
 Oh, believe I'll be there 
 My heart burns in flame 
 When the sound becomes hard 
 My desire is just the same 
 When I'm playing my guitar, yeah! 
 People come on hear the sound 
 That united we make in underground 
 People come on hear the sound 
 That united we make in underground 
 Working hard on stage 
 Play till death is our vow 
 We'll never lose the faith 
 While we play for the crowd 
 They try to close the places 
 Where we reign with our sound 
 But we'll never let them win! 
 We'll be forever playing loud! 
 People come on hear the sound 
 That united we make in underground 
 People come on hear the sound 
 That united we make in underground 
 People come on hear the sound 
 That united we make in underground
