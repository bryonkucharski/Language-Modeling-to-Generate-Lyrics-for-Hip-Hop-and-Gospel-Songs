I watch the curtains fall 
 I take my one last breath 
 But when I look around, 
 I can't see you there 
 And then I realize 
 You're distant and far from me 
 Close my eyes and 
 All I can see is your face 
 I'm back in the hotel 
 I wish that I could stay 
 Gotta pack my bags fast 
 And get on the plane 
 Our time is passing by 
 We're throwing it away 
 I'll travel all the world 
 Just to have your embrace 
 Laughter helps me to deal with the pain 
 Will I see you again? 
 All of this turns my head into a maze 
 I'm lost and lonely 
 Miles away 
 I know we're distant 
 Miles away 
 You're not that far from me 
 That only makes me see 
 How we're meant to be till the end
