Let's see the face of the 90's 
 Masking with drugs healthy minds 
 Science has the answer to your body 
 We see no end to this story. 
 Rain is pouring on me 
 But it ain't washing down 
 The poison from my soul. 
 Future means your consolation 
 But no cure for life's devastation 
 Now there's a cancer in the air 
 Just words will not seed the land. 
 Rain is pouring again 
 But it ain't washing down the poison 
 Purify me. 
 Free my acid heart 
 Last cry deep inside 
 No one is here to save us now 
 Life is far away 
 And no blood is safe 
 No one can save us now. 
 Living and dying 
 Selling and buying 
 Pass on your worries to the next. 
 Disease from chemical reaction 
 Ripping the skin of a nation 
 Altering the natural composition 
 Good fuel for the last ignition. 
 Rain is pouring on me 
 But it ain't washing down the poison 
 Crucify me.
