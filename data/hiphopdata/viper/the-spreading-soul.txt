We are safe in this old storm 
 Close to the land but you know 
 Nothing is so calm to everyone. 
 I look at myself for something new 
 Tell me a little tale about you 
 Life is just a rhyme of hopes and crimes. 
 Better years are coming. 
 Not in my hand just in my heart 
 Lay the will I have inside 
 For all I want, what I feel 
 Sister moon Brother sun 
 Yesterday I was alone 
 All I want, what I feel 
 Is to be free 
 Warmed by the sun when it shines 
 Floating in the air in a red sky 
 I can realize life is moving on. 
 I took from my blood all my hate 
 Guided by the light of fate 
 Wind blew out my soul to everyone. 
 Better days are coming. 
 I'm afraid that when you go 
 The old storm'll turn around my boat 
 I don't know how to be free. 
 If a shadow in my life 
 Take me out from my red sky 
 I don't know how to be free.
