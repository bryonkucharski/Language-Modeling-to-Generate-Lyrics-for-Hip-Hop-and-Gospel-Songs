The night is getting closer 
 The air is getting colder 
 That's my excuse to hold you Violet 
 You laughed at something I said 
 And that gave me the courage 
 To whisper in your ear I love you 
 Violet 
 Fate sometimes escapes out of our hands 
 And how does it end? 
 We'll never know until we're there 
 Through happiness and sadness 
 Through sanity and madness 
 We're meant to stay together Violet 
 The lust we used to have 
 Someday just disappeared 
 And now I have to beg for a kiss 
 Violet 
 Love sometimes is not in our hands 
 Please, understand, please, understand 
 The first place that we've shared 
 Our universe so far 
 By love creating planets 
 By kissing brand new stars 
 Excuse me for all my mistakes 
 Excuse me for all my faults 
 I wish you all the best my love
