Kandi girl (kandi girl) 
 You are my world (you are my world) 
 You look so sweet 
 You're a special treat 
 Kan-di girl 
 You are my world (my world) 
 You look so sweet 
 You're a special treat 
 (Lil' briana) 
 Wow ta dow watch out now 
 It's lil' briana no I'm not bow wow 
 I'm that candy girl that lil' miami girl 
 Sweet like cinnamon with the candy swirl 
 I'm like sugar and spice 
 My flow so nice 
 Colorful ice like rainbow bright 
 I'm that candy girl sweet like a life savor 
 Got more flavors than a pack of now or laters 
 Ten years old the baby diva 
 The kids at school call me baby trina 
 When I step on this track it make your fingers snap 
 And do the peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat 
 (Trina) 
 I taste like candy a candy treat 
 So sweet from my head down to my feet 
 This song's dedicated to my candy girls 
 The life of luxury the candy world 
 With candy benz's marble floors 
 Cartier kisses and cash galore 
 With candy toys candy yacht's 
 Candy verses and candy four dots 
 No it don't stop and we on the rise 
 To slip and slide and diva enterprise 
 We drop candy hits that's how we bring it 
 I'm a candy girl come on stef sing it 
 (Lil' briana) 
 I'm a candy girl and my flow too hot 
 Sweet like lollipops and gumdrops 
 Gummy bears skittles and kit kats 
 I'm a young girl running this game you with that? 
 I got more flavors than starburst 
 I keep my penny candy in my prada purse 
 If I act too sassy pardon me y'all 
 I be playing with barbie dolls in my carnegie hall 
 I'm a good good girl a candy girl 
 The baby diva with the baby doll pearls 
 If you ain't come to party we ain't having that 
 So do the donkey kong and the cabbage patch
