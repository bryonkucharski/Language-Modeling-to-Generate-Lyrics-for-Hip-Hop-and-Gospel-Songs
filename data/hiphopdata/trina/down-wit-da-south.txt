Form the south to the bottom

 And if you never been down south before 
 We bout to show why'all how we ridin' (get up, get up) 
 So where ever you from (yeah) 
 (Let's lets go) 
 Be like down south show a lil change 
 For the gurls in the club that be shakin that thang 
 And the got the young playas comin' up want to run things 
 Why'all see them gurls when they in them g-strangs 
 Now everybody want to be down wit da south 
 (Now everybody want to be down wit da south) 
 Now everybody tryin' to get down wit da south

 All the thugs they be playin' in the club 
 (Ooh) 
 Yo I'm from the state where the sun shine 
 Where the women are pretty and they so fine 
 Where the dudes are rude but they so cool 
 Listen, good weather is better for a good fella 
 And every ride will probably be on twenty's or twenty four's on T-0's 
 And you know like I know, we gon' represent it everywhere we go 
 And every time we drop hits 
 For hittin' everything we spit it gots to be the shit 
 So gimme a fresh white tee 
 A pair of Priest jeans and some j's why'all never seen 
 Man I can't help but win 
 On heavy rotation 
 On all of your stations 
 Down south takin' over all of the charts 
 We jus got started and will not stop 
 You ain't never seen a big ol' ass like this 
 And you ain't never gon' run across a badder bitch 
 I'm Ms Trina, Miami's finest 
 And you can ask your man who has the flyest 
 Playas who millionaires try to buy this 
 And I ain't got shit to hide 
 I like to squat and ride 
 Go front and back, side to side 
 Bend me over show me what you holdin' 
 And oh shit, now give it to me, gimme that big ol' dick 
 First suck me up, and then buck me up 
 Go deeper, deeper, beat me, beat me, 
 Lets make a sequel for the naked people 
 Your whole click against my click 
 Now shake that ass, shake that ass 
 Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad 
 Kaine 
 Here we come to fuck the whole floor 
 Ying yang twins kickin' in your door 
 Scat like a rat when a cat comin' out the house 
 Dir-ty south 
 D-Roc 
 My bad we done did it again 
 Trick daddy and the Ying Yang twins 
 If you don't know, let me fill you in 
 I hope you know we in it to win 
 You didn't know we the super friends 
 We done did another song again 
 So I just know its on again 
 We fonna put a joint to win 
 Why'all gonna get rolled over 
 Like a bulldozer 
 I hope you know the game over

 In 10 years Ima be doin' the same damn thang
