Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 
 Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit [x3] 
 Hes a best hes a dog 
 Hes a to the left problem 
 Tryna thel them lies 
 Hopin that I won't solve em 
 I call him 
 Voicemail pickin' straight up 
 Should I gps him 
 Damn right staight up 
 My mind keep tellin' me 
 I'm bout to earn a felony 
 You'll never get the best of me 
 Rushin fast tryna see 
 Why the maybachs top is somewhere where you'll never be 
 3 o clock in the mornin 
 You should be next to me 
 I hope it ain't kimberly 
 It better not be tiffany 
 It's prolly that ebony 
 How this dude be tryin' me 
 Juss wined and dined everything is fine 
 It don't work like that I put in too much time 
 Damn I'm in shock can't believe what I see 
 He ain't with that one chick 
 He in the back with all three 
 Low down dirty ass cheatin' lame n**** 
 Don't make me put this finger on this trigga! 
 Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 
 Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit [x8] 
 Naw I ain't shoot him 
 'Cause he ain't worth that 
 The purse he bought yesterday 
 I took that shit back 
 I got them 12 stacks 
 I bleached all his clothes 
 So he knows what's gonna happen when he mess with other hoes 
 I burned all his shoes 
 I swiped all his cards 
 Ordered gucci off the internet and sold it in the yard 
 Sucker went dead broke in just three hours 
 After the transaction in your house [? ] towers 
 I called his momma up she said she feel my pain 
 She told me if she was me she would of did the same thing 
 Yeah I kept the ring juss switched the finger 
 To the middle one 'cause it's f u n**** 
 Was a diamond in the ruff 
 I ain't never played tuff 
 Till lyou got outta line doin' all that dumb stuff 
 This n**** had it good I could sworn dis was it 
 Come to find out that n**** wasn't shit 
 Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 
 Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit [x8] 
 Ladies if ya know a n**** cheatin' and he late night creepin' 
 Telephone stay ringin' with the boys every weekend 
 Takes a look and peekin making sure you ain't seein 
 Then you know that n**** ain't shit 
 If he don't answer his phone and his car ain't parked at home 
 And you know he love to bone 'cause he hate to be alone 
 And you catch him with a show and you say that he is grown 
 Then you know that n**** ain't shit 
 If his momma lie for him and his brother do to 
 And his sister say girl hes gonna do what he do 
 And you know hes tellin' lies tryna make you think they true 
 Then you know that n**** ain't shit 
 If he say that he was workin and you juss came through 
 But his boss say he called in with the flu 
 When you check his voicemail some chicks sayin' where are you 
 You know that n**** ain't shit 
 Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 
 Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit [x8]
