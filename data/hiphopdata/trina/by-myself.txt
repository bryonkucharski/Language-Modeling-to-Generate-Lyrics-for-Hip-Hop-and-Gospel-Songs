I feel like I'm by myself 
 I feel like I'm by myself 
 Out here I'm so alone 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 I don't need you no, no more 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 No pain, no more, no more 
 All my tears and all my cryin' 
 Nothin' is change 'cause you still lyin' 
 What you're sellin' I'm not buyin' 
 Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go 
 I don't need your circumstances 
 I'll just leave it, take my chances 
 Tired of playin' in fake romances 
 Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go 
 You said that you'll be forever truly 
 How you lied so clearly 
 You can start over 
 But you won't be near me 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 I don't need you no, no more 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 No pain, no more, no more 
 Now put yourself in my position 
 I'm a late-night trickin' 
 While you home cookin' 
 I went my dog's right and lookin' 
 Oh, we in the strip club 
 Throwin' up dozens 
 When you ask me for some cash 
 I'm lookin' at you funny 
 I ain't got no money 
 Baby, I'm broken 
 I can do you how I wanna 
 'Cause I pay your card though 
 Remember I've given you the check 
 I'm the nigga 
 I got friends so whatever 
 I understand that you're better 
 You said that you'll be forever truly 
 How you lied so clearly 
 You can start over 
 But you won't be near me 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 I don't need you no, no more 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 No pain, no more, no more 
 You said that it'll be forever truly 
 How you lied so clearly 
 You can start over 
 But you won't be near me 
 You said that it'll be forever truly 
 How you lied so clearly 
 You can start over 
 But you won't be near me 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 I don't need you no, no more 
 Every time I turn around, I see your face, boy 
 I wish I was by myself 
 Said, I wish I was by myself 
 No pain, no more, no more
