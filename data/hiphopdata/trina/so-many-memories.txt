Breathe... 
 (So many memories) 
 You gotta let the tears fall for this one 
 (So many memories) 
 Breath 
 (So many memories) 
 9-27-82 born 
 Look into my eyes 
 I'm so torn 
 Slow down baby and get a clear view 
 'Cause when you roll down your windows 
 I'm in your rear view 
 Hold on baby boy 
 I know its hard for ya 
 But ya girl got your back 
 And I'ma ride for ya 
 And I swear for god, I'd die for ya 
 How'd I look in your eyes and still lie to ya? 
 Now when you look in my eyes, I just cry to ya 
 Chris brown made it hard to say goodbye to ya 
 I still remember those days I got a dial tone 
 Tears fallin' from my eyes 
 But I held on 
 Now your memories are all I've got to live on 
 All outta my zone 
 I can't move on 
 Hurts worse than death 
 That you so gone 
 But the chapter is done 
 Poof, be gone 
 I wipe away my tears 
 I got my swag back 
 Word out on the streets is that ya girl is back 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 I got your name tattooed so tha world could see 
 I dreamt one day we'd make we 
 A boy for you and a girl for me 
 But one day just outta tha blue 
 That boy for you became a dream come true 
 (So many memories) 
 Now 
 I'm stressin 
 No restin 
 You chillin' 
 Its killin' 
 We... gone 
 Yeah and now I'm back in my zone 
 I got so many sayin' I should leave it alone 
 Give it up let it go 'cause your boy is gone 
 Stop drivin' by his crib 'cause your boy ain't home 
 Stop lookin' at your pager and stop callin his phone 
 You better act like you fly and put your lip gloss on 
 Put your ass in ya jeans and get your grown girl on 
 You shoulda listened to your mama and picked up that phone 
 One call ain't hurt 
 I shed blood for you 
 And when them niggas started hatin' I threw slugs for you 
 Now all that's left is what was of you 
 And now I wanna wake up 'cause there's no you 
 And now I'm down on my knees askin "what'd I do?" 
 'Cause baby life means nothin' to me without you 
 Real love never dies that's what you told me 
 But now your love's flowin all through tha industry 
 And now tha media and press got a hold of we 
 And now tha whole world knows that we ain't we 
 And she ain't we 
 And she ain't me 
 And she can never be 
 Listen up to em 
 'Cause I'm talkin' to you 
 I got a message and its just for you 
 (So many memories) 
 Red carpet next to me is a good look for ya 
 Paparazzi snappin pictures for ya 
 You know I love the way you talk when you real high 
 You ? your bags when you come home and that's fly 
 Baby boy you kept it real and kept me lookin' nice 
 Made it rain in my purse each and every night 
 Back seat of the phantom made it look twice 
 And now it's all just a memory of my life 
 One ring one watch one chain 
 One you one me one name 
 Just let me drown 
 Please don't save me 
 You know you should have held down a little harder baby 
 But now ya girl's on her own 
 No more carter baby 
 I said ya girl's on her own 
 No more carter baby 
 No kissin' 
 No touchin 
 No huggin 
 No snugglin 
 I'm missin' your lovin' 
 My body can't function 
 Now I'm back on my grind 
 I gotta stay fly 
 Ya girl's hot 
 In the ? I'm so high 
 Haters all on my back but they can all die 
 Stuntin just like you daddy no lie 
 Big spender 
 Big whipper 
 ? Sipper 
 I miss ya
