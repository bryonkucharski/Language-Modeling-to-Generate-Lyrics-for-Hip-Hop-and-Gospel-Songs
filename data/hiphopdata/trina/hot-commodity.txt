(Feat. Rick Ross) 
 (Talking: Trina) 
 Yeah, that's that real shit, feel me (feel me) 
 Lay back Maybach, ugh 
 Up in this pussy feel better than the lottery 
 Don't lie to me I'm a hot commodity 
 Six figures from the nigga 'cause he got to be 
 Don't lie to me; I'm what you try to be 
 (Verse 1: Trina) 
 I'm a big girl not a little girl 
 I had a real man 
 Moving real girl 
 We was real close 
 He had real money 
 All he ever asked "never steal from me" 
 That was real shit 
 I'm a real bitch 
 He told me stay real and I'm a make you real rich 
 Back to reality 
 Is this real? 
 Big house on the hill far from Lincoln Field. (oh) 
 I'm so hood, yet I wouldn't stay 
 Couldn't name a price that the nigga wouldn't pay 
 Snap my fingers he'll be over here today 
 If I asks, he'll rub my feet for days 
 Cause up in this pussy feel better than the lottery 
 Don't lie to me I'm a hot commodity 
 Six figures from the nigga 'cause he got to be 
 Don't lie to me; I'm what you try to be 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who is the baddest of them all? 
 Don't lie to me I'm a hot commodity [x2] 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who is the baddest of them all? 
 There was a rubble tubble 5 minutes it lasted 
 You the bitch in the flyest fashions 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Pull up to the crib, park on the grass 
 The boy so trill, spark up the grass 
 She's so real with all kind a ass 
 And 6 inch heels with LV bags

 Cover girl centerfold (fold) got me spendin doe (doe)
