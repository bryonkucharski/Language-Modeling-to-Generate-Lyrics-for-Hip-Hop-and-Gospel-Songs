I'm just tryna make sure 
 That you hear me out there 
 Now when you see the queen coming 
 And the horn start blowing 
 {Hey trina} 
 Everybody start running 
 People in the streets coming 
 {It's been a while baby} 
 {But they still gotta bow down 
 {To tha queen ha-ha yeah 
 Now when you see the queen coming 
 And all the horns start blowing 
 Everybody start running 
 People in the streets coming 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way whoa 
 See the fireworks blowing 
 And the roof start smoking 
 And you know it ain't a game 
 With the lines this woman make way 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way, make way, make way, way 
 Every-time I turn the TV on 
 All I see is trina 
 Everybody so quick to judge me 
 Look how you point the finger 
 Saying he's to good for me 
 When you don't even know me 
 You to lonely, you need 
 To worry bout yours only 
 Like a rag you throw me 
 Some pretend they don't know me 
 Bet you know you owe me 
 Show me homie 
 Tryna steal my pride 
 They make me go harder 
 Do I worry, I don't bother 
 I'ma finish what I started 
 Working more than 9 to 5 
 Keeping it slip an slide dream alive 
 Look at some of these chicks that try{try} 
 Half of them lost their flame they die{die} 
 While I been walking on fire 
 I'm earning to go higher 
 Never kick out the game 
 I shall retired, now put that on the wirer 
 I crap the game like pliers 
 I'm doing the whole dash 
 Staring like I'm wearing tires 
 Can't, to fine to stop{can't, to fine stop} 
 I'ma diva studio to states 
 My people gotta make way 
 For queen before I clear the streets 
 Now if you see the queen coming 
 All the horns are blowing 
 And everybody start running 
 People in the streets coming 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way, make way, make way

 See the fireworks blowing 
 And the roof start smoking 
 And you know it ain't a game 
 With the lines this woman make way 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way, make way, make way, way 
 What makes you think this life 
 More easier for me 
 If you can only see 
 If ain't all that is crack up to be 
 More money, more problems 
 When you living like this 
 If you ain't making hits 
 Than you ain't about shit 
 Fans go to talking 
 Neighbors go to shopping 
 Am I'm really human 
 Is when I go to talking 
 Huffin an the puffin 
 Tears start fallin' 
 Than the whole turns cold 
 That's when you wanna pick your coffin 
 But I ain't giving up 
 I ain't never be a quiter 
 I go hard on everything 
 I'm a natural born winner 
 When natural born sinner 
 But I'm praying for forgiveness 
 Some-times I pinch my-self 
 Than I realize I live this 
 Some say relentless 
 I say forgiveness 
 That's when I pinch my-self 
 And than I realize I live this 
 Some say relentless 
 I say forgiveness 
 That's when I pinch my-self 
 And than I realize I live this 
 Now when you see the queen coming 
 And all the horns start blowing 
 Everybody start running 
 People in the streets coming 
 Make way, make way, make way 
 Make way, make way, make way

 See the fireworks blowing 
 And the roof start smoking 
 And you know it ain't a game 
 With the lines this woman make way
