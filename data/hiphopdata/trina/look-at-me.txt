I got an ass so big like the sun 
 Hope you got a mile for a dick, I wanna run 
 Slap it in my face, shove it down my throat 
 Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy smoke 
 I know how to fuck, I know how to ride 
 I can spin around and keep the dick still inside 
 Now your mouth wide, you looking real scared 
 I'm a maneater, headhunter, I'm prepared 
 Yeah you running now, you running 
 I'ma put this pussy on you just like this 
 Put this pussy in yo jaws now, smack 
 Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain't coming back 
 Collard greens, neckbones, nigga chew this ass 
 Both hold inspections, don't stop 'til it pass 
 Licky licky licky licky licky for a hour 
 I'ma make it rain for you here's a golden shower 
 Smell it like a flower, my pussy is a rose 
 Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your nose 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict 
 Thoroughbred red broad in my bed 
 Up all night, took pipe, gave head 
 Ass like Trina, face like Mya 
 Shot it on her chest she said, "Daddy, aim higher" 
 Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked 
 Gave her mayonnaise on the face, pearl necklace 
 We turned the camera on we did a sex scene 
 She called me R. Kelly and I called her 
 That's my bitch right there nigga 
 Hand full of ass and a fist full of weed 
 Ass in the air, face down on your knees 
 I'm a beast when I fuck, I'ma put it in your gut 
 I'ma have you saying, "No, please, let me get off" 
 I'ma make you say that's the spot don't take it out 
 I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your mouth 
 Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the South 
 And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Back it up, drop down to your knees 
 Bring it up real slow make one cheek freeze 
 Back it up, drop down to your knees 
 Bring it up real slow make one cheek freeze 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict 
 (Look look look look) 
 Back at you for what? 
 I'm trying to concentrate on busting me a nut 
 I'm thinking about Trav, I'm thinking about Bo 
 Little dick nigga, shit, hurry up, I gotta go 
 Since they in prison pussy nigga make me know 
 That you ain't a virgin, ain't you done this before? 
 Fuck me 'til you can't breath, 'til you swim and scream help 
 It's your lucky day all the lifeguards left 
 Little dick ass nigga 
 You better get your face down here and eat this pussy 
 Dribble these titties on your lips 
 While you're doing that put your hands around my hips 
 Bounce me like a ball, slam me like K-Mart 
 On and off the dick better known for breaking hearts 
 Nigga call a cab I'm finna pack my shit and leave 
 Shouldn't have let you fuck, now that's some shit I can't believe 
 Wasting my time fucking all off beat 
 Pussy nigga next time when you see me don't speak 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, look back at me 
 Look back at me, look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 Look back at me, girl 
 If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
