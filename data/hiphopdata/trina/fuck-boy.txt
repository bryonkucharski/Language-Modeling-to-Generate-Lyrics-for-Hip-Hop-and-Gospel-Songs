Six in the morning, nigga at my door 
 I'm tryna figure out what he out that for 
 Last time I seen him he was talking shit 
 Found out his new girl can't suck no dick 
 Hit the intercom I ain't let him in 
 Pussy nigga lucky I ain't fuck his friends 
 Prolly thought at bitch, Would be down and out 
 Till he seen my riding round in that chromed out Benz 
 South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life 
 You cross that bridge they taking all the ice 
 You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom 
 Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pipe 
 You's a fuck boy, fuck boy 
 My bitch been said it 
 That's why I should've let your best friend get it 
 We went on trips you bought Chanel 
 But money ain't shit when you soft as hell 
 'Cause you's a fuck boy, fuck boy 
 My momma even said it 
 Got a new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it 
 You still gon talk and that's a got damn shame 
 But a hoe gon be a hoe and a lame gon be a lame FUCK BOY 
 You never heard me asking niggas for shit 
 You be on the gram asking niggas for pics 
 Can't believe I let you waste all my time 
 Now this fuck boy on my voicemail crying 
 Running round town with your bum ass hoe 
 But I'm the blueprint that's why you at my door 
 She my number one fan that's what makes it sweet 
 Bitch'll do anything for a fucking retweet 
 South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life 
 You cross that bridge they taking all that ice 
 You don't want no problems with the boys from the bottom 
 Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pipe 
 You's a fuck boy, fuck boy 
 My bitch been said it 
 That's why I shoulda let your best friend get it 
 We went on trips you bought Chanel 
 But money ain't shit when you soft as hell 
 'Cause you's a fuck boy, fuck boy 
 My momma even said it 
 Got a new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it 
 You still gon talk and that's a got damn shame 
 But a hoe gon be a hoe and a lame gon be a lame FUCK BOY 
 South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life 
 You cross that bridge they taking all that ice 
 You don't want no problems with the boys from the bottom 
 Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pipe
