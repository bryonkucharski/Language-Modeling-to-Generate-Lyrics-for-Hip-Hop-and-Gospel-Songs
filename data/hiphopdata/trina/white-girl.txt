(Verse 1: ~Trina~) 
 Don perion people layin on my lawn 
 Gettin' wasted by the cases 
 And my hairs not even blonde (even blonde) 
 Wanna pull me ova see me crossin ova 
 I'm supernova middle finger to a hata if you thought it was ova 
 Like ooh shawty what it do 
 I wanna get loose and party like a white girl 
 (Chorus: ~Git Fresh~) 
 Baby, I can hear the party 
 Get a little naughty 
 You turn me on 
 So baby, let me see you swallow 
 Drink it up the bottle 
 Let's have some fun 
 Party like a (white girl) [x8] 
 (Verse 2: Trina)

 Say my name I'm famous but shhh don't wake the neighbors

 So baby, let me see you swallow 
 Drink it up the bottle
