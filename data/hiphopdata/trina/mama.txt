Mama I wanna thank you 
 For sharing your blessings upon me 
 Taking time to understand the lady I wanna be 
 Yes mama 
 Mama I wanna thank you 
 For sharing your blessings upon me 
 Taking time to understand the lady I wanna be 
 This cold world had me num the pain like novacaine 
 Till mama sat me down unfold the gate 
 Showed me the straight path through the narrow lane 
 Sunshine after rain the joy of pain 
 Mama you raised a good girl don't worry 
 You used to say take it slow trina don't hurry 
 Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story 
 Now I grown up and you still there for me 
 My shoulder to lean on 
 You kept my dreams goin' 
 I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing 
 And I'm gon always be yo baby 
 And I can't never repay you for all the things that you gave me 
 You raised me to be a lady 
 And you scoot me to the game so them niggas couldn't play me 
 You was more than a mother you was a friend 
 The greatest love of all comes from within 
 I know ill never kknow love like this again 
 And beneath my wings you was the wind 
 I love you like none other 
 Cause you can only live your whole life but only get one mother 
 Being there for me through the thick and thin 
 More than a mother you're my best friend 
 Look within and take yo place 
 Sometimes I wanna run to ya 
 Through the ups and downs I know I can still come to ya 
 I think 'bout the things I done to ya 
 But through all the drama I know I'm still number one to ya 
 Uh, look at how far you brought me 
 All the things you have taught me 
 Money couldn't bought me 
 You never wanted us to make the same mistakes 
 When the game got high and they raised the stakes 
 You was still in my corner to press the brace 
 Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe 
 Through the thick and thin I'm gon be there for ya 
 I say a prayer for ya 
 Lord knows I care for ya 
 Through hard times we got strong or mother to daughter 
 When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water 
 Can't nobody replace you 
 I'm forever faithful 
 For you mama I'm grateful 
 Your baby girl is a reflection of you 
 I thank the lord up above 'cause he blessed me with you, uh 
 I love you like none other 
 Cause you can live your whole life but you can only get one mother 
 (Yes mama) 
 Mama I wanna thank you 
 For sharing your blessings upon me (oh mama) 
 Taking time to understand 
 The lady I wanna be (keep reapeting till fades out)
