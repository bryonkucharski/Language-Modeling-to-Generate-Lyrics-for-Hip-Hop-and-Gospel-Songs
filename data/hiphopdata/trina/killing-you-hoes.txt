Ah ah ah yep yep yep 
 The baddest bitch is back, 
 I'm back part 2, part 2 
 I'm reloaded and I'm killin you hoes 
 [Chorus: x2] 
 You see dat outfit bitch 
 I'm killin you hoes 
 Cute face and ass swoll 
 I'm killin you hoes 
 I got the best pussy out 
 I'm killin you hoes 
 And ain't non you can do about 
 I'm killin you hoes 
 I don't care what a bitch think or how a hoe feel 
 Cause ain't nann one of you hoes payin my bills 
 And ain't nann one of you hoes fina buy me a crib 
 And ain't nann one of you hoes fina get me a whip 
 I know I must make a lot of ya'll hoes sick 
 And all I can tell you hoes, get used to it bitch! 
 Cause Ms. Trina the baddest as it fuckin get 
 And I don't sweat niggas and I don't fight over dick 
 So while you fuckin for free, I'm tryna get rich 
 And don't you cross that line cause I get hot quick 
 And if you do it's gonna be me & u up in this bitch 
 And I'm gonna show you why they call me the baddest bitch 
 [Chorus x2] 
 You see dat outfit bitch (bitch) 
 And you know what it costs 
 Look at how my ass poke out when I walk 
 Cause your nigga wanna fuck me it ain't my fault 
 And my pussy sit up real nice in ma shorts 
 Hate or love it, cause you broke hoes gonna talk 
 And I can go in any club and shut that bitch down 
 And I can come to your city and make it my town 
 So when you see me hoe you better smile and don't frown 
 Cause I got a couple of my dawgs that ready to clamp 
 And you'd be best off sittin your tired ass down 
 And all you jealous ass hoes better move round 
 And ask these hoes in Dade how it gets down 
 [Chorus x2] 
 The topic of discussion, I can fuck whoever I want 
 Look at me bitch I got everything you hoes want 
 I can fuck a nigga in the Bentley or a nigga in the dump 
 You get your money in pieces I get mines in a lump 
 You only ballin on weekends, 
 I'm ballin the whole month 
 I'm just a hood bitch, 
 Rich suburbia cash, 
 A little fly ass chick who got alota class 
 I wanna spend your money nigga and put mine in a stash 
 You got me fucked up cause Trina gonna have the last laugh 
 Get your hustling hoe, look like your doin bad 
 You lost alota weight shit, you fallin off fast 
 I feel sorry for ya' might let you borrow some ass 
 [Chorus x2]
