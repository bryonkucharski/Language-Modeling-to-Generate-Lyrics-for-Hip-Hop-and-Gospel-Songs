(Dee) 
 Yeah, Look here Trina 
 Look me and you we been friends for a minutes, but you know how we get down. 
 Late nights you know how we do. 
 We go our separate ways, but lately I been feelin' kinda different like me catchin feelings for you. 
 You know when you callm e daddy, and all that. 
 When you comb my hair? For real... 
 (Verse 1 - Dee) 
 I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her homie, lover, friend, we were just passionate. 
 Now you got me feenin for more. 
 When other niggas used to call you after midnight it never bothered me. 
 Girl we was only friends right so why does it hurt more and more? 
 Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone. 
 I got a special ringer every time my phone rings it goes,.. 
 " I can't leave you alone," 
 You got my feening, feenin, feenin. 
 So baby I'm pleading for you ... bring your body home to me and let me lay you down. 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy 
 Girl I love it when you call my daddy. 
 Baby you're my sexy lil mama 
 Slip in my bedroom girl, and we can get it on. 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy

 (Verse 2 - Trina) 
 I'm tired of the fightin, the fussin, and cussin late night discussions 
 Of who you think I'm fuckin'. 
 You puttin' me on guilt trips like I can't see 
 You storin his name for hers in your caller ID. 
 Look, I'm a queen the don diva 
 We should just free in the lime green Selene 2 seater 
 You and me. 
 My top down, and Yes my hairs blowin' 
 Flashbacks of you and me got me moanin, 
 But who you lovin' who you want to be huggin? 
 I seen her in your 600, and you claim it's your cousin. 
 Look, I know we agreed to see other people, 
 But those feelings got shattered though like my langurae see through. 
 We both play this game unfaithfully 
 See me with the next man and now you want to play with me. 
 Yo, I'm confused, but I still want to proceed 
 Without you I'm incomplete you make me so week 
 I love it when you say... 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy 
 Girl I love it when you call my daddy. 
 Baby you're my sexy lil mama 
 Slip in my bedroom girl, and we can get it on. 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy 
 Girl I love it when you call my daddy.

 (Verse 3 - Trina) 
 I remember late nights when we would just kiss. 
 I remember wearin them girtles and when we would take them trips, 
 And I remember that we said it would never come to this. 
 Never let something come between our relationship. 
 Now how can I leave you to be with someone else? 
 Without finding out how you truly felt. 
 All them riding on hoarses and creeping and abortions, 
 The thoughts of marriage - all white - playin' organs. 
 Started from the ruff sex on the deck of the yacht. 
 Followed by the Don Perion then the caneri watch. 
 All them shoes from Italy it was cool, 
 Even the Villa in Sicily, but it wasn't me. 
 But I should have made it crystal clear that I didn't really care 
 Whether you was dead broke or you was a millionaire, 
 From our first date to our anniversary, 
 My thoughts changed of leaving when I heard you say to me... 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy 
 Girl I love it when you call my daddy. 
 Baby you're my sexy lil mama 
 Slip in my bedroom girl, and we can get it on. 
 Girl bring your body home to daddy 
 Girl I love it when you call my daddy. 
 Baby you're my sexy lil mama 
 Slip in my bedroom girl, and we can get it on.
