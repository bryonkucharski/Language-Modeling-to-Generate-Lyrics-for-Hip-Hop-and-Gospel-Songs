Uh Yeah, Oh Yeah 
 Trin' Bein I've Got Ya 
 Yeah I'm On That Syzurp my 
 Ya Off Tha 
 Hey! Hey! 
 (1st Verse: Lil Wayne) 
 Go by the name of Weezie F. 
 An fuck 'em out the belly store with ten bags? 
 Fly as a mutha fucka girly on my staple 
 Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker 
 Don't go below the navel 
 I'm up in Lil Hatti 
 I'm blowin' on Jamaica 
 I'm in the pimp a beemer 
 I'm with a salt shaker 
 Now I'm in Dave County 
 I see some thick bitches 
 I try to holla at em 
 But they all trick bitches 
 I think Trina sexy 
 Mama ya wine fine 
 And on the hush hush 
 We need some quiet time 
 Yeah I'm a ridah ma 
 The Birdman's boy 
 He own CA$H MONEY 
 I pre own CA$H MONEY? 
 Yeah and I put her on CA$H MONEY 
 She start wobblin that ass for me 
 She start modelin 
 She see the models in the Maybach 
 She call me Weezie F. Baby 
 And she make sure she say that 
 (Lil' Wayne) 
 See a fly nigga baby yeah I don't trip 
 Just give 'em lil thigh 
 Mama give 'em lil hip 
 (Trina) 
 And if you see a fly bitch 
 Nigga holla don't trip 
 Break her off a few dollars 
 Take her on a few trips 
 (Lil' Wayne) 
 Give 'em lil die 
 Mama give 'em lil hip 
 Then you give 'em Lil whind up 
 Give 'em a lil dip 
 (Trina) 
 And if you see a fly bitch 
 Nigga holla don't trip 
 Break her off a few dollars 
 Take her on a few trips 
 (2nd Verse: Trina) 
 Now I'm the daughter of a madam 
 Inside of a pink phantom 
 If ya man got that cash 
 Then best believe I met him 
 'Cause I'm sharp as a machete 
 And I cuss like Freddie? 
 Niggas call me Betty Crocker 
 Cause my cakes stay plenty 
 Got stacks on top of stacks 
 Cup in the meal ticket 
 No matter the consequence 
 My emphasis is to get it 
 It's Trina Weezie F. Baby 
 Mannie handle the scripts 
 It's all reminiscent to 
 Gladys night in the pips? 
 All my niggas jump around 
 Girls jump on that dick 
 It ain't gonna be no standin around 
 Now let's get crunk in this bitch 
 And ladies 
 Show 'em yo shit 
 A lil hip a lil thigh 
 More pressure for the eye 
 And the more a nigga try 
 You can find me stretched out 
 In my 850i 
 Or my big 600 
 Believe Trina done it 
 Believe them diamonds studded 
 Stay flooded like a damn 
 Chase grams 'cause I am what I am 
 Don't give a damn 
 Go 
 (3rd Verse: Trina) 
 Back to the lesson at hand 
 Stick to my plan 
 When it comes to seein man after man 
 Don't give a damn about his car or his friends 
 Wh Wh WhWhat 
 'Cause I'm gonna make my on ends 
 That's WhWhat's up 
 Ladies lets say you want a man 
 But don't know how to do it 
 Dirty dance with em 
 Put a lil back into it 
 Look at yo wall shorty 
 End up at the mall sporty 
 Try to dog waddy? 
 Make 'em spend it all on ya 
 Yep and make that nigga ball for ya 
 Then have him beggin for that kitty kat 
 Wining and dining for that ass 
 Give him none of that 
 Just let him know 
 Say make a bitch rich 
 Cause the badest bitch taught you that
