(Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks 
 Lick tha pearl tongue nigga keep tha dick 
 Get tha fuck out after I cum 
 So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run 
 (Trina) 
 See, me and my boo's we got grands to use 
 With terrible attitudes nigga, who needs you? 
 Huh, you got your dirty ass feet on my couch 
 And smokin' motherfuckin weed in my house 
 Is you sick yo? 
 I want YOU to get him and your dogs, 
 To stop grabbin doornobs, and hustle and rob 
 Or job, get tha fuck out of dodge (you heard that?) 
 You eat me to sleep you don't even deserve that 
 'Cause I'm a bank roll havin' bitch 
 Mercedes Benz 6- double o havin' bitch, I'm fabulous 
 And immaculate with nice curves 
 I game hers for the furs, and the Iceberg 
 You got nerves, old broke ass, not havin' no doe ass 
 Slow ass, sleepin' on my floor ass, no yay your ass nigga 
 You fake bitch, you make women hate dick, 'cause you ain't shit 
 (Lois Lane) 
 You that same old nigga 
 With tha same low figures 
 'Cept the lies gettin' bigga 
 And the sex lacks the vigor 
 Got used to the quickies, now your ass is just wack 
 Tryin' to fuck my girl, behind my back, imajin that 
 I told her go ahead and try it just for the laughter 
 Now whe're feelin' bad for all tha hoes you're goin' after 
 Looks can be deceivin, and you're poppin' much game 
 Crib in your moms name, claim of fortune and fame 
 Dressed in ICEBERG, sensors still attached 
 Rockin' a gator, fake rolly, hollow links to match 
 I sit back and watch, as you dig yourself deeper 
 Digits all in your beeper, you want her, better keep her 
 Last night you was all up in the club, slingin grips 
 Slippin DJ Roslay, givin' dick tips away 
 They say, you was holdin' like you just went pro 
 But little did they know, you was flossin my doe 
 No, I got to go, before you cause a bitch to flip 
 From waistline to the bottom, you know niggas ain't shit 
 (Trina) 
 You ain't shit to me yo 
 I'm spendin grands down in Rio 
 Manaje' in trio, garage like it cee-lo 
 4-5-6, Range Rov, 4.6 we lay low 
 While y'all hoes slob dick, you back wit ballin ass 
 Niggas ain't shit, taste the clit 
 And y'all pussy lickin' and shit 
 Wanna go low on me like a basement? 
 That's why I don't see none of y'all 
 You better reconize bitch, while I sit in front of y'all 
 I don't owe you shit, nigga you owe me 
 I'm bout to change the locks, nigga keep the door key 
 You better get your shit, take it to your mamy house 
 Let me show you what a bitch from Miami bout 
 You got me fucked up, nigga ain't no free nut 
 Unless you comin' VVS marquis cut 
 (Chorus (repeat till end)
