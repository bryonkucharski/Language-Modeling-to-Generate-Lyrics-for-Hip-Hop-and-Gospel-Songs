(Feat. Qwote) 
 Do you Trina take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband 
 To have and to hold from this day forward 
 For better or for worse 
 For richer for poorer 
 In sickness and in health 
 To love and to cherish 
 Form this day forward 
 Until death do you part 
 Uh! 
 I guess I wasn't enough for you 
 The things I done for you 
 Call me I run to you 
 Whenever you want me to 
 What have I done to make you hurt me a time or two 
 Probably more then a few 
 My heart still beats for you 
 Wonder what did I do 
 Damn I should've knew 
 But still didn't have a clue 
 My life would be so blue 
 Yeah I'm hurt it's true 
 Not feeling me next to you 
 Laughing at things you do 
 Kissing and calling me boo 
 Now it's hard to eat 
 Damn I feel so weak 
 And I can't get no sleep 
 My eyes continue to leak 
 Pouring out like the rain 
 This hurts more then pain 
 Apologizes with the pain 
 I went against the brain 
 Baby please don't go 
 I need you more 'n' more 
 I'm breaking down on the floor 
 One thing you should know 
 Is that I got you 
 No matter who tells you that 
 The love we had was wack 
 Know that I need you back here 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Baby Don't walk away 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Just stay with me 
 'Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart 
 And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart 
 Don't walk away (Don't walk away) 
 Don't walk away (Don't walk away) 
 From me 
 Uh 
 So baby tell me that this ain't true 
 I open my heart to you 
 I changed the game for you 
 Gave up my friends for you 
 My life just ain't the same 
 I'm Reaching 'n' calling your name 
 Remember the things I do 
 Cooking and cleaning for you 
 Taking good care of you and 
 Making sweet love to you 
 Baby just close your eyes 
 And picture my hips and thighs 
 Laying right next to you 
 I'm getting the best of you 
 Tell me you need me back 
 I promise I'm running right back 
 How did It come to this 
 Why did you run from this 
 My loving you got to miss 
 With you I was full of bliss 
 Baby please don't go 
 I just can't take no more 
 I'm screaming and kicking 
 Cause really I needs to know 
 Tell me she's not the one 
 Tell me I'm number one 
 And baby can you please tell me and you are still one 
 Baby it's tough love 
 Cause you been rough on me 
 I really miss the way you used to put that dick on me 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Baby Don't walk away 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Just stay with me 
 'Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart 
 And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart 
 Don't walk away (Don't walk away) 
 Don't walk away (Don't walk away) 
 From me 
 Can't you see 
 What the hell you doing to me 
 I'm soaking wet (In tears) 
 Crying baby (over you) 
 All on my knees 
 I'm begging and pleading not to leave 
 So say that you'll stay (say that you'll stay) 
 Baby please stay (Pleaseee Stay) 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Baby Don't walk away 
 Baby Don't go Don't go [x3] 
 Just stay with me
