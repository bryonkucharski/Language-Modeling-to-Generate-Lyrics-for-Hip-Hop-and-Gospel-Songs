(Feat. Qwote) 
 (Trina: spoken) 
 Hi this is trina 
 And I'm standing 5'2 125 pounds 34, 26, 36 
 Beautiful light grey eyes, long black curly hair that 
 Hangs down to the middle of my back and right now I'm home alone and 
 I'm looking to try something new so if your listening 
 Why don't you leave me a message 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 (Chorus: Qwote) 
 Take your hands and close your eyes and picture me 
 Touching your thighs do you feel your body next to me 
 I'm in your mind but physically it feels so real when we're on the phone 
 The way you talk and the moan I put your body to the test it's not 
 A fantasy but it's phone sex 
 Trina: 
 What's your description I told you mine I was feeling real horny 
 Called the party line dude sounded so good I ain't waste 
 No time I'm a take my clothes off and just go for mine 
 The way that he was talking and describing himself I picture 
 Reggie bush and I ain't seeing nothing else my eyes closed tight 
 On the living room couch one hand up my (uummm) putting fingers 
 In my mouth cheating on my man I'm getting my freak on long as it ain't real 
 I ain't doing nothing wrong just a dirty fantasy on the 
 Football field me laid in the grass wanna love how it feel 
 Pulling on my hair biting on my lips throwing it back thrusting my hips 
 Pouring champagne down and he taking sweet sips got me bout to climax he took me on a trip ah 
 Take your hands and close your eyes and picture me 
 Touching your thighs do you feel your body next to me 
 I'm in your mind but physically it feels so real when we're on the phone 
 The way you talk and the way you moan I put your body to the test it's not 
 A fantasy but it's phone sex 
 Trina: 
 The next day I called the party line again I was looking for that voice 
 That's when I bumped in a thug that sounded like trick to me 
 You should have heard that nasty fantasy 
 He made me see us in a school house 
 I was the last student left and was bout to walk out 
 He said bend over and show him a shot in my private school skirt 
 So arroused I got hard as a mistle I blew on his whistle playing back and forth 
 For this nigga I can't dismiss you he asked can I kiss then I got wet 
 This phone bone thing is getting better than sex don't need protection everythings 
 Safe I even let him spank me I came on his (ah) I know he was so amazed 
 To hear me come on the phone we wasn't playing no games 
 We was getting it on ah 
 Qwote: 
 Do you feel me baby sexing your body touching you softly 
 Making you want me go head close your eyes 
 Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize 
 From the other end of the line do you feel me baby sexing your body 
 Touching you softly making you want me go head close your eyes 
 Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize 
 From the other end of the line 
 Take your hands and close your eyes and picture me 
 Touching your thighs do you feel your body next to me 
 I'm in your mind but physically it feels so real when we're on the phone 
 The way you talk and the moan I put your body to the test it's not 
 A fantasy but it's phone sex
