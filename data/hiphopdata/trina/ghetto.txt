Long nails, pack of weave 
 Dutches and a bag of weed 
 That's all a bitch like you need 
 You from the fucking ghetto 
 That Reggie Miller that you push 
 Don't be burning like that Cush 
 You gone need that Reggie bush 
 Fucking with the ghetto 
 Moscato filling up my cup 
 Run outs we don't give a fuck 
 New folk get me so fucked up 
 Coming from the ghetto 
 So watch it when you in tha south 
 And watch what you say out your mouth 
 And watch yo step 'cause slippers count 
 When you in the ghetto 
 Wife beater, nigga Tim's 
 Slide in with some bigger rims 
 Flip a key and hit the flee 
 And go an get some bigger gyms 
 Tha hood is in the building man 
 I'll get you in your feelings man 
 It's some shit outside your house 
 With rims tha size of ceiling fans 
 I'm the pride of King Kong 
 I'm stomping through the Congo 
 I can make it clap clap, beat it like a bongo 
 Cat got your tongue 
 You tell that pussy let you tongue go 
 Wouldn't of did this shit right here 
 So gutter but the song so 
 Ghetto, country, hood, ratchet 
 Put your hands up if you fucking that shit 
 Ghetto, ya know opposite of busse 
 Twelve inch yaki, big round booties 
 Ghetto 
 Way to hello, say I'm ghetto 
 Fly with the medal 
 Tell 'em that it is what it is 
 I make it do what it do 
 And I love where I live 
 And my people love it too, 'cause we ghetto 
 You in the Benz in the projects 
 Lights in yo mama's name 
 You hustle lock yo celly 
 And that's the third time yo number changed 
 Transport airbrush, outside speakers on 
 Valentino pussy huggers 
 High heel sneakers on 
 My feet done, nails too 
 All on the front porch 
 You cooking in some Vicki's ass 
 Hanging out yo boy shorts 
 Camouflage stiletto's 
 And diamonds on her metro 
 Tatted silhouettes, 'cause wet is just so fu**ing ghetto 
 Dope game, bond man 
 Bonds money, bonds man 
 That's how you spend funds man 
 When you in the ghetto 
 If you make your money easy 
 And yo swag is off tha heezy 
 And yo favorite rapper Jeezy 
 You are muthafucking ghetto 
 Hundred dollar jeans on 
 Price tag bragging 
 But tha world kiss yo ass 
 So you where them fucka's sagging 
 CD of the newest choice 
 And Nike's be tha shoe of choice 
 Candy paint, 24's 
 Boosters, hoes, and licka stores 
 (Ghetto, so fu**ing ghetto) 
 Tomboys, hot boys 
 Hammer laying in your lap 
 Got bitches laying in your bed 
 And robbers laying in your trap 
 Dubs on the four wheela 
 TV's in the headrest 
 And hundred dolla best 
 'Cause he was tricking give tha head best 
 Section eight with chase 
 Eviction notice getting served 
 Child support, hood homes 
 Advance on the fucking third 
 Bootleg DVD's 
 Rico had anotha kid 
 Income tax checks 
 You claiming other people's kids 
 More hard gold teeth, tattoos dreadlocks 
 You serving out tha room window 
 Oh now you call it bedrock 
 Lace front, long lashes 
 Looking for a trap star 
 Now every nigga in the ghetto 
 He thinkin' he a rap star 
 Fully automatic stick 
 Out a town a dummy brick 
 Now watch him role and watch him stick 
 When you in the ghetto 
 Pills, dro, kid, blow 
 And people you don't wanna know 
 Weed bags, corner stores 
 It's so muthaf**in ghetto
