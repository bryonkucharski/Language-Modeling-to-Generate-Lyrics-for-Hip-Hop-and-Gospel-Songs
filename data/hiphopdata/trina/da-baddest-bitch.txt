 I'm representin' for the bitches 
 All eyes on your riches 
 No time for the little dicks 
 You see the bigger the dick 
 The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz 
 The better the chance to get close to his rich friends 
 I'm going after the big man 
 My G-string make his dick stand 
 Make it quick then slow head by the night stand 
 Like lightning I wanna nigga with a wedding ring 
 Bank accounts in the Philippines 
 Black man to take care of things 
 See I fuck him in the living room 
 While his children ain't home 
 I make him eat it while my period on 
 A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho 
 Young jazzy ho and don't be scared 
 'Cause if you're curious just ask me hoes 
 And yes dick sucking comes quite natural 
 'Cause I'm da baddest bitch what 
 (Trick Daddy) (Trina) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

 See I hate hoes who take their niggas on talk shows and for hoes 
 (Y'all sold fool) 
 See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross 
 And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho 
 See I'm unemployed with no boss ho 
 While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho 
 See it pays to be the boss ho 
 Shit that's how you floss hoes 
 X-rated elevated, buck naked 
 And I'd probably fuck your daddy if your mammy wasn't playa hatin' 
 'Cause I'm da baddest bitch 
 I'm da baddest bitch 
 (Trick Daddy) (Trina) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

 I got game for you young hoes 
 Don't grow to be a dumb ho 
 That's a no-no 
 See if you off the chains 
 Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo 
 Sell the pussy by the grands 
 And in months you own a Benz 
 Another week a set of rims 
 See if I had the chance to be a virgin again 
 I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten 
 See off glass is my motto 
 Dick sucking in the auto 
 Quick fucking 'bout to follow 
 On the back of the truck 
 Or when I'm dead ass drunk 
 But I don't get high though 
 I never took it up the ass 
 Often tried but I pass 
 And from what I heard it ain't bad 
 I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off 
 From the baby's dad 
 'Cause I'm da baddest bitch 
 (Trick Daddy) (Trina) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (Shit I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 Who's bad? Who's, who's bad? 
 (That's right I'm the baddest bitch) 
 Who's bad?
