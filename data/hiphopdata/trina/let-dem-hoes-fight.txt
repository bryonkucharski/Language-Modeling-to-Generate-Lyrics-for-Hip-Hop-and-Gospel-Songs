(Let them hoes die) 
 Stop stressin' on me for the attention 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 You're excused, you're no competition 
 (Let them hoes die) 
 Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin' 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in 
 I was lookin' hella good 
 When I stepped off in the club 
 She was jockin' on my Gucci 
 'Cause her boyfriend want my cookie 
 She just keep on lookin' back 
 I keep throwin' her the bird 
 I'm about to walk away 
 I don't care what you heard 
 Watch me, watch me swing my weave 
 I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss 
 I'm gon' stunt on them hoes 
 With my hands up on my hip bones singin' 
 Jealous bitches, jealous bitches 
 Don't hate me, don't hate me 
 (Let them hoes die) 
 Stop stressin' on me for the attention 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 You're excused, you're no competition 
 (Let them hoes die) 
 Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin' 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in 
 (Let them hoes die) 
 Stop stressin' on me for the attention 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 You're excused, you're no competition 
 (Let them hoes die) 
 Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin' 
 (Let them hoes fight) 
 Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in 
 He keep giving me the look 
 Like he wanna make me holla 
 I feel like I'm in the club 
 'Cause he throwin' me them dollas 
 He keeps sendin' me these drinks 
 'Cause you lookin' like his grandma 
 I got, got, got it 
 Pathetic if you're knowin' this is drama 
 Watch me, watch me swing my weave 
 I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss 
 I'm gon' stunt on them hoes 
 With my hands up on my hip bones singin' 
 Jealous bitches, jealous bitches 
 Don't hate me, don't hate me
