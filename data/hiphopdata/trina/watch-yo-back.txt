(Chorus - Twista) 
 Betta watch yo back there boy 
 Get on yo square or 
 My gun'll beat your chain 
 Got the nigga figured out 
 Showin you off, tell him shit ain't the same 
 Go ahead and kick him out cut him up 
 Catch him sleepin' fuck him up 
 Only he must not know your name 
 Pimpin' is a deadly game 
 (Trina) 
 Oh nigga you mad now, actin' bad, pullin out your gats now 
 All you care about is cash, so my feelings they assed out 
 And it's so sad how I do for you 
 Be the woman come through for you 
 When you do wrong, police come through for you 
 I'll even bend the truth for you 
 But the fact of the matter is 
 Nigga you gon' love who you gon' love 
 You gon' trust who you gon' trust 
 You gon' fuck who you gon' fuck 
 But you won't trust me, no way no how 
 Ya gotta give ya whole life fo a nigga nowadays 
 Can't leave your house, can't even speak your mouth 
 Can't even beat him down 
 Motherfuckers is so crazy, deranged 
 Let 'em into your brain brings misery and pain 
 'Cause they call us lame, bitches, and heffers, and sluts 
 You think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts 
 Bitches y'all better get tough 
 And at the same time y'all better lock the game 
 And re-rock the game 
 Get a glock ready, sit back cock and aim 
 And try to stop the pain, cause you got a lot to gain 
 Instead of sittin' home waitin on niggas to call 
 Puttin' 911 in their beepers and all 
 We don't deserve this at all y'all 
 (Trina) 
 Nigga how you tame a bitch 
 Talkin' bout your game legit when you ain't the shit? 
 Then get wit a chick don't maintain a bitch you restrain a bitch 
 Insecure niggas they blame a bitch then reign a bitch 
 Get a ring try to rename a bitch get an attitude 
 Play games with the dick and try to tame a bitch 
 Y'all niggas better critically acclaim a bitch 
 You call we come take it like a champ drink all your cum 
 Do a lot of shit I've never done so I keep my cool 
 'Cause I ain't the one to start actin' up 
 'Cause he keep a bitch from backin up 
 I wanna pack my stuff but mama said I can't come back to her 
 Oh lord so I had keep askin ya 
 For help outta situations killin' up my whole life 
 I'm in love with a thug and he ain't treatin my soul right 
 And I know I don't see him uh don't need him 
 Shit fuck him and feed him 
 Fish stuck him and leave him quick shit... 
 (Trina) 
 If you're a nigga with no love and don't want no bitch 
 Don't see no bitch don't need no bitch 
 Then don't tease no bitch shit 
 'Cause we don't need to be 
 Fucked up mentally like a dumb ho 
 Breakin out all your windows 
 Tell the po-po's bout your dope holes, oh no 
 I can get my own shit my own nigga my own dick 
 I don't need a nigga thinkin' that he own a bitch 
 'Cause he bought me shit 
 7 whole days ain't call a bitch shit 
 Nigga shoulda stayed right where he was at 
 'Cause the nigga lied right where he was at 
 The nigga shoulda died right where he was at 
 Better watch yo back
