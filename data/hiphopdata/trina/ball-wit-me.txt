 Spittin' game to a stallion 
 Sippin' on half a gallon 
 Ice medallion, iceburg Italian 
 Handlin' knots in the gamblin' spots 
 Gettin' loose with a twenty pack handlin' blocks 
 Hit a nigga in the head with the stainless steel 
 Slaning packs while the Po-po's changin' shifts 
 Caked up at the bar, nigga let all them hoes 
 It's the adominal snowman, everything frozen 
 Gettin' off glass with the Crissy crunk 
 Got three, four dike bitches pissy drunk 
 Got them hoes kissin' cunts and twistin' blunts 
 When them hoes get ghost I don't miss them stunts 
 'Cause I pick up sluts in pickup trucks 
 Put dick down your throat bitch, hiccup nuts 
 Bitch what? I'mma give you some play 
 Out the exotic player clique and that 2-4-K

 In the Rolls Bentley sittin' on twenties 
 Hot girl, accent those 
 Dressed with stones, nigga caress my toes 
 Hoes wanna test my flows

 But yes froze me, rocks in my rosary 
 Sippin' Don P, the bar on me 
 All my girls drink Cris, think this

 So go on 'bout your business 
 Lick nuts, drink dicks

 While y'all niggas spittin' the glock

 Triplin' knots to see the villas and yachts 
 Call all the killas ya got 
 Bitches I'll clock a kill if I drop 
 Drink for my cot, cop me a Linc and a drop 
 Makin' a rock, and same day drill up your block 
 But on the flip side, why ya hate me? 
 'Cause I'm gettin' head in England 
 No wedding ring band 
 Out the XL I creep in the four dot six van 
 Leave you in the dirt like it's quicksand 
 You mad cause you never brawl like you a six man 
 What is you foolish? 
 Hit you with the metal leave you clueless 
 Now you on the dash like Stacey 
 All actin' crazy, cause your main bitch wanna masturbate me 
 Do me R. Kelly, drink half my babies 
 Go ahead bitch, indulge, taste it, still hate me
