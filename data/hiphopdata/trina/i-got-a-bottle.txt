(Feat. Missy Elliott) 
 Southern smoke! 
 Moe miney meenie inny [x3] 
 I got a bottle, I got a cup 
 I got ice, so what's up 
 Walk in the club when suicide close 
 Feelin' like money 'cause I collect dough 
 Moe miney meenie inny 
 Where's that patrone and hinney 
 I been sippin on cabonney that shits so strong 
 Like paris hilton, gotta carry me home 
 So full, so far gone 
 Forgot where I parked, n lost my iPhone 
 Still lookin' good and pretty bad bitch in every city 
 Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty 
 Ice for the cup, now pour the hinney 
 Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team 
 Ain't no guest, buts it's a rockstar theme 
 Everybody lookin' of course it's the queen 
 They admirin the crown, and the 10 carat ring 
 I'm known for pimpin' these rappers 
 Exspecially to get a nice walk on my actin' 
 When they actually think that I'm feelin' em 
 That's wen I take they money, then I'm killin' em 
 I got a bottle, I got a cup 
 I got ice, so what's up 
 Walk in the club when suicide close 
 Feelin' like money 'cause I collect dough 
 Moe miney meenie inny 
 Where's that patrone and hinney 
 Watch me get ghost in the phantom 
 Somethin' like a pimp like david banner 
 PIMP 
 I crooked letta crooked letta I crooked letta 
 Crooked letta I humpback humpback 
 I, am so off the chain 
 Spyin bottles ain a thing 
 Plus I'm gonna make it rain 
 So much money think she's insane 
 You a 7 digit nigga if you holla at a brah 
 With a 7 digit figga you should come in by da bah 
 I'm talkin' bout bottles, cabolley 
 I'm wet and hott like lava 
 I'm switchin 4 lanes in range 
 Hangin' at da coupe talkin' money ain a thing 
 Comin' all out my shirt on champain 
 Damn lil miss trina off da chain 
 I got a bottle, I got a cup 
 I got ice, so what's up 
 Walk in the club when suicide close 
 Feelin' like money 'cause I collect dough 
 Moe miney meenie inny 
 Where's that patrone and hinney 
 I don't swerve I spin 
 Grab a pearl grand ten 
 I'm so stinky stinky rich, 
 My damn dogg drive a benz 
 Tied up blue diamond shoes 
 Shinin suits, liverachi boo 
 Stuntin on you, like boo who you 
 I'm a icon ya bitch I though you knew 
 I only drop bombs, hatas b like uh-uh 
 Girl who she think she is 
 I'm is wut you want is 
 Girl I don't want yo man but I'll yo man 
 Yo man and his friend they both my fans 
 U don't understand miss deameanor ain playin' 
 Wen we go out to eat I got yo man payin'
