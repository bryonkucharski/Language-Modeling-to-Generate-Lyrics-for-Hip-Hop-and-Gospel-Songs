I'm in that new school, G5 wagon 
 Color, Komodo Dragon 
 My bitch look like she Jasmine 
 My nigga look like Aladdin 
 NKOTB, bitch 
 All these bitches is has-beens 
 I CPR'd the game 
 And now all these bitches is gasping 
 I be on that other 
 Nigga, don't get me aggy 
 I'm Mrs. Fatality 
 Endings do not be happy 
 These loser-ass bitches know I never gotta stunt 
 Talk behind my back 
 'Cause they never in the front 
 Bitch bow down 
 Better give me what I want 
 Feed me berries out in Paris 
 While I'm counting my croissant 
 These bitches is awful 
 And me I spit that Gospel 
 That lyrical, biblical, Holy Ghost, Pentecostal 
 And bitch don't run up on me 
 I give the fade to who want me 
 And you don't want that shade 
 You better off where it's sunny 
 And I don't need no friends bitch 
 I'm better off with my money 
 Just alert the fucking masses 
 Let 'em know that it's coming, like 
 (I was wearing it first) 
 I'm on that "Fuck what you say 
 It's my way" 
 Fashion Week, I'm out here slaying 
 Dressed in, like, all the latest 
 Bitch, you know my money long 
 Everybody sing this song 
 (I'm not even concerned) 
 I'm on that "Fuck what you say 
 It's my way" 
 Fashion Week, I'm out here slaying 
 Dressed in, like, all the latest 
 Killing these motherfuckers 
 And shitting on all these haters 
 I'm in that new school, G5 wagon 
 Color, Komodo Dragon 
 Riding beside a baddie that only cares about fashion 
 I'm in that new school, R8 Spyder 
 I'm now known as messiah 
 Riding beside a baddie that only wants to get higher 
 I'm that brand new Murciélago 
 On my way out to Cabo 
 Riding beside a baddie that's never once left Toronto 
 (I was wearing it first) 
 I'm on that "Fuck what you say 
 It's my way" 
 Fashion Week, I'm out here slaying 
 Dressed in, like, all the latest 
 Bitch, you know my money long 
 Everybody sing this song 
 Yo, I like to brag alone 
 Fuck dudes in rag and bone 
 Obsess over chicks who look like Mary-Kate and Ashley clones 
 Helmut Lang and Philiph Lim 
 Trashy bitch in classy clothes 
 Pop that shit then pop them pills 
 Till I feel like a fancy drone 
 Never catch me at the club 
 I get high and dance alone 
 Bitch I'm on that boss shit 
 On that upper echelon 
 Y'all niggas know what kind of X I'm on 
 Y'all bitches scared get your sweatshop on 
 And I'm running everything with a motherfuckin' sprain 
 Watching the rest of y'all get your rest stops on 
 (I was wearing it first) 
 I'm on that "Fuck what you say 
 It's my way" 
 Fashion Week, I'm out here slaying 
 Dressed in, like, all the latest 
 Bitch, you know my money long 
 Everybody sing this song 
 Everybody sing this song 
 Everybody sing this song 
 Everybody sing this song
