I'm running, running through the jungle 
 Running like a slave through the underground tunnel 
 Told y'all niggas that I'd get these bitches 
 'Cause I spit till my lips need 16 stitches 
 I am lyrical intrusion 
 You bitches can't see me like I'm really an illusion 
 I hop up on your face and do my motherfucking two-step 
 Till I knock the meat out like a motherfucking toothpick 
 Uh, I'm nasty nigga, like Nas, like Kim, like Cassie pictures 
 Like I'm fucking Chris Stokes or that Raz-B nigga 
 Or the skin on the feet of a ashy nigga 
 I am whatever they say I am 
 Bumping like the asses on them thick bitches at Stadium 
 Fuck them other bitches I sound better in the place of them 
 I killed this shit, this the motherfucking requiem 
 Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face 
 Calls from overseas like a motherfucking crusade 
 Crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurt 
 Rooftop Brooklyn, made this shit in Covert 
 I run New York, I run New York 
 I am zero past a hundred, spitting like a dragon 
 That went missing from a dungeon 
 Y'all a bunch of niggas getting trippy off of nothing 
 Tie a rope around your neck and let me kick you off a bungee 
 I'm Satan, and I'm a take your ass to church now 
 Running my fields and you midgets on your first down 
 I love it when these bitches know I'm better than them 
 'Cause I don't hear, not a word or a letter from them 
 I'm a fire in the midst of a forest 'round bitches 
 And I rap elliptical orbits round bitches 
 Anaconda, I sit with an open mouth, bitches 
 And you bitches are lyrically 
 Like some fucking down syndrome, no offence 
 No shade 'n' all, but y'all bitches on knees like babies crawl 
 You can catch me out in Covert, chilling like a stoop kid 
 Yeah I hear you, don't talk bitch, do 
 Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face 
 Calls from overseas like a motherfucking crusade 
 Crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurt 
 Rooftop Brooklyn, made this shit in Covert 
 I run New York, I run New York 
 I run New York, I run New York 
 I'm lyrical and I'm general 
 Take shots, but never subliminal 
 Don't stop, continue on running around 
 But never in intervals, can't stomach the shit that I'm fin'na do 
 Y'all niggas want the shit that I'm giving you 
 If you front, I'm gonn put and end to you 
 I'm like Scorpion, bitch I will finish you 
 Make it nasty, real, real nasty 
 Why you bitches running like you will get past me? 
 Won't happen, you bitches could get on, when I'm off it 
 Try to cross me now, you be going in a coffin 
 It's just me, myself and I 
 Talk tough shit and I'm a beat you till you die 
 Ask why? Because I'm better than you'll ever be 
 That's why my shit make your shit seem lighter than Heavy D 
 Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face 
 Calls from oversea like a motherfucking crusade 
 Crack rock and you hit it till your nose hurt 
 Rooftop Brooklyn, made this shit in Covert 
 I run New York, I run New York 
 I run New York, I run New York
