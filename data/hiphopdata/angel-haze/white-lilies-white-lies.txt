If you're cool with it, right, I need you to go back to remembering that you're a poet 
 Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage? 
 I know her, I know her by her name 
 Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage? 
 She's a queen, now watch her 
 She's drowning ace of spades 
 She dances, and she dances, and she drops it 
 The crowd is yelling pop it, there's a reason she can't stop it 
 She dances, and she dances, and she pops it 
 The crowd is yelling drop it, there's a reason she can't stop it 
 This a 
 Funeral, death of your innocence 
 Little Lily grown up, barely legitimate 
 All these niggas in here got you scared to be in amidst 
 So you just stand there, dance till you temperate 
 Dance till you in a wick 
 Dance till you in a wick 
 You don't feel the flame now, dance to rekindle it 
 Ran backstage did the bump in the bathroom 
 Kiss a few strangers and dance till you feeling it 
 And yours keep dropping to the floor 
 Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go 
 And just keep dancing on the stage 
 Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to her face 
 Then she got me backstage like 
 "Let me see your conscience 
 I'll be over dancing at the table of contents" 
 You can turn my pages 
 All these pages are like wages 
 And I would have quit so long 
 But all the money I'll be making got me 
 Dropping to the floor 
 Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go 
 She just keep dancing in my face 
 Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to the stage 
 She lets go, says she has it under control 
 I count slow, hoping that she'll divulge some more 
 'Cause she knows, everything a woman should know 
 And I want, nothing but to see it up close 
 And she keep saying "just grab it if you see what you like" 
 And I keep asking if this is what you want with your life 
 I find the flowers harden out in haunted houses 
 They somehow escape the gardens and walked out into the concrete and now 
 Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole 
 Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor 
 She climb up, up, up, up, hiding on the pole 
 She walk out with all her precious petals gone and now 
 We can find, roses with no petals in here 
 We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here 
 We can find, them dancing with the devil in here 
 Those white lines and, those white lies 
 Step off the stage and I'm back in a trance 
 With you we're interstellar, I'm gassing your nebula 
 All other flowers, they pale in comparison 
 That's why my florist's hand's slowly caressing you 
 One petals, two petals, back on the floor 
 Touch me, then tease me, then back on your cloak 
 Everything's seemingly Puerto Rico 
 This worthless from verses was stirring your soul 
 Swear I'm not putting you down, though 
 I just hate seeing you drown, slow 
 You say your mind frame is twisted and shit 
 That your faith in humanity's ground floor 
 I'm always one that say think on your own 
 Free is the flower who rose from my home 
 But I'd rather watch you be seated in power than steadily seeing you being dethroned 
 I found the flowers being drowned in dirty water 
 They somehow escape the farmers and are headed out to slaughter and now 
 Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole 
 Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor 
 She climb up, up, up, up, hiding on the pole 
 She walk out with all her precious petals gone and now 
 We can find, roses with no petals in here 
 We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here 
 We can find, them dancing with the devil in here 
 Those white lines and, those white lies
