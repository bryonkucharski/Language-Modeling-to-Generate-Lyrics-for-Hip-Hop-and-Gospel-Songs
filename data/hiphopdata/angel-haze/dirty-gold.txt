Take a breath, say you love me 
 We both know that everything changes 
 Keep in mind that none of this is fiction 
 This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace 
 We were two different children 
 But we born of the same moon 
 Blowing entire opposite 
 We were brought up the same too 
 I used to hate you because they celebrate you 
 And you made them notice every single thing I can't do 
 But really I honestly wanted to be you 
 And I just hope my desire to wasn't that see through 
 I never took into account the things that you were hiding 
 I even understood your rage when I see you get violent 
 I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded 
 Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is 
 You said to run and never look back 
 And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping 
 That lead me to my current goal 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 
 Took a chance, said you'd love me 
 We both know that everything changes 
 You found me when I was dying and unappreciated 
 You broke me down into a science that I completely hated 
 You told impeccable talent didn't make me less average 
 But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion 
 It took some time to understand and manage 
 But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness 
 And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned 
 But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand 
 It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated 
 All the ashes burned to ashes 
 And I'm dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you 
 And even though you ain't my fan, you did the shit they ain't do 
 So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you 
 Because despite all my ignorance I'm really fucking grateful 
 Never forget the importance of the sparks you hold 
 Don't sell your soul nigga you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul nigga you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul nigga you are dirty gold 
 Took a glance, to some error 
 Now I know that everything changes 
 I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful 
 Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels 
 There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle 
 That provided understanding of how much drama could change you 
 I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living 
 But when living is just dying then there's no longer a difference 
 There's no longer existence, and there's no longer persistence 
 And there's no longer a drive there existing on only division 
 And I thought, if nobody ever loved me 
 This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream 
 Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me 
 Probably never know your stories, but you're the reason I'm fighting 
 You're the reason I'm writing; music 
 Could be so reviving 
 And if ever you tend to forget, I'm right here to remind you: 
 Don't ever give into the hurt you hold 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 
 Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
