We're never done, we found a place where we belong 
 Don't have to stand alone, we'll never let you fall 
 Don't need permission to decide what you believe 
 And jump, down on Jump Street 
 Jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Work hard, play hard 
 You may not wanna quit your day job 
 Undercover, on the loose 
 Don't let 'em recognize your face card 
 This king shit, the team equipped 
 We 'bout to empty out like three clips 
 Got a mean grip on this street tip 
 Tearin' up the club like 3-6 
 We out of control, all over the place 
 And somebody gotta put it to a stop, quick 
 Out on the road and all up in your face 
 You better know we steady lookin' for the drop, bitch 
 Yeah they'll crack the case and yeah they gotta crack it fast 
 They're the Jump Street and 'bout to jump up in your ass 
 This the special unit that's designed to keep it quiet 
 We infiltrate the dealers and we find the damn suppliers 
 Your friends'll be there when your back is to the wall 
 You'll find you need us cause there's no one else to call 
 When it was hopeless, the decision is what you need 
 You better be ready to, be ready to jump 
 Jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Say jump, down on Jump Street 
 Don't be afraid to die 
 A lot of bad guys should be afraid to die 
 Got Schmidt, Jenko, the whole damn crew 
 Same ole same ole with a whole lot of new 
 You know there can't be love without an? 
 It all goes hand in hand like yin and yang 
 In the city but I'm mothafuckin' sky high 
 Tryna find a new drug called wi-fi 
 Wait, we just here tryna find us 
 Schmidt went lookin', till he found love 
 Got his life sweet, bon appetit 
 Spring break, bitch, throw a party on the beach 
 Shit did change, but all that means 
 Is that your real friends don't ever leave 
 Will it ever be complete? 
 Jump Street won't ever cease
