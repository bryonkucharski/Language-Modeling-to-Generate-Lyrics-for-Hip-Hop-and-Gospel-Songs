Rage colored lilies 
 Brave covered in pity 
 Lights smother this city 
 I pray He doesn't forget me 
 I pray He doesn't forget me that lonely night in November 
 When we fell into the hands of the coldest day in December 
 Then became the product of the trust that we had lost and found 
 Got you deep in the emotion just to watch you drown 
 And I had never left the land's sand 
 'Cause I was busy building castles for a dead man 
 Shouldn't have taken my eyes of you 
 I shouldn't have straddled the lines crossed too 
 And now I've been searching but can't find you 
 Hence me being lost since you're the one I'm entwined to 
 So, is love the picture that we've tainted now? 
 No, am I still with you when I ain't around? 
 Am I the subject you tip-toe or walk around? 
 And if this love is on the ledge I'm trying to talk it down 
 (Bring me your love) 
 We were deap sea divers 
 (Bring me your love) 
 On another man's planet 
 (I need your love) 
 And I fell for you hard babe 
 (Bring me your love) 
 But I never quite landed 
 (Bring me your love) 
 Now I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (I need your love) 
 And I scream for your name and I call for you babe but I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 Still can't forget you 
 (I need your love) 
 And I scream for your name and I call for you babe but I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (I need your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 So, instead of sailing I live like a human parachute 
 The more I'm falling the further I am compared to you 
 It's like I'm stuck in the air, while you're pale and blue 
 Chasing clouds and hoping they lead a trail to you 
 See, we were deep sea divers 
 And I was focused on survival 
 And death does you part when you're focused on its rival 
 Defibrillator love, I'm just focused on revival 
 You could, you could put your hands in mine 
 And we'll walk through the sands in the sand of time 
 Until we paint the end of this love scene 
 Until I'm laid to rest in your blood stream 
 Until I hear the strings of your heart playing 
 Until I hear the things you are not saying 
 Until I find out what it really means 
 And hopefully it's everything it really seems 
 (Bring me your love) 
 We were deap sea divers 
 (Bring me your love)

 Now I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you

 And I scream for your name and I call for you babe but I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 Still can't forget you 
 (I need your love) 
 And I scream for your name and I call for you babe but I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (I need your love) 
 And I can't be with you 
 (Bring me your love) 
 And I scream for your name and I call for you babe but I can't be with you 
 Breaking me open again 
 Oh darling, chasing what's gone with the wind 
 Oh no, I can't be with you 
 Oh no no, I can't be with you 
 I can't be with you 
 Oh no no, I can't be with you
