And the light, the light can make everything feel beautiful 
 It can make it feel safe, so safe that like in the night 
 We spend all of our time running away from our truths 
 And then we meet someone who tells us, "God will always love you 
 No matter what you do, the only thing that will never stop loving you is God." 
 And because of all of our darkness, which at night I still run from 
 Which at night all still run from, we get stuck chasing light 
 That's a black synagogue 
 And God said, that the maker shall inhabit the Earth 
 But there shall be masses, I said masses, of bloodshed first 
 And that will open the floodgates of Heaven, and pour down upon us His blessings 
 From the floor, to the ceiling, but only if you praise Him, I said praise Him 
 Shall you receive His healing 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 I been running from the pain in my brain 
 Got stains on my scene while I search for the real me 
 Search for the real me, lost in the night 
 I only talk to angels when I'm lost in a height 
 I don't really wanna get lost in my mind 
 So I pray until I feel I'm getting lost in the vibe 
 Then I took the bottle up and I drink it to my what? 
 Yep, drink it to my fucking souls lost in my eyes 
 But I don't really wanna drown no, 'cause I'm not that trusting 
 But I'mma keep coming 'round though, till I'm sure that I found something 
 And when I tell you what it is, you better talk to God, remember 
 No feelings, no thoughts allowed 
 And if pain's a trapdoor then I need God 
 So send someone to come walk me out 
 But don't think, don't talk about it 
 Wait, don't sing, don't tell nobody 
 Wait, don't drink, don't fail your body 
 Wait, don't scream, no, fucking shout it 
 See, these voices in my head are the fucking loudest 
 So belligerent, so fucking rowdy 
 And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded 
 And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet 
 So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me 
 But you know him well, and I think that you could bring him near me 
 So I keep praying, every word that I keep saying 
 Every part of me that I needed shield from 
 Every part of me that needs saving 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 None of this's real, when it calls to 
 Thought I found you, now I'm lost too 
 I've been listening to service sermons 
 A lotta redefining, a lot of words reworded 
 A lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested 
 A lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons 
 I've been searching for the truth but it's embedded in lies 
 Read every single verse until I'm red in my eyes 
 And God only hear you when you offering ties 
 And protection is the truth 
 But when the Devil's a lie 
 But what am I to do when the Devil is I? 
 And everything I touch seems to shrivel and die? 
 My mama always said I was a rebel inside 
 But now I'm looking for some peace and a benevolent I 
 And how it feels to need that, some humbling pie 
 And how long it will take when it comes from the sky 
 Means I'll probably be waiting until I crumble and die 
 And just wrestling with Satan while I'm struggling by 
 So, I think, I talk about it 
 Wait, I drink, I tell somebody 
 Wait, I sink, I fail my body 
 Wait, I scream, I'm fucking shouting 
 'Cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest 
 So belligerent, so fucking rowdy 
 And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded 
 And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet 
 So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me 
 And you know him well, and I think that you could bring him near me 
 So I keep praying, everything that I keep saying 
 Every part of me that I needed shield from 
 Every part of me that needs saving 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 Save me from the pain 
 I'm falling down 
 Don't you hear me calling? 
 I need you now 
 Fill me till I'm full with your holy light 
 Give me sanction 
 Can you bring me back to life? 
 Did he die on the cross for this? 
 Do you have any fucking proof? 
 Everything here is man-made 
 And I'm just searching for some fucking truth 
 'Cause everything they told me not to do 
 Has always made me question what freedom is 
 Why listen to the words when they not from you? 
 And why feel judged when I freely live? 
 Now I know what the fucking root of evil is 
 And why peace is dead, but evil lives 
 Everybody thinking they can talk to you 
 And what they believe in they hearts are true 
 Now they feel that they had the right to persecute 
 Now I don't really know who wrote the Bible 
 But nothing under the sun goes unrecycled 
 Take every shot you have with a fucking rifle 
 'Cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival 
 So, just think, just talk about it 
 Wait, just think, just tell somebody 
 Wait, don't blink, don't fail your body 
 Wait, just scream, just fucking shout it 
 So the voices in your head fall abruptly silent 
 And the blood in your veins flows rough and violent 
 And you see everything with your lifted eyelids 
 And every burden you carry is eventually lighted 
 And you talk to God, even when you ain't sure he hears you 
 When you give it to Him, tell Him, He can keep the pain and fears too 
 And you keep praying, only now you don't repeat saying 
 'Cause you know when you let it go, then you receive saving 
 How many people here look for Jesus to solve their problems? 
 Lots of people 
 And how many of those people are fixed? 
 None of them know fucking about shit 
 They're all fucking fucked up 
 Anything to help you escape 
 It takes it, it takes something to just say 
 "Fuck it! This is reality, I'm gonna deal with it" 
 But do we ever really deal with it? 
 Deal with it, stop running, stop trying to find these substitutes 
 Stop trying to find Jesus in strangers, and Jesus in church and God 
 And find God in yourself 
 Powerful thing, yeah?
