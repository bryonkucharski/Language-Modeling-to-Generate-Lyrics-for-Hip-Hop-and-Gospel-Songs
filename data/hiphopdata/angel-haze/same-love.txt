Hi mom, I'm really scared right now, but I have to 
 At age thirteen, my mom knew I wasn't straight 
 She didn't understand, but she had so much to say 
 She sat me on the couch, looked me straight in my face 
 And said you'll burn in hell or probably die of AIDS 
 It's funny now, but at thirteen it was pain 
 To be almost sure of who you are and have it ripped away 
 And I'm sorry if it's too real for some of you to fathom 
 But hate for who you love is not exactly what you'd imagine 
 And I guess it was disastrous 
 Because everything that happened afterwards was just madness 
 Locked away for two years to keep me on the inside 
 Because she'd rather see a part of me die tha me thrive 
 And it's tougher when it's something you can't deny 
 And ignorance teaches us it's something you decide 
 You're driven by your choices, an optical illusion 
 Here's to understanding it's not always confusion 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 My love, my love, my love 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 I've walked the halls of my school 
 And I've seen kids hide behind walls and footballs and things like pride 
 I've seen innocent children suffer beneath bruises 
 Suffer beneath every single hand that chooses ignorance 
 Fuck your religion, fuck constitution, fuck superstitions 
 There are no lakes of fire, they're here on earth 
 And the only thing to do is put love first 
 And so I stand for the boy who died by hid hand 
 To the sound of his father screaming 'woman loves man' 
 This is Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve 
 And I stand for the girl with the cuts up her sleeve 
 And the heart in her hand and a chip on her shoulder 
 And I stand for it all until ignorance is over 
 This is for you, for knowing who you are 
 For never letting your magic outside of your heart 
 Be you, be brave, and understand that things do change 
 I accept you for you when I don't understand 
 And I love you for you because this is who I am 
 I accepted you for you when I didn't understand 
 Now love me for me 'cause this is who I am. 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 My love, my love, my love 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 Here's a message to the people who just don't get it 
 Love is love 
 There is no difference 
 Not a medication to fix it 
 There is no prescription 
 No rehab to visit 
 It is not an addiction it's love and it's selfless 
 It's yours and everybody else's so don't badger and abuse the solemnly defenseless 
 See us as yourself 
 There's no equality in difference 
 Until we all get it, we'll be drowning in the same blood 
 Despite orientation, we all feel the same love 
 We'll be drowning in the same blood 
 Despite orientation, we all feel the same love 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 And I can't change 
 Even if I tried, even if I wanted to 
 My love, my love, my love 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 She keeps me warm 
 We are boxed in and labeled 
 Before we're ever able to speak who we believe we are 
 Or who we dream we'll become 
 Like drum beats forever changing their rhythm 
 I am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday 
 And tonight I'll only borrow pieces of who I am today 
 To carry with me to tomorrow 
 No, I'm not gay 
 No, I'm not straight 
 And I sure as hell am not bisexual 
 Damn it I am whoever I am when I am it 
 Loving whoever you are when the stars shine 
 And whoever you'll be when the sun rises 
 So here's to being able 
 Here's too love 
 Here's to loving just because 
 Here's to acceptance 
 Here's to never fearing the fear of rejection 
 Here's to love and never neglecting who you feel you are 
 Here's to bullies because beatings cannot last forever 
 Here's to the moment you realize things do get better 
 Here's to the parents who will get it when it's too late 
 Here's to second chances 
 Here's to new fate 
 Here's to every single moment you've ever had to hide you 
 Here's to the single star shining bright inside you, asking you to guide you 
 Here's to who you'll be when you figure it all out 
 Here's to momentary doubt 
 Here's to feeling, because we all fell it the same 
 Here's to the moment that things will change 
 Because we all feel love, we all feel it the same 
 Here's to love, here's to change.
