No more living in dust 
 When my memories die 
 All my trials are rulin' in lullabies 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 I spent too much time in recording 
 Spent too much designin' the current 
 Meet me at the bottom where it started 
 Promise I revised and rethought it 
 And I got that, got that, got shit started 
 Everything's hard and I know it 
 I got all the scars, I can show it 
 Never been exempt, but the funny thing is, never really had friends 
 Just a bunch of down bitches only down for the moment 
 All of this shit don't end 
 I lost so much just to win 
 And that how it goes? Lord knows, I got holes in my soul 
 But I would do it all again 
 So what are people mad at me for? 
 Is it 'cause they can't jock my free flow? 
 Is it 'cause they know no matter how hard they go 
 They ain't ever gonna stop my dreams though? 
 No more living in dust 
 When my memories die 
 All my trials are rulin' in lullabies 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 Somethin' to sing about 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 I've been straddlin' the line, all my life, just to get me by 
 But I dreamt of the top, of the sky, dreams of gettin' high 
 Now everything I say, they gon' feel it 
 Every words I lay, they gon' hear it 
 Every single word, they gon' get it 
 (Let me make sure they remember me) 
 I tried, it was hard, but I did it 
 Couple more scars, but I'm livin' 
 Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it 
 (Let me make sure they remember me) 
 All just survival of the fittest 
 All just to rhyme for the critics 
 Everything I want, Imma get it 
 (Let me make sure they remember me) 
 I tried, it was hard, but I did it 
 Couple more scars, but I'm livin' 
 Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it 
 (Let me make sure they remember me) 
 No more living in dust 
 When my memories die 
 All my trials are rulin' in lullabies 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 Somethin' to sing about 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 Name across the sky 
 And put the world upside down 
 And when I'm done with the world, I'm takin' the galaxy 
 They gonna sing about me 
 They gonna sing about me 
 They gonna sing about me 
 No more living in dust 
 When my memories die 
 All my trials are rulin' in lullabies 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me 
 Somethin' to sing about 
 Put my heart on the line 
 Put my life in the song 
 Now you, now you, you can sing about me
