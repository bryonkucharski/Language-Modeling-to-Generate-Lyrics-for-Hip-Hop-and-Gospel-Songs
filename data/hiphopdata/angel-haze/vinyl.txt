Your skin sounds like my favorite vinyl 
 You got broken records trapped inside you 
 You know I searched this galaxy to find you 
 We're in love, we're at war 
 Play my song, turn it up, turn it up 
 Yo 
 You remind me of a song that I can't seem to skip 
 Your skin's the record and the needle is my fingertips 
 Recollection, I touch you and I get a glimpse 
 Of all the same old songs and repeated skits 
 Look, I know that love is always bound to change 
 But I promise that my records never sound the same 
 And I show you how it changes when you sculpt it 
 Show you music, but like way more culture 
 There's a world and I can't wait to expose you 
 I play you out until everybody knows you 
 Till you up, fix the flaws like Melodyne 
 But you're forever, now you're music that'll never die 
 Yo, it's timeless 
 I hear inflections of forever in your high pitch 
 Put my face to your chest, hear the bass in your breath 
 And baby my whole mind shifts 
 Your skin sounds like my favorite vinyl 
 You got broken records trapped inside you 
 You know I searched this galaxy to find you 
 We're in love, we're at war 
 Play my song, turn it up, turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 Turn it up 
 You are the songs that I write to my wrongs 
 The calm inside of the rioting storm 
 Stand here, in the center of divinity 
 While I rehearse the role of forever, infinity 
 Action - I begin to relish in the moment 
 Discarding my reality, imagining components 
 Fracturing mentalities, I'm casualty spoken 
 If warning comes before destruction, you're the omen 
 Yo, and I'm just judging by the sight of you 
 I climb your mental mountains till I reach the very height of you 
 Visually perceptive, in you I see the most 
 I wrote this when I'm spacing, I'm tryna keep us close 
 This my deeper part, this my weaker part 
 Emotions on blast, turned up my speaker hard 
 I can find you, you everything right here now 
 Turned around, rewound, I can hear you clear now 
 There are so many words, but none explain my love 
 No no no no no no no no 
 Where the love is lost, but so much to gain my love 
 We are houses built on top of pain, my love 
 My love, my love 
 We are gardens filled with sounds of grey, my love 
 And now [?] you're someplace, the words say... 
 Your skin sounds like my favorite vinyl 
 You got broken records trapped inside you 
 You know I searched this galaxy to find you 
 We're in love, we're at war 
 Play my song, turn it up, turn it up
