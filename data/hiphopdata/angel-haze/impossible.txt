There is no part of me left in my brain 
 I am outside it, man I can't complain 
 I have seen so much you cannot contain 
 Or even create or even explain 
 Fuckboy I'm wild as a buck in the rain 
 Wild as a fox who be runnin' with rabies 
 Wild as that pedo that's scopin' your block out for months 
 'Cause he's plannin' to eat all your babies 
 Sorry I'm crazy, but I open my third eye 
 And the view is amazing 
 I mean poppin' them bars can turn blues into greys 
 And I say what I mean and I do what I say 
 Do you know all the things I could do in a day? 
 I'm prohibited, nigga, I usually stay 
 With bitches whose daddies keep two in the safe 
 Cry for the kid till they're blue in the face 
 Hop on the jet then I flew out the states 
 Laid on a beach with a view of my face 
 Considered suicide, I do that these days 
 I thought about what I could do with my grave 
 Google search how to make a grenade 
 Toggle my aim, scribble some names 
 Took a few breaths, blew out some steam 
 And I sent that shit out and I blew up the game 
 I am a little bit out of my brain 
 Man this shit's a problem, man this shit's a problem, man 
 I just threw, did you not understand? 
 That this shit's a problem, man this shit's a problem, man 
 I just rose from my ashes again 
 Defeat all my obstacles, 'feat all my obstacles 
 There is nothin' that can't hold me down 
 This shit is impossible, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man 
 I am a sickness, man: I am a cancer 
 See, I know the devil, man: I am his handler 
 You should not try it, man I have your soul 
 I really show you the realm of disaster 
 I am a junkie for fuckin' semantics 
 I smoke all the flowers, I fill out the pasture 
 I got my middle finger up to white America 
 But tryin' to whitewash my blackness 
 Fuck you, you could never break me 
 What you mean, my nigga? 
 Thought I told you I'm not human 
 I'm machine, my nigga 
 Go brrratata, boom, bop, bop, bang, bang, bang, my nigga 
 Think these honkies here don't got us on no genes, my nigga 
 When it all falls down, I'm a free soul 
 Now can't nobody take that from me 
 Not a price in the world, not a diamond or pearl 
 Ain't a lot that could take that for free 
 I am wild in the jungle with Tarzan and George 
 Chillin' high in the trees with a bundle of whores 
 And I only come back home for fun when I'm bored 
 Bitch, I'm made from the flowers, I just rose from the thorns 
 I am a little bit out of my brain 
 Man this shit's a problem, man this shit's a problem, man 
 I just threw, do you not understand? 
 That this shit's a problem, man this shit's a problem, man 
 I just go through my options again 
 Defeat all my obstacles, 'feat all my obstacles 
 There is nothin' that can't hold me down 
 This shit is impossible, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man 
 It's impossible, man 
 Shit, shit, shit is impossible, man
