Back in the booth let the tragedy in 
 Switched up the team, let the magic begin 
 Told all you haters, I'm in it to win 
 Way back when them losers wasn't letting me in 
 All of these bitches is mad at me, so? 
 Money appeared now they magically foe 
 Honestly really can't pay it no mind 
 Because spending that time means I'd rather be broke 
 I'm out here living my passions and more 
 Witnessing peace as it pass through my soul 
 Nothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth 
 Haters gonna hate when you winning and shit 
 Done for these bitches, they tend to forget 
 I'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!' 
 I was underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds 
 14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain 
 High in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain 
 Just a year later still fucking these haters 
 While facing my fears, no more running from pain 
 Head is on straight so I'm gunning with aim 
 No more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame 
 You can catch me out roofless in something deranged 
 Ain't it funny how suddenly something can change? 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 Back when the preacher said change is to come 
 All nonbelievers prepare to be sonned 
 Not talking Jesus but honest to God 
 I bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs 
 Switched it up bitches, adjusted my flow 
 Go against me and get wrecked from the go 
 All of you bitches keep taking your shots 
 But if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat 
 Harder than nipples on bitches aroused 
 Deity swag and omnipotent style 
 Don't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head 
 'Cause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile 
 Promise you people that evil's alive 
 Wish you could see what I see with my eyes 
 All of the demons that be in mind 
 So I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties 
 Said I would do this back when I was 9 
 Said I would do this before I got signed 
 Said I would give all these lost kids and doubters 
 A reason and purpose to question their lives 
 Look where I am and then look where I've been 
 Tell me that I ain't destined to win 
 Never give power to none of you cowards 
 To tell me what you think my destiny is 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 Gone for a minute but back on my grind 
 Promise you you are no match for my mind 
 Took all my doubt, whipped it into submission 
 And forced my ambition to step into line 
 I know that they do not want me to shine 
 I know that they do not want me to climb 
 I know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs 
 Can anyone fuck with me now? No 
 How do these bitches respond? Don't 
 Looking behind to seeing me now 
 What do they think I'm beyond? Dope 
 I've just be taking my time, slow 
 Being alone in my mind, flow 
 Putting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for 
 Crossover, pivot, I'm back in the game 
 NASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane 
 Focused on bridging the gap 
 And showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams 
 Know how it feels when they kicking you down 
 And it's getting you down 
 You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumbing it down 
 I know it's hard to be adamant, too 
 When you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd 
 No niggas and bitches and quitters aloud 
 Ball inside you until the survival of your dreams 
 Until you are living them out 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around 
 Turn it around, turn it around 
 Even when you feel you dumming it down 
 You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life 
 And turn it around
