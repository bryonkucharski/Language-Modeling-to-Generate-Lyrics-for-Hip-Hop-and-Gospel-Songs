You're the shade of the saddest December 
 Rose colored petals that tragically wither 
 With my tongue on the thighs of a sinner 
 And I keep praying father forgive us 
 And I come back to you for redemption 
 Till I feel you rise up inside me like tension 
 All the thoughts on the mind you've imprisoned 
 Have faith in the god you envisage 
 And I praise and I stroke you to pieces 
 Till you cum in the dark and release me 
 And I beg at your feet when you leave me 
 Till my tonsils are sore from the screaming 
 Till my knees hit the pavement your feet hit 
 For the hem of your garment, I'm reaching 
 You're the only god I've ever believed in... 
 You're the only god I've ever believed in 
 Lost in you tonight 
 I could worship you for life 
 Keep me rising like the tide 
 The tide 
 I've got heaven on my mind 
 I've got God here in my sight 
 Could you stay and take me high? 
 Me high, high...
