You should write a song where the concept is... 
 You're basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice 
 To your mother, when she was your age 
 I don't know 
 Maybe I would write you a happy ending 
 I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning 
 I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you 
 And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you 
 Or maybe I'm naïve... 
 Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed 
 It would somehow grow inside you 
 Spent so much of my time wishing you were different 
 But reality is that, where life could never be provisioned 
 But if I could wish for one thing, I'd go back and I'd fix it 
 I'd tackle all your obstacles and kill them with precision 
 And better the intentions of every single person 
 Who play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is 
 I'd shower you with purpose, I'd wipe hate off the surface 
 I'd reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it 
 No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching 
 No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you 
 Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you 
 And if they ever tried too I'd wipe 'em from the Earth too 
 'Cause I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too 
 I know that you been running from everything that's behind you 
 I know that you've been burying everything deep inside you 
 I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you 
 But I'm stuck sitting in this time frame 
 Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game 
 One day it could get better, maybe it could get better 
 Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather 
 Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind 
 You were just like me, wish that you had more time 
 To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel 
 Wouldn't lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger 
 Everything is different now, nothing is the same 
 And nowadays I swear it feels like you don't know my name 
 But I look at the mirror and I see you every day 
 I'm you in every way, every hue and every shade 
 And maybe you should know, it's the last thing that I wanted 
 'Cause what I hate about you makes me feel like I'm haunted 
 And I don't wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and- 
 So I'm just gonna confront it, yeah I'm just gonna confront it 
 And tell you that I love you for everything you made me 
 And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry 
 God lives inside you, you've already found him 
 The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you 
 And I despise the church for everything that they taught you 
 It's just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you 
 That I wish I could wipe off you 
 And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you 
 Everything that it cost you 
 Fame is such a heavy price I wish it didn't cost you 
 Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell 
 Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail 
 Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of 
 Now I realize that I could never make it with that love 
 Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome 
 Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some 
 I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on 
 I just wish you knew that you could never make it without love 
 For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else 
 'Cause I would help you find you 
 And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you 
 And if that meant the end of me 
 I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy end and peace 
 Because, you are such a special thing 
 You're not just my mom, but you're the reason I exist 
 And the best life that you could've had for yourself without making a mistake 
 Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood 
 And even though my childhood wasn't perfect and I still love you 
 I just want you to know that if I could go back do one thing for you 
 I would be one person for you 
 I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could've had a nicer life 
 And a nicer childhood, that you know 
 You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation 
 And not have the stress to leave 
 But just so that you would have been happier and stronger 
 Even if I didn't exist, even it meant that I was never born 
 That's what I would have wanted for you 
 Yeah, and if that meant the end of me 
 I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending 
 'Cause I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too 
 I know you've been running from everything that's behind you 
 I know that you've been burying everything deep inside you 
 I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you 
 And if that meant the end of me 
 I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending 
 And if that meant the end of me 
 I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending 
 And if that meant the end of me 
 I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending 
 I don't know 
 Maybe I would write you a happy ending 
 I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning 
 I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you 
 And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you 
 Or maybe I'm naïve... 
 Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed 
 It would somehow grow inside you 
 And that I could hide you from the rain 
 So that it could be easier for happiness to find you 
 Or maybe I'm still a kid who's caught in a dream 
 I'm the heir to the throne of a princess who's still trying to be queen 
 Or maybe we're all just caught in the winds of a massacre 
 The blackened leaves of dying, black dahlias
