Don't think your love is the antidote 
 Don't try to fix me when you know you're just as broken 
 Don't tell me that I'll be okay 
 When every time you kiss me you can taste a little pain 
 We can dance with the stars while I fish from the moon 
 Using messages bottled to the pits of my womb 
 And I thought that in the mist of me then you found a cure for me 
 And magnetize your vibrance and finally had a pull on me 
 I pictured you running to everywhere you would need to go 
 I'm up in the air, still running from everything below 
 Yo, I'm not sure what this is but I've got jet fuel in my soul 
 Propellors tucked in my ribs 
 We'll fly 
 And a tunnel's got no lights 
 And the light exposes [?] 
 If it's all right 
 When the good feels bad but the bad feels better 
 Planes fly 
 High enough to take us anywhere 
 And we'll go 
 We'll hear no, we'll see no fear 
 And I know 
 Trouble will find wherever we are 
 Keep wishing easy baby 
 We'll be closer to the stars 
 Swallowed my secrets like a bitter pill 
 Repeat the same mistakes so wounds will never heal 
 You know the reason I can't look you in your eyes 
 But I want your guilty body like you love my dirty mind 
 We'll fly 
 And I would never see you wrong so try 
 And when everything is gone then I 
 Will be wherever you reside 
 With my eyes full of passion 
 Desire running behind it 
 I don't know what that means 
 But I'm sure we'll find out together 
 When the good feels bad and the tunnel feels like forever 
 And hearts slow sink like a birds's lost feather 
 The end all, be all, the pulling to a lever 
 Planes fly 
 High enough to take us anywhere 
 And we'll go 
 We'll hear no, we'll see no fear 
 And I know 
 Trouble will find wherever we are 
 Keep wishing easy baby 
 We'll be closer to the stars 
 Keep running baby till you find yourself tonight 
 Keep running baby here you can be what you like 
 Keep running baby till you find yourself tonight 
 Keep running baby: spread your wings and fly 
 Planes fly 
 Bewind the skies like faded faith 
 And I've tried to live my life at my own pace 
 But we lose so much time here on the ground 
 So it's now 
 Take your flight or burn it down 
 Planes fly 
 High enough to take us anywhere 
 And we'll go 
 We'll hear no, we'll see no fear 
 And I know 
 Trouble will find wherever we are 
 Keep wishing easy baby 
 We'll be closer to the stars 
 Keep running baby till you find yourself tonight 
 Keep running baby here you can be what you like 
 Keep running baby till you find yourself tonight 
 Keep running baby: spread your wings and fly
