If you're contemplating suicide, this is for you 
 See this is for the moments when ya alone and with emotion 
 So fucking bored leaves you mentally frozen 
 When ya cold and alone heart open and broken 
 When that loves outta sight and your hearts into focus 
 When ya floating in oceans hopeless soaking in misery 
 Headphones on you link yourself with the synergy 
 When you watch your mind and ya lost in a song, be strong 
 You are not alone, I just want you to know you are not alone 
 There's angels in the airwaves tonight 
 And I've been running all of my life 
 And I need you to stay, I need you to stay 
 Angels in the airwaves tonight 
 This for all the moments when your weakness is your cloak 
 And people you love most just beat you to a pulp 
 When you cut open your wrist looking for loving and slits 
 But find nothing but self hate cause nothing exists 
 See this for all the moments when they don't understand 
 And they ain't where you stand 
 And they can't comprehend 
 They just staring from the outside 
 And then they judging you're in, when they 
 Kick you and beat you and hurt you then leave you 
 Laying on the ground like you half and they equal 
 Gladly defeat you then laugh to your face 
 When you feel all alone, when ya so outta place 
 They can't relate to this pain 
 They don't feel how I feel 
 So don't get lost tonight 
 Never let the ignorance cost ya life 
 You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight 
 Put your headphones on and turn off the lights 
 There's angels in the airwaves tonight 
 And I've been running all of my life 
 And I need you to stay, I need you to stay 
 Angels in the airwaves tonight 
 When the girl that you love won't look in your direction 
 When the guy you like adds you to his fucking collection 
 When you all dressed in black 
 And they whisper and snicker 
 When they make you feel wrong for being so different 
 This for everybody who knows what it is 
 To feel like nothing but a memory that won't be relived 
 That this the fucking shit that everyone forgets 
 The words on the tip of tongues that gets swallowed with the spit 
 See I know how it feels 
 I've been there before 
 I had head in my hands and my heart on the floor 
 I've been worthless and shattered 
 I've been nothing to people 
 I know what it is to have to force them to see you 
 So don't get lost tonight 
 Never let the ignorance cost ya life 
 You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight 
 Put your headphones on and turn off the lights 
 I've been running now 
 I'm outta here today 
 I've been running now 
 Questioning my faith [x2] 
 There's angels in the... 
 So when you feel so invisible you're not even sure you exist 
 So you cut yourself open just to see if you real 
 You numb yourself with drugs just to hide what you feel 
 You drink the washed up pain in hopes of rejecting it afterwards 
 You live everyday wishing you could rewind your life backwards 
 Because you wanna figure out where the fuck you went wrong 
 Cause everything in your world ain't been right for so long 
 I know how it feels 
 So this is for you 
 If you're thinking it now 
 If you're wanting to die 
 If you're thinking it out 
 You are so much more than you are in this moment 
 You never know how great you can be 
 Don't give up on you 
 I didn't gave up on me
