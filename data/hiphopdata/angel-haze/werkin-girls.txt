Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack 
 I'm next to that cheese like rat traps 
 On top of that green like grass ass 
 That's over y'all head like snapbacks 
 I get it where I fit in, put up then I put in 
 Tryna find an ass I can put my fucking foot in 
 Run this shit no I run this shit 
 Don't give one fuck bitch I done this shit 
 I did what I say I did 
 Did not fabricate one bit 
 I have been the fucking realest since my exit near the clit 
 That's where I was born fuck what you on 
 All about me bitch fuck what you doin' 
 Round of applause bitches slap me with some clappin 
 Show my whole fucking ass like a fat bitch chaps 
 But I'll be running that shit like a motherfuckin' tracker 
 Like I run on sense like a motherfuckin' chopper 
 Like a cheetah in the jungle but I'm motherfucking faster 
 Like a pre-teen boy in the church with a pastor 
 Hold up I'm not serious I'm just playin-psych 
 Fuck your opinion bitch I mean it when I'm sayin' that 
 Money and more money is the only shit I'm after 
 You can cut the fake shit 
 I'm not a motherfuckin' actor 
 I'm on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor 
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper 
 I'll be on that other shit got that from my other bitch 
 She come from an island or a desert or some tundra shit 
 I am multi-faceted, bitch I do a ton of shit 
 Like I'm diarrhea or whatever's sitting under it 
 I'm nasty, I'm insane, I'm too much, I spit grains 
 I came from the fuckin' bottom 
 I'm top now, I shift lanes, 
 I kick shit, like dope shit 
 Like no shit, like oh shit 
 Get in my way I fuck up everything 
 Like ho shit 
 See, they said that I wouldn't 
 I do whatever they said I couldn't 
 I'm not the one to be fucked with 
 Or to be tough with 
 I be on your head like duck, duck, duck bitch 
 I be in the air like pump-pumped up fists 
 Nah, I'm like up-chuck like gut fish like hands up my skirt 
 Like when you gon' let me fuck bitch 
 Money and more money is the only shit I'm after 
 You can cut the fake shit 
 I'm not a motherfuckin' actor 
 I'm on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor 
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper 
 I'm an undefeated bastard 
 My tongue is the fucking rapture, bitch 
 I be at my peak, I am not the one to be mastered 
 I'm the one to be after, I'm sweeping you while I'm dusting 
 I just popped up out the blue, I'm spontaneously combusting 
 Spit a little different, give me just a minute 
 Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it 
 We are not the same but they don't really get it 
 Tell 'em do the math, hoe-fraction, division 
 Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic 
 Eat 'em till the end till they back at the beginning (???) 
 'Cause I ki-ki-ki-kill it till it's flat dead 
 And never pass a rock like a motherfucking crackhead 
 Money and more money is the only shit I'm after 
 You can cut the fake shit 
 I'm not a motherfuckin' actor 
 I'm on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor 
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper
