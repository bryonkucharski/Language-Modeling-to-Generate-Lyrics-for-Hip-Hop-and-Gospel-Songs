5-7-75 my born day 
 I reach earth, now I'm involved in foul play 
 Ty Nitty 
 New York City 
 We stay right 
 The high life 
 Flooded ice from jewel heist 
 The Infamous Mobb with hood-like sense 
 Get up on a nigga quick 
 Hit 'em up with the ice pick 
 Strike quick 
 Leave ya body froze, sub-zero 
 Was taught to fear no 
 So I do so 
 Be All Pro 
 Flow international, rational 
 Matter of fact, I'm blastin' you 
 With the loaded weapon 
 No question 
 First suggestion 
 Pack ya shit, and head Western 
 Relocation 
 New state, new destination 
 Re-arrange your life 
 On the run from vice 
 Make you pray to Christ 
 Kid fucked up 
 My Mobb is rough 
 Nigga, what! 
 (Twin) 
 We true to be 
 Snake niggas for eternity 
 Mobb family 
 Murder thee 
 If it's meant to be 
 Trife casualty 
 Got the whole world after me 
 Catastrophe among us, fatal tragedy 
 Mafiosa, murder one mind 
 Black toaster, low composure 
 Twin Glocks in 2 holsters 
 We mobb vultures 
 Watch the fleet come closer 
 We tap down 
 Nowhere to run now 
 Don't back down 
 Muffled out my 4-pound 
 Silent sound 
 Bodies bloody on the ground 
 Chest full of 12 4-pound rounds 
 Nigga lay down, kid you assed out now 
 (Havoc) 
 No doubt, the infamous reppin' up in this 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 Next up 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yeah yeah whatever kid, whatever kid 
 Yo, yo, the chronicles of a criminal cat who hold gat 
 And bust back at trash ass cats who scratch 
 Leave big holes like bitches with they legs spread hot 
 Ready for action now peep my whole block 
 Unveiled, and reveal hazardous skill 
 Trained assassins of this rap danger field 
 I feel y'all niggas ain't really keepin' it real 
 Use that ice grill like a shield 
 Nigga you meal, for my vultures 
 Swoop down attack your corpse 
 And found layin' in the streets of New York 
 Now sleepwalk 
 For that shit you did, shoulda never had did 
 Now you boxed in 
 Sentenced to a lifetime bid 
 Nigga Noyd and Pee, shine light like jewelry 
 Silver and gold exclusively 
 Terrorize and multiplee 
 Shot up your spot up 
 It just ain't what you used to be 
 After these fists of NY struck you D 
 Now you see a whole new life and new leaf 
 Searchin' for an exit tryin' to retreat the street 
 Wavin' white flags no days, you dead meat 
 We only truce when your heartbeat cease, peace 
 (Big Noyd) 
 Now who dare swear they can step up on these premises 
 Protected by a bunch of menaces 
 Rapper Noyd, the soloist 
 4-pound controloist 
 Comin' out the infamous controllin' the shit 
 Pistol packin' Pee on the side of me 
 Leap if you think sweet 
 Shit's deep, infamously 
 Now check the family 
 Prodigy, H-A-V-O-C, Ty Nitty, Godfather pt. 3, Gambino, Face, and 
 Gotti 
 So don't try me 
 Or better yet don't try this 
 My click specialty is vulturin' 
 Trained endangerin' 
 Packin' pipe games 
 Them heavy metal thing things 
 Ain't nothin' changed 
 Karate Joe, Money No, make 'em fold 
 Gather up them hoes 
 Take 'em to the mo 
 Keep it on the low 
 You know the steelo, immediately 
 The VSOP is mandatory 
 It's all about hoes and clothes 
 The same story 
 Stackin' cheddar, packin' Berettas, keepin' it real 
 Fuck the sentimental feel 
 The Mobb movin' shit in reseal 
 Swiftly, smooth and quickly 
 The million dollar operation ran by the Mobb foundation 
 The nine pound we had it locked down 
 Kept 'em shook 
 Nine double trey's off da hook 
 The Mobb became famous from the lives that we took 
 Doin' jooks 
 So peep how the 4-pound sound it's off the motherfuckin' hook 
 Shit is real, plus exclusive and grimy 
 Rapper Noyd takin' over with the Mobb behind me 
 Nigga what.
