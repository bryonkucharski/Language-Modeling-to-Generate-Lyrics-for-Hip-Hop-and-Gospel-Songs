RJD2 drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts 
 Driftin away, and depress all within listening range 
 Nah but for real I got so much shit on my mind 
 From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line 
 And doing hip hop in this life in time ain't all nice and fine 
 At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme 
 Full of punchlines and jokes 
 Fuck ups and punches 
 It's like I can't get shit right the first time or something 
 When no one knows your name, your vinyl's still in stores 
 Once you get a little light through arguing over who feels it more 
 We got sixteen year old dead heads buying garbage 
 Wanting to keep you from their personal private artists 
 We don't do shit for the clubs 
 It's for our forty fives, 
 Go RJ the archaeologist diggin them up 
 And I'm the same cent, 
 To vinyl that gets sent to bash 
 In this for life till my final mic check is cashed
