Oh, I'm missing you 
 Tell me why the road turns 
 Oh oh, I'm missing you 
 Tell me why the road turns 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you 
 Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy nigga) 
 Peep me out look 
 I remember that day, shit'll never change 
 You was my nigga', should've never changed 
 Shit is all the same, nigga's die, momma's cry 
 Bitches turn sour now she fucking on that other guy 
 Fucking with that other side 
 Man I miss my nigga's 
 I ain't talking rap nigga's, man I miss my nigga's 
 Free Dame, free Wayne, free Derwin too 
 Free Bot, free Low, free Mo too 
 Mall took 18, Hyphe took 22, Real took a half of hundred 
 Something that I couldn't stomach 
 Tae just got locked up, D waiting on an appeal 
 Real ran in a bank, man life is so real 
 Mane just came home, but he back on the run 
 Somebody snitching on him told them where to find the gun 
 Thinking to myself, as I wrote this song 
 Most of my nigga's from my hood either dead or gone (It's Philthy) 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you 
 Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy, peep me out) 
 No block on my phone 
 My nigga's call straight through 
 Run up off at the mouth I'll have my nigga's scrape you 
 Nothing to live for, my nigga's doing life sentences 
 Either dead or in jail we doing life sentences 
 Rest in peace Dre Feddi, rest in peace Tee Woods 
 Rest in peace C and M until we fucking meet again 
 Free my nigga Chris the Fifth, free my nigga Chris Lokket 
 Real nigga's going to sleep is not a fucking option 
 It's a real nigga' behind this fucking ice 
 So keep it solid while you here, you don't live twice 
 Hold your head all my nigga's on the top tier 
 And pour some liquor for my nigga's that is not here 
 Rest in peace shirts, a lot of sad faces 
 A lot of snitch nigga's caught real nigga's cases 
 There ain't no day that go by that I don't think about you 
 Middle finger to the ones that don't think about you (It's Philthy) 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you 
 Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy nigga', I do this for y'all) 
 Nigga's don't understand to lose they right hand man 
 They go crazy in the head, rest in peace Lil Rege 
 I was raised by the streets, I wasn't raised by my parents 
 So being a real street nigga' could never be a challenge 
 Moms had 5 kids, 5 different baby daddies 
 Raised by the OG's I never had a fucking daddy 
 No I never needed one, I'm a father to my son 
 He don't even know my son 
 See this life hard, don't get it twisted though 
 I been a real nigga', since a snotty nose 
 5-0 killed Joddy, but they don't talk about it 
 I guess 'cause he was a felon, they don't talk about it 
 I miss my nigga's everyday no I can't lie 
 Even though I'm riding fly nigga' still cry 
 I miss my nigga's everyday no I can't lie 
 Even though I'm riding fly nigga' still cry (It's Philthy) 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you 
 Fuck what you're going through 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you, 
 Thinking of you.
