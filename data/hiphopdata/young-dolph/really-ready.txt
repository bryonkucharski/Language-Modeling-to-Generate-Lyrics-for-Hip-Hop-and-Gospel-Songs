I'm a real nigga, talking 'bout what I really have 
 'Cause I fucked a nigga bitch, that's why he really mad 
 Hit a nigga in his head, I be really glad 
 Since the day I lost Dunk, I been really sad 
 A nigga make a hit and dip, will he really last? 
 A nigga say he hold you down but will he really blast? 
 They say I'm worth fifteen M's but that ain't really shit 
 And I ain't content with what I got, got to be really rich 
 Sold dope on the really, was broke on the really 
 If you really wanna get it then you know I'm with it 
 Really wanna go to war with me, not really 
 You wanna get it then you gonna get it 
 You worth a mill', not really really 
 I ain't all in your business 
 If it's not your girl not really really, then why is it hurting your feelings? 
 My young niggas, they really ready 
 Straps cocked, are ready 
 These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really 
 We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us 
 Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage 
 My young niggas, they really ready 
 Straps cocked, are ready 
 These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really 
 We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us 
 Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage 
 On the real these rappers pussy, nah really, straight up 
 But meanwhile I'm in my traphouse, with 'bout six different flavors 
 But fuck that, let's get to it 
 Took out my scale, broke down the bale, and my clientele ran straight through it 
 Drinking mud, riding through the city, yup 
 Selling pea's out the coupe really, yup 
 Paid fifteen K for my S.S. and invested another fifty, yup 
 These rap niggas they don't wanna see me, nah 
 Guess a bitch with me taking off her draws' 
 Smoking weed and laughing, burning rubber while I'm running from the law 
 Really, fuck you nigga come get me 
 I'm a Cashtank nigga and all we do is get money, you feel me? 
 Know there's two Glock's with me, yup 
 Got that boy Guwop with me, yup 
 Downtown rooftop chilling, yup 
 Quarter mill' on the floor, really 
 My young niggas, they really ready 
 Straps cocked, are ready 
 These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really 
 We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us 
 Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage 
 Nigga I'm bickin' back and I'm boolin' 
 Drop the top, and then foolish 
 Finessing game with your main bitch, now my pockets is stupid 
 Fuck with Gucci, get you an issue 
 You pussy soft, like tissue 
 Hundred K'll get you knocked out 
 Put me in the ring, get boxed out 
 So I jump on the stage, get the team real hype 
 Gucci throw a cup and the whole squad fight 
 Bottles on me, so we pouring all night 
 Nigga get a trippy ? night 
 I'm jumping out that coupe, I lost my damn roof 
 Thank god that boy so fly, we don't need no parachute 
 So I'm chasing after fix, squeezing on these triggers 
 Bank account six figures, kick my feet up, Louie slippers 
 Vacation in the Hampton's, rockstar Marilyn Manson 
 All for that check, I hold a nigga ransom 
 My young niggas, they really ready 
 Straps cocked, are ready 
 These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really 
 We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us 
 Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage
