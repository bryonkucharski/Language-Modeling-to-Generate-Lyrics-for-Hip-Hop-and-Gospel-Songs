Zaytoven 
 Ayeeeee 
 You know what up, haha 
 It's Dolph! 
 Zay, what's poppin'! 
 Never trust a bitch, never trust a nigga 
 Fuck bitches, fuck bitches 
 Get the scrilla 
 Young hustla, these muthafuckin' niggas 
 Never trust a bitch nigga, get the scrilla 
 I don't fuck with these niggas 'cause they shady 
 These bitches they just wanna have my baby 
 Born in the 80s, crack baby 
 Mama she was in the streets, so guess who raised me (the streets) 
 You muthafuckin' right 
 Couldn't get it from my mama, so I got it off the block 
 Been working my whole life, but I ain't never punched the clock 
 9 years old I seen a nigga get shot, damn 
 Niggas quick to run their mouth when they get jammed 
 Pussy ass nigga telling on his own fam (pussy) 
 Same nigga that you break your neck for 
 Be the same nigga that cross you out and wet you up 
 'Pose to be chasin' money, but you chasin' bitches 
 Real bosses don't talk, we just sit back and listen 
 Stack that paper up, and then make boss moves 
 She like to argue so I sent that bitch to law school 
 Keep it real with your dawg no matter what (Preach) 
 Same bitch that claim she love you she'll set you up (Preach) 
 Out here in these streets it ain't no such thing as love (Preach) 
 The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs (Preach) 
 Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak, if that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech (Preach) 
 I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free (Preach) 
 Zay got the muthafuckin' bass thumpin, Dolph got the muthafuckin' trap jumpin' 
 Doors to the trap open, I'll sell you something 
 Hell nah, don't ask, I ain't frontin nothing 
 I fucked yo bitch then told her, "I'll see you around!" 
 Dolph just skipped town with 2 hunnit thou' 
 Dolph just poured an 8 in a two liter pop 
 They say Dolph addicted to these streets just like his pops 
 Addicted to hustlin', I can't stop (can't stop) 
 Won't stop (won't stop), can't stop 
 Never hear me complaining 'bout what I ain't got 
 'Cause if I want it, I'ma go get it 
 Free my nigga Yo Diddy 
 Got Paper Route tatted on yo ho titty 
 Same nigga you gettin' high with he really yo enemy 
 Everyday niggas cross they patnas out for Benjamins 
 Keep it real with your dawg no matter what (Preach) 
 Same bitch that claim she love you she'll set you up (Preach) 
 Out here in these streets it ain't no such thing as love (Preach) 
 The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs (Preach) 
 Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak, if that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech (Preach) 
 I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free (Preach)
