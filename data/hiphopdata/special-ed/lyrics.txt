Chorus 2X: "Lyrics somebody want lyrics (yeah yeah) 
 Somebody want lyrics" -- KRS-One 
 Verse One: 
 Here I go the lyrical specialist with the perscription 
 I give you the leagal drug addiction, nonfiction 
 I got the shank, to your memory bank 
 How sharp, don't be affraid of the dark 
 Come in to the light, you still can't see 
 It can't be, the historical, metaphorical, lyrical 
 Yes the S, you know the rest, fuck the spellin' 
 I'm tired of tellin' y'all who rule, cause you don't listen, fool 
 Your dealin' with a nigga feelin' fury 
 Surely, I purley destroy any toy with any game 
 That's why I never lose, I never play, I savaday style while I maintain mine 
 Same time yet, differ-rent, mag-nificent 
 No quest unless it's the Tribe 
 So check that vibe twice 
 'Cause I'm nice 
 Whoever got beef 
 Tell me the price 
 And I'll raise you a mill, days to a kill, some praise to a bill 
 Never, yeah I'm as lyrical as ever 
 Verse Two: 
 You wanna start about, have you thought about 
 Consequences, sentences, come to your sences, on the fences 
 'Cause I'm strictly throwin' hits 
 Knowin' it's, unfair 
 Gun here, throw in a extra clip 
 'Cause I'm next to flip 
 Next time, bring in a next rhyme, 'cause I 
 Float like dead body, sting like a tazer 
 Sharper than a ... lazer 
 Open heart ... major 
 Surgery transplant cause you have none 
 There's one, shoot a fair one, that's a real one 
 Grannit, with a enough heart to start 
 But can you manage when I brandige your bandage 
 And your stitch is open 
 And your bitch is open 
 Is she, somethins' fishy 
 I don't like dis 
 When I'm like dis they try to ammulate my likeness 
 Clones 
 Microphones break from my intake 
 For phatter, mass matter, glass shatter 
 Becareful, I got a airfole 
 Listen, I got them lyrics that your missin' 
 Verse Three: 
 You're commin' with your new sound 
 You never threw dowm 
 Why try, try my tie and hang em' high, in the closet 
 Cause it, wasn't, I good idiea 
 Who should I fear 
 No one, the son of Jah 
 Gimmie some la, and I get mystic 
 Lyricdistic 
 But wait, your not great, your not good 
 I shot wood, put you out your misery history in the makin' 
 Fuckin' with a crazy Jamacian 
 See, they vanish when I brandish the hair trigga 
 Yeah nigga 
 I'm goin' hay wire 
 Might fire 
 Might not 
 But it's white hot 
 And with the right flow, the shit might blow 
 So I detonate, then evacuate, leavin' ash, don't even ask 
 Feel the blast, fast, I know you won't last 
 But you can still try 
 Somebody want lyrics 
 Then come see the eye
