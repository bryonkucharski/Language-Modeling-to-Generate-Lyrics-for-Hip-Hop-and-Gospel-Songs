This is a mission, not a small time thing 
 Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went (*ring*) 
 Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl suzanne 
 And everything was goin' just accordin to plan 
 When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it 
 Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it 
 Just when things had started goin' great 
 It rang again I said, hold up, wait 
 Picked up the phone, yelled, who the hell is this? 
 Somebody said, this is serious business 
 There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors 
 Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours 
 I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped 
 I picked up the phone, but the man hung up 
 It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct' 
 I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck 
 Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess 
 Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west 
 Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel 
 The rambo knife with the hunting apparel 
 Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye 
 She said, special ed, don't go, you might die 
 Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shut her 
 I said, sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta 
 (You're on a mission) 
 Do what I gotta 
 This is a mission, not a small-time thing 
 Took the express on a air force jet 
 The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat 
 I was thinkin' of the message again and again 
 In particular the name of lu chin chen 
 Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill 
 You could tell I wasn't jokin by the look on my grill 
 Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after 
 A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master 
 Knew where to find him, knew where he would be 
 I turned around and showin up mr. chen found me 
 I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold 
 I said, I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole 
 Now you must die, because that is my mission 
 He flipped back, got into a fighting position 
 The tiger style, the shit was wild 
 He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile 
 I said, you can smile now, but you won't for long 
 Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song 
 He said, choose your style, I broke fool, I said, what? 
 Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut 
 It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin 
 Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in 
 His chest, he said, buddah bless and stood proud 
 Out shot the bullet, mr. chen just bowed 
 So I shot him again - yo, I couldn't believe 
 Mr. chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth 
 Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child 
 I got fed up, I thought of flatbush style 
 Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky 
 Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye 
 He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin 
 He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin' 
 Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet 
 So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet 
 (You're on a mission) 
 Jetted in the jet 
 This is a mission, not a small-time thing
