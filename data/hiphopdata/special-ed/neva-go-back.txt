I'm gettin' restless 
 What guessless 
 I'm rushin' the percusion 
 End of discusion 
 Now as you were 
 Your rhymes soft like fur 
 Oh' you wright for her 
 Well that explanit it 
 But I reign it, I rule it 
 So cool it, while I school it 
 Listen to percision 
 Rhyming, timing, climbing through your window 
 (Crooklyn style) be in yo 
 Damagin' your whole premises 
 Don't never diss 
 Cause here's your address 
 Cause me by yes, so come test me no 
 Like Patra, I got it soul like Sanatra 
 Organize rhymes in effect 
 Snap that neck, like E-Double if there be trouble 
 So, move on, there's nothing to see here 
 Clear the area 
 Your rhymes are dead, hit the berrier 
 To vary a I'm very a effetive I might add 
 Original rude, since I was a little lad 
 (Chorus: I neva go back, I neva flowed wack 
 I just come back, I just come phat 2x) 
 I'm pumpin' like Donivan plus 
 I'm a little vicious 
 I eat mcees 'cause they delicious 
 It's just, that so mistrust but I dust rhymes like a maid 
 Now I'm back with How 
 Stompin' like a parade, all up and down Fifth Ave 
 So you riff have plenty of back, 'cause I attack, like blood cells 
 Fighting off diseased mcees 
 Like Super Freinds, in a metropolis, in a super Bense 
 With Howie, now we, got two threes 
 Fuck it, six, gimmie the mix, and I'm a kill em' with the lyrics 
 So dig a plot, and nigga got, seven 
 Never doubt, I go all out, scadida 
 You need a map 
 You need a rap 
 You need a slap 
 You need a nap 
 So take one, because your tired 
 I get so phat, I feel wired 
 But I never sell, or fall, 'cause I never fell 
 I don't beg 
 I break your leg like an egg 
 And fry it try it, and see what happen when I'm rappin' 
 Shit start 
 So don't get smart like Max 
 Cause cold hard facts prevail 
 I don't sell, I don't turn pale 
 But I'm very ill, I'm fatal 
 I rock rhymes like a cradle 
 Many days, many ways, let me count em' 
 Everybody that I caught, everybody thought 
 But but, bu bu but, don't stutta 
 Just say it 
 Shit is budda 
 Now don't that feel betta 
 Get a sweata 
 'Cause it's gettin' colda 
 Every time I holda 
 Mic, niggaz freeze up, so eaze up like, off the scrotum 
 Cause you wrote um', like you know dum' 
 So let me show dum', real rhymes 
 'Cause I feel I might start buggin', if you don't back up off the mic 
 The lyrical war is on, and so I strike
