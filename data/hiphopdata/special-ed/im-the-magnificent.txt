I am the magnificent! 
 I'm the magnificent with the sensational style 
 And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute 
 'Cause I get in it like a car and drive 
 And if the record is smash, I can still survive 
 I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin' 
 Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin' 
 You might not understand what I'm saying at first 
 So Action Love, put it in reverse 
 I'm just conversin' with you, person 
 This is just a conversation 
 I'm Special Ed, with the special presentation, hey 
 I like to play, so for me it's recreaton 
 It's not just a job, it's an adventure 
 If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher 
 But ya gotta buy it, don't even try it 
 I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets 
 I collect my money in sets 
 One before the show and again when I jet 
 So I get mine, and I'm a get more 
 'Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure 
 So I don't need your tips or advice 
 'Cause I'm too nice for that, you rat 
 I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky 
 Battling is risky business 
 You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky 
 Isn't this enough? 
 Oh, you think you're tough, cookie 
 I think you better call your bookie 
 'Cause you can bet your life, that I'm gonna play you like hooky 
 On a Friday, this is my day 
 When I was through, I heard you say, Why they dis me like that? 
 I shoulda repent 
 Somebody shoulda said that Special Ed was the magnificent 
 I am the magnificent 
 I'm the magnificent, dynamite, super dope, outta sight 
 Special Ed with my trusty pal 
 Action Love, the run we shall 
 Continue to win you, yet this is not a game 
 But I'm 'a play you if say you claim to be better 
 I hate rumors and I give tumors 
 And our jammies get Grammys 
 Yet I'm not an actor, it's just a factor that we're famous 
 So don't blame us for nothin' 
 Action Love is cuttin', I'm on the rhyme 
 Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind 
 Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table 
 And let my D.J. cut ya 
 But you're such a little sucker 
 I might not even touch ya 
 I betcha whatcha want is just attention 
 Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention 
 Look at all the time and the money they spent 
 And now ya wanna die against I-the magnificent? 
 I am the magnificent! 
 I'm the magnificent with the sensational style 
 And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute 
 'Cause I get in it like a car and drive 
 And if the record is smash, I can still survive 
 I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin' 
 Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin' 
 You might not understand what I'm saying at first 
 So Action Love, put it in reverse
