(Verse 1: Juicy J) 
 I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit 
 Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm) 
 If it comes down to it, ain't no thang but to do it 
 Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it 
 You niggas playin' with real niggas' money 
 Get fronted, one day you is the plug 
 Next day you're in the dumpster 
 Couldn't keep it one hundred 
 You're thirty-two percent 
 The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch 
 (Hook: Juicy J) 
 Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying 
 Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking 'bout the Klan 
 This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing 
 It's eating time, me and my niggas buffeting 
 Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying 
 Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking 'bout the Klan 
 This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing! 
 It's eating time, me and my niggas buffeting 
 (Verse 2: Pusha T) 
 You don't know about this life, nigga 
 Earning all of these stripes, nigga 
 Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga 
 Throwin' bitches on flights, nigga 
 They ain't know that they're dykes, nigga 
 Till the money's out and the bottle's pouring 
 They're in the midst of they life, nigga 
 Rose gold on my wrist 
 This Rolex like Devil's piss 
 This Daytona illuminate 
 Y'all think I'm talking that devil shit 
 This's fifty racks, no bezel shit 
 Like blood diamonds, it's rebel shit 
 This's more guns, this's more bodies 
 We call shots, they nobodies 
 They fuck niggas, they owe prolly 
 Who's fuckin' with me? Nobody 
 When the guns drawn, they're so sorry 
 Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em 
 Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk 
 Fuck with my money and I'll hit you that body work 
 (Hook: Juicy J) 
 (Verse 3: Meek Mill) 
 Bad bitches on deck, nigga 
 Money, power, respect, nigga 
 Cop, cook, collect, nigga 
 You was never no threat, nigga 
 Everybody be rap dissin' 
 I catch niggas, I check niggas 
 These goons with me don't spit no verse 
 Just limo service, they stretch niggas 
 Black 'maro 2 S nigga 
 Couple birds on my neck, nigga 
 Everytime them hoes see me 
 They like, "Meek Milly you a mess, nigga" 
 2 gats, no vest, nigga 
 Strapped up like I'm a cowboy 
 Stand tall like that Yao boy 
 Got a bad bitch, she 5"4 
 This gold roley that's on my wrist 
 Leprechaun prolly die for 
 Young boys that's on my strip 
 They'll kill anything I say ride on 
 Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work 
 'Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work 
 (Hook: Juicy J) 
 (Verse 4: French Montana) 
 Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did 
 Know we love that KK sound 
 You know we not backing down 
 100 drum like, "Hold that doe" 
 Diamonds flash like Kodak, though 
 Straight cash, nigga fuck that loan 
 Seven digits on that phone 
 Money so long, smoke a whole zone 
 Getting blood money, tryna put my 'cause on 
 Bitch I'm on fire, got my jaw wired 
 Sex, money, murder - Peter Rollack (Soundview, whaddup) 
 Body work, chopper work like a techno song 
 Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey) 
 Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams 
 Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene 
 (Hook: Juicy J)
