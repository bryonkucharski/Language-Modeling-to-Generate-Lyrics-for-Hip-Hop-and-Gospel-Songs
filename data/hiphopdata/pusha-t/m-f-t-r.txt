Creep up on these niggas 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Speak up on these niggas 
 Speak up on a nigga 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Go and make it bang, go and make it bang 
 Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang 
 Niggas ain't been to church in a minute 
 But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious 
 Amen! 
 You rather be more famous than rich 
 Play your role, it's easy acting like Mitch 
 "Paid In Full" was more than reading a script 
 Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter 
 Filling all standing orders 
 Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water? 
 Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance 
 Yuugh, I'm drug money like Dapper Dan 
 No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters 
 We all know I did it; Rodriguez 
 The illusion of money we don't believe in 
 You ask me, Tyga looking like a genius 
 I'm Kim Jong of the crack song 
 Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem 
 Woo, the revolution will be televised 
 'Cause we done see all and they telling lies 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Speak up on these niggas 
 Speak up on a nigga 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Go and make it bang, go and make it bang 
 Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang 
 Niggas ain't been to church in a minute 
 But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious 
 Amen! 
 You rather be more famous than rich 
 Play your role, it's easy being my bitch 
 It's only right for a queen to floss your shit 
 Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist 
 The minimums, niggas ain't synonyms 
 Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers 
 Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits 
 Street millionaires rub shoulders 
 And laugh at bitches fucking promoters 
 Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus 
 What you fuck him for if you didn't know what the goal was? 
 Shine, remote control blinds 
 That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad 
 Ah, my living room rap scream crack money 
 I don't trust rap niggas or rap money 
 See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Speak up on these niggas 
 Speak up on a nigga 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Go and make it bang, go and make it bang 
 Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang 
 Niggas ain't been to church in a minute 
 But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious 
 Amen! 
 Niggas talking it, but ain't living it 
 Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit 
 They ask why I'm still talking dope, why not? 
 The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà 
 They say it's hate, but it's these well-dressed snakes 
 That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it 
 Yuugh, you ain't know, you got coached through it 
 Woo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it 
 Ha, the whole time I sold coke through it 
 Nigga, and records I was Bo through it 
 King Push is synonymous with kingpin 
 Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him 
 Yeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard 
 Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard 
 You wonder why I'm still here 
 I'm America's worst nightmare 
 Night, night nigga 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Creep up on these niggas 
 Speak up on these niggas 
 Speak up on a nigga 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything 
 Go and make it bang, go and make it bang 
 Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang 
 Niggas ain't been to church in a minute 
 But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious 
 Amen!
