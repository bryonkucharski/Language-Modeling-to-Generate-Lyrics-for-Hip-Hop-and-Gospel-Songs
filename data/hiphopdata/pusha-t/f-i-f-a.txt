They been trying to tie me to the BALCO 
 Too many clicks in the dial tone 
 I'm my city's Willy Falcon 
 How you niggas celebrating Alpo? 
 I'm disgusted 
 Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall's adjusted 
 Trap doors everywhere 
 Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge 
 Four Seasons all four seasons 
 It's good to have a getaway for no reason 
 Concierge never speak 
 'Cause this week look like last week 
 They both named Ashley 
 I might travel to El Barrio 
 To get it from Daddy-O then adios 
 Cellphone at the back patio 
 I didn't have to make a cameo to get it off 
 I hope you betting on the sleeper 
 It all started on a beeper 
 Now they asking for the feature 
 Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers 
 Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA 
 Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff 
 Beverly Hills Jed Clampett 
 A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom 
 Cameo Chris Hansen 
 I'm at your door 
 You don't wanna know him if you owe him 
 I done boxed in cars and had to tow 'em 
 I done laid in lawns when they didn't mow 'em 
 Even hogtied wives, I had to show 'em 
 That I mean business 
 I mean everything I say, no witness 
 No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief 
 It's on through infinity, my arms are endless 
 Your arms, too short to box with God 
 Might send a bitch a Elie Saab 
 She fucks and robs 
 10 grand just to touch the job 
 Close range, she don't duck and dodge 
 You can't trust them odds 
 I hope you betting on the sleeper 
 It all started on a beeper 
 Now they asking for the feature 
 Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers 
 Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA 
 I hope you betting on the sleeper 
 It all started on a beeper 
 Now they asking for the feature 
 Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers 
 Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA
