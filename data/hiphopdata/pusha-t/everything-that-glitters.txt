(Hook: French Montana) 
 Better know who you is 
 When you lookin' in the mirror 
 Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' low (?) from the hater 
 Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin' 
 Ridin' with my niggas 
 Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' low (?), hold me from the haters 
 Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin' 
 Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high 
 Just another day getting by, by, by 
 (Verse 1: Pusha T) 
 For every brick broke down it's one stepped on 
 For every known rat, it's one slept on 
 For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin' 
 For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin' 
 So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles 
 Let me drop another classic and a tour follows 
 Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow 
 My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles 
 Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines 
 The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding 
 Better know who that is looking in the mirror 
 The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer 
 (Verse 2: Pusha T) 
 I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone 
 They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone 
 Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome 
 Took a brick and I turned it to stone 
 5 into 10, the Return of the Clones 
 Then I took my experience and turned it to poems 
 As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings 
 Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed 
 Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed 
 Few still reminiscin' in they CL 
 Selling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12
