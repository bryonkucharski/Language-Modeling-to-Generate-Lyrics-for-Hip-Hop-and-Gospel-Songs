(Kanye West - Hook) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it 
 Or just kiss it, kiss it, 
 Shit, do something 
 Do something 
 Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it 
 Or just kiss it, kiss it, 
 Shit, do something 
 Do something 
 (Pusha T - Verse 1) 
 Please, pretty please 
 I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees 
 Or maybe you could touch it 
 See where it leads 
 Go head just beat it, like you was billy jean 
 You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend 
 That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need 
 You in college now, so you too old to tease 
 I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need 
 And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed 
 'Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen 
 I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe 
 You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream 
 (Kanye West - Hook) 
 (Pusha T - Verse 2) 
 Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know 
 How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe 
 My love game got you feeling so official though 
 I let you referee, just let your whistle blow 
 I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground 
 I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town 
 The Commes De Garcons, Christian Louboutin 
 The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on 
 I don't deny it, baby I just buy it 
 Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it 
 Alas, I'm past on my past 
 I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last 
 (Kanye West - Hook) 
 Touch it, touch it, touch it 
 Or just kiss it, kiss it, kiss it 
 Do something, uh uh, do something 
 See we can take it slow, or we can take it there 
 I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair 
 We both give a little, we just play it fair 
 You this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare 
 Put out cards on the table, lets play truth or dare 
 Let your hair down, I don't have you pegged as a square 
 Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless 
 You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck 
 We don't give a damn who's watching 
 Me slowing down, not an option 
 And the buck hair's waving in the wind 
 You are such a champ how you take it on the chin 
 (Kanye West - Hook) 
 Just touch it, touch it, touch it 
 Or just kiss it, kiss it, kiss it 
 Shit, do something, do something 
 Would ya please, touch it, touch it 
 Could ya please kiss it, kiss it 
 Baby do something, I need you do to something
