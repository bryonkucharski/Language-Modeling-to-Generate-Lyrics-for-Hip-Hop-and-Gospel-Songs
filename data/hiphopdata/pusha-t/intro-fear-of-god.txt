Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay? 
 Just remember last year at this time 
 We were in a fucking cage, okay? 
 (You remember 
 I'd like to forget that) 
 I say be happy with what you've got 
 (You be happy 
 Me, I want what's coming to me) 
 Oh, well what's coming to you? 
 (The world chico 
 And everything in it)
