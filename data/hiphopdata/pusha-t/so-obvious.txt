In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares 
 Let the gods of the game know I'm right here 
 To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears 
 Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope 
 I inspire all the rappers that you might quote 
 Lookin' down on you niggas like white folk 
 You're entitled to believe all your high hopes 
 When you can fool anybody with the right hoax 
 Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em 
 With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em 
 Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em 
 I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'? 
 I just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it (3X) 
 It's so obvious; in my clothes you can smell it 
 Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it 
 Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it 
 Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it 
 Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it 
 Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it 
 Let the critics praise, let the charts do it 
 As I burn through this money, no thought to it 
 80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it 
 I just shop through it; cook and chop to it 
 Move Heavy D; I should walk to it 
 We got our own thing; drop the top to it 
 This is block music; Wacka Flock to it 
 I'm so raw, runnin' from the law 
 A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw 
 Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws 
 Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw 
 In that two-door, no rims on the car 
 The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw 
 See what I saw, the best getting better 
 Look, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper 
 Q-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better 
 K-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter 
 Oh, there it is; let the triple beam measure 
 Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever
