Pharrell Williams: 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong 
 But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey 
 Pusha T: 
 Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo 
 Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go 
 Oh, my nigga say it ain't so 
 Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know 
 We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops 
 So close niggas thought we had the same pops 
 Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks 
 But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box 
 Hearing whispers, "it ain't adding up" 
 Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough 
 I never thought I'd be the last man standing up 
 I never thought I'd had have to question "Were you man enough?" 
 Long letters how the streets got the best of you 
 Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you 
 Yeah, see I can read between the lines 
 So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press five 
 Pharrell Williams: 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone? 
 So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey 
 Pusha T: 
 Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls 
 Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall 
 It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall 
 But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall 
 They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone 
 And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home 
 Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome 
 I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone 
 Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you 
 Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you 
 So much for death before dishonor 
 Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor 
 I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers 
 When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder 
 Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak 
 What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak, saying 
 Pharrell Williams: 
 "Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong 
 But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey" 
 Pusha T: 
 Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga 
 How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga? 
 Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that 
 We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that 
 Every move we ever made is getting stared at 
 I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back 
 Break your heart when the man you call your brother 
 Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers 
 Called my mom mother, was at my graduation 
 When I signed my record deal you was my motivation 
 Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation 
 Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that 
 Pharrell Williams: 
 "Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home 
 I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone? 
 So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey"
