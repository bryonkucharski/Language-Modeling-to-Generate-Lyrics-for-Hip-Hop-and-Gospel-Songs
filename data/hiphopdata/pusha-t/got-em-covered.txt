 Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe 
 I build it better nigga ten fold 
 La Ferrari from the Enzo 
 The stencil inspired by Kenzo 
 The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple 
 40 keys in a rental 
 My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel 
 I keep cash, case Feds connect me 
 Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me 
 Not concerned with your rap beef 
 Poetic justice watching you sock puppets 
 Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered 
 The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it 
 Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget 
 I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can't touch it 
 Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it 
 Trap phone, gun at your backbone 
 Graduated from the corner where the crack's thrown 
 Back talk to your momma now you act grown 
 Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone 
 I relate to 'em 
 I'm a Pyrex God, shit I'm great to 'em 
 All of you lil' niggas quote all of the wrong figures 
 Poke all of the wrong bitches 
 And follow the wrong niggas 
 Whichever rapper hot at the moment 
 Don't realize he a candle till he blow it 
 I gave y'all the game it's decoded 
 The only thing left is to grow it 
 Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two 
 It's all hustlin', so deja vu 
 Still a nigga unwrap bricks 
 I'ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff 
 Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it 
 Game too emo, I'm too Nino 
 Must stay low-key, I play Reno 
 I'm so Pesci, too Casino 
 We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos 
 Outlandish, so illegal 
 So Carlito, so Pacino 
 We sip vino, the grapes of wrath 
 Money counter go till it breaks in half 
 Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon 
 Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline 
 The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside 
 Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides 
 Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5 
 Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson 
 The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line 
 Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered 
 The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
