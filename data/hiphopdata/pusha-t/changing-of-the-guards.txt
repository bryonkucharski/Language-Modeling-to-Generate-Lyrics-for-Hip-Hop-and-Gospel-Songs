Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
 These niggas heads is too light 
 Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha 
 It's like the changing of the guards 
 We changing out the frauds 
 I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz 
 Long time coming, Sam Cooking up these bars 
 Still Eddy Caning, see the fiends sunk in jaws (Yiuuck) 
 Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw 
 Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar (Yess) 
 I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I'm home 
 Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Woo) 
 Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm 
 Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home (Yess) 
 So as I embark, this where begin start 
 I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp 
 My life's a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it 
 The Penthouse's bed needs a crane for it 
 I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch from out the rainforest 
 So many bitches it's a blur, I take the blame for it (Woo) 
 God in heaven knows what I feel inside 
 Responsible for all this inner-city genocide 
 I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify 
 As I uplift this art form ceiling high 
 I can't identify, with your one death 
 We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath 
 Outsiders looking in like using one ref 
 My zip cam point of view to you is one step 
 Closer to clarity, not a parody 
 How cocaine single handedly carried me 
 Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly 
 They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me 
 I just shake it off, then I shake a leg 
 A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said 
 The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg 
 Then guns shots going off that'll awake the dead 
 Push!
