I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long 
 I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long 
 America, you need a miracle 
 Beyond spiritual 
 I need a realer view 
 I hold a mirror to it 
 These ain't new problems, they just old ways 
 I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray 
 Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead 
 Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs 
 Not guilty, still I'm filthy 
 In FOX eyes, we the dark side 
 So they tell you lies 
 Through a TV, C-N-B-C 
 C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me 
 In order to be me 
 You gotta see what Chief Keef see 
 Brenda's baby next door to the candy lady 
 Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands 
 Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day 
 Grandma praying someday 
 But God can't hear it over gun play 
 Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose 
 Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain't enough proof 
 So we still lose 
 I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long 
 I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long 
 I don't got no march in me, I can't turn the other cheek 
 While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach 
 Funeral flowers, every 28 hours 
 Being laid over ours 
 Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power? 
 Looking over their allowances 
 Building prisons where the mountains is 
 Laptops is for the county kids 
 Metal detectors is where ours is 
 They'll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history 
 The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery 
 And so it goes, every truth don't get told 
 All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole 
 Every goose don't lay gold whoa 
 Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead 
 Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs 
 They call in the National Guard 
 Public Enemy, I am Chuck D 
 Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I'm Huey P 
 Woo! The new elite, it's either you or me 
 Let the sunshine, 'cause their dark clouds try to ruin me 
 It's more and more and more than Baltimore 
 From shore to shore, oh lord 
 Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord 
 I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long 
 I say hey, sunshine 
 Oh how the day can be so long
