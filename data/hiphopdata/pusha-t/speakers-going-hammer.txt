I wake up, early in the morning 
 Around the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup? 
 And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck 
 Everybody in my city show me love 
 Because I have the speakers going hammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer 
 The dough boy version ? yeah 
 Back up in this bitch niggers free to go 
 It was all good just a key ago 
 Price for the 20 all I need to know 
 Still moving snow like it's 3 below 
 You trace hard while I keep card 
 You niggers little bees to the base guard 
 I've been cooking, is you mistooking? 
 Shot town plug got the city junking 
 Jivon she motorcycle leathers, 
 Mad max 5 stacks before I look this weather 
 Small circle bad bitches all think they clever 
 The mix 1 whole shape and recycle better 
 Sit them on a curve when I'm done with them 
 She oblivious a girl wanna come with them 
 Can't blame off another niggers can't run with them 
 Husein bolt through these bitches then I'm done with them 
 I wake up, early in the morning 
 Around the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup? 
 And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck 
 Everybody in my city show me love 
 Because I have the speakers going hammer 
 Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer 
 The dough boy version ? yeah 
 See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long 
 You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on you nigger 
 Get it right.
