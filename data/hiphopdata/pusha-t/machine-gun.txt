Chase and Status 
 King Push 
 D boy, dark side, stash money, archive 
 R.I.P. nigga, that's me nigga, that's all eyes 
 Seein' me with them hoes, seein' me in them clothes 
 I'm settled in, I'm settin' trends, they TMZin' my pose 
 Doors up, hard top, money, cash, that's hard knock 
 Life foul, this lifestyle, I'm documentin' it right now 
 G.O.O.D. Music, God level, goes hard for the whole game 
 All white everything, my hands dirty with cocaine 
 Machine gun 
 Machine gun 
 Daredevil, stunt man, fly nigga, you jumpman 
 G5s we jump start, with the Joker smile on that front end 
 Fist in, might sit twelve, you ain't talking no thick hoes 
 If you like me? That's 2 niggas and 6 bitches in tight clothes 
 "Mo' money, mo' problems" motto don't mean much 
 All gold everything, not Trinidad, nigga, King Tut 
 King Push, kilo, I'm the voice of it, Cee Lo 
 Machine gun, Steve-O, it's just as big as my ego
