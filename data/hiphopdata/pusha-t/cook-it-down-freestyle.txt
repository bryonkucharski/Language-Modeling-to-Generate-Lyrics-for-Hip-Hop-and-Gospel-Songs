I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness 
 So now I'm just asking you to listen 
 I'm living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching 
 Last words "fuck you all" feel the ropes tension 
 I'll never compromise, in it till the powder dries 
 Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise 
 I floss in their honor, there legacy's in bottles 
 Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner 
 We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her 
 I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha 
 Yeah, spend money like we print money 
 Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money 
 The AC is forever broke, that's vent money 
 Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money 
 Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for 
 Always thinking big now they praying for downfall 
 Say you telling on me, told them folks 'bout me 
 All this coke round me like it floats round me 
 Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down 
 Cook it down every time I come around 
 I just bought the house, put the pent on it 
 No rent couple hundred K spent on it 
 Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down 
 Cook it down every time I come around 
 Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view 
 'Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew 
 Now I'm standing at the top from the words I drew 
 Rap shit'll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew 
 Mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a Molotov 
 Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues 
 A small price for my cocaine catalogue 
 Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk 
 Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me 
 If you can't feel the joy off a hustler in his glory 
 Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story 
 ATL, Glenridge, condo's true story 
 A man of everything that I say I am 
 A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am 
 Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand 
 Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it's Peter Pan 
 Say you telling on me, told them folks 'bout me 
 All this coke round me like it floats round me 
 Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down 
 Cook it down every time I come around 
 I just bought the house, put the pent on it 
 No rent couple hundred K spent on it 
 Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down 
 Cook it down every time I come around
