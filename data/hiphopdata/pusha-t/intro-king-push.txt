Ven Aqua, who you wanna be? 
 Drug Dealer? dime 
 Rap nigga? 
 You tryna save the culture? 
 A dios mio 
 You gotta pick one daddy 
 Leave your conscious at the door 
 We done hid the monsters in the floor 
 I speak to the trap lords 
 And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards 
 I done been black balled 
 And never gave a fuck 'cause I'm Jack Frost 
 Of sellin' that blast off 
 I'm on a crash course 
 Where talent meets timing 
 Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing 
 Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing 
 I'm my brother's keeper, Lord Willin', keep grindin' 
 As a God amongst men 
 Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins 
 Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends 
 Still held back, I done paid with my skin 
 The only thing missing is a cape on me 
 You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me 
 Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear 
 Now it's murder was the case homie 
 I'm watching this three ring circus 
 Old lions don't roar, so the clowns ain't nervous 
 Even you fools serve purpose 
 Let 'em run amuck until the king resurface 
 Then it's off with your heads 
 Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you're dead 
 They take samples of 'em, I make examples of 'em 
 It's the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered 
 Ask 'Ye who's loyalty more realer 
 Ask P, who's core's a drug dealer 
 Me and Tim, it's coming, it's gonna kill 'em 
 The only great I ain't made better was J. Dilla 
 Now we breaking new ground 
 Get ready for the placing of the crown 
 King Push nigga!
