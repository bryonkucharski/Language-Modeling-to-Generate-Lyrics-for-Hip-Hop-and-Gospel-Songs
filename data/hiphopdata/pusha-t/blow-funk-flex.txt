Pusha T: 
 Malice found religion, Tony found prison 
 I'm just tryna find my way up out this fucking kitchen 
 A Birdseye view got me channeling my vision 
 Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling 
 Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven 
 We kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors 
 Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors 
 Pussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue 
 Grant's, Jackson's, no room for George 
 Yeah, the fear of God's in you motherfuckers 
 This art imitate my life 
 Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white 
 Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice 
 My music's for your soul, inspiration for your life 
 Every dime made in his life more disastrous 
 Help my young bitch see her way through her bachelors 
 While my old bitch went back to get her Masters 
 Same graduation, I was clapping in the rafters 
 The truth hurts every time it's revealed 
 What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel 
 Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park 
 Kentucky derby on the grill 
 The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great 
 Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate 
 These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear 
 Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear 
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper 
 Hakuna matata, feet up, sipping java 
 Ey yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem? 
 Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler? 
 So many hands raised as the band plays 
 I'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change 
 Kanye West: 
 And eventually answers to the call of Autumn 
 All of them fallin' for the love of ballin' 
 Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin 
 Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums 
 Based off the way we was branded 
 Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon 
 And at the airport they check all through my bag 
 And tell me that it's random 
 But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage 
 I need a happy ending and a new beginning 
 And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative 
 This the real world, homie, school finished 
 They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it 
 I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS 
 I won't be satisfied till all my niggas get it, get it? 
 I need more drinks and less lights 
 And that American Apparel girl in just tights 
 She told the director she tryna get in a school 
 He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool" 
 It's been a while since I watched the tube 
 Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news" 
 I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today 
 They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday 
 And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach? 
 I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach 
 My guy said I need a different approach 
 Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke 
 It ain't funny anymore try different jokes 
 Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O 
 Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it 
 Play strings for the dramatic 
 And end all of that wack shit 
 Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes 
 I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it 
 I'm coming after whoever. Who has it? 
 You blowing up, that's good, fantastic 
 That y'all, it's like that y'all 
 I don't really give a fuck about it at all 
 Cause the same people that tried to black ball me 
 Forgot about two things, my black balls 
 Pusha T: 
 Uh, look, Uh uh 
 I let you into my diary to admire me 
 The making of this man, I let you see the higher me 
 The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy 
 I'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese 
 The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada 
 Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata 
 And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga 
 One chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter 
 Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who 
 Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom 
 And blossom, I swear this Vegas night was fucking awesome 
 But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em 
 Loss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em 
 Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune 
 Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen 
 Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthafucking gorgeous, whoa 
 As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith 
 Whiter than that coke brush did they paint me with [?] 
 Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss 
 But they devil-red, tires double tread 
 I postin parks up, that gives me double head 
 Tight rope walking, tryna keep a level head 
 The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did 
 Yeah
