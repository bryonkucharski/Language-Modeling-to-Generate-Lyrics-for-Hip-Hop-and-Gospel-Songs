I see the strongest things 
 The evil that money brings 
 I swear it's like a disease 
 That goes round and round and round like sirens 
 And they wanna bury me 
 Why? 'Cause I'm anti everything 
 I swear it's like a disease 
 That goes round and round and round like sirens 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy after all 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy not at all 
 Get in them drawers 
 I had a dream I had it all 
 I woke up and really had it all 
 The three leading killers of you niggas 
 Is the shit that's most appealing to you niggas 
 Even I fell victim to it, your pride don't let you do it 
 The lies will get you through it 
 Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail 
 Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it 
 Dope is like a two-way street 
 The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat 
 Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep 
 Every sparkle in the club that wasn't ours, we compete 
 Poor minds, poor decision makers 
 No reward, then what's the risk you taking? 
 New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war 
 Won't unveil it yet, can't tell it yet 
 Defense wins games Bill Belichick 
 These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check 
 Yuugh 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy after all 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy not at all 
 Get in them drawers 
 I had a dream I had it all 
 I woke up and really had it all 
 Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas 
 That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts 
 Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits 
 Now the Major League's where you're fishing 
 You young and hot, so why not? 
 The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot 
 We can't judge you 'cause we ain't hug you 
 We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you 
 For real, we made you watch from afar 
 Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star 
 Until we seen them foreign cars pull up 
 And watch them pick you up 
 And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough 
 So, make us proud, make it count 
 Until you learn to love 'em, make 'em spare no amount 
 Make 'em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it 
 Take advantage of it when you're worth it 
 Real bitches worth it 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy after all 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy not at all 
 Get in them drawers 
 I had a dream I had it all 
 I woke up and really had it all 
 I've been watching all you real niggas 
 I done see more won't than you will niggas 
 Take a swing, snatch a chain 
 Lose your mind, go insane 
 I'm in the club, you in the club too 
 I got money, you got money too 
 You think it's honey dew 
 Whispering in my ear like a hunny do 
 Eyeballing every bottle that we running through 
 Trying to stand near, nigga damn near 
 Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here 
 It's no pictures, now you in your feelings 
 I'm a real dope boy, no stranger dealings 
 Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos 
 Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos 
 I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money 
 I get it done for quarter ki money, for real 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy after all 
 Money, pussy, alcohol 
 You niggas pussy not at all 
 Get in them drawers 
 I had a dream I had it all 
 I woke up and really had it all
