(Intro: Pusha T) 
 Real dope dealers for real! 
 Haha! Hahaha 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam 
 Turn the whole brick to a Lam 
 Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat 
 Keepin' it soft like a mink 
 Gold on my link, coke in the sink 
 Choppin' that work like karate 
 Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati 
 That's a whole lot of new money 
 Snatch it, then hide it from the 12 
 Movin' them squares and them bales, servin' the rawest of yayo 
 Beating that china like Kunta Kinte 
 Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkway 
 Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up 
 Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug 
 Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good 
 Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood 
 Bakin' soda water splash the scales 
 Fork in my right and my pot in my left 
 Leanin' over, over to the side, I whip me a four way to a nine 
 The dirty, the money is homicide and my recipe can't be televised 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better 
 When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better 
 Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face 
 Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie till the bezel break? 
 Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails 
 Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell 
 Yughh! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey 
 From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies 
 Pablo, Versace way before Migos 
 My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos 
 Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole 
 Made it through to the other side, now nothing's big as my ego, Push 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Me, I try to leave the best for later 
 But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator 
 The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite 
 Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked 
 Frequency high, like a spaceship 
 She say that she like it and she's been exposed 
 The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes 
 That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo 
 I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip 
 And packin' with the biggest missiles 
 These niggas is knocking over vehicles 
 These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas 
 These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas 
 These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas 
 These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas 
 These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga 
 If you got two hoes, you need to let one go 
 Two Lambos, you need to let one go 
 All these drones while y'all smoke dro 
 There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know 
 Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though 
 Big ass bag but no man sandals 
 All that war, we need to let that go 
 That boom business, I'ma get that ho 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child 
 How you think about that coupe, with no roof? Young nigga cashed out 
 Popped so many Percs, popped so many Zans, young nigga 'bout to pass out 
 12 jump behind me, I got some in the car, young nigga 'bout to smash out 
 Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out 
 QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine 
 Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron 
 Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday 
 Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait 
 I keep a 45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope 
 The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope 
 Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go 
 Young nigga tricked up, now he spendin' that money with Casino! 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope 
 Aye move that dope, aye move that dope 
 Young nigga move that dope
