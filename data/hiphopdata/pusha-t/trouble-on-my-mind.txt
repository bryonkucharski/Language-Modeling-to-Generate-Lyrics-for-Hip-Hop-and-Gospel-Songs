(Verse 1: Pusha T) 
 It's the blackout, 'rari got the back out 
 Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house 
 Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route 
 Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house 
 Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot 
 Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots 
 G.O.O.D. had room for one more, I took the last spot 
 Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot 
 Whole 'nother level, then you add fame 
 That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer 
 That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar 
 That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto 
 Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto 
 The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle 
 Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV 
 Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle 
 Trouble on my mind 
 I got trouble on my mind 
 Trouble on my mind 
 So much trouble on my mind 
 (Verse 2: Tyler) 
 Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em 
 Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em 
 Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem 
 'Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms 
 Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick 
 When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips 
 Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin' 
 Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick 
 I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks 
 Is a must, like the arm of my pits 
 You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume 
 On sale during Christmas in Philly 
 Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly 
 Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies 
 Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest 
 With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit 
 (Verse 3: Tyler) 
 I'm a fucking walking paradox 
 And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks 
 Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!" 
 With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs 
 Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly 
 Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy 
 The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful 
 And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the 
 (Pusha T) 
 With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz 
 Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug 
 Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs 
 And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does? 
 This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry 
 Two different worlds, same symmetry 
 And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top 
 Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me
