Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi 
 Recorded in Emirate's palace 
 I bring to you the Fear of God 
 Noah on the boards. Steven Victor on the camera 
 Virgil whatup? 
 They say it took confidence 
 I just call it patience 
 'Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence 
 Now when the feds watch me, private paparazzi 
 Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi 
 Against all odds see the judge tried to Pac me 
 Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming "Yatzhee" 
 Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train 
 Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane 
 12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya 
 These rappers get away with pushing child Illingers 
 Now it's hard feelings... I just put my ceiling up 
 Planetarium push, the Imax experience 
 They say I talk coke for 9 years long 
 That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong 
 You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone 
 But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw 
 Nigga get your bag on 
 Bitch get your bag on 
 Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home 
 Yeah, see my verse I let you tag along 
 Swim in the oasis of this drug dealer Babylon 
 3 bitches 3 different flights 
 Glad it was 4 sides at that Paul Williams fight 
 The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms 3 nights 
 As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice 
 You can't just rap this; the same mindset 
 That had me hiding in the mattress, now got me round the atlas 
 Wish every dough boy could get a crack at this 
 They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter 
 Can I live? 
 You tell me, can I live?
