Now that you're focused 
 I'm glad that you noticed 
 The realest nigga here 
 It's kinda chilly being the coldest 
 Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our "Otis" 
 Now witness the chosen 
 It's just different here 
 Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice 
 Play in paradise 
 All I know is white 
 Get the powder gone 
 Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall 
 Mattress full of money, let it break the fall 
 Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass 
 They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last 
 I been preaching since money, cash-hoes 
 And I promise, I hardly see you 
 From where I am it's so hard to see you 
 Got money I've been different ever since 
 Maybe it's me and my arrogance 
 Who are you, who are you anyway? 
 Who are you, who are you anyway? 
 Who are you? We don't know you 
 Who are you? We don't know you 
 I'm the fire and the base 
 I'm admired by the greats 
 This to each and every rap nigga 
 I look you liars in the face 
 Cold case, Rolls Wraith 
 Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars 
 See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar 
 Who you know better with the raw? 
 Bogota, she like finessing niggas 
 She gets a Range Rover Sport 
 And got seats on the court from the best of niggas 
 I never bit at that apple 
 I never lost my El Chapo 
 I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule 
 Covered in white like I walked in the chapel 
 I'm that cold 
 And I promise, I hardly see you 
 From where I am it's so hard to see you 
 Got money I've been different ever since 
 Maybe it's me and my arrogance 
 Who are you, who are you anyway? 
 Who are you, who are you anyway? 
 Who are you? We don't know you 
 Who are you? We don't know you 
 The last dope dealer 
 Red leather in a room full of Thrillers 
 The mamas, they zombies 
 Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me 
 Woo, safe look like it got a printer 
 Ain't no rappers in that Sprinter 
 Ain't no saints, only sinners 
 What bitch ain't fucked a winner? 
 I'm a blue ribbon nigga 
 Talk down on you two pigeon niggas 
 Front five or better 
 Yeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever
