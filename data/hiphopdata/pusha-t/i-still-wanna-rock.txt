It's like an itch you can't scratch 
 It's like a bitch you can't shake 
 I still wanna 
 Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless 
 Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus 
 In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in 
 The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond 
 Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up 
 Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin 
 Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin 
 Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings 
 Updated that, upgraded that 
 Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack 
 Yeah, talk money, shit I'm made of that 
 Cocaine parties like the seventies, I cater that 
 You know what fame is? Sitting with the woman 
 Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is 
 You know what pain is? Flushing two bricks 
 And tryna have a nigga strain it out the drainage 
 See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo 
 I still wanna sell kilos 
 It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico 
 I still wanna sell kilos 
 Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo 
 I still wanna sell kilos 
 That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito 
 I still wanna sell kilos 
 Grew up watching momma car repoe'd 
 A little nigga staring through the peep hole 
 How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there 
 Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared 
 Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets 
 When we talking business, talking on the phone cease 
 Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar 
 Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's 
 Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out 
 Red velor, I'm in the white glass house 
 Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale 
 City of dope where real niggas sell yay' 
 Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why 
 Show 'em all love, the bitches fucked on the side 
 Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church 
 Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work 
 Testarossa top models, G fours 
 Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win 
 Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing 
 Black label everything, logos in the lining 
 Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head 
 Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead 
 The Rose bottles pour for the champions 
 You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills 
 Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance 
 Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras 
 Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards 
 Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on 
 Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on 
 Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper 
 Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging 
 Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in
