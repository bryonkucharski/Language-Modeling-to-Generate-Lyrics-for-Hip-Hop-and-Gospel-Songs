 Oh boy, she want a dope boy 
 She want to throw bands on her pole dance 
 No test drivin' that two door 
 She want to stunt with me on her old man 
 Oh God my IG is like iv to this lifestyle 
 I buy this shit, take a pic 
 And you OD on my life files 
 Shawty get it (get it) 
 Do it big, Do it good 
 Work it like a girl should 
 Work it good (work it good) 
 Bring it back (bring it back) 
 Tell the DJ bring it back 
 Let me touch it, fuck it baby 
 Tell your man he ain't getting it back 
 Shawty is so ratchet, baby I'm so ratchet 
 You so bomb with that, I got to have it 
 I got to have it, like a 9 I got to blast it 
 So fine I got to grab it, she don't mind

 You ain't even seen it 
 Touchin' on it, rubbin' on it 
 Girl you got me feinin' 
 All about her money 
 And I'm all about my money 
 Million dollar babies plus alimony 
 First a nigga save you 
 (Then a nigga grave you) 
 And ain't nobody got time for that 
 So it's best just to pay ya 
 Thirteen cars I don't need nothing else 
 Just this booty on my lap 
 And this gold on my neck

 She stare at me while I'm starin' at it 
 I'm a young sexy ass charismatic ass 
 Gorgeous face ass havin' ass nigga 
 That she love in her panty hose 
 She need this dick like its antidote 
 That pussy is a work of art painted by Michael Angelo 
 I wake up to pussy and cantaloupe 
 Then she made me fuck my appetite 
 Fuckin' so hard I'ma remember this in the afterlife 
 I tell her slob on my knob 
 Like its corn on the cob 
 She keep goin' oh my god 
 And my broad is so bad I can't hit from the back 
 All my favourite girls got my initials as tats 
 Finally Famous she throw this set up 
 Like Sororities and Frats 
 Niggas can't tell me shit but congrats

 Could be my baby momma 
 I got my left hand on that booty 
 Got my right hand on that pussy
