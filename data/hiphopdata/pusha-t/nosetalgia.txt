Pusha T: 
 Twenty plus years of selling Johnson and Johnson 
 I started out as a baby face monster 
 No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience 
 My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense 
 Gem Star razor and a dinner plate 
 Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date 
 Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate 
 'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak 
 Nigga, I was crack in the school zone 
 Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned 
 Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on 
 Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on 
 Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches 
 What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor 
 Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies he dies 
 Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides he rides 
 Throwing punches in his room, if he cries he cries 
 We don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die 
 We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh 
 We playing on a higher game of chess 
 Once you delegate his bills who gon' fuck his bitch the best? 
 A million megapixels of the Pyrex 
 Started on the scale digital, my only Timex 
 Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest 
 Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus 
 Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red 
 Blood on your diamonds till you dying, dead, yugh 
 KRS-One: 
 You better change what comes out your speaker 
 Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah 
 What is it? 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 You wanna see a dead body? 
 Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party 
 Troubles on my mind 
 I still smell crime, my little brother crying 
 Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis either that 
 Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it 
 Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that 
 This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax 
 Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in 
 When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten 
 And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention 
 And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions 
 My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half 
 Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath 
 Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose 
 Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold 
 I said "Daddy, one day I'mma get you right with thirty-six zips 
 One thousand grams of cocaine then your name will be rich 
 Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior 
 Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter" 
 He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?" 
 I said,"Pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect" 
 He said, "Well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense" 
 Go figure, mothafucka, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga 
 Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga) 
 I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend 
 Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it

 You better change what comes out your speaker 
 You better change 
 You better change what comes out your speaker 
 They must be on the dick of who?
