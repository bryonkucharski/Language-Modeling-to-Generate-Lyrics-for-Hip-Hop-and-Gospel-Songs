They thought I lay dead, I was playing possom 
 Spot me everywhere with the 8 like Kate Goslin 
 Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing 
 Now they hide their head like an ostrich 
 Optimus Prime and that gull wing feeling like I transform 
 Niggas still hands on, whip it like a sandstorm 
 Had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem 
 Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems 
 Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through 
 Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past 
 Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault 
 You niggas is soft so on that pillow's where you talk 
 Can't find it in them d-list actresses on mattresses 
 Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them 
 Don't you know that it's money over bitches 
 Bitches love money, I granting them three wishes, Push 
 Shout out my nigga Don C, aka Givenchy Don C 
 Ya ain't even know that you got an aka did you? 
 Always in that fly shit, Mike Dean what up? Brendan 
 Or should I say international Brendan? Marcus Paul? Refresh, yeah 
 The fear of Gods in these motherfuckers 
 You can act like don't hear this shit man 
 Niggas ain't fucking with me man, no games, yeah
