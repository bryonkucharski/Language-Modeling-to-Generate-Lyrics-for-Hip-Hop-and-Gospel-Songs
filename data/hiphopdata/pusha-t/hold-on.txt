I sold more dope than I sold records 
 You niggas sold records, never sold dope 
 So I ain't hearing none of that street shit 
 'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap 
 Got rich selling hope to the hopeless 
 But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives 
 I motivate to put my niggas into motors 
 No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs 
 Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror 
 We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer 
 Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer 
 Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer 
 The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze 
 Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas 
 We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga 
 Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous 
 Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin 
 They tipping the scale for these crackers to win 
 No reading, no writing, made us savage of men 
 They praying for jail but I mastered the pen 
 Descended from kings, we at it again 
 Just hand me the crown, I'm active again 
 Everything that it seems, hear my passion again 
 Was never my dream, the immaculate win 
 Rick Ross: 
 I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts 
 Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought 
 Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera 
 Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer 
 Young king bury me inside a glass casket 
 Windex wipe me down for the life after 
 Crack dealer living like a hoop star 
 Black marble, white walls in my new spot 
 Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly 
 Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac 
 So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level 
 We were born to be kings, only major league teams 
 Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth 
 Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself 
 God body and mind, food for the soul 
 When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows 
 Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes 
 If you slip and you fall, I got you my nigga, hold on 
 If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on 
 By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long 
 I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted 
 Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it 
 Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home 
 Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home 
 Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes 
 If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on 
 By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 Pusha T and Rick Ross: 
 I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 (I got you, my nigga, hold on) 
 If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on 
 By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 Rick Ross: 
 I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 I got you, my nigga, hold on 
 I got you, my nigga, hold on
