Easy money 
 It's about to be a surgical summer 
 Chop the tops off the coupes 
 The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho 
 The Spider joint 
 And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right? 
 Watch the body drop 
 Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside 
 Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride 
 Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive 
 The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait 
 Let's examine why 
 Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies 
 I'll start it at the home front-"I'm on One" 
 Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one 
 You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing 
 Your father walked away at five-hell of a dad thing 
 Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake 
 How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place? 
 Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him 
 A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him 
 Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough 
 Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough 
 Since you name-dropped my fiancée 
 Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé 
 Sophie knows better as your baby mother 
 Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her 
 A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap 
 We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts 
 You are hiding a child, let that boy come home 
 Deadbeat motherfucker playin' border patrol, ooh 
 Adonis is your son 
 And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real 
 Love that baby, respect that girl 
 Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh! 
 How dare you put Ye in my verses? 
 I'm selfish, I want all of the curses 
 I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses 
 If we all go to Hell it'll be worth it 
 Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note 
 The only ones I chase are two ghosts 
 Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me 
 OVO 40, hunched over like he 80-tick, tick, tick 
 How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick 
 I got the devil flow, nigga-six-six-six 
 Surgical summer with it-snip, snip, snip 
 And you don't really want it with him 
 Surgical Summer, Volume 1 
 We gon' take this slow 
 We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer 
 Yeah, DAYTONA 
 Album of the motherfuckin' year 
 And you talkin' 'bout you upset 
 Hahahahaha 
 Well, I wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay? 
 You show me that 
 Push!
