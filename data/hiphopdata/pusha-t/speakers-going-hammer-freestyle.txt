I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and 
 Wave to my neighbors like what's up? 
 And tatted up, get bang in my truck 
 Everybody in my city show me love 
 Because I have the speakers going hammer 
 (The dough boy version though, yeah) 
 Back up in this bitch niggas free to go 
 It was all good just a key ago 
 Price for the 20 all I need to know 
 Still moving snow like it's 3 below 
 Detroit's hard, while I Cape Cod 
 You niggas Lil B's to the Based God 
 I been cooking, is you mistooken? 
 Chi town plug got the city jukin' 
 Givenchy motorcycle leathers 
 Mad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered 
 Small circle bad bitches all think they clever 
 The mixed ones whole shape and recycle better 
 Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em 
 She oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em 
 Can't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em 
 Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em 
 I wake up, early in the morning 'rouAnnotatend the crack of dawn and 
 Wave to my neighbors like what's up? 
 And tatted up, get bang in my truck 
 Everybody in my city show me love 
 Because I have the speakers going hammer 
 (The dough boy version though, yeah) 
 So Liv 
 I picks her up, right? 
 She tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier 
 This guy had a Range Rover just like you 
 I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover 
 This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money 
 You must be out your fucking mind 
 See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long 
 You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga 
 Get it right
