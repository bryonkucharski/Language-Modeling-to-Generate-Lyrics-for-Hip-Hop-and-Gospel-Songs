Lyrically I'm, untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600 
 Untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600 
 Yuugh, I drops every blue moon 
 To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube 
 I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge 
 In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge 
 Legend has it, the wrist is magic 
 The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa 
 Ignore most requests for the feature 
 Unless it's getting played on the beach in Ibiza 
 While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha 
 Can't you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha 
 I'm aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals? 
 And rap niggas broke like them, they're mere hopeful 
 Still wishing on a star 
 The last one to find out that Baby own the cars 
 The final trilogy of Jaws 
 The grills like, interior gauze 
 It feels like, still white 
 Matching Missoni looks African on me 
 They tryin' pin the trafficking on me like Mano and Tony 
 My thoughts spilling over 
 The soft ceiling's open, I Cross-Fit the coca 
 Yuugh! It's a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox 
 Half a million paralleled and ain't nothin' rented 
 Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit 
 It rides a little better in the cockpit 
 Untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600 
 Untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600 
 Mu told me to switch styles 
 He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial 
 He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don't bounce 
 Adidas gave me a million and that don't bounce 
 The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced 
 A quarter million a year and that don't bounce 
 I'm in the score of these movies, I'm losing count 
 Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce 
 My breakdown game bought me '8 Mile' fame 
 Selling Eminem to him and 'em 
 White to the Blacks I'm a villain in 
 The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem 
 Let's talk about it gentlemen 
 My barcode is Netflix "Narcos" 
 Part on the side of my 'fro like I'm Pablo 
 No hablo, I sell blow 
 Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho 
 Yuugh, let's take the scenic route 
 I could show you the strange fruit 
 It's looking like Beirut 
 They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2 
 These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use 
 Of every Spanish name I done ran across 
 No matter what the weight, I done ran it off 
 I'm walking on water, I took the sandals off 
 Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push 
 Untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600 
 Untouchable, uncrushable 
 Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
