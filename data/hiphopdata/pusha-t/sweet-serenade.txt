Chris Brown: 
 Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life 
 Did everything you could to be here for the night 
 Man it feels good, everything is right 
 Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights 
 My whole team winning, no vision on quitting 
 I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't 
 Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living 
 I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it 
 Pusha T: 
 Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair 
 Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair 
 Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here 
 Raised round killers, we just happy to be here 
 Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues 
 While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge 
 That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry 
 Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by 
 The queen pin to the king pin redeems him 
 The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins 
 Yuugh, this the life that we made 
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

 Pusha T: 
 Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs 
 Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze 
 Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze 
 Triple doubles, two hoes and check please, woo 
 They love me on my Ric Flair shit, woo 
 In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch, woo 
 Who are you to be compared with? Woo 
 Ain't no niggas that you bled with 
 Court cases ran base and road aces 
 Lick shots or left bodies with no traces 
 Yuugh, this the life that we made 
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

 Pusha T: 
 Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me 
 The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me 
 Yeah, the competition's all but died to me 
 Raah, I make these mothafuckas hide from me 
 The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold 
 You just posing for them pics so you can upload 
 Yuugh, this the life that we made 
 Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga
