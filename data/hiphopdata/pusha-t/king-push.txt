This is my time, this is my hour 
 This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power 
 If it's my reign, then it's my shower 
 This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours 
 Dope boys, block bleeders 
 Gold diggers don't stop either 
 Motivation is misguided if you hit the mark, then it's not needed 
 Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along 
 Call me daddy from a complex 'cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom 
 No excuses, no regard 
 Step on the brick like a promenade 
 Twenty thousand on calling cards 
 And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar 
 But I'm King Push, this king push 
 I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas 
 I don't sing hooks 
 Fuck nigga, with the sly talk 
 Miss me, with all the pie talk 
 When them lights on you and them letters big 
 You point us out just like an eye-chart 
 But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk 
 For eleven years, we seen better years 
 We was sellin' birds over the time port 
 My first grammy was my first brick 
 Red carpet, every bad bitch 
 More BMF than billboard 
 I got a label deal under my mattress 
 'Cause I'm King Push, still king push 
 I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas 
 I don't sing hooks 
 Vultures to my culture 
 Exploit the struggle, insult ya 
 They name dropping 'bout caine copping 
 But never been a foot soldier 
 Let's have another look, just get a little closer 
 Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha 
 In a cranberry 'Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster 
 Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash 
 Difference between me and Hova 
 But I'm King Push, this king push 
 I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas 
 I don't sing hooks
