I let you into my diary to admire me 
 The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me 
 The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy 
 I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese 
 The tug of war opens the door, entrada 
 Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata 
 And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga 
 One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold potter 
 Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who 
 Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom 
 And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome 
 But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em 
 Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em 
 Trying snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune 
 Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen 
 Rick Flair with the flame, I'm mother fucking Gorgeous, woah 
 As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith 
 Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with 
 Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss 
 But they devil red, tires double tread 
 I post and parks up. that gets me double head 
 Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head 
 The bright lights blind look at what the devil did 
 She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 I'm the only one left and the memories fading so 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 They'll do everything in their power 
 Stomp me the stove when you rising like flour 
 Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower 
 It's 911 you on your 25th hour 
 Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers 
 How the tide turns when the pupils now the teacher 
 The game can't go by just followin the leaders 
 You gotta be better than the ones who precede yah 
 Upgrade them 
 Upstage them 
 Change the whole body shape and just update them 
 Pagans 
 Reagan era I ran contraband 
 Money caused turf wars through the promised land 
 First time being rich could be a common man 
 The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams 
 We just took what we needed and we built on it 
 Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it 
 She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 I'm the only one left and the memories fading so 
 I write this alone in Vegas 
 Fear of God niggas 
 Got me feelin' like Pac 
 This the realest shit I ever wrote 
 Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners 
 Come back home straight to the money getters 
 About $14, 000 dollars worth in 20s 
 Brown paper bag money 
 Yeah, I call that a good weekend 
 Re-up gang forever 
 Long live the king coming soon 
 Malice my brother I love you 
 Liva-Don, till the end nigga
