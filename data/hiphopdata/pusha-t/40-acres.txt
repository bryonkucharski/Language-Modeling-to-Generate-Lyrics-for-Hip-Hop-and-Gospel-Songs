(Hook: The-Dream) 
 Trouble world, trouble child 
 Trouble times destroyed my smile 
 No change of heart, no change of mind 
 You can take what's yours 
 But you gon' leave what's mine 
 I'd rather die, than go home 
 I'd rather die, than go home 
 And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres 
 (Verse 1: Pusha T) 
 Unpolished, unapologetic 
 This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit 
 You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid 
 We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits 
 Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish 
 Money is universal, that's the only language 
 The dream ain't die, only some real niggas 
 We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us 
 Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us 
 I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas 
 My better half chose the better path, applaude him 
 Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him 
 I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom 
 The California top just falls back like autumn 
 And they say I'm on the verge of winning 
 I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning 
 Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard 
 It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards 
 Cause stand up niggas don't lay on no floors 
 Much rather burns us, ashes to ashes 
 Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses 
 We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic 
 Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses 
 Push... 
 (Verse 2: Pusha T) 
 Unpolished, unapologetic 
 Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort 
 My nonchalant attitude is always fuck it 
 35 years of marriage and my momma left it 
 You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him 
 The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him 
 (Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch 
 You know this money grew your hair out 
 All that shit I bought you wear out 
 Rich, and I'm the only one I care about 
 Place none above me, God don't like ugly 
 Hate me or love me, only he can judge me 
 (Verse 3: Pusha T) 
 Unpolished, unapologetic 
 Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend 
 School of hard knock, I attended 
 Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended 
 I was a goner, punished by karma 
 Called him tar baby now he's transcending genres 
 The 911 king with the ass shots 
 A toothless crackhead was the mascot 
 The owner of the key to that padlock 
 I'm Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot 
 I need all mine, reparations 
 We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
