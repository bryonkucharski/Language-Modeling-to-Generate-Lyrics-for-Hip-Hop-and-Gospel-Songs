They call him a crack dealer, I am like Warhol 
 A nigga paint a picture of a bullet for all y'all 
 Now crawl for him 
 My sophomore jinx is more minks 
 But only for my mother she'll use 'em as couch covers 
 You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends 
 If y'all can't swim in the deep end then watch nigga 
 Woo! 80,000 on this watch niggas 
 Yuugh! And I ain't never had to watch nigga 
 Rich or wealthy, pick your poison 
 I think I paid for one too many abortions 
 Another Celine, it's like a routine 
 It's like Ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans 
 Her new body's in my new body 
 Make her in an hourglass that's my new hobby 
 Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million 
 Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin' 
 Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though 
 When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole 
 The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO 
 The last cocaine superhero 
 I got the cape on, to cover kilos 
 The villain wins, the evolution of Nino 
 Goddamn Batman holy toledo 
 Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though 
 The Robb Report of the snort 
 Kings hold court 
 Lawyers get bought 
 Palms get greased when them cases get fought 
 No felony what the fuck is you tellin' me 
 Reduced to simple assault 
 It cost to keep it hush-hush 
 It was just us 
 Ended up sellin' my Bat Mobile 
 The crash don't kill 
 It's how you survives it 
 Rebound on niggas, I nine live'd it 
 Couldn't miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun 
 Bitches ain't respecting niggas not in full bloom 
 So the neck is full moon 
 I'm living a lie, she live for this life 
 And loving the Alaia pumps 
 Loving the rush, I'm living "The Wire" Uh 
 Drugs and this rap is really "Empire" 
 Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million 
 Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin' ya 
 Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though 
 When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole 
 The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO 
 The last cocaine superhero 
 I got the cape on, to cover kilos 
 The villain wins, the evolution of Nino 
 Goddamn Batman holy toledo 
 Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though 
 Ten toes deep in the trap, nigga I'm good here 
 Feelin' like Tony reading words on the Goodyear 
 Big said, "Only the FEDs I should fear" 
 So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there 
 Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene 
 Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring 
 Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona 
 It's homicide when I slide up on ya 
 Reporting live from the project benches 
 Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes 
 Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges 
 Clientele look like the "Thriller" vid in 3D lenses 
 COD, niggas never had to front me jawns 
 I'm weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on 
 I'm Nino Brown in the projects 
 Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex 
 Get rich or die tryin' is my mindset 
 And spend it all until I'm swallowing dirt 
 'Cause I ain't never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse 
 I ain't never see a dead man taking the stand 
 I ain't never see a nigga swallow a bullet 
 And live to talk about it 
 'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it 
 You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it 
 Nigga shit, that's how I lost three million 
 Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin' ya
