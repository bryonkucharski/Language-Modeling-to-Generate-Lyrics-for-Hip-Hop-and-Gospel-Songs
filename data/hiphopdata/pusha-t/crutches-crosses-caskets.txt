 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 All I see is victims 
 My young niggas sic' 'em 
 I don't get 'em 
 I just get back their jewelry if I'm fuckin' with 'em 
 Your man crush Mondays be owin' niggas 
 My skin is triple black, I'm the omen 
 You can't kill a God like the Romans, uh 
 Take my time to craft shit 
 'Cause I don't like back and forths with Puff about rap shit 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 All I see is victims 
 Rappers is victimized at an all-time high 
 But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly 
 I'm Yasiel Puig, I'm in another league 
 I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed 
 In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars 
 Is there shame when a platinum rapper's mother lives in squalor? 
 Mildred's in the Bahamas for the month 
 She's probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch 
 Swordfish, my reality is more fish 
 Banana clips for all you Curious Georges 
 Old niggas slapping young niggas 
 Ha Imagine that, where you from nigga? 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 All I see is death by the masses 
 The only asterisk is the change of address 
 My infinity pool as long as Magic's 
 Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows 
 The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo 
 The silhouette 
 The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop 
 The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes 
 It's more than this drug money, I love money 
 I speak to your soul and that's above money 
 This the ministry of street energy 
 The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries 
 Woo I'm the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard 
 To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 All I see is victims 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 Crutches, crosses, caskets 
 All I see is victims
