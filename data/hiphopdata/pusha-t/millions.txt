You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right? 
 We get that money 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet

 This that shit that y'all wanted 
 This shit cook up hard, don't it? 
 Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it 
 But this shit sound like God don't it? 
 Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga 
 Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga 
 Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise 
 I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoe box 
 Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox 
 This big face is in Blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks 
 I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin' 
 Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling 
 And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions 
 Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah! 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners 
 Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive 
 Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit 
 I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas 
 Used to fiddle my finger till I found me a fortune 
 Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning 
 Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my A Capella 
 Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason 
 Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb 
 Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more 
 I got this I got that, I got that I got this 
 Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 This that shit y'all ask for 
 Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor 
 Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force 
 Fast forward--oops! They say they wanna see proof 
 My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes 
 How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes 
 How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes 
 Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise 
 Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline 
 I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin' 
 Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling 
 Got the razor on the counter, Arm and Hammer in the kitchen 
 Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Millions millions in the ceiling 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 Choppas choppas in the closet 
 This that shit that y'all wanted 
 This shit sound like God don't it 
 This that shit that y'all wanted 
 This shit sound like God don't it 
 This that shit that y'all wanted 
 This shit sound like God don't it
