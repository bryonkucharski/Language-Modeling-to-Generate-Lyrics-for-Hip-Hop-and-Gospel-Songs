 I'm only in the company of Kings 
 I made a power move and it's everything it seems 
 Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dream 
 Standing on the shoulders of 20,000 fiends 
 Everytime a n-gga wanna try and turn a profit 
 Folks rush in, 3 letters try and stop it 
 F-b-i-r-s-d-e-a (fbi, irs, dea) 
 One letter short but still muthaf-ck the DA. 
 We play by the rules as they try and crack the code 
 Combination locks to the kilo's that I hold 
 Leopard print Louboutin's, prowlin' the concrete 
 Roller balls come alive just like Jumanji 
 You know where to find me 
 Greenhouse a circle of top whores 
 Mandarin, gears of war, any of them top floors 
 35 large took you right out the top draw 
 Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw 
 (Pharrell) 
 It's like rain, spraying on you roaches 
 The AK is an animal, it is ferocious 
 A n-gga wanna sing but he is the dopest 
 Watch that n-gga disappear, hocus pocus 
 Ring, ring the n-gga wanna sing 
 Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean 
 Ring, ring the n-gga wanna sing 
 Unless he is an insomniac, he dying to dream 
 (50 Cent) 
 You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus 
 Never bothered me, strong arm robbery 
 I went from countin' Jelly donuts to taking the most 
 From my high school sweetheart to f-cking with hoes 
 Look I'm all grown up and I dun blown up 
 N-gga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same 
 I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the ruger 
 You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya 
 I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood 
 Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes 
 I'm bad news, you n-ggas know the verdict, I'm filthy 
 Drop Phantom is milky 
 White on white, 24 inch blades of steel 
 Red eye smoking that bomb shit 
 N-ggas surprised, 50 back on fire 
 50 back running round this bitch strapped 
 Hitman for hire 
 (Pusha T) 
 I sit with the liars, ducktape and tyres 
 Been lost their soul 
 They just waiting on the fire 
 Innocent faces with a shit load of prior's 
 Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGuyvers 
 Deep sea dive for the fishscale 
 Tryna find a better price, man that ship sale 
 Take a record head back if that shit fail 
 Drop weight like an anchor than you set sail 
 Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over 
 Engine double scream when I turn the key over 
 Pirelli's on the street rolling like a steam roller 
 Bitche's double team when I have my sleep over's 
 Yeah, Re-Up gang with the G-Unit 
 This is Taylor made drug dealer fiend music 
 Test it on ya tongue or watch a fiend do it 
 I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it
