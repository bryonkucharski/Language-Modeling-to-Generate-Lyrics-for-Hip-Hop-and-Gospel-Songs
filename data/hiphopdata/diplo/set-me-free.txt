One, two, three 
 Stone cold, when I look up to the sky, baby 
 I feel freedom, and it's all gold 
 Like a sun up in the sky 
 That's the feeling 
 Slingshot, boomerang, set me free 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Slingshot, boomerang, set me free 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 We're dipping in neon lights 
 We're living this dream tonight 
 We're riding this wild young life 
 And we don't have to try, try, try 
 Try, try, try 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up 
 Wind it, wind it, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Stone cold, when I look up to the sky, baby 
 I feel freedom, and it's all gold 
 Like a sun up in the sky 
 That's the feeling 
 Slingshot, boomerang, set me free 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Slingshot, boomerang, set me free 
 Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three 
 Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up 
 Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up 
 Wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it... 
 Wind it up, one, two, three 
 (One, two three)
