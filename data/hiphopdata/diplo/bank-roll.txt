 Say she wanna do it for a bankroll 
 Pull up to the trap at the back door 
 Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more 
 Baby just do it for a bankroll 
 Say she wanna do it for a bankroll 
 Pull up to the trap at the back door 
 Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more 
 Baby just do it for a bankroll 
 Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll 
 Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll 
 Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold 
 I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll 
 Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll

 Rich Chigga 
 Yeah, uh 
 Bankroll city pay slow 
 Everybody on the payroll under control 
 Every twenty minutes change clothes 
 Shout out my boy Post only that 
 You wanna say go if you say so, uh 
 Run up in the scene in my tight jean shorts 
 Looking like a pimp but I got one hoe 
 Try to shut me up and I say hell no 
 Never switching up, only switch up flows 
 Bling blau, honey on the carousel 
 She get looking at me now 
 And she hit me when in town 
 She thirsty like she in a drought 
 Does she want to fuck no doubt 
 Living life like a king 
 I ain't even got a crown, ay 
 Hundred bands, hundred bands 
 Hold up bitch I got hundred thousand in my pillow case 
 You can try me run it with the Nike 
 But you'll never do it in my pace 
 Hundred racks, hundred racks 
 Hold up hoe, this is my first time in the States 
 My aura so bright but my bars so dark 
 You would think you wanna sack up face
