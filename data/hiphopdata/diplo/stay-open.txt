Even in the darkest hour 
 You don't have to search so hard 
 You're the one that holds the power 
 Now's the time to play your part 
 If you could see your true colors, you wouldn't have to try so hard 
 Hiding under all these covers, we all work the way we are 
 It's the same with me and you and everybody 
 Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party 
 So many doors, so many closed to us 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open 
 Pass down the line, standing outside the club 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open for you 
 Baby, I can read the stars 
 And I see how they shine for you 
 Don't give yourself up in the darkness 
 So many better things to do 
 Wish you could see your true colors 
 Don't be afraid to play your cards 
 The skies over you should follow 
 We all work the way we are 
 It's the same with me and you and everybody 
 Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party 
 So many doors, so many closed to us 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open 
 Pass down the line, standing outside the club 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open for you 
 You know, you know 
 Oh, you know, you know 
 Open for you 
 It's the same with me and you and everybody 
 Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party 
 It's the same with me and you and everybody 
 Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party 
 So many doors, so many closed to us 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open 
 Pass down the line, standing outside the club 
 Oh, baby, my heart's open 
 You know that I stay open for you
