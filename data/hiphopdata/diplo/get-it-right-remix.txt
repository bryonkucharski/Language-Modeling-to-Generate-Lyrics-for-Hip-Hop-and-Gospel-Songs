I am walking down that road 
 Where did all the flowers go? 
 They say we're supposed to grow 
 Learning from the highs and low 
 All eyes lying on me, oh 
 Begging me to play the role 
 'Cause I'm gonna get it right, I'm gonna get it right 
 They can try to hold me down, but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 When the sky is filled with smoke and fire 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 All I want is something better in the purple light 
 They can try to hold me down, but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 Switchin' lanes, four doors feelin' like Jeezy 
 Undercover sweater, Balmain, boots Yeezy 
 Summer feelin' winter, feelin' rappin' like I'm Weezy 
 Lord forgive me, ain't no prayin' when it hit the fan, Jesus 
 Cancun chillin' by the pool, I can feel it 
 Almost hit my goal but I still hit loose women 
 Deuces up, ain't nobody reaching you, baby 
 Ain't nobody stoppin' you, baby, right 
 You try to hold me down, but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 When the sky is filled with smoke and fire 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 All I want is something better in the purple light 
 They can try to hold me down, but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right
