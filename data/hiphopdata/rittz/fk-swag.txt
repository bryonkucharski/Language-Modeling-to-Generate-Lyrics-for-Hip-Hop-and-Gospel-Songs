 Fuck swag, Swag 
 15's in the back of the Dodge 
 Out the garage 
 And my homies riding with me and they better recharge 
 I talk about the clientele and tell 'em they won't be off 
 I'm off Atlanta representers and we're given the yonk 
 And be better this cars and the swap in the squad 
 They think they swagging but they lame as fuck we laugh at these boys 
 Uncontrollably like we just hit the gravity bong 
 Half of these rappers too wack to be even rapping and all 
 Trying to dress up like a weirdo hoping that somebody notice 'em 
 Make me wanna strike and knock 'em down like they a bowling pin 
 Maybe I'm just old and out of touch, attitude is fuck it 
 Cause If you don't like me go and watch some Nickelodeon, you lil motherfucker 
 I'm over and I stick 'em up they say they're YOLO go and then provoking 
 And it's hard time for me to tell the difference between a rapper and a singer 
 Of a rock and roll band I don't think this shit is appropriate 
 Way too many rappers wanna look like Lenny Kravitz 
 Personally I think these pussies get too many passes 
 Thrift store shopping with the shit your rocking 
 Looks lame and your music ain't neat the shit is average 
 And if that will make you matters even better 
 I don't sweat on people talking shit about the way I look every day 
 Long hair don't care, red pair of Air Jordans 
 And I wear all black, no hook

 All these rappers wanna bite like they don't know how to write 
 They constantly freestyle and think its tight 
 Every time they say a line with a metaphor in it 
 They wanna pause or laugh or ad-lib 
 Fake swag they just copy who they like 
 Trying to sound like Gucci or Future or Tunechi 
 These dudes need a lesson before they get behind the mic 
 Ain't nobody buying your records they buying into hype 
 They was feeling me until they see I'm white 
 Now they like "man he raps too fast" 
 What you slow homie? You handicapped? 
 What you need a walker, a hearing aid, or a fanny pack 
 What you unhappy the champ is back 
 The Manny Pac of the rap game that can't relax 
 I'm bout to raise the bar and they can't adapt, the cameras flash 
 'Cause they see a star when I walk in the room 
 North side, Atlanta rap, I bet you wanna walk in my shoes 
 It's funny that I'm hot 
 Last year I was just cool when you 
 You was too official 
 Where the shoe that fits you 
 Tied yo' dick in skinny jeans, take your Louis belt and whip you 
 The clientele strip you of your jewellery, would take a pic 
 Post the shit on Instagram now suck a dick 
 You bitch, be looking real dumb 
 Still slum, I don't pleasant hear 'em 
 Bumping Big K.R.I.T. and Yelawolf I don't feel punk 
 Rappers with no skills come on witness me I kill them 
 You fucking with me I'm the real one
