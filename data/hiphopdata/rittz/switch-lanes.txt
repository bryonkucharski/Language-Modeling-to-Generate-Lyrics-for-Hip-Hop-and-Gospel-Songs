I pull that Crown up outta that purple bag 
 Polo boots with my shirt to match 
 Pimpin' I'm leanin' my seat further back 
 Hit the gas in my bird then smash up 85 North we turnin' heads 
 Star status, arm tatted 
 Out the window dudes lookin' hard at us 
 'Cause they girlfriend wanna jump in they don't wanna fuck me man 
 These hoes got a car fetish 
 But lets roll (roll roll roll) 
 Hit the pedal and lets ride 
 So much smoke pourin' out the window lookin' like the leather's on fire 
 When I be drivin' in the car 
 Kicker in the back 
 Shotty in the front 
 Windows pitch black 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 When I be drivin' in the car 
 Session in the back 
 Hemi in the front so I ain't worried bout' that 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Spin through GA like I'm ridin' in a General Lee 
 I re-revvin' up the engine when I'm in the street 
 My kickers beat you thought that a parade was coming 
 You probably thought that someone threw a grenade or something 
 You trynna' say you wasn't impressed please save it woman 
 Got you all up in the seat getting naked wantin' to make out 
 But you better not get no make-up on em' 
 These car jackers wanna follow me then take it from me 
 I got some heat up under my seat waitin' on us 
 So why your face still funny homie you jealous of me 
 'Cause I pull up on the scene so elegantly 
 Me and Mike P. together and we killin' the beat 
 We might have seen a little fame but we still in the street 
 From the the A all the way to the D 
 Throw the peace to the haters a hey when I see all the ladies come wavin' at me 
 When I be drivin' in the car 
 Kicker in the back 
 Shotty in the front 
 Windows pitch black 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 When I be drivin' in the car 
 Session in the back 
 Hemi in the front so I ain't worried bout' that 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 I ain't goin' home 
 I just need that tick tick 
 Followed by that, 
 And that could get me high 
 Can you feel me? 
 See I been wonderin' why 
 The only time I'm still me 
 Is, when I be drivin' in the car 
 Kicker in the back 
 Shotty in the front 
 Windows pitch black 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 When I be drivin' in the car 
 Session in the back 
 Hemi in the front so I ain't worried bout' that 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la) 
 Switch lanes (la la la la la)
