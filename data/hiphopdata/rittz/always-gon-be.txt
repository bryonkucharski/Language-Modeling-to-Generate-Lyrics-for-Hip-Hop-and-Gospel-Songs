Cameras flashing 
 Spot lights getting high on me like 
 Turn this antenna rashes 
 And you cannot match it 
 I'ma blew up 
 And call it a competition never can to ashes 
 Let us trend the fashion new clothes a plus 
 Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up 
 You talk about me when I was broke and 
 He gave me the hope I lost 
 And now I'm gone on the road so much 
 And now you only bluff 
 I just wish we could touch to the phone but just 
 Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us 
 And when the chuckle up 
 I might close enough to finally buy us a car 
 With her own apartment he embark a dream, 
 On stage in saw to rin 
 A shy town thinking that you'll get drunk and screams 
 I'ma feel like a sailor of a sicker submarine 
 Tryin' to keep where the raw hits above the water 
 I know you want kids but we live with your mom 
 How the fuck am I supposed to become a father 
 When I'm spending hundred dollars on studio time 
 But you ain't ever gave a fuck about bread 
 I'ma give you the life you deserve one day 
 While you crying all on our bed 
 I'm on the bus and the bunk 
 Having dreams barbeque and then it come for the darker one 
 Been gone so long it feels weird talking on the phone 
 I freaking knew it I be coming home 
 Fuck what you my back on 
 When I'm at home with you it's like I'm really in my comfort zone 
 If I was a miles away looking at the sky and pray 
 Until God you ain't all alone 
 'Cause I've been thinking about you all day 
 And I've been walking down this hallway 
 And now you love to see so far away 
 But maybe that's the way it's always gon' be 
 And every day my heart aches 
 I'm just sitting in this dark place 
 And now you love to see so far away 
 But maybe that's the way it's always gon' be 
 Fights on Facebook 
 All you see these pics they took with me 
 You can't believe the hype 
 Every night we fight about girls you see 
 On the internet, thinking I'm cheating 
 And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me 
 You play gotta do music though 
 Think I'm all late tripping getting groupie love 
 Crying to me is unnecessary 
 Losing you is the last thing I want 
 If only you could trust, then I'd miss you as much as you miss me 
 And I wish we could be on the house together 
 But we ain't got no cheddar 
 No kind of crib that history can we deserve better 
 Can't accept the misery I know you had a hard life 
 And it's harder when I'm gone 
 And I promise one day shit will make sense 
 It will be alright 
 I send flappers to you chop today 
 I put earphones on and I played our song 
 No I mean the bicycles I just got done 
 Sorry that you made a window blonde 
 So many nights when we get up on each other 
 Really fighting 'cause I can't come home 
 Got a whole tear room just to face time with you tonight 
 Don't put make up on 
 Because your face just looks so beautiful 
 And I promise that I'm always gonna be true to you 
 So many people traveling in pursue of true love 
 But never get the feeling that I do from you 
 So many human beings tryin' live their whole life with their soul mate 
 But I found mine 
 While you laid up in the house crying 
 We both been counting on time 
 'Cause I've been thinking about you all day 
 And I've been walking down this hallway 
 And now you love to see so far away 
 But maybe that's the way it's always gon' be 
 And every day my heart aches 
 I'm just sitting in this dark place 
 And now you love to see so far away 
 But maybe that's the way it's always gon' be
