Let me tell you something right now 
 Don't you ever try to call me back 
 You understand me? 
 I'm gonna say this right now for the record 
 I'm 100 percent on my mom's life 
 On my sister's life, on your life 
 I never ever ever caught a fucking girl 
 Never, some pigs gave me a fucking number 
 With a metal cast to it 
 I took it and I put it to the table 
 I don't know who the fuck called that bitch 
 But it's sure as fuck wasn't me 
 I told you never ever ever ever ever try to touch my fucking clothes 
 And realize that I'm the only only fucking reason you have any structure in your life 
 Do you fucking understand me? 
 I will fucking bury you 
 I will fucking kill you 
 I will fucking push you under the fucking ground 
 Do you fucking understand me? 
 You little motherfucker 
 I'm out here tryin' to make a living for the both of us 
 You fucking ungrateful, you fucking asshole 
 I'm out here tryin' to make a living for us 
 And all you give a fuck about is some bitches 
 And Facebook, stay the fuck off of Facebook 
 Do you understand me? 
 I am fucking sick, all day long I was forced trying to talk to you 
 I will fucking bury you 
 Do you fucking understand me? 
 You put my fucking clothes back you son of a bitch
