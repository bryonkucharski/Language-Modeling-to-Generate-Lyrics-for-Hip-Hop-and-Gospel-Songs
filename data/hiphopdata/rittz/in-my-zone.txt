Mike Posner: 
 I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
 I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along 
 All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't 
 'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
 In my zone 
 In my zone 
 In my zone 
 When I'm in my, when I'm in my 
 In my zone 
 Rittz: 
 In my old school bumpin' that "Kiss of Life" beneath the city lights 
 Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed 
 Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight 
 This dream difficult for me to visualize 
 And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky 
 But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now 
 On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured 
 But now the storms finally calming down 
 Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining 
 My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds 
 I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind 
 Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin' 
 In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight 
 I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant 
 Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling 
 I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling 
 Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe 
 You can say that you played in the major league 
 Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave 
 I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee 
 I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf 
 'Cause what awaits for me is unknown 
 So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight 
 Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone 
 This ain't no ordinary love 
 I was sick of being poor and said "enough" 
 Right up 85 North and there I was 
 Working, breaking down doors and barriers 
 Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support 
 Spread the word cause the more, the merrier 
 Nobody blowing out the torch I carry 
 I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge 
 All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde 
 And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style 
 Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts 
 Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down 
 In case you wanna come and duke it out 
 If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce 
 And we just blew an ounce 
 My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge 
 I'm blowing up like a bazooka round 
 I got booed and bowed but stayed positive 
 Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in 
 I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this 
 And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist 
 I got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque 
 And took a shot of whiskey to the dome 
 Made a toast to the homies that are gone 
 Two for the fans and the love they shown, I'm in my... zone 
 B.o.B: 
 My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor 
 I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister 
 Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em 
 Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer 
 I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer 
 Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her 
 I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta 
 The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers 
 A practitioner, practice until I master it 
 Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate 
 Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate 
 You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate 
 Immaculate vernacular, Batmobile look like Dracula 
 Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up 
 You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm 
 I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it
