Don't you run away (hol' up) 
 I caught you on a wave (yeah) 
 I'm not tryna follow the blind 
 And you not tryna be left behind 
 It takes more than two shots (ooh) 
 To wipe my memory clean 
 And I was bustin' in blocks 
 Just to hear you sing (oh, oh, oh, girl) 
 Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime 
 I'm just too lit for white wine (yeah) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime 
 I'm just too lit for red wine (lit) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah (uh huh) 
 You wanted to go down in this place 
 This good gas has me in a good space 
 Between the money and the women 
 I wake up still in a daze 
 Daze, daze 
 No roleplay 
 Can't roleplay 
 Oh, yeah 
 Enjoy your trip 
 Just be you and I'll be all that I can be 
 This love got you borderline crazy 
 I crashed on your shore, oh 
 And now let's move forward
