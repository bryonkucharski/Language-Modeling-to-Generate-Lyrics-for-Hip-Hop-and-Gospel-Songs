Winter's over, let the sun in 
 Wife-beater on me, let's pour the rum 
 Wife-beater on me, I'll take you on 
 I'm the closest and you're shinin' like a summer solstice 
 Everyone's tryna figure you out 
 On the patio and we're just strung out 
 And I know what you're into 
 Fortune tellers couldn't tell you what to do 
 If I seem like I'm bad news 
 Then hide from me, girl 
 I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria 
 I'm fuckin' takin' you serious 
 Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl) 
 In love, no typical love 
 I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run 
 Tan Jeep out front with the Rollie on 
 Nine deep and we've been away from home too long 
 I'ma make your bitch choose 
 Five liters in the cooler 
 Five liters in the cooler 
 You can pose with your poodle 
 Drive fast in your new car 
 Drive fast in your new car 
 I'ma give you that bling 
 Kiss the big face that I love dearly 
 That nigga ain't near as cool as me 
 Hate with all your might, I'm coolin', b 
 And I'm sure you've never had this experience before 
 Helicopter on the roof, let's soar 
 And I'm out on the west like Schwartz 
 Niggas fuckin' up the golf course 
 So that's what rich niggas are doin' these days 
 Yeah we get money like 10, 12 ways 
 And on a restless night 
 She gon' take me where I need to go 
 In the backseat of the Maybach, where we used to get on 
 And you want real love 
 One that'll make you feel like you just woke up 
 I think you better hide from me, girl 
 I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria 
 I'm fuckin' takin' you serious 
 Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl) 
 In love, no typical love 
 I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run
