It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah) 
 It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah) 
 I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah) 
 'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh) 
 I can feel the weight of what you say (ooh, ooh) 
 I had explanations for days (ooh, ooh) 
 Don't think you're the only one that's sane 
 It seems like we're not on the same page 
 All I do is think when I'm away (when I'm away) 
 Colors burst and all I see are shapes (hey!) 
 Sun goes away and that's when I call your name (your name) 
 She's here for good, and I'm here to stay 
 It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)

 She said the E was for missin' my embrace (yeah, oh-oh) 
 So yeah, I feel so out of place (woo, oh yeah) 
 I was meant to love and protect you 
 You know what's on my mind, but not what's in my heart 
 Give me someone to connect to (to) 
 Because these drinks are hitting me a little hard 
 It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah) 
 It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)

 'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh, ooh) 
 Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
