What's in these drinks I spilled? 
 Baby, don't tell me no lie 
 I don't have time for this 
 Drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out 
 What's in this cup for real? (For real?) 
 What's in this cup for real? (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 Was this chick for real? (For real?) Was this bitch for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 What's in your heart, for real? (For real?) 
 What's in your heart, for real? (For real?) (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real?) 
 What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real) 
 (What's in your) 
 I'm gonna pass this time I wouldn't want you to find (find) 
 I left the house last night 'cause there was too many vibes (too many vibes) 
 Drivin' me while she wild, I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come be near (wanna come near) 
 Drivin' me while I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come near (come near) 
 But my eyes criss and cross and I'm already gone and it's not hard to see (to see) 
 Plus that over-the-counter was put to good use, yeah, that's just what I did 
 I could tell she ready when she came up out her shirt and she laid up on me 
 Do what you feel and I feel what you say and I see what you mean 
 What's in this cup for real? What's in this cup for real? 
 Was this chick for real? Was this bitch for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 I already told you, you already froze up, I am really frozen 
 I already told you, I already rolled up 
 What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real) 
 What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real? 
 (For real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
