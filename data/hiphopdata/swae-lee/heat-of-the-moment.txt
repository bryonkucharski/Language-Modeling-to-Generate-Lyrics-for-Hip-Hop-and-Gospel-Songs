Hey, hey 
 Hey 
 Chopsquad 
 Ooh 
 In the heat of the moment, I know I can... 
 Yeah 
 DJ the beast on this banger! 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself 
 It's no suggestion comin' from me, I'm just somebody that cares 
 And you can front like you don't feel me, you most definitely care 
 And if there's some kinda hold on your love or your heart then baby, why lie? 
 You're killin' me like a homicide, needin' more excitement for your double life 
 Here's the drugs for your sore eyes, from friends that are hard to come by 
 Let's just hope that my phones don't die, so you can reach me 
 I know I'm changin' for sure, lay in the lowest of love 
 And you saw me transform and there was no cure 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself 
 I wonder sometimes, if the one that's passed me by 
 I wonder sometimes, if somebody's lovin' you right 
 Table's turned all of a sudden, ridin' by my side, like on a trollie 
 Father, God, they want my money, heart on fire, they never could crush it 
 Twisting up my dialogue, sorry, but I'm wide-wide eye buggin' 
 Something else you need from me but would you even take a bullet? 
 Let me buy your time even though I wiped off your kiss 
 And I shouldn't say too much because it's what I do that really sinks in 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself 
 In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment 
 In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
