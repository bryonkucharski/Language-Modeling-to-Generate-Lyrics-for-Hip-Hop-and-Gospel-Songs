Oh, oh, oh-oh 
 Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
 Mally Mall 
 It was way more than a two dollar holla 
 Stole your heart like Ali Baba (oh, your heart) 
 Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God (on my phone last night) 
 Do it on my jet, let's keep this private 
 She wants me too, she ain't even in denial (denial) 
 Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial (in denial) 
 We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala ('temala) 
 Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater (goin' under) 
 Baby, when you laughin', is it 'cause you feel an excellent vibe? (Ooh, ooh) 
 That was just a fraction of the good, love I provide (ooh, ooh) 
 See some niggas talkin' on the side, can you keep that silent? (Keep that quiet) 
 Maybe sayin' somethin' but you didn't mean nothin' by it 
 Took her to the room, in other words, kept that private (kept that private) 
 She was my heartbreak, I told her keep those violets (ooh, ooh) 
 Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God (talkin' on the phone) 
 Do it on my jet, let's keep this private 
 She wants me too, she ain't even in denial (denial) 
 Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial (in denial) 
 We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala (Guatemala) 
 Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater (freshwater) 
 Flew in on a jet, what's that? Stylish 
 Take another sip, then get superpowers (whoa, oh, oh) 
 If she got the hots for me, then dammit, I'm buyin' (I'm, I'm buyin') 
 I've got more pull than him and him combined (him combined) 
 Pourin' out dreams, 'cause we're really this high (really that high) 
 I just had my hand on her hip, she had her eyes on the prize (eyes on the prize) 
 Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God (talkin' on the phone) 
 Do it on my jet, let's keep this private 
 She wants me too, she ain't even in denial (denial) 
 Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial (in denial)

 Seatbelt, she roller coaster ridin' 
 Put you on a plane, been thinkin' 'bout it 
 Sippin' on Fiji, yeah, you taste like water (hey, hey) 
 Chasin' me, tryna make me your partner (tryna make me your partner) 
 Maybe we can lock in later on (yeah) 
 I can't guarantee I'll fall (fall) 
 Baby, we should lock in later on (hey) 
 I can't guarantee my heart (hey) 
 Baby, don't take too, too long (too long) 
 I ain't ever miss my mark (my mark) 
 Yeah, my ex-girl had to move on (on) 
 There's no pictures on the wall (ay, ay) 
 Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God (talkin' on the phone) 
 Do it at my house, let's keep this private (keep this private) 
 She wants me too, she ain't even in denial (in denial)
