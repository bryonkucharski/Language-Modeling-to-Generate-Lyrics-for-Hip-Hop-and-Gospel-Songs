Uh, uh 
 I'm the one that won't know how it feels 
 How it feels 
 I'm the one that won't know how feels 
 But I think we both know how it feels 
 Gotta make it so hot like fire drills (ay) 
 And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels 
 Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel 
 You're still a bad girl after all these years 
 Yo, didn't I give you the NyQuil? 
 So you're on home base and I'ma steal 
 I picked you up, your chest like the Man of Steel 
 I might just save that girl like the Man of Steel 
 I might just pull up on stainless steel 
 Don't gotta question, 'cause I know she will 
 Only someone involved can stay the night until (ooh) 
 But I think we both know how it feels (ooh, yeah) 
 This morning when we took shots and cheered 
 You just realized that you had somethin' real (ooh) 
 But I'm the one that don't know how to deal 
 I'ma a-a-always seal the deal 
 I'ma womp, womp, womp then seal the deal 
 With them diamonds that you can see from here 
 If they aren't A-list, just leave 'em there 
 'Cause you'll be hearing about us everywhere 
 When the squad roll up, they couldn't help but stare 
 Ay, I'ma just sit that there 
 She got a ass, she gon' just sit it right there 
 I like a bad bitch when she long hair, no care 
 I won't ever go on no cab 
 I said, "You wanna take a shot?," she said, "Heck yeah" 
 Other niggas over there disrespect, yeah 
 I say, "You tryna be down?," she said, "Heck yeah" 
 Off the drink, baby, I'm a wreck, yeah 
 In the backseat, when I get the neck, yeah 
 Got me runnin' to you for some sex, yeah 
 But for one night, don't know how to feel 
 About a heartbreak story in Encino Hills 
 I'm the one that won't know how feels 
 But I think we both know how it feels 
 Gotta make it so hot like fire drills 
 And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels 
 Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
