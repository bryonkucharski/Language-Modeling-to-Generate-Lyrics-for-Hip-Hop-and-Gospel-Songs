Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah) 
 Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination 
 If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations 
 50 large in my pants like what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion? 
 Just dunked a girl in the pool 
 There's plenty room in my SUV when I'm on the avenue 
 Rich bitch, I'm on to you 
 If it's mine, it ain't up for grabs 
 I make 'em pay me in cash 
 If the last didn't last 
 It's 'cause they didn't love you like they should have 
 So I'll get you from the train station 
 Know you don't mind, so I'll have the tree waitin' 
 If it's on my mind then it's on yours too 
 I'll make the first move and I guarantee you'll call me back, yeah 
 Cupid got a bounty on me (on me) 
 Trouble done found you 
 Banded up 'cause you're callin' (ooh) 
 Banded up 'cause you're callin' (yeah) 
 And I was homesick these past Februaries 
 Runnin' around hopin' payback was sweet 
 Money up, now we really flexin' 
 I take it out of park like 
 Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah) 
 Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
