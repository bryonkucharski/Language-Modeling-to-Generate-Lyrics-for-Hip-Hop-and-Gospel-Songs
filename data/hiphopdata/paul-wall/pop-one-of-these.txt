 Girl, what up? Say lookin' for the boppers 
 Eyes open, scopin' the bunny hoppers 
 Big tits, cheek backside like, woah 
 I like that, you already know 
 I'm drunk on a hundr' tryin' find me a friend 
 When I'm fucked up everything look like a 10 
 Baby got back and, yeah, I'm with that 
 I'm a player, my game show up like a thumb tack 
 Baby is throwin' up but I keep pullin' up 
 Their ain't no slowin' up, I'm a keep goin' 'til 
 Girl say that the room is spinnin' 
 Wait it get's better, this just the beginning 
 Wait 'til you can't feel your hands and feet 
 This your first time rollin'? You're in for a treat 
 You wake up tomorrow thinkin' what did you do 
 While you at it, don't stop, take one of these too

 Leaned out, chasin' my N's 
 All these hoes keep chasin' my friends 
 Is all good, I stared through the lens 
 Kick back and just laugh while they chasin' the Benz 
 I tell a bitch like Gobi, go harder or go home 
 She ain't doin' nothin' for me, she can leave me alone 
 Pretty thing walked up like, ay what it is? 
 She said she like my shirt, she was lookin' at Biz 
 I said biz, she said biz okay, it is what it is 
 Just go tuggin' on my neck and I'm a handle the biz 
 I reach into my pocket and I pulled out a grip 
 All kinds of different colors and I told her don't trip 
 First one's on me, all the rest on you 
 She said, I'll hit the ATM, it's best that you do 
 I let her through, skipped off, 5 minutes was back 
 Told me fuck it, give me everything and gave me a stack like that 
 Hella drunk and she on E 
 All these broads keep pullin' on me

 Yeah, I'm controllin' 
 All this shit in my hand I'm holdin' 
 I know she's rollin' 
 Jumped in the limo, don't know where we goin' 
 Don't ask just fall in 
 I pull it out and pack it all in 
 Girl, why you stallin'? 
 My phone keeps ringin', females callin' 
 I'm a show you I'm pimpin' 
 'Bout to have fun if you like women 
 Always keep two or three 
 I don't give a fuck if you like me 
 I'm a rapper, you a groupie 
 I go back in there and get a new three 
 As soon as I walk in the door 
 Met another girl, ready to go and she was 
 Hella drunk and she on E 
 All these broads keep pullin' on me 
 (On me) 
 Won't stunt, pullin' my tree

 Mommy can't keep her hands off me
