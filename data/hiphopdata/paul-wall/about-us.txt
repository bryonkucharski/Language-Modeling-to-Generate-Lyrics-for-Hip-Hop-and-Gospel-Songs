Paul Wall: 
 Boys talkin' down 
 On the sidelines watching, wishin' they was playin' the game we playin' 
 But it's all good though 
 Paul Wall Brooke what up baby 
 Brooke: 
 What it do Paul Wall 
 Look who's talkin' 
 Paul Wall: 
 Okay, hey 
 What it do 
 I hear the commentators on the side chatter boxing 
 Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watching 
 I hear them jaw japping bumping guns chasing crones 
 We ain't concerned with them bums we accumulating funds 
 Plastic wrist got the Johnny Dang watch froze 
 5 kid vivid yellow stone in my earlobe 
 I'm squashing chatter when the light hit the pinky ring 
 Starch and clean white puff with the lean 
 See me in the new Benz 'cause I'm oh so ballin' 
 Or a old school slab with the fifth wheel fallin' 
 We got 'em talkin' but really they ain't saying too much 
 Just speculating with that gossip truth is they don't know about us 
 Brooke: 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing (No) 
 Everybody talking like they really know something about us (They don't know baby) 
 But they don't know nothing about us (They don't know baby, they don't know about it) 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing (No) 
 Everybody talking like they really wanna know about us (They don't know baby) 
 But they don't know nothing about us (They don't know baby, they don't know about it baby) 
 Brooke: 
 I'm just trying to live but your all up in my grill 
 How's a girl to breathe with all the media starring down my mouth 
 With a four inch lenz I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends 
 Paul Wall: 
 They talkin' 'bout us so I guess were doing something right 
 Ballin' in the mix with the camera lights shining bright 
 They know we caked up but they don't know how much we worth 
 Paper stacked to the ceiling now because we put in work 
 Brooke: 
 Picture yourself up in my shoes 
 Top story in the news 
 Everyday its something new 
 Everybody's watching you 
 But they ain't seen nothing 
 They ain't heard nothing 
 Everybody's just fronting, that's what they do 
 Brooke: 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing 
 Everybody talking like they really know something about us 
 But they don't know nothing about us 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing (No) 
 Everybody talking like they really wanna know something about us (They don't know baby) 
 But they don't know nothing about us (They don't know baby, they don't know about it baby) 
 Stop stop stop 
 I'm not listening 
 You can save your breath 
 I don't wanna hear the rumors people are spreading 
 Why, why do people go 
 Out of there way 
 To try to bring us down 
 They don't know nothin' 'bout us 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing (No) 
 Everybody talking like they really know something about us (They don't know baby) 
 But they don't know nothing about us (They don't know baby, they don't know about it) 
 I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing (No) 
 Everybody talking like they really know something about us (They don't know baby) 
 But they don't know nothing about us (They don't know baby, they don't know about it baby)
