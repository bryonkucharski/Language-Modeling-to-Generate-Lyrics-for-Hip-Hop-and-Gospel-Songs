Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop 
 I be at the very top, pop 
 Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 (P. Wall, Baby Bash) 
 Pop me like a lemon drop 
 Pop that thang baby, shake watcha got 
 Yeah, you workin' with a lot, baby, please don't stop 
 Gotcha body lookin' hot, don't mind if I watch 
 Ya head is top notch, ya skin is butterscotch 
 Into the club, all eyes on you 
 Baby you look good, you're thicker than stew 
 You got friends, boo? Well, I got mine, too 
 The club closed at two, can I roll with you? 
 You hip like MK, hood like Mary J, pretty as Lisa Raye 
 Baby, can we play? 
 I call you lemon drop 'cause you look so sweet 
 Gon' pop what you got baby, be my freak, come on 
 Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop 
 I be at the very top, pop 
 Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop 
 I don't just want the table girl, I need a whole wing 
 Keep the bottle pourin' 'til we need a submarine 
 When she off caffeine, baby girl you're so active 
 Strong as a mattress, grab on my package 
 Go-go boots from the stage to the cage 
 California wild fire, hot in a rage 
 Check her Facebook page, video upload 
 My number one hina, so damn throw, so damn cold 
 Candy-coated like Skittles 
 I'm a pop that like I pop two thizzles 
 Girl, get your smash on, sweet and low so tender 
 When I got you, I don't need no Splenda 
 Sweeter than a cherry, pop 
 I be at the very top, pop 
 Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop 
 Baby, gon' do that, fine but you knew that 
 Holla at a man and break me off that Kit Kat 
 Lookin' so mean with them dangerous curves 
 I'ma have you wet and needy by the end of the verse 
 You're the first number one top pick of them all 
 Bring your girl for Bash, you can roll with Mr. Wall 
 You the baddest I saw when you're ready to bop 
 Baby, be my lemon drop, don't stop, don't stop 
 Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop 
 I be at the very top, pop 
 Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop 
 Sweeter than a cherry pop, pop 
 I be at the very top, pop 
 Watch me 'cause I'm very hot, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop, pop, pop 
 Pop me like a lemon drop
