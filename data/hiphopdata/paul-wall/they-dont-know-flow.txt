Mike Jones... Paul Wall 
 What you know bout livin' lavish 
 What you know bout reebok classics 
 Down south is where I stay 
 We sit drank and rock RBK 
 (Mike Jones) 
 I hit the block and I'm lookin' lavish 
 White t-shirt, pants baggin' 
 Wit a fresh pair of reebok classics 
 On the grind tryin' get cash 
 Down south is where I stay 
 We sit drank and rock RBK 
 I hit the cabinet everday for a fresh pair 
 'Cause I don't play 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Its Paul Wall and Mike Jones 
 We street legends and mic breakers 
 Its fancy footwork on my toes 
 I hit the club wit my reebok classics 
 Its gotta be reebok on my shoe 
 Their all white and they brand new 
 When the swishahouse and down south 
 We wear reeboks I thought you knew 
 What you know bout livin' lavish 
 What you know bout reebok classics 
 Down south is where I stay 
 We sit drank and rock RBK
