Big Swangaz and Vouges 
 Them 20 inches sittin' low 
 We Ball 24's 7's all that we know 
 Screens and neon lights gon show 
 When my trunk unlock pop and show 
 Ya already know 
 Paint drippin off the door 
 Not engaged with no lady, fall in love with 'em no! 
 You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
 I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough... 
 I'm in love with my money 
 (Chamillionaire - Talking) 
 Yeah man, me and Paul just goin' 2 different direction man 
 Know what I'm sayin', he decided to go back to the Swishahouse 
 And I decided not to ya know what I'm sayin'? 
 I'm just tryin' to do my thing right now 
 And hopefully we'll turn this into a major label debut 
 When "Controversy" sells ya feel me? 
 But uh, uh we both are with Paid In Full 
 I'm not on Paid In Full Records no more, no longer on contract 
 I'm doin' my own thing, Chamillitary Entertainment 
 And ya already know in this man 
 A lil somethin' for the fans 
 I'ma let you hear the first song we did off of "Get Ya Mind Correct" 
 Ya ain't know I had this did ya? 
 ---A lil somethin' for the fans 
 I'ma let why'all hear the first song we actually did on "Get Ya Mind Correct" 
 It's called "Weatherman", why'all ain't know I still had this did why'all-haha 
 (Chorus - Paul Wall) 
 I'm the weatherman ain't nobody stoppin' my reign 
 A lot of watered down rappers still hot 'cause I came 
 I'ma forest fire ain't nobody stoppin' my flame 
 Can't nobody stop me from stockin' my change 
 (Repeat) 
 (Paul Wall) 
 I'm the weatherman ain't nobody stoppin' my reign 
 On top of my game, decapitate the top show and bang 
 They knockin' my fame and biz' 'cause of rocks in my watch 
 If you was smart you'd watch the golds that's on top of my crotch 
 The rocks in my watch, is more then a Rocky Sandlot 
 You jealous 'cause you bought diamonds from diamond shamrock 
 Look, all recruiters should be checkin' my stats 
 I cross competition over shake em' dead in they tracks 
 I pack an axe by my way, bodyguard by my biscuit 
 Make money, lose money never afraid to risk it 
 I don't get writers block, I block other writers 
 Spittin' fire like if I had a mouth full of lighters 
 I'm countin' so much money that I caught a hand-cramp 
 I date models you date girls that went to band camp 
 I'ma hurricane, you just a gust of wind 
 I'm on fire, you just ashes and dust my friend 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Uh, it's just the lil bad weatherman, raindrops drop on ya pours 
 They sick of them boys, pullin' up in ridiculous cars 
 Ain't no one's, sicker then are's the wizard of oz 
 Couldn't give you a bigger brain and make you rich as them boys 
 Young Koopa the weatherman, he lelay his weatherband 
 With drank in a metal can, want to stop him get a better plan 
 That one you got, that ain't really workin' pat'na 
 Ya shirt is prada, how come ya flow ain't worth a dollar, holla 
 Chamillion's insane niggaz gonna complain 
 Can't explain why ya girl want to give me brain and run a train 
 Niggaz runnin' in shame, tellin' them to run in train 
 The Lizard stepped in the game and started runnin' thangs 
 If ya can't sleep anymore while the raindrops pour 
 And you look our your window and hear footsteps on the floor 
 If you saw a crooked smile and a glistenin' jaw 
 Don't open the door fa' sure time for bad weather why'all, let it reign 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Bad weather's ruin about, if you travel my route 
 It's time to flood the market, 'cause there's been a drought 
 Review the resume, my team is undefeatable 
 You fabricate ya life with stories unbelievable 
 I'ma ballin' star, you a fallin' star 
 All used up like no minutes on a callin' card 
 I'm the bank you ain't nothin' but a dollar or two 
 You just sand on a beach, and I'm the wave that swallows you 
 Nobody follows you, you're like bad directions 
 Ya life needs an eraser, there's to many corrections 
 Ever since I was born, I've been far from the norm 
 I'm the one that kept ya girl warm when you was gone 
 Now you and ya born needin' ya palm 
 Watchin' thorn or outside a dorm, humpin' ya horn ya heart torn 
 You get warned down the scarecrow and a crop full of corn 
 Grab an umbrella 'cause them boys bringin' the storm 
 (Chamillionaire Shouts-Out to DJ's)
