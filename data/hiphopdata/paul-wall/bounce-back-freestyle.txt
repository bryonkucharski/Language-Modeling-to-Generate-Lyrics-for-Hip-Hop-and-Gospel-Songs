Its paul wall... time to bounce back baby 
 Back on the Swishahouse... back on the team 
 Its goin' down its paul wall 
 I remember comin' up as just a youngster scrub 
 When people think you ain't gonna make it, they don't show much love 
 So I push and I shoved, and I stuggled and worked 
 GOD granded me wit blesses but pain came first 
 Alot fake as patna, alot fraud as hoes 
 Alot so called friends, that took big swangers and vouges 
 Alot videos, and a whole lotta greed 
 The bill still gotta get paid and my heart still gotta plead 
 So I fled from the scene step my game up a notch 
 Now I'm to where I started, gettin' money from Watts 
 GOD blessed me wit a second chance 
 Now T-farris be bookin me for shows from Idaho to France 
 When you got a hit song, people ride ya dick 
 But soon you #2 people tin to forget 
 Man had a healthy win, even though my compentition cheated 
 MPT came along and gave me the push I needed 
 Who you was ready to ride and I needed that 
 'Cause most of my other homies seem to turn they back 
 But I ain't trippin' I moved on to bigger things 
 And I'd bounced back N now I'm on the winnin' team 
 Baby it's the Swishahouse... baby it's the Swishahouse... 
 Baby it's the Swishahouse
