I need drugs in my life like right now 
 Some oil in my cup like right now

 A bad bitch that could f-ck, like right now 
 Right now, right now, right now

 Gotta a pocket full of bread, bitch, I came here to blow it 
 So bitch, get your mind right, pull out I'm talking some 
 Swagged up I be killing, killing 
 My car ain't got no ceiling 
 I know these boys don't talk down 
 But for haters I've got no feeling 
 The paper in my pocket, my bitch ain't got no panties 
 A tall Puerto Rican that I met that in Miami 
 I went to her apartment so she act like she could spare me 
 Till I seen her with her friends all boppin at the grammies 
 So I f-ck her at the Grammies, I keep condom handy 
 My Chevy sittin' slanted told eddie paint it candy 
 I'm blowing on the Cali my hand full of skittles 
 Treating broads like stitches I could split them down the middle

 You know when a nigga want it, your bitch now that I get it 
 She graduated from Florida state, but I hear 
 Pulling up in a fo' do', with fo' ho's, and fo' fo's 
 All I smoke is good dro, mid grade a no-no 
 She told me come and get that pussy right know 
 I had to tell her "momma, please pipe down! "

 Well I gotta go and hit a nigga right now!

 So I'm not only the boss, but homie I'm also the one that own it 
 I own it, in A-T-L with that bonus, I gotta a super broad that will blow me 
 And I'm not about to wait for not a dollar if you owe me 
 The double cup is lonely, so pour some of that juice 
 I'm leanin' tough, that ain't enough, I need at least a deuce 
 These tricks about to get loose, get loose 
 A bad bitch to the roots, I'm papered up she tatted down, my waistline to her boots 
 I'm on one or two, but I'm a need me a few 
 I'm gone off in bananas like gorillas in the zoo 
 Don't worry if I run out, I keep something in my shoe 
 And the broad riding with me, ready to blow some
