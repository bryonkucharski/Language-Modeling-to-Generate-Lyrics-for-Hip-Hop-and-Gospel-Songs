Take a look at me. 
 Take a look at me now. 
 Take a look. 
 Once upon a time, not too long ago 
 Down in the great state of Texas where we live life slow 
 I was born amongst poverty, I had no dough 
 Motivated by a dream with some hustle and flow 
 My paper was never long but my ambition was strong 
 Followin Gods path, I could never go wrong 
 I took a road less traveled and I got a few scrapes 
 But the journey was all worth it just to get that cake 
 Mama told me I would make it, some fools just laughed 
 But I remembered how The Bible say "The first shall be last." 
 And even thought all the teams skipped over me in the draft 
 I ignored all the haters and perfected my craft 
 Times change, and nowadays to me it seem funny 
 The same people hatin', callin me up to borrow money 
 But I hold no grudge, I just forgave and forgot 
 I guess that's the reason I made it to the top 
 Take a look at me now... 
 Haters said that I would never get this paper 
 But Ima see my money regardless 
 Got the soul of a hustla 
 When it comes to gettin' my bread... 
 ...I'm heartless 
 Take a look at me now 
 Take a look at me now 
 Take a look at me now 
 Take a look at me now 
 Take a look at me now
