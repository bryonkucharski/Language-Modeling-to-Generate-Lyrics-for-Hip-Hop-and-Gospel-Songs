We out here, trying to get it rain or shine 
 Can't nobody take what's mine 
 But people say 
 That they gon' try to kill me 
 Go hard for mine is all I know 
 I'm trying to get all this dough 
 I try to say 
 If you want me, come and get me 
 Early in the morning when the sun come up 
 I be playing my position, trying to chase a come up 
 I'm on the corner like little kids waiting for the school bus 
 I'm Reggie bush about my paper man, I gotta rush 
 I'm chasing Johnny Dame, co vein with diamond crush 
 I want that TV Johnny watch, earrings and such 
 I got my mind focused driving in the fast lane 
 Apple paint and white seats, looking like a candy cane 
 I'm running marathons, while these lames running sprints 
 Been pulling all nighters, all year and ever since 
 I'm steady grinding on the rise like Honda pants 
 Partner this is common sense, stacking up dollars and cents 
 I'm thinking pickett fence, six rooms, that's on a lake 
 Long as I keep stacking bread like pancakes 
 I pray with high stakes, so I can crawl down like snakes 
 Trying to eat them Vincent Anthony steaks, I gotta get more 
 We out here, trying to get it rain or shine 
 Can't nobody take what's mine 
 But people say 
 That they gon' try to kill me 
 Go hard for mine is all I know 
 I'm trying to get all this dough 
 I try to say 
 If you want me, come and get me 
 From a Buick to a Benz, the American dream 
 Riding apple over silver with the insides cream 
 I got my mind on the foreign so I hustle some green 
 And I'm somewhat color struck 'cause I only love green 
 I'm living the ghetto dream, money, hoes and clothes 
 My mind on bankrolls, I stay up on my toes 
 See, I'm working for that paper, chasing after that cash 
 Overtime punching clocks, I call it a monster mash 
 That paper in my vision, so I grind with precision 
 A hustler's ambition to accumulate commission 
 My eyes is burning 'cause I ain't slept in 'bout a week 
 And there's no time to eat 'cause my body is weak 
 I'm [unverified] it's time for cash stacking, there ain't no time for slacking 
 I'm racking money now, later I'll be Cadillac'n' 
 I'm packing paper and my pockets over flowing to the top 
 That's why I'm blowing my dawg, I gotta get that money 
 We out here, trying to get it rain or shine 
 Can't nobody take what's mine 
 But people say 
 That they gon' try to kill me 
 Go hard for mine is all I know 
 I'm trying to get all this dough 
 I try to say 
 If you want me, come and get me 
 The clock keep on ticking and the countdown is on 
 My paper keep on stacking now it won't be long 
 I'm King Kong of the hustle, using mind with muscle 
 Putting together plots and schemes like a piece to a puzzle 
 The boys chasing broads but I'm out here stacking bars 
 Motivated my screw tapes that's in my iPod 
 My job is all night my hustle is all day 
 When you thrown in the game, there ain't no 401K 
 I got a dream like Dr. King [unverified] 
 I swing it like Peter Parker in the Cadillac 
 So now I'm changing up the game like a clinic bitch 
 Hood super star with dreams of getting rich, gimme more 
 We out here, trying to get it rain or shine 
 Can't nobody take what's mine 
 But people say 
 That they gon' try to kill me 
 Go hard for mine is all I know 
 I'm trying to get all this dough 
 I try to say 
 If you want me, come and get me
