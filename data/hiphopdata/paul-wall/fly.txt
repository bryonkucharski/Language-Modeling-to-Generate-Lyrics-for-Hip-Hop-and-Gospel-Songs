I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly 
 Bitch I'm sittin' so high, I believe I can fly 
 The coupe looks delicious, the rims are waving bye 
 Money long like Diddy, I put on for my city 
 Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that hemi 
 I'm gold but you don't hear me 
 Four to the dome if you can hear me 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high 
 They say I need a pull up, when I pull up I'm the shit man 
 When I grow up I wanna be like T-Pain, a hit man 
 But do yourself a favor partner, don't be talkin' shit man 
 You're broad done up and broke your heart 
 My whole squad hit man 
 Hold up I see dead people 
 It's just the dead white guys on my bread people 
 Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly 
 I'm high as the moon and I'm flier than a mosquito 
 Stackin' my chips, I got a bag full of Doritos 
 I'm too cool for school so I'm teachin' a class 
 Chiefin' on that purple rain partner, puff, puff, pass 
 See I'm higher than the price of gas, gone off vanilla cream 
 Rollin' off of Mac Dre leanin' like a triple beam 
 I got my wrist froze up like computer screens 
 So fresh, so clean exhale sticky green 
 I got the top steady droppin' like record sales 
 Paint changin' colors like Tyra Bank's finger nails 
 Choose the fast life, I'm the flashy type 
 Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite 
 'Cause I'm fly 
 Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly 
 I believe I can lean spite and codeine 
 Someone's sleepin' on the scene 
 That's a hell of a dream, I'm a hell of a guy 
 That's a hell of a blunt, fire it up, lets' get high 
 You can call me G five 'cause I be in the clouds 
 Somewhere in the club with my clothes smellin' loud 
 And never will I smile 'cause I be bitin' down 
 Rollin' off a P probably muggin' with a frown 
 But no, ain't nothin' wrong how could he be on rich 
 Bitch looked at my whip, bitch looked at my wrist 
 My wrist is tricked in ice, my neck is dripped in ice 
 Bitch look at my life, don't you wanna be my wife? 
 Would you like to be my girl? 
 Don't you wanna change your life? 
 I can change your life 
 Grab the credit card and swipe, like see? 
 Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high 
 I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly 
 Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly 
 I'm so high, I'm so high
