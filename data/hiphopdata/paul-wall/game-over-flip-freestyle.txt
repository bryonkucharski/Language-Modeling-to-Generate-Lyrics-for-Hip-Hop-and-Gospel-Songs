 I'm on the grind wit Mike Jones who look like stamps

 'Cause we spendin' money on cars while they wastin' more months

 Michael Watts chopped it slowly that's the reason I'm one and only 
 I'm still tippin' on four fours to prove to you I'm really doe 
 Hit crawface wit his hoes I'm in a Lincoln on those vouges 
 Buy some skates drop the top in the club I shock and rock 
 Hoes bop so the ball the block I'm on the grind try in a knot 
 I'm climbin' up the ladder of success slowly 
 Some of my homies turn phonie and turn on me 
 Let me out they broke and lonely thinkin' I'll falled off 
 But Michael Watts open the door and let me back in the house 
 Its Paul Wall
