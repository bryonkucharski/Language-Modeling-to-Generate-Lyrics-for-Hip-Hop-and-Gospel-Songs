I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 Hey wat it do, I'm on like a light switch 
 My wrist well froze up like a computer glitch 
 I'm drinkin' 151 karaboolu, take nine gone get it jumpin' 
 Like a kangaroo is it cho birthday, let's go on have 
 A shot or two, my partner Glu, you put me on to somethin' new 
 Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from chic-fil-a 
 Mix it up with this a rokin', we gona party 
 I'm lookin' for a hot girl that like ta ay bay, bay, bay 
 Come out and play let's see ya shake it this way 
 That Patron clear as day, I'm on that hard 
 I'm getting' lit wit my dawgs havin' a party with 
 Their brods 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 Gone and poppin' another bottle, get this party to crakin' 
 All these barby doll models make the champs start backin' 
 550's everywhere nothing can't depend it, he's on his fifth premiere 
 At seven, it ain't even eleven 
 Thug boss slim thug drikin' GPO 
 Greygoose, Patron and orange juice, po' me som mo' 
 Now box and poppy Joe just ordered the rose mo 
 Drunkin' duces to my partner, how I see him big go 
 I'm loaded like a full clip, leanin' like a sinkin' ship 
 Lit up like a Christmas tree, how much throwd up can I get 
 C Stone and Lil' C bringin' out the eager bomb 
 If I get pulled over, DJ Jonny can pay my bond off 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home? 
 I keep bumpin' into people, say man my bad 
 I'm intoxicated a tad and the DJ had to be 
 Miskin' Mike and Scad, my family gettin' slammed 
 Needs a cool wages bought around another damn grand 
 Man I'm so throwed, I can't think 
 Who the hell been puttin' they lips on my drink 
 What the hell the waitress doin' wit my change 
 Maybe some Red Bull will help you sober up 
 Matter fact, mix it wit this Greygoose in my cup 
 I can barely stand up, I'm about to throw up 
 If you can't roll with the big dawgz go hang wit the pups 
 I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome 
 I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?
