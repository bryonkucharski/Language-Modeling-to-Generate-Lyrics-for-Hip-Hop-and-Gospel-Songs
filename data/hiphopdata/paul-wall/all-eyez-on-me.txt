What it do its Paul Wall from the 713 
 I'm only 59 on the block in south beach 
 It's all eyes on me, soon as I step on the scene 
 Them stars down lookin' clean drained in the skin 
 From the shirt to the jeans, I'm lookin' doped boy fresh 
 Hangin' from my neck is a deep freezer ice chest 
 Catch me in Omaha but it ain't like Belly 
 Them boys is breakin' bread out there servin' that jelly 
 I'ma old school player wit a new school hustle 
 Boys talkin' down only gettin' lost in the shuffle 
 Its paul wall from the lone star state 
 Swishahouse through the door puttin' food on my plate 
 Boys tryin' hate 'cause they broke and lonely 
 Boys used to be my homie but they all turn on me 
 But they don't want me they full of baloney 
 We'll recongize real and we'll recongize phoney 
 The chick magnet that's my album in stores 
 I'm in the compree's class bouncin' on 24's 
 My money run long like a wide receiver 
 I'm at the blue flame watchin' girls shake it like a seizure 
 Catch me in colorado popin' patrome bottles 
 I'm somethin' like Mekhi Phifer where I go, hoes follow 
 Boys say I'm slick at the mic 'cause the hits are out of sight 
 I swing the block like a fish in a fight 
 Its paul wall and its another platinum promotion 
 Since I got the swisha love hoes want my love potion 
 The motion of my ocean got me rockin' they boat 
 Not to mention they jockin' my quotes and bobbin' my quotes 
 I'm on another level, step ya game up 
 Go get some new jewelery partner get ya change up 
 I'm fix to change up and switch the rotation 
 It feels like I'm on a stakeout I'm "patiently waitin'" 
 These boys hatin' on me but they gettin' there own grade 
 I broke free from momma's chain I ain't nobodys slave 
 Its paul wall swishahouse swishablast 
 And its another platinum promotion baby 
 My album the chick magnet and its in stores 
 I'm just sayin' its goin' down baby paul wall 
 Chick magnet people's champ how to be a player 
 I'm just sayin' though know talkin' bout... 
 Its goin' down baby 713 new south movement in stores now 
 Paul wall
