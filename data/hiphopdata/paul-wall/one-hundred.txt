When you up, you up and when you down, you down 
 But when you fall off just peep out who still come around 
 It ain't too many gon' hold you down 
 When you down and not on ya luck 
 But I'ma be right by your side even when that road get rough 
 I keep it cool when the streets is hot 
 And all your friends that soon forgot 
 They leavin' you all alone to rot 
 But I'll be there till you back on top 
 I'm down with you with no strings 
 No matter what, one hundred or more than a few 
 I'm gettin' that paper to feed my crew 
 And no matter what you goin' through, I'm stayin' true 
 I know you been searchin' for someone 
 To keep it one hundred 
 So tired of mixed love and bullshit 
 And keep keepin' it comin' 
 Damn right, he came up from nothin' 
 But now he's got money 
 And he's feedin' his people 
 Ain't no one of 'em gon' ever go hungry 
 I represent Mo' City until the day I die 
 I speak the truth even when I say a lie 
 Even lil' babies know better than to play with I 
 Would be to lost and never found to say bye bye 
 Y'all already know I got a lot of evil in me 
 But I got a lot of that love shit too 
 'Cause I promise I'm in love with my ride 
 And I'm in love with what it's sittin' on 
 Bitch and my pants so blue 
 Thanks to Paul Wall 
 You already know I got love for ya bro 
 My cup empty yo cup, if you less pour some mo' 
 My nigga T-Faris and J-Dawg 
 And even my old school nigga fuck 
 When they show us hate, we gon' show 'em back love 
 Now but last year would've been a different scene 
 But I'ma let you make it 
 'Cause I'm really tryna keep it one hundred 
 So stay the fuck away from me, please 
 I know you been searchin' for someone 
 To keep it one hundred 
 So tired of mixed love and bullshit 
 And keep keepin' it comin' 
 Damn right, he came up from nothin' 
 But now he's got money 
 And he's feedin' his people 
 Ain't no one of 'em gon' ever go hungry 
 Homie, I'm different like a alien 
 Drivin' in that mothership, it's black, it's midnight 
 I'm sittin' high up on that numbers list 
 Wet from all this paper rain but now I'm never drowsy 
 They talk but I can't even hear the way they whisper 'bout me 
 Even if they doubt me, haters I'm off limits 
 Blowin' cake, oh yeah, I make desert for a livin' 
 So many times I swear I spare my last one hundred 
 Like a grade in the class, now that's extra credit 
 I know you been searchin' for someone 
 To keep it one hundred 
 So tired of mixed love and bullshit 
 And keep keepin' it comin' 
 Damn right, he came up from nothin' 
 But now he's got money 
 And he's feedin' his people 
 Ain't no one of 'em gon' ever go hungry
