Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 This is the year of the you, watch how I get on track 
 A young black Peyton manning in the rap gettin' his snaps 
 And also, he only rides in the year that he's in 
 'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so, let the boy be 
 He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee 
 Bitches watchin' him thinkin', "What if he wife me?" 
 And it's a certain kind of swagger you get 
 Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right 
 All of my boss bitches know the type 
 When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike 
 A nice fit and video on the TV'll 
 Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me 
 I'm a thug and I'ma stay on pub 
 And I don't hug 'cause I carry the strap in the club 
 I see ya peepin' tryin' to figure out what's happenin' with us 
 They love the way I be leanin', that's why they baggin' it up 
 Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin'

 All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 You know that purple drank I be leanin', my diamonds shinin' and gleamin' 
 I'm in that dropper with Juve the groupies boppin' and fiendin' 
 I'm from the home of the candy paint, 84's and purple drank 
 Ladies know when I hit they corner my slabs'll make 'em faint 
 Ice Age and U.T.P., ball-ballin' as you can see 
 Crawl-crawlin' on 23's, with candy on my HumVee 
 Honies love the way I talk, love the way I walk 
 Love the way I lean, they say that I'm so clean 
 I got a lot of money, I got a lot of ice 
 I got a lot of cars, many colors and lots of types 
 I got that paper 'cause I'm caked up like Betty Crocker 
 Comin' down on choppers single file with all the trunk poppers 
 Gettin' money's my only task, stack up paper and count cash 
 I'm ridin' on that pull over silver, the same color as a bad rash 
 Gettin' full of that puff, puff, pass, it's Paul Wall, man, what that do 
 Swishahouse baby, that's my crew, comin' down jammin' on the Screw 
 Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 Said, the ladies, they love me, they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin' 
 Drove over two dogs, sittin' on two fogs 
 My rims be talkin' too, they love to seduce hogs 
 They're dressed in cute clothes, manicured with cute toes 
 I'm big paper; Wacko never stop for group hoes 
 Oh no, I don't scoop those, fly bitches salute those 
 Fatties with benefits, you know I recruit those 
 This a Soulja Slim T-shirt, this ain't no suit hoe 
 I got Pradas up under these, not no Timberland boots hoe 
 I'm sick dog and there ain't no antidote 
 Bust your motherfuckin' head like a cantaloupe 
 Like Hannibal, woof, I'm an animal 
 Just cold dickin' the money down, huh, ain't it though? 
 I'ma do my damn thing 'til I can't no mo' 
 Don't make me pull this damn trigger 'til it ain't no mo' 
 And don't tell me where you ain't gon' go 
 I'ma just tell you one time, get to fuck 'til I ain't no mo'
