Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
 Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
 Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
 My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
 Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
 Five percent or ten, but still my screens gon glow 
 These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
 Everytime I come round the corner 
 (Paul Wall) 
 I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
 But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
 I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
 It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
 Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
 But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
 See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
 It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
 Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
 I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
 Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
 But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
 They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
 I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
 I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
 Paul Wall and Trae, hit 'em with that one-two punch 
 (Trae) 
 When I flip in my slab 
 I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
 Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
 I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
 Blue over gray, side of my drop with six TV's I'm displaying 
 They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
 But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
 Slugs gon be flying, out the glock 
 I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
 And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
 Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
 Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
 They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
 Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
 But not today, cause Trae gon be flipping on top of his game 
 We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me mayn 
 When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
 And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 
 (Trae) 
 Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
 These haters are goners, 'cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
 I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
 Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
 I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
 I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
 Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it mayn 
 With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Mo' money mo' problems mayn, the legend is true 
 You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
 I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
 Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
 People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
 But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
 These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
 But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw
