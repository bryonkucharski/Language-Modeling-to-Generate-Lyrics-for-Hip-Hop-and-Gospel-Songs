They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top 
 They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about 
 When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop 
 But this the sound of revenge 
 Yeah 
 On the path to find out who's true 
 The only person you can really trust is you 
 And if you feel like you can't even trust you 
 Then you can always trust you know who 
 And if you don't know who you know who is 
 Then I feel so sorry for you 
 Cause that's really the only person that can judge you 
 Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do 
 Shouldn't do and must do 
 But when you got that glow 
 Nobody else's words can really budge you 
 Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin 
 And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win 
 Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
 Is what it coulda been 
 When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in 
 But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end 
 And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been 
 Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin' 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 Well say it again 
 Keep it movin' 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 Screw it then 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock 
 I'm runnin' to the finish yeah, when I get there I ain't gonna stop 
 Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell 'em look what I got 
 It's the sound of revenge
