Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 'Cause yo mama and yo gal told me so 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 You can see my pinky ring shinin' that's fo' sho' 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 And I'm ridin' in the drop real slow 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 When I pass by watch they mouth strike a pose 
 Lord, have mercy, man, I'm so clean 
 Like Oil of Olay and Irish spring 
 And I feel nothin' 'cause I'm a one man team 
 What the fuck I'm a smile fo' my mug stay mean 
 You can buy a denali wit' da diamonds in my mouth 
 You can buy an apartment wit' da diamonds on my wrist 
 I been screwed up click ever since 96' 
 Z-Ro the crooked and paul wall up in this, bitch 
 In da aston martin outside 
 Seein' sumbody, baby, momma gon' take a rid 
 I'm rollin' on cigarillo afta cigarillo afta cigarillo 
 Goddammit, I'm high 
 Orford Dodger jeans, Orford Dodger shirt 
 And da shoes to match goddamit 
 I'm fly can't forget 3rd coast customs 
 Got da van lookin' like a slice of blueberry pie 
 And I love vegetables in fact 
 I'm wearin' 70 karats around my neck 
 And 11 mo around my finger 
 But who countin' anyway 
 I'm tryna cash my publishin' check 
 I'm rollin' on 84's and vogues 
 Twenty inches above the ground 
 I keep 10,000 in a briefcase wit me 
 In case I ever go outta town 
 You keep it real wit' me I keep it real wit' you 
 And don't waste my time 'cause I got shit to do 
 If it's important then I'm a really get wit' you 
 But be patient 'cause I got sum mo shit to do 
 I'm steppin' ova hatas in my brown and beige gators 
 My shoulda slap up under my blazer 
 And if I do say so myself, I'm sharper than a razor 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 'Cause yo mama and yo gal told me so 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 You can see my pinky ring shinin' that's fo' sho' 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 And I'm ridin' in the drop real slow 
 Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know 
 When I pass by watch they mouth strike a pose
