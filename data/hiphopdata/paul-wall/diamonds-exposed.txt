 Lookin' Good, Feelin' Good 
 You know I'm a crawl slow 
 Popped up sittin' on my swangas & 4 
 Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on

 Popped up with them 4's on

 I let her ride and get inside 
 Cause "I'm A G" was her ringtone 
 Hit the stage with my diamonds hot 
 They don't know what my shine bout
