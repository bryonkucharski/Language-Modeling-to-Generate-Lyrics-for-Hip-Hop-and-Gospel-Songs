Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four fours 
 Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four volks 
 Tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours 
 Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four volks 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix 
 It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick 
 Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping 
 Bar sipping car dipping grand wood grain gripping 
 Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours 
 Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours 
 Blowing on the endo Game Cube Nintendo 
 Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window 
 These niggaz don't understand 'cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy 
 Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy 
 Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress 
 Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness 
 Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade 
 When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade 
 I got it made the big boss of the north 
 Ain't shit changed I still represent Swisha House (Ha!) 
 (Mike Jones) 
 Four Fours I'm tippin' 
 Wood grain I'm gripping 
 Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping 
 Turn your neck and your dank missing 
 Me and Slim we ain't tripping I'm finger flipping and syrup sipping 
 Like do or die I'm pour pimping Car stop rims keep spinning 
 I'm flipping drop with indvisible tops 
 Hoes bop when my drop step out 
 I'm shaking the block with four eighteens' 
 Candy green with eleven screens 
 My gasoline always supreme 
 Got do-do the brown with a pint of lean 
 It takes grinding to be a king 
 It takes grinding to be a king 
 First Round Draft Picks coming 
 Who is Mike Jones coming 
 Slab shining with the grill and woman 
 Slab shining with the grill and woman 
 I'm Mike Jones (Who) Mike Jones the one and only you can't cloan me 
 Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony 
 Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me 
 Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me 
 Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me 
 (I Said!) Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me 
 (Paul Wall) 
 What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the people's champ 
 My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp 
 I'm crawling similar to a ant 'cause I'm low to the earth 
 People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth 
 I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out 
 I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout 
 Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain 
 Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes 
 Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast 
 Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash 
 Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top 
 G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop 
 I got the internet going nuts 
 But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts 
 It's Paul Wall baby what you know 'bout me 
 I'm on that five nine Southle baby holla at me
