 How else could you capture the world 
 If you don't attack from the back 
 To the million march... hehehehe

 Mashin down the boulevard downtown movin' like crazy 
 In the fastlane, I've been shinin 
 Tryna keep the timin on the track 
 With the diamond in the back 
 Move roof wide open, scopin, lockin 
 The bitches relieve, the hoes keep hopin 
 They can get it, fit in, back seat, just sit in 
 Four hoes on a black tryna put their bid in 
 Girl, put it to work, you gon' do the damn thing 
 Happen, the rest of y'all, eat dirt 
 I'm rollin' in the "Mackmobile", I'm back for real 
 One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal 
 Back wheel-spinnin, number one, I'm winnin' 
 Hoes lookin' inside, and they just to grinnin 
 Waitin' to choose, while the rest wait to pay y'all dues 
 Don't trip I keep my hoes in two

 Niggas better watch out and bitches better move it 
 Yeah baby, you gots ta move your groove 
 To prove that you supposed to groove in the moon 
 As I recite naughty nothings in yo' eardrums 
 If you cruisin' up the boulevard in your car 
 Put it in park and let the dogg spark, yeah baby 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X)

 Still goin', black and white tip-toein' 
 Flash in my playa's car (why you play so hard?) 'cause I'ma Don 
 Sippin Moet, smokin' Chron' 
 Doggy wanna see that dress my locks are on 
 Pimpin' black-red, who let bag to blunt 
 Can't tell the sunset from the crack of dawn 
 Half tank of gas 
 Rollin' down the window, reach out to extinct that ass 
 Get hot, turn down the heat, burn down the street 
 My hoes love to earn my keep 
 It's only five miles left, so I whipped it 
 Skipped it, lifted it and ovedrive 
 Straight onto five, pimp nigga on the rise 
 85, 95, 100 and good night and fuck that stoplight 
 (Car crashes)
