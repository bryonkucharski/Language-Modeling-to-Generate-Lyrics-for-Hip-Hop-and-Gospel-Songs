Hustlas, ballers, players 
 Yeah, uh 
 The father figure 
 It don't stop, it don't stop 
 Uh, it don't stop 
 One love, one love 
 (J.t. the bigga figga) 
 I was raised in the inner city by ballers with diamonds 
 Climbin the benzes, rollin' philles, we younger minors 
 Me, I be the one that's only 12 years old 
 Crankin off the hook from cousin, let me sport his gold 
 And I was told to put it down, and keep it real 
 Like 3x krazy young player about the scrill 
 In this California lifestyle that I live 
 Them playas is havin' money man in plushed out cribs 
 Survivin in the city is a serious task 
 Didn't know the (?) wanted, didn't have time to ask 
 'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it like the tru 
 One love to real hustlers, straight dollars for two 
 Gangstas, ballers, and hustlers too 
 Baby youngsters wanna be like you 
 You're the father figure of today 
 We need to find a better way 
 (J.t. the bigga figga) 
 We at the afterparty chillin' 'cause we ain't no punks 
 Some cats is in the back with macks and gold fronts 
 With sacks they post up, you know we be watchin 
 Thinkin' they got it crankin, playa we got it poppin' 
 Now bitin over dirty work, that ain't cool 
 With cats in drop 'vettes in mobs and old schools 
 We rob them old fools, won't you amount your scratch 
 Respect them young g's, they the ones that's strapped, ya know 
 (Snoop doggy dogg) 
 Dogg pound, that's the sound, check around, we hold it down 
 It's the super duper, yes the snoop-a 
 Comin' through, in all gray and blue 
 Kickin the game to the playas from the bay 
 All over the world and out the uk 
 Everybody around they love snoop d-o double to the g 
 'Cause I'm what they love, you see 
 I'll break em, shake 'em and I make 'em and I take em 
 To the whale, leave 'em in a spell 
 And I got a little story to tell 
 For all my homies that's locked up in jail 
 I kick it to ya give it to ya for real 
 'Cause I know y'all dealin' with the reals every day and 
 To get killed ain't nothin' to laugh about 
 But some niggas goin' out so sideways make me wanna get me a 
 Bulletproof 
 Hoo ride and slide around town in 
 But yet and still, if I get peeled 
 My niggas gon ride forver and that's real 
 Ain't no stoppin' we ain't coppin no pleas 
 We spit game for all the real g's 
 Feel up the (?) they love to have it 
 They love to take it to the dome, yeah it's on 
 (J.t. the bigga figga) 
 Meanwhile back in the lab 
 Paper was gettin' stacked, hatas was gettin' mad 
 Confidential information exchanged up on the regular 
 One dead head, two steps a my competitor 
 Catch 'em slippin 'cause they just been bought 
 Got directions to the house and the keys to the vault 
 Well let me open up this bundle of money, each off a half 
 Pullin capers with cousin snoop, kurrupt and young daz 
 In for the cash 
 Man this gang is thick 
 If one caught up in the track we can all get sick 
 And have 'em shook 
 The four o crook didn't leave a clue 
 Snoop d-o double g tell 'em what you gon do 
 (Snoop doggy dogg) (both) 
 I'll keep doin' what I'm gon do 
 With my (nigga j.t.) the bigga figga, that's my nigga 
 Representin (frisco, in case you didn't know)

 Come back with styles that are oh so nice) 
 Snoop d-o double to the g from the lbc 
 You gots to have (cash) to make it these days 
 You could make it at least a hundred different (ways) 
 I go the man and I get a (8 track) 
 Make me a beat, (smoke me a sack) 
 Roll up some fat ass uh uh uh 
 Blaze with my homies and it's (on like that y'all)
