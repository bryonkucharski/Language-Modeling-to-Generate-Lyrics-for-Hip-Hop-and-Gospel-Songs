Young Jeezy: 
 This is my muh fucking house, hey I'm by the front door 
 Here about a blond haired bitch named Sisco 
 She'll do anything for daddy man the bitch go 
 Tell 'em what the doormat read baby {Big blow} 
 Uh, Pyrex and a digi scale 
 Fuck gloves I got gay all in my fingernails 
 And I can leave a set of white fingerprints 
 Chris Tucker, Larenz Tate, Dead Presidents 
 Dead white boys spread across the coffee table 
 I don't know maybe I'll start me up a record label 
 Fuck it get high and call what's her name 
 She like to play this little game called fuck a brain 
 Lord when you talk them numbers sound sophisticated 
 It ain't nothing even the pit-bull's affiliated 
 Yeah, the trespasser's gettin' bust on 
 G shit even the coupe's got Chucks on 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Yeah, 
 This is my mother fuckin' house nigga 
 This is where I do it at 
 You got a problem with that 
 Yeah big dog nigga 
 If you ain't a big dog stay on the porch nigga 
 Dog house or nothing 
 Dog house everything nigga 
 I gotta whole house trap house and a flat 
 I'm on parole bitch so I need my pistol back 
 These rap niggas is too soft 
 I built this from the ground, the pound up 
 Until I knock your roof off 
 New boss Snoop off and on and 
 Heed him in the morning catch him while he yawning 
 My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in 
 Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential 
 Strip for your credentials 
 Mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle 
 Nah my nigga shit's official, like a Jihad, Muslim with a missile 
 Catch me in the air we close to the nickel block 
 Nigga went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock 
 Hard times bad times fuck doing jail time 
 Cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mines 
 E-40: 
 This my mother fuckin' house 
 Take your mother fuckin' shoes off when you step in my house partner 
 Matter of fact take your hat off too 
 Nigga this the round table nigga 
 If you can't stand the heat get your punk ass up out the kitchen 
 I'm in the mother fuckin' room 
 This is my house in the middle of the trap 
 Open this door I'm sweating like I ran a fucking lap 
 Customers on hold stressing they keep coming back 
 3 6 5 2 4 7 I got Jumbo Jacks 
 Would you like your cheese with that 
 Yeah I like my cheese with that 
 Crack in the pot, round the clock 
 Open all night hitchin' blocks 
 Serving that doop stuck in my loop 
 Pitching that tragic all in the traffic 
 Me and my group, me and my cabinet 
 Fillin' the coop, pick it and bag it 
 I got the key to this spot break in, you gonna get popped 
 Fuck around and get molly whopped in here, 
 Better not attract no cops 
 I got another round chopped up in here, 
 Who want what I got in stock? 
 Not from Atlanta but I got heart 
 Chickens birdies quails, baking soda scales 
 Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels 
 I'm a grinder about my grit 
 Trying to increase my profit quick 
 50 thou under the couch 
 This is my mother fucking house 
 This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking 
 This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house 
 This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking 
 This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house 
 This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking 
 This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house 
 This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking 
 This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house 
 (Repeat and out)
