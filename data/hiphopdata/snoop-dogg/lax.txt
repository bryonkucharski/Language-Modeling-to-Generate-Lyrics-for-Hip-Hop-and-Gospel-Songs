"Oh... Cali? 
 "No doubt" 
 "LAX" 
 "Oh... Cali?" 
 "No doubt baby" - [x4] 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 West West y'all, pile it on your plate 
 A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State 
 Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq 
 It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back 
 True legends, two steppin' on you peasants 
 What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests' 
 'Cause we he plug, I plug 
 Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh 
 When I dig dug - play slick and get stuck 
 But don't play tough boy, go and get it up 
 Hey yo Cube, tell me this 
 Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch? 
 Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch 
 Nine months later cause got mirked by a bitch 
 See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna 
 Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner 
 Welcome to California 
 "LAX" 
 "Oh... Cali?"

 (Ice Cube) 
 Come hit the town, drop down nigga 
 L-A-X, top down nigga 
 I'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what? 
 I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up 
 Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up 
 Never thought Ice Cube would show up 
 But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up 
 With a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up 
 I got my hustle down, look and learn 
 See how a hot nigga, cook and burn 
 A nigga earn like David Stern 
 Mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm 
 Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood 
 For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood 
 Pick a Coast, it got to be the West 
 I live out there, from the W.S. nigga 
 "LAX" 
 "Oh... Cali?" 
 "No doubt baby"

 (Ice Cube) 
 Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he 
 Woke up chillin' in the LBC 
 I grew up in the HNC 
 But that ain't what I turned out to be 
 Understand me that I'm still a G 
 Who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary 
 Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G 
 And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Yep yep, they love him to death 
 'Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet 
 Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked 
 So gone and so blown, are we there yet? 
 You wonder why I got the S on my chest 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West 
 I used to sing "Bennie and the Jets" 
 Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets 
 From the East back to the West 
 "LAX" 
 "Oh... Cali?" 
 "No doubt baby" 
 "LAX" 
 "Oh... Cali?" 
 "No doubt baby"

 "No doubt baby"
