Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway 
 ??????? 
 Reap while I stay 
 Getting Richard (richer) like Pryor 
 Need to put the gun away 
 'Cause I got pryors 
 Its hard to stay rollin' when the world full of riders 
 Bullet tip on fire 
 Flyin down sunset 
 Motivated to win 
 Like I ain't won yet 
 Take shit over 
 Hell naw I ain't done yet 
 I LBC y'all bringin' ??? 
 Tonight it's going down like free fall 
 Chevy bouncin' up and down like a fuckin' see saw 
 Trippin' off hate no hee haw 
 All blacks locs on the loc 
 Actin' like I don't see y'all 
 Doing that shit to da mean dogg 
 When I bring it to you 
 You be like what you mean dogg? 
 Then we go back and forth like its ping pong 
 Knowin' I should just ring ya bell ding dong 
 But that's one thing about this shit partner 
 Every move is so watched by these rich boxes 
 So why should I lose all my rich sponsors 
 I'm gone then you suddenly hip hoppin 
 Shit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind 
 Pop a ?? like an m n m 
 So strong yet a nigga thin 
 Rappers stay sayin' Slim so Shady but ain't talking Eminem 
 So fuck you him and him 
 I was gangbangin before a nigga mtv 
 No facade I went from the yard to a 3 car garage 
 To instant manaj just vintage, relentless 
 I mean this I promise 
 No Suge, No Dre, Ida did this regardless 
 And that's what I'm supposed to think 
 Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink 
 Motherfucka, this crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill 
 Pushin 40s still a big deal 
 Ponytail still swanging, hair still braided 
 Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded 
 Nigga! So buzz on that shit 
 Backflip back to plack shit 
 Blue red white to black shit 
 But for the green I send a whole motherfuckin team to clack shit 
 React to mack shit 
 Problem, terrorist 
 Fuck this rap shit
