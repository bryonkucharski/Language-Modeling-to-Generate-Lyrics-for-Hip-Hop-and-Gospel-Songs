 Bitch wanna act like she ain't never been with fast lane pimpin' on 
 Nails with the French tip potato chip yup with a French dip 
 Say she wanna French kiss all on my diz-nick 
 It's cool, go on and break fool if you have to 
 What which you won't do bitch I'mma slap you 
 Stay in line ho it's a pimp affair 
 If you down to get low I can take you there 
 But you can't fake once you hit the gate 
 Shake till it ache, work that birthday cake 
 You say you wanna make it ho 
 Well quit bullshittin' and get naked ho 
 Now you always got to be hot and vicious 
 So move them biscuits and hit them tricks bitch 
 Now you got about a minute to fix this 
 'Cause I'm trying to find a bitch that's bootylicious

 Drop it to the floor and just (step yo game up!)

 P-U-S-S-Y, run a world, I'm the girl in the flesh ah 
 Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop 
 Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop 
 Same nigga talkin' all that shit 
 Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick 
 Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane 
 We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything 
 I know you like me when I drop it down low 
 Show it from the back, look back, let it roll 
 Drop it to the floor like a g-bitch supposed to 
 Shake it shake it shake it make a nigga go postal 
 But that's for fucking with a Miami girl 
 Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world 
 So nigga don't front, 'cause fat wallets and big dicks is all I want 
 What you lookin' at (step yo game up!) 
 What you waitin' for (step yo game up!) 
 Go on come on in the door (step yo game up!) 
 Drop it to the floor and just (step yo game up!)

 You drink gin (step yo game up!) 
 Is that your friend (step yo game up!) 
 Tell a nigga you with you better (step yo game up!)
