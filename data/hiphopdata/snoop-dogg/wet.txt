Big Snoop Dogg 
 Can you be my doctor? 
 Can you fix me up? 
 Can you wipe me down? 
 So I can lick you up 
 Make you give it up, Give it up 
 Till you say my name 
 Like a jersey, jersey 
 Sh-ttin' down the game 
 Be my head coach 
 So you can put me in 
 And never take me out 
 Till you can taste the win 
 Do it again and again 
 Till you say my name 
 And by the way I'm so glad that you came 
 Tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet) 
 I'm wanna get you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet) 
 Tell tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet) 
 I just wanna get you wet wet wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet) 
 Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip, 
 Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip 
 She's hot on a rainy day 
 Don't drown 
 Call me up 
 I can save you now 
 Lick your feet and kiss your mouth 
 Swisha sweet, I got your wrap 
 There's only one way we can stop the drought 
 Come with me take a trip down south 
 I can tell she's thirsty 
 I'm in the hole like a birdie 
 What you wanna do tonight 
 It's still early 
 Wanna get some food tonight 
 She's lost 30 
 I'm in between your lips 
 Like a cigarette 
 She wanna quit 
 But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet 
 I'm wanna get you wet 
 Tell tell me baby are you wet 
 I just wanna get you wet wet wet 
 Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip, 
 Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip 
 Can you, can you get me up? 
 Like I'm late for the first class 
 So I can give it to you rough 
 Like a first draft 
 Fold you like a paper plane 
 You know 'bout that paper babe 
 But f-ck them dollar bills 
 Girl make it rain 
 Holiday Inn 
 Come meet me on the 8th floor 
 Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though 
 And I, and I I apologize 
 But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip 'n' slides 
 It's a flood in your heart love 
 Girl let me pop up in your hot tub, aye 
 Every night every day 
 Sippin' on a different drink 
 Different chicks different days 
 I do it different ways 
 Where you going 
 Whatcha say 
 I want her river flowing to another lake 
 Another ocean another ocean 
 On the beach on the beach 
 I'm bout to take a swim 
 Let let me dip my feet and get wet 
 I wanna get you wet 
 Tell tell me baby are you wet 
 I just wanna get you wet wet wet 
 Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip, 
 Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami 
 Can you drip, drip, drip
