 One time don't even fuck around (and come round here)

 M L and 21st where niggas worst 
 Quick to put one in ya first 
 Before they search your pockets get that china 
 And where they got cha that's where they gonna find ya 
 They rollin' up that nigga that's the real shit 
 Or being slick can get you caught up real quick 
 Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya 
 Cause you won't see me standin right behinda ya 
 Then its times up that's how we talkin' if he come from the beach 
 Betta watch these niggas out here if they come from the east 
 Don't stop if I'm not out some where so niggas can see 
 'Cause they don't give a fuck you stuck if you ain't with me 
 My city's a beast 
 You can't walk through the beach unless you walk with a piece 
 You can't talk to police cause most police is like me 
 They get that chedda like they want it take your shit in the street 
 They want that paper out here 
 Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here 
 Enough to have somebody take your place out here 
 Fucking around without your strap sound like a bad idea

 Before they come for bullets in ya brain 
 Cause in the hood ain't nothing really change 
 They tryin' to get that paper just like uncle sam 
 And just like sam niggas just don't give a damn 
 Their mission is to leave ya ass in pain 
 'Cause they don't give a fuck about a thang 
 It's a cold game 
 That's how they talkin' if they walk on the west 
 Betta watch yo self when out there, start protectin ya chest 
 These niggas come from nowhere get to takin' ya shit 
 You get beat outside the set and that's it homie you're stretched 
 This shit is a mess 
 You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest 
 You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress (?) 
 They get that chedda like they want it with they foot in ya chest 
 They want that paper out here

 Enough to have somebody take your place out here 
 Fucking around without your strap sound like a bad idea
