Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, they don't mean a thing to me 
 I was just playin' the game 
 It was all a fantasy those gurlz 
 I got a call from this **** the other day 
 She say she just moved down from The Bay 
 To L.A. well that's great 
 We should sit down and talk face to face 
 You bring the barbecue, I got the paper plates 
 I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake 
 And when you dance the way you make your booty shake 
 Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight 
 Or a nine, okay, fine, you a dime 
 And them other **** they gon' wait in line 
 They hatin' on you how you take away their shine 
 Rewind, pay attention to the signs 
 I see money when I look you in the eyes 
 No lie, I love how you stay fly 
 So fly, send a text and I'll reply 
 And when you need that good sex, I'm the guy 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, they don't mean a thing to me 
 I was just playin' the game 
 It was all a fantasy, those gurlz 
 It was Kim, Dalesa, Vanessa, Rene 
 I don't love **** or respect what they say 
 Hey yeah, that's life 
 The Pound comin' through, get the F out the way 
 I know it's been a minute but your boy been away 
 It feels so good, take me back in the day 
 I hit the studio then back to the stage 
 The lights come on and the people start to wave 
 Then I seen this girl, she looked me right in the face 
 Like "I know you remember me and my homegirl Tanay" 
 We stay downtown in a loft on Santa Fe 
 And we your number one biggest fans to this day 
 Wait baby girl I'm the great 
 Bigg Snoop Dogg, you got to bring me up to date 
 I know a lot of gurlz rock shows in many states 
 Room 220, bring your friend and some drank 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, they don't mean a thing to me 
 I was just playin' the game 
 It was all a fantasy, those gurlz 
 Now where you gonna find a **** fresh like me ****? 
 Somebody pass the lighter so I can get this **** lit 
 She lookin' at my stones like "Damn, is he rich?" 
 I'm lookin' at her pose like damn is she thick 
 **** Them other dudes, I'm the man to be with 
 Fifty million sold, who's bigger than me ****? 
 Nobody, let me put you on to some G **** 
 Hop in the Benz, I'll get you higher than ski lifts 
 And then I'm 'bout to beat the cat up like Heath Cliff 
 Yeah, 'cause all **** need **** 
 And if they say they don't they just lyin', they wanna sit 
 Shotgun in the 500 like she the **** 
 Uh uh, hold on baby, we the **** 
 Clear blue skies, dip till you're seasick 
 You're with the one and only 
 S, yes, N, double, O, P 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, they don't mean a thing to me 
 I was just playin' the game 
 It was all a fantasy, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, those gurlz 
 Those gurlz, they don't mean a thing to me 
 I was just playin' the game
