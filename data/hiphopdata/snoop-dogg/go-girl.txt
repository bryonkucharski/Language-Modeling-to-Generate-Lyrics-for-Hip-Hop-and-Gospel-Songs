I party like a rockstar 
 I look like a movie star 
 I play like an all star 
 I fuck like a pornstar 
 Baby I'm a superstar 
 Always posted at the bar 
 Always wit' a couple broads 
 Maybe I'm just dat dat raw 
 Dawg check da resume 
 I hit somethin' everyday 
 Ask about me n' dey'll say 
 That chicko run MIA 
 Pitbull, young boss 
 That's fire, go girl wear it out 
 'Til you're tired 
 Just tryin' to pay tuition, liar 
 My corner is like HBO's wire 
 So please don't play no games 
 And baby don't say no names 
 And we can do this one more again 
 Next time you can bring your friends 
 So go get your friends 
 And I get my friends 
 And we can be friends 
 Do dis every weekend 
 We can hit your place 
 We can hit my place 
 She's on my top 8 
 I bagged her off of Myspace 
 Go girl, go girl 
 Go girl, go girl 
 Go girl, go girl 
 Go girl, go girl 
 Shake dem dice and roll em' 
 Shake dem dice and roll em' 
 When dey ask you what's dat dance 
 You say dat's the hustle man 
 Girl I wanna know your name 
 Girl who you be? 
 Don't care wif' who you came 
 As long as you leave wit' me 
 What chu sippin' on?

 Get you in them shiny things 
 Yer grill be pink

 Those Vera Wangs

 My click is full of ballas 
 We at the bar 
 So go get your friends 
 And I get my friends
