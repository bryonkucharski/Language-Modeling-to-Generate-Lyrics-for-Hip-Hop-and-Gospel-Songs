One, two, three and to the fo' 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do' 
 Ready to make an entrance, so back on up 
 (Cause you know we're bout to rip shit up) 
 Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble 
 Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble 
 Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby 
 Two loc'ed out niggaz so we're crazy 
 Death Row is the label that pays me 
 Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah) 
 But uh, back to the lecture at hand 
 Perfection is perfected, so I'm a let 'em understand 
 From a young G's perspective 
 And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive 
 You never know she could be earnin' her man 
 And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man 
 Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant 
 Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it 
 (Yeah!) And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield 
 And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel 
 Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk 
 I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom 
 Well I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creep-in 
 But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin' 
 Now it's time for me to make my impression felt 
 So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt 
 You never been on a ride like this befo' 
 With a producer who can rap and control the maestro 
 At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick 
 You know, and I know, I flow some ol; funky shit 
 To add to my collection, the selection 
 Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke 
 If you do, you'll have no clue 
 On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this 
 And who gives a fuck about those? 
 So just chill, till the next episode 
 Fallin' back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean 
 Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens 
 It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P 
 D O double-G why, D O double-G, ya see 
 Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic 
 Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite 
 Yeah, and it don't quit 
 I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit 
 (Hell yeah!) So Dre (What up Dogg?) 
 Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?) 
 We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah) 
 And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton) 
 It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention 
 Mobbin' like a muh'fucker, but I ain't lynchin' 
 Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucka niggas mumble 
 When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble 
 Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked 
 My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back 
 Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin' 
 But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin' 
 And I'm a continue to put the rap down, put the mack down 
 And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down 
 Yeah, and you don't stop 
 I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock 
 But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach 
 Puttin' the shit together 
 Like my nigga D.O.C., "No One Can Do it Better" 
 Like this, that and this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this 
 And who gives a fuck about those? 
 So just chill, till the next episode
