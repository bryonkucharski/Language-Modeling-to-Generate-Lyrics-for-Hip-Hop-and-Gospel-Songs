Snoop Dogg 
 Yo, Doc, what up my nigga? 
 Snoop Dogg, this what it is, man 
 This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta, man 
 And I think it's time for me and you to just 
 Tone it down a bit 
 Come on 
 Dr. Dre 
 Imagine it never happened 
 Imagine no rappin' 
 Imagine niggas trapped 
 Imagine it havin' action 
 Imagine how these niggas could be actin' 
 If you never got this shit crackin' 
 Imagine life so hard 
 You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god 
 You feel me 
 Imagine life on the yard 
 I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty-ass job 
 Imagine 
 Biggie 
 with his son 
 Imagine 
 Pac 
 gettin' call pop 'bout one 
 Imagine a mother struggling 
 Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son 
 Imagine life where you can't win 
 When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen 
 When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz 
 So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in 
 Imagine Russell still struggling 
 No Def Jam, just antoher nigga hustlin' 
 And no rocks on them fellas 
 Just rocks on them fellas 
 Just try and keep it bubblin' 
 Imagine niggas dressed up 
 From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up 
 I can't imagine no less 
 But it don't take imagination 
 To know niggas been blessed with 
 Hip-hop 
 Eminem 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Dr. Dre 
 Keep it moving 
 Off and on 
 Eminem is on 
 Off and on 
 Dr. Dre is on 
 Before we go 
 Can you imagine? 
 Picture years with your mom 
 Can you imagine? 
 Paint a picture in the sky 
 Can you imagine? 
 Oh lord mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells? 
 Imagine being tossed around and put in jail 
 Imagine life when you can't get from under 
 Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo' 
 Remember how they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch 
 When they kick you in your dick and take your shit 
 We actin' like they hate to see you gun ho 
 But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know 
 Imagine niggas in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E 
 And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3 
 Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me 
 Imagine you was up on top of this shit 
 Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick 
 I mean imagine we said fuck this shit 
 Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah 
 You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done 
 Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run 
 Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' off somebodies son 
 Imagine if these niggas never saw a color 
 Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other 
 All the drunk fool get us pissed on balls 
 He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all 
 Imagine that 
 Eminem 
 'Cause if I get locked up tonight 
 Then I might not come home tonight 
 Dr. Dre 
 Keep it moving 
 Off and on 
 Eminem is on 
 Off and on 
 Dr. Dre is on 
 Before we go 
 Can you imagine? 
 Picture years with your mom 
 Can you imagine? 
 Hang her picture in the sky 
 Can you imagine? 
 Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life
