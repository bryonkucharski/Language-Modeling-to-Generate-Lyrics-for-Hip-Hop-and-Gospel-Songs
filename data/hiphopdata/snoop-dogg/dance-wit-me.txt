(Marvin Gaye) 
 Get up and... oh... party, yeah 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me 
 (Marvin Gaye) 
 Groovy baby, sing a song, get up and, and party, ooh, come on girl 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me 
 [Snoop Dogg] (Marvin continues in background) 
 Can't you hear what I hear, that's the sound 
 Of the voice that you haven't heard in a while 
 It makes you wanna do the bumpin 
 I'm starvin', I went and got Marvin 
 I see the rap game is just augin 
 And at times, I'm the main target 
 Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it 
 And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it 
 (Marvin Gaye) 
 Get up and... oh... party, yeah (Snoopy and Marvin, Marvin and Snoopy) 
 I wanna sing a song, get up, and party (together at last) 
 Baby come on, come on girl 
 [Snoop Dogg] (Marvin in background) 
 It's a party over here 
 But I don't really know 
 What the party is a go 
 'Cause they trippin' at the front door 
 Let it go, slide in slow 
 But I really don't know 'cause I'm tryin' to hit the dance floor 
 And then I'm gonna go to the motel 
 Hands in the air 'cause you know I don't care 
 Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it 
 And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it 
 (Marvin Gaye) 
 Get up and oh party, yeah (Snoopy and marvin, MArvin and Snoopy) 
 I wanna sing a song, and party (together at least) 
 Baby come on, come on (and party, yeah) 
 Get up and oh party, yeah (sing a song, get up) 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me (yeah) 
 (Marvin Gaye) 
 Groovy baby, sing a song, get up, and party 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 No matter where you at 
 If you white, if you black 
 If you don't like me 
 This is somethin' to groove to, to move to 
 Made to move you, ensue you, Snoop do 
 What I do, keep it true, and ball through 
 What I make may can take years on you 
 Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it 
 And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it
