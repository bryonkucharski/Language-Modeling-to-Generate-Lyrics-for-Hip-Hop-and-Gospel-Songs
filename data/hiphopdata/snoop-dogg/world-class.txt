I'm not trying to be right try to be wrong 
 I'm just try to make it out here on my own 
 I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change 
 I'm not trying to be right try to be wrong 
 I just try to make it on my own 
 I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same 
 Every time I try to get my life to get to someone it seems 
 What you are doing try to ruin my hopes and my dreams 
 Push away and always go get away 
 Keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day 
 Am I wrong am I right 
 Do I care living life 
 On my own papa's home what am I feeling like 
 Musician premonition what you call it... 
 Do your thing with... back upon it 
 Lucky... oh how I used to be I am probably the same way cook 
 As I will probably keep the g secretly you all are backing with me 
 So we... expecting to get their photo come back stage and hit my... 
 Cool individual I am never too good... is from hood 
 Never from Hollywood 
 Growing up I don't know as much 
 I was too busy chasing money and all the stuff till I was old enough 
 Getting every dollar before... so they could know it's us 
 Every party we are showing up bagging full of... never too long nigger 
 Matter of fact you can have it the one in rotation my motivation is savage 
 ... And nigger think they are but they ain't no comparing 
 And they are not doing no harm but I think there is no comparing 
 I keep making deposits and no way no interference 
 I am your broadcast I just... just smell... when I go past 
 ... I am kind of hot but you should know that
