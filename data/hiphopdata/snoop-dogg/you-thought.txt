--Soopafly-- 
 I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever 
 Man, Soopafly never ever ever 
 Fell for the do no and you know I'm 
 Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez 
 It's too much for me to be givin' to you 
 Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you 
 Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed 
 Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew 
 Hey, I got knocked off on the bar 
 And my room got knocked off in the car 
 Gave it to me until I reached my peak 
 Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week 
 I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast 
 You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin' up too much ass 
 Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that 
 Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back 
 Ever since she tripped, I went on one 
 Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun 
 Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call 
 I wanted to break that bitch like a law 
 Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth 
 Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof 
 Then she said somethin' 'bout the cost 
 Man, that same bus stop is where 
 I dropped that bitch back the fuck off 
 You can't ride my bird 
 So I kicked that bitch to the curb 
 You best to believe 
 You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me 
 You thought you had my grip 
 But Soopafly never ever slips 
 You thought you had my cash 
 Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass 
 ...Like a pimp and that's for real 
 --Snoop Dogg-- 
 I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute 
 Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on 
 Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas 
 She fly but she wasn't the sexiest 
 She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama 
 A big bad mama-jamma, now look here 
 I like big bitches 'cause they large 
 And big bitches always take charge 
 Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg 
 Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll 
 Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of 
 Got alot of cash for a little love 
 All they wanna do is take you down to the mall 
 Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg 
 I don't see a god damn thang 
 That's stoppin' you from buying me that god damn ring 
 It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger 
 Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer 
 Your homegirl, bring her 'cause I've been dying to meet her 
 You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her 
 She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her 
 But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her... 
 It was fun while it lasted 
 You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby 
 You thought you had my grip 
 But Snoop Dogg never ever slips 
 You thought you had my cash 
 Until I turned around and whupped your ass 
 ...Trick beyotch beyotch 
 --Too $hort-- 
 I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin' 
 A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland 
 There must be some kind of misunderstanding 
 Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz 
 You think a nigga rich, bitch 
 Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick 
 For all the wrong reasons 
 Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season 
 But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway 
 If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday 
 I rolled to my house with the bitch 
 (What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick 
 Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable 
 You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe 
 So you might as well enjoy the ride 
 And serve this nigga from the eastside 
 How much for the game that I'm sellin' 
 Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen 
 I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though 
 Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable 
 Fucked all night woke up the next mornin' 
 Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on 
 Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent 
 It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money 
 You thought you had my grip 
 But Too $hort never ever slips 
 You thought you had my cash 
 Until I turned around and whupped your ass 
 ...Trick beyotch beyotch 
 ...I got family members, homeboys... 
 Muthafuckaz I look out way before you.
