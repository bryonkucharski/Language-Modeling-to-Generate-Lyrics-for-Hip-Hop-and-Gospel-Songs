 Comin' at yo ass with That's My Work Volume 2 
 If you don't you work, you don't eat 
 Yes sir, yes sir 
 Coming at you live and direct with this motherfuckin gangsta music mane 
 You thought I was gone?

 Y'all ready?

 Still going strong 
 Oh yeah 
 Nothing but the dogg in me nigga 
 Have you ever seen a Venus and Serena? 
 Baby wanna smoke with her, she gotta pop a green one 
 Hand on my Nina, leanin' in my beamer 
 No time for sleep 'cause nothing comes to dreamers 
 All I'm bout is getting it, east side reppin' it 
 Shout out to my homies in the hood that's on a different shit 
 Scrambled like I'm Robert Griff 
 Gon keep on drivin' it 
 Walk up in the strip club, 
 These hoes is steady poppin' it 
 I'm a cribglomerate 
 I get what Obama get 
 Could've been yo daddy boy 'cause I know where yo mama live 
 Put the kids to bed, take a bleezy to the head 
 Yeah, that's what the homie said 
 Word of mouth, the streets talkin' 
 I'm in the C-Town, dickin' down the sea hawk 
 She love the way a G talk, conversation, demonstration 
 Hit er with that street walk 
 Crill? 
 Yeah man 
 I know you thought 
 You thought you thought huh? 
 I ain't went nowhere homie 
 I gotta stay true to what I do, ya dig? 
 Back up on my good foot, feelin' like an actor 
 Back in '88, sold yogurt out the wrapper 
 Then I became a rapper 
 Money up front but I guide it up to back er 
 New shoes, new clothes 
 All for the fuck of it 
 Played my cards right so it's safe to say I struck it rich 
 Givin' back, takin' care of everybody 
 I'm doin' bad, homie don't you worry 'bout it 
 Walk the walk and try to talk the talk 
 I'm tryin' to give you more than just food for thought 
 If you movin while you grooving 
 Hopin' that you won't get caught 
 Never let 'em know about it 
 Only let 'em hear about it 
 Hit that paper, read about it 
 Word of mouth, the streets talkin' 
 I'm in the D-Town, droppin' off a sea hawk 
 Hit her with some G talk 
 And slide off with that east side long beach sea walk, ya dig? 
 That's my work 
 I'm in overtime mode 
 You call this time and a half 
 Snoop, Drama
