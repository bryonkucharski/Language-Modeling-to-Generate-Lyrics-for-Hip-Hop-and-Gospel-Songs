Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?) 
 (Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww) 
 (*Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce*) 
 *Repeat* 
 Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg 
 Shucks, stompin in my big blue chucks 
 More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditchin you clutz 
 Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumpin your sounds 
 It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around 
 Relax your mind and let your conscience be free 
 And get down, stompin grounds is the LBC 
 I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked 
 But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap 
 Watch your head, I break wit 
 Wit G's, Muslims, hardheads and dreds 
 Bounce, rock while rollerskatin 
 On them 20 inch tyres wit the platinum Daytons 
 I'm not that BG poppin' all that junk 
 About "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk 
 I been there and done that, no inspiration 
 All day illustration beat conversation 
 Verse 2: Snoop Dogg 
 I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond 
 Been workin on ya new album for two years strong 
 And still can't come up with the right song 
 You know what they say:'Study long, study long' 
 All aboard the train so come along 
 'Cause we keep the glue stuff against the bone 
 It's all right ain't no room for wrong 
 Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home 
 I got money loads by the barrels 
 I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro 
 I'm international money maker, player hater 
 Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler 
 At a player though 'cause players know the real from the fake 
 You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state 
 I give you people what you like 
 What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic 
 Verse 3: Snoop Dogg 
 Killin' up crews, give 'em the real street blues 
 Have 'em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes 
 Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah 
 Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue 
 I lay conversation on wax and CD's 
 BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission 
 Makin' biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season 
 Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uh 
 I represent the LBC-meant 
 Windows tint, nigga that's the president 
 I hit you with a tune every blue moon 
 Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face 
 Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate 
 It taste like it's laced but it ain't 
 This one puff uncut, no doubt 
 Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half 
 Shucks 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) 
 (Death Rowwww, Death Rowwww) 
 *Repeat*
