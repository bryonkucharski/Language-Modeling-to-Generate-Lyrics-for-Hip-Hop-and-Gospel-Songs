You brainwashed not to know you grew up wanting to be a pimp 
 You wanted to be a player (Right) 
 You know, you grew up wanting to be these different things 
 That are role models to you in your neighborhood, until you figure out that 
 Hold on... I'm finna be the first role model that ain't that (Right) 
 Well I had a chance to listen to the album 
 It's very chill, it definitely makes you wanna smoke some weed 
 (Oh it do?) 
 Yeah, and I don't even really smoke 
 (You wanna hit some right now?) 
 I don't know if we're allowed to do that in here 
 (We need curtains, we need curtains in here) 
 No, Snoop can do what he wanna do 
 (I don't think so...) 
 Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness 
 And there ain't no doubt about it 
 Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live 
 All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids 
 I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go 
 And poppin' on a stick like a pogo 
 My logo, is similar to the bat sign 
 Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high 
 Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game 
 With the versatility, verbability, tonguetwistagility 
 Hell yeah, they love the dog 
 Grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog

 The way I feel about Snoop 
 Look I'm back at it, melodramatic 
 A little more dope for you Snoop Dogg addicts 
 Addicted to the things I do, magic 
 Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic 
 If I wasn't invented 
 Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it 
 I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded 
 For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go 
 From mommas, babies, grannies 
 You gotta love him even if you can't stand him
