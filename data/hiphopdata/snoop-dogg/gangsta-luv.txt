 Cause Imma gangsta I grab her by the butt 
 Pull her to my side, I'm in deep 
 Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep 
 Everyday is the same thang, I creep in 
 It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in

 The boss, the Dream 
 The floss, the cream 
 The trips overseas 
 All these things really don't mean a thing 
 When I'm tearing that ass up workin you like a shift 
 I give it to you like a gift 
 You hear what that boy say 
 You wouldn't jack, give it up fast 
 Then I hit it from the back
