I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances, 
 But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst 
 To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel 
 I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst? 
 Marijuana motherfucker 
 Ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students 
 I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show 
 Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers 
 And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush 
 So without further a due let's get this show on 
 First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background 
 Every time I go out, I'm goin' to smoke out 
 I buy it don't even know the price 
 As long as I live it, come pay me a visit, 
 And I'll be somewhere up in the sky 
 My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh 
 We fly, it's not lie, that we high, till we die, oh 
 ? 
 Got a joint filled with quality shit 
 My bottom bitch smokin' with me niggers talk shit, all of 'em shrimp 
 I'm a big fish, roll a joint lick it once tell you hit this 
 Rubies on my dick, several cushions on my hit list 
 In and out these niggas bitches 
 Smokin' tree and not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business 
 You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping 
 Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen 
 Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong 
 You ain't smokin' this good, if it's fire I tell you I sold it all 
 Or wait till one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all 
 Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog 
 I show up, I show up, I show off 
 Car push to start, hit the button once it go off 
 Keep the money comin' in and the papers rolled up 
 We ain't worried 'bout a hatin' nigga they get no love 
 I go green like I was the Archbishop Don Juan 
 And blow circles 'round you suckers like a marathon 
 My gym teacher told, but I didn't listen 
 My bitch did my homework, and now I'm in detention 
 It sure beats suspension, this is my audition 
 So play your position, get the picture I envision 
 Did she mention? Snoop Dogg was made for kissing 
 A barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me 
 Pleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory 
 My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me 
 And now we prancin' on stage at the talent show 
 We flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack 
 Full of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope? 
 Principal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke 
 'Bout my money trippin' even if I fold it wrong 
 Blowin' zones with Wiz 'cause this is the protocol
