Snoop Dogg: 
 My goodness my gracious shell toe Adidas with the fat blue laces 
 Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces 
 Drink till you drop motherfucker cop 
 Old English 800 on the block 
 Way before St. Ide's came to the spot 
 Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock 
 And if we got into some shit we never pop shots 
 We'd squab scrap whatever it was 
 And live to talk about it and we get old cause 
 And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud 
 We do a house party what the fuck is a club 
 And the ese's they sold most of the drugs 
 La familia hell and [?] 
 We get money yeah and we do low ride 
 Represent it and talk nope no not I 
 That's the code in every hood that you roam 
 Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome 
 O.G. the place that I call home 
 Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome 
 Plaque in back strap in Lac 
 Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap 
 Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back 
 Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker 
 Bootsy Collins: 
 Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her 
 Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer 
 Pound for pound we were the baddest in town 
 You just had to get up for the get down 
 Some say we the next generation 
 But we lack education 
 Goldie Loc: 
 [?] Drinking mad dog 20/20 
 Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies 
 I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood 
 Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good 
 Front door kicker Glock spitter 
 Black and gold flag across my face when I get you 
 3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine 
 [?] While I listen to the grapevine 
 [?] Blue Crips all by the front door 
 East side rip riding gang banging all I know 
 Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker 
 I grew up on that crazy one five nigga 
 If you locc from my block then hop something 
 And I ain't talking 'bout no peel nigga block hunting 
 Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone 
 14 years old had to bring the shit home 
 My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up 
 Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up 
 I ain't playing with you old grand pubas 
 Peace out Rolando ran things with no [?] 
 Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper 
 Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga 
 Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin 
 The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping 
 Bootsy Collins: 
 Some say we the next generation 
 But we lack education 
 Hanging with the crew of devastation 
 Yeah but we one nation mama 
 Tally-ho and away we go 
 See you next week with a brand new show 
 When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual 
 You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential 
 Now I'm in the street 'cause I lost my sheep 
 But now I know where to find that 
 Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete 
 Standing next to me son you better take a seat 
 Can't none of you cut throats funk like me 
 You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree 
 Why oh why do I think like that 
 If I am with the dog you must be a cat 
 Now tally-ho and away we go 
 See you next week with a brand new show 
 I want the bomb I want that O.G. back 
 There's a party going on in my head 
 While I think about the blood that we shed 
 Then party uh when the player play 
 There's a party going on up in here 
 Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her 
 Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer 
 Pound for pound we were the baddest in town 
 You just had to get up for the get down 
 Some say we the next generation 
 But we lack education 
 Hanging with the crew of devastation 
 Yeah but we one nation mama 
 Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba
