You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick 
 On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg 
 And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys 
 A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery 
 Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that 
 Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick 
 (Verse One: Nate Dogg) 
 When I met you last night baby 
 Before you opened up your gap 
 I had respect for ya lady 
 But now I take it all back 
 Cause you gave me all your pussy 
 And ya even licked my balls 
 Leave your number on the cabinet 
 And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call 
 Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny 
 You can come on over, and I'll break you off 
 And if you can't fuck, that day, baby 
 Just lay back, and open your mouth 
 'Cause I have never 
 Met a girl 
 That I love 
 In the whole wide world 
 (Verse Two: Kurupt) 
 Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke 
 I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke 
 I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me 
 Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie? 
 I have no love for hoes 
 That's somethin' I learned in the pound 
 So how the fuck am I supposed 
 To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe 
 I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times 
 And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it 
 Pass it to the homie, now you hit it 
 'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me 
 And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me 
 I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention 
 Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt 
 Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch! 
 (Chorus: (repeat 4X)) 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 (Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg) 
 Guess who back in the motherfuckin house 
 With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth 
 Hoes recognize, niggaz do too 
 'Cause when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo 
 What you gon do? You really don't know 
 So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe 
 Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch 
 Knowin' damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip 
 Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger 
 How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop 
 Doggy, I'm all the above 
 I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes 
 But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it 
 Cause you know I don't love em 
 (Verse Four: Warren G) 
 Whoa! 
 Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow 
 One for the money, two for the btiches 
 Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches 
 In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact 
 With bitches on my side, and bitches on back 
 So back up bitch 'cause I'm strugglin, so get 
 Off your knees and then start jugglin 
 These motherfuckin nuts in your mouth 
 It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout 
 Whoo!
