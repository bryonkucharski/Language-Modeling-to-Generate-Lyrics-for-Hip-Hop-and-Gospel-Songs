Hey man, don't you know 
 In order for us to make this thing work 
 We gotta get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and then start 
 All over again clean 
 Niggas you crazy! 
 Once again 
 The mighty Death Row organization committin' mass murder 
 And we ain't asking for shit, nigga we takin' 
 It, so Dre, BLAST they ass nigga 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat 
 On the streets of LA 
 Wonderin' where the pussy at 
 Straight for ya, looking for a hoe 
 Hangin' out, rolling in my '64 
 16 switches for the niggas in my hood 
 17 shells so I make it understood 
 Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut 
 Ya come outside nigga ya gettin' fucked up 
 But I told ya, Creep, Creep ya best move 
 Like Luthor Vadros, fuckn' up the west coast 
 I'm right back up in ya when ya nut 
 1-2-3 nut, from the D-are-E but 
 This is for the hoes that I used to know 
 When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of doe 
 I keep ya this and like that 
 And I, 
 Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I, 
 Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I, 
 Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
 Oh wait, that's that nigga that owe ya that grip 
 Ya, t ehre that fool is 
 Break him off proper then 
 What's up, what's happinin' ? 
 I'm the man 
 Nigga you delinquent, can I get those in? 
 Nigga, pay this nigga here 
 (I ain't got yo money) 
 Well, yo, check this out, nigga 
 What's up *slaps around some guy that owes them money* 
 What's up? 
 What's up? 
 Ya motherfucker 
 (I'll be back though, I'll be back) 
 Ya, you ain't never comin' back 
 Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
 Yeah nigga 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I 
 Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
 Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these 
 The chronic, slangin' fat keys from my block 
 And it don't stop 
 Tell me where ya want to go 
 To the strip 
 Or take a trip bawlin' with the row 
 My shit off in ya system 
 Indo smoke in ya lungs, like that 
 And you can lift it, on, and a fist a bomb 
 Takin' away like hell at Vietnam 
 California, back in and on a mission, making a point 
 Ain't no fuckin' competition 
 They wish they was a runnin' up in reality 
 CPT, CAL my locality 
 It's strage how I rearrange and change the business 
 By droppin' shit like this 
 Dope, ya can't cope with the real 
 I peal, in the penitentiaries, and when I kill it goes, 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I, never hesitate to put a nigga on his 
 Back 
 Straight up, now you niggaz know where my homey's comin' from 
 So quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your biz-out, fool 
 It's 9-duce, Dr Drizzay, is sittin' on Tizzart! it don't stop 
 Treartin' buster's like a punk ass kizzart! 
 Bitch!
