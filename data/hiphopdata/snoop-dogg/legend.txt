Motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Even if I die, living Legend 
 Look at my reflection 
 Ain't no second guessing 
 Always be a legend 
 A motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Used to whip a Lexus 
 I can die right now, still a legend 
 Look at my reflection 
 Ain't no second guessing 
 Born to be a legend 
 A motherfucking legend 
 1996, I beat a 187 (Murder was the case) 
 80 million sold, and I ain't check the records 
 Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me 
 Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend 
 50 bitches naked 
 Nike ain't my preference 
 Khaki with the Chucks 
 Now look how they dressing 
 Perfected my profession 
 Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga) 
 Bury me alive, living legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Even if I die, living Legend 
 Look at my reflection 
 Ain't no second guessing 
 Always be a legend 
 A motherfucking legend 
 Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me 
 You new niggas look madder than me 
 Came up with the Doc, been around the world with 'Pac 
 Don't compare another rapper to me 
 When I came and kicked them buildings over 
 Swear I always knew I'd never be the same 
 Was born to be a motherfucking legend 
 I ain't never do it for no fucking fame 
 Motherfucking legend 
 You know what I'm repping 
 20 million, 20 years ago 
 Cuh, you was like 7 
 You ain't gotta like it 
 Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name) 
 Look me in my eye 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Even if I die, living Legend 
 Look at my reflection 
 Ain't no second guessing 
 Always be a legend 
 A motherfucking legend 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Used to whip a Lexus 
 I can die right now, still a legend 
 Look at my reflection 
 Ain't no second guessing 
 Born to be a legend 
 A motherfucking legend 
 Mix purple with the yella 
 Kobe with Vanessa 
 Did it doggy style 
 Like upon the dresser 
 Look at my reflection 
 Motherfucking legend 
 Even when I die
