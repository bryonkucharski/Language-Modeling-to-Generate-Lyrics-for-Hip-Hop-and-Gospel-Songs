(Snoop Dogg (Master P)) 
 Hey yo (Ghetto Postage) 
 Give me something that makes a nigga want to pop his motherfuckin' collar 
 (With a lil' West Coast twist on it) 
 (Master P and Snoop, ha ha, tah dow, poppin' collars) 
 (Chorus: Master P & Snoop) 
 Pop those collars 
 Pop those collars 
 Pop those collars 
 That's the just the way we do it 
 Pop those collars 
 We changed the game 
 (Snoop) 
 Slid up in the door, get up in ya ho 
 Sippin' on some Mo with Big D from the mad ass 6-0 
 Stretched out on the couch with some Mary Jane 
 Doghouse nigga, we all in the same game 
 An every nigga in my click got the platinum chain 
 Blang, blang Doggy's Angel's same thing 
 Eastsidaz same thing, rip riders ask my nephew Kokane 
 (Master P & Snoop) 
 Cause game recognize game and we got it 
 No Limit and Dogg Pound, we rowdy, get em' up 
 We bang bang 
 (Snoop) 
 On this music that we make ho 
 In the cars, the clubs, or when we smoke dope 
 We drop that shit for you kin folk 
 And poor folks no joke, loc loc 
 Blaze a sack loc, bust a back stroke 
 And pop ya motherfuckin' collar till ya break ya back loc 
 (Master P) 
 Ah dog we off the heezy 
 Snoop and P together for cheesy 
 Poppin' collars from the South to the Wizest 
 We off, see the tank around our nizeck 
 We O.G. show me love 
 And the Baker Boys started the buzz 
 Now we California livin' like Dre and Pac 
 And them No Limit boys, see we can't be stopped 
 Me and E-Feezy go way on the bizack 
 Remember Baby D, TRU it and Prizack 
 My essay homie, chop chop got the dizope 
 While me and Xzibit was ballin' by cizoast 
 I'm the black Slim Shady so don't try to play me 
 Turn a six into a Bentley and drive em' crazy 
 Roll up to Eastside back to the West 
 Represent Richmond, California to the South, respect 
 (Snoop) 
 I'll bless you before I diss you 
 Why y'all miss me, shit I miss you 
 So sweet, so sure but so low 
 So just let it all go, serious we sick of this 
 Dog homie, ask ya kids they put you up on it 
 On the corners they poppin' they collars 
 While back in the days, shit niggas used to stack they dollars 
 Make a nigga want to holler 
 Players, pimp, p-poppers, impersonators 
 Real rip riders, Eastsidaz and regulators 
 Haters come in all shapes, sizes and colors 
 But we on top of things so they can't get above us 
 Hate us or love us, we rollin' with the heat huggers 
 Thuggers, house party niggas fuck clubbers 
 With inane in my pockets, poppin' my collar pushin' and shovin'
