Everywhere I Go 
 When everyone who knows me 
 Knows that I would stand alone 
 It's all part of the game 
 The game, the game, the game 
 When you said I could move on and go 
 You said I'm weak and it shows 
 I couldn't go on without you 
 Now you're sitting in your house alone 
 Wondering why I left home 
 And I'm hoping that you know 
 Had to fake it till I made it 
 And you try to break it 
 Now you try to take it back 
 But you know that 
 I've been doing my thing 
 I've been running my game 
 And you know I won't look back 
 Everywhere I go 
 When everyone who knows me 
 Knows that I would stand alone 
 It's all part of the game 
 The game, the game, the game 
 I'm standing on my toes 
 To the sky I know 
 And you know you're the one to think 
 It's all part of the game 
 The game, the game, the game 
 We all play it the same 
 As you looked, you saw me walking out 
 You tried to knock me down 
 I would go on without you 
 Now you're sitting in the mess you made 
 Now you're feeling my pain 
 And I'm hoping that you know that 
 I'm stronger cause you made me 
 You will never faze me 
 You can never take me down 
 Cause you know that 
 I've been doing my thing 
 I've been running my game 
 And you know I won't look back 
 You know that 
 Everywhere I go 
 When everyone who knows me 
 Knows that I would stand alone 
 It's all part of the game 
 The game, the game, the game 
 I'm standing on my toes 
 To the sky I know 
 And you know you're the one to think 
 It's all part of the game 
 The game, the game, the game 
 We all play it the same 
 We all play it the same
