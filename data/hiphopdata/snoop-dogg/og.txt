Have a little party at my crib 
 And all the weed is rolled that's how it is 
 When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke 
 Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go 
 Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas 
 Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas 
 Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga 
 I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga 
 Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga 
 Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya 
 Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember 
 Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender 
 Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner 
 Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender 
 You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for 
 If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor 
 And all about this chronic leaf is what in for 
 So give your parents my apology for me again or 
 Get high like we Cheech and Chong 
 We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs 
 Roll up so we can all 
 Killer Cali is what we blow 
 OG nigga from way down low 
 Known for banging the blue C rag 
 Started off smoking nothing but Zags 
 Popping P's, chopping trees 
 501's, all of these 
 All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me 
 Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television 
 Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga 
 That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be 
 East Side Long Beach where I'm from 
 Bring your girls, all y'all come 
 Give me some, now give her some 
 It's big Mac, I love to have fun 
 You are, you are the one 
 If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1 
 Break it down, lay it down 
 Baby work that body like 
 At the pad, acting bad 
 Baby what that party like? 
 Moving so schizophrenic 
 Baby pull down your panties 
 Let the Doggy Dog ram it 
 I cram to undertsand it 
 Back room that's my bedroom 
 Make her right up in it 
 Close the door, slow? 
 I'm 'bout to slide up in it 
 Smoke something 
 Having money and blowing hella' chronic 
 Smoke I'm stunting 
 Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running 
 Sounding like a dinosaur if the stomach rumbling 
 Your bitch at the window 'cause she know I'm coming 
 She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner 
 She jump in, take her to the honeycomb 
 Stuffing kush ?, playing Megaman 3 
 Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami 
 Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family 
 She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing 
 Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston 
 So why get caught up 
 I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up 
 In sewing circles with them hoes 
 I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole 
 O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed
