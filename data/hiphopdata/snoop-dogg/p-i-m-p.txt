 Yeah bitch I got my now and later gators on 
 I'm 'bout to show you how my pimp hand is way strong 
 You dead wrong if you think the pimpin' gon' die 
 12 piece with a 100 hoes by my side 
 I'm down with that nigga 50 like I'm down with blue 
 Fuck Cu's, nah nigga motherfuck you 
 G-U-N-I-Tizzee, fuckin' with me and the D-P-Gizzee 
 Niggas in New York know how Doggie get down 
 I got my niggas in Queens, I got my bitches uptown 
 I got my business in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around 
 And got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans, from the boogie down (down) 
 That's waitin on me to return, 
 So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm (word word) 
 They love it when I get to Crippin 
 And spittin' this magni-gni-ficent pimpin' 
 I don't know what you heard about me 
 But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me 
 I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm and I'm a G 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P 
 I don't know what you heard about me 
 But a bitch can't get a crumb up outta me 
 I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm 'cause I'm a G 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P 
 (50 Cent) 
 It's G-Unit and the DPG 
 From New York City to the LBC 
 I break it down for you I'm a P-I-M-P 
 When my gun go off nigga ask about me 
 Nigga look what dun' happen since your bitch dun' chose 
 My wrist dun' froze I'll show you how I get them hoes 
 I'll spit that G that be fuckin' with their brain 
 Have 'em on a track when it's freezing in the rain 
 Scream on a bitch with the nerve to complain 
 Like bitch you dead wrong 
 If you catch a date you be warned 
 You said you want the finer things in life 
 You gotta go out and get it 
 And I'll be right here waiting when you come back with it 
 You see I was born to break a bitch 
 My instructions to make a bitch 
 I got me a New York Knicks, Celtics, and a Laker bitch 
 I got that G that make these hoes have a change of heart 
 I'm a natural I've been good at this from the start 
 (Snoop) 
 I don't know what you heard about me 
 But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me 
 I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm and I'm a G 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P 
 I don't know what you've heard about me 
 But a bitch can't get a crumb up outta me 
 I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm 'cause I'm a G 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P 
 Hoo, hoo 
 Hoo, hoo 
 Hoo, hoo 
 Hoo, hoo 
 (Don Magic Juan... talking) 
 It's goin' down now with 50, and big Snoop Dogg, and the Arch Bishop Don Magic Juan riding shotgun with Whoo Kidd, the straight up pimp. It's crack-a -lackin. 
 It's pimps up, you know it's hoes down. It's green for the money, gold for the honey. 
 We off and we runnin' with 50 and Snoop Dogg and the Mackalennium. 
 Keep it down playa. Pimps up, you know the rest. Check.
