Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 You don't like my music 
 You don't have to use it 
 Funkin' is a thing that all of us release 
 You don't have to get it 
 All you do is let it 
 Then you'll know exactly how to groove 
 You don't like my music 
 You don't have to use it 
 Funkin' is a thing that all of us release 
 You don't have to play it 
 You don't have to say it 
 You don't even have to try to sing it 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 Get the funk out ma face 
 You don't like my music 
 You don't have to use it 
 Funkin' is a thing that all of us release 
 You don't have to get it 
 All you do is let it 
 Then tell us our funk did you some good
