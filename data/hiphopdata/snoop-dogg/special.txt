{Brandy:} 
 It's the way you, 
 It's the way you make me feel 
 (Special girl, you're so special, special) 
 Baby just don't change, you're so real 
 (So special girl you're so special, special) 
 Show me that I'm special, tell me boy 
 {Pharrell:} 
 Girl you know you are special 
 I bet you were born in the sky. 
 {Brandy:} 
 Show me that I'm special, tell me boy 
 {Pharrell:} 
 Girl, you know you are special, girl 
 The hottest in my mind 
 (Verse 1: ~Snoop Dogg~) 
 I know you, and you know me 
 And this is the place that you really wan' be 
 Let's make it crack-a-lack I make it look easy 
 Life can be a carnival and imma be your reason 
 Kiss me slowly, 
 Perform quiet storm till I get you nice-ly 
 I'm puttin' out the blunt 'cause I see 
 I see that I need you more in my life 
 Than I need a bag of weed. 
 Now I compare you to a bird 
 When she fly by 
 I wanna rock you back to sleep 
 Like beddy-bye-bye. 
 Bounce in the 'lac 
 With your hand on my leg 
 Throw your bags in the back 
 I'mma show you where it's at 
 No telling if we might come back 
 You like that? 
 I figgerd out a way to catch a flight right back 
 See I ain't never flown for fees 
 Come spend a weekend overseas in Greece with me 
 Please believe 
 Repeat Hook: 
 (Verse 2: ~Snoop Dogg~) 
 You know, if you're through with me 
 Then I'm through with you 
 But you're the one who fell in love 
 And said that love was true 
 But you ain't never fake on me 
 And you think that you gon find 
 Another G like me? 
 Dem nigga's ain't gon' play 
 They gon' just hump 
 They ain't gon do it yo way 
 I can't hate and say what they gon' do 
 All I know is that I'm true 
 And know that you my baby boo 
 Let's take a chance, Go to France 
 On a 3 day cruse 
 Walk with your man in the sand like ooh, 
 It's our little rondez-vous 
 Whoopty-whoop 
 Big snoopy and ooh 
 I picture this love affair of ours 
 To last a lifetime just like flowers 
 Take a quick flick the get dressed 
 We'll head to Brazil, 
 I'll show you how it feel 
 When you're rollin' with the real 
 How it feel? 
 Repeat Hook: 
 (Bridge: ~Brandy/Snoop Dogg~) 
 We can make it, let's just stay together 
 Come together, don't go 
 Let's just have some fun and be together 
 Forever, for life! 
 Now that we're living our life especial-ly 
 I say that you're my pick 
 And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick 
 To me, I see you as a gift 
 Incredible it's edible 
 My ice cream, have a lick 
 I catch you when you fall like leaves 
 And be the one that you need 
 Come be my number one, please? 
 See I ain't never blow no cheese 
 And done no songs like these 
 I love the air that you breathe 
 You know why? (Why-Why?) 
 (Repeat Hook:)
