(Snoop dogg) 
 Yo dogg, niggas always asking me 
 "Is the muthafuckin dpgc still together? " 
 Niggas gon ask me 
 "Dogg y'all still together, I heard y'all broke up like the fat boys." 
 Nigga what, nigga this dogg pound for life nigga 
 We ain't going nowhere nigga 
 In matter of fact, you actin' foolish right now with all that shit you kick 
 Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin' foolish 
 And uh, I'm a deal with that shit dpg style 
 (Kurupt) 
 I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot 
 Now what the fuck made you think the dp divided 
 Moving on up to the top of the map 
 Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback 
 I'm moving down to block d, me and my homies 
 The dogg pound would rock overseas, immense degrees 
 No bitch niggas in the circle 
 Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin' eyes turn purple 
 (Daz dillinger) 
 I told myself watch out for my family and health 
 I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf 
 Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools 
 Old school poda dada that I knew from way back to school 
 Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty 
 Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin' it up 
 What up 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Fuckin' it up, fuckin' it up for life nigga, dogg pound, ya heard 
 If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who 
 To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue 
 You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that 
 Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback 
 The d, the p, the g to c 
 Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me 
 See niggas been rappin' but they ain't sayin' shit 
 Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick 
 Don't be foolish x2 
 (Daz) 
 You see you don't wanna fuck with us 
 Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us 
 Cause all we wanna do is put the g right back in you 
 Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew 
 And we keeps it gangsta fool, that's gangsta, keep it gangsta fool 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up 
 You niggas need to strap up or pack up 
 See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick 
 See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique 
 And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach 
 (Daz dillinger) 
 And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny 
 Homeboy you can't fuck with this 
 (Kurupt) 
 Smooth when we come through 
 The dp when we come through the gangstas is in the house 
 And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches 
 Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth 
 I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, g'd up, grey and blue 
 Dippin through on the coop, made you blue 
 Kurupt and snoop, daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique 
 We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin' I tell you how it is in the hood 
 Where all my homies at, straps in cadillacs 
 Hittin switches like e'yday, livin' like the g way like e'yday, dpg-c 
 (Daz) 
 (Snoop dogg)
