 Turn up the bass, hand me my blizzles I don't fuck with cigars 
 I got my own clothin line, and plus my own line of cars 
 I got a staple of bitches, and they all play they part 
 I got a gang of ruthless homies that gt loc'd after dark 
 Ya get it? (get it?) Get it, got it whatever 
 Got Snoop Dogg shoes suede, gator or leather 
 Ohhhhweeeee! and got a way to endeavour 
 Even if it ain't never I can give the bitch pleasure 
 My little white bitch Heather 
 She stunning, sly, slick and oh so clever 
 Never under pressure 
 Leave me money on the dresser 
 Give it to me baby so I can keep us together 
 Whether is cold, or it might be hot 
 One things for sure, I be takin' alot 
 Givin' alot, and when it comes to music I be makin' it hot 
 Shakin the spot, takin' the pot 
 Bringin' it back

 Do you remember the reign 
 Before you boy had Joey and gained growin' pains 
 Know this game, I flow this game 
 I spit it, get it, knit it, thread it and sewed this game 
 (Say Wha?) They say I came in a shady way 
 Watch how I play this game 
 Bossin up, ain't he man 
 So do it do him Jazzy fizzle 
 My young nizzle for shizzle we keep it off the hizzle 
 Do me a favor, and blaze up another bleezie 
 And tell baby over there to come and please me 
 She won't believe me 
 She will for sheezie 
 Bitch, it's the big Snoop D-O-double geezie 
 Bucket mouth breezie 
 I got a staple of bitches so take it easy 
 I'm only fuckin' with your imagination 
 Try to give you a little small conversation 
 You know what your facin

 Y'all niggas better sit me down now 
 Welcome back to tippy tales 
 Snoopy got this shit crackin', these bitches wanna lick me now 
 Everybody minglin, dime pieces bring 'em in 
 I set the trend, fly from gators to trims 
 (WHY?) You haters begin to fuck around with the boss 
 You get nailed to the cross fuckin' around with the boss 
 I'm too hard in the paint, might as well choke up the loss 
 Hey baby grab my longest mink so Snoop Dogg can floss 
 Toss, free is the cost, I don't pay for a damn thing 
 I just pop the champaigne, kick off a pimp and campaign 
 Man, I got the spotlight on me jack 
 Now I'ma act a damn fool and I ain't never comin' back 
 King Mack-A-Hoe, Sir Break-A-Bitch 
 Grab my pimp glass and then I take a sip 
 I look around, pull it out and then I light it up 
 Take a puff, inhale it, bluff bitch now ya know it 
 (Pharrell Williams) 
 I walk with a limp, eat lobster and shrimp 
 Shine a spotlight down on a pimp 
 Pull up like a mack, in my Snoop DeVille 
 And ride on the side, and we's dressed to kill 
 You see me stoppin' girl, get your ass to the side 
 It ain't enough room to fit ya all in my ride" 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Dave cut the record down to the bone 
 And Jazzy Phe got me rockin' on the microphone 
 Now we talkin' autographs, cheers and laughs 
 Champaigne, caviar and bubble baths
