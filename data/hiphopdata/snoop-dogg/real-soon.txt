It's been eighteen years since, I've seen you on the streets 
 You're up for parole heard the word this week 
 My cousin, Flip come at home damn it's been so long 
 Keep ya eyes on the prize, homie keep ya head strong 
 Seen in your packages, kite keep you straight 
 Deep in this caleseri, fat till it date 
 So we can chop it up, so we can spread the ice and 
 The ties of no g's is for sure, you know I like it 
 This is a D.P.G. dedication 
 Is for my homies on parole or probation 
 And you can catch the case homie on vacations 
 It's for the rainy or so you just bang 
 To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out 
 Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught 
 One love, East Side, that's how we do ride 
 D.P.G.C. we do or die 
 Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless 
 When we was out, we was rockin', yes 
 But guess what? Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin' 
 And every nigga in the click straight rollin' 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 (Real soon) 
 Just a little bit of game ain't a damn thang 
 Let the heat around, bang, dogg pound gang swang 
 Why with me, let me show ya how D.P. do G.C. that 
 That's Kurupt, Nate, Snoop, the homies might flash 
 Kick, pack, send it 'bout five above and pass 
 All I wanna do is D.P.G. 
 And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets 
 Bump it gettn' da high to the one two step 
 Make the whole spot stop, been hittn' the ball next 
 Me and Darren ridin' side by side 
 Nate and Snoop ridin' one in front from behind 
 To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out 
 Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught 
 One love, East Side, that's how we do ride 
 D.P.G.C. we do or die 
 Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless 
 When we was out, we was rockin', yes 
 But guess what? Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin' 
 And every nigga in the click straight rollin' 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 (Real soon) 
 Out up on the streets tryn' come on up 
 Got caught sleepin' and got cut the hell up 
 Just tryn' to make some money hit my ride 
 Cheddar for my baby then live right 
 Got me a room and a couple of rocks 
 Raised on the street, yes, the school of hard knocks 
 Nigga better pay me, ready or not 
 Findin' dead bodies all on your block 
 Nigga gotta get paid and that's on the real 
 Broke, wanna smoke, then you know how I feel 
 I miss the real gangsta's and that's on the real 
 Got blacked up while chasing the squeal 
 To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out 
 Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught 
 One love, East Side, that's how we do ride 
 D.P.G.C, we do or die 
 Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless 
 When we was out, we was rockin', yes 
 But guess what?, Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin' 
 And every nigga in the click straight rollin' 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 I hope that we can be, be together real soon 
 (Real soon)
