 Drink till you're drunk 
 Smoke like a broke stove 
 Don't quit, take flight 
 I can't remember last night 
 It's aight, this the life of a superstar 
 Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars 
 Snoop be hard in the paint 
 Drink another cup until I fall flat 
 All lead and then some 
 1-5-1, done dilly 
 Really for sure that 
 I'm throw back intoxicated 
 Change over, game over, hangover, faded 
 Body Shit Miss 
 대체 어디 있으 
 꾀꼬리 못 찾겠어 
 Eeny, meeny, miny, moe catch a lady by the toe 
 안 예쁘면 예뻐 보일 때까지 빠라삐리뽀 
 Drink it up and get sick 
 Bottom's up, get wasted 
 Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up 
 Oh my God, dammit, there's the fucking limit 
 Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up 
 (받으시오) 
 But I can't stop 
 Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off 
 (받으시오) 
 And I can't quit 
 I wake up in the morning do the same shit 
 Wake up in the morning do the same shit

 Waking and baking, shaking the fleas 
 Caking and baking, raking the cheese 
 Early in the morning in the bathroom on my knees 
 Tipping and dripping, flipping the flow 
 Whipping and dripping a drink on the floor 
 This is the only way that I was taught a long time ago 
 Seoul, Korea, you'll see a G-a like me-a 
 Never would there ever be another like he-a 
 G-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say 
 I done smoked my whole day 
 베이비 나를 시험해, 어서 나를 시험해 
 거시기가 거시기하니 거시기하고 거시기해 
 내일은 없다 에라 (에라) 
 모르겠다 내 배를 째라 (째라) 
 내일의 나는 오늘의 너를 백프로 몰라 (몰라) 에
