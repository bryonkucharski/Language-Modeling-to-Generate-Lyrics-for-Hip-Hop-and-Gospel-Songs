Let's roll out to Miami and get the money 
 Baby how that sound? 
 When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin 
 When I'm feelin' low I'm sippin' on some brown 
 Won't you come trips to California? 
 We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down 
 Know around the world'll get nasty 
 And I'mma be right there, as long as where it's 
 That's where the cash be 
 Cash be 
 And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be 
 Yeah yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 That's where the cash be 
 Mula, fetty, you not ready 
 I'mma get the cheese but the bread was spaghetti 
 Letti said he can play with them broads 
 Opportunistic I stay on them hoes 
 I ain't got time to be hanging with y'all 
 'Specially when there is no money involved 
 Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome 
 Point seen, money gone 
 Let's roll out to Miami and get the money 
 Baby how that sound? 
 When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin 
 When I'm feelin' low I'm sippin' on some brown 
 Won't you come trips to California? 
 We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down 
 Know around the world'll get nasty 
 And I'mma be right there, as long as where it's 
 That's where the cash be 
 Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow 
 Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh 
 El Bueno, hustle like Maino 
 All money in, no Drano 
 Can't no-body, get it like I get mines 
 Smoke papers, Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shake it, or make it 
 Never had to fake it to make it 
 Just put the pedal to the metal rock it up to get flakey 
 I'm living the fast life 
 Jet after jet and try to keep my cash right 
 I know you understand the meaning 
 Hand full of green and while the fans keep fainting 
 Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at 
 Or even in the hood where the crips at 
 Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome 
 Point seen money gone 
 Let's roll out to Miami and get the money 
 Baby how that sound? 
 When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin 
 When I'm feelin' low I'm sippin' on some brown 
 Won't you come trips to California?

 Know around the world'll get nasty 
 And I'mma be right there, as long as where it's 
 That's where the cash be 
 Cash be 
 And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be 
 Yeah yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 That's where the cash be 
 All right now, I need Passion to the stage 
 I need Destiny, Maliah, Passion 
 And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be 
 I need y'all to the stage, let's go 
 Yeah yeah 
 I need y'all on the stage, let's go 
 Work, work, work 
 In a white ghost sipping holy water 
 Always been the type to get it close to Porter's 
 After play, Barry Bonds, out the park 
 I got hits, what you mean? I throw the tarp 
 At the wall, off the wall, I feel like Mike 
 I don't miss, niggas talkin' shit 
 Say I took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night 
 Hitting that hoe quit, it was just aight 
 Uh, not at all 
 I ain't get to see the wall, I cocked 'em all 
 Fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought 
 I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car 
 Flash man, flashy this and dancing on me 
 Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup 
 Lemonade to niggas that be talking tough 
 Say you got money, I just double up 
 Multiply, fuck addition, fuckin' bitches all night 
 Macauley Culkin, rich and riches 
 This the life, they walk away, it's so delicious 
 Up in Dubai, sushi, hella bitches 
 Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas 
 Please please, tell em' I need two shots by two o' clock 
 Plus that adds about $2000, two drops 
 Pull up with my crew sellin out 
 I need a girl who will do whatever I want 
 I need a girl who will do whatever I want
