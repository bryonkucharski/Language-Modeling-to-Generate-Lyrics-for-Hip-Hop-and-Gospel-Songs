(Snoop dogg) 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 Eastside, long beach drop the hits and uh 
 We got, so many niggas on the team nowadays 
 Lb, qb, dp, gc p 
 Boy, my boys, the toys, the noise 
 Them eastside boys is the real mccoys 
 We walkin' through the projects sippin on a 40 
 Rippin, dippin, and spittin' at your shorty 
 You may think I'm outta bounds but I think I'm in 
 I holla at my folks before I step on in 
 Spit at my nigga andy hilfiger 
 Slide up in the garden, next to steve martin 
 We settin up shop on the east coast now 
 Dogghouse nigga, the big bow wow 
 And we higher than a motherfucker, east side up 
 Like this and like that motherfucker 
 Eastdide 
 So wide you can't get around it 
 So low you can't get under it, now 
 So high you can't get over it 
 I just want to make your day 
 (Goldie loc) 
 Wakin' up late off a fucked up day 
 I was in dogg sippin, straight dogghouse crippin 
 Fuck wit us and get that ass bombed out 
 Need some smoke, for the homies from the south 
 This is what it's all about 
 It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang 
 Sam wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs 
 Swerve through the eastside loc, scoop up the homies 
 Bang them other fools 'cause them busters don't know me 
 It seems like this is my only chance to get rich 
 Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch 
 Trip, bring that bomb to me 
 Underwater with cocaine, crackin' with p o p 
 Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong 
 I'm faded like cheech and chong 
 Watch out for the second hand smoke 
 (Tray deee) 
 Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah 
 Representin mines to be a true eastsidah 
 Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit 
 Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips 
 No restrictions, takin' off as soon as friction 
 Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in 
 Pimp wearin khaki suits and stacy biscuits 
 And known like capone to them gangsta bitches 
 Keep 'em workin somethin' everywhere we go 
 Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe 
 West coast to the fullest but I bang the east 
 Mad motherfuckers side to that city long beach 
 So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up 
 And know for sure I'm bouta throw the eastside up 
 And if a nigga got beef with that 
 That's where his ass'll be sleepin' at 
 Point blank
