Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E (Guess who's back) 
 Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre? 
 Oh for sure, check me out 
 It's still Dre Day, A.K. nigga 
 Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot 
 'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock 
 You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block 
 Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off 
 How nigga my last album was "The Chronic" 
 They want to know if he still got it 
 They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it 
 If you ain't up on pace 
 Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game 
 Still, puffing my leafs, still with the beats 
 Still not loving police (Uh huh) 
 Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease 
 Still got love for the streets, repping 213 
 Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang 
 Since I left, ain't too much changed, still 
 I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world 
 Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl 
 Still taking my time to perfect the beat 
 And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E [Repeat 2x] 
 Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends 
 Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again 
 Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem 
 He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week 
 Still, I stay close to the heat 
 And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet 
 My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat 
 Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep 
 Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat 
 I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat 
 It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop 
 It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru 
 I'm still at it, After-mathematic 
 In the home of drivebys and ak-matics 
 Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic 
 I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E 
 It ain't nothing but more hot shit 
 Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with 
 Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch 
 Laid back in the shack, play this track 
 I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world 
 (Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl) 
 I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap 
 Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back 
 So if you ain't up on thangs 
 Dr. Dre be the name still running the game 
 Still got it wrapped like a mummy 
 Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money 
 Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood 
 Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard 
 Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars 
 Still gonna get mine regardless 
 Right back up in ya muthfuckin ass 
 '95 plus four pennies 
 Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs 
 Smoke some with your dog 
 No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks! 
 Some of that real sticky icky 
 Ooh Wee, put it in the air 
 For you's a fool D.R.
