If it seems a little time is needed 
 Decisions to be made 
 The good advice of friends unheeded 
 For the best of plans mislaid 
 Just looking for a new direction 
 In an old familiar way 
 The forming of a new connection 
 To study or to play 
 And so the conversation turned 
 Until the sun went down 
 And many fantasies were learned 
 On that day 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Passion burning, love so strong 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Looking, learning, moving on 
 Well, the truth may need some rearranging 
 Stories to be told 
 And plain to see the facts are changing 
 No meaning left to hold 
 And so the conversation turned 
 Until the sun went down 
 And many fantasies were learned 
 On that day 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Passion burning, love so strong 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Looking, learning, moving on 
 And so the conversation turned 
 Until the sun went down 
 And many fantasies were learned 
 On that day 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Passion burning, love so strong 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Looking, learning, moving on 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Passion burning, love so strong 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Looking, learning, moving on 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Passion burning, love so strong 
 Keep feeling fascination 
 Looking, learning, moving on
