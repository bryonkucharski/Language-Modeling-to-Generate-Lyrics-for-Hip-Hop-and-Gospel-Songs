INTRO:(*mobster Corleone talking*) 
 Verse one:(dat nigga daz) 
 Yeah 
 Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face 
 The street value of that is what you dream to make 
 Run an illegal business, racketeerin 
 Smugglin, doin' things from handin a gun, is what they fearin 
 Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit 
 Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick 
 Different locations, spots where it takes place 
 If you show them my money, your ass is gettin' f-laid 
 There's four major games that run the city of G's 
 The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me 
 The violators and Gambinos they run uptown 
 Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown 
 Murder's an everyday thang in the city 
 Where you gotta plot chips, jag robberies and do in its 
 Tanadian Nay, the charge of the weapons 
 Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected 
 So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot 
 Buck 'em till they all drop, circle round the block 
 Let 'em have it as soon as they come out 
 Unload on their ass, commence to takin' them out! 
 INTERLUDE:(DAZ talking) 
 Throughout the streets of Long Beach 
 The streets was infected with drugs, dope pealers and addicts 
 Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young 
 Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime 
 They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements 
 Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs 
 From coming into our country, but they can't 
 The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount 
 Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars 
 Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion 
 Verse two:(tray dee) 
 I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin' it down 
 Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town 
 I been around since the Jumpstreet makin' it pop 
 Young crook keepin' hook, nigga, shakin the spot 
 Had to be a standout not to get ran out 
 Look for help, you help yourself 'cause there's no handout 
 Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos 
 You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes 
 Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse 
 'Cause the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first 
 Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling 
 As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin 
 I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life 
 Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes 
 Don't speak on the creep, mo' fools is listenin 
 And war story glory ain't worth the riskin 
 Real niggas still get a mob like respect 
 If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck 
 Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file 
 Under G you will see not to sweat my style 
 I'm takin' 'em out! 
 INTERLUDE:(Corleone talking some more) 
 Verse three:(snoop dogg) 
 I come through blastin, me as a Downtown Assassin 
 Mashin, may they rest in peace in they caskets 
 Shoot 'em down in front of Hassans 
 Should've known from the gate, who's the baddest? 
 In my zone, Don Corleone wanted 
 For the murder of forty men 
 Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again 
 From the U-S-C, I shift ki's, a 120 plane rides 
 Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months 
 Big business and big dollars is all that I want 
 I blaze up to celebrate, new empire to make 
 Toast till we all die, till we burst and break 
 From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums 
 We ran outta dope, I don't think so son 
 While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park 
 From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark 
 From when I pick 'em off like darts 
 Stab 'em in they hearts 
 Make an example, what I said, ya end up dead 
 Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs 
 Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die 
 All I ever want is to be left alone 
 Me myself, me my dope, me and my chrome 
 Got paid by cops and judges, I budge when I buzz 
 I got the City of Long Beach goin' crazy for drugs
