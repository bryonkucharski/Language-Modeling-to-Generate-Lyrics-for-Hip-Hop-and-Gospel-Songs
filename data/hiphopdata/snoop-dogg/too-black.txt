Do you think it is by accident that every time 
 A black leader appears on the horizon 
 With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down? 
 Malcolm, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself 
 And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard 
 All right Dason 
 It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do 
 So detached from us, these are only for you 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong 
 So cold should... gotta do wrong 
 (Chorus: Snoop Dogg) 
 It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me 
 The world is filled with so much jealousy 
 You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 You might get got, and you might not 
 Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better 
 Watch your hand and watch how you play 
 Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted 
 If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin' 
 I'ma give it to you - live and direct 
 'Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check 
 They game every day but they try to find a way 
 But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh) 
 It's the same game, from my town to your town 
 From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right) 
 To the rebel we deliver the true game 
 And niggas gettin' upset 'cause they can't maintain (player haters) 
 Don't get mad 'cause I was blessed with a gift 
 To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right) 
 Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it 
 Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited 
 So come on down and party with the pound (come on) 
 You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down 
 Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers 
 Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper 
 Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in' 
 I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it 
 And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion 
 It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians 
 And the overseas g's, please 
 Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two) 
 I gots to do ya, like ya never been done 
 It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1 
 I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all 
 Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah 
 And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself 
 And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover 
 And if you dyin', you fuckin' with your death 
 I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf 
 I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement 
 And Death Row is still the label that pays me 
 (Chorus: Snoop Dogg) 
 Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me 
 This world is filled with so much jealousy 
 I don't know who to trust cause 
 If I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm) 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I turn to the left and I turn to the right 
 I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?) 
 What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh? 
 Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the glock? 
 I knocks on the door, plus "Oh No" 
 I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo 
 Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach 
 I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn 
 Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'ma give you what you earned 
 And if you get it, watch me spit it 
 I'm committed to do it and I'm a still acquitted 
 Never ever did it, or forget it 
 This guaranteed to keep the party hittin' 
 And I'ma give you people what you need 
 And I'ma smoke up on just like a bag of weed 
 And if you into the mixture and into the rapture 
 Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya 
 Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm) 
 I'm guaranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right) 
 You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script 
 Guranteed to make the hoe's go ahead and get whipped 
 And when they stop rockin' - they won't 
 But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha) 
 You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy) 
 'Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled "The Real McCoy" 
 I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed 
 I'm guaranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up 
 I'm guarnteed to, do my thing 
 Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing 
 What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to 
 Cause this is somethin' to rock you 
 (Chorus: Snoop Dogg) 
 Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me 
 This world is filled with so much jealousy 
 I don't know who to trust cause 
 If I trust either I might, end up shot or (end up shot, hmm) 
 Seems like, (seems like), seems like, (seems like) 
 I gotta do wrong 
 Seems like, (seems like, uh), I gotta do wrong
