(John Legend - hook) 
 And I can see it with my eyes closed, now 
 Feeling like my life froze 
 I'm about to hit the ground 
 (Snoop Dogg - Verse 1) 
 Sippin? yac while I elevate my mind state 
 Hand by the burner in case a n-gga try to violate 
 Never going down, stay rising like Andre 
 Cause my corner back every thing the Don say 
 Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song 
 Err?y day, err?y night till I'm carried home 
 Forever known, big ballin?, try it in the city 
 Then yelling out swish way before it in the net 
 And I ain't knocking a n-ggas hustle, it's all a game 
 And when they mention the best, will they call your name? 
 There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between 
 You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame 
 And you ain't got to wonder where my place at 
 Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch taste that 
 One hit of the bong will blow ya face back 
 LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP 
 (John Legend - hook) 
 And I can see it with my eyes closed, now 
 Feeling like my life froze 
 I'm about to hit the ground 
 (Snoop Dogg - Verse 2) 
 I do it 'cause I feel it 
 Live it like I'm talkin'? 
 Flow so straight but wont a n-gga try and? 
 I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it 
 My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling 
 Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons 
 Breads in the bag, call it good marketing 
 Life's a bitch but I don't cartigan? 
 That's what a word to the third letter 
 Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar 
 Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather 
 Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever 
 F-ck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever 
 'Cause I don came from a long path 
 Only God knows how long the Dogg has 
 Cause like time we all pass 
 So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass 
 (John Legend - hook) 
 And I can see it with my eyes closed, now 
 Feeling like my life froze 
 I'm about to hit the ground 
 (Kanye West - Verse 3) 
 I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal 
 Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal 
 This game you could never win 
 'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again 
 Get away from me misery 
 Get away from me lonliness 
 Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness 
 Get away from me wack tracks 
 I can only make only hits 
 I'm an only child lost in the World 
 Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring 
 Its Feeling like hell rings 
 Bringing me back down 
 Checking my background 
 Its ironic what's happening 
 Imagine if I didn't have the ends 
 I would?nt have so many imaginary friends 
 I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk 
 Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk 
 I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more 
 I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore 
 I guess everything I hate about me I see in him 
 And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again 
 Till then I'll be pouring out my soul 
 Just a few things I see with my eyes closed 
 And I can see it with my eyes closed, now 
 Feeling like my life froze 
 I'm about to hit the ground
