Get your money, man, it's hard out there 
 It's hard, hard out there, dogg 
 What, yeah, huh 
 Life life life life life 
 Get yours, get yours, get yours 
 Shootin' dice all night with a couple of G's 
 Dust off my knees, twist my cap and breeze 
 Jump in the six-four, sittin' on D 
 Spit a few caps at my enemies 
 Please, freeze, there's a new sheriff in town 
 Livin' in the projects, Dogg Pound Pound 
 No father figure, just gangbang niggas 
 'Cause they give it up quicker and they learn to pull the trigger 
 Our role models on TV 
 But most of us ain't got a TV, you feel me? 
 Shit, Michael Jordan don't come through 
 I bet that nigga get the money when it's time to sell his shoe 
 I'm telling you, I ain't puttin' him down 
 'Cause I love him to death but I ain't ever seen him in my town 
 But you could see Snoop Dogg everyday 
 I'm boss to the blocks like the projects in the PJ's 
 Yeah, for those of you who don't know 
 This is the land of the scandalous and cut throats 
 Child support: that's unheard of 
 Number one crime in the motherfucker: murder 
 Ya heard me? Hmm, I'ma stay down 
 For the get down, from a puppy to the big dogg 
 Put that on the penthouse 
 Life in the projects, bang, bang, pow, pow 
 Is how it sounds 
 Life in the projects 
 Where it's hard to get by 
 But you gotta 'cause your spot's gettin' hotter 
 Life in the projects 
 Where grass is cheese and cheese is power 
 Life in the projects 
 Where you got to have the will to know how 
 Know how to do what? Survive 
 Life in the projects 
 You got to get yours 'cause I'ma get mine 
 Life in the projects, goodness grief 
 Everybody waitin' on the 1st and 15th 
 The police man is tryin' to get atcha 
 Catcha, snatcha, open up your fridge 
 Nuttin' lookin' back atcha 
 So you open up your freezer and say 'God, please' 
 I wish we had some more of this some government cheese 
 I'm duckin' buckshots, see, walkin' on my knees 
 Ain't no trees, the grass ain't green 
 And when I say it's all bad, you know what I mean 
 There's one in every family. What? A fiend 
 And a basketball star with no team, no dreams 
 Remember Good Times? JJ and Michael? 
 And all the lil' things they went through despite 
 Nobody in the projects gave a fuck 
 Ain't no good, it's all bad luck, shucks, shoppin' poppin' 
 Back up on all the scene, from the George Down, PJ's, Cali or projects 
 And the Cabrini Greens, my niggas get wild on they ass 
 We like to pow-pow on they ass 
 Here's a toast to the coast, so take a blast 
 From the projects to the upper deck, upper class 
 A long way from where I come from 
 I know where I'm at, nigga, I can't forget where I came from 
 Life in the projects 
 Where it's hard to get by 
 But you gotta 'cause your spot's gettin' hotter 
 Life in the projects 
 Where grass is cheese and cheese is power 
 Life in the projects 
 Where you got to have the will to know how 
 Know how to do what? Survive 
 Life in the projects 
 You got to get yours 'cause I'ma get mine 
 Life in the projects 
 Life in the projects 
 Life in the projects 
 Life in the projects 
 ... 
 Yeah

 That's going through that bullshit, y'know 
 I know how y'all niggas feel 
 Nigga, Doggy Dogg feel ya pain 
 It's like I'm livin' in the motherfuckin' projects, too 
 Y'know what I'm sayin'? 
 They want y'all to throw me out my state 
 So, fuck 
 I might as well move back in the projects 
 That's where my real niggas at any motherfuckin' way 
 I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine 
 Life in the projects

 Life in the projects, feel me? 
 You better get yours 'cause I'ma get mine 
 Life in the projects, yeah
