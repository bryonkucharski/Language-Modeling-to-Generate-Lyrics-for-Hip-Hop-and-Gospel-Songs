 And I'm doin' 'bout a hundred thousand miles 
 Doggy style all in your earhole 
 Gonna get funky 'cause I know that's what you here for 
 You bouncin' your neck and bobbin'your head 
 What I'm tryna do here is wake the dead 
 Follow instructions

 Bustin' my functions 
 Bumpin', funkin', jumpin' 
 Man these suckers on the mic ain't sayin' nothin' 
 So really you ain't really gettin' nothin'

 Cold as a mother 
 All the women love him 
 'Cause they just want a piece of the Undercover Brother 
 Wanna take him home tonight 
 'Cause he's so dynamite 
 Sold him like Dolamites 
 Is that right? 
 Sure you're right 
 I got little somethin' for groupies 
 Snoopie Doopie 
 And nothin' for Bootsie 
 (Bootsie) 
 Turn it loose 
 I'm just funkin' with my nephew Snoop 
 Where you get your funk from? 
 Now let's get ready to shoot 
 Undrecover Brother, the one you will discova 
 You can't get a piece what's under his sheets 
 (Chorus till end)
