(I was raised in the hood) 
 Eastside Long Beach to be exact 
 (I was raised in the hood) 
 Where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner 
 (We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood) 
 I'll never turn my back on the hood 
 (I was raised in the hood) 
 Yeah you can take me out the hood 
 But you can't take the hood up outta me 
 (Snoop Dogg - Verse 1) 
 Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins 
 Yeah I'm stealing n-ggas, please what you know bout that 
 I do it every time, told 'em 1800 had 'em mixing it with lime (oh weee) 
 My life is like a movie, I was thuggin' in the beach when I lit my first doobie 
 In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie 
 Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi 
 Bitch, choose me, 'cause I'm going to the top 
 Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch 
 Whenever will it stop 
 I was poppin'like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block 
 East up, what it do though 
 Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean 
 Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope 
 Only 'cause I was raised in the hood 
 I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood) 
 I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood) 
 We got ya back 
 I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood) 
 I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood) 
 We got ya back 
 (Snoop Dogg - Verse 2) 
 Raised by the monsters the criminals 
 The G's, it was ? the n-ggas on the east 
 What you know bout that? 
 Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss 
 I catch a n-gga slippin' like moss 
 Ride with the realest, I've been on it since a young'n 
 It's 200 bitches in the function 
 Looking cool, you know it bitchy I'm rollin' 
 And I ain't worried 'bout them n-ggas we patrolling the hood and the city 
 Rollin' on that dilly 
 2 milly, 2 Bugatti's, call 'em Rozay and Diddy 
 Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet 
 Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around, 
 I'm a rep, East up, what it do though 
 Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip 
 I threw up the two O 
 Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope 
 Only 'cause I was raised in the hood 
 (Snoop Dogg - Verse 3) 
 Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block 
 It was plenty of them n-ggas on the spot 
 What you know bout that? 
 Turned up fully 
 The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig 
 Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out 
 The people talking the rumours 
 Now what you heard about? 
 How I spend 100 thou gettin' purped out 
 I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up 
 They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets 'cause 
 Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bru 
 What it do though, dickies for the dulo 
 Homie, you know skinny n-ggas sumo 
 Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope 
 Only 'cause I was raised in the hood
