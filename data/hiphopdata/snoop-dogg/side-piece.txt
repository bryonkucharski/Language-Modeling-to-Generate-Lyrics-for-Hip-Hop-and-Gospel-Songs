Say baby girl 
 Why don't you light some candles and put somethin' on for a nigga though? For real 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 Yes I'm the most high 
 Baby want it, Mimosa 
 I tried to reverse her, a mentirosa 
 Gov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco 
 With my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster 
 So I try to dance my life away to get it over 
 I'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober 
 Don't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight 
 I called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night 
 And if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight 
 She got it laid out with incense and candlelights 
 Your shit's on hit, officially lit 
 You're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit 
 You have no idea, what? You want me right here? 
 Are you sure that we can do this shit right here? 
 'Cause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 Good love, good sex and good weed 
 Baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe 
 Red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze 
 While aiming to please 
 Oh please, don't stop with the antics 
 High heels, t-shirts, no panties 
 Me knockin', she's rockin' the boat 
 While baking me a cake with a root beer float 
 Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports 
 Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke 
 Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary 
 Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary 
 Apartment contemporary 
 Jo Malone candles, very airy 
 Ain't that right Siri? (That's right Siri) 
 So keep sendin' that right 
 The way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 You don't have to leave 
 You can stay at my house, I aims to please 
 Just relax and breathe 
 You deserve attention, I'm what you need 
 I'm on my way, yeah 
 Just leave the backdoor open 
 I'm pullin' up right now 
 And I'mma spend the night 
 Fo' sho'
