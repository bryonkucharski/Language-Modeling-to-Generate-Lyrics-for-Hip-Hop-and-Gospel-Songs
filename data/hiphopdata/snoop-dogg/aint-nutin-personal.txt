 No limit (biatch) 
 (C-Murder) 
 Nigga, nigga I'ma rida 
 Ride with G's 
 And ship keys over seas by the three's 
 Keep an eye on my enemies 
 Snoop and Silkk 
 In da back of the Lac 
 With that AK 
 In da blue tint, with a infer-red 
 Mother fucker gonna die tonight 
 That's why I smoke weed, get high tonight 
 'Cause I'ma No Limit soldier 
 With TRU datted in blood 
 I went to jail for years, for movin, burnin da drugs 
 Murda murda, kill kill 
 If you put me in danger 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 No limit niggaz no strangers 
 I'ma tank representer till I'm history 
 Making playa hatas into a mother fucking memory 
 So throw'em up if you a soldier 
 And Snoop Dogg pass tha mother fucking dolja

 Keep my heat on the dash 
 (Snoop) 
 Now, how many niggaz you know that can fuck around 
 And die and come back 
 They get hooked up with the number one rap label 
 And rap, like that 
 Shit I can't be duplicated 
 But I'm highly playa hated 
 And I been reinstated 
 And I thank god that I finally made it 
 Fated many niggas, just to get one back 
 Remember I'm that young nigga 
 That put gangsta rap on the map 
 Never craps, only five duices 
 Mix that moet, white star, with them orange juices 
 I hang out with real niggas 
 Like Silkk and C-Murder 
 TRU niggas, do niggas 
 Like you niggas 
 Ghetto ass, lower class 
 Never hesitate to blast 
 And I'm so serious about my hustlin 
 Gots to have my cash 
 Can you imagine if I was broke 
 Shit I wouldn't be bustin' no raps 
 Id have my strap, running up in your door 
 Takin' all your dough and your gold and your cars 
 'Cause big snoop Dogg, Ain't no mother fucking rap star 
 See ima gangsta (gangsta) and you a notch (you a notch) 
 And you a sucka (bitch ass nigga), and I rock 
 I'm draped in my army fatigue 
 Blowing on green trees 
 In the navigator, and keep the heat for them playa hatas 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Now look at murda, murda, murda 
 And this kill, kill, kill 
 This shits real 
 Stay strapped and capped, to get pealed 
 And mama always told me 
 If you ain't down to ride with god 
 Down to die with god 
 You ain't no mother fucking soldier 
 No limit datted on my back and my stomach 
 'Cause ima mother fucking fool 
 Uh, show me love 
 'Cause when I make music with thugs, I make moves 
 Well I'm coming out hard 
 I was coming out large 
 Seen this guy named van 
 I bring the pain 
 Look everybody coming out stars 
 See now me, C, and Snoop in da coupe 
 In da house thinking about loop 
 I told niggas 
 Rap shit isn't bad, I blast'em, So I ask'em, I shoot 
 Just a young nigga bout raising hell and makin' mail 
 If you a trip 
 I told you I was making this shit on bail (that's cool) 
 Back up nigga, can't flame that shit like drugs 
 And see ima nigga, I'm gonna hang like a nigga 
 Bang that shit like it was crips and bloods 
 Now deal weed nigga 
 Strapped up in my fatigue 
 Can't hold me down 
 Don't even trip my nigga Snoop 
 If you a soldier now 
 Do what ya think bitch 
 For this tank bitch 
 I stay quick and work 
 And I got No Limit scattered on my fucking forehead 
 That's why I do so much dirt
