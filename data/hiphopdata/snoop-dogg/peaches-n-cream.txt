She's 'bout to go in 
 She likes that low end 
 Damn, her ass is so big 
 Just keep it bumpin' 
 Peaches and cream 
 She too fly for words 
 And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds 
 Shorty what you think about my return? 
 'Cause what he think about it ain't my concern 
 I ain't come for you I came for your missus 
 I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players 
 Well okay, I do it for the riches 
 But in the mean time and in-between time 
 Shorty right there gon' get it 
 If she with it if she ain't 
 Then I know her partner down 'cause her partner throwin' shots 
 Every time I turn around, and her partner bringing partners every time I come to town 
 I'm a G6er, a Maybacher 
 You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there 
 And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs 
 And when I come down he can bring it back word 
 She's 'bout to go in 
 She likes that low end 
 Damn, her ass is so big 
 Just keep it bumpin' 
 Peaches and cream 
 Uh oh there she goes 
 That's that look all on her face 
 Shorty dancing like she knows 
 She's the baddest in the place 
 Hey, hey, I wanna get with you 
 Freak, don't fail me now 
 Hey, so what you wanna do? 
 Got her freak-um dress on 
 Them newbies on her feet 
 And them bottles with the sparkles 
 So the other girls can see that she's... 
 Paid, I wanna get with you 
 Freak, don't fail me now 
 Hey, so what you wanna do? 
 I came to cut right now 
 Big Snoop Dogg and I came to get down 
 Yes, I'm internationally known 
 Libra lovin' make you moan and groan 
 Burn my gas like race cars 
 Two bad broads with the bass on 
 I never met a girl that I'd wait for 
 I seal my deal like Jay does 
 I'm all that and then some 
 Pimp real for real when I win some 
 I remember what you're thinking 
 Black shades on drinking while you're blinking 
 Something fly, white limousine 
 Make a clean getaway 
 I love the clothes, what you about 
 The way you let it out 
 She's 'bout to go in 
 She likes that low end 
 Damn, her ass is so big 
 Just keep it bumpin' 
 Peaches and cream 
 Uh oh there she goes 
 That's that look all on her face 
 Shorty dancing like she knows 
 She's the baddest in the place 
 Hey, hey, I wanna get with you 
 Freak, don't fail me now 
 Hey, so what you wanna do? 
 Got her freak-um dress on 
 Them newbies on her feet 
 And them bottles with the sparkles 
 So the other girls can see that she's... 
 Paid, I wanna get with you 
 Freak, don't fail me now 
 Hey, so what you wanna do? 
 Everybody in the world 
 Here we go 
 Fill your body with the smoke 
 And that's the way it goes 
 She's 'bout to go in 
 She likes that low end 
 Damn, her ass is so big 
 Just keep it bumpin' 
 Peaches and cream 
 Uh oh there she goes 
 That's that look all on her face 
 Shorty dancing like she knows 
 She's the baddest in the place 
 Hey, hey, I wanna get with you 
 Freak, don't fail me now 
 Hey, so what you wanna do?
