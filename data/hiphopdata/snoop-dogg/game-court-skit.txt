 (Mac Minista) 
 Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg 
 The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit 
 In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against 
 My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts 
 Of flexing his G's, popping his P's 
 Dotting his I's and crossing his T's. 
 The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit 
 In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against 
 My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts 
 Of verbal and reckless endangerment 
 From the million dollar mouthpiece; 
 And leaving these super-sap suckers, 
 Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice. 
 The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit 
 In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg, 
 Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game. 
 Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system. 
 Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather, 
 Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files 
 And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup 
 His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll 
 And charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension. 
 So all you jerks with them $11 words 
 Comin' out of your $2 mouth 
 About a multi-million dollar Crip 
 Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant, 
 And the tongue of a mack - I said, 
 He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars 
 While you suckers is lookin' for stripes. 
 His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle; 
 And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court 
 To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal.
