Chorus (charlie wilson): 
 I'm a man I gotta take care of my family 
 Fighting these pressures in my life 
 I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies 
 But these streets won't say goodbye 
 I can't say goodbye 
 To the blocks 
 Goodbye 
 To the hood 
 Goodbye 
 To the streets (to my problems) 
 Charlie: I can't say goodbye 
 To the hood 
 Goodbye 
 To the blocks 
 Goodbye 
 To the streets 
 I can't say goodbye 
 To the blocks 
 Goodbye 
 To the streets 
 Goodbye 
 To the hood 
 I can't say goodbye 
 To the hood 
 Goodbye 
 To the blocks 
 Goodbye 
 To the homies 
 Verse (snoop dogg): 
 I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy 
 Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy 
 Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy 
 They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy, 
 Let them do them take care of your own boy" 
 But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy 
 You had dreams of being a dope boy 
 Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po 
 Banging for the turf, late night huntin' 
 Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt, 
 Pay day, got the spot, got my hair cut first 
 Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church 
 Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st 
 I know since I left that it's gotten much worse 
 But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse 
 Chorus (charlie wilson): 
 I'm a man I gotta take care of my family 
 Fighting these pressures in my life 
 I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies 
 But these streets won't say a goodbye 
 Verse (snoop dogg): 
 To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made 
 Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me 
 Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me, 
 But if they think the old me ever left, then they don't really know me, 
 And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted 
 To the life, you just don't OD, shit I owe the streets before they owe me 
 Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops 
 Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man 
 In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams in what not 
 The reason I'm so nice with my hands in what not shit, you think I forgot, man naw 
 Chorus (charlie wilson): 
 I'm a man I gotta take care of my family 
 Fighting these pressures in my life 
 I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies 
 But these streets won't say goodbye 
 Verse (snoop dogg): 
 Thank god every day that the boy could spit 
 And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit 
 I know I got plenty more wars to get 
 I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids 
 But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit 
 They made me how I am, the music in the man 
 Told me that I can for the world gave a damn 
 If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan 
 Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand 
 Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man 
 The say leaders streets but they don't really understand 
 All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans 
 Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins 
 All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids 
 If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name 
 Would live... in these streets 
 Chorus (charlie wilson): 
 I'm a man I gotta take care of my family 
 Fighting these pressures in my life 
 I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies 
 But these streets won't say goodbye 
 I just can't say goodbye 
 I can't say goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 I can't say goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 I can't say goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 I can't say goodbye 
 You can take the man out the streets, 
 But you can't take the streets out the man
