 Check it out 
 (Singer) 
 The first one to hold me (yeah) 
 The first one to scold me (yes-o) 
 You never cease to teach me 
 And always try to reach me (momma..) 
 Took me to school the first day 
 Taught me how to kneel, down and pray (amen) 
 You learned me how to count from one to ten 
 And never forget, where I've been 
 Momma...

 Yeah, I love my momma

 You taught me how to care (uh)

 I love my momma (now you tell 'em Snoop) 
 You taught me how to read and write, how to fight 
 My do's and don'ts, my wills and my wont's 
 I'll never forget, the things that we went through 
 Bangin' oldies in the livin' room, sippin brew 
 Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then 
 My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend 
 Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end 
 And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends 
 Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again 
 She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again 
 She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee 
 She taught me everythang, except how to see a G 
 For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me 
 Instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound 
 I made you cry, you made me smile 
 I just wanna say I love you for life 
 And that's the reason why I'm here now 
 Love, Snoop 
 I love my momma, yeah... 
 I love my momma [I love you momma] 
 Yeah, I love my momma [I love you momma] 
 Through all the drama, yeah, yo, yeah, I love you [I love you] 
 Momma, momma, momma, momma, I love my momma 
 Momma, I love you momma 
 I love you momma 
 Momma, momma 
 (Singer) 
 Your money wasn't always long (fo' sho') 
 But your heart was forever strong (momma... momma..) 
 You taught me bout faith and hope 
 And never ever get hooked on dope 
 Momma... (I love you, I love you momma) 
 I love you momma... (throught all the drama, I love my momma)
