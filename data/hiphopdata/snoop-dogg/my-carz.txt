My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 You see I'm mean with the 16, yes you are 
 Got a big old house, bout 50 cars 
 And the ones I drive, what a hell of a ride 
 Built for a player when I lean to the side 
 My shit so dank, my paint is wet 
 'Lacs, Impalas, and Corvettes 
 Wagoners, saggin' here 
 Nigga not braggin' here, but lets be clear 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 So I figured the funk, point blank man this nigga a hoe 
 Look around, smash down, sit your ass down little class clown 
 Let me get back on the highway, try my way 
 This is the fly, way, Mass appeal, cash the deal 
 Never will I motherfuckin' crash the wheel 
 Pass the feel, the tank with the drank in the cup 
 Look baby girl, that's what's up 
 Slide by my side bitch house in the cut 
 With my 9 by side when I side in the cut 
 I shake I shook in, peep out the window, niggas still lookin' 
 When in doubt, flash that 9 get in and out 
 Take my time while dippin' out, then bang my set while spinnin' out 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 My cars, they hot, my paint is wet 
 My bitches, they bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 Let me raise mine, bang for the Fo' 
 Pop that shit nigga break it down low 
 They say the stage with more lights 
 Can the nigga re-write the whole game 
 She tried to dodge the blue ride 
 Big race tires we ride the whole ride 
 We bringin' it live to your side 
 You gonna stand outside or you gonna jump inside? 
 She said cool can my girls come? 
 We gon' drank, smoke then fuck some 
 It was 2, 3, 4, then 5, tall short thick and fine 
 And they all enjoyed the ride, Dogg could you bring us all back again 
 I love it when you put it in my back again 
 Fill up in your car then you back again 
 Cause your cars are hot, your paint is wet 
 Your bitches, they're bad, that's probably why they're mad 
 Your cars, they're hot, your paint is wet 
 Your bitches, they're bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 Your cars, they're hot, your paint is wet 
 Your bitches, they're bad, that's probably why y'all mad 
 Now look here mane 
 I got variation mane 
 I got a white one, a black one, a yellow one 
 A green one, a blue one, a red one 
 I mean I mean mane, I even got a space ship, you dig 
 You could even float with me if you want to 
 Cause that's how a real player ride 
 We ride like we ride 
 You wanna get inside, well lets ride 
 You wanna get inside, well lets ride 
 You wanna get inside, well baby lets ride 
 You ever made love in a car? You don't like when I talk to you like that? 
 You ever been fucked in a car? That sounds better don't it
