Popping, stopping, hopping like a rabbit 
 When I take the Nina Ross ya know I gotta ta have it 
 I lay back in the cut retain myself 
 Think about the shit, and I'm thinking wealth 
 How can I makes my grip 
 And how should I make that nigga straight slip 
 Set trip, gotta get him for his grip 
 As I dip around the corner, now I'm on a-nother 
 Mission, wishing, upon a star 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar 
 In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real 
 Breaking niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill 
 To the next Episode 
 I make money, and I really don't love hoes 
 Tell ya the truth, I swoop in the Coupe 
 I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops 
 But now I, make, hits, every single day 
 With, that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre 
 So lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot 
 It's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop 
 Boy it's getting hot, yes indeed it is 
 Snoop Dogg on the mic I'm about as crazy as Biz 
 Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick 
 And let me get into some fly gangsta shit 
 Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut 
 Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt 
 I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop 
 I'm fin to fuck a bitch, what's her name it's Luke 
 You tried to see me, on the TV, you'se a B.G. 
 D-O-double-G, yes I'ma O.G. 
 You can't see my homey Dr. Dre 
 So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say 
 Gotta take a trip to the MIA 
 And serve your ass with a motherfucking AK 
 You, can't, see, the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me 
 I'm serving um, swerving in the Coupe 
 The Lexus, flexes, from Long Beach to Texas 
 Sexist, hoes, they want to get with his 
 Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, bitch! 
 I'm somewhat brain boggled 
 So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble 
 Grab it, have it, stick it to the plug 
 It's Snoop, Doggy, I got a got a fat dub 
 Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc 
 Need myself a lighter so I can't take a smoke 
 I toke everyday, I loc everyday 
 With the P-O-you-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre 
 Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass 
 Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast 
 I got a little cousin by the name of Daz 
 And bitches who fuck him, gimme the ass 
 'Cause they know about the shit that we be going through 
 And they know about the shit that I be putting up 
 And they be knowing 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic 
 Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon 
 Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay 
 With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seeing 
 No I'm not European being all I can 
 When I put the motherfucking mic in my hand, and 
 You don't understand when I'm kicking 
 Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me 
 Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you want to be done 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm 
 Dumb, diddy-dumb here I come 
 With the gat and the guitar was strung, I'm 
 Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was 
 When I caught you slipping, I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap 
 Snapped back, relax 
 Ya better not be slipping with them deez on the '83 Cadillac 
 So we gonna smoke a ounce to this 
 G's up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
