Every dog has his day 
 Another thirty nine inch thick classic (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Girl, as I sit here thinking to myself 
 There is no one for you but me, and I mean that 
 And I think about all the things we've been through 
 Like arguing and fighting for example 
 You know the love we have for each other 
 It tends to out weigh what do to another 
 Ya know my granddaddy use to always say 
 Ya know he used to say it like this 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 What up motherfuckers? this is snoop dogg 
 I'm trying to figure out how the fuck I'm gonna do y'all 
 Hanging with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball 
 Giving me the word from the street, heres the scoop y'all 
 The niggaz from the eastsidaz split up (split up) 
 And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (what?) 
 Naw 'cause, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life 
 I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in wuth the real shit 
 I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit 
 Now that's the bidness, and god is my witness 
 L-B-C-2-1-3 hell yeah, we in this 
 It's so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence 
 I love y'all, like I love no bitch, and that's real shit 
 Or some CRIP shit, homie dig this 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns

 I used to have a lot broads that I doont fool with 
 I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with 
 A lotpeople that a nigga used to go to school with 
 Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it 
 But what none of them would believe though (what?) 
 That I would be bigger the kurtis blow 
 I guess he was right, these are the breaks 
 Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake 
 To realize your fate through faith, (through faith) 
 'Cause we all gonna get that day (for what) 
 To see if our lives was straight 
 And to see if we gonna walk through thosse pearly gates (yeah?) 
 To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie 
 I'm tires of being stuck here 
 If I could I would fly to the moon (zoom) 
 Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off deeze mushrooms (I know)[chorus] 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns 
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe 
 There will be, ups and downs, 
 Smiles and frowns

 Now as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say 
 I never seen him in church, but he always had the word 
 He would always tell me! sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad 
 You gotta do bad in order to do good
