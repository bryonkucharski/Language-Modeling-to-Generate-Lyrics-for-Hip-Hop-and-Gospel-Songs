My weed man got the hook up 
 Rolling up another pound every time you look up 
 Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up 
 So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up 
 Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up 
 Looking for me, I was at the crib doing 
 Don't stop 
 Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one 
 Working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up 
 With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals 
 In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it 
 Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho 
 Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho 
 Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob 
 Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool 
 'Cause they know what I got 
 I got a bag of the Saturday pot 
 And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night 
 What do you like? 
 When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life 
 Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi 
 Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that 
 Let it flow, set it go, incredible 
 That ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor 
 My weed man got the hook up 
 Rolling up another pound every time you look up 
 Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up 
 So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up 
 Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up 
 Looking for me, I was at the crib doing 
 Don't stop 
 Don't even trip 
 Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip 
 So much weight you thinkin', "Why this ain't for sale?" 
 Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails 
 She coning joints, I'm rolling weed up myself 
 Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes 
 I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those 
 Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low 
 Not too many when I roll, more arms than (Goro) though 
 Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made 
 And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later 
 Smoking getting high pays 
 I like my eyes glazed 
 Ain't empty out my ashtray in days 
 At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats 
 I roll a joint, you roll another one next 
 Can't even name a nigga colder than 
 Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then 
 Know it's the bomb when you hold it in 
 My weed man got the hook up 
 Rolling up another pound every time you look up 
 Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up 
 So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up 
 Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups 
 Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
