I put down more hits than mafioso made 
 And Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano 
 And I know, I know the way you feel 
 And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real 
 Just to get you caught up in amazement 
 We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous 
 But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack 
 And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha 
 How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan 
 Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo, 
 Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes 
 Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's 
 Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga 
 I'm Tha DoggFather 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father) 
 Repeat 
 Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?) 
 We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all y'all) 
 I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance 
 And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance 
 I'm so fly like a dove 
 I come from up above 
 You trippin' on your girl 'cause she showed me love 
 Nigga don't beat em, 'cause if you beat em, you don't need em 
 You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom 
 I delete em, but don't mistreat em 
 I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on, 
 Let me flow on 
 You can rock to tha rhythme you see 
 Or you can rock to tha rhythme of me 
 Just remember when you do your thang, 
 Make sure you do your thang on a hang 
 And everythang, is everythang 
 There ain't no mo' than this paper chase 
 Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case 
 You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh, 
 (Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost 
 I'm Tha DoggFather 
 Now, do anybody in tha house remember 
 When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!) 
 There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC 
 Am I trippin' y'all? (Hell no!) 
 Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop 
 Have prestigious women 
 That's the truth from the beginning 
 In and out of the flyest hotels 
 You say your family don't know me 
 Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos 
 Sales, tails, scales and jails 
 Success before death 
 No one in my clique fails 
 As females with the almighty Father lead 
 Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need 
 And it ain't no party like this kind, 
 Cause you can leave your worries behizzind 
 But I'ma git back to tha grizzind 
 Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and 
 I'm tha DoggFather 
 Chorus (Repeat until fade out)
