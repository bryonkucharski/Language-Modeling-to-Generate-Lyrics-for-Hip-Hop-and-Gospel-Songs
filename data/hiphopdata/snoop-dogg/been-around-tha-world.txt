Yeah, this record's for my baby, my baby boo 
 I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone 
 And you say I'll never make records for you no more 
 Well this record is from me to you baby 
 Yeah, real talk 
 Been around tha world 
 I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces 
 But baby none of them compares to you 
 Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone 
 I seen everything twice 
 Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice 
 Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice 
 I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice 
 I do it big, *** the rumors 
 Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas 
 Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami 
 I did all that, I was voted [Incomprehensible] 
 I'm sorta like Sammy 
 Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy 
 Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free 
 Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me 
 'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job 
 Until then I'm chilling at the day spa 
 Relax my mind and just chill 
 'Cause without you none of this is real 
 Baby you know I 
 Been around tha world 
 I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces 
 But baby none of them compares to you 
 Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone 
 Yeah, but now I'm back across the water 
 I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter 
 Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell 
 By my rag hanging, *** this is Crip, but I'm chilling 
 It feels so good to get away 
 Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee 
 Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that 
 What's up, just start balling [Incomprehensible], I been around the track 
 Hop in Peas with the bosses 
 300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office 
 Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks 
 Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat 
 My life is like a movie 
 But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me 
 Then I relax and chill 
 'Cause without you none of this is real 
 Baby you know I 
 Been around tha world 
 I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces 
 But baby none of them compares to you 
 Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone 
 Been around tha world 
 I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces 
 But baby none of them compares to you 
 Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone 
 Just for you baby 
 Yeah, I'm on my way home right now 
 I'm on my way right now 
 I'm leaving the studio right now 
 Yeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it 
 Matter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house 
 See you in a minute
