"The Dogg Pound and the LBC, your baby is awaiting you..." 
 [Girl]: 
 That's that damn Snoop Dogg again, he ain't nothin' but a fuckin' pimp 
 [Boy]: 
 Man snoop you got a bad curve, when I grow up I wanna be just like you 
 [Snoop]: 
 Look here little homeboy, let me tell you somethin', 
 Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me, 
 You could be a doctor, a lawyer, a football player, a laker, anythin', 
 Just don't never let me hear you say you want to be like me, 
 You hear me? 
 [Boy]:Yah Huh 
 [Snoop]:Now take these dollar$ and go giv'em to your brothers and sisters 
 And you run on to school 
 [Boy]:Thanks Snoop.
