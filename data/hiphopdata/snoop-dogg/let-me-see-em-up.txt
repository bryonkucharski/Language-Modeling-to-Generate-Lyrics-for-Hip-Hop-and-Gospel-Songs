Go 
 Swizzy 
 Snoop Dogg 
 I'm in the zone like, lockin' alone like 
 Niggas keep talkin' but I'm sittin' on the phone like 
 Picking a bone like, sittin' on my throne like 
 Niggas is wrong like, singing' my song like 
 My nigga I'm so tight, spitin' with gold mic 
 Walk through a dark cloud, came out in a strobe light 
 Rockin' a robe like, Hef with his hoes like 
 Heavy is the head but to me it's so light 
 Eat with the rich and get back to the low lifes 
 Cup with his Cool-Aid the flavor is so right 
 Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night 
 Fuck what it cost like, livin' the boss life 
 Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em up 
 Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em up 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Aye, lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em low 
 Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em low 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Aye, now that's what's up 
 I'm back in my zone like 
 Living a long life, stuffin' the bone like 
 Puffin' a long night, pingin' the pong like 
 Singin' a song like, King of the Kong like 
 Godzilla fo'realla, my killas is so right 
 If it don't go right, make sure you all ride 
 Deuce deuce and a Tec-9 with a .4-5 
 Niggas is so dead, my nigga I'm so live 
 Back in my zone like niggas hittin' my phone like 
 Shoot him some bail like, 'cause he won't tell right? 
 The homies don't act like, the homies don't act right 
 Under interrogation becomes cooperation 
 That's why I dealt like, solo and bolo like 
 Kick a little ass and talk shit like I'm Dolomite 
 Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night 
 Fuck what it cost like, livin' the boss life 
 Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em up 
 Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em up 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Aye, lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em low 
 Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see 'em low 
 Snoop Dogg
