(Silkk) 
 Hey yo Snoop 
 Tell Xzibit and Dre to be having that thing bumpin 
 When I come out there 
 (Snoop) 
 That's funky Soopafly 
 Big Snoop Dogg {Snoop Dogg} 
 Silkk the Shocker 
 Ain't No Limit to this {ain't No Limit} 
 2000 
 Gangsta shit 
 West west y'all 
 (Silkk) 
 Snoop tell them what's up 
 (Verse One: Snoop Dogg) 
 The gangstas bang, do that dame thang 
 Me and my nephew dogghouse keep it tru 
 Roll that weed, pass that drank 
 Holla at your nigga baby bring your thang 
 You could shake what you got 
 Get your pussy real hot 
 Jump in the gator we could slide to my ??? 
 Just keep it on leasy 
 I know it ain easy 
 Your fuckin' mouth greasy 
 Silkk this bitch cute, thick and all that 
 Why must I, chase the game 
 If you was me and I was you 
 You probably fuss on a nigga 
 Buring rubber in a 52 
 Most bitches do and most niggas do to 
 In the land where it all about the red and blue 
 But me I'd rather get the greenery 
 Smoke out the whole muthafucking sceanery 
 (Verse Two: Goldie Loc) 
 Why must I, be like that 
 With them [unknown] tux 
 Draped in all black 
 Takin' back like the pop lockin' [unknown] gold suits 
 Bangin' back in the day juss to get a lil Juice 
 Fuck the trus 
 'Cause we can get criped out krazy 
 Blast on all you suckas 
 Went to throw away 380 
 Fuck around get found up in a dumpster some where 
 'Cause them south side east side gangstas don't care 
 Nigga I would, fool you don't {know you don't} 
 He fuckin' with no niggas more gangsta than me 
 Tell him the truth loc 
 120 proof outs the sun roof 
 Throwing up the muthafuckin ?? 
 Tru Tank Doggs fuckin' with Bigg Snoop Dogg 
 Soopafly to keep them high so they could come out there draws 
 What you player hatin' perpitratior niggas make me mad 
 So I'm mad off you suckas and my pants never sagg 
 (Verse Three: Silkk The Shocker) 
 It ain't nothing but a gangsta party 
 You know what we bring 
 No Limit and Dogghouse 
 Ain't nothing but a G thang 
 You know, we thank the ?? 
 Y'all think moneys all out 
 Y'all better thank again 
 'Cause if ain't about money 
 Then why would I bother 
 If she ain't keepin' it real 
 Then why would I holla 
 She come over by the crib 
 House comes with a lake 
 Eat as much as you want too 
 (Unknown) 
 On my lap fo' five 
 In the trunk [unknown] 
 And the day P, Snoop, Biggie and Pac ?? 
 And the heat I got on me 
 Always got to ride with it 
 I spend money floss money 
 'Cause I can die with it 
 Project nigga 
 Get my work on 
 Host MTV with an Eastsidaz shirt on 
 I'm young like that, you know how we live 
 On the east it's 6 feet 
 On the west it's 3 wheels
