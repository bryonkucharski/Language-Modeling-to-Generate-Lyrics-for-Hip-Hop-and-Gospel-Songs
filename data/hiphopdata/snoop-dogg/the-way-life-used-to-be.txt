Take it back to the afros and the naturals 
 Cape cutter picks we slips into the back [?] 
 I'm O.G. my nigga for real though 
 Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo 
 I'm looking at the overview 
 Thinking bout 86 damn I was overdue 
 Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood 
 While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood 
 That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy 
 [?] Oops a daisy 
 Demon or a heathen scheming while I'm dreaming 
 Screaming to get even seeing is believing 
 And don't you forget that 
 Get it to you get back hit that kick back 
 Three flies one a way 
 Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say 
 Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quick trying to be grown 
 Day turn to night and play turn to fight 
 Yeah I guess my granny was right 
 Reflections of the way life used to be 
 It's all right 
 I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills 
 I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight 
 Make it back to my ride 
 Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side 
 My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo 
 Slid me away just to get me away 
 I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood 
 I'm banging riding but doing it good 
 When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering 
 As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred 
 With the dealers the killers the [?] 
 The best from the west and the beast from the east 
 Yeah I'm acting a fool 
 I'm getting my degree from gladiator school 
 I chose this life 'cause I knows this life 
 Sell a little crack and my flows is tight 
 I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is 
 I can still hear my grandma's voice 
 She say day turn to night and play turn to fight 
 Yeah I guess my granny was right 
 Reflections of the way life used to be 
 It's all right 
 If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk 
 And these was the rules squeeze on these fools 
 I came up in a different era homie 
 Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it 
 Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like 
 Now who you wanna be like 
 That fool on the TV screen 
 Or the homie on the corner getting major cream 
 In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat 
 A nigga with money don't know how to act 
 Smoke till your eyes get cataracts 
 All money nonsense yeah none of that 
 Quarter sack run it back 
 Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that 
 If a trick jump the track do you want your money back 
 Lil bitch was a bunny rat 
 Watch for the funny hat 
 'Cause it's gonna come 
 And my granny said it's no fun 
 She say day turn to night and play turn to fight 
 Yeah I guess my granny was right 
 Reflections of the way life used to be 
 It's all right
