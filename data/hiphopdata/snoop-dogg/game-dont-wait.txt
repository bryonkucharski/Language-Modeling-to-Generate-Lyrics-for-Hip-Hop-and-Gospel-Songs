[Nate] (in the background) 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 Hits don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 [Snoop] (talking) 
 Damn, g, I come to find out, all these years, man, that the game won't wait, no matter who you are, where you are, or how you, the game won't wait. it's a cold thing, but it's a cold game. you know how it is 
 [Nate] (chorus) 
 Game don't wait (the game, the game) 
 Game don't wait (the game don't wait for nobody) 
 Repeat 2x 
 (Snoop) 
 Now all I see is we, the lbc's, 213's, g's and please 
 And the reason the season, the click's off the heezy 
 Mr. warren geezy, gots to make it easy, for snoop deezy 
 To come back and drop raps that make snaps so easy 
 The most hunted and most wanted 
 With a pocket full of hundred, you know how we run it (you know) 
 (Warren g) 
 Snoop d oop pass the m I c, anticipation, 213 
 Uh, we contemplate and regulate 
 Now we got the game tight, there's money to make 
 The game won't wait but you can wait for the game 
 World wide tour with skirts screaming our name 
 (The shit don't stop cause the game don't change 
 All we gonna do is maintain) 
 (Nate dogg) 
 The hits don't stop because the don't wait 
 I got no time for no demonstrate 
 I gotta go out and buy some brand new clothes 
 Change my socks, they'll reveal my soul 
 The hits don't stop because the don't wait 
 Girls don't stop because the dick is straight 
 Let me teach what I already know 
 The hits don't stop so it's time I go 
 (Warren g) 
 Now it's the second time around, ain't no phonies or fakes 
 Let me holler at you, trying to snake my stakes 
 You older than me, you say og 
 You almost forty, trying to stay young and sporty 
 Sports you romeos'll stay in your place 
 Before you see all-stars ride up in your face 
 (Snoop) 
 Youngster never bite the hand that feeds you 
 Proceed to give back to your folks and loc's that need you 
 We do (we do) we always keep it on the true 
 213 that's the name of the crew 
 It's true that dirt I did as kid got me caught up 
 But I was brought up with the mo of the deal 
 So for your info 
 Youngster, I been doing this before I hit the radi-izzo 
 Snoop deezy is off the heezy 
 So you can make mine extra cheesy 
 The crews a twist cause it consists of 
 Three riders, westsiders, one love 
 (The shit don't stop cause the game don't change 
 All we ever wanted was a small time mansion) 
 (Chorus to fade)
