Intro:(prince itial) 
 Watch it!Watch it! 
 Daz is coming and there'll be no more waiting 
 Watch it!Watch it! 
 Kurupt is coming and there'll be no more waiting 
 Watch it!Watch it! 
 Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting 
 You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respectin 
 Verse 1:(kurupt) 
 Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind 
 Thinkin' many plots blossoms how amny times? 
 I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning 
 Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke 
 To my loccs way down in the Valley deep 
 To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach 
 To my bulls out in Philly 'cause all they smoke is phillies 
 Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches 
 Now really really ever slip or trip 
 A big shout out to my niggas in ?? 
 I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships 
 With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips 
 I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts 
 The homies catchin cases, robberies and assaults 
 It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that 
 Listen in, get elevated off the verbal contact 
 Brigde:(dat nigga daz) 
 When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop 
 Gotta get somewhere 
 When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop 
 Gotta get somewhere 
 VERSE 2:(DAZ, BAD AZZ,*unknown*) 
 My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid 
 Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself 
 Put 'em to rest, confess nevertheless 
 Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best 
 For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage 
 We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast 
 And the rest of the jungle, while mistreat 
 Any MC tryin' to fuck with D-A-Z 
 I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre 
 In '96, with a diff'rent approach I'm shit 
 I got the flavour and I'm major, bust the ass 
 Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us 
 Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya 
 When the Tek connects to ya, swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya 
 I bet'cha I won't let ya escape 
 Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area 
 When the smoke clears the area, rather we toast 
 So at home I blaze the zag or the bone 
 Once again another zone is gone 
 MCs try to step they get lit and blown 
 At the end the lights go out so before they do 
 I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true 
 Demanding my respect, respect is what I've given 
 So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven 
 To the point of no return so the streets I roam 
 Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black 
 .45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol 
 Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run 
 Or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with 
 When we bust I let loose, this is pre-meditated dick-up 
 To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it 
 With the every attempt they fail, oh well 
 Consequences get suffered, I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers 
 The bill is crisp,(the deal is) the deal is this- 
 I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips 
 Get in my way and get stepped on 
 I'm stompin, steppin with my projectile weapon 
 Wuz up (?Jex?) so's eject the hum 
 When I swarm through, who knew about the real deal I conceal? 
 But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust 
 No ho is a must!If I bust 
 My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max 
 Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs 
 We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence 
 Bringin' drama with no parental guidance 
 Eyes went deceived, somethin' up my sleeve to intrigue 
 And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs 
 When we do the do to you so go call your crew 
 And who wants to compete with technique 
 Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak 
 And what you say when I display 
 Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?), suffer from insomnia 
 And I'm a gonna be comin' for you 
 So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew 
 (Watch out nigga!) 
 Outro:(snoop dogg) 
 It's the sucker MC barbecue cookout!Cookout! 
 Watch out now! 
 Ha-ha yeah wit'cha bad self.Watch out!
