Can you feel it, nothing can save ya 
 For this is the season of catching the vapors 
 Since I got time, what I'm gonna do 
 Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew 
 What you want on Nate Dogg 
 Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone' 
 'Ain't No Fun', now check it 
 Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it 
 He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam 
 The type of female wit fly Gucci gear 
 She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair 
 When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess 
 Talkin' about baby please she wrought his service stress 
 Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer 
 The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her 
 But now he wear boots that match with his suits 
 And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap 
 And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin' 
 Be comin' round the Pound every single weekend 
 To get his beeper number she be beggin please 
 Dyin' for the day to eat these 
 She caught the vapors 
 She caught the vapors 
 I got a little cousin that's kinda plain 
 He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang 
 A mellow type of fellow best laid back 
 But back in the day he wasn't nothin' like that 
 I remember when he used to scrap every day 
 When my auntie would tell him he would never obey 
 He wore his khakis hangin' down wit his starks untied 
 And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside 
 Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad 
 Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had 
 They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta 
 Or be there in jail or some other shaker 
 But now he's grown up to be a surprise 
 D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide 
 Now the same people that didn't like him as a child 
 Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle 
 They caught the vapors 
 They caught the vapors 
 I got another homie from tha L-B-C 
 Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G 
 He cut grass trasform wit finesse 
 ... And all that mess 
 I remember when we first started to rap 
 He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop 
 He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said 
 Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted 
 Now my homie Warren still tried 
 On and on and on till the like break of dawn 
 To work at tha V-I-P would be the link 
 But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip 
 Now for the year after Regulate 
 Warren G is havin' papers so my homies write straight 
 He walked into the same record shop as before 
 And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store 
 Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it 
 Damn it feels good to see people love Warren 
 'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't 
 Now guess what they call sessy bussin 
 The vapors 
 They caught vapors 
 I got to talk 'bout me now 
 Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg 
 I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog 
 When I was a teenager I tried to be down 
 And since they wasn't tryin' to hear me I made the Dogg Pound 
 I saw a crew on 2-1 street 
 And said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said 
 No, and treated me like a wet food stamp 
 After gettin' rejected, I ain't runnin' upset 
 I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates 
 When I used to go to parties, they make me wait 
 What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight 
 I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music 
 They acted like I wanted to keep hangin' with the juzi 
 But now things switched from West to East 
 Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G? 
 'We used to see Daz, back in the day' 
 It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed 
 You caught the vapors 
 You caught the vapors 
 You got the papers
