Ya know I've been around the world and ai ai ai 
 I've met a lot of people and what I've come to find out is 
 That people are the same, they all share the same fears 
 Share the same tears, and I over the years 
 So, I'm just gon be thankful to get what I got 
 And hold onto what I have can you dig that? 
 And what I do, I do for the benefit of me and my kids 
 Dig that, 
 Talk to me 
 I'm so glad I've got my own 
 So glad that I can see 
 My life's a natural high 
 And they can't put no thang on me 
 (x2) 
 Its something kind of funny 
 How the man take your money 
 Be sure as he can be 
 Its such a way you'll never see 
 It's a terrible thing inside 
 When your natural high has died 
 What we can't turn to dope 
 And put all aside the hope 
 Twinkling tinkling braids 
 We do all sorts of things 
 While you're in a modest place 
 Your conciouses only peace 
 Yeah I had to make peace with myself you know what I mean 
 I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years 
 So I told myself I wanna know what it feels like to be high fo life 
 And I mean man I tell ya it feels real good 
 You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field 
 Doing my thug thizzle still but you know 
 Just being high for life is a different feeling 
 You should try it my brother I'm telling you it's a great feeling 
 Can you dig that 
 I can dig it 
 More and more you grieve 
 (Sing that song nephew) 
 Until you grow another need 
 You claim this fantasy 
 You'll have no reality 
 Darling take a listen 
 This may be something that your missin' 
 I know your times are funky 
 But you don't have to be no junkie
