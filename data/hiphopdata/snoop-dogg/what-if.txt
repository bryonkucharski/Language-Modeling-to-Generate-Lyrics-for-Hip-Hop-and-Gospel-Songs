Yeah, man 
 Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes 
 What if? 
 I mean, like, forreal though 
 I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like 
 What if? 
 I mean, that's a big question, right? 
 If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up 
 But what I really wanna know is: 
 What if? 
 (What if?) 
 We had a reckless motherfucker 
 That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg 
 (What if?) 
 We never had a nigga like Big P 
 From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof" 
 (What if?) 
 We never had a real woman 
 That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was 
 (What if?) 
 We had to take it 
 If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it 
 Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit 
 And where would I be without Tone, Pimp (?), and DJ Quik? 
 Act like you knew that 
 I'm glad I had somebody tell me 
 "Don't think with your dick, boy. Don't do that" 
 Come on, you know me, man 
 I pimp on, I entertain, man 
 That's why I stay inside my (?) lane 
 I gotta be careful when I show you stuff 
 Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much 
 Yo, ow give it up if you like this 
 And you prefer the peace 
 And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with 
 We pull the cards around a phony 
 My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies" 
 Because the West don't need no beef 
 We need our (?) and our roaches 
 And our Reres and our Monique 
 So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it 
 What if you talked to that man 
 And understood before you shot him? 
 (What if?) 
 The Bloods and the Crips was the same 
 And all niggas joined one gang 
 (What if?) 
 My granny wouldn't have died 
 Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side 
 (What if?) 
 You could do what you don't 
 And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that 
 (What if?) 
 A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie 
 And you know the big homie don't play that 
 Catch him, stick him 
 Rip it, ride it 
 La di da di, we shout out the party 
 The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me 
 You better off tryna do you 
 Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo 
 DP, GC, what it really do? 
 I educate when I illustrate 
 And those the words I be teachin', preachin' 
 To each and everyone 
 Never been a scary one 
 Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga 
 Reppin' my city, (?) 
 Extra extraordinaire exceptionally 
 Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate 
 My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate 
 Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly 
 Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real 
 (What if?) 
 The Bloods and the Crips was the same 
 And all niggas joined one gang 
 (What if?) 
 My granny wouldn't have died 
 Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side 
 (What if?) 
 You could do what you don't 
 And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that 
 (What if?) 
 We had a reckless motherfucker 
 That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg 
 (What if?) 
 We never had a nigga like Big P 
 From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof" 
 (What if?) 
 We never had a real woman 
 That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was 
 (What if?) 
 We had to take it 
 If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it
