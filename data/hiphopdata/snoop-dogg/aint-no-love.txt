Now $hort! I know you didn't think that shit was over, 
 You little ugly ass nigga! 
 Too $hort... 
 Nothin' can save ya 
 Ain't no love, $hort (4x) 
 Now mickity mic down 
 Guns out, mothafuckas 
 Lowin' the holes 
 It's the kid from the gutter 
 Punks get on tapes 
 And they sound so real 
 But real niggas don't get in court and squeal 
 Yeah, regard all that punk ass Racia shit 
 Got on the stand and ran your mouth 
 Like a bitch, little snitch 
 Pooh-Man did it! Pooh-Man did it! 
 He made me with it! 
 Court is in session, $hort 
 And you've been indicted 
 Hoe trusta Oakland busta 
 And you gets no love from the gutter 
 See we remember when you had to have 
 A baserock cawy and a nice hot bath 
 Smokin' and chokin', Sir Too $hort 
 Just thinkin' about the day before 
 See you never shouldn't fuck 
 With the real killa 
 I goes deep on you dopefiend nigga 
 Got on the mic and called me a punk 
 And funk is what you want 
 So there it is, junk 
 Dirty, tired, fucked around 
 And get my foot off in his ass 
 Let's hood ride, mob, fuck talkin' bad 
 No punk let's me check myself, partner 
 I ain't gonna bust ya 
 I rather ride up and drop ya 
 But the rappin' is weak shit 
 And I'm down with this street shit 
 And you ain't shit but a weak bitch 
 The ugliest nigga in rap 
 Try to cap on the nigga 
 From the mothafuckin' hood 
 So when I see you it's all good 
 Too $hort... 
 Nothin' can save ya 
 Ain't no love, $hort (4x) 
 Ant Banks: read this... 
 I boarded to your ass last year 
 But you didn't hear me dough 
 It's 94 and Banks need a little more 
 Lips lookin' hell of luscious 
 Digidy down goes my zipper 
 Nigga, you can suck this 
 And you must like slurpin' dicks 
 Because you ridin' on $hort's tip 
 Like a jockin' little bitch 
 Ridin' around in your too-$hort-hand-me-down 
 I left the Dangerous Crew 
 And that's why you're clownin' now 
 The bigidy Banksta ain't no gigidy gigidy gangsta 
 When the truth comes out you ain't shit but a pranksta 
 Try to hang in my hood lookin' out of place 
 With that blank ass look on your face: 
 (What should I do? What should I do?) 
 Now get in where you fit in, chunk 
 Can't hang on the block 
 Cause you ain't shit but a punk 
 So I ain't givin' no rule 
 To assume you want some mothafuckin' funk 
 Then bring it to the crew 
 So bring it on if your ass want to trip 
 And to this hollow-tip, bitch 
 Blast that ass, yes I would 
 Cause on the streets, nigga, it's all good 
 Too $hort... 
 Nothin' can save ya 
 Ain't no love, $hort 
 Beep, beep, beep 
 Oh, there goes my pager 
 And it's your bitch, yo, I think I best to fade her 
 Took her to the motel parking lot 
 Little light skinned bitch got just a little too hot 
 It's goin' down, pannies comin' off 
 Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted 
 I think you found out and got jealous 
 'Cause I was diggin' your bitch 
 And runnin' back tellin' all the fellas 
 But you took her home 
 And wanted to marry the bitch 
 I would dig her in this, mister 
 And bury the bitch 
 Stop spendin' all your cash and fix your teeth 
 $Hort Dog must like bein' ugly 
 Came at a nigga wrong 
 Little cavity creep walkin' around with Nikes on 
 Bitch ass nigga ain't got no heart 
 Be ready to finish anythin' your punk ass started 
 'Cause I did funk with the best 
 So when you ridin' in your lexus 
 Nigga, put on the vest 
 And stay the fuck out my hood 
 Cause death is a factor and it's all good 
 Too $hort... 
 Nothin' can save ya 
 Ain't no love, $hort (4x)
