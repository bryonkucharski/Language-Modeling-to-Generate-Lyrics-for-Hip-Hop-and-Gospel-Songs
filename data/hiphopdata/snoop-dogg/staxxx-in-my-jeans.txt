 Oh, I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' staxxx 
 You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that 
 I've been around the world, check grip in every state 
 Yo' *** don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate 
 But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread 
 Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich 
 And have yo' *** make my bed 
 My pockets fat as ***, you *** mad as *** 
 Pumps 'Neither One Of Us', I'm on some Gladys *** 
 Many have tried and failed, *** I'm out on bail 
 I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale 
 *** I went to jail, you can go to hell 
 You got some *** to tell? I got some *** for sale

 We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars cease 
 Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change 
 And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs 
 That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks 
 We put our green in ***, you spend your green on chicks 
 I'm on some player ***, dynasty, straight Laker *** 
 Cook it up on some baker *** and chop it up for some paper *** 
 I got my mind right and my money right

 And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off

 And that's the way it goes, S N double O 
 You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ***
