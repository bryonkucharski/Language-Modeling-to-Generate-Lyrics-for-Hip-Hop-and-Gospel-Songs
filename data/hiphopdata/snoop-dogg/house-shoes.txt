Dogghouse 
 Gimme some of that G shit Goldie Loc 
 Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Yeah, check this out y'all, uh huh, huh 
 We got Snoop Dogg in the house tonight 
 With the homeboy Tray Deee 
 Waniac, Trip Loc and Goldie, 4 Tay from the bay 
 What you say, what you say, huh? 
 (We do this like everyday) 
 Did ya get the dank, did ya get the dank? 
 Yeah, I got the dank, you got the gas in the tank? 
 V.I.P. status, don't need an apparatus 
 'Cause the niggas I fuck with, they all about the cabbage 
 Down in yellow brick road my destination, the dogghouse 
 Toastin' remys, fillin' jimmies, we goin' all out 
 Lookin' for the wizard, creepin' through the fog 
 Got some bad ass bitches, headed to the player's ball 
 They gon' be strippin' and wigglin' ass 
 Hope you brought your playa pass 
 Tray Deee, Goldie half dead, the twins blaze sacks 
 Bigger than big everyday in L.A. 
 4 Tay representin' for the whole damn yae, beeyotch 
 Dogghouse, turnin' it out and if you ain't dope 
 You gots to get, the fuck out, that's on the O G D P 
 (Say what) 
 And that's how it is when you fuckin' with me 
 Don't matter how you come, use all angles 
 Ties become tangled when the cutthroat strangles 
 My hookup, long rangers 
 Better float like a nationwide sky pager 
 Them hoes save us, talk about bein' playas 
 On the real, we can deal with you playa haters 
 We hit the spot, every city got a block 
 What you makin' when you take it 
 To a different type of level that it pops 
 Know the dog keep the hip rocks, steady bangin' 
 Hoes steady sangin' from the gang that we claimin' 
 Yo, it's waniac, the maniac, Trip Loc, won't you spit that rap? 
 Park my shit and jump out, I'm at the homies spot 
 To see if he floatin' with me up to the dogghouse 
 Hit the weed he lightin, outside little niggas is fightin' 
 This bomb, I'm likin' 
 Holla at my folks, I know up in the complex 
 Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed 
 Now we ready to roll, hit the store then the carpool lane 
 Once again it's on, big chiefin' 
 Remind me of the noisiest place 
 Ladies all over the place, and niggas super laced 
 How we like it, saggin' in my 5 0 1 
 Killin' my lungs, keepin' these homies and bitches on one 
 Man, I got warrants, bad tax, still sayin' fuck it 
 Headed up to dogghouse swervin' in a bucket 
 Puffin' on some bomb from my comrade blue 
 And got my little bitch, catch a contact too 
 House shoes with the blue khaki suit and my locs on 
 Swoopin' to some soopafly, gettin' my smoke on 
 Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast it 
 4 Tay on the way, plus the twins is posted 
 'Bout to set it off bet, it's off the hook 
 Straight crooks, gettin' money off the books 
 Makin' nothin' but that gangsta shit that niggas lovin' 
 Thuggin' at the house party, fuck goin' clubbin' 
 Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers 
 Let's all get the money then murder these motherfuckers 
 Cocksuckers, they can't stop us, now put up your choppers 
 Just in case they rollin' with them coppers 
 I shut 'em down, doggpound for them bitches 
 I be seein' you with snitches every time, I'm hittin' switches 
 Ice skatin' over ditches 
 I'm true to the game, plus I'm out to get them riches 
 I be mobbin' down the road tryin' to bag up my bags 
 I'm saggin' so hard, I'm tearin' up the back of my khakis 
 I'm tryin' to reach my dog dirty red 
 But this hoe won't let me know, which way to go, I'm movin' slow 
 My chucks only come with a hundred miles of walkin' 
 Hundred miles of runnin', smellin' funny and I'm gunnin' nigga 
 Doggpound gangsta crip for life 
 And we gon' party in this motherfucker all damn night
