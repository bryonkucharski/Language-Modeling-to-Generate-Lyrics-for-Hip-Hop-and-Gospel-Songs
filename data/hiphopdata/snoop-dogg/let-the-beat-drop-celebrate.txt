Let me blow the smoke all in the air 
 You know it's a party when Snoop's here 
 The ladies let their hair go down low 
 We let the whole club lights down low, down low 
 In the BBM, she checkin' for my name in the BBM 
 I used to want a all black Beamer then 
 She don't really know how I seen her then 
 The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet 
 She ain't seen it yet 
 Fuck it, let's celebrate 
 Screw it, let's celebrate 
 Fuck it, let's celebrate 
 Snoop Dogg, we celebrate 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 All about this paper while I'm rollin' up this paper, though 
 In case you didn't know, I'm blowin' on that high endo 
 Swizzy told me let it go, so I'm-a act a fool tonight 
 I'm in the building and I'm coolin' and I'm chillin' like 
 Never felt this way before, so I guess I'm-a let it go 
 Since I'm-a let it go, you better get ready for 
 More than the incredible, teach her what you gotta 
 Came for a little but I left with a whole lotta 
 Walked to the top but I started from the bottom 
 Celebrate tonight by raisin' up your fuckin' bottles 
 Smoke in the air, now everybody take a swallow 
 Snoop Dogg is that nigga you should follow 
 Let me blow the smoke all in the air 
 You know it's a party when Snoop's here 
 The ladies let their hair go down low 
 We let the whole club lights down low, down low 
 In the BBM, she checkin' for my name in the BBM 
 I used to want a all black Beamer then 
 She don't really know how I seen her then 
 The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet 
 She ain't seen it yet 
 Fuck it, let's celebrate 
 Screw it, let's celebrate 
 Fuck it, let's celebrate 
 Snoop Dogg, we celebrate 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop 
 Now let the beat drop

 Baby let her hair down when she heard that I was comin' 
 I can be your nigga, are you down to be my woman? 
 This is real pimpin', California, why you runnin'? 
 The other dudes fakin', baby, I keep it one hundred 
 Straight shooter with the Buddha, take a hit and get your mind right 
 Offered me some head, I told that little bitch that I might 
 In the mean time, let me bust and get my green right 
 We a hundred deep, goddamn I got my team right 
 We celebratin' lovin' this life

 From the underground to the roof, y'all
