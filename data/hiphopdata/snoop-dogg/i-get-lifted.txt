Good morning niff-nods and stoners 
 I would like to welcome you to Nathanael Hill High School 
 The home of the scholars, the home of the impalas, 
 And the home of the Rottweilers, 
 I'm your counselor, Warren G 
 I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees 
 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, hey 
 Overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla, 
 Rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back 
 Lick it back now, reseller, 
 Exhale, inhaler, feller, Juice is poured 
 Deuces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore 
 I can't play on your field anymore 
 Take it flight, now look at me soar 
 In and out of space with my foot to the floor 
 Higher and higher, I won't retire 
 Halfie don Kaya, Love smokin' fire tata like satellite, 
 All on the wire, 
 Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up throw it up 
 Your bitch is looking at me 'cause she probably wanna go with us 
 It's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping 
 We keep knocking, rocking 
 Dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in the zag 
 Let it burn slowly, everywhere I am 
 Nigga got a blow tree rolling every gram 
 They be like holy smokes, that man no joke 
 Can tell if it's that "eh" if he don't choke 
 Never gonna quit, every chance I'm a toke 
 Zips smelling like the whole plant in my coat 
 Fam I don' smoked fans weed and bought bags for autographs 
 Coming at me with all the names of what I gotta have 
 I got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid 
 This grown shit, having a party at my crib 
 Bring your own bitch, I got three, so matter of fact you can take one 
 And roll a joint baby girl let's bake one 
 And take this weed and I can show you how to make one, ah 
 I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees 
 Niggas know I get lifted it's high school,

 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

 Smoking on this weed, this is all I need 
 I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees 
 I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday
