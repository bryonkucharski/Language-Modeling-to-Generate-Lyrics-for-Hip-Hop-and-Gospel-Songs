Big Snoop Dogg 
 Occupation real 
 Conversation skill show you how to make a mill' 
 Pimpin' cath me on tour 
 I headline the bill with beatufil bitches, 
 I done been to brazil 
 Nigga, aks fo' real, my pockets is filled 
 Big money I'm the boss of my gangsta feel 
 They say they got the cure, I ain't takin' the pill 
 I'm a stillkeep the gangsta after fifteen years 
 Ya digg 
 Can't give it up gettin' money the way that I live 
 The king of the west coast I'm runnin' this shit 
 Big snoop dogg nigga you know what it is 
 The forty calli screw yo face like you fuckin' with this 
 No cure for the cash nigga my pockets big 
 Kush weed is the best, so why would I quit 
 High flyin in the ??

 What you thought, doggystyle all up in yo bitch 
 If there's a cure for getttin money there's the opposite 
 Never give it up, man I love this shit 
 Blunt after blunt, hit after hit 
 Six fo low ridin' with the candy kidden 
 If there's a cure fo beein gangsta I don't want this shit. 
 A mother fo the sunrise sposed to hit the block 
 Lil bad mothafucka pull the pockets pull the rocks 
 Learned to throw them thangs 
 Let me tell you why they call me snoop doggy dogg 
 I got a lot of bitches plus this nigga stay sharp 
 Now follow me, as I creep through the fog 
 Is secure for this shit you better keep It out of dodge 
 Before I put you in some shit 
 You really got to swap, then call the hustle boys, 
 To get you mothafuckas robbed

 I climb in my zone, I'm from the LBC, 
 Where the climate is cold 
 And I know you player hatas got your eyes on my dope, 
 'Cause I spit that real shit, 
 In your ear you can ?? 
 Spend summers on the beach 
 Hidden gears on the boat 
 Fifty G's all in twennys keep the duffel bag closed 
 What you call heat 
 Eat a nigga'ho 
 Fo you chain snatchion niggas tryna size up my gold 
 It's the problem, I don't need no antidote 
 No cure nigga, I let the wound heal slow 
 I gotta keep it gangsta makin' moves on the road 
 Tour bus full of weed smoke, bitches 'n' hoes 
 I've been doin' this fo years 
 Nigga that's how it goes 
 Is the big boss dogg I'm the truth untold 
 West coast camping no mean to brag the boss 
 The benz or the porche, I done have them both 
 Lil snoop count my money cut my fingers its mo 
 It's the celebration, grab yo glass 'n' toast 
 West Coast!
