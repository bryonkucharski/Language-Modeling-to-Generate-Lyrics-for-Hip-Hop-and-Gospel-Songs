Snoop Dogg 
 Baby, I come running, baby, I come running 
 Just keep me coming, and I come running 
 'Cause I'm your dog, baby I'm your dog 
 So whenever you call, I come running 
 Baby, I come running, baby, I come running 
 Just keep me coming, and I come running 
 'Cause I'm your dog, baby I'm your dog 
 So whenever you call, I come running 
 You ain't listenin' 
 So you can talk to me, don't listen to him 
 A body like that ain't hard to feed, 'cause girl I'll eat you up 
 All in a couple of seconds, girl I'll eat you up 
 It's when you realize you're in Heaven like how'd you get there? 
 Baby what you doin' in this chair? Couldn't let you sit there 
 You need help, somebody should get there 
 You see girl, time is like money, both of which men loathe 
 Spend them both with me and then for sure you'll know 
 Baby, I come running, baby, I come running 
 Just keep me coming, and I come running 
 'Cause I'm your dog, baby I'm your dog 
 So whenever you call, I come running 
 Rick Ross 
 She's impressed by a fat boy 
 Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy 
 Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy 
 Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it 
 Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it 
 She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard 
 Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it 
 Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force 
 Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs 
 Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job 
 Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight 
 I was several million up before it came to light 
 Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it 
 Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music 
 Smoked out like a player and you know the name 
 Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Baby, I come running, baby, I come running 
 Just keep me coming, and I come running 
 'Cause I'm your dog, baby I'm your dog 
 So whenever you call, I come running 
 Kendrick Lamar 
 I got rottweiler in tube sock 
 Pitbull, lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die 
 Boxer, you take mine's off then hallelujah 
 Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times 
 Freaky, freak like it's the 80s 
 Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we 
 Should tone it down with the clean version 
 Dirty but in public you're like teen virgin 
 I like it, make me realize my vices 
 Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates 
 Private meetin' inside your bedroom 
 Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room 
 It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place 
 I'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place 
 I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree 
 What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho

 Baby, I come running, baby, I come running 
 Just keep me coming, and I come running 
 'Cause I'm your dog, baby I'm your dog 
 So whenever you call, I come running
