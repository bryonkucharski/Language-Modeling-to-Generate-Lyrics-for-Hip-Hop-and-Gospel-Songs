Midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, oh 
 (Chorus: Raphael Saadiq) 
 Midnight love 
 Troubles plots on thee mind 
 Midnight love 
 Leave your back door open 
 Midnight love 
 This heaven's ready for me 
 Midnight love 
 Back door little druggie's callin for you 
 (Snoop) 
 I'm makin' things cappin fast 
 Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along 
 Face lookin' stupid broke startin 
 Feelin' dumb, I'm young but I'm a grown man 
 Takin' thangs into my own hands 
 I'm tryin' to own here 
 But life a twist ya like a twister 
 Get twisted with this 
 It seems on but its off 
 I keep missin' this shit 
 I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide out 
 Lookin' dead at the chips 
 I blink they dip 
 Its hard to hang on but I can't let go 
 Smokin' on my last breath 
 Blow out life what's left is death 
 Now I can go on or I can G or make a right 
 Whatever way that I turn its still death after life 
 It don't discourage me, I ain't got nothin' to lose 
 But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn 
 But I learn 'cause I see, and I earn 'cause I G 
 But these problems probably havin' niggaz prayin' to see 
 At an early age so at an early stage in life 
 I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight 
 It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees 
 And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity God help me please 
 Mischeavius and devious is how my life was 
 Puttin' the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed 
 Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side 
 Was thinkin' about a jack move tryin' to whoo-ride 
 Gettin' jealous 'cause my music got this rap game sewn up 
 Them niggaz wanna trip whatever back they get blowed up 
 Blown up or not you can still get shot 
 You don't never play those muthafuckaz I'll always not 
 Rule number one, pay attention to this shit 
 Don't be fuckin' wit my niggaz on the midnight shift 
 Shit shiggy shack, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn 
 Now he's known for servin' more than an oz. so 
 He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest 
 A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest 
 He's lookin' for the music from the night before 
 Trouble 1, he layin low all in gettin' that dough 
 (Daz) 
 Now it's all about the dollars 
 Impalas that bounce 
 Havin' cars and bitches on a proper amount 
 Caught a million chillin' 
 Robbin banks for many muthaz son 
 Life and darkness 
 We all get it started, cold hearted 
 All around it my life won't change for the good 
 As soon as I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood 
 Daz, would you come and ride for me, 
 Hey yo Daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me 
 The tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin' for dumb shit 
 The OGs think then brung guns to control shit 
 Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite 
 Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight 
 And a lot a mob puttin' on mo 
 Problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo 
 But sure I did the record blast five times 
 254 sentence to jail time 
 Midnight love 
 I've been walkin' the street 
 Midnight love 
 I put my life on the line 
 Midnight love 
 'Cause I've just gotta be me 
 Midnight love
