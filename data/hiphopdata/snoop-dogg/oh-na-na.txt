Here we go 
 It's time 
 If it ain't KK what you smoking on 
 If it ain't Rosé tell 'em carry on 
 It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Fat sack in hand, Mac and Dev 
 Back in dreads, stacking bread 
 Kush in the air errywhere I be 
 Word is Doggy Dogg got that 10 a key 
 You can believe what you wanna loc 
 See I'ma pee on the tree when I wanna smoke 
 Underground to the top shelf 
 And I can do it by my goddamn self 
 I put some fire on the tip 
 High when I trip, still fly on a bitch 
 I'ma ease on by 
 Tip top, don't stop, why not, not why 
 See I'ma regulate it 
 Real shit, real niggas, real weed separated 
 And put the match on the tip 
 So quick, so fast like that, you bitch 
 If it ain't KK what you smoking on 
 If it ain't Rosé tell 'em carry on 
 It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Came in this thang, blowing on the strongest Mary Jane 
 Make sure everybody know my name 
 Niggas know we go hard so we young bosses in the game 
 Now I'm getting weed on the plane 
 It's such a shame, your bitch with us 
 Hatin' on me 'cause you probably can't get rich with us 
 Probably run around claim you a real nigga too 
 But I'ma fuck her, never call like real niggas do, ooh 
 No pain, no gain 
 I be on the yacht drunk sipping champagne 
 Partying with Snoop Dogg, smoking propane 
 Screaming rest in peace June Bug with my whole gang 
 Uh, niggas hate but I just laugh at that 
 A milly first quarter, you ain't half of that 
 Talking trees, we can go pack for pack 
 All day, we just smoke back to back 
 If it ain't KK what you smoking on 
 If it ain't Rosé tell 'em carry on 
 It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na
