Top selector number 1 
 Big Snoop D-O double G, yeah 
 Come again, boom, boom 
 Sumthin' 'bout this night 
 Sumthin' 'bout this life, ya 
 Them a dealer, I'mma killer 
 Snoopy Dogg with The Gorillaz 
 Layin' low on the floor 
 My hands are pot, I'm full of dro 
 Roomies try to kiss me slow 
 I'm leanin' like a 64 
 This life I live's incredible 
 These trees I breath are medical 
 Take a look in my eyes 
 Hold on tight, enjoy the ride 
 If you don't feel good then you're outta place 
 My universe is outta space 
 My look, my style, my Prada case 
 Low daddy get outta face 
 Trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back 
 And let Dogg go and get on that 
 Party people, you wouldn't bite it 
 If you never tried it 
 Sumethin' like this night 
 I can try to smoke with you 
 Sumethin' like this night 
 If you never tried it 
 Sumethin' like this night

 What a night to get involved 
 Everybody have a ball 
 Celebrate and fill your cup 
 Drink until you get enough 
 How you feel, I got that feeling 
 Disco lights hang from the ceiling 
 Ain't nobody on the wall 
 Pop it, drop it, let that fall 
 Hey DJ, play my song 
 Step back, let it bang all night long 
 I need your attention, no hopin' or wishin' 
 Come in, you got the permission 
 Said I do, right there I do 
 Get up and get money, yup, that I do 
 Rode it, ride it, lick it 
 Bite it, roll it, ride it 
 Party people, you wouldn't bite it 
 If you never tried it 
 Sumethin' like this night 
 I can try to smoke with you 
 Sumethin' like this night 
 If you never tried it 
 Sumethin' like this night
