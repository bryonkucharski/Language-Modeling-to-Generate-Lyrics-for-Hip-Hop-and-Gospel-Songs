 Your mama name Peter, papa name Cita 
 Fuck that nigga, when it come to the heater 
 Be the elevator, pussy eater 
 Too desperator, got shot, a hibernator 
 Hit a nigga later, he got to vacate 'em 
 Old Dirty corporata, splash, I'm up on the punanny flash 
 Bad gas, Macintosh, the light is red 
 Pee in the bed, I'm frustrated 
 For twenty-nine years, no educated 
 High caded 'cause you kept it checkmated 
 What a waste, I'm up in yo' face like what 
 All you niggas, I'm puttin' you in your place

 Mr. No Meaner, pussy ho beater 
 I keep fo' heaters when I'm dippin' with my vita 
 Suckers, they wanna beat us, join us but we don't need 'em 
 Pump 'em and defeat 'em, dump 'em and delete 'em 
 This negro right here, pimps hoes 
 I smoke so much dope, I have ya bloody at the nose 
 Since my buddy at these hoes wit a bud like a rose 
 It just so happens, I'm the nigga that she chose 
 I flows above the rest, mos' def' 
 Got you shakin' yo' ass and you throwin' up yo' set 
 Whatever you do, you keepin' it true 
 Big Dogg and ODB, I thought you knew 
 Ooh, the Wu is back up in this motherfucker 
 Ooh and Snoop, is burnin' rubber on these suckers

 How you love it, how you like it and how you get it 
 Do that damn thing and quit bull shittin' wit it

 Yes, yes, y'all, to my niggas y'all 
 To my click y'all, you can't quit y'all 
 Wu-Tang bangin' that dope, shit y'all 
 That make you wanna roll up and smoke shit y'all 
 To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all 
 On my flow y'all, niggas don't know y'all 
 You see my style calm but wild 
 You witness the rhyme, nothin' but dimes 
 The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed 
 I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first 
 What, what, what, what, hazardous dart 
 Visual long forgotten art 
 That fell apart till the blood ran from the heart 
 Pump through the street, Rza make rebreak beats 
 Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets 
 And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank 
 Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank 
 Wu niggas rollin', throwin' the first rap slogan 
 Heroes of Hogan, shot up the military clothin' 
 Quickly blow up, rolled up in rappers like pennies 
 My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many 
 With the wisdom, power of, science from experts 
 Self applyin', that put giants in the network 
 The compact disc and televised live cults 
 Will multiply our strength, on a worldwide note 
 Yes, what, what 
 Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop 
 You keep on till the break o dawn 
 Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop 
 Ah Wu-Tang known to make your body rock
