Well, it's the super duper Snoopa, once again I'm on the fly 
 Swoopin' through I'm in my coupe and all the **** want a ride 
 If it's trippin' like I'm clippin' I'm still grippin' on my nine 
 We be crippin' while I'm dippin' with my C's up in the sky 
 And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride 
 **** A feature, I don't need a mother****, I'm the guy 
 I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries 
 Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry 
 Ain't no different when I'm rippin', pimpin's still up in his prime 
 TV shows, movie ****, pimpin's still up on his grind 
 Man these **** don't know, I'm workin' with a nine 
 I ain't talkin' 'bout a gun, I'm talkin' feel it in your spine 
 When I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth 
 I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger 
 Mother**** better duck before I hit her, bang 
 Doggy Dogg is all you need 
 So love the Dogg, like we love weed 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 You **** mad 'cause I done came 
 And crept up back up on the scene 
 This is bye, retire, I'm still spittin' gasoline 
 I'm a gangsta mother**** what the **** you think that means? 
 Look **** I'm the king, I ain't givin' up a thing 
 If you want it come and take it ****, I'll be sittin' waitin' 
 Make a patient **** got the other ear and I'll bake a **** 
 **** It put the gun down and straight bank a **** 
 Take it ****, take it ****, ****, you ain't this **** 
 Slow down my turbo flow 
 Inhale my doe-doe smoke 
 Okay I let the fo'-fo' blow 
 And the po-po know, that's why they on my **** 
 And they at my crib, tryin' to find my **** 
 Tryin' to search my house, what the **** that's 'bout? 
 I ain't givin' up ****, you can search that **** 
 I ain't got nuttin' Jack get the **** on back 
 Doggy Dogg is all you need 
 So love the Dogg, like we love weed 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Doggy Dogg is all you need 
 So love the Dogg, like we love weed 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out 
 Breathe in, let it out
