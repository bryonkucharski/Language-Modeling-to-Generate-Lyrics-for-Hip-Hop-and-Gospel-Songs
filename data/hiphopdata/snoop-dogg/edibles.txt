 T.I. 
 Baddabang baddabang 
 Got a chain you can see through 
 Graduated to a Range from a Regal 
 Hit the club and I leave with it 82 
 That's the difference between me and you 
 Just how we do it, Remy straight to the head and you chase yours 
 On a worldwide tour me and Skateboard 
 Ate more bitches in the lobby on the molly 
 Pretty sexy yet exotic fill 'em all in my Ferrari yep 
 I'll probably be menage in before I put the car in parkin' 
 Got 'em running upstairs got 'em coming in pairs 
 May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there 
 She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there 
 I solemnly swear, I will not share 
 This game with a lame, let him learn for himself 
 I don't owe a nigga shit, better earn for himself 
 Quit tripping on me, be concerned with yourself
