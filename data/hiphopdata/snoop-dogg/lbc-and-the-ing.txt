Featuring Snoop Dogg 
 (Snoop Dogg talking) 
 Hahaha yeah. 
 You're about to witness something you never thought you'd witness 
 Before. 
 Check this out. 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Welcome to the house the D O double G built 
 We got honey cream silk and milk 
 We make that big bank and keep that big shank 
 Just in case we get slapped into the home we take 
 Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all 
 I make chips for crips and the beat dogs 
 True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas 
 Can't get with us 'cause we rip shit up 
 It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub 
 Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love 
 Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go 
 Pullin on my endo, rollin' through the Wood with my kin dog 
 (Mack 10) 
 Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole 
 Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole 
 I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger 
 Been rollin' gold Danas since a BG banger 
 It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin 
 And niggas say we bangin' 'cause our colors be flamin 
 But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack 
 I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body 
 As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party 
 Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew 
 Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true 
 Inglewood family is what they claim to bang 
 Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name 
 But anyway, what can I say? 
 Oh by the way, it's anybody 'kay? 
 So when you in LA, or nigga round my way 
 Give me a holler on the 310 or 213, yeah 
 Long Beach, with the ING 
 (Mack 10) 
 I'm makin' green in the rap scene from coast to coast 
 And rollin' three wheel motion from the woods to the ocean 
 See Snoop and Tray Dee in the LBC 
 And wasn't nobody trippin', just cool as can be 
 No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger 
 But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger 
 And that's fo sho though, you know how it go 
 Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a hoe 
 So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest 
 Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS 
 Game recognize game, and it always should 
 It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood 
 Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie 
 That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies 
 So let it be known, from my hood to your town 
 That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me 
 See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a 
 Bitch and maintain 
 'Cause the more better you get, the more cheddar you get 
 The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get 
 See, I found out quick, don't say shit 
 Just take care of yours, and handle it quick 
 Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or Tupac 
 Niggas been gettin' shot on my block 
 But we got to make a change and the thang is this 
 I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist 
 But I wish upon a star 
 To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar 
 The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga 
 ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame 
 Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane 
 See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job 
 And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre 
 >From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad 
 And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag 
 Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet 
 Makin' money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet 
 (Mack 10) 
 Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang 
 So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang 
 But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks 
 And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks 
 Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs 
 It's connect gang rollin' with the Pound and Snoop Dogg 
 And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be 
 It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city
