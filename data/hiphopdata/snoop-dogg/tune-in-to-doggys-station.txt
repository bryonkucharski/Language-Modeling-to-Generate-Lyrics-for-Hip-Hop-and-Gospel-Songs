(Warren g) 
 Well it's the dub-a double r-e-n 
 Power 106 in the mix again 
 It's the dogghouse servin' 48 
 So grab your gin and bounce rock skates 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 What's up with you warren g? 
 Everything on me, it's your homie snoop dogg from the dpg 
 Everything is everything in the lbc 
 Grass green in the douce lookin' way too ? ? ? 
 (Warren g) 
 Well homie ain't no limit to what you do 
 You got the longbeach malician ride with you 
 So we gonna ? ? ? on every block 
 So you better run and grab your glock 
 'Cause I'm lookin' for you and I'm lookin' for you 
 And when I snatch your ass, your ass is trough 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 I had my show for a minute 
 My hands all in it 
 Now everybody wanna know what's up with me and no limit 
 Hellyeah I get paid with the homie master p 
 And I never forget where I'm from; g-dub 
 (Warren g) 
 Well I'm gonna get it 
 And I'm gonna spit it 
 Weither there is no limit or g-funk 
 All the homies is with it 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 The sky is all grey and I'm drinkin' brew 
 We're 3 million deep and I'm the leader of the crew 
 Ask kurupt he got game like coopie (?) 
 I ain't nothing but a playa, that's what your mamma told me 
 When you're all alone and you're sitting at home 
 And you feel like hollaring at the dogg on the phone 
 Never hesitate to call 411845059 
 Gangsta's ride ? ? ? ? ? ? drank 
 Hitting on the chronic as a ? ? ? smash the sun 
 Feels good to be a westcoast representer 
 A long way from me on the TV dinner (?) 
 Got my own show like jerry springer 
 And it's quite off the hook, in fact it's off the ? ? ? 
 So l-o-c's and d-o-g's: 310 714 213, we out 
 (Chorus, snoop dogg) 
 When you're at home 
 And you're alone 
 Tune in to doggy's station 
 When you're at home 
 And you're alone 
 Tune in to doggy's station
