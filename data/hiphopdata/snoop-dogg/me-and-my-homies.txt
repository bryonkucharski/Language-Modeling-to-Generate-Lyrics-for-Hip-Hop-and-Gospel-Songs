Me and my homies tho 
 You know we kick it like everyday 
 Me and my homies, kick it like everyday 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 But I'm alone in my room 
 And I don't have no one to talk to 
 I catch a girl with my phone 
 And cause some folks who know what I go through 
 After I smoke a joint, come on 
 To keep my temper low 
 I parlay with my friends 
 There's really no where else to go 
 (2 Pac) 
 I ain't shit without my homeboys 
 Rather be buried, then see us party 
 Keep it close to my heart 
 'Cause we the ones that got the shit started 
 You recollect, we used to bust on snithces 
 Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches 
 All my homeboys are self sufficient 
 So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks 
 Got the police taking our pictures 
 Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride 
 Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die 
 For each other, 'cause we closer than brothers 
 It's like you came in, no forgetting the party popping 
 When my squad walks in 
 Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony 
 Don't forget to bring something for all my homies 
 To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets, 
 Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it 
 Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me 
 But I ain't shit without my fucking homies 
 Me and my fucking homies 
 (Me and my homies) 
 Constantly we mash 
 (Me and my homies) 
 Gotta make that cash 
 (Me and my homies) 
 There's no need to ask 
 (Me and my homies) 
 We are still the best 
 (Repeat: x8) 
 (That's my homeys) 
 That's my homeys
