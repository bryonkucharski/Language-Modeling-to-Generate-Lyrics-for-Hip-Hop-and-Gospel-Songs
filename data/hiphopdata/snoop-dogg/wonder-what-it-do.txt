Uncle Chucc: 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 They say it's? '64 on Vogue's 
 In the game pain still the same they knocking at your door 
 Ooh you wanna only talk bad 
 It's a sad sad thing you dirty low down 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 I wonder wonder wonder what it do 
 Wa la la la la la la la la la 
 Tell me now! 
 Wa la la la la la la la la la 
 Wa la la la la la la la la la 
 Won't you tell me now!

 Snoop Dogg: 
 Independent I'm in it been getting my cash right 
 Walking through the day time holding my flashlight 
 Spliff-ted High as I can ever be 
 I'm lofted drifting on the memory 
 My style my tone my delivery 
 My Maze is Frankie Beverly 
 Heavily influenced I do it like you can't 
 I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag and a drink 
 Get live that's five on the black hand side 
 Now try to stay fly with a piece of pie 
 I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen 
 The baby gangstas they get in the hood and on a mission 
 You pump 'em up they fuck it up 
 Now what you need to do is toughen up 
 Now thug it up what it do dog 
 I thought you wanted to be like big

 Snoop Dogg: 
 When I get lost 
 I feel like a boss 
 She will be my salvation 
 When I feel lost 
 With nowhere to go 
 She'll be my inspiration 
 She never spends 
 Time with her friends 
 Tells me she's mute without me 
 And when things go wrong 
 Her faith is strong 
 I know that she'll never doubt me 
 Uncle Chucc: 
 Hey Snoop Dogg
