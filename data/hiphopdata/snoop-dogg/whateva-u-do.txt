Kids get your parents permission before tryin' this 
 Half of the *** and the music goin' bang 
 Everybody, everybody, yeah, we all doin' everythin' 
 So you know what's happenin', there no need to pitty-pat 
 Dogg in this mother***, yeah, I get the kitty-kat 
 Swervin' on the one-ten, blowin' on some herb 
 One hand on the steerin' wheel, the other up her mini skirt 
 Tryna get some *** while I'm pushin' my wheel 
 Funny thing about it is that I'm *** your *** 
 Okay yo, *** lay low, get mayo, like OJ yo, say *** 
 Plug it in, pull it out, put it in, what it is, that's what it's all about 
 Now what would I be if I let a punk mother*** run up on me? 
 I play chess, checkmate him in the street, 32 fever off blast that's three 
 Swish, swish, fresh fish ain't that a *** 
 Like Ray J I got one wish 
 Look at the place I'm in 
 I never *** super head like Kim Kardashian 
 It's a disgrace to yourself 
 Dogg is the champ to the face with the belt 
 I'm undefeated, undisputed, persecuted 
 Spaded and neutered, faded and booted 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that whateva you do 
 Put ya hands in the sky 
 Stick up, pick up piece of American pie 
 What kind of car do ya drive? 
 Suicide doors on the passenger side 
 Do the windows roll down? Do the doors lift high? 
 Do the car change colors when that *** drive by? 
 I don't really know and I don't really care 
 'Cause me and my money's like Sonny and Cher 
 Spend dow at the Gucci store 
 I never spend dow on the *** though 
 You can check it, I got a record in Brazil 
 For runnin' out and not payin' the *** 
 Juvenile delinquent, see when I speak this, move when I bleep this 
 Lil' *** peep this, ya secrets is all exposed 
 If ya grew up on ma music ya mamma's one of ma *** 
 Ya daddy's one of ma foes, ya granny's been to one of ma shows 
 It is contrary that my literachary is very necessary, ya feel me? 
 And you can try to rewind it, define it, assign it to a whole 'notha groove 
 Play it to anotha move, hope ya go through 'cause ya won't strike two 
 With twelve jury's up your piers, you better hope they like you 
 Ain't no tellin' what they might do 
 So I'ma just stay out their mother*** way view 
 Dippin' in and outta town, gotta get a hundred thou 
 Even if it's just for a setta 
 I've been blessed by kings and kissed by queens 
 Even got a hommie named Prince Akeem 
 Yes, I mean black diamonds, I can have anythin' 
 Yep, there's twenty game 
 Even if I coulda, I would have never stopped 
 I started on the bottom, now they got him on the top 
 Sensation, big Snoop Dogg rattin' number one in the nation 
 Top draft pick, always got a top bad *** 
 Every time you see me, *** wanna be me 
 It ain't that easy, it's still hard being 
 Snoop D O mother*** double G 
 Believe me 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that yack, yack for you 
 We got that ***, we got that whateva you do, do 
 Whateva you do, d-d-do, d-d-do, whateva you do, d-do, d-d-do
