Snoopy, it's what they say as if they knew me 
 Groupie on my head like a koofie 
 My nigga kid Cudi, that's my little buddy 
 Calls some hoes up and get some cudi cudi 
 What's your life like, mines is kinda tight 
 A long way from hustling, that shining light 
 My people love the fans love me come all go 
 If you ain't showin' love then what you call for 
 I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price 
 Sorta like the need of my wife 
 Smoke till I'm gone, dog on the throne 
 I'm worldwide known, I'm a boss in the zone 
 I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot 
 You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans 
 I turned out to be the better man, important to life 
 You understand while I'm puffin on this gram 
 Everythin' I'm havin' 
 No, they ain't necessity 
 Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin' 
 What you see ain't all of me 
 Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes 
 The code in which I roll 
 It's so simple what I need 
 You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I got my fame dog, look at my niggas 
 Got a 'lil money, yo and I ain't trippin' 
 Most days are faded, feelin' the next way is 
 Steady wanting freaky hoes then I want a lady 
 Holdin' the fame down and my close homies 
 The people who was there were some suckas, let me lonely, phoney 
 When you see a nigga don't approach me 
 Made it to the top, baby haters on me 
 Catch trying to claim that they made me 
 However you feelin' the real fo' gazy 
 I keep it 100 never frontin', no need be 
 I made it in a zone no place you could see 
 Well, nigga, come yo to haters that don't know 
 Loco how a nigga life from post po 
 The ones fans love who was always approachable yo 
 And I rep the double O, eating cheerios 
 Everythin' I'm havin' 
 No, they ain't necessity 
 Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin' 
 What you see ain't all of me 
 Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes 
 The code in which I roll 
 It's so simple what I need 
 You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king 
 And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it 
 All out in public, the people wanna touch me 
 I need a blunt with the stuffing 
 Nigga, it's nothing for me to chill out, post up at the house 
 With madden on the screen and smash on the homies 
 Hollywood, nice now everybody owe me 
 And the block talk shit like they know me 
 Oh, fool, take you niggas to school 
 How to get rich and stay cool 
 Snoopy D-O dub, show your homie 
 Even with the critics and the feds all on me 
 I was tapping all the conies 
 Dogg but my folks call me snoopy, boss dog nigga sue me 
 Ponytail swinging as I lay it in the kufi 
 Loving my life, while I'm puffing on the oh wee 'cause 
 Everythin' I'm havin' 
 No, they ain't necessity 
 Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin' 
 What you see ain't all of me 
 Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes 
 The code in which I roll 
 It's so simple what I need 
 You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 I can't forget that tree 
 Snoop Dogg in the house tonight 
 Blowing that blaker purp that I know you like right 
 Kid Cudi, my nephew blaze that shit 
 Right now would you, would you right? 
 Snoop Dogg in the house tonight 
 Blazing that Lakers herb that I know you like right 
 Kid Cudi, my nephew blaze that shit 
 Right now my nigga like fly
