Yeah, they say I've always been known to 
 (Make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Now you've been waitin', patient 
 Dinner datin', classic chasin' 
 Your homies hatin' 'cause you're never around 
 You're either at the movies or you're out shoppin' around 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 All that for the cat, it's a wrap 
 You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that 
 If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder 
 Than any other brotha, the Karma Sutra be the author 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Be her father, be a man, be the man 
 That made her never wanna see another man 
 Make it better than good, make it great 
 Make her visit, then make her stay 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Yeah man, if you got a real one 
 You better hold on to her 
 See 'cause a real man will come along the way 
 And smooth knock her 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 If you like her, wife her 
 If you love her, smother her 
 With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way 
 And pull that ring out on the same day 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage 
 You gon' lose if you scared of marriage 
 A real boss got a foundation 
 You need somebody in your life with patience minus the hate 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Shante what more can I say? 
 But baby, look at us today 
 Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute 
 King of the coast with a gang of loot 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 You got one chance to crack 
 One shot to pop, better hit the spot 
 'Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line 
 Player it's your time to 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you 
 Make it do what he couldn't do for you 
 The Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower 
 I appear through the steam 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Braids and all, over six foot tall 
 Can't no other brotha fade the Dogg 
 I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want 
 I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 I got the remedy, the energy 
 It's your mama, your daddy and then it's me 
 Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would 
 Close your eyes, baby girl, let me 
 (Ooh, make it good) 
 Ooh, make it good 
 Ooh, make it good 
 Ooh, make it good 
 Ooh, make it good
