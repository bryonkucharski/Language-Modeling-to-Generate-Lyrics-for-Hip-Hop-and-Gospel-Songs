Fuck 
 You know a nigga don't wanna go to school today 
 Let me call this bitch, and get my shit together 
 When I pull up people so fresh in my ride 
 We smoke the best you can buy 
 Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us 
 Keep stunting just 'cause I can 
 These hoes know just who I am 
 Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us 
 Uh, this one's for the G's, all black chucks on the cuffs of my jeans 
 King size papes stuffed full of trees, 
 I be with the boss dog, y'all fuck niggas fleas 
 Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees 
 Taking pictures with a young nigga, cheese 
 Remember days homie, I ain't have a thing 
 Now I'm hoping off a plane putting roaches on the wing 
 And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings 
 Jewelry froze like bling 
 Money comes fast yours slow like? 
 Rolling up grass, so weed to have to style, so I know I'm gonna pass 
 Third period, showing up last 
 With a late note blowin' green smoke 
 We blow to the middle of the day 
 Wiz say Dogg put the middle of the jay 
 Hey, why not? Not why? 
 We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high 
 Fuck it, everybody to the library 
 Got a new batch, some blue, booberry 
 Stuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day 
 It's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines 
 Richie Valens? 
 I'm so lifted, like a parachuter 
 My grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller 
 Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a wholezip away 
 But fuck that, this the Taylor gang, what you on dog 
 Shit I'm on everythang 
 Never have never will 
 You niggas never have never will 
 You niggas never have never will 
 I said you niggas never have and you never will 
 You niggas never have and never will 
 You niggas never have and never will 
 Big Snoop and young Wiz smokin' kill kill kill kill 
 You niggers still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas 
 Holler at me when you graduate 
 We'll be posted right by the four hundred building, 
 Room four twenty, follow your nose
