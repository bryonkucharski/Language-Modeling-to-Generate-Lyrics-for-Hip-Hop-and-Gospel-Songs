All money ain't good money 
 But ain't no money like the show money 
 We came from the bottom to the top floor 
 Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though 
 Money problems everybody got those 
 But now a days we don't got those 
 Birkin bag all my bitches got those 
 No Chanel everybody got those 
 Shooters on the roof know we got those 
 Hear a couple shots, hope you got those 
 I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket 
 Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet 
 I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt 
 Slap 'em in the face tell 'em take them fuckin' pants off 
 T'd Up, G'd Up when we stance off 
 Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off 
 Goin' with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin' 
 Rides till I'm Risen, strong with the pizzen' 
 You don't know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe 
 Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost 
 See everything I'm rock and wear its handmade 
 If she with me then she got it all you understand me 
 We came from the bottom to the top floor 
 Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though 
 Money problems everybody got those 
 But now a days we don't got those 
 Birkin bag all my bitches got those 
 No Chanel everybody got those 
 Shooters on the roof know we got those 
 Hear a couple shots, hope you got those 
 The police, motherfuckin' gang to me 
 And money, ain't a motherfuckin' thang to me 
 Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters 
 And a damn good lawyer 
 Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse 
 Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first 
 And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck 
 Baby remember before you had shoes 
 When yo' life was filled with nothing but bad news 
 See everything I rock and wear is handmade 
 If she with me then she got it all you understand me 
 We came from the bottom to the top floor 
 Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though 
 Money problems everybody got those 
 But now a days we don't got those 
 Birkin bag all my bitches got those 
 No Chanel everybody got those 
 Shooters on the roof know we got those 
 Hear a couple shots, hope you got those 
 New cars got that, good weed blow that 
 Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that 
 Used to stay with my momma on the couch 
 Like the Jeffersons I'm moving on up and I'm out 
 Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door 
 To ensure I'm the only motherfucker on this floor 
 I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love 
 I got so many hoes, I'm bout to open a club 
 You got me, I got you, you got one, I got two 
 Stop by and have a good time its popping' at Snoops 
 Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that 
 Me and Timberland remember we bringin' it back 
 We came from the bottom to the top floor 
 Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though 
 Money problems everybody got those 
 But now a days we don't got those 
 Birkin bag all my bitches got those 
 No Chanel everybody got those 
 Shooters on the roof know we got those 
 Hear a couple shots, hope you got those
