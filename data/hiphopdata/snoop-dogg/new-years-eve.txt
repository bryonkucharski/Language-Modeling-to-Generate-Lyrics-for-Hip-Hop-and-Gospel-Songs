We're having a good day 
 Let's make it a great night 
 You know I see you 
 And tell you you're so tight 
 My special lady 
 You're one of a kind 
 And every time I see you shine 
 It's like the lights of midnight 
 On New Year's Eve 
 And I do believe 
 On New Year's Eve 
 We can make it 
 We can live forever 
 11:59 and not a second later 
 She's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader 
 It's about to go down 
 No elevator 
 Live for the moment 
 Love in the air 
 She got me feeling like 
 I don't wanna be your player 
 Real talk 
 So I don't wanna be unfair 
 Now watch the apple drop 
 And celebrate the year 
 I see you shinin' away 
 From over there 
 And all the other girls 
 No, they don't compare 
 I whisper something bond to you 
 All up in your ear 
 I infiltrate your mind 
 And then I penetrate her 
 I get it crackin' baby 
 Call me the ... lady 
 We're having a good day 
 Let's make it a great night 
 You know I see you 
 And tell you you're so tight 
 My special lady 
 You're one of a kind 
 And every time I see you shine 
 It's like the lights of midnight 
 On New Year's Eve 
 And I do believe 
 On New Year's Eve 
 We can make it 
 We can live forever 
 Grab a glass 
 Make a toast to the good life 
 Recorded line, so what? 
 It will pass the time 
 Leather seats in the back of a Phantom ride 
 You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine 
 Master kush smoke for a master mind 
 My special lady 
 Only one of a kind 
 I never seen it comin' 
 I guess love is blind 
 New Year's watch the city come to life 
 I must say girl 
 You're looking right 
 Your hair did, nails did, dress 
 Fitting tight 
 I think I just might 
 See she's the one I like 
 See we can look forever girl 
 Let's get hot one night 
 We're having a good day 
 Let's make it a great night 
 You know I see you 
 And tell you you're so tight 
 My special lady 
 You're one of a kind 
 And every time I see you shine 
 It's like the lights of midnight 
 On New Year's Eve 
 And I do believe 
 On New Year's Eve 
 We can make it 
 We can live forever
