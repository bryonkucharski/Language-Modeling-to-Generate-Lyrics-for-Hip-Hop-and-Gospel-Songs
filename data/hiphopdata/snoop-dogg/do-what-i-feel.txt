(Featuring The Lady Of Rage) 
 Verse One: Kurupt, Daz 
 Now here's the perfect niche to let it bubble and foam 
 Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown 
 It's the mischievous, lyrical genius on the loose 
 And I pack the deuce deuce of some act right juice 
 I'm in my own, space and time 
 The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind 
 It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day 
 Foe a G from DPG to wear clear blue and gray 
 I come I came, I am I ain't 
 The nigga ya wants ta fuck with, get peeled like paint 
 Bottoms up, nigga give it all ya got 
 From the bottom to the top or get shanked get shot 
 Provocative footage, of this lyrical abuse transgression 
 From this infectious enemy, they on the loose 
 And unstoppable, Daz 
 My motherfuckin nigga from back in the past 
 Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
 With no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
 Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
 With intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
 Is this my boundary from county to county? 
 Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
 Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
 Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
 But uh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin' crew 
 Now whatchu want to do? (Hmm, whatchu want to do? Yeah) 
 Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin 
 You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin' 
 I gets to bustin' (blaow blaow) you gets to duckin (blaow blaow) 
 Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin in the cut 
 My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em 
 I catch 'em and let 'em have it what's up, with my opponents 
 I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one 
 Forever I reign, top Dogg number one 
 My rhyme ?to some inflanable? and Doggs that's untrainable 
 Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable 
 Chorus: Daz, Kurupt 
 [Daz] I'm a D.P.G.C. for life 
 [Duo] I do what I feel and, I do what I like 
 (Repeat 4X) 
 Verse Two: Kurupt, Rage 
 I hits it like shots, from the homey strap 
 I smoke indo, and I sip Cog-nac 
 Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick 
 Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
 'Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
 Out of mind, somethin' I wouldn't do without a nine 
 I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
 Mashin all through the streets rollin' wit some heat 
 I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
 Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
 I'm on point and alert 
 With skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
 Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
 Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
 See me in black and beware 
 It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
 Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
 Rage is knockin' lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
 Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
 With my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
 Faddle, dibble, dabble 
 Gotta Rock like Fraggle 
 I'm hittin so hard I'm leavin' that I'm leavin' 'em snaggled 
 Like Leon Spinks this black cat's got ya jinxed 
 Fuck around and you'll get chipped off like the Sphinx 
 Think, about it, better yet forget it 
 Uh, play like En Vogue 'cause you're never gonna get it 
 The style, the flavor, the flow, the so-lo-ist 
 Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin' 
 That's my lethal weapon like a chain and ball 
 I'm wreckin, shop, tech and, glock 
 Not in my pocket, no need for cock and 
 Gauges just flip the scripts and rippin pages Rage is 
 The amazin, trail-blazin' 
 Flows shavin like Norelco you can't let go, hell no! 
 I'm that Lyrical Murderer 
 Stranded on the Row with my ill type flow and uh...
