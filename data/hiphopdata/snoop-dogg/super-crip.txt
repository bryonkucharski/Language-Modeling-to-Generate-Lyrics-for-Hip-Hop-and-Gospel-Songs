Turn me up, turn me up 
 Just blaze 
 What's up, what's happening? 
 Big Snoop in this bitch, get it crackin' 
 Dickies creased up and they saggin' 
 Gat in the right side, left side flag 
 Niggas running at the lip again 
 Got me feelin' I'ma trip again 
 And you thought I wasn't listenin' 
 Bitches talking shit, got me walkin' like a Crip again 
 Gotta hit you with the re-up 
 I'm married to the streets, fuck a prenup 
 Ay lil' nigga roll the weed up 
 Drank in my cup, we about to get G'd up 
 Long Beach on my right side 
 CPT on my left side 
 I got Watts in this bitch 
 It be dogs from the 'jects still screaming out West Side 
 Long Beach on my right side 
 CPT on my left side 
 I got Watts in this bitch 
 Tiny loccs from the third and they screaming out East Side 
 Bitch niggas still bang on 'em 
 50 Cal shots, let it rang on 'em 
 And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle 
 We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em 
 Bitch niggas still bang on 'em 
 50 Cal shots, let it rain on 'em 
 And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle 
 We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em 
 Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em 
 Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em 
 But then again I ain't brainless 
 I'll have my little loccs hit you with the stainless 
 Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em 
 Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em 
 But I ain't tryna make ya famous 
 I'll have my tiny locos hit you with the stainless 
 Bitch you know who I be 
 D-O double G, super C-R-I-P 
 Creepin' through the fog 
 And steppin' through the smog 
 And you know I'm high as shit 
 And my bitches fly free 
 Shit you know who I be 
 D-O double G, super C-R-I-P 
 Creepin' through the fog 
 And steppin' through the smog 
 And you know I'm high as shit 
 And my bitches fly free 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that 
 It's enough of that to go around 
 Real G's make the hood go 'round 
 Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis 
 How is he so hood? How can you ask this? 
 I guess you can say I put in practice 
 On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch 
 And even if I'm blown on my own 
 With the chrome to your dome 
 Make you stretch like elastic 
 I need my real G's to the left 
 Bitch niggas staying to the right 
 I need my hoes front and center 
 Hard on these hoes from the Summer to the winter 
 Spring to the Fall, hoes still on my balls 
 It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg 
 Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard 
 I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh 
 Real shit on the set, I get your whole clique served 
 You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb 
 With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it" 
 They won't testify, so he got away with it 
 Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my bad phone 
 I'm talkin' to Iron man, while smokin' some fire, man 
 Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane 
 Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 Super Crip, who? 
 Super Crip, what? 
 It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that
