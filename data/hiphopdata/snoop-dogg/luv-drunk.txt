Ooh, ooh, close the door 
 I'ma goin' in and that fo' sure 
 Gonna lay ya out, out, out 
 And I know you luv a nigga breakin' it down 
 Every time I'm with her 
 I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk 
 Every time she's with 
 She in me, luv drunk 
 You know who I am, I'm the mothafuckin' dogg 
 The sheets fucked up and you know it was me 
 You hit a bedspreak all way down the street 
 It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat 
 I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow 
 Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth 
 I told you before I don't luv them ho's 
 But she got that good, good, can't let her go 
 And I gotta let her know 
 Every time I'm with her 
 I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk 
 Every time she's with 
 She in me, luv drunk 
 She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' fo' 
 And I got that fire luvin, the more you need the more ooh 
 Lemme say ooh, ooh, ah, ah 
 Every time she's with me, me I'm dizzy 
 Shoot to the spot 'cause the spot is the lick 
 Pull your lunch break, lemme hit it real quick 
 Back to your job before they know what is 
 Luvin' so good, we already made three kids 
 I don't know what it is but I luv what I did 
 Huggin' and touchin' and all that shit 
 Drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill 
 Yeah, this for you boo it's a gift 
 Every time I'm with her 
 I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk 
 Every time she's with 
 She in me, luv drunk 
 She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for 
 And I got that fire luvin', the more you need the more ooh 
 Lemme say ooh, ooh, ah, ah, oh yeah 
 Every time she's with me, me I'm dizzy
