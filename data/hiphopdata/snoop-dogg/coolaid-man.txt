Hey, Snoop Dogg, can you pour me another glass of that Coolaid? 
 On the set, my nigga, I'mma own mine 
 Upgrade, just like your phone game 
 Big Snoop Dogg, I do my own thing 
 And I stays in my own lane 
 My rap style, is dynamite 
 A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike 
 You do it how you do's it 
 See, you can blame it on the drugs, or you can blame it on the music 
 Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga 
 That's called bitin', yeah, you the other nigga 
 Let my demeanor be the meaning, got you screamin' 
 While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin' 
 To have a big car, rap star 
 Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard 
 So disobedient, flavor is the main ingredient 
 And you lack it, it's all in your jacket 
 But I'm hot, and as cool as a fan 
 You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man 
 Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand 
 Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man

 Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man

 Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man 
 Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man 
 Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, (?) I'm the Coolaid Man

 The reason that I say that I'm the Coolaid 
 Look at all the flavor that I gave to the gizzame 
 Just add water, it don't get no hotter 
 You got your whole get-down from the Doggy Dogg father 
 Nevermind it was never mines 
 Inquire intellectual, clever minds 
 Bet a dub that this shit pop 
 Bitch niggas mix love with this hip-hop 
 Just to be on, now what the fuck are we on 
 LBC, we've been known to get our G on 
 They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner he on, P-I-M-P on 
 She a freak of the week, I'm teachin' niggas how to eat 
 Cause I'm deep in the streets 
 Look, don't get it fucked up loc 
 Cause every now and then, niggas need a line of this dope 
 Cause I'm hot, and as cool as a fan 
 You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man 
 Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand 
 Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man

 Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man
