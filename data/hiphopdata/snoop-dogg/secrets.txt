I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you talking in your sleep 
 I hear the secrets that you keep 
 When you talking in your sleep 
 When you close your eyes 
 And you go to sleep 
 That's when I ride late night 
 I be on the creep 
 I'mma get you before you get me 
 Them n***s that you hang 
 With is also weak
