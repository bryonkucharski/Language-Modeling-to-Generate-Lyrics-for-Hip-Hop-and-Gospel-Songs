Ah-ha 
 Get your motherfuckin' glass, 'cause it's a blast from the past 
 You didn't think would touch it two times nigga 
 Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yah 
 Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me) 
 Get your ice, get your cups, 'Cause we about to get fucked up in here 
 Yah (yah), Straight up, Uhmm (uhmm), Yah (yah) 
 I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka 
 Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice 
 Heated in the seat cup fulla drank 
 Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank 
 Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause 
 Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws 
 Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga 
 I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga 
 To fucked up off that G-I and juice, 
 C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do 
 I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo 
 Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low 
 ??? Spot for the glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg 
 So toss out the ??? 
 Put my shit on three wheels for thrills 
 I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real 
 Rollin' down the street, with heat 
 Drankin', ???, Sittin' on D's 
 Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze 
 Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies (2X) 
 Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole 
 She said she knows NINO, now stop me loc 
 Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out 
 Then turn the bitch out, look here 
 There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time 
 See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up! 
 Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality 
 With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first 
 And then it got worse, 'cause now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt 
 Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway 
 Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way 
 Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain 
 And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain 
 Now it ain't no thing, 'cause she swallowed it up 
 Then she wanted to take a puff, I said "Look here bitch you've had 
 Enough" 
 Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up 
 (Say What, Say What) 
 Come on, Now 
 Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up 
 (What Chew Say, What Chew Say) YAH 
 I'm hopped by the ice cream shop, The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me 
 Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle 
 Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank 
 Tryin' to find all your dope, 'cause you're a smoker 
 I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast 
 'Cause times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to lose ?!?!?! 
 Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something 
 Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some 
 Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy 
 Hook it up like Master P (Ughh) 
 Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed
