Dogg Pound Gangstas rip 
 Dogg Pound Gangstas rip 
 Word on tha streets, see it ain't nobodies business 
 Secret to keep, so keep heat incase things get deep 
 Peace box is where it starts, scarred flesh and broke hearts 
 Since a kid this is how we live, 
 Ain't nuttin to look forward to 
 Schools full of devils 
 The church don't work 'cause all the lies that they tell us 
 Y'all it'll be hell before we get there 
 Survivin guns and drugs and see 
 If you can deal with this germ warfare that's endin us 
 They anti-Christ, I'm anti-fair, anti-vice, anti-nice, anti-spice 
 Up your life, I'll make you love it 
 'Cause it's real and you bump it 'cause it's tight 
 Yeah, people make the world go round, and it's a gang 
 Of us all gathered up in our game colors 
 Man, these my gang brothas 
 What, you ain't heard of us 
 You ain't never ever heard the word murderer's 
 We make the news what it is 
 You ask what is this 
 We the reason why the police in business 
 So run up on us with your knife and your pistols 
 We'll plague your character with rifles and missils 
 I dropped my pack and drove my back to the eastside 
 Smash in this coupe with my passenger Snoop. 
 (Dogg Pound Gangstas rip) 
 Them Long Beach niggas be puttin' it down 
 Dogg Pound Gangstas make the world go round 
 (Dogg Pound Gangstas rip) 
 So get cha' ass up just to get on down 
 Snoop Dogg and Bad Ass is puttin' it down

 So get cha' ass up just to get on down 
 Snoop Dogg and Bad Ass is puttin' it down 
 Never pause on my feet, I'm DPG, LBC, me and B-A-D 
 Low ridin', and Navigators foe the haters 
 I take some for now, and save some for later 
 Smoke with Coke Loc 
 A dip with Tip Tip 
 Get heat a chrome plate, a D from Tray Deee 
 Livin' that DP, give me that ST 
 In a 4-0 a 0-E from my OG 
 And a bag of them ol' hot ass skins 
 Some Colt for this hand 
 And some juice for this gin 
 Ain't no bitch like this bitch I got 
 'Cause this bitch I got, clock nots and rocks 
 Money, cheese, paper, fedio get doctor Nedios, 
 And stank is steady goin' 
 Bangin' that, slangin that, and hangin' that every corner 
 From up north to Dogg Pound California 
 You heard of that gangstaville 
 The city where they don't talk and everybody C-walk 
 It's a dirty shame, but it's a dirty game 
 And you got to have heart from the start man 
 Fake snitches and fake bitches 
 That's probably why I break niggas and break bitches 
 Word on the streets Bad Ass is a fool 
 Then he fuckin' with his homeboy from the old school 
 Low life gangstas, Dogg Pound gangstas, put them all together 
 Man I love gangstas 
 Head, shoulders, feet and toes 
 Lets dip to the club and bust some hoes 
 V.I.P. on DPG, Snoop D-O double G, and the B-A-D

 Only talk what you know 
 I never seen you round the Pound 
 So won't you keep the eastside and deez out ya mouth 
 Don't speak on dat 
 Don't bring up Daz and Kurupt, just to say wussup, nigga hit my blunt 
 We keep a money move, hate while we regulate 
 And get real papes, rich like Bill Gates 
 While you make it to the Haters Hall of Fame 
 We'll be whippin Navigators 
 Winnin' this baller's game 
 Yellin' Long Beach niggas keep puttin' it down 
 Lowlife and at the Pound while we smoke on an ounce 
 Steady plottin on big mail 
 Layin in the hotel 
 Chop my quarters down to dubs and watch my dope sell 
 I hit Darochee come and scoop me 
 Drop me off and they was snoopy's said he puffed a little play 
 And shorty played it only twice 
 Ay, they set a 8 beat 
 It's them and 6 hoes in a jeep 
 They better go flag em' down in the street 
 Ay, follow us to the spot 
 While the playa hatas pray that we stop
