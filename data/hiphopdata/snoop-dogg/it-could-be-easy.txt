It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 But you probably won't believe me 
 That's why I smoke around 
 Doggy style they see me on TV 
 Trying had just to beat me 
 She knows who I am plus my team is undefeated 
 I am the man in my city if you wanna it I got the key 
 What you wanna ? without a ? everything you see I own I ain't got to lease 
 If you feel out of control better put that hoe on a leash 
 It could be easy 
 If you are listen to what I am trying to tell you 
 Every dime pays but they catch ? messing with their? 
 ? Tell her you win her heart ? cross kind of familiar 
 I ain't tripping I am ? another one I got a couple of problems with my bitches 
 ? Pimping it could be easy 
 I am rolling ? police and don't ask where I have been got? 
 Haters talk when I leave they just ? when they see what they want and they need me 
 I am a fucking game genie young nigger but I make it look easy 
 It could be easy 
 Money too stay fly 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 Flying on a plane plane 
 ? To this fame fame 
 Never the same game 
 Ask me if a game bang 
 If a? 
 The track is where I kick it 
 Until you start to pick up I look your? 
 ? Is real hard but you can make it easy 
 I ain't questionable now baby please me 
 And once I get independent I make you need me 
 Like I roll weed baby start with now she need me 
 Believe me you complete me protect the spite 
 ? School lay low ? on my ? English ? kush low 
 I am gonna go home baby ? be home alone 
 Now she is sucking on her own? 
 It could be easy 
 But small things make it so hard 
 It could be easy 
 Tell me what you really do 
 Who you are 
 It's been down before 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 It could be easy 
 But small things make it so hard 
 It could be easy 
 It's been down before I think you should know
