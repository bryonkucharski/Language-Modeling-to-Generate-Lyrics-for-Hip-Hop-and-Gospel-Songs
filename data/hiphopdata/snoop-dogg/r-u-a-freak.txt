Yeah, yeah 
 Hurry, hurry, write your number on the napkin right now 
 And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, 'cause I gotta go 
 Something's burning, you see the party people rocking side to side 
 And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, 'cause I gotta know 
 She DTF 'cause she's down to feel 
 That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real 
 Are you a freak, or what? 
 I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut 
 You crack me up 
 Are you a freak? So am I 
 So could we see eye to eye? 
 You must let go of that mind control that's coming out your television and radio 
 You must escape 
 (Say what) 
 , escape from here 
 Get intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go 
 (Blow) 
 Far from here, let it go 
 (Just blow) 
 Let it go 
 She DTF 'cause she's down to feel 
 That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real 
 Are you a freak, or what? 
 I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut 
 You crack me up 
 Are you a freak? So am I 
 So could we see eye to eye? 
 You try to survive, you're under pressure 'cause you're running outta time 
 But this is not a chance you wanna blow, 'cause we gotta go 
 The deal is murder, you think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind 
 Make you move when you hear them screaming oh, 'cause I gotta go 
 She DTF 'cause she's down to feel 
 That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real 
 Are you a freak, or what? 
 I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut 
 You crack me up 
 Are you a freak? So am I 
 So could we see eye to eye?
