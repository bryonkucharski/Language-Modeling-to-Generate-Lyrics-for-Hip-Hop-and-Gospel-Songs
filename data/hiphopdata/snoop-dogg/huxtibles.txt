This ain't the huxtibles, 
 But we livin' comfortable, 
 And I don't make muy kids eat their vegetables, 
 The love of my life, 
 My wife Shante, 
 Little do she know, 
 She da boss Lay-day, 
 My youngest duaghter Cori, 
 That's another Story, 
 I call he choc, 
 'Cause she rule the clock, 
 My son Cordell, 
 I call him rook, 
 He like Lizards and money, 
 Boy he off da hook, 
 My man Corde, 
 He da quaterback, 
 He my oldest son.

 Yeah we might as should!
