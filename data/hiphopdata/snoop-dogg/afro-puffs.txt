 It's The Lady Of Rage still kickin' up dust 
 So mm, let me loosen up my bra strap 
 And mm, let me boost ya with my raw rap 
 'Cause I'ma break it down to the nitty-gritty one time 
 When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine 
 Busy as a beaver, ya best believe a 
 This grand diva's runnin' shit with the speed of a cheetah 
 Meet a lyrical murderer I'm servin' 'em like two scoops of chocolate 
 Check it how I rock it 
 I'm the one that's throwin' bolos, ya better roll a Rollo 
 To find out I'm the number one solo, uh 
 The capital are A now take it to the G-E 
 I bring the things to light but you still can't see me 
 I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style 
 For those that try to punk me here's a Pamprin child 
 No need to say mo', check the flow 
 Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know 
 I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs 
 (Rage) 
 Rock on, wit' cha bad self 
 Now I'm hittin' MC's like hit MC's like 
 (Hoo yu ken) 
 Ain't no doubt about it I'm the undisputed 
 So what you uh, wanna do is back on up 
 I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks 
 So put your money on the bread winner 
 I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners 
 I got the tongue that is outdone anyone from the rising 
 To the setting of the sun or the moon 
 I consume the room with doom 
 When I hear the kick of a 808 bass poom 
 Boom, bam, God, daym 
 I'm hittin' so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks 
 Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk 
 Of the rhythm fresh that I give 'em 
 Let it hit 'em, split 'em, did it now I'm rid of 'em, yeah 
 I put that on my unborn kids 
 Rage in effect so you know how it is 
 I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs 
 (Rage) 
 Rock on, wit' cha bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs 
 (Rage) 
 Rock on, wit' cha bad self 
 Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you 
 Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit 
 Oh shit, I'm the shit 
 You can't get wit the Rage then tough tit tie 
 I pity the fool, that gets with the lyrical murderer 'cause my shit is rude 
 (Ooh) 
 You wanna get with the wickedness? 
 With that big botty that's kickin' it, rippin' it apart like Jason 
 You'll be, chasin' a dream like Freddy 
 Are you ready for the cream de la creme? 
 I'm steam pressurin' those who ain't measurin' up 
 I keep competitors stuck in the muck with they butt up 
 What chu wanna nut up like cashew 
 Don't you know that I will mash you? For real 
 That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farm ville, VA 
 (So what you gotta say?) 
 I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs

 The indo blow and the grass grow 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a hoe 
 But you gotta give credit when credit is due 
 Women back down and bow down to my motherfuckin' homegirl 
 The Lady Of Rage, she rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs 
 Handcuffed and she busts and trick biatch 
 She's guaranteed to tear shit up you know what I'm sayin'
