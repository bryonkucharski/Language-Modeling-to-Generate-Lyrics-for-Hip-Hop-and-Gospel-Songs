 Coolest of the cool, I'm the goddamn man 
 Heater so hot need a goddamn fan 
 Everybody want gangsta, suckas don't live it 
 Till they talkin' through that glass like, ?See you in a minute'? 
 That's not the Bigg Boss Dogg 
 I've been in it since a youngin', I'm a Eastside hogg 
 21st Street ridin', rollin' with my partners 
 Hat to the back in a rag spillin' vodka 
 Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's 
 Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck 
 So I chunked up the set like what's happenin' with you 
 Shit I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too 
 Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out 
 Or as we say on the Eastside, you cripped on out 
 See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up 
 Don't forget the block boys givin' it up, where you from loc? 
 Sets up, chest out, in and out, in and out

 For the rules of the game, represent your shit 
 Flag around the steering collar makin' 'em sick 
 Shoot, the L.B. made me, gangbang for real 
 If ya made it through the '80s I'm a product of the shady 
 Snoop D O Doub', it's what I does 
 I'm worldwide love, the homies is like 'cause 
 Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team 
 They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen 
 Like a, Boss would do, how the fuck could you 
 Deny my gangsta, haters in my rearview 
 All around the world they respectin' a G 
 Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me 
 I did it like I did it, mayne 
 Uh, if you ain't did it you ain't did a thang 
 Uh, you come through you better holler at me 
 You need beats you better holler at P now put your sets up 
 Sets up, chest out, in and out, in and out
