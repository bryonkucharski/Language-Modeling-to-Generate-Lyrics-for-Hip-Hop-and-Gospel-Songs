People to people, party to place 
 Having the time of your life is all on your face 
 Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe 
 We go uptown, downtown, that's how we ride! 
 Get your strip mode, it's where we be at 
 It's the top dog, the top for drivin' the track 
 Let, let the bass move, let it go! 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Now I've see players, too many to name 
 Some gain recognition and even fame 
 Some go slow and some may go fast 
 But me and my partners we dip and we dash 
 Every flipping the cash, rip zipping the bag 
 Should be slip when we crash, all good never bad 
 All you never had, dreams do come true 
 For me and you, so let it do what it do! 
 Boy, let me say, it's the ride of your life 
 And if you're rolling with me, I tell you, I'll do you right 
 So put your seat belt on, and let your hair hang low 
 And if you wet then I suggest you let it go!

 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Bass, bass, move, let it go 
 Ride, ride, roll it, tip it, advance it 
 Turn it, burn it, take it, adjust it! 
 We can bounce and ball, just tell me how you play 
 I never give up, I do this thing like everyday 
 And I break it down in her way 
 Oh man, I got carried away 
 But anyway I'mma say 
 I feel good everyday! 
 Every way, la, ta, ta 
 I'll make the beat go pa pa pa 
 The heat, stop the beat 
 Listen, attention, permission 
 'Cause this is grand thing bang, bang 
 Same range, change lane 
 Playing games, get you with you, flick it up, rich it up 
 I slip can't get with us 
 No matter what! 
 Next batter up 
 It's better not 
 That's what they ask 
 Come out the grass, so do it fast!
