(Chorus: Snoop Dogg) 
 Ten little Crip niggas running outside 
 All from the turf and they banging out lives 
 Far from a scrub causefrom the Eastside 
 Where they don't die they just multiply 
 So, don't give them niggas a reason 
 To turn it into spray season 
 Don't give them niggas a reason 
 Because they'll turn it into Crip season 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 The gangsta's back, the bank is fat 
 The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac 
 Fools be like, "Break off some cheese" 
 Friends and enemies, aw nigga please 
 Fuck, you thought who pumped you up 
 Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked 
 It's all similar to getting laid 
 On ya back when the motherfucking K sprays 
 I grind for my shine about my bidness 
 Lunatic on the shit and I get ignite (ignite) 
 Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease 
 One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em 
 Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy 
 Seventeen years old and still a baby 
 Gangstas real, they pop the pill 
 You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Wake up in the morning looking funny and shit 
 Fuck a honey dip, 'cause I got money to get 
 Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this 
 Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this 
 Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns 
 There's a million motherfuckers trying to get you down 
 A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thing 
 If ya money right then you might get you a chain 
 But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go 
 Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show 
 So mean, so green, crip back to the block 
 Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got 
 It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black) 
 And they thought we just gangsta rapped 
 Yeah nigga, we take your snaps 
 Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?) 
 It's like that! 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside 
 On the Eastside, nigga we ride 
 And it's a whole lot of dealin' when you on the Eastside 
 On the Eastside, nigga we ride 
 And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside 
 On the Eastside, nigga we ride 
 And it's a whole lot of killin' when you on the Eastside 
 Eastside, yeah nigga we ride 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun 
 I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun
