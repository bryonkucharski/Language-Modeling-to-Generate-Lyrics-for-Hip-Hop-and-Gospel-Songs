(Chorus, snoop singing) 
 Don't do the crime if you can't do the time 
 Yeah 
 Don't do it 
 Fell off into a party in the cpt 
 Niggas looking at me strange 
 But I'm up on the game 
 I ain't fucking with them niggas no mo 
 Shit, I feel the same way y'all feel 
 Nigga, fuck death row (ha ha) 
 I cut 'em loose, send 'em juice 
 With visine in their cup 
 Catch 'em slipping, all my homeys get 'em stuck 
 It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell 
 On the streets he was the heat cause 'cause had major mail 
 Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains 
 Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs 
 Nigga fucking off money, saving them hoes 
 Fucked off some money of mine 
 And bought me a white rolls 
 Living on wilshire in a penthouse suite 
 Fucking bad bitches seven days a week 
 Colder than a motherfucker but now I'm hot 
 Floss me a brand new suit from dionne scott 
 I guess I'm balling now 
 Money falling down 
 I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now 
 Doggy dogg come and get with the pg 
 Mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me 
 But I ain't tripping, I'm just dogg pound cripping 
 Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping 
 Make my own beats, so fuck y'all too 
 And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who 
 We get to the point 
 Blaze the joint 
 Step into the party and holla at everybody 
 As long as the gin get mixed with juice 
 And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce 
 Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga, nigga what 
 Just because I'm having paper don't mean fuck 
 I once was in the same predicament you was 
 Thinking to myself "damn should I kill 'cause? " 
 But I know deep in my heart 
 Two wrongs ain't right 
 And it started from a fist fight 
 I only got one life to live 
 I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids 
 You dig? 
 I'm trying to live long like my hair 
 Put the shit down, like fred estaire 
 I want to share my world 
 But how the fuck can I share it 
 Everytime I throw you something 
 You look at mine and compare it 
 Man, it's a cold shame 
 But it's a cold game 
 I ain't make the rules to this game 
 Look, all I know and all I do 
 Is try to come through with something new 
 Banging for you 
 So whatever you do, you like it or not 
 Because when your shit play out 
 I be back on the dope spot 
 My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said 
 "Son get your money like that" (get your money, man) 
 I sit alone in the zone 
 Face of stone 
 Live the live of al capone 
 A don corleone 
 Casually casualties, fatalities 
 And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me 
 Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding 
 Eastside up, eastsiders 'cause we riding (eastside up) 
 This is portable something to fuck with your ear 
 Doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear 
 I fucks it up, like I always do 
 And that's a trick 
 I'm saying some shit 
 To make the bitches want to suck my dick 
 See it's an everyday thang 
 Communicating to y'all with the dogg pound slang 
 Back up in the house and we just don't stop 
 Call ya mama, fuck her fat, call the motherfucking cops 
 Hit roccs, yeah, you know what? you know what 
 They told me like this
