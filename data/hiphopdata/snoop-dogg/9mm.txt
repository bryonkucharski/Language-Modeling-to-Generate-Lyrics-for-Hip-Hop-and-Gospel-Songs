Snoop Dogg 
 Konvict Music, Akon and David Banner 
 If niggaz wanna ride tonight 
 Best believe we bout to ride tonight yeah 
 Young money, cash money 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around we gon' make me reveal it ay 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around we gon' make me reveal it ay 
 Tool on deck, why would I lie? 
 Nigga you a pussy, hope ya got nine lives 
 I can hit a nigga with the nine, nine times 
 Country ass boy, country like LeAnne Rimes 
 Mississippi D-Banner and Lil' Weezyana 
 E'rybody got tools so you will need a hammer 
 I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga 
 I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fuckin' antenna 
 You fuckin' with this man, you can be this man's dinner 
 The nine gimme brains but the AK add liver 
 The rapper is insane flowin' like a mad river 
 Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter 
 Holly grove honcho, hard time giver 
 I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver 
 I got a girl, you wanna meet her? 
 Her name is 9mm 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay 
 If I got nine slugs, nine bullets gon' fly 
 If I got a red beam, nine people gon' die 
 Nine mamas gon' cry, nine spirits in the sky 
 Nine preachers preachin' nine sermons, tellin' nine lies 
 'Cause each and every one of y'all nine niggaz wasn't shit 
 I would have rather kept the nine rugers in the ruger clip 
 The index finger slipped, the nine let nine spit 
 I lick 'em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks 
 I'ma suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist 
 If I die nine times the next go-around's a bitch 
 And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows 
 And shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay 
 I'ma West coast original, black John Wayne 
 Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang 
 Bang, you better stop that man, fat mouth to Dogg 
 And I'ma pop-pop-bang 
 Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me 
 Niggaz wanna touch me, none of that, trust me 
 I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride 
 I set aside all my feelings when I'm killin' like a villain 
 Move quick like a cheetah, I'ma killa 
 I ain't here to lock up, I flash the heater 
 Then lock your whole block up 
 Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up 
 Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught 
 You niggaz always actin' hard 
 I keep a 9mm in my waist and got two more in the car 
 Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it 
 Tryin' to conceal, you'll fuck around and make me reveal it 
 So killas kill it 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay 
 I got a 9mm 
 Ready to go off any minute so you feel it 
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it 
 If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
