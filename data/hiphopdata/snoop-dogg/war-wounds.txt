Every soldier got a story to tell 
 I done been through it all 
 Don't ask the way I shoot 'cause I done shot (uggh) 
 Put a tank on my block 
 Fiend gone get the scene hot 
 Greens and rocks 
 Burnin' flesh 
 Have you ever smelled nigga? 
 Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas 
 Straight goin' to hell 
 But livin' the dirty, dirty 
 Havin' yah mama worry 
 That (?) 
 Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that 
 I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at 
 But when I backtracked, (?) 
 Blast back 
 Told 'em to cast that, take these rounds and add that 
 But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars 
 Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns 
 Check my war wounds (uggggh) 
 My war wounds (ugggh) 
 Every soldier got a story to tell 
 My adversary's get popped 
 Got me runnin' from cops 
 The ghetto life be a dime 
 Got me carryin' two glocks 
 My enemies is bad 
 Chop limes of grass 
 Drive-bys and rags 
 And representin' red and blue flags 
 See I got fools from the ghetto 
 Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals 
 My evidence is satus with hoes 
 Bloody Polos 
 Pullin' in car do's 
 And cut up Jabos 
 I'm down the blast for my homies 
 And cash for my homies 
 Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die 
 If the hood call me 
 That's why I be hustin' every day 
 Could you imagine me with no stash? 
 Like a bank with no cash 
 Tryin' drive a car with no gas 
 And fuck one day with no tag? 
 Shotgun with no class 
 Window with no glass 
 Or all you girls with no ass 
 See I'm a risky rider 
 Caliope crawler 
 A Down South Hustla 
 Plus a head buster from New Orleans 
 See I gotta be a paid nigga 
 A made nigga 
 Be the nigga to bust yo' shit 
 And the nigga the be the grave digga 
 See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did 
 But the move of other niggas that 'bout it 
 Feel the shit I do just tah live 
 See I been scared, popped at, and shot at 
 But I live an eye for eye 
 So the enemies I ain't forgot that 
 It's real, shit's real check my war wounds 
 This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons 
 I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube 
 Either me or you right here 
 Come back and hang out in my room 
 I done shot my rifle, trained to kill 
 Got blood on my fatiques 
 Once you in ain't no turnin' back 
 Lay yo' ass over seas 
 Might as well handle your business 
 There's no overcome to this shit 
 Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga 
 Don't cry like no bitch 
 You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga 
 And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga 
 Tell my mama not to worry 'bout me why I'm gone 
 If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home 
 Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest 
 Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best 
 Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq 
 If you don't believe me check my combat pack 
 I got a motherfuckin' story to tell 
 Nigga, nigga what? 
 A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?) 
 Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell 
 And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well 
 I shank niggas, bank niggas 
 Do mo' for show 
 Seven cluckas, fake dough 
 Stayin' way cut throat 
 I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms 
 Up all night gettin' in gun fights 
 I strike my head on the wall 
 Seven Eight ward 
 Eastside, rollin' dubs 
 Call me big Snoop Dogg 
 Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move 
 It's written on my face 
 I takes my war wounds 
 Been around drama since me and my mama 
 Use to listen to oldies 
 That's why I'm so old G 
 Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside 
 When y'all was learnin' how the sing 
 I was learnin' how the bang and ride 
 For sure bro, I told you 
 I'm a gangsta soul ja, blowin' doja 
 What a story tah tell...
