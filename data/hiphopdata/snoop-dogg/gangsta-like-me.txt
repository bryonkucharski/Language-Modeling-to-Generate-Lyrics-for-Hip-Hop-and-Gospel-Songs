Get ready (get ready), back by popular demand (he's back) Snoop Dogg! (yo) 
 (One, two, check up) 
 One, two, check up 
 Yeah one, two check up 
 Teddy with the one, two check up 
 Dogg back up in this motherfucker 
 Hoes know how to act up in this motherfucker 
 They I know I make it crack up in this motherfucker 
 All blue Chuck's and my khakis in this motherfucker 
 I'm lookin' for a thick one 
 Pecan brown, she lookin' for the slim one 
 Loves to go down, she say she likes the big one 
 I need her right now, do you know where I can get one? 
 To give me brain like a genius 
 She love my hair pressed like the cleaners 
 And got a friend named Trina 
 You see 'em from behind you'll think they Venus and Serena 
 Now that's my kinda bitch 
 Take your clothes off, damn baby, kinda thick 
 Love Snoopy blue, yeah I'm that type of Crip 
 And we was about to dip till she hit me with this trip 
 I ain't ever met another gangsta like you 
 I ain't really sure but I think I liked you 
 Give you my number to my cellular phone 
 Play my cards right, will you take me home? 
 Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me 
 We can do our thing but you can't be wifey 
 Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone 
 At the end of the night I'll take you home 
 I limp with my two step 
 Got two friends, we can have group sex 
 Nigga from the 2-1 
 Tall and skinny and always got blue on 
 Say I make cool songs 
 My nasty video made her do porn 
 And she go real far 
 Still can't believe that she's talkin' to a real star 
 Pop told me real hard 
 And threw that backshot on me real hard 
 Royal penis is clean, I'm king like the boulevard 
 Dogg do his thing, got her feelin' like a superstar 
 Wanna share her feelin's with her friends 
 Tell her husband that there's another man 
 And she say that I made her fall in love 
 I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was 
 A pimp from the beach, Gator shoes on my feet 
 Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak 
 Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up 
 I looked at the bitch like cut, dat dat dat 
 I ain't ever met another gangsta like you 
 I ain't really sure but I think I liked you 
 Give you my number to my cellular phone 
 Play my cards right, will you take me home? 
 Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me 
 We can do our thing but you can't be wifey 
 Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone 
 At the end of the night I'll take you home 
 The homies say 'cause don't do it to her 
 You gon' have to always do it to her 
 She be creepin' to your hotel, sayin' that she won't tell 
 Knowin' one night won't do it y'all 
 You know I got that gangsta 
 Make you wanna tell my mama, "Thank ya" 
 Then give me all your paper, every time I lay ya 
 Snoop Dogg, playa playa 
 I'm always with a bad bitch 
 You could say I got a bad bitch habit 
 See a bad bitch, is like a fat blunt 
 I got one but you know I got to grab it 
 So lil' mama what's happenin'? 
 Let me know if you're tryin' to get it crackin' 
 Wanna chill, when you down for the smashin'? 
 Ms. American Gangsta, Mr. Blue Magic 
 I ain't ever met another gangsta like you 
 I ain't really sure but I think I liked you 
 Give you my number to my cellular phone 
 Play my cards right, will you take me home? 
 Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me 
 We can do our thing but you can't be wifey 
 Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone 
 At the end of the night I'll take you home 
 I ain't ever met another gangsta like you 
 I ain't really sure but I think I liked you 
 Give you my number to my cellular phone 
 Play my cards right, will you take me home? 
 Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me 
 We can do our thing but you can't be wifey 
 Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone

 In the club blowin' trees with Snoop
