King of California, California king 
 Face to face, wrist to wrist, toe to toe, eye to eye 
 This is it, kiss your lips but to no avail 
 It's like a seashell, I can hear you but I can't see you 
 You a wishing well, girl, I wish you well 
 Kiss and tell, I need your touch 
 I'm in the bed all alone, puffin' on a blunt 
 I guess I need to leave you but I know I won't 
 Frequently sleep with me, creep with me 
 Spend a week with me in paradise 
 California dreamin', skeemin', you got me gleaming 
 I need you on the teamie, you get my meaning 
 It sounds crazy but it's amazing 
 Lay down with meso, we can make some babies 
 In this California king bed 
 We're ten thousand miles apart 
 I've been California wishing on these stars 
 For your heart on me, my California king 
 Eye to eye, cheek to cheek 
 Side by side you were sleeping next to me 
 Arm in arm, dusk to dawn 
 With the curtains drawn 
 And a little last night on these sheets 
 So how come when I reach out my fingers 
 It feels like more than distance between us 
 In this California king bed 
 We're ten thousand miles apart 
 I've been California wishing on these stars 
 For your heart on me, my California king 
 You and me, me and you, we can be, baby 
 All I want is you, you can be my lady 
 And I say that, let it go, lay back 
 Baby bue, you know we go way back 
 You and me, me and you, we can be, baby 
 All I want is you, you can be my lady 
 And I say that, let it go, lay back 
 Baby bue, you know we go way back 
 I make the bread, make love, make the bed 
 Girl, you got me taking my maze and shaking my head 
 In this California king bed 
 We're ten thousand miles apart 
 I've been California wishing on these stars 
 For your heart on me, my California king 
 In this California king bed 
 We're ten thousand miles apart 
 I've been California wishing on these stars 
 For your heart on me, my California king
