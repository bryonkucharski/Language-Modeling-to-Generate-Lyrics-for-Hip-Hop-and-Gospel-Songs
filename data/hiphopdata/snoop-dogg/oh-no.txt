[50 talkin:] It's 50 dent & S-N-double O-P 
 You don't want no snoop and you don't want it wit me 
 Chorus (50 cent): 
 Everytime I come around they like "Oh No" 
 I get to trippin'; slap the clip up in my 44 
 Shit I been through in my hood made my heart cold 
 I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco 
 No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out) 
 Motherfuckers light out (lights out) 
 Here comes Snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No) 
 Sup Nigga, sup now, huh? (Oh No) 
 Snoop: 
 Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol 
 Courdoroy khakis, stacies and brimmed up 
 Straight razors just to keep you trimmed up 
 1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember 
 He's electrifyin and original 
 So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal 
 The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut 
 Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit 
 You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G 
 Now step your game down, cause ain't no checkin' me 
 You'll be respectin me until you leave this room 
 Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom 
 Now your names on a tomb 
 They pourin out liqour wit no room to consume, you silly bafoon 
 I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin' em 
 Walkin' in my big blue chucks 'cause I'm killin' em 
 [Talkin:] Hey whaddup 'cause, it's 50 cent; 
 What's happnin nigga? 
 50 Cent: 
 Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin' (Yeah) 
 Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an 
 He who fears fate lives like a coward 
 You go against me, you'll be devoured 
 Then you get to poppin' you'll have a change of heart 
 I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart 
 Have doc usin' donors, dead niggas with spare parts 
 You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark 
 Niggas never see the light till it spark 
 Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark 
 You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets 
 You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me 
 These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits 
 Push Me - a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin 
 Your services are no longer needed; Rock-a-bye baby 
 My bitch'll do it to you with a lil 380 (Yeah) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 I'm bailin through the door again 
 Let the Momo pour again 
 Me and my ho again 
 Yeah she got the four up in this motherfucker 
 And Imma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka duck us 
 It'll crack off, Now back off - real slow 
 An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho 
 Yeah that's my reputation - you test my patience & 
 You and your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam 
 Goddammit I'm at it again 
 They done let that bitch nigga up outta the pen 
 And now he lookin' for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect 
 Now I'm breathin down your mortherf**kin neck 
 I dumps till my clips is empty 
 I'm headin down Willshire to send the scent-e (??) 
 And when I get there don't ask who sent me 
 Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot 
 Bitch Nigga 
 Talkin: 
 Ha-ha-ha 
 Yeah Nigga 
 Just when you thought I was gone 
 Slide back up on you like the wind nigga 
 Hurricane D-O-Double G 
 With the G, G, G, G, G, G-unit
