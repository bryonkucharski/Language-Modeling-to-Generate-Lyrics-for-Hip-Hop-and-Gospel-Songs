Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Huh, it's like that that there 
 They love it when I let down my hair 
 From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson 
 Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel 
 So I let 'em all come to my back table 
 Roll up and lick the paper if they able 
 Bottles of everything, models and everything 
 Everything goes and yes, I mean everything 
 **** Castles, I ain't sniffin' 
 But baby, that plate in that one movie is trippin' 
 So I invite her over to my party 
 Blond hair, long legs, a real live Barbie 
 No autographs, I ain't signin' now 
 Act like you been around a boss, ****settle down 
 My life is like one big highlight 
 Welcome to the **** Hollywood nightlife 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion 
 With some whites, some Asians and Persians 
 They flirtin', and I'm certain they **** 
 One night with the Dogg and it's curtains 
 She say she wanna be an actress 
 So I pointed to these **** and then I yelled, ?Action? 
 Take one, take two, now cut 
 Now turn around and let the homie Damani **** 
 Huh, yeah, here we go again 
 I gotta go behind the club just to get in 
 They say I'm just too much commotion 
 All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes, I got 'em open 
 I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub 
 Smokin' with one of the Marley's, 'One Love' 
 I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass 
 Hollywood night school my **** join my class, c'mon 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room 
 I'm on Sunset at The House of Blues 
 I just stepped in for a quick cameo 
 Me and Leonardo DiCaprio 
 He keep a bad ****, I keep a bad **** 
 He slide me new **** everywhere we go 
 Oh, the life, night after night, flight after flight 
 Yes, these Hollywood nights 
 I have a **** burnt out, some **** turned out 
 You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out 
 Cameras flashin', police passin' 
 Every little model wanna give me some action 
 So I let 'em kick it then I let 'em **** it 
 Get some [Incomprehensible] durin' every visit 
 I wouldn't leave it even if they paid me 
 The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy 
 Those Hollywood nights 
 They drive me crazy
