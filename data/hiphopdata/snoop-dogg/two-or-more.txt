You niggas don't hear me though 
 Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo 
 I walked in with a philly ho 
 Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though 
 Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees 
 The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's 
 I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me 
 Right up under my wing 
 Words I sing, verbs I bring 
 Bread to the park, head in the dark 
 Ready with art, I said it with heart 
 Merely distorted, dearly departed 
 Look what you started 
 I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded 
 Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered 
 It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p 
 Not one, not two, but three 
 I gotta have two or more 
 Two or more, baby 
 Maybe even three or four 
 Like three, like four 
 Listen to me, baby 
 I need two or more 
 Yeah 
 Maybe even three or four 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Love, drugs, and sex 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Have a seat and don't say one word 
 Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird 
 And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb 
 And come anew 
 Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through 
 Hut one, hut two 
 Down set, hike two, three, four 
 We go overtime 
 I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind 
 And take your time, relax a bit 
 I came here to mack a bitch 
 This P is so immaculate 
 I rap a bit just to taste 
 Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass 
 Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up 
 One of me, three of y'all, so lick it up 
 I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again 
 Nigga, could you sing it again? 
 I gotta have two or more 
 Two or more, baby 
 Maybe even three or four 
 Like three, like four 
 Listen to me, baby 
 I need two or more 
 Yeah 
 Maybe even three or four 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Love, drugs, and sex 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth 
 I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth 
 Original, more like a miracle 
 High definition visual, digital, minimal 
 But it can be maxed out 
 Track meet, more meat blow your back out 
 I had to pull the 'lac out 
 Cause there was too many of y'all to be left out 
 I stepped out mackish with the whole package 
 Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch 
 Or two, make it three 
 31 flavors, nigga 
 It gets no better than this 
 Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this? 
 I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again 
 Nigga, could you sing it again? 
 I gotta have two or more 
 Two or more, baby 
 Maybe even three or four 
 Like three, like four 
 Listen to me, baby 
 I need two or more 
 Yeah 
 Maybe even three or four 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Love, drugs, and sex 
 She likes love, drugs, and sex 
 Two or more
