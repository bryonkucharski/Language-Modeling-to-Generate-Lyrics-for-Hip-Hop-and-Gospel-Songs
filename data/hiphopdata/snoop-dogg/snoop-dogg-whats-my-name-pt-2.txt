 (Snoop talks over Intro) 
 Izzle kizzle, fo' schizzle 
 My nizzle, what you sizzle? 
 Fo' schizzle bizzle, ha ha 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Me and my partner, in my Impala 
 Poppin' our collars, tossin up dollars 
 A truck on the side of with hoes that wanna follow 
 Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow 
 Doggy Doggfather 
 I do it to you real hard then it gets harder 
 It's nada - thang on mine, bang on mine 
 I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time 
 It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo 
 So quit knockin' at my window, you nympho 
 Maniac, bring it back, now shake it up 
 Put it on the table, now break it up 
 Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it 
 It really don't matter what you spent on it 
 As long as you're gettin' what you paid for 
 That's what it's made for, ain't that what you stayed for? 
 Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Smoke till your eyes get cataracts 
 Snoop Dogg 
 You've got a girl lay her on her back 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Millionaire, makin' that paper stack 
 Snoop Dogg 
 (Snoop) 
 You play me and I'll play you 
 You pay me and I'll pay you 
 Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong 
 This ain't your thang, this my song 
 Move on, we in the club, at the Shark Bar 
 Valet my keys, and park my car 
 No snap shots, 'cause I might get popped 
 As I slide by security, givin' 'em props 
 First thing I do, when I get in 
 Let me take you back to when I first slid in 
 Grab my gin and, get my woman, put my bib in, no bullshittin 
 We be sippin, in the corner 
 With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin' in the sauna 
 Burnin' up the charts, break a bitch off hard 
 Little mama don't you start

 (Snoop) 
 Tick tock, the ice on my watch 
 Slap me 'cross the face around 2 o'clock 
 But the party don't stop till we blow up 
 Now every little bitch wanna show up 
 Manuev'in to this, groovin to this 
 Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin' to this 
 Ain't no skippin to this, trust this 
 Bust this, it's too hot to touch this 
 He say, she say, I say no way 
 Don't need foreplay, ok, obey 
 Everything that I say 
 And every day'll be like a holiday 
 I put you in the front seat of my car 
 And roll you round town like a superstar 
 Recline your seat and turn up the beat 
 Number one with a bullet, rollin' down the mothafuckin backstreets
