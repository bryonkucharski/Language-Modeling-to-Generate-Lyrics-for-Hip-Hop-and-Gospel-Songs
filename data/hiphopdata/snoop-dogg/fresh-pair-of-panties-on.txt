(DJ Ez Dicc) 
 It's time to slow it down, 
 Steadily grinding 
 And this is the big doggy dogg 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 And I ain't talking about no air force ones 
 I just gotta know, 
 Before you let me get some 
 Do you have a fresh pair of panties on 
 I've got to know 
 Or you could show me 
 Silk, cotton, see through, lace, your sexy thong 
 I've got to know 
 Or you could show me 
 Freak-a-leek p d 
 Let a nigga sneak a few peek-a-boo 
 Let's see what we can do 
 About freakin you, 
 Sneaking you into a quiet place 
 So I can look at it 
 Face to face 
 Let me guess, 
 You prefer to wear cotton, 
 I can tell 
 Cause you like squatten it 
 Your last dude 
 He was so rotten 
 And now your love is to begotten 
 Yeah baby girl I can read your mind 
 But what I'm really trying to do is read between your panty lines 
 I know it seems oh so personal 
 But I'm just trying to make you feel comfortable 
 I know 
 So what will it be? 
 And the type of underwear you wear, 
 Is troubling me 
 Can I get a glimpse? 
 One for the pimps 
 I've got one quesion 
 Answer me this: 
 You came by the church 
 With a whole lot of body 
 Got invited to our annual pajama party 
 Workin that lace 
 You'd think it was the first cut 
 Yeah bitch you got a big old but 
 Hiding it should be dividing it 
 It's real tight in there 
 But I got a way to widen it 
 Sliding it real smooth 
 Like with a little butter 
 Cause it getcha in the mood like 
 Zoom boom hit that boom boom 
 Right just to getcha groove right 
 I can make it happen 
 But it can't happen if you ain't good at it 
 When you gonna let a nigger have a look at it 
 Caling all callers 
 Yeah baby girl you a star 
 But it's like you if you wana go real far 
 Then let me get a glimpse 
 One for the pimps 
 I've got one question 
 Answer me this
