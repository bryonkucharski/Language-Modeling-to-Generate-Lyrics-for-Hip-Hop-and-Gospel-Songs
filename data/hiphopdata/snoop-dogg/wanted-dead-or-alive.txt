(2pac) 
 Got me up against the fence, back against the wall 
 Get to actin' like a fool, cause ain't no justice for the dog 
 Got to take it out on all y'all, better read the papers 
 All my homies goin' crazy baby only God could save us 
 Got my, min on currency hurry see I ain't worried 
 It's a gangsta party, so bad boy gettin' buried 
 Snoop dogg, why they fantasize? (fantasize) 
 When we ride, it's a must havin' sets die, every time 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 *Singing* 
 Yes yes y'all, not $hort but snoop dogg 
 And you know it's like that y'all 
 *Rapping* 
 I'm so smooth about my paper check it just how it's done 
 I'm servin' any on a platter snoop dogg corleone 
 Corleone, now do you know what that mean? 
 A teflon don to this hip-hop game, super supreme 
 It's like what happen can happen but will it stop 
 That won't happen I'm feelin' good about the mission for jackin 
 *Singing* 
 Aiyyo patnah, can you feel me? 
 Why these fools, tryin' ta kill me? 
 *Rapping* 
 It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize 
 But if I don't, the dogg won't survive 
 (2pac) 
 We ballin in my opinion eternal was wild wheel spinnin 
 One sip a minute is represented for five minutes 
 Two of the livest wanted dead or alive 
 We riders inventers because we ain't quiet and watch the g's ride 
 Two of amerikkkaz most, straight out the west coast 
 Bow down fool, this is death row 
 Been waitin way too long, bust out the pen, now it's on 
 C'mon, snoop dogg, time to bone 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Ain't nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme 
 Me and the homey pac trippin' death row on knobs 
 Gon survive by eastside of dpg'z 
 Still creepin' bump through the hood, always involved in the streets 
 (Westside!) snoop doggy dogg homey, did you forget who I was 
 The big homey to you, there it is and there it was... 
 Now take a look through the eyes of g 
 And just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat 
 (2pac) 
 All my homies tellin', me, ain't no love for a real g 
 You straight cowards all you playa haters kill me 
 Throw up your hands if you feel me 
 We gettin' dollars homey holla if you hear me 
 It's one time for my comrades doin' bad lockdown 
 Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down 
 Can you visualize perfection? 
 Cause every rider in my set labelled a vet best in their profession 
 Don't hold your breath, stick to smith and wessun 
 Steady study your lessons to keep the crowd guessin 
 (Snoop)

 Niggaz always tryin' ta creep 
 But I know what time it is 
 Gangstas, yeah yeah yeah
