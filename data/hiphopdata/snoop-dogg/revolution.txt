Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The revolution will be televised

 Just Blaze 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh

 Dududududu 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 (Yes) 
 Will be televised, will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable 
 I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle 
 Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal 
 Kick a fool down like the homie with the 8-0 
 Ayy though, nigga don't play though 
 With the [?] like the spray though 
 Sculpted left hand full of clay dough 
 Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato 
 Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine 
 We loot 'til the boot out 
 Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout 
 Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days 
 Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways 
 TEC-9's with a couple 45's 
 And the revolution will be televised 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised, will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 This ain't the local pass cash with the bra fast views 
 This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news 
 Why did I do it? My momma is on the call 
 Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall 
 Nowhere to turn and nowhere to go 
 My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow 
 Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers 
 They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years 
 Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back 
 But this time we gon' bust, step the fuck back 
 We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward 
 Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor 
 They just surrounded my place 
 Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case 
 TEC-9's with a couple 45's 
 And the revolution will be televised 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised, will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 The revolution-lution-lution-lution 
 The revolution-lution-lution-lution 
 Will be televised 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The revolution-lution-lution-lution 
 Oh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da 
 The revolution, oh, oh 
 Will be televised, will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised) 
 The revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na 
 Will be televised 
 (The revolution will be televised)
