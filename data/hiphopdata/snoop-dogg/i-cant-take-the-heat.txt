Slow down I can't take the heat 
 Slow down, it's wicked in these streets 
 (Verse 1: Snoop Dogg) 
 Life ain't nothing but a big old twist 
 A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce 
 It's funny, on how shit be 
 A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me 
 But look here, I work hard for all the things I got 
 And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot 
 You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes 
 And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors 
 But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc 
 Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke 
 Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it 
 With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas 
 And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap 
 And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back 
 You with that? 'Cause if you ain't clown 
 We from the D-O double G, we groupie true and slow down 
 (Verse 2: Mia X) 
 Ayyo Snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with niggas 
 Know about the hits, hang with killas 
 Take the broads down for jailhouse visits 
 Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga 
 Have the card parties where the stakes was high 
 Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by 
 I never had a day without no drama 
 Half the OG's age but they call me mama 
 Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag 
 Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad 
 I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real 
 Until my best friend Jill got killed 
 And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord 
 Please change my ways 'cause I'm living too hard 
 And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child 
 When I'm out here buck wild? 
 Damn I had to slow down 
 (Verse 3: Mia X) 
 Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut 
 And started putting all this game on records 
 For my come up from sun up to sun down 
 I'm trying to get my money 
 Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me 
 It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul 
 Everybody seemed glad but now they mad 
 'Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free 
 And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down 
 (Verse 4: Snoop Dogg) 
 I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun 
 I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun 
 But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round 
 The clown bound to dump, young chump 
 You don't wanna get caught up in the mix 
 'Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch 
 We don't, never ever, talk no shit 
 Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit 
 Slow down I can't take the heat 
 Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters 
 Slow down I can't take the heat 
 Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
