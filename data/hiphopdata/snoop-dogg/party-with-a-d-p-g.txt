Stacey Boots, perms and suits, I'm braided up, can fade it up 
 I skated up, you waited up, so you know I got to go ahead and tear shit up 
 Turn lose on these muthafuckers Jelly Roll 
 Nephew, boy this shit is out of control 
 Rockin', rollin', bangin' b 
 A little something, something nigga, that's banged up streets 
 Freak, freak y'all, into the beat y'all 
 And to all my big doggs grab your meat cha'll 
 And yes, yes y'all, oh we the best y'all 
 We got the shit that make the bitches grab they breast y'all 
 It don't stop till the wheels fall off 
 954 headed swervin in the goodin clinic, tryin' keep it hot right 
 Fuckers spot light, my nigga Jelly Roll make it knock light 
 We all shinin' stars 
 Y'all know who you are 
 And dip low lows with me 
 You party with a D.P.G. 
 We ridin', dippin, slippin, slidin, eastside up eastsiders 
 Riders, ballers, rollers, ladies, 
 Players, gangstas, macks, pimps, and 'llacs 
 Hustlers, bitches, niggas and G's, we having big thangs blowing trees 
 Shinin, grinin, refuse to lose 
 I gotta a G in my pocket for dippin out of shoes 
 I head the corner in the Navigator 
 Committed to excellence like a Raider 
 You hate a nigga like me but you got to love me 
 Your lady wanna shove me and your kids wanna hug me 
 A nigga fuckin' like Buggsy Seagal again, I'm in the ringle again 
 I do it all legal again, I can't lose you won't win, respect the boss 
 If you run up, you gettin' done up, I love to floss 
 Why you acting bad, probably 'cause I'm know as the bad actor 
 In the rap game I'm the big factor, macker, smack a bitch in a second 
 The big dogg nigga very well respected 
 You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top 
 The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop 
 I thought I told ya, nigga I'm a soldier 
 No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it 
 I'm committed like a motherfucker supposed to be 
 Won't let no bitch niggaz close to me 
 From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm 
 'Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me 
 And fuck who wanna kill me 
 You niggaz thrill me, but guess what will be 
 On top tip top, non stop, dogg not 
 And you gotta let me end, the nigga I'm a shine like a G
