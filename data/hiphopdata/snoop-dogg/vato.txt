I was chilling, right around my way 
 21St Eastside at a beach 
 This motherfucker ran up on me 
 Talking shit with his homies like he was 
 A straight... 
 G! 
 Asking where I'm from while he running up, Gangbang my set'll nag one of them 
 Some things, sons they just won't change 
 Fools don't respect nothing but the gang bang 
 What's seen is what's sawn, Dogg is the law, I hate you niggas running like a marathon, Lil G's tryna creep on the east wit it, Talking bout they gon get my chain and they gon leave with it 
 But they don't know, once they get close its tic tac toe, 3 motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out), Yeah this happened yesterday, on the West they Spray 
 I Heard an Ese Say... 
 He said... 
 Vato you won't believe what they saw 
 I saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?) 
 They twisted fingers say you know who we are... 
 He said: I don't give a fucking Snoop Doggy Dogg... (Ah huh) 
 They kept talking and it went too far 
 So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?), he got his gun and they start running hard, he started firing and then he just charged... 
 PLOW! 
 (2X) 
 Run Nigga, Run Nigga (Plow) 
 Duck Nigga, Duck Nigga (Plow) 
 Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 
 Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 
 I didn't mean to hit what I hit 
 Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit 
 But these niggas a scream wit plea but for like a G like me it's just a case 
 Believe and you can see 
 I crack the mac back and pop off rolling 
 And smack your neck back, you drop off falling 
 I haven't seen my mama in a week 
 And she ain't even ran her mouth about me 
 Fuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law 
 Niggas say they wanna brawl 
 You would think that they wore bra's 
 Believe in all the things that you never saw 
 In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menathol 
 You think you know? But this can't go 
 You think you'll blow, all my dough? 
 What the fuck, no 
 See these niggas proceed with speed 
 So feel the need to bleed 
 All you hear my enemies going 
 Vato you won't believe what they saw 
 I saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?) 
 They twisted fingers say you know who we are... 
 He said: I don't give a fuck I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg... (Ah huh) 
 They kept fucking and it went too far 
 So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?), he got his gun and they start running hard, he started firing and then he just charged... 
 PLOW! 
 (2X) 
 Run Nigga, Run Nigga (Plow) 
 Duck Nigga, Duck Nigga (Plow) 
 Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 
 Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 
 I wouldn't be the nigga that I am 
 If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth 
 God Damn 
 If Snoop a keep a foot on the streets 
 And lead and cover the sheets 
 Run wit them niggaz wit the heat 
 You never seen a thug like this 
 You never seen a dub like me 
 And I ain't weak for wanting peace in fact 
 I could be beast of the East motherfucker 
 I never hesitate to blaze 
 A nigga really tryna change his ways 
 We gotta move my team 'cause my people's 
 Are screaming that we need more for fun or is it legal (With a bang) 
 On this song make it feel like a drive-by 
 It's ashame but somebody gotta die 
 They say it happens state to state 
 But when I'm mobbin' LA 
 All I hear the Ese's say they go 
 Vato you won't believe what they saw 
 I saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?) 
 They twisted fingers say you know who we are... 
 He said: I don't give a fuck I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg... (Ah huh) 
 They kept fucking and it went too far 
 So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?), he got his gun and they start running hard, he started firing and then he just charged...
