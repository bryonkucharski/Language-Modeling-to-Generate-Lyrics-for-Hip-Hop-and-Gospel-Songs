 (Snoop) 
 Look here babygirl D.O.G.'s we get lonely 
 You can ask all my homies, all D.P.G. got tenderoni's

 And phone call away is what you say 
 But some times you got to find time to get up 
 To get out and get away You feel me 
 Now all I want to do is stay real and stay true 
 I'm trying to have a little something, and keep you satisfied, but 
 [When] my homeboys say its time to ride then I'm a ride
