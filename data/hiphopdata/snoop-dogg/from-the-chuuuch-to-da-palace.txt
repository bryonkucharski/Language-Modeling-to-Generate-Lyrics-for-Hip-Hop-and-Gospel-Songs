Fa shizzle dizzle, it's the big Neptizzle 
 With the Snoopy D O Double Gizzle 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 C-walk to this 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Yeah, C-walk to this 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 C-walk to this 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Bam! Boom! Whatchu gon' do 'cause? 
 Guess who rollin' in with them baby blue Chucks? 
 And I've still got my khakis creased 
 I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets 
 It's the S N double O P'n 
 Biggest dogg of 'em all and youse a flea'n 
 And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must 
 And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust 
 I keep the heat on deck but in God we trust 
 And can't none of y'all fuck with us 
 But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely 
 These thrillers are contagious just like Ron Isley 
 ("What the hell is goin' on?") 
 Someone's sleepin' in my home 
 Snoop to the D O Double G 
 Get in where you fit in, follow me 
 Who's the man with that dance? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Who keep the khakis for all his pants? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Still got the Gin and Juice in hand 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers 
 Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters 
 Eff the police 'cause all they wanna do is cuff us 
 The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher 
 But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin' them G stacks 
 And got them cornrows to the back 
 I ain't really tryin' to be picky 
 But if you give me somethin' it's got to be the sticky 
 Green by the ounces, low-low's bouncin' 
 Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin' on my couch and 
 Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain 
 That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n 
 This year we ain't fuck it with thousands 
 We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon 
 Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace 
 With a car fulla bitches cookin' grits like Alice 
 Who's the man with that dance? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Who keep the khakis for all his pants? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Still got the Gin and Juice in hand 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Three 14 inch rims is running on the side 
 (They're riding on the side?) 
 Yeah, they running on the side 
 Three 14 inch rims is running on the side 
 (They're riding on the side?) 
 Yeah, they running on the side 
 Three 14 inch rims is running on the side 
 (They're riding on the side?) 
 Yeah, they running on the side 
 Three 14 inch rims is running on the side 
 (They're riding on the side?) 
 Yeah, they running on the side 
 Take two and pass it, it will not burn you 
 From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal 
 They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe 
 Ask Bill Gates, "Yeah, I know the homie Snoop" 
 Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin' wit' my folk and 
 Follow Rakim 'cause I ain't no joke and 
 'Cause I done seen so much 
 (Like what?) 
 Enough to have your feelings touched 
 When the gunshots ratta, all your boys scatter 
 Check up on your homies but they gave ya bad data 
 Make a nigga stop breathin', have his soul relievin' 
 And now you niggaz believe in 
 What I say 'cause what I say is so real 
 Homie you don't wanna see the steel 
 You don't wanna catch a body, you came here to party 
 Now that's what you should do 
 Now where's my baby boo? 
 Who's the man with that dance? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Who keep the khakis for all his pants? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Still got the Gin and Juice in hand 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Yeah, no introduction is needed 
 But for those who still refuse to accept 
 The reading on the wall for the new Mack-allenium

 Chairman of the Board of famous players everywhere 
 And I'm puttin' it down with Big Snoop Dogg, the legend 
 The King Player, my friend, yo' friend 
 The L.B.C. savior 
 Also known in this new Mack-allenium as Da Boss
