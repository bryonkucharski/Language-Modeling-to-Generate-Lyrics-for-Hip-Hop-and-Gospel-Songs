You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again 
 It's like clock again, the hood rock again 
 You should pop it in, ain't take it out 
 That shit play on, you can't make it out 
 The world ain't set for what I'm about to do 
 Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two 
 I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop 
 Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops 
 We can shoot, we can scrap 
 We can rap, we can act 
 We can mack these bitches, whatever you want 
 Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front 
 How it be on the West, forever the hunt 
 But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye) 
 Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die) 
 Waitin' on school by (By by) 
 Have you on the news by (By) 
 Y'all know how the story goes 
 We give a fuck about award shows 
 Same shit about hoes 
 Real niggas own platinum balls 
 I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls 
 I think y'all just tryin' to insight us 
 Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz 
 All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride 
 That's when my shit flies 
 And here's where the pimp lies 
 I spit game at the globe 
 First week deuce five 
 I'd rather be ridin' than walkin' 
 While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin' 
 All you high paid niggas stay fly 
 I'ma slide left, fly right on by 
 I'ma do it on the boulevard 
 Fast bitches, fast cars and stars 
 Stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar 
 Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah 
 It's funny how the game goes 
 New face but they look like the same hoes 
 I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre 
 Stay focused, bang I done hit a day 
 Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies 
 Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi 
 My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin' 
 You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho' 
 I can see you walkin' under the Earth 
 My gun burst em' 
 And I still got my first mil' 
 Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt 
 Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest 
 G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South 
 Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me 
 A word from me, exclusive as a surgery 
 But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin' 
 Like that 
 Whole staff'll come through and spin 
 Either on the film or the two-inch wheel 
 Behind the wheel of a sixty-four 
 I can't stop till I done fifty totes 
 Y'all motherfuckers know me 
 I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe 
 (Repeat x4) 
 Rock on, rock on keep movin' on 
 Groovin' on and hold ya on
