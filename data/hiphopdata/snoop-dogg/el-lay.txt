 LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway 
 Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali 
 Don't go 'less you go hard 
 Go 'less you go hard 
 Hollywood, downtime and back 
 Life is always good 
 It's not an act we so fresh, so hood 
 You knew that it never would 
 Knew that it never would 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings, Angels, Clippers 
 Real set trippers 
 Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers 
 ESPN, you know Sports Centre 
 Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet 
 Home of the NBA championship 
 Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told 
 It's the city where you shoot your favourite television episode 
 And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard 
 But you gotta have a Low-rider car 
 With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin' 
 Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon 
 That's how we represent it though 
 Birthplace of Chevrolet '64 
 Yeah I love showing it out 
 First things first my nig', you better know where you at 
 You in... 
 LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway 
 Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali 
 Don't go 'less you go hard 
 Go 'less you go hard 
 Hollywood, downtime and back 
 Life is always good 
 It's not an act we so fresh, so hood 
 You knew that it never would 
 Knew that it never would 
 Riding on the 405 
 On my way to pick up baby 
 85 in the winter time 
 Man, this place is crazy 
 I love it, love it, love it, love it 
 Southern surfer Cali 
 (Snoop Doog - Verse 2) 
 Rollin' down Fairfax 
 Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico 
 Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes 
 I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues 
 About 9 o clock stop by the record shop 
 And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball 
 Life is a mystery, my life is like history 
 Stop by my dispensary 
 Give me some kush and pusha 
 Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk 
 But it's all legal in LA 
 Everybody taking a hit from the politicians 
 Athletes and even the teachers 
 My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher 
 He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya" 
 Yeah, I love showing you now 
 First things first, my nig' you better know where you at 
 You in... 
 LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway 
 Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali 
 Don't go 'less you go hard 
 Go 'less you go hard 
 Hollywood, downtime and back 
 Life is always good 
 It's not an act we so fresh, so hood 
 You knew that it never would 
 Knew that it never would
