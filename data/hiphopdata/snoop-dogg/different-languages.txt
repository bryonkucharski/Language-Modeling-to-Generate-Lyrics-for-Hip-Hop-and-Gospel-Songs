You make me say [x3] 
 Oh 
 You make me say [x3] 
 I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling so hot a nigger got me crib walking 
 I'm from the suburbs but it's that good you make a good girl wanna get to the hood 
 You make me say [x3] 
 So good got me speaking different languages 
 Is you alive 
 Like a side du 
 All I wanna do is like be inside you 
 Ride you 
 Try to find you 
 Fill you 
 Revive you 
 Going with your bad self baby 'cause I do adore 
 And I give you more 
 Put it on you all the time you know me a more 
 We got for sure, pure, alivea lore 
 Don't trip I ain't leaving you for 
 Jake got Beyonce I got Shante 
 With no entree that's my baby 
 You know the thing about 
 When I bring 'em out feels so good I had to sing about 
 Get it get it now 
 We flying out of town checking in the suite 
 Pedicure on my feet 
 Miss Bow Wow queen of the town 
 Hey yo Jaz tell 'em how I put it down 
 Is it the way you look 
 Is it the way you walk 
 Is it the way you cook 
 Is it the way you talk 
 I think it's all of the above 
 No play time in the day time making love 
 Kids go to school 
 We can act a fool 
 Skinny dip in the pool 
 Do it real smooth 
 Miss Bow Wow queen of the town 
 Hey yo Jaz tell 'em how I put it down 
 Hey baby 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 You got me going outta my head 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 You got me saying thing I don't understand 
 Ladies, if your man make you say, he hear to stay, he's hear to stay [x2] 
 Oh oh yes I am 
 This my plan 
 You my girl, I'm your man 
 Take your pain 
 Take my hand 
 Take my name 
 Make my kids 
 Do your thing 
 Ain't no game 
 Show no shame 
 If I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name 
 So I got you got 2 1 2 
 Put your face on my back brand new tattoo 
 20 year in the game what love won't do 
 A lot of women want me but I want you 
 You look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows 
 Nowadays I ain't moving that wow 
 I changed my style it might happen to you 
 What gotten to me shit I gotten to you 
 And start raping about things like love and being true 
 Now maybe we could make another baby or two 
 You make me say [x3] 
 So good got me speaking different languages
