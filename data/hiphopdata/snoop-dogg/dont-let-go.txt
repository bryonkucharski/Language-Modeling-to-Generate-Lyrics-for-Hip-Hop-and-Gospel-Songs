 Life, life 
 (Don't Let Go) 
 I'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest 
 The smoothest of the smoothest and locest of the locest 
 The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together 
 So kindly, and you can find on the coast with the most lambs 
 High post, plain coast with a bunch thug niggas, drug dealers 
 Project fools, C-Murder past dem tools 
 Shit I'm bout to make these motherfuckers get up 
 I draw the line between yours and mine 
 And make sure you don't get lit up 
 Hit ha on the motha fickin set when dip 
 Dogg pound mutha Fuckin' gangsta crew 
 Split wigs for a livin' everydays thanksgiving 
 Mutha fuck y'all rides, we slides we dippin 
 Nigga the tanks, driven by the colonel Mr. Master P 
 Lil Silkky, Mystikal, C and me and Fiend 
 Nigga don't be trippin', you got my lil homie in the cut 
 That Soulja Slim nigga, he known for dippin 
 Wassup 
 (Don't let go) 
 If you love ta bang bang 
 And the rap game is just like the dope game 
 The minute you forget it, forget it you finished 
 Them niggas know when you ain't with it 
 That's when they get ignent 
 (Don't let go) 
 Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with this 
 It seems its on, but its off, I keep missin' this shit 
 I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye 
 Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip 
 (Don't let go) 
 Like a twista like a twista get twisted with this 
 It seems its on but its off I keep missing this shit 
 I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye 
 Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip

 'Cause I'm a pistol strappin car jackin hoe slappin MC 
 I don't know why all y'all bitches is fuckin' with me 
 Fuck all my enemies, and chasin cheese with cheese 
 Circuit tapes with CD's by the 3's in keys 
 Biggie was too large and Tupac was too real 
 Niggas had homies with heat on the street and he got killed 
 How the fuck did that happen I thought y'all niggas was rappin' 
 Shit but in this real world shit, murder thnags keep crackin' 
 Besides drive bys and kiddnapping 
 Shit when you head up out the door foget the four four 
 Never leave home without it 
 Now why dog, niggas everywhere gettin' rowdy and 'bout it 
 And don't doubt it, real violence aside and don't forget it 
 It's like I said When you ain't with it niggas get ignent 
 (Don't let go) 
 Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with dis 
 It seems its on but its off I keep missing this shit
