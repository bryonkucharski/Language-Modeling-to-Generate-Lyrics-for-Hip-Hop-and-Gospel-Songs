 Yeah, what's happenin'? 
 This one is dedicated to my niggaz 
 All my niggaz, out there, Gz Up, Hoes Down 
 Yeah 
 Verse One: 
 Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen 
 Snoop Doggy doggs on the mic pay attention 
 1, 2, or what shall I do ?, I'm slippin on my 
 Khaki suit (which one?) the blue one, gun by 
 My side, as I mob to the beach, on a mission 
 And I'm fishin 
 For my DJ Warren G, now I look for the bud's sack 
 And see where my loves at, on the lake where the doves at 
 Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's 
 Saggin like a motherfucker khakis to they knees 
 Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover 
 I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg not your average motherfucker see 
 Some of you don't know about the G thang baby 
 It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' ya crazy 
 Now as ya groove to the beat, and ya move to the sound 
 I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz Up, Hoes Down 
 Well, all the real Gz please stand up and 
 Let all be accounted for, and if you don't give a fuck 
 About a bitch, then you're rolling with the row 
 Verse Two: 
 Back with the 1,2,3, and to the Fo' 
 It's the S-N-O and to the O... P 
 Why am I so fly? (I don't know, but) Why am I so high? 
 It's the indo, I don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this 
 Fuckin' with the Chronic, 'cause the Chronic gives me dopeness 
 Now focus your eyes on these 
 Follow me, as I take ya rollin' with the Real OG's 
 East Side, is the motherfuckin place, known as home 
 Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, and 20 grand, and 
 Some of you don't know about the G thang baby 
 It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' ya crazy 
 Now as ya groove to the G-Funk, and move to the sound 
 I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz Up, Hoes Down 
 Hell yeah, YaknowhatI'msayin? 
 This is stricly for the Gz, yeah 
 Fuck that bitch 
 Niggaz alwayz be handcuffin that hoe 
 When a nigga like me steps in the place 
 I don't want that hoe, I don't love that hoe 
 I'm caught up with my greens: collard greens, indo, and the cash flow 
 YaknowhatI'msayin? 
 Peace... 
 Gz up, Hoes Down
