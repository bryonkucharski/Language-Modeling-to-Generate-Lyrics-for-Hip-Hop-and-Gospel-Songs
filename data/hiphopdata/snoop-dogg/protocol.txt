Watch your mouth, never speak on what you not know 
 I'm from the west coast, I turn his face into a pothole 
 15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe 
 Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya 
 Sideways like a taco 
 Rap niggas we all talk like a Raldo 
 Trunk full of cargo, dry like Bar stow 
 Arsenal run up on 'em, get up on 'em 
 Drill 'em with the clips, niggas gon' respect mine 
 I run this whole shit, crip rag in my pocket 
 Three eighty on my hip but back to this hip hop 
 Who next on the list 
 Gangstas don't kiss, we get old and die rich 
 I smoke till I'm sleep, crush these niggas with my fist 
 Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch 
 So back to the glock with the infra-blue clip 
 We hit licks and gang bang, you on some T-pain shit 
 Chop the pop and 20 crip, watch the flames hit his whip 
 Then I'm back to the block shit, rock shit, hot shit 
 Hit 'em in the chest, doggy run up in his pockets 
 Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket 
 I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits 
 Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket 
 You heard what they say, don't block it till you knock it 
 You stole my whole style 
 I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage, brah, bhrah 
 From the looks to the hooks 
 I'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book 
 There's only one king, is you a pawn or a rook? 
 I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot 
 So beef with me it's none, nigga done south, huh 
 I throw a bullet at ya who gon' catch it nigga duck 
 Then send them goons at ya 
 Turn your weapons into dust 
 You against me, it's like trying to fight a bus 
 I'm at the BET Awards, sitting in disgust, it's still a 
 G Thang) 
 But yet they wanna be us, they wanna be Daz 
 They wanna be Kurupt 
 Cash on delivery money up front, yeah 
 Bubble kush out a purple blunt 
 Who's the best nigga circle one 
 Snoop Dogg, I'm large in the streets 
 My arms and my feets knee deep in the game 
 I'm the best on the beat, let you little niggas speak 
 And run for a treat, motherfuckin' geeks 
 All y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace 
 And that's our D.P.G. motherfucka 
 That's real shit man, how the fuck y'all gon' keep 
 Having these award shows out here on the west coast 
 But ain't no mutherfuckas from the west coast 
 Winning no awards, nigga? It's like that, it's just like that 
 We showed you niggas how to do this shit 
 Bitch ass nigga, want some, get some 
 Bad enough, take some
