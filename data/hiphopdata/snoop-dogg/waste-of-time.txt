Yo, this next record right here is a dedication 
 This dedicated to those who've come to an end 
 Quit like Gladys Knight 
 You know neither one of us wants 
 To be the first one to say goodbye 
 So, hopefully this record will help you 
 Get to the conclusion, ya dig? 
 I love this girl but I don't know about her 
 As a matter of fact, I could go without her 
 But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother 
 To try to make it work when she make it so harder 
 Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow 
 I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow 
 For you to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo 
 That's what I get for **** with a video model 
 Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle 
 I used to put it on yo' ****, you ain't had it in a while 
 Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a **** style 
 You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle 
 What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk 
 When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks 
 So it's best we go our separate ways and stay apart 
 No more me and you, boo, I done had a change of heart 
 You're just a 
 Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you 
 But I'm not in love with you 
 I'm not sayin', I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you 
 But I'm not in love with you 
 And it feels like such a 
 Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright 
 Go your way and I'll go mine 
 I'm cool and I ain't even trippin' 
 I'ma roll out with Raphael 
 Yeah, fo sho, I'ma roll with him 
 I'm cool, you go your way, I go mine 
 I guess I'll see ya next lifetime 
 See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
