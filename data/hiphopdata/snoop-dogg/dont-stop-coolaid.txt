Damn, I still hear my mama voice 
 "Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!" 
 Hah, if she only knew what I was 'bout to get off into 
 Bang 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop being you, don't stop being G 
 Egotistical, mystical, officially 
 Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash 
 G in the bag with the C on the flag 
 We some real OGs baby 
 I was getting money in the 80's daily 
 Niggas like me don't never quit 
 And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch 
 You got to tell 'em what it is, don't play with the game 
 I love it when you call a bitch out of her name 
 Don't you dare try to save that ho 
 I know that you like her but you can't wife her 
 I'm going on a tour 'round the world 
 Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls 
 Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho' can you save some for me? 
 Nah, but you can come and work for me 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop being real, don't stop that rap 
 Don't stop showing homies how to shake that trap 
 I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it 
 I don't stop 'cause I know y'all gon' fuck with it 
 We keep going full speed ahead with this 
 Niggas ain't did the shit 
 Niggas ain't real as this 
 We came through and peeled his bitch so quick 
 From the 80's with a dope sack in my hand 
 To the 90's with a DJ and a microphone stand 
 Can't stop now, I'm in way too steep 
 Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep 
 Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs 
 The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls 
 Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y'all 
 Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop getting lit with the shit I spit 
 I know you're down with the Dogg, I know you're fucking with this 
 Don't stop, won't stop, this is all I know 
 From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl 
 Don't stop getting money, bring that shit back 
 Don't stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked 
 Can't say much now 'cause I'm moving a crowd 
 I'm moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous 
 Hundreds of pounds, green leaves 
 I made it out the motherfucking mean streets 
 And I still go back and touch the youth 
 I teach 'em how to ball and I teach 'em how to shoot 
 In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team 
 Teach 'em how to rise to the top just like cream 
 Remain supreme by any means 
 Badda bang, badda bing 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop it, don't stop 
 Don't stop at all
