Yeah wassup baby girl 
 I'm just looking over this homework 
 I really need some help 
 You wanna study with me? 
 That'd be nice, yeah 
 I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy? 
 And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with 
 Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with 
 Five days out the week, my stay's out the street 
 It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet 
 Honeydew, money do 
 But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh 
 Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed 
 I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet 
 Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind 
 Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it 
 Look at you girl, you got me dedicated 
 Uh, put me on the game 
 Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame 
 Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change 
 Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains 
 And just 'cause I don't play, who say I can't ball? 
 My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall 
 So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on 
 Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall 
 Devin there you are, look at my repertoire 
 Spitting game, you know for reppin hard 
 Change that perspective, that's my objective 
 Cool and oh so collective, connected 
 Check this, I need you more that you could know 
 See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow 
 Let it go, let me know where to meet at 
 Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that 
 Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that 
 I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at 
 Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that 
 I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
