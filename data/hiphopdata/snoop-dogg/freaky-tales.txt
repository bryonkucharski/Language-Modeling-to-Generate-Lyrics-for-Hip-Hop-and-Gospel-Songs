These are the tales, the freaky tales 
 These are the tales that I tell so well 
 These are the tales, the freaky tales 
 These are the tales that I tell so well 
 I met this girl, her name was Joan 
 She loved the way I rocked on the microphone 
 When I met Joan, I took her home 
 She was just like a doggie all on my bone 
 I met another girl, her name was Ann 
 All she wanted was to freak with a man 
 When I met Ann, I shook her hand 
 We ended up freakin by a garbage can 
 The next young freak, I met was Red 
 I took her to my house and she gave me head 
 She like blowin' dicks, is all she said 
 We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed 
 There's another girl, her name is Sherry 
 You talk about sex and the girl acts scary 
 I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry 
 Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry 
 Young and tender, sweet Denise 
 Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast 
 I tell you homeboy if you get a piece 
 She'll only start talkin' bout signin a lease 
 I met a young tender, her name is Lori 
 An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story 
 She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa 
 And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser 
 My girlfriend's name, was Michelle 
 Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale 
 When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well 
 Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell 
 I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi 
 I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly? 
 She had a best friend, her name was Janet 
 I pulled her to the side and I spit that game 
 I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan 
 I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam 
 The very next day, I saw her with her man 
 One week passed, and I was in her again 
 I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine 
 She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen 
 She likes to freak, she's just a fiend 
 It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans 
 I want a big freak, fat and sloppy 
 I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me 
 Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta 
 A country broad from Alabama 
 I met this freak, her name was Beth 
 Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death 
 I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat 
 But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath 
 Bake, and, shake, ups 
 I met this freak in Vegas 
 She she said her name was Don-na 
 She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na 
 I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo 
 I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe 
 You can break yourself, but you can't break me 
 You never met a player like Snoop baby" 
 I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe 
 I took her to my house and we did it on the flo' 
 The girl got freaky let me tell you mo' 
 She was down on her knees, beggin to blow 
 She's like another freak, named Renee 
 You get her all alone and she'll make your day 
 Like Burger King, she knows the play 
 And with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way 
 These are the tales, the freaky tales 
 These are the tales that I tell so well 
 These are the tales, the freaky tales 
 These are the tales that I tell so well!
