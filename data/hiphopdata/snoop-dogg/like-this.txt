 I feel like a player 
 When I move and dance to the song 
 All I wanna do is get my groove on 
 Like this 
 I throw my hands like Marvin 
 Sorta like James Brown 
 How I get down 
 I'm holding my chain 
 So it don't swing 
 I'm sliding my feet 
 Staying on the beat 
 I dip low 
 Then bring it back slow

 They call the game quickly

 Eyes on us 
 While we move to the clap 
 I'm nice with the jams 
 And I'm smooth with the rap 
 We in the zone with the lights and glamour 
 Glass full of Patron 
 Cold as grammar 
 Coat made of panther
