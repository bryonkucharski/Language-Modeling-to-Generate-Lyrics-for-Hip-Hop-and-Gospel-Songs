A bitch is a bitch, whether she poor or rich 
 She still gettin' a gang of dicks 
 It don't matter what you do or say 
 'Cause bitch you can't change my feelings no way 
 I been across the whole U.S.A 
 Same ol' hoes on different days 
 Just ask my big homeboy Snoop de Snoop 
 Bitch you ain't cute, with all that 
 I might just rock ya, I ain't afraid to blast 
 I might rock a fella like Dame and dash 
 Grip the heater and slap your ass 
 Cock it back, automatic clap your ass 
 Now this is how a gangster mash out 
 The homies in the coupe, me and Snoop in the glass house 
 Bouncin', bouncin' 
 Blaze up a whole ounce and get the Ramen with the cotton candy 
 Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the robbers say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on 
 Yeah 
 I'm out to paper count the paper bump some bitches and move 
 I take a trip with my click on a three day cruise 
 Spank the corner in the fo', sittin' low gettin' low 
 Now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler 
 Top dollar with the gold flea collar 
 Dippin' in my blue Impala 
 They say Snoop Dogg is a fool, 'cause he got the bitches 
 And the little homey sellin' weed up outta high school 
 I never ever break the law, I just bend it 
 Keep everything splendid, that's how I intend it 
 Class is in session, you might get suspended 
 If you don't shut the fuck up and listen for a minute 
 I been in it for life, with two kids and a wife 
 With no tattoos just stress and stripes, so 
 I'ma do what I feel and do what I like 
 But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night 
 Ride on 
 Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the robbers say, ride on 
 (Can't get caught up) 
 Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the honies say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on 
 Nigga gimme e'rything you got, from your hat 
 To your contacts, T shirt to your socks 
 Dogg Pound affiliate? Hell, naw nigga 
 Certified branded Cedar Paul nigga 
 Mashin', grey and blue all day 
 All night all heated with heaters, mac elevens 
 Nine millimeters, what up Big Nate? 
 I got a bitch that gobble up dicks like steak 
 She lives upstate, and I don't think 
 Near a one of those bitches is proper, stash the chopper 
 DPology but first call Snoop 
 What up big homey niggaz with the swoop 
 The homey jumps in whips out the four pound 
 When we get there, we shakin' all motherfucker down 
 It's what I had in mind, let's get paid 
 Hit the spot just like a raid one of the homies got a gauge, come on 
 Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on 
 Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on

 I mean this game is gettin' real deep 
 We got niggaz that be misrepresentin' 
 I mean, motherfuckers you know thinkin' that DPG 
 Is a motherfuckin' football game or a football team or somethin' 
 Niggaz walkin' on and shit like they free agents 
 And just leavin' when they want to 
 Nigga this ain't no game, this is a motherfuckin' way of life 
 DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta 
 Nigga, the fuck wrong with these niggaz, man? 
 Niggaz be straight tryin' to put they little twist down 
 But you know we tryin' to stay two steps ahead of the game baby 
 Y' know? Let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially you 
 You done stepped in some Dogg shit, check your shoes 
 Nigga this ain't Hollywood, the House of Blues 
 It's the Dogg House, so regroup your troops 
 And tell 'em it's Kurupt and Snoop 
 Fuck your crew it's on I take your Brome 
 It's Don Corleone in the Chronic zone 
 I turn your dubs into nickels, while I'm chillin' 
 I melt your rhymes into icicles, while I'm killin' 
 Sell 'em, I tell 'em, Kurupt, what's up? 
 I know you feel like, givin' it up 
 We can't stop, won't stop, what foe 
 'Cause every other day another nigga tryin' to pull a dulo 
 You know, when I was fuckin' with the hood 
 It was all bad, thought it was all good 
 A nigga had to take a breather 
 Now I'm Living Single like Khadijah, 'cause they'll squeeze ya 
 Fuck a feeding fish, I put my dick in your bitch 
 And make a wish, ha hah 
 Nigga that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist 
 Yeah, Dogg Pound gangsta
