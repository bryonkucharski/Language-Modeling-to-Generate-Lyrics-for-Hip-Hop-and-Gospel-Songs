Let's forget where we are and what's goin' on 
 Let's forget who we are and who we know 
 Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be? 
 Come on baby we can escape, run away with me 
 You like the way that I dress 
 (You love the way that I see) 
 You love the things that I do 
 (Yes but I love that you are free) 
 You love the way I think 
 (For people everywhere) 
 We're approaching the brink but who cares 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 Run away, run away with me 
 Come and play, come and play with me 
 Run away, yes do the day with me 
 Let's escape, yes do the day with me 
 Let's forget who we were and wanted to be 
 Let's forget who was there, trust me please 
 Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be? 
 They won't put their guns away, run away with me 
 You like the way that I dress 
 (You love the way that I see) 
 You love the things that I do 
 (Yes but I love that you are free) 
 You love the way I think 
 (For people everywhere) 
 We're approaching the brink but who cares 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 Run away, run away with me 
 Come and play, come and play with me 
 Run away, yes do the day with me 
 Let's escape, yes do the day with me 
 I don't understand why do they live so violently 
 Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be 
 Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be? 
 Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me 
 You like the way that I dress 
 (You love the way that I see) 
 You love the things that I do 
 (Yes but I love that you are free) 
 You love the way I think 
 (For people everywhere) 
 We're approaching the brink but who cares 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 The world is getting ablaze, yeah 
 Run away, run away with me 
 Come and play, come and play with me 
 Run away, yes do the day with me 
 Let's escape, yes do the day with me
