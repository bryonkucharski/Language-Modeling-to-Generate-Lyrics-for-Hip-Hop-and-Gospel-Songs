Say, man, hey, ushers, deacons, lock the do' 
 I love to give you light 
 Geah, first of all, givin' honor to God 
 An' all the ministers on the pulpits, ushers 
 Deacons, an' my lovely choir, they sound so beautiful 
 Don't you agree? Sing it, sister 
 Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R an' G 
 Rhythm an' Gangsta, The Masterpiece, such a heavenly experience 
 Alchemist, break it down for me nephew 
 Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch 
 In the beginnin', as a child I was chosen 
 Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened 
 Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog 
 Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball 
 As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message 
 To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage 
 It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap 
 I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers an' gangbangin' an' dope dealin' 
 Cold feelin' to be a product of niggaz around you 
 Once you get on top, they down you 
 But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin' 
 I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often 
 With a blue rag, bangin' the dub, fo' fifth coffin' 
 At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside 
 Where most of the big homies had a glock an' flossed the G ride 
 Niggaz throwin' up hands but it wasn't no peace signs 
 Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine 
 Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin' up 
 Disrespectin' my home, not carin' 'bout what mom was sayin' 
 An' then I found out that Mom wasn't playin' 
 Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand 
 Get my life right, step it up, nigga, be a man 
 Never be a victim of what the system might hit you with 
 Through the stripes still gotta shine my light 
 I've grown, to comprehend the game 
 My name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg, just a block an' a phone call away 
 I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist 
 I'm preachin' just what I practice to each an' all 
 I got a word from the beach to across the globe 
 Man, woman, young an' old 
 Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite 
 Many circumstances, Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you 
 An' the people that is locked up, locked down 
 An' the people that's locked down 
 Also God should purchase the new Escalade 
 On 24's, with the spinnin' thangs, ha ha 
 I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors 
 'Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin' to Heaven, huh? An' you ain't gon' go 
 So I need you right now to look at your neighbor 
 An' say, "Neighbor", say, "Neighbor, you ain't goin', you ain't goin'"
