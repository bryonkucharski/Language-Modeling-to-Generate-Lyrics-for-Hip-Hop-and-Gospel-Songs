 Imma do me 
 Imma do me 
 You gon do you 
 You gon do you 
 Imma do me 
 Imma do me 
 You gon do you 
 You gon do you 
 Imma do me

 I'm the most underrated rapper of all time 
 So why do you accept those that bite my rhymes 
 Me and eminem rhymed for d are e 
 Me and x was in da club bout to blast off heat 
 Quik told me to be all I can be 
 Nate is my dogg him and warren g 
 They recognize the ridah in the drivers seat 
 And even 50 cent said he'd ride with me 
 We sumthin like gangsta rap cousins 
 On my daughter imma die before I let you touch em 
 You know I like livin' 
 Enjoyin myself and I ain't bullshittin 
 You don't move me with fat mouth and lippin 
 And you don't want to see me out of retirement trippin' 
 I got a lot to live for 
 And id be damned if I change one bit 
 I like the way I am 
 You understand 
 Put your hands up come off them grams 
 I ain't trippin' that's the way I am (the way I am) 
 And if you see me with heat in my hand 
 Then you better duck that's the way I am (the way I am) 
 I can't believe ya got up in them pants 
 Sexy lady gon do that dance 
 Come on over when ya sick of ya man 
 And we can chill that's the way I am (the way I am) 
 I don't know that girl I just met her 
 Sippin on sour amoretta 
 She gon do her thing a five letter 
 But imma bounce cause her friend looks better 
 I like the way she knows me 
 I like the way she got herself in v I p 
 If she sees k n o see 
 She gon chill 
 And wait out front for me 
 Who do you know that rides for the coast 
 With a new breed and style of rap like me 
 I had the patience to study the game 
 Dr Dre made two chronics and this is chronic three 
 I make classic hits and buy classic cars 
 And see classic tits at classic bars 
 Knoc steps in the spot and the girls all pause 
 Magic stick ill break down walls 
 Got my heat as shit jumps off 
 Really you stepping to me is a lost cause 
 Party animal here since a quarter to ten 
 Baby phase 16 with an LA brim 
 I got shell toes on I don't wear them tims 
 Got niggas got hoes in the gaggle of gin 
 Ain't no telling what I might get in 
 The first night 
 Do it right 
 Imma do it again 
 C'mon 
 You know where we be 
 In da club 
 Come find me 
 I ain't trippin' 
 Air is free so what ever you want to do 
 For real though 
 Its just the way I am
