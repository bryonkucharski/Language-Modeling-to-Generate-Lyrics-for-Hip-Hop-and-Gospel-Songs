She pulls each string attached to vital organs with a crippling chuckle. 
 He shrieks until it's no longer worth mentioning. 
 There's a blizzard outside the dollhouse that permits man from simple rituals. 
 Inside it's not much different, 
 The hammer smacks his knees and he's forced to prey to the demon's insecurities. 
 On a pathological, uni-dimensional system of devilish symbols. 
 Which means it doesn't get more disgusting 
 Then a moaning desperate soul screaming please don't go until the life is gone. 
 I know the light are on and I used to light cigarettes with 'em. 
 Make a sacrifice humans are vices too, 
 Comfort is a lesser-civilized form of confirmity. 
 Let's dance to pincushions birth control pills shall be a prison cell. 
 All it wants is an engagement ring circle of fire another devilish ceremony. 
 She's wearing a black cloak to the wedding, 
 And he's wearing a glue on tie to match the body cast. 
 And every member of the family is lonely and happy, 
 And doesn't have anything to complain about, 
 But never shuts the fuck up till he's bathing in a puddle of urine; 
 The cast beautifully fitting. 
 Get well soon I wrote on the chest in the same shades we used to paint walls with 
 Till modern technology made the arms obsolete. 
 I imagine she's standing on a toadstool built from the same family tree of broken branches 
 But the lovely leaves keep them from falling below. 
 The fruits grew up rotten spoiled and spawning parasitic tendencies. 
 My friend, I fear the juices might kill you, 
 But I can't help you. 
 My make pretend crew, runs thicker then fake blood in horror movies. 
 Man and woman is killing babies. 
 Man and woman still beat each other. 
 Man and woman can barely rarely speak. 
 Man and woman is all we have and can't love.
