I'm not the priziest horse or the classiest fighter 
 With shattered glass in my voice 
 Writing my name on the wall with the fingers my highschool gave me; I'm still 
 Counting electric sheep at night, in love with an electric blanket 
 In fact I make love with electric outlets 
 In my sleep, it's all flying pigs and things that want me dead; 
 When I'm awake, it isn't much different. It's not them versus us 
 The battle wages over future addictions 
 Something's missing, and I can't quite focus on it 
 Oh, it must be the disappearing act we all put with our dreams 
 They'll never find me as long as I keep smudging off into the background 
 And continue to sink through the sidewalk with my head under a bench, to see 
 Who hears me, narrating their lives by the way they hold their money so tight 
 So they could send their kids off, but the best historians sleep on benches 
 (Why is everybody sleeping on benches?) 
 I've been a rock as long as I've lived 
 Since everything has to be a nobel prize winner 
 I should've quit when I saved the ozone 
 I should have known if I can't feel the ones I came with, it's a good time to rest 
 And hold fear at bay like some hold the margins they need to survive in 
 Barely alive, and you want me to lighten up? 
 Make an angel on the beach or pick a boquet in your garden 
 Call me when they drop redemption upon you like a piano 
 Record the noise it makes when it flattens your hands 
 Then you realize it was only a dream and you were tied to a tree the whole time 
 Watching friends drag by 'cause they can't look at the scars under your eyes 
 Burned to hell covered by locusts, they're trying to quote us 
 Now that they finally broke us into ridiculous names and meaningless titles 
 I won't forget, the little things escape 
 Through the pores in my skin so I can pour it on thick 
 And watch them scurry to escape the glass, leave the collection 
 And have a life of their own, well get rich you'll hate it too... 
 I promise... 
 In this life all I have, a falling sky in my arms 
 It's not that heavy, make pretend 
 It's someone else's party, what a gas 
 Shaking the hands that never trembles and always land on my feet 
 At this present elevation, I can't see past my feet 
 Between God's bald spots where the sky stops 
 I'm one of the Earth's latest gallstones 
 Despite all the America going on, it's all Rome 
 Go get unstuck, don't lose sleep till you can't find solace 
 In the fact that you can barely control yourself. Let alone 
 We're all tied down; since our wings got clipped, and lately can't sing enough 
 In the party that never ends, 'cause no one knows how to clean up the mess 
 What's up with all the gags? 
 Everyone around me has these holes drilled through 'em 
 And someone on the other side is trying to figure it out. Dying to be someone 
 Killing to be recognized as something that you're not 
 Well since we're all so into introductions, don't forget your names 
 Since you love yourself so much, keep it away from me 
 'Cause I've baked under artificial lights with artificial girls 
 And that sinking feeling there's someone sleeping inside my sleepless body 
 Quit playing kid games with your old tongue 
 Till you can find someone to buy future epiphanies from. Here's one: 
 I live in the city and leave everything alone, yesterday it was all TV 
 After all is said and done, we barely have memories 
 So I write what I feel, sue me if it's empty 
 Imagine that, I'm barely human, I'm barely human... 
 In this life all I have, a falling sky in my arms 
 It's not that heavy, make pretend 
 It's someone else's party, what a gas
