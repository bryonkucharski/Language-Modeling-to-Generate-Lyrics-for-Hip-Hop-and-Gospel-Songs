My phone rang, I converse with the busy signal 
 Why can't they let me die in pieces? 
 I don't want any more food or condolences, let my people go 
 Burn off this useless flesh and make meals of my pestilence 
 Lessons are my tournaquets 
 Maybe I've seen too much and not had enough 
 Either way, this is my last entry forever 
 Please don't let my children read this 
 I was meditating when I wrote this 
 The first time by interrupted by my screaming walls 
 Hard to concentrate in my 7 x 12 cell 
 Everyone watching my every move 
 Even with these shrouds, I feel naked 
 The windows talk to me and tell me that I ought to leave 
 Only one way out the door, it's too risky 
 Someone might not see me, be careful 
 We used to paint, the canvas made me feel alive 
 Oh how they marveled at the spectacle I made of myself 
 I made it for them, but it was really communication to conjure up through 
 Forever immortalized, carbon dioxide chokes me 
 And I fear no man but my shadow 
 There are a lot of things I've learned not to say outloud 
 If my parents were still alive, they'd still be proud 
 Sometimes I imagine myself as a loss 
 The leftover remains of a cast-away god 
 If I'm homeless, there's no Earth 
 Someday I'll be famous, and you can put that on my birth 
 My word is worth the demons that raped my being childhood, didn't happen 
 I was made as this, my walking prison 
 Guarded by my life on a limb, mood swings 
 Enjoying my whim, take it for what it seems and much more 
 Must find maker, how am I? and who did I? 
 And how did I wake up on this bench covered in mud? 
 Taking a shower won't aleve my stress 
 I can't even lift my brush to paint my long-awaited good-bye 
 Yet I'm feeling optimistic, relatively 
 This is my testimony and it tests the past miserably 
 Why do I keep dying in public places? 
 The medication should take two hours to take affect 
 But last time, I was killed eating my last meal 
 It's embarrassing and I die inside 
 This is my favorite rock 
 I come here to think about all the things that make me 
 This is my favorite poem 
 I wrote this before I died last time 
 These are my favorite friends 
 They don't talk much and probably aren't even listening 
 This is my favorite place 
 So I hope that I don't last here too long 
 The other night, I was doing my everyday things 
 Trying to find a girl to take to my apartment 
 She's beautiful and clearly cares for me 
 She likes my work, and wants to understand what fuels my art 
 We lay side-by-side 
 Happy knowing that there was only thirty minutes left of this to endure 
 She spoke typical things and gave of herself freely 
 I started freaking out as I convulsed during oral sex 
 Concerned for me, she held me 
 And I laugh at those tears, for a while 
 The next day, I was still dead and she had joined me 
 How honest I recall of how she gave of herself freely 
 As I drank my orange juice, I began to study all of her beauty 
 We danced and made love for hours 
 Talked about important things and how our children would grow up and die also 
 And how futile it was until we finally fell in love 
 I'll never be alone again and she will never leave me 
 I've forgotten why I write these things down 
 Even as I write this 
 I'm realizing how useless it is to put ideas to words 
 Water to wine, stupidity and valor 
 The streetlights I pray to and the gutters I fish in 
 My wife is no longer good at sex, her body doesn't speak to me 
 And I'm getting sick of her attitude 
 There's other fish in the sea 
 And I haven't stopped breathing for three days 
 I hope everything is all right 
 ___ 
 Today I downed 90 miligrams 
 After 20 I could feel the head rush 
 I raced to my gallery roof 
 Gazing at the beauty that we always take for granted 
 It's my opening night 
 Spinning 
 Everyone will be there 
 Whos anyone to bear witness to my newest latest and greatest work 
 I'm a comet human cannibal swan dive never has the air been so clean 
 I inhale and exhale to become one my ends on the sidewalk 
 A vivid display of a 170 pounds of blood sweat and tears 
 Critique away 
 But my greatest work is in the pavement 
 I made it for you 
 This is my favorite formance 
 And I hope nobody ever bites it 
 This is what I've been working up to all along 
 Finally alone at last 
 This is my favorite person and she will always be with me in spirit 
 These are my favorite words 
 I hope I don't have anything left to say
