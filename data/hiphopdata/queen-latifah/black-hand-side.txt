(Why y'all ain't say. yooo 
 You know you supposed to say something to me) 
 Oh baby baby, ah yeah, clap your hands y'all 
 Check it, dig it while I rip it 
 Check it while I wreck it 
 (Give it to'm La) 
 Ok gimme a few seconds 
 First I give a shout to every Jersery born and bread head 
 And everybody in new york from to brunettes to read heads 
 Who got my back? 
 (Jersey got yo back) 
 Yo tell me who's got my back? 
 (The Bronx got your back) 
 Yo tell me who's got my back? 
 (Brooklyn got your back) 
 Yo yo yo yo who's got my back 
 (Uptown got your back) 
 Thank you as I come back in to the beat 
 Give a shout out to my brother L.A.N.C.E 
 Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me 
 You know you're too good to be forgotten 
 Poppa wasn't here but there was Lance in the house 
 It's only me and mommy you the man of the house 
 Always flip the scipt back to the old days 
 I used to rock it on the high school stage 
 I used to drink 40s back then I didn't blaze 
 Twitched to the pipe with the peace these days 
 Just go on to let you know I flow on 
 I'm wicked out my gluteus so ho on and ho on 
 (Hooohoo) 
 That's what we about to do 
 (Hooohoo) 
 Take you on a mission with the Flavor U 
 Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop 
 I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop 
 But chill 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Just chill 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Yo chill 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Uh 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Come on chill 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Check it fear don't live in here 
 Tears don't bring me cheers 
 So gear for another year because I had it up to here 
 Yeah, I'm about through with you 
 You whack and bootie pooh with 
 Rip up the crew left and right hear the one and the two 
 I'm read-to-set-it-off again 
 Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin 
 In fact don't make me have to get the royal getcha 
 Best ta your narrow ass up off that crack 
 Booking any show when I know that I'll pack it 
 Attacking with my tactics 
 I'm loaded like a full metal jacket 
 I'll flip mines to get mines 
 I'm happy to get with you 
 But you can't come out to play 
 Right now you got to much shit to do 
 It's all game it all sounds the same 
 The suckas know my name is sitting on the tips of their brains 
 But they shame, they scared to face me 
 Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me 
 They must be freaking crazy 
 I'm the la la la from haulstead 
 Bread with the queen with a prefix 
 It's off with your head 
 And that's a promise 'cause I don't make threats 
 So mind your neck 'cause it's about to get set 
 C'mon set it off (2x) 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Uh, set it off 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Somebody set it off 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Watch somebody set it off 
 (Gimme five on the black hand side) 
 Ah 
 Check the queen set it off 
 Parley 
 Ah uh, yeah (3x) 
 Black reign 1993. 
 I'd like to welcome you to this album 
 Matter of fact I'd like to welcome you to a new day 
 A new day to hear me
