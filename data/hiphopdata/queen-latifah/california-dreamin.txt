All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey 
 I went for a walk on a winter day. 
 I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A. 
 California dreaming on such a winters day. 
 I stopped into a church (yes I did) 
 I passed along the way. 
 I got down on my knees (down on my knees) 
 And I pretended to pray. 
 You know the preachers he likes it cold, 
 So he knows I'm gonna stay (he knows I'm gonna stay). 
 California dreaming on such a winters day.(oh oh yeah)
