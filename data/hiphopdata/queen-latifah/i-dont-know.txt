Oh, I don't know 
 And it makes me scared 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 I'm taking this time to write you this letter 
 'Cause what we got is good but want to make it better, yo boo 
 I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment 
 Now I'm ready for a commitment 
 I'm not trying to rush things not looking for an engagement ring 
 But the queen needs a king 
 And I choose you, 'cause what we got is in tune 
 Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon 
 I want make this official man, I miss you 
 I feel for your touch and your kiss too 
 Listen I hope I'm not being to blunt 
 Don't wanna scare you away, it's a game I want to play but 
 Oh, I don't know 
 And it makes me scared 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (I don't know) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (So scared) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (Falling in love) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (Falling in love, hey) 
 I know you love it when I call you big poppa my thoughts are pure 
 I heard you left your last 'cause she was insecure 
 I'm not trying to compare myself but I got health and wealth 
 And now you dealing with the top shelf 
 My orgasmic thoughts need support 
 Thinking of positions you taught while I stare at the gifts you bought 
 The things you do for me make you my number one 
 When you're around I have a lot of fun check me now 
 Like the time we went to six flags boosting, tearing off tags 
 And sticking souvenirs into our bags 
 Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again 
 You're more than a lover you're my best friend 
 Do you remember the first time I letcha get it 
 I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it 
 You were the best I had that's why I want all of you 
 Now tell them hookers to stop calling you 
 I'm dead up I want to wear your name 
 So I pray and ask God to make you feel the same 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (Don't know) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (It makes me so scared) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (I'm falling in love again, again) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (Baby baby baby baby) 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (I don't know) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (I'm makes me scared) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (I'm falling in love again) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (Oh yeah) 
 Is there a place to ease my mind 
 (Place to ease my mind) 
 Think about you all the time, yeah 
 Show me a sign and wish that you would 
 Offer me a sign, relax my mind 
 Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate 
 Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make 
 I want more but I don't want push 
 It's never to late so be straight don't beat around the bush 
 I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine 
 Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it 
 But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer 
 With love sincerely yours your boo Dana 
 Oh P.S. guess who's back around 
 My ex he called me said he bought a house up town 
 But I told him that my love for you was too strong 
 Write back and don't make me wait to long 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (I don't know) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (Makes me so scared) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (I'm falling in love) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (I want to know, I wanna know) 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (I don't know) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (I'm so scared) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (I'm falling in love) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (Just me and my queen do you know what I mean) 
 Oh, I don't know 
 (Hey, hey) 
 And it makes me scared 
 (Hey, hey) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 (Falling in love) 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (Tell me if it's good enough for you) 
 Oh, I don't know 
 And it makes me scared 
 (I'm falling for you) 
 Because I'm falling in love 
 And I don't know if you feel the same 
 (I wanna know if you feel the same, yes I do)
