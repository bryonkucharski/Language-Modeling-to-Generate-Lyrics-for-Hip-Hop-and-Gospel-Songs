What you mean, wanna know how I feel about you, baby? 
 Be poetic about it, alright 
 I love the east, I love the west 
 And north and south, they're both the best 
 But I'll only go there as a guest 
 'Cause I love being here with you 
 I love the sea, I love the shore 
 I love the rocks but what is more? 
 With you they'd never be a bore 
 'Cause I love being here with you 
 Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour 
 Life is such a breezy game 
 Love all kinds of weather, as long we're together 
 I love to hear you say my name 
 I like good wine and fine cuisine 
 And candle light, I like the scene 
 But baby, if you know what I mean 
 'Cause I love being here with you 
 I love being here with you 
 I like a dance by Fred Astaire 
 And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair 
 But I think to tell you's only fair 
 That I love being here with you 
 And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day 
 His utter charm takes me away 
 But don't get me wrong, how do you say 
 I love being here with you 
 Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin' 
 'Cause there's something else, you know 
 They know how to say it, they know how to play it 
 They wind it up and let it go 
 I love the thrill of New York shows 
 I'd love to Durante's nose 
 But I'd like to say before I close, yeah, yeah 
 I just love, baby I love, well, I love being here with you
