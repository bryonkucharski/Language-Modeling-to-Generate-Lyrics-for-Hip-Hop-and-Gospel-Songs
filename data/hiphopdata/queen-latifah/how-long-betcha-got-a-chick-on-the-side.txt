 Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick 
 I know you got a chick on the side 
 I know you got a chick on the side 
 I know you got a chick on the side 
 I know you got a chick on the side 
 I know you want us both and I know the reason why. 
 I can give you so much lovin', 
 But presents, she can buy you. 
 Last night you're in my arms, 
 Tonight I'm all alone 
 How long will this game go on? How long? 
 Oh, oh how long? 
 Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick. 
 I know you got a chick on the side. 
 And its plain, plain enough to see that 
 You're not the man for me. 
 I can't keep playin' games that keep my heart in pain. 
 I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do 
 Than it is to say. 
 It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure. 
 I'll get over you, yes Ill find someone new. 
 Each time I open up my heart, 
 It seems to just get torn apart. 
 Adlib line 1: 
 I saw you, don't you try to hide. 
 Don't hide it from me, no, no. no. 
 Adlib line 2: 
 You thought you would hide it, hide it, 
 Hide it from me.
