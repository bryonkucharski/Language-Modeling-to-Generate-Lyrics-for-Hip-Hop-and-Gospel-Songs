I see Him when the children are at play 
 I hear Him when the church bells ring on wedding days 
 I feel Him when the breezes blow 
 Adore Him where the flowers grow 
 Revere Him when the oceans roll 
 He's everything 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He's everything 
 We're born, we live, we die and life goes on 
 We love, we laugh, we cry 
 And we're a part of His creation 
 Every person, every nation 
 He's in every situation 
 Everything 
 He's everything 
 Let's lift Him up 
 Through everything, He's loving us 
 Is it asking all that much 
 That we should do the same 
 So let us sing and raise our voice 
 Let us make a joyful noise 
 Let us praise His holy name 
 He's everything 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He's everything 
 In everything, He plays a part 
 In everything, He leaves His mark 
 Restores our lives, our broken hearts 
 The God of hope and change 
 So let us sing and raise our voice 
 Let us make a joyful noise 
 Rejoice and praise His name 
 Rejoice, sing it again 
 Rejoice, His joy remains 
 He's everything 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He's everything 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He's everything 
 He's everything 
 He's everything 
 Praise His name, His holy name 
 He's everything 
 He's always lovin' us 
 We should show a little love in everything, everything 
 He's the God of hope and change 
 He's the cure for hurt and pain 
 You know He loves us all the same 
 'Cause He's everything, He's everything 
 Everything He plays a part 
 Heals and mends our broken hearts 
 Restores us when we fall apart 
 'Cause He's everything, He's everything 
 So lift Him up, rejoice, rejoice 
 Let us sing and raise our voice 
 And let us make a joyful noise 
 He is everything
