 Go head wit that bullshit 
 Pop a can of fake shit 
 Never should've pulled it 
 Now you wanna stay quick 
 Shake it, break it 
 Never catch me naked 
 If them checks is basic 
 Slide with them paces 
 Big jeans, big keans 
 I only ride them big things 
 Pay me for my sixteens 
 Switch in my fitted jeans 
 Twistin' up that icky green 
 Book full of city dreams 
 Now everybody half way there swing 
 Let's swing baby 
 Let's swing baby 
 Let's swing baby 
 Go head wit that nonsense 
 Address me as your highness 
 I'm New Jersey's finest 
 Back from Bahamas 
 Aware of my content 
 Sista got sponsors 
 Dana got a conscience 
 Let me hit responses

 Don't get sloppy on me

 We just rulin' the night 
 With the family 
 Now you want some new shit 
 I keep it movin' who wit 
 My flavor unit 
 Bumpin' on exclusive 
 Jumpin' down in Houston 
 Peace to Whitney Houston 
 Tyin' up some nuisance 
 Ridin' wit a few friends 
 The science of the crew is 
 Neva give 'em units 
 We win the humor 
 Late let her move it 
 Everybody ruthless 
 Watch me make deuces 
 Thinkin' he the new shit 
 Time to gin and juice this 
 Story unconclusive

 Jumpin' jumpin' movin' 
 Somethin' bumpin' who wit

 Lot of cats included 
 Single droppin' June-ish

 Lady bubble bubble for my thug 
 Startin' that trouble 
 Little homies born in the struggle 
 I show you I love you 
 Get in a huddle 
 Peace to mommies workin' a double 
 Dana'll hug you 
 Piss me off I'll get 'em to mug you 
 I'm the same princess of the posse 
 Sippin confossey 
 If you can't sang 
 You can't copy what's gone stop me 
 In a black beat swizzey 
 And I'm pumpin' my posse 
 And plus I'm stocky 
 I dare on of y'all broads to try and stop me 
 La stays layin' the fire 
 Displayin' the wire 
 And I'm paid now 
 So twenty years just stainin' the tires 
 President buyer 
 Peasants can't grow with the sire 
 And whoever told you LA wouldn't drop is a liar 
 Go head
