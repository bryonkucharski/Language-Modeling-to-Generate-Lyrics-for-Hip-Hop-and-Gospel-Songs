(Talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me from 
 Heaven Watching my every move as usual... 
 There but for the grace of god do I go do I go 
 There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go 
 I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme 
 But it's bustin' from the seems 
 Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams 
 I'm moving all around 
 Oh yes, I'm making leaps an bounds 
 There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down 
 I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that 
 I've overflowed my cup. 
 I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up 
 Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand 
 There're things about all of y'all have got to understand 
 Latifah- never was a teacher 
 Never was a preacher 
 Never was a saint 
 Never was conceited 
 Never was defeated 
 Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint. 
 But I never shut up when things piss me off 
 And if I got to curse at you to get my point across 
 That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be 
 I've got an angel watching over me 
 (Chorus) 2 times 
 The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world 
 You don't hear me 
 Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world, world, world 
 The light of my world, my world- Ah yes he did...
