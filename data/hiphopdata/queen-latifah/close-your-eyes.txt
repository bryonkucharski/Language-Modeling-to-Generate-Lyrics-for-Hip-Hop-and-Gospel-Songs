Music play 
 Something dreamy for dancing 
 While we're here romancing 
 It's love's holiday 
 And Love will be our guide 
 Close your eyes 
 When you open them dear 
 I'll be right hear by your side 
 So... 
 Close your eyes 
 Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep 
 Close your eyes 
 And I will close mine 
 Close your eyes 
 Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep 
 Close your eyes 
 This is divine 
 Music play 
 Something dreamy for dancing 
 While were here romancing 
 It's love's holiday 
 And Love will be our guide 
 Close your eyes 
 When you open them dear 
 I'll be near by your side 
 So won't you close your eyes...
