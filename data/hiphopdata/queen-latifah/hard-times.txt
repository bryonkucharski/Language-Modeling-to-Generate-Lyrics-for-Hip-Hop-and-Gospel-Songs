Close your eyes 
 And rest your tired body next to mine 
 Nobody knows more than you 
 These hard times that we're living through 
 But Baby we'll go on and on 
 Hey) Lord knows, we've got each other 
 So kiss me, kiss me hard and long 
 Hard times, we can get over (Yeah) 
 Now the sun, (yeah) it must rise 
 And she's coming with a bag of tricks, 
 With treats and dirty lies 
 Nobody smiles, nobody cries 
 And no one seems to care if they live or die 
 But Baby we'll go on and on 
 Lord knows, Lord knows we have got each other (Yeah) 
 So come on and kiss me, kiss me hard and long 
 (Ooh) Hard times, we can get over 
 Ballots and boxes, bullets and guns 
 And the outlaw, the outlaw always runs and runs 
 (Yeah he does) 
 But Baby, just you come, come to me 
 Come to me, come to me, come to me, Baby 
 (When) Whenever you need me 
 So kiss me hard 
 Lay some kisses on me baby 'cause I need you and you know 
 That these hard times, we can get over
