(Guy) There I go, there I go, there I go 
 There I go... 
 Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control 
 Such a funny thing but every time you're near me 
 I never can behave 
 You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic 
 There's music all around me, crazy music 
 Music that keeps calling me so very close to you 
 Turns me your slave 
 Come and do with me any little thing you want to 
 Anything baby, just let me get next to you 
 Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes? 
 Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies 
 How I worry about you 
 Just can't live my life without you 
 Baby come here, don't have no fear 
 Oh, is there a wonder why 
 I'm really feeling in the mood for love? 
 So tell me why stop to think 
 About this weather, my dear? 
 This little dream might fade away 
 There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby 
 Won't you come and put our two hearts together? 
 That would make me strong and brave 
 Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 
 If there's a cloud up above us 
 Go on and let it rain 
 I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane 
 Oh my baby 
 Won't you please let me love you 
 And give a relief from this awful misery? 
 (Girl/ Backup Singer) What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet? 
 I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before 
 Can't you understand me? 
 Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon 
 My soul's on fire, come on and take me 
 I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet 
 (Guy) Oh baby, you make me feel so good 
 Let me take you by the hand 
 Come let us visit out there 
 In that new promised land 
 Maybe there we can find 
 A good place to use a loving state of mind 
 I'm so tired of being without 
 And never knowing what love's about... 
 James Moody, you can come on in man 
 And you can blow now if you want to 
 (Guy & Girl/ Guy & Backup Singer/ Both) We're through.
