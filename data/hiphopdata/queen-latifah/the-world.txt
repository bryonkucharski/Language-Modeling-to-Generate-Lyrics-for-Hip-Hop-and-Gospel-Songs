The world, oh, oh, oh, the world 
 The world, oh, oh, oh 
 I smoked pot of blunt again for the pain to go away 
 But it wouldn't go away, just subsided through the haze 
 Just drifted off into deeper thought 
 I broke my mind and searched my heart 
 Finally what was blindin' me was just as clear as day 
 I figured out what's stressin' me, depressin' me 
 Mummy that man molesting me, oh no 
 Was only 5 years old, I couldn't seem to tell a soul 
 I didn't know how to let you and daddy know 
 And I can't go on like this 
 That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists 
 But now that I realize this happened to me 
 I've gotta fight this 
 The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin' 
 Tryin' to move out is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]? 
 Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours 
 Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face 
 Help me with what happens in the world 
 Lesson number one the world ain't fair 
 It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out 
 So put your faith in it if you dare 
 The world 
 The world will put you right on top 
 Then snatch the bottom from under you 
 And just watch and laugh as you drop 
 The world 
 Lesson number one the world ain't fair

 Oh, the world will put you right on top

 And just watch and laugh as you drop 
 The world 
 Runnin' around the school as you tried committin' suicide 
 He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life? 
 It'd be the fact that he got a dad who uses him as a punchin' bag 
 Beats him till he's blue and black and won't stop will he makes him cry 
 You kept it to yourself and made excuses for the bruises 
 Took painkillers to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive 
 He was telling you, you were useless, never heard the words I love you 
 Made you feel like you were worthless, he's tryin' to save the trouble 
 And he can't go on like this 
 That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists 
 Somebody shoulda told you that you're priceless 
 Put your faith in God and we can fight this 
 The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin' 
 Tryin' to move out, is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]? 
 Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours 
 Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face 
 Help me with what happens in the world

 And just watch and laugh as you drop 
 The world 
 The world that we livin' in where we leave our babies 
 In the back seat of cars found my pass is blind 
 Desperate minds and emotional teenagers 
 Lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 Love's so precious, don't ever wanna test it 
 Who's your momma? Who your daddy? You can't even tell 
 Your'e shinin' on, chattin', see news at eleven 
 Were all walking through this place with vain visions of heaven 
 The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin' 
 Tryin' to move out, is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]? 
 Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours 
 Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face 
 Help me with what happens in the world 
 The world, the world 
 The world, the world 
 The world, the world
