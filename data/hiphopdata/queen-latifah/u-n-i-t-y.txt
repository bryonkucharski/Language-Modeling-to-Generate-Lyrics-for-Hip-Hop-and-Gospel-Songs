Uh, U-N-I-T-Y 
 U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity 
 U-N-I-T-Y, love a black man from infinity to infinity 
 (Who you calling a bitch) 
 U-N-I-T-Y (you gotta let him know) 
 U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity (come on, here we go)

 Instinct leads me to another flow 
 Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho 
 Trying to make a sister feel low 
 You know all of that gots to go 
 Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule 
 Now don't be getting mad when we playing, it's cool 
 But don't you be calling out my name 
 I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame 
 That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block 
 I had my cutoff shorts on, right, cause it was crazy hot 
 I walked past these dudes when they passed me 
 One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty 
 I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath 
 Then the little one said (yeah me, bitch) and laughed 
 Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly 
 Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said 
 "Who you calling a bitch" 
 (Here we go)

 I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up 
 Bad days at work give you an attitude, then you were rough 
 And take it out on me, but that's about enough 
 You put your hands on me again, I'll put your ass in handcuffs 
 I guess I fell so deep in love, I grew dependency 
 I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me 
 All that I knew was you was all the man I had 
 And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad 
 But I don't wanna see my kids see me getting beat down 
 By daddy smacking mommy all around 
 You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya 
 A man don't really love you if he hits ya 
 This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more 
 I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for 
 And nothing good gonna come to ya till you do right by me 
 Brother, you wait and see 
 (Who you calling a bitch)

 What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya 
 But like yo-yo, you don't hear me though 
 You wear a rag around your head 
 And you call yourself a gangsta bitch 
 Now that you saw Apache's video 
 I saw you wilding, acting like a fool 
 I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school 
 But where did all of this come from 
 A minute ago you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya 
 Now you a wannabe hard 
 You barely know your ABC's, please 
 There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it 
 Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (young lady) 
 (Uh) And real bad girls are the silent type (yeah) 
 Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced 
 Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right (fucking with nobody) 
 She got to wear that for life 
 (Who you calling a bitch)
