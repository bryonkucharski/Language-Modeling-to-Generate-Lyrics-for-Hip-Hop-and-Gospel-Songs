Yeah, well, well, owww 
 Yeah yeah... 
 Bring on that pecan pie 
 Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy 
 Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl 
 Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl 
 I offer big love with no apology 
 How can I deny the world the most of me 
 I am not afraid to throw my weight around 
 Pound by pound by pound 
 Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful 
 Face the fact, the simply irrefutable 
 No one wants a meal that only offers the least 
 When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast 
 Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese 
 Then take a look inside my book of recipes 
 Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light 
 We need a man who brings a man-size appetite 
 I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice 
 I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice 
 We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot 
 Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot 
 Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful 
 There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable 
 Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid 
 When Edna, you look like the whole parade 
 They say that white has might and thin is in 
 Well, that's just bull 
 'Cause ladies, big is back, and as for black 
 It's beautiful 
 All shapes and sizes, follow me 
 Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh yeah, prove it baby, prove
