I could show the world how to smile 
 I could be glad all of the while 
 I could change the gray skies to blue 
 If I had you 
 I could leave the old days behind 
 Leave all my pals, I'd never mind 
 I could start my life anew 
 If I had you 
 I could climb a snow-capped mountain 
 Sail the mighty ocean wide 
 I could cross the burning desert 
 If I had you by my side 
 I could be a queen, dear, uncrowned 
 Humble or poor, rich or renowned 
 There is nothin' I couldn't do 
 If I had you 
 I could show the world how to smile 
 I could be glad all of the while 
 I could change the gray skies to blue 
 If I had you 
 I could leave the old days behind 
 Leave all my pals, I'd never mind 
 I could start my life anew 
 If I had you 
 I could climb a snow-capped mountain 
 Sail the mighty ocean wide 
 I could cross the burnin' desert 
 If I had you by my side 
 I could be a king uncrowned 
 Humble or poor, rich or renowned 
 There is nothin' I couldn't do 
 If I had you 
 Baby, if I had you
