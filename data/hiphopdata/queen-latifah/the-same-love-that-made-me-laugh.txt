Come on now, I'm the one you love 
 I'm the one you can't breathe without remember 
 Why you wanna make me cry like this? 
 Why is you wanna make me cry? 
 Why me? 
 Your love is like a chunk of gold 
 Hard to gain, hard to hold 
 Like a rose that's soft to touch 
 Love has gone and it hurts so much 
 Well then why... 
 Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry? 
 Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain 
 Think about it being a great big rock 
 Won't you think before you started to roll it down 
 Because once you start it, you can't make it stop 
 I've given all I have to give 
 And if you don't want me, baby 
 I don't want to live 
 Well then why... 
 Oh, why 
 Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry? 
 Why you wanna make me cry? [5x] 
 Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow 
 I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow 
 Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry 
 You use to be so soft and sweet to me 
 And now you act so wrong and mean to me 
 Now you get so wrong and mean to me 
 Why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Oh, why you wanna mess my pillow 
 You got me cryin' like a weeping willow 
 Wanna make me cry 
 Oh, why, oh, why 
 Why why why why 
 Why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Why, oh, why, oh, why 
 Ooh, why
