There's a light in the darkness 
 Though the night is black as my skin 
 There's a light, burning bright, showing me the way 
 But I know where I've been 
 There's a cry in the distance 
 It's a voice that comes from deep within 
 There's a cry asking why, I pray the answer's up ahead, yeah 
 'Cause I know where I've been 
 There's a road we've been travelin' 
 Lost so many on the way 
 But the riches will be plenty 
 Worth the price, the price we had to pay 
 There's a dream in the future 
 There's a struggle that we have yet to win 
 And there's pride in my heart 
 'Cause I know where I'm going, yes I do 
 And I know where I've been, yeah 
 There's a road we must travel 
 There's a promise we must make 
 Oh, but the riches, the riches will be plenty 
 Worth the risks and the chances that we take 
 There's a dream, yeah, in the future 
 There's a struggle that we have yet to win 
 Use that pride in our hearts to lift us up to tomorrow 
 'Cause just to it still would be a sin 
 I know it, I know it, I know where I'm going 
 Lord knows I know where I've been 
 Oh, when we win, I'll give thanks to my God 
 'Cause I know where I've been
