Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me 
 Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me 
 Biting's against the law in the place that I live 
 So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib 
 The call me the high priestess of this hasta 
 Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta 
 There's never been a word I can't master 
 I've always been, a piddly pastor 
 I reign, the lesson of today 
 You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say 
 Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side 
 And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light
