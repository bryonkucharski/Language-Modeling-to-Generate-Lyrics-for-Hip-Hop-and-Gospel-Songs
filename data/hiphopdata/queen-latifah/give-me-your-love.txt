What this madness in my mind 
 Never really knew love before this time 
 Boy you'll take me where I've never been before 
 Now I what to explore more and more, just 
 Give me your love, give me your love 
 Give me your love, give me your love, 
 Give me your love, give me your love, 
 Give me your love, give me your love 
 I'm your woman, you're my man, 
 Doesn't matter if the world can't understand 
 I know if you stay right here by my side 
 I'll have no fear; I'll never run and hide just 
 Captivate my soul, hold me 
 When I'm down I need your love to console me 
 Some weakness tells me when the morning comes 
 It's hard for me to try to see you're not the one 
 For the love of you I just might just do most anything 
 It's the sensation the slightest touch can bring 
 Baby I adore you this is not a fling 
 With every breath I sing for you to 
 When I was a very small child 
 My mother told me 
 Hold on to the things that you love 
 And never let them go 
 Love is too precious to be wasted 
 And that is why I want you to know 
 What's this madness in my mind I really new love before this time 
 Boy you'll take me where I've never been before. 
 Now I want to explore more and more and more
