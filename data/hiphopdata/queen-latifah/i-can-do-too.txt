I ain't taking no shit 
 I'm the one you want to be with 
 Can't come home from the club 
 Gotta be in love 
 And that's where I'll be see 
 Think about what you need 
 But you never think about me 
 So we go through the? 
 Next thing you know 
 You're the first one to leave 'cause 
 I'm gonna be the one to win this fight (win this fight) 
 Say what you say 'cause I'm gonna be all right (all right) 
 Nothing in this world is gonna hold me down (hold me down) 
 Step to me and you will see (standing in the last round) 
 All that you do I can do too 
 I actually do it better 
 I got that something you want and 
 Believe me I'll try whatever 
 All that you do I can do too 
 I actually do it better 
 I got that something you want and 
 Believe me I'll try whatever 
 I ain't thinking 'bout you 
 'Cause I gotta think about me 
 And if you wear me down 
 Can't get up, got the best you see, so 
 Can't go out like that 
 It's like a monkey on my back 
 You can't stop this stress 
 I'm tired of your mess 
 End up like the rest 
 I'm gonna be the one to win this fight (win this fight) 
 Say what you say 'cause I'm gonna be all right (all right) 
 Nothing in this world is gonna hold me down (hold me down) 
 Step to me and you will see (standing in the last round) 
 (Queen Latifah) 
 I'm a try whatever I can think of wit you 
 You know, I've been down for you, but you 
 Consistently, fuck it 
 You treat me like a housewife 
 All maid and chef 
 Why you sit around here like you do heck 
 A woman? Nah you need a blowup doll 
 A chick like me, I was born to ball 
 I'm a chick with her own doe for the mall 
 I'm a chick with her own cell making calls 
 Drop off, black Benz when I'm loving hard 
 Get over your selfish ass on the beach in?
