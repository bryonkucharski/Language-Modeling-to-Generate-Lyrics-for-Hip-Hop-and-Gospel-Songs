I'm not in love 
 So don't forget it 
 Its just a silly phase I'm going through 
 And just because 
 I call you up 
 Don't get me wrong 
 Don't think you got it made 
 I'm not in love 
 No no no 
 Its because 
 I like to see you 
 But then again 
 That doesn't mean 
 You mean that much to me 
 So if I call you 
 Don't make a fuss 
 Don't go and tell your friends 
 About the two of us 
 I'm not in love 
 Oh no no 
 It's because 
 Oh oh oh 
 You wait a long time for me 
 Ooh ooh you wait a long time yeah 
 I keep your picture 
 Right there on the wall 
 It hides a nasty stain that's been lying there 
 So don't you ask me to give it back 
 I know you know it don't mean on thing to me 
 I ain't in love 
 No no no no 
 It's because 
 Oh oh oh 
 You wait a long time for me 
 Ooh ooh you wait a long time yeah 
 I'm not in love 
 No I'm not in love 
 No no no 
 I ain't in love 
 No no no no 
 It's because 
 Ooh 
 You wait a long time for me 
 Darlin' ooh 
 You wait a long time for me 
 I ain't in love, I ain't in love no no no 
 I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love 
 I ain't thinkin' 'bout you baby 
 I don't miss you like crazy 
 I ain't in love I ain't in love I ain't in love 
 Keep waiting, keep waiting.
