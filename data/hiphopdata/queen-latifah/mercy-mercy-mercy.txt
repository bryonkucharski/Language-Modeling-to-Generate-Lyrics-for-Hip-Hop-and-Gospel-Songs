My baby, she may not look 
 Like one of those bunnies out of the Playboy book 
 Well, I'm sorry bout that, Mr. Williams 
 But she's got something, 
 Johnny, much greater than gold 
 Well, now what's that? 
 I'm crazy 'bout that girl, 
 She's got so much soul 
 She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin' 
 Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow 
 And I know that she knocks me off my feet 
 Have mercy on me! 
 'Cause she knocks me off my feet 
 Can you dig it? 
 There is no girl in the whole world 
 That can love me like you do - ow! 
 Tell 'em 'bout it, Watson 
 My baby now, when she walks by 
 All the fellows go, and I know why 
 Have mercy, just look at her walk 
 It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine 
 And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind 
 Because she's got the kind of lovin', 
 Kissin' and a-huggin' 
 Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow 
 And I know that she knocks me off my feet 
 Have mercy on me! 
 'Cause she knocks me off my feet 
 I'd better tell 'em one more thing 
 There is no girl in the whole world 
 That can love me like you do 
 Ow, tell 'em 'bout it, Mr. Williams 
 Now everybody in my neighborhood 
 An' that's what's grooving me 
 Will testify that my girl, she looks so good 
 Well, let me tell you something else right here 
 She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind 
 Help 'em to make 'em see 
 And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind 
 Because she's got the kind of lovin', 
 Kissin' and a-huggin' 
 Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow 
 And I know that she knocks me off my feet 
 Have mercy on me! 
 'Cause she knocks me off my feet 
 Can you dig it? 
 There is no girl in the whole world 
 That can love me like you do 
 Mercy, mercy, mercy!
