I'm trav'lin' light 
 Because my man has gone 
 But from now on 
 I'm trav'lin' light 
 He said, "Goodbye" 
 And took my heart away 
 So from today 
 I'm trav'lin' light 
 No one to see 
 I'm free as the breeze 
 No one but me 
 And my memories 
 Some lucky night 
 He may come back again 
 But until then 
 I'm trav'lin' light 
 No one to see 
 I'm free as the breeze 
 No one but me 
 And my memories 
 Some lucky night 
 He may, he may come back again 
 But until then 
 I'm trav'lin' light
