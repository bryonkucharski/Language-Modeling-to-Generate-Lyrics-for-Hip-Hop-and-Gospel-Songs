Dove: 
 Hello 
 Meany meany meany meany (Say What?) 
 Meany meany meany meany (Say What?) 
 Meany meany meany meany mean 
 Meany meany meany meany (Say What?) 
 Meany meany meany meany (Say What?) 
 Meany meany meany meany mean (Okay) 
 Hello it's the soul 
 Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol 
 And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there 
 Who's holdin' my buddy 
 Hold up 
 (Wait a minute) 
 Pos: 
 Now just wait 
 We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate 
 But before we let the herd out the gate 
 Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle 
 (The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers) 
 Afrika: 
 De La Soul from the soul 
 Black medallions no gold 
 Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase 
 Buddy buddy buddy all in my face 
 Mike g: 
 For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap 
 Just in case the young girl likes to clap 
 Ain't for the wind but before I begin 
 I initiate the buddy with a slap 
 Q-tip: 
 Now for the next 
 I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest 
 And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess 
 For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best) 
 The best (Ooh Wee!) 
 Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch 
 (Stick 'em up, stick 'em up jimmy) 
 Next won't be needed unless 
 (Jenny want to get right to the flesh) 
 (Sweet little woman, sweet little woman) 
 Pos: 
 I won't lie, I love be -you-D-D-why (why) 
 'Cause I never let it walk on by 
 When it comes to me and Jenny I seem (very serious) 
 Like a big friend 
 Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip 
 When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift 
 Boy let me get shot I won't even riff 
 Afrika: 
 Buddy buddy don't you know you make me go nutty 
 I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy 
 Not too skinny and not too chubby 
 Soft like silly putty 
 Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me 
 'Cause I told you that it was your buddy 
 That was making me ever so horny 
 Junglelistically horny 
 Dove: 
 On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while 
 Plug Two is the 
 Q-tip: 
 Q to her tip 
 Dove: 
 On the A side and sometimes the flip 
 (Gotta gotta flip this record) 
 Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree 
 And the luuden to my do-re-mi 
 And the pleaser to my man Plug 3 
 (Plug 3 gets all the buddy) 
 Mike g: 
 Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push 
 And like a champ just knock it on out 
 Never ever once sellin' out 
 (Oh let loose the juice) 
 My buddy helps me to 
 (De La my Soul) 
 Keepin' jimmy in total control 
 Without Buddy I'd be on a roll 
 (La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la) 
 Q-tip: 
 Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times 
 If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find 
 A whole lot of fun lots of fun together 
 Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever) 
 Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close 
 If you be my buddy I will toast 
 That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy 
 You can be mines and I can be your buddy 
 Dove: 
 The best buddy's in evening wear 
 Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there) 
 I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D 
 I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg 
 And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed 
 Afrika: 
 Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle 
 Said don't worry 'cause I won't hurt you 
 All I really want to do is freak you (she freaked us) 
 Mike g: 
 And I watched and then I checked my swatch 
 To see the time 
 The Soul had formed a buddy line 
 And that buddy was (mine all mine) 
 Pos: 
 Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul 
 Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds 
 Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands 
 (Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere) 
 Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware 
 Yo fellas should we keep her aware 
 (Mmm Hmm, yeah!)
