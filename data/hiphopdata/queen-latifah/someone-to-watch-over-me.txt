There's a somebody I'm longing to see 
 I hope that she turns out to be 
 Someone who'll watch over me 
 I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood 
 I know I could always be good 
 To one who'll watch over me 
 Although I may not be the man 
 Some girls think of as handsome 
 But to her heart 
 I carry the key 
 Won't you tell her please to put on some speed 
 Follow my lead, oh how I need 
 Someone to watch over me 
 I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood 
 I know I could always be good 
 To one who'll watch over me 
 Although I may not be the man 
 Some girls think of as handsome 
 But to her heart 
 I carry the key 
 And this world would be like heaven, if she'd 
 Follow my lead, oh how I need 
 Someone to watch over me 
 Someone to watch over me
