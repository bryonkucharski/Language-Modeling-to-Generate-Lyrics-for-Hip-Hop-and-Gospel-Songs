[4x] The Queen is hyped up 
 *Talking* 
 Queen: Ayo Manda 
 Amanda: What's up La 
 Queen: Yo people have been trying to get fierce on me, I think it's time I tell them about themselves 
 Amanda: Yo just give it to them safari style 
 Well, well, well it's L.A 
 The T.I 
 The F.A.H 
 You'll see why 
 Q.U 
 Double E. 
 N 
 Is the reason I must be myself 
 What else? 
 Well fame hasn't got me 
 Souped up 
 Selling out 
 Sloppy or poppy 
 There so much live for 
 There for 
 Here's more from a woman 
 All woman 
 Keep the rumors 
 To Your 
 Self 
 The over blown 
 Home grown 
 Not known 
 Fools who never shown 
 Proof let alone own 
 A lot of props 
 Or hip hip pop chart 
 Notch on your clock is my spot 
 Now who got the marks? 
 I do 
 Why you little played out Achew 
 (Bless You) 
 I'm allergic to wack crews 
 The La 
 The Ti 
 The Fah 
 The Queen is up 
 Throwing salt that you never seen before 
 How dare 
 Those who talk 
 We can't have them 
 Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum 
 But a wise 
 Civilized 
 Growing higher 
 Judgements from the queen 
 Punish is the fire 
 I here to make these fools out of liars 
 You must learn step and respect the sire 
 Face the fire 
 Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear (fear) 
 The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear (ear) 
 Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge, and grace 
 I never run my piece damn I'll take it to your face 
 Open why you hoping 
 None stutter 
 Stop em 
 Maybe choke (choke) 
 Because it's very hard to breathe 
 While La got you in a yolk 
 I'll cut your throat 
 I'll cut it short 
 No one ever getting near 
 Latifah's had it up to here 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (Yeah Yeah Yeah) 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (I got it) 
 Last 4 th chorus: 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (Yeah Yeah Yeah) 
 Queen L.A.T.I.F.A.H in command 
 Some of these commercial entertainers 
 Are commercially a pain to mind and my behind 
 Try to dis Dana 
 Bumping me off 
 Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau 
 All I do is boo and say "is that so?" 
 Talk is cheap 
 And if talk got any cheaper (huh) 
 They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers 
 Kay sa rah sa rah 
 Blazay blah 
 Etcetera 
 This is a scene from the Queen La La 
 Lovely and lyrically loose 
 But lady like 
 I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type 
 Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got 
 When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots 
 Breaks 
 Breaks 
 Face 
 Face 
 Never 
 Never 
 Waste 
 Waste 
 Your mind on a rhyme 
 That will get thrown in your fronting face 
 I'll cut your throat 
 I'll cut it short 
 No one ever getting near 
 Latifah's had it up to here 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (Who got it) 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (Latifah) 
 Last 4 th chorus: 
 Give it to 'em Queen 
 (Who got it) 
 Queen L.A.T.I.F.A.H in command 
 Royal and loyal 
 Face the fire 
 Boy 
 You wouldn't get the time of the day 
 So make way 
 Hey 
 Silence I say 
 Lay low and have a cold one 
 Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one 
 I through some soul into my morning bowl 
 Then I rolled 
 I took your gold and stopped your singled 
 Cause it ever never sold 
 Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout 
 So you could never give me body or come in my house 
 The Flavor Unit is doing back again this year 
 How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear 
 Feel the force of my holocaust 
 I'm staring at ya 
 Put in a bid on who will fall 
 I'm sure to match ya 
 Snatch ya 
 Stature 
 Your broken looks more like a fracture 
 Catch that rapper 
 Latifah will be back to crush ya 
 Go buy a heart 
 Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near 
 Latifah's had it up to here
