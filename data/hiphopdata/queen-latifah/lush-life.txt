I used to visit all the very gay places 
 Those come what may places 
 Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life 
 To get the feel of life... 
 From jazz and cocktails. 
 The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces 
 With distant gay traces 
 That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away 
 By too many through the day... 
 Twelve o'clock tales. 
 Then you came along with your siren of song 
 To tempt me to madness! 
 I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness 
 Of a great love for me. 
 Ah yes! I was wrong... 
 Again, 
 I was wrong. 
 Life is lonely again, 
 And only last year everything seemed so sure. 
 Now life is awful again, 
 A troughful of hearts could only be a bore. 
 A week in paris will ease the bite of it, 
 All I care is to smile in spite of it. 
 I'll forget you, I will 
 While yet you are still burning inside my brain. 
 Romance is mush, 
 Stifling those who strive. 
 I'll live a lush life in some small dive... 
 And there I'll be, while I rot 
 With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too...
