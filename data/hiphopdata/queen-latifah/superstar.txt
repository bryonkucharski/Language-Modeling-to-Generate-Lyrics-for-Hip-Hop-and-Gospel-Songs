You ain't gotta be no superstar 
 I only want to find out who you are 
 And we gotta be no Superman 
 So if you wanna talk to me, you can 
 My girlies caught me on a good day 
 I was (something) to move a job 
 So we took it to a club 
 Nigga we would make out a little 
 And plus at the time I was single, a little 
 So I said "Fine, we could meet up about nine" 
 So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing 
 We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin' 
 Some people in the joint is yellin' "Hurt me, Hurt me" 
 I'm working my way over to the bar 'cause I'm thirsty 
 And then I see this guy 
 Oh no, I think he sikes me 
 I smile 'cause he's fly 
 He smiles back, I think he likes me 
 Well then it takes a twist 
 He sends his homeboy to talk to me 'cause he's scared to get dissed 
 I don't walk baby 
 I don't bite neither 
 You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper 
 The worst thing I'da said was "No" 
 So maybe next time you better push a (something) 
 Saturday moving in the house 
 Lookin' at the videos 
 At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes 
 First date (First Date) with the guy's name was Nate 
 Was he fly? 
 Yes he was 
 Word up, the type you have on a plate 
 'Cause I only met him last night 
 So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right 
 So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo 
 What is on his (something), are we expecting more? 
 He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand 
 Now what was in your plan? 
 I really didn't understand 
 We're only going to the movies 
 Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony 
 Listen baby, I don't want a condo 
 You can make me smile a little and give me convo 
 All I might require from my man is intelligence 
 And all them other material things is irrelevant 
 (Chorus twice) 
 Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen 
 And you know how to treat a queen 
 Then step to the scene 
 We can sit alone in a room and deal 
 We can take a ride listening to music and chill 
 And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do 
 And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you 
 'Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey 
 All I wanna find out is exactly who you are 
 Money ain't gone make me love ya 
 And even with your car 
 So cease with that attitude 
 With that attitude you won't be getting far 
 And I love all of my brothers with a passion 
 Can't a sister get the same type of reaction 
 (Yeah) If you cool like dat 
 Take a trip to Jersey 'cause that's where I'm at
