 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 Feeling lovely-ay 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I hear the [gunshot], but I'm here to stay 
 Well, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood 
 A beautiful day in the neighbor hood 
 Can't go wrong, I feel strong, and the flavor's good 
 I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray 
 Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today 
 I strap out, step out in every direction 
 Glock, Tech, jimmy hats in case I need protection 
 So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wannabe's 
 A kid in the M3's getting jack right in front of me 
 So I pull the Tech close, my finger's on the trigger 
 Don't wanna get wet, so they step cause mines is slightly bigger 
 But better yet, I'm a threat, so you better walk 
 Or get sketched out in chalk 'cause I don't wanna talk 
 I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too 
 I got the fever for the flava of a Woo Woo 
 So it's back to the block, time to play 
 It's just another day around the way, hey 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 Feeling lovely-ay 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I hear the [gunshot], but I'm here to stay 
 Time to chill, hit the hill uptown let's peep the sights 
 Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight 
 I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy (easy) 
 Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a D.T. 
 But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest 
 Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next 
 Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie 
 Get a Final Call from the brother in the bowtie 
 I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun 
 Lots of laughter, moms, no pops playing with her son 
 I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven 
 Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven 
 Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game 
 You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain 
 So it's back to the block, time to play 
 It's just another day around the way, hey 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 Feeling lovely-ay 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I hear the [gunshot], but I'm here to stay 
 You know I gotta give props, I can't stop 
 Without y'all, I'll be nothin' 
 No rec'ing, no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin' 
 No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers 
 No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah 
 I come with the real life perspective and rule 
 Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool 
 So it's back to the block, time to play 
 It's just another day (around the way) 
 Around the muthafucking way 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I'm feeling lovely-ay 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I hear the [gunshot], but I'm here to stay 
 Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feeling good today 
 I hear the [gunshot], but I'm here to stay 
 'Cause it's just another day in the neighborhood 
 Just another day around the way 
 I'm feeling good today 
 I'm feeling lovely-ay 
 Feeling good today 
 Feeling good today 
 You know my hood's okay 
 It's gonna be okay
