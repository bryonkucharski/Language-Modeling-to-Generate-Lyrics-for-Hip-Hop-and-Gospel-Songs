Don't cry, don't cry, baby 
 Don't cry, baby 
 Dry your eyes 
 And let's be sweethearts again 
 Oh, 'cause you know 
 You know I didn't mean 
 To ever treat you so mean 
 Come on, come on sweetheart 
 Let's try it over again 
 And oh, don't cry, don't cry, baby 
 Don't cry, don't cry 
 Dry your eyes 
 And let's be sweethearts again 
 And oh, 'cause you know 
 You know I didn't mean 
 To ever treat you so mean 
 Come on, come on sweetheart 
 And let's try it over again 
 Oh, don't cry, don't cry, baby 
 Oh, don't cry, baby, don't cry 
 Dry your eyes 
 And let's be sweethearts again 
 Oh, don't cry, don't cry 
 Don't cry, don't cry 
 I'm so sorry, baby 
 Don't cry 
 And don't cry 
 I got you right here 
 I wanna keep you near 
 Forever my dear, baby, baby
