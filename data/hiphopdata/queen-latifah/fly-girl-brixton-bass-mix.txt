Well it's almost nightfall 
 And there's no forecast of rainfall 
 And I'm in the mood for a party 
 So I'm gonna go out to a club 
 And give the dancefloor body 
 So I jump in the car and go to the venue 
 Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu 
 Guys in the house they're wacthing me 
 They're clocking me there's no stopping me 
 (Desire) I know you want me 
 (You're fine) thank you 
 But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am 
 I don't jump into the arms of every man 
 (But I'm paid) I don't need your money 
 (I love you) you must be mad 
 Easy lover is something that I ain't 
 Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint 
 Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys 
 I always hear, yo, baby? 
 I mean like what's the big idea? 
 I'm a queen, nuff respect 
 Treat me like a lady 
 And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby 
 I'm looking for a guy who's sincere 
 One with class and savoir faire 
 I'm looking for someone who has to be 
 Perfect for the queen latifah me 
 (Fly girl, fly girl) 
 (Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine) 
 (And I want you to be mine) 
 (Fly girl, fly girl) 
 (Have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
 (Won't you let me be your man?) 
 All my friends are in relationships 
 Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones 
 Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better 
 And some of the good ones ended up sad ones 
 You see? loving, it ain't hard to get 
 I want a friend not just a lover 
 Someone who is dedicated only to me 
 Not to me and two or three others 
 One who will not lie to me or think 
 He can get my love by buying me 
 I know I'll find him some day 
 And when I find him 
 He sure won't say 
 (Repeat refrain) 
 (Fly girl, fly girl 
 (Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine) 
 (And I want you to be mine) 
 (Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear) 
 (Have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
 (Won't you let me be your man?) 
 Lounging, sitting in the house 
 And I'm cooling, first day of the week 
 So there's nothing to do 
 And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss 
 Momma never said there'll be days like this 
 So I called her and we talked for a while 
 Hang up the phone feeling better 
 With a smile 
 It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year 
 And this time I know I'm gonna hear 
 (Fly girl, fly girl, come here) 
 (Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine) 
 (And I want you to be mine) 
 (Fly girl, fly girl) 
 (Have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
 (Won't you let me be your man?) 
 (Repeat refrain) 
 Fly girl (15x)
