(Mann Curtis, Al Hoffman, Walter Kent) 
 I'm gonna live till I die! I'm gonna laugh 'stead of cry, 
 I'm gonna take the town and turn it upside down, 
 I'm gonna live, live, live until I die. 
 They're gonna say "What a guy!" I'm gonna play for the sky. 
 Ain't gonna miss a thing, I'm gonna have my fling, 
 I'm gonna live, live, live until I die. 
 The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low, 
 They'll never trail over my head. 
 I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then. 
 Hallelujah, gonna dance, gonna fly, I'll take a chance riding high, 
 Before my number's up, I'm gonna fill my cup, 
 I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die! 
 The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low, 
 They'll never trail over my head. 
 I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then. 
 Hallelujah, gonna dance, gonna fly, I'll take a chance riding high, 
 Before my number's up, I'm gonna fill my cup.
