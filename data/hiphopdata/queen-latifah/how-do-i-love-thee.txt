How do I love thee 
 Let me count the ways 
 How much do I love you 
 Well, multiply your love by infiniti 
 Picture a vision of beauty 
 As we dance by the light of the moon 
 Your passion so often consumes me 
 Like the lick of a native tongue tune 
 Reality is ours to create 
 Fantasy is ours to mold 
 Dream my love dream 
 With my body and my soul 
 Question out my faith 
 I'm pledged to be your lover 
 And after I started loving you 
 I knew I'd never love another 
 I'm like a child within your arms 
 Would you come inside and play with me 
 Spend the day with me 
 Have your way with me. 
 Remember this always 
 My sweet one 
 No lie is true 
 And dude it's not a lie 
 When I say that 
 I would die for you 
 You're so deep within thee 
 That sometimes your just a touch away 
 But I can't reach you 
 I seek you 
 Come to me 
 But then you"re all around me 
 You just surround me 
 And you astound me 
 And I receive you 
 'Fore I complete you 
 It pleases me 
 To have you touch me there 
 I think you know it gets to me 
 Stop 
 Don't stop 
 Ecstacy 
 So sweet 
 I adore you 
 Come to me 
 That's right 
 Come to me 
 How do I love thee 
 Let me count the ways 
 How do I love thee 
 Let me count the ways 
 Reality is ours to create 
 Fantasy is ours to mold 
 Dream my love dream 
 With my body and my soul 
 Question out my faith 
 I'm pledged to be your lover 
 And after I started loving you 
 I knew I'd never love another 
 I'm like a child within your arms 
 Would you come inside and play with me 
 Spend the day with me 
 Have your way with me. 
 Please don't go 
 Happiness is nothing without you 
 Stay. 
 My sweet one 
 I adore you 
 Hold me 
 Come to me 
 Love me 
 Love me
