Know, know what I mean? 
 Fast car, fast car 
 I wanna meet your fast car 
 Take me on a comet ride 
 Shoot me past the fast car 
 I wish I owned that last car 
 You could be the end to 
 Everything my heart's asking for 
 Take me away 
 (So, so, far away) 
 I don't wanna feel no sorrow 
 Take me away 
 (So, so, far away) 
 I might not see tomorrow 
 Hey, hey 
 You tell me you can cure my addiction 
 (Addiction) 
 And you tear my feet off the ground 
 Everytime I would forget my affliction 
 (Affliction) 
 But I don't want to come down 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million tears and frowns 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million years on the ground 
 Take me up in your rocket ship 
 Take me so, so far away 
 (Away) 
 Let me forget all the good shit 
 Take me so, so far away 
 (Away) 
 I need a face that's not mine that fits me 
 Just get me to forget misery 
 Yes indeed, we just be 
 In misery, yes indeed 
 We just be up high 
 When I'm with you 
 When I'm with you 
 You tell me you can cure my addiction 
 (Addiction) 
 And you tear my feet off the ground 
 Everytime I would forget my affliction 
 (Affliction) 
 But I don't want to come down 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million tears and frowns 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million years on the ground 
 You remind me of my Mercedez Benz 
 For you I spend all my years 
 You might wanna meet my friends 
 And I might wanna have your kids 
 I name 'em Shaniqua, Bonita, Rashawn 
 And baby, you can take me far away 
 See the moon and the stars 
 Now can't nobody do it like you do 
 (What?) 
 I admit you got to go 
 (What?) 
 Me and you, just us two 
 Spread my love like a swine flu 
 Ay, you got me high 
 Wanna touch the sky 
 You know you love me right? 
 Let's sing this lullaby 
 Yeah, you could be my fast car 
 Maybe be my Jaguar 
 Baby, what you isn't are 
 Make me see the moon and stars 
 I wanna touch the moon 
 Get some of this poom, poom 
 Ride it like zoom, zoom 
 Make him drop this fruit of the loom 
 He want my peach fair Victoria underwear 
 I love 'em, oh so swell 
 And yep, he love my fruit cocktail 
 I keep it real, baby 
 I love 'em crazy, baby 
 I'm a name brand bitch 
 She just don't need it, baby 
 You better stay with me 
 Sexy is what I need 
 I'm a F-A-S-T C-A-R M- ISS -E 
 You tell me you can cure my addiction 
 (Addiction) 
 And you tear my feet off the ground 
 Everytime I would forget my affliction 
 (Affliction) 
 But I don't want to come down 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million tears and frowns 
 It's just the high that your givin' me 
 (Givin' me) 
 Is worth a million years on the ground 
 High that you're givin' me 
 High that you're givin' me 
 High that you're givin' me 
 High that you're givin' me 
 High that you're givin' me
