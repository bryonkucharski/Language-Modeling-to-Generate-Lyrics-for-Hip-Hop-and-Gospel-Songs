It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you 
 I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying? 
 This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC 
 But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!) 
 This MC stands for "Microphone Commando" 
 When I command that you take a hand 
 And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now 
 Chill, and watch me rap 'cause I'm flowing (Flowing) 
 Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter) 
 A battle, put me in it, I win it 
 The mission is music and rhythm 
 Rhythm backed by words, all in my system 
 System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in 
 Heart into the music, music I take part in 
 One try, one God, and one destiny 
 Just dance for me
