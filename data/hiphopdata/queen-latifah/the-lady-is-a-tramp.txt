I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew 
 And never wished for turkey 
 As I hitched and hiked and grifted too 
 From Maine to Albuquerque 
 Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball 
 And what is twice as sad 
 I was never at a party 
 Where they honored Noel Ca'ad 
 But social circles spin too fast for me 
 My 'Hobohemia' is the place to be 
 I get too hungry for dinner at eight 
 I like the theater but never come late 
 I never bother with people I hate 
 That's why the lady is a tramp 
 I don't like crap games with barons and earls 
 Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls 
 Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls 
 That's why the lady is a tramp 
 I like the free, fresh wind in my hair 
 Life without care, I'm broke, it's o'k 
 Hate California, it's cold and it's damp 
 That's why the lady is a tramp 
 I go to Coney, the beach is divine 
 I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine 
 I follow Winchell and read every line 
 That's why the lady is a tramp 
 I like a prizefight that isn't a fake 
 I love the rowing on Central Park lake 
 I go to Opera and stay wide awake 
 That's why the lady is a tramp 
 I like the green grass under my shoes 
 What can I lose? I'm flat, that's that 
 I'm all alone when I lower my lamp 
 That's why the lady, that's why the lady 
 That's why the lady is a tramp
