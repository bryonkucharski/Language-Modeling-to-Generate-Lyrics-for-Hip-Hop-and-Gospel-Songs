Hey old friend let's look back on the crazy clothes we wore 
 Ain't it fun to look back and to see it's all been done before? 
 All those nights together are a special memory 
 And I can't wait for tomorrow, just as long as you're dancing next to me 
 'Cause it's so clear, every year, we get stronger 
 What's gone is gone, the past is the past 
 Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause 
 I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go 
 I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go 
 So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow 
 I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Hey old friend together, side-by-side and year-by-year 
 The road was filled with twists and turns, oh, but that's the road that got us here 
 Let's move past the bad times, but before those memories fade 
 Let's forgive but not forget and learn from the mistakes we made 
 'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger 
 So don't give up and don't say when 
 And just get back on the road again 'cause 
 I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go 
 I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go 
 So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow 
 I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Hey old friend come along for the ride 
 There's plenty of room, so jump inside 
 The highway's rocky every now and then 
 But it's so much better than where I've been 
 Just keep movin' at your own speed 
 Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need 
 Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on 
 'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone 
 We got so far to go! 
 Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger 
 So shine that light, take my hand 
 Let's dance into the promise land 'cause 
 I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go 
 I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go 
 So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow 
 I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 But baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go 
 Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go...
