Georgia Rose, Georgia Rose, 
 You're the most precious rose, Dixie Rose. 
 Though we don't see quite right, 'cause you're skin's dark as night. 
 I know you are hid'n from the light. 
 To the good Lord above, we all look the same, so don't, hang your head in shame. 
 Georgia Rose, Georgia Rose, don't be blue, 'cause you're black, Georgia Rose. 
 Georgia Rose, Georgia Rose, don't be blue...'cause you're black, Georgia Rose...
