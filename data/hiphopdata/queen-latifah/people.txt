People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 Listen, money crimes and mood swings 
 Situations where certain people will do things 
 Like hop on bandwagon, get on the food chain 
 Soon as you get yo swag that's when yo crew change 
 But we all equal and people are just people 
 Leave it in God's hands 'cause the devil is lethal 
 You get what you earn also you live and you learn 
 To expect nothing in return 
 Do what you do from the heart then move on 
 'Cause in the eyes of the ungrateful, you can do wrong 
 That's when the negative energy gets too strong 
 The sunshine leaves, in comes the true storm 
 Sometimes make you wanna do harm 
 But you fall back 'cause you too calm 
 To get all rowdy and evil 'cause you realize 
 At the end of the day they just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 The bad ones discourage, the good ones motivate 
 The weak shall perish, the haters going show they hate 
 As long as you know what you dealing with, you can close the gate 
 Never let them in yo world till you know they straight 
 'Cause then again they just people 
 Life's just a one stop deal, there's no sequel 
 Fake ones are so transparent and so see through 
 Love ones can be so humble when they need you 
 Some got they hands out even after you feed 'em 
 But they ain't never around when you need 'em 
 That's when yo thoughts get evil 
 But then you realize they just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 Ayo, I got a lot more living to do before I leave here 
 'Cause I'm blessed and I'm thankful and I'm happy to be here 
 In good health with good wealth, you could always use help 
 But all you really got is yo good self 
 Still what I go through, it hurts when people that know you 
 Let you down and don't hold you 
 But yo mistakes will teach you 
 'Cause then you realize they just people 
 Oh people, oh people, oh, oh 
 Oh people, oh people, oh, oh 
 Don't you worry about a thing they just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people 
 People gonna let you down 
 Don't expect for them to be around 
 They're just people
