Well good morning baby welcome back to town 
 How'd, fine papa, welcome back to town 
 You're doing so much travelling never know 
 When you'll be around 
 You're a fine and mellow fellow 
 But you're stubborn as a mule 
 You love me like an angel 
 But you treat me like a fool 
 Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross 
 You'll see any time I'm ready 
 I can tell you baby get lost 
 Doing anything you choose 
 You're cheating on the outside 
 You better come back on the inside 
 Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss 
 'Cause you got too much to lose 
 And if you can't play it my way 
 Well now baby get lost 
 I try to stop your cheating 
 But I just don't have the time 
 'Cause I got so many men that 
 Keep cool papa, you got to corne across 
 They're standing right in line 
 'Cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready 
 You know when I'm ready 
 I can tell you baby get lost 
 Why don't you get lost
