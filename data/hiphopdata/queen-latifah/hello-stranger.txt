(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby) 
 (Shoo-bop, shoo-bop) 
 Hello, stranger 
 (Ooh) It seems so good to see you back again 
 How long has it been? 
 (Ooh, seems like a mighty long time) 
 (Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh) 
 It seems like a mighty long time 
 Oh-uh-oh, I my, my, my, m 
 I'm so glad 
 You stopped by to say "hello" to me 
 Remember that's the way it used to be 
 Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time 
 (Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh) 
 It seems like a mighty long time
