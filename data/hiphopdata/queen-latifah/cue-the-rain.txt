You know it's over but you don't wanna say 
 You see the writin' on the wall but you don't wanna read 
 And now you're hopin' that there'll be somethin' different 
 Somethin' to change the circumstances of the way you're livin' 
 But that's that fantasy, that's that reality 
 The one you love that keeps on changin' personalities 
 It's always jealousy, too much intensity 
 I don't remember signin' over my I, identity 
 'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light 
 On this site, somebody cue the rain 
 Cue the rain, cue the rain 
 Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain 
 Didn't know you'd be so greedy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 Now you met me on the fly, I was flyin' so high 
 You said I can fly too, that's the start of me and you 
 Chemistry, what a blast, had us movin' so fast 
 Ooh baby, what a ride when your love is the map 
 Let's go 
 Love the way I move in, the crowd still a jewel 
 I rule it all with these 'cause I got that joie de vive 
 But like Tinker bell in the story of Pan 
 I got caught up and Captain Hook is my man 
 But I want free love 
 'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light 
 On this site, somebody cue the rain 
 Cue the rain, cue the rain 
 Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain 
 Didn't know you'd be so greedy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 If you don't love me now, you will never love me again 
 I can still hear you say you will never, never break 
 Never break the chains 
 'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light 
 On this site, somebody cue the rain 
 Cue the rain, cue the rain 
 Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain 
 Didn't know you'd be so greedy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 When it comes close your eyes, I'm takin' over your body 
 Close your eyes, close your eyes 
 When it comes I know 'cause I, I release myself 
 [Incomprehensible] inside, close your eyes 
 'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains 
 Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light 
 On this site, somebody cue the rain 
 Cue the rain, cue the rain 
 Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain 
 Didn't know you'd be so greedy 
 Baby, you got my heart in chains
