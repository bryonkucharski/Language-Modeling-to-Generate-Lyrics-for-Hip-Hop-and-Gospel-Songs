 Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew 
 That you've been trying to infiltrate my crew 
 It ain't no hiding from the Flava U 
 Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable 
 (Go 'head and do it) 
 Now I've been trying to keep my cool like a queen 
 (Ooh, cool like a queen) 
 Bout to bring the Newark girl out of me 
 (Ooh, Newark outta me) 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake lives 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives 
 All around me 
 (Haters try to play La, but 
 They know that they can't take her paper) 
 Everybody talking see 
 Spreading them lies about my friends and me 
 They say that we're tighter than friends supposed to get 
 That's because I haven't let you chill with me yet 
 You make it hard for a girl to roll 
 (Ooh, girl to roll) 
 But make it easy so my pockets stay swole 
 (Ooh, pockets stay swole) 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake lives 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives 
 All around me

 That's right, yeah 
 Check it, check it, what 
 Check it, check it 
 Come on, come on 
 Yo, yo 
 Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at? 
 Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at? 
 As I look back on my life (check it) 
 To get where I am, I had to sacrifice 
 You slander my name in your magazine 
 This business gets hard trying to stay the queen 
 You're checking for me, you need to check yourself 
 (Ooh, check yourself) 
 And be someone, not someone else 
 (Ooh, someone else) 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake lives 
 Don't you know I heard you trying to take my... 
 While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives 
 All around me
