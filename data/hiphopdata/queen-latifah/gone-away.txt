I try to reason and tell myself you'll return 
 But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone 
 You were mine for only a minute 
 And if I hurt you I didn't intend it 
 You are gone away, I keeptellin' my mind 
 You're not gonna stay 
 But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby 
 I lost you, baby, you were gone 
 Forgive and forget it that's not what I'll ask you to do 
 'Cause I want you back, yeah 
 You know, you know I want you back 
 And in concluding my mental discussion 
 I found I lost my prized possession 
 You are gone away, I keeptellin' my mind 
 You're not gonna stay 
 And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby 
 I lost you, baby, you were gone 
 You were mine for only a minute 
 And if I hurt you I didn't intend it 
 You are gone away, I keeptellin' my mind 
 You're not gonna stay 
 And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby 
 I lost you, baby and you were gone 
 Lie, lies I told you baby 
 I never meant to say
