Well by now you know I'm insatiable 
 "'Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah 
 It's a miracle, you were right inside my head 
 If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice? 
 It is not against the law, no baby 
 I slave all through the week 
 And I need my release 
 I work hard so when I stop 
 I gotta get a little satisfaction for me 
 Hit it again 
 Don't care if I'm late 
 The world just has to wait 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
 Hit it again 
 I loved it the first time 
 Sent chills up through my spine 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
 Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it 
 And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it 
 I hope you understand 
 But I can't worry if you don't, oh no 
 If I can't double up 
 It's like I didn't get enough 
 Call me greedy if you want, just do it 
 But it's something that will never change 
 I don't get no complaints 
 They know it when they ring my bell 
 That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well 
 Hit it again 
 Don't care if I'm late 
 The world just has to wait 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
 Hit it again 
 I loved it the first time 
 Sent chills up through my spine 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
 I declare the point to be 
 Once is not enough for me 
 Two time lovin' makes me smile 
 One time love just ain't my style 
 Repeat the love and I have found 
 More the second time around 
 It builds me up I love to love 
 And if I can't hit it again 
 It ain't natural 
 Hit it again 
 Don't care if I'm late 
 The world just has to wait 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
 Hit it again 
 I loved it the first time 
 Sent chills up through my spine 
 Hit it again, hit it again, baby
