I go to sleep and see a ki' 
 Tucked inside a duffle Tryna be up outta reach 
 It's like it came to life and it was sweet enough to speak 
 Told me call a couple friends of yours and lead me to the street right?, peep it 
 I go to sleep and see a key, opening a Rover 
 Same way they used to show us 
 Told 'em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep 
 Said it's better when it's quiet baby slip that underneath 
 So to tuck away the convo, conversing in morse code 
 Seem like everything it should be, till they're beyond those 
 Putting everything on your leap unless the alarm broke 
 A ki' might lead to a key to where Nia Long go 
 Visionary riches turn to missionary missions 
 But fuck if I'm sitting still unless I'm sitting near a digit 
 Bet you you'll reconsider if you consider where we get it 
 The sweetest shit that you ever dreamed, till you arisen like wait, hold up 
 I go to sleep and see a ki' 
 Sleep kinda different 
 When it's begging you to get it 
 I mean, peep it 
 I go to sleep and see a ki' 
 Sleep is out the norm 
 But I'm wit it till the morn 
 At least, peep it 
 I go to sleep and see a kilo 
 Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole 
 Collecting my gratuity, married to the reload 
 As long as we repeating we'll never be with the repo's 
 Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows 
 If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats 
 Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist 
 Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip 
 I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest 
 And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders 
 With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful 
 Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you 
 Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave 
 Oversleep cause you know it's easier there to breathe 
 And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love 
 Till the lock is all plugged and you banking on a key, you get it? 
 Starting to think I need counseling 
 'Cause when I go to sleep I see 36 ounces 
 Damn, all I remember was the bouncers telling me put the smoke out 
 Tryna move this coke out, woke up in a cold sweat, then I broke out 
 Trine go back where I left, it ain't right tho 
 You know I'm in the kitchen to chef, straight nitro 
 Fiends say when they take a hit, it make the pipe glow 
 Hoping I see the same shit the next night yo 
 Great powder, we usually don't allow it 
 If this is what it's about, I'ma need my 8 hours 
 Cause dreams come true at the end of the day 
 Pray before I wake that I finish the yay 
 When you don't recognize your blessings you send 'em away 
 But let's keep that on the dlow 
 When I go to sleep I see a kilo 
 Baby, you need me. Wake up for me. I know you see me 
 When you wake up baby, come to me 
 Come back to me baby, let me be yours 
 Te voy a enseñar lo que puede llegar a ser conmigo 
 Todo lo que siempre has deseado era real puede llegar a ser real para ti papi 
 Lead me to the street, come see me baby
