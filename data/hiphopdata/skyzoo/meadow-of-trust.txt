Luminous breaths in the dark time 
 And I laugh as we go down, down 
 As we go down, down, down 
 It's settled we are each other's 
 Meadow of lust, meadow of lust 
 In a Meadow of trust 
 You've become my secret 
 I like it when we get lost 
 The way you go deeper 
 Nothing else matters more 
 The way you go deeper 
 The way you go deeper 
 The way you keep going deeper now 
 Nothing else matters more 
 Big bright lights 
 But the room so dark 
 How it feels when we lay 
 Will you take me all the way? 
 Will you take me all the way?
