It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen 
 Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves 
 Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene 
 Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve 
 Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts 
 More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count 
 On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out 
 Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town 
 Town business like you found business when you brought it down 
 Borderline till a 745's brought around 
 And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away 
 You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away 
 Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away 
 Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be 
 Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece 
 Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die 
 Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that 
 And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback 
 Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that? 
 Point out what you want and it's yours 
 Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that 
 And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback 
 Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that? 
 Point out what you want and it's yours 
 It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout 
 Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs 
 The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist 
 And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out 
 Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front 
 Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want 
 But retro's is a weekly occurrence 
 And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished 
 In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone 
 Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home 
 Till they teach you 'bout a throne and the leather that the seat on 
 Is from the same couch you got your feet on 
 Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on? 
 Grew up idolizing like "if Jay on, then we on" 
 Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece 
 Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die 
 (Verse 3: Skarr Akbar) 
 It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in 
 Pressure bends knees like the side effects of klonopins 
 You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans 
 The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try against 
 Silence, talk less and do more 
 No time to ask "who is it?" when knockers knock at your door 
 Put yourself in a position to listen 
 Or be a victim 
 Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore 
 When summer falls, we spring into the winter 
 Recruit 'em at front and center 
 Move product with new beginners 
 So the package that we lend ya 
 Out of respect for ya father 
 Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow 
 Just do it how they taught ya 
 And everything will work if you believe that 
 Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that? 
 Thrown in the position to be with it if you want piece 
 Whether you agreed or denied 
 Doe or die
