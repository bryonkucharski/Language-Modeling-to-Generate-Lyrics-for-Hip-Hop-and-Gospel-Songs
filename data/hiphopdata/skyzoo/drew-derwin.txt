Walk of shame out this Gansevoort 
 Pockets full but you laying there, I can't afford 
 But I'll be good baby, maybe this is hand in arm 
 And we was just getting our handle on wonderful night 
 Shit I never seen, shit that you never felt 
 Wanting to never leave, twisting whatever's dealt 
 Talking to let it be, listening when you melt 
 Still on my G, baby, let it tell 
 Tell you what you love and picturing me to mean it 
 Told me, "Give that up sky, I want it and I need it" 
 And you ain't have a prob showing me the way you keep it 
 Like this will go beyond where we are, fuck a reason 
 And I can love or leave it but I ain't leaving none of this to part with 
 So I'll just play the part for the bargain 
 You put it where your heart is, baby, I ain't mean it 
 It's not that I ain't want to, it's just that I ain't see it 
 Just call it Drew and Derwin 
 We made the night, we made it a wonderful night 
 I didn't wanna fall in love, I thought that one time was enough 
 But tonight if we do it all again I hope we don't fall in love 
 Let's just make tonight another wonderful night 
 Two finger hooking your murder heels 
 Memories double timing, look like you're hurt for real 
 We never pictured last night becoming today 
 We both wanted us, shit we one in the same 
 Carrying on like I'm with it all 
 Laying underneath you and treating you like this is yours 
 Word to the Mags and the bottles of Cavit that's by the dresser 
 I build walls after I compress 'em 
 I'm told that I turn cold, giving them hard dick 
 And straight to the hole like Kemba Walker, it was taking it's toll 
 And feeling awkward is the way I suppose that this supposedly goes 
 'Cause on the low I'm supposed to be home 
 And you'll pro'lly meet a dude who's due up to find a role 
 And after like a month, dude will pro'lly propose 
 And I'll applaud it and all that it's coming with 
 I'm nowhere near that, I usually run from it, just call it Drew and Derwin 
 We made the night, we made it a wonderful night 
 I didn't wanna fall in love, I thought that one time was enough 
 But tonight if we do it all again I hope we don't fall in love 
 Let's just make tonight another wonderful night 
 Hope we don't, hope we don't fall in love, fall in love 
 And it was nice while it lasted, right? 
 I gave you mic, you gave me adlibs, right? 
 It wasn't right but that was past tense 
 I guess that I wouldn't be mad 
 If you was to move on and pretend I never happened 
 You giving me all, just pretend that never mattered 
 You gripping the walls and getting on your ladder 
 Let's call it time lost, let's put that all in back of us 
 And leave that over there
