In the kitchen, stove clicking while you looking back 
 I'm looking too, I look at you like "let me cook in that" 
 I'm cutting through while you working to put your foot in that 
 I bust a move and serve you like "where Brooklyn at?" 
 Right here baby, I'm right here baby 
 And your hand touching your stomach like "you right there baby" 
 Believe it, sucker for curves and knowing the way to keep a curve 
 So you dressing up a plate is like the sweetest word 
 Sing a couple tunes, the aroma hit the room 
 Like if you was K. Michelle how you bezerking with a spoon 
 Baby crazy at the stove top, oven door, dope spot 
 Snatching up a crown how you cut 'em off, close shop 
 Late night, early morning, sleepover benefits 
 If you can pull shrimp and grits, I'll be at your fingertips 
 Talking with your hands will have me listening for days 
 And tell your friends that all of my friends feel the same 
 Models is a given, know that off the look 
 But all we want is just some women who can cook 
 All we want is just some women who can cook 
 All we want is just some women who can cook 
 Walking round the kitchen 
 In your Vicki's get us hooked 
 Cause all we want is just some women who can cook 
 All we want is just some women who can cook 
 All we want is just some women who can cook 
 From the K but my family from the country 
 A bowl of banana pudding is the dopest way to love me 
 You say I gave you the dopeness 
 I say I'm just whipping the way you whip at the stove and 
 Compliments in doses 
 Compliment the way that you was brought up by your mother 
 Like "fuck it I never met her but I love her, tell her I love her" 
 Telling you now how addicted we can both get 
 You strung off the long and me off of salmon croquettes 
 You be on your "Chopped", gourmet'ing off whatever 
 Then you head to planet fitness and you shave it off your measurements 
 Calling it sweet potato pie the way you let me in 
 And even though I can't fit it all, there ain't a better fit 
 Ha!, double meaning still around 
 Double up throughout the day, double seasoning your style 
 Baby talking with your hands will have me switching up your name 
 And tell your friends that all of my friends feel the same
