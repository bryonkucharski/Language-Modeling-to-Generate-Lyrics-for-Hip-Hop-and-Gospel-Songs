All day, always 
 All of us is for it 
 Ain't a song change 
 All the shit we saw is what we all became 
 And we all that we got 'long as the song plays 
 We hung out in front of the corner store 
 Got older and took it to the liquor store 
 Money low, so bet we wanted more 
 Only way we'll separate is how we pick the course 
 Of course we, know where we belong, we 
 Nowhere next to home but won't be long until we home, see 
 Know that when we home we putting on where they can all see 
 Know that they'll adore how we adorn so as long as we 
 Loaded up with cargo, whichever way the car go 
 The outcome's a murcielago 
 Mercy upon anyone feeling mercy at their heart tho 
 My outcome's a merciless God flow 
 God be with us, a R&B bitch is enough to inspire us 
 And we Dej Loaf for that loaf if they comfortable trying us 
 See?, baby it's easy to adapt to what you be around 
 Being next to A' is why my aim will never see the ground 
 Being next to Bro is why you know we all or nothing right? 
 Being next to Mel we never fell, we never cut the lights 
 Being next to Pesos 
 Was GQ and Bishop before their hiccups 
 Cause loyalty is nothing you can pay fo' 
 Love him like brother, that man there like my brother 
 And if it ever should come to it that man would let a K' go 
 So going for advancement is the root we would stand in 
 Scared of being dormant so, we grew with our hands in 
 Hands put together, all the prayers people sent us 
 Saying don't believe the hype, don't grow up to be a ni**er 
 Don't grow up and become a typical ni**er while you here 
 Like who you with every day, leave them ni**as over there 
 What?, damn, I feel funny even saying that 
 That word is foreign and my friends could never make me that 
 Duly noted if needed but know it never will 
 Easy to adapt when you around whatever's real
