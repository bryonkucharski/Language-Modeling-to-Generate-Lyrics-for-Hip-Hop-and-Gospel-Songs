Still call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O, say nobody did it closer 
 They was climbing from below him 
 And they clocking where I'm throwing like I got it for the lower 
 Turn this room into a lobby like I got this wide and open, ha 
 Bottom line is give and go, riding high, ceiling low 
 Can't nobody dub it so I'm five alive kicking flows 
 Call me top five, live and die by the shit I wrote 
 Bitches swinging by like let me ride or let me live alone 
 Fitteds on my off day, basements is all gray 
 Louis pouch toothpicks, quotables is Andre 
 Wrote about the hall way, flow is in and out 
 If they speaking on my sneakers then they foaming at the mouth 
 Say I did it for the borough, how we looking? How we looking? 
 Ain't no dancing in that kitchen, if they cooking then they cooking 
 Say they handle how you get it wit no looking when you looking 
 Tell 'em hands is out the window when I'm pushing what I'm pushing 
 On it like a replay, run this like a relay 
 Do it for where we stay, we be on that give it up 
 Made it looking easy, promise when you see me 
 (May) 
 Do it for where we stay, we be on that give it up 
 Shorty know how we play, took that over easy 
 Do it for where we stay, we be on that give it up 
 Do it for where we stay, we be on that give it up 
 We be on that give it up, we be on that give it up 
 Day to day we on it, my day to days is flawless 
 When they was waiting for Jordans I vacay'ed wit Jordan 
 My gateway was retarded, G4's is 10 a go 
 Google me and 5 world series show, really though 
 Clearly though Hennessy and spade is all we cheering fo' 
 Long as A is wit me I'll be in here till they clear the flo' 
 Playing now or never wit whoever got her clear to blow 
 There we go, know your way around like you been here befo' 
 Too much of a better thing but said that if we got it 
 We would do it up for everything and never be without it 
 We would do it how they never did and bet you if you doubt it 
 That we true enough to rep it and forever be about it, ha 
 'Bout it like a Miller, 'bout it, 'bout it like for realla 
 Went spurs wit the ace and poured a bottle out for Dilla 
 How they serving off this tray, know we out here full of winners 
 Got her slurred off the base like this bottom bout to kill her 
 And I'm in, new sneakers, few divas with 2 seaters 
 'Cause swag attracts swag, believe us 
 Back track when you see us, money talks in echoes 
 Never feared the moment, I'm more so on my Melo 
 Or more so Gapetto, flying everywhere 
 Tear a lining in the air, dump the guts from my 'Rello 
 It's Dj Prince, make your girl hit falsettos 
 Dreaming to be on my team, I told her hell no 
 Double R my L-O, monogram where the loops at 
 Living for whatever, it's whatever to recoup that 
 Guessing that you knew that on it from the jump 
 Said I'm fly enough to look like I just tossed 'em out the trunk 
 And you call it what you want 'cause all we do is live it up 
 Signature style what we bringing 'bruh, give it up 
 Fly guy etiquette, ride by repping it 
 Do it how these mu'fuckas never did, give it up
