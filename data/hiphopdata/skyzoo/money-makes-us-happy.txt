Scared to death 
 By this race I've run 
 All that's left, is everything I want 
 And I'm slowly losing my time 
 Quickly taken back from me 
 Seems my friends are few 
 Mama said prepare to pay 
 Cause happiness comes from money 
 Happiness comes from money 
 Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything 
 And everything is now and, now is more than never and 
 There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so 
 If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo (4) 
 Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at 
 Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached 
 Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all 
 They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along (8) 
 So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most 
 It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both 
 It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close 
 It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke (12) 
 And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through 
 Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you 
 So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all 
 And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag 
 And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go 
 Money turns some of its earners into something terrible 
 Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go? 
 Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable? 
 In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you 
 To do it over I'd've taken better care of you 
 It costs money for the birth, more for the burial 
 Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle 
 We want more but need less, desires and requests 
 I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just 
 Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me 
 And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy 
 I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality 
 In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me 
 Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me 
 So my apologies, what's my problem yo?, it's gotta be the money 
 And it was falling out the sky like if Doug E. Fresh was performing 
 And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us 
 In pictures in front of back drops till like 4 in the morning 
 In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment 
 Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name 
 And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away 
 And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up 
 And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is 
 Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never 
 Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of 
 Your happy then get at us yo 
 Money 
 No surrender now and no restraints 
 No complaints 
 (Lord knows the price will only raise)
