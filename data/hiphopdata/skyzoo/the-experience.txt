Smothered chicken as far as breakfast goes 
 Shout out to the left overs that left us those 
 Cheese grits like a remix how we stretching those 
 In 9th grade Pierre would keep his weapon close 
 I still treat breakfast the same, my friends still catch wreck with their aim 
 I'm still henny and coke, and speaking of 
 We was surrounded by it 
 And ducking all the jewels from the users on that diet 
 And we ain't have the heart to try it but saw the brave ones 
 And looked at that as a jewel on how they became one 
 We all shared last names with them same ones 
 And Penny's where I learned my J from, I'm built how I'm built 
 Solo artist but I never had to sing alone 
 The scent Creed and the Timbs is never single sole 
 The whip was low enough for me to be low 
 But loud enough for you to be in the know 
 Know we salute to the experience 
 We were the loud ones with quiet souls 
 Intentions well and good but buried underneath over pricing 
 We wanted nothing more than everything, simply everything 
 Whatever that entails, we wanted it and still do 
 Still do we never sit still, as being settle is being settled 
 And we could never became that 
 And never will 
 Grew up with a bunch of Lenny Cooke's 
 May God bless 'em all like a Biggie hook 
 They hooked us early as far as the way these women look 
 And looking for 'em had us looking for a bigger push 
 Call it the laws of attraction baby 
 It's nothing more than a reaction baby, we push this to get you 
 Whatever "this" is, as long as what it gets is 
 All that we assumed but shit you know the way that "this" fits 
 In square trucks Tryna bring a couple models 'round 
 The same ones who brought your bottles down 
 I bottled up the ambition and passed it around the room 
 Till half us around the room know the logic now 
 And all of us ain't see the vision so some of us got left behind 
 But nothing could yet divide us from our calling now 
 Like how the call to the corner was as sweet as quarter water 
 All for you to wanna climb up on us now 
 Salute to the experience 
 Sweeter than sweet potato soufflé 
 Store runs for extra sugar and those runs showed us 
 More than those who sent us ever would've 
 Or as sweet as a scam that left our finger prints dirty 
 But our sneakers clean and our company cleaner 
 The taste of life in all its glory 
 Be it Harvard or heinous, we took it where none would take it 
 And poured Henny over it's glory 
 Back when me and Biz played the coupe 
 He showed me the lane, I showed him stoops 
 We showed each other money, and loyalty be everything it seems to 
 So lil Biz will be straight if you ever need dude 
 The same agenda applies to all of my friends who 
 Saw that coinciding was nothing coincidental 
 Never, it's just the way we're put together 
 And none of this shit could be any better 
 Salute to experience 
 A generation generating genius 
 Hard headed like the curb beneath us 
 They say in the absence of logic you search for motive 
 But really motive defines us based on being aware of logic 
 And aware of the dollars and yeah "mo' money mo' problems" 
 But no money no options, see the logic? 
 And for that, we salute to the experience
