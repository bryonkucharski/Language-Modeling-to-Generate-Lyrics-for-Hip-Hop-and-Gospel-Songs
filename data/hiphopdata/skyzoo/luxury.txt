Designer sweats off designer plugs 
 My fan base peddle crills or designer drugs 
 Money hand over fist like a Steiner glove 
 Drop jeep, box seats what I remind you of 
 Aura of the city, everything that I came for 
 In a carry-on, I carry on like a wave board 
 Handing work to whoever like if my aim's gone 
 Fly murder forever like "get your name Lord" 
 Devil wears Prada, Hitler wears Hermes 
 I be in Celine with your queen going burlesque 
 Either that or Supreme, I'm supremely the deity 
 Crowned off the point how I weave where the needle be 
 And it's leaving legendary if it come to me 
 Rep means everything, mine means luxury 
 And we Tryna turn bread like Harpo 
 Talking Marlo with a Partlow arms fold 
 (Pre-Hook) 
 If I don't make it bet the fam will 
 Watch the city fall in love with us 
 Clyde Frazier with the hand skills 
 Double rings baby, double up 
 Wore the same Balmains outside for a week straight 
 Fronting like we ain't rich 
 Baddest chick you ever seen in your life 
 Pulling bottles all night like she won the chip 
 You know we here for the luxury, yeah 
 You know we here for the luxury, yeah 
 Until we filthy with the bank roll, yeah 
 Know we here for the luxury 
 Winning lasts forever baby, swear to God it's like we won already 
 Word to counting everything that we done drunk already 
 Only thing that they can say is that they wasn't ready 
 For real, salute to how we was brought up 
 Fly guy etiquette turned us into marauders 
 How I throw etiquette 'round the way they taught us 
 In short chains and Balmains how God want us, ha! 
 Luxury, see where that'll get you? 
 With a Cici Amor Tryna be like Karen Civil 
 Print game silly so my Nike Tech gorgeous 
 Casper the friendly, writing for the Forbes list, ha 
 Yeah, Earl the Pearl when I'm at it B 
 So who you love is being me, all flattery 
 Flattered to be what they never was 
 First to the money, everything is FGR 
 Crowns all around, we about a win 
 Luxury talk, everybody want in 
 All day ones, with it till it ends 
 Counting up together, same as it been
