Things I, should've told my friends 
 Thought we all saw it and, knew how this would end, yet again 
 Ending wasn't ever understood 
 Word to killing everything we could, and pray we're good 
 Things I, should've told my friends 
 Thought we all saw it and, knew how this would end, yet again 
 Ending wasn't ever understood 
 Word to killing everything we could, and pray we're good 
 In love with living like a song of mine 
 But know that living off the love is only borderline 
 And the lines left to get across to get you more could get you lost 
 So they said to bring a cross like they was talking lines 
 Mapping out the most heinous of a way in 
 And you bottle your emotions like a weigh in 
 And waving at the thought of what they see in us, never really being us 
 Like we was saying hi but it was leaving us 
 The couple that believe in us is looking like the pair that we can stand on 
 And standing on your word is all that's left to put your hands on 
 My hands was on the wheel but we forgot to bring the cross 
 So all the lines that they was talking 'bout was more than what we thought 
 Pray to God that he forgive us and he fuck with us the long way 
 'Cause we just want the room screaming Stronjay, "Stronjay!" 
 Word to all the Jacqueline's and all that we've attracted and 
 The fear that forgiveness ain't the only thing that matters and 
 It turns into the... 
 And I'm perceived as sorta making it 
 Toast to all the imagery and all of the mistakes in it 
 Seeing is believing till you seen reciprocating it 
 Taught to hold the mirror up and never look away from it 
 And given what it means and everything that you can take from it 
 Holding out to try to find their place in it 
 And placing us with all the same motives but the motives got a way with us 
 Shame how they be lifting up away from us 
 And loyalty of standing with your day ones, banners with your a1's 
 Nike gloves rolling hand in hand with where you came from 
 Finger prints smeared, ambition in the air 
 Hands twitching and you drifting off the rhythm of despair 
 'Cause we grew up the same but I had a couple ringers 
 Like my pops ain't never leave and my moms did every scene 
 So the story we was shooting stayed similar indeed 
 But my ending might've shifted even more than we perceived 
 On a long list of... 
 The kid who moms had 2 jobs while she was raising him 
 His pops got his hands dirty Tryna make a way for him 
 Outside looking more alluring everyday to him 
 Swear to God all of this could've went either way with him, right? 
 Cause street dreams are made of these 
 Your heroes push Beamers, Rovers and AMGs 
 A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a ki' 
 Everybody is looking for something 
 Street dreams are made of these 
 With shorties on their knees for Louboutin's and Celine 
 Who am I to disagree? 
 Everybody is looking for something
