As I think of how to begin this, I already thought up the ending 
 And if the ending dictates the way the start of it's written 
 Then I'm really rewinding what isn't, get it? 
 Swear it gets harder to get it but when you got it 
 To get it again's more innocent, it's like product 
 Concealing the end is in a sense how lights got us 
 And sealing the win's where it begins, it's right by us 
 Labeled it type bias, to be one in the same 
 Or maybe they might buy us, to see one of us change 
 Or say that they might bye us, and leave us yet again 
 For a gain like pills on the banners of your screen 
 Know to handle the regime is the handle on the lead 
 And the hands do extend till a hand is outta reach 
 And the reach be the limbs that'll balance out the means 
 And the means to it all will get a ski mask involved 
 And you winning or you swimming in a flood of the maroon type 
 Sheets by the dozen and you covered by a boom mic 
 Pardon, the most humble of an autograph 
 The threaded needles of Desert Eagles and honors raps 
 The high of thinking you can find more 
 The balance of the script when a shooter signs off 
 Ballerina fits like two inside four 
 All for the intrigue of a suicide door... 
 Saw the doors lifting up 
 And then they never came down 
 I mean they rode around the block with the doors lifted up 
 Like they was flying off the ground 
 And then they told us that they call those suicide doors 
 They said they call those suicide doors 
 The break lights was 100 dollar bill green 
 And we was green for a suicide door 
 And as we take this to a further route 
 The steps move like its word of mouth 
 The steps move like if they was stepping with us when we further out 
 So step two becomes to work around 
 It gets lighter than a fly knit, tighter than a eye slit 
 Brighter than the writer you was bright enough to climb with 
 Complimenting you while biggin' up me 
 Just brings us up to speed to the steps that we aligned with 
 Then it all ties in, tied up to keep down 
 Or cover up your eyes when it flies like you Dee Brown 
 The complexities of rubbing arms next to me 
 It all adds to these bags of longevity 
 It's like, I'm Wayne Shorter with a ratchet fetish 
 Or, I'm Mendecees with a jazz collection 
 In other words, I covet what they covered 
 Like overflowing cupboards spilling Gold Medal dreams 
 And running to the cupboard like you're gold medal breed 
 Or bred, and fed how that Gold Medal steam 
 Meanings all over, you can pick the one that suits you 
 Depending the tie the accessory could lose you 
 See how we still twisting shit together? 
 Black ice dangle from the mirror that reflects us 
 Black ice tangled till the loop is tied off 
 All for the intrigue of a suicide door...
