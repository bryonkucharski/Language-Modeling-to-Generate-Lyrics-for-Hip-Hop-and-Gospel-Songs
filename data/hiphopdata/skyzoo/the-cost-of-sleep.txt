For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 And should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 The commas in the price tag, they talk to me 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Long as you never know, you know all you need 
 And knowing alone is for the low and behold 
 Low and behold I'm still the soul of the hole 
 But losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it 
 Vision better but who am I to believe it 
 So losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it 
 But its whatever if you decide on sleeping 
 True as Posturepedics and laying there 
 Listening the same shit that drove Rich and them 
 DVD stars off of fam going missing 
 And we just see the odds open handed 
 Gripping them, vice city 
 See we involved from the entrance 
 And DWI in the car but I'm good 
 On my intentions till them lights get me 
 So pay me now, pay me later and for yesterday 
 Mite nod a little but I was never late 
 Hurry up and buy like you ain't never wait 
 You lay down and you levitate 
 See if the twin mattress could talk 
 The songs that it would harmonize 
 All the living I was living for the non alive 
 All the bitches that was in it wit they heart in mind 
 And all the women that was missing when my heart arrived 
 Pardon I, I was just was on a high 
 Peddler theme music but now I just wanna ride 
 And painting it for the Bose 
 You prayed that they car wasn't halted 
 And now you just praying that they don't doze 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 And should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 The commas in the price tag, they talk to me 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Long as you never know, you know all you need 
 Publishing checks and letters from jail 
 Come to me at the same time, that's my regular mail 
 Honest, they say the cost of success could weigh out your living 
 But what it cost for that rest will pay out the difference 
 And what we on is to the left, made to be different 
 If we was wrong from the get we'll stay to revisit 
 Now sing a song for the rep but change up the endings 
 'Cause we put on to the death, may he forgive us 
 For everything that we can count on 
 The overall is getting my amount on 
 Something I can mount on and say that this was worth it 
 If I should ever doze it just brings me down to perfect 
 'Cause me I'm never faded, I made it where he made it 
 Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment 
 Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence 
 Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest 
 At least among these new mu'fuckas 
 That was born in the 80's and better 
 Called it Dickensian when I got to playing wit letters 
 Call up Larenz and them and tell them that tape is forever 
 But what its 'bout is everything that you doubt 
 Applause for the 2 doors and the keys for the entry 
 And please y'all please don't tempt me 
 Leave me in this corner wit these stanzas alone 
 You figure this out, you'll see I stand on my own, receipts in the bag 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 And should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 The commas in the price tag, they talk to me 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Should you ever doze, you doze cautiously 
 For the cost of sleep and what it cost to sleep 
 Long as you never know, you know all you need 
 Me, I'm never faded, I made it where he made it 
 Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment 
 Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence 
 Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest
