One time up for Chi Ali 
 'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen 
 My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali 
 Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali 
 They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever 
 One time up, sowing the sides up 
 Hometown heroes like you know where to find us 
 Looking over your shoulder like I'm slowing the ride up 
 First time listeners, they ain't know what a line was 
 Blue and orange everything, loaded the line up 
 Got 'em looking for lines like they hope they can tie up 
 A spoon full of 'ron when I shoot and give a bar 
 Give or take, I'm in a space that's usually regarded 
 For wakes or living aces, truthfully regardless 
 Look at who they telling me to par with 
 Pardon me though, bred different so I'm arguably so 
 You arguing over crowns dude arguably, no 
 I was fitted to wear that fitted and wear that living 
 For the living, you hear that penning? Well yeah, that did it 
 I mean it's all just as real as they say 
 And blame Chi if anybody is feeling a way, one time 
 One time up for Chi Ali 
 'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen 
 My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali 
 Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali 
 They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever 
 Doing numbers, tryin' to do the summer 
 Dreaming outta control, said we tryin' to coupe the hummers 
 Leaning out of a hole like we tryin' to duck the edges 
 And leaving papi alone 'cause we out here running credit 
 Young, early 90's in the heart of the K 
 Saw the servers, corners had targets for days 
 Any reason is a go, how they squeezing you should know 
 Draped in Columbia jackets, beepers and Girbauds 
 I mean, played lockers wit tomorro's front pagers 
 White and purple huaraches, tryin' to murder the lobby 
 I mean all we knew is what we saw first 
 Wheels up for whatever 'til it all works 
 And I tell 'em one time up for Chi Ali 
 'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen 
 Gray basements on all of my fitteds, if I'm on then we did it 
 Applaud with it if you see my lead, one time 
 One time up for Chi Ali 
 'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen 
 My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali 
 Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali 
 They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 My Jansport strings was tying it all together 
 And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever
