The moments we all waited for 
 Dreaming down on the first, we all paying for 
 More to be expected and more to get you acquainted on 
 We all in for the win until the parade is on 
 We're gone, and the drive is with the roof peeled 
 The AC on, providing how the truth feels 
 Cold, chilly chill like our demeanor be 
 But all of this shit is really about the scenery 
 Cause sightseeing's like window shopping

 To these women I sell hope baby 
 Shit I swear I'm just my daddy all over again 
 The only one on the block so now we all like him 
 Tell the money, I want the love, baby I want the love 
 For all the right reasons that may just be from above 
 I came up where you see the paper and fall in love 
 And the only way you got your Mercedes was off of drugs 
 They put it front and center while I saw around the corner 
 But the same one was parked around the corner, explains why we...
