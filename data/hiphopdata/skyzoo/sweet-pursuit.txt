(Hook: Skyzoo) 
 Uh, in my sweetest pursuit 
 Love is love but it never was easy to move 
 They tell me everything I love and I see what it do 
 They tell me everything I love but I need it from you 
 Uh, in my sweetest pursuit 
 Love is love but it never was easy to move 
 They tell me everything I love and I see what it do 
 They tell me everything I love but I need it from you 
 (Refrain: Kay Cola) 
 The more we run alone 
 The less we seem to move 
 The less we're on our own 
 The sweeter the pursuit 
 Good intentions at the root of it 
 Blaming us is only shaping us to keep pursuing it 
 Reaching for a dollar on a needle, get to looping it 
 Make enough to say you made enough when you was through with it 
 Cause none of this is what they was pointing to when we saw them 
 But still in all we was committed to Tryna see it 
 Like some of this is everything we have forever wanted 
 To get involved and to be living beyond reason, right? 
 Tryna keep it, and draw a tag on it 
 You know how we get it, right?, duffle bags for it 
 The simplicity of banking on a victory 
 And putting your belief in a baton as the centerpiece 
 But it's one of those, and it's a ton of us 
 So when it comes to you it comes to every one of us 
 Treat it all the same and all of this will be different 
 To see what we became is to see what they all missing 
 (Hook] + [Refrain) 
 In the spirit of tug of wars where love is lost 
 In the crossfire and something's drawn and dumping off 
 Half don't make it, the other half will duck and crawl 
 And turn Caine tryna save who remains 
 Raised as a JW and so the wayI was laid 
 Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor 
 Intuition will kick in and find a way to pry me off 
 I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia 
 Dealers is my audience, uniformed all of it 
 Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it 
 Music for my friends, and due to my begins 
 I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in 
 I never shook the feeling of the newest model Benz 
 But I stopped thinking that rappers and producers was my friends 
 'Cause it's a wonderful world till they cutting out the odds 
 And it turns out loyalty just wasn't in their cards 
 (Hook] + [Refrain) 
 My pursuit is on a pace of a shooter outta state 
 Where the heights are getting higher till they grew up outta place 
 And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes 
 And your aiming get erratic Tryna move 'em out the way 
 By the way, ain't a way that we can run this by ourselves 
 When we do it the pursuance turn the shooters outta shells 
 So treat it all the same and all of this will be different 
 To see what we became is to see what they all missing
