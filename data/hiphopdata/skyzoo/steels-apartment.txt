Sex money and murder 
 All the decorations they set up under the curtains 
 They sitting here singing they never wanted to hurt us 
 And never would they ever 
 So I guess they made good on they're promises all together 
 But maybe they really didn't 
 Meaning they really did get to semi auto lifting 
 Ricochet reasons when they ricochet rabbit us 
 Trick bullets that'll stop mid air and mallet us 
 We just tryin' to duck it but they bucking like if practice was 
 Targeted to here, out the window with this view 
 From this apartment with a stare that'll make you wanna see more 
 All of this intrigue will make you leave from outta these doors 
 And look for where Quiles is, bigger dreams 
 Penciled in Hennessy adrenaline 
 Throw down, stand up and die for it like blizzard did 
 40 ounces on 40 degree days, penning 40 bar verses 
 With 40 on each page and writing around the holes 
 I'm running outta room when I'm writing 
 So I suppose my pose is more in depth 
 My pose along the steps is home so to the death 
 We was built to play the right and I chose to bust a left 
 Dedicated to better living, spending on better women 
 Took it and ran wit when they said we better get it 
 Like we was doing good but we doing better winning 
 And knowing there could be no better ending 
 And it's dedicated to never living, spending but never getting 
 Took it to stand with it when they said we'll never get it 
 Like we misunderstood them wanting to never switch it 
 And knowing that this shit is never ending 
 And looking back on it, it all started in Steel's apartment 
 One in the same if there's something to say 
 Something to say like I was still just the one to remain 
 One to remain like I was dealing wit one in the cham' 
 One in the cham' like the feeling there is nothing to gain 
 Nothing to gain like I'm wheeling in to jump in that lane 
 Jump in that lane like revealing I was one in the same 
 It circles back and we just tryin' to jump in that ring 
 Jump in that ring like if we won't get to jump in again 
 I mean like all we wanted was opportunity 
 And even if we couldn't be exact, we knew the means 
 Even if we couldn't see a stack we was true to dream 
 And even when we got to be in that we never knew to eat 
 Fucking something or at least we was pursuing it 
 And ordering lobster fried rice if we was doing it, ha 
 Young and wide eyed, sprung off of Diddy crew 
 Like word to Puff wait 'til we get in these living rooms 
 Or better yet I 'cause I was all alone in a basement full of eyes 
 That was similar to mine with no similar in rhyme 
 None similar to mine and we kicking it like shit is live or die 
 Dedicated to better living, spending on better women 
 Took it and ran wit when they said we better get it 
 Like we was doing good but we doing better winning 
 And knowing there could be no better ending 
 And it's dedicated to never living, spending but never getting 
 Took it to stand wit it when they said we'll never get it 
 Like we misunderstood them wanting to never switch it 
 And knowing that this shit is never ending 
 And looking back on it, it all started in Steel's apartment 
 'Cause we once a crew of youngin's of the same kind 
 Quick to holla up at something with the same line 
 Never changed so if we out then I'ma still roll 
 And let the feeling remind us until the feeling's gone
