Alife hoodies for when the wind move 
 A lifestyle like no other how you want it 
 When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into 
 And pray to whoever you praise that you live through 
 Living for the light till the light becomes a signal 
 And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to 
 Then it turns round like the signals on the dial 
 And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals 
 Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate 
 Looking for a dimmer, get to cooking all winter 
 And you looking more Blizzard and this turns into a bar raid 
 "Aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised!" 
 Check day jumping, chest plate thumping 
 Freestyle to it, don't a neck brace want it 
 Soundtrack to the shooter, the soundtrack to it 
 The background music how the background do us 
 For the civilized leisure 
 This leisure needs to be civilized 
 Gotta have it, its already mine 
 Its already ours, its already ours 
 And it appears, the scent is in the air 
 The smell of Rosè and a nickel plated glare 
 The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare 
 Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears 
 Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there 
 There like a cling on, fear like the ring on 
 That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on 
 Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there 
 Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug 
 And it uturns to a pillow case and a rug 
 And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged 
 And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst 
 The doors shut and they forget to let you out first 
 The trap literally jumping and you stuck in 
 Being everything you saw when you wanted even more 
 And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all 
 For the civilized leisure 
 They say "Sky your story don't ever change up" 
 It never will, it's everything that I say it was 
 Forever will be centered on how we came up 
 On Tryna be in the center of where the cake be 
 They told us keep it the same and if the cake leave 
 Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe 
 May whoever's beside me have the same speed 
 Civilized where the leisure can take me 
 Civilized leisure
