The scene set for you to kill the room 
 Blowing kisses while you hitting everything that move 
 Murder when attention seems to get to you 
 My attention all that matters till it's getting through 
 Through to what I need most, usually what I keep close 
 Close enough to where you knew it like if we home 
 Told that I be stretching, we can see how far my reach go 
 Then I can reload, uh, and hit repeat mode 
 Pardon, I'm just a fan of better moments 
 And sitting with this bottle's where I stand to let you know it 
 Truth by the shot glass, handle what I'm throwing 
 And catching Avion got you handing me your phone and 
 I proceed before I leave like "she got me where she want me" 
 But a win is for the win, winning lotto ticket money 
 Going for it in your message saying we gonn' see 
 And how your coat still smells like Givenchy and that you love it 
 Baby I just want the time to show you how 
 I can be your favorite kind throughout the crowd 
 'Cause we steady chasing 
 And we were playing favorites 
 And we became one 
 Told you what it'd be like, and what you should expect 
 It all came to you off the rip, no regrets 
 They ask you if you good, you think of how I rep 
 And your eyes get wide, you ain't dealing with your ex 
 Cause you know how I rep, your crew start to notice it 
 Seen it in your step, my name all over it 
 Same rules apply, you see it all up mine 
 So when we step as a pair, every pair step aside 
 Reason to believe whoever I used to be 
 Is aside with them steps, say bye to who they seen 
 Say hi to knowing me, and hi to who you be 
 Cause being in the now is the high that you need 
 And product is the key, and you know nothing added to me 
 No steps, no pageant for me 
 So tell 'em all I do is rap and serve, like imagine how I serve 
 You see how I was flowing on my last CD 
 Your favorite one 
 Your favorite one 
 Your favorite one 
 Your favorite one 
 The moment you find what you wasn't looking for 
 But soon as you got it can you never put it back 
 Built off the juggle I know the worth of a double 
 Your hands work with the double and you let the money stack 
 Same rules apply, you see it all up in mine 
 They're one in the same kind I just handle the react 
 Do it how you do it I promise you I ain't moving 
 I knew it before I knew it, I forever wanted that
