Bigger stages to walk across 
 Brighter lights give way to the ambiance 
 Find the hype and if it stays then the all and all 
 Is by the lights and the persuading of the audience 
 Moments of the present, own it if you catch it 
 Few and far between but it's dope enough to stretch it 
 Moments of the present, own it and you rep it 
 Shoulder and the name got us holding up the leverage 
 Own it for a reason, right, long enough to see the sight 
 Picture what it be, what it means and what we be like 
 Driven through the seams and the scenes of the weaving mic 
 Be enough to be what they need to believe the flight 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it 
 I-I-I-I-I never felt so alive 
 Now we're touching the sky 
 Count them down till their over 
 'Cause no one can hold us 
 So live for the moment 
 Never blinded, 20/20 something better signage 
 Saw it out the corners when they wouldn't let us find it 
 On it for the corner and the sketching that's behind it 
 Bottles in the air if you ever need reminded 
 Celebrate confetti, if you ready then you catch me 
 And the streamers that precede us 'bout to lead us through the mezzi 
 The thought of what it couldn't be turned to what it shouldn't be 
 David Blaine lanes till it changed like "Look at me" 
 Found away to make, came up with a story 
 So whatever you play I literally saw that 
 Hinges got to move, I brought it where the door at 
 Pause for the applause or whatever you call that 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it 
 I-I-I-I-I never felt so alive 
 Now we're touching the sky 
 Count them down till their over 
 'Cause no one can hold us 
 So live for the moment 
 Couldn't find a light bright enough 
 Fuck the scared, jump in here and live the life with us 
 One in the air, cut through there and get it right with us 
 Or feel the ceiling and at least live the night with us 
 Never knew the feeling 
 But bet if you could feel it you would never forget it 
 You would let it do the steering 
 Never knew the feeling 
 But bet if you could feel it you would never forget it 
 You would let it do the steering 
 I-I-I-I-I never felt so alive 
 Now we're touching the sky 
 Count them down till their over 
 'Cause no one can hold us 
 So live for the moment 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it 
 Live for the moment, make sense don't it 
 Started where they did it but we took it where we want it
