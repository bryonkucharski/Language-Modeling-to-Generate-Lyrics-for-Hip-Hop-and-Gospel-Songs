The rage of Roemello, my name tryin' to echo 
 Staring so long I swear the page saying hello 
 I'm hearing these songs but tryin' to change up the metro 
 It feel like he'ron, the way I'm straining wit the let go 
 The rage of it all, I swear to God 
 Wrote it to make you call me dope man, dope man 
 Got y'all in tune but that tune got me moved 
 So if I choose to let this go 
 And bid this shit adieu and your listening improves 
 At least there's packages left if you living in that mood 
 See we attract to the stretch, everything should flip in twos 
 And if not we should stop like we did all we could do 
 So I'm on my gracefully bow and on my way to that bow 
 I leave it up to you to perform my grace for me now 
 I mean, hands folded, maybe the plans folded 
 Wasn't supposed to love it, they say that you can't show it 
 I mean, easier spoken of, see where this goes for us 
 Say it's real or at least hope that the motive was 
 Never had a second thought, never asked, never once 
 Knee deep in it, fuck it, we ain't leaving it 
 Until it all goes and we go to get to reach for it 
 And shit is smoke and mirrors and we swinging tryin' to see through it 
 Stick and move, I'm liable to switch and shoot 
 Like I ain't here to play with this fog, let's get this through 
 And I ain't here to stay with these odds, so when in tune 
 I'm either tryin' to even these odds or hit a new 
 As far as I can remember, we'd idolize through the winter 
 And rather be in the 4 like when Stoudemire's at center 
 I mean, GS 400's is all we wanted 
 However we do it long as we done it, the rage of Roemello 
 Listening to Gloria's youngest, had us all in the running 
 To wanna be what they told us we wasn't 
 Like all we need is to know if we running, it's not in place 
 'Cause ambition is by the day, word to Wale 
 I mean same scenery we was tryin' to believe to be 
 Had us counting wins before we had us an in 
 And sleeping is paper thin, no wonder why we don't do it much 
 Sheets barely used, tell 'em all of this is new to us, right? 
 And every dream that I dream is littered with the fiends 
 That I done seen while tryin' to leave these visions 
 And so to clear it, I wrote to wanna be like him wit it 
 I hope he hear it 'cause word to Chi Ali we did it 
 I hope he hear it, word to this blue Yank' 
 100 gray bottoms, these shits never lose rank 
 And agreeing that heavy is the fade under it but for the love of it 
 They look to you to carry it and everything its bundled with 
 Sunrise open your eyes, no surprise 
 Made it off of living for doe or die 
 Now you in the back of the coupe, glaring, half of the stoop staring 
 To the point where you can give away packs like Snoop Pearson 
 Think about it, yeah, that kinda rich 
 Sing songs for black hoodies and black violins 
 I mean the swan song for the evening 
 Forgive me in advance for your grievings, the rage of Roemello 
 The rage of Roemello, my name tryin' to echo 
 Staring so long I swear the page saying hello 
 I'm hearing these songs but tryin' to change up the metro 
 It feel like he'ron, the way I'm straining wit the let go 
 The rage of it all, I swear to God
