He said all I know is mad start 
 And when the gun go off, he turns black heart 
 'Cause when the runnin' is on, we all track stars 
 You either runnin' along or you a past mark 
 So either run with it forward or play the past part 
 There's no rides for the weary or weak 
 It's so quiet you can hear when you sleep 
 But so live you can clear in a week 
 With no ties, no ears to the street 
 No thrones, no homes, nothin' on 
 Nothin' promised outside, so what you hearin' is cheap 
 They say we all in this together 
 But somethin' gotta give or somebody gotta give till all of this get better 
 If all of this is forever and the goal is to change 
 Then you can't upset if we should go with our aim 
 And you can't see regrets if you controllin' your lane 
 Put your hand on your heart and you solemnly swear to get it 
 Driver seat, right side or rear, you with it 
 Cause shit is wicked on these mean streets 
 But where the green be is where we tryin' to stand, so we need reach 
 Dirty 'round here, so we need cleats, lace up now 
 I see you runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 I see you runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Huh, 'cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em) 
 So get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 'Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em) 
 So get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 Get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 Every step taken is a step gained 
 Or a step lost, dependin' on how your step change 
 When you step on, there's no returns or step aways 
 Either step cross or fall out of the step game 
 Shit is transparent tryin' to find where the step's made 
 If I can't bare it, I'm a die where the step's raised 
 And I can't hear when they cry, I'm at a step's pace 
 Cause for the love of everything that we saw 
 Everything that we want is everything that keep us sprintin' along 
 And the soles on your kicks turn as thin as the walls 
 So it's one knee down, both hands on the ground 
 When the six shot blows, all hands in the crowd 
 Turn parallel to you but the hands in the crowd 
 Were really just a mirage, ain't a stander around 
 Some look for God, some can't find a cloud 
 So they take it to the store where handlin' is allowed 
 The money starts grownin' as quick as the time change 
 Start countin' your steps, the line is five away 
 Four left so you ease up with it like "I'm straight" 
 You approach the third and they throw you a curve 
 And everything that you predicted is gone with the words 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 I see you runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Keep runnin', somethin' like a marathon 
 Huh, 'cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em) 
 So get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 'Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em) 
 So get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 Get your marathon on when you steppin' (when you steppin') 
 You approach the third and they throw you a curve 
 And everything that you predicted is gone with the words 
 You approach the third and they throw you a curve 
 And everything that you predicted is gone with the words 
 Everything that you predicted is gone with the words, huh
