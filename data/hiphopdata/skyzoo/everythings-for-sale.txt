Outside still smelling like where the winners at 
 Look at all these empires under these fitted hats 
 Look at the grills on the cars we could be leaning on 
 Now look at all these unmarked cars that's grilling back 
 Fuck, how real is that?, how real it is 
 All of us is just pictures of what the city did 
 The city made us to keep it the way you see it though 
 Or be alone when the world say what the city is 
 And we is who we say we is, you know us well 
 Part nerd, part grind like I know Pharrell 
 Frenzies outside, don't ever slow the deal 
 No circulars here you can't hold a sale, for real 
 Lo sweats and aqua 8s 
 Blew through the caution as long as you got a plate 
 Fruits of the labor whoever should want a taste 
 Swear we heard it all yo, everything they would say, all of it tho 
 Everything's for sale 
 Told us 5 passports 
 And we never going to jail 
 So we working on the 2nd 
 And the 3rd and the 4th and the 5th 
 Till it clicks like everything is for real 
 For real 
 Six degrees from whoever you need to get you yours 
 And Tryna get it is everything they applaud 
 Applause come by the doubles in double R's 
 The rhythm of it is trusting in the facade 
 Of an 80 thou' genie but it's flyer than Lashonte 
 Tinted up, me and mine hiding like I'm Wanya 
 Role players rather stand around till your part change, out for your cast, everybody 
 On they Andre, right? 
 But we the products of seeing product and comprehending 
 You see a bottle, you see a model, you compliment it 
 Early morning on that Mourning off a hard block 
 Calling Zo season Tryna make a couple cards pop 
 Pop!, like when you sitting in your living room 
 And you can hear pop! on the daily till it's typical 
 Tying up the motives like my double entendres 
 Until my friends can tell you that I Lebron'ed them 
 As real as they told us to be when the lights get to us 
 Like do it right and them fluorescents might stick to us 
 Star gazed like "see them and picture us" 
 The top flies off the Veuve and you steal the rush 
 Cause me and A' was going half on a hero while we'd pass by the heroes 
 Added how they had it then we passed by them heroes, elevator awe 
 Kills us to show them what a respirator's for 
 But all of us came up hearing everything's for sale
