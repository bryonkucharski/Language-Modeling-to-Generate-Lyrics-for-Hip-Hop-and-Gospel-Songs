Holla like whatever, all we needed was a reason 
 All this money they been showing 
 They got reasons through the ceiling 
 All we wanted was a part, all this seeing is believing 
 From the jump its from the heart, pardon we wit all this breathing 
 All this anticipation, all this keeping this shit even 
 All these hands in the way when all they reaching is beneath 'em 
 All these plans we done made, all we see is what we keeping 
 All you standing in the way is only leading us to be it 
 Bet whatever on the vision if they get it then they on it 
 If they don't but they close enough to see us and adore it 
 Let 'em watch from over there, let 'em watch and know we here 
 Better dreams while we up, better watches for your stares 
 Call it Range Rover rhythm and may we go and get 'em 
 At the will of what we on and may we blow the engines 
 May it be just what we want and may it all glitter 
 Just the same as what we saw 
 'Cause what we saw was fucking splendid 
 All the scenery they threw us, easy to influence 
 Nothing 'bout us changed so you can leave us if you knew us 
 Jumping out a Range had us dreaming to maneuver 
 And mu'fuckas tryin' to brand new us 
 Range Rover rhythm, corner store signature 
 I don't do it for me, I do it for the liquor store 
 Said we knew what it be, knew it what's about 
 Tryin' to 80 thou' somethin' 'fore we out 
 (And all we know is) 
 How the sweetest dream couldn't be anymore heinous 
 Promise if you sleeping you'll see where we all aiming 
 'Cause dreaming is all tainted but we was on that anyway 
 Should've never offered us to get a taste 
 Good to enough to want it on a bigger plate 
 Climbing through a kitchen tryna get a plate 
 Either find a way or go and drill away 
 Living like, 400 a pair, yeah my Penny's straight 
 Living like the ending was beginning with a get a way 
 Another day, another dollar, we just tryna get a day 
 And pull a whole decade within a day 
 Promise you my Penny straight 
 Straight enough to '95 Hardaway penetrate 
 And open up a lane if they don't give a lane 
 Lanes open bigger for that Range Rover rhythm 
 Tryin' to open up the hood and put a name on that engine 
 If it go misunderstood, I'll remain on my pivot 
 For a steering wheel draped in a vision 
 Range Rover rhythm, corner store signature 
 I don't do it for me, I do it for the liquor store 
 Said we knew what it be, knew it what's about 
 Tryin' to 80 thou' somethin' 'fore we out 
 Hospital days, reflecting when my man laid up 
 On a uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up 
 I saw his life slippin' on the day in question 
 I told him I would've went wit him, thank god he ain't listen 
 Reminiscing over Henny and all of them pictures 
 We ride around now knowing we're probably different 
 And how it sounds now, know me as part of the feeling 
 I gave it life, muthafuck a honorable mention
