Oh my god, Ronny 
 White J's, white Porsche 
 White wrist, white horse 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 I do not sniff or roll it 
 It do not drip when I pour it 
 I do not run, I reload it 
 I do not save it, I throw it 
 White J's, white Porsche 
 White wrist, white horse 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Please stop, please stop, please stop, please stop (stop that shit) 
 That fit look like you bought it at the kiosk (Was it on sale though?) 
 And they got the nerve to ask "Why she hot?" (she hot) 
 Why you counting all that money that we got? 
 I ain't worried 'bout no basic bitches 
 All y'all look like you still fly Spirit 
 All y'all must not've looked in the mirror 
 All y'all lookin' but the windows tinted, like (hi, bitch) 
 I don't know what made all y'all haters 
 Play if you want but you know I ain't playin' like 
 White J's, white Porsche 
 White wrist, white horse 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 It do not drip when I pour it 
 I do not run, I reload it 
 I do not save it, I throw it 
 White J's, white Porsche 
 White wrist, white horse 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Hi, bitch, hi, bitch 
 Grown as hell and you still hating 
 I look at you and thank god I made it, like 
 Hi, bitch 
 Hi, bitch
