(Feat. Trey Songz) 
 Don't let his wrist game fool ya 
 You the deal, be my ghetto princess, 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be straight without him 
 That's my word 
 And if your man can't please you, ain't real 
 Go on and kick him to the curb 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be without him 
 That's my word 
 Leave ya man I'm a betta look, why you stessin on me 
 Way to challenged (?) the... goddess 
 And I don't mind if you need time 
 Just as long as my number get dialed when you decide to walk out 
 So much stress on these shoulders 
 We ain't gotta fck I just wanna hold ya, so close 
 Let you know that I'm here for you 
 Stop cryin, I don't wanna see no tears from you 
 Don't let his wrist game fool ya 
 You the deal, be my ghetto princess, 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be straight without him 
 That's my word 
 And if your man can't please you, ain't real 
 Go and kick him to the curb 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be without him 
 That's my word 
 That's my word and I stand on it 
 Take a chance on me 
 Start answerin those fone calls, there homie 
 Move on, let's go do us 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout the car seat in the rover truck 
 Nah, I don't wanna rest nothin' 
 Just wanna let you know how committed I am to ya 
 Deep feeling for ya 
 I keep it 100 I'm the realest for ya 
 Don't let his wrist game fool ya 
 You the deal, be my ghetto princess, 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be straight without him 
 That's my word 
 And if your man can't please you, ain't real 
 Go and kick him to the curb 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be without him 
 That's my word 
 Brand new life, sky blue iced out 
 Rings quart thous' tonight 
 Brand new life, sky blue iced out 
 Rings fly, you my wife 
 What I gotta do to make you my girl 
 Take you to the hood, show you my world 
 Yeah I'm on my grown man 
 Out in public hold hand 
 Don't you feel better now that you took a chance 
 Two seat equip, big body full equip 
 Hair blowin' in the wind, shawty you straight with me 
 Chorus w/ Ad libs 
 Don't let his wrist game fool ya 
 You the deal, be my ghetto princess, 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be straight without him 
 That's my word 
 And if your man can't please you, ain't real 
 Go and kick him to the curb 
 Needta leave him right where you found him 
 Shawty you gon' be without him 
 That's my word
