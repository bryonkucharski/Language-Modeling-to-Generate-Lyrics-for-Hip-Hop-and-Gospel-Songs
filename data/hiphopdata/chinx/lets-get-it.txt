 Stoners, ha, NYC shit nigga 
 Pull in and whip it, pull in these bitches 
 Ran all dem digits, Stack through the ceiling

 I'll be counting all of this paper 
 Smoking all of this dope 
 Said I wasn't gon make it 
 Told me wasn't no hope 
 Always knew I was gon get it 
 Add the grease to that chicken 
 Known to fluff the dope when I whip it (whip that) 
 Bitch in less than 4 minutes 
 I got freezer burn on my left arm 
 Gas hoes like Chevron 
 Shot attempts can't fade me (nope) 
 Skin made of that Kevlar 
 Don't get lined up wit dem dots 
 Made my way up off them blocks 
 Smoking on a 12 foot yacht, open toe sandals you flop 
 Talking Coke Boy let's get it 
 My first tour was cocaine, went back and forth like tennis 
 In your bitch mouth, no dentist 
 Nosey bitch mind your business 
 I'm gon stack it up to that ceiling 
 I'm in traffic ducking that sentence 
 Found that pot of gold and dove in it

 I done came up of dem niggas 
 Seen the lane and I took it 
 Stove whipping that eco 
 Grandma like what's cooking (what's cooking?) 
 Talking car show, we roll out 
 Dress warm its cold out 
 Hard top roof fall out 
 Too fast bitch slow down 
 We ride through your street 
 She dialed up my main line, I slide with your freak 
 Told her told use no teeth 
 Came a long way from that bottom 
 Drinking out that bottle, still chasing 'em comas 
 Told me get 'em I got em 
 Talking 'bout the money we blew that 
 Nigga now why you go do that? 
 When I pull up she hop in it (skrrr) 
 Rest of 'em niggas like who dat? 
 Style on 'em niggas the worst way 
 We don't fuck with them in the first place 
 Nigga we get it the bitches they wit it 
 They know I get the pussy on the first date
