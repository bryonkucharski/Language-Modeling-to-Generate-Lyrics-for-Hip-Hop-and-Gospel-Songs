Chinx 
 Too much ground to cover 
 I don't know where to start 
 Can't find the words to tell you 
 I don't know where to start 
 French Montana 
 What ya gonna do when them boys come 
 Knocking at your front door 
 And they want war? Oh shit! 
 He ain't a rapper, he'll kill you 
 My life 
 Niggas just need to chill 
 Tryin' to live my life 
 But niggas wanna see me killed 
 It was cold on that corner 
 Lot of my niggas gone on that corner 
 Now it's floor seats, ringside by the ropes 
 Floor seats, playoffs by the coach 
 I know you hear me on your radio 
 I know you watch me in the video 
 Feds ain't watchin, niggas tellin' 
 That's why I'm Gucci, deal with Gucci 
 I'm ridin' clean, look at me 
 Tee the blur ova lock, wicked block 
 I'm drinkin' blue down for the pain 
 But fuck what you say, you's a lame 
 So we'll sit here in the silence 
 And watch the sun go down 
 And wonder if we'll ever 
 Meet again on higher ground 
 What ya gonna do when them boys come 
 Knocking at your front door 
 And they want war? Oh shit! 
 He ain't a rapper, he'll kill you 
 My life 
 Niggas just need to chill 
 Tryin' to live my life 
 But niggas wanna see me killed 
 Chinx 
 Lookouts on the corners, knockers on the aves 
 Snitches in the window, hoes sucking, giving up the info 
 Tryna escape through that brown water 
 Play king till they gems get snatched outta they crowns 
 And what beef? Those are cow's organs 
 It ain't no problem, 'cause if it was, he wouldn't be around walking 
 And fuck holding me up, I ain't no picket sign 
 My closest nigga crossed me like the Mason-Dixon line 
 Real nigga, we on different times 
 Already left these fuck niggas twice, waiting on them at the finish line 
 Clouds dark, shades even darker 
 That quick you get stripped outta yo life, Mary Hartman 
 French Montana 
 So we'll sit here in the silence 
 And watch the sun go down 
 And wonder if we'll ever 
 Meet again on higher ground 
 What ya gonna do when them boys come 
 Knocking at your front door 
 And they want war? Oh shit! 
 He ain't a rapper, he'll kill you 
 My life 
 Niggas just need to chill 
 Tryin' to live my life 
 But niggas wanna see me killed
