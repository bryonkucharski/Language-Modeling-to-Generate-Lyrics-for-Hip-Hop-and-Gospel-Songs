 Nigga we share that bitch 
 I thought you knew that 
 Our whips ain't the same nigga 
 I thought you knew dat 
 Fuck if they love me or hate me, I thought you knew dat 
 Top of that brand new mercedes, I thought you knew dat 
 Rather be rich than be famous, I thought you knew dat 
 I left the club with your lady 
 I thought you knew dat 
 (I thought you knew dat)

 Came in here smelling like money 
 Most love the scent of my cologne 
 Shoot a niggas head at the guard 
 Had to shoot him twice in the dome 
 Sweet under age pussy like an offer 
 You know I leave the lil bitch lost 
 Niggas said they fucking with the coke boy 
 Go on put the nigga on the phone 
 G5 Flex I done flew that 
 Broke nigga ask how you do that 
 Who done let you fuck niggas in 
 Looking at the niggas like who dat? 
 Banging wit some niggas screaming Eastside 
 They gon tell a nigga never who dat? 
 I be acting weird for the money 
 Nigga where the fuck you at? 
 Nigga we run New York City, I thought you knew dat 
 I woke up feeling like Diddy, I thought you knew dat 
 We gon ball out till infinite, I thought you knew dat 
 Send shells at fuck niggas snitching, I done been through dat 
 Fuck if they love me or hate me, I thought you knew dat 
 Top of that brand new mercedes, I thought you knew dat 
 Rather be rich than be famous, I thought you knew dat 
 I left the club with your lady

 Cap.One 
 A bitch ain't the same, I thought you knew dat 
 My plug just gave a hundred pounds of some birds 
 I'm runnin' through that 
 My Hittas don't play 'bout that action 
 They stomp a nigga whip him blue -black 
 I walk in the club I got 50k and pistols all in my book bag 
 MCM gang, Move Coke Major 
 My shoe cost a bear, nothing but favour 
 My whip was a hundred thou 
 Just to piss off the neighbours 
 I'm fucking up the extra middle finger to the hataz 
 Spend thirty thousand on the Rollie, I thought you knew that 
 These Cuban Links not from Cuba, but that's where my boo at 
 These bitches looking for that molly water, where the food at? 
 And these pussy niggas got their eyes closed, what they shoot at?
