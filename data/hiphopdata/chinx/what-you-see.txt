 Twenty pointers in the chain 
 How these niggas acting like they don't see? 
 When you staring in the eyes of a young drug dealer 
 What you see? (Tell Me what you see) 
 From the projects to the television, nigga that's something you could see 
 Nigga talking tunnel vision (green light) 
 Nigga had a better vision 
 Death threats on a nigga life, well then, we gon' see

 I'm busy getting that dough and 
 So I can get her a new home and
