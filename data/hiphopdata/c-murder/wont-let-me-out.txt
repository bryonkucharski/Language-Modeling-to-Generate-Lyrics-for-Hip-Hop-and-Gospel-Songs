Sittin' here in the belly of the beast, C-Murder 
 Trapped in crime behind bars, TRU 
 I'm locked up, ain't no love 
 They won't let me out, think they testin' me 
 Check this out 
 Incarcerated, eliminated, I sure hated it 
 It's hard labor for life that's what the judge stated 
 D.A. trippin', he shady, I think he wanna kill me 
 Talk to my cell every time I'm mad, I know he feel me 
 Yeah baby, I moved on, you can keep the pictures 
 That's my girl, she left me, she ain't keep it real wit me 
 Now I'm stressin', I need a victim so I can hit him 
 And 30 days in the hole is cold, but watch me ride wit him 
 I'm steady tryin' to find the motive, why do what I do? 
 The freedom ain't gettin' no closer no matter how far I go 
 My car is stolen, no registration 
 The cops patrollin' and that had 'em stopped me 
 And I get locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, oh 
 They won't let me out 
 (They got me botched up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, no 
 (Caught up, I'm locked up but they can't stop us) 
 They won't let me out 
 Some more visits and ripe chickens across the border 
 What's your number? I'm hurtin', let me get a money boarder 
 I owe my lawyer some change, now he might drop the case 
 Now if my player don't shake it, I might hop the gate 
 Starin' at these walls I'm fallin', he set my court date back 
 Payback when I shake back and cop a Maybach 
 I'm eatin' beans and lustin' on King's magazines 
 It seems I'm home free but it was just dream, damn 
 I get locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, oh 
 They won't let me out 
 (They got me botched up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, no 
 (Caught up, I'm locked up but they can't stop us) 
 They won't let me out 
 Visitation no longer comes by 
 Seems like they forgot about me 
 Commissary is gettin' empty 
 Cellmates eatin' food without me 
 Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life 
 (Move on with my life) 
 Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
 But instead I get locked up 
 I'm spreadin' my gangs 'cause I'm straight done in like a gang banger 
 Don't play no games and mess around and shank with the hanger 
 That's how I'm comin' and I do my dirt and stick and move 
 Tears tattooed, a head busta walkin' in these shoes 
 Snitches workin' with the warden, eyes open and scopin' 
 And these humps I'm smokin', got my lungs chokin' 
 I'm the big dog on the blocks, I got 2-for-1's 
 And 21 with a L, I'm hopeless, son, I'm locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, oh 
 They won't let me out 
 (They got me botched up) 
 I'm locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, no 
 (Caught up, I'm locked up but they can't stop us) 
 They won't let me out 
 Will you pay me a visit? 
 They won't let me out 
 Send me some magazines 
 (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Send me some money orders 
 They won't let me out, oh 
 Pay me a visit, baby 
 They won't let me out 
 (They got me botched up) 
 'Cause I'm locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Where's my lawyer? 
 They won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up) 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out, no 
 (Caught up, locked up but they can't stop us) 
 Get me out of here 
 They won't let me out 
 Locked up 
 They won't let me out 
 They won't let me out 
 I'm locked up 
 They won't let me out, no 
 (Where's my, I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out 
 I'm locked up
