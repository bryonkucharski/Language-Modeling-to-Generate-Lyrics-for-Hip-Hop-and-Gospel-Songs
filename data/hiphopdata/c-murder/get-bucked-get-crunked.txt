Uh Oh, there them TRU Boys go 
 Uh Oh, hit the muthafuckin flo' 
 (T-Bo) 
 Ah! 
 Came in this bitch to shut this muthafucka down 
 Baton Rouge and Louisiana so you know I'm bout to clown 
 When the thugs get to bussin, duck down hit the ground 
 Stay out my water boy if you don't want to drown 
 You keep fuckin' wit me, they gone find yo ass dead 
 When my song come on, they gon act a pussy on yo head 
 This for them thugs in the club, who straight, don't mind dying 
 And them ballers in the parking lot, straight sitting on shine 
 C-Murder called me up, and said "T-Bo it's time 
 To represent the dirty south and make 'em respect yo mind" 
 Trunk loads of soldiers always starting some shit 
 So stay the fuck from 'round us if you ain't down with my click 
 Be on the lookout for them boys with them rags 'round they fo'head, (Uh Oh) 
 Group of muthafuckas that got security hollerin 'Code Red' 
 Get Crunk, Get Buck, y'all pussy bitches get stuck 
 When we come to yo town, tear the fuckin' club up 
 Only white boy with the click, so you know I must be sick 
 You don't like me rollin' wit TRU?, suck my fuckin' dick 
 I'm from that 504, minus 279 
 Come and get you somethin', see me thuggin' in that 225 
 Back 'em up, Get Crunk 
 Back 'em up, Get Buck 
 (Master P) 
 Big Time baller, shot caller, hustler 
 CP3, whodi they'll bust ya 
 Rolce, with 4 doors, Bentleys with mo-mo's 
 I ain't Ludacris but I can throw dem bo's 
 Concerts stay packed, pockets gone stay fat 
 T-R-U hot, tell the DJ's to play that 
 Now give it to me, I want the jewels and the money 
 And ectasy for the thugs and the bunnies 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 We the type of niggas, y'all don't ever wanna have beef wit 
 We'll pull some sneak shit, and get off with some creep shit 
 Do anything for the look, for the stash and the cash 
 My face to recognizable dog, so I'ma need the mask 
 See they didn't want to feel us until we had to empty the cannon 
 Tryna hold us, but they just comin' up, empty handed 
 I know some love us, and I know that some can't stand us 
 Me, P, and C we all thugs, seem like that shit just runs in the family 
 (C-Murder) 
 You know we thugged out, from the cradle to the grave 
 Them TRU Boys, The Miller Boys with T-Bo and some chrome toys 
 Dome checkin', disrespectin haters is a hobby, for life 
 No Limit to the fullest, with a bullet, so think twice 
 Lil Daddy, Limo tints on the Caddy, Truck 
 Them Cutt Boys gone bust, you better duck, 'cause we don't give a fuck 
 I'm real with it, XL bring the Deadly Soundz beat 
 And Watch a nigga like C bring the heat 
 [Chorus] fade until end
