Bra, why you talkin' that shit, huh? 
 (What? you heard me) 
 Take this shit to the streets right now (you heard me) 
 All that yappin' and no action ain't called for, you dig? 
 (For real) (what's happenin') 
 You don't wanna fuck with C (bad motherfuckers) 
 You don't wanna fuck with me (just a bunch of bad motherfuckers) 
 You don't wanna go to war (bunch of bad motherfuckers) 
 (C-Murder) 
 Don't play no games, 'cause boy we be bout killin' 
 You ain't got shit to die for you shouldn't be livin' 
 Get rid the fuckin' smirk ain't a damn thing funny 
 All my niggas know we live for weed and money 
 Platinum and vogues on the walls of my company 
 'Cause TRU niggas live life motherfuckin' G's 
 Presidents and playin' in every resident 
 'Cause pumpin' no limit shit is essential 
 I make money off the words that I speak 
 I flip a cassette like I used to flip a quarter key 
 The rap game is like standin' on a block 
 Every tape I sell is like a motherfuckin' dime rock 
 Give me the money so you can keep the bitches 
 They don't play no game C-Murder bout his riches 
 The money talk and bullshit walks pay to get delt with 
 And haters get they ass kicked 
 Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin' 
 Just a bunch of bad motherfuckers just a bunch of thug niggas 
 Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin' 
 Bunch of bad motherfuckers just a bunch of thug niggas 
 (Mystikal) 
 A whole bunch of bad motherfuckers 
 Ya we bad watch us I ain't playin' with your bitch ass 
 Even if I smoke weed all day drankin' on King Cobra 
 My eyes red my head bad I still fuck over ya 
 You know the name you know the game and the pain 
 Bitches still the same bigger bank higher rank 
 Whatcha thank your head I like your shit don't stank 
 But you're gettin' spanked I'm gonna get at yours forgot that thank 
 You bitch who wrong move I'm gone get you

 Fuck what your friend do and who you came to 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 We bout murder money weed ammunition guns and drugs 
 Fake niggas stand correct show my real niggas some love 
 Mrs. Thug I live the life of a motherfuckin' thug 
 7 digits bigger niggas still fightin' in clubs 
 You think you saw the worst bitch the worst is yet to fuckin' come 
 Up jump and take everyone and your best to fucking run 
 Shoot first ask questions later 
 Quick before I lose ya ask what time it fuckin' was 
 I guess when you're too paranoid smokin' too much motherfuckin' bud 
 Don't play no games bitch respect the name bitch 
 Fuck who you came with and fuck what you sayin' bitch 
 You heard of Mystikal, heard of P, heard of me, and heard of C 
 Either we solo or we ridin' thirty-d you can't stop me I know 
 All they can do is watch me drop ya with your eyes closed 
 In a project curb apartment motherfuckin' dealin' 
 You wanna know why we ain't smilin' 'cause we thugs we mugs 
 Ain't nothin' bout being friendly
