Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies 
 Because I'm true to the game 
 Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours 
 It's got me knocking on heaven's door 
 Feel My Pain (x2) 
 I lost something in the past that was special to me 
 You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep 
 So give love to your motherfucking thugs alive cause 
 Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die 
 Don't point the finger and critisize what he did 
 Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid 
 Will I ever see my brother again time will tell 
 I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell 
 I turned on the radio to forget the fun tears 
 Coming out my eyes 'cause I hear I miss my homies 
 On top of that my court dates tomorrow 
 Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow 
 Baby momma don't want me to leave my kids 
 We can move to the country and forget what I did 
 But reality keep tellin' me that ain't cool 
 I wanna see my kids go to school 
 Feel My Pain 
 Nobody knows when your time gone come 
 I live life to the fullest, True niggas don't run 
 Anticipating your death make you soft and sick 
 I leave my worries at home when I'm hanging with my clique 
 I remenise about all my niggas that's dead 
 A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave 
 It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha 
 'Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya 
 Bulletproof with AK's with hundred round drums 
 Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome 
 That's why I value nothin' but family and friends 
 You lose material shit you can get it again 
 But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper 
 I done lost to many thugs to the permanent sleeper 
 Cause ah everyday a nigger taking a chance 
 Only thug niggas feel my pain (feel my pain) 
 Well uh my brother dead I can't believe this Oh MY GOD
