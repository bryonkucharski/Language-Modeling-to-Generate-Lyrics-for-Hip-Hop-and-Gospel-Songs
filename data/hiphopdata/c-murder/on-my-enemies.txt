Put your guns up and show love 
 To one of the greatest niggas in the game 
 Tupac Shakur 
 This my one time tribute 
 You can tell by the hate in my eyes 
 That I'ma ride till the day that I die 
 (When we ride on my enemies) 
 I bet you motherfuckers die when we ride, on my enemies 
 Got some static with some niggas 
 On the other side of town 
 And my big brother Kev' 
 Yo, he's a rider now 
 What they want from us motherfuckin' TRU niggas 
 'Cause we cool niggas, now we do niggas 
 And move niggas 
 Am I wrong? Fools makin' songs 
 Tryin' to sound like us 
 Must we go on on that herone 
 In the south I trust 
 Till I'm out that bus 
 Then they die when the sun come 
 Tryin' to bite lightnin' of the sky 
 How many cry? 
 Heard the industry was tryin' to finish me 
 Look bitch, I got your drink 
 It ain't no motherfuckin' henisey 
 Then I wastched them playa haters die slow 
 Eliminate all you bitches on my motherfuckin' stage show 
 Glanced at my calacos 
 Time to exterminate my foes 
 I can't stand you hoes 
 Remember this as a bitch slap 
 My lyrics runnin', all you cowards out of gangsta rap 
 When we ride on my enemies 
 You can tell by the hate in my eyes 
 That I'm a Soldier till the day that I die 
 (When we ride, when we ride on my enemies) 
 I bet you motherfuckers die when we ride on my enemies 
 Come take a journey to the Southside 
 You can play the game, don't explain nigga time to die 
 Now say goodbye 
 Watch my eyes when I squeeze the trigger 
 So right before you die 
 You cry in front a bigger figure 
 Now dry your eyes 
 You was a gangsta when I couldn't get ya 
 But now I'm free 
 You got a hundred motherfuckers with ya (Hey) 
 Pay attention, all you carbon copies 
 You hella slopy 
 And you mad cause the world jock me 
 Ya never knock me 
 How you fake motherfuckers heat it 
 Like you in Hell 
 Dumb niggas barely breathin' cause you see me livin' well 
 (Hell) 
 Now you don't really wanna be involved 
 'Cause when I bust 
 You better trust I'm killin' all of y'all 
 Then ball, and tell the witness 
 Keep they mouth closed 
 Fuck around and get splanked 
 By my motherfuckin' Tank Dogs 
 Before I go make sure everybody heard 
 Yo I meant every motherfuckin' word 
 When we ride on my enemies 
 (Overlapping chorus) 
 Rest in peace Tupac Shakur 
 One of the realest, most illest 
 Made motherfuckin' niggas in the game 
 Or the rap industry, nigga 
 Much love 
 Thank you for that gangsta ass music you gave us nigga 
 We gonna ride to that shit all the time 
 Cause, uh, wasn't nobody really fuckin' with ya 
 'Cause they knew one thing 
 You was gonna ride on 'em 
 Ride on your motherfuckin' enemies 
 By any means necessary nigga 
 Ya heard me? 
 Retaliation is necessary 
 No Limit, for life 
 For the realest 
 Fuck the illest 
 Peace
