(C-Murder) 
 Let me see them 3's, put 'em up 
 This for all my lil' soldiers out there stuck in the world 
 Or put in a situation (situation) where they didn't have a choice 
 (Fuck the world nigga you got a choice) 
 On whether they wanted to be there or not 
 In the ghetto it's kill or be killed, in a place called the street 
 (Ya heard me?) 
 Chorus: C-Murder 
 It's been a long time since a nigga showed me love 
 I'ma make it - even if I have to spill a nigga blood 
 It's been a long time since a nigga showed me love 
 But I'ma make it even if I have to spill a nigga blood 
 (C-Murder) 
 I'm trapped in crime, I'm pushin nickels and dimes 
 And will I lose my mind, or am I wastin my time? 
 I'm breakin bread, on the block, with them thugs no love 
 Fresh out of jail, hard to kill, took two shots and lived 
 It ain't my time, I asked the Lord, to put the reaper on hold 
 I know my soul is kinda cold, pops told me to be bold 
 And I'm a grown man, protected by my set and my weapon 
 Ain't no regrettin, earnin stripes, from them niggaz I'm checkin' 
 Them 15's, layin laws like the man, callin shots 
 Holdin' meetings on the block a young nigga at the top 
 And will I make it, out the ghetto, fuck the future 'cause I'm usedta 
 Doin' what I'm doin' right now, and this shit will never stop 
 (C-Murder) 
 Two years I'm locked up like a BITCH I'm boxed up 
 Hard times got me trapped nigga, I shoulda BEEN put them rocks up 
 But it's the code of the ghetto, hold your own take care of your moms 
 By any means stack yo' chips, if it's illegal nigga don't trip 
 They're dead, ya heard me nigga serve me don't be like no busta 
 These streets don't love ya and uh I really don't trust ya 
 Make a move fool you choose, you gotta pay your own dues 
 And all them gold teeth and tattoos, them ain't nuttin but clues nigga 
 I'ma menace to society, I slang dope, in varieties 
 Be like A.J., come take a ride, what you see is what you get nigga 
 You creep or you sleep, but me, I'm packin my heat 
 Cause real life ain't on TV nigga, real life is on the street beotch 
 (C-Murder) 
 It's been a long motherfuckin time since a nigga showed me love 
 C-Murder, C-P-3-killer 
 Projects the cold hearted streets of New Orleans 
 The infamous ghetto, young niggaz, will age well 
 Streets got me crazy, will I die I don't know 
 It's war crimes baby, takin' over the world 
 Put in a situation, forced to, handle your business 
 Handle your own hold your own boy that's the code of the ghetto 
 Will I die I don't know baby 
 It ain't up to me it's up to that man upstairs 
 So I just say to all the young niggaz out there 
 Goin' through what I went through, there's a way out 
 So keep your head high 
 And keep your heat low, ya heard me?
