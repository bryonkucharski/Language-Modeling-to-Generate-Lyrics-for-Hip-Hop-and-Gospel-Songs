(C-Murder) 
 Say Magic, remember that nigga QB from uh Life or Death 
 That commercial we did for a nigga 
 First appearance as a No Limit Soldier 
 But it's number two nigga check it out 
 You can't hold me back 
 Only real niggas feel this 
 Nigga feel this 
 Bitch niggas can't feel this 
 Feel this 
 (QB) 
 This for the niggas under estimated, mad style, mad created 
 Fuck all them niggas that playa haters 
 Send out dippin' spirit shit, what's wrong, I hearin' shit 
 When I jump on the song, it's straight lyrics bitch 
 My first appearance was on Life or Death 
 It's hard to mantain in this game but I still caught this much respect 
 I waiting a long line, no with no wit' 
 I didn't pick up no hands got me some ki's and I made a hit 
 Y'all niggas mad 'cause I'm nation wide 
 You besta realize I have a style 
 Nigga don't be surprised 
 There's not no party 
 I'm coming with dope shit regardless 
 Coming with a weak hit nigga hardly 
 And when you rich bitch niggas talk 
 And when you broke bitches yap 
 A automatic go off full track 
 A future pay nigga, a made nigga 
 Not a day nigga, a fair nigga, fair nigga 
 (C-Murder) 
 Nigga that's part two to the motherfuckin' ???

 That shit comin' out soon 
 No Limit family, ??? motherfucker 
 Peace
