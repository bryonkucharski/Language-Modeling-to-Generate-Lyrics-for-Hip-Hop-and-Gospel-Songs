This be the truest shit I ever said 
 A nigga might wind up dead 
 With money comes bad times 
 These days you got to have a strong mind 
 I grew up as a motherfucken thug 
 An outkast couldn't do shit but slang drugs 
 In and out of jail ain't no place to be 
 I'm not short dog but I just want to be free 
 Made a lot of money do dirt pulling capers 
 Don't give a fuck who I hurt 
 You wonder why a nigga can't sleep man 
 Because I got the blood of my dead brother on my hand 
 A true nigga can't rest g 
 Till these bitch ass get the fuck from around me 
 You sweat the tank but your not a real soldier 
 Would you die for this shit "no" P I told ya 
 Your true to the game but your ain't true to me 
 Nigga be yourself you can't be me or P 
 My veins pump no limit blood from day one nigga 
 Ask Big Ed he put it on his only son 
 I got a few niggas want me dead 
 Anticipating my death for the shit I said 
 Huh true soldiers true niggas 
 Motherfucking blood true love thugg figues 
 Bitch niggas be plotting on me 
 Behind close doors niggas hola when you see me 
 P said if you going to get'em 
 Get'em shoot first and make sure you hit em 
 I can't lose another tank dog 
 One more dead and watch no limit go off 
 Y'all ain't ready for war 
 I leave niggas tripping off the shit that they saw 
 I known for taking niggas out in street murder one 
 Muthafucker check my rap sheet 
 I thank P for taking me out the game 
 Put the mike in my hand and gave me my name
