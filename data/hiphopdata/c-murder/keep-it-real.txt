 We seek a women she gonna have ta play tha game 
 I play tha game raw, I used ta hustle outside 
 In tha cut, bundle outside at 2B, thirty five 
 An if tha flash lights pass on my block I ball block 
 Ain't no pity in my city when my dawgs be actin' shitty 
 Bloom bloom pernt blank, we hitcha wit tha head shot 
 Hero, he's not 'cause he just got a fed spot 
 Homicide on my trail (on my trail) 'cause I'm sleepin' by my antee 
 Them niggas wanna thank me

 Lets keep it real 
 You want my money or you want to chill 
 (C-Murder)

 Drop a heater on a cot and get tha chronic out tha box
