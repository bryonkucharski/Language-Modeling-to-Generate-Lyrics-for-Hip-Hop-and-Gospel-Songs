(C-Murder) 
 How many of my TRU niggas actually get a second chance at life, 
 At their dreams? not many, huh 
 Started off as a street thug, just hangin' and thuggin' 
 '89 went to jail for druggin' and muggin' 
 Poppin' plea's ain't no fuckin' way for me 
 Porbation for 10 years don't mean you're free 
 I know my TRU motherfuckin' niggas know how I feel 
 This shit's real I wish my brother wouldn't of got killed 
 For me to realize the game is wicked 
 Shit can't even trust the niggas that I used to hang with 
 Huh, but I remember what my brother told me 
 I know a real bitch by the way she hold me 
 I love my TRU niggas like I love money 
 If you fuck with no limit you never find nothin' funny 
 And I take it to the grave with me 
 If you shoot first bitch you better make sure you hit me 
 'Cause I'm known for choppin' keys on my mom's table 
 I split a hundred G's with my niggas Kane and Abel 
 Fast money fast bitches is what I live for 
 Until I caught a fuckin' bullet in the back, bra 
 They thought I was dead but I'm still in it 
 I'm back to life back on top ain't no limit 
 Back to life (from the cradle to the grave) 
 Back to reality (some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid) 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Just some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid 
 Back to life (from the cradle to the grave) 
 Back to reality (some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid) 
 (Master P) 
 Tattoo hennessy and weed 
 Grew up in the project with killers and G's 
 The Last Don is known for slangin' and bangin' 
 Thug niggas 3rd ward Cali know where we hangin' 
 Ghetto's soldiers mercenary we rhyme 
 This game is life or death and it's your soul or mine 
 We don't play no games boy just tryin' get paid 
 Hope I get rich before they dig my grave 
 So many penetentary chances feds and demons 
 So many homies in the ghetto with their soul in strim 
 In god we trust ain't no man gone harm me 
 My best friend be my lady 'cause these fools are fonies 
 Take heed I been beyond and back 
 I live my life through the lord, my homey, the greed and the back 
 I said: (Ughhhhhhh) 
 Back to life (from the cradle to the grave) 
 Back to reality (some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid) 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Just some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 You couldn't tell me nutin' 
 A little ghetto child runnin' wild 
 Shed tears trough years made it hard to smile 
 Imagine homies dying while you're standin' right there 
 My reality's your worst nightmare 
 And now I'm trapped in the whole fuckin' world of sin 
 Kill or be killed hit down by the hands of his best friend 
 You gotta know if you wanna live there's rules to this shit 
 You can't break 'em if you wanna be rich 
 And when my homey died and didn't come back 
 I knew it was on nigga stressed god blessed 
 Got his name on a tombstone 
 Some of my prayers go out to my homies that walked that path 
 I spray paint your name on the wall and I sit back and laugh 
 You gotta make decisions make 'em all with precision 
 Try to make moves and avoid prison 
 I remember the first time I laughed at the penetentary steel 
 When the told me spread lift the car I knew it was real 
 Now I was just out there tryin' gain some strength 
 Birds came to me one night told me Silkk you gotta change your life 
 But it was all or nothin' could never settle for second 
 Gotta make the whole world feel my presence (Ughhhhh) 
 I told my homey don't cry if I close my eyes, 
 (But Silkk the Shocker you too young to die) 
 Back to life (from the cradle to the grave) 
 Back to reality (some younsters on the streets tryin' get paid) 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Just some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid 
 Back to life (from the cradle to the grave) 
 Back to reality (just some younsters on the streets tryin' get paid) 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Just some youngsters on the streets tryin' get paid
