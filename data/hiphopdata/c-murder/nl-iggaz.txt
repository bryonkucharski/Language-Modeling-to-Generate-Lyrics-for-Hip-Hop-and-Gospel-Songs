 Nigga, nigga I'mma rider never gave a fuck about the other side 
 Me and my niggas we love to get high 
 An break the rules 
 Like fools on a mission 'cause we thugged out and trapped 
 I only give my real niggas dap 
 Me and my click is so close it's fucked up 
 My nigga Nu got drunk and yet we all throwed up 
 An showed up ready to blow some shit up like Castro 
 These niggas bout to straight get plucked

 Pull out the Porsh chicks run to the car 
 Blow my smoke to the sky blazin' dutches cigars 
 I got the street in my veins my block runs through my blood 
 Plead guilty to tha charges when I'm facin' the judge 
 Fuck it I'll do the sentence lift weights and read books 
 Make me a millionaire in jail wit a mill on my books 
 Only understand crooks y'all niggas is suckers 
 I'm in a booth waitin' for a CEO to front us 
 I got the hood relyin' on me not to mention myself 
 So if the drug game dead I can rely on my wealth 
 Nine outta ten niggas is haters I'm the other one 
 Like startin' fires that blazes and stackin' my funds

 Uh hu I bet y'all love the way I flips em' out 
 Funny guy hu now watch how these clips come out 
 I done took it where y'all can't go now how bout that 
 I done turned these straight up niggas into stumblin' cats 
 An they mad at me 'cause they say I spit it to rough 
 An throw it at you like a chick who don't get it enough 
 What is it X-ray vision the way I see through this cats 
 That's why I roll wit thugs who love the squeeze them mac's 
 Remember back till when we hid them stacks in alley ways 
 Now we keep that dough comin' and goin' like holiday's
