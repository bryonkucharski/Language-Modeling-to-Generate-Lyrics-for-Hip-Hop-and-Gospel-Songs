Sittin' here in the belly of the beast (belly of the beast) 
 C-Murder (Momma grieve for your baby)*in the background repeated 
 Trapped in crime behind bars (T-R-U) 
 I'm locked up, ain't no love 
 They won't let me out 
 Think they testin me (this world's so sure) 
 Check this out 
 Incarcerated, eliminated I sure hate it 
 It's hard labour for life that's what the judge stated 
 Dieg trippin' and shady I think he wanna kill me 
 Talk to my cell every time I'm mad I know he feel me but baby 
 I moved on you can keep the pictures 
 That's my girl she left me she ain't keep it real wit me 
 Now I'm stressin I need a victim so I can hit him 
 And 30 days in the hole is cold, but watch me ride wit him

 Why do what I do? 
 The freedom ain't gettin' no closer (closer) 
 No matter how far I go

 The cops patrollin (patrollin) 
 Now that ain't stopped me and I get 
 Locked up

 I'm locked up but they can't stop us 
 Some more visits and ripe chickens across the border 
 What's your number I'm hurtin' let me get a money boarder? 
 I owe my lawyer some change now he might drop the case 
 Now if my player don't shake it I might hop the gate 
 Starin' at these walls I'm fallin' he set my court date back 
 Payback when I shake back and cop a mate back 
 I'm eatin things and lusting on kings, magazines 
 It seems, I'm home free but it was just dream, damn

 Visitation no longer comes by (comes by) 
 Seems like they forgot about me (about me) 
 Commissary is gettin' empty (empty) 
 Cell mates eatin food without me (without me) 
 Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life (move on with my life) 
 Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
 But instead I get locked up 
 I'm spreadin my gangs 'cause I'm straight done in like a gangbanger 
 Don't play no games and mess around and get shanked with the hanger 
 That's how I'm comin' and I do my dirt and stick and move 
 Tears tattoed a head busta walkin' in these shoes 
 Snitches workin with the Warden 
 Eyes open and scopin and these humps I'm smokin', got my lungs chokin 
 I'm the big dog on the blocks, I got 2-for-1's 
 And 21 (5) with a L I'm hopeless son I'm locked up
