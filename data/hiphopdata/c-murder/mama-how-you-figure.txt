Cut ya speaka's up 
 Come check out that gutta music 
 Rough, Rugged, Raw Uncut 
 Where you at Los? (It's Murda) 
 Mama how you figure 
 I'm a nigga destined for pain 
 Ms. Peaches (You Ain't never gonna change) 
 Up early in the mornin' 
 Runnin' out the crack house 
 The Grimm Reaper, tried to blow my back out 
 (You feel me) 
 Is there a Heaven for a Thug with Thug ways 
 I'm searchin' for some better days 
 Pappa was a Rollin' Stone, Pappa wasn't home 
 Me, moms and the kids stuck at home 
 I said fuck that, I'mma get paid 
 I'mma get me a ticket to the streets 
 And work my way to a Key 
 'Cause I'ma HUSTLA, JACK OF THE JACKA'S 
 Make moves with Thugs 
 Make moves where niggas show me love 
 I'm from NEW ORLEANS, where we be ballin' 
 Listen to the lyrics boy 
 The streets be callin' 
 Some on the set tryin' to set me up and wet me up 
 But these days I be's like I don't give a fuck 
 We can all get buck, that's my mentallity 
 I'll bring you back to reality (Hey) 
 Keep it on the low-low 
 Pass me the dow-dow 
 Disrespect boy, that's a no-no 
 I see through you 
 You use to be TRU to 
 TRU to you but never TRU to TRU 
 Keep it real, guard yo grill 
 I do em' like Mike Vick 
 I'm on some Bout It, Bout It shit 
 I got a rowdy, rowdy clique 
 I'm stuck in the game, deep in the game 
 Fuck Fame, I Ain't Never Gone Change. 
 Mama how you figure 
 I'm a nigga destined for pain 
 Ms. Peaches (You Ain't never gonna change) 
 My future's gettin' dem 
 My chances gettin' slim 
 I'm steady rappin' 
 And they (steady attackin') 
 Will I forever be behind bars, Lookin' out the window 
 I'm thikin' bout my kinfolk 
 I'm in the Courthouse, Starin' at the D.A. 
 Lookin' for some leadway, lookin' for a free day 
 But the color of my skin, really did me in 
 But I'm still proud 
 To be the black man standin' in the croud 
 I REPRESENT THAT, whom never resent that 
 You could put a needle in my arm 
 And life still goes on 
 I be's a TRU nigga, till I'm dead 
 Even with the police and they money on my head 
 I be duckin' from the FED's 
 They be trippin' on my lady 
 Takin' pictures of my bed and the way I lay my head 
 Did you heard what I said?! 
 The game ain't the same no more 
 Nigga's done changed 
 Ya best friend a bust ya brains 
 Or they'll take a stand 
 To lessin' they charge boy 
 If that's ya fall partner 
 You gone fall partner 
 It's coo Playboy, I Feel Ya Pain 
 I'm still in chains 
 And I STILL DIDN'T CHANGE 
 But they don't here me though... 
 Mama how you figure 
 I'm a nigga destined for pain 
 Ms. Peaches (You Ain't never gonna change) 
 Ms. Peaches 
 Somebody tell me why, why they wanna take my place 
 'Cause he ain't never, never gonnna chaaannge...
