Bob ya head to this 
 Bob yo head to that 
 They say I'm crazy 
 But they can't faze me 
 Them chicks be lovin' me 
 'Cause I be thuggin' see 
 I'm just a Cut Boy 
 I hang in the Cut Boy 
 I test em' up Boy 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck Boy 
 Now, Back the fuck up 
 Throw ya hood up 
 Back the fuck up 
 Now nigga what 
 I ain't trippin' 
 Naw, nigga never 
 Any kind of weather 
 Wind or whatever 
 I'm way too clever 
 Status too lifted 
 Talented and gifted 
 You tossed it, I pitch it 
 A hog in the dog 
 Ball, fall and ball 
 I touch all of y'all 
 Duck off in the fog 
 Sippin', a lil' tipsy, like Nipsy 
 Fortune Teller said it look bad 
 She was a Gypsy 
 Mean like Feind 
 A gangsta, Nawha mean? 
 Underground, tell I'm Under the ground 
 XL:(Keep The MainStream) 
 Pistol packin', Totin', Smokin' 
 Cuttin', Throatin', Soldier 
 I told ya, back up Rova, It's over 
 They say I'm crazy (Uh Huh) 
 But they can't faze me (Fa Sho) 
 Them chicks be lovin' me (Keep it real) 
 'Cause I be thuggin' see (Wile Out) 
 I'm just a Cut Boy (What ya do) 
 I hang in the Cut Boy (Them what) 
 I test em' up Boy (Yeah) 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck Boy 
 Watch me 
 Flippa, Flippa 
 Treat em' like a doubie 
 Rollit and spin it fast 
 Just like a Oozie 
 Ain't gone let it Blues me 
 Let nothin' get to me 
 Come back hard and star in my own Movie 
 If ya think ya know me Man 
 You don't know me 
 I done seen it all, And done it all 
 Ain't nothin' you can show me 
 I roll with high rollers 
 And Purser Snatcha's 
 Cut Boys, homie that still cause throwbacka's 
 B.G. skeeza's that count cheese and hold Keys 
 Screamin' C, Please let me see ya enemies 
 I keep it real like Murda Dog and Black Dog 
 I'm attack dog, waitin' to jack and whack y'all 
 Ridin' down the wrong way 
 Down a one way on a Sunday 
 With a A.K., with the Bass Hay (Hey!) 
 Wildin' Out, Wildin' Out boy 
 With a pocket full of stones 
 I'm in the zone 
 Do the Gangsta Walk (O.K) 
 Do the Gangsta Bounce (All right) 
 Now show ya Gold's boy 
 Mean Mug that fool 
 Now show ya Gold's boy 
 (Ooks 1 and 2) 
 XL: 
 Once again, you have been listening to 
 An XL and C-Murder collaboration

 I could hook him up, ya heard me 
 Holla, Holla...(Fade Out)
