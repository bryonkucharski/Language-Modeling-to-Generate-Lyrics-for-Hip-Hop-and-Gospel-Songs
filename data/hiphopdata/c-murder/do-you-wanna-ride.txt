(Slay Sean) 
 How many wanna play now? It get dark wit the shades 
 Down, you know Slay and Black paid now 
 Niggas, see we be thugged out, 2 deep 
 Muthafuckas betta stay out the way now, that foolishness 
 I'm tellin' you yo crew could get hit wit dem tools and clips 
 Fuck who you get, you and that fool you wit, gone get yo wig split 
 Black guns, me and my doggs clap guns, don't be thinkin' we jus rappin' 
 You saw what would happen, gun blastin 
 Squeezin off till I'm the last one 
 You gone ride - Take It Outside 
 You gone die - Take It Outside 
 You gone cry - Take It Outside 
 Take It Outside, Take It Outside 
 (C-Murder) 
 Now if you wanna ride or die, then try 
 But let me get high so that my mind can fly 
 Because I'm just that kinda guy, people wonder why 
 I'm so violent, because the N.L. move in silent 
 In other words, I creep creep, put you to sleep sleep 
 187 will be yo last beep beep 
 I bring that N.O. heat heat, to the streeets 
 Toe tag yo feet, yo feet 
 I treat ya like a prostitute, and fuck ya up 
 A roughneck nigga that'll ruff ya up 
 Like a quick car wash, I'll touch ya up 
 'Cause I look at y'all like sittin' ducks 
 Boy don't you understand that I'm the man 
 Wit the plan, wit beacoup benjamins and alotta ghetto fans 
 At first you was tellin' me to keep it trill 
 But now they know T-R-U is real 
 One hundred and eighty seven percent 
 I remember when my pockes were full of lent 
 All my real niggas like next to kin 
 So testin me is like testin them, now what! 
 I guess it's buck y'all time 
 I guess it's time for the second line 
 My last CD was "Trapped in Crime" 
 So you already know what's on my mind 
 (Black Felon) 
 What What 
 Say I had 16 bars 
 How many muthafuckas can drive 16 cars 
 Go up in the club, thuggin', and pull 16 broads 
 Take 'em home, and fuck 'em all in 16 minutes 
 (Haha they don't know) 
 Muthafuckas you ain't heard of me, Alotta them niggas 
 From Desire be, on the side of N-O L-I-M-I-T 
 Or T-R-U, wit Slay Sean and C, peep game dude 
 Who can spit it better than me? 
 Ever seen a nigga chest blown (chest blown) 
 Eventhough he gotta vest on (vest on) 
 Nigga walk up to yo dogg witta dress on 
 And start spittin' some shit, that'll split you at the 
 Chest bone (chest bone) 
 You fuckin' wit the wrong click 
 We gotta army of niggas who don't give a fuck who u 
 Run wit bitch, get cha wig split 
 Think it's a game, but it ain't, Black Felon, Slay 
 Sean, and C 
 Bustin' on some of that T-R-U shit 
 (Traci) 
 Nigga take it outside, I was born to represent 
 Tru niggas gotta keep it thugged to roll wit this chick 
 Catch me in the cut, G' Nikes, bandana'd up 
 Mean mug on my grill, Like I don't give a fuck 
 Who want what, they get stuck 
 I don't play around, in the back akin buck wit both 
 Arms up, and around my hand, Tru Records wristband 
 Understand the game cold but got colder when it met me 
 I came to put it down, put ya face where ya chest be 
 And I don't run, it's the same place where you met me 
 Slay Sean, Black, and C my click, so don't sweat me 
 I get up in yo face, nigga, so don't test me 
 Hard to get at me, but try ya luck 
 I make niggas stutter and I leave 'em stuck 
 When this track come on, watch 'em all get buck 
 Traci just represented is you warin or what?
