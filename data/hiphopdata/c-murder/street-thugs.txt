 Title: Street Thugs 
 Feat. Magic, New-9 
 (C-Murder) 
 I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes 
 A million dollars in the safe but it's drug money 
 Some niggas died so some of that shit's blood money 
 An no regrets I spend my cheddar wit a smile 
 I'm buckwild like a muthafuckin' juvenile 
 Incarcerate me reabilitate me in the pen 
 An fuck tha world my own momma turned me in 
 These muthafuckas got the whole game fucked up 
 I got them golds & a rag now they bucked up 
 I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes 
 I flipped tha game on em' now the whole block's mine 
 These niggas know my trigga finger ain't nothin' nice 
 'Cause I'm droppin' fools so them niggas think twice 
 (Chorus: C-Murder & (Magic) 
 I got them golds & a rag now they bucked up 
 I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes (we muthafuckin ballers) 
 I got them golds & a rag now they bucked up 
 I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes (ballers) 
 (New-9) 
 Down for my man Dolla Bill it's bout that time 
 Post bail half step shit I'm bustin' for mine 
 Bustin' rhymes for mine 
 Doin' crimes for mine 
 Get in tha way you'll be layin' in that pond for mine 
 Boy I'm slangin' that nine killa just ask the police, 
 Tha Feds, tha ATF man they all know me 
 I ain't trippin' off no muthafuckin' nigga on the street 
 Marchin' on yo block and we ain't scampin' our feet 
 See I'mma ball till I fall nigga 
 From tha blocks to tha burbs 
 Rocks tha word same nigga street hustler multitalent 
 I give a damn if you then crossed our path 
 An you think you cand handle it glock busters 
 (Magic) 
 I'mma ball nigga 
 You seen me in tha mall hollerin' at them broads nigga 
 Wit my back against the muthafuckin wall nigga 
 Magic in mack mode 
 I'mma fool nigga pimpin' tha tightest hoes 
 Spendin' cash like I'm sittin' on a couple of mills 
 Wit all my bitches in line them hoes payin' my bills 
 They respect this 
 Ain't tryin' to see me pissed 
 'Cause I'll send em' to bed without this Magic dick 
 Don't give a fuck about a nigga 
 I figured you niggas don't wanna see this nigga ball 
 Y'all wanna see me fall 
 But I'm the shit nigga 
 Just look at the crowd go wild when I spit nigga 
 An that's the real 'cause we muthafuckin' ballers
