Too much noise in my ears to think 
 And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink 
 I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank 
 I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank 
 (Krazy) 
 I need some hennessey with my weed so I can get high 
 Man feel this shit I'm sayin' to you nigga, this ain't no lie 
 To much motherfuckin noise in my ears to write a verse, 
 Now give me the weed to hit so I can break this curse 
 This world got me stressed out, that's why I'm always in the bottle, 
 I hit the hen, that shit ain't worth my motherfuckin problem 
 Haters hate to see a nigga come up 
 So if see my enemy, I'm gonna through my gun up 
 These hoes need to understand dick ain't bout' no game, 
 That's why I only fuck with bitches who got a man 
 Cause pussy bad for you, have a nigga dying in lust 
 Can't get enough of them guts, that's why they fucked up and out of luck 
 (Master P) 
 Seee, soldiers is some niggas you don't wanna try 
 Run up on the tank, and get touched, then we ride 
 I got blood on my hands and I loved to get my dick wet 
 And I think about the pussy, now blood only coats that 
 Bitches think I'm nasty cause' I love to get my dick sucked, 
 Two gaurds to the head, before I fuckin' rip them guts up 
 Now look at that beem on your shirt, it's probably red, 
 And you know I get off, just to know that you dead 
 I got problems on my mind and I probably can't solve 'em 
 But you know how I get em' off, wit 38's that revolve 
 Never bite the hand that feeds me, now that's game to the rollers, 
 And I know y'all niggas mad, cause Snoop Dogg is a soldier 
 (C-Murder) 
 I'm feelin' kind of good my nigga, and smokin' ounces of weed, 
 And plus I'm drinking, and got two bad bitches with me 
 Is it the pussy that I'm gettin' that's got my feelin' so high, 
 Don't ask me why, gettin' blounted is my number one job 
 Is it the ice on my motherfuckin wrist? 
 That's got these dog ass hoes acting like bitches 
 Or mabye it's the 50 g's I spend up on my teeth, 
 Or the fact that no other nigga can rap like me 
 It's too much noise in my ears to think 
 And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink 
 I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank 
 I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank 
 It's too much noise in my ears to think 
 And not enough liquor in my bottle to drink 
 I'm goin' in the pussy and I hope I don't stank 
 I'm suffocatin in you baby, I'm startin to sank
