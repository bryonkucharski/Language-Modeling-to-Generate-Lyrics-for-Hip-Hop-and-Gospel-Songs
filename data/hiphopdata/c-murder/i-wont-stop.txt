1, 2 Gangrel's coming for you 
 Gangrel, can you come out and play? 
 3, 4 better lock your doors 
 Gangrel, can you come out and play? 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I can't stop till I see blood 
 I got that gleam in my eye 
 I'm straight from the grave 
 Dress in all black, I'm looking for a slave 
 Call me the reaper, you won't live to tell 
 Call me Gangrel, I'm straight out of hell 
 I need blood, I'm lookin' for a victim 
 The Brood, I'm with 'em 
 Lets go get 'em 
 Lock up your doors, and throw away the key 
 You can't run from me, look at my teeth 
 I'm sleeping in a casket, and kill at night 
 I know it ain't right, but I hate the sunlight 
 And no you're not dreaming, this is not a nightmare 
 'Cause when you wake up, guess what? 
 I'm still there! 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I can't stop till I see blood 
 You can't see me, not even in the mirror 
 My reflection is dead, you just took your last breath 
 Don't call the police, instead call a coroner 
 Blood got drained out your neck on the corner 
 The sun goes down, the freaks come out 
 We bum rush your city, the Brood with no pity 
 Silver bullets, triggers we pull it 
 Nothin' can save ya, go meet your maker 
 Run and I catch ya, fight and I hit ya 
 Surrender your soul, it's murdered and cold 
 That click with no love 
 You might call us thugs 
 Don't give us no hugs, 'cause we want your blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I won't stop till I see blood 
 I can't stop till I see blood
