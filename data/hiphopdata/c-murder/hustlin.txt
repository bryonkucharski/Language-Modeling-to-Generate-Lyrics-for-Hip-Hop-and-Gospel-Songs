(P talking) 
 "One in a half, two in a half, three in a half, 
 (Four quarters) I think I might have a thousand grams (one key)" 
 (Chorus: singing) 
 Hustlin, hustlin 
 Tryin' to survive in the ghetto ooh oh 
 Hustlin, hustle 
 Tryin' to survive in the ghetto ooh ooh 
 (Master P) 
 (Where them fiends at, I'll be right there in the hall way ya heard me) 
 Now picture me a street nigga went from weed to guns 
 My cousins a dope dealer now it's coke and funds 
 Now with the money comes bitches and with the feds comes snitches 
 I'm just a lil' nigga tryin' to go from rags to riches 
 Cause in the ghetto niggas like to flip fo' & a half 
 The projects is home but the ghetto's my lab 
 Niggas scream third ward nigga we ready to ride 
 Niggas say fuck No Limit then we ready to die 
 Nigga fo' fives and nines we hold them high 
 Lil' niggas whoop whoop hide them pies 
 'Cause if it don't make dollas then it don't make sense 
 An if yo hustle ain't tight nigga you'll end up in the pen 
 (Krazy) 
 What if these mothafuckin' project bricks could talk 
 Would they tell what goes on nigga after dark 
 Bullets spark young homies gettin' blasted 
 Sixteen in a muthafuckin' casket the games drastic 
 Live my life wit my thug soldiers gettin' high 
 Mixin' Hennessy and weed bitch it's do or die 
 When we ride to yo area 
 Tell yo family find where they can bury ya 
 My dawgs carry ah AK's & ski masks 
 If you got ki's then yo niggas better hind yo ass 
 We blast like dope fiends roamin' the block 
 No matter how many niggas get popped drugs'll never stop believe dat 
 (C-Murder) 
 (Check this out playa) 
 Now picture me a TRU nigga thugged out hustlin' hard 
 I hope you niggas understand I could never be soft 
 Cause mentally I'm capable of over comin' the worst 
 I'm havin' flashes picture me in ashes and dirt 
 On a T-shirt a memory a thought of the past 
 I lost my brother to a muthafuckin' gun blast 
 I analyze every nigga watch his moves look in his eyes 
 Cause you can never tell 
 Predicted dead or in jail nigga 
 Now tell me what you see 
 Cause life's so hard for a Callio nigga like me ya dig 
 'Cause I'm gonna hustle till I'm gone 
 Hit the highway and play again it's on in the ghetto 
 (C-Murder)
