(Just rain on me, full as a dam at...) 
 I'm sorry I didn't answer (whoo) 
 I didn't answer 'cause I was busy, what else 
 That's why I didn't answer 
 How about I just call you next time? 
 Why is it that when I don't answer 
 You think I'm with somebody else or something? 
 I don't know 
 Can't get through, I can't get through 
 Got me chasing you, I'm tasting you 
 Got something I want to say to you 
 I'm done playing games with you 
 I'm afraid I already lost you 
 In my car and I'm on my way to you 
 Is that okay with you? 
 I wanna grow grey with you 
 Have a little baby with you 
 And just cater to you 
 Just rain on me, I'll rain on you 
 I'll tell you the lies now, yeah 
 It's okay to cry now, yeah 
 Nothing to hide now, yeah 
 Love on the line now, yeah 
 Let me make it right now, yeah 
 Dry your eyes now, yeah, yeah yeah 
 And I'm hoping we survive now, yeah 
 I got faith, girl, we'll be fine now, yeah 
 True, true, true 
 Oh yeah, yeah 
 What I tell you at 
 It ain't that easy, baby 
 It ain't as easy as you make it seem oh no 
 Hey, baby 
 It's okay to cry, just rain on me, yeah 
 It's okay to cry, just rain on me, yeah
