Ay, yeah 
 I'm not your, your man, baby 
 No, I can't do what a man should be doing for you 
 Trying my best to pull through for you, yeah, yeah 
 Listen, few years we been at it, so much static 
 I been calling you sporadically 
 Same old shit, pack your bags, come lay back with me, ay 
 Last time that we fucked, that shit was cinematic 
 I don't expect for you to settle for me 
 But I hate it when you say to me 
 "You're done playing games with me 
 Done tryna wait for me, still check for me 
 You can't get away from me, yeah, yeah 
 Go tell them you still love me, yeah 
 Don't know it but you're stuck with me, yeah 
 By now you know you're stuck with me, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah" 
 You say I'm talking like I don't wanna wife 
 I just wanna fuck, you damn right 
 Treat you like a queen and like that's just for me, you damn right 
 Girl, you damn right, yeah, right 
 Pull up, at the party with the juice 
 Looked at me like, "Damn boy, you brought everything but the truth" 
 Girl, you used to be cool, that's why I started fucking with you 
 Baby, it feel like the real thing, we used to love without no rules 
 True, tell me when did you get so confused? 
 Who told you I belong to you? 
 I can only be alone with you 
 Never on the road with you 
 Fuck you like you're mine, that's what I'm supposed to do 
 Yeah, just like you're mine 
 You encourage me to do what's right, do what's right 
 Yeah, you say that shit and turn around 
 Hit my line, say, "Come by," fuck on you one more time 
 We both know this ain't one more time 
 We both know, ay 
 I try to play it off like I'll be fine but I won't, I won't, I won't 
 Oh girl, oh baby, baby 
 True
