I had asked myself 
 So, what would you do if she left? 
 What would you do? 
 Would I find someone to distract myself? 
 Detach myself 
 Get my mind off you 
 This is far from the end 
 Got a nigga in a frenzy 
 Only you would understand 
 Oh, when I used to be your man 
 You tell me, tell me 
 Over and over again 
 If it's too much pressure, babe 
 Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby 
 If you gotta question me, babe 
 Think of all I've done for you, baby 
 I said I know that 
 You're going to find someone 
 That's ready for you 
 That teach me a lesson, baby 
 You're gonna find someone who gets it, babe 
 Teach me a lesson, babe 
 Baby, ooh 
 Teach me a lesson, babe 
 Yeah, oh yeah 
 You just left town 
 Yeah, you skated on me 
 Bounce, switch locations on me 
 Can't keep waiting on me 
 Made a mistake, baby 
 Now you're tryna find a replacement for me, babe 
 Oh, hold up 
 Why we broke up 
 Guess I don't know, love? 
 Guess I don't know 
 Baby, I had to grow up 
 I don't want you with no one 
 No one, yeah 
 If it's too much pressure, babe 
 Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby 
 If you gotta question me, babe 
 Think of all I've done for you, baby 
 I said I know that 
 You're going to find someone 
 That's ready for you 
 Teach me a lesson, baby 
 Teach me, baby 
 You're going to find someone 
 Who gets it, babe 
 Teach me a lesson, baby 
 Oh no no no
