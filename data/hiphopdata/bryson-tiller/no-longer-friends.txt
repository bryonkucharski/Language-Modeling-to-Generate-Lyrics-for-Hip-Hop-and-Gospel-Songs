Hi, aight, whatever, you doing too much 
 You doing too much 
 Ay 
 Let's go back to the time when your nigga used to trip 
 'Bout the time we spent, girl, when we were just friends 
 It was all friendly on my end 
 Even though I look forward to seeing you again like, uh 
 When am I seeing you again? 
 Ay, when are we speaking again? 
 Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin 
 Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah 
 No, he don't like it, call me up 
 He don't like it 
 This was the perfect timing 
 Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah 
 Talk about you like a queen make him madder 
 As if he never even mattered 
 And you a bad bitch, you keep getting badder 
 This ain't the side nigga anthem 
 I've been straight forward, he's going backwards 
 Relax, yo, just chill 
 I love you, I'm with you 
 I ain't with this nigga 
 You don't think I... 
 My best friend, he's my brother 
 My brother 
 I don't think he's your brother 
 That's your blood? 
 You got the same mom and daddy? 
 Aight 
 You fucking that nigga, that's what it is 
 I'm fucking my brother? That's my brother 
 No, no, if y'all ain't got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck 
 You fuckin' him 
 You was on the verge of losing her 
 You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her 
 I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her 
 That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her 
 She really the shit, I don't be juicing her 
 I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her 
 I feel like I'm sewn on ya 
 I feel like you grew on me 
 Have I grown on you? 
 Done fronting like I don't want you 
 Keep treating me like I don't know you 
 Back and forth between me and all your niggas 
 You're busy tonight, that figures 
 Tonight you're staying in his city 
 And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all 
 But I want that too, that's all 
 I need the same in return, that's all 
 That's all 
 That's all I want, all I want, all I want 
 That's all I want, all I want, yeah 
 All I want (just a, just a little time)
