Now's the time to just clear the air 
 Put this shit back in motion 
 Put this shit back in motion 
 Now you finally open, I'm just tryna be only 
 We been ashin' our roaches 
 Throw them shits in a bowl and (smoke that shit up) 
 Rollin' one and mow, now we fired up 
 Now we both lookin' high as fuck 
 I been waitin', but time is up 
 You ain't look me in the eye once 
 Fuck it, out you in 5 months 
 You ain't gotta be shy girl if... 
 Hol' up 
 You don't know how much 
 You've helped me grow, you've helped me grow, baby, yeah 
 You don't know how much I've been tryna show you 
 I know you failed me though 
 Ooh, girl I saw this comin' 
 Don't wanna act all nonchalant, that would mean 
 That everything we talked about was all for nothin' 
 Oh, girl, you know I've been sufferin' 
 Mmm, hmmm, mmm 
 Mmm, hmmm, mmm 
 Baby I've been sufferin', does that mean nothin'? 
 That's gotta mean somethin' 
 Baby I would go insane for your love 
 Fuck what your friends say, girl that's gotta mean somethin' 
 This became a little bit too much 
 Gotta watch my intake, that's gotta mean somethin' 
 (This how it goin', put that shit back in motion) 
 Gotta mean somethin' 
 (Now I got your legs open) 
 (Promise everything gonna be kosher)
