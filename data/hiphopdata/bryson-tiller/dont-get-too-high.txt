Hey 
 Yeah 
 Back again with the 
 Them cuffin' season tunes 
 Hey 
 Hey, you 
 Okay, spend too much time with your friends 
 Too much time with your friends 
 Turned up at the function 
 You could barely function 
 Oh, you getting drunk and too high to call me up, and 
 Hanging with them other niggas, I could barely stomach 
 Oh, you telling me the shit you used to put up with 
 You ain't go through that twice, okay 
 I'ma come through, spend the night, okay 
 1300 on the flight, okay 
 Love, you can't put a price on it 
 Something came up, girl, I know it 
 You ain't never got time for me 
 'Cause you spend too much time with your friends, fuck y'all doing? Hey 
 Spending money on strip clubs and drugs, I knew it 
 Damn shawty, you know love ain't the same way I do it 
 I'm the only drug you need to get you through it 
 I always tell you don't get too high 
 Don't drink too much, don't smoke too much 
 Tell me if it's cool if I come by and keep you up 
 I show you love, I show you love 
 Girl, I'm not trying to kill your vibe, kill your buzz 
 I ain't tryna' sober you up 
 Girl, I'm just trying to be by your side 
 And be the one you see first whenever you woke up 
 Woah, you make me feel how I make other bitches feel 
 Like you be cool without or with me here 
 Stuck in Miami, I don't know why I feel empty here 
 They say, "Don't bring sand to the beach, you'll see there's plenty here" 
 Seems like all I ever see is fake ass and fake titties here 
 And hoes looking for a come up and a nigga that's tricking here 
 Girl, I don't wanna be the nigga to give you dick and disappear 
 If you want me to, I could do you like I do women here 
 'Cause you spend too much time with your friends, fuck y'all doing? Hey 
 Spending money on strip clubs and drugs, I knew it 
 Damn shawty, you know love ain't the same way I do it 
 I'm the only drug you need to get you through it 
 I always tell you don't get too high 
 Don't drink too much, don't smoke too much 
 Tell me if it's cool if I come by and keep you up 
 I show you love, I show you love 
 Girl, I'm not trying to kill your vibe, kill your buzz 
 I ain't tryna' sober you up 
 Girl, I'm just trying to be by your side 
 And be the one you saw first whenever you woke up 
 Blow that dope, dope 
 Blow that dope, dope 
 Blow that dope, dope 
 Blow that dope, dope 
 Blow that dope, dope 
 Blow that dope, dope
