Uh huh, yeah, ay 
 Uh huh, uh huh 
 Yeah, somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 Yo' intuition has been tellin' you 
 Things that you never knew (never knew) 
 Rubbing shoulders with bitches I used to put on pedestals 
 But still I keep it professional 
 Hey, laying in the bed and you acting like I can't even touch you 
 I don't know why you do that 
 Shower with the door open, why you do that? 
 Drop the towel right in front of me, you cruel 
 What's goin' on, baby, talk to me, baby 
 Say it to me straight, did I make a mistake? 
 And I can't concentrate while you're standing there naked 
 Acting strange, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 Yeah, somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 My intuition has been telling me 
 Trust what you said to me 
 You ain't never really felt love till you slept with me 
 I'm busy, it's no wonder you upset with me 
 You found a Magnum inside of my bag 
 Don't know how to explain this 
 That was in there way before we started dating 
 This the only music I hate facing, oh 
 Lay down, baby, I'ma take it slow 
 Can't let this thing go to waste, oh no 
 Before we crash, hit the brakes, oh no 
 Call, then I got to your place, oh no 
 Still getting voicemail, oh no 
 Fuck it, leave a voicemail, oh no 
 Hey, looks like we're at the end of the road 
 Yeah, somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 Somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 Yeah somethin' tells me 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 We ain't gon' last, baby 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You know I feel like you know what I'm about to say 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 You know what I'm about to say, huh 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Can we make it work, huh 
 Can we make it work 
 Let's make it work 
 Let's make it work, yeah 
 I know we can make it work 
 Let's make it work 
 We can make it work, come on
