This is not, this is not 
 This is not, this is not a motherfuck 
 A motherfucking game, motherfucker, this is not 
 This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy? 
 I'm just saying boy 
 Yeah 
 Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the lambo' 
 No they told me kill them all, goddamn no 
 I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though 
 On two feet, that's where I stand though 
 I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo 
 No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo 
 Nigga I just kill 'em because I can though 
 I'm as humble as they come, but you're fucking with the wrong one 
 Boy you're fucking with the wrong one 
 This that new Pen Griffey watch that nigga get a home run 
 Watch him hit it, it's a home run 
 I ain't playin' with' you nigga's 
 I'm a true Louisvillian 
 I'm the realest, they acrylic 
 Fuck them niggas if they doubt it 
 Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter 
 I've been getting up, gotta pay my self allowance 
 And I save it like the bell, I can't take no more L's 
 The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell 
 Been putting on a show, just like Dave Chappelle 
 They ain't make it in the credits, I'm a tell them oh well 
 Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel 
 Niggas gotta get the work, girl unless you gon twerk something 
 Lotta ladies, verse on em' 
 Damn this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it, I'm just saying nigga (Young Tiller) 
 Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the lambo' 
 No they told me kill them all, goddamn no 
 I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though 
 On two feet, that's where I stand though 
 I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo 
 No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo 
 Nigga I just kill 'em because I can though 
 This ain't temporary, I've been out here, letting them know 
 New cat, years later, best as Sylvester Stallone 
 I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know 
 Peep the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them though 
 She chose me over him, 'cause he's was so regular, oh 
 He was so regular, I'm like a butler, getting this dough 
 I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking predator 
 Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra 
 I don't fuck with thotties, I pass them to my partner 
 All gold everything, bitch I'm Fort Knoxin' 
 New sports car man 
 I'm new Porsche coppin', Two door hop in 
 Girl you know how I've been 
 And I've been trying to budge in my checks with the rest with the money, money 
 Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds 
 M.V.P upper deck with the money, money 
 Don't I make the haters upset with the money 
 Bitch I'm coming 
 This is not, this is not 
 This is not, this is not a motherfuck 
 A motherfucking game, motherfucker, This is not 
 This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy? 
 I'm just saying boy 
 What's up 
 God Tiller!
