All I did is say I have feelings for you 
 And all you do is shit all over it 
 And tell me you want me to get over you 
 And that you want nothing to do with me 
 That's hurtful, Bryson 
 I did nothing to you 
 I've done nothing to you 
 For a year, all you did was lie to me and talk to other girls 
 And I'm still hearing it 
 Okay, I forgive you, let's work with it 
 I really like you 
 Last year was a misunderstanding, let's get over it 
 No more brittle conscience 
 I forgive you for everything 
 I've done nothing 
 And if I did do something 
 Then and now would be the perfect time to say 
 'Cause you done everything to me 
 I never did that to you 
 I'd never do that to you
