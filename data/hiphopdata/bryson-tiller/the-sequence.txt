Baby sometimes I feel so naive 
 Thinking you would come back to me 
 Say I fucked up, I'd have to agree 
 But second chances I do believe in 
 Just give me one reason, we fight, make up then fuck 
 Girl that's the sequence 
 I've been dreaming about the most recent 
 I don't lie, no I don't pretend 
 And your guard up, that's defense 
 Let it down, girl I swear I won't let you down 
 I ain't 2Pac, I don't get around 
 Was clueless at first but I get it now, I get it now 
 You know all of my secrets and 
 You know all of my weaknesses 
 I can't give that to someone else, none of these weak bitches 
 Gotta tell them hoes keep distance 
 This how you was s'ppose go deep in it 
 Please don't do that with no one else 
 Just me, is that to much? 
 Is that too much? 
 Is that too much? 
 Am I asking for too much? 
 Say this shit once, say this shit two times 
 I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine 
 I know I fucked up one two many times 
 Is that too much? 
 Truth be told I know that somebody 
 Somebody as real as me, someone as sincere as me 
 That's what I'm afraid of 
 Don't you dare give him the same love 
 'Cause what that man do girl, I can do it 
 Hold up one time baby girl, I can prove it 
 But this right here, so time consuming 
 And this right here got my mind confusing 
 What now what now, one day one day you'll come around 
 Like "Fuck them niggas, I'll shut 'em down" 
 Sex Mami I'm needin' it 
 Thirsty much I gotta replenish 
 If I get it back you know I'm keepin' it 
 Baby, I been deep in my thoughts like 
 Is that too much? 
 Is that too much? 
 Am I asking for too much? 
 I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine 
 I know I fucked up one two many times
