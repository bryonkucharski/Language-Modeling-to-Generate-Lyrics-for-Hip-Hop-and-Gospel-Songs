Oh, oh 
 Oh, yeah 
 Oh, baby 
 Oh, woah 
 Oh, woah 
 Oh, baby 
 Oh, woah 
 But I'm telling you, you know sometimes we 
 Sometimes we fight (oh, baby) 
 Sometimes we argue (oh, baby) 
 Know we don't get along sometimes but (no I ain't giving up on you) 
 (Baby) I could never give up on you, baby, ever 
 (No I ain't giving up on you, baby) 
 (Hey baby, know we got a lot of work to do) Don't you give up on me (yeah) 
 Only way we gon' get through this is if we work together (oh no, no, no), for real 
 If we work together (oh I want you forever) we can get through this 
 And we could last forever, I don't think I could get over you (oh baby) 
 (You will always be my baby) You were always, that's truth, yeah
