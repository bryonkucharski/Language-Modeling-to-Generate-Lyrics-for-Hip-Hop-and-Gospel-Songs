I wanna know how we became so distant girl 
 The way we fell in love it was almost instant 
 I'm tryna find a way around it 
 Girl tell me how you feel about it 
 You still love me, that's the way it's sounding 
 Thank God I would have never found this, I doubt it 
 I'm there for you if you allow it 
 Girl you know I gotta keep you around me 
 All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces 
 Spending on you baby no matter what the amount is 
 Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed? 
 I guess I had a hard time showing it at first but 
 Baby it's been that way 
 Baby it's been that way 
 Baby I still feel the same 
 Something I gotta maintain 
 Listen to me when I say 
 Baby it's always, always, always been that way 
 It's always been that way 
 (Didn't I tell you girl?) 
 It's always been that way 
 Baby I still feel the same 
 Something I gotta maintain 
 Listen to me when I say 
 It's always been that way 
 How did we become so distant? 
 Like I'm the one to blame and you're innocent 
 I try to make a way, make a difference, but 
 Some things don't change, I can't complain 
 I try not to think about you 
 What can I say, every time I get near you 
 I want that old thing back, now bring it to me 
 Shorty keep telling me what to do about you 
 Then she got jealous soon as she knew about you 
 She don't never want to see us go through round two 
 (Cut her off!) Cut her off that's what I'm doing now, you 
 Told me I should go out and do my thing 
 (Damn right!) Damn right I do my thing 
 Now you want to know what's gotten into me, what's changed? 
 But baby none change 
 Baby it's been that way 
 Baby it's been that way 
 Baby I still feel the same 
 Something I gotta maintain 
 Listen to me when I say 
 Baby it's always, always, always been that way 
 It's always been that way 
 (Didn't I tell you girl?) 
 It's always been that way 
 Baby I still feel the same 
 Something I gotta maintain 
 Listen to me when I say 
 It's always been that way
