So, ever since October 
 Living out my dreams, they got a lot closer 
 Had to do it for my daughter before she got older 
 Had to wake the sleepers up, bitch I got Folgers 
 I'm the realest nigga out, remember I told ya 
 Guess I'm dirty city raised, but I'm not local 
 Now they actin' like they kin, I do not know them 
 I've been prospering ever since I dropped "Don't", nigga 
 But it don't stop here, I gotta keep it goin', keep it goin' 
 Keep that hate coming my nigga, I'm a keep ignoring 
 God Tiller, your flow so prehistoric 
 Got, got killers, smoke yours or put me in the corner 
 I'm Cassius, my nigga put me in the corner 
 Versus anybody, really show me my opponent 
 They coming for my head, I'm like Makonnen 
 Kill them all, send 'em my condolences 
 And I'm back, back, back on my bullshit nigga 
 Do I miss doing this shit, just for fun, just a little 
 Now, I do it for funds, that's facts, fundamentals 
 For a house up on the makers, lawyers, doctors, my neighbors 
 Everyday I say my prayers, terminators, betrayers 
 Now the man is blessing me, first the man was testing me 
 I went through the storm not knowing whether it was green on the other side or not 
 That shit would bring out the best of me 
 I'm so true with it, who are you kidding 
 12 asked what I do for a living, told them Google it 
 I'm so rude with it, and the youngin' doing it 
 You don't know what I been through nigga 
 This the truth nigga, oh my goodness 
 Spittin' flames in the booth, nigga, oh my goodness 
 God really came through for me, oh my goodness 
 I can give a fuck about you, and your mothafuckin' crew 
 That's ain't something I would do, no I wouldn't 
 Ya dig? 
 Yeah 
 I just gotta let this shit ride man 
 (Ya dig) 
 Uh, I feel like Weezy F Baby sometimes 
 Carter 3 Wayne, Carter 4 Wayne 
 Carter 5, man where that shit at? 
 Yessir 
 You know me, I gotta keep it real on this shit 
 My shawty mama put me out the crib, nigga I was payin' bills 
 Almost got a third job, she don't know the way it feels 
 But look, look at how a nigga living 
 My dream just got a lot more vivid 
 And I'm starting to see a whole lot more friendlies 
 But I don't want too many, no I don't want too many, no way 
 City to city 
 Never forget that phone call I got from Timbo and Richie 
 When I was in Philly, that's when I knew this shit wasn't given 
 Then shit really got crazy when, got the kicks from Drizzy 
 Well, the recognition from Drizzy alone 
 I remember when they slept on me: memory foam 
 Can't believe Timbo the king just sent me back home 
 But now that boy getting on, my nigga give me the throne 
 Ya dig? 
 Yup, I know the people they diggin' me now 
 The cools kids from my school can't sit with me now 
 My baby mama's mama can't say shit to me now 
 What did she do wrong? She better figure it out 
 You better, I done grew into a wise young fella 
 This is true shit, you know Tiller goin' tell 'em 
 I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the truth 
 The whole truth, yeah 
 I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the trut 
 The whole truth, ay, baby yeah
