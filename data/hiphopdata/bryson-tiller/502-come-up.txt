Yeah-yeah-eah-eah 
 For real though, it's so wild now 
 This shit crazy yeah 
 Woke up in the hills this morning 
 Asking myself, how did I get here this morning? 
 Vonte Parker in that teal and orange 
 And Russell in that gold and purple 
 Youngest from the Ville, imported 
 I used to sit up in my room and ponder 
 Finished school and get a Doctors 
 I'm twenty-two, I gotta get it now 
 Man who knew he'd have it figured out? 
 Trapsoul, man, I crack codes 
 Crack cocaine, that's what we putting out 
 There fuck niggas saying 
 Don't forget when you was broke, I was looking out 
 And some say there's levels to this shit 
 Damn look at all the levels that I skipped 
 Feeling like there's a medal I should get 
 All these haters getting heavy on my dick 
 Look at my niggas, chasing paper 
 Getting books with my niggas 
 How the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas 
 Your two cents ain't working for me 
 All you niggas sound commercial to me, man 
 I don't like commercial niggas 
 Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you 
 Fuck your feelings 
 Don't take it personal, it's nothing personal 
 This a Derby City come up, this a Derby City vertical 
 First forty-eight, straight murder you 
 For years and years we waited on this 
 Living in a place folks didn't know exist 
 Surprise motherfucker, we up in this bitch 
 I said I'm back and I'm so much better 
 I'm so, so much better 
 And I won't stop (Louis) 
 I can't stop 
 Not now (Louis) not ever (Louis, Louis) 
 Louis slugger with the hits 
 Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch 
 I'm watching how you pitch 
 I'm not from Houston, no, I'm not from 'round the six 
 Got the four series, I should cop the six after the world series 
 I just taught the rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches 
 And how these snakes can harm me with bad business 
 Damn, fuck out of here nigga 
 It's very rare for young black men to come up out of here nigga 
 Some will call it luck and some will call me up 
 I ain't heard from you in years 
 Please get the fuck out my ear nigga 
 My peers get it 
 Only G-O-D can judge me, fuck the jurisdiction 
 I'm working, ain't got time for thirsting 
 Over how these chicks appear in pictures 
 I'm just painting crystal clear pictures 
 Brushing up on my lyrics nigga 
 I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us 
 I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious 
 Let's get it 
 There's not much to say 
 Woah, I'm from the southside 
 God Tiller
