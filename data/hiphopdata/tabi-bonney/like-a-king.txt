Hello, is that you bangin' at my door? 
 Askin', can Tab, your boy, Bonney, come out to play? 
 Okay, I guess we'll conquer the world today 
 Danke, please tell 'em that I'm on my way 
 Or maybe we could just go and chase after girls 
 After all I'm in no rush to save the world 
 People don't even appreciate us anyways 
 So the world can wait on us 'til another day 
 Ah, I wish I could just blow it off 
 It ain't that easy especially when you a know-it-all 
 It's just that easy for me to go and blow it all 
 And I already know they prayin' for my downfall 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 And I, and I, and I, and I usually don't be showin' off 
 Showboatin' on these bamas as I'm sellin' off 
 Goal postin' on these youngins, yes, I do indulge 
 And occasionally I put my hands upon my balls 
 And, yes, I know, babe, I promised you that I would call 
 We pinky-sweared but my fiancée beat you there 
 I told her that she listenin' to too much Beyoncé 
 Put a ring on that microphone fiend on it 
 Just make sure you don't toss Billy Jean on it 
 And they, and they told me that the haters always come with it 
 I said, cool, babe, tell them Gumps, come, get it 
 I'm prepared, I eat vultures medium rare 
 And my mom said, Tab, you ain't fair 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 Workin' like a peasant 'til I'm livin' like a king 
 I tell her, let me in the bed but you can't see me in the streets 
 Clever as a feather avoiding the wind 
 While you just livin' like it's not that important to win 
 Condescending is my tone, rent a Bentley so I roam 
 Just like I'm ballin' though I don't 
 I'm tryin' to live just like His Highness, sippin' on a Heiny 
 Ain't fuckin' with me lyrically go find you some vagina 
 A genius, a G in this 
 Although I'm never, ever praised on achievements 
 They hate to see me winnin', they been tryin' to close my window 
 But they fear me like king, I just made play for Sacramento 
 You couldn't be this fresh if you done ate a sack of Mentos 
 Wale been on his ten toes, roger that, ten-four 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things 
 And how to live just like a king 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha 
 'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha
