Ooh, I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker 
 And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall 
 So lay it down, lay it down 
 You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes 
 Let me hear you say you want it all 
 Say it now, say it now 
 Look what you're doing, look what you done 
 But in this jungle you can't run 
 'Cause what I got for you 
 I promise it's a killer, you'll be banging on my chest 
 Bang bang, gorilla 
 Ooh, yeah 
 You and me baby, making love like gorillas 
 Ooh, yeah 
 You and me baby, making love like gorillas 
 Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair 
 But you don't look like you're scared 
 You're just smiling tell me, "Daddy it's yours." 
 'Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover 
 If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the SWAT 
 We don't stop, we keep rocking while they knocking on our door 
 And you're screaming "Give it to me baby, 
 Give it to me motherfucker." 
 Ooh, look what you're doing, look what you done 
 But in this jungle you can't run 
 'Cause what I got for you 
 I promise it's a killer, you'll be banging on my chest 
 Bang bang, gorilla 
 Ooh, yeah 
 You and me baby, making love like gorillas 
 Ooh, yeah 
 You and me baby, making love like gorillas 
 I bet you never ever felt so good, so good 
 I got your body trembling like it should, it should 
 You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Oh, you with me baby, making love like gorillas 
 Ooh, yeah 
 You and me baby, we'll be fuckin' like gorillas 
 (Ooh, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, oh yeah 
 You and me baby, making love like gorillas
