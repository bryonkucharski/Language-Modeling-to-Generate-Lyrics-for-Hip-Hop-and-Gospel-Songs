So what we get drunk 
 So what we smoke weed 
 We're just having fun 
 We don't care who sees 
 So what we go out 
 That's how it's supposed to be 
 Living young and wild and free 
 Uh, uh huh 
 So what I keep 'em rolled up 
 Saggin' my pants not caring what I show 
 Keep it real with my niggas 
 Keep it player for the hoes 
 And look clean don't it? 
 Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it 
 Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers 
 And smoke them hoes down till they stingers 
 You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin' grade A 
 Yeah, uh you know what? 
 It's like I'm seventeen again 
 Peach fuzz on my face 
 Lookin', on the case 
 Tryna find a hella taste 
 Oh My God, I'm on the chase 
 Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it 
 Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away 
 Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay 
 Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint 
 Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J" 
 Uh, and now I don't even care 
 Long as me and my team in here 
 There's gon' be some weed in the air 
 Tell 'em Mac 
 Blowin' everywhere we goin' 
 And now ya knowin' 
 When I step right up 
 Get my lighter so I can light up 
 That's how it should be done 
 Soon as you thinkin' you're down 
 Find how to turn things around 
 Now things are looking up 
 From the ground up 
 Pound up 
 It's Taylor Gang 
 So turn my sound up 
 And mount up 
 And do my thang 
 Now I'm chillin' 
 Fresh outta class feelin' 
 Like I'm on my own 
 And I could probably own a building 
 Got my own car 
 No job, no children 
 Had this science project 
 Me and Mac killed it 
 T-h-c 
 M-a-c 
 D-e-v 
 H-d-3 
 High as me 
 This is us 
 We gon' fuss 
 And we gon' fight 
 And we gon' roll 
 And live off life 
 Yeah, roll one, smoke one 
 When you live like this you're supposed to party 
 Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun 
 So we just, roll one, smoke one 
 When you live like this you're supposed to party 
 Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
