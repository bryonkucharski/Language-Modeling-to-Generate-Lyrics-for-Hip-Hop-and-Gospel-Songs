Dim all the lights sweet darling 
 'Cause tonight it's all the way 
 Turn up the old Victrola 
 Gonna dance the night away 
 Love just don't come easy 
 No it seldom does 
 When you find the perfect love 
 Let it fill you up 
 Dim all the lights sweet darling 
 'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby 
 Turn up the old Victrola 
 Gonna dance the night away 
 Love just don't come easy 
 No it seldom does 
 When you find the perfect love 
 Let it fill you up 
 Dim all the light sweet honey 
 'Cause tonight it's you and me 
 No need to worry darlin' 
 'Cause it's for eternity 
 Love don't come easy 
 This you know I understand 
 I want to be your woman 
 If you'll be my man 
 Let yourself go freely and I'll 
 Show you things that you've dreamed of 
 Don't think that your dreaming 
 We've found the perfect love 
 And I'm like a cup 
 So fill me up 
 Dim all the lights sweet darlin' 
 'Cause the night is on the way, oh baby 
 Turn up the old Victrola 
 Gonna dance the night away 
 Do what you want 
 You can use me all up 
 Take me bottom to top 
 Don't leave even one drop 
 No, no, no 
 Do it tonight 
 You know the moments are right 
 Turn my brown body white 
 Come on, dim all the lights 
 Dim all the lights sweet darlin' 
 'Cause the night is on the way, hey baby 
 Turn up the old Victrola 
 Gonna dance the night away, hey baby 
 Dim all the lights sweet darlin' 
 Dim all the lights sweet honey...
