I'm trapped in without her somewhere far away 
 I keep thinking about her but I know I can't stay 
 She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere 
 She doesn't leave me alone 
 I can't escape her or erase her 
 When I know she's not coming home 
 I can't understand where I went wrong 
 I can't understand where her love has gone 
 I don't know where I belong 
 My world is over 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (Her world goes on) 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (My world is gone) 
 Am I crazy or just human 
 Is this what heartbreak is 
 What should I be doing 
 It feels like I got seconds to live 
 She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere 
 She doesn't leave me alone 
 I can't escape her or erase her 
 When I know she's not coming home 
 I can't understand where I went wrong 
 I can't understand where her love has gone 
 I don't know where I belong 
 My world is over 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (Her world goes on) 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (My world is gone) 
 My world is over while her world goes on 
 (.. I don't know where I belong 
 My world is over) 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (Her world goes on) 
 When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on 
 (My world is gone)
