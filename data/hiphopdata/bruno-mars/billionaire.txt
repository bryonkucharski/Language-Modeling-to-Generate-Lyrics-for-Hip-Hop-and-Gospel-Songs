(Bruno Mars) 
 I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad 
 Buy all of the things I never had 
 Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine 
 Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen 
 Oh every time I close my eyes 
 I see my name in shining lights 
 A different city every night oh 
 I swear the world better prepare 
 For when I'm a billionaire 
 (Travis "Travie" McCoy) 
 Yeah I would have a show like Oprah 
 I would be the host of, everyday Christmas 
 Give Travie a wish list 
 I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt 
 And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-t 
 Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this 
 And last but not least grant somebody their last wish 
 It's been a couple months since I've single so 
 You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho 
 Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit 
 And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did 
 Yeah can't forget about me stupid 
 Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music 
 Oh every time I close my eyes 
 I see my name in shining lights 
 A different city every night oh 
 I swear the world better prepare 
 For when I'm a billionaire 
 Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a Billionaire 
 Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a Billionaire 
 (Travis "Travie" McCoy) 
 I'll be playing basketball with the President 
 Dunking on his delegates 
 Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette 
 Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it 
 But keep the fives, twentys (?) completely separate 
 And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket 
 We in recession but let me take a crack at it 
 I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up 
 So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks 
 And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was 
 Eating good sleeping soundly 
 I know we all have a similar dream 
 Go in your pocket pull out your wallet 
 And put it in the air and sing
