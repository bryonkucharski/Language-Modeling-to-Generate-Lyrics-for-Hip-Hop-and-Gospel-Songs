Got me going in circles c-circles 
 My heart is dizzy from you 
 Got me going in circles c-circles 
 Tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 You got me up at night 
 Feeling like 
 You won't come through 
 Got me going in circles c-circles 
 My heart is dizzy from you 
 Round and r-r-r-round we go [x2] 
 Round and r-r-r-round 
 I'm goin' in circles c-circles 
 Please girl! 
 I give you everything, but, it's not enough 
 You started being easy but lately you've made it rough (for us) 
 You say you need me but then turn me away 
 Got me oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay? 
 (Baby tell me what you want) A little more time 
 (Baby tell me what you need) Baby all your love 
 (How far you tryna go?) All the way 
 (Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind
