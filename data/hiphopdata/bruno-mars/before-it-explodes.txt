It's not a question of love, 
 Cause our love has never changed. 
 But all the little things keep piling up, 
 And life keeps getting in the way. 
 Don't make it harder than it is, 
 We both knew it'd come to this. 
 Better now than in a year, 
 We're not so cheesy, 
 And we both hate each other. 
 The fuse is already left, 
 So how about a final kiss? 
 Just let it go 
 And stop the madness, 
 Before it explodes! 
 Before it's out of our control. 
 Let's stop the madness, 
 Before it explodes! 
 We gotta let it go, 
 Before it all explodes. 
 Some things we won't understand, 
 And we're both so tired of being misunderstood. 
 So let's just turn around and walk away, 
 And hold on to what was got. 
 Don't make it harder than it is, 
 We both knew it'd come to this. 
 Better now than in a year, 
 We're not so cheesy, 
 And we both hate each other. 
 The fuse is already left, 
 So how about a final kiss? 
 Just let it go 
 And stop the madness, 
 Before it explodes! 
 Before it's out of our control. 
 Let's stop the madness, 
 Before it explodes! 
 We gotta let it go, 
 Before it all explodes. 
 There ain't nothing that can save us 
 But you're close to the edge 
 And what's the use of going on 
 If we're lying to each other every word that is said 
 It's too late for us now 
 'Cause we can never count down 
 It's getting close! 
 It's gonna blow! 
 Stop the madness 
 Before it explodes! 
 Before it's out of our control. 
 Let's stop the madness, 
 Before it explodes! 
 We gotta let it go, 
 Before it all explodes! 
 We gotta stop the madness 
 Ooh...
