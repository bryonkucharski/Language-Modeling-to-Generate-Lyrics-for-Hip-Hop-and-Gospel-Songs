I know a place 
 Where the grass is really greener 
 Warm, wet and wild 
 There must be somethin' in the water 
 Sippin' gin and juice 
 Layin' underneath the palm trees (Undone) 
 The boys 
 Break their necks 
 Try'na creep a little sneak peek (At us) 
 You could travel the world 
 But nothing comes close 
 To the Golden Coast 
 Once you party with us 
 You'll be falling in love 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California girls 
 We're unforgettable 
 Daisy Dukes 
 Bikinis on top 
 Sun-kissed skin 
 So hot 
 We'll melt your Popsicle 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California girls 
 We're undeniable 
 Fine, fresh, fierce 
 We got it on lock 
 Westcoast represent 
 Now put your hands up 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 Sex on the beach 
 We don't mind sand in our Stilettos 
 We freak 
 In my Jeep 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo (Oh oh) 
 You could travel the world 
 But nothing comes close 
 To the Golden Coast 
 Once you party with us 
 You'll be falling in love 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California girls 
 We're unforgettable 
 Daisy Dukes 
 Bikinis on top 
 Sun-kissed skin 
 So hot 
 We'll melt your Popsicle 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California gurls 
 We're undeniable 
 Fine, fresh, fierce 
 We got it on lock 
 Westcoast represent 
 Now put your hands up 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California gurls 
 We're unforgettable 
 Daisy Dukes 
 Bikinis on top 
 Sun-kissed skin 
 So hot 
 We'll melt your Popsicle 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 California gurls 
 We're undeniable 
 Fine, fresh, fierce 
 We got it on lock 
 Westcoast represent 
 (Westcoast, Westcoast) 
 Now put your hands up 
 Ooh oh ooh
