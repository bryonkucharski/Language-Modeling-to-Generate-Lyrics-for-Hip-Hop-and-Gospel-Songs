All alone in my room 
 Waiting for, for this phone to ring 
 She'll come home someday soon 
 I just know or am I imagining things 
 The voices in my head keep saying 
 (The voices in my head) 
 She's coming back to you 
 Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 What do I do (what do I do) 
 There's no more you (there's no more you) 
 And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home) 
 Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh) 
 Voices in my head 
 The voices, the voices, the voices 
 Voices in my head 
 The voices (oh), the voices, the voices 
 Someone's there at the door 
 This is her I just know (I just know) 
 I get dressed, I put on a smile 
 Oh but I it's just the mail again (the mail again) 
 The playing in my mind (the playing in my mind) 
 Saying she'll come back this time 
 Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 What do I do (what do I do) 
 There's no more you (there's no more you) 
 And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home) 
 Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh) 
 Voices in my head 
 It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok 
 Oh just gotta get through the day 
 It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok 
 Oh I just gotta get through 
 The voices in my head (the voices in my head) 
 Keep saying she's coming back to you 
 Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
 What do I do (what do I do) 
 There's no more you (there's no more you) 
 And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home) 
 Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh) 
 Voices in my head 
 Oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
