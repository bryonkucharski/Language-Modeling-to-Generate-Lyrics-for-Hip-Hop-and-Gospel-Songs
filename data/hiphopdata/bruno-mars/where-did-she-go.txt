I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl 
 That girl that girl 
 Every time I came around 
 She made her body go down 
 Her physical was so crazy 
 She could make a blind man see 
 Ooh 
 Before then, we got separated 
 She was gone before I could say shit 
 And I ain't looking for no replacement 
 No, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 If I gotta almost search the whole club 
 Trying to get to her before she sobers up 
 Let me see you throw your hands up 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? 
 I've been looking for her all night 
 I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl 
 That girl, that girl 
 I must've seen her beauty at the bar 
 Under the strobe lights, looking like a star 
 (Looking like a star, girl) 
 But everyone started rushing me 
 Looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh 
 Before then, we got separated 
 She was gone before I could say shit 
 And I ain't looking for no replacement 
 No, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 If I gotta almost search the whole club 
 Trying to get to her before she sobers up 
 Let me see you throw your hands up 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Club closing up, I'm still looking for you 
 Walked up to the ladies room 
 No luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth 
 Next thing I know 
 She tell my show, "This ain't you 
 Looking at you, you wanna take me home 
 So tonight, I just might put you on" 
 I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl 
 I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl 
 I'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night 
 Where did she go? Where did she go? 
 Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
