Drop top Porsche 
 Rollie on my wrist 
 Diamonds up and down my chain 
 Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin' 
 Bossed up and I changed the game (you spinnin') 
 It's my big bronze boogie, got all them girls shook 
 My big, fat ass got all them boys hooked 
 I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands 
 Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like 
 Aye Flexin' on the ground like (aye!) 
 Hit the Lil Jon, okay (okay), okay, (okay) 
 Oh, yeah we drippin' in finesse, getting' paid (ow!) 
 Ooh, don't we look good together? 
 There's a reason why they watch all night long 
 Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever 
 So tonight I'm gonna show you off 
 When I'm walkin' with you 
 I watch the whole room change 
 Baby, that's what you do 
 No my baby don't play 
 Blame it on my confidence 
 Oh, blame it on your measurements 
 Shut that shit down on sight 
 That's right 
 We out here drippin' in finesse 
 It don't make no sense 
 Out here drippin' in finesse 
 You know it, you know it 
 We out here drippin' in finesse 
 It don't make no sense 
 Out here drippin' in finesse 
 You know it, you know it 
 Now slow it down for me baby 
 'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind 
 Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor 
 Nothing can stop us tonight 
 When I'm walkin' with you 
 I watch the whole room change 
 Baby, that's what you do 
 No my baby don't play 
 Blame it on my confidence 
 Oh, blame it on your measurements 
 Shut that shit down on sight 
 That's right 
 We out here drippin' in finesse 
 It don't make no sense 
 Out here drippin' in finesse 
 You know it, you know it 
 We out here drippin' in finesse 
 It don't make no sense 
 Out here drippin' in finesse 
 You know it, you know it 
 Fellas grab your ladies if your lady fine 
 Tell her she the one, she the one for life 
 Ladies grab your fellas and let's do this right 
 If you're on one like me in mind
