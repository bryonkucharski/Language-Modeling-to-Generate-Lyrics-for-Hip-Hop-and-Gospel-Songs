 I had a cute thing, buenas noches 
 By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest 
 Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardic arrest

 Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock 
 Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got

 OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper 
 The booty so smooth, can't believe is not butter 
 I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer 
 I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin' 
 I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface 
 I load in my clip in and told her, 'Don't get nervous' 
 I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, Bang, bang killer 
 Nipple tit clit licker 
 Ball like a dribble 
 Put you in a pickle, nibble on my dickle 
 Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual 
 Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too 
 Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews 
 I'm trying to get into you, into you 
 Then make you my enemy 
 Not playing, got the bitch mad 
 Me don't like flat screen, ass I need a 3D
