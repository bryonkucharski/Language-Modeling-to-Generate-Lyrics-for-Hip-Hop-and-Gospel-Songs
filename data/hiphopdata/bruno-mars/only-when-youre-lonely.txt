Here I am again, doing things I said that I wouldn't do 
 It's 3AM and I'm rushing out the door to see you 
 Waiting, all day, but now you wanna call me 
 Why do you do this to me all the time? 
 After all the things you put me through, still I come right back 
 But now I know the truth, I can finally see 
 You only want me when you're lonely 
 If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
 Next time you need me there I won't make it 
 Another late night call I won't take it 
 Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
 Only when you're lonely, lonely 
 Only when you're lonely 
 Only when you're lonely, lonely 
 Only when you're lonely 
 Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart 
 'Cause I loved you, loved you, loved you 
 But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl with no one to turn you 
 Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer 
 So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything 
 After all the things you put me through, ooh still I come right back 
 But now I know the truth, I can finally see 
 You only want me when you're lonely 
 If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
 Next time you need me there I won't make it 
 Another late night call I won't take it 
 Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
 Oh, nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it 
 You just think of yourself and never me at all 
 If you're with your friends, you just string me along 
 But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on 
 'Cause I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
 If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
 Next time you need me there I won't make it 
 Another late night call I won't take it 
 Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
 Only when you're lonely, lonely 
 Only when you're lonely 
 Only when you're lonely, lonely 
 Only when you're lonely 
 I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
 If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
 Next time you need me there I won't make it 
 Another late night call I won't take it 
 Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
