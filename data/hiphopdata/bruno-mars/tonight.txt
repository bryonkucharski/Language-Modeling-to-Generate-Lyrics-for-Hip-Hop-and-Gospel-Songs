(Bruno Mars: Chorus) 
 Maybe if I jump or spread my wings 
 I know I've been wrong about these things 
 I don't care if no one else believes 
 I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it 
 Tonight 
 Oh tonight 
 If you believe in me like I believe in you 
 Tonight 
 Tonight 
 Because impossible is possible tonight 
 (Johnny Angel: Verse 1) 
 Some 'bout the day 
 Some 'bout the night 
 Feeling so right I can smell it in the air 
 Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear 
 But I don't even care I like my chicks simple 
 Wit' a big dimple real down to earth 
 Not stuck up there for they man 
 Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita 
 Low like Kesha when she on the mic 
 Move on to another 'cause she wasn't treated right 
 I could relate to that boy Drizzy 
 How did I wind up right here with you 
 ? You can achieve if you do believe 
 Gotta chase your dreams true reality 
 No fantasy enjoy it while you have it 
 Relax and take it in 
 I tell as your friend your friend to the end 
 (Johnny Angel: Verse 2) 
 Some 'bout the day 
 Some 'bout the night 
 Feeling so right I can smell it in the air 
 Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear 
 But I don't even care I like my chicks simple 
 Wit' a big dimple real down to earth 
 Not stuck up there for they man 
 Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita 
 We could get together like it's New Years Eve 
 Met a lot of girls but is you what I need 
 I live life fast... 
 Tryna hang on passenger... 
 I need a companion on this campaign 
 Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days 
 One life to live gotta be epic or be I'll be Edward you can be my bella
