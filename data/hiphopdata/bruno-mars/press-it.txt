It's been so long since you been gone, 
 And now we're here 
 The music's on, 
 We're feeling freaky (oh) 
 I want you in my bedroom, 
 You want me closer to you 
 What are we doing? 
 Let's get to it 
 I lay you down, 
 Take off your clothes, 
 And kiss your lips 
 It feels so good, ooh you're saying more 
 I wanna be inside you 
 Ooh girl you got that fire 
 I can't wait no longer I just gotta take control 
 The lights in the club are turning you on 
 Now girl let's pretend we both are alone 
 We'll finish this up when we get home 
 The only thing I need from you girl 
 Is to press your body, 
 On my body 
 Do it fast, do it slow, 
 You control the tempo 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Bring it back now 
 Let me feel your body 
 Just (press it, press it) 
 My favorite place is that space between your legs and yours hips 
 Ooh, got me licking my lips 
 Wanna get up on it 
 It's a special thing that we be doing 
 Feelin' bit bad boy 
 Girl I'm doing 
 It ain't no secret 'bout what it is 
 Come on girl serve me the dish 
 The lights in the club are turning you on 
 Now girl let's pretend we both are alone 
 We'll finish this up when we get home 
 The only thing I need from you girl 
 Is to press your body, 
 On my body 
 Do it fast, do it slow, 
 You control the tempo 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Bring it back now 
 Let me feel your body 
 Just 
 Press your body, 
 On my body 
 Do it fast, do it slow, 
 You control the tempo 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Bring it back now 
 Let me feel your body 
 Just press 
 Girl you're the only thing that I see 
 So don't you take your body from me 
 And there's no other place I'd rather be 
 Oh girl there's something about your body, body, body 
 Ooh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty 
 Right now we got our own little party, party, party 
 So good, 
 The way you press your body on me 
 All I need from you 
 Is to press your body, 
 On my body 
 Do it fast, do it slow, 
 You control the tempo 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Bring it back now 
 Let me feel your body 
 Just 
 Press your body, 
 On my body 
 Do it fast, do it slow, 
 You control the tempo 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Girl there's something about your body, body, body 
 Oh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty 
 Right now we got our own little party, party, party 
 So good, 
 The way you press your body on me 
 All I need from you 
 Is to press it
