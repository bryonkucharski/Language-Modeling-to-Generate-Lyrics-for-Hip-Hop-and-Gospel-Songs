I've been working hard so long 
 Seems like pain has been my only friend 
 My fragile heart's been done so wrong 
 I wondered if I'd ever heal again 
 Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same 
 All around me I can feel a change (oh) 
 I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me 
 Leave the past behind me, today my life begins 
 A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking 
 I know I can make it, today my life begins 
 Yesterday has come and gone 
 And I've learn how to leave it where it is 
 And I see that I was wrong 
 For ever doubting I could win 
 Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same 
 All around me I can feel a change (oh) 
 I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me 
 Leave the past behind me, today my life begins 
 A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking 
 I know I can make it, today my life begins 
 Life's to short to have regrets 
 So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget 
 Only have one life to live 
 So you better make the best of it 
 I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me 
 Leave the past behind me, today my life begins 
 A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking 
 I know I can make it, today my life begins 
 I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me 
 Leave the past behind me, today my life begins 
 A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking 
 I know I can make it, today my life begins 
 Today my life begins...
