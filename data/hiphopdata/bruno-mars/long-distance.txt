There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time 
 And I'm running outta things to do to get you off my mind (oh) 
 All I have is this picture in a frame 
 That I hold close to see your face everyday 
 With you is where I'd rather be 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 This long distance is killin' me 
 I wish that you were here with me 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 This long distance is killin' me 
 It's so hard (so hard) 
 When we are (when we are) 
 We're so far, this long distance is killin' me 
 It's so hard (so hard) 
 When we are (when we are) 
 So far, this long distance is killin' me 
 Now the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days 
 While I'm away 
 You know right now I can't be home 
 But I'm comin' home soon, coming home soon 
 All I have is this picture in a frame 
 That I hold close to see your face again 
 With you is where I'd rather be 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 This long distance is killin' me 
 I wish that you were here with me 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 Breakdown: 
 Can you hear me cryin'? (Ooh) 
 Can you hear me cryin'? (Ooh) 
 Can you hear me cryin'? (Ooh) 
 With you is where I'd rather be 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 This long distance is killin' me 
 I wish that you were here with me 
 But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far 
 It's so hard (so hard) 
 When we are (when we are) 
 We're so far, this long distance is killin' me 
 It's so hard (so hard) 
 When we are (when we are) 
 So far, this long distance is killin' me
