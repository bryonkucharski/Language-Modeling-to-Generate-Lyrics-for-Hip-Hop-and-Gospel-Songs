What are you fucking crazy? 
 Damn ... 
 It's getting hard to breathe 
 I'm trying to make her see, 
 That she do not really know 
 That I'm trying to find a way, 
 And tell her every day, that she just goes along 
 So I... 
 I do not wanna be, 
 The only one that knows 
 That somebody could come along and just 
 Take her right from me 
 I'm standing shaking ground, 
 And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it, 
 'Cause I'm losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing control of myself this time. 
 She's got me losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing my way, 
 But I think she feels I'm already lost. 
 I'm already lost. 
 I wish that I could see, 
 What is making you 
 Feel that you Should be concerned. 
 My love is like a Gunshot 
 All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away. 
 I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time, 
 It's gotta be with you and no one else. 
 Do you notice me, 
 I need to know right now 
 'Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it 
 'Cause I'm losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing control of myself this time. 
 She's got me losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing my way, 
 But I think she feels I'm already lost. 
 Maybe I'm trying too hard 
 But girl you make me nervous, 
 Should you have by now noticed me. 
 And what will it take it 
 To a heavenly Because your 
 Drawing chains and 
 Driving me insane! 
 Girl, I'm losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing control of myself this time. 
 She's got me losing my head, 
 I'm losing my mind, 
 I'm losing my way, 
 But I think she feels I'm already lost.
