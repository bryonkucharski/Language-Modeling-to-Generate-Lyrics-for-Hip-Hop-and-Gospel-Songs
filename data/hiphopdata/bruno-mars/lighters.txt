(Hook: Bruno Mars) 
 This ones for you and me living out our dreams 
 We're all right where we should be 
 With my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see 
 Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters 
 (Verse 1: Eminem) 
 By the time you hear this, I woulda already spiraled up 
 I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up 
 If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin' 
 Fighters keep fightin', put you lighters up, point them skyward, uh 
 Had a dream I was king, I woke up still king 
 Rap game's nipple is mine for the milking 
 Till nobody else even fuckin' feels me, till it kills me 
 I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music 
 There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free 
 But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up 
 Only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses 
 Excuse me, if my head is too big for this building 
 And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick 
 Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit 
 Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip dick you did opposite 
 You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks 
 I love it when I tell them shove it cause it wasn't that 
 Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster 
 'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing 
 Brain fuzzy 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzer 
 Now you wonder why he does it how he does it? Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards 
 Circling around his head waiting for him to drop dead, was it? 
 Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off? Little hussy ass scuzzes 
 Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it? 
 What difference it make? What's it take to get it through your thick skulls 
 That this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way 
 From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place 
 Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage 
 And let be known from this day forward, I wanna just say thanks 
 Cause your hate is what gave me the strength 
 So let them Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8" 
 (Verse 2: Royce) 
 By the time you hear this I probably already be outty 
 I advance like going from toting iron 
 To goin' and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the Iron Man Audi 
 My daddy told me slow down boy, you're going to blow it 
 And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute 
 To tell Shady I love the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic 
 Tell him how real he is or how high I am 
 Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it 
 I cried plenty tears, my daddy gotta bad back 
 So it's only right, that I write till he can march right 
 In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up 
 Now his career's Lebron's Jersey in 20 years 
 I stop when I'm at the very top 
 You shitted on me on your way up, there's bout to be a scary drop 
 'Cause what goes up, must come down 
 You goin' down I'm something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box 
 Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now 
 Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy 
 Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count 
 Always down for the catchweight, like Pacquiao 
 Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me 
 My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes 
 Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up 
 To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick 
 And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high 
 And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches 
 On a radio and TV, see me, we fly 
 Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee hive 
 And how real is that? I remember signing my first deal 
 Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that 
 Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag 
 (Bridge: Bruno Mars) 
 You and I know what it's like 
 To be kicked down, forced to fight 
 But tonight, we're all right 
 So hold up your lights, let it shine, because
