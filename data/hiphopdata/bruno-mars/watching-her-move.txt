She got it, she looking good 
 I'm just watching her move 
 She walks on in with her red dress on 
 Her lips as bright as the sun 
 Her curves goes every which way 
 Got skin like porcelain 
 The way her hair falls down her back 
 Billy accents her tattoo? 
 (Are you talking to me?) 
 The way her hair falls down her back 
 Billy accents her tattoo? 
 Her legs like a supermodel 
 She worn for them high heel shoes 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 Just watch her get it 
 (Get it) 
 Just watch her move 
 She pulls me to the side 
 Tells me she wants to go 
 I say, girl, I'm yours tonight 
 After this I'm taking you home 
 First and for most I dance with you 
 Get you in the mood 
 Maybe later, baby 
 Girl, I'll show you exactly how I do 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 Just watch her get it 
 (Get it) 
 Just watch her get it 
 (Get it) 
 God, baby, you look good 
 You sexy, watch her move 
 Watch her move 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 She got every single guy in the club 
 Just watching her move 
 And she don't wanna dance with anyone 
 Let her do what she do 
 Just watch her get it 
 (Get it) 
 Just watch her get it 
 (Get it) 
 Look at her get it 
 Just watch her 
 Watch her move, ooh
