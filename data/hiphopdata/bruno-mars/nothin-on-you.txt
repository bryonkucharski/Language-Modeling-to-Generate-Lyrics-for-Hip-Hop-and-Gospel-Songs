Beautiful girls all over the world 
 I could be chasing but my time would be wasted 
 They got nothin' on you baby 
 Nothin' on you baby 
 They might say hi and I might say hey 
 But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby 
 Nothin' on you baby 
 No' no' no' nothin' on you babe 
 No' no' nothin' on you 
 I know you feel where I'm coming from 
 Regardless of the things in my past that I've done 
 Most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
 On the carousel so around I spun (spun) 
 With no directions just tryna get some (some) 
 Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun) 
 An' so I lost more than I had ever won 
 And honestly I ended up with none 
 There's so much nonsense 
 It's on my conscience 
 I'm thinking baby I should get it out 
 And I don't wanna sound redundant 
 But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know 
 (That you wanna know) 
 But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go) 
 'Cause we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode) 
 And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go) 
 Beautiful girls all over the world 
 I could be chasing but my time would be wasted 
 They got nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe) 
 (No' no' nothin' on you) 
 Nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe) 
 (No' no' nothin' on you) 
 They might say hi (hi) and I might say hey (hey) 
 But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe) 
 (No' no' nothin' on you) 
 Nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe) 
 (No' no' nothin' on you) 
 Hands down there will never be another one 
 I been around and I never seen another one 
 Because your style I ain't really got nothin' on 
 And you wow when you got nothin' on? 
 Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes 
 And you keep it real while them other stay plastic 
 You're my Wonder Women call me Mr. Fantastic 
 Stop, now think about it 
 I've been to London, I've been to Paris 
 Even way out there in Tokyo 
 Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans 
 But you always steal the show (steal the show) 
 And just like that girl you got a fro (got a fro) 
 Like a Nintendo 64 (64) 
 If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know) 
 Beautiful girls all over the world (all over) 
 I could be chasing but my time would be wasted (haha)

 They might say hi (hi) and I might say hey (hey) 
 But you shouldn't worry about what they say (why?) 
 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby

 Nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe) 
 (No' no' nothin' on you) 
 Everywhere I go I'm always hearing your name (name, name) 
 And no matter where I'm at girl you make me wanna sing (sing) 
 Whether a bus or a plane (plane) or a car or a train (train) 
 No other girls in my brain and you the one to blame (blame) 
 Beautiful girls all over the world (all over) 
 I could be chasing but my time would be wasted (why?) 
 They got nothin' on you baby

 Nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe)

 They might say hi (hi) and I might say hey (hello) 
 But you shouldn't worry about what they say (why?) 
 'Cause they got nothin' on you baby 
 (No' no' no' nothin' on you babe)
