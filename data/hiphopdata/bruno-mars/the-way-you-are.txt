Intro (J. Reyez): 
 All right, I do this for all of you. 
 I make music for love, the love of everything. 
 J. Reyez... Bruno Mars... 
 C'mon! 
 Verse 1 (J. Reyez): 
 When I wake up next to you girl 
 It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds 
 You're beautiful and you're always shining 
 Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds 
 Many people are there, but you're worth keeping 
 The same letters, three words and one meaning 
 I love you, but we have our little arguments 
 That don't stop until we forgot who started it 
 I blank out and the thoughts around in me 
 You and I, every time you smiled at me 
 And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you 
 Your eyes, the world I see in you 
 And time never goes to waste, 
 Don't change, 'cause you can never be replaced 
 This love, you can never rearrange 
 Everytime when I see your face. 
 Refrain (Bruno Mars): 
 When I see your face 
 There's not a thing that I would change 
 'Cause you're amazing 
 Just the way you are 
 And when you smile 
 The whole world stops and stares for a while 
 'Cause girl you're amazing 
 Just the way you are. 
 Verse 2 (J. Reyez): 
 Just the way you express with "ing" girl 
 You're nothing short of my everything 
 And every memory so sentimental 
 Your happiness is my essential 
 This a way for me to say thanks 
 No stress, I want you to give me strength 
 When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect 
 But to the world you're just one person 
 But to that person you mean the world is just 
 How we ride, me and my girl, uh. 
 We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit 
 We fall together, we coincided 
 The way to my heart it was hard to find it 
 But you found dead deep down inside of this love 
 You can never rearrange, 
 Everytime when I see your face. 
 Refrain (Bruno Mars): 
 When I see your face 
 There's not a thing that I would change 
 'Cause you're amazing 
 Just the way you are 
 And when you smile 
 The whole world stops and stares for a while 
 'Cause girl you're amazing 
 Just the way you are 
 The way you are (x2) 
 Girl you're amazing, just the way you are 
 When I see your face 
 There's not a thing that I would change 
 'Cause you're amazing 
 Just the way you are 
 And when you smile 
 The whole world stops and stares for a while 
 'Cause girl you're amazing 
 Just the way you are 
 Yeah-ah.
