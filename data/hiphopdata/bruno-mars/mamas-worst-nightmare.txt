1, 2, 3 ooh 
 He drives a motorcycle, tattoo's everywhere 
 He got a long wraped sheet, that's right my baby ain't scared 
 And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh 
 And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love 
 I know some girls like good boys, 
 But they just move too slow 
 You see, I like dangerous it gives me such a rush 
 That's why I won't let you go 
 Oh no, 
 I know loving you is so wrong 
 But hiding you just seems so unfair 
 So I'm a take you home even though 
 You're my mamas worst nightmare 
 He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn 
 His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn 
 Everything around that bottom yeah, turns me on 
 We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long 
 I know some girls like good boys, 
 But they just move too slow 
 You see, I like dangerous it gives me such a rush 
 That's why I won't let you go 
 Oh no, 
 I know loving you is so wrong 
 But hiding you just seems so unfair 
 So I'm a take you home even though 
 You're my mamas worst nightmare 
 Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything 
 He'll never hurt me? 
 Mamma don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown 
 And I fallen in love 
 Oh no, 
 I know loving you is so wrong 
 But hiding you just seems so unfair 
 So I'm a take you home even though 
 You're my mamas worst nightmare
