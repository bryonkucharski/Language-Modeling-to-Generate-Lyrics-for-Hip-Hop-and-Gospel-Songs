 Jewell:

 Longtime mi watch ya mi wha chat to ya 
 And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me 
 So whappn Dre tell 'em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Creepin' down the back street on D's 
 I got my Glock cocked 'cause niggas want these 
 Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated 
 By some nigga with a Tec-9, tryin' to take mine 
 You wanna make noise, make noise 
 I make a phone call, my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys 
 Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf 
 With their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker, I'm Dre 
 So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day 
 Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches 
 And got sounds for the bitches 
 Cockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches 
 So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift 
 And no, this ain't Aerosmith 
 It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the C-P-T 
 On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G 
 Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip 
 I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop 
 Yeah, 'cause if it don't stop, I have to put my shit in reverse 
 Go back and take another stop 'cause I'm 
 (Rollin' in my '64) with all the niggas saying 
 George Clinton and Dr. Dre: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the niggas sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre so I begin like this 
 No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists 
 It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps 
 That gangsta shit makes a gang of snaps 
 Word to the motherfuckin' streets 
 And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats 
 That I hit ya with, that I get ya with 
 As I groove in my '4 on D's, hittin' the switches 
 Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on 
 Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on 
 But before I hit the dope spot 
 Gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin, and my soda pop 
 Now I'm smelling like Indonesia 
 Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers 
 On my dick 'cause my '4 on hit 
 Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit 
 So when I crawl, I comes correct 
 Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga 
 Now let the Chevrolet slide 
 As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side, yeah 
 (Rollin' in my '64) with all the bitches sayin' 
 George Clinton and Dr. Dre: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (You know what I'm sayin'?) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Check this out, the sun went down when I hit Slauson 
 On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin' 
 Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas they will do 
 Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools 
 Try to set me up for a 211 
 Fuck around and get caught up in a 187 
 But I don't represent no gangbang 
 Some niggas like lynchin' but I just watch 'em hang 
 So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on? 
 I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on 
 Didn't nobody wanna speak 
 Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street 
 "Is it Dre? Is it Dre?" that's what they say 
 Every single motherfuckin' day 
 Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it 
 While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin', I be 
 (Rollin' in my '64) with everybody sayin' 
 George Clinton and Dr. Dre: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With everybody sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 George Clinton: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
