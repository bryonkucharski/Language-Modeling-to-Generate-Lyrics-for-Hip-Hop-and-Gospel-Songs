 Rudy Ray Moore: 
 I wanna ask you one question 
 If I had some nuts, hangin' on the walls, what did I have honey? 
 I said, "Darling you'd have some walnuts" 
 She said, "Well, daddy if I had some nuts on my chest, would those be chestnuts?" 
 I said, "Hell yes" 
 She said, "Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin would those be chin-nuts?" 
 I said, "Hell no bitch, you'd have a dick in your mouth"

 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Back with some shit that gots to bump 
 As you pull up in the park you pops the trunk 
 Just to floss it like a motherfuker, clowning an' shit 
 Got the Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch 
 Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho 
 If she proper, I'mma pop her, the ho hopper 
 It's back on the track 
 With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack 
 (So Daz, step up on they ass 
 And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past) 
 Daz Dillinger and Snoop Dogg: 
 Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote 
 With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope 
 But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass 
 Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK 
 That I bring as I slang like cavy 
 Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy 
 Had he not known about the city I'm from 
 Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back 
 Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit 
 BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood 
 God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up 
 On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling 
 (But did you raise up all this nuts? 
 Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up)

 Where the niggas get they scrap on, don't nobody cap on 
 Slap on some D-R-E 
 Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G 
 Real G's who drop ki's 
 Protect these, N-U-T's, so nigga please 
 Peep out my manuscript 
 You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (Beeotch) 
 So recognize game from the gangsta 
 Thangs will remain the same until I change 'em
