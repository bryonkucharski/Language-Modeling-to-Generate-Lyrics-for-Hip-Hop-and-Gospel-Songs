Snoop Dogg: 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Dr. Dre: 
 I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright 
 We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night 
 Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats 
 And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets 
 Peep, the shit got deep and it was on 
 Number one song after number one song 
 Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat 
 I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at 
 But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do 
 Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two 
 And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing 
 Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doing ain't shit 
 Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 
 So now she's taking me to court 
 It's real conversation for your ass 
 So recognize, and pass to Daz 
 Daz Dilinger and Snoop Dogg: 
 Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood 
 Fucking hoes, clocking dough up to no good 
 We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks 
 (But we don't love them hoes) Bitch and it's like that 
 This is what you look for in a hoe who got cash flow 
 You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on 
 While you're chilling with your homies and shit 
 And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Beeotch) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Kurupt and Snoop Dogg: 
 To the store to get me a 4-0 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg paged that must mean more hoes 
 So I head down the street to Long Beach just so I could meet a freak 
 To lick me from my head to my feet 
 And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up 
 Nothing but homies around so I puts my gun up 
 Bitches on my nuts like clothes, heh 
 But I'm from the Pound and we don't love them hoes 
 How could you trust a hoe? (Why?) 'cause a hoe's a trick 
 We don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch 
 And my dick's constantly in her mouth 
 And turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 I once had a bitch named Mandy May 
 Used to be all in them guts like every day 
 The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung 
 I was in love like a motherfucker licking the pearl tongue 
 The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good 
 But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood 
 So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine 
 Guess what? Got gaffled by one time 
 I'm back to the motherfucking county jail 
 Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail 
 I gets released on a hot sunny day 
 My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre 
 Scooped in a coupe, "Snoop we got news 
 Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues" 
 I ain't been out a second 
 And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin' 
 Move up the block as we groove down the block 
 See my girl's house, "Dre, pass the Glock" 
 Kick in the do', I look on the flo' 
 It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I uncock my shit 
 I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Jewell and Snoop Dogg: 
 (Bitches ain't shit) 
 Oh yeah 
 I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit) 
 But I and her know that they can't fade this 
 'Cause I'm doin' my own thang down with the swang (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang 
 I say you know you can't deal 'cause I'm a bitch that's real (Bitches ain't shit) 
 Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill 
 Because I don't give a fuck and I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit) 
 And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck 
 And now I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit) 
 But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah 
 Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes 
 All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', hoe 
 But they can't hang with my type on swang (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang 
 But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue 
 And then they're sprung and with the nuts hung (Bitches ain't shit)
