 I got mo' class than most of them, ran with the best of them 
 Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them 
 What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a 
 Where niggas die every day over some shit they say 
 Disconnected from the streets forever 
 As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whatever 
 I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately 
 And the bitches that wanna break me 
 If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath 
 Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash 
 'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G. 
 Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E. 
 Like Dub-C I'm rich rolling, pistol holding 
 Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rolling 
 Put the flame to the killer nigga 
 Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real 
 I'm hitting switches, making bitches eat bitches 
 See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures 
 I own acres, floor seats watching the Lakers 
 I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases 
 Knoc-turn'al: 
 Dedicated to all of those with big egos 
 Never faking, we get the dough and live legal 
 Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos 
 Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals 
 Dedicated to all of those with big egos 
 Never faking, we get the dough and live legal 
 Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos 
 Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos 
 Hittman: 
 I'll bust a Mr.Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy 
 Crashin' Flex on Tuesday's, harassing hoes at movies 
 Passing by with Uzis, like who you aiming at? 
 That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claiming that, rat-a-tat-tat 
 I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys 
 You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise 
 Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised 
 The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys 
 Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est 
 Hope they don't have to find out the hard way 
 Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way 
 We hitting hard, Hittman and Dre 
 You playing games? I suggest you know the rules 
 We putting guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels 
 Take yo honey and cruise to the snooty and snooze, cop booze 
 Pop coochie till the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews 
 That's sick, the Aftermath is we rule shit 
 I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me with no other 'bout to blow, motherfucker

 You look like AC Green 
 Bitch don't call here anymore 
 With feet like Ben Vereen's 
 Bitch don't call here anymore 
 No, no, no, no 
 Hittman: 
 What up? It's Hittman 
 I ain't at the crib right now 
 So you can leave your name and number after the beep 
 Unless it's Tammy's ugly ass, I ain't fucking with you
