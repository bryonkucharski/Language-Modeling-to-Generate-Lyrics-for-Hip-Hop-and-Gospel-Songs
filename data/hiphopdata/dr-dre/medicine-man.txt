Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news 
 (Yeah, about that...) 
 Candice Pillay 
 Don't let me find out, the bitch in you 
 Don't let me find out, the snitch in you 
 Fame and fortune 
 It's not your forte 
 Fuck the world now 
 I'm done with foreplay 
 Doctor's orders 
 Go fuck yourself 
 Take two a day 
 Set them on an overdose 
 And kill yourself 
 Doctor's orders 
 Dr. Dre 
 Listen, this is my evaluation 
 This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated 
 Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated 
 Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating 
 Ain't nobody graduating 
 Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it 
 That's why I gotta hate it 
 Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration 
 Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated 
 Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools 
 The police got our name in all they databases 
 Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two 
 Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages 
 Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on? 
 These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix 
 It's looking like a sign of the revelation 
 'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest 
 I got all these patients man, how come they ain't patient with me? 
 They just think I want the money, why? 
 When I can't take it with me 
 Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not 
 They gon' find out who you are, just admit 'fore you get admitted 
 Anderson .Paak 
 Say, what you living about 
 Fuck you gon' tell me 
 Do you remember how you started out though 
 You looking lost now 
 (You want a pass, oh damn) 
 Fake it till you make it 
 Take your little paper book 
 When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now 
 I'd rather be hated on for who I am 
 Than to be loved for who I'm not 
 That's word to doc

 Eminem (Candice Pillay) 
 In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem 
 I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off 
 Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf 
 Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant 
 But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet 
 No one really gave a fuck about my descent, till I took off 
 Mistook me because I look soft 
 But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders) 
 So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off 
 Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls 
 I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls 
 And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all 
 You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls 
 And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone 
 My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls 
 And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls 
 Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter 
 I'm going in, already got an arm and head 
 And whoever said word are just words 
 Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck 
 Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit 
 Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned 
 In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like 
 They didn't deserve what they get 
 And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it 
 So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it? 
 And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime 
 As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind 
 I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine 
 Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find 
 I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines 
 I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind 
 All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's) 
 Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time 
 Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh 
 Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun 
 Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none 
 I even make the bitches I rape cum 
 I'm waiting on someone to say something 
 Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake 
 I spit it straight through, this is take one 
 The moment you're waiting for has come but...
