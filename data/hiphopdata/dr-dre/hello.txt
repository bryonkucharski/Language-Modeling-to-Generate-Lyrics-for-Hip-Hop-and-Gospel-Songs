 The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto 
 Full of magazines full clips and heavy metal 
 When the smoke settle, I'm just lookin' for a big yellow 
 And six inch stelletows 
 Dr. Dre (hello) perculatin' keep 'em waitin' 
 While you sittin' here hatin', your bitch is hyperventillatin' 
 Hopin' that we pentratin', you gets natin' 'cause I never been to Satan 
 The hardcore administrating gang bang affiliatin' 
 MC Ren will have you wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon 
 (Get the dollar) 
 9 1 1 emergency 
 (And you can tell 'em) 
 It's my son he's hurtin' me 
 (And he's a felon) 
 On parole for robbery, ain't no copin' a plea, ain't no stopin' a G 
 I'm in the six you got to hop in the three, company monopoly 
 You handle shit slopilly I drop a key properly 
 They call me the Don Daada, pop a colla, drop a dolla if you hear me 
 You can hollar even rock wilders, folla, the impala 
 Want to talk about this concrete nigga I'm a scholar the incredible 
 Hetero-sexual, credible, beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible 
 Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit while you hand pick motherfuckers 
 Givin' up transcripts

 Villain blows up your spot 
 Take your notebook your bitch and your glock 
 This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock 
 You slaped her ass that's alarming, 'cause she want my worm like Common 
 We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas run trains on goldiggers 
 Beware these four niggas, scare motherfuckers like Steven King flicks 
 Makin' niggas clear the room like a dike flea a dick 
 Make executive none shit, nigga like quick 
 So when I bomb first nigga who you rollin' with? 
 Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck your fine ass bitch 
 'Cause you could loose it in a tussle nigga watch me hustle 
 Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle, bitches 
 All in the back they knees waitin' to buckle 
 Same time same channel don't change the dial 
 Niggas for life, fuckin' your wife these niggas wild

 Did I fall off? 
 Got you in your room rippin' every chronic poster on your wall off 
 Just 'cause I put away the sawed off 
 Now I got you sitin' back with a smirk listenin' with your arms crossed 
 Questioning Dre's credibility (What?) 
 Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits, y'all be killin' me 
 As if I need to make mo' 
 I got a mansion and six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick 
 (Hello) 
 We came a long way from not giving a fuck 
 Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up 
 Now we got the whole world starstruck, 
 Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck 
 Motherfucker I'm Dre, I don't need your respect 
 I don't need to make another album bitch I ain't gotta do shit 
 I do it because I want to not to stay in the game 
 Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same lil' bitch!
