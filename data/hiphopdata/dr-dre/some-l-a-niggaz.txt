MC Ren and Time Bomb: 
 Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker 
 (West West y'all) 
 Yeah, LA niggas 
 LA niggas rule the world nigga 
 Y'all niggas gotta recognize, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Niggas don't wanna peep game, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 But this shit come all the way back around here 
 My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass 
 You know what I'm sayin'? You gotta recognize 
 LA niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga 
 Recognize this, peep game 
 Time Bomb: 
 Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag 
 Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag 
 G'd up from the feet up 
 Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up 
 Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' till we threw up (Till we threw up) 
 At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up 
 Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up 
 You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up 
 But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you 
 Now there's another motherfucker with no future 
 But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba 
 Got 'em jumpin' Disciples to the Hoover 
 King T: 
 I'm coming straight outta Compton with a loose cannon 
 Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner 
 Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch 
 From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha 
 Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting with Tha Liks and Hittman bought a fix 
 Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch, hear it tick, tick, tick, tick 
 Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic 
 Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it 
 From sundown to sun-up, clown and run up 
 The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what? 
 Knoc-Turn'al and Kokane: 
 We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink, and pack heat 
 Requirements for survival each day in LA 
 It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops 
 Analyze why we act this way in LA 
 Hittman: 
 Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move 
 They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do, cock me back 
 Bust caps for my Macz Crew at Fairfax 
 Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true 
 But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you 
 Blast you for that set you claim (Where you from?) 
 Mash on you for your Turkish chain, CK BK 
 Blue'd up or flame, I ran with a gang 
 I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's 
 My pants hang below my waistline 
 I look humble wanna rumble? (Yeah yeah) 
 I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline, don't waste my time 
 Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and nine's 
 One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches 
 Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches 
 Xzibit: 
 I was raised in the hood called What-the-Diff' 
 Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood 
 Slugs for the fuck of it 
 Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick 
 If I catch you touching mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor 
 Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore 
 It's AvireX-to-the-Z 
 Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV 
 Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time 
 Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie 
 What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health 
 Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself 
 Defari: 
 Five in the mornin', burglars at my do' 
 Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer 
 Let 'em come in, blaow, he see the thunder roll 
 Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo' 
 And brew's by the case 
 Slap you in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced 
 Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings 
 Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings 
 Knoc-Turn'al and Kokane: 
 We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink, and pack heat 
 Requirements for survival each day in LA 
 It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops 
 Analyze why we act this way in LA 
 That's how we ride 
 That's how we ride 
 That's how we ride 
 That's how we ride
