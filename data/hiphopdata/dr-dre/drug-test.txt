I'm in this mothafucker doing what I wanna 
 Ten bottles, teb bitches, go with my persona 
 Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts 
 I'm that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts 
 (Baby got ass, I need me a shot of that 
 Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag) 
 That's right, she's got something that I wanna see 
 That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me 
 That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something 
 She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming 
 They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something 
 Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something 
 Club filled with dead bodies 
 If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry 
 You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted 
 Do what you wanna do, drug test on you 
 Lotta money when I talk 
 Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault 
 Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt 
 They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel 
 I fear she just might just pop that pill 
 And feel on me all night till the tip spill 
 Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line 
 She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time 
 Blow right, hoes fight over my name 
 I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins 
 It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain 
 I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good 
 If you got drugs in this motherfucker 
 Let me see your hands in the air 
 Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us 
 So let's get high off something 
 High of something, high of something 
 Till your mothafucking brain don't function 
 High of something, high of something 
 Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape 
 Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss 
 Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card 
 Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill 
 I feel she might just get too faded 
 X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it 
 To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan 
 For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and 
 May I, kick a little something for G's and 
 Make a few ends as I breeze through? 
 The shit on my hip is a fucking preview 
 And guess what it lead to 
 Yeah DJ Khalil lets go
