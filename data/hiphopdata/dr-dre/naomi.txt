Now walk it like that chick Naomi 
 I wanna hit it till da morning 
 Let me get up in da middle like monie 
 Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie 
 Girl I got a suggestion 
 Hop ya ass in the car 
 And don't ask me no questions 
 Ay yo, driver pay attention 
 What you lookin' in the rear view for huh, Benson 
 I shoulda pulled out the Bentley Coupe 
 The GT seats look like Campbell Soup 
 Mmm, mmm, good you so lovely 
 You say you from the hood 
 You sayin' Dre thug me 
 You want it wit ya iPod on 
 So you can get hip to all my songs 
 And we can do it to the beat 
 It goes boom boom boom boom skeet 
 Now hoe you like that ma? 
 The way she screamin' had me thinking

 Naw dog I ain't the one to fuck wit neither 
 And she so hot, I got the fever 
 On my side, yep that's where I keep her 
 Clip full of Z's you can catch some sleep bro 
 I'm from a city where dey slap dey cheeks 
 And do tricks on a pole sit in ya lap and speak to ya 
 Pay attention this a motion feature 
 Starrin' me and the butt naked slim bo-legged Skeeza 
 She goin' downtown like SWV, um 
 That's a little dated wait let me update it 
 Think Monica Louinski, Paris and Moesha 
 Head in the hotel sippin' brandy smokin' reefa 
 And I'm so high ya boi don't lie 
 That's my homie crack's phantom, I don't own that ride 
 But I got some black Trojans and it goes quite nice 
 And what's under ya underneath, ya la perla, I can go all night
