I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock on with my bad self 'cause it's a must 
 It's the Lady Of Rage still kicking up dust 
 So umm, let me loosen up my bra strap 
 And umm, let me boost ya with my raw rap 
 'Cause I'm-a break it down to the nitty-gritty one time 
 When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine 
 Busy as a beaver, ya best believer 
 This grand diva's runnin' shit with the speed of a cheetah, meet a 
 Lyrical murderer, I'm servin' 'em like two scoops of chocolate 
 Check it how I rock it 
 I'm the one that's throwin' bolos, ya better roll a Rolo 
 To find out I'm the number one solo, uh 
 The capital are-A now take it to the G-E 
 I bring the things to light, but you still can't see me 
 I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style 
 For those that try to punk me, here's a Pamprin child 
 No need to say mo', check the flow 
 Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 Now I'm hittin MC's like Hoo-yu-ken! 
 Ain't no doubt about it, I'm the undisputed 
 So what you uh, wanna do is back on up 
 I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks 
 So put your money on the bread winner 
 I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners 
 I got the tongue that has outdone anyone 
 From the rising to the setting of the sun 
 Or the moon, I consume the room with doom 
 When I hear the kick of a 808 bass, poom 
 Boom, bam, God, damn! 
 I'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks 
 Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk 
 Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give em 
 Let it hit em, split em, did it now I'm rid of em, yeah 
 I put that on my unborn kids 
 Rage in effect so you know how it is 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you 
 Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit 
 Oh shit, I'm the shit! 
 You can't get with the Rage then tough tit-ty 
 I pi-ty the fool, that gets 
 With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude (ooh!) 
 You wanna get with the wickedness, with that 
 Big body girl that's kickin it, rippin it apart like Jason 
 You'll be chasin a dream like Freddy 
 Are you ready for the cream de la creme? 
 I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up 
 I keep competitors stuck 
 In the muck with they butt up, what you wanna nut up 
 Like cashew, don't you know that I will mash you? For real, 
 That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA 
 (So what you gotta say?) 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs (Rage!) 
 Rock on with your bad self 
 Huh

 I am the toughest, toughest, toughest (Rage!) 
 I am the roughest, roughest, roughest (Say what? Say what?) 
 I am the toughest, toughest, toughest (Rage!) 
 I am the roughest, roughest, roughest (Say what? Say what?) 
 I am the toughest, toughest, toughest (Rage!)

 Yeah, one-nine-nine-four 
 The indo blow and the grass grow 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a hoe 
 But you gotta give credit when credit is due 
 Women back down and bow down to my motherfucking homegirl 
 The Lady Of Rage 
 She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs 
 Handcuffed and she busts 
 And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up 
 You know what I'm saying?
