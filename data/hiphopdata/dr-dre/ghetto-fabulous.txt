Artist: Ras Kass featuring Dr. Dre, Ice-T, Mack 10 
 [Ice-T] I got juice but I can't stop no ocean liner baby! 
 [Ras] I'm down with you baby, I'm there 
 [Ice-T] Man don't miss this it's gonna be FABULOUS 
 ... 
 [Ras] We ghetto fabulous baby 
 The best food, drink, and women that money can buy 
 Verse One: Ras Kass 
 Every day of my life is off the ringer 
 That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer 
 I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava 
 So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars 
 From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C. 
 *Girls laughing* to beep beep 
 Bangin', catch me with a dimepiece next to me 
 My Body all over Your Body like LSG 
 Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor 
 Rookies askin us how to be a playa 
 Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked 
 No matter how much money you make 
 Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes 
 In jeans and tennis shoes, breakin your strict dress codes 
 Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen deep 
 So I can be richer than Master P sellin Ghetto D 
 Chorus: Mack 10 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Money make the world go round so let's handle this 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Broadcastin live from Los Angeles 
 We ghetto, fabulous 
 Money make the world go round so let's handle this 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Broadcastin live from Los Angeles 
 Verse Two: Dr. Dre 
 You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough 
 Started in Compton servin' from a ice cream truck 
 Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator 
 Steppin on your toes playa, stuffin up your alligators 
 I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me 
 Boom bap and slap that ass silly 
 This is for the full time students slash part time strippers 
 And young niggaz, clockin at least five figures 
 Some of us pro atheletes, some of us rap over fat beats 
 Some of us hustle in the streets 
 Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle 
 [???] Off a pocket full of singles, huh 
 And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra 
 Pop a thirteen shot glock to make you Go See the Doctor 
 Ain't nuttin nice 
 From hood to hood, love livin' the lavish life 
 Verse Three: Ras Kass 
 Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS, three ooh ooh 
 Playin' number two Tekken, zero to sixty 
 In six point seven seconds *tires screech* hangin' out the window 
 Actin' up, chickenheads like "You doin' fo' months!" 
 Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds 
 Across the face, still eatin out foam cups and paper plates 
 We don't call it playa hatin' in the nine-eight, it's P.I. 
 That's pass intereference, automatic first down 
 Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown 
 Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin' DK 
 Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say 
 "L.A. niggaz got crazy came 
 Like John Elway got a superbowl ring" 
 The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda 
 Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella
