 Dr. Dre 
 Yeah, I mean, I listen to these rap records 
 Half the time I'm suspicious 
 You niggas sound so fictitious 
 Believe me I know the difference 
 I got some words for you niggas 
 You're the definition of (Satisfiction) 
 Listen up, I been where you're going three times and plus 
 Big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around us 
 Motherfucker uh, I seen it all and guess what 
 It's the (Satisfiction) you feel me? 
 King Mez 
 Oh yeah, I see what you're saying 
 I know some niggas just like that 
 Frontin' ass niggas man, really ain't got no bucks like that 
 Stuck like that, its cool if you cool gettin' love like that 
 Flashin' down the Southside Raleigh 
 You'll be runnin' outta luck like that 
 What I mean by that is 
 Why your name always in these rental records 
 Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section 
 You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse 
 No she leavin' if you run outta paper 
 And might be smashin' your neighbor 
 I know you think you're a star cause followers clickin' 
 Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition 
 Like sneaker shoppin' summer you niggas are fuckin' sickenin' 
 'Cause you'll take your soul out, just so you can fit in

 Snoop Dogg 
 'Cause, fuck wrong with these niggas 
 These labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas 
 Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy nigga 
 And change this fuckin' music shit my nigga, you should consider 
 Nah, I'll be doin' me lokin, keepin' these bad bitches open 
 And keeping them wet yep, see 'cause Long Beach right by that ocean 
 Still sippin' that gin and juice my nigga, yep I'm still on that potion 
 All these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm stil gettin' noticed 
 God damn man, how we s'posed to handle this shit, cuh 
 Everything we done built these niggas dismantled this shit, cuh 
 We gotta get back to that real, that's on the dub 
 Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what what what? 
 Dr. Dre (Marsha Ambrosius) 
 (I'm just stating the facts 
 Don't get no realer than that 
 Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player) 
 Shouldn't be too hard my nigga 
 Supposed to be like a lay up 
 It shouldn't be so hard to be yourself 
 My nigga wake up 
 Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up 
 That's what I'm made of, high? Yup 
 My life is all authentic, that's why I'm goin' way up 
 Your satisfaction is fictitious, your happiness is made up
