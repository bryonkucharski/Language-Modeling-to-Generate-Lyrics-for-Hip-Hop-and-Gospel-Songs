So, all of you Africans, all of you Africans that wanna do thangs that's workin' for other people, y'all need to open your own business 
 Save your money 
 Quit payin' motherfuckers for jheri curls 
 Quit payin' motherfuckers for perms 
 Save your money, start your own business, and you true Africans, will have put hundreds to work 
 This is our future right here, this out future right here 
 (This some shit 
 The new generation is on 
 The new generation) 
 Hey, I'mma tell you right now, if-if if I have to die today, for this little African right here, to have a future I'm a dead motherfucker (You right) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Wake up, jumped out my bed 
 I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead 
 Murder was the case that they gave me 
 Dear God, I wonder can you save me 
 I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck 
 It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
 But that's the life of a G, I guess 
 Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest 
 Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
 Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
 Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs 
 Gettin' a rep as a young hog 
 It ain't nothin' like the street life 
 You better be strapped with yo' shank 'cause ain't no fist fight 
 So I guess I gots ta handle mine 
 Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Them say me grow up to be nothin', look at me now and tell me what you see 
 I am what I am, it's only me 
 (Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets 
 What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Now, I'm holdin' a dub, sitting on swoll 
 Twenty-seven years old, off on parole, stroll 
 I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money 
 That I'll be making as soon as I touch the streets 
 Things done changed on this side 
 Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
 But it ain't no thing to me 
 'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG 
 The little homies from the hood with grip 
 Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip 
 Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatchu wanna do 
 Didn't know he had a .22 
 Straight sitting behind his back 
 I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps 
 I fell to the ground with blood on my hands, I didn't understand 
 How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
 I used to be the same way back 
 I guess that's what I get (For what?) 
 For trying to jack them little homies for they grip 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Me learn many things from what me on the street 
 The outcome of what I've come to be 
 (Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets 
 Whatchu gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Something for the real OG's to get with 
 Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play 
 Like every single day, really doe 
 You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie 
 No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
 And learning just enuff to keep your sack right 
 Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
 Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
 Seven young G's but they serve down 
 In a G ride, east side where they swerve now 
 Not thinking about what's really going on 
 Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
 I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me 
 But now I'm back at the pound 
 And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
 Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
 So make all them ends you can make 
 'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
 So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
 'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG 
 For life and always remain to be 
 (Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets 
 What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)
