I'mma say this and I'mma end mine 
 If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period point blank 
 If you ain't down for the ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit 
 Devil you need to step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in and start puttin' some funk in that ass 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 Daz Dillinger: 
 Them wonder why me violent and no really understand 
 For the reason why me take me law in me own hand 
 Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King 
 The gun goes click, me gun goes bang 
 Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach 
 Them riot in LA 'cause them no really wanna see 
 Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot 
 Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut 
 Me don't show no love 'cause it's us against them 
 Them never ever love me 'cause it's sport to break them 
 And kill, at my own risk, if I may 
 To lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest 
 Yes we have 
 There have been riots, ah uh, rioting 
 Well I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown 
 But right now Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street 
 Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One: 
 How many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do? 
 I said how many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine) 
 What they told us today, in other words, you're still a slave 
 No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit 
 Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger: 
 Sitting in my living room, calm and collected 
 Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective 
 'Cause what I just heard, broke me in half 
 And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing 
 Laugh now but cry much later 
 You see when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us 
 Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles 
 They found that they couldn't handle us 
 Bloods, Crips on the same squad 
 With the ese's help and, nigga it's time to rob and mob 
 (And break the white man off something lovely 
 I don't love them so them can't love me) 
 Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on 
 It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on 
 And come up on me some furniture or somethin' 
 Got a VCR in the back of my car 
 That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet 
 And motherfuckers better not try to stop me 
 'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped 
 'Cause I'mma cock my glock and pop till they all drop 
 (There has been videotape and you can see of the, ah, some of the crowd throwing things at the officers) 
 And swinging at them as well 
 Like there was a young woman there 
 You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand 
 Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One: 
 How many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do? 
 I said how many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine) 
 RBX: 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 One-time trigger happy, no nigga love 
 One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove 
 Can't get prints on a nine I throw away 
 Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray 
 Pop, pop, pop, another motherfucker drop 
 And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz 
 Smash, I crashed his head like a window 
 I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo 
 Creepin', with the quickness to the cut 
 Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut 
 And crack-up, so now he best to back up 
 I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up 
 I zip up-town but motherfuckin' cops are all around 
 Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin' 
 To catch me and stretch me on Death Row 
 But hell no, suppose black refuse to go 
 This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited 
 I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Daz Dillinger: 
 The outcome of this is destruction so them all fall 
 Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall 
 The description of three blacks 
 Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right 
 If you riot again, me turn the other cheek 
 We be too many, me got me nine to my side 
 So me bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck and me don't give a fuck 
 And all my problems end with that buck, buck 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Blam, blam, blam to till them fall 
 Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye 
 Dr. Dre, him bust gunshots 
 Diggidy Daz and RBX them bust gunshots, come again
