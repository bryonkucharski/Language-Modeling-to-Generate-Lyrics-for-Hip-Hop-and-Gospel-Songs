Hey, yeah, hell yeah 
 Heh, know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yeah 
 Mista Busta, where the fuck you at? 
 Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat 
 Your dick on hard, from fuckin' your road dogs 
 The hood you threw up with, niggas you grew up with 
 Don't even respect your ass 
 That's why it's time for the doctor, to check your ass, nigga 
 Used to be my homie, used to be my ace 
 Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth 
 Make ya bow down to the Row 
 Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, little ho 
 Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide 
 Let me ride, just another homicide 
 Yeah, it's me so I'mma talk on 
 Stomping on the Eazy-est streets that you can't walk on 
 So strap on your Compton hat, your locs 
 And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc 
 And pass the bud and stay low-key 
 B.G. 'cause you lost all your homie's love 
 Now call it what you want to 
 You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you 
 Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about 
 We have your motherfuckin' record company surrounded 
 Put down the candy and let the little boy go 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Punk motherfucker (We want Eazy, we want Eazy) 
 (We want Eazy, we want Eazy) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay 
 Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house 
 Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay 
 Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house 
 Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay 
 The sounds of a dog brings me to another day 
 Play with my bone, would ya Timmy? 
 It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy 
 But here's a jimmy joke about your momma that you might not like 
 I heard she was the 'Frisco dyke 
 But fuck your mama, I'm talking about you and me 
 Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T 
 Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious 
 And them rhymes you were kicking were quite bootylicious 
 You get with Doggy Dogg, oh is he crazy? 
 With your mama and your daddy hollering, "Baby" 
 So won't they let you know 
 That if you fuck with Dre, nigga you're fuckin' wit Death Row 
 And I ain't even slanging them thangs 
 I'm hollering 187 with my dick in your mouth, beeotch 
 RBX: 
 Yeah nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker 
 So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin cranium cracked nigga 
 Step on up. Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke so remember the name 
 Mighty, mighty D-R, yeah, motherfucker 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 (Now understand this: my nigga Dre can't be touched) 
 Luke's bending over (Luke's getting fucked, busta) 
 Must've thought I was sleazy 
 Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy 
 (Animosity made you speak what you spoke) 
 (Ayo Dre) What up? (Check this nigga off, loc) 
 If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with 
 Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit 
 (With my nuts on your tonsils) 
 (While you're onstage rapping at your wack-ass concerts) 
 And I'mma snatch your ass from the backside 
 To show you how Death Row pull off that hoo-ride 
 (Now you might not understand me) 
 'Cause I'mma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami 
 (Then we gonna creep to South Central) 
 (On a Street Knowledge mission) As I steps in the temple 
 Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap 
 Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat 
 (You trying to check my homey, you better check yourself) 
 ('Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself) 
 Motherfucker (Yeah, nigga) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Yeah, nine-deuce 
 Dr. Dre, dropping chronic once again 
 It don't stop, punishing punk motherfuckers real quick like 
 Doggy Dogg in the motherfuckin' house 
 Long Beach in the motherfuckin' house 
 Compton style nigga, straight up, really tho 
 Breaking all you suckas off something real proper like 
 You know what I'm sayin'?
