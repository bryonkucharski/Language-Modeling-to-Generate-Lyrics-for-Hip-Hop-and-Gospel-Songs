As the world keeps turning, chronic keeps burning 
 (This ain't no) street sermon, these niggas are determined 
 I flow like CD's in the deck 
 Moosh fools in the face that lack respect 
 Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk 
 I deodirise the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G 
 So leave me alone I'm in the zone 
 Walkin' the streets on my own, nigga get blown 
 Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone 
 But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone 
 Are you gone bust or play bones? 
 You motherfuckin clone, get off that nigga's style and get'cha own 
 It's Miscellane and it's on again 
 For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step 
 And kept ya big fuckin' mouth shut 
 I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache 
 Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong 
 My world is gone like disco 
 Blowin' up Cisco and in my Cammo 
 Standin in back of me was my soul 
 Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll 
 Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold 
 A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick 
 Shaky bitches off the dick 
 'Cause she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips 
 I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools 
 Show me the one talkin' shit so I can drop a fool 
 I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM 
 Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G 
 I really dream of gettin' mine now let me tell you what's silly 
 Me, buckin with my team is murder one 
 I heard a gun bustin' shots (SHOTS!), down the block (BLOCK!) 
 I guess a nigga gettin' what he got (GOT!) 
 Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas 
 I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call 
 To a trick that didn't even care 
 'Cause she was gettin' fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there 
 Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga) 
 Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga) 
 You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real) 
 Shit is for real 
 I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper 
 And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes 
 Let's take it back to the first side 
 When you was a new jack and jockin my new track 
 But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long 
 Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard 
 Witta teenage group I'm turnin' loots to tracks 
 Me and my niggas like (These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight 
 Lyrics) 
 You wanna know what the hos used to do 
 When me and my crew came bustin' through 
 All sorts of blushins brew 
 (A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew) 
 Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue 
 This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front 
 I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on 
 Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan 
 Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau 
 Now that's three times your tightest flow 
 And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack 
 Three times is clever (BUCK!) 
 Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt 
 Barely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt 
 To art in hell, where the next man dwells 
 The place with stankin pussy and crack rock dwells
