 What'chu want? 
 What'chu want? 
 Get off me 
 I pull quick, it's useless 
 I'm fully clipped, 6 fo' fully dipped 
 Throw chrome whip with three freaks and full hips with firm tits 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Yeah we fully chipped, been on gangsta shit 
 It's ruthless, drunk off toothless 
 Who make hits? (Dre) 
 (Knoc-turn'al) 
 Who we wit? (Knoc) 
 Westcoast parties don't stop 
 Who drop head-boppers? 
 (The head doctor, bed-rocker) 
 Police pursue me in squad cars and helicopters 
 Checkin' lockers, Mexican connect to play soccer 
 PH's and cockblockers 
 Ho-hoppers, weez niggaz is off the rocker 
 Sippin' cranberry juice on rocks with vodka 
 With 'Pac and Poppa, and Red Foxx's doctor (fo' real?) 
 Takin' names and takin' orders 
 Ya fake ya name, and I'm all up on ya 
 Nigga that's California 
 Palm trees and 6-3's on deez 
 Rims dip to make the spokes gold-a 
 Slangin boulders, thought I told ya 
 True soldiers, comin' from the motherfuckin shoulders (WOOP!) 
 (Missy Elliott) 
 Whooo, Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin 'cops'! 
 Bow down when ya see-me! 
 Knoc the truth best believe-it! 
 Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than a freak who givin' head who won't 'stop'! 
 Bow down when ya pass through! 
 Knoc-turn'al God damn you! 
 (Knoc-turn'al) 
 What's the difference between us? (Nah not that again) 
 New songs, and new cars, and new broads, and new thongs 
 On Crenshaw Boulevard, Line 'em up at the bar 
 Girl you know who we are, hip-hop superstars 
 Roll deep? Nah, we roll hard and deep 
 Bogart yo beef get the fuck off my street 
 Get'cha motherfuckin ass beat 
 L.A., Compton, Long Beach, whooptie-whoop nigga what? 
 I don't give a fuck 
 Hustlers, hood-rats, sick-ass thugs, Crips and Bloods 
 (Hell nigg-uh!) All my real niggaz raise it up 
 Nuttin but dubs, you got a sack, nigga what? 
 Blaze it up 
 (Missy Elliott) 
 Whooo, Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin 'cops'! 
 Bow down when ya see-me! 
 Knoc the truth best believe-it! 
 Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than a freak who givin' head who won't 'stop'! 
 Bow down when ya pass through! 
 Knoc-turn'al God damn you?! 
 (Knoc-turn'al) 
 Bitch you ain't 'bout shit, my bad 
 Turn off the lights, don't trip 
 Give a nig' some ack right and act like' 
 You might... lick balls tonight 
 Girls all pause, hell nah, girls drop draws on site 
 Do drugs, shroom cups, smoke bud, all night 
 That's right, I like bi-sexual women, fuck dykes 
 Suck dick? No, but your father might 
 Fuckin' hermaphrodite! 
 Duck the IRS, fuckin' Howard Stern's wife 
 In traffic, bitch gave me head in real life 
 L.A. city lights, C.A. get it right 
 West-coast on the grind, these niggaz done lost they minds 
 Straight loungin in the sunshine 
 Here's one thing you bitch niggaz must know 
 Fuck you! Please believe that, and I mean that 
 (Missy Elliott) 
 Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin 'cops'! 
 Bow down when ya see-me! 
 Knoc the truth best believe-it! 
 Take it ea-sy! (ea-say) 
 'Cause it's the motherfuckin 'knoc'! 
 Hotter than a freak who givin' head who won't 'stop'! 
 Bow down when ya pass through! 
 Knoc-turn'al God damn you!
