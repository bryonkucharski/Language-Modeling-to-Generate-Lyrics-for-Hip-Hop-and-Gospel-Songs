Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Everyday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed 
 Niggaz still playa hatin', but Dre ain't changed 
 I'm just a lot smarter now 
 Cause these niggaz is bangin' ten times harder now 
 Niggaz ringin' they ass up in the wrong part of town 
 Better turn they car around 
 Rollin' the window down (Eminem: Hey can we talk it out?) 
 (Hitt: NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!) 
 Johnny got a shotgun 
 And he ain't even strong enough to cock one 
 Fuck tryin' to job hunt 
 Niggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier 
 Than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days 
 Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin' 
 Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin' a footprint 
 I think the attitudes are twice as worst 
 It takes half the time to get your life reversed 
 Always tryin' to play Rambo with they ammo 
 Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! 
 (Knoc-turn'al) 
 Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by 
 Murder arrives, anytime 
 Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites 
 Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light 
 Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics 
 Bustin' on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates 
 These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block 
 Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop 
 On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin 
 You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's 
 Makin' death not so foreign to ya 
 Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough, 
 Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese 
 I've learned to stay away from house parties 
 I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin' 
 Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on 
 Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! 
 (Hittman) 
 Now tell me - what the fuck is this man? 
 Niggaz doin' brothers in worse than the Klan 
 Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill 
 Without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill 
 Blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs 
 Fillin the sky, usually drillin the one 
 That wasn't willin' to die, yes sir in the Killing Field 
 I got my, life preserver 
 And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to 
 Question me - 'bout the colors that I got on? 
 Now see that red dot on your knot 
 'Bout to get your whole crew shot on 
 A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on 
 Took him out on the spot before he even got on 
 My hitlist -- peep this 
 I cock back, you bow down 
 Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is 
 Bang bang! bang bang!
