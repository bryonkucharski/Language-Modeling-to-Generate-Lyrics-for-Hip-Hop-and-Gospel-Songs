Hi, baby, I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work 
 And all, and I do understand 
 You have no idea how much I understand 
 But you also don't have any idea how much I love you 
 I love you so much 
 I think about you, I feel you in my arms 
 I miss you, I miss you terribly 
 I've just always wanted someone like you in my life 
 I love you so much that I'd do anything 
 I'd do anything, I'll be your perfect woman for you 
 I just wanna fuck bad bitches 
 All them nights I never had bitches 
 Now I'm all up in that ass bitches 
 Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha? 
 You're a bad girl, gotta spank ya 
 Gotta thank ya for that head clinic 
 Explicit, hella photogenic 
 And tell your friends where the dick's at 
 Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate 
 Before you kiss 'em use Colgate 
 She Swallowed It, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight 
 And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it 
 And Hit the Man hit it, damn bitches 
 Man, this is what I'm talkin' about 
 Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth 
 Out and about with your nigga like it never took place 
 Airtouched next time you need a taste 
 I just wanna fuck you 
 No touchin' and rubbin' gul, you got a husband who loves you 
 Don't need you all in mine, I just wanna fuck you 
 We can't be kissin' and huggin' gul, you got a husband who 
 Loves you, you need to give him your quality time 
 You got the number, it's on you to make the call 
 You know I cum quick, help you re-decorate your walls 
 Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock 
 And if I'm goin' too far, I take it out and wipe it off 
 And put it back up, and keep goin' 
 You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin' 
 That your pussy's been tampered with 
 Did you show him the new trick of 
 How you can make it smoke a cancer stick 
 You be workin' it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me 
 Not to give you all of my time, that you wanted 
 You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed 
 I'd rather spend my mornin' diggin' through some records instead 
 But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases 
 Hookup somewhere and exchange some 'Fuck Faces' 
 I know your man's lookin' for ya, he's always tryin' to run ya 
 Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin' gul 'cause I just wanna fuck witchu 
 Fuck witchu, on the sneak tip, on some creep shit 
 So whatcha gon do, ya freak bitch? 
 You, actin', like you, don't, do, dicks 
 That's the kinda bitch, I hate fuckin' wit 
 Baby was a virgin, that's what she said 
 So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head 
 I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed 
 Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head 
 Take that bitch home, and give her a bone 
 And give her the number to my cellular phone 
 Man, she blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major 
 A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her 
 Somethin' to go by, and bitches know why 
 Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out, see-ya 
 Twenty-fo' seven, Dre, Snoop, and Devin 
 We servin' these hoes, and never lovin' these hoes, beotch 
 I just wanna fuck you 
 No touchin' and rubbin' gul, you got a husband who loves you 
 Don't need you all in mine, I just wanna fuck you 
 We can't be kissin' and huggin' gul, you got a husband who 
 Loves you, you need to give him your quality time
