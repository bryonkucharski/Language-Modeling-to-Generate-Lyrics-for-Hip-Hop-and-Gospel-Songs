He's Bionic! (x4) 
 He's Bionic! He's Bionic! He's Bionic, Bionic, Bionic, 
 Bionic! 
 He's Bionic! Ah Bionic! (x2) 
 Yella 
 There's no measure of the skills that are in his hands 
 People ask "Is he machine or man?" 
 Positions what he's called or just Dr Dre 
 People take a look 'cause he's your future DJ 
 When he cuts the beat you all will know 
 Because his records start to smoke and then his 
 Turntables glow 
 If you're a sucka DJ then you'll have a comic 
 Step to the front if you like embarrassment 
 He's Bionic! Yes! 
 He's Bionic! So fresh! 
 Yella 
 Acquired the skill that you must learn 
 To become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn 
 Always seen wit you nurses by his side 
 And you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied 
 His supersonic speed is his ace in the hole 
 Over all the top DJ's, Dr Dre's in control 
 He operates in LA 'cause it's the place to be 
 He's B-I-O-N-I-C 
 He's Bionic! Yes! 
 He's Bionic! So fresh! 
 Yella 
 Now as the wheels start burnin and the mixer explodes 
 The wax from his discs will make you suckas corrode 
 Radiation level rises to degrees unknown 
 The circuits overloaded then your speakers are blown 
 Now ya hear a loud thunder that vibrates the ground 
 'Cause his hands are movin faster than the speed of sound 
 Everybody runs and they try to avoid 
 But it's too late 'cause the place is already destroyed 
 He's Bionic! Yes! 
 He's Bionic! So fresh! 
 He's Bionic!
