 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat 
 On the streets of LA, wonderin' where the pussy at 
 Straight player, looking for a ho 
 Hangin' out, rollin' in my '64 
 Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood 
 Seventeen shells so I make it understood 
 Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut 
 You come outside nigga you gettin' fucked up 
 But I told ya, creep, creep ya best move 
 Like Luther Vandross, fuckin' up the west coast 
 I'm right back up in ya when ya nut 
 One, two, three, nut, from the D-R-E but 
 This is for the hoes that I used to know 
 When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of dough 
 I keep ya this and like that and I

 Dr. Dre: 
 Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these 
 The chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block 
 And it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go 
 To the strip or take a trip bawlin' with the row 
 My shit off in your system attacks 
 Indo smoke go in your lungs, like that 
 You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb 
 Taken away like hell on Vietnam 
 California, back and on a mission 
 Provin' a point that my game ain't no fuckin' competition 
 They wishin' but run up on reality 
 CPT, CAL my locality 
 It's strange how I rearrange and change the business 
 By droppin' shit like this 
 Dope, niggas can't cope with the real 
 I peal, penitentiaries still, when I kill it goes

 Snoop Dogg: 
 Straight up. Now you niggas know where my homie comin' from 
 So quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool 
 It's nine-duece, Dr Drizzay, is sittin' on tizzop 
 It don't stop, treatin' buster's like a punk-ass cizzop, beeotch
