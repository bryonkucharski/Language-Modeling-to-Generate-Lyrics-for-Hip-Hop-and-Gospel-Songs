 For the love of money

 Jon Connor 
 Say what's up to the broke nigga at the rich party 
 Who the fuck let this nigga in? 
 Do I look like I give a fuck? Sorry 
 Looking at these hoes and they gold digger gorgeous tryna get me 
 I run game on a bitch, one Mississippi two Mississippi 
 Flint nigga in the spot till they pop one and the cops come like (woo!) 
 Motherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah 
 Still a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga till I'm gone 
 Do it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on 
 Fuck that shit nigga, fuck that shit go 
 Live for my hood, look this for my block 
 Ride for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac 
 I ain't got shit but I still feel good 
 Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got 
 Go hard in the paint, you can tell 'em post up 
 Homie in the hood like "let me hold something" 
 Your man's in the hood talking all that shit 
 When they ran up on him lil buddy froze up 
 All they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing 
 Niggas be talking that ain't what they want 
 Ain't no fake shit around here 
 Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck 
 I be killing this and not giving a fuck 
 You laugh at a bitch, she get hid in the trunk 
 You think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up 
 So this for my people who still in the cut

 Want that, need that 
 Root of all evil mayne, (get it, get it) 
 I said I want that, need that 
 The root of all evil, mayne 
 Dr. Dre (Anderson .Paak) 
 Said what's up to the nigga wearing all black at the white party 
 And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck 
 That's how I get down nigga sorry 
 And I'm looking like I don't play no games, nah, nigga don't try me 
 Been that nigga that's been spitting that 
 Paid dues like a motherfucking hobby 
 If you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me 
 Came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit 
 And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world 
 Damn, look at that body 
 She come along with the territories 
 Turn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story 
 (Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you) 
 Got a relationship with that money 
 (But that bitch will never be faithful to you) 
 Even though I know she knows she crazy 
 (Please just let it go, seize, no saving you) 
 Ride, ride 
 Till the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch 
 (But we can do it for the love) 
 But I'm never stopping my poppin' 
 (These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial 
 It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)
