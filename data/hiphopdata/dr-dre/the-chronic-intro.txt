 Yeah, with notorious Compton G D-R-E on a solo tip, fuck them other fools 
 What up, Ren? Yeah, dropping Chronic flakes on your ass, bitch 
 West Coast flavor 
 Niggas who talk shit get dealt with real quick 
 So if you wanna take a trip to the Row 
 Let a nigga like Snoop Doggy Dogg know 
 Protected by niggas with big dicks, AK's and 187 skills 
 So if it's must you test us, we can handle it the streets nigga, fuck making records 
 Yeah, G's up, hoes down 
 If that bitch can't swim, she bound to drizzown

 And Death Row Records is in full motherfucking effizzect 
 Oh yeah, PS, fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo 
 Aka Jerry and Eazy 
 Sincerely yours, deez motherfucking nuts

 I don't love Ruthless Records 
 Frankly, I don't love nothing they got to do with 
 But, but, but you know what I want you do for me? 
 Jerry and Eazy, check this shit right here
