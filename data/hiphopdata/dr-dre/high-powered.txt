Yo, yo what's up man? 
 Yo man gimme some of that old gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Some shit I can just kick back and smoke a fat-ass joint to, know what I'm sayin'? 
 Hell yeah, know what I'm talkin' about? 
 I like that old gangsta shit 
 'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there 
 Woofin all that bullshit talkin' 'bout they got this and got that 
 Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit, heh, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Yeah nigga I see your lips quivering 
 But you ain't sayin' a motherfucking thang 
 But my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house and they gon' tell you what's really goin' on 
 Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX, definitely in this motherfucker 
 I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker, ready to kick some real shit, know what I'm sayin'? 
 And that little shit you hear in the background, that's my homegirl Rage 
 So RBX kick this shit 
 RBX: 
 Seven execution style murders 
 I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fucking murderer 
 Haven't you ever heard of a killer? 
 I drop bombs like Hiroshima 
 So now I walk around strapped 
 One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse 
 Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter 
 This is just the first chapter 
 In a book from a crook 
 You get caught slipping, yo' ass gots to die 
 Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure? 
 Trigger happy RBX to cap ya 
 Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round 
 Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown 
 'Cause what I said split his head 
 And now they got me runnin' from the Feds 
 But I refuse to go alive 
 It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive, I'm high powered 
 Daz Dillinger: 
 Yeah, it's Daz that mass-murderin' motherfucker 
 So what you feel like you wanna get caught up? 
 Fool you better recognize 
 Death Row came to chastise 
 So if you cross the Row 
 Remember the first name is Death 
 No love for the other side
