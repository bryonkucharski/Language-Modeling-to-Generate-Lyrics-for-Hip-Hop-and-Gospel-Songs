King Mez: 
 I don't give one fuck 
 Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga 
 Real shit, y'all counterfeit 
 Y'all niggas bad business 
 That's why the game all fucked up 
 Fuck Glocks, I'm all about Fort Knox, nigga 
 Ridin' through your neighborhood 
 Throwin' money out the window like "What?" 
 You about the dollar (You know nothin' 'bout it) 
 Your poor life been without it 
 My life in the spotlight, oh no, no, no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it 
 Hol' up, if you really 'bout it 
 Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what? 
 Justus: 
 I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know 
 One thing, one thing I do know 
 (I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything 
 It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 I just bought California 
 Them other states ain't far behind it either 
 I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper 
 Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers 
 I was getting money 'fore the internet 
 Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet 
 MVP shit, this is where the trophies at 
 D-R-E, this is where the dope is at 
 The world ain't enough, I want it all 
 Goddammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all 
 But Andre young enough to still get involved 
 And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all 
 Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner too 
 If you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do 
 There's some missin' people that felt that way too 
 Justus: 
 I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know 
 One thing, one thing I do know 
 (I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything 
 It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all) 
 King Mez: 
 What the fuck was y'all thinking? 
 You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend 
 'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records 
 I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it 
 I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50 
 I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me 
 I murder rappers everyday till police come and get me 
 And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio 
 Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas 
 Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas 
 Crying bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas 
 Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas 
 I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chainin' 
 If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising 
 I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record but I mean it, kept my blessings 
 We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it 
 Justus: 
 I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know 
 One thing, one thing I do know 
 (I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything 
 It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all) 
 Listen, I've been tryna get it all (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'm just in this bitch, I'mma show 'em how to get involved (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Yeah I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Yeah I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 King Mez: 
 Talk about it, hol' up if you really 'bout it 
 Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what?
