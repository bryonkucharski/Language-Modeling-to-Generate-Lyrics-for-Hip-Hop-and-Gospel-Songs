I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute 
 While I talk about the pages of my diary 
 Listen up 
 I remember when I got started my intention was to win 
 But a lot of shit changed since then 
 Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory 
 But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me 
 I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history 
 And I'm strong; financially, physically 
 Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level 
 And don't forget that I came from the ghetto 
 Sold a new house for my moms, that's special 
 I let you going shopping till your feet get tired 
 Then a new Benz just for you to ride in 
 When I didn't have it, you provided 
 Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise 
 And my house got a view of the city like a highrise 
 I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary 
 When I open up my book I think about the world later 
 No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind 
 I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks 
 I remember how it used to be 
 Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that 
 I remember how it used to be 
 I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist 
 This is my passion, it's where my heart is 
 It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed 
 Like the nigga I started with 
 I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds 
 And regardless, I know my nigga still proud 
 It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks 
 We used to sit back, laugh and joke 
 Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters 
 You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing 
 Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella 
 Damn, I miss that 
 Shit, a nigga having flashbacks 
 When I open up my book I think about the world later 
 No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind 
 I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
