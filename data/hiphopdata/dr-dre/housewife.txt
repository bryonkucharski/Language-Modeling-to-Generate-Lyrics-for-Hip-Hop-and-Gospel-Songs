Kurupt: 
 Now this, this is one of them occasions where the homies not doin' it right 
 I mean he found him a ho that he like 
 But you can't make a ho a housewife 
 And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end 
 A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend 
 So what you found you a ho that you like 
 But you can't make a ho a housewife, wife 
 Dr. Dre: 
 I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip 
 Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip 
 (Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty 
 You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy 
 She on the dillzy, I take advantage 
 All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish 
 I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back 
 Slut I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat 
 Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude 
 Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes 
 Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it 
 Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded 
 She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud 
 Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin' tricks huh 
 Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin' 
 I left her up in Dallas, Texas, assed-out

 Hittman: 
 Naw "Ho" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny 
 Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money 
 I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her 
 Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica 
 Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica 
 Soon he'll need antibiotics (Suck it bitch) 
 Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody 
 You be like, "Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?" 
 Fool I pity ya, we live in the city of ballers 
 With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya 
 Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her 
 To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico 
 That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco 
 A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough 
 Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico 
 Kurupt: 
 At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what nigga?) 
 I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beeotch) then we'll fuck her friends 
 I said I dip, dive, what can I say? 
 Niggas need to stop fuckin' with OJ 
 Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip 
 And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes 
 I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes 
 Little Almond Joy, I truly enjoy 
 If you blew my balls, right through my drawers 
 Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot 
 From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot 
 I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters 
 The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin' 
 Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh) 
 Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz 
 Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate 
 See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak 
 It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?) 
 I knew you would, you wish you could 
 Break a G down, break me down 
 But I'mma see you on the rebound (What what?) D.P. style 
 Now this, this is one of them occasions where the homies not doin' it right 
 I mean he found him a ho that he like 
 But you can't make a ho a housewife

 The D.O.C. and Lil' 1/2 Dead: 
 Half Dead 
 (Lil' 1/2 Dead the money jumped out to say ol' Snoop Dogg on the look out boy?) 
 Yeah 
 (He gotta be more than half dead if he don't fill my motherfuckin' drink up) 
 (I'll fill your motherfuckin' mouth up) 
 Ah-hahaha (I don't think so)
