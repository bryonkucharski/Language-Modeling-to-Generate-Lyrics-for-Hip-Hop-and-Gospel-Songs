(Dr. Dre) 
 Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back 
 Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word) 
 That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit 
 Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!) 
 Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute 
 And bust this crazy shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Woke up quick at about noon 
 Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon 
 I gotta get drunk before the day begin 
 Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends 
 About to go and damn near went blind 
 Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs 
 Ran in the house and grabbed my clip 
 With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip 
 Bailed outside and pointed my weapon 
 Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin 
 Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride 
 I got front back and side to side 
 Then I let the Alpine play 
 Bumpin new shit by NWA 
 It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list 
 Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this: 
 Cruisin down the street in my six-fo' 
 Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes 
 Went to the park to get the scoop 
 Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops 
 A car pulls up, who can it be? 
 A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G 
 He rolls down his window and he started to say 
 It's all about makin' that GTA 
 'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard 
 You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card 
 Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit 
 Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Down on B's in the place to give me the pace 
 He said my man JB is on freebase 
 The boy JB was a friend of mine 
 Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine 
 Chased him up the street to call a truce 
 The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce 
 Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge 
 One sucker dead, LA Times first page 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Bored as hell and I wanna get ill 
 So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill 
 The fellows out there, makin' that dollar 
 I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala 
 They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin' 
 And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin 
 Love to get my girl, to rock that body 
 Before I left I hit the Bacardi 
 Went to her house to get her out of the pad 
 Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad 
 She said somethin' that I couldn't believe 
 So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave 
 She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know? 
 Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe 
 Her father jumped out and he started to shout 
 So I threw a right-cross and knocked his whole ass out 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control 
 Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll 
 I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother 
 I throw it in the gutter and go buy another" 
 Walkin' home and I see the G ride 
 Now Ket is drivin' Kilo on the side 
 As they busted a U, they got pulled over 
 An undercover cop in a dark green Nova 
 Ket got beaten for resistin arrest 
 He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess 
 Now G is cut for doin' the crime 
 For defence on the boy, he'll do some time 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I went to get them out but there was no bail 
 The fellaz start to riot in the county jail 
 Two days later in municiple court 
 Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork 
 Distruption of a court, said the judge 
 On a six year sentence my man didn't budge 
 Bailer came over to turn him in 
 Kilo G looked up and gave a grin 
 He yelled out "FIRE!", then came Suzi 
 The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi 
 Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her 
 Both up state for attempted murder
