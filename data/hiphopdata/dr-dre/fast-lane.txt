 Hey, living in the fast lane 
 Driving fast 'broads' 
 With them fast 'chains' 
 When you pimping through life 
 See some people get caught up 
 And some charges brought up 
 With some people they shoot up 
 Hey, there it goes again 
 Different face to the same old tragic end 
 Who's to blame if he never saw it coming 
 Yet he heard the bullet humming 
 And he never though of running 
 It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold 
 Nothing much to live up to, damn 
 It's so far gone, so gone 
 Living in the fast lane 
 Driving fast broads 
 With you fast chains 
 When you pimping through life 
 See some people got caught up 
 With some charges brought up 
 From some people they shoot up 
 Hey... tell me when will it end 
 When the baby pays for its mothers sinning 
 Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty' 
 Way too strong, way too strong 
 Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm 
 (Jadakiss) 
 It started when they birthed me 
 Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come 
 Little older now and can't wait till the dope come 
 Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him 
 Getting it so he can cover the whole border 
 Question is how many of us can hold water 
 It seemed like telling is in 
 Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again 
 I'm a left lane 
 My life is much faster than yours 
 I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl 
 Got the air ones matching the car 
 All white, slinging all night 
 So we rapidly spar 
 That's what they want to clap at me for 
 Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows 
 So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on 
 And get my ass up out of the fast lane
