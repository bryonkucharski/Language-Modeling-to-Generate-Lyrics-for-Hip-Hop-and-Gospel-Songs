You say you know her 
 Well I know her too 
 You say you know-ow-ow-ow-ow her 
 But you don't know her like I do 
 You say you love her 
 Once upon a time I loved her too 
 You say you lo-o-o-o-ove her 
 But you don't love her like I do 
 You've got to give me that girl 
 Or I, will take her from you 
 *Whistling* 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say 
 You're over 
 I say over who 
 It's gonna be over my dead body 
 The day she finds someone new 
 You've got to give me that girl 
 Or I will take her from you 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 *Laugh* 
 You know that I want you 
 And if I can't have you 
 Then no one can 
 But I need you 
 And when I find you... 
 You've got to give me that girl 
 Or I 
 *Laugh* 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 Woo woo, love me like you say you do 
 *Whistling*
