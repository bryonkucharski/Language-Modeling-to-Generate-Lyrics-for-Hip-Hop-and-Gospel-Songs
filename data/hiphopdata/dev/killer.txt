I'll wait for you 
 Time might take, to see it through 
 Now I got you at the barrel of my gun 
 Gonna keep you, gonna freak you, until I have my fun 
 Boy you can't run, you can't hide from me 
 I'm a killer 
 You can't run, once I like what I see 
 I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun) 
 Oh! nothing like when you touch me 
 Oh! I'm gonna make you love me 
 U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh! 
 I'm a killer (killing for fun) 
 Fire up shades of blue 
 Whenever I'm away from you 
 Now I got you at the barrel of my gun (my gun) 
 Gonna keep you, gonna freak you, until I have my fun 
 Boy you can't run, you can't hide from me 
 I'm a killer 
 You can't run, once I like what I see 
 I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun) 
 Oh! nothing like when you touch me 
 Oh! I'm gonna make you love me 
 U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh! 
 I'm a killer (killing for fun) 
 Well they say 'you can't have everything you want 
 All of the time (all of the time)' 
 But I won't sleep and I won't stop 
 Until you're mine (mine, mine, mine...) 
 Until you're mine (mine, mine...) 
 Because! 
 Oh! nothing like when you touch me 
 Oh! I'm gonna make you love me 
 U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh! 
 I'm a killer (killing for fun) 
 Boy you can't run, you can't hide from me 
 I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun) 
 You can't run, once I like what I see 
 I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun) 
 Oh! nothing like when you touch me 
 Oh! I'm gonna make you love me 
 U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh! 
 I'm a killer (killing for fun)
