If you wanna get with me 
 There's some things you gotta know 
 I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 Ba-ba-ba-bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 Bass, bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 It's like 1, 2, 3, fuck it 
 I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it 
 Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron 
 I don't give a fuck about goin' home 
 Straight buzzin', Robitussin 
 Wanna get your mitts in my oven? 
 Wanna get a lick of this lovin'? 
 G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin' 
 Yeah, I like it loud 
 And I'll make you shout 
 Give you that Black Eyed Peas 
 You know that boom boom pow 
 If you wanna get with me 
 There's some things you gotta know 
 I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 Bass, bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 Bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 Bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 It's like 1, 2, 3, okay 
 Can I get a little Goose in my O.J.? 
 E'rey day feel like my birthday 
 And we sip champagne when we thirsty 
 Quit fightin' while your husband 
 Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven 
 Wanna get a lick of this lovin'? 
 G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin' 
 Yeah, I like it loud 
 And I make you shout 
 Give you that Black Eyed Peas 
 You know that boom boom pow 
 If you wanna get with me 
 There's some things you gotta know 
 I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 Ba-ba-bass, bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 Bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 Bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low 
 I got a question for you 
 Do you like it when I flow? 
 I got a question for you, ooh, ooh 
 Do you like it when I flow? 
 With my bass down low 
 It's like la la la la, la la la la 
 La la la la, la la la la 
 La la la la, la la la la 
 La la la la, la la la la 
 If you wanna get with me 
 There's some things you gotta know 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 Bass down low 
 Ba-bass, bass down low 
 (Drop it to the floor) 
 I, I, I like my beats fast 
 And my bass down low
