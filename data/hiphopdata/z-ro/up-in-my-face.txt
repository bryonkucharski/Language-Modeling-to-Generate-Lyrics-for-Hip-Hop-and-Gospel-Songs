 Z-Ro Verse: 
 Excuse me, get off my motherfuckin toes 
 I ain't got no love for you motherfuckin hoes 
 Raise up, 'fore a nigga blaze up 
 I'd be the nigga that'll tear yo face up 
 With a left, a right, I'm out-of-sight, I'm boss 
 I don't give a fuck, you see me flippin when I floss 
 Riding with the Trae, riding with the Jay'ton 
 Riding with my brother, brother, then we be on 
 On a money making mission, Stackin our feddy 
 The world ain't ready, so heavy like a Chevy 
 Slow it down going down, we gon put it up 
 If you talking shit to us bitch, we shoot it up 
 Talking bout yo block now, I be riding with my glock now 
 It's non-stop now, around the clock now 
 Gotta get my motherfucker paper 
 Stacking up my chips like Lego 
 Hey ho, I just want some brain 
 That's that nigga Trae, that's my right-hand man. 
 Man, Nigga we gotta master plan. 
 Nothing but thousand dollars spreads up in our hands 
 Fuck going to jail, gotta make bail 
 We living in hell, so what the fuck oh well 
 And I don't give a damn, as long as a nigga stay free 
 Out here sippin codiene blowing on tree 
 At ease, motherfucker, just relax 
 In my pocket, I gotta bunch of green backs 
 And that's fact, I wouldn't tell no lie 
 If you run up, I put a swoll on your eye 
 Don't even try to run up on that water 
 I beat the nigga like a motherfuckin motor 
 Like a transmission, and I'm standing up hustlin 
 On the motherfuckin corner and I'm scufflin 
 To get my motherfuckin cheese my motherfucking bread 
 And you get one up in yo head 
 If you running up, trying to take what mine. 
 And in my fucking pant's line, I got that iron. 
 Under my elastic, I'll put flowers up in a basket 
 For a bastard, to get his ass kicked 
 Try to fuck around with nigga that roll with plastic.
