(Pimp C) 
 Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin' 
 I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me) 
 'Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy 
 'Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it) 
 Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' 
 I'm comin' up (choppin' on dubs and showin 'em love) 
 2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch) 
 Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up 
 (Verse 1: Pimp C) 
 Uh it's never too much the paper I make 
 These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake 
 I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch 
 I treat you good because you know I'm rich 
 I was in the ghetto-had nothin' 
 Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin' 
 Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A 
 Playin' the game the way the hustlers play 
 And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs 
 I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on 
 I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone 
 I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home 
 In Houston cause that is my city 
 And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty 
 When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up 
 You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up 
 I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me) 
 'Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy 
 'Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it) 
 Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' comin' Up 
 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 I remember when I had to come up just to come down 
 That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now 
 Use to be scared to walk in the store I paid the price now 
 My life is to valuable for me to play with life now 
 Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed 
 They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing 
 My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck 
 I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check 
 See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block 
 Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block 
 Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block 
 To make it through the night to see another day on the block 
 Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks 
 But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks 
 Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak 
 I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase 
 (Verse 3: Lil' Flip) 
 Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far 
 At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car 
 I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind 
 Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine 
 I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs 
 After "Diamonds N Yo Face" I was coppin' dubs 
 I had to make the transition from a boy to a man 
 So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand 
 Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us 
 Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh) 
 Look you don't know shit about UGK 
 Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes 
 I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin' 
 I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron 
 Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers 
 Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy) 
 (Pimp C) 
 Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' 
 I'm comin' up (choppin' on dubs and showin' 'em love) 
 2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch) 
 Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin' up
