(Feat. Mike D & Dougie D) 
 M-16, I'm reloading my magazine 
 And I will murder, every bumper clot run 
 Keep my hand, on my gun 
 Whoa 
 Mike D: 
 Don't worry, the Hogg gon get it cracking round here 
 And I know I'm talking loud enough, for all y'all to hear 
 This H-Town Texas, we ain't breeding no homos 
 Get a banger to you matrix style, trick in slow-mo 
 I'm the gun range stayer, 45 payer 
 No question where I'm from, 'cause I'm a Southside Playa 
 Got juice by the gallo', earvoes by the layer 
 Rubberband every thou', 3rd Ward youngest Mayor 
 Extended clips extra drums, for the K and the calico 
 Catch bag for the A-R, wet up your whole car 
 You talking like you want it, but you really don't want war 
 It's reg baby, in battlefield go 
 I'm out on two bonds, and parole don't know 
 So have your heart right trick, when you stepping to Mike D 
 I'ma b-braid your hair, then reload the magazine 
 Hit you with sixteen, then flee the murder scene 
 Vicious: 
 Now of the situation get sticky, I got this nigga playing thirty eight 
 A snub nose, that'll increase the murder rate 
 I heard they hating on a nigga, but I'm use to em 
 I sent this message by this bitch, to break the news to him 
 That y'all done fucked, with the wrong one 
 I got short patience, and a long gun 
 And I don't talk shit, I spark's it and I bust brains 
 And I don't play, no fucking games 
 Nigga I could make it happen, while you popping that shit 
 Squeeze a trigga, till ery'body drop in this bitch 
 Ain't no stopping this shit, once it get's to jumping 
 You get my heart pumping, the adrenaline pumping 
 I see me dumping, on motherfuckers 
 Empty the clip, and get to stomping a motherfucker 
 And I won't be disrespected, by none of these youngsters 
 I got my hand I got pass, I got a trunk bitch a liver pump 
 Z-Ro: 
 Is it me glock 40, pump-pump-pump-pump nope 
 Is it me 45, pump-pump-pump-pump nope 
 Is it me 3-57, pump-pump-pump-pump nope 
 Me M16, taping off the murder scene 
 Inhaling potent doja, with muddy cup of codeine 
 Me people don't even play me close, cause them don't know me 
 Me don't want no company, me kick it with me lonely 
 And will murder anyone of you snitches, run up on me 
 But my grandmother didn't raise a killer, she raised up a Christian 
 But the fact that I was already down, and people kept kicking 
 Made me crazy, that's why I got no love for nobody lately 
 And I told y'all once before, none of my weapons have a safety 
 Ru-run up on me once, I'ma beat your ass down 
 Ru-run up on me twice, I'ma heat your ass down 
 Place you in another dimension, nobody can see you now 
 Rest in peace, I'm the king of the streets yeah
