I just wanna say fuck you 
 For all the bitch ass shit you do 
 Don't won't me and my people to come through 
 Dressed in all black 
 We came here to handle that, so where the fuck y'all niggas at 
 I just wanna say fuck you 
 For all the bitch ass shit you do 
 Don't won't me and my people to come through 
 Dressed in all black 
 We came here to handle that, so where y'all coward asses at 
 Use to be my homie, but you stole from me like you didn't know me 
 With friends like you-now wonder I don't have homies 
 'Cause I was down like four flats without a jack for ya 
 Instead of robbin ya enemy-you attacted ya brother 
 Now go run and tell all ya people that I'm actin' funny 
 Don't forget to tell 'em what you stole-that's that gas money 
 I would've took a bullet for you bro-but fuck you though 
 Nowadays niggas ain't shit, but y'all already know 
 I can do bad on my own 
 But when I'm earnin' I'm one deep I get my cash on my own 
 I don't need no assistance-keep a creese in my slacks 
 Only teflon bullets, and all the pistols I pack 
 Crispy highs in the front, big ole bang in the back 
 Grape cigerillo blunt, big ole buds in the sack 
 Screw blue candy paint-tell me what's fuckin' wit' that 
 I don't trust none of my people-keep my hands on my strap 
 Straight like that... 
 I just wanna say fuck you 
 For all the bitch ass shit you do 
 Don't won't me and my people to come through 
 Dressed in all black

 Don't want no woman-I would rather be a gigilo 
 No feelings involved, call me Mr.hit that hoe 
 She got it twisted, 'cause I'll be damned if I kiss that hoe 
 Mo City, Texas and we be damned if we don't get that dough 
 Lookin' so fly, homie-my gators have eyes 
 I bet I won't ride in it, if it ain't been customized 
 Twenty-thousand worth of all these diamonds in my mouth 
 And he do my tats-I get my shit done at the house 
 Fuck waitin' in a line-'cause I'm in my own lane 
 Y'all keep doin' what y'all doin', I'll do my own thing 
 I'm ahead of the game, might as well be the coach 
 Shootin' spiders off that glass-so I'm rollin' on fo's 
 Homie it's so much smoke, I can reach out and touch it 
 I'm high then a bitch but always on my note in-public 
 I do what I do to get paid, most my people love it 
 With my niggas spendin' whatever I want, you better not touch it 
 I'm hustlin...
