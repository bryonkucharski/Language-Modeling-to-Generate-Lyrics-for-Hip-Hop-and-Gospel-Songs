 Looking like true money making shot callas 
 But them boys laws yeah that's them folks

 Back in the day I had a pocket full of rocks

 In front of my screen on 360 playing Halo 
 Hoes'll drop like it's hot when ever I say so 
 'Cause I'm the man diamond on my hand 
 Got big bass in the back of the blue van

 And thanks to Bun-B and Pimp-C I got two gold plaques

 And who ever don't like it keep my dick up in they mouth 
 I'm Screwed Up Click till they lay me in my casket

 Hand on my steel wood grain wheel
