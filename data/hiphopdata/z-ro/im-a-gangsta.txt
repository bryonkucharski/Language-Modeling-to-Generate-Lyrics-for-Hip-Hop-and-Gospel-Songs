(Feat. D-Bo) 
 Talking: 
 What it do, this one for all you hoe ass niggaz 
 You niggaz claim to be down, we been doing this nigga 
 We been out here sliding niggaz, we been out here doing boys 
 Been out here wrecking, you niggaz ain't shit 
 Hoe ass niggaz, make a nigga slide your bitch ass 
 Under a closed do' nigga, you got us fucked up 
 Z-Ro: 
 When it get gangsta, I don't see too many niggaz repping they set 
 But in front of these dog ass hoes, they rep it to death 
 There go Z-Ro the Crooked, better put some pep in your step 
 You ain't got enough insurance, to get yourself in a wreck 
 I put a cease on all breathing, when I squeeze my weapon 
 Better hope God cut for ya, cause you gon need that blessing 
 Somebody save him, it's gon take all of his homies to help him 
 And if he run, it ain't gon take but three of these to catch him 
 I'm dedicated to the delivery, of a Smith and Wesson 
 While keeping it under cover, to keep authorities guessing 
 Who did it when it happened, real niggaz don't make a scene 
 Bitch niggaz publicize it, and end up with ten to fifteen 
 Talking about how they done crept up, on a nigga from the blind 
 Couldn't even acknowledge they presence, they cowards in my eye 
 Right before I merk me a nigga, he don't know who hit him 
 Before I pull the trigger, I let him see my face and then I send him 
 I'm a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way 
 Frown on my face, I'm holding my AK 
 Handling bidness, digging ditches everyday hey 
 I'm a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way 
 I'ma be checking niggaz, till I'm old and grey 
 Serious bidness, that nigga Z-Ro he don't play hey 
 Z-Ro: 
 Ever since I was a youngster, bagging them grams up 
 I've seen so many times, in the back of the squad car in them handcuffs 
 Playing for a blue van, 'cause if it's red nigga that's FED 
 I guess it's back to drank and pretties, and eating at Jack Mack's Red 
 But I'd rather be free, up in the streets collecting money 
 From weed to drank, a long currensy just like Bun B 
 There go the the laws my nigga, don't let 'em see you hit the weed 
 'Cause we get more than a misdemeanor, for assault rifles and cheese 
 Yeah I'm rapping motherfucker, but I'm still on the block 
 Just cause you see me on the TV, don't mean I stopped punching the clock 
 That's fa sho money, I ain't seen a royalty yet but I get show money 
 By any means necessary, Z-Ro gotta get some mo' money 
 Now cheuffer's open up do's for me, it's just like Burger King 
 Motherfuckers love my rap and got hypnotized, the first time they heard me sing 
 That's why I'm able to purchase Afghanic by the pound, and a lot of drank 
 And to y'all jackers this ain't a glock bitch, when it pop it's out of tank 
 Z-Ro: 
 These days, I roll alone it's just my heater with me 
 Fuck all of these females, my heavleck is my main hoe so I keep her with me 
 Everytime she speaks, she leave bloody white sheets 
 And I got a rambo knife, sharp enough to cut straight to the white meat 
 Make me use it on ya, take it out take a breather then reuse it on ya 
 It's on you I could murder your ass, or drop some murder music on ya 
 And fuck that Hollywood shit, I'm from the corner 
 Newport Short box, and a cup of coedine fuck a Corona 
 I'ma be grooving it, till the world stop moving y'all know what that mean 
 C walking in blue and black All-Stars, with blue and black strings 
 A short sleeve Dickie top, with the bulletproof up underneath 
 Den Den you ain't no Crip nigga you's a bitch, cause you won't come to me 
 Talk that shit in my face, you been talking behind my back 
 I'm so confident that I'ma beat your ass, I ain't gotta be behind my strap 
 To that nigga Killa Kyleon, stay in your place 
 If I wanted to get you, I'd send bitches with razors to play in your face
