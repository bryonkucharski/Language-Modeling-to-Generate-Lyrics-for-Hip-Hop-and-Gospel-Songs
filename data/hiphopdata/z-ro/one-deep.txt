(Intro: Z-Ro) 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Right now, For my next selection 
 All you bitch ass niggas and all you bitch ass bitches... this ones dedicated to you. 
 'Cause y'all muh'fuckers ain't shit. I promise y'all ain't shit. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to... 
 Come around my way 'cause I don't need another fair weather friend with a trick up his sleeve 
 Actin' like he really my partner but he after my cheese 
 I'm suffocated by the weak, please leave let me breathe. 
 Remember? Y'all Ain't want me to hit the weed 
 Now I'm rappin' you see me and tell me to hit the weed 
 Thinkin' you can get a VIP pass and get in free 
 But Joseph McVey is enough company for me 
 Wanna kick it with me 'cause I kick it with the high class 
 Y'all didn't wanna kick it when I was down on my ass 
 In my corduroy bitches y'all was in Louis Vaton 
 Laughin' and pointin' at a nigga tryin' to ruin my fun 
 For usin' the millennium or money by the ton 
 You niggas ain't help me get it, I did it with no one 
 Fuck showin' love back, I ain't showin' none. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to... 
 Come to none of my shows or buy none of my tapes 
 'Cause with or without your support I'm a still be straight 
 The less niggas around me, the better I can concentrate 
 When I can't think straight, or open up my chest plate 
 It could be your death date, get beside yourself. 
 We ain't cool? I think you better rewind yourself 
 Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself 
 So get your feet and let the door close behind yourself 
 I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad 
 Only thing I need is the help of the good Lord 
 Tryin' to kick it but muh'fuckers seem too hard 
 I'm a be keepin' it real, they gon' be keepin' it fraud 
 A hundred and 52% are real with me 
 Instead of runnin' with the game keep steel with me 
 I can do bad One Deep, so I chill with heat. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep. 
 Y'all niggas don't have to...
