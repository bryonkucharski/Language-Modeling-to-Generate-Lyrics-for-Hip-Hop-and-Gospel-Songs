(Verse 1: Z-Ro) 
 My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin' my head 
 But I can't focuse cause so many niggaz in the street owe me some bread 
 And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed? 
 If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby 
 My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht 
 Might take alittle time for me to see bigger living (??) or not 
 But I want stop until I'm touchin my figures, you better move (bitch) 
 'Cause I be bustin' my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through 
 Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool 
 If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O 
 Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low 
 Runnin' up and down Houston slangin dimes and nickles 
 Performing for my hood niggaz spittin' rhymes and riddles 
 Forever stayin on our grind because of the shine it give us 
 And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us 
 (Chorus: Trae - repeat 2X) 
 Everyday it's like I can't maintain 
 But still I feel I'm in it for the same thing 
 All I ever wanted is just to get my change 
 Living strength is my only type of mind frame 
 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul 
 Gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own 
 Don't nobody love me in this cold world 
 Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl 
 Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna hear it, I ain't tryna know ya 
 Unless you be a hustler tryna come up on some mo' bucks 
 I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun 
 I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond 
 Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march 
 Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross 
 Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south 
 Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers 'cause we all be runnin' our route 
 I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong 
 Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain 
 'Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne 
 Win it just to stay in the game (mayne) 
 (Verse 3: Z-Ro) 
 Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness 
 Kickin it with the jealous got me beggin for forgiveness 
 This record label presidential think they live like me 
 Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me 
 They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name 
 But they can't sell records without me that's a godamn shame 
 Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check 
 Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch! 
 Everytime I speak bitch niggaz steadily be plottin 
 On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison 
 But it's all good I can take it 'cause I dish shit out 
 But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out 
 God blessed the child that can double his fetti 
 Duckin and dodgin trouble cops and trouble times come get me 
 I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone 
 And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home 
 (Chorus) - repeat to end
