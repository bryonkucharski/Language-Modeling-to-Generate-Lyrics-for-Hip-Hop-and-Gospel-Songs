Z-Ro: 
 Comin' up as yungsta 
 Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides 
 Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire 
 Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive 
 Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side 
 I use to walk everywhere I had to show up 
 Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts 
 Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man 
 My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang 
 Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could 
 Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood 
 Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up 
 Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up 
 It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin' 
 From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin' 
 Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home 
 Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's 
 Cause on the streets I be on crome 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome 
 Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on 
 I'll keep rolin chrome 
 Z-Ro: 
 Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cuttlase supreme on bald tire's 
 Yeah I know I was out of line 
 But that was all I could find 
 Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend 
 But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and 
 No more offerin' gas money to get a lift 
 Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick 
 So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there 
 Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there 
 Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there 
 Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there 
 And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss 
 All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off 
 Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war 
 They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car 
 I was lovin' it back then and still love it today 
 Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome 
 Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on 
 I'll keep rolin chrome 
 Z-Ro: 
 Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty-four's or twenty-six 
 My neck and my wrist light, with' out me sellin' a brick 
 TV's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick 
 Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if 
 I spy somthin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin' 
 If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin' 
 I be in different vehicle 'cause I'm havin' thangs 
 King of the ghetto enertainment got me havin' change 
 You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me 
 Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie 
 Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O 
 And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello 
 And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy 
 Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot 
 So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone 
 I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin' chrome) 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin' chrome) 
 Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on) 
 I'll keep rolin chrome (Yaah) 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am) 
 I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin' chrome) 
 Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (is what I'm holdin' on) 
 I'll keep rolin chrome (S.U.C.) 
 (Baby) (S.U.C.)
