(Feat. Mike D) 
 Killa Kyleon: 
 It's boss hogg Kyleon, and I'm fuckin' with the king 
 And bout to drop a fo' in a twenty ounce blue cream 
 I place the order out in cali. for the p.t. 
 We get money while you niggas still asleep, and a 
 It's three in the morning, in the kitchen cooking oz.s 
 Block to bleed, niggas to feed, if I drop' 'em on 12 comin' back 21 
 It's 80 zippers out the book, I move' 'em one by one 
 See my hands is fast, my cook game raw 
 I don't need no pyrex, gimme a coffe mug jar 
 And I whip it to the left, whip it to the right 
 Move it all around till they cook it air tight 
 Let it dry, pop it out the jar, straight to the scale 
 Wrap it up in plastic, straight to the mail 
 It's boss hogg Kyleon, nigga Mike D 
 Bleeds the block 'cause I am the streets 
 (Chorus x2: Z-Ro) 
 Here we go 
 Kyleon and the King of the Ghetto 
 Nigga we ain't got no love for you hoes 
 All we tryna do is keep collecting dough 
 Go get it, and come back get that white as snow 
 Candy doors, yeah they open up and close 
 Run up on us bitch you won't run up no more 
 'Cause we will slide yo bitch ass across the flo, flo, flo 
 Z-Ro: 
 I know y'all rappers can't stand 
 The fact that I'm back fresh outta jail 
 Also focused on nothin' but makin' my mail 
 Ain't got no time to waste, cause the rap game is damn near dead 
 Kyleon and the King of the Ghetto, came to raise rap from it's death bed 
 Every song they play on the radio is bullshit homie 
 Them niggas got they blow up, but we got that good shit homie 
 Matter fact you might even overdose 
 'Cause I've been known to cause blood clots 
 I should been known to be a killa, but a bitch killa I never was not 
 I've always kept it real, even when everbody around me was fake 
 They don't make like me no more, my kind don't break under pressure 
 It's death before dishonor nigga 
 So that means before a rat, like mickey mouse 
 I'll be another job for the grave digger 
 I ain't going back behind the fences with the razors 
 If I'm locked up in the penitentiary, I can't make no paper 
 So the last time I went, was the last time I'm ever gone be in 
 Instead of a 5 by 6 cell then a big brick home, that's what I live in... 
 (Chorus x2: Z-Ro) 
 Here we go, 
 Kyleon and the King of the Ghetto 
 Nigga we ain't got no love for you hoes 
 All we tryna do is keep collecting dough 
 Go get it, and come back get that white as snow 
 Candied doors, yeah they open up and close 
 Run up on us bitch you won't run up no more 
 'Cause we will slide yo bitch ass across the flo, flo, flo 
 Z-Ro: 
 Now every time I ride, I got a pistol on my side 
 Screwed Up Click until it's over on the Southside 
 I keep my mind on my money, and money on my mind 
 I ain't got no time no play, I'm on a 24 hour grind 
 Haters wanna see me fallin' off of my game 
 They hatin' 'cause when they see me I'm havin' thangs 
 Dig these blues, if you jack me, I'm jacking you back 
 24/7 on my clothes, I keep my hand on my strap... 
 Killa Kyleon: 
 See I'm somethin' like a playa, somethin' like a pimp 
 Gangsta strut on when when I limp like this 
 Is re-turn of rapper slash the hood fella 
 Lookin' for a rap to get my groove back like Stella 
 Still got a sack of that A-1 good yella 
 With a baby glock, ready to rock up out fellas 
 Hit me on the cella, ain't a damn thang change 
 Yeah, (you know me) nigga I'm still the drank man... 
 (Chorus x2: Z-Ro) 
 Here we go 
 Kyleon and the King of the Ghetto 
 Nigga we ain't got no love for you hoes 
 All we tryna do is keep collecting dough 
 Go get it, and come back get that white as snow 
 Candied doors, yeah they open up and close 
 Run up on us bitch you won't run up no more 
 'Cause we will slide yo bitch ass across the flo, flo, flo
