Ain't no such things as friends only associates 
 So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch 
 I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip 
 But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get 
 Gangsta shit 
 All my niggas is gone my damn bitch done cut 
 I got sum shit on my dome an 
 Then they love me or what 
 I'm one deep with my chrome like I ain't giving a fuck 
 If I got to do this alone fuck it that's wassup 
 They say it's lonely at the top an you 
 Gon' see who your real friends 
 No more fo doors I'm riding a coop benz 
 Keepin' it moving ain't focused on shit but not losing 
 If you don't fuck with me don't fuck with me 
 It's not confusing 
 And when you speak on my name watch the words your choosing 
 You soundin' like a hater to me it's so amusing 
 Instead of moving on trying to do your 
 Own thang 
 You recruiting for the we hate Slim Thug gang 
 But ain't shit change here mayne 
 I'm still the same 
 Life good up out the hood shit I can't complain 
 These niggas say they down but they 
 Just pretend 
 I'm ridin' solo to the end 
 Fuck friends 
 Ain't no such things as friends only associates

 Gangsta shit 
 Sometimes I wonder if god forgot about me 
 And would my people miss me if they had to do without me 
 Cause anything ain't no love 
 A nigga you think is yo homie is runnin' up in yo girl every time you leave her 
 Lonely 
 Each and every time I leave my house all three of my guns is on me 
 Ain't none of you niggas is goin' to 
 Be kicking or punching on me 
 And I learned my lesson about callin' my homies when I need 'em 
 Out of eleven one and a half 
 Shows up and the rest I still ain't seen 'em 
 One deep till I'm on my back 
 Y'all fellas out might be on my sack 
 I'll shoot a 
 Muthafucker if a muthafucker jump out of line then I'm a put 'em back in line 
 2006 forever gloc 40 with hollows in mind 
 It's amazing how something so small can flip yo bitch ass anytime 
 I'm an og original gangster mayne organized general 
 Army ready to drop off chemicals 
 64 545 criminals 
 But it's business 
 Whenever I'm seen with a crowd that I'm not feeling 
 Enter the conversation and paper in my pocket I'm not feeling 
 Ain't no such things as friends only associates 
 So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch

 I done seen a whole lot in these 26 years 
 Never thought I had peers that was undercover queers 
 Tell these snitches in my 
 Circle awhile back I would've murked yuh 
 I vouch for me an mine 
 Till the gavel drop down 
 An judge gave my time since I hogged up 
 The ripper 
 The last time I heard from my niggas 
 Still in denial in the begginin' of my sentence 
 Two months turned to years and them years 
 Turned to bitches 
 Sittin' in my cell doin' sets of push ups 
 No money no mail that's okay that's wassup 
 Momma made a man but these streets raised 
 A soldier 
 Where they kill a real nigga make a mo daycloder 
 I never fold up 
 I'm a do my time bitch 
 I'm a make parole hoe 
 Get out and shine trick 
 You fuck niggas better stay out my way 
 I awready wanna blow off yo face 
 For violating the code nigga
