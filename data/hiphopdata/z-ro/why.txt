(*Singing*) 
 (Hook: Tanya Herron) 
 Why, do we live this way 
 So many murders, where the children play 
 And it's about, to make me lose my mind 
 We're running out of time, too many of my people dying 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on 
 I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on 
 Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me 
 I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me 
 I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better 
 'Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar 
 I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high 
 Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by 
 We grown men, and all living in sin 
 Shooting a kite to my people, 'cause he in prison again 
 Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked 
 Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it 
 Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button 
 I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting 
 One deep, nobody's got my back 
 Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap 
 Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would 
 That's why I pack my twin bitches, 'cause I don't even feel safe in the hood 
 At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not 
 Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots 
 That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz 
 And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol 
 Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head 
 The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread 
 (Z-Ro) 
 My nigga Grady took seven shots, and one bullet hit him twice 
 Although he's blessed, my nigga just can't leave the thug life 
 You know it's fucked up, both of us was in class with honors 
 But soon would drop out, addicted to cash and marijuana 
 And the fast life, we bled the whole hood last night 
 Hard headed dumb niggaz, just trying to get they cash right 
 Hustling, hoping we can get a million 
 But like a chameleon, nigga the game done changed 
 Wish it would rain sometime, to help a nigga wash away the pain sometime 
 I shed ghetto tears daily baby, I can't hide the fact 
 Feeling like everybody's out to get me, so I don't hide my strap 
 I ride like that, with one up in the chamber 
 On my block if you ain't got a glock, you's in danger 
 Continuously head busting for nothing, my friends and my enemies 
 Nothing but recollection, as I remember the memories 
 If I could be like Jesus, I'd spread the love 
 But I can recognize the demons, so I spread the slugs 
 These motherfuckers say they love me, but I'm peeping they lies 
 Feel like jealousy and envy, when I look deep in they eyes 
 That's a friend for you, laced up with your girl and then try to 
 Spend your ends for you, and when it's drama they won't send for you 
 That's the reason Joseph, is one deep until he die 
 I ain't gotta wonder why, my people wanna see me fly, fuck em
