I go through so much, so I try to stay fucked up 
 Because, when I'm sober I can't maintain 
 Even though I do my best, the only thing I earn is stress 
 So I, spend most of my days chilling with Mary Jane 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Lately I've been going through more bullshit, than a bull fighter 
 So when I sing my praises to God, one verse is like a full choir 
 My every thought is pain, strain is stressing me to death 
 Everyday is like a rehearsal, that's prepping me for death 
 I think I'm ready, because this world ain't no friend of mine 
 Only thing I qualify fo', is murder and Penitentiary time 
 Y'all should of shot me in the jimmy, instead 
 But I guess they was feeling eachother, and get head in the bed 
 Here I am, first born torn between heaven and hell 
 I tell my people say no to dope, but I let it sell 
 Need to practice my preaching, calling the kettle black 
 I know I'm a Pac before or not, I gotta peddle crack 
 Ain't nobody got my back except the laws, when they on it 
 So I be going for broke, demolishing my opponents 
 Leaving no traces, just blood on faces believe that 
 HK I'ma squeeze that, you won't even wan' be back 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I can't focus I'm losing my mind, real fast 
 Dreaming and fiending for the day, I can make some real cash 
 Dropping album after album, platinum song after song 
 But it's like I ain't did nothing, cause the lights ain't on 
 How can I win, it's like everything I do is a motherfucking sin 
 It got a nigga fiending, to see my end 
 All of my friends are fake, they come around when I'm spending cash 
 But when I'm broke they out the do', with wheels spinning fast 
 Lonely, daily dodging the devil but he on me 
 Telling my people fuck him, 'cause he be working through my homies 
 Burning bridges, and I don't give a fuck 
 Remember y'all laughing at me, when I couldn't get a buck 
 It's all gravy baby, I got bigger hurdles I'm trying to jump over my residence 
 And my fear, gon be something I dump over 
 And it might not be much, but it's all I got 
 So when I paint it, promethazyne is all I pop 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I trust nobody even best friends, be digging your grave 
 Niggaz go on lock, when they come out wifey giving them AIDS 
 I don't give a fuck what anybody think, about me 
 When I was breaking my back for em, they didn't think about me 
 Got hot at a nigga, but they know that I'm raw 
 Too nervous to face a madman, so they go and shoot up my car 
 I got too many niggaz, trying to take me off of my game 
 And every woman I be feeling, be fucking with my brain 
 Now that I'm gone, I love you mean I'm leaving you soon 
 Plus I don't feel the way I did, at first I need me some room 
 Too familiar with heart ache and pain, it don't hurt no mo' 
 Just homesick, I don't want to be on this earth no mo' 
 Flirt with my chrome 4-4, 'cause she believe what I say 
 She ain't gon ask me no questions, she just gon leave 'em to lay 
 And leaving no traces, just blood on faces she down with it 
 Stay rolling around with me, when I'm down she down with me
