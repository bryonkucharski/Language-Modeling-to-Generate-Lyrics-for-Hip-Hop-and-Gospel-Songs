(Z-Ro) 
 The swisher papers got me dying so I practice smoking squares 
 And I see death around the corner so I'm quick to say a prayer 
 Living my life on the corner with thugs selling my drugs known as a chiller 
 But push my button watch your life 'cause I transform to a killer 
 Me sipping the drink me smoking me dank me tipping me herb and formaldehyde 
 Open it all of me niggas are ready to ride 
 Could I be innocent till proved guilty by Judge Judy, 
 But the fact remains, they confiscated my weed and my uzi 
 Now I'm in correctional facilities, living raw 
 Sharing a cell with the niggas that I whupped on in the free world 
 But ain't a god damn thing changed I'm still breaking a jaw 
 Ain't fin to lose no sleep, over nan one of y'all, one of y'all with fours 
 Could run up on me, and I guarantee that one of y'all gonna fall 
 I'm just here to do my time, not to trouble you, but I'ma drop 
 These jealous haters until they hear 1-9-3-2-0-7-0-6-8-T-W 
 In the free world one more god damn gin, causing havoc and fury 
 I'ma be popping pills, smoking that kill and for the members of the jury 
 Cause vengeance is mine, but I'm locked down, feeling forsaken 
 And my pen is mightier than the sword because my tools have been taken 
 Straight from the streets of Houston Texas yes my freedom they took it 
 But motherfuckers can't take my will to survive nigga 
 I'm Z-Ro the Crooked 
 In the wicked world, here come the champion, look out, look out 
 Abra cadabra, and running with the gun in me hand, look out, look out 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Hallucinations are tricking me, making me think I'm about to die 
 Could it be that fire that somebody really have a 3-54 plus three pointed at me 
 They giving me stitch of rectangles and squares 
 Asking me what does this mean to me 
 But I'm ready for the combat give me my motherfucking law back 
 Bitch I don't want no needles in me, y'all thinking I mean it, trying to do me 
 In a room full of ever men taking my mind to a place that I never been 
 But I'm a soldier roamed the battlefield, in the middle of the war 
 You either have to die or have to kill, so I ain't guilty motherfucker 
 Raise up off of my N-U-T's, cause you can't harm me 
 Everlasting, I'm ever blasting I recking you better get the army to swarm me 
 Because the Indonesia canibus helps me tackle the pain 
 But I'm getting so weak because I'm shackled in chains 
 Now my brain is going insane, feeling like my spirit is about to get evicted 
 'Cause I'm a victim of a world so wicked, time and time 
 I ask myself why did they turn the heat up, I was chasing paper 
 But niggas was jealous because they couldn't keep up 
 I'm Z-Ro the Crooked 
 (Talking) 
 I ain't ditching old punk ass nigga 
 Look in my motherfucking eyes nigga 
 Till I die, I'ma be real 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Show me a mercy overwhelmed in deep distress 
 Although I realize it's nothing but a test, but I can't take it 
 Cause my brain is going insane lately, see how many 
 Enemies that I have and how viscously they hate me 
 Deliver my life from they power forgive my sins, see my sorrow, feel my pain 
 Let it never be said I trusted you in vein 
 Long as I'm walking this earth my problems go from bad to worse 
 And I know it's gonna be that way until they lower my casket in the dirt 
 But all I'm asking for is just a little piece of mind, and I know 
 That if I keep the faith it shouldn't be hard for me to find 
 But my mind is hard to turn the other cheek, could have been a wise man 
 Because of the revelation of scripture that I speak 
 Everyday for twenty motherfucking years 
 A nigga been facing so many fears, and nothing shedding so many tears 
 But dear Sandra don't cry, all I can say is if they kill me I took it 
 But even in death I'm victorious they couldn't fade me 
 I'm Z-Ro the Crooked
