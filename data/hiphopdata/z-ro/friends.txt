 I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some 
 Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun 
 Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past 
 16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash 
 Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange 
 It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain 
 Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo' 
 Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo' 
 I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends 
 But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end 
 Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm 
 Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show 
 Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up 
 Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up 
 That's all right though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking 
 When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh 
 Friends just ain't friends no more 
 Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore 
 Friends just ain't friends no more 
 I don't need you motherfuckers round me 
 (Cl'Che) 
 Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down 
 'Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round 
 The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes 
 That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds 
 Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain 
 And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring 
 Cause the world is full of evil mayn 
 That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes 
 I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat 
 (Den Den) 
 First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's 
 Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again 
 There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click 
 These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill 
 But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with 
 Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz 
 Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win 
 Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Remember back in '97, we was living it up 
 If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up 
 Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together 
 Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together 
 Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs 
 But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, 'cause you's a bitch nigga 
 Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change 
 But I can't flip the script wanna get rich, I gotta remain the same 
 I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans 
 Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo 
 Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with 'em no mo' 
 Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do 
 And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid 
 But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone 
 Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh
