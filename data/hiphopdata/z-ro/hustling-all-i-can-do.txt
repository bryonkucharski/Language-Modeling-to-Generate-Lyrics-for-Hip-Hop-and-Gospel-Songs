(Mr. 3-2) 
 May life be a trip, I never knew, things could ever get bad 
 As I got no love my 17 shot glock with extra clips 
 That's it, I'm going all out and if I die then remember me 
 Cause in these last days I'm feeling like I'ma hit the penitentiary 
 For real, trying to deal with this every day struggle 
 You got to get up, up off your rump baby and hustle 
 I tussle, work my muscle, and boss hog 
 Take what's mine, and still screaming fuck y'all 
 If I can't ball, they better lock me up 
 Shackled down, hand cuffed, on sight I'ma bust 
 What's up, where your nuts, I get rushed to the head 
 Thug for life, motherfucker till I'm dead 
 Mr. 3-2, boss of all bosses 
 And I ain't, tolerating no losses 
 And no excuses, cause this world is so shife 
 Street game forever, and it's like that for life, nigga 
 Will I ever see the stage again 
 Radio D.J.s gone respect my rhythm 
 Feeling like I'm fin to hit the pen again 
 What will I do for food 
 Living in the ghetto turning boys to men 
 Crooked cops and killers interrupt my mission 
 Tell me will I ever pimp my penn again 
 Hustling is all I can do 
 I was born on a fucked up day, had to be, holidays 
 With nothing but frowns on my face, the sadness brought madness 
 To a family that was built, unconsciencely I love em 
 But some consciencely, running these streets, living constantly 
 It's costing me, way too much, but the slums got me 
 Jacking niggas work something, exclude before I hurt something 
 Inhale, exhale, ok, I promise things 
 Gone get better, just give me one more day 
 So I can work my jealous friends to have around 
 So I can tote my shit and hurt my belly for trying to stay down 
 Stay focused on what I'm trying to accomplish, and not be accomplice 
 Stay real, stay true, pay dues, and don't become a victim of some mob shit 
 I never let this misery, push me to do something I regret 
 But just notice you in danger, I want you to feel my anger 
 And if I ever feel like I'm danger, I'ma empty the chamber, oh-oh 
 (Z-Ro) 
 These motherfuckers want me dead, at least that's how it seems to be 
 An army of motherfuckers against me Dean and E 
 Who you gone call, when my commratery come down rain 
 Nothing but revenge to keep me sane, it ain't nothing like pain 
 'Cause when I squeeze it then you bleed, satisfaction is guaranteed 
 Black hearted ever since the first murder, off precious is my breed 
 Enemies, fuck all my foes, fuck all my friends 
 Unless I'm in the penn, I've got nobody to call my kin 
 Cause all the real niggas are dead or in jail, but I've been 
 Left in struggle for success trying to get a check from Southwest Wholesale 
 Look at all the 16's that I've wrecked, and I'm practically poor 
 On top of that I'm homeless my niggas don't want me no more 
 Fuck being ten to get in, these motherfuckers act like they don't know my face 
 Better remember I'm quick to click and hit don't act like you don't know my pace 
 Well fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial 
 If I pimp my pen, I got to wait 3 months for trade me scratch for lunch money 
 Monday night the sirens seemed so loud 
 I hope that I can lose this crowd 
 Lately, it go down that way 
 That's why a nigga quick to get the K and spray 
 We could have been so throwed together 
 But because I was short it's on my cheddar 
 I haaaad to get up and bleed the block, and it don't stop
