(*Talking*) 
 It's going down, straight up 
 I'm steady balling, shot calling 
 I'm clowning 'em baby 
 Steady balling, tonight 
 We gon ride while we sipping and smoking 
 Steady balling, outta control 
 We gon swang, with the trunk open glowing 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Nothing but things I'm seeing, nigga be chasing divid-ends 
 Pimping the pen, and I gotta keep a thermostat on my skin 
 And catch a cold, with the motherfucking ice I'm in 
 Big bubble lenses, at the front of the car 
 We in the club, running up a fat run at the bar 
 Puffing plex, anybody get a punch to the jaw 
 No soda water, got a pint doing it raw 
 And everyday, I put new shoes on my feet 
 Sugar brown ladies or red bones on my meat 
 I'ma skip with the rub or not, on my sheets 
 And ride with a big fo'-five, on my seat 
 Pulling out the yard, as I drop the top 
 Ready for the jackers, still gon cock the glock 
 Pulling up at the club, everybody still show love 
 But I'm still not gonna stop for bops 
 But I'ma stop for the drank, man po' me up 
 Hoping to nine seven point nine, blow me up 
 But these fellas be in it for the competition 
 Seem like, everybody wanna show me up 
 But nigga fuck the fame, 'cause I want the change 
 Like Lil' James, leaving stains on niggaz brain 
 I smoke and I lean, but still I maintain balling mayn 
 (H.A.W.K.) 
 When the top down, I'ma drop the rest 
 On 8-3's, and bumper kit 
 Candy paint, looking wet to spit 
 Piece on my neck, read Screwed Up Click 
 Album silver, bubble head lights 
 Trunk gon knock, like lights of fire 
 At the intersection, I run the red lights 
 All my jewelry, is draped in ice 
 Crazy chain, piece and medallion 
 Pass the seat, or yellow stallion 
 Pretty brown eyes, and thick thighs 
 Half Chinese, mixed with Italian 
 Paid for, everything cash 
 My rear view, is in my dash 
 Got a pop spot, to hide my stash 
 Hide my trunk, see the baby gash 
 Mild dog, is super meals 
 Drop my top, feel the atmosphere 
 Tweety singing, loud and clear 
 In my cup, is Belvedere 
 Pockets full, of big face bills 
 Three story pad, in Beverly Hills 
 So much ice, you get the chills 
 In the studio, I shred the reals 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Man no more struggling we bubbling, collecting with Breadwood 
 White golf against the click, we drop bullets and I'm ahead them 
 We ride on top of the ridge, like a wide stallion 
 Bezeltine around me neck, with the diamond medallion 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Barley moving on swangas, and knocking off the side rolling 
 Gotta give it up to the Fat Pat, nigga 'cause we Southside holding 
 Rolling in luxury cars, sipping on bar, talking on cellulars 
 Receiving messages from Mars, nothing but rap stars 
 Anybody wanna fuck with us, fuck around and get flipped up and zipped up 
 In a six foot ziploc, 'cause I got a glock in my right hand 
 And I'ma flip, when I can't even act like he wanna trip 
 I said it like that and I'll say it again, matter fact push record and play 
 It again 
 With a bop digger then, Trae and Den in a Benz 
 And accepting all the dope trafficking 
 Got the dope in the trunk, and we backing in 
 So much money, gotta back track my ends 
 I got the glut opium, black 'cause I'm African 
 American, Guerilla Maab gon shine for life 
 But our motherfuckers, are dull like a butter knife 
 I put it on my balls and on my life, Z-Ro never been shife 
 Cat don't come around me, just let me ball 
 If I fall off my note, then let me fall 
 Needed help from God, did he get my call 
 Pulling out the lot, and he let me crawl 
 Like Mafio, by the year two triple O 
 I'ma come down, in a six double O 
 With green flow, mats on the flo' 
 Candy paint on my do', it's bout for the hook and it go
