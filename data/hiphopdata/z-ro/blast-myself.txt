(Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 I wake up in the morning & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Before I go to sleep at night I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Look at myself in the mirror & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 I got problems but too much pride for me to ask for help. 
 So is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Verse 1: Z-Ro) 
 Tell me where to go to get a peace of mind 
 'Cause all I see is suicide receivin' me by my tec9 
 Although my tattoo reads 'no more pain' 
 Lately I feel the needle hit me up in vein 
 Most of my real niggas are dead 
 They done left me with my fake friends 
 The ones that always need you 
 But don't appreciate friends 
 I'm solo when I roll 
 I live and die by myself 
 That way nobody can blame me for the death of somebody else 
 'Cause the way these niggas hate me is an epidemic 
 I'm in the line of fire 24/7 
 Constantly steppin' in it 
 Hate me 'cause I'm doin' good 
 Hate me 'cause I ain't doin' bad 
 At least I got to be a Dad 
 But I got no seeds 
 I used to bleed for some other cats creation 
 But as far as I'm concerned I would've burned for those creations 
 My family didn't make it 
 Make me wonder will I last myself. 
 So is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 I wake up in the morning & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Before I go to sleep at night I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Look at myself in the mirror & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 I got problems but too much pride for me to ask for help. 
 So is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 It ain't that I sound like 'Pac 
 I sound like stress 
 Just like automatic when I'm down and depressed 
 I shed tears 'cause I do it so good 
 Thanks to my nothin' ass homies off the block 
 Nigga fuck my hood 
 I couldn't shit, shower or shave 
 Unless I was willin' to pay 
 That's why I wasn't willin' to stay 
 I could do bad by myself 
 I ain't even have no money for me 
 And y'all was laughin' like me sufferin' was funny to see 
 So wonder why I don't give a fuck about bein' here 
 On the other hand I murder muthafuckers 
 'Do we have a problem here?' 
 If you beat me to the trigger 
 I ain't mad homey 
 Least I ain't gotta cry no more 
 No more feelin' sad homey 
 I know Trae got my back 
 He gon' look out for my people 
 God leave me not into temptation 
 Deliver me from evil 
 And if it's my time, I'm ready 
 If it ain't, I'm a ask myself. 
 Man, is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 I wake up in the morning & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Before I go to sleep at night I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Look at myself in the mirror & I ask myself. 
 Is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 I got problems but too much pride for me to ask for help. 
 So is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Verse 3: Z-Ro) 
 I ain't tryin' to be a role model, but I am. 
 What kind of role model get arrested for 300 grams? 
 I struggle with my addiction, I ain't perfect 
 Realize that it's bringin' me closer to my grave 
 So maybe it's worth it 
 The more codeine I drink 
 The more I'm not awake 
 I'm like a prisoner 
 And syrup is the way I escape 
 But this message is to the kids 
 Do as I say and not as I do 
 'Cause there could be a brighter future for you 
 But as for me; all I know is drama, all I know is pain 
 27 & I don't know how to smile and that's a shame 
 I came in 1977, the first one 
 By age 10 or 11 full blown smokin' blunts 
 'Cause weed was what I needed to evade and escape 
 But reality would end up smacking me dead in my face 
 Now that I'm gone, I got no more cheeks to turn. 
 So I ask myself, man is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 (Outro: Z-Ro) 
 Went to the preacher full of liquor 
 Tryin' to ask for help. 
 Said is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 Movin' so fast I done fucked around and cast myself. 
 Man is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 I'm tired of bein' broke. Where was I when the cash was dealt? 
 Man is life worth livin' should I Blast Myself? 
 I just can't take it, I ain't even gotta ask myself. 
 Maybe life ain't worth livin' I'm a Blast Myself.
