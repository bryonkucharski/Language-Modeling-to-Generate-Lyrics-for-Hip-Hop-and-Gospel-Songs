(Talking) 
 1,2, there's that nigga house right there 3 
 You see that nigga 4-*machine gun shooting* 
 Yeah Oh! 
 I ride on my enemies-I ride on my enemies 
 It's time to ride on my enemies 
 I ride on my enemies-I ride on my enemies 
 It's time to ride on my enemies 
 Be outside ya crib nigga 
 (Verse 1-Lil'Flip) 
 Whut Up Now nigga I heard you was yappin ya jaws 
 So you know we ain't fuckin' with y'all 
 So how you wanna do it 'cause I'm ready for war 
 I'm like Steven Segal I'm above the law 
 Uh this ole pussy ass nigga tryed to rob my connect 
 Now my hood fucked up 'cause we all in debt 
 I had a load comin' in at a quater till 9 
 I put my bitch on a train 'cause she tired of flyin 
 I caught this nigga at the crib with his wife and shit 
 She blind till the fact she don't know the life he live 
 Stick up kids die fast in this live of crime 
 Everybody got rights so I'm a fight for mine 
 I got the right to pack a gun with my beam and shit 
 So don't ever ever disrespect my team and shit 
 And I don't care about how much coke you move 
 'Cause I know you flip alittle but you smoke it too 
 And when you go against me you suppose to lose 
 When we erase you ya wife, and kids suppose to move 
 Bang bang motherfucker when I hit ya block 
 Runnin' full corpress wet or without the rock bitch 
 (Hook-Will-Lean) 
 Whuts Up Now nigga I heard you wanna squash the beef 
 Whuts Up Now nigga it's too late I'm off the leash 
 So how you wanna do it, get prepared and grab ya vest 
 'Cause when I dump the pump slugs crash ya chest 
 (Verse 2-Will-Lean) 
 I'm a killer by all means I'm packin clips 
 With arterillary that'll make you do a backwards flip 
 Catch you on the strip-PLOW crack ya whip 
 Slangin that death plus I gave the mac to flip 
 Now let's go and show e'm how we handle the beef 
 Takin' off Botany Boys and I'll dismantle ya street 
 Motorized stash box in the panel on the jeep 
 This not the Appolo nigga amateur week 
 You say got wieght but never touched a ki 
 You say you ran a block but never touched the streets 
 I'm a nightmare I'll fuck you up in your sleep 
 Bad dreams of empty things bust the rap and repeat 
 (Hook-Z Ro) 
 Whut Up Now nigga I heard y'all was talkin' down on my name 
 Talkin' down on my name-talkin' down on my name 
 Whut Up Now nigga bitch I'm comin' to see you simple and plain 
 To see you simple and plain-I'm comin' to bust ya brain 
 Whut Up Now nigga y'all don't wanna see me with this tommy gun 
 If I shoot it y'all gotta run that bullet proof want stop it none 
 Y'all don't wanna see me with this tommy gun 
 If I shoot it y'all gotta run that bullet proof want stop it none 
 (Verse 3-Z Ro) 
 If somebody gotta problem with me come and address it 
 If the shoe fits it then walk in it I'm talkin' to Texas 
 See I'm from a section where we kill each other for practice 
 So I keep the AJ-AK right under my matress 
 Don't let the gold and the diamonds fool you 
 I promise it's nothin' for ya family to lose you 
 I run with my Asshole By Nature niggaz Trae and Lil Boss 
 Look I just got the word from niggaz that Austin dropped in the south 
 We don't even much know these niggaz they just dissin us for publicity 
 But we gonna give e'm a beat down when we catch up with e'm eventually 
 Whut Up Now nigga you was tryna get my attention now you got it 
 Now the real guerrillas on the way to you and you can't do nothin' about it 
 I gotta lot of problems but a beef ain't one 
 'Cause I been known to pay niggaz back what I owed e'm with my guns 
 And I always got e'm with me bitch you better get ya weapon
