Z-Ro: 
 Aight, aight, aight. 
 Z-Ro: 
 When the Fetti be rollin' setty, won't nobody go home? 
 When the money start lookin' funny, all my friends get gone 
 Concerts and studio time, they love to come and kick it 
 But without gas money Z-Ro gon' miss it 
 I thought to myself, this feels like don't nobody hear me 
 Even though I screamin' I must be a demon 'cause won't nobody come near me 
 People laugh at me 'cause I ain't got respect like faith 
 Fuck respect, I do this to keep a ride & a place. 
 Will I survive? 'Cause God's watchin' 
 Satan is takin' my sanity please God stop it 
 I'm feelin' like Snoop 'cause murder was the case that they gave me 
 They knew I ain't do it, but just to they permission they wanna hang me 
 I'm feelin' like Jesus when he was about to be crucified 
 Please everyone if you don't help me then you could die 
 Suicide is safety, but it's definite hell 
 Somebody dead and they got me stressin' in hell 
 I'm sangin' the blues. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change 
 I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game 
 'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame. 
 Z-Ro: 
 I'm used to mother organizations and 'loc's of my own 
 Evaporate like Brillo when fiends smokin' that stones 
 That's the way we live in the ghetto, if we could we'd change 
 But don't nobody love us but trouble, so that's why we bang 
 Many funerals to go to, I don't go to none 
 Never look in a pine box until I see Z-Ro in one 
 Ain't no future in front & I'm scared to be decease 
 But it seems like the only way a gorilla-mobb gangsta gon' see peace 
 'Cause mama waitin' for me, her and Grandma Bezzy 
 Tellin' me ain't no haters in Heaven or detectives to sweat me 
 But a mansion a home in the ground, that'll be mine 
 Hand ready singin' praises to God, that'll be fine 
 Plus they tell me the streets are made of gold 
 Here people murder people, the webbin' in Heaven is under your toes 
 It ain't hard doin' right, it's just hard to succeed 
 I wanna live but it's hard to breathe 
 It got me singin' the blues. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change 
 I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game 
 'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame. 
 Z-Ro: 
 I done came along way, but it's still alot of road up ahead 
 To be honest I be feelin' like I'm about to be dead 
 People feel as if I'm suppose be happy 'cause I'm makin' some ends 
 But I'm lonely 'cause I cannot communicate with my friends 
 Niggas I grew up with, be actin' like we ain't grow up together 
 Fuck hoes and pour up together 
 Nigga you cried on my shoulders & I cried on yours 
 Yeah you rode on my enemies, so I ride on yours 
 But it's a different day and time 
 And we don't even kick it 
 Ain't nobody got time to holla no more it's strictly business 
 But I tell you this, I will always have love for ya 
 The same nigga bitch I still shed blood for ya 
 The same nigga blood bitch I love ya 
 I went to school to fight niggas for you 
 Even though we wasn't Blood Brothers 
 Fuck that, we was brothers. 
 What we is now? 
 I can't do nothin' but continue my years out 
 But it's all gravy, ain't nobody gotta chill with me 
 Only thing I ask nigga keep it real with me. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change 
 I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name 
 Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang 
 I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain 
 All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game 
 'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame.
