Everytime I turn around my friends are turnin' into foes 
 I can't feel my days at hand please Heaven open up your doors 
 I wanna live my life, my life but my life is coming to a close 
 That's why I pray to my God - my God give me strength so I can carry on 
 (Verse 1 - Trae) 
 Feel like I'm goin' on 40 but I ain't hit the age of 24 
 Hard times killing my smile but I'm a make it though 
 If I can remember the last time I got to laugh without fakin 
 On top of niggaz hatin' plus I feel I'm runnin' by Satan 
 But I'm a solider and feel like it be hard for me to cry 
 So I laugh away the pain and roll the time by 
 This life I'm livin' everyday is reality at it's best 
 All my doggs dead or gone and I'm struggles keeping me stressed 
 Deep inside I know it ain't right to fake what I'm feelin' 
 But I'm confused cause my pride got me fighting the feelin' 
 They locked my dogg up right when we was reachin' the top 
 I made a promise to myself that I'm a maab till I drop 
 I know one day it's gon' get better when the sun get to shine 
 Cause in the rain we forever duckin one time 
 And to my brother J and Boss I got ya back till I'm dead 
 SK for life my nigga hold up ya head 
 (Verse 2 - Boss) 
 Every once in awhile I get a call from my friends 
 One of my homies from the block done went back to the penn 
 Niggaz can't stay out of shit for shit cause shit gon'call they name 
 I done been stranded before my nigga Boss done felt the pain 
 Hustlin in the rain not knowin' where my meal finna come from 
 Out on the corner with soft and hard - stackin tryna get funds 
 Duece 4 - 7, three hundred and sixty five 
 I keep my head to the sky, hopin God's gonna let me ride 
 (Verse 3 - Jay'Ton) 
 Reminicin 'bout the better days 
 Stuck in a daze got me feelin' like I'm trapped in a maze 
 I'm at a early age, stressin like a grown man 
 And all my pain got me beggin for a helping hand 
 I miss my brother even though we barely know each other 
 Cause in my life he been gone away and it make me tougher 
 Everytime I turn around it's the same thing 
 Same pain still trapped in the same game 
 (Verse 4 - Lil'B) 
 Everytime I turn around I feel I'm losin composure 
 Lord knows that hard modes turned me into a solider 
 I got a brother living sick thinkin' life is a bitch 
 On lock down and this the type of shit I live with 
 Family be needin cash ends barely meetin 
 Lord knows my pockets starvin while these niggaz eatin 
 Plus I'm threw fuckin' with playas that's finna turn to foes 
 I just wanna leave my life in peace and chase dough because... 
 (Verse 5 - Z-Ro) 
 Give me the strength 'cause I grow weaker by the second 
 My squab game good but I feel the need to keep a weapon 
 Close to me when I'm out in public or when I'm at the house 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the most hated person in the south 
 I see death around the corner and he callin my name 
 I know I gotta go but first let me make me some change 
 'Cause I ain't never had nothin' in my life time 
 So why the world wanna disconnect my life line 
 I kept it real with homies who kept the realness back 
 Now that I need 'em they can't see me man how real is that 
 Matter of fact I think they wanna see me dead and gone 
 And me strugglin they don't wanna Z-Ro happy because his friend is 'lone' 
 Just 'cause they dead broke, they want me to be broke with 'em 
 Could it be that they mad at me because I can afford to smoke with 'em 
 Jealousy and envy made me sharper then a blade 
 I broke bread why my homies wanna put me in my grave every time I turn around...
