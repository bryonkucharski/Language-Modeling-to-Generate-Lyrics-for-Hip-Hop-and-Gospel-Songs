 Now if you want it 
 You gotta work it 
 Now if you want it 
 You gotta work it 
 (D-Reck) 
 Slow down mama, let me tell you one thang 
 If you want to know me, you gotta know the game 
 There's a whole lot come, with this fortune and fame 
 Some dogs just can't, be careful with change 
 Got too many women, so they say I'm no good 
 Making too much paper, so I'm misunderstood 
 But I spit it like I get it, and I'm good with the wood 
 When I hit it I ain't quit it, till I know she into it 
 She shakes she shivers, she fill like a river 
 She upset she stress, trying to catch me slipping 
 She fiending she scheming, trying to get this thug 
 But she knew what it was, when she met this thug

 Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it 
 Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet 
 Now when I drill it, I'ma make you spill it 
 Girl you gon feel it, that's on the real yeah 
 (Cl'Che) 
 Boy you gotta drop it, if you trying to hit it 
 You gotta work your mouth, down in the Dirty 3rd we call the South 
 You want a classy chick, you want a nasty chick 
 You gotta gotta know, what you working with 
 'Cause I'm a choosey chick, I'm a Gucci chick 
 And I taking no small, mmmm 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I'ma work it anyway, you ain't got to beg 
 Legs behind your head, on the edge of your bed 
 Steady pumping and I'm bumping, and I'm leaving it red 
 Whooping the life out the butt, now and leaving it dead 
 Telling me what I got to do, to get ass 
 Only thing I got to do, is get cash 
 Might get some hydro, or get some hash 
 I don't need no viagra, to help me last 
 You bout to get done, when you get on top 
 Give it about three seconds, you'll be on bottom 
 If we ever get into it, you'll take it to heart 
 And want to take me to war, and you'll be on cock

 Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it 
 Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet 
 (Noke D) 
 Now I don't want you, to get the wrong idea 
 I ain't trying to make no, love in here 
 Mr. Thugger man, baby have no fear 
 I'm hitting and I'm getting, up out of here 
 Now I don't really mean, no disrespect 
 But you gotta bend, your back and neck 
 It's so good, I want to show D-Reck 
 Just for a sec, let him feel the wet 
 And before we go, you gotta let Z-Ro 
 Bend you over, touch your toes 
 'Case you didn't know, we call 'em run through 
 Just what you, just let us do
