<I been through enough with you 
 For a matter fact to much with you 
 And loving doesn't mean I will continue to fuck with you 
 This aren't a fuck you song, it's a thank you for not loving me, causing me to love myself 
 This is an I love you song. 
 How can I please somebody that can't be please? 
 There aren't nothing for Z-ro to do but leave. 
 Aren't no such thing as a happy home unless I'm leaving alone 
 Even though it's not your time of mouth your cycle is on... 
 Though I get enough beef in the street to eat, 
 When I get to the cub you try to feed it to me every time you speak. 
 R.Kelly got you self-centered 
 What about when a brother is fed up? 
 Its hard to keep his head up 
 See but this is the last time your going to try to run my life 
 You wanna run something? 
 Become a Dyke and get yourself a wife 
 Me? 
 I'm going to miss you, 
 But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you, 
 Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you 
 Bitch 
 Thank for making it hard to make it better for us. 
 I was just trying to make some chitter for us. 
 I'm a one woman man 
 But 
 When my one woman starts tripping 
 You can find where the strippers be striping. 
 I went out to get it and I came back with it 
 I never complain I just handle my business 
 God is my witness 
 I'm a one woman man 
 But 
 When my one woman starts tripping 
 You can find where the strippers be striping. 
 Just be a lady in the street 
 You oughter to be a freak in the sheets 
 Just be respectful when your speaking to me 
 They say you never miss a good thing until its on its way out 
 You should have seen the sign when I started to stay out all night long 
 Dodging your call on the phone, not because I'm cheating 
 But I'm drinking and chafing, comtraplaing (s) if I'm staying or leaving. 
 It aren't no question if I love you girl, it just your attitude makes me wanna hurl 
 I know I give it to you 
 How you want it when I'm in you 
 You just say the word I just slow down change position 
 And then continue 
 Then you be acting like you don't know me when your aren't sexing 
 I in jail stressing, and your mad at me for not showing affection 
 Pardon me for being human 
 If I'm not pleasing you then you got a problem with what I'm doing. 
 Me? 
 I'm going to miss you, 
 But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you, 
 Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you

 Our relationship faded 
 I wish we would have made it I sha hate it 
 But I got my sanity back and I wouldn't trade it 
 For a meal ticket, aren't no maybe we'll kick it 
 I don't want that 
 Like getting out of prison I'll do anything not to go back 
 Could it be meant for me to be one deep by myself while I'm awake and sleep 
 Thank to you I don't spend no more time try to please somebody else 
 Now all my time and effect is put into pleasing me 
 Straight up 
 I'm gone and your going to miss Joy'Mack (s) 
 Aren't no use in calling my phone 
 Because there aren't no getting wrote back 
 I don't want to go to the movie or out to eat 
 Only way your going to see me 
 Is if you see me out in the street 
 I thought you was my future wife girl 
 But maybe my experience with you was 
 Peroration for me to find the right girl 
 Me? 
 I'm going to miss you, 
 But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you, 
 Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you
