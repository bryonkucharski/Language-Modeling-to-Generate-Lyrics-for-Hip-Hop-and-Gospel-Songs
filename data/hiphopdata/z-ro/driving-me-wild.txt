It's a Biggy Beat. 
 (Hook: Z-Ro) 
 It's that pretty brown round, Driving Me Wild 
 Oh bitch your pussy's about to get a little greasier 
 And the KY make penetratin' so much easier. 
 It's that pretty brown round, Driving Me Wild 
 Oh bitch your pussy's about to get a little greasier 
 And the KY make penetratin' so much easier 
 But I wish you wouldn't trust me so much. 
 (Verse 1: Z-Ro) 
 That don't mean I'm a cheat on ya 
 I'm a bend that ass over and beat on ya, Then I'm a skeet on ya 
 Damn right I'm a boss and you know that 
 But when I leave the pen, I can't wait until I go back 
 And if you defend baby, you smarter than a motherfucker 
 Gon' show me what you got up in your head baby 
 Hell naw I don't need no X, just a raincoat baby 'cause it's about to get wet 
 Got you beggin' me to stop but I ain't finished yet 
 Guarantee this is a fuckin' you'll never forget 
 There's so many bitches I got to like one, so many cigarillos I got to light one 
 You ain't even got to wonder if you doin' somethin' wrong 'cause it's all on, bitch 
 You got the right one.

 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 'Cause I'm in love with all your friends 
 And I don't wanna do you like that baby but your homegirl's givin' me a call again 
 Whenever she spend the night, you let her walk around the house in her panties and bra again 
 When y'all wanna sleep in the livin' room, she in up in the bedroom suckin' on my balls again 
 But I don't feel bad 'cause you ain't my girl, nothin' but a sex thing that's all it ever was 
 I knew you was a freak 'cause we fucked in the club, pussy got wet when you saw the swangers on dubs 
 A thug from around the way like Slim Thug, but I need pussy like a dope fiend need drugs 
 Mike Moe gotta paint we can pour it on up lookin' for a few bitches that'll skeet on her.

 (Verse 3: Z-Ro) 
 'Cause you already know I'm a dog and even though I'm house trained main 
 I just can't keep my 3rd leg in my draws 
 I try to do right but every time it gets hard I break my chain and end up in my neighbor's yard 
 I'm a Pitbull baby you a shih tzu 
 I'm a freak, you a freak, ain't no tellin' what we get into 
 I'm tryin' to win, tryin' not to sin, high off weed and lots of gin 
 Go on spread eagle for me I'm a drop it in, Tryin' to knock the line and not the cock again 
 I'm a man who came up so don't be playin' with me, hop up in my B E D 
 Slow down I'm about to skeet, yeah.

 (Verse 4: Z-Ro) 
 Baby show me some ID, you fine as a mother'fucker but you might be 16 
 And I ain't tryin' to end up in the penitentiary 
 You gon' be screamin' "Daddy, take some of that dick up out of me" 
 When you in the strip club, you work that pole 
 When you in the bedroom, you work that pole 
 I ain't choosy baby you could work me fast or you could work me slow 
 When I be up in the strip club I be tippin' 
 When my rap got the rat Big Hap think I'm trippin' 
 I'm hood bitch and this just nothin' but good livin' 
 Your baby owes me & I ain't even pimpin'.
