(Feat. Slim Thug) 
 Bitch, you ain't gotta call my phone 
 Matta fact all you hoes can leave me alone 
 I just want my money 
 And now one of you nappy-headed hoes goin' get none from me 
 Nigga, you ain't gotta call my phone 
 Matta fact all you niggas can leave me alone 
 I just want my money 
 And now one of my fake ass homeboys won't get none from me 
 Z-RO: 
 I don't need know help my nigga 
 I can do bad on my own 
 And I don't need no company lil momma 
 Even tho I know you give graded on 
 I rather play my Xbox 360 while smoking and sipping drank 
 Ain't even goin' waste no gas, going to get some ass, I'm a keep my gas in my tank 
 Keep my money in my pocket I never leave it with hoes 
 Put a ring on my own finger 'cause I sleep with Z-RO 
 Homie I'ont giva fuck about what you drive or how much money ya got 
 And I don't giva damn if y'all really like me or not 
 I see ya lips moving but I can't hear nothing, 'cause I'm not listening 
 Hoe you only talking to me because my teeth are glistening 
 Y'all niggas be riding dicks so much y'all need a dildo 
 That way when you think about Z-RO, you can shove it up on yo ass real slow 
 I'm a gangsta but I'm a man first, then I tallerate, no disrespect 
 My momma if it's money for me to make weed goin' slip the sex 
 Slim Thug: 
 Slim Thugga, Mothafucka 
 I'm tryna stay rich, fuck a bitch (fuck a bitch) 
 I rather hit the studio and make another hit (another hit) 
 Stop calling on my phone mayn I'm on some other shit 
 Just leave a nigga 'lone, I ain't goin' suck cause ya fucking with 
 Cause bitch you ain't about to get no dime or no quality time 
 I rather be on my grind, smoking weed, writing rhymes 
 All you rapping ass niggas calling me to get signed 
 Want me to rap for free, you done lost yo mind (you done lost yo mind) 
 I'ont care how long I knew ya give a fuck if we can 
 Went to high school together giva fuck if we friends 
 Ya ain't talking bout shit if you ain't talking bout N's 
 Bring ya ten G's, I see what'cha talking bout then 
 All you roaching ass niggas and hoes in my face 
 Can't get it crunk for me, no so don't waste 
 Yo mothafuckin crime tryna plot on mine 
 I got my cash in my stash locked down, so now... 
 Z-RO: 
 It's a shame having a cell phone, but don't want it to ring 
 'Cause I don't wanna deal with bull shit people and the bull shit they might bring 
 That's why I send them the voice mail heaven (I don't wanna talk) 
 Cause bull shit run a marathon, I rather keep it real and walk 
 I don't giva damn how pretty you look, you can still kiss my ass 
 Especially if I die to choose between you and my cash 
 I'm a choose money every time, anyway I always get a new whip 
 Besides, I'm what bitches be tryna find, I'm young, black and I'm rich 
 If you thinking I'm goin' pay money to hit that ass 
 I gotta trick fo yo ugly ass 
 I'll just miss you right after I hit you and then go fuck yo friends 
 Then you'll be ready to committing suicide and then I'll never speak to you again 
 My nigga Gredy, my nigga Rickby, my nigga Michael Coleon 
 There them only three niggas phone number programed in my phone 
 They call me the king of the ghetto, because I rule this bitch 
 I'm bout business I don't participate in foolishness, bitch
