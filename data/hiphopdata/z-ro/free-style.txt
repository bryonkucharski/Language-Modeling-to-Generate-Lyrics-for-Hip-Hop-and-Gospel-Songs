I done linked up, with Presidential 
 (Lyrical 187) 
 In H-Town where I come from, there's syrup in the cup 
 Grill in the mouth, big wheels on the bus 
 Where niggaz put it down, and these hoes will fuck 
 You cross that thin line, and you will get touched 
 1-8-7 I'm telling you, one time is enough 
 Leave your kids at home, cause it might get rough 
 I wreck the mic, like I'm driving drunk on the bus 
 And hit the highway, gotta refill my cuts 
 Out of town, we got the best numbers going round 
 Boys come from Canada, and sco' it by the pound 
 Sounds like another one, Presidential big guns 
 Cocked and loaded, ready cause the battle has begun 
 You niggaz ain't heard yet, them boys on shine 
 Got the do-do in the limo, sitting behind eight mile 
 We put it down down here, on the grind round here 
 If you don't know, you will by this time next year

 Still off the chain 
 St-st-st-still off the chain - 2x 
 (Kevo) 
 Young Fever, M-S-P my team (get it right) 
 Game dirty, but my name stay clean (all night) 
 I keep a nine cocked, locked on the beam 
 Look don't get your head, knocked on the scene 
 You cats couldn't knock, Kevo out the groove 
 Now I'm fever, block bleeder bitch move 
 You can find me on Southcoast, stoke (uh-huh) 
 Your baby mama, bout to shine my spokes (get it nigga) 
 Gun smoke, got my lungs on choke (I'm real) 
 Got my pint by the neck, the head poke (I'm still) 
 Presidential is the home, of my sound (that's word) 
 It's only right, that I hold shit down (it's my turn) 
 I'm tired of niggaz, steady yelling out Spre's 
 They got revolver kits, that bitch sexy please 
 You motherfuckers can't see me with me a flashlight (chamill nigga) 
 You wanna step to Fever, nigga get your cash right (I'm here nigga)

 Man look I be flipping, Expedition 
 Six wood tipping, that boy must of been fishing 
 'Cause he pull out so, many keys 
 Man hold up, I got so many G's 
 I'm from the Clark-a, pull up in the blade in New York-a 
 Wetter than a snorkeler, that boy's just like a shark-a 
 I be sniping on boys, straight strifling boys 
 Letting 'em know I come through, windshield wiping them boys 
 Getting the mouth on it, hollin' at my partna Tony 
 It's that Lil' Mu', got head in the Sony 
 Deck, that boy be wrecking I chin check 
 Young niggaz that, don't show respect 
 I pull up real fast, with a black ski mask 
 That boy go so long, they call him Everlast 
 Enerjog Energizer, man I get wiser 
 Break them boys off, I'm the mic chestiser

 You tripping, 'cause I'm still on my brain 
 You don't like it nigga, deal with it mayn (already)
