Microphone check 1-2 
 Z-ro crookin' in the building 
 Y'all know me 
 But I'd like to introduce to you 
 A friend of mine 
 We go way way way way back 
 Rotha Vandross 
 So if you will, if you please 
 Sittin' in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome 
 Prosecutor don't want me to go back to my house hah 
 Right here, right now he wanna lock me 
 He probly wish another negro brother would've shot me up 
 And he don't even know me 
 He just know what he read 
 But as long as Jesus didn't write then he might be misled 
 Even if he knew I'm a good person he would still be giving 
 Innocence or guilt don't matter 
 He tryin' to get a conviction 
 Day before yesterday I saw a child get 40 years 
 Time gets passed out like candy and you see your mother shed tears 
 Me, myself, I'm facing 2 to 20 messed up huh? 
 Going to trial for something I got a prescription for 
 No attempted murder, no aggravated assault 
 Never ran away from the police, didn't have to be caught 
 And before I'll beat on a woman I'll make my exit 
 The quickest way to get a 5 year sentence down in Texas 
 I walked through straight and narrow though at times I fall off 
 But I have done nothing to nobody so call the dogs off 
 My auntie something like a doctor 
 She prescribed Isiah 54: 17 
 No weapon formed against the shall prosper 
 And I believe it too 'cause I've been in some tight spots 
 No matter what I was facin' Jesus was always in the right spot 
 Nah I can't put my hands on him but I can touch him 
 And when he touch me back he say gangsta don't worry 'bout nothing 
 'Cause you and me 
 And me leaving you alone can never be 
 Even if I'm facing an army 
 Ain't no way they can harm me 
 I'm a stone 
 I gotta go through it a little while 
 But not for long 
 'Cause pretty soon I'll be home 
 Then I won't have to look for heaven in a woman no more 
 Baby momma, drama and fake ass friends 
 And jealousy and envy, it done all come to an end 
 'Cause finally I'm in heaven 
 How ya doin' mama? 
 I haven't seen you in such a long time 
 Well mam, busy too 
 And DJ screw 
 H-A-W-K and Big Moe 
 And P-A-T and the whole S-U-C 
 When I'm asleep or I'm out on my grind 
 I dream of heaven, heaven 
 When I'm facing the worst of times 
 I can still feel heaven, heaven
