 I really don't give a damn 'cause I ain't the one who's gonna take the loss..."

 Chorus: Mýa 
 H U S T L E you know we 
 Run this city baby 
 They can't do it like you do 
 They ain't got it like you do 
 Boss. 
 H U S T L E you know we

 Verse 1: Mýa 
 Every single day I appreciate you give me what I want 
 I know the game done changed but you still remain and you stay posted up, oh, oh 
 And when the block gets hot you know I got you baby 
 Until it cools down 
 I'm gonna stay right here it's forever till we both meet the ground. 
 Get yo' money. 
 Chorus: Mýa 
 H U S T L E you know we

 Verse 2: Mýa 
 Every other day when it rains it pours 
 Livin' in the hood 
 And it's so sexy how you change up the weather report you flip back bad to good, oh, oh 
 And you just the kinda man I been lookin' for 
 So I'm a hold you down 
 And just like Martin needs Coretta, Bonnie needs her Clyde 
 And that's just what I found 
 In you, oh, oh. 
 Chorus: Mýa 
 H U S T L E you know we 
 Run this city baby 
 They can't do it like you do 
 They ain't got it like you do 
 Boss.

 Z-Ro: 
 I'm just ridin'. 
 On my grind. 
 Mýa: 
 All the time.

 (Verse 3: Z-Ro) 
 Damn right I'm a hustler baby 
 I don't move unless it's gon' pay me 
 I know you wanna see me but I don't know maybe baby 
 'Cause I'm tryin' to get rich daily. 
 Damn right I'm a Boss and you know that 
 But when I leave the house I can't wait until I go back 
 I got a miss of mo' packs to get some more stacks 
 From Houston and DC but I'll be back 
 Baby I'll be that 
 I know you like kutch with no C's in the sack 
 I'm just playin' wit you baby, but I know you feel that 
 I'm tryin' to get us a meal, get buck so we can relax 
 Somewhere but can't nobody find out where we at 
 Sellin' a 4 & a halves an ounce was the rest 
 But I'm runnin' this city and can't ? do it like me 
 'Cause I do it like this, gon' be rich. 
 Chorus: Mýa 
 H U S T L E you know we

 They can't do it like you do 
 They ain't got it like you do 
 Boss. 
 H U S T L E you know we 
 Run this city baby 
 They can't do it like you do 
 They ain't got it like you do 
 Boss.
