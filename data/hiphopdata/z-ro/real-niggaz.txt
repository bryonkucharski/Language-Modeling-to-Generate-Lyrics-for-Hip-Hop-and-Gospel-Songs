(*Talking*) 
 2000 Z-Ro, Z-Ro the motherfucking Don 
 Y'all know me, talking about this shife ass life that we live 
 Brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters 
 Fathers killing sons, I mean god damn 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Let me continue by saying, that I don't love these hoes 
 My only love is found Ro, dumping optimoes 
 In an attempt to get lifted, trying to separate the real from the wicked 
 Being grown ain't as easy, as we thought it was is it 
 Nigga but you can visit me in prison, or keep in touch by the letters 
 Just seeing my partnas face, will make me feel better 
 Cause this earth is cursed, so I'm identified by pain in my verse 
 And will the final face I see be a nurse, for what it's worth 
 I wanna die while I'm sleeping, not while I'm creeping 
 Because my closest homies, might be into grim reaping 
 Hard for me to believe, that I became the man I am 
 Went from bible study to moving grams, on a digital scale 
 I make mail, cause in yale I sell 
 Guaranteed to make a profit, never fail 
 'Cause they run and tell more money for me, 'cause I wanna be able 
 Not to ball, but to keep food on the table, believe that 
 Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up 
 Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard 
 I know you don't wanna live in jail, for living shife 
 Hoping you might receive a kite, from your child and your wife 
 Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up 
 Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard 
 I know you don't wanna live in hell, for living shife 
 Dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of your life 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Remember me Auntie, I still got love 
 But somebody been looking for me, so that's the reason I got slugs 
 Loaded up in a twelve gauge, holding it close when I walk around corners 
 Trying to stay sober, to be on my P's and Q's so no marijuana 
 But if it's destiny, for me to fail 
 I'd rather kick it in heaven, and leave the jealous in this hell 
 I'm built to last so I'm gon blast, with intentions to kill 
 Because we living under the devil, for real 
 God don't love the world, Eddie Davis only son to save him 
 If it was me, I would of told my father pop I can't fade it 
 Because the world, is so hateful (hateful) 
 Scandalous, conniving and ungrateful (ungrateful) 
 And if it ain't a nigga from the streets, then look to your family 'cause they gon trip wit ya 
 Wait for you to get paid, and try to sip with you 
 But y'all ain't drinking up out my cup, cause that will leave a poisonous stain 
 It's hard enough to keep my pistol from my brain, maintain 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Rest in peace Grand Pappy Mafioso, day before yesterday 
 Another statistic, cause somebody let the AK spray 
 You know its hard for me to deal with, but I know what I gotta do 
 Get something, to make them hatas blood spill with 
 Kill me if you can, then you's the better man 
 But I'm telling you right now, I'm a motherfucking veteran 
 Gotta spill them niggas be talking about, I'm about to pick this nigga 
 Gotta watch these hoes, because they scan'lous ass dickless niggas 
 And I don't wanna die, so if I have too I'ma blast on sight 
 Better take cover, because I'm coming for your ass tonight 
 And even still, I try to keep my composure 
 But I find myself, drowning in codeine and the doja 
 I'll forever be thugging and mean mugging, while I'm clutching a fat nine 
 Eager to make a motherfucker, flat line 
 But I never start nothing with niggas, I just end it with a bang 
 When you do dirt, you get dirt mayn 
 (*Talking*) 
 Rest in peace Butta Boy, AKA Nutt 
 Rest in peace Malaki, rest in peace LL 
 Rest in peace, all my fallen soldiers in the game 
 Sammy Lee, feel your pain my nigga hold your head 
 Crooked ass cops, living in these crooked ass streets 
 Can't even believe what you see no mo' 
 Let alone none of what you hear, rules of the motherfucking game mayn 
 I just ain't ready to fall short mayn, do or die, real niggas
