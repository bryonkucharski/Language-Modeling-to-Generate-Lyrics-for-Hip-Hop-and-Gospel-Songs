(Z-Ro:) 
 Let me ask you something why you spend all your time talking about me 
 'Cause I'm smokin' drinkin' and getting paid and you still doing bad without me 
 I know you don't want to see me shining I know you want to have what I got 
 But I've been hustling handling my business it's my time wether you like it or not 
 Just stay the hell out my way 
 I'll sacrifice my freedom today 
 'Cause I will blow you away 
 But since your the reason I'm getting paid 
 I really like to thank you cause without your H.A.T.E. 
 I wouldn't be me I like to thank you 
 Your the reason I made it to the T.O.P. 
 I really like to thank you even tho I'm not on TV 
 I'm just another C.D. I like to thank you 
 Your the reason my bank account about to O.D. 
 I really like to thank you

 My mind is made up I'm not going to let you talk me out of my game 
 Even tho it get harder during the 4th quater live got to get the victory mayne 
 I'm a team player when I play 
 So why my team got something to say 
 But they ain't talking about nothing 
 They bumping mad cause the MVP is Mr. Mcvay 
 But they don't give me a lane 
 If they don't I got my three point range 
 Ain't nobody got to cheer for me mayne 
 Don't go no where cause after the game 
 I really like to thank you cause without your H.A.T.E. 
 I wouldn't be me I like to thank you 
 Your the reason I made it to the T.O.P. 
 I really like to thank you even tho I'm not on TV 
 I'm just another C.D. I like to thank you 
 Your the reason my bank account about to O.D. 
 I really like to thank you

 I'm a one man army I don't need no help my nigga 
 'Cause you a buster how could I love yah 
 The only one l love besides myself is my trigga 
 I know you haterz want to see me fall 
 But like Yao Ming I'm still standing tall 
 Even tho my homeboys use to dog me 
 Now they want to out me 
 That's why I sing fuck all y'all 
 'Cause I don't want no friends 
 The love they have is pretend 
 They didn't know me when I went to the pen 
 Now they telling everybody they my next to kin 
 I really like to thank you cause without your H.A.T.E. 
 I wouldn't be me I like to thank you 
 Your the reason I made it to the T.O.P. 
 I really like to thank you even tho I'm not on TV 
 I'm just another C.D. I like to thank you 
 Your the reason my bank account about to O.D. 
 I really like to thank you

 Hay, I'm thinking of a master plan 
 Z-Ro can get a verse for free cause that nigga my man 
 We playing Texas hold'em watch me show him my hand 
 He come home from jail fuck it I'm going to throw him a grand 
 Now my nigga getting tense so things going as planned 
 We dropped Kingz of the South you better check the song again 
 So when you need a tight verse what you going to do 
 Call flipper Ro you got my number fool 
 You get in the game and act like you better than us 
 But we know the truth you ain't getting the chetter like us 
 You livin' a lie we know you ain't a gangsta 
 On the behalf of real niggas I really like to thank yah!
