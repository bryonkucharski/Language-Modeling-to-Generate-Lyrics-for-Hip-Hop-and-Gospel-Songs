We third coast, all about our feddy bleed the block and get ghost 
 Different strokes for different folks, so we choose to cutthroat 
 We ain't riding on no horses down here 
 We get it how we live, that's why it go down round here 
 (Z-Ro) 
 We third coast and I'm a soldier united, for the cash 
 Steady, I be ducking the law cause consistent they clocking cash 
 Moving fast, I'm running around looking over my shoulder 
 Running to use my cash, one of my a.c. tell 'em on E running up my gas 
 I'm just a G, everybody in the streets know me 
 I represent that Killa Klan and the S.U.C., and the Guerilla M double A-B 
 They call me Ro Dog, giving it to you raw, fast or slow dog 
 It just took a little time for me to shine and get up in the game and roll dog 
 Now I'm full grown like H-Town be the aids, Z-Ro done got full blown 
 Then I stood up in the ring 
 And a nigga done bit the dust, but the bill got pulled on 
 And I'll super-soak the crowd, if I have to 
 Nigga with Benjamin faces I be after, then I get ghost like casper 
 Don't work then don't eat, play the game but don't cheat 
 Cause trying to get it up out my stash, I'll have you falling to your knees 
 Please, respect all of us less fortunate G's 
 'Cause we coming up from selling ki's, to straight selling c.d.s 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Who it be Z-Ro, Southside on the map I put it down 
 I'm accurate with my aim, anytime I bu-buck them down 
 Brother don't mess around, give me a chance I won't let you down 
 But if you try to step on my toes, I'ma pull my water pistol and wet you down 
 It be a real deal, watch out lil daddy these Presidential boys real steel 
 Anybody draw they get too close, watch I better get a deal grill 
 For mill candy paint, catch me riding on a full tank 
 Every now and then, a yellow bone I spank 
 I'm about the real, I don't pull no pranks 
 Steady smoking lean, 'cause I'm third with a triple beam 
 Piece and a chain and a diamond ring, and a heavy stay flow up in my jeans 
 The definition of Southside Houston Texas, we drop the top 
 Ain't no way in hell it's ever gone stop, can't stop 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Go on and put me for a show, I want ten grand plus half the do' 
 No sub in the front just plain Z-Ro, not a substitute 'cause I ain't gone go 
 Nowhere life is hard but it's fair, living my life like I don't care 
 Look at my feelings when they get wet, they tend to stare 
 Don't make a sudden move, just may be a sudden death 
 These characters think they bulletproof 
 But evidently, capping must not of been blessed 
 So victory for me, another victim of the mighty Southside 
 Got everybody running back off in the house, and scared to come back outside 
 Radio stations recognize, getting my regular thoughts in time 
 Hate me off that corner, Z-Ro tired of feeling nickels and dimes 
 The definition of a hustler, Houston Texas, we bleed the block 
 Ain't no way in hell it's ever gone stop, can't stop
