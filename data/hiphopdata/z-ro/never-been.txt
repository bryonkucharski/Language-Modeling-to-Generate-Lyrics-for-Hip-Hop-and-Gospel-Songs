The less I fuck with you niggas, the better I feel 
 Don't know no nothin' else what I can be if I wasn't real 
 I borrowed those lines from Plies, that's just how I feel 
 Brass knuckles and a 38 with a beam, that's just how I chill 
 AK-47 and a ski mask, that's how I kill 
 Professional dranka' my nigga, my cup will never spill 
 Where I'm from, the police is the only thing I'll run from 
 Only thang on my mind is money, and what bitch I can get some from 
 I ain't never been a bitch, don't know how to be a hoe 
 Only thing I know how to do is collect my dough 
 So if you owe me money, pay me on time 
 8-7-tre-4-2-4, death before dishonor on mine 
 Me be a punk, I would have to leave this world for that 
 Matter fact my momma coulda' had a girl for that 
 If I hold my hands a certain when I'm in the courtroom 
 That could guarantee me walkin' out of the courtroom 
 Ain't no other rapper got a set of skills like Ro got 
 I swear I'm half a man and half machine, call me Ro-bot 
 You ain't gotta wonder if Z-Ro gon' ever sell out, Z-Ro not 
 From Greenspoint to Mo-City, Texas, all of that's Ro block 
 Kick door burglars started in my hood, so watch yo' door lock 
 Kick that bitch in, roll in yo' shit, take everything and then roll out 
 That was '94, I was hiding out, homicide was trying to find me 
 Ain't that a bitch, now I got my whole city and state behind me 
 I'm cool as a popsicle, in the freezer, in the winter time 
 But I'm a damn fool and a half about respect, so give me mine 
 Uh, so when they lay me in my hole 
 They gon' say that was a man right there homie, I put that on my soul 
 I ain't never been a bitch or don't know how to be a hoe 
 Only thing I know how to do is go get the dough 
 The cheese, the bread, the feria, lucci 
 Hoe I just want what's in your purse, you can keep the cuchi 
 I ain't never been a bitch or don't know how to be a hoe 
 Only thing I know how to do is go get the dough, Hey 
 Even if they kill me I ain't going no where 
 Turn up the volume to the radio, I'll be right there 
 (Ro-Pac) It feels so good to be free, I ain't even thinkin' 'bout a penitentiary 
 Apple sauce and yellow grits, that ain't breakfast 
 T-bone steak and eggs back in Screwed Up Texas 
 Ain't a thang change, everything still the same 
 Haters still hate the gangbangers still bang 
 But we still fuck with it, lil' body that's makin' change 
 Snitches still need a record deal 'cause they still sang 
 You ain't no woman, you a bitch to me 
 And a friend, still ain't shit to me 
 Every time I make a hundred thousand dollars, here they come 
 If I'm doing bad, they the ones I don't here from 
 Y'all niggas ain't real like Hawk and Screw 
 And since y'all ain't them, y'all the ones I'm talkin' too 
 Y'all niggas ain't shit, y'all pussies and some tits 
 But got the nerve to say you a blood or a crip 
 First one to set trip, but the first one to run 
 Own six or seven guns, but you never shot one 
 I pray towards the sun everyday before I'm done 
 When it rain on me it ain't water, it's money by the ton 
 I'm only one man with an Earth worth of foes 
 They hate me in the hood, in public and at my shows 
 If looks can kill I die when they ride by 
 But ask them why they hate me and they don't know why 
 Send a playa through hell and back, then they sent me to prison 
 But check me out homie I'm free and I'm still livin' 
 So many women and men don't want me to win 
 I got God, that's why they bullets can't break my skin 
 Roll foreign in the winter, American in the spring 
 Any other time a playa, stretch Hummer limousine 
 Whether you see me in person, or in a magazine 
 I keep bags of purple, ain't no mo' bags of green 
 I'm white t-shirt, white ones and blue jeans 
 The MVP and the only player on my team 
 The female scream 'cause I'm the man of they dreams 
 I'm represented by my piece, chain, watch and my ring 
 Yeah I'm on the radio, yeah I'm on the television 
 But never sellin' my soul is the most important mission 
 No mo' whippin chickens up in the kitchen, nigga please 
 If I ain't pimpin' my bitches, then I must be over seas 
 I drop a lot of CD's, that's how I make g's 
 So much ice in my mouth, my breath is a cool breeze 
 Pardon my rainbow, a playa just had to sneeze 
 My game tight 360 degrees 
 I ain't a fresh prince, I'm a motherfuckin' king 
 This ain't a pistol, this is a motherfuckin' machine 
 50 caliber brown, and this is something you never seen 
 Big enough to hit when it miss, and it don't need a beam 
 I shake a lot of hands, walk across a lot of stages 
 My signature at the bottom of a lot of pages 
 Even without a diamond I still shine bright 
 And I hog the lime light, that's because I rhyme tight 
 Kush keep my mind right, 'cause I stress so bad 
 Sometimes I lose my temper and get so mad 
 But a voice say, "Ro, focus and get yo' cash" 
 You wanna know if I do that, you better bet yo' ass, BEOTCHH!
