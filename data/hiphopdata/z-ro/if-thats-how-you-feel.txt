(Feat. Lil' Keke) 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill 
 I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to y'all 
 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill 
 I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to y'all 
 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 Hey, you can lean with' it rock with' it if you wanna 
 Do the chicken noodle soup with' me I'm a be in the corner 
 With my drank in my hand check'n out the spot 
 Baby girl do what snoop told you to do and drop it like it's hot 
 Your bodys taken over you don't stop it like it's not 
 Act like you from new orleans and pussy popin' I'm a watch 
 But since I'm by myself I got my pump on me 
 Watchin' out for my enemys because I know they love to jump and dump on me 
 Plus I got dimond as big as lisa rays lips 
 And every time I hit the club I let my chain hang like Lil Flip 
 I know them jackers be out to get me dude 
 But like bonecrusher I ain't ever scared there's a gangsta standin' in my shoes 
 I'm a leave the dancin' to y'all keepin' my back on the wall 
 Man I'm so drunk if I wasn't a playa I would probly fall 
 I'm a head buster 
 But I don't think I'm better then nobody else I just don't move like usher 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill 
 I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to y'all 
 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill 
 I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to y'all 
 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 I'm in chill mode homie anit no frontin' and fakin' 
 Steady laughin' at this niggas out here boucnin' and shakin' 
 Havin' drinks in the vip 
 I'm so clean I see some fellows in the crowd with a dance ruting 
 They got the same clothes on they rollin' and tripin 
 A couple of brauds walk by they start popin' and tickin' 
 Got my back on the wall in the club with' Ro 
 And this part is done tho southside fixin to show 
 I'm on the stage getin' busy tryin' to do my work 
 And all I see is them little jeans and them tight ass shirts 
 God damn little homie what the world comin' to 
 I'm from the old school man we don't dance to screw 
 Tryin' really get my pimp on brawls is boppin' 
 But I'm checkin' out these niggas out here shockin' and rockin' 
 Let them all do they thing cause the game is fair 
 But I'm a gangsta from the south and we don't do that there 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill 
 I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to y'all 
 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel 
 But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill

 But we can party till somebody call the law 
 Now you can harlum shuffle or electric slide 
 But I'm like 3 six mafia movin' my body from side to side 
 Instead of doing the two step I shoot two tek's 
 I anit goin' to even crip walk even tho I down with the blue set 
 'Cause we don't dance in the screwed up click 
 Unless you talkin' about boxin' we can do that shit 
 Lookin' for a cigarello to put my doegha in 
 Movin slow motion like I'm juevanile it soldier slim 
 The club is full of females cocolate, carmel, and bad ass yellow bone 
 Tryin' to put they digets in my telphone 
 The music is bumpin' people throwin' they hands in the air 
 But other then bobbin' my head I'm a just stand there 
 Homie you know I got my weapon in my pocket 
 Might actadently shoot up the club if I actadently drop it 
 So I'm playin' it safe 
 Cause the moves I make 
 Are scareface I can't do the justin temberlake 
 Nigga 
 If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
