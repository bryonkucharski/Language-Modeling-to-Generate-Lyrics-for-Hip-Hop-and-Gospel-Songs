(Verse 1: Z-Ro) 
 When will it ever stop all this hatin' and droppin' salt 
 All I'm tryna do is live lavish with millions in my vault 
 Now from selling crack on the corner I'm tryna do it legal 
 But I guess it ain't no pleasin my people cause everything I do 
 Feel like somebody tellin' me I want succeed 
 But I'm a millionaire and I owe it all to the hatred I received 
 Motherfuckers that use to be down, ain't down no mo' 
 My true partners just can't be found no mo' 
 There fore my motto is 'Fuck Friends'-my only dogg is Benjamin Franklin 
 Tryna take him away from me you gon' wind up stankin' 
 I gotta family to feed so currencies what I need 
 But the people I break bread with would rather see me bleed 
 Tryna take all of my fortune but my fame is forever 
 And S.U.C I'm a claim it forever and I'm still down with the yella 
 So fuck all of these bitches and bitch ass fella's 
 And fuck a 4, it's a PT, glock 50, foes is jealous nigga 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 2 many niggas tryna take me off of my game (take me off of my game) 
 A nigga from the hood didn't live so good 
 Now they all wanna jock my fame (all wanna jock my fame) 
 When I'm comin' down in my foreign 
 And I'm rollin' one-deep that should tell ya about me (S.U.C.) 
 I don't give a damn about none of you hoes 
 I blast on site 'cause I ain't trippin' no more 
 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 As soon as them eyes close it's over and that's that 
 'Cause when they murdered my partner he didn't get to blast back 
 Is that the price to pay just to have nice things? 
 And it's my life in danger because I have ice mayne 
 It's ashame can't even sport our jewerly like we wanna 
 Cause every time we shine them jackers tryna creep up on us 
 Catchin pistol case, after pistol case, ridin' dirty 
 Mr. Officer I'm not a killer just wanna see thirty 
 Cause boys be against me when I roll alone 
 I get full of demon repplings when I'm holdin' on 
 I'm tryna make it, with this gangsta shit I ain't gon' fake it 
 Anything a nigga earned, I'll be damned if a nigga take it 
 Now days the ghetto version of Spundalay 
 A nigga will run up in ya residents with the undelay, cold hearted 
 Just to get they fetti, bustin' brains for a living 
 Disrespecting God's children bitch you made for a prison 
 (Verse 3: Z-Ro) 
 Too many motherfuckers so I'm a hate everybody I can hate 
 And I don't give a fuck about nothin' 
 Fuck-a-nigga, fuck-a-bitch let me get that straight 
 Ain't no love I'm not ya blood or ya 'cause nigga, bitch I'm a loner 
 I'm a asshole by nature you can get with that, or leave it at this bitch 
 The only company I need is weed 
 And since I'm nervous by nature I'm a make you bleed indeed 
 I trust nothing-if I get a funny feeling I'm gon' be bustin' 
 Plus if my blood rushing it'll be more then a concussion 
 From my hitch I see these red dots gonna cover you're brain 
 Nigga I got problems I can't cope-with murder scene to keep me sane 
 One love, to my nigga Moe, and one love to my nigga Redd 
 And one love, to my mothafuckin bread I'm a get that! 
 (Chorus till end)
