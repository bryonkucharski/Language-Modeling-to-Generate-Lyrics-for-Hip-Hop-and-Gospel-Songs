Southern girl, (yeah she a down South bitch) 
 That's all I need in my southern world, (yeah I'm on that down South shit) 
 I'm worth a million, even though I'm in my house shoes 
 She see money in motion, every time my mouth move 
 I'm such an executive, but I am so South too 
 Rifles in all of my rides, under the couch too 
 When I roll up in that Bentley, guess what her mouth do 
 It open up and don't close, like a do' house do 
 You can get some of this penis, but it's gon' cost you 
 'Cause everyday I'm hustling, like Rick Ross do 
 I use to move a lil' hard, lil' soft too 
 Now somebody move it for me, I'm a boss boo 
 If you was a regular broad, I would have lost you 
 Street smart, somebody done already taught you 
 She a red head, but she love the way I floss blue 
 Fuck you to sleep, and steal your shit I showed her how to 
 She ain't a scary bitch, she'll bust you in your mouth too 
 Football player with that work, she run a route too

 Got a thick bitch, down in Memph' 
 Eight ball all shit, space age pimp 
 And my hoes, they don't wear no panties 
 Pick 'em up, in a white Rolls or the Phantom 
 A young nigga, use to rock gold teeth 
 Before the rap shit, I would send a whole key 
 Hoe please, never been a trick 
 Always been a real nigga, on some boss shit 
 Always had a red hoe, that was gun thick 
 She always had stupid head, that would cum sick 
 Down South bitch, I'm talking Atlanta 
 Soul food eater, went to school in Alabama 
 I'm talking bow leg, met her at the galleria 
 Long hurr fat ass, man you gotta see her 
 She for real, bitch run round in a Kia 
 Put her in the Bentley coupe, and moved her to the crib

 I use to be an asshole, now I'm a grown man 
 King of the Ghetto, while ruling over my own land 
 Regular women, ain't invited to my home man 
 Pretty face big booty, whip up a zone hand 
 That ain't sweet and sour chicken, cooking in the kitchen 
 And that ain't just her home girl, they both into licking 
 She'll set you up for that paper, place you into position 
 Them thangs or your life, one of 'em coming up missing 
 She cornbread fed, almost thicker than my pocket 
 Already came five times, but she ain't stopping 
 She fuck with rich niggas, but she don't be name dropping 
 When you see her with them rich niggas, bet she ain't bopping 
 Always see her from the back, she never face front 
 Never turn to comb my hair, that's why she rock a lace front 
 Ain't no handcuffing, you can taker her home today brah
