Too many niggas, trying to take me off of my game 
 Just a nigga from the hood, that's looks some good 
 Now they all want to to jock my fame 
 When I coming down in my ?born? 
 And I'm rolling one deep that should tell you about me 
 I don't give a damn about none of you hoes 
 I blast on sight 'cause I ain't tripping no more 
 (Z-Ro) 
 You can't knock my hustle, ain't no games gone be played 
 Even haters a hundred miles away, deuce out they shades 
 Coming down one deep, I ain't gone stop and try to speak 
 I keep on rolling mean mugging as I pull on a sweet 
 I gave a cool package of sellers, because I knocked down yellas 
 Keep a 4 for myself and a 4-4 for the jealous 
 Cause them boys be scoping, intoxicated and hoping 
 That they run up on Z-Ro I leave they flesh wide open 
 Let them take me for what, 'cause I be damned if I slip 
 Beretta beam in the club same thang on my hip 
 Another case like that, if you don't think I bring that 
 Run on up and I'ma bust and flip your brain like crack 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Nothing but dollars we clock, show after show we gone rock 
 Pimpin' hoes in the five double o and baby mamas gone jock 
 What the fuck is the deal, somebody pass me the kill 
 Rubatussin and marijuana, one time and I peal 
 Don't let a snitch see my dope, cause the snitches gone squeel 
 If they play with my freedom, you know a coffin gone feel 
 Niggas be working with louds, I'm gone work on they jaws 
 Putting snitches in ditches 'cause I know they be talking bout 
 Every move that I make, that's why I be solo when I bake 
 Cooking up in the kitchen come up with a ounce with no flakes 
 'Cause when I say get back, before my finger start itching 
 Better believe when I relieve my stress you might come up missing 
 I don't be kissing no ass, take a hit and dump the ash 
 I'ma chop on 20's with sparkling oak on my dash 
 I'm too low to descirbe, out the Screwed Up tribe 
 Read about it in the Source, Murda Dog and the Vibe 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Remember back in 94 they use to laugh at me baby 
 Now it's year two triple o broads be after me baby 
 Can you recall when I was sparkling now I hide behind 10 
 Cause being in a drop with a escallade I know you want to know where I went 
 I got a bitch named Lucy, for me she sell her coochie 
 Finest in the vagina for lunch when I feel like sushi 
 See it to the day we fall, we ball out of control 
 Everyday at my low key location hoes fall out of they clothes 
 Range Rovers and Hummers, 45 glock gunner 
 Plus I'm a pen pimping veteran, smelling plex among new comers 
 How you love a platinum plack it means I'm already gold 
 It ain't no joke I'm in the scope, five hundred thousand already sold 
 I'm throwed off in the mind, mic and producer and booms no ?reap? in the wine 
 Smoke to relax my mind, radio songs go lemon lime 
 Fuck a neuse a niggas might go thet there to the po po why pop it 
 Giving out my phone number on the daily cause it won't hurt my pocket 
 (Z-Ro: outro) 
 Man, what's the god damn deal, Southside, Northside, Eastside, Westside 
 It's your boy Z-Ro, knocking down the door in year two triple o 
 S.U.C. for life, screw you, it's for you baby 
 Heavy Weighters, my nigga Toon, R-O, Big M-O-E 
 Z to the Ro, Geurilla Maab affilliated, know what I'm saying 
 Putting it down, new millennium it's ours, get that baby
