DJ Drama Queen 
 (x2) 
 Bottom all the way to top 
 And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out 
 No doubt 
 I'm bout my paper so I had to smash 
 150 on my dash 
 So you know I'm rollin' fast 
 All about my cash 
 (Repeat) 
 (Mike D:) 
 Since 16 I can remember a Benz on her 
 Now I'm out in Sunny California 
 On that marijuana 
 I'm talkin' an ole G 
 And the drank got me leaning 
 Put the 84's on a '64 and show 'em how the gangsta leanin 
 I was at the bottom now I'm at the top 
 Switched up my style and they don't like me now 
 I put it in yo face that's why I stay on your mind 
 And y'all can keep haitin but I'm a stay on the grind 
 Can't slack one second can't lack one minute 
 Ain't got a million yet daddy but the plot thicken 
 With that said I will kill niggas dead 
 Go to playing with my bread 
 And I'm a show you how to play it 
 Pass out four and a half 
 The hood a get ya (Third Ward) 
 Somebody should have told that boy I'm bout business 
 24/7 around the clock 
 That's why I get nonstop 
 From the Bottom to the Top (yeah) 
 (x2) 
 Bottom all the way to top 
 And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out 
 No doubt 
 I'm bout my paper so I had to smash

 So you know I'm rollin' fast 
 All about my cash 
 (Z-Ro:) 
 No weapon will prospeer that's formed against me (formed against me) 
 So you can pull the trigger till the clips are empty (clips are empty) 
 Or you can tie a rope in a noose and even lynch me (even lynch me) 
 If GOD ain't ready for me to go you can't send me (bitch) 
 You crab in a bucket holdin' on to my leg (on to my leg) 
 Don't wanna see me make over the edge 
 I'm full speed ahead 
 Nothin' can stop me 
 Even if the prison block me 
 I'm a press 100, 000 and sell each and every copy 
 From a Jalopy to a Jag 
 No more doing bad 
 Who go carry all the money I can't fit in my pants 
 We eat offer 130 hard hits 
 Got a 30 yard 6 
 For you dirty fraud tricks 
 Candy doors open and close 
 On the van and Magnum and the Lac 
 I remember where I came from and I ain't goin' back 
 I ain't talkin' about the hood 
 I'm talkin' about when it wasn't all good 
 Understood

 (Z-Ro:) 
 Ain't no time to play 
 Pull it in perspective 
 Time for hoe checkin' bitch made nigga wreckin and collecting 
 Memory weapon selecting 
 'Cause a mind is a terrible thing to waste 
 I'm a keep my mind in they face 
 'Cause I'm thinkin' throwed making decisions 
 On how to come up on anothe million 
 Even though my people wanna hate 
 I'm in love with my state, yes I am 
 How they feel abou TexasI don't give a damn 
 From the Bottom all the way to the top of another sticky situation 
 Too many women wanna have relations 
 I'm coastin 
 Inside of my trunk is a big commotion 
 Twelve 12's ripping it wide open 
 Don't make me jump executive up in this bitch 
 Double breasted three piece suit with fedora and gator wing tips 
 Everyday of the week I sleep on satin and silk sheets 
 'Cause I got em 
 At the top all the way from the bottom 
 Bottom all the way to top 
 And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out 
 No doubt 
 I'm bout my paper so I had to smash 
 150 on my dash 
 So you know I'm rollin' fast 
 All about my cash 
 Bottom all the way to top 
 And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out 
 No doubt 
 I'm bout my paper so I had to smash 
 150 on my dash 
 So you know I'm rollin'
