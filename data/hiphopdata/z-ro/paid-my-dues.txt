Ya call yourself a hustler 
 Thirty-years-old and still try'na move a fifty pack 
 Little Honda Civic with big speakers in the back 
 Me I'm still a hustler but my product is changed 
 I went from selling crack cocaine to uncut Ro-cain 
 This Ro gain ain't for receding hair line 
 That means every dollar that come in front of me goin' be mine 
 Y'all arguing over corners, I'm taking over town 
 So whatever I hustle I could never be out of bounds 
 Out of five conrads they say they down with me 
 Four want me dead but don't want me to take my fortunate in the ground with me 
 Scheming they plot but don't even know what I got 
 Cause whatever it is I'm doing I seem to have it on lock 
 None of my baby mommas hated to see me come up 
 'Cause I took care of all the children when the times were tough 
 That's what the real hustler do, bring the baking home 
 Not try'na buy rims that cost more than the car that'cha put 'em on 
 Y'all fellas ain't paid no dues 
 Y'all just hustle for shoes and 22's 
 Not taking care of your kids, y'all out there doing it big 
 Like you got something to prove 
 I know you think your the man, you got a lil fifty grand 
 And think ya doing the food 
 But what'cha can't understand is how money flowing in and out of my hands 
 'Cause I done paid my dues 
 I remember when my hustle was the jack you 
 Then exchange your property for some Benjamin's and some Andrew's 
 Hell yeah I was loving it 'cause I was making my cheese 
 But it didn't feel real good once it started happening to me 
 I was reaping what I was sowing, that was that hater-ism 
 I hated to see my pants pockets without some paper in em 
 What'chall know about 72 from 9 in the week's time 
 Without working with a weapon I was winning but what was mine 
 Serious was the game I didn't play with it 
 Even if the clu clux clan wanted to buy it, I was on the way with it 
 I don't smoke crack it's to easy for me to sell 
 But you hustle like Bill Clinton, you smoke it but don't inhale 
 I was taking money to my Annium, they used to take care of me 
 It was time for me to take care of them 
 Unlike a brother that come up and forget about all his folks 
 And be the main one try'na come back and kick it when he go broke 
 Y'all fellas ain't paid no dues 
 Y'all just hustle for shoes and 22's 
 Not taking care of your kids, y'all out there doing it big 
 Like you got something to prove 
 I know you think your the man, you got a lil fifty grand 
 And think ya doing the food 
 But what'cha can't understand is how money flowing and out of your hands 
 'Cause I done paid my dues 
 Uh, It don't matter how much that, it don't matter how much for this 
 Put it on my neck and my wrist 
 White ones, red monkey's and a blue? meoshay? 
 Got fifty people waiting just to do what Z-ro say 
 King of the ghetto entertainment is the drug dealer 
 City to city sending the story of a thug nigga 
 My cup run it over and I'm thankful 
 I won't do nothing hazardous just wish man go break bread with tazardous 
 Re-vanity, lust, the main three thangs that it'll make you end up in the dust 
 Ya seven sins that women and men commit 24/7 
 Ya better watch it or get 187 
 Most of y'all just be talking loud begging for attention 
 I ain't even gotta say nothing than I'm a name they won't forget to mention 
 When I take my last breath, then I'm a part of the past 
 Bury me upside down so all of y'all can kiss my ass 
 I'm a hustler 
 Y'all fellas ain't paid no dues 
 Y'all just hustle for shoes and 22's 
 Not taking care of your kids, y'all out there doing it big 
 Like you got something to prove 
 I know you think your the man, you got a lil fifty grand 
 And think ya doing the food 
 But what'cha can't understand is how money flowing and out of your hands 
 'Cause I done paid my dues
