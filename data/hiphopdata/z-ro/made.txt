Ever since my early teens I've been a loc on these streets 
 'Gold is for 24 I go for broke on these streets 
 My flow is a young Mike Tyson I put the hit on niggas 
 And even when I'm countin' off I still spit on niggaz 
 No super friends I smoke purple stuff alone in my room 
 That cush made me leave my body I was gone in my room 
 Mad swangas, to mo no blocks, I switch cars like socks 
 Either it's somethin' with the roof missin', or a hard white top 
 Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes 
 Now what they spend on a house I blow on designer glasses 
 Even without a platinum plaque, this ain't cappin, 
 I'm just tellin' you what my life like, so this ain't rappin' 
 Don't you ever tell the captain, that my money ain't right 
 I'm a have to pay money, to spray money, cause money ain't right 
 No more throwin' no bodies, so I can stand on these streets 
 I got an army behind me, 'cause I'm the man on these streets 
 I did some time locked down, but now I'm back on these streets 
 Here to save y'all from all this wack rap on these streets 
 I left y'all with I'm Still Livin', provin I wasn't dead 
 If you wonder why I'm out early, my lawyer got his bread 
 Much love to my industry homies, who didn't forget about me 
 Paul Wall, Pimp C and my partner Flip-eraci 
 But since I do business with Rap A Lot the feds watch me 
 But I'm like Shaq up under the backboards you can't stop me 
 When I was hustlin no police could find a rock near me 
 Now that I ain't hustlin they can see all of my rocks clearly 
 B S foldas, ava smokas, these are of Joseph 
 Known to catch you in the club flee and make women wanna come closer 
 Homie don't get it twisted cause you see me on a poster 
 You disrespect me, the magnum come out the holsta like it's 'sposed ta 
 [? ] Man on these streets 
 I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the man on these streets 
 I'm a hitman, whatever I'm aimin at I hit man 
 After I hit her she can't stand up without a kickstand 
 Not a special kind of fool, just hit her with the mule 
 If she find the itch to set me up, I'll hit her with the tool 
 I got a daughter to raise, I ain't tryin' to leave 
 Plus all this money I'm makin' you think I ain't tryin' to breathe 
 Inhale exhale... now that's better 
 Over 800, 000 independent now that's chedder
