Lately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse 
 I used to ride in luxury, now I'm heading for a hearse 
 At least it feels that way, my day-today is full of suffering 
 My headaches can't be relieved by Aspirin or Bufferin 
 Am I tougher than my problems? I'd like to think so 
 But every time I try to rise all I do is sink slow 
 Like I'm out in the Pacific and my vessel capsized 
 Seems like I been going through it since I got baptized 
 (Mr. Jesus, I can feel him all up in my bones) 
 'Cause he be giving me game on how to live my life long 
 Can't forget about the angels in the psychiatric center 
 Helping me to feel like I'm a winner 
 Got me taking Lexapro, just so I can improve my mood 
 It got me feeling like I'm giant, all obstacles better move 
 Or get flattened in the process of me reaching to the top 
 Y'all know that I'm the cream of the crop 
 And all my people say 
 Get your ass up out my way, Satan 
 I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waiting 
 Never again will you catch me living in sin 
 'Cause when the pearly gates open I wanna be stepping in 
 Get your ass up out my way, Satan 
 I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waiting 
 I do away with you devils so I can make it to the top 
 And remain sane, even when a nigga dealing with a lot 
 I'm all alone, but guess what (that's all right) 
 Facing my fears and producing tears (that's all night) 
 Yeah, I'm a grown man but I still cry sometimes 
 'Cause I'm a sponge soaking up pain 
 Trying to come out the rain 
 I been doing right all my life 
 And still suffering by murderers and crooks out here bubbling, I need a break 
 So many decisions to make, I can't concentrate 
 Cause everybody in my life is so fake 
 All the years that I wasted loving and trying to build 
 With somebody who was never even feeling me for real 
 I thought I had a family, but out the window it went 
 With all my legal problems and all these beefing with 30 cents 
 I'm a loner 
 Pill on the post, solo on the corner 
 Bitch don't know nothing bout Joseph 
 She just want Z-Ro to bone her 
 But I'm old school, till I'm in my burial plot 
 I just need a lady to dig me when I'm dealing with a lot 
 Ain't no happy feelings in the air 
 So lately I been searching for happiness through my prayers 
 Holy Father, can you hear me when I'm down on my knees? 
 I need a bridge over troubled water, save me please 
 I'm just a lost soul, trying to find its way back home 
 Everything I love has been taken away from me, now I'm alone 
 But it's all good, tell me when the sun gon shine 
 On this nothing ass motherfucking life of mine 
 Momma, it been twenty years since I seen your face 
 Do me a favor - ask God if I'm included in his grace 
 'Cause I'm feeling abandoned, like the last man standing 
 So much poverty and pain, this ain't the way that I planned it 
 All I wanted was to make a little money and split 
 Take care of my people and grow old with grandchildren and shit 
 I'm still happy, even if my cases don't get dropped 
 And remain sane, even when a nigga dealing with a lot
