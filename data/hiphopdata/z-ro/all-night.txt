(Chorus: Reesa & Z-Ro) 
 Up all night, up all day 
 Up all night up all day 
 See some of us trying to get paid 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I had to keep from going under, like Stevie I Wonder 
 Thinking hard, running out of places to lay my head got me drinking hard liquor 
 Still a go killer, should I rely on my skills 
 In the mist of poverty it must be the straight up get to an ending peal off 
 Recognizing the drama offense of living in my life 
 Got to go get it and come back with it until it's prison in my life 
 Born struggling, a nigga achieved his bubbling 
 The fact that I can't get no job can't do nothing but rub it in 
 20 years old, I was screaming I would reach 25 
 Now 24 and still no dough I started struggle and strive 
 I was a Bridgemont hardhead, yellow and purple repper 
 And never let another nigga check us, nigga that was low yet 
 Use to live with Z-Ro all in your deck 
 But back in 1995 I would have been all in your chest 
 With a pistol grip punk giving up for you gone die tonight 
 Since I'm going through the bitch that more for the night, come off the ice 
 Up all night day, up all day 
 See some of us trying to get paid 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Back in the doghouse, the love I give nigga my cellmate said 
 You reach your freedom when you die but if you rapping single bread 
 Already knowing I'm throwed when my pen is pimping 
 Having visions of me in a V-12 motor corners my benz bending 
 Straight down to the T I'd have a? 
 I promise I'll do it right this time wait till the g get free 
 If I could make the jail house all of that Mo-Town live 
 When I ain't T.W. to the free the rap game is mine soon as I get signed off 
 Lock, a thug nigga fresh out the jail house 
 Still addicted to hustling attempted to pull my steel out 
 Show me the money, I'm gone show what you need 
 Half a ticket and a half-a-gallon and a quarter ounce of weed 
 I'm your mama I'm your daddy I'm that nigga in the alley 
 That when I go straight, but the prices be so cheap in the valley 
 I had to keep my mind right and keep my rhymes tight 
 Praying to god I wouldn't lose my freedom or my life before the limelight 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Motherfucking all night, I put the heat to the dro, pass the lighter 
 Hitting stage till my vision gets brighter 
 Remember poverty, it ain't a part of the plan 
 Cause while I'm on the corner hustling with work in my hand 
 Like a super star selling rocks, because the stage becomes a block 
 But my plot is put my trust up in my glock 
 Z-Ro the ghetto rap versus the world but could I lose 
 But even though I'm still paying dues, I'm still the last man standing 
 With a mad cannon ready to bust 
 Look how I did after I left that nigga dead in the dust 
 'Cause I'ma ride when it's time to ride strictly for cash 
 I'm doing bad so I'm leaning on a beam and a mask 
 A Mo-City nigga, we don't know how to show pity nigga 
 Sold up your block and take over your whole city nigga 
 Me and Skinny Garaw, we at your front door 
 Aggravated 'cause it's tough on the pole 
 (Reesa vocalizing)
