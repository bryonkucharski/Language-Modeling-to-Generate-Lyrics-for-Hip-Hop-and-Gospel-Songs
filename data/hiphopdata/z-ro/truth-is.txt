I don't think I'm the last-I'm the only one of my breed 
 Because I'm unable to trust-unless it's one of my seeds 
 Even still I fall in love with the women who give me nothin' but drama 
 Too busy lookin' for what I'm missin'my mama 
 Keep God first is written on every autograph I sign 
 But hard to practice what I preach, with all this evil on my mind 
 'Cause my premeditation is revenge 
 Not patient enough to wait on God to handle it for me-I come and sin 
 You wonder why I never come around 
 'Cause if I'm goin' through it and we're together you might get a lil'down 
 And I'm not tryna be a party-pooper 
 Even though I'm rich-I'm use to bein depressed, I'm addicted and just can't quit 
 Truth is my situation ain't live 
 My label just paid for lawyers and the advances, and a Chyrsler to drive 
 You wonder why I'm still holdin' this microphone 
 But let the people know that live a life like mine, know that they're not alone 
 (2x) 
 Truth is-everybody love to talk about what's wrong wit' somebody else 
 But I'm not scared, to say what's wrong with myself 
 Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing, again and again 
 But show me money, happiness, and real-true friends 
 Lately I been thinkin' about Rhonda and I miss her 
 But I don't miss my could-be wife I miss my sister 
 I saw you on the news and I'm sorry for ya loss 
 Another baby daddy dead and one more kid around the house (damn) 
 I made I hate you bitch about you and you know that 
 But check this out... sometimes I be wishin' I could go back 
 And undo it, never go through it-try to keep on livin' our lives 
 All I can say today is I apologize 
 Even though you did me bad-I ain't mad, 'cause we both did dirt 
 But you didn't have to steal from me and make it hurt 
 Told the laws that I hit you (bitch)-tryed to send me to jail 
 Then called my phone, screamin you loved me and I loved you as well 
 But after that wasn't nothin' left accept to let my wheels spin 
 Now every time I meet a good woman-I'm afraid to let her in 
 'Cause I don't wanna repeat 2003 
 I know you mad, but if you and the kids every need anything-holla at me 
 (2x)

 Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing, again and again 
 But show me money, happiness, and real-true friends 
 I'd rather walk alone, instead of walkin'20 deep 
 I'm a shepard, but I know I can't handle too many sheep 
 Some say I'm a prophet, some say I'm just tryna earn a profit 
 But if I'm tryna walk right-the Lord gon' keep somethin' in my pocket 
 I curse and I smoke weed and keep a gun in my hand 
 But I never said I was perfect, I am only a man 
 I been to jail a couple of times but that don't mean I'm a threat 
 In fact the Lord was probably protectin' me from my death 
 'Cause I done had so many beef-with other rappers and police 
 And gangbangers that claim what I claim wanna see me Rest In Peace 
 Bury me next to my mama if they lay me down to sleep 
 Truth is I'm not a person, I'm just another CD 
 Man I done tripped out on some of my fans, indirectly 
 So many haters had me thinkin' all of y'all was tryna disrespect me 
 Sometimes I wish I was somebody else 
 But thank the Lord for all of my troubles-cause that's what makes me myself
