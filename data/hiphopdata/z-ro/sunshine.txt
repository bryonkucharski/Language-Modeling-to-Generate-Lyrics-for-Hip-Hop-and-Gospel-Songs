No more letters to the President, this one is to Jehovah 
 What was born into the world as a Christian, now becomes a soldier 
 I'm pimping a pen from living in sin, so niggaz like my song 
 Chef Ro-V up in the kitchen, so these cluckers like my stones 
 Mo City Texas that's my home, but I'm known to be a loner 
 Never no witness to this crime, when I'm creeping the fuck up on you 
 1 by 1 and a cigarette, maybe Newport shorts and a box of possibly Kool 
 Just a nigga do anything to get paid, they say I'm a god damn fool 
 I conversate with mama, but she can't answer me back 
 I'm in a world one deep missing that lady, cause that cancer did that 
 It got a nigga looking for a wife, but most of these hoes be living shife 
 Wait till a nigga get paid then get leid, and try to take a nigga life 
 I just can't take no more my heart is broke, and it got too many cracks 
 Any woman I love don't need a pistol, 'cause she be killing me with that 
 So look into my eyes, and please tell me what you see 
 Will they open the pearly gates for me, I wanna be free 
 I wonder if the sun shines, on the other side 
 'Cause I bet my mama, ain't seen a rainy day since she died 
 And maybe being gone, ain't all that bad 
 It's gotta be better than wasting time, with a pen and a pad 
 Living in poverty, ain't part of the plan 
 So I'm on the corner, hustling with work in my hand 
 I know my mama, wouldn't approve of my lifestyle 
 But see I must get it the way I live, and that's right now 
 My nigga my credit's fucked up, so I can't put nothing in my name 
 Let alone I'm having hard times, maintaining some change 
 I'm so familiar with anger, smoking B can't even stop the pain 
 I walk assured, God please stop the rain 
 While I'm fiending for heaven, seem like hell is what I'm living 
 For my destiny's to die, or forever walk the prison floor 
 How can I be a man, 24 with no home 
 I'm putting the piece to your dome, and leaving it like the ozone 
 A cold cold world, that we living in 
 Killas'll take your life, and it ain't gotta be about no divid-ends 
 Forgive me for my sins, I'm just trying to make it 
 Trying to keep my pistol from my head, 'cause I just can't take it 
 I wonder if the Lord, is gonna show me some compassion 
 Or will I be victim to motherfuckers, when they blasting 
 Having flashbacks of '94, with bullets to the back 
 Cause my homies left me lonely, now my partna is my strap 
 Living everyday like it's my last one, so I'm tripping 
 Keep my finger on the trigga nigga, every time I'm flipping 
 I don't wanna be another face, on a T-shirt 
 So when motherfuckers bring the drama, me and Nina burst 
 Know I need to be in church, but I'm trapped out on the block 
 Pumping rock after rock, God please make it stop 
 I'm a victim of the struggle, trying to make my life easy 
 But it ain't what I expected, it's hectic it's sleezy 
 I'm on my knees daily, asking God to stop the pain 
 Dealing with all this damn strain, see my pistol see my brain 
 About to take my final stand, I'm a man in his own mind 
 Steady hurting, but I hope I heal in time
