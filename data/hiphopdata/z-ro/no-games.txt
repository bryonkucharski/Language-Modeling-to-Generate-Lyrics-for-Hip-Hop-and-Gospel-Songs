Z-Ro: 
 I'm from Missouri City Texas, Ridgemont to be exact 
 Where you haters come, to get your wig stomped 
 And 9-1-1 is just a number, cause the laws ain't coming 
 We all got glock 40's, and let 'em thump 
 So before, I sell my soul 
 A nigga like me'll do my whole sentence, with no parole 
 Damn it I'm tired of falling short, every time I set a goal 
 But if we get pulled over I'm gon claim what's mine 
 Ain't gon try to act like I don't know who it's fo' 
 Y'all niggaz be telling lies, straight up snitching 
 Probably piss sitting down cause y'all women, with your make-up on switching 
 Me I stand up on ten toes, won't fall for nothing 
 Fuck a percentage I need the total, it's all or nothing 
 I never ran from anybody, a coward I can't be that 
 Or get beat the fuck up by one of these hoe ass niggaz, I just can't see that 
 I'm the King of the Ghetto mayn, they call me Z-Ro 
 Yeah it's cool to take a picture, but don't fuck with me hoe cause uh 
 Z-Ro, don't play no games-games 
 Hell naw, I don't play no games-games 
 Stash spot for my burner, in my car do' mayn-mayn 
 Yeah I'm rapping, but I'm still trapping stacking that dope mayn-mayn 
 Z-Ro: 
 If you hang with haters, you might pick up some of they produty 
 Since I love me how I am, one deep is how I gotta be 
 If ends don't make his best friend, the victim of a robbery 
 So I don't expect none of my people, to ride or die for me 
 I handle my own beef, I don't need back-up 
 'Cause if they talking bout jumping me, I'm raising my gat up 
 See all I have in this world, is my balls and my pride 
 Fuck talking about you behind your back, I'm trying to see your eyes 
 Then I say something, unlike these mark ass niggaz because they stay bumping 
 Telling motherfuckers they whip, but can't afford to lay away something 
 And every bad bitch come around, they swear they had em 
 But when they close enough to touch, niggaz won't reach out and grab em 
 I ain't never, had to lie on my poll 
 Cause every time it get swoll, I select something to fold and leave it swoll 
 Hope she don't try to go through my pockets, when I'm asleep though 
 Yeah it's cool to bump and grind, but don't fuck with me hoe cause uh 
 Z-Ro: 
 I talk like and walk like, a gangsta my nigga 
 One in the chamber, in case I meet up with danger my nigga 
 You fail to plan, then you plan to fail 
 I plan on receiving residuals, from all my record sales 
 I stand on stages alone, just me and the microphone 
 Do one of your favorite songs, take some pictures then I'm gone 
 Instead of going to a mansion, I'm headed back to the block 
 It's time to get the trap cracking, I move marijuana and crack rock 
 Not saying that you're bad, for saying I'm chasing cash 
 Cause depending on rap money, I'd be broke and on my ass 
 Whatever I gotta do, to stay up on my feet 
 It's a guarantee I'ma do it, until I see me deceased 
 Now if you do some hoe shit in front of me, I'ma let you know 
 And if it hurts you to hear it, don't come around a real nigga no mo' 
 Take your feelings out your pockets, cause it means nothing to Z-Ro 
 Yeah y'all can make motherfucker feel guilty, but not me though
