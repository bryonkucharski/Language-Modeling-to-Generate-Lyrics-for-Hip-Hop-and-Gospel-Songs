Uh thank the Lord for my fans 'cause they love Z-Ro 
 I get mail but ain't no letters from nobody I know 
 It's like I've been forgotton-every since I got locked down 
 But when my feet hit the ground, that's when phony homies come back around 
 I'm talkin' fair weather friends 
 That kick it with you when the sun shines on you, but when the fair weather ends 
 It's over... nobody screamin free Z-Ro like Bun B was screamin' Free Pimp C 
 Accept Flipperachi and Pimp C 
 But I'm still livin' and still pimpin' my pen 
 I swear I'm surrounded by women-most offenders ain't men 
 They gossip like they sittin' in the beauty shop 
 Can't own nothin-too busy criticizin what the next man got 
 And all I hear is I ain't gon' sack no groceries or work at fast food 
 I would sweep the floor at MacDonalds if I had to 
 Fuck pride homie I'm tryna raise my daughter 
 Hopin' I make parole so I can work on bein' a father 
 Another birthday came and went-still wearin' white 
 I try to sleep all day long, so I can write all night 
 No visits or rec-the only time I get to leave my cell is at chow times and showers 
 Minutes feel as if there hours 
 I read books, tryna put some fat on my head 
 Dreamin' about when I get back on my bread 
 So many people want me to fall-I know they'd love to see me on lock 
 But in a minute-I'll be back on top-in due time... 
 Time waits for no one 
 Last year was a hard one but life goes on 
 I bump my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong 
 I fall off every ten minutes on this mission I'm on 
 Time waits for no one 
 Last year was a hard one but life goes on 
 I never said I was perfect, man I come from the block 
 If it wasn't for time, I'd be stuck in the same spot 
 I can breathe again-pass me a blunt that's fat 
 Plus my strap, so I can face my enemies again 
 July 9th, ain't no more commissary-catch me at Pappadeux 
 Time to get tappered by free world clippers and shop for clothes 
 Plus I gotta leave some people alone 
 That could determine if I go back to prison or stay at home 
 Bottom line-you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time 
 It ain't like it's hard to tell-I've reentered the game 
 Ain't nothin' changed-accept the year 
 When I left people dyin' and death is still here 
 As if we fear nothin' man enough to kill somethin' 
 But too coward to come together and build somethin' 
 Violent crimes, the caskets are smaller in size 
 How the hell a ten year old get shot-eleven times 
 Prison ain't changed me, I'm the same nigga 
 Not a trouble maker but y'all know I'll never hesitate to pull-a-trigger 
 They say my ghetto instrumental is influential to black 
 I just confess how far I go, not to get put on my back 
 I never made a man kill a man 
 Even if he was bumpin' my song at the time-murder was his original plan 
 I understand it's a time to be born and a time to die 
 Time to laugh and a time to cry 
 A time to look for somethin' and a time to consider it lost 
 Time for sadiness and a time for joy 
 A time to build and a time to destroy 
 A time for war and peace 
 A time for silence and a time to speak 
 And I think it's time we come together on these streets 
 Fill up churches Sunday mornin' like clubs-Saturday night 
 And have a good worship service-just like we have a good fight 
 'Cause when the trumphet blows it's over, time is at it's end 
 If you don't wanna burn, forever repent for all of you're sins 
 And homie I don't give a fuck, if you blood or cause 
 Get you're relationship right with the one above 
 'Cause it's almost time... 
 Time waits for no one 
 Last year was a hard one but life goes on 
 I bump my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong 
 I fall off every ten minutes on this mission I'm on 
 Time waits for no one 
 Last year was a hard one but life goes on 
 I never said I was perfect, man I come from the block 
 If it wasn't for time, I'd be stuck in the same spot
