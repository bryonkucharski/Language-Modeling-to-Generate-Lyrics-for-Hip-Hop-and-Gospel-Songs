(Z-Ro) 
 Hey, why they hate me like I stole something 
 To make a nigga want to roll something 
 But I'm they closest partner, if I let them hold something 
 Good for nothing, but making me hate my peers 
 So let the world taste my tears 
 When they roll, they represent anger, paranoid with one in the chamber 
 To live the heads shots to my foes, and make them through with Dana 
 And when they splash it's a blood bath, and I trust no one 
 Ain't no more chunking up the deuce, when my thugs pass 
 Live my life in silentary vomet away from y'all 
 If I needed artillery could I even get the K from y'all 
 I'm all alone in the ways of the wicked, since I can't stand you hoes 
 Forever lonely when I kick it, in the lumino 
 With straps and shells, my life is murder and mail 
 The opposition see me coming, and they blast they self 
 This for my homies that don't know me, when I'm broke 
 Swear to God I hope you motherfuckers choke, when my gun smoke, hate 
 The H is for these hoe niggas that's all in my face 
 And the A is for the actions that these bitch niggas take 
 And the T is for the tommy gun that's bout to blast 
 And the E is for eternal 'cause I ever last 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I be feeling like Pac, because I wonder if they still down 
 Facing homicide from haters, but my homies didn't even spill rounds 
 Fuck y'all, I hate you motherfuckers to death 
 Remember times, when I stopped niggas from clutching your chest 
 I live in bulletproof vests, but it seems 
 The only time I got family, is when a nigga dream 
 So fuck sleep, I'm on a 24 hour grind 
 Look at your darling son, now mama I'm out of my mind 
 I don't know how to be happy and I can't smile, and fuck a bitch 
 'Cause she be plotting on how to get you, when y'all walking down the isle 
 The same motherfuckers that you care for, look how they do you 
 They don't love you pick up your pistol, and therefor 
 Represent yourself with the plastic, cause me myself 
 Want to put all of you motherfuckers in caskets 
 Fuck love, unless it's coming from the heaven up above 
 My hatred being written in blood, hate 
 (Z-Ro) 
 There ain't no telling if a nigga make it, I might be stuck in the slums 
 A walking target steady ducking the gun 
 But even me and you can keep your wife, there'll be no hostages 
 Just give me what I'm looking for, and keep your life 
 I'm military minded, you can ask Klondike Kat 
 Even if they bomb first, Z-Ro is bout to bomb right back 
 I give a fuck about your life now, slugs hitting your windpipe now 
 Guess you could say I'm living shife now 
 All about my fetty, till I bubble like some champagne 
 Z-Ro the Crooked, the most valuable player up in this rap game 
 So back back, back back, be sure to give me more than fifty 
 Automatic rounds, down to pass that 
 Murder my foes, then I murder my friends 
 Because they turned on a nigga, when I ain't have no ends, hate 
 Murder my foes, then I murder my friends 
 Because they turned on a nigga, when a nigga wasn't chopping a Benz, hate
