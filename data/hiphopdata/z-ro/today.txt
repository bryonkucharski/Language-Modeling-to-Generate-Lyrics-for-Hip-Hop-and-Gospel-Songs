Uh oh, Z-Ro the Crooked 
 And my mo'fucking brother from another 
 K-Rino the Wizard, that's right 
 Oh naw, don't run now nigga 
 Strap your seatbelt on homeboy, dig these blues 
 (Z-Ro) 
 I needed assistance, but I gave help 
 And carried people on my shoulders, when I could barely cary myself 
 God love it the cheer forgiver, check out second Corinthians chapter nine 
 Every ten dollars I had, was really five 
 Damn near every time, 'cause I don't want my people to suffer 
 But these the same people, love to see my tough times get tougher 
 I feed 'em when they're hungry, even though when I'm starving they let me starve 
 And make fun of me, whenever I'm behind bars 
 As if I'm robbing and killing man 
 What's funny is they hate a man, that's trying to do right but they love a villain 
 The devil is an infection, but God is amoxicillin 
 The cure is heaven, and life is a sickness that needs healing 
 K-Rino say I'ma make it, but when 
 (Trying to understand why your life is so troubled, is like chasing the wind) 
 All I can do, is keep my mind focused on heaven above 
 And remember, the Lord chastises the ones that he love 
 Try to make it through today, don't worry about tomorrow 
 Tomorrow gon' be full of it's own problems anyway 
 Try to make it through today, don't worry about the past 
 Let that be motivation, to face obstacles in your way 
 Is this what I gotta go through, to get to heaven 
 'Cause I feel like I'm about to lose it, I just can't take it anymore
