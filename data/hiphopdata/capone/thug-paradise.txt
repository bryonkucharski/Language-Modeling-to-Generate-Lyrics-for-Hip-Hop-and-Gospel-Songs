I am the one, Orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand 
 My image is of agony, my servants rape the land 
 Obsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vain 
 Two thousand years of misery, of torture in my name 
 Hypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the law 
 My name is called religion, sadistic, sacred whore. 
 I twist the truth, I rule the world, my crown is called deceit 
 I am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet 
 I rob you and I slaughter you, your downfall is my gain 
 And still you play the sycophant and revel in my pain 
 And all my promises are lies, all my love is hate 
 I am the politician, and I decide your fate 
 I march before a martyred world, an army for the fight 
 I speak of great heroic days, of victory and might 
 I hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be brave 
 I lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your grave 
 Your bones will build my palaces, your eyes will stud my crown 
 For I am Mars, the god of war, and I will cut you down.
