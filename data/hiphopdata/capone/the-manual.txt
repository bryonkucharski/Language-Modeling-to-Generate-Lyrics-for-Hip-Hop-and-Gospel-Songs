(Boo) 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 [Chorus:] 
 Yo, These are the do's and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump 
 These are the do's and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped 
 Do ride to the death, don't fuck with jake, 
 Do squeeze on a nigga find out he a snake 
 Don't walk in my hood after 11 or 12, 
 Do the right thing and always stack money for bail, 
 Don't fuck with the soft, do fuck with the hard, 
 Don't ever wear a walkman when you spin in the yard, 
 Do come through prepared, don't wait to blast, 
 Do ????????????????????????????????????? 
 Don't think you gunna' win if you likin' that ass 
 Do your business in person don't talk on the jack 
 Do know the consequences getting caught and a tap 
 Don't let a nigga put a battery in your back, 
 Do salute me when you see me, don't fuck up a pact, 
 Do realize the villain of the city is back, 
 Don't shoot it in air waste bullets for that, 
 Do understand these codes or you will get clapped, 
 [Chorus:] 
 Yo, these are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped 
 Don't fuck with white liquor, do shots of the yaght, 
 Don't trust when you see a nigga hoodied in black, 
 Do whipe your prints off when you tossin' a gat, 
 Don't let a 10-4 get a nigga the snatch, 
 Do the white air forces, keep a tee to match, 
 Don't fuck with my good boy, breath with that, 
 Do look out the peephole before you leave, 
 Don't let a nigga catch you comin' out the crib and squeeze, 
 Do push her face down when she givin' you top, 
 Don't let her spit it out make her swallow every drop, 
 Do watch for the feds, cuz they seekin' indictment, 
 Don't go do a hit a buck and whip out hydrant, 
 Do walk around New York vest under your jacket, 
 Don't promise a jail nigga, kites in a package, 
 Do smoke till they have your last bag of piff, 
 Don't fuck with a drug that'll make you scratch and sniff, 
 Do understand these codes, or you will get clapped, 
 Don't forget to put it down like an OG black, 
 Yea yea, these are the codes, this is the manual, 
 You must abide by this 
 [Chorus:] 
 Yo these are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped 
 Do take A or C, don't neglect the kids, 
 Do ???????????????????????????????? 
 Do the math, look at all the bodies droppin' 
 Don't front on your soldiers, take em' out gun shoppin' 
 Do wear a seat belt when you hop in, 
 Don't open they knockin' to ask around, ain't nobody can stop em, 
 Don't fuck your man family, that shit is a problem, 
 Do live by this manual consider the doctrine 
 [Chorus:] 
 Yo these are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump 
 These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
 I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want 
 Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump 
 Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped
