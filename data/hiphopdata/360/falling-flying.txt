Yo, He tries to stay positive, livin' in a dead town, 
 He can't keep his head up, he has to keep his head down 
 He only sees ahead now, the loneliness has left 
 And he's focused and he's over being left out 
 He don't need anyone now, 
 He's givin' everythin' now, 
 Look in his eyes and see it's evident now, 
 When he, told himself he would never be left in the ground, 
 For those who told him he would never be anythin' now, 
 He's known what he wants want he grows up, 
 He'll do anything it takes, cause it means so much 
 And it's his ego tellin' him he sees no love, but now he sees it's irrelevant, 
 He needs no one 
 But see, as he's tracing up the outline, 
 He found a plane he created to take him from the downtime, 
 And as he waits for it to land, when he makes it up to cloud nine, 
 All he's gonna say is it's about time 
 Now that I'm all inn, I hear 'em calling up again (calling up) 
 I knew the moment that I was flying, I'd be there, calling up 
 And from the start though, they always tried to single him out, 
 It was hard though, 
 It almost started bringing him down 
 And now he laughs at attempts at always peaking him out but now they can't, 
 He ain't listening now (he ain't listening now) 
 They use to hit him, it'd shit him so he'd fight back, 
 And then he stopped once he figured out they liked that 
 He knows exactly what it's like to be the underdog, 
 Words had led him thinking and surprised him at the fucking top 
 And now they got him, he's backed in a corner, he's trapped 
 But if he starts to relax he's a goner 
 In fact, he doesn't wanna be that kid at all, 
 And they talk, but now he doesn't hear that any longer 
 He's fighting to make a million, 
 Hiding away and feeling 
 He's trying to make a killing but dying to make a living 
 And now he's knowing it's a state of mind, 
 Hoping in his day and time maybe he's finding that place within him 
 Now that I'm all in, I hear 'em calling up again (calling up) 
 I knew the moment that I was flying, I'd be there, calling up 
 And he sees the big picture, what's the point in being narrow minded? 
 The ladders high, but he's knowing that he has to climb it 
 All the shit he's sacrificed, knowing what he has inside, 
 He's ready and he doesn't need a map to find it 
 It's the muscle in his chest that is pumping all the blood until he's dead, 
 Knowing nothing will be left 
 And he can't let it go, it's hard to let it be 
 And you can call it pride, but he can't accept defeat 
 And this for those who ain't got no voice, 
 It ain't whether he can do it yo, he's got no choice 
 Now he's got his armour on, and they cannot stop him 
 Shoot what they want to, watch the bullets bounce of him 
 He finds it funny now that people that doubted him, 
 Have a look and you'll see that they're around again, 
 Because they know now (they know now) 
 They see him just standing in the corner with a smile as it goes down 
 Now that I'm all in, I hear 'em calling up again (calling up) 
 I knew the moment that I was flying, I'd be there, calling up
