Tell me what I've done wrong but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 They tell me that I'm alone but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 Uh yeah 
 Welcome aboard 
 We don't want to make this album small 
 So, tell you mates that we will sell some more silly 
 Man, I'm hoping that Melbourne's all with me 
 Take them on the road to help perform with me 
 I ain't even gonna waste a breath 
 And I ain't even gonna break a sweat 
 I came with the aim to get the same respect in one year 
 As these lames that have played for ten 
 See a lot of them have played to death 
 Yo I don't hate them but honestly I ain't impressed with them 
 See you gonna wanna change directions 
 They be second 
 But don't place me next to them 
 I'm in a league of my own 
 And if they don't like it 
 Then each to their own 
 See, I don't listen to the hate 
 I don't need it to grow 
 And I know that I reap what I sow 
 So go ahead and 
 Tell me what I've done wrong but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 They tell me that I'm alone but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 I was a young kid 
 Overly known for dumb shit 
 I had a big mouth 
 I was know to run it 
 Only some didn't think I'd overcome it 
 The only percentage that I know is a hundred 
 Yeah, I ain't following leaders here 
 Nah ah, cause honestly I ain't gotta compete with them 
 Nah, I gotta team I gotta believe in 
 And it's my turn to be on the receiving end 
 We won't ever be fallen 
 I brought 'em a life 
 They will never be bored in 
 I walk in the life 
 While I'm kicking the door in 
 And show the motherfuckers that I am putting my all in 
 Uh, they can see that my sound is changing 
 Cause to me, I believe that they are outdated 
 And it seems that the crown's vacant 
 And to take it I need to be ground breaking 
 And so 
 Tell me what I've done wrong but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 They tell me that I'm alone but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 The fear is gone and I don't care, I feel fine 
 Yeah I'm OK 
 The fear is gone, I still don't care, I'm feeling fine, 
 Yeah I'm OK 
 Uh yeah, yo ah 
 Yo I don't like thinking what could have been 
 But I can't help hating what shouldn't be 
 See a lot of people wouldn't dream 
 Even when they are put to sleep 
 But you can tell when you look at me 
 There's things that I've wanted to say 
 I'm gonna bring in a positive change 
 That's a promise I've made 
 And I'ma take that blame 
 And haters are all good, I'll be a OK 
 Tell me what I've done wrong but I'm OK, I'm OK 
 They tell me that I'm alone but I'm OK, I'm OK
