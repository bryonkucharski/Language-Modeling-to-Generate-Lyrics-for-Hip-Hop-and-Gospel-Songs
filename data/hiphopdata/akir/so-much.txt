Akir: 
 The world we live in, requires us to develop this ego 
 It defends us from criticism and hides our insecurities 
 And we wear this facade as a badge of pride so long 
 That we forget what's truly underneath 
 It's the points where we at our loneliest and darkest moments 
 That it becomes apparent, there's still, so much 
 Dead or alive I will survive, yo I'm tried and true 
 Trials that you get through and tribulations that'll send you 
 To the nuthouse, big house or dirt dig'd out of the earth 
 And headstone just to honor your worth (just to honor your worth) 
 Engraved with your birthdate and models poppin' bottles at the bar 
 A big car that we brawl over, the way it's are 
 We gettin' over even classy in the Range Rover 
 He feels threatened, protectin his thoughts as a soldier 
 The older we grow, the more sober gets old 
 The high, of adrenaline barely compares to modern medicine 
 Then again if we lived like we supposed to 
 Smokin' chronic, drinkin' tonic out in Acapulco, you say "Let's go" 
 But it would probably drive us loco, enough to go postal 
 Fuck around and have a choke-hold on a local 
 Until you see the po-po, I'd say the system definitely hope so 
 There's so much that's in my soul, yo 
 x2: 
 So much we need to know, so much we need to blow 
 So much that we need to show, so much that it's in my soul 
 So much we need to grow, so much we'll never fold 
 So much that a nigga owe, so much that it's in my soul 
 So much... 
 (Piano plays to the end)
