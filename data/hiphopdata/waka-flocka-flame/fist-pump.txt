Do you know where we at now? (at now) 
 Drinkin' bottles till we pass out (pass out) 
 They don't even know how to act now (act now) 
 Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air... 
 Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump

 Baby jump around for me, bounce 
 Say that shit now break it down for me (down for me) 
 Let's hit the buckle, couple rounds with me (rounds with me) 
 Grab my hand, let me take you to VIP (chuck chuck VIP) 
 See, my life is like a movie 
 Patient, what the fuck is you thinkin'? 
 Better yet, what the fuck is you drinkin'? 
 Better yet, what the fuck is you smokin'? 
 What's hapennin'? What's up? 
 If you feel like me, you're fucked up, put your cup up 
 I'm in the club poppin' bottles, got a girl drunk 
 Say the instance of a fist pump 
 If you that call, if you that jump 
 Arms in the air, Shawty do the fist pump 
 Do you know where we at now? (at now) 
 Drinkin' bottles till we pass out (pass out) 
 They don't even know how to act now (act now) 
 Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air...

 Fuckin' off the club when we fist pump 
 Whole party lookin' at us crazy 'cause we destruct 
 My body showin' symptoms of liquor in my system 
 Her booty workin' hard like it's time to own a pension 
 Now listen: face face I'm drash 
 Don't really wanna see me no more 
 Can't say we gang high, ballin' like a bank shot 
 Around, get your ego broke 
 Last time I was dissed up 
 I swear it was a year ago 
 From standin' up when we leave the club 
 I'm a call that shit a miracle 
 Cause damn, I'm gold 
 Twist up, mixed up, twist up 
 And her booty too big for the seats in my coup 
 I'm a have to put it in the pick-up truck 
 Damn, I'm gold 
 Mixed up, twist up, mixed up 
 And we feelin' leave here with so many bad bitches 
 We gon have to take 'em home in the pick-up 
 Do you know where we at now? (at now) 
 Drinkin' bottles till we pass out (pass out) 
 They don't even know how to act now (act now) 
 Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air...
