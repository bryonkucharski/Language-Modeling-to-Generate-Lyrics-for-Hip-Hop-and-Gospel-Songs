My partner got murked, friends turning phony 
 Next door neighbor trying to put the people on me 
 Life's a bitch, I see a brother death creeping on me (On Me) 
 Pain I write it on me, watch these label's trying to clone me 
 Pain I write it on me, Pa-Pa-Pain I write it on me 
 Pain-Pain I write it on me, watch these label's trying to clone me 
 Pain I write it on me, Pa-Pa-Pain I write it on me 
 Pain-Pain I write it on me, watch these label's trying to clone me 
 I've been going through so much, I've been thinking about so much 
 I don't know who to trust or who to believe 
 A couple of friends, a couple of fans, and my family 
 I'm a ride until the end, ain't no fear in me

 Life's a bitch, I see a brother death creeping on me (On Me)

 Count my days and blessings, for every mistake made was a life learned lesson 
 Swear I ain't flexin', police pulled us over 'cause the color of my complexion 
 And our hair style, now we standing on trial 
 Me against the world so I'm voicing my opinion 
 Did I forget to mention how they stole my momma credit 
 And our blue print, gave it to another nigga 
 Left us on stuck, got us fucked up 
 December 16th, a part of me died 
 Part of me stayed strong but a part of me cried 
 Pardon me on the song while I'm spilling my pain 
 A part of me getting weak when they mention your name 
 It go R.I.P. Slim D (Who?) 
 Hating niggas took your life over envy (True!) 
 A lot of snakes in the grass won't protect me (Yes!) 
 When I make it to the gates don't reject me (Yes!) 
 I've been going through and don't know when it's my turn (No!) 
 So I just sip a little and let the ganja burn 
 Everything I do, I do it for my family 
 And my heart to big to have (???)

 I wish I could fly away 
 I wish I could fly away 
 I wish I could fly away 
 I wish I could fly away
