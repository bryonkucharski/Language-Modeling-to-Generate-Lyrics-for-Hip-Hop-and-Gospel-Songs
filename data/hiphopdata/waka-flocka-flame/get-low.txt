 Get it low, to the floor 
 Lemme know, what's up with us 
 Get it on 
 I wanna get you home

 Ooh, she's just my type (Flocka) 
 Hair long and her eyes light 
 Her smile shine like the sunlight 
 One of a kind, baby momma type 
 Friend muggin, she the hater type 
 Waka Flocka, I'm the player type (Flex) 
 Jewelry bright, winter white 
 Champagne chilled on ice 
 Hold up! 
 Every bad bitch in the club to the dance floor 
 Hands on your hips, get real low 
 Throwing money, my M.O 
 So slot me your info 
 Let me know, what you doing tonight girl

 Pop star, but I fuck him like I'm still hood 
 Heard he wanna spend money on a red bitch 
 Wanna see me do tricks with the next chick 
 Anyway boobs up and my ass out

 Big nicki in the game nigga brick squad

 Somebody better get da bitch another round, ah

 They your size, little waist don't match your thighs 
 Say you're on my level but my level too high 
 Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised 
 I know you ain't heard that, before 
 Searching in the club and I just found one 
 Pick up lines, I just dropped mine 
 Single for the night, tryna double my fun 
 So what's up, to the bad bitch 
 In the corner, with her ass big 
 And her hair long, I'mma grab it 
 She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard 
 Like, I ain't tryna be horse and carriage 
 Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit 
 I just wanna smash it, smash it 
 Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is 
 But first lemme see you... 
 Lemme see you 
 Get it low, to the floor 
 Lemme know, what's up with us 
 Get it on 
 I wanna get you home
