Grove Street, Flocka! 
 I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me 
 Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin' 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk 
 Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 I step in the club, rolling up that loud shit 
 My weed keep your security sayin' be quiet 
 My bread startin' a riot, your girl gettin' excited 
 Hold on wanna try it, I'm like why not try it 
 My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it 
 Club goin' stupid, when I O Let's Do It 
 You ain't gotta chew it, jukin' and she movin' 
 Grove Street villain nigga who you killin'? 
 Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million 
 Jacksons to the ceilin', that's how we ballin' 
 You know that I'm rollin', throwin' up the mean bread 
 Now I'm 'bout to meet her in the club with a heater 
 I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me 
 Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin' 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk 
 Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 A party ain't a party 'til I walk in it 
 Lime green flap match the fitted and the linen 
 Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kinda tinted 
 'Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinnin' 
 I'm rollin' like a mothafucka, I'm a roll out in this mothafucka 
 I'm Roscoe Dash it, I'mma 'bout to show out in this mothafucka 
 My jewelry game on frost about to snow out in this mothafucka 
 Ay Flocka get them burners let's pull out in this mothafucka 
 Ay mothafucka what the hell is you rockin' for? 
 Run up on me and my squad, no that shouldn't be an option so 
 Somebody better let you know I suggest that you let it go 
 This is Grove Street party safe niggas hit the exit door 
 I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me 
 Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin' 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk 
 Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 Rollin' on them leaves, you can do the lean 
 Blowin' on that loud perp, pass that Bobby Brown back 
 The hood got my fuckin' back, the streets I'm not duckin' that 
 Please step the fuck back, Grove Street yes we are back 
 Hood plus I'm legal rich, every ghetto feelin' this 
 20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist 
 100 on my neck iced out for my respect 
 20 fuckin' 10, I'mma blow the whole check 
 In the club flex, after party flex 
 You know how we ball, all I know is ball 
 Every dollar in my pocket I'mma spend it all 
 When a nigga die, they gon' say shawty raw 
 I gotta a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me 
 Bottle keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin' 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk 
 Roll up the loud, I'm tryna get fucked up 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party 
 It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
