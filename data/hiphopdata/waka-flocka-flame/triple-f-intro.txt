See, my friends showed me so much 
 Good or bad, they all I had 
 Reminisce on the past 
 And the to the ones that passed lift the glass 
 See my friends, DOWN 
 All for one, one for all, we gon swang 
 If you ballin', do yo thang 
 Tell a hater kiss your ass 
 Where y'all was when we was eating dolla menus? 
 So close to a homeless man pickin' trash 
 See my friends, they was all I had 
 They showed me so much unconditional love shorty real 
 Shit I'm mentally home alone, so I'm kickin' down does 
 Lying niggas on flos' 
 See my friend they all I had, showed me so much good or bad 
 You don't like how we live, nigga kiss our ass 
 If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up 
 If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up 
 If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back 
 If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back 
 They wanna see me dead and locked up 
 They wanna see me dead and locked up 
 If you ballin' if you if you if you ballin' 
 Put your cup up, why they wanna see me locked up?
