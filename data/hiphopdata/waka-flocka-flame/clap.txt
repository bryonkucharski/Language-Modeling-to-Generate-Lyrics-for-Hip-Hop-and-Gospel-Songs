Flocka 
 I love money and she love me back 
 Money in my stomach got me lookin' like I'm fat 
 Throwin' my ass cap, watchin' strippers bring me stacks 
 I got a whole lotta this, got a whole lotta that 
 Got me feelin' like I'm cap, why these rap whack? 
 I get money good, got them girls fuckin' with me 
 Pink Panther chain screamin out where is Nikki 
 Autograph my CD, catch me on TV 
 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money 
 Clap clap clap throw some money 
 Slap her in the booty, with some money 
 (Flocka Waka Flocka Waka) 
 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money 
 Clap clap clap throw some money 
 Slap her in the booty, with some money 
 (Flocka Waka Flocka Waka) 
 Pink Panther chain, you can call me walkin' lean 
 Watch codeine, bracelet promethazine 
 Rollin' up them beans, cold Shawty clean 
 Diamonds on my rappin' jeans, I call 'em record deals 
 I'm a shiny ass rolemodel, 20k for Remy bottles, 
 That's that white clear shit, I don't fear shit (MONOPOLY) 
 I'm my CEO shit (MONOPOLY) 
 I'm a artist with a artist, and his single hard as mine, that's real shit 
 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money 
 Clap clap clap throw some money 
 Slap her in the booty, with some money

 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money

 You ride big rims, I ride factories 
 At my concerts girls be chasin' after me 
 I swear they be attackin' me, hoetel pornography 
 I got to be so brick squad monopoly, 
 Invest back in my company, ain't no breakin' me 
 I can fit a hundred thousand dollars in these Dickies 
 The number 1 one song in the world fuckin' with me 
 I'm a smoke 3 thousand bells of load this year 
 Waka flocka flame! 
 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money 
 Clap clap clap throw some money 
 Slap her in the booty, with some money

 Clap clap clap for my money 
 Clap clap clap if you count money 
 Clap clap clap throw some money 
 Slap her in the booty, with some money
