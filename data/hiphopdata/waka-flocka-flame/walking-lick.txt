Quiet? No I can't be quiet 
 Shit, every time I talk that's Brick Fam. Holiday! 
 That's 185 right there 
 Yo Gucc! I know you got like 10 birds when we walk in the club nigga 
 You know what it is - Trap Back baby! The streets is hungry 
 Eighty grand in my Robin jeans 
 It's hot outside, but I'm coolin' it 
 Top on down but I'm losing it 
 Mind gone with a foreign chick 
 With a Tech-9 with a cooling kit 
 Got the black jeans with the wings on 'em 
 Gucci shoes, no shoe-strings 
 Shit, every word means two things 
 So the white girl is my boo thang 
 And I'll come in due time, in the drop head at the blue flame 
 And I don't like to see no new faces 
 'Cause I don't like to learn no new names 
 I go to sleep in foreign places 
 Wake up, count big faces 
 Stuff cash in suitcases, pillowcases I'm two faced! 
 I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, I'm talking shit 
 Millionaire with Trues on in a stash house with shoes on 
 Put a million dollars in my new home 
 And a quarter million in my trap house 
 Put a half a mil in your bank account 
 Nigga, serve dope in my zone 
 Cooking the work with no gloves on 
 So the junkies can get they grub on 
 My OG with capital letters 
 On Capital Ave. with white leathers 
 In a 68 Camero, no top on, I'm put together 
 I got salt and pepper, no Spindarella 
 Stupid cheese, that's Mozerella 
 Bust 'em open, put 'em back together 
 Then sell them to you, ahead of schedule 
 I heard a price tag on my head! (Flocka!) 
 I'm a walking lick! 
 Nigga, come and try, you gon end up dead bitch 
 ? Roadkill, my niggas they so for real 
 20 minutes from my hood, I don't need no house on the hill! 
 Reachin' for my tech, your mama better write your will 
 She gon get ugly, my youngest pop about two pills 
 Where them niggas before and with this record deal 
 Me and Gucci Mane, bitch, we hard to kill
