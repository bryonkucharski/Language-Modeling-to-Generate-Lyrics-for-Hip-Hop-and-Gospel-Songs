I'm flexin', I'm flexin' 
 I'm chillin' in our sessions 
 I'm in my private section, give me pussy then I'm sexin' 
 I'm flexin', I'm flexin' 
 What she know 'bout flexin'? 
 Might pull up to the Weston and hella girl undressin' 
 I've this ice on me but my heart cold 
 I'm a real motherfucker, check my bar code 
 In the strip club, prolly at the blue fline 
 Scratches on the whip, a Mini coup 
 Okay I stepped up from the scene super clean 
 Got a 50 in my jeans, screamin' money ain't a thing 
 A vilt full of bottles, got some models and some bitches 
 Man I'm just a young, checked up in the club ballin', stacks up 
 Okay I'm standing on the bar and all the girls starin' 
 And my chain costs a Ferrari and my wrist costs a McLaren 
 We'll be sayin' flex flex flex flex flex flex flex 
 She want a bottle that can packs and a man can do it 
 Man, I bought a half a pill then we ran straight through it 
 What we doin'? Flex flex flex flex flex flex flex 
 Okay all I know it flexes you 
 Some different check you more 
 Shorty can't hit the whip, I need a astro blow 
 Spare tier in the trunk, ride with an extra shot 
 Spend your red money at that Benihana restaurant 
 Gucci low, Polo, diamond dancing go go 
 Whole squad flexin' like army have my logo 
 Karate kickin', dojo 
 Paparazzi photo 
 Aggravated flexin',.. plain Nolo

 Dirt Gang protest

 Okay I'm standing on the bar and all the girls starin' 
 And my chain costs a Ferrari and my wrist costs a McLaren 
 We'll be sayin' flex flex flex flex flex flex flex 
 She want a bottle that can packs and a man can do it 
 Man, I bought a half a pill then we ran straight through it

 Came to the club, sevin chains, doin' too much 
 Ferrari Rary fay Waka Flocka flexed up 
 All dogs really spend it cool... 
 Two crowds for my haters, throw your gropes on 
 White Remy Martin but we buy by the case long 
 Smoke back to back in our Rollie and eyes closed 
 Paparazzi follow us everywhere we go 
 He know, she know, I'll be flexin' 
 All this Remy Martin, I might mix it with some Rosay 
 Heavy rotation on the radio you get no play 
 Ball ball ball ball ball ball go and get it 
 Dream about it all weekend 
 Flex!
