Pay for what, girl you better pay for this dick 
 She the type to fall for two zans in an outfit 
 I'm with the zans crew, so it's hunneds on the floor 
 My hoes is off in the mo, I be balling hoe 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them 
 These hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them 
 I don't like your kind, you a boogie hoe 
 All in my face like a groupie hoe 
 Can't do one girl need a group of hoe 
 She a fool when she on that pole 
 Break it down, drop it low 
 Clap that, do it slow 
 Ran out of ones I'm a order some mo 
 Shawty got good friends on her honor roll 
 And... with moves like that no, girl you a pro 
 Hundred bands in my pocket, just to let you know 
 I'm too turnt, everything's a go 
 What it's gonna be, what it's gonna cost 
 Everything's on me, my God believe 
 We're bricksquad monopoly 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them 
 These hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them 
 I stay flexin iced out with a bank roll 
 Drunk as fuck everything's slow mo 
 Black girls, white girls at my show 
 Even got latin girls in the front row 
 Throwin' throwin' throwing dough 
 Throwing dough, throwin' dough 
 Throwing dough, throwin' dough 
 Bitch I said throwing stacks 
 Flocka, her hair long and her ass fat 
 She screaming broke niggas that way 
 Where the ballers at, fuck her all night 
 And never call her back 
 Homerun the pussy every time I swing my bat 
 Squad, and if it's good I'm a double-back 
 Desperately I need some zans, where my da-da at 
 Squad, if it's good, I'm a double-back 
 Flocka, desperate needs for them zans, where my da-da at 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok 
 Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them 
 These hoes, we done run through them 
 Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them.
