 Luda! 
 Fresh out the shop and the candy coated Cadillac stacked on amazin' wheels 
 Seats look like I hollered at the Reeces peanut butter cup, and then made a deal 
 Trucks shakin' like jellied honey's ready to check the spread 
 'Cause I get that cheese, and I sandwich myself between the bread 
 So keep yo' mind on yo' riches, and get yo' hoes right 
 'Cause in these streets you not safe unless yo' codes right 
 Your southern living is like something you ain't never seen 
 Ask any hustler his favorite color is money green 
 Blacked out tint white wall spinnin' 
 Lookin' for the neckbone, hamhock, collard green, cornbread eatin' women
