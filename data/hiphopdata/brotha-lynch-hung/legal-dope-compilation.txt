Chorus (lynch and d-dubb) 4x 
 I re-fuse to lose 
 Fuck them 22's 
 I got an ap 10 and a throwaway tech 9 
 So you know you can't fuck with mine 
 (Lynch) 
 If I was standing in the dark letting my nine spark 
 (D-dub) 
 Maybe in the morning, motherfuckers might feel me yet 
 (Lynch) 
 It's that nine tech nigga that got them motherfuckers tore up 
 As I smash of in a seven deuce cut, you holding your gut 
 Talking about 
 (D-dub and lynch) 
 What the fuck you smoking on? 
 (Lynch) 
 All dome as the chronics got me gone 
 Nigga it's on 
 On till the slugs come out 
 (D-dub) 
 At night I do my murder red rum so tight 
 (Lynch) 
 I'ts the third strike nigga 
 So now I'm aiming up at your dome 
 'Bout to make your brain split and hit the fleetwood brome 
 I'm like richard chase, mixed with al capone 
 If you want some ripgut shit nigga 
 Yeah, I got it sewn 
 So bone to the crib, or get your wig split fool, with the tech chrome 
 And say the alphabet backwards fast or find you a brand new dome 
 A criminal minded nigga that gots tefs in his nine 
 So head to the east side, 'cause it's red rum time, nigga 
 Nigga, it's that-sac of indo-killafornia state of mind 
 Where niggas put their gangster gear on, and bend corners 
 In a chev 69 
 Wire rims 
 You can't see 
 With their neighborhood flags and their black carthart beenie 
 I'm like genie 
 As I swoop through the hood and get up to no good 
 And I wish you would 
 Test my tech, 'cause nigga, it loves to take out necks 
 And empty backs out, so I max out 
 350 on the black top 
 More smoke than chronic smoking 
 Loced out sherm, classic perm 
 In my ashtray, there's always a roach 
 Hit the left lane in case one times approach 
 I got, 5 warrants and some '89 tags 
 17 in the clip of my, auto mag 
 I'ts sad 
 I gotta watch my back, 'cause these niggas wanna throw me up in a black 
 Leather sack, and throw me over their back 
 But fuck that 
 Why you think I got extended clips 
 'Cause I'm so high, most of the time 
 I just can't miss, nigga
