 They call me Mr. Sicca-love-a-kiss 
 Quick to yell out "fucc a bitch!" 
 Thinkin' nigga quick stuck 'em 
 With the situation I tuck a fifth 
 Ready to straight up cut the skin off 
 I'm a little off, see they lame, brains hang out 
 Insane gang stranged out 
 I'm sicc of this, I'ma get venomous 
 (?Insinamous?), step fangs hang out 
 Insane in the brained out, no thang stangs ever came out 
 Split your liver, you better get your kids, I'll break the house 
 With samurais, turn the whole family into eggs and chowder 
 I'm so crazy 'bout her, I call her my switchbitch 
 Stick it up in you, taking out your insides 
 Put the rest in the ditch quick 
 I'ma eat like Hannibal, cannibal, wild vill shit 
 Having a nigga bust melodies, yelling like Johnny Gillshit 
 I'm a new addition to Strange, we about to kill shit 
 Yeah we all sicc in the brain, no major record deal shit 
 Yeah, we all carry the thangs, plastic and steel shit 
 Put it up in your veins and find it nigga, we will siccem!
