(Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 My peoples... My peoples 
 We must maintain G- Status 
 (Singing) 
 Thinking about living without you 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 Based on technicalities, Ill nature and our future. Fuck 
 Work with the mic, work with the mic 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 I put the pedal to the metal in that niggas rag top 
 After I left him in his back seat, chockin and hopin that his life won't end tonight 
 Had to take him for his fifty, cause it was so tight 
 Hit the corner in it, In a minute 
 I'm bout to decorate somebody mortuary wit bone dust 
 Fuck niggas I don't trust they venomous 
 I bend a muskrat nigga like you in half 
 Have you takin' short breaths inside a death blood bath 
 Pullin niggas apart like bammer weed, takin' 'em for their 3-fifty 
 Hit the corner of Watt and Whitney, that's where that green shit be 
 Fifty sack and I'm out with a bitch that I don't know 
 About to hit the momo back to lose a ho gain a ho 
 So who's to know bruise a ho up like me or not 
 Whether I'm livin' out my momma house or in the back of my whatchamacallit 
 Doin' thangs us niggas do 
 Get me another one of them faulty bitches pervin off the ole 8 brew 
 Then what you do, I smile in they face 
 Then leave they muthafuckin body in a casketcase 
 I'm a basketcase, everyday all day to the day I die 
 I'mma kill'em all up fill'em all up lick'em, wheel'em, deal'em 
 Dig'em a ditch then stick the bitch 
 (Singing) 
 Thinking about living without you 
 (Black Caesar Talking) 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off pound the clubs 
 Just like cars pound them cars, feel like I'm lost... 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off. Got a nigga on 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off pound the clubs 
 Just like cars pound them cars, feel like I'm lost... 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 My nigga... I'm off this muthafuckin O'E bottle on the throttle 
 Cause these little niggas is catchin up grabbin the tec and buck 
 Stab in the neck and struck body in the back of the truck 
 And strap the Midevil tape to the dead body, Maserati, John Gotti 
 Made nigga, Put you in duct tape and leave you sinkin in the river 
 Take my kindness for weakness if you want to 
 I lost my baby Nevin, can't tell you what a nigga do 
 (Singing chorus) 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 I got voices in my muthafuckin head 
 Choice to leave muthafuckas dead, puddle of red, sat on the bed 
 Put my muthafuckin strap down, put my hands on my face 
 Gotta beat this muthafuckin case 
 (Singing chorus) 
 (Black Caesar talking x6) 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off pound the clubs 
 Just like cars pound them cars, feel like I'm lost... 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off. Got a nigga on 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off pound the clubs 
 Just like cars pound them cars, feel like I'm lost... 
 Blackout blackout when the lights off
