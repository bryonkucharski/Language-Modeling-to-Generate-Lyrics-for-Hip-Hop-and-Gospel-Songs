I'm hot enough to make your skin bubble 
 Packin a Smith and Wesson 
 Uh oh, trouble, don't say nothin' 
 You can tell that I'm evil 
 By the arch in my eye bra 
 But I ain't got no pitchfork 
 I stick niggaz with this sawed-off 
 Clear your porch 
 Hit the floor, duck behind your couch 
 If I don't hear enough screamin 
 I'm burning down your house 
 Apocolypse the barbarian 
 I kill humanitarians 
 Pillage your village 
 Slaughter your children 
 And rape your women 
 Bustin' through that door like dun da dun da 
 Bitches hit the floor on the double 
 Bust off a couple 
 Rounds and let it bubble 
 In your belly 
 Bullets dipped in formaldehyde 
 So when they hit you 
 You embalmed and ready 
 To get carried 
 Buried up in your grave 
 Trust me, I'm that deadly 
 Just test me if you brave 
 Eklypse I stay sick 
 Eith Pit, Playboy, and Lynch 
 Kill a bitch nigga quick 
 And run a train on his bitch nigga 
 I wish these niggaz would try to rough me for the chips 
 I got metal muscle with silent tips 
 And pistol grips give violent trips 
 First I'm cool with you 
 Then I'm not 
 When you run up on me I pop pistols 
 Gun up on me it's all official 
 I'm chewin bone grissels 
 Your family gonna miss you 
 Do away done with you 
 You should of had a gun with you 
 I got pistols 
 You know cookin utensils 
 That shit that'll make your skin bubble 
 Fuckin' with these plague niggaz 
 You gotsta know you in trouble 
 Trouble (repeat 8 times) 
 I keeps it real that's the deal 
 Headbuttin motherfuckers like Evander Holyfield 
 I makes a full course dinner 
 Out of roadkill 
 Pops some pills 
 Smoke some sherms 
 Drunk as fuck 
 Rollin' up a blunt 
 When I get through smokin' it 
 I'm comin' to your house nigga 
 What's for breakfast 
 Kickin in your door 
 At 3:47 in the morning 
 Time to wake up, so I can do your bitch ass wrong 
 I got my ?? yawnin 
 Hear comes trouble 
 Hell's angel, some niggaz call me spawn 
 Shit I'm off that ??? again 
 Ready to load the pump again 
 Soon as I put somethin' in 
 See I'ma aim it at your chin 
 Blame it on your friend 
 Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man 
 I can make niggaz follow me like the pod piper can 
 Arachnaphobia, I'm the sniper man 
 Doom to put 'em in the pan 
 Heat 'em and eat 'em as fast as I can 
 Man I'm first, you last to land 
 Stretch your neck like elastic like plastic 
 Tephlon bullets they crash and land 
 Nigga I'm double time 
 You in trouble time 
 I'm a bubble mine 
 I'm titani and scandalous 
 I do random hits 
 Load up all my extra clips 
 And lets go handle this shit 
 Trouble is what we lookin' fo 
 Kick in that fuckin' door 
 Put a gag up on that hoe 
 Slit that niggaz throat 
 Light up the door 
 Smoke until we choke 
 I wish you motherfuckers would try to locc 
 And get his neck broke 
 Kick in the door 
 Shotgun up the asshole 
 Brains blown 
 Eyes closed 
 Nothin' but trouble 
 [Chorus] - repeat to end
