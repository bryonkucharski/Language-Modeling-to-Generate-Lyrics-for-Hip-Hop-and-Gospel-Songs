(Talking) 
 Yeah, straight from the muthafuckin duece 
 It's the brotha lynch hung once again, ya know what I'm sayin' 
 And all I see is muthafuckin devils and gunsmoke, ya know 
 But I ain't gon' trip, I'm just gon kick some shit for y'all muthafuckas 
 So peep this out 
 Niggas better always know 
 For y'all so-called devils and gunsmoke 
 Walkin' through the duece 
 Ya got, better eat, no joke 
 Livin' life like a muthafuckin criminal 
 Watchin my back from gettin' jacked by the 5-0 
 One-time peepin a nigga out 
 A couple a dank sacks in my dickies 
 Ol' English in my mouth 
 Ya know, and if it wasn't for my muthafuckin skin tone 
 I wouldn't even trip, just strike my black ass home 
 Even if I had a chrome 
 I bust two caps and head home 
 Hopin to hit fools right in the dome 
 'Cause all I see is devils and gunsmoke 
 Pussy and hoes, and hella blood when my nine blows 
 A young nigga on the rage, rampage 
 Twenty-four years of age with a 40 and a 12-gauge 
 And then a muthafucka change 
 Baby killin' ass nigga and ain't a damn thang strange 
 A muthafucka sold juice, bulletproof 
 Known to eat a pussy and put a gun inside of it and shoot 
 A nigga wit' a mind so bad 
 Close my eyes, and all I see is little bloody babies in a glad bag 
 Nigga, manson ain't shit 
 I got niggas killin' mamas and niggas on the devils dick 
 But now it all adds up the this, locc 
 Niggas hatin' God and all I see is devils and gunsmoke 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah, you know what my drunk ass father told me 
 He said 'look little nigga, you have to run your own muthafuckin life' 
 And I was trippin', 'cause this muthafucka had a gun to my muthafuckin head 
 It was about 12 o' clock, somethin' don't smell right 
 I'm in the hall in the middle of the night 
 Somethin' reekin like sweat, drippin off a burnt up pig 
 Muthafuckas in the crib, crept through the hall like a thief 
 Fiends a fiends, and cocaine smoke nigga no-name 
 Folks run in the crib, you know the situations tore up 
 My homies sellin dope to my folks but you know what 
 I don't give a fuck no more 'cause I'ma blow up 
 Usin' all the fury inside to make some more cuts 
 'Cause all I see is what? 
 Black muthafuckas walkin' 'round tryna' found out what's what 
 Smoke up, but all I see is threats 
 Swear if I see anotha muthafucka I don't know 
 In my crib, I'ma shoot him in the neck 
 Pimp respect for a muthafuckin vet 
 Causin anotha nigga death 
 Do a little time for a slut 
 Shoot before I get shot, playin' fools like a half deck 
 'Cause all I see is devils and gunsmoke 
 I say that 'cause I don't wanna claim and end up like x-raided 
 You know I gotta eat if I eat ya, see if I see ya 
 Shoot up, then I'm on my way 
 'Cause my mama used to say, it ain't a hoax 
 Because niggas are hatin' God and all I see is devils and gunsmoke
