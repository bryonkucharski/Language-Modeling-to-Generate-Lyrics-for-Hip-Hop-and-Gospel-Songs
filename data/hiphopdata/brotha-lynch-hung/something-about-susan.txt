I told you, hated the way you always used to leave me 
 I saw you at the club with that motherfucker Ci-Ci 
 I pulled up, you was in the front of the club 
 I saw another nigga huggin you you know I was trippin' 
 I had to dip in, order me a dirty martini and best believe me 
 I really didn't want a bitch to see me 
 So I put on the spydie's took out my I.D. and 
 I have to keep the knife right behind me till ya by me 
 I was in the bathroom shakin the dick off when he came in 
 I wanted to pull out the N9ne milli and bash his brains in 
 Grr, you know how Brotha Lynch will do it 
 Walk up on a nigga with 2 blades and give a nigga 2 slits 
 Na, my main goal was the same ho 
 She used to let me put the Ruger up in the anal 
 I taught her all that shit now the next nigga benefactin 
 Irv take me to the hook I need an intermission 
 I swear I love her, I never let her out of my sights 
 There's no more livin' if I ever let her out of my life 
 'Cause when she's not 'round it's just not right 
 You are my heart, I give you my all 
 Somethin' bout Susan she keep my bed warm 
 I go to sleep with her then I wake up in the morn 
 Then she right by me side then we hope in the ride 
 With a bottle in my hand, that's how we drink and drive 
 85 on a 35, straight pushin 
 There's somethin' bout Susan keep haters just lookin' 
 When the sun goes down, we dress up in all black 
 Matchin' outfits, she been down since way back 
 Back when I used to cook crack at the house 
 And even though she set ya boy in a cell a couple times that's my spouse 
 And I love her but I hate her, when she spit at other niggas 
 Put me in situations where she get at other niggas 
 Now she got the police askin questions lookin' for her 
 I'm bout to wrap her up and leave he on the river floor 
 I'm bout drill this chick (?) and so much water like a more (?) 
 This my love train all aboard, till death do us 
 3 in the morning I can't sleep I'm having bad dreams 
 I keep seeing bad shit, this was a bad week 
 I had bad month, shit... I had a bad year 
 I had a bad life even before she came here 
 I used to tell them I was married to the music 
 And I never should've changed that 
 I Gotta get my strange back! 
 I used to write every morning and smoke hella weed 
 I used to be on the road, used to make hella cheese 
 And now I'm struggling broke 
 And you could tell I'm heated 
 Bringing bullshit in my life 
 And I don't really need it 
 I think I'm smoking too much 
 It's like suicide 
 I won't eat, won't shower 
 Between you and I 
 My trust is all fucked up 
 I'm ready to give the fuck up! 
 I'm ready to murder everything! 
 My life is all sucked up! 
 I'm tired of all this shit! 
 And now the next nigga benefitted 
 Irv, take me to the hook 
 I need an intermission
