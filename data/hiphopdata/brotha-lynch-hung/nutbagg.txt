[Chorus 1] Repeat 
 I don't give a fuck about what you think 
 I don't give a fuck about what you feel 
 Drop that album I'ma too feel 
 Crack that yak bitch pop that pill 
 I rock that still, sit in a cage 
 I got a f type of crap, pop that steel 
 I pop that feel 
 Y'all motherfuckers is not that real 
 I'm a nutbagg 
 [Chorus 2 (plays over chorus 1) 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, ever chill with me and 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, I'm still just me 
 I'ma gutbag 'em up, toe tag em 
 Kick like into the drag and don't act em 
 Knife meat; put rat poison up in my I.V. 
 Try me, to crack niggas back to the crime scene 
 I'm a crime scene maker life taker, 
 Take 'em on a stage and rape em 
 No apron, I'ma scrape his face and face Satan 
 I'ma take his place and get a Jason 
 Mask, better be ready to duck fast, 
 Never be ready to face me I cut grass 
 Leave 'em dead I put three in the head 
 Then I feed him the dead and foresee to cut stab 
 I don't need to flip it I spit sick, got syphalistic 
 Your bitch get lit, I'm telling you this 
 It's the sickness shit, I'm smelling you this shit 
 You get twisted (grrr) 
 I'm in the rage, I didn't get paid 
 Now my life's stuck in the cage 
 I stayed with the same block in the gage 
 My heart's burning and I'm turning the page 
 Anybody that face me I get 'em flayed 
 Layed in the shade with a bag of 'nades 
 I spit sicker than a bag of aids 
 'Bout to blow back up, so I have grenades (boom!) 
 Get sick'd of this, get a butcher knife 
 Slit your bitch's wrists, now you took a life 
 And a 56 and a hooker like 
 Yo bitch is with me, tell her goodnight 
 I'm 51, 51, 50 
 Don't get the hong, lick 
 You gon' get licked, don't sit too rich 
 Lynch is gon' get it 
 Don't get with this quick 
 I spit liquid 
 [Chorus 1] Repeat 
 I don't give a fuck about what you think 
 I don't give a fuck about what you feel 
 Drop that album I'ma too feel 
 Crack that yak bitch pop that pill 
 I rock that still, sit in a cage 
 I got a f type of crap, pop that steel 
 I pop that feel 
 Y'all motherfuckers is not that real 
 I'm a nutbagg 
 (Chorus 2 (plays over chorus 1)) 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, ever chill with me and 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, I'm still just me 
 I'ma put average niggas up in the attic 
 Take they bitches and stab 'em up in the abdomen 
 Leaving bodies on medicine after new I'm havin' you 
 For dinner and a movie after I stab at you 
 You got bit of the sickness, nigga haven't you 
 It's like cocaine so I don't got an attitude 
 Badabim, badabum I'm in your room 
 And all I wanna do is sing another tune 
 Ring another tool, bring another hookie 
 Cut up, what up, shit nut up, with us 
 Get fucked up with us and don't fuck with us 
 Get cut up the butt, quick shut up your butt slit 
 Razorblades, today's the day, cause you paved the way 
 For two day to get ate up 
 Shave his legs, and two pays get blazed up 
 Eat his brains and put flames in they guts 
 Emriel Lagassi, your posse 
 You don't see what I see you're not me 
 With this shit I'ma get my monoply 
 Not even a freight train can stop me 
 Not even a straight cane could rock me 
 Use weed to maintain a top speed 
 Low down, slow down with the fo' pound, no now, you go now (you go now! grr!) 
 I'm in the rage, I didn't get paid 
 Now my life's stuck in the cage 
 I stayed with the same block in the gage 
 My light's burning and I'm turning the page 
 Anybody that face me I get 'em flayed 
 Layed in the shade with a bag of 'nades 
 I get sicker than a bag of aids 
 'Bout to blow back up, so I have grenades 
 [Chorus 1] Repeat 
 I don't give a fuck about what you think 
 I don't give a fuck about what you feel 
 Drop that album I'ma too feel 
 Crack that yak bitch pop that pill 
 I rock that still, sit in a cage 
 I got a f type of crap, pop that steel 
 I pop that feel 
 Y'all motherfuckers is not that real

 (Chorus 2 (plays over chorus 1)) 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, ever chill with me and 
 I don't give a fuck about how you feel 
 About me, I kill for free, I'm still just me
