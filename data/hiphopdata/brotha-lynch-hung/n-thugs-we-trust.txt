 Talk about your girl pop off, where the fuck you be at 
 I see MJ in the hood more than Curtis 
 Matter of fact, this beef shit is making niggaz nervous 
 It's gonna be families grieving every Sunday service 
 End up with your head popped off thanks to Curtis 
 But he don't care, he's still locked up in his house and shit 
 Steroid up and he won't come about that bitch 
 Is it me or does candy shop sound like magic stick? 
 In the video, this nigga fifty bout to strip 
 Shaking his ass, what the fuck is wrong with this nigga 
 Fifty don't make me 
 Oh yeah, you got sixty-five niggaz on your team 
 And they're not from Southside Jamaica, Queens

 Now let's take it back to Vibe awards 
 Where that nigga disrespect and then snuffed your balls 
 A minute ago, all I heard was G-G-G-G-Unit 
 Fifty niggaz ran and they didn't even do shit 
 That's a shame, I was sitting right in the front 
 Waiting for you niggaz to dunk 
 Where are all your guns and them teflon vests? 
 We them terror squad boys 
 You should know not to test us 
 Hate it or love it, The Game's on top 
 Now you jealous of him, when your shit going to stop? 
 You've seen me before 
 Yous a bitch nigga straight out of low cash 
 And they don't believe him, this nigga is so ass 
 You dissed lean back, said my shit was a dud 
 Now tell me, have you ever seen 'em up in the club? 
 No, no, no shawty 
 That's right, you see them more than you rappin' 
 Now Fifty that ain't right
