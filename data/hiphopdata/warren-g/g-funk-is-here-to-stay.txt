Definitely On The G Funk Vibe 
 This rap shit got my own cactuses 
 Like we never slept on the same mattresses 
 Young age football practices 
 Biscuit shine, Five of the ones on the waistline 
 I ain't worried about no platinum change 
 I'll give ya a 59 with a batman ass go range 
 (Mumbled speech) 
 Ok, musta being the zodiac 
 V.I.P I really don't let this shit get to me 
 I just flip tracks, spit facts 
 Get relaxed, with G Funk laxed in the back 
 We stay in the ghetto, havin' a tap with rugrats 
 Cats, and taps, with flaps 
 Foul language, old English it's dangerous 
 It stays the same and never changes 
 (Crumbling cries) 
 G Funk is here to stay 
 I pop a cap 
 Domino's and spades 
 With a bag of gange and smoke it all day 
 There's a staircase, it's a true 21 
 Here's a toast to the thugs 
 High drop 4 sheezy, drinkin' ma bud 
 I still love n-a-t-e 
 Rollin' from the sheezys 
 With a dress code like dubsy and a circle arse 
 G-Funk is here to stay
