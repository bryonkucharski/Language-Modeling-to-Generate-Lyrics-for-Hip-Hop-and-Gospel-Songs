(Feat. Snoop Dogg, Phats Bossi and Reel Tight) 
 (Snoop) 
 Got a little something for the summertime 
 While you on the grind 
 Getting yours 
 Hell yeah! I'm getting mine 
 I take trips and dips just to recline 
 I blaze up the orange weed 
 To relax my mind 
 Spend time with my kids on the weekdays 
 And I holla at my momma and my 
 Grandma on the threeway 
 She say, If you do right 
 Baby boy I promise you live 
 A long life 
 I can't argue 
 I try hard to 
 Not blast niggas 
 I walk past niggas 
 With my head up to the skedai (sky) 
 Nigga tried to pull a fast one 
 On Snoop Dogg 
 To get some shut eye 
 What I do to him I can't speak 
 You know the episode 
 And the code on the street 
 I keep it all the scriffin' y'all 
 But real street for y'all 
 Cause you never know 
 When you're gonna go, no 
 You never know where this road's gonna take you 
 Got to be strong 
 You got to hold on 
 Cause you never know, where 
 This life's gonna lead you 
 Just Hold on 
 You never know 
 (Warren G) 
 >From the killing 
 The robbing 
 The squabbing 
 And jacking 
 Car jacks to kidnaps 
 What? Niggas be acting a fool 
 Trying to set me up at the park 
 But I'm cool 
 Act a fool 
 My daddy said throw them thangs 
 And stay strong 
 My momma got sick 
 So I'ma keep it strong 
 As long as I got my feet in the game 
 And make this beats 
 And bring heat to the game 
 Fuck the fame 
 I got a little boy to see through 
 And him without me 
 Is like me without you 
 Keep it true 
 And stay down for your grips 
 Homies and licks staying tight 
 Like this 
 You never know 
 (Phats Bossi) 
 You niggas never know 
 Which man are blasted for 
 Never know which man to kill 
 Just to settle the score 
 It wasn't long ago 
 I had this partner of mine 
 Knew him just a short time 
 But he's stuck in my mind 
 My nigga lived perfect 
 Said the streets wasn't worth it 
 If you don't die rich in the game 
 Then what's the purpose for this struggle? 
 We stay piece to puzzle 
 Invest half the wealth 
 And pray to god it double 
 We just in this 
 Trying to get rich at the interest 
 Keep it pimping 
 Stay with niggas that's relentless 
 Smoke dough 
 Just because I say so 
 Money pronto 
 And niggas never would know 
 They never know nigga 
 (Chorus till fades)
