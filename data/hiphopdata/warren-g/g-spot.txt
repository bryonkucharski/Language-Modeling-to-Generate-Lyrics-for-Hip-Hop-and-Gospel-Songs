(Feat. El Debarge and Val Young) 
 (Warren G) 
 I'm the illest, what? 
 I'm the illest, Warren G, uh yeah 
 I'm the illest, the illest you've ever seen 
 Haha check this shit out do' 
 Peep game, look, hmm 
 She used to tell me that she loved me all the time 
 I turned to her, and say that I'm 
 Infatuated, concentrated on cuttin' it up 
 Body bustin' out your blouse, don't button it up 
 Me and you could make a getaway, up in the cut 
 I'm just a squirrel in your world, bustin' a nut 
 Slide in the passenger side and creep to the tilt 
 And maybe you could get a chance to sleep on my silk 
 Because you come with, that A-1 shit 
 The kind I wouldn't mind havin' a 20-year run with 
 I'm done with these games, played by these dames 
 I could exit the drama the same way that I came 
 'Cause I gotta put it down for my sons 
 So you, skanless scuds gets none of my funds 
 'Cause I can't be in love with my pockets on fee 
 Get the money, the power and the rest come for free, you know 
 Chorus: El DeBarge, (Val Young) 
 I let you hang (I let you hang around) 
 So you could see (so that you, could see) 
 You tried to switch (Understand, tryin' to switch) 
 The fool out of me (and make a fool, of me) 
 I meant (So I guess I'll have to let you be) 
 Baby (Baby baby baby baby you know) 
 *Repeat* 
 (Warren G) 
 Now baby, look at the time 
 We gotta do what we gotta do 
 The club's about to close, don't you wanna ride 
 In a Rolls, Royce? Make it real moist 
 Take the Rolls to the jet, take the jet to my yacht 
 Letcha kick it for a week in my Caribbean spot 
 Coconut milk bath (bath), private beach, first class (class) 
 Water clear like glass (glass), waves ticklin your ass 
 Cut the act baby, you need a change of pace 
 I deliver you a whole new world of taste 
 Guaranteed to put a different timid look on your face 
 Put the arch in your back when I'm grippin your waist 
 Warren G keep flippin the bass on key 
 'Cause you rollin' with a G when you're rollin' with me 
 Easily I spit game to make it hot 
 Headed straight for the motherfuckin G-Spot, you know 
 (Warren G talking) 
 See now look at the picture 
 You got a lotta women out there preaching about 
 How they ain't a bitch or a ho but now 
 If you carry yourself in a fashionable matter 
 Game can be matched both ways by a player 
 Not a player hater, please believe it 
 It's told not to be sold by me 
 You know what, it ain't my fault 
 *Val Young crooning* 
 I let you, hang around, so that you, can see 
 *Warren G and Eve phone conversation*
