It's that nigga Gz WheeZ 
 Back for the 9-c 
 I ex sippin on the yak so people wanna know what's next 
 Ain't nothin' changed, another day a new time 
 With this uptempo beat with the G-Funk rhyme 
 Regulatin state to state, coast to coast 
 It's all about the call of greens, yak, lets toast 
 'Cause it's a ballin society 
 I try to be the dopest I can be in this industry 
 But you don't hear me 
 I think ya betta, I think ya betta 
 'Cause when I, get it goin' on I ain't gonna let up 
 I set up, the g-funk family and we 
 Funkin up the industry until eternity 
 Its all right with you if its all right with me, 
 We'll get down to the sounds of the LBC 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 Relax your mind, your mind, your mind 
 Relax your mind and let your conscious be freein you down 
 To the sounds of the Warren G 
 It ain't easy bein Gz 
 But the lifestyle I chose, the status to which I rose 
 The doors, I open, I'm loccin, I'm scopin 
 Through the eyes of the G Child 
 I see many try to duplicate the LBC style 
 But it ain't even happenin' like that 
 I was time I had to make a comeback 
 And get mine, you know I'm genuine 
 Been in motion with the potion with Snoop since 89 
 Devotion is the key for me so, 
 Relax your mind and let your conscious be free 
 The homey just touched down, foolin wit a pound 
 Put yo gun down, so you can walk a safe ground 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 I know it's been hard on you for about two, so 
 I had to relax your mind, I thought you knew 
 Ain't nothin' but a Long Beach party 
 With yo hands in the air, with the twist of Coke and Bacardi 
 All the homeys around and the slingshot t-shirts 
 Skirts wit the baby fat it'll work 
 Pass me the indosmoke and get locced 
 From the beach to the bay, makin' them sway 
 Like the ocean in motion, we coastin 
 Relax your mind and keep floatin (floatin, floatin, floatin) 
 And walk a safe ground 
 Chorus: repeat 6X
