 Now as my pen, begin to let loose again 
 The bullets like duck, duck, goose, stuck 
 In the middle of a frame, buck, wit a little bit a game, stuck 
 And it's a muthafuckin shame 
 But I'm still here to maintain and run thangs 
 As the day gets clearer, I'm lookin' in my rear view mirror 
 And I hear a, nigga that I used be down with 
 A nigga that I used to clown with 
 And get around with, fuck the pound shit 
 They don't make niggaz like they used to 
 I remember Marley in the Juice Crew 
 That's why I stay down with LBC days 
 It ain't easy 
 Okay party people to the people the people the people people the people and the 
 Playaz 
 Chorus: repeat 3X
