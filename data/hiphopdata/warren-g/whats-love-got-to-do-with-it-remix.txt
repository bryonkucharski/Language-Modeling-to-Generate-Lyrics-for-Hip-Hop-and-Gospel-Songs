One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 When G dog the hog come up in the place 
 There's dollar signs in your eyez 
 And a smile in your face 
 You wanna live phat off of my sack 
 You got more drag than a low lo tho, cut the act 
 Cause back before '92 and '93 
 You didn't give a damn about Warren G 
 But now that I'm slangin' platinum LP's 
 All of a sudden you want my N.U.Ts 
 Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop 
 Cause money makes the world go 'round 
 And the panties drop 
 I ain't in love though (I ain't in love tho) 
 I don't need the pressure 
 I just wanna do ya 
 Like I'm diggin' for treasure 
 Some of y'all had a good thing, that you couldn't keep 
 Thought you was TLC, You had to creep (You had to creep) 
 You say you had love 
 I say you need to quit it 
 It's all about the dough 
 So what's Warren got to do with it 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 Now I'm the type of brother that's down for mines 
 Before I made beats, I was down to crime 
 Back then every single homie had my back 
 Now they're peepin' my stack 
 And they're talking 'bout jack 
 But I'm the same brotha 
 Day in and day out 
 And I'ma stay that way 
 Until the day I lay out 
 In a casket, its drastic 
 Cause homies is plastic 
 Brake 'em off some bread 
 They want the whole damn basket 
 If you's a true homie 
 You would wish me well 
 Not plot to make a homey fell 
 Jealous as hell 
 We used to get the same riches 
 Now your trigger finger got the itches 
 Schemin' on my bitches 
 Which is not a surprise 
 My eyes peep game 
 211's 187's It's all the same 
 It's all a shame 
 Homies are jackin' you for your grip 
 Ain't no love involved 
 Because it's all about the chips 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 Now for these labels tellin' fables 
 Makin' them fucked up deals under the tables 
 You think that you're smart 
 But fool I'm the smartest 
 You can't make no money 
 If you can't keep an artist 
 Sign the dotted line 
 Put me on the shelf 
 Break me off some crumbs 
 Keep the rest for yourself 
 I know how it goes 
 Treat Warren like a hoe 
 Fly cars, Gold, clothes, but no dough 
 Since it's all business, I'ma handle mine 
 Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime 
 Cause in this rap game 
 It's all about the buck 
 You bend over for tha label 
 And you will get bucked 
 Like how you run up in a skirt 
 And then your through 
 The record label do the same thang to you 
 90% business, 10% show 
 Ain't no love in this game 
 'Cause it's all about the dough 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one love 
 One love, what's love, you're lucky just to have just one
