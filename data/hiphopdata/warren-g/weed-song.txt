(Feat. Frank Lee White The Greatest) 
 Frank Lee White: 
 We just, tryin'a find a place where 
 We can smoke our, weeeeed 
 Warren G: 
 With' out nobody fuckin' with' us at all 
 Walk with' me now

 We can do our, thiiiiing 
 Warren G: 
 With' out nobody fuckin' with' us at all

 (Verse 1: Warren G) 
 Well it's Frank, the bank, roll a tank 
 Roll the white, dolomite, takin' over the mic' 
 I like, what I'm feelin' here 
 See me man, standin' here, puffin' on that hemisphere 
 Come a little closer girl, I think I see a blemish there 
 Anyway, let's get back to the program 
 Get a strawberry Swisher, let's smoke man 
 Long as I'm with'chu, we gon' be up in the clouds 
 High as a kite, and I ain't comin' down 
 (Down South) We be on them peach White Owl's 
 Frank Lee White, bout to smoke another ounce 
 I heard in Cali, they got that purp 
 Tryin'a figure out a way to cop that work 
 So, bless me 
 With another blunt of 'Droooooooo 
 My chest feel like the shit about to blow 
 The whole world's spinnin' 
 Gimme a couple zones, and room full of women 
 And I'm straight
