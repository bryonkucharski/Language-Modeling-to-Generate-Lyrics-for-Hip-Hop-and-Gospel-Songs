You're back now at the jack-off hour 
 This is DJ, Eazy Dick 
 On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new 
 By Snoop Doggy Dogg 
 And this one goes out to the ladies 
 From all the guys 
 A big bow wow wow 
 'Cause we gonna make it a little mystery here tonight 
 This is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that 
 Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick 
 When I met you last night baby 
 Before you opened up your gap 
 I had a respect for ya lady 
 But now I take it all back 
 'Cause you gave me all your pussy 
 And ya even licked my balls 
 Leave your number on the cabinet 
 And I promise baby, I'll give you a call 
 Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny 
 You come on over, and I'll break you off 
 And if you can't fuck that day, baby 
 Just lay back and open your mouth 
 'Cause I have never met a girl 
 That I love in the whole wide world 
 Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke 
 I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke 
 I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't do me 
 Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie? 
 I have no love for hoes that's somethin' that I learned in the pound 
 So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe 
 Just to lay this hoe I know the pussy's mines 
 I'ma fuck a couple more times 
 And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it 
 Pass it to the homie, now you hit it 
 'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me 
 And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me 
 I gives a fuck 
 Why don't y'all pay attention 
 Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt 
 Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 Guess who is back in the motherfuckin' house 
 With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth 
 Hoes recognize, niggaz do too 
 'Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo 
 What you gon' do? You really don't know 
 So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe 
 Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch 
 Knowin' damn well, once you're caught up with my grip 
 Now as the sun rotates 
 And my game grows bigger 
 How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga 
 Named Snoop Doggy, I'm all the above 
 I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes 
 But see, it ain't no fun 
 If my homies can't get a taste of it 
 'Cause you know I don't love 'em 
 Whoa, hey, now ya know 
 Inhale, exhale with my flow 
 One for the money, two for the bitches 
 Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches 
 In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact 
 With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back 
 So back up bitch 'cause I'm strugglin' 
 So get off your knees and then start jugglin' 
 These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth 
 It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none 
 It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
