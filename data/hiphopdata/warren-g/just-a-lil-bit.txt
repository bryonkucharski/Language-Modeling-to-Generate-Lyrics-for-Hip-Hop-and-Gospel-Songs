 Joe Flizzow: 
 Hip-hop be connecting 
 Kuala Lumpur with LB 
 Hip-hop be rocking up towns 
 Laced with LV 
 Ain't necessary to roll 
 In nice rimmed M3's 
 And be blinging 
 Hip-hop be bringing together emcees 
 Y'all asking who that kid 
 With a flow that's sick 
 It's Flizzow 
 And who's Malique 
 On this Qumran tip 
 Now follow 
 We Too Phat 
 Hip-hop be running through our veins 
 It gets us up in the morning 
 Hip-hop keeps me sane 
 Wherever you rapping 
 It's embraced across the globe 
 It's truly amazing 
 How it gives people hope 
 That beat is dope 
 Y'all holla at the DJ 
 Hip-hop is staying up at night 
 To bid for kicks on e-bay 
 This should be off the hizee 
 Going make you move for shizze 
 Blow up spots 
 Getting crunk with Warren G'zee 
 Now best believe 
 KL got the world tuned in 
 Joe Flizzow with my elements 
 So let the party begin...

 Assalamualaikum

 Without a west coast rhyme to step to 
 You know how it go 
 When it's real hip-hop 
 Kuala Lumpur don't stop 
 Long Beach won't stop on top 
 Keep them blocks so hot 
 From Malaysia 
 Back to my spot 
 Islamic in the form of Tupac 
 I ride so deep 
 With Joe and Malique 
 We go together 
 Like a flow and a beat 
 And don't try to compete 
 With the Long Beach original 
 Back on the gizzo 
 (Just a little bit)

 Malique: 
 Wassalam Warren 
 We thank you for the bit 
 Now the three of us together 
 Regulating this hit 
 We banging this hit 
 And making lil ends on the side 
 Another classic joint now 
 It's time to ride 
 And spread love 
 Across this loony circle 
 Ride from boogie down to Bangalore 
 It's universal 
 Whether blue or purple 
 Black or white 
 Light brown 
 It's not about skin 
 But B-boy battles 
 Who outtwirls and outspins 
 Screaming (Go B-boy!) 
 While B-boys gets busy 
 In hip-hop ¡°whuttup's¡± hello 
 And for sure is for shizee 
 Doo rags and corn rows 
 And kids with pants sagging 
 Shaking aerosol cans 
 While bombing and tagging 
 While DJ's is crabbing 
 Scratching breaking styluses 
 Hooking beats and moving 
 More heads than hairstylists 
 Somebody better tell me 
 Where them bootleggers and pirates is 
 Should rush ¡®em all wit viruses 
 Or put ¡®em where Osiris is 
 I hear no promises 
 So till then 
 Y'all see me bawling 
 I'll keep y'all head bopping 
 And stay yes yes y'all'in 
 God bless 
 The four elements story is told 
 And here's a little bit of hip-hop 
 For your soul 
 It's kinda easy 
 When you listen to the G'd up sound 
 A little bit of hip-hop 
 Will make the world go round 
 We got the sound for the rest 
 And it's easy to see
