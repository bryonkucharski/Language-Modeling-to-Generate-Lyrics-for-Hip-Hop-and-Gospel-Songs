Ronald Isley 
 If you wanna be with me, yeah, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G 
 If you wanna be with me, well well well, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G 
 Warren G 
 Smokin' me out to the finish, I thought you knew 
 I thought they knew, who was up in this 
 Ron Isley, I's be Warren G 
 Baby said would ya please come roll deep 
 Chocolate Thai, I said I 
 Got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly 
 Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips 
 On the 710 freeway, I straight dips 
 Wit a fat one rolled up to puff 
 I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough 
 Tokin nothing but the bomb that's without no doubt 
 As she twist up another split she's straight smokin' me out 
 Ronald Isley 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 Warren G 
 I slinkin while I'm thinkin' just how good it is 
 To do it how we do it in the hood I live 
 Passin homies on the block, gettin' major respect 
 And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect 
 Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right 
 Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice 
 With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries 
 I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs 
 She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back 
 To twist another zag and to grab a six pack 
 She went back, so we proceed to parlay 
 Everything is lovely and we doin' it always 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 This ain't no love ballad 
 But see baby I gots to have it 
 When I see that bomb I grab it, 'cause it's a habit 
 So don't come with that toe down stretch 
 I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin' me out, she learned a lesson 
 Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low 
 Bumpin time is collected, Sunday nights on the radio 
 Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat 
 Dog said she need 
 So conversation ain't needed 
 When she know that I'm weeded 
 Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it 
 I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke 
 I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love 
 She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Smokin' me out, smokin' me out 
 Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
