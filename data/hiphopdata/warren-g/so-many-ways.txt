Hey, nah ya goin' miss up on the G-Funk era, 
 Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar 
 (Warren G) 
 11-10-7 D that was my intro 
 But now in 94, I'm rollin' a 64 
 'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener 
 Niggaz throwin' up sets in hoods like they neva seen a 
 Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right 
 I got 44 ways to make you act right 
 And it's a shame how the game must be played 
 It was told never fold by the niggaz you can't fade 
 So raise up off this young hog 
 'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all 
 I got my own thang 'cause I let my nuts hang 
 If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain 
 So as I creep can you peep what I speak 
 Techniques unique, so what you sayin' is obsolete 
 So there it is as I go about my days 
 I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways 
 Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know 
 And I was in Baghdad 
 Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag 
 Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em 
 (Wayniac) 
 It's all plain and simple 
 I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggaz 
 Idiotic fools can't figure 
 The way I display or should I say more than that 
 Its crucial when I name how many niggaz got my back 
 Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine 
 You can't front if you wanna but you still know the time 
 I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean) 
 I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team 
 So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll 
 This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before 
 So recognize game in your face 
 A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace 
 (Warren G) 
 I stay true to the game 
 But some stay blind to the fact 
 That if I don't look good, you don't look good 
 So please rearrange and change the shit you doin' 
 You fuckin' yourself 'cause you the one gettin' screwed 
 As I, ease on down the rick road 
 As I shift from first to second, cruise control 
 So blaze up the buddha 
 'Cause I got drink, and don't think 
 We don't roll without a full tank 
 Of that bomb ass shit called the funk 
 'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want 
 Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town 
 Niggaz flip flop and they neva stay down 
 Wanna be all they can be, but gettin' held back 
 Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that? 
 So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay 
 I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways
