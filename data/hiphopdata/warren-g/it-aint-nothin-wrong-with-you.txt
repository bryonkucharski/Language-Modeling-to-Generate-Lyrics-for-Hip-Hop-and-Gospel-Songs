(Chorus: Warren G - repeat 4X) 
 It ain't nuttin wrong with you 
 Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty) 
 (Warren G) 
 I once knew a girl named LaShonda 
 Short little cute thing 
 With a pinky diamond ring 
 She was iceless 
 My game was so priceless 
 Givin' her a facial 
 I was G'd up 
 From the feed up 
 Pushin the bent 
 With the midnight tint 
 Huh, heaven sent 
 (Mista Grimm) 
 I once met a girl in the valley and 
 Half black half Italian 
 Ass like a stalian 
 Coke bottles shake 
 As she likes to watch herself on tape 
 Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more 
 She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel 
 Pranksta with a pearl 
 Held my balls so long 
 I call trouble when I'm with my girl 
 (Warren G) 
 There's a law for that 
 We ain't trippin', we hogs for that 
 Uh 
 (Chorus: Warren G and LaToiya - repeat 4X) 
 It ain't nuttin wrong with you 
 Me and you 
 (We do it nasty, nasty) 
 (Damone) 
 I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie 
 She was as bad as Carmen 
 Chillin' in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem 
 Straight dime 
 Body bangin' like a baseline 
 And the face fine 
 I had to spit dip waste time 
 Mr. Passionate 
 Everything her body was immaculin 
 The presence like a gift to men and got packaged 
 (Boss Hogg) 
 Fuckin' fabolous 
 She say "damn he fat" 
 Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that) 
 Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it 
 Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin' roll, goddamn it 
 Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash 
 To lick me baby and I might lick you back 
 (Damone) 
 Lickin' you back 
 She's gaggin with a dick in her trap 
 And stickin is fat 
 I'll pull it out and tickle your cat 
 (Previous Chorus) 
 (Warren G) 
 I put the smash on her like Shaq 
 She want the cash on her 
 I ain't havin' that 
 You need to check yo' trap 
 I got rose cap 
 G'd up, 213, please believe that 
 (Mista Grimm) 
 I stay pimpin' in a bubble I Benz 
 With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends 
 I slide up on 'em like a cross fader 
 The hook up later 
 And serve this dick like a waitor 
 I ain't tryna date her 
 (Damone) 
 When it comes to bitches 
 I got more game than the olympics 
 I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology 
 For no reason I'm receivin apologies 
 Break her down mentally 
 Have her stockin and follow me 
 (Boss Hogg) 
 Trick be swallowin me 
 For a nine on the vein 
 'Cause I'm the fuckin' boss, she's my employee 
 I ain't hatin', I appreciate you freaky ass style 
 Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile 
 (Previous Chorus - 2X)
