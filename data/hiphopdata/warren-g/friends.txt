Do you know where you goin' to? 
 Do you like the things Warren G has showed you, you 
 Do you know where you goin' to? 
 Do you like the things Warren G has showed you, you 
 G and Snoop, homeys from the jump and the get go 
 Devoted and quoted back in '84 
 Growin' up in the LBC 
 Platinum City, where the big gamers be 
 Involved in everythang from Pop Warner 
 To what's poppin' on every corner 
 Find a skirt if you wanna 
 Tryin' to come up in this world 
 Where everything is drama 
 Beverly was like my mama 
 W-A-double R-E-N 
 Tryin' to get in where I can fit in 
 Catchin' a bus with a homey I can trust 
 Three homeys from the hood straight kickin' up dust 
 Enjoyin' my days and everythang is fine 
 Fifteen years old Snoop D whoop on the grind 
 Tryin' to find ways to make it, dice shake it 
 Young, havin' fun, like me, Snoop and Nate did 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 I remember all the scams we been through, together 
 Nobody does it better on which you do the weather 
 The days we used to call first year playin' get like me 
 Gettin' in' fo' of 'zines, I loved 'em 
 Long Beach was the hometown 
 And every spot that we rocked, you know we got down 
 Outside at the club just spittin' raps 
 And every busta that ran up was gettin' cracked 
 Underground tapes used to be the claim to fame 
 Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane 
 Tellin' tales about how we was strugglin' 
 And surrounded wit the homeys that was all clubbin' 
 Tryin' to make it in this music 
 Quick fast, quick cash, and hittin' on the quick dash 
 We in this game to make hits 
 And make everybody respect the G-Funk click 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We went from young G's 
 To sellin million overseas 
 RRollin' Dees 
 And makin' money by the trees 
 To killer Bees, evading all enemies 
 Catastrophies, young GFC's 
 We made it now, livin' good wit no hassles 
 But still a lot of problems dealin' wit' shady acts, doe 
 It's all a part of makin' hits, doe 
 See our careers take off like a US missile 
 Break out the Crystal 
 I spitted it, and now it's g funked out, transmitted it 
 So you can call it what you want 
 We still goin' bring the funk 
 G's up put it down, and ya weed to float 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
 We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do
