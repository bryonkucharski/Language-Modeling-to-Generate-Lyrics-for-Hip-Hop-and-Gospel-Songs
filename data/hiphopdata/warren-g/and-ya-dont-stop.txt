For 94, I'm a just glide and swerve 
 Hop up the streets with my heats so observe 
 It's me Z the whee Z, the Warren to the G Z 
 The deuces and the treys as kickin it through E-Z 
 And the beach and the bottle where I'm found 
 Fuckin' around with the muthafuckin Dogg Pound 
 Fuck it, Warren's goin' wild 
 The G Funk Era and the muthafuckin G Child 
 Funk, melody, rhythm, base 
 He which is I is in the muthafuckin place 
 So let me get away, come again like this 
 I can turn into a murderer so please don't diss 
 'Cause if you do, you know where I'm from 
 Rat tat tat tat diddy dum diddy dum 
 And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit 
 And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit 
 Well let me grab my stick and shift to first 
 I'm spittin' plenty game on my second verse 
 Well let me switch to second just for the rough ride 
 L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H Eastside 
 Where the grass is greener, at some times 
 And I don't do shit but drop funky rhymes 
 Now I'm in neutral, shifting to third 
 'Cause what you hear is what you heard, nigga 
 From the G-Funk, G-Funk, 'cause we funk, we funk 
 And if you step muthafucka you get stomped 
 Like 1, 2, 3 I'm shiftin to the fo 
 But you don't hear me doe 
 I said humpty dumpty sat on the wall 
 I guess its time for me to sum it up for all 
 G Funk, G Child, gangsta groove, locc 
 Past tense it's the Indo smoke 
 Choke, off the shit that I'm doin' 
 I'm droppin' this shit for you and you and you and 
 'Cause it's me, the Warren to the G 
 Comin' in 1994 you see 
 The LBC and that's my locale 
 Check it out check it out check it out now 
 You know what I'm sayin', Warren motherfuckin G beeyatch 
 You know what I'm sayin', it's 94 that's how we doin' it 
 Ain't nothin' but a Long Beach thang doe big baby, hey 
 G-Funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm 
 Check me out doe, beeyatch
