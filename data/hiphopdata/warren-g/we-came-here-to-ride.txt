(RBX) 
 Once again, the circle, hehe 
 Continues to hit you with these masses hits 
 Y'know, but we gone do it something like this 
 For all them bustaz out here 
 Check this out 
 (RBX - chorus (2x)) 
 Hey, we came here to ride (don't do it) 
 Forty battle ready and set to collide (don't do it) 
 Niggaz you won't know the death you die (don't do it) 
 Suicide is a suicide (don't do it) 
 (Warren G) 
 I'm deadly as ever 
 Ready fo' whatever 
 Tryna to keep my pockets heavy on the cheddar 
 Got nothing to prove, just really expressing myself 
 Why y'all niggaz in the studio stressing yourself 
 Ya got to do it 
 So why not do it big 
 Drop the music, and spit fluid to they wig 
 Underdig 
 I'm a split the game in half 
 And leave 'em all mad like Warren you do done did 
 Hey, we came here to ride 
 Never slippin', but rather sippin' on my side 
 Blaze up 
 'Cause I'm tryin' ta raise up 
 And flow I came up, from broke to paper'd up 
 Don't test me 
 I bust like a 12 gauge sort of 
 And hoes jump on stage and rip they draws off 
 And I see through all that see-through 
 Make up and weave in ya hair these ignit 
 But, hey 
 (RBX - chorus (2x)) 
 (Warren G) 
 Sworing to the streets 
 Born in the Beach 
 Armed with the heat 
 Mourning my peeps 
 Makin' niggaz respect mine, I came to collect mine 
 Comin' through with a Tech 9, lettin' my neck shine 
 I let a nigga slide with a pass but next time 
 I might disconnect his neck from his spine 
 Run up and catch 'em from behind and stretch 'em 
 We squeez triggers like ketchup, wet ya whole stretch up 
 Scared of the truth, you fear it, don't wanna hear it 
 Till the Smith's bust, then you listen up 
 'Cause I'm a tell it like it is, like it was or like it always will be 
 Give a fuck if you feel me 
 (RBX - chorus (2x)) 
 (Warren G) 
 Who am I? 
 W-A double R E-N to the mothafuckin' G 
 Suicide 
 Niggaz hang theyself 
 Might as well bend over, and fingerbang theyself 
 Sell they soul for the faim and wealth 
 And end up broke and lonely 
 Nobody to blame but yourself 
 But me, I keep it all business 
 'Cause this is business, can I get a witness 
 See I been chillin' like a villain 
 With a million and my children 
 Plottin' or revealin' what the game been conceilin' 
 I got a little older and learned a bit 
 A plot the effort and earned a grip 
 Now I know there is a hater in every circle 
 As I roll another vega heavy with purple 
 Take a puff and inhale and hold it till it get stale 
 In my chest exhale my stress 
 My nigga R-B-X 
 (RBX - chorus (2x))
