I don't know why they mad at me 
 They can't catch me but still they after me 
 When we deal face to face, is a tragedy 
 You ask why I got my gun they might blast at me 
 Real niggaz, real shit, reality 
 Who gives a fuck if you niggaz is mad at me 
 Fuck around with Warren G it's a tragedy 
 Real niggaz, real shit, reality 
 Warren G top dog 
 Patrollin the beach 
 Niggaz say they as hard as bitch 
 But they're as soft as a peach 
 Claimin the G of all G's 
 Please 
 I come blowin' through like the breeze 
 Sittin' on threes 
 Post it 
 Coastin mashing down Pacfic Coastin 
 The bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon 
 With nuts hangin' from the city 
 Where the bangers is being banging 
 It don't seem like shit is changing 
 I holla'd at the homey the other day 
 G'ded up at the park sippin alisah 
 One of the homeys took a beaten 
 So now we spend at being a gang 
 Of checking at the meetin like cycles repeatin 
 It's just another sunset fall in sea 
 I can here the homeys in the past callin me 
 And you know what I discovered 
 What they keep saying 
 Keep your mind on your money 
 Muthafuckers and shake busters 
 Have you ever sold millions 
 But yet you niggaz persist to talk shit 
 Get of my dick 
 You never catch me slipping 
 Rollin' with the heat 
 Slap the clip in 
 I never thought the world would started trippin' 
 My life is a trip, though 
 Hit the crip though 
 Blow the whistle 
 They think I banged 
 So I packed a pistol 
 Warren to tha G is a G 
 I don't fuck with you nigga 
 So don't fuck with me 
 Let's ride to the east side 
 Slide like a fo 
 I packs a fo-fo 
 When I'm steppin out doors 
 To the bang to the buggy 
 If I speak then I spoke 
 Warren G do it every time to you Locc 
 Get the party beat like blaze and smoke 
 The east side and the beach 
 West side of the coast 
 You know the niggaz that I ride with 
 Hogs, attack dogs 
 The same niggaz I'm down to die with muthafucka 
 Who's the man 
 I've been from London to Japan 
 Stomp land to land 
 To the Egyptian sands 
 You can't check me 
 Dis-respect me 
 Or mop me up 
 With the base bumpin' out my truck 
 And all these police trying to lock me up 
 Money rules the world 
 And I made the loot 
 So don't make me shoot 
 'Cause trying to mash 
 Will get you done every time 
 I ain't trying to hurt nobody 
 But I'm down for mine
