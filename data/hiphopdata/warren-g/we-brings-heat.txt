G-Child- 
 Playaz, playettes, macks, trues, wannabes 
 All you muthafuckaz, we gonna kick it like this, 
 For the trues 
 Jah Skills- 
 Yeah this crew was tight, went from planning dreams 
 Now we rockin' mics, gettin' shit right, stayin on beat, 
 And servin' this heat, through yo streets, jealous hoes peep, 
 But me, I don't sleep 
 So you know I catch you watchin 
 While they comin' with drama, I'm blockin and steady knockin' 
 The post is won out the box, it don't stop, hittin our areas and shakin up spots 
 Warren G- 
 I'm bakin blocks in four wheel motion 
 Everywhere I look I see 21 ones floatin (21st Street!) 
 Then I made a stop at the P-A-C's 
 Wassup y'all? You seen Tripp L-O double C, now, 
 I'm headin to the back where the homeys is posted, 
 Niggaz on gat in case plat wanna get roasted 
 But you know how that go, in the city of snakes, fakes, hmm and bitch brakes 
 I shakes, back to the topic called heat, 
 My beat, your treat, can't nobody fuck wit me, 
 'Cause I'm known from Cali to Rome, 
 We brings heat, so now its on 
 Bring heat to the table and play your cards right 
 My crew got heat we got game air tight 
 Knee-Hi- 
 Through thick and thin, see we like kin 
 And it won't stop no matter what happens, 
 Man you not knowin', who's tops they be blowin' 
 I brings heat, independent and I will release, 
 The ultraviolet, bangin' beats for the pilot, 
 Got the sky lit now who really wanna try it, 
 Its warm when we swarm, your area gonna get torn, 
 And a job that work g funk in the purest form, 
 For what its worth, I'm a let you know, 
 I'm hyperactive for those who react too slow, all alone 
 My fleets movin fast, hand in hand with the aftermath, 
 My skills was built to last 
 Wayniac- 
 Forever in a day, but some days we gotta trip, 
 Throwin' lics for grits, steady stackin our chips, 
 The money clips don't fit, now is it the way we dip on, 
 These and those, mo Gs and hoes, I assumes on a mission, (on a mission) 
 Conditions ain't the same got the average nigga wishin, but still missin', 
 The simple facts it ain't like that, 
 Turn the tables when the label don't react, its Wayniac 
 Jah Skillz- 
 Too much clout I'm havin' so niggaz be grabbin at my wealth, 
 At test a math, set them back on the shelf, 
 They say we love your skills, I'm good for your health, 
 My lifeline droppin' the dime on them like a stealth bomb, 
 Will calm a nigga down with my one round, 
 Suppose they act up, my back up's involved now, 
 GFCs included, my crew is undisputed, 
 Heavyweight champs, known for blowin' out yo amps 
 Trip Locc- 
 I had patience but now I'm anxious, 
 Lurkin like a cat on the deal with my sack, 
 I know somebody watchin the Locc, 
 Can't stop 'cause it just start poppin' please, 
 I gots tah have it like Mickey D's, 
 Over 60 billion served rollin' on the daily, 
 Can't tell me shit put it in and I won't notice, 
 Me and my niggaz nothin' but that top notch, 
 Long Beach postin up the road blocks, 
 You can't go through, or around, you gotta turn back, 
 I'm gettin' turned back, ridahs and killaz that don't play that, 
 Known to bring it on when it pop, missions to clock, 
 Stages to rock, when I'm done lounge at the spot 
 Chorus repeats to fade
