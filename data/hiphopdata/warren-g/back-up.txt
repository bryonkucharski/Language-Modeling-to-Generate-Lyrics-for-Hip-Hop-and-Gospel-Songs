 Nigga back up, see I came to stack up 
 Bodies like hits, what's that 
 You wanted to act up, and diss the click 
 A sister, put my niggaz up wetted the grave 
 You wanted to get richer, so offer your beats that made by fade 
 Cascade, because yo ass is soapy

 When yo ass used to be low key 
 You know me so act like you know my click 
 And I'm an assist to kick the shit that you and MD could never get with 
 And speakin' of MD, another nigga that used to be from my click 
 Act like he double to down, but when it go down, go down he splits 
 This is strictly for all of y'all niggaz that diss me 
 Y'all think y'all skills is up to par well stars come out and get me 
 Now we got these niggaz out on the streets, and a place to lay my gun?

 Well let that nigga loose 
 No better yet just let the dog loose 
 So he could fetch, goin' to Vegas to see what he catch 
 Ain't gonna be no cases 
 Just tell him what he faces and watch him snitch 
 While I lay up in Vegas 
 Its either the Raiders or the switch so he did 
 Switched over like electric shocks 
 Moms got on pregnant static 
 So they suspected pops 
 Did they know about me 
 Mr. K-9 see, clicksta in deep, in your Mama's panties 
 Did they know that I was bangin' it 
 Where at, oh your Daddy's bread be back 
 Now she's pregnant and I ain't claimin it 
 Your husband's cryin 'cause he feels like a chump 
 What, your son is fit to die and he ain't nothin' but a punk huh 
 She can't sayin' nothin' 'cause she needs my support? 
 But not for the child see the hooker's tryin' to take him to court 
 And I'm a body like Jah 
 But accept with mo mil 
 We probably wasmeant for each other 
 'Cause we two niggaz they gave us both jams
