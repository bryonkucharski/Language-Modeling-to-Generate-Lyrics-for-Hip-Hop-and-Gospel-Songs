Microphone check one two uh 
 And you don't stop 
 Microphone check one two uh 
 And ya don't quit 
 Microphone check one two one two 
 Let me clear my throat so I can do what I gotta do 
 It's expresso, mandle that I'm stacked 
 Niggaz, tryin' to corner the market but I'm back 
 Bang to the boogie, and boogie to the bang 
 It's G-Funk for life sewing up everything 
 Little locs, pay attention 
 Do I or should I have to mention 
 44 ways where the grass is greener 
 From OG to BG is a misdemeanor 
 St. Mary's Hospital, 10:20 AM 
 On the street called Atlantic is where I began 
 Ola May, uh, that's my lady, she made me 
 On a street under the bridge called hill, that's where she raised me 
 Transformers, busters in disguise 
 I say chitty chitty bang bang 
 Brothers wanna gang bang 
 Tryin' to represent but don't know about the gang thang 
 21st where it all begun 
 Begun us on the corner with the homies havin' fun 
 I was a youngsta, peepin from the other corner 
 Seeing sets in the air with big arms now I wanna 
 Be like them, and act like them 
 And stack like them and try to mack like them 
 Shit, its hard being Warren G from the LB 
 And like the G's before, you know me 
 So I'm a stay down, for the eastside 
 Not like you busters, transformers in disguise 
 One to twenty-one, and you know I ain't gonna stall 
 I gotta give it up with the homie roll call 
 OG cry baby, and the homie big roc 
 Mooch on the side with the stockin can ride 
 Big sugar mama, flee bag and 
 Lady roe guard and marathon they OG see 
 Salt Lake crew got little shorty Charlotte, 
 But back to Louis with T-Bone is where I started, 
 Livin' in the back in a little pink shack
