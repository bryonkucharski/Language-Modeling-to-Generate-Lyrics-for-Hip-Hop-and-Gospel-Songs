Well it's the super, the duper, the Landcruisin trooper 
 ?Take action? at times, they hang on my rhyme like Mr. Cooper 
 I'm takin' you to a zone that's much far from wackness 
 So please could you tell me oh bud buddy can you hack this? 
 Yo, oh no, grab a hold of fadeables, gettin' her flows on 
 Like FloJo, runs in a marathon 
 Smooth like chocolate, so call me Big Mamma Kane 
 Feels like another one goin' out for her reign 
 Step back, because I happen to be all that plus tax 
 I got more subscribers than HBO or Cinemax 
 Mile after mile I rip style after style 
 Crack dope in all the vials, ooh I'm glad I used Dial 
 Cause it can get funky when I'm singin' my song 
 But I just flow on, and so on, I'm stinky 'cause I roll on 
 And then I hear rhyme callin I won't give it a rest 
 That's how I got the motherfuckin Super on my chest 
 (Snoop: Fly through the sky gettin' love) 
 (?: The whole wide world will watch me) 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 Mister it's the, Masta Aces of the spade 
 Rappin' skills are thinner than niggaz on AIDS 
 Up up and away it's the Super Soul Sis 
 I talk so much shit I got, halitosis 
 I knows this, I flows this, I'm funky, you stank 
 You a walkin' blood bank I'm withdrawin' with my shank 
 Thanks for the memories, remember me no remedies 
 Surrender the vicinity or catch a cap like a Kennedy 
 'Cause I'm the Superwoman rapper I deserve a hail 
 Chasin MC's, got 'em on the run like Smurfs from Azrael 
 No bluff, the magic I puff, I'm chokin sho nuff 
 I'm takin' a bite out of rappers as if my name was MC Negra 
 (Warren G: She's hotter than the South land on fire) 
 All you MC's desire, to run through my pyre 
 I'm turnin' heads like the Exorcist while flexin this 
 'Cause it's the Super Soul Sis 
 Sat on the outside, but now I'm the arena 
 A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a 
 Soulful, 'cause I got a bowl-full of soul 
 Strollin because I have no vehicle to roll 
 But bring it bring it back to the topic of the solar mind 
 I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be off beat and still on time 
 I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean 
 Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion 
 'Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make 
 I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight 
 Break ya Achey like Billy Ray, I'm fuckin' up the industry 
 And fins to be,* Nanu Nanu like Mork and Mindy
