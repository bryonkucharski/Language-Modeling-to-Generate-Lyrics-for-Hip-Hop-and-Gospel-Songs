Good evening, morning, afternoon, wherever, whosenever, 
 Whatsenever, we wouldn't give a damn. 
 We want to welcome you back into the house 
 Of G-Funk. 
 Hmm? That's right. 
 Since we last left ya, we had went international. 
 And one thing we noticed about everywhere we went, 
 It's a whole lotta folk funkin', 
 And don't know what the funk they funkin' wit. 
 Huh? 
 Look out there now. We came to bring it.
