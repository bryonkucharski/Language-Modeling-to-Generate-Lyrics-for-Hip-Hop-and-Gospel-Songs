Ooh, yeah, yeah, what's love got to do 
 Warren G rap for me, yeah, mmm 
 When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place 
 There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face 
 You wanna live fat off of my sack 
 You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act 
 'Cause back before '92 and '93 
 You didn't give a damn about Warren G 
 But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's 
 All of a sudden you on my N.U.T's 
 Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop 
 'Cause money makes the world 
 Go 'round and the panties drop 
 I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure 
 I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure 
 Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep 
 Thought you was TLC, you had to creep 
 You say you had love, I said you bullshit 
 It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right) 
 What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh) 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it 
 If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it 
 Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines 
 Before I made beats, I was down to grind 
 Back then, every single homey had my back 
 Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack 
 But I'm the same brother day in and day out 
 And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket 
 It's drastic 'cause homies is plastic 
 Break 'em off some bread 
 They want the whole damn basket 
 If you's a true homey, you would wish me well 
 Not plot to make a brother fail, jealous as hell 
 We used to get the same riches 
 Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches 
 Which is not a surprise, my eyes peep game 
 211's, 187's it's all the same 
 It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip 
 Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right) 
 What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh) 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right) 
 If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it 
 Now for these labels tellin' fables 
 Makin' the fucked-up deals under the tables 
 You think that you smart, but fool, I'm the smartest 
 You can't make no money if you can't keep an artist 
 Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf 
 Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself 
 I know how it goes, treat an artist like a ho' 
 Fly cars, gold, clothes, but no dough 
 Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine 
 Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime 
 'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck 
 You bend over for the label, and you will get fucked 
 Like how we run up in a trick, and then you're through 
 The record label do the same shit to you 
 90% business, 10% show 
 Ain't no love in this game 'cause it's all about the dough 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right) 
 What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh) 
 What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right) 
 If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it 
 (Repeat)
