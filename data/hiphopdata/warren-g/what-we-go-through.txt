(What's up Warren G?) 
 What's happenin'? I'm just chillin', you know 
 Checkin' my game you dig, you know 
 Trippin' off these fools around the situation, you know it's like that 
 (Mr. Malik) 
 I went from hustlin and slangin to bustin' and bangin' 
 I got to keep it real, so fuck not cursin when I'm sangin 
 Now let me tell y'all about this shit, went down the other night 
 Me and the doggs see some niggaz, just caught up in da hype 
 Tryin' to ride and get by like da FBI 
 'Cause we know 'bout them hk's, they right outside 
 But we never knew y'all had a clue bout what we go through 
 So tell how the fuck could you speak on my crew 
 (Badass) 
 I went from dirt to large work like boatloads of keys 
 It's hard work and it hurts to live life on ya knees 
 So God please have a lil mercy on my soul 
 What my eyes see my mind think my hand should hold 
 The outcome of these actions warm hearts turn cold 
 Lil snake tryin' to blast me wit the gun he stole 
 We hang out, banged out, same route as the day before 
 Blessed wit perception, but don't know how my days a go 
 Could see my nigga hittin wit some pay, a few days ago 
 (Perfec) 
 Blaze up a flow, sit watch my paper grow 
 Cautious, in case niggaz wanna cross this 
 But they can't cross me, I'm way too flossy 
 Out here makin' millions 
 All in wit the villians 
 Let's turn these millions to trillions 
 I've seen it all pop slow unfold, and go 
 Now it's time to get mo' dough, ya know 
 I play unda tha wrath a thunder 
 Electric shocks hot as da summer 
 More foul than funner, gun ya 
 In the open range, man it seems strange 
 Even sometimes deranged inside my brain 
 I hold the key, identify then flee 
 Every MC close to me 
 'Cause I'm supposed to be all in wit my chips (nigga) 
 I'm all in with the crips and bloods 
 Grips for thugs, I nudge 
 The homey on his shoulda, 'cause every day I'm gettin' older 
 As the world turns and gets colder 
 Laid back I shot me sumpin, Perfec from dynamic, bangin' G-Funk 
 (Warren G) 
 Well I moved from the East to the West 
 Word on the street, niggaz wanna test 
 But these MC's, is scared to buck 
 Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts 
 You fuckin' rookies 
 Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies 
 Ya hate me one minute and tha next ya wanna buck me 
 He sent a hoe, in the back seat of my fo' 
 While ya Goin' Back To Cali, watch how you flow 
 Now ya know, about this Warren G Era 
 G-Funk terror, look into tha mirror 
 And what you see is the don of the company 
 (Warren G, Warren, Warren, Warren's to tha G) 
 You still see, what I see 
 All of the homies in the LB 
 Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash 
 Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Locc and Bad Ass 
 And we never knew you had clue of what we go through 
 So how in tha fuck could y'all speak of our crew 
 Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back 
 Yeah it's like that, for me it's like that 
 Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash 
 It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass 
 Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash 
 It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass 
 Ya know what I'm sayin' Warren G 
 With my homeboy from the pound Hershey Locc 
 And the homey Perfec, ya know what I'm sayin' and Mr. Badass 
 And that's how we doin' it fool, yeah 
 We ain't bangin' on wacks nigga, we doin' it like we should be fool, 
 Yeah
