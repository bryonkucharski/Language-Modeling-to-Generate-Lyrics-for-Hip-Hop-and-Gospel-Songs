Hey, nah ya goin' miss up on the G-Funk era, 
 Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar 
 11-10-7 D that was my intro 
 But now I'm makin' doe, I'm rollin' a 64 
 'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener 
 Brotha throwin' up sets in hoods like they neva seen a 
 Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right 
 I got 44 ways to make you act right 
 And it's a shame how the game must be played 
 It was told never fold by the brothas you can't fade 
 So raise up off this young hog 
 'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all 
 I got my own thang 'cause I let my beat swang 
 If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain 
 So as I creep can you peep what I speak 
 Techniques unique, so what you sayin' is obsolete 
 So there it is as I go about my days 
 I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways 
 I'm bein true, ain't no fakin wit me 
 Brothas plottin on me, tryin' to test if I can see 
 But I'm peepin out the scene for the peeps who give me props 
 For stayin out that madness, you know it ain't goin' stop 
 In so many ways I let 'em know, in so many ways I let it flow 
 But you still don't hear me doe 
 So I'm a break it down 'cause its quite elementary 
 This is for the homeys in the penetentiary 
 AB, Baby Poppa, Big Arch from the block 
 And the homey Jay Dogg, stay down 'cause you's a hog 
 I got plenty love, and homey love stays 
 I can only bring it to you like this, in so many ways 
 I stay true to the game 
 But some stay blind to the fact 
 That if I don't look good, you don't look good 
 So please rearrange and change the thangs you doin' 
 You playin' yourself 'cause you the ones gettin' screwed 
 As I, ease on down the rick road 
 As I shift from first to second, cruise control 
 So swack up the doja 
 'Cause I got the drink, and don't think 
 We don't roll without a full tank 
 Of that bomb, that we call the funk 
 'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want 
 Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town 
 Brothas flip flop and they neva stay down 
 Wanna be all they can be, but gettin' held back 
 Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of lick is that? 
 So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay 
 I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways
