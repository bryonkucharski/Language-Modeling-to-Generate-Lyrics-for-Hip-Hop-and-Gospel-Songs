Your musical evolution has ended. We control the sound. 
 Its time we all got down. We bring you electrofonic funk funk funk funk. 
 We want yo hands in the air with yo mouth shut 
 With Hershey Locc on the mic and Warren G is on the cut 
 We make your heart beat, with Hershey Locc and Warren G 
 Mr. Malik- 
 We make yo heart beat like the beat of a heart 
 With these rhymes I release busta B plays his part 
 Get it start, get it set, I bet we goin' 
 G Funk plus timer the energize bunny still goin' 
 Ain't you knowin', I'm so seasick and tired of these niggaz 
 Tryin' to get us all start up, 'cause they got caught up by trickaz now 
 Lock down to all blood clots, Malik and Warren G and we shakin up 
 Spots 
 Warren G- 
 Plots, when we got work to do 
 From Atlanta GA to the beach with the Long Beach Crew 
 Ooh, what would you do what we do, what we do when we comin' after 
 You 
 Mr. Malik- 
 They say that drama for they Mama, no we can't talk like Tevyn 
 Wonder why they families cried and died before 97 
 Them and they sins burn to heavy make it all the way to heaven 
 And we keep bellin, yo G Z it ain't easy tell em 
 Warren G- 
 It's the second time arizzound 
 You know we gotta clizzown 
 Young GFC and Hershey Locc from the pizzound 
 From OG to BG, from BG to OG 
 My sounds thump pump pump and you know me 
 We want yo hands in the air with yo mouth shut 
 With Hershey Locc on the mic and Warren G in the cut 
 We make your heart beat, with Hershey Locc and Warren G 
 Mr Malik- 
 Now he's solo while we roll up on yo block like the kesops 
 Makin' everybody drop stop and stand it one spizzop 
 We have it locked, to the tic toc it don't stop 
 From our block to his block, it is that world bombs a lot 
 Everybody got glocks, but let him learn about 
 How them worms rock to the worms drop 
 Yeah you heard we rock, microphones by the masses 
 You never smash it, I get C-Notes diggin for the casket 
 It gets drastic, no need to ask if, we straight up mashin 
 If we don't start up all y'all to ball cashin 
 The throat locc apparatus when 
 Front to back again, what you want we back again 
 Now if a spliff did lyrically gifted, time to rap it then 
 So everybody throw your muthafunkin hands up in the wind 
 La la la la la, dee dee da dee dee da dee da 
 Warren G- 
 I got brew D like brady more like trump 
 Like the homey Tracy D who the quick to dunk 
 Follow me, back to the situation at hand 
 We make your heartbeat bounce, wit ya hands on your chest and your 
 Pecs 
 Open I'm scopin, the homey straight loccin, break we go for broken 
 What you smokin' the bomb blueberry 
 G Z Whee Z's back and its scary 
 To each and everyone of you wannabes 
 You wants none of these we rap catastrophies 
 Make ya heart beat ooh, ah, dee dee da dee dee da dee dee da dee da
