He young, he young, he young, he young, 
 She young, she young, she young, she young, 
 He young, he young, he young, he young, 
 She young, she young, she young, she young 
 I hit the 21 blocks each and every day 
 Niggaz peepin they shoulders in each and every way 
 No sweat, 'cause if I sweat it 
 I stay true to the game, so I'm not gonna let it 
 Take control of me, fool you can roll with me 
 From OG to OG you can reminisce with me 
 About the hutch, about the milk bowl, 
 Two dee took a bank left knockin' fools out on 
 It was me baby boppa and the homey tic 
 All my folks locked down, gotta make it legit 
 So I'm a spit, and keep my spittin' straight real 
 I know that you can feel penetentiary steel 
 Locked down all around for the homies touchin down 
 When my rags get out you walk a safe ground (walk a safe ground) 
 'Cause I'm a let them ride killah 
 You betta stay inside and keep yo shit on yo side nigga 
 Set trippin' wit me 
 Because what I see is greenery, and that's all I see 
 As the day gets older, don't tweak, take a look over your shoulder 
 Young, dumb, full of fun 
 Dum diddy dum diddy you'll get done 
 (Knee-Hi) 
 Livin' this life 
 I can't help but dis my dream 
 Maybe since West anthems (?) I want to roll a beam 
 Clean, but only had to be a mex 
 Now hopefully that 850 lookin' spiffy, will come next 
 I bounced to 120 and Figueroa 
 Yeah, my house posted across from the store 
 Just like that hit by the drive way and park in the back 
 1986 fools is known to jack 
 Around this click of the hood you found no punks 
 Many gang bangers, dope fiends and drunks 
 I learned, bunny hops, still rocks and cops 
 I ran out of boys with toys 
 And nights sees on hot days 
 Just apple sticks on death 
 RC cola to break a sweat 
 Now I bet that everybody's comin' up 
 If you turnin' the wrong street 
 Lie you bout to get stuck 
 Now what 
 (Jayo Felony) 
 I ain't no muthaufuckin murdera (nigga) I'm a killah 
 'Cause murderers get life nigga and killaz keep killin' 
 I'd ratha die with my eyes open 
 So I can see how these muthafuckaz wanna do me 
 They set me free bullet loco head with the beat what 
 And these niggaz know they have to retreat when I speak 
 The younger dumb wanna have some fun 
 And drinkin' liqour way before the age of 21 
 So how you figure that'll never put in work for that hood he love 
 You never paid him no attention so who should he love 
 And to keep a strap on him or a phat sack on him 
 And some bomb but be patrollin the hood 
 Ran a hoe's name through the mud 
 And these crooked's stick a strap in your mouth, without a doubt 
 That's the reason got lost and turned out 
 He shoulda keep patient 
 But you was still money chasin 
 A double life is what that young nigga facin 
 And all because he was
