Chiggie check, microphone check two, 
 Chiggie check, microphone check three 
 Check game from the notorious Compton G 
 Back with some shit that gots to bump 
 As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk 
 Just to floss you like a motherfucker, clownin' their shit 
 Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch 
 Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe 
 If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper 
 It's back on the track 
 With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack 
 So Daz, step up on the ass 
 And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past 
 Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote 
 With my nigga D-are-E, so you know I must be dope 
 But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass 
 Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK 
 That I bring as I slang like cavy 
 Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy 
 Had he not known about the city I'm from 
 Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back 
 Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit 
 BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood 
 God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up 
 On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling 
 But did you raise up all this nuts? 
 Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up 
 Chiggie check, microphone check one, 
 Chiggie check, microphone check two, 
 Chiggie check, microphone check three 
 You tuned to the sounds of the D-are-E, 
 Now check me out, it's back to the old school 
 Where the niggas get their strap on, don't nobody cap on 
 Slap on some D-are-E 
 Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double G-Y-D-O-double G 
 Real G's who drop K's, protect these N-you-T, so nigga please 
 Peep out my manuscript 
 You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit 
 Bitch! 
 So recognize game from the gangsta 
 Things will remain the same until I change 'em 
 It's real easy to see, 
 So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double G, 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street, 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street, 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street, 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street, 
 I heard you want to fuck with Dre, 
 You picked the wrong, motherfucking day 
 Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow, 
 Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row, 
 I heard you want to fuck with Dre, 
 You picked the wrong, motherfucking day,
