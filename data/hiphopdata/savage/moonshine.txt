I can't go no where, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you here, I said right here by my side 
 I can't roam the town, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you around, Right here by my side 
 So where's my moonshine, 'Cause I'll be all up in the club 
 With you yeah 
 So where's my moonshine, Ya know I spend my last dub 
 For you yeah 
 So where's my moonshine, I feel so nice with you yeah 
 So where's my moonshine, Wanna spend my whole life 
 With you yeah 
 I snuck into this club when I was 15 
 And I met my girl at the bar such a sweet thing 
 Every time I held her she would always kiss me 
 Every touch of her lips would always make me tipsy 
 I told her man I love you, pulled her to the dance floor 
 And that's when she whispered, be careful what you ask for 
 I grabbed her by the waist and I sat her on the table 
 Explained how her heartburn she's giving me is painful 
 And now you wanna leave cause you feel empty inside 
 Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive 
 I'm so into you I hope you're feeling it 
 I need you in my life and the reason is 
 I can't go no where, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you here, I said right here by my side 
 I can't roam the town, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you around, Right here by my side 
 How many times I gotta tell you why you stressing me for 
 Yeah I see you need attention I ain't tryin' to ignore 
 I gotta straighten up now I got work to do 
 You want me to drop everything so it surrounds you 
 Man I love you so much it makes me sick to my stomach 
 And I love it how I can vomit and you think nothing of it 
 I never meant to argue with you, please forgive 
 Girl I need you in my life and the reason is 
 I can't go no where, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you here, I said right here by my side 
 I can't roam the town, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you around, Right here by my side 
 Ya see my moonshine she keeps me warm when it rains 
 I forget my problems when she eases the pain 
 And my friends keep telling me to call it a day 
 She don't love you savage it's all in ya brain 
 See I don't believe a word that you say to my face 
 I'm in love and I know she feels the same 
 I'll buy you all the ice you want, and I'll keep you safe 
 Man I love my alcohol, what more can I say 
 I can't go no where, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you here, I said right here by my side 
 I can't roam the town, unless you're by my side 
 I gotta have you around, Right here by my side
