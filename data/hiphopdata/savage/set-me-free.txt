Yeah, yo I need you to hear me on this one 
 Give me five minutes of guitar 
 There might be something here you might understand 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 Have you ever had that feeling where you just felt lost 
 And everybody in your circle got they two-face on 
 And you can trace your steps where you came from 
 So you get down on your knees to bring you closer to God 
 You're asking, "Are You punishing me?" 
 Lord, I'm on my knees forgive me for all my sins I've done 
 And set me free, I need a bed in my life to make it positive 
 'Cause I don't want to die but I don't want to live 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 God spoke and He answered my prayers 
 Not with words but He brought me to tears be patient not greedy 
 So I fought through the years and that's why I'm standing here 
 On my own 2, me and my whole crew's the one 
 That hold true stick by your side 
 For everything you go through and that's the whole truth 
 My music's God's gift so I don't want to die 
 Because I got to live 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I know I've got to live 
 No need to feel that way, God's got a plan for me 
 Sometimes I feel alone but I make it on my own 
 Every night I pray I'll make it through each day 
 Yeah, well, have you ever came to that point 
 Where you didn't know what you were here for 
 You didn't know if God gave you a gift 
 Or if there was a God? See, you're at that time 
 Where you just sit down and pray you talk to God 
 And you're like it'd be funny nonsense 
 But instead of talking to you 
 He shows you what you're here for 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free 
 I don't want to die, I don't want to live 
 God, please help me, Lord, set me free
