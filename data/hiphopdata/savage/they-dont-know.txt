(Feat. Aaradhna) 
 (Chorus: Aaradhna) 
 The neighbourhood dudes think I'm no go 
 But, they don't know 
 Girls at school think you is a fool 
 But, they don't know 
 I could be yours, but - 
 They'll never know 
 They can think whatever they like 
 But I want you to know 
 Savage: 
 You gotta tell me straight - are the rumors true? 
 Did you really do them things that you use to? 
 'Cause the girls at school say that I'm a fool 
 And they don't understand what I see in you 
 When I, don't know why they're bugging me 
 And they, always start tripping when you're hugging me 
 But I, really think you're lovely 
 And I guess they can't get enough of me 
 And I'm sick of she say, he say shit 
 What you done, where you been and who you with 
 These girls ain't my friends, they just like to shine 
 All of a sudden they jealous 'cause I made you mine 
 (Chorus: Aaradhna) 
 The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go 
 But, they don't know 
 Girls at school think you is a fool 
 But, they don't know 
 I could be yours, but - 
 They'll never know 
 They can think whatever they like 
 But I want you to know 
 Savage: 
 Now here goes Charlie talking shit 
 Telling all the boys you was all his chick 
 Now I don't wanna resort to this 
 If I have to Charlie will be falling quick 
 And I don't understand why they all keep bugging 
 I walk in the room nobody ain't say nothing 
 They always calling when they see you out clubbing 
 (Savage I think your girl was getting up to something) 
 Huh, yo that can't be true, now you wouldn't be lying 
 To my face now would you 
 Besides she was out with my sister 
 And they both told me you was tryna kick it with her 
 Friends how many of us have them 
 Right before the time when they start back stabbing, huh 
 Never mind they all of that 
 Now can you please, can you please give it up for Savage 
 (Chorus: Aaradhna) 
 The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go 
 But, they don't know 
 Girls at school think you is a fool 
 But, they don't know 
 I could be yours, but - 
 They'll never know 
 They can think whatever they like 
 But I want you to know 
 They don't know, no-no, no they don't even know 
 We got this good thing goin' on 
 From the streets to the room 
 From the streets to the room 
 My steez for you and that's 
 What I want you to know [x2] 
 (Chorus x2: Aaradhna) 
 The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go 
 But, they don't know 
 Girls at school think you is a fool 
 But, they don't know 
 I could be yours, but 
 They'll never know 
 They can think whatever they like 
 But I want you to know [x2]
