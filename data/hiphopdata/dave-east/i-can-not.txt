Gangster 
 Gangster 
 5 bands fresh up out the cage, no cut walkin' out the court 
 Fuck the judge, we got shit you could snort 
 I heard you take back everything that you bought 
 If you was my cellmate, shit we would've fought 
 Yeah I got felonies, yeah I was sellin' tree 
 Black told me whip that shit up with a fork 
 This money comin', what the fuck is you tellin' me? 
 Now I'm just shoppin' out Beverly Hills 
 I got pills, tell me what is you sellin' me? 
 I know you make up with jealousy 
 I'm just chillin' where felons be 
 I'm lightin' cookies and celery 
 Only wit niggas I know going to hell with me 
 Burn in that fire for all we done done 
 Only keep medical all in my blunt 
 I got some pills and y'all could get one 
 I got some hoes, if I call they gon' come 
 We up in the mansion, we all from the slums 
 I had a dream I was talkin' to Pun 
 I told him I just had a talk with his son 
 I told him his father was part of the sum 
 My man just called me, he got caught with a gun 
 Pray to God, ain't no bodies on it 
 Tried to sell it, ain't nobody want it 
 See a corner, ain't nobody on it 
 I can make it mine by the mornin' 
 Tres, nickels, dimes, and them quarters 
 Gotta check the line for informants 
 You ain't even signed, you recordin' 
 Talkin' to the swine since they caught him 
 When they said that time you was talkin' 
 Better off residin' in a coffin 
 I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I cannot see it) 
 I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (Facts) 
 I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chains you got on that look fake (Bang bang) 
 I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste (Ah!) 
 I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I can't see it) 
 I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (Trappin') 
 I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chains you got on that look fake (Can't trust it) 
 I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste (Ah!) 
 Listen, I been drinkin' Rose so long, so this year I'll do nothin' but Ace (Ace) 
 When BIG died, Harlem World dropped, I swear I listen to nothin' but Ma$e (Murder) 
 They talk behind my back all the time but never say nothin' up to my face (Never) 
 I jump out the Wraith with the homie 
 These diamonds they jump out the face of the Rollie 
 She textin' my phone like she naked and horny 
 And I ain't got time, got a plane in the mornin' 
 I'm high off some shit, I don't know what they call it 
 They gave me a number but I'm never callin' it 
 And we make a movie anywhere that we walkin' 
 Anyway we livin' the shit you just talkin' it 
 Better pay attention who you been talkin' with 
 I told LV I won't stop till we all get rich 
 Hoppin' in something I'm good with my marketin' 
 You ain't got it, you ain't got it, no bargainin' 
 Block the number, guarantee she gon' call again 
 Heads always turn around when we walkin' in 
 Money comin', I could ball like a tournament 
 I ain't got it, if you need it, I'll order it 
 This designer shit, I wasn't affordin' it 
 Public housing, where them cameras recordin' shit 
 I don't give a fuck as long as my daughter rich 
 Catch you in the store, have the whole corner lit 
 Early morning in the lobby we loiterin' 
 I think AI was a Hoya then 
 That's back when I couldn't afford the rent 
 Life is a bitch, so enjoy it then 
 Look at my neck you wonder where that water went 
 Money to get and I swear I want all of it 
 I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I can't see it) 
 I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (facts) 
 I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chain you got on that look fake (bang, bang)
