You know I can address the rumors far for debate. But like Nas said, life is good, just deposited a couple really big checks. My voice is everywhere and my woman's the baddest. I really can't complain about nothin' 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 They prayin' I don't make it 
 They treatin' me like I'm famous 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 Dave East 
 We took it to the table and we broke it down 
 If they ain't want it before, I bet they want it now 
 Trip to Vegas, bettin' it all, that's a poker town 
 Beef and Broc, Polo brown, meet me by the polo grounds 
 Set up shop, let's get familiar, gotta know the town 
 Know the fiends and gotta know the way the police roll around 
 Porsche box with the mirror tint, they on us now 
 Take him to the river, one headshot, he'll slowly drown 
 With the fishes, now it's residence 
 Niggas lose it all just in the pursuit of presidents 
 I don't smoke trash, hit the bay, not talkin' pelican 
 Pills got these kids robbin' they mother for medicine 
 Four and a baby, I'm tryna stretch it 
 Couple pounds of regular, fuck it just take the exit 
 The Xannys in the Jansport 
 I really used to transport 
 Back and forth to Virginia I probably hit your man off 
 A couple niggas ran off 
 I see they tryna turn me to the old me 
 Thinkin' 'bout a homi for that bad work they sold me 
 Tryna pitch green since I was 15 in '03 
 In the field, the way I'm kickin' shit, go get a goalie 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 They prayin' I don't make it 
 They treatin' me like I'm famous 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 Pusha T 
 Champagne rains on your main bitch 
 The SLS doors do the crane kick 
 She only contemplates rappers if they famous 
 Finds drug dealers way more entertainin' 
 Guess I'm the best of both worlds 
 Minus the R. Kelly, the shoot outs are all Belly 
 Summertime Loubourtin, the bitches get all jelly 
 What's trash to Mayweathers is treasures to all Nellys 
 Is y'all ready? 
 Y'all just sit on the sidelines and blog heavy 
 I really buy shit, customize shit 
 Oxblood the interior then I drives it 
 Burn it out till that new body arrives in 
 EGHCK, you know what I sell 
 Prodigy wreaked havoc since juvenile hell 
 You say you push weight, shit I challenge the scale 
 Kingpin, King Push, I just balance it well, ah 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch 
 They prayin' I don't make it 
 They treatin' me like I'm famous 
 I don't complain about the pain 
 I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
