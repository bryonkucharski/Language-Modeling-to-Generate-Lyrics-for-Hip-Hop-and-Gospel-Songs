I be chilling where it ain't safe 
 (?) got an AK 
 Everyday's is payday 
 Think I need a vacay 
 Never leave my heat home 
 I'm everywhere the streets know 
 I live by the G code 
 Bitch I think I'm Nino 
 I be chilling where it ain't safe 
 'Cause I got an AK 
 Everyday's is payday 
 Think I need a vacay 
 Never leave my heat home 
 I'm everywhere the streets know 
 I live by the G code 
 Bitch I think I'm Nino 
 I seen a AK before I seen college 
 I'm destined to shine shit, I just need polish 
 Uptown with the strap like I'm Rasheed Wallace 
 '07 did the cargos with the green Pradas 
 On my Philly shit but my city New Jack 
 Watching for ice t's was tryna move G pack 
 Soon as I step out my building, they like I need that 
 Hajis for dinner, them Chopped Cheese I still eat that 
 The roof where the D's at, crack, we call him pieces 
 Flip this, I'm hitting Great Adventure with my nieces 
 Used to the game, you niggas watching from the bleachers 
 I'm used to the pain, that's why I kill 'em every feature 
 How could I not go hard, I come from not much 
 Grams made the block rush, my grandma would watch us 
 She probably turning in her grave from all I used to do 
 I'm a changed man momma, pardon me I'm moving through 
 From Nautica jackets to Andrew Martin 
 Lights in the staircase off, ran through the dark 
 Pack in his pocket, my homie ran from the narcs 
 Live how you want but you gotta answer to God 
 Thou shall not kill, I'm sinning every beat 
 Running through Harlem, see niggas winning head to feet 
 I come from the bottom talking places you'll never see 
 Delivering product just tryna see another week 
 I'ma monster, something like the Lochness 
 Signed my deal and went from the label to the projects 
 (?) told me Fleek, kill these niggas, do it properly 
 So I'ma let the family, let the reverend, and the doctor meet 
 When G Money hit the pipe, he started slipping 
 Put Pookie in position, Nino somewhere chilling 
 Had to shut the carter down, so good the block before I park it 
 I ain't bitching, I'm just cautious now, the streets watching
