The spread of infections... germs 
 Dave East 
 Everything lit 
 Bad bitch, whole lot of smoke 
 Hundred thousand dollars worth of coke 
 Scared of being broke 
 I meet my connect on a boat 
 No time to waste, I got to go

 Bad bitch, whole lot of smoke

 Scared of being broke 
 I meet my connect on a boat 
 No time to waste, I got to go 
 Everything lit 
 Walking all alone like Denzel in Book of Eli 
 88 aura, velour sweatsuit Fila (old school!) 
 Connect answered the phone like... meet I 
 I got a couple pieces, I hope you got you a nina 
 I'm watching Selena with a bitch from Argentina 
 She just copped a Beamer, can't pass this bitch steamer 
 Only me and her can fit in it, a two seats 
 Black Rose knocking she called up like two divas 
 Now it's looking like me and three bitches 
 Fame is kind of cool but at the end I need riches 
 You set it on fire, can't mend bridges 
 I'm in the Benz just fucking with twin sisters 
 Like Tia and Tamara, I'm giving her space 
 You crowd her and don't allow her 
 Fresher than a shower, counting money by the hour 
 Kush in New York, click-off, got heavy, dour 
 Blunted watching Power

 Jadakiss 
 Bad bitches, whole lot of smoke 
 Quarter million dollars worth of dope, I'm the Hulk 
 They ain't want me in the streets to get married 
 So what we do, we ran off and we elope 
 Lose a lot of blood then you start to get sleepy 
 (?) you know what that is weekly 
 You tell me go to hell and I'ma tell you to meet me 
 The fire's right here, the desire is what completes me 
 Piff, liquor, and molly, chicks getting their roll on 
 I'm just walking round the highrise with my Robe on 
 Keep the crib warmer, used to have to leave the stove on 
 Let's get right to the money, ain't no need to prolong 
 Paper ain't right, headshots with the four long 
 Niggas fall off 'cause they don't know how to hold on 
 If them people grab you, don't ever sing shit 
 You ain't gotta light nothing up my nigga cause...

 Styles P 
 Check it from the aura to the feet 
 Probably just pulled a lick, got a drug deal to meet 
 Pull up in the six to the mix like we read 
 Got a handgun, pretty big zip full of weed from the south side 
 Hope a prayer shift to the east 
 In the zone might try to break bones of police 
 Whoever didn't eat may be feast when the beast die 
 Used to slang on (?), Jackson and Buenavista 
 Always painted a picture, none of 'em Mona Lisa 
 It's more like my tongue is the brush 
 Kiss said we gettin' money, P it comes in a rush 
 So the guns in the clutch and the car is the clutch 
 Ask myself is a mansion and foreign enough 
 Answer no cause you know you seen the yards and the cuffs 
 Got a lot but I ain't ask Allah for enough 
 So I'm searching for the balance, my niggas pull out a chalice
