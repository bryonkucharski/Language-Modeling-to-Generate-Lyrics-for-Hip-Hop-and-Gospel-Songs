Dave East 
 I welcome y'all to greatness 
 You now witnessing a legend 
 Real nigga shit 
 Uh, I've seen it all from a crackhead living room 
 Never get in tune with negative vibes 
 Look in my eyes, 27 years of pain when I glance 
 Thing in my pants, never ever came for romance 
 Finger fuckin' till my palm hurt, I came with the plan 
 The Game 
 I came with a Glock, bullets run out, niggas getting socked off top 
 We were selling dope, like we was from the rock 
 Off pot, hanging out the Cutlass letting off shots 
 Bill Clinton gettin' head, you buggin', you think I'm not 
 Dave East 
 Donald Trump ain't safe on my block, gotcha your wifey at IHOP 
 Your baby mother love that cyclops, my one-eyed monster 
 Interrogations keep comin' back, shit feel like karma 
 They add grams, now I moving with bands, ain't talking contra 
 The Game 
 Verse-y, Lord have mercy on a nigga ridin' in the Mercy 
 With some Hershey and she from Marcy 
 The brain Bosley, nigga fuckin' no Bill Cosby 
 Samsung, champagne spillin' on it beside me 
 Laced in Tom Ford, hard bottoms in the lobby 
 Dave East 
 I missed the Met Gala, eatin' linguine with the best scallops 
 Shit, I knew we was the best before I met Khaled 
 Chasin' lettuce out here lookin' for the next salad 
 I'm from the East Side of Harlem, I never stress violence 
 Checks pilin', black shades wave the Tech smilin' 
 Nautica trunks, a hundred blunts on the next island 
 The Game 
 My neck stylin', 5 karats on the angel wings 
 Aventador, Gold Daytons, it's a Compton thing 
 Don't make me switch whips, hop in the ghost like it's Halloween 
 Run up on a con spittin' ether like I am out of Queens 
 Walk up on a nigga, broad day, take him out of things 
 Leave him like Barkley, make him play the block without a ring 
 Me and Dave, Styles and Jada, heroin and gasoline 
 RIP to Yams, but we in Harlem cookin' collard greens 
 I start trippin', it's like Future when he out of lean 
 And I don't do construction but this hammer hangin' out my jeans 
 And what you rappers gon' do when you run out of memes 
 You can run on Instagram, but can't outrun the beam, nigga 
 Dave East 
 Dope in Michigan, Detroit Lions stamp 
 I run it like Barry Sanders, the Spanish Meyer Lansk' 
 Hoodlum, my alliances out in Brooklyn 
 We play steps like Crooklyn, follow the law, Tookie 
 A hundred bookies, bettin' on Golden State 
 Fiends sniffin' 8 balls as I watched his face go in that plate 
 The Game 
 What he snorting up? Cuttin' wire taps, you ain't recording us 
 Fresh pair of J's, and stilla fuck Michael Jordan up 
 Go to jail, smack CO's and tell the warden, "What?" 
 My niggas at your crib, but your daughter underwater stuck 
 Mastros, order up, Audemar, quarter tuck 
 Baltimore with the packed pockets fat as Lady Luck 
 East! 
 Dave East 
 Sour got me up in buildings like I'm Peter Parker 
 Trash bags to the ceiling, it ain't no need for talkin' 
 Keep your opinions, when I'm finished, you gon' need a coffin 
 Out in my city, cameras flashing like The Beatles walkin' 
 Knockin' Lenny Kravitz in the 550, ride by slow 
 Couple my bitches slide down poles 
 The Game 
 That Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds stadium now we at Onyx 
 I see head in my future, called that like he designer 
 Nigga called himself a thug, but we know that he vagina 
 The rap Jamal Lyon, pour heat, they call cryin' 
 I'll crush your Empire, then eat your girl cookie 
 You only good with the hooks, Hakeem, you fuckin' rookie 
 Dave East 
 Understand that ain't like nothing you ever see in your fucking life 
 Bouncer at the club from my block he let me tuck the pipe 
 You having a problems with your spouse, 'cause you ain't fuck her right 
 I'm probably somewhere shopping for a house to keep my comfort right 
 Lennox Ave to Rosecrans, First to Cedar Block 
 Fiends was up early so I was the first to see the block 
 The Game 
 East meets West my nigga 
 They say Compton is just like Harlem, I know that's right 
 Soon as I land in JFK man, had a fucking 
 Had a fucker' Uber take me to motherfuckin' mid-town man 
 Pick up my fuckin' Lambo 
 Then I am heading to Harlem 145 in Lenox 
 That's where I play, Game nigga 
 Pull the Lambo in that Amy Ruth's, they know me in there 
 Gimme that corner table in the back 
 Let me get that fried chicken 
 That cornbread come out first, smokin' 
 Real nigga shit, Compton
