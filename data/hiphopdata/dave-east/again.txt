Fuck your bitch, and never talk again 
 If he don't die 
 He'll never walk again, he'll never walk again 
 I got my focus up 
 I got my paper straight, I got my paper straight 
 The whole club turn around when I'm walking in 
 Fuck your bitch, and never talk again (Harlem) 
 Niggas talkin', they ain't making sense 
 Brand new foreign, bet it make 'em sick 
 Ain't gotta say a word, just to take your bitch 
 I'm from Harlem, hustlin' will make me rich (east side) 
 A hundred nights, I made a hundred flips 
 Hit the club, and all the bitches wanna strip 
 Put some money on your head, if you wanna diss 
 She suck my dick, and then she wanna kiss 
 Must be out your mind, or on some shit (crazy) 
 Sak's fifth, got me on my shit 
 Niggas hatin' on me, they be on my dick 
 Took a couple verses just to flood the wrist 
 R.I.P. my cousin Freaky 
 Niggas took him from me 
 I just want the money 
 Never taking nothing from me 
 Niggas in they feelings, probably on they monthly 
 I was in the trap with cocaina and some baggies 
 Probably with some junkies 
 Now I chill across the water, do it for my daughter 
 Dare a nigga touch me 
 I done seen a nigga get a 1 to 3, and tell on everybody with him 
 I done seen a nigga robbing niggas that he know for pennies 
 Shit ridiculous 
 Niggas love to say they will do your homework on them niggas giving statements 
 I'm smoking cubans on vacation 
 My plug in Cuba but he Haitian 
 Sak pase, I need a spot today 
 Nigga with a attitude, I ain't Dr. Dre 
 My youngin' got a lot to make your heart stop today 
 Think of Chinx when I'm in Far Rockaway 
 Fuck your bitch, and never talk again 
 If he don't die, he'll never walk again 
 I got my focus up, I got my paper straight 
 The whole club turn around when I'm walking in 
 Pay my lawyer just in case they wanna pin the case up on me 
 And they offer 10 
 Valet driver going start the whip 
 Get your money, they just talking shit 
 Fuck your bitch, and never talk again 
 If he don't die, he'll never walk again 
 I got my focus up, I got my paper straight 
 The whole club turn around when I'm walking in 
 Pay my lawyer just in case they wanna pin the case up on me 
 And they offer 10 
 Valet driver going start the whip 
 Get your money, they just talking shit 
 I got a pound of the tree smoke 
 Break it down to the ground, only thing I ever follow is the G-code 
 Niggas brand new cars getting repo'd 
 Same ones acting tough getting Deebo'd 
 Ask your man about my shit, bet you he know 
 Hottest young nigga on the east coast 
 Sliding up Lennox, me and three niggas 
 Looking like gutter, me and G-Money he ain't even know 
 Got a Glock-19 in my peacoat 
 My building keep complaining about the weed smoke 
 I'm tryna make a million off a mixtape 
 Stash in the whip where the heat go 
 Bad little bitch tryna deep throat 
 I told her ain't no way you fitting all this 
 This ain't sour D, what you call this? 
 This ain't Actavis, what you call this? 
 The spot look funny? Make a call quick 
 If she on my dick then we all hit 
 Out of town on my running through the mall shit 
 And I ain't get you in the summer, put you on my fall list 
 Mid town pent house like a fortress 
 Every time they see my face they get nauseous 
 Down town condo, shit flawless 
 They ain't coming in the crib, they ain't gorgeous 
 Fuck your bitch, and never talk again 
 If he don't die, he'll never walk again 
 I got my focus up, I got my paper straight 
 The whole club turn around when I'm walking in 
 Pay my lawyer just in case they wanna pin the case up on me 
 And they offer 10 
 Valet driver going start the whip 
 Get your money, they just talking shit 
 Fuck your bitch, and never talk again 
 If he don't die, he'll never walk again 
 I got my focus up, I got my paper straight 
 The whole club turn around when I'm walking in 
 Pay my lawyer just in case they wanna pin the case up on me

 Valet driver going start the whip 
 Get your money, they just talking shit 
 Get your money they just talking shit
