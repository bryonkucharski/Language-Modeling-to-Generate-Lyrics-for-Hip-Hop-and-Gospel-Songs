Trey beat it Suave bitch Dave East 
 Beg your pardon, I ain't at the garden 
 I'm a Harlem nigga, I'm at Dyckman 
 My favorite shooter had to switch states, tryna stay low from indictments 
 I been the same nigga since diapers 
 Same nigga with no license 
 Same nigga caught the train nigga 
 Now I'm gettin' brain from your wifey 
 You need a pass just to come 'round 
 I need that Rolly face bust down 
 Tryna chill 'cause it's Ramadan but I kill these niggas when that sun down 
 I ain't cooling less gun round 
 You can lose your life over one pound 
 Take my time in the trap stressing 
 I'm baggin up in a rush now 
 Fuck what you thought, this not L.A 
 So we ain't driving by, we gon' pull up and park 
 Catch you at the light, make it get dark 
 In the night when bitches taking it off 
 I'm just tryna get my cake up, my bitch bad with no makeup 
 Gunning for ya, got a hungry lawyer 
 Go up in the court and shoot a case up 
 Bully probably pull a Wraith up, I been thinking bout that ghost shit 
 I'm retarded when it comes to cops, on my momma I don't know shit 
 On my momma I done sold nicks 
 Not a liar, never sold bricks 
 If they raid the crib nigga, don't snitch 
 Everybody get it, I got no picks 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Pray to God they don't take me 
 Rolex or a A.P 
 226 with no safety 
 Get some work, hit the road 
 We was hustling in the cold 
 Feel it when it hit your nose 
 Waking up with different hoes 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Pray to God they don't take me 
 Rolex or a A.P 
 226 with no safety 
 Get some work, hit the road 
 We was hustling in the Cove 
 Feel it when it hit your nose 
 Waking up with different hoes 
 Trey pound, that's a KD 
 I ain't showing up if they don't pay me 
 Been nice since skate key, these bitches on to me lately 
 Telling me that I look good, telling me that I smell nice 
 This YSL PLUS SOUR D, still on my moms for that bail price 
 Play ball and I played the trap 
 I can tell you what them scales like 
 Had a celly with a bunk bed, I can tell you what them jails like 
 Cop shit before we hit the streets, you still waiting for that sell price 
 Stepped on and get dismissed 
 We like big fish, talking whale type 
 45 that's a come back, east river where they dump that 
 Bed breakfast on Lenox Ave 
 Got a flight to Vegas, where lunch at 
 My youngin got it, he can pump that 
 My homie hit it, I don't want that 
 Hate a bitch that never got here own 
 Always asking niggas where the blunts at 
 33 that's a Scot Pip 
 Foreign bitch up in the drop six 
 Thinking when I couldn't cop shit 
 I would trap in Queens, Fetty Wap shit 
 Rockstar need a moshpit 
 Live a thug life on some Pac shit 
 Fly nigga need a cockpit 
 You ain't fucking with me, you can watch this 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Pray to God they don't take me 
 Rolex or a A.P 
 226 with no safety 
 Get some work, hit the road 
 We was hustling in the Cove 
 Feel it when it hit your nose 
 Waking up with different hoes 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Pray to God they don't take me 
 Rolex or a A.P 
 226 with no safety 
 Get some work, hit the road 
 We was hustling in the Cove 
 Feel it when it hit your nose 
 Waking up with different hoes 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD 
 Trey pounds, that's a KD
