I'm walking through Harlem like I'm Richard Porter 
 If your wifey ain't feeling me, I could get your daughter 
 My cousin sold dust he said he tryna get some water 
 Fish scale on my side of town is what niggas order 
 Felt like orphans in school, them teachers didn't want us 
 We hit them corners, that's the reason that the precinct on us 
 For the pound block, dancing like Bobby Brown 
 Put a bomb in your building, I'm shutting your lobby down 
 They be talking that tough shit the Hudson probably found 
 Floating with fishes, family bitching, they not around 
 Pull up not hitting switches, this Harlem don't come around 
 Used to rock the Pradaaaa 
 Hop out like a rasta like I just was watching Shottas 
 Kicked out of school, I had a razor in my locker 
 Felt like Bishop, I'm the one y'all need to worry bout, parther 
 Different type of ora, I'ma need a lawyer 
 Momma cooking GOYA before Sapp was a Hoyer 
 I got some head from Toya, I was busy, couldn't call ya 
 Me and Mac at the butter spot, your bitch said she she love the cock 
 I'm always on first 'cause I love the block 
 My little nigga said he never fighting, he love his Glock 
 We savages, a blood spill is nothing, we love the mop 
 Figured I would trap until I really made it 
 Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted 
 Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted 
 They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it 
 Figured I would trap until I really made it 
 Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted 
 Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted 
 They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it 
 In the kitchen with some grams, I was listening to Cam 
 Sending pictures of my fam to my niggas in the can 
 Was pitching and I scammed, visions of some land 
 Whipping in the pan had you feeling like the man 
 Illest on the coast, you ain't living if you broke 
 I know about coke droughts, niggas selling soap 
 I know about the shower being cold for like three days 
 Boiling water to clean my body before a cheap date 
 Knowing I'm just tryna fuck, addicted to designer stuff 
 Still got marks on my wrists, been in all kind of cuffs 
 Xanax, mushrooms, kush, I sold all kind of stuff 
 Own family tried to rob me, I don't got no kind of trust 
 The way that I think, no time for waiting 
 You either broke or jealous if you ever got time for hating 
 I'm from the city move fast, ain't got no kind of patience 
 Obama tried to change it, we still in the projects waiting 
 We waiting 
 Figured I would trap until I really made it 
 Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted 
 Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted 
 They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it 
 Figured I would trap until I really made it 
 Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted 
 Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted 
 They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it
