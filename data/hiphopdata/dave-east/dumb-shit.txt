I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 I'm with the dumb shit 
 I be with the shits, popped a percocet now my body itch 
 Hit the lobby quick, pitch it in the open get what I can get 
 Task force, DTs, gang units, tell 'em suck a dick 
 They ain't got a check, I ain't showing up 
 I think I'm the shit, couple yellow mix, pineapple Fanta work 
 Your man got a job, catch your man at work 
 My youngin get hyped off his hammer work 
 You think you religious get jammed at church 
 God blessin' all the trap niggas 
 I be in the trap, I don't know too many rap niggas 
 Playing dummy got me like a mummy, we can rap niggas 
 My youngins starting arguments just to clap niggas 
 My man down south on this swipe shit 
 Running up in Macy's with a white bitch 
 She got a coke habit, love the white sniff 
 Todd showed me how to cook it up with my right wrist 
 Arm and Hammer baking soda in my left wrist 
 Thinking that you taking this, that's a death wish 
 We in sacks, I ain't asking what the price is 
 Blue and whites right behind me, take the exit 
 Slow down 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 I'm with the dumb shit 
 I'm with the dumb shit 
 Trapping and rapping I'm still out here hustlin' 
 Might have not been on the freshmen cover 
 But I got some caddies and they love me 
 Bag it up and burn the tip 
 In the truck, I got your bitch, yes she think I'm rich 
 I ain't talking Porter, pull up in a foreign 
 Probably with your daughter, older nigga sick 
 I don't care 'bout you used to get it 
 You can use to have her shit, I used to hit it 
 Only want it if my crew can get it 
 I been to committed, copped a new extended 
 So this ammo ain't never gon' run out 
 Xanny inside me, I dumb out 
 I'm the one they talk about when I come out 
 Fresh up out the studio to the drunk house 
 If I'm pitching hitters all in the dugout 
 I ain't tryna hit it 'cause I already dug out 
 Knew he in the spot I'ma get him when he come out 
 My bitch got the drop, run up on him with a tongue out 
 Licking her lips, now she got him ready to trick 
 Take her out on trips, told her meet her on the strip 
 Niggas hopped up out a whip, hit that nigga with some shit 
 Thanks baby 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 I'm with the dumb shit 
 I need my money now 
 I can feel it in my stomach now 
 Beamer on it, no need to run him down 
 Ain't 'bout no money, don't come around 
 I need my money now 
 I can feel it in my stomach now 
 Beamer on it, no need to run him down 
 Ain't 'bout no money, don't come around 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money 
 I'm with the dumb shit
