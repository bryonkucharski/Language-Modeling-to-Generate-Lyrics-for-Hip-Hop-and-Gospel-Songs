I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe it 
 Real life though 
 I cannot 
 I cannot believe it 
 Eyes open 
 She from Jamaica, Queens, only came to Harlem to shop 
 Her mother just got a divorce and her father a cop 
 I learned this about 10 minutes in the conversation 
 I'm thinking I don't even know you, why that information? 
 My head was racin', I'm pacin' back and forth 
 Asked her for her number, her name Keisha, nice to meet ya 
 She said she never fucked with nobody from Harlem 
 I've got homies from south side, I figured I would call them 
 I found exact locations and where she grew up 
 Her moms new boyfriend got some coke, then he blew up 
 She used to play with credit cards and line niggas at night clubs 
 Fucked a couple niggas but left 'em 'cause she ain't like love 
 I was down in Flight Club, Keisha text me like "What you doing?" 
 "I scuffed up my retro's, I'm bout to cop some new ones" 
 She said she at the Mandarin Oriental in Columbus circle 
 She got some sour but she wanted purple 
 I told her later we can link up 
 I called my youngin Conner bring an eighth to her 
 He plotting on taking her 
 Funny lil' nigga, but fuck it, that's how we raised 
 If it ain't wifey than all the homies can play 
 Back to Keisha, she black but had them Spanish features 
 Five seven, most these niggas would plan to keep her 
 I got that drop from my homie that knew her, he went to school with her 
 Said he used to be cool with her, but he ain't fuck her though 
 Con' callin' me, I forgot to text him the address 
 I'm going through some other shit, honestly got me mad stressed 
 If Con' delivered that, we 'bout to meet 
 I gotta a club tonight, told Keisha if she up I hit her when it's over 
 Now it's rosé, henny, rosé, henny 
 Strippers all over me, I ain't throwing a penny 
 Got a text from Keisha, "I'm in room 17C 
 I know you're with your homies now but later come and see me" 
 I'm rollied out, sky dweller, the light hittin' it right 
 I'm hearing niggas talking like, "That's Dave East, that nigga nice" 
 Wayno told me 30 minutes, flat line, backwoods I pack mine 
 Unless I want 'em harsher, please don't no one bother 
 I called my driver and told him take me to midtown 
 Had to stop for condoms cause raw ain't the way I get down 
 He dropped me off, I told him "Park it and don't leave yet 
 Let me see what this bitch about, something I gotta figure out" 
 I'm in the 'tele, I hit the elevator blunted 
 Stumbling, just hennessey and rosé in my stomach 
 Figure we fuckin' and then order some room service 
 I knocked twice, she opened the door but so nervous 
 Maybe I was buggin, I was drunk, she was ready though 
 Came up out of everything, R. Kelly on the radio 
 Slim waist, Hershey chocolate skin, ass heavy though 
 On everything, I fucked this bitch delirious, shit Eddie know 
 Henny taking over, we passed out, at least I did 
 15,000 in my balmain's, I'm lackin' 
 I put my rollie in the dresser with like four chains 
 My id and my bank cards, iPhone 6 to make calls 
 Condom box of 3-pack, I used two of them 
 Brand new Fendi sneakers, the club just ruined 'em 
 Something told me wake up, I checked the bed 
 Nothin' but pillows and cover, I had to shake my head 
 I checked me jeans, every dollar gone, that's 15k 
 All my chains and my rollie missing 
 I put my shit on, looking for my phone, that shit was gone too 
 I'm ready to kill Keisha, what the fuck I'm gon' do? 
 I told myself I wasn't drinking, why the fuck I get bent? 
 And how the fuck I get robbed? 
 I ran out, my driver sleep I woke him up like "You ain't see that bitch 
 Brown skin, thick, probably moving on some schemin' shit?" 
 He telling me that he was sleeping, waiting on my phone call 
 I cannot believe this shit, can't wait until I see this bitch 
 This for every nigga that be slippin' 'cause he think he rich 
 Keisha you a sneaky bitch, called shooter I'ma need the grip 
 Fuck 
 I cannot believe this bitch robbed me 
 I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe this bitch robbed me 
 If I catch her I ain't tryna hear I'm sorry 
 I cannot believe this bitch robbed me 
 I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe this bitch robbed me 
 If I catch her I ain't tryna hear I'm sorry 
 I cannot believe this bitch robbed me 
 I cannot believe it 
 I cannot believe it 
 Fuck
