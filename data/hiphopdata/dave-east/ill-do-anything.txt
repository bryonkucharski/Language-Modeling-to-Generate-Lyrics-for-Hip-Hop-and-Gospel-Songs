I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 Just to see him walk the streets again 
 Just to see him hit the weed again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again

 Malik Carter, my cousin could never bother 
 I remember smoking, him telling me 'bout his father 
 I remember talking about bitches that we could party 
 Freaky did Bicardi, I was lit up a Marley 
 He was nice in ball, talked shit, had a job and hustled too 
 Me, him, and lil was stuck, we ain't know what the fuck to do 
 Y'all was playing Madden, betting everything 
 Chipotle after hooping, we were smoking even regular green 
 Two elevens waking up, Delhi and Dauphin Street 
 Auntie always show me love, if she cooking, we all could eat 
 You love to rock Polo, never nervous to bag a bitch 
 Smoking on your black and mild, I would hate it, be mad as shit 
 I was rocking your shirt the night that lil crashed the rental 
 Took a trip to North Philly, shit'll really fuck your mental 
 Them niggas tried to rob you, caught a graze and came to B-More 
 You slept right on my couch, and to my crib you had a key dog 
 I miss you nigga, I hear your voice when I be all alone 
 Still got your number in my jack, I wanna call your phone 
 You tatted on my hands so when they meeting me, they meeting you 
 Fell in love with the streets not knowing what the evil do 
 And to really tell the truth, Freaky I needed you 
 And I ain't scared to die no more, if I go then I'll be with you 
 And to really tell the truth, Freaky I needed you 
 And I ain't scared to die no more, if I go then I'll be with you 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 Just to see him walk the streets again 
 Just to see him hit the weed again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again

 I'll do anything to see my nigga home 
 Shit is gettin' crazy fuck is goin' on? 
 Niggas killing niggas, we don't never run 
 Live by the gun, die by the gun 
 Never thought my nigga'd be gone 
 Heaven don't seem so bad 
 Fuck them niggas, we gotta be strong 
 Coming for everything we never had

 I'd do anything to see my cousin, nigga 
 'Cause when he said he loved a nigga, he really loved a nigga 
 He ain't dapped me when he seen me, he would hug me nigga 
 I ain't making up nothing, we was really out hustling nigga 
 You introduced me to Jonesy, that's like my brother 
 Miss Michelle, I love her, I treat her just like my mother 
 Lil going through it, I told him you up above us 
 Nut come up top just to check me, you gotta love him 
 Always seen you smile and never mad much 
 We was happy just being together, we ain't had much 
 You ain't get the chance to have a kid 
 You ain't get the chance to cop a Benz 
 We ain't get a chance to pop the twins 
 We was going to temples parties, perk 30s in us 
 I ain't questionin' the Lord, they say His work is never finished 
 I just don't understand, I know you was just minding your business 
 They caught my nigga slipping, my life done became so different 
 I miss him 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 Just to see him walk the streets again 
 Just to see him hit the weed again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again 
 I got a angel, I don't need a friend 
 I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
