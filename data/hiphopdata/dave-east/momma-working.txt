Everything in the bag nigga, everything man 
 Bag all this shit up 
 My moms coming home at like 11 B, we gotta get the fuck up out of here 
 We can't be here when moms come in the crib, my nigga. Word 
 Yo, this shit depressing, 3 to 6 for Smith and Wesson 
 On Ryker's Island 
 Them hoes was telling get their best friends, they need protection 
 I seen the D's, they played the roof out 
 It's time to move out, the block hot, don't bring the Coop out 
 I'm in the new shit, Balenciaga and a blue fit 
 We throwing parties, these bitches swimming got the pool lit 
 I bagged up eight balls over green, no need for pool sticks 
 I'm sick of Chinese, close up shop, let's head to Ruth's Chris 
 Connect Jamaican, I'm the reason for that last breath you taking 
 And fuck this paper, we throw it like we just graduated 
 Started in a Pathfinder, then I had to navigate it 
 We ain't had much, my uncle said "Use your imagination" 
 Took it and ran with it, pieces out the pot let the fan hit it 
 Sit 'em on the plate and get the gram chipping 
 I ain't feeling these niggas, it's like my hand's missing 
 My man's switching but fuck it, I guess we ran different 
 Hand to hand pitching, Deegan or we Van Wyck'in 
 West side of FDR, never bag, I rarely borrow 
 Thoughts of running up in houses like the mask of Zoro 
 I had to go pick up some paper, I'll be back tomorrow 
 Bagging up, knocking the purple tape 
 Outside all night, my moms was working late 
 I gotta go get it because it hurt to wait 
 I don't talk about much, some shit it hurt to say 
 Bagging up, knocking the purple tape 
 Outside all night, my moms was working late 
 I gotta go get it because it hurt to wait 
 I don't talk about much, some shit it hurt to say 
 I paid 50 for the smoke pack, 40 for that brown bitch 
 I'm bout to make the town flip, I'm always where they smoke at 
 Three dykes drinking in a school zone, a couple hammers 
 Young dirty ghetto children, we ain't had no fuckin' manners 
 I love my grandma, that's my mother twin 
 Couldn't shit for days, eating that cheese from the government 
 Talk clear round here papi, no time for stuttering 
 Fiends like I just can not believe it's not buttering 
 Stuttering, went back to basics 
 Xannies had me trapped in the matrix 
 When my mother told me you have to make it just for brother's sake 
 If you sell crack, what you think he goin' sell 
 If you go to jail, where you think he goin', focus up 
 Still bagging burner tips, pull-up bar, work the dips 
 I had to work the bench before I got my starting spot 
 Straight out of Harlem like Suge Knight for that parking spot 
 Knocking Biggie, wish I could talk to Pac, get off the block 
 Bagging up, knocking the purple tape 
 Outside all night, my moms was working late 
 I gotta go get it because it hurt to wait 
 I don't talk about much, some shit it hurt to say 
 Bagging up, knocking the purple tape 
 Outside all night, my moms was working late 
 I gotta go get it because it hurt to wait 
 I don't talk about much, some shit it hurt to say
