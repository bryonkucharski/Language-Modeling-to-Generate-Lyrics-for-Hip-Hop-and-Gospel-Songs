I never follow orders put that on my daughter 
 Back and forth to Florida hide the coke in goya 
 Pistol on my dresser bitch I'm from the border 
 Reef Buck my brother, Big Bay my brother 
 Really know I got 'em, Druggy know I really love 'em 
 All this forever love, mix around the headshot 
 This Crip I was never Blood, I'm just speaking facts 
 Papi told me work knowing that I'ma bring it back 
 Codeine gives me cold sweats 
 I had to tell my pops that he ain't old yet 
 Percocets get in me, I got no stress 
 Dancing with the devil bitch I'm Milly Rocking 
 Freaky down in Philly its crazy now I got Philly rocking 
 My youngin' trapping in Brooklyn, that nigga stealing Thompkins 
 Ponzi scheming like them Wall Street crackers that got it 
 Immaculate profits that mean that paper God bless 
 I talked to Scrappy just knowing he walk the yard stressed 
 Them park sets had my back bigger 
 Know that you a target, you a black nigga 
 Used to homicide so we react quicker 
 We ain't have a dollar on us but we had liquor 
 Drunk in the projects that was me, go ask niggas 
 Never seen a million but I've seen a body 
 You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby 
 Mafia thoughts, wish I could speak to Gotti 
 Stash tucked from my daughter in case them people found me 
 Never seen a million but I've seen a body 
 You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby 
 You got the key to the city? Well shit I need a copy 
 Rap slow, half Spanish, I could go speak to Papi 
 I hid my pistol in my sock drawer 
 Everybody hard, we had the hard and you could cop soft 
 For some reason I don't feel nothing when they knock a cop off 
 You ain't the only one getting money I got these drop offs 
 Just thinking back to when I hardly was out 
 And Baltimore you got it cheap so we target the South 
 Had dime bags on me walking past LaGuardia Houses 
 They killed my cousin fuck we talking about? Forever beef 
 Ain't no truce here 
 My aunt used to tell me why she ain't move there 
 Every year the same in the projects like what is New Years? 
 Drano came home, same nigga they gave him two years 
 Crazy or forever, always keep a pair of blue Air's 
 That first night in prison is the worst 
 Made it worse was coming home and seeing my niggas on the a shirt 
 Had to get it out the mud, I got respect for the dirt 
 Thinking how newer fiends would get their checks on the 1st 
 Sixty thousand in diamonds they like, "His neck gotta hurt" 
 Know my paps did dirt for that in life I'm probably cursed 
 Me and my daughter mother realized it never worked 
 I got sick of the same jeans, I just wanted a better shirt 
 Wanted some better shoes, can't tell me I never worked 
 Never seen a million but I've seen a body 
 You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby 
 Mafia thoughts, wish I could speak to Gotti 
 Stash tucked from my daughter in case them people found me 
 Never seen a million but I've seen a body 
 You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby 
 You got the key to the city? Well shit I need a copy 
 Rap slow, half Spanish, I could go speak to Papi
