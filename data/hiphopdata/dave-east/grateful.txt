 Two of the closest niggas there for me 
 They no longer here with me 
 I'm wide awake, I'm scared to sleep 
 Afraid, though I ain't never been, Grandma said ain't no fear in me 
 Criminal, I prepared to be, in your feelings? Won't hear from me 
 I talk to God, the devil on the other line stressin' 
 Keep a weapon there, 'cause slippin' ain't how I'm gon' learn no lesson 
 Ain't no actors here, I told Bully, "I wish that Stack was here" 
 Mugga too, my hoody blue, so much ice, they gon' have to stare 
 Used to hate my building smell, half for the homies still in jail 
 Harlem different, either kill a cell or pray to lift your bail 
 White rice and tuna fish, way before Ruth Chris 
 We was broke, I ain't care who was rich, stick up kids do exist 
 Hard news, just listen, the dog food was clickin' 
 They moved bitch, long before I heard of Ludacris 
 I watched it with my own eyes, dirty kitchen for home fries 
 Hajji's if ain't nothin' open, just make sure they toast mine 
 I'm thankful for them steak and cheese, I love the hood, I'd hate to leave 
 How the fuck was we trappin' outside when it was eight degrees? 
 I still have a hard time tryna understand why Ma$e would leave 
 Gave niggas the reason, plus the truth, I could relate to Beans 
 Free Meek, I'm just tryna chase a dream 
 They'd rather us upstate and grainy, you never had to chase a fiend 
 Passed them off the 'Gram, and then they ran before they paid you 
 Plus you gotta pay yo' connect and at your crib, it ain't no cable 
 You can't watch your favorite TV show, your jacket and your sneakers old 
 Summertime, you make it through, but you ain't tryna see the cold 
 Niggas turn to strippers when they see the pole 
 Plant the seed, the seed'll grow, my daughter need three million 'fore she three years old 
 Marsha Ambrosius & 
 Dave East 
 Loyalty and love over everything 
 Flowers over stones and the choir sings 
 How many of them do we know though? 
 Lost so many loved ones and now they're gone 
 Gone too soon, streets raising kings 
 And queens, we gotta fight to believe again 
 Still loyalty and love over everything 
 Still flowers over stones and the choir sings 
 Thank you, I'm grateful 
 And the choir sings 
 Thank you Lord, I'm grateful 
 Ooh, thank you Lord, I'm grateful 
 (just thankful to be here been through a lot) 
 Thank you, I'm grateful 
 Dave East 
 Uh, every time it rain, I feel that bullet 
 Hood insane, wish I could change it, but I couldn't 
 I'm just grateful for them whoopings 
 My pops used to give us to keep us out the street 
 In the projects, the water cold at least three days out the week 
 This real talk, I done seen some shit wake you out your sleep 
 Lit the crib up with candles, felt like the lights was out for weeks 
 I ain't had the drive, wanted to survive until I found the keys 
 220 on the dash and yes, we taxin', we got mouths to feed 
 Thank you Lord, I'm grateful Lord, if I got it, I blame you Lord 
 My life, it been dangerous Lord 
 My faith in you could change it Lord 
 Wasn't tryna scare niggas, foreheads was what we was aimin' for 
 I lived on the 6, they raid the crib, might have to change the door 
 Let's figure out a way to make 'em hate some more 
 Fuck the way the system set up, every day I break the law 
 Spend some money, make some more, never thought I'd make it poor 
 Imagine we was takin' score, militant, I relate to war 
 Thankful for my only child 
 Sellin' out these shows that make my homies smile 
 Wake up in Miami to hear the ocean sound 
 Grateful I seen 18, grateful I seen 21 
 Grateful that my pops ain't throw me out, he found my nigga gun 
 Of course I said it wasn't mine 
 Runnin' to the park told my father, let's talk another time 
 'Cause he know I want to rhyme 
 A .38, I kept it on me, I blow it like a runny nose 
 In the projects with like three bitches to diddy crib with like a hundred hoes 
 Stomach growlin', I don't take it for granted 
 I come from housin' (projects), I need some shit come with a water fountain 
 My daughter smilin', I'm thankful Freaky told me to rap 
 Thankful Jungle paid attention, the streets could never hold me back
