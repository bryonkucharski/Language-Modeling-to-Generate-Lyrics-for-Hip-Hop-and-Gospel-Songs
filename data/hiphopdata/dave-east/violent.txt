 You funny, ' 
 Suave.' 
 You real ' 
 funny 
 Rico, I was waitin' on some hard shit, nigga (same ol' nigga) 
 You know how we do, uh, uh (same ol' nigga) 
 Talked to God about this, uh (most relatable, most gutta) 
 All this shit I did, now they supposed to hate (they supposed to) 
 I can't even count the diamonds in the Rollie face (I can't) 
 Supreme clientele, I feel like Ghost and Rae (uh) 
 I just did a weekend for no license, need to smoke an eight (light up) 
 Pieces of my sock, hope I get up the block (I hope) 
 Homie, if you know you not no shooter, just give up the Glock (stop that) 
 I don't want no pussy bull, I'm tired, just give up some top (please) 
 Jumpin' out, fresh beef and brocks, hit the reefa spot 
 Cleaner than my second bath in life 
 Shit, my man got life, shot a nigga right on Second Ave 
 Right in front his wife, what's the price? (Uh) 
 Time to get the cash, necklace full of ice (time) 
 I'm chillin', Xannies made a killin' (blues) 
 My white boy created and app and made a million 
 I own half, stop sippin' lean and took a cold bath (cold bath) 
 Seen fiends stone grab since firm did phone tap (uh) 
 Nas jumped on Forbes list, then I watched my life change (I did) 
 Off the bucket list of my life, I wanted a white Range (all my life) 
 White Kings, spikin' fluent drunkies, do the right thing 
 Courtside next to Spike, it's so funny how my life changed (Spike, what up) 
 Fear of God collection, told Jerry I need that new shit (I do) 
 Label get to frontin', I pull up on some Ice Cube shit (uh) 
 Harlem niggas been gettin' money, this ain't no new shit (stones) 
 Stop actin' like you gon' do somethin', you ain't gon' do shit (nothin') 
 How I'm gettin' they mouth hard, hard to figure out like the Rubix 
 8 ball full of diamonds, plus a fully loaded pool stick (loaded) 
 Watch how you talk to me, anythin' makes my mood switch 
 My life is a gamble, good with the Desert, feel like a camel (I'm good) 
 I looked up to Tony Montana, Tony Soprano (uh) 
 Them niggas ain't gon' ride if you die, they only get candles 
 Somebody gotta get violent, only way they understand you 
 My life is a gamble, good with the Desert, feel like a camel (I'm good) 
 I looked up to Tony Montana, Tony Soprano (Tony) 
 I can't even count all the bitches my niggas ran through 
 Somebody gotta get violent, only way they understand you 
 Lloyd Banks 
 Skippin' through hundreds, check out my handle 
 Get in the way of all these squares, shipped circles burnin' your flannel 
 Chronic zip tucked into my chucka, duckin' the Van crew 
 Visualize a life on the podium, need the Lamb' blue 
 Quick to hand your name in for murder they get the chance to 
 You from O.T. then be careful, the streets'll make an example 
 Wish me on 'cause I been eatin' more, rest in peace to the restaurant 
 Have you feelin' like the hood closin' in on you, you need extra arms 
 Came up bein' competitive, now it feels like the effort's gone 
 You should know I got a star in the ghetto, watch what you steppin' on 
 Rocks to light me up, 18 years old last time my neck been warm 
 You a enemy don't type me, I prolly' got a Tec message for him 
 Voltage high for play two side niggas, better respect the fences 
 Talking like a gangster, can't even cover your death expenses 
 Pushin' like it started all over again, that's what excellence is 
 Killin' shit's an extra sentence, leave here with the rest incentive 
 Holdin' up the neighborhood, knowin' the Hall of Fame is waitin' 
 Fuck your thoughts, I worked hard to get it under my favorite bracelet 
 Could have been in the race but you fallin', that ball and chain arrangement 
 Niggas do anything to shine, runnin' out of amazement 
 Mindin' your business now is key, don't wind down in between the problem 
 I'm from the city always hungry, Queens to Harlem people starvin' 
 No block and you put the work in, get 'em in line and keep evolvin' 
 Put in position it's gon' speak for itself when my CD talkin'
