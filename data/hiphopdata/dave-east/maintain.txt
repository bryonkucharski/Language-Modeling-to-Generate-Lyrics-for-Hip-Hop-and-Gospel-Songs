 Young nigga growin' up, now I just wear plain jane 
 Them niggas ain't built like us, them niggas lame, lame (bitch!) 
 Money keep calling my line, just tell 'em the same thing (brrr) 
 Only break bread with my niggas, huh, gang gang 
 Do it for the block young nigga, for the block young nigga, gang gang 
 I was just focused, I was tryna get it, I was tryna maintain 
 These niggas bogus, they be gettin' over, they be playin' fame games 
 I still feel the same pain 
 Bino Rideaux 
 I hop in that coupe and I can't hear the motor, I can't feel the lane change 
 What happened to real niggas come first, explain things 
 I'm tryna keep consistent with the shit they tell me that the fame change 
 Niggas was with me, they be feelin' different 'bout this shit 'til change came 
 Find me a bitch that never really been nowhere and take her way, way 
 Ain't got no time for nothin' when you live life around the bank, Chase 
 Can't take these bitches too serious, these bitches just play, pay 
 Young nigga made me, count up the day to day

 I still feel the same thing 
 We can't leave no witness, I don't want to hit it, I just want some brain brain 
 Niggas keep talkin' 'bout they gettin' money, them niggas is lame, lame 
 Before all these foreigns I wasn't important was hoppin' the train, train 
 Where I'm from you either slang 'caine, play a sport or go and gang bang 
 I did all three, I came right out of jail, then that's when my lane changed 
 I got this guap, it's fallin' out my pockets, you try me and I blew the same thing 
 Already bust the Patek down, it's time to go pick up the plain jane 
 I be in hoods where you can't hang, throw up my hood, nigga gang gang
