 Shorty was feeling me from the gate 
 All about my money and violence, feeling like rafe 
 I just won a few million, filling the safe 
 Hard to catch feeling if I ain't feeling your face 
 I be in the projects watching out how the game switch 
 All my youngins 'cane pitch, I just wanna vanquish 
 Pick you up around seven, just have your bag ready 
 Skin soft, lift her she light but damn that ass heavy 
 She chose me and I ain't even have to say much 
 She like it when I don't gotta cut, ain't get no shape up 
 Now she got a trainer, just tryna make sure her shape up 
 Hate it when I hit it and leave, she wanna lay up 
 She the only one I'm texting when I'm drunk 
 Take the Lexus to the trump, we naked rolling blunts 
 Soon as I got her a squad hatin' 
 She don't know if it ain't about no liquor I'm not chasing

 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave 
 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave 
 And I don't know what to tell you nigga 
 She was choosing when she walked passed 
 (?) tell you nigga 
 That you really need to fall back 
 Yeah I know that you love that girl, you want that girl 
 But it's she chose me 
 You can't love these girls 
 Sorry you gotta learn that from me 
 And I really can't say that I'm sorry 
 (?) 
 We ain't get here by mistake (?) 
 (?) too late (?) 
 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave 
 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave

 I was thinking Cancun, few trucks without the top 
 Sand in my shorts, feet out without the socks 
 Crystal clear water, no more order from cops 
 On a world tour just screaming (?) block 
 Keep it realer than most, that's if she want it or not 
 Before I had a key to the crib, she left it unlocked 
 Chanel what she into 
 Look her in her eyes, I can tell what you been through 
 She deserve a Benz Coop 
 She saw me from across the room 
 I be at the main event spots where it be hard to move 
 I make it look easy, doing shit that's hard to do 
 Coming from the bottom, I be high enough to walk the moon 
 She my little sweet thang, I just want a taste 
 Used to doing bottles but tonight I want a case 
 Bag a couple models, that's just how I start my day 
 I don't mean to be rude, your shorty looking this way

 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave 
 I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me 
 What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave
