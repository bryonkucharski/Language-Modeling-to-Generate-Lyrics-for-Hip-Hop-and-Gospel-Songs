 Shorty brought her friend with her 
 Knowing me, I would've been hit her 
 Blowing in the wind with her 
 This money I could spend with her 
 Said she brought her friend with her 
 Knowing me, I could've been hit it 
 Blowing in the wind with her

 She telling me she got a friend 
 The club already packed but we just got 'em in 
 Everything on me tonight so she ain't gotta spend 
 When you come up from the bottom, all you wanna do is win 
 Jumping out some foreign shit, she got her best friend with her 
 Met her in the club a month ago, I could've been hit her 
 Now I got the top down, tryna let the wind hit her 
 Gotta keep a strap close ain't tryna have no kids with her

 Lately I been thinking different 
 The money's been coming in and incurring interest 
 Interesting shit, the ladies, they been known to flock me 
 But never met the type of women that could ever top me 
 I guess you think you make minds change 
 (?) 
 Pennies for these new thoughts, call it mind change 
 Oh, you tryna hit me with that god damn 
 I ain't a player but I crushed a lot 
 Games are won by inches and believe me girl, I won a lot 
 I say I'm playing but I'm really not 
 I'm just tryna hit your spot 
 And call up Tesha, tell her meet us at Liberty 
 I know that she feeling me 
 I felt it all up in her energy 
 If you with it how I'm with it 
 Then I let you have your way first 
 I mean whatever works 
 I'm the worst, right?
