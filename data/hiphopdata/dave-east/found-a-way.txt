I found a way 
 It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way 
 I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way 
 (Switch my whole life up) 
 I found a way 
 It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way (found a way) 
 I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way (found a way) 
 Got sick and tired of wearin' the same clothes, I found a way (found a way) 
 Got tired of seein' the same hoes, I found a way (found a way) 
 I found a way 
 Any drug, any plug on deck, if you come around the way 
 I got dimes on the way 
 Ain't got time for no games 
 Just wanna shine like a chain 
 I'm out my mind, out my brain (brain) 
 From the grind came the fame (fame) 
 20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change 
 (I ain't got it) 
 Niggas that I grew up with, hate me more than ever 
 Charge it to the game (uh) 
 I just play the back seat, gettin' top, while the driver switch lanes

 Any drug, any plug on deck, come around the way 
 I got dimes on the way 
 Ain't got time for da' games (no time) 
 Just wanna shine like a chain (shine) 
 I'm out my mind, out my brain 
 From the grind came the fame 
 20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change 
 Run up on me, must be out your brain 
 You and I, we are not the same 
 Ain't say a word, when the cops a' came 
 Money comin', shit you gotta change 
 Hardest young nigga out the game 
 Watch my aim, got a hundred clip 
 Movin' like I'm on the wanted list 
 I'm on a yacht, with a hundred Crips 
 I ain't bitchin', shit, I wanted this 
 Jump out in Louis Vuitton 
 White tee, black leather jacket, like I'm cool with The Fonz 
 Fuck the ring, kiss the shoe of a don 
 Hundred p's, I could move 'em tomorrow

 Niggas that I grew up with, hate me more than ever 
 Charge it to the game 
 I just play the back seat, gettin' top, while the driver switch lanes 
 Pull up, new Maserati 
 I ain't touch her body, but the bitch came
