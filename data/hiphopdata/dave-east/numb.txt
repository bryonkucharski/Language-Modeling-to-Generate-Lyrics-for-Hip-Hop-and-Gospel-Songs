Been a while since I felt anything man. Body cold. I don't feel nothing no more. No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate. I don't feel it. No feelings, let me just live. Numb to the world 
 I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more 
 No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate 
 I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live 
 Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is 
 I'm numb 
 I've been feeling like this since I buried 'Lik 
 Waking up in cold sweats, paranoid I rarely sleep 
 I might be smiling to the public but inside I'm dead 
 All I see is bodies, bunch of memories inside my head 
 (?) caught a leg shot, shook it off, he walking now 
 Told me if he ain't got his hammer then he don't be walkin' around 
 (?) daughter growing, look at (?) she talking now 
 Pooch caught the same shot so he cautious now 
 I'm too familiar with pain, I watched my aunt pass 
 Her and pops smoking, I was tryna catch a contact 
 My man sold cable, they hired him up at Comcast 
 He ain't wanna give up his jewelry, his life had cost that 
 Drugs done had you watch your uncle like y'all ain't related 
 I'm from where niggas'll kill just you don't make it 
 Barely had the opportunity so when it come I take it 
 Fuck a jail cell, I rather lay up with some bitches naked 
 I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more 
 No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate 
 I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live 
 Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is 
 I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more 
 No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate 
 I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live 
 Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is 
 I'm numb 
 Like I sniffed a line of cocaine 
 Thinking I ain't had no cab money, I'd ride on the train 
 Me and Gutta in his mother crib, high on our brain 
 Watched a couple niggas change, we ain't vibing the same 
 I mean niggas I would ride with, roll up, get high with 
 Before the Nas cosign, we was stuck in the projects 
 Free my nigga Sheek, we had our differences, I still love him 
 I'm still hustling, only difference I don't feel nothing 
 Same niggas act like I didn't even exist 
 Tryna hit me up on Instagram like East is the shit 
 Dropped out, said fuck school, I know my teachers is sick 
 'Cause when they turn on MTV, their kids repeating my shit, that's life 
 I came a long way from riding in that Cherokee 
 Father still in therapy, they fucked my man back up 
 Had a bunch of problems, I ain't never called no back up 
 Popping xannies, my plug tight with me fucking my packs up 
 I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more 
 No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate 
 I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live 
 Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is 
 I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more 
 No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate 
 I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live 
 Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is 
 I'm numb
