Bitches call me Don Pablo 
 Louis Vutton poncho 
 Photos with my eyes low 
 Strapped wherever I go 
 I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
 Yola in the bando 
 Rolling up in Franco 
 Toe tag and won't brag about it now you John Doe 
 If you need a joint play the point, Rondo 
 Tanning out in Cali, El Segundo 
 Left your baby momma with her mind blown 
 Took a trip to Cabo 
 Nigga got some work, now he think he El Chapo 
 Masked up, hoodie low creeping through your block slow 
 Tryna find a lick, we could split, get the nachos 
 Swerving off the Henny but I'm watching out for potholes 
 Thinking of them nights I was stressing in the box bro 
 Chiefing like tanto, only afford McDonald's, OJ 
 I'm in the Bronco, me and Blanco 
 Spanish buy steak and cilantro, el guapo 
 I only count to quatro, coco for your nostril 
 Shining everywhere I walk I make the whole block glow 
 Fly young nigga getting to it, bet your pops know 
 Hottest in my city, all the judges and the cops know 
 Call my nigga Gato, my jeans used to be Paco 
 Baby mother Spanish nigga, fell in love with tacos 
 I was in Miami up in Liv, me and Capo 
 Mad under covers in the building, I did not know 
 I come from the town that's famous for the Apollo 
 When you getting money, even famous bitches swallow 
 Hit it from a DM, I ain't even have to follow 
 Rosé to the face, I ain't never passed the bottle 
 I'm always sick, I don't never need a doc note 
 2DopeBoy, I'm always looking like I got coke
