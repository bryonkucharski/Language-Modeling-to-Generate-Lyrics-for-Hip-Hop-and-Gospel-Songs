 Got me peekin' through the blinds like Malcolm 
 Forty on me 
 Paranoia gettin' the best of me 
 I don't want nobody next to me 
 Don't talk unless you got a check for me 
 I don't see nobody ahead of me 
 Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em 
 I cannot wait 'til this pack is done 
 Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em 
 Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one 
 Paranoia gettin' the best of me 
 I don't want nobody next to me 
 Don't talk unless you got a check for me 
 I don't see nobody ahead of me 
 Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em 
 I cannot wait 'til this pack is done 
 Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em 
 Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one 
 I cannot wait 'til this pack is done 
 These niggas fuckin' the package up 
 That bullshit they kickin' ain't adding up 
 Plus they don't get no pussy like Magic's son 
 Hundreds on hundreds, I stack it up 
 She bust that pussy then back it up 
 We standing on couches, we actin' up 
 I don't think these niggas mad enough 
 Patek cost me eighty, come add it up 
 Hands on my neck and my face, I got tatted up 
 I understand why they mad at us 
 But get out the way when the Phantom is backing up 
 You need to go on vacation and pack it up 
 Talkin' 'bout drugs but these niggas ain't trap enough 
 Niggas still tellin', I guess they ain't rat enough 
 Came a long way from them dimes in that Acura 
 So much ice, make 'em stare 
 Your wife got caught up in the lights like a deer 
 Living my life, though I know it ain't fair 
 They think I'm from 12th Street, I run with no fear 
 See the borough from the Lear, yeah 
 Brown diamonds look like beer, clear 
 Shots'll hit you, doctors screaming clear 
 I'm just paranoid, don't believe in scared 
 I can see the dead 
 Paranoia gettin' the best of me 
 I don't want nobody next to me 
 Don't talk unless you got a check for me 
 I don't see nobody ahead of me 
 Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em 
 I cannot wait 'til this pack is done 
 Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em 
 Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one 
 Paranoia gettin' the best of me 
 I don't want nobody next to me 
 Don't talk unless you got a check for me 
 I don't see nobody ahead of me 
 Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em 
 I cannot wait 'til this pack is done 
 Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em 
 Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one 
 Jeezy 
 I made a million a million times 
 They must've snorted a million lines 
 Mind playin' tricks, Willie D 
 Let my top down, ceiling me 
 Hermes, thirty on the hip 
 Vegas watch, hundred on the strip 
 Half a hundred hang up out the clip 
 Pop that pussy like I'm Uncle Luke 
 This marijuana got the best of me 
 When I land just have a vest for me 
 All these bad bitches wantin' saving 
 All this money, it gon' be the death of me 
 New Rollies for the gang gang 
 New chucks, yeah gang bang 
 Know some niggas down to hit the lick 
 Eighty-six a nigga for a brick
