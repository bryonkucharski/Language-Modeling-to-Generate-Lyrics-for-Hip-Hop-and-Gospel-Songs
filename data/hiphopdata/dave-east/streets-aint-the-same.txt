The streets ain't the same no more 
 It feel like everybody tellin' 
 This is a stick up, just lay on the floor 
 Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow 
 Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon 
 Never seen a trap but everybody sell it 
 Never been to jail before but everybody felons 
 Misdemeanor, I picked the Beamer, that's just how I like to ride 
 Connect called me, he landed, I need to see him 
 He got me waiting, nigga told me meet him after five 
 No pizzeria, my niggas passing pies 
 Watch out for the D's, I know they passing by 
 Watch out for the D's, they wanna lock us up 
 Half my niggas in prison, they still ain't satisfied 
 The streets ain't the same no more 
 It feel like everybody tellin' 
 This is a stick up, just lay on the floor 
 Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow 
 Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon 
 Never seen a trap but everybody sell it 
 Never been to jail before but everybody felons 
 Grand larceny awkwardly niggas target me 
 Jealous 'cause I shop on 5th Ave, they where the Target be 
 Raised out of poverty, not a youngin as hard as me 
 Bucking knees (?) nigga don't bother me 
 Talk about the pain, talk about the (?) 
 No umbrella walking in the rain, niggas took my chain 
 Never got it back but now I got it made 
 And I ain't into jewelry, your bitch know you ain't cool as me 
 The streets ain't the same no more 
 It feel like everybody tellin' 
 This is a stick up, just lay on the floor 
 Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow 
 Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon 
 Never seen a trap but everybody sell it 
 Never been to jail before but everybody felons 
 Everything changed, everybody different 
 Everybody popping pills, molly got us tripping 
 Thinking back, I had a crush on Halle Berry 
 Most these niggas is bitches, undercover like Tyler Perry 
 That coke had lil fiends on line, you gotta hurry 
 My whole block indited my nigga I gotta worry 
 That brown (?) town lose 
 By round two, they found you 
 We done drowned you, you can't swim in the water with sharks 
 (?) like Owen Heart 
 I want everything in double like this Noah's Arch 
 It ain't the same 
 The streets ain't the same no more 
 It feel like everybody tellin' 
 This is a stick up, just lay on the floor 
 Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow 
 Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon 
 Never seen a trap but everybody sell it 
 Never been to jail before but everybody felons
