 Uh 
 Our life was never borin' 
 Every 5 dollars counted, shit that sandwich was important 
 I love my niggas, understand it how I call it 
 Loc till I'm dead, like eggs we would scramble every mornin' 
 Holla at red, LAX, we landin' at 4 
 Me and Loc use to stand by the store 
 Hope the cameras was off 
 I did my own dirt, puttin' all of my own work 
 How much I could make off of these grams? That was my homework 
 You can't understand the highway till you hit the road first 
 Thinking I was a draft pick the minute I had that growth spurt 
 Same nigga played the corner, bodega with no shirt 
 Sunflower seeds and Sour Patches, I was askin' 
 For extensions on the rent, now it's designer fabric (designer) 
 Couldn't sit on auntie furniture, if not the plastic (we couldn't) 
 Really gotta be out your mind to survive the madness 
 It ain't hard to buy a boat, it's hard to find a captain 
 It ain't hard to find the smoke, it just depend who askin' (who want it) 
 I gave hope to every block that's in upper Manhattan (Harlem) 
 We gave dough burn the tips, I use to light my baggies (burner) 
 Don't focus on us, focus on keepin' wifey happy 
 If you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it 
 I give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it 
 Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 If you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it 
 Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 It was so real 
 Breakfast lunch and dinner was oatmeal 
 I don't drink soda but I'm so familiar with coke deals 
 They robbed him when he bought it, ain't get to see how that coat feels 
 Might not know her name but I could tell you how her throat feels 
 You don't really know me, you ain't know me when I sold pills 
 Bubb told me don't pour it up if it ain't got no seal 
 Chill never paid the bills, mental racin' still 
 Had no TV, now I pay multiple cable bills 
 I remember Malil tellin' me "take the wheel" 
 Back when Freekey told me rap they probably gonna make a deal 
 (?) I hate the way it make me feel 
 If my niggas slidin', I'm slidin', I really played the field 
 We got felonies but jealously can never break us 
 Talked to Drizzy up in Toronto, I'm missin' hella paper 
 Most of my niggas do biz chasin' money, go up north and get big 
 Might come home to no crib 
 We got parole on us, walk with the heat, we keep the stove on us 
 NYPD just pray that I get pulled with old warrants 
 If you told on us, on God, you broke the code on us 
 5 in the mornin', in your momma crib with no warnin' 
 If you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it 
 I give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it 
 Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 If you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it 
 Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been 
 Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
