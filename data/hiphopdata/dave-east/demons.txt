I can give a fuck about a blog list 
 I'm reading gun magazines looking for a cartridge 
 Winchester special edition, leave niggas nauseous 
 Riding in a Crown Vic I picked up from the auction 
 Presidents in my pockets, these niggas all dead 
 I'm in a Spider the same color as cornbread 
 She ain't fucking with the help but gave the boss head 
 And most my niggas is crip but I want the Porsche red 
 Yankee Stadium, hustled around the corner 
 Jumping on the Bruckner backwoods and marijuana 
 Whole block sweating it's feeling just like a sauna 
 I can't predict the future but bet I fuck up some commas 
 How it feel to be respected in the projects 
 Chinese and some Kennedy fried, that's all I digest 
 Can't just get it, be patient 'cause it's a process 
 These niggas don't care about living long as they die fresh 
 Avoiding the precinct, ducking my demons 
 Some say I'm conceded, act like I need 'em 
 Praying five times a day to clean my sins up 
 Knowing I'm just tryna pull that Benz up 
 Avoiding the priests and ducking my demons 
 Some say I'm conceded, act like I need 'em 
 Praying five times a day to clean my sins up 
 Knowing I'm just tryna pull that Benz up 
 I know it's hard to shine, that's why they hate a star 
 Dirty face and towel, shaking yola in a mason jar 
 You think you riding, I got some youngins that'll take your car 
 Break your legs then fuck the bitch that'll break your heart 
 Fuck the 23rd, 25th, and the 14th 
 NYPD try to put pressure to make us all sing 
 But me, I can't harmonize, I don't know no melodies 
 I know about felonies, delinquents full of jealousy 
 Used to have that dog food and I ain't talking Pedigree 
 Bully told me he on tour with Trigger, shit is heavenly 
 I'm still in the junkie house, I promise in a month I'm out 
 Phone clicking all this chicken got me in your hunny mouth 
 Crashed up my first whip, they say I took the dummy route 
 My man took some pills to Virginia, he tryna run the south 
 Back to the city, it's gritty niggas is dumbing out 
 Cops giving out shots, no longer giving summons out 
 Clear the summer out 
 Avoiding the priests and ducking my demons 
 Some say I'm conceded, act like I need 'em 
 Praying five times a day to clean my sins up 
 Knowing I'm just tryna pull that Benz up 
 Avoiding the priests and ducking my demons 
 Some say I'm conceded, act like I need 'em 
 Praying five times a day to clean my sins up 
 Knowing I'm just tryna pull that Benz up 
 Please forgive us, we all just want to correct our wrongs. Right?
