Time to get paid 
 I want the money 
 I gotta get guap 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I'm fresh off the block, this money keep calling 
 I be up till the morning, this shit never stop 
 I hit me a lick, went straight to the Bendo 
 It's lit like a candle, let you and your man know 
 I got it for cheap, come cop what you want 
 The coppers be on us, I don't know what they want 
 We just tryna eat to get out the streets 
 They calling me back, I'm just tryna leave 
 I come from the bottom, putting that work in the bottle 
 I fucked me a model, she just asked me for a follow 
 I hop a truck, it's either the Range or the Tahoe 
 I do not give a fuck, she love me enough 
 She gon' swallow, she gon' swallow 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I talk what I live, I handle my biz' 
 I come from the projects, get shot by a kid 
 We rolling around with pistols and ganja 
 When I fuck up some paper, I just listen to commas 
 I can cook it front of you, this shit Benihana Hannas 
 Sell a nick to your momma, got a clip for the drama 
 I pull up and park it, I tinted the whip 
 Go get me some backwoods then I take a trip 
 I'm living the life, these niggas would not understand 
 Call me what you want, can't call me broke, started out moving grams 
 I wake up and hustle, I got no time for fronting 
 Ain't taking no handouts, I don't owe you niggas nothing, nothing 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid 
 I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake 
 I gotta get paper, gotta get money 
 Time to get paid
