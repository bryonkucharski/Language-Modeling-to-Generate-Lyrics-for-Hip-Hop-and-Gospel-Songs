 I just made a hundred 
 I just made a hundred 
 I just made a hundred 
 I just made a hundred 
 This bitch get annoying, on God, I'm changin' my number 
 I'm a rich nigga that came from the gutter 
 I don't feel this perc, I'ma take me another 
 After we fuck, I'm unable to cuddle 
 Right back to the money, you know how I play it 
 I'm not your boyfriend, I don't know what you sayin' 
 Lyin' on my name, you know what you sayin' 
 In and out the streets, they treat me like royalty 
 These bitches cannot spell 'loyalty' 
 I dropped a bag on my lawyer fee 
 Way before these engineers was recordin' me 
 Sorry boo, can't give you all of me 
 Pardon me, you just want me 'cause I'm hot 
 When I was dead broke couldn't get you to stop 
 Now that I'm on you done turned to a thot, why? 
 I started off with a pot 
 Picked up the backend and went got me a spot 
 Head on a swivel, I know niggas plot 
 I'm checkin' every car that slide through the block 
 Five-fifty with the S in the front 
 I just got the best head of the month 
 Saved her number under "Man-eater" 
 And I ain't get her from the 'Gram neither 
 Caught her in traffic, she bent it over like she teachin' yoga 
 Or she used to be in gymnastics 
 Either way I cannot pass it, I'm bringing cash in 
 She wanna FaceTime and text, I just want some neck 
 I ain't got respect 
 Hit it on the couch, hit it on the steps 
 Put it in your mouth, I'ma make a mess 
 I just made a hundred 
 This bitch get annoying, on God, I'm changin' my number 
 I'm a rich nigga that came from the gutter 
 I don't feel this perc, I'ma take me another 
 After we fuck, I'm unable to cuddle 
 Right back to the money, you know how I play it 
 I'm not your boyfriend, I don't know what you sayin' 
 Lying on my name, you know what you sayin' 
 They just paid me a hundred 
 This bitch get annoying, on God, I'm changin' my number 
 I'm a rich nigga that came from the gutter 
 I don't feel this perc, I'ma take me another 
 After we fuck, I'm unable to cuddle 
 Right back to the money, you know how I play it 
 I'm not your boyfriend, I don't know what you sayin' 
 Lying on my name, you know what you sayin' 
 T.I. 
 Ridin' red Ford, in the greg lord 
 Every time she see me I'm in rare form 
 Bet she do it for a pair of Air Jordans 
 In the mornin', send her get her hair done 
 On the highway, bet her head goin' 
 Up and down sloppily, hope no one watchin' me 
 Tell my daddy, I'm fulfilling his prophecy 
 Hundred fifty million, ain't no one stoppin' me 
 Watch your convo when you talk to me 
 Make me think you plottin', tryna possibly follow me 
 Lay on me, just like them robbers be 
 Out your damn mind, you just gotta be 
 You gon' get shot 
 This dope boy academy, Big Skoob 
 Where you certainly can get your issue 
 Can't fit your feet in them, they big shoes 
 Man we countin' these hundreds 
 And switching up numbers like yeah yeah
