Dave East 
 I'm feeling like I ain't took a nap in weeks 
 I'm up, couple thousand tucked, right in back the jeep 
 I'm stuck, diamonds in the cut make an actress speak 
 Sports, drugs, and entertainment, think I'm Master P 
 Sports, drugs, and entertainment, think I'm Killa Cam 
 20 grams, spin it like a ceiling fan 
 Pan, pan, old Harlem niggas pitching grams 
 Kill the streets then hit the beach, go get a tan 
 On the sixth floor, right in the 'jects, writing my best 
 Wishing I was on my fifth tour, got some work I can click off 
 Learned how to stack good 
 I just want that Beamer same color as a Backwood (dark brown) 
 Still empty, I'm that hood 
 Used to do the chicken spot, now it's Benihana lunch 
 Rolled with some older niggas that'll tie your mama up 
 Oyster perpetual for the Rollie, kept it diamond cut 
 Bottom nigga climbing up off sour, you can find me stuck 
 Bark shot, bring me right back, niggas'll line you up 
 Pull up in some shit you never seen so I ain't gotta rush 
 Zoom by, kush on my left, pills on my right 
 Kept the white right in the middle like moon pies, I'm too high 
 They think they riding till they goons die 
 My youngn' ask you what your shoe size 
 Then probably let a few fly 
 I'm in Miami with a Mu-ma 
 Tryna win the Grammy off of Grandz & Buda 
 I want the moolah, ha

 Cam'ron 
 Not again, look he dropping the drop again 
 I can go Margielas, Jordans, Timberlands, Moccasin 
 Your raggedy guns, don't even acknowledge 'em 
 Them old Eagles, nigga fuck is you Donovan? 
 My connect, I swear remain anonymous 
 And that's on everything, never name my accomplices 
 In all honestness (honestness) 
 They the real reason for all my accomplishments 
 See that car ain't from rap, heron sponsored it 
 Look we could bond a bit 
 Can't tell you everything though, believe it's mobster shit 
 Gats busting, that's nothing, bag up something 
 Niggas ran off with work, that lead to casket stuffing 
 Murder 1, homicide, it's that disgusting 
 Pulled the hammer on me, I said "fag you bluffing" 
 From Lennox Ave to Killa 1st 
 I get skrilla, yeah Killa I'm still in first
