Interrogations got my mental racing 
 I ain't tryna end up in Bellevue as no mental patient 
 See the plan was let's set a schedule, Tim from the other side had it 
 Tim was into the flashing, sold his sour and caskets 
 It's systematic, every Thursday night he would re-up 
 Navy blue Infiniti tinted, rolling his weed up 
 Anytime he felt he was followed it made him speed up 
 He rarely cracked a smile, his demeanor was always G'd up 
 Knew this chick that was mutual, every Monday they'd meet up 
 Quick visits, he'd drop off a bag, she got her feet up 
 Tim paid the rent to the apartment, it's in shorty name 
 Shorty name? I'll get to that later, to me they all the same 
 My cousin James called my phone, told me it's urgent 
 He scoped the situation out, timing had to be perfect 
 Worthless feelings building inside the mother of Tim's kids 
 He got two boys plus she know where all of his friends live 
 We found the weakness in his platoon, it's goon weather 
 Hoodies only do dark colors, it help us move better 
 I told James, "'Cause you know what to do if you catch her" 
 Might've took a loss, will I lose? Never, that's fool's treasure 
 We gon' do this right, we ain't the type that's too extra 
 It's Sunday night, James got the drop on the meeting time 
 Monday came, Tim switched cars, nothing police could find 
 I'm on standby, James supposed to come pick me up 
 He said "At three, that Tim meeting shorty, something he picking up" 
 James ain't got no kids or no wifey so he don't give a fuck 
 James remember when I had called him, glad that he picked it up 
 (Hello?) I told him I woke up, Rollie missing (word?) 
 "Shit had me sick 'cause, ready to make my home the prison 
 She had her Gram deleted morning after I got robbed 
 Since then I been looking for her, I treat it like a job" 
 James took a picture and sent it, asked me who is it 
 I text him and I told him, no question, she look familiar 
 Fifteen thousand, the Rollie and a couple chains 
 Charged it to the game but something was on my brain 
 Couldn't figure it out, I'm thinking like Tim lying 
 James peeped one of Tim's sons walking with mommy 
 He thinking put him in the trunk and then he lit a blunt 
 He getting antsy, he been sitting on this lick all month 
 He ain't bother them, more concerned with they father than 'em 
 James parked in the complex, shawty walking in 
 Black leggings, leather jacket, and some black shades 
 Shorty five seven, few days earlier she got braids 
 Ever since I got robbed, riding 'round in a hot rage 
 Don't even care if I get locked up till I'm my pops' age 
 James called me one more time, Tim pulled up by himself 
 He parked and walked in the building, and then he checked his mail 
 James a face Tim ain't never seen, shorty and Tim 
 Up in the crib, this nigga fell asleep 
 James knocked twice, nobody answered so he picked the lock 
 Cut the lights, took his shoes off, walked around in his socks 
 Shorty in the bathroom, wine glass and red wine 
 Tim got missed calls from his sons before they bedtime 
 James opened the door, it's steaming, whole mirror foggy 
 Shorty in the tub, James 'bout to leap, he feeling froggy 
 Soon as she see him, two shots, right in the forehead 
 Silencer kept the blood neat, ain't leave the floor red 
 Slid out, Tim still sleeping, he never woke up 
 James had some powder to make him think Tim was coked up 
 Leather bag, iPhones, chains, and the Rolex 
 Fifteen thousand in hundreds and fifties, took no less 
 Tim stretched out so James looked through his phone 
 Searched through all the dressers, exploring all through the home 
 A couple of text messages, saw the name Keish 
 "Wait a minute, that's that same bitch that robbed East" 
 James ran out, jumped in the car, relit the blunt up 
 The sun up, kids going to school, think I might come up 
 Keisha found in a pool of blood, James got one up 
 I owe you nigga
