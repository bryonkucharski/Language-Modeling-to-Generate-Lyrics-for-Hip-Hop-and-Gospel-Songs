No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 I'm stuck in the trap, No Coachella For Me 
 I got work coming in, No Coachella For Me 
 I can't leave the hood 'cause my phone clickin' 
 No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 My momma, she told me her rent is due, No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 Sellin' a key, No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, watch yo head in these streets 
 I'm stuck in New York, tryna break down a key 
 We can bottle a bag it, all these models I smash 'em 
 Fill my pocket with magnums, 100 choppas just to blast some 
 Couldn't go to Coachella 
 Came up on some coke, it's whateva 
 Dreams of me killin' that stage, if I was dope, I'd be 9 or betta 
 50 grams in a Jansport, give a fuck what your man thought 
 Shaving and baggin', my hands salt 
 Ova that work, knock yo man off 
 I'm just pimpin' and whippin' and whippin' 
 And whippin' and whippin' and whippin' and whippin' 
 In the kitchen, the studio back to the kitchen 
 They look at me different 
 If that money be missin', yo honey be missin' 
 My stomach just itchin' 
 'Cause I'm hungry, you bitchin' 
 You run in yo house with no luggage, I'm trippin' 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 I'm stuck in the trap, No Coachella For Me 
 I got work coming in, No Coachella For Me 
 I can't leave the hood 'cause my phone clickin' 
 No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 My momma, she told me her rent is due, No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 Sellin' a key, No Coachella For Me 
 (Why you ain't go to Coachella?) 
 She ask why we ain't go together 
 That bitch was a ho when I met her 
 Left her make up over my polo sweater 
 Pop the Fofo Beretta 
 I'm like Manolo, I might hit yo sister 
 Bend that bitch ova, I will neva kiss her 
 Strapped up fo' war, I'll go in on whoeva 
 Bubble like crack, she got a bubble that's fat 
 I be with gusties and traps 
 Act like they hate me, but love me in fact 
 I got hitters that don't give a fuck about rap 
 Couldn't go to Coachella, I was out swiping in Soho with Heather 
 I'd play the cars, she'd go in the store 
 We got enough but we gon' get some more 
 I had a bitch but don't want her no more 
 It's back to the kitchen, we come off on tour 
 I could do Louies, do Ninas, do Bloomies 
 And that's off a day in the trap 
 I hate to do a 3 to 6 with this pistol 
 But fuck it, it's right on my lap 
 Maybe next year I could make it a promise 
 I wanted to go, my neighbor's in love with this coke 
 Whoa! 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 I'm stuck in the trap, No Coachella For Me

 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me 
 My momma, she told me her rent is due, No Coachella For Me 
 No Coachella For Me, No Coachella For Me
