I asked my cousin why they pulled him over 
 He gave me a look as if he didn't know 
 I had my basketball and my now and laters 
 Ain't get along with my neighbors, I was a rough kid 
 Hearing sirens through my window 
 Them blue and red lights kept me up at night 
 I couldn't get enough of life 
 I seen this kid get arrested in the park 
 He was screaming he ain't do it 
 They ain't even let him talk 
 I ain't understand I'm like 10 blowing in the wind 
 Tryna find a park to go play, I don't know the drama 
 I ask my mama what do police do? 
 She told me stay up out they way 
 Go to school and get good grades 
 One day I'm walking in my building and they stopped me 
 Told me I looked just like this kid that did a robbery 
 And I ain't never stole nothing in my life 
 Maybe candy out the store or a bag of chips 
 Imagine this, years go by, I got a little older 
 My best friends in group homes, I got a little colder 
 I'm tryna make the varsity team, chill with Stacy and 
 Shop at the mall, only Ralph Lauren they'll lace me in 
 I had the Moncler, remember begging moms for it 
 Walking home from school, I almost got robbed for it 
 I took off, I can't go home without my jacket on 
 Blue and whites harassing me but I don't know what happened to 'em 
 Left and right I'm seeing homies get interrogated 
 We ain't safe where we live, this America ain't it? 
 High School they teaching me this the land of the free 
 But everything got a price, they don't answer to me 
 They don't answer to us, we getting tattoos 
 They think we criminals 'cause we believe that cash rules 
 Attitude a little different when you from the gutter 
 I seen a cop talk crazy to my mother 
 My father familiar, he told me all about 'em 
 Told me never go around and avoid 'em, that's if you can 
 Black intelligent man they worst nightmare 
 They'd rather have you in prison forever, they don't fight fair 
 Starting to think about college, I got some scholarships 
 I just graduated, two cops pulled me over 
 Tried to show my diploma, they ain't acknowledge it 
 Three young black males riding in the jeep 
 Bout to go to college, they thinking we in the street 
 They hate got a little bit deeper, I'm getting frustrated 
 A bunch of slick comments, I'm still a nigga 
 Even if you got millions, they still'll get ya 
 I played ball, I was the man on campus 
 Little weed up in my dorm, I got ran off campus 
 Then I got locked up, minor bid, it was short 
 Staring at my mother crying up in court 
 Came home, I started rapping, had to trap first 
 Phone ringing all night, was tryna take a nap first 
 Gang squad hopping out, narcotics watching 
 We had the weed and the pills then we got it rocking 
 Cameras in the projects helped us move smarter 
 Niggas turned butch building into the new carter 
 Pooch did a bid and came home the same nigga 
 Bully did a bid and came home the same nigga 
 My moms working all night, I had late dinners 
 Went broke tryna cope a coat, that made me hate winter 
 Focused up, got a deal, now this shit is real 
 Every time I leave the club, they hope I got the steel 
 We just got some weed, we just tryna chill 
 We just tryna eat, we just tryna build 
 They follow every car I try to ride in 
 I'm just praying this ain't the car that I die in 
 I guess with this hoodie on I'm a murderer 
 I'm just tryna buy my mother some new furniture 
 This attitude is programmed 
 Imagine getting harassed for you whole life 
 All day and the whole night 
 They say prison is the new slave ship 
 They don't understand we hustling so we can pay rent 
 Soon as they come around it feel like your luck gone 
 They gotta show you they power, that's why they put the cuffs on 
 Ain't no more weed in the car sir, the blunt gone 
 I got my hands ups, officer what's the problem? 
 Please don't shoot me sir, I just had a daughter 
 Look here go a *blaow*
