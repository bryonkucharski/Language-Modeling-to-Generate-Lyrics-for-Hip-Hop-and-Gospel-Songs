Spent a lot of night and a lot of days hoping I get that work on 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap 
 Dave East 
 Running (?) hundred on your head, fill your top with lead 
 Far from fed 
 All my niggas starving, stomach feeling dead 
 Feeling fresh, I don't know 'bout you but I can make it back 
 Take a pack, bring it to the hood, bet I make a stack 
 Harlem's own, smokers call my phone when they want a fix 
 I can spit but I'm still up in the trap, I want a brick 
 Call my bluff, I just need some drugs, tired of being broke 
 Fuck the fame, got a lot of aim, let 'em see the scope 
 Bedroom full of white girl, let 'em see the coke 
 Rip a ounce right before I bounce, gotta flee the coast 
 Bitches know I can get it quick, all my shit legit 
 On the strip tryna make it flip, started out with nicks 
 Got the dimes coming from my (?) I seen a lot of crime 
 Out my mind, you, you better watch your moms 
 All of me giving all I got, now I'm calling shots 
 Ballet pick my parking spot, shots light up the parking lot 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap 
 Tray Pizzy 
 Back back, dare a nigga front, hit 'em with the pump 
 With the shits gun'll eat a clip, take a shit and dump 
 What you want, I can promise nigga it ain't this duck 
 Dip you a burger nigga I can get you flipped, get you clipped 
 I can get you hit, all I know is clap nigga 
 Brick half quarter chicken, all I know is trap nigga 
 Bottle, zip it, seal it get it, all I know is bag nigga 
 You a bitch, you be in the crib, you just rap nigga 
 Trap lord, no Ferg bi, name a drug and I served it 
 My named good and I earned it 
 They had the knob down and I turned it 
 Tried school but I ain't learned shit 
 Kept it gully, that fern shit 
 Silence lambs, they ain't heard shit 
 Yoga flame and I burn shit 
 Niggas wack, told 'em give it, y'all was murdered once 
 RIP Chinx, Riot Squad, word to Ferguson 
 Fuck your man raps, tell 'em that, I ain't heard of son 
 Broke and Trippy, neighborhood, bitch I know you heard of 'em 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap 
 Selling packs, youngin got a strap, tryna make it back 
 Home, got the crome, at your dome, lay a nigga flat 
 Play it back, youngin in the front counting up twenty racks 
 In the trap, all I know is trap, all I know is trap
