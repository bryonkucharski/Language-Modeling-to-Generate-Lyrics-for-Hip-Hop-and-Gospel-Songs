 Money, murder, murder 
 I never ran off on the plug 
 But I run out of court 
 Talking bricks like they building a fort 
 But Margiela they cannot afford 
 Loco what's whipping good? 
 Said it click when you hit with the fork 
 I'm true to Allah and I don't fuck with cops 
 Keep me away from that pork 
 I'm prolly one of the realest yet 
 Trust me these niggas can feel a threat 
 I'm not too concerned with the internet 
 Come pop up in spots where we really at 
 I think in my city I'm killing that 
 I'm from Harlem, how I'm not conceited? 
 Drop the Beamer and it's chocolate seated 
 Smoking sour, you still chocolate weeded 
 My younging hit you, he ain't got a reason 
 Deals is coming in, I got to read 'em 
 Warren Buffet shit, I gotta meet him 
 Hitter starving and I gotta feed him 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 Swipe, ran out the store 
 I be looking like I came off a tour 
 You might make it rain but we make it pour 
 Ask them bitches 'bout me, they say for sure 
 How could I ever get bored? 
 Her pussy good, I could never get bored 
 I got a condo I'm never gon' show her 
 We gon' do tellies so upstairs with cheddy 
 No Benihana bitch go to the deli 
 My life in a rush, ain't no time to get ready 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 I spend a few grand in that store 
 How you out holding hands with a whore? 
 Hand to hand with the greens, I need more 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 Tell me how can I get bored? 
 Coconut seats in the Porsche 
 This shit you cannot ignore 
 All of this money keep coming in 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 Balmain from my head to the floor 
 This shit you cannot ignore 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 Tell me how can I get bored? 
 Coconut seats in the Porsche 
 This shit you cannot ignore 
 All of this money keep coming in 
 This shit I cannot ignore 
 Balmain from my head to the floor 
 This shit you cannot ignore 
 2 Chainz 
 2 Chainz! 
 This right here Christian Dior 
 You never seen it before 
 Ever since a nigga tried me in Cali 
 I took a chopper on tour 
 You can ask TMZ, MTV, BET 
 I got more dimes than CP3 
 Came from the EBT, now these foe envy me 
 That's off the top just like Kennedy 
 See this is that pay style 
 I turn your girl to a Paypal 
 I'm turning dinner to takeout 
 I gave her D just like 8 Mile 
 Whew, Skittles and M&Ms 
 Murder and killer the synonyms 
 Even massages ain't feeling them 
 It's more than a threat that I'm sendin' them, ooh 
 I never fold under pressure 
 I keep that thing by the dresser 
 I keep it right by the Bible 
 I hope it don't mess up my blessings, Lord 
 You can ask Short I'm finessing 
 Yeah you can ask God I was reckless 
 Yeah you can ask Joe bout my neckless 
 Yeah he put all the ice in that motherfucker 
 I brought all the dice in that motherfucker 
 Straight hole like Yanks in this motherfucker 
 Shit you just cannot ignore 
 Pinky ring bigger than yours 
 And my lean pinker than yours 
 My girl pussy pinker than hers 
 I bought a Porsche just to trap in 
 I came on that cat when I'm bored
