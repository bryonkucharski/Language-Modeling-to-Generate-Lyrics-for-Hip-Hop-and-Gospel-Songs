I just wanna say thank you to every hater 
 Thank you (Thank you) 
 Every, every city I go (I go, I appreciate it) 
 (From the bottom of my heart) 
 I ain't ever tell 'em my name (No more, no more, no more) 
 (I mean that) 
 Wake up every mornin' I pray 
 I done came a real long way (long way) 
 Every other city I go (I go) 
 I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name) 
 If you hatin' I just wanna say "Thank you" 
 Know you doin' something right when they hate you 
 Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you 
 Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you 
 Wake up every mornin' I pray 
 I done came a real long way (long way) 
 Every other city I go (I go) 
 I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)

 Know you doin' something right when they hate you 
 Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you 
 Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you 
 Nowadays I pull up in a Range, I remember hoppin' that train 
 I gotta thank God for all the pain that got a nigga all up in the game 
 Foreign, I be out with my gang 
 They jackin' I changed and I didn't 
 I get your back on that pint, switch up fitted 
 Nowadays, niggas just look at me different 
 Pay me for what? I just handle my business 
 I play with them Benz, I can't handle a ticket 
 I know I came up, but don't act like you don't know me 
 You wasn't around back when I had to get it 
 Wasn't around back when I had to hustle 
 Wasn't around back when I used to struggle 
 We used to throw all that cash in a duffle 
 Now all this cash keep me right out of trouble 
 Thank You

 We up in the sky right now 
 Used to fall asleep in the spot with the fiends, ran down like 
 "I want a rock right now" 
 This is for them niggas tryna plot right now 
 We up in the section, my niggas is flexin', I can see you hype, calm down 
 The girls say I'm different, the G's know I'm gettin' it, I'm shittin', it drop all brown (ugh) 
 They don't wanna see you get no real money (nah) 
 They don't wanna see you with no foreign (nah) 
 They don't wanna see you with that top model (top model) 
 If we winnin', I'm just makin' sure I'm scorin' 
 State to state, now they makin' sure I'm tourin' (we out) 
 Every time I speak, they recordin' 
 Now when we eat bigger portions (we eatin') 
 I got to sleep thinkin' Porches 
 Wake up every mornin' I pray
