Joe Joe got 'em again 
 Just tryna be on my own time 
 Everybody need a favor lately 
 I just wanna be me 
 I just wanna be me 
 Uh, my aunt Barbara died in 2008 
 My paps became diabetic, he lost a lot of weight 
 Get mad love in my city, still get a lot of hate 
 Was never selfish, if I had food, the homies gotta plate 
 This is my life don't take offense to 
 We went from riding rentals to more rides than Great Adventure 
 The ones that's closest give me my distance, I got a temper 
 Missing my daughter, I'm across the country in a Sprinter 
 I never ask niggas for nothing now I'm the one they count on 
 Tryna' smoke some weed, sip some lean, get my bounce on 
 Me and Bullet smoking out the bag till an ounce gone 
 I ain't just screaming free my niggas, I'm looking out for 'em 
 I just wanted custom seats in the old Capris 
 Wish I was closer with my nephews, so much to show my niece 
 I'm tryna' make Wayno go shopping, this nigga know he cheap 
 Tryna' learn the music industry the way I know the streets 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 I don't care nothing about nothing, you claim (not at all) 
 I'd rather die before I front on my gang 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 In, in my heart I know Allah done bless me 
 But why my baby mama gotta stress me? 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 I'm just tryna' survive in this crazy world 
 Don't call my phone I'm with my baby girl 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 We might have played the staircases with a lot of Henny' 
 I owe you nothing nigga, not a penny 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 I just wanna smoke a blunt and watch Goodfellas 
 I just want that foreign shit to make your hood jealous 
 I just wanna take Kairi to Dubai 
 Pop the xanny on the flight to help me sleep through the sky 
 I just wanna wake up and go the Gucci store 
 Thinking back when I was broke, I ain't know who to call 
 Did six months, glad the judge ain't give me that two-to-four 
 Can't describe the pain I felt when people told me you should ball 
 On the hood just want a week without an interview 
 Want my brother to know if he feeling pain, I feel it too 
 I used to want Angelettie to do an interlude 
 Now it's so many mad rappers, shit if he did it? Cool 
 I make way more than my teachers, fuck how I did in school 
 I just want a girl that like girls so we can pick and choose 
 Still grippin' tools, the city know 'fore it hit the news 
 We them different dudes, crib gotta come with a swimming pool 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 I don't care nothing about nothing, you claim 
 I'd rather die before I front on my gang 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 In, in my heart I know Allah done bless me 
 But why my baby mama gotta stress me? 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 I'm just tryna survive in this crazy world 
 Don't call my phone I'm with my baby girl 
 (I just wanna be me) 
 We might have played the staircases with a lot of Henny 
 I owe you nothing nigga, not a penny 
 (I just wanna be me)
