 Shorty only 19, always on the night scene 
 He don't know what life means 
 We need to slow down 
 Her mama says she drive her crazy 
 She's just a baby but she's about to have a baby 
 Slow down 
 He can't afford it so he wanna rob 
 He'd rather trap 'cause he don't want a job 
 You need to slow down 
 The world is yours just take your time with it 
 Get up, go out, and let your grind get it 
 Slow down

 Times changing, money motivate 'em different now 
 I don't even see no youngings shovel when it's blizzards now 
 '96 if I dug like four cars out, I'd cop some Nike kicks 
 And thinking Chinese chicken, wings, and rice to get 
 I guess the older heads ain't teaching nothing 
 I'm burnt out myself so honestly not preaching nothing 
 But if that trap slow get a job buy some nice shoes 
 And hit them parties down town where them wild niggas cannot get inside 
 Start thinking business 
 Remember money hard to mix with friendships 
 Once they show your interest, get your chicken 
 Young, black, and rich they worst nightmare 
 The government don't fight fair 
 If your homies love you keep 'em right there 
 Right there

 Don't be 30 in your mother crib, that's bugged out 
 Understand success gon' come with hate just get that love out 
 And don't be influenced just because they pull some drugs out 
 Stand up on your own two, know certain things you won't do 
 Everybody not a shooter understand that title 
 I picked the Quran up, I couldn't understand that Bible 
 Allah's my witness 
 I've been through the trenches just like most of them 
 That's why I go and smoke with them 
 Shop and crack jokes with them 
 I'm expecting a kid though, used to watch out the window 
 I love when the lil homies call me big bro 
 You living fast, need to slow it down 
 Started getting ass and got 'em open now 
 She thought she was in love, her heart broken now 
 Slow down

 Diamonds what the girls love 
 They just wanna shine 
 Copped the Rollie and the Cuban chain 
 Living with his mom 
 She in the club, her mother baby sit 
 Daddy not around 
 Fast living'll catch up quick 
 You need to slow it down

 Hey young world, the world, the world 
 The world, the world, baby the world 
 The world, the world 
 The world is yours 
 (Slow down, slow down)
