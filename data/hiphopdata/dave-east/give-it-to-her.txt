 The dope boys got their eyes on her 
 The ball players got their eyes on her, bitches telling lies on her 
 Her ex send her out of town. she had some pies on her 
 Now she into body art, they painting designs on her 
 Connected like I work for Time Warner 
 Posted on Instagram she hosting a club, that make the line longer 
 She said she rather smoke with me knowing that mine's stronger 
 Did a show in Cleveland, found out LeBron want her 
 I guess the way her body's made got you tryna stay 
 Blow every dollar in your pocket in the wildest way 
 I do the same but I love the game at a early age 
 They turn the page to be on you soon as they learn your name 
 It come with this shit, I run with the shit 
 If this was 96, I'd get off a bucket of Cris' 
 Cuban links, making drinks, and champagne or it's Cognac 
 Seen her and I own that, asking her where her phone at

 She just wanna wake up every morning to a penthouse view 
 A bag by Chanel, a Lil Balenciaga shoe 
 She just want a young street nigga that could fuck her good 
 But the money only thing that'll get her in the mood 
 And every nigga wanna give it to her 
 (I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it) 
 And every nigga wanna give it to her 
 (I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it) 
 Even me, I wanna give it to her 
 (I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it) 
 Every nigga wanna give it to her 
 (I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it)

 Floating down fifth like she on the ave 
 (?) was on her bag, hope none of my homies smashed 
 If they did, I'd doubt she ever let me know 
 More concerned with taking trips, feeling sand between her toes 
 She was dealing with them older men 
 You know the type tryna be low but you can notice them 
 I'm gutter like a bowling pin 
 Love her style, if I had it I'd give it all up 
 Turn my phone off when I'm with her, don't even call us 
 She just want a condo with her own closet 
 Ain't too many been riding, shorty got low milage 
 Chanel sneakers with the double C's 
 Membership to the gym but her best friend just had another C 
 Walk out the spot, the whole block paying attention 
 Leggings tight fitting, bottom of her shoes red 
 I'm tryna nail without a tool shed, I don't care what dudes said 
 Put in so much work she need a new bed
