 Uh, I fell in love with you early, it's dark and hell is hot 
 Around '97 fiends selling soap and selling socks 
 The only thing that kept me cool in this cold world 
 The streets got me under influence, I've been ruined 
 Bridge: Abir Haronni 
 I get to confessing my love 
 And you start to wonder expressing your questions 
 Like why? Like 
 I get to confessing my love 
 And you start to wonder expressing your questions 
 Like why? Like 
 Is that what you need love for? 
 What do you need? 
 All I want is you baby 
 You're the only one that keeps me cool baby 
 Keep me on my toes, I want you baby 
 Love I had the right to baby 
 Love you baby 
 You're the only one that keeps me cool baby 
 Keep me on my toes, I want you 
 I want you

 The culture what I care about 
 The cyphers on the stair cases 
 Me and my man got knocked, we had to share cases 
 I do it for the love, the hate keep the balance right 
 Red wine dining, it feel like a steak and salad night, uhm 
 Nothing in this world can compare to the music 
 Imagine changing your life after you said you'd do it 
 More respect than love so I ain't complaining 
 I'm vacation planting 'toes out in the Caymans 
 Thousands Islands, been violent long as I can remember 
 When your heat not working that's a different December 
 I got love for the game, I keep my mind humble 
 Realizing I'm surviving in a wild jungle 
 No stressing, learn lessons on how to save it 
 Now I got your favorite models naked 
 Survival is amazing 
 This Rollie like the ring of a champion 
 I used to tuck all of my work up under the Champion 
 Dumb wild nigga

 All I want is you baby 
 You're the only one that keeps me cool baby 
 Keep me on my toes, I want you baby 
 Love I had the right to baby 
 Love you baby 
 You're the only one that keeps me cool baby 
 Keep me on my toes, I want you 
 I want you

 We just need enough for us to break down 
 Shake the town, even them other niggas relate now 
 Hate the small talk before they ask for something 
 Baby, don't ask me nothing 
 Came up off a couple grams, I'm used to not having nothing 
 My moms and pops tried they best but I wanted more 
 Niggas rather go shopping, I'm tryna own the store 
 I'm tryna own some more, equity, real estate I'm investing in 
 I go to work like I'm Mexican 
 Always get amnesia when they come in for questioning 
 Looking for medicine 
 Only rookie getting respect from the veterans 
 We was raw measuring, the scale broke, eyeball it 
 You afraid of contact, nobody fouled you so why call it? 
 Money flowing, I was staring at that white Taurus 
 Fiji bottles, I'm bougie, please get the white water 
 Went from a dime to a five after the lights caught her 
 Miami, we made a movie, I think I like Florida

 I get to confessing my love 
 And you start to wonder expressing your questions 
 Like why? Why? 
 I get to confessing my love 
 And you start to wonder expressing your questions 
 Like why? Why?
