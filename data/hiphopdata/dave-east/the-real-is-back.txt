Nah, no I'm not 
 Nah, nobody on this 
 You know how that go 
 Dave East 
 Now I'm living with a purpose, I ain't perfect 
 Allah got me, ain't spend too much time in churches 
 This from the heart, I ain't spend too much time rehearsing 
 I was really thinking rob before I purchased 
 I was really thinking God these niggas thirsty 
 Paranoid around soft niggas, they make me nervous 
 Clutching a pistol around these clowns that shit'll surface 
 If you knew my life you would understand I deserve it 
 Nobody gave me shit, told me I was worthless 
 Felt like I was cursed until the day that paper surfaced 
 It's a reason why me and Beans can relate in person 
 I'm cut from that cloth, all that talking'll get you murdered 
 I relaxed on that juice, them percocets be testing me 
 Plus your bitch keep texting me, I ain't attracted sexually 
 These niggas selling blow up, got the fiends frustrated 
 Tryna get this dough up, package on me, ratchet on me 
 Tell me what your life like cause mines is real 
 Every thing signed and sealed, my mind on pills 
 Niggas'll rat on they own mother, they see that time get real 
 Teddy bears and candle lightings give your moms the chills

 As far as I can remember I've been a real one 
 They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none 
 Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one 
 You said you wanted the real back well here it come 
 Beanie Sigel 
 Pressure's on once again but I embrace it 
 I weathered through the storm before, I'm never breaking 
 I do this for the youth in the Matrix who won't make it 
 I tell 'em every knock is a boost, remain patient 
 But every move he make is calculated through his hunger 
 It's sad to say shorty might not make it through the summer 
 His mom turned tricks for a fix, pills strung her 
 He only met his pop for flicks and a jail jumper 
 His stomach empty but his clip full 
 He pop xannies by the fist full 
 Drink syrup, skip school 
 Pants hanging off his ass, ain't been in the bath 
 I try to steer 'em right 'cause I hate to see him crash 
 Tell him just stay in his lane and remain humble 
 You bound to get hit in the game just don't fumble 
 I seen G's drop the ball and straight crumble 
 Just know if your aunt had a dick she'd be your uncle 
 What your life like nigga mines is real 
 No if, mights, maybes, probably, wills 
 I blow your fucking head off with that revolver steel 
 I shot a nigga on tour, got that revolver still 
 Know when you fucking with the Bully you involved with real 
 I put your body somewhere, they won't solve your kill nigga 
 You need to stop if you think Mac won't pop it 
 Have your mom in all black out casket shopping

 It's the Broadstreet Bully and Dave East, yeah we playing for keeps 
 These niggas dressing like freaks and they calling it fleek 
 These niggas be signing sheets plus they calling police 
 Know every nigga in the ghetto ain't involved in the streets 
 We ain't really into the games we gon' rest you to peace 
 Pull something big out, give you a long kiss on the cheek 
 Who ready to die? 
 Sky's the limit 
 who want beef? 
 I was a bad boy before I repped the ROC 
 This ain't nothing new 
 shit this just what the fuck we do 
 We like no limit soldiers 
 and nigga I'm that true 
 The reason, the solution 
 nigga I'm that too 
 Whoever stuck to the realness, then I'm that glue 
 It's a war going on outside you ain 
 t safe fr' 
 om 
 You can play Super man, you get your cape hung 
 We don't start no shit 
 and we don't take none 
 We just 100% 
 until our day come
