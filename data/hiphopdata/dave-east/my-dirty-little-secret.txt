I'm just tryin' to figure it out 
 It's a lot comin' with this shit 
 Lose a lot 
 Gain a lot 
 Like it's written in Chinese it's hard to read her 
 I poured an 8th in a liter knocking Aaliyah 
 It's funny I fell in love with her Instagram 
 I'm picturing how I'ma fuck her, If I get to meet her 
 I don't get to nap 
 What you do for a living? 
 Shit, my business rap 
 I'm outta town all the time, let me know if you can get with that 
 In 5 minutes flat I bag an ounce up, I was in the trap 
 It's funny that ones that was closest don't even give me dap 
 You claim you want me, that's something that you just gotta prove 
 A lot a dudes in Gucci uniforms like it's private school 
 Crazy me wearing these red-bottoms, done brought 'em out the blue 
 Young rich nigga, probably find me where Stella got her groove 
 Feel like I got her, so now I just gotta follow through 
 She telling me if we was together, I'd have to follow rules 
 I'mma see you, when I'mma see you, I make a lot of moves 
 I don't need you but I might keep you 
 What do I gotta prove? 
 Don't nobody know we speaking 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it 
 You could be my little secret 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it 
 If I'm workin' then I'm workin' 
 If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin' 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 She said she never heard my music but her brother on it 
 She got me thinkin' 'bout it if I'ma put a rubber on it 
 If I ain't wakin' up to her message it's just another mornin' 
 She really my type because she think love is boring 
 I don't know if it's the jewelry or the cash 
 That made her respond to me so fast 
 She ain't never asked me nothin' 'bout my past 
 Speeding I'm trying to look through her pictures 
 I almost crashed 
 Digital Dash, foreign whip, I took a Florida Trip 
 Me and my daughter, I'm getting messages from this foreign chick 
 She keep complimenting my jewelry she think I'm more than rich 
 So I'ma fuck her wearing my jewelry, I'm on some border shit 
 Online shopper, she don't go out she just order kicks 
 I just hope she suck a mean dick and put cheese on her grits 
 Older women love me the youngins too, I'm running through 
 I panicked, she ain't post a picture in over a month or two 
 Don't nobody know we speaking 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it 
 You could be my little secret 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it 
 If I'm workin' then I'm workin' 
 If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin' 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 It's hard to trust' 'em nowadays 
 They come with foul ways 
 Thirsty for satisfaction 
 She doin' it for a caption 
 I rather be drunk somewhere relaxin' 
 I gave six all my jewelry 
 I don't trust her, he started laughing 
 Like this the shorty, you been talking bout and showing us 
 I'm growing up, no more Keisha's nigga 
 I'm blowing up 
 I don't trust her enough to pass the weed I be rolling up 
 I could have her on the beach in Belize sipping coconuts 
 Hood shit, Hennessy shots until she throwing up 
 Time to see what that mouth 'bout 
 She already done smoked enough 
 Telling me with her last Nigga with head is how she woke him up 
 Wonder why I'm not going to cuff? 
 Mammie you must be smoking dust 
 Don't nobody know we speaking 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it 
 You could be my little secret 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it 
 If I'm workin' then I'm workin' 
 If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin' 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Don't nobody gotta know
