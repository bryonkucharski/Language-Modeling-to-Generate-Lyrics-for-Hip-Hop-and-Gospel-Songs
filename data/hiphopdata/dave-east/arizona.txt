Dave East 
 Reggie came from Arizona 
 All the whips imported from Germany 
 Think you're smart, then come play the corner 
 Guarantee your bitches done heard of me 
 They told me jail the closest thing to hell 
 I spoke to the devil right there in my cell 
 Called my mother, told bully go get my bail 
 Smart kid, bad decisions, should've went to Yale 
 A hundred baggies and a digi scale 
 My pops telling me stories about rich and fritz 
 The son of Sam, this gun jammed, get pistol whipped 
 My cousin playing cards with the lifers 
 Come to Harlem, I can show you a movie, don't get excited 
 Reminiscing bout biggavel sipping grand cru 
 I been talking that shit, even your man knew 
 No more Backwoods, roll that Funta with bamboo 
 Busting checks, blow me some sacks, I ran through 
 FDR North exit on 96 
 Block indicted, they raided and found 90 bricks 
 Two fifth, shopping at the mall back in '96 
 Puff and Biggie had the city thinking we could shine again

 Styles P 
 Reggie came from Arizona 
 I'm a Yonkers nigga but I was born out in Corona 
 Always getting money, got weed in California 
 Repping for the spots and niggas out on the corners 
 Got that Beamer coming from Germany 
 Couple niggas praying to murder me 
 I creep in the crib like it's a burglary 
 I ain't a doctor but you know I'm coming for surgery 
 I once seen Satan up in the bullpen 
 Guess I'm like weed to the streets, I stay pulled in 
 I'm just waiting for y'all to exhale 
 Got bricks in the backroom, when's the next sale 
 I made a few mil off of Nextel 
 Could've went to Yale but I didn't get a fresh scale 
 The old one got residue 
 Ghost and East, sucker shit we would never do
