Six million ways to die 
 (Took a lot to get this Rollie nigga) 
 Six million ways to get rich 
 (Huh, hah) 
 Everybody keep telling me "make a club record" 
 You ain't trapping no more, stop making drug records 
 You got a daughter bout to come, stop making thug records 
 I brought that money back fast, I had the plug flexing 
 Welcome to Harlem, el Barrio, that's the drug section 
 Hit your bitch with my jeans on, ain't making love naked 
 I got love for my loco but I know 'cause reckless 
 I ain't gotta sleep in the projects, I did enough stressing 
 My father was a rolling stone but taught me one lesson 
 Do your dirt by yourself, your friends be the ones telling 
 I knew it broke my mother's heart to know her son selling 
 I had coke in my dresser, trifling as ever 
 I had a dream Biggie featured me on Life After 
 I be with my same niggas, I don't really like rappers 
 Niggas can't make a song for nothing but they nice actors 
 Go and get a movie role, low bagging up tuna rolls, raw shit 
 I come from a block where you seen it but never saw shit 
 I be at the juice bar, my wheat grass and bark shit 
 My younging just came from up north, he want to park shit 
 Tryna teach him something bout life and how we started 
 Lower class poverty, homies from jail calling me 
 Playing the number everyday but never hit the lottery 
 Liquor store on every corner, might as well get drunk 
 I remember that free lunch wasn't shooting, we would jump stones 
 Niggas like the end of the blunt, traps load up 
 I told papi I got him by the end of the month 
 I was thinking bout 550's with the cinnamon guts 
 These shots'll blow your mind away, now your memory dust 
 And memory of, I got a JF Kennedy buzz 
 Presidential called enterprise, I need another rental 
 Tryna take a package down to North Carolina 
 Maybe buy some Ferragamo, I'm so focused on the commas 
 If you never been broke it's gon' be hard to feel me 
 Only Allah get my flow, it's gon' be hard to kill me 
 They say practice make perfect, we at it every day 
 Thinking about that consignment, sometimes I never paid 
 It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something 
 Conversations bout paper homie, let's burn something 
 It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something 
 Conversations bout paper homie, let's burn something 
 It's hard to stop what's already in motion 
 I ain't gotta hit your blunt, I've already been smoking 
 G Star denims on my Shmurda shit 
 In '08 my mental was really on some murder shit 
 Cause nothing was working out 
 Just to pass the time started working out 
 Me and my nigga Jay Black from way back 
 He a Bronx nigga, met him in Queens 
 Butch crib, met up with fiends 
 Imagine Nas signed you, hell of a dream 
 Somebody pinch me 
 Promise nothing they say ever getting to me 
 Used to watch House Party, now Kid N Play listen to me 
 This that talk that make the hustlers want to open shop 
 This that stash house talk, don't let 'em know the spot 
 This that talk that got my city wanting to rap again 
 This that all black everything like an African 
 This that middle of the summer in a trench coat 
 Glock 19 reminding them of how you been broke 
 If you never been broke it's gon' be hard to feel me 
 Only Allah get my flow, it's gon' be hard to kill me 
 They say practice make perfect, we at it every day 
 Thinking about that consignment, sometimes I never paid 
 It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something 
 Conversations bout paper homie, let's burn something 
 It was written I'm gifted, homie come learn something 
 Conversations bout paper homie, let's burn something 
 I talked my way right up out the projects nigga 
 Put your mind to it, anything is possible haha 
 From a hole in the wall, yeah 
 Now we in the presidential suite man 
 Top floor, flower for your bust nigga 
 Harlem, yeah
