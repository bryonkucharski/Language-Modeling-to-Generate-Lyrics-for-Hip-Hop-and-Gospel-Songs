I need everything I came for ( 
 Joe Joe got 'em again 
 ) 
 And some 
 Prosper 
 I'm tryna live prosper 
 Prosper 
 I'm tryna live 
 I'm just tryna live 
 I just pray that I'm livin' prosperous 
 Coming from conditions that's moderate to accomplishin' 
 Each goal I ever set that check off my bucket list 
 Know who you fuckin' with, you can't suck it baby just swallow it 
 Prosper, "P" for the pussy been gettin' thrown at me 
 "R" for the Rollie that Nas got me, the sky dweller (my nigga) 
 "O" for the ounces, I drove the most to the mountains (most) 
 "S" is for the sour, I sold to niggas in housing' (got it) 
 "P" is for that pack of that Newports that I couldn't never smoke (never) 
 "E" is for the easy-pass, get nervous when I pass the toll, pack a pole, pack a stick back on my shit 
 I been through the worst, it don't matter shit got me rich 
 Story I could tell, I could still remember the smell 
 Of my cell, thought I was in hell, hit mama for mail 
 I had CO's that I wanted to hurt, I'm speedin' fast, I just wanna reverse 
 Get some fame behind your name and they gon' come at you worse 
 I've seen friends go to the essence, they left blood on my shirt 
 And I can't never get them stains out 
 Try and understand what this pain 'bout 
 Half deaf in my left ear from them shots that done rang out 
 I'm tryna own property, put my daughter through private school 
 Fiends was our neighbors, then mama told us, we gotta move 
 I thought I knew it all, couldn't pay me to follow rules 
 Almost lost my life for some Prada shoes, you gotta choose 
 Is dying worth everything you done lived for? 
 Ran out of Arm and Hammer, get more, was piss poor 
 I can't even add up all the clothing stores we ripped off 
 I gotta get fresh, it was so hard to get them zips off 
 I smoke a lot, see a opp, spot 'em like a polka dot 
 Always in the gutter like I bowl a lot 
 Open up the Rover top, blow up fifty bag to the heavens 
 Kept a mask plus a weapon, I ain't know if I was gon' blow or not 
 I never knew 'bout no fame or no movement (never) 
 Now I'm recruitin' lieutenants, my women friends they was in there boostin' 
 She must of loved me, she put this onion up in the coochie 
 Played games, my youngest one fades and not the one on Boosie 
 Heavenly scented, the Dodger was rented 
 Tryna prosper by any means, I'm Malcolm in a Detroit fitted 
 I got the scars from my life of war 
 I love the rap, but I don't like the talk 
 I get excited if the white is soft (powder) 
 I push the Porsche until the pipes exhaust 
 Ain't got no felonies, get a license for it 
 So many thoughts got me thinkin' like "Shit, I might record this" 
 The couch was leather, the floor was cold and the phone was cordless 
 Talkin' my mother crib, ounces in my dresser 
 The cash in my Timberland box, keep all that extras 
 The one they loved the most, kidnap 'em, they'll get the message 
 Stay down till you come up, you'll get your blessings 
 Is dying worth everything you done lived for? 
 Ran out of Arm and Hammer, get more, was piss poor 
 I can't even add up all the clothing stores we ripped off 
 I gotta get fresh, it was so hard to get them zips off 
 I smoke a lot, see a opp, spot 'em like a polka dot 
 Always in the gutter like I bowl a lot (always) 
 Open up the Rover top (open), blow up fifty bag to the heavens 
 Kept a mask plus a weapon, I ain't know if I was gon' blow or not 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It's the kid with the glow, I get it and go 
 Say I talk fast, you just listenin' slow 
 Prosper 
 You know, get what you gotta get while you here man 
 Do what you do, like you're doing it for TV or 
 You know, whatever you're doing it for man, lotta money to be made, make sure you make it 
 Don't waste no more time, time tickin' 
 I can't even see what time it is on the Philipe, but you know 
 Catch up, what you want, the money or the respect? 
 Pick one 
 Prosper 
 Joe Joe got 'em again
