 Dave East 
 Residue still on my hand 
 It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (I'm back) 
 Your bitch in the back of the Fisker 
 You can't imagine the trenches (Nah) 
 What you know about trappin' and pitchin'? 
 Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley 
 What you know about not havin' a penny? 
 Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly 
 Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet) 
 Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me 
 I woke up this morning with a lot of money 
 I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me 
 On my mama, your honor, I'm not gonna speak on a soul 
 They told me you reap what you sow 
 Ride for my nigga, I'll never forget all the times 
 You took me where I needed to go (Uh) 
 I woke this mornin', like, "Fuck everybody," 
 And that's how I knew that I needed to smoke (Uh) 
 My niggas is felons, you niggas is jealous 
 And y'all just definin' the meaning of broke (Uh) 
 I'm gettin' some brain, I pulled out my chain 
 And she started lookin' like she seen a ghost (Ah!) 
 Diamonds is cold like goin' outside with no jacket 
 And mama say you need a coat (Huh) 
 I do not wanna be stuck in the hood all day 
 I rather go jump off a boat 
 "When the album droppin'?" All they wanna know 
 Two thousand for this Moncler coat 
 Mike Amiri cost me eighteen 
 That ain't no shirt, that was straight jeans 
 Pineapple Fanta when I be on it 
 But my little bitch she drinking straight lean (Uh)

 Residue still on my hand 
 It feel like I'm back in the kitchen 
 Your bitch in the back of the Fisker (In the back) 
 You can't imagine the trenches (Nah) 
 What you know about trappin' and pitchin'? 
 Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley 
 What you know about not havin' a penny? (Uh uh) 
 Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly 
 Wiz Khalifa 
 Ice hash in the bong 
 Take dabs till I'm gone 
 In the basement, growing base 
 This shit is strong like mase 
 Keep a low temp nail 
 'Cause it's all about taste 
 I just did three mil' 
 Did it all in one day 
 Hear 'em talk but I don't believe 'em 
 New car so I'm gonna leave 'em 
 Talk down but they wanna be him-damn 
 They don't go off like Khalifa, man 
 Second grade, had two girlfriends 
 Fifth grade, I was in Japan 
 Now I can never go broke again 
 I ain't need no one to hold my hand 
 (Uh, fuck up off me) 
 If the weed good roll it then 
 Quick to turn a hater to a fan 
 Quick to get another million 
 Quick to spend it all with my fam 
 Quick to tell a nigga who I am 
 Quick to get my niggas out a jam 
 I'mma roll one 
 Pass it around, ain't got lungs 
 You better grow some 
 I remember people lyin' to me 
 Now I force 'em all to stand in line 
 How he got a bed but he lyin'? 
 My nigga don't text me right now I'm too high

 Ph-

 Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet) 
 Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me 
 I woke up this morning with a lot of money 
 I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me 
 On my wrist, I put Patek Philippe now (Yee) 
 Every day we can eat at Phillepe's now 
 It's hard to see through this weed cloud 
 I'm picking up bags when I leave town (Bags) 
 A lot of hammers and a lot of lead 
 A lot of Phantoms and a lot of red (Uh) 
 Without these cameras they'd be probably dead 
 Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds (Whoa) 
 I've been that nigga since Simon Says (Uh) 
 I heard you talk to a lot of feds (Uh) 
 Bring your rent back to Papi and gimme more 
 Fuck the re-up up at the Fendi store (Fendi) 
 Fuck the re-up up on Chanel 
 Fuck the re-up up on Vuitton 
 Last year I bet against the Cavaliers 
 I fucked the re-up on LeBron 
 We ain't lookin' for jobs livin' like the mob 
 Hot temper keepin' it calm 
 See I used to sleep in the slums 
 Now bitches chew me like a piece of some gum 
 Dave East 
 Residue still on my hand 
 It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (I'm back) 
 Your bitch in the back of the Fisker (In the back) 
 You can't imagine the trenches (Never) 
 What you know about trappin' and pitchin'? 
 Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley (In the back) 
 What you know about not havin' a penny? 
 Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly 
 Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet) 
 Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me 
 I woke up this mornin' with a lot of money 
 I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me (A lot) 
 On my wrist I put Patek Philippe now (Yeah) 
 Every day we can eat at Phillepe's now (Everyday) 
 It's hard to see through this weed cloud (Shh) 
 I'm picking up bags when I leave town (Bags) 
 A lot of hammers and a lot of lead 
 A lot of Phantoms and a lot of red (Uh) 
 Without these cameras they'd be probably dead 
 Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds 
 (Percs, Xans, Lean, Percs, Xans...) 
 Without these cameras they'd be probably dead 
 Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds (All the meds) 
 Residue still on my hand (Stick) 
 It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (Right back) 
 Your bitch in the back of the Fisker 
 You can't imagine the trenches (Huh?) 
 Now I got 'em laughing up in the back of the Bentley (Ghrr!) 
 Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly (Bag it up) 
 "Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly" 
 "Phone jumpin'-" 
 "Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly"
