Well look at that, the best of the East. A Philly nigga talking that talk on a Harlem nigga mixtape. All you niggas gonna hate this 
 Dave East, spinning in that foreign with them suede seats 
 Signed a deal with Nas but in the streets, I'm still waste deep 
 I'm just tryna swim out, play that water like Michael Phelps 
 Bullet proof the tint out, Light up before I spin out 
 I fuck with bitches that teach yoga, I'm weed blowing 
 The streets know 'em just keep flowing, that's what Malik told me 
 Right before they caught his body, I'm in your apartment lobby 
 Tryna get these packs off way before I go and talk to Papi 
 New York City, make it here, you make it anywhere 
 Some nights I was really broke, them days I didn't really care 
 Check me out, I ain't in prison, nobody stretched me out 
 Niggas catching head shots like "Homie, what that vest about?" 
 Trip to Baltimore, I got some work I let 'em test it out 
 We back and forth silver spring, my cousin's selling weapons now 
 Couldn't make this up, they let bully go then locked profit 
 Ravenswood the cops watch us, surviving off of Hot Pockets 
 I fell in love with selling kush, I got my youngins straight 
 Feel like I ain't ate in days, codeine help my stomach ache 
 The offense triangle, they need a better defense 
 I had the Jeep, would go to Richmond almost every weekend 
 I never seen Shook graduated from Springbrook 
 College dropout, hit the trap, I know how them fiends look 
 Roll the blue carpets out, it's money what we talking bout 
 They hate the clothes that I wear, they hate the hoes I brought around 
 Hate that I was nice at ball, they hate that I can talk that shit 
 Hate that I got passport stamps from taking awesome trips 
 Think they hate me now, wait till I park the ghost 
 I feel like I should call my coach, laughing while I'm coughing smoke 
 I don't know where the hate started. What you thought we were gonna stop now? Nah, we can't stop now, I love this shit too much. Dave East
