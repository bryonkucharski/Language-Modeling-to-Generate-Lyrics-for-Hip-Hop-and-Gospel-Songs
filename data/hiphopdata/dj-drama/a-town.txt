 Adamville, Alley Temple 
 Nigga A Town, aye and I said 
 I jumped off the post Center Hill I was seven then 
 Moved to College Park at eleven started sellin' wit 
 It started sinkin' in, they really gave my uncle ten 
 Now what I'm 'posed to do? Get a crew and start hustlin' 
 Now we trappin' up on Campbellton, ask 'em, they remember me 
 We used to move that work from Oak City way to Kimberly 
 Took the hustle out that Riverdale, made a killin' G 
 Brought it back to Bankhead, where I'm gon' see it till it's history 
 On the Westside trillin' up, Zone 3 fillin' up 
 Herndon Homes, Bowen Homes, Harvel Homes, fillin' up 
 Ain't nobody trill as us, Bankhead really fucked 
 That's why my Dayton rims make yo' rims look like titty fuck 
 Listen up, only nigga in the South they talkin' 'bout 
 Put your bitch out on the expressway make her walk it out 
 A Town showin' up, Fulton County veteran 
 Spread all the way too Tennessee 
 You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop 
 And we forever stay down that why we on top

 Nigga A Town, aye and I said 
 Straight from Decatur, an Eastside mayne 
 From Glenwood to County Road niggas gettin' paid 
 From Weslyn Chapel back to Covington Highway 
 I still pull up just like in my driveway 
 Ya can't do a song about the A without me 
 See I was gettin' money while they was in car seats 
 See I was in the street, shawty totin' that heat 
 Throw the E's in they face and let 'em know I'm 'bout heat 
 You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop 
 And we forever stay down that why we on top 
 Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's

 Adamville, Alley Temple 
 Nigga A Town, aye and I said 
 I'm a '82 grady baby, young twenty six 
 ATL, Dirty South, I played in the grit 
 This was 'round the time when niggas first saw bricks 
 Back when Ronald Reagan was the president and shit 
 Drama had a house right off of Hollywood Road 
 (Westside) 
 They was robbin' and tastin' Hollywood coke 
 Mama say we movin' 
 When she get a lil' mo' paper she enrolled me into school 
 But it will weigh out in Decatur 
 This was 'round the time when Elay Meadows was the ghetto 
 And I was sleepin' with the rats and roach gloss on my pillow 
 When niggas rolled hammers down Calabenki 
 Put that Ghetto Mafia back in I'ma fizz off 
 Back when niggas didn't know shit about a cigarillo 
 I was gettin' my grind on flat shows at the 
 (Unverified) 
 To get the TV that's challengin' 
 Then you wide skirt niggas ain't real as me 
 You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop 
 And we forever stay down that why we on top 
 Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's 
 I don't give a damn how many records I sold
