Yeah, Willie The Kid 
 Bright lights, street lights 
 Summertime in apartment 409 
 Had to clean up the kitchen with 409 
 It was cookin' up work, while my granny at work 
 My big 'cause, he ain't understand me at first 
 He said the court room or the casket 
 I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit 
 The street lights where I found my strength 
 Be with four rich men and you bound to be the fifth 
 Let's go 
 I lost my daddy at a early age 
 Told my mama, don't cry for me 
 If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday 
 Oh, how much different my life would be 
 But that's in my dreams, back to reality 
 Tryna get outta these street lights 
 So I won't have to live this street life 
 No more, no more 
 No more, no more, no 
 Just gotta learn to deal with problems 
 If you're young and from slum with no father 
 Got killed when you was little, still got mama 
 She try to tell him go to school but why bother 
 When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em 
 Seems the stars get farther and farther 
 Out of my reach, out of these streets 
 Will they ever make it big? 
 'Cause I lost my daddy at a early age 
 Told my mama, don't cry for me 
 If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday 
 Oh, how much different my life would be 
 But that's in my dreams, back to reality 
 Tryna get outta these street lights 
 So I won't have to live this street life 
 No more, no more 
 No more, no more, no 
 I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear 
 Thinkin' 'bout my dad, I wish I had him back 
 I'd give up everythin' just to have him here 
 After this storm and rain I have no fear 
 Gotta keep holdin' on, hold my head up strong 
 I know it won't be long 
 (I'm livin' for the moment) 
 Until we'll be together again, fo real 
 (If I could turn back the days) 
 (Sure you could turn this back) 
 Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker 
 Daddy wasn't in the crib, that made me tougher 
 Momma struggled with the bills, that made me stuff up 
 Powder in a sack which made me dumber 
 Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of marijuana, crack 
 Pistol in my pocket for anybody who disrespect 
 In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers kick it at 
 My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in 
 Ha, bet that I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers 
 Show these niggas what I'm best at 
 Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that 
 Years later, oh now you see what my heads at 
 Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at 
 You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at 
 You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that 
 If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon' respect that 
 I lost my daddy at a early age 
 Told my mama, don't cry for me 
 If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday 
 Oh, how much different my life would be 
 But that's in my dreams, back to reality 
 Tryna get outta these street lights 
 So I won't have to live this street life 
 No more, no more 
 No more, no more, no 
 Guess this is my life and I wanna live it right 
 I don't wanna run the streets no more, no 
 Guess this is my life and I wanna live it right 
 I don't wanna run the streets no more, no
