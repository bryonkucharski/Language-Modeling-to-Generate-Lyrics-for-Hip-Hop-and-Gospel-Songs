(Chorus - LA the Darkman) 
 Makin' money smokin' weed nigga front a nigga bleed makin' money fuckin' hoes nigga that's just how it goes 
 Makin' money smokin' weed nigga front a nigga bleed makin' money fuckin' hoes nigga that's just how it goes 
 (Verse 1 - Willie the Kid) 
 This ain't rap it's a drive-by 
 This shit is real catch ya man slipin' walkin' outta Popeyes 
 The bullets fly through yo' bag fly through yo' drink 
 The bullets cut a man down, blood on your mink 
 There's blood in the street, you see the crowd formin' 
 You had a show for the the crowd, you puttin' on a performance 
 Take a bow, it's kinda hard you on the ground twitchin' 
 Your brotha hopin' you recover, downtown snitchin' 
 "I know who did it, them niggas from the other side, 
 They recognize my face, and know ma brother ride" 
 Meanwhile in the hood Chevy's still rollin', the fiends still smokin' 
 The cops still patrollin', sing sing is the shooters, the gargoyles 
 How you want it you can get it beef charbroiled 
 The Mongolian, we get them forties in 
 Down South traffickin', bring your homie in 
 {Makin' money smokin' weed nigga front a nigga bleed makin' money fuckin' hoes nigga that's just how it goes}x4 
 (Verse 2 - Willie the Kid) 
 Welcome to the Midwest, firearm central 
 Mad traphouses, and dope fiend rentals 
 In the club stuntin', we sweatin' mad bitches 
 Airbrushed 2Pac, backdrop pictures 
 Flick it up homie, lift it up homie 
 Hennesy it's a tab, pick it up homie 
 You pick it up nigga, I ain't payin' for shit 
 I'll see you outside I'm sprayin' ma shit 
 {Makin' money smokin' weed nigga frontin' nigga bleed makin' money fuckin' hoes nigga that's just how it goes}x4 
 (Verse 3 - Willie the Kid) 
 All I see is money, weed, and crack 
 Police cars and guns 
 Leather coats and Cartiers, Air Ones 
 Where I'm from it's real, for the cromas we kill 
 For a piece of the pie, somebody gotta die 
 And not to mention the whole thing 
 A ki lloyd buck fifty yo' face, no cold creme 
 It's mad obituaries, printed up like Kinko's 
 We gettin' money, gettin' high, nigga poppin' click o 
 {Makin' money smokin' weed nigga frontin' nigga bleed makin' money fuckin' hoes nigga that's just how it goes}x4 
 (Outro - DJ Drama) 
 See it used to be money, power, respect 
 Now it's money, power, respect, and hip hop 
 And it take a nation of millions to hold us back 
 Call me public enemy number one 
 Nigga, AMG, Embassy 
 This is how it's done
