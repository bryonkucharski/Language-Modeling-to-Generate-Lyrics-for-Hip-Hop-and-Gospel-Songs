Testing one, two, three... Akon and YB... 
 Lock down time to make my block proud 
 California own twenty four I will watch now 
 There's been a take over baby hostile 
 Yeah the young cali convict got the rock now 
 I hear the rumors saying that I'm just pop now 
 Like they never heard a hood nigga with a hot style 
 I got the hills to burns and the block now 
 Old bitchs wanna holla at me 'cause I'm hot now 
 I gotta new bitch sitting in my drop now 
 Song on the radio album bout to drop now 
 Music lives in California livin' proof 
 Ya boy to rock a Konvict, what it do 
 I been had with these other niggas gettin' to 
 Take ya girl home and make her earn all them gemmy jewels 
 I hope you like heat 'cause it's hot in the kitchen boo 
 Do you have service, am I gettin' through 
 Hey, I know you heard we got the drop now 
 Konvicts supplyin niggas round the clock now 
 Gettin' money am I forced to put the glock down 
 Glock Down, Glock Down 
 We expanded all the pipes now 
 And I'm a get accustomed to this lifestyle 
 No more spending all my cons tryin' to fight trials 
 Lock Down, Lock down 
 Cause victory is my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Cause victory all is my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Eh 
 Another watch, another chain, another charm cocked 
 Time to wake these niggas up like alarm clocks 
 I see 'em hatin' so we gotta keep the arms cocked 
 I'm the reason CA on storm watch 
 It's bout to get ugly no whoopie gold 
 Superstar still in the kitchen whippin Os 
 Toss it to my youngest call me when you get it gone 
 Fuck a rap nigga we about to get it on 
 I'm speaking fo California from the top down 
 Holla at Ya Boy I got it locked down 
 I tried to tell 'em this foreva like a diamond 
 I'm so hot shawty I could change the climate 
 Hey, I know you heard we got the drop now 
 Konvicts supplyin niggas round the clock now 
 Gettin' money am I forced to put the glock down 
 Glock Down, Glock Down 
 We expanded all the pipes now 
 And I'm a get accustomed to this lifestyle 
 No more spending all my cons tryin' to fight trials 
 Lock Down, Lock down 
 Cause victory is my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Cause victory is all my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Eh 
 And as days pass by like a G7 
 And all my hustlas on the corner of 7/11 
 Po alert on the ground and I start reppin 
 For all the homies layin down restin up in heaven 
 And I hope you watchin down 
 And proud of how we just locked it down 
 Don't let nothin' stop the cash or get caught up 
 In the streets that's how we brought up 
 I'm from a city where the fiends shoot up and spark 
 Load up the ammo it's time to shoot up the charts 
 Game cold baby you might need a scarf 
 Rockstar but I'm riddin like noah's ark 
 Louis shades, dolce and gabana cloth 
 Your girl know I stay fly like santa clause 
 On the road with a trunk full of Asher Roth 
 We gon pop rose when the package off 
 I swear to god I went and got the bay crackin' y'all 
 But I could'ntdo it without LA backin though 
 Niggas say they gon get me, I laugh it off 
 'Cause they know I keep shooters like basketball 
 Lock it down make Kon through away the key 
 Real nigga, record deal ain't changin me 
 It took a while but we still got from a to z 
 I put in work nigga what you gotta say to me 
 Hey, I know you heard we got the drop now 
 Konvicts supplyin niggas round the clock now 
 Gettin' money am I forced to put the glock down 
 Glock Down, Glock Down 
 We expanded all the pipes now 
 And I'm a get accustomed to this lifestyle 
 No more spending all my cons tryin' to fight trials 
 Lock Down, Lock down 
 Cause victory is my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Cause victory is all my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Cause victory is all my my my my my my my my my mine 
 Cause victory is all my my my my my my my my my mine
