(Verse 1: Roscoe Dash) 
 I got sand all by my bath water 
 Candles by my wine glass 
 Women all on my time 
 Imagine how my time pass 
 They say them freaks come out at night 
 And you know who they came to see 
 Even though she ain't mine 
 I fucked her like her man to be 
 So many girls in here tonight 
 So many girls in here tonight 
 I'm just lookin' for the right one 
 Exotic as they might come 
 Better leave with two cause really I don't like one 
 So many girls in here tonight 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 Light skin, dark skin 
 Sit your fine ass right there 
 Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end 
 Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever 
 Make no promises but promise I could fuck you better 
 Fuck that singing shit, I be the shit 
 That YM, too legit to quit 
 You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and serena shit 
 I'm all up up on my ladies chick 
 She saying it's the greatest dick 
 I one-two stroke her 
 We caught up in the moment, ayeee 
 T-t-turn up, V12 and I burn up 
 My chick that fly bitch 
 And your bitch unheard of 
 4AM and we still poppin' bottles 
 Probably have a new chick tomorrow 
 Cause there's so many 
 (Verse 3: Wale) 
 My problems in this pitcher 
 Got a bucket full of liquor 
 And I know y'all got that bad bitch 
 But ya got way too many nigga's 
 What's your phone numb... 
 Tyga got some roll up 
 Loud pack with your bad ass 
 Cause these good girls just ain't no fun 
 Double cup and I'm slowed up 
 Smokin' dub with my chauffeur 
 Sneaka fly, hitta stylin' 
 I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up 
 New York and my slow bucks 
 DC got that old cup 
 Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks 
 Straight shot sipper 
 I ain't mixing my liquor 
 Bitch I'm not kidding 
 Y'all some Fisher-Price nigga's 
 And we some life livers 
 Hoping that this life give us 
 A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us 
 Ambition
