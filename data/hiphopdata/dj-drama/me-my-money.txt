Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Now the suckas on the side 
 Lookin' mighty jealous 
 I'm ridin' wit the fellas 
 Only 22inch propellers 
 It ain't nothin' you can tell us 
 Your girl tryna get near it 
 You talk a lot, I can't hear it 
 She's curious and I'm serious 
 Drop by in a drop benz 
 So get money till the world ends 
 So still face I won't been 
 So get a ring and call the fellas 
 'Cause me and money go together 
 We go anywhere the money let us 
 I love her like my favorite sweater 
 Me and money got a sick bun 
 I'm out these sick stones 
 Got me all these bad hoes 
 Got me out on six bunz 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her (loved her since I first met her) 
 If you touch her I get jealous (if you touch her I get jealous) 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Started this shit out on holy matrimony 
 If we break up she gon' charge me alimony 
 And if they find out our hideout spot in the country 
 I'ma have to move her to another country 
 And it no secret, they know I'm gettin' money 
 Boy take beef for me an' you know I'm gettin' money 
 I came ready to play like superbowl Sunday 
 Laughin' all the way to the bank like I shit funny 
 I play the cards I was dealt like in gin rummy 
 But its trumped so you know I gotta go for doubles 
 Me and money tell the truth we make a good couple 
 Break her wit my girlfriend then I'm in trouble 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 She my girlfriend so we sleep together 
 Got a hundred grand in my fuckin' pillow 
 And if I have a problem than I go and get her 
 But tell the truth you know I'm right here rhymin' wit her 
 She stay wit me sunny or rainy weather 
 She really help a nigga get his life together 
 My money, I hope you'll be my wife forever 
 Make a hater sick, he'll have to take an alka-seltzer 
 Baby we gon' tie the knot like a fuckin' pretzel 
 Make a hundred mil' and tell them they can have the extra 
 Take a picture wit my girl, don't we look successful 
 I keep that bitch wit me so my life is never stressful 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her 
 Me and money go together 
 Loved her since I first met her 
 If you touch her I get jealous 
 She do just what I tell her
