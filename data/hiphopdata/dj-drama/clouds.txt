(Hook: Miguel) 
 I wanna kiss your mind, babe 
 Let's take a walk on the clouds 
 Let me taste your thoughts, babe 
 Let's take a walk on the clouds 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Last night I fell asleep counting a million cash 
 Life wild, I only smile when I see my stash 
 Large yacht, fast money, she need a slow cruise 
 Cigar, ciroc, her nigga old news 
 Old money always put me on my new shit 
 Hermes ahead in my to-do list 
 Rollin' up a laugh, take a walk in the clouds 
 Take a look at my niggas, young, rich and we wild 
 Ain't no bitches allowed, acting like snitchin' us out 
 Got this gold on my neck, we teachin' new principles now 
 Startin' the Lotus, revvin' the motors 
 Walk on the clouds, we ain't second to no one 
 (Verse 2: Pusha T) 
 I got you walkin' on cloud nine 
 Your shoe collection not as proud as mine 
 You only second to my first love, pie 
 But just refer to her as alpine 
 Alpina, the B7 on beach headin' 
 Like you riding on first class to reach heaven 
 Close enough to see the gates open 
 Waterfront, you gon' wonder if the lakes open 
 Balconies have you bend over 
 Chanel samples being sent over 
 Shit, I swear she was goin' for me 
 Right, just keep it tight and keep it warm for me 
 (Verse 3: Curren$y) 
 I could never go broke what my name is ??? 
 I'm a brand, I'm a man who became rich 
 New car, new crib, but I ain't a switch 
 The same old niggas I been with 
 Got this loot together sayin' ones gon spend it 
 Circle of winners baby girl I done brung you in it, ??? 
 No iPhone pictures, you gotta live off memory 
 Pop the hood I show you the engine 
 Roll through my old hood, Put you up on my history 
 Smoke joints with my niggas, and cash stunts on them bum ass niggas 
 I don't deal with, with a ??? 
 ???, But they can't reach us 
 We in the God ceilings, cathedral-style homes 
 Rosaries in my Rolls Royce, God put me on 
 Rollin' somethin' choice, lighten up RAW cones ??? 
 She never won' come down, I promise her she won't
