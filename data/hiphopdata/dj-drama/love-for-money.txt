 I got the love for money 
 I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish 
 Gotta get that green paper stacking 
 (Love for money) 
 I, I, I, I gotta have it 
 I, I, I, I got the love for money 
 I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish 
 Gotta get that green paper stacking 
 (Love for money) 
 I, I, I, I gotta have it 
 I, I, I, I got the love for money 
 Chillin' with two women, me and mister thanksgiving 
 I'll be some where fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimming 
 While you was wearing snorkels, I was out snorkeling 
 Of course I'm shit on these niggas like porcelain 
 It's more than love with this money I'm infatuated 
 Captivated by the diamonds and capsulated 
 Shooting range in the basement, Olympic size pool 
 With pool table adjacent, I love me some money 
 I stash money fast money 
 Comin' on bumpin' them onions 
 Bunking and crossing the country 
 So, so don't cross me you monkey 
 Sleeping on 50s and 20 
 Rollin' up onions and hundreds, pulling in porches 
 And phantoms, fancies be throwing their panties 
 Drama and cannon demand it 
 Gucci and Drama they panic 
 Ugh, they sick they vomit 
 Put some more commas in front of it 
 Drama got Gucci he stuntin' 
 Gucci and Drama we done it 
 We got so much money, 'bout our money 
 Some money mo' money, dummy 
 I got the love for money 
 I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish 
 Gotta get that green paper stacking 
 (Love for money) 
 I, I, I, I gotta have it 
 I, I, I, I got the love for money 
 I, I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish 
 Gotta get that green paper stacking 
 (Love for money) 
 I, I, I, I gotta have it 
 I, I, I, I got the love for money 
 Uh, money gotta big house, money got a bad girl 
 Money make you famous, money rule the whole world 
 Money set trends, money is in the Benz 
 Money got associates acting like friends 
 Money, money he owe money money he blow 
 Money got sexy ladies dancing on da pole 
 Money got dem on a stroll, money platinum and gold 
 Money make 'em shake it like Beyonce Knowles 
 Only God knows the things I do for money 
 That's a young fly man 
 Check out them dimensions, 20s, 50s and 100s 
 Don't you make me look good when you see us out stuntin'? 
 Catch a whif, find out that's yo' bitch 
 Catch her pushin' your wheel, then the go and pushing clips 
 She got me going crazy I'm coo coo for boucoup bucks 
 Plus I can't lie, boo, it's only you I love 
 I got the love for money 
 I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish 
 Gotta get that green paper stacking

 I'm 'bout my instrument, I'm 'bout my doe 
 I'm on my hustle 
 (Man) 
 You already know. 
 I'm getting stacks, I'm hitting lick 
 I'm packing pounds and bagging bricks 
 You got them [unverified], I gotta laugh 
 You talking Oz but selling halves 
 Where your connect? How much you got? 
 That's all he holdin'? Man, I buy him out 
 I got the love for money

 Gotta get that green paper stacking
