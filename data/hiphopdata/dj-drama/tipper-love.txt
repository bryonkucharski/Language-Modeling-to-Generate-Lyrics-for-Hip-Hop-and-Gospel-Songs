I, I know that you've been holding that bag for me 
 Yes, she spoils me like I'm a baby 
 And she holds nothing back from me 
 So on? nights, I'm her baby 
 She's pushing her body like a glock 
 Making that tick go tock (yep) 
 She twist at twelve, down to the ground 
 And she doin' it all night long for the boys 
 She do it nice and low 
 But just for the boy 
 Two free songs 
 But just for the boy 
 I call her boomerang 
 When she doing her thang 
 She throw it, then she bring it right back 
 It's her and patrone, all night long 
 But just for the boy 
 I get tipper love 
 Spent so much, that the girls just show me love now 
 She show me tipper love 
 Spent so much that I only pull out dubs now 
 She show me tipper love 
 I ain't saying I'm a freak, but I gotta see her face 
 Twice a week now 
 She show me tipper love 
 She don't mind, even if I come through at night time 
 She give me tipper love 
 She give me tipper love 
 Soon as I walk in this (motha, Fucka) 
 You already know that I'm the (motha, Fucka) 
 I'm looking at her booty like (motha, Fucka) 
 Them haters lookin' at me like, you (motha, Fucka) 
 She's pushing her little body like a glock 
 Making that tick go tock (yep) 
 She twist at twelve, down to the ground 
 And she doin' it all for the boys 
 She do it nice and low 
 But just for the boy 
 She give me two free songs 
 But just for the boy
