Shirley temple on ice, 
 She makes it just right, 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her body's so tight, up under that light, 
 I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me windin up 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 Yeah, she got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, that pipe) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, that pipe) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, that pipe) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, that pipe) 
 5 foot 8 on the late what a date, she fell for the hook and the bait, 
 I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak 
 Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape 
 What a night no more drama, just late night thrills 
 Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz 
 Fillin out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville, 
 Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)

 I'm looking at the most beautiful thang in the world (world, world, world) 
 Her body's so perfect and spinin like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl) 
 She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural) 
 This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal 
 She's like what I'm sippin on Shirley temple on ice, 
 She makes it just right, 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her bodies so tight, up under that light, 
 I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes 
 Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream 
 Her 'n' her girls on the stage doin' they thing 
 Double D's full of silicon and saline 
 She thirty but look only a day over 18 
 Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string 
 Hey gon put that ass on me like a bee sting 
 Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine 
 And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine 
 You see her face now 
 I make everybody throw they cash 
 I back in the club already she been stuck in my head since last night 
 That's right 
 Girl you got my drink so 
 Sexy when I sleep 
 No mo fanatsies 
 I want the real thang
