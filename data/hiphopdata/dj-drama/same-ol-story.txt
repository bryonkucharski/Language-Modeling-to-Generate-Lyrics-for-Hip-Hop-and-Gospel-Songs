It feel like the same old story, everywhere that I go 
 And I don't really wanna do it all again tomorrow 
 So I'm trying to find something brand new 
 I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new 
 It feel like the same old bitches, same old haters 
 See me in the club, wanna come sit at my table 
 I'm trying to find something brand new 
 I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new 
 Motherfucker 
 No handouts for no niggas 
 No handouts for no bitches 
 Killed the underground with my lifestyle 
 I'll let y'all fucks be the witness 
 But I'm losing my mind 
 On the block like 9 and a 9 
 Well until it got pined 
 You ain't know that it's something about time? 
 We didn't care about that 
 Remember the time I said I rapped? 
 Then the niggas came after 
 Even the hoes was full of laughter 
 Flew back to the booth, went harder 
 Now node your heads to the product 
 Suck a nigga dick like he hotter 
 Slinky on the booty like your father 
 Beard look like Osama 
 Don't talk to me less about commas 
 Real shit, Go time get a meal tip 
 Save your compliments for the comments 
 Getting money is my assignment 
 Will still be in the set... 
 No handouts for no niggas 
 No handouts for no bitches 
 Killed the underground with my lifestyle 
 I'll let y'all fucks be the witness 
 But I'm losing my mind 
 On the block like 9 and a 9 
 Well until it got pined 
 You ain't know that it's something about time? 
 We didn't care about that 
 Remember the time I said I rapped? 
 Then the niggas came after 
 Even the hoes was full of laughter 
 Flew back to the booth, went harder 
 Now node your heads to the product 
 Suck a nigga dick like he hotter 
 Slinky on the booty like your father 
 Damn, these niggas hating, I can't understand 
 I'm your favorite's favorite, you the fan of a fan 
 I feel like if I fall off this boat I could walk 
 Y'all rap, Cory Gunz talk what he talk 
 Shorty said she coming, she bringing a friend 
 They ain't smoking with me, though, 'cause they didn't put in 
 Bitch, I be touring with Tunechi and Mack 
 Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back 
 How many niggas you know chill on the block with they fam and 
 Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon 
 Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal 
 Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille 
 No handouts for no niggas 
 No handouts for no bitches 
 Killed the underground with my lifestyle 
 I'll let y'all fucks be the witness 
 But I'm losing my mind 
 On the block like 9 and a 9

 Slinky on the booty like your father 
 Same old haters, niggas just don't give a fuck 
 Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck 
 Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though 
 Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti 
 Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack 
 Y'all miss Jobs, like Wozniak 
 I make y'all insomniac? 
 No more sleeping, nigga 
 What you thinking, nigga? 
 I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga 
 People figure, 'cause I don't like it unless it's brand new 
 Everything is old news, even all your club clothes 
 Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods 
 Royalty the newest niggas fucking old dudes 
 No handouts for no niggas 
 No handouts for no bitches 
 Killed the underground with my lifestyle 
 I'll let y'all fucks be the witness 
 But I'm losing my mind 
 On the block like 9 and a 9
