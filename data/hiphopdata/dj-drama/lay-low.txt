Bought a brand new loft, five thousand a month 
 Bitch my sour is special, hundred dollars a blunt 
 Only smoke if it's proper, in the words of Big Poppa 
 Rush his ass to the doctors, took the sacks and we shot you 
 Blocka-blocka-bla-blocka, warn his ass with them chopper 
 It'll be a massacre faggot, automatic kicking like soccer 
 Bottles popping it's popping, twenty bitches around us 
 I just slide her the numbers, so if she hit me I count her 
 I canary the pinky, hit her right like winky 
 Got the club looking cloudy, for the love of the stinky 
 In a 600 Benz, a couple bitches they friends 
 And we just getting started, these haters wishing we end 
 Brown nose on these hoes, niggas fishing again 
 Notice she swallow with those, drop like it on her chin 
 Niggas left me for dead, bitch I'm living again 
 Special chopper official, they see my vision again 
 Know it's a party, we see the sparkles, they coming 
 Standing on couches, bitches surround us, we blunting 
 We travel the globe, stop in your town, and run it 
 And you already know, cuff them hoes tonight, we born to run it 
 Because we motherfucking paid hoe (Paid hoe) 
 And all that cream, blow that paper like the haze hoe 
 Life's a beach, I'm in the sun with my shades 
 After the club we take the baddest bitch and lay low 
 Hey hoe (Hey hoe) 
 Hey hoe (Hey hoe) 
 After the club we get the baddest bitch and lay low 
 Hey hoe (Hey hoe) 
 Hey hoe (Hey hoe) 
 After the club we take the baddest bitch and lay low 
 Maserati dipping, wrist cost me a chicken 
 Neck cost a Bentley, think I'm finna have a ticket 
 Got a fetish for Ferraris, and fucking bad bitches 
 Smoke a nigga like I'm Marley all we know is lot of niggas 
 The summer's mine, Jordan number 9 
 I came in balling on these niggas like a young LeBron 
 In front them bitches, hit them on the lot 
 Came in with your main hoe, your? 
 It's Young Chris, eat a dick, we the shit 
 We really balling you just talking about a Stephen Smith 
 I let my money do the talking, I just plead the fifth 
 I'm on my Metro, just call me if you need a brick 
 Know it's a party, we see the sparkles, they coming 
 Standing on couches, bitches surround us, we blunting 
 We travel the globe, stop in your town, and run it 
 And you already know, cuff them hoes tonight, we born to run it 
 Because we motherfucking paid hoe (Paid hoe) 
 And all that cream, blow that paper like the haze hoe 
 Life's a beach, I'm in the sun with my shades 
 After the club we take the baddest bitch and lay low 
 Hey hoe (Hey hoe)

 It's the makie with bacon, all these rappers be hating 
 Spit hella facts, hella facts, got me past immigrations 
 To my Canadian fans, they had me stuck at the border 
 See the brighling, big Bent', I think them bastards is rascist 
 Call me Hussain boy, we be off to the races 
 And no negating Smith & Wesson leave you crusain boy 
 We be up in the clubs, stunting with two chains boy 
 Got it popping, niggas mad, they bitches all up in our faces 
 Got them bottles Rosay, shots of Patron 
 All them chicks take shots to the dome 
 Hit right here trying to follow me home 
 Shots to his Impala, I'm gone 
 Know it's a party, we see the sparkles, they coming 
 Standing on couches, bitches surround us, we blunting 
 We travel the globe, stop in your town, and run it 
 And you already know, cuff them hoes tonight, we born to run it 
 Because we motherfucking paid hoe (Paid hoe) 
 And all that cream, blow that paper like the haze hoe 
 Life's a beach, I'm in the sun with my shades
