I ain't gonna lie, I'm fiendin' 'cause I need it 
 And I'm diggin you a lot, not used to catching feelings 
 But I'm feeling on your spots, no kidding when I hit it 
 I be licking on your spine, playing with your mind 
 I ain't gonna stop when I finish, I be in it 
 I be fucking with the lights on, that's the shit that I'm on 
 Give it all I got, your body and my body 
 We be feelin', scratchin', screamin' 
 (Hey shawty) 
 Where we going, 
 Nobody has to know but you 
 Ain't nobody gon' see you

 Where we going (Ay)

 One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose 
 Always aim high and rarely obey the rules 
 Never tell my business, if I did, it'd make the news 
 They say time is like money, you should come here pay your dues 
 And come and kick, can I get a minute, maybe an hour 
 Would you let me peek my head in for a second while you shower 
 I bet you got some real good power if you feel me 
 I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just what's gon heal me, baby

 I said excuse me, Mrs Officer can you go undercover for me 
 Ain't enough liquor in your cup, let the waitress in then let her pour it, up 
 I'm tryna get you drunk as fuck, take her to my crib then I lock her in them handcuffs 
 Panties off, stupid booty, ready for war: Call Of Duty 
 She said I got the right to remain silent 
 And I gotta give it to her rough but I better not get violent, hah 
 Girl my chain feel like an anchor 
 And when I told you to use your head I ain't want you to be no thinker 
 And we ain't gon' waist this drink up, these haters all like hankers 
 While I'm countin' all this paper, and my ears shine like twinkle 
 Big star, get my car, I valet that 
 You're weak nigga, pussy in the street 'cause you're alley cat 
 And I'm loyal to my fans 'cause I love 'em 
 So girl if you a fan, you can meet me undercover like
