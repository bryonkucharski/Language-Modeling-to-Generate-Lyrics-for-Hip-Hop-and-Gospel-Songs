 I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore) 
 Told you it was gon' cost you (told you) 
 I misplace things, I'm sorry if I lost you 
 Yeah right, I fuck your best friend purposely 
 My hearts teflon how dare you try hurt'n me 
 I fuck shorty you hate, I told her work with me 
 And she do it better than you bitch 
 That's word to me 
 We send the vids to your Facebook 
 I wish I would have seen how your face looked 
 While I'm violating, you're a pretender 
 You caught amnesia, you don't remember 
 Well I got the memory of an elephant 
 I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant. 
 I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore) 
 I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore) 
 Your sister told me you was crying 
 And was feeling like you were dying 
 I told if I said 'I give a fuck' 
 I'd be lying 
 Cupid sent a slug through my shirt 
 Told me if you cross me, my love would reverse 
 Stupid bitch, damn you 
 I'm glad your heart is cripple 
 I can't stand you 
 I was the man who planned to cuff it up 
 But you had dicks on the ceiling, you fucked it up 
 Lying ass hoe 
 I bounce right up, now I'm flying that's low 
 Told you I got the memory of an elephant 
 I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant 
 I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore) 
 I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)
