Quality street, hey, yo, French, music 
 You, you know I'm 'bout that life, right? 
 Pushin' 
 Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love from the hater 
 Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 Ride with my niggers 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love only from the haters 
 My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 With all the smoke get high, high, high 
 Just another day gettin' by, by, by 
 For every brick broke down it's one stepped on 
 For every known rat it's one slept on 
 For every loyal nigger frontin' one kept on 
 For every bitch I showed the way it's when they kept hoein' 
 So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles 
 Let me drop another classic and the tour follows 
 Let's get pissy drunk and let the hoes swallow 
 My niggers embrace guns and ignore Bibles 
 Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines 
 The illusions we can be, you get a law abidin' 
 Better know who that is lookin' in the mirror 
 The truth lies and you still can't see it clear 
 Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love from the hater 
 Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 Ride with my niggers 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love only from the haters 
 My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 With all the smoke get high, high, high 
 Just another day gettin' by, by, by 
 I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone 
 They handin' out football numbers after tappin' your phone 
 Or you're watchin' for the drop 
 As they clap and they chrome 
 Took a brick and I turned it to stone 
 Five into ten, the return of the clones 
 Then took my experience and turned it to poems 
 As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings 
 Panamera blood red symbolized bloodshed 
 Lost lot of niggers, some in club fed 
 Few still reminiscin' in they CL 
 Sellin' Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V12, yeah 
 Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love from the hater 
 Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 Ride with my niggers 
 'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold 
 I'm gettin' love only from the haters 
 My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin' 
 With all the smoke get high, high, high 
 Just another day gettin' by, by, by
