(Master P) 
 Soulja Slim (What's happ'n big round) 
 I'm on my way out that Yole I'm gonna meat ya in that Nolia (Umm huhn) 
 But I'm brangin' my homies from the East Coast wit us (It's cool) 
 If it's any problems we got some straight head bustas ya heard me 
 (Ya know, ya know, ya know) Check it out 
 (Chorus 2X: Krazy) 
 My click you don't want beef wit (beef wit) 
 My heat, niggas I sleep wit (sleep wit) 
 Tank Dogg, niggas I creep wit (creep wit) 
 These niggas head bustas 
 Fuck the feds they can't touch us 
 (Slay Sean) 
 Cars, bracelets, chains we coppin' it all 
 Desperados, you can call Flames, Afficial's my dawgs 
 Ride Jordans, 23's on the truck, screened up 
 Smokin' sticky green, welcome aboard, beam up 
 I'm from Rockaway I used to sit in spots all day 
 Gettin' money, it's funny I'm still the same way 
 Hit chickens take 2 at a time, still pimpin' 
 I'm paralyzed when it comes to these hoes, no feelin's 
 Push cars wit drop ceilin', our money is long 
 No limit is the family y'all, the army is strong 
 Once P gives the O-K I'm droppin' the bomb 
 Cockin' the arm, ain't no way of stompin' this storm 
 (Afficial) 
 A look I'm spazzed out 
 Summertime catch me wit the Jag out 
 I got beef wit niggas I pull that mac out 
 A stick up, I dare y'all niggas to try 
 I shoot a round that slow y'all niggas down like yield signs 
 I'll sell my house and my car before I go broke 
 Play hard, pop fly, & get bitches to jump rope 
 Why you talkin' 'bout them bricks you ain't sold no coke 
 I cop a car off the lot, you sendin' car notes 
 My squad likes to drink, so I buy out the bar 
 Niggas look hard when we slide through like credit cards 
 I get high, smack niggas, & take shit 
 I went to jail for 5 sticks like Double Mint 
 (Afficial (S-Flames)) 
 The bigger the barrol is it's harder to swallow 
 I gotta put you in the creek where the water is shallow 
 Afficial, game over is the law and the motto 
 Put it out for the bitches and the niggas a follow 
 I'm a soldier, it's different when you dealin' wit me 
 Chrome wheels it feel like you ridin' on ski's 
 Ya feel me nigga 
 I'll kidnap and peel you nigga 
 Now you back to yo crib after I kill you nigga 
 I real wit it, niggas feel it, what's the questions about 
 When niggas minds change up when the weapons is out 
 We pullin' 'em out squeeze it not leavin' you breathin' 
 If you hatin' I ain't mad 'cause I'm given you reasons 
 (Afficial) 
 These little niggas ain't ballin' right 
 So guess I gotta call the plays out 
 It ain't thuggin' on the hook unless it come out Krazy's mouth 
 An you know we got 'em thinkin' that them boys is ugly 
 We flip shit up and turn dogs back to puppies 
 (Master P) 
 Find me uptown whodi servin' them vicks 
 I mean millionaire status still runnin' them bricks 
 Homie, Bentley and Hummers you know we bout dat shit 
 We from the dirty, dirty boy so we ice the wrist 
 I mean 20 on chrome just the law of the whips 
 Find us thuggin' in the projects like blood and crips 
 I mean ME and MY NIGGAS WE BE HUSTLIN' TO EAT 
 Cause these no limit soldiers whodi runnin' these streets 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Even though I'm last to speak, look never last to eat 
 If that's them, I blast the heat 
 Slumped inside when I walk past the jeep 
 You know Silkk does not look havin' that 
 I tell 'em a new nigga in town dawg & I won't half of that 
 You can act up, you know what's the aftermath 
 We done wit your chick, we finished wit her, you can have her back 
 You know it's nothin' bout doubtin' us when ever you see me 
 Wreck the Bentley next day popped up in a Ashton Martini 
 Niggas know If I got heat on me, they know that I shot it 
 I ain't gotta tell 'em that I got money, they know that I got it 
 Who you know can flip and get rich off of one sell 
 If they gettin' it, shit is over now nigga like 112 
 I do shit by myself, so niggas they won't tell 
 I gotta couple niggas facin' life sentences 
 That a kill you while they on bail 
 The dope game to the rap game switched the game up 
 From Vyshonne to Silkk The Shocker look switched my name up 
 (Soulja Slim) 
 What you think the streets for got about me 
 Shit I'm the streets & I'm the beat 
 An if you got 7-5 I'm that quarter of ki 
 Come and get it, I'm gonna serv ya somethin' proper, uncut 
 Ain't No limit over here dawg, excuse me back the fuck up 
 I smoke camels 'cause I'm penitentiary, get high of sticky 
 Ever now and then might sip a little henney 
 My dawg Chill just got out and got these niggas spooked 
 Oh scary ass niggas, we don't do the thangs we used to do 
 So be cool cause 
 (Chorus: Krazy) 
 My click you don't want beef wit (beef wit) 
 My heat, niggas I sleep wit (sleep wit) 
 Tank Dogg, niggas I creep wit (creep wit) 
 These niggas head bustas 
 Fuck the feds they can't touch us 
 My click you don't want beef wit
