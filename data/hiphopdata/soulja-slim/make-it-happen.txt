 (Soulja Slim) 
 Now let's get it started, I fuck shit up on tha Bacardi 
 You can call it, I be damned if I dat one dearly departed 
 Glock forty wit 2 other clips stuck beside me 
 I call tha canon, new and improved dog bitch for tha 90's 
 I keeps it real, niggas don't wanna let me ball and chill 
 Fuck wit tha treal still they'll get a nigga killed 
 So I keep 'em close, don't know 'em, I met 'em on my joce 
 Cut throat 'em on Magnolia leave body parts on Willow 
 Dats how we do it, 6 court souljas off top 
 Keep 'em cocked wit out havin' second thoughts to pop 
 Uptown dats where I was born and raised 
 Chastised by veterens in they army brigades 
 When I grew up I wanted to just like them 
 Look at me now retired veteren, Soulja Slim 
 Alot of souljas made it and alot of 'em didn't 
 It ain't easy bein' a soulja takes alot of wig splittin' 
 Unforgettin' ghetto livin' to tha day dat I die 
 Fabolous, dangerous weighin' 195 
 I got scuffle like Holyfield but I gets ill like Mike 
 For them nigga snakes I bite 
 When I write (grrr) I bite back, 
 Picture dat, nigga raw doggin' it 
 Got tha industry on lockdown & I'm hoggin' it 
 I got what cha lookin' for and what cha want 
 Huh don't play no games you know your do's & don'ts, what 
 (Soulja Slim) 
 Nigga just shot my dawg Double Crosser 
 Beef is on, heat is on, tweekin' for leakin' domes 
 Make it known when I come home clear tha whole corner 
 Somebody gon' die when my and my army ride 
 You niggas jive, who gonna thank me and my dawg won't kill ya 
 Had ya down dad should have let my dawg steel ya 
 Bustarized, realized, we crucifized, homicide 
 Lookin' for me wit tha Chinese eyes 
 Gold grill from tha back to tha front, mask on 
 Done a walkby and got my blast on 
 See me when I beef I can't sleep 
 I creep creep, lay low like a sniper and che, che 
 Day and night hopin' I catch my prey right 
 I hate tha light but I can't run from a gun fight 
 Soulja type & I refuse to lose my life 
 Been inticed by tha devil but I love Jesus Christ 
 So what dat tell ya, I'm gon' kill ya if I haveta 
 Thank it's a game when it ain't no fun and laughter 
 Blast ya ass then get ghost like Casper 
 I'm 'bout it 'bout it, I just ain't no good ass rapper 
 (Krazy) 
 (What) 
 In tha projects thugged out slangin' for cheese 
 Head bustin' any nigga holdin' them ki's 
 Puffin' weed daily, thuggin' in public 
 Tha bitches give me head cause tha hoes they love me 
 Say goodbye to them bitch niggas they work for tha feds 
 I can't be caught wit cha when they bust yo head 
 Ski masked wit a hundred rounds lookin' for fire 
 Downtown niggas clearin' watch them niggas expire 
 We ride fo' deep in a Caddy wit Swab 
 I don't love head bustin' I'm just doin' my job 
 Iberville is what I scream lookin' for danger 
 Hundred rounds in my chopper realesin' my anger, now
