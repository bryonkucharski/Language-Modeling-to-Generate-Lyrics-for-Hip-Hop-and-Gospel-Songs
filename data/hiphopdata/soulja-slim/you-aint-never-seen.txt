 Whoa! What's soulja slim 
 (Soulja Slim) 
 Reality 
 Something you can't run from 
 (Master P) 
 They ain't never been threw this real shit 
 Its real out here 
 Magnolia, Calliope, Melphaen 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 You ain't never seen what I done seen 
 Or been threw what I been threw, that's why I got a fuck up mental 
 And you ask why I don't rap positive 
 I been a convicted violent felon threw the years with blood sweat and tears 
 (Soulja Slim) 
 Project living, dirt diving ???? that's how I came up 
 Ever since I was a juve plotting on ways to be famous 
 You should be rap artist, be a born killer or dope dealer 
 I look up to all the hard hitters that use to slang on Six and Wheeler 
 Back in the early 80's ???????? had shop on Wheeler street 
 Mama send me to the store 
 Sit on the porch watching hustlers that creep 
 Saying to myself that's how I wanna be living my life in the fast lane 
 Getting big time in the dope game 
 Pushing herion getting coke caine 
 That's every young nigga dream that grew up in the bricks 
 Young niggas kill for the cream, cut thoarts and totting clips 
 Mama was a fiend she like to fiend for them rocks sucking dicks 
 Never ever had a Pa he's an Angolia convict 
 My role models is soldiers on the porch with the torch 
 Ready to blast pop some in his ass and put it in the corps 
 (Soulja Slim) 
 Shit gets scary when all the lights go out in the projects 
 You know who might keep in yo door and leave on the floor with a slit neck 
 Or you saw crack from a broke tek 
 Only shot three times and got jam (Gunshots) 
 Think I wished it happened goddamn! 
 I just seen bout five minutes ago 
 Going up the steps asking me to blow 
 Thinking it's the hoe from Ali show 
 But she not dead doe 
 Hoes play cut throat two on the De-Lo, don't trust them 
 Be careful how you fuck em 
 Cause you hook yourself and start to love em 
 Stay above them 
 Don't fall weak they got some niggas to die 
 For the cheeks, superfreaks 
 That's if a nigga M.O.B but anyway peep my real shit 
 In a situation like that the nigga people thinkin' the hoe double cross em 
 And the killers ain't doing shit to the fact 
 ?????? And the dope dealers killing everything in the house 
 Me myself I wonder why the hoe is still living why the killers ain't take her out 
 I think it was a set up 
 That bitch need to be wet up 
 Nigga gave her a dome shot and blowed that bitch up in her Beretta 
 (Explosion)
