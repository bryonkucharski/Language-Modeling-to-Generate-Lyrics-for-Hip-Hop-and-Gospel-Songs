Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Either you love me or love me not I'ma be me 
 I'm known for making promises that I can't keep 
 And baby the streets made me 
 And I run 'em 24/7 365 daily 
 Look you knew what you was dealing with from day one 
 I'm not a lil boy, yeah I'm young with a lot of old vet ways 
 Its only been a few days and so you say 
 You love me in a married way, yeah okay 
 I've been several types of relationships 
 And I feel your true love don't make no sense 
 It's all on me if I want this thang to work out 
 I know your goal is to try trap me that what you heard bout 
 I ain't been home in a few days cause you be traveling 
 I let you get your mind right 'cause I ain't with the kicking and scratching 
 I'm on parole, I can't be riding for domestic violence so I stay my distance 
 When there two ways to beat the pussy up and I'm bout my business 
 If I gotta beatcha then I don't need ya, let the next man do it 
 You done ran me away from you now, how you gone prove it 
 Being stupid, you done lost out 
 Now its next to the boss bitch with the boss mouth 
 You know what I'm talking bout 
 Son say he seen me distributing something 
 You know that boy dirty, he didn't see me distributing nothing 
 So now its back doing jail time all over again 
 And josphine means bumping running working the pin 
 I only got 500 for me but I keep ten 
 But you my number one and you don't suppose to know about them 
 Deep in your heart you know I'm a true player boy 
 But its cool I take that nigga I take my player charges 
 I don't know why you making me promise to come home to you 
 Yeah I come to fuck but that's 'bout the only thang I can do 
 You noticed how I put the truth in front of the player 
 The world revolves round cane and that's why I take it there 
 God forgive me but I swear I think I'll never change 
 And I'm still stuck on that old saying no pain no gain 
 What said me not to be explain decision ya understand 
 I'm a man, so I gots to keep the upper hand 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Yeah I got feelings but my first real old lady left with'em 
 A refuse to give'em back, so I'm rolling like that 
 What I really loved is gone now 
 That's why I stay in another nigga house when he ain't home now 
 Putting that brod down player please don't feel played 
 She was uptown looking and got herself a true lover head 
 Your girl and all my hoes got my psyched up 
 Calling on caddy daddy just to get the right fuck 
 You best tighten up your game cause it hurting charlie 
 I pop a rodly feel my game tight than everybody 
 On the low you don't even know I got her pop it two 
 And that's just one of the thangs I know you couldn't make her do 
 It ain't nothing for me to take over a strong mind 
 Even Eve couldn't tell a bitch that love blind 
 I don't be lying when you asked for something its no's and yes' 
 She got my name on her thigh, her back, and her chest, like I'm depressed
