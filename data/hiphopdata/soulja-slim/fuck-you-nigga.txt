 Fuck you nigga, I'ma cut throat nigga

 (Lil Real One) 
 Bitch I'ma cut throat nigga, hoe we buckin I made ya 
 My neighborhood don't like me 'cause they know I'ma gangsta 
 They love to call enforcement bout my bad behavior 
 'Cause I'm quick to grab that shotti and go find my neighbor 
 Used to flip them ghetto hoes but now I feel like a playa 
 Man this bone shit done gave a nigga powerful flavor 
 We'll steal up off yo tank, if you don't get out I'll make ya 
 Fuck No Limit you owe my nigga some paper 
 Cut Throat Committee, official we screamin ya bone grizzle 
 If ya meet this chrome nickel, make ya dome dome wiggle 
 Its blisterin cold, ya body frozen icicle 
 Got some shit on ya nose, you prolly got ya wife wit ya, nigga 
 Pass me that white liquor 
 Then I'ma show you how I turn into a hype nigga, overnight nigga 
 Beat a bitch over his head wit a pipe a slice and dice him 
 Wit a knife I let him know that'll it'll be cut throat for life

 (Soulja Slim) 
 Look, I can't neglect that I'm too damn cut throat 
 My teenage years I was on heroine and coke 
 Them wild Magnolia ain't shit that you could say about me 
 Fuck what you going through, lemmie get yours and I'm outtie 
 Put my tip down, mouthpiece him

 Slim don't do it like that there 
 My hood, yo hood we can do it anywhere 
 Hand guns, I got em, choppas, I stock em 
 Keep them thangs nice and earl so there's no problems when we pop em 
 Say nigga fuck you, I'ma cut throat nigga 
 You could get from round my ear wit all that other shit nigga 
 Before a nigga steal ya, put ya in the blender 
 Fuck ya up so bad till when yo people won't remember 
 Ain't no body fuckin' wit us right now

 (Twelve A Klok) 
 I show these niggaz what that A to the K like 
 If you hustle I show ya how to get ya cake right 
 If you my bitch I show ya how to twerk and shake right 
 Make that pussy so fire nigga can't thank twice 
 A fuckin' livin' legend 
 So from this rap shit, the street shit, they feel my presence 
 Its Twelve A Klok and I ain't talkin' 'bout no time of day 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the slim nigga that stay behind the k' 
 Don't give a fuck about ya chest I'm tryna find yo face 
 And I don't do ya from behind so pick the time and place 
 I could show you what's on my mind bitch you ain't no gangsta 
 You ain't nothin' close to the way these bitch ass niggaz mangle

 No matter how much change I get I'm gon' be on this corner 
 So if you wanna see some shit then come out on this corner, but if you want this corner 
 Fuckin' wit me you might this whole fuckin' corner on ya

 We the future y'all niggaz the past tense 
 I could easily make y'all niggaz into the past tense 
 But I feel y'all would fuck wit us if ya had sense 
 Bandanna round my jammer 
 You dead no fingerprints, uuh
