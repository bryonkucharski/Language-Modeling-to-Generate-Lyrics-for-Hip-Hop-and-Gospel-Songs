 Wake up in the mornin? and my chef cooked me breakfast 
 Then brush ma teeth, then I put on my necklace 
 Didn't think about what car to ride 
 Is it Phana or the, the Lamgocha? 
 I got got stuff for you haters, I make my paper you haters 
 When I see you in the street, I don't speak to you haters 
 So you never thought you'd see a young fly nigga ball 
 You see me on top, see me rollin'?, see me fall 
 It's like a jungle sometimes, it make me wonder 
 How I keep from goin' under when I rock with ten summers 
 And I still get my numbers and I still stay humble 
 I got niggas like, ?Damn, dog, how he do that?? 
 I'm on that music, big homie, I got my UNS, big homie 
 And he ain't your nigga, so what can you do to me, big homie? 
 And I'm cool rite now, if I stop rite now 
 Oh, and I can raise 5 mill? a day rite now

 'Cause ain't nothin' but money inside my hand 
 I ain't talkin' 'bout a measly 100 grand 
 Talkin' 'bout big money, get that paper, man 
 Picture me rollin' in ma ?64, flyin' in my G5 
 Landin? in the sand, put my feet up in the sand 
 Grindin' all the time, makin' money while I can 
 It's a Kodak moment, take a picture while you can 
 Yes, you can, can, a can, can take a picture with your friend, friends 
 Even though I missed my flinger goin' to France, man
