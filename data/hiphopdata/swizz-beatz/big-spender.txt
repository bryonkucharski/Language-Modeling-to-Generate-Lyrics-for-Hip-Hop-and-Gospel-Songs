The minute you walked in the joint 
 I could see you were a man of distinction 
 A real big spender 
 Good lookin', so refined 
 Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind 
 So let me right to the point 
 I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
 Hey big spender 
 Spend a little time with me 
 Wouldn't you like to have fun fun fun 
 How's about a few laughs, laughs 
 I can show a good time 
 Let me show you a good time 
 The minute you walked in the joint 
 I could see you were a man of distinction 
 A real big spender 
 Good lookin', so refined 
 Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind 
 So let me get right to the point 
 I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
 Hey big spender 
 Hey big spender 
 Hey big spender 
 Spend a little time with me 
 *Yeees*
