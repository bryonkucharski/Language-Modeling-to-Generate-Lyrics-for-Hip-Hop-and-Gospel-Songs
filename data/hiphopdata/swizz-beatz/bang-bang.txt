(Swizz Beatz) 
 Showtime, 
 Pull your Aston Martin out and just swerve on 'em 
 Pull your hoopty out man and just swerve on 'em 
 Let the top drop back and just swerve on 'em 
 Take the doors off your whip and just swerve on 'em 
 (Pharrell) 
 You can catch 'em swerving in that thing thing 
 Riding in that thing thing 
 Let the top drop and let the system bang bang 
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Me and my bitches swerving in that thing thing 
 Riding in that thing thing 
 Let the blueberry blow let the system bang bang 
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 (Talk to 'em Pusha) 
 (Pusha T) 
 Take ya tops off baby, it's bout to pop off 
 Young somersault in this bitch to want to cop off 
 When you got the crown the haters want you to drop off 
 Lil Pusha T's in the game I simple knock off 
 I beg your pardon, that coupe is a Targa 
 I've been in and outta lanes with a Porsche playing frogger 
 I'll never be a blogger, I'm too much of a buyer 
 Post it, don't have it at your home, you're a liar 
 These n-ggas day dreamers, I'm more like a schemer 
 To have from Iesha's to Adrianna Lima's 
 Yeah, couple extra models for what we pop bottles for 
 Leaning on the throttle more 
 (Swizz beatz) 
 This that sh-t that you knock in your drops 
 The sh-t that you like to knock in your drops 
 Well if you like me, this the sh-t you like to knock on your yachts 
 Boat shoes on, walls full of Basquiats 
 You ain't like me, you just automatic starting 
 You like me, you design Aston Martin's 
 Bow ties on, I'm just GQ modelling 
 Damn, fresh I am 
 When I start scoring I shut down the Garden 
 Swizzy Rule the World on my Nas and my Lauren 
 Blogs say Swizzy bars ain't nothing to pause 
 I say FREEZE! 
 Now pull your cars up next to ours 
 (Pusha T) 
 Where I'm from we don't gang bang 
 But we sell that thing thing 
 Every ghetto same sh-t 
 Just only the slang change 
 Soon as that bass came we started to take aim 
 Double G boat shoes, YSL case frames 
 Club with the photoshoots 
 Think Puffy and Mase came 
 Dolled up the bitches too, they was in the same frame 
 Hustlers they chased change, busta's they chased dames 
 Young n-ggas Kingpins we was tryna fame 
 N-ggas on they chaingang, snitches play the blame game 
 First (?) in the room when they name names 
 Hard for us to cross paths we ain't in the same lane 
 Hope God forgive me when I catch n-ggas bang bang!
