 Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in 
 Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened 
 I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by 
 She's fly, black, Asian, Boriqua 
 Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern 
 Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening? 
 Just rolled four with them, 'bout to smoke again 
 Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down 
 How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?

 It's the summertime, women damn near naked 
 It's single season, they choosing who to mess with 
 I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it 
 Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps 
 My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach 
 My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach 
 I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech 
 Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets 
 And they ain't even out yet, she like Ciroc peach 
 Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash

 Bad bitches, champagne wishes 
 Freaks only, baby let me take pictures 
 Skin, sin, wait do you know whose pool you're in? 
 Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill 
 Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal 
 Real, make money when the freaks call 
 Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall 
 Like 
 Una vida, she butterfly 
 Caliente 
 Mami vente, vente con migo, y-o
