 Nigga feel the beat in ya chest when ya leanin' 'n' swervin' 
 Bass in ya back, you feel it, you heard it 
 Hand on the wheel no need to be nervous 
 Ride 
 With a g everything'll be perfect 
 Put it down, put it all on the surface 
 Dirty as we ride, it'll all be worth it 
 (Till the wheels fall off) Nigga 
 That's the purpose 
 Nothin' but the best 'cause we deserve it 
 They know when I'm comin', cause niggas can hear me before they can see me and they can't 
 Believe it 'cause I'm bumpin Eazy-E 
 And they just seen me on TV 
 Navigate through the streets dog 
 Keep it real to the beat that ain't no secret 
 Jump 
 Outta the jeep car 
 Run up in the liquor store hit the freezer 
 Grab a O, Gold, like my 4-0, my flow so cold, I gotta have some 
 Turn the music back up 
 To the maximum 
 Them niggas hatin' on us but I laugh at 'em 
 I gotta 9 millimeter that I'll get me to the trunk 
 If I make it to the trunk 
 I'm a pop 
 That trunk 
 Y'all already know comin' outta the trunk is a AK who? 
 With a 12 gauge what? 
 (Krayzie Bone) 
 We back with a vengeance 'cause rap took a strippin' without us 
 Let's be honest, this industry's now over crowded, forgot us 
 Nigga ya time up 
 Go back 
 To practice sign with your life and sign up 
 If niggas is lookin' for hits hit Swizz up, nigga he comin' to find us 
 And we ain't hard to find 
 Been 
 Right here all the time 
 That bling got y'all all blind 
 These niggas ain't raw as I 
 So don't make me kill ya 
 Don't try to battle me cause ain't none 
 Of you niggas skilled enough (skilled enough) 
 I'm sick of these niggas, they killin' me, really they wanna be thugs 
 Everybody wanna roll like us, smoke 
 Blunts 
 'Cause we pump off in your trunk 
 Them niggas get hypnotized 
 Run up as soon as they feel the vibe 
 They never been on a realer ride 
 Just 
 Runnin' up, let's turn it up till they know 
 (Wish Bone) 
 'Fore the liquor store close in a rush turn it up, let it drop, now nigga let's roll, roll 
 Gotta fill up 
 With a drink of 
 Anything thing that bang 
 Or roll up 
 Gotta choose what I listen too 
 Cause it ain't got much that I'm feelin' ooh 
 Everybody talkin' violence 
 Take a life live they been through 
 I love that gangsta music 
 Bump nothin' but thugsta music 
 Except when I lay down and slow down, that lovin' music 
 No pretender get in ya 
 Thugs 
 Runnin' through it 
 The truest 
 We still hear they love how we do it, we do it 
 Thugsta 
 Outta line cross mine 
 Yes thugstas really rush ya 
 Bang ya brains with thangs 
 Never run away 
 Any day I'm here to stay we love to play 
 Bone got that feel good pop it in listen to real rappin'
