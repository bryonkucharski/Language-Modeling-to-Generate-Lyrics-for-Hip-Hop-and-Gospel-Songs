 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air 
 Swang! 
 New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag 
 Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag 
 Full of stacks rubber bands 'round big cash 
 Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad (come on) 
 We in the club holmes getting our thug on 
 Bottles of patron if you grown get your buzz on 
 We bought the bars out and brought the cars out 
 I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out 
 When it dark out get the squad out 
 We ball hard sucka' nigga eat ya heart out (sucka' nigga) 
 I'm too advanced super swag, and my Louis pants 
 Falling on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag 
 I say whoa kimosabe big balling is my hobby 
 I'm bopping while I'm walking rag falling out my pocket 
 If big money ain't the topic homie I ain't even talking 
 Hated on by the workers but I'm cool wit all the bosses 
 Catch me flossing at the mall (Mall) talking to a broad (broad) 
 She follow me and Gucci and I taught her how to ball (ball) 
 Three pair of shoes four shirts six rags 
 Chick said dag that's more in my bag 
 Shorty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast 
 Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast 
 Silk scarf hanging out of my jeans 
 Nah homie I ain't thinkin' I'm just doin' my thing 
 I took some time off and now I'm back y'all 
 You in the line at the club I'm in the back dog 
 And when this song on ballers peel stacks off 
 And make it rain on them broads watch the stacks fall 
 And pull your rag out and wave it left, right 
 Let it sag wit ya pants get ya swag just right 
 Ride Bankhead flare flying out the Benz 
 Once a fool wit it we gonna bring 'em out again
