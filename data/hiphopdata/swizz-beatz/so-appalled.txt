One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Two hands in the air, if he don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous 
 It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous 
 One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes man ridiculous 
 Life can be sometimes ridiculous 
 I'm so appalled Spalding ball, 
 Baldin' Donald Trump, takin' dollars from y'all 
 Baby your fired, your girlfriend hired 
 But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call 
 We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout y'all 
 I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' whole through the wall 
 But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers 
 And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers 
 Housekeeping, I mean goddamn 
 One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin' 
 That know we get O's like cheerios 
 That know because they seen us in the videos 
 That know the day that you play me 
 Will be the same day M.T.V. play videos 
 That was a little joke, voila 
 Praises due to the most high Allah 
 Praises due to the most fly Prada 
 Baby I'm magic ta-da 
 Address me as your highness, high as united 
 Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited 
 Niggas be writin' bullshit like they gotta work 
 Niggas is goin' through real shit man they outta work 
 That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt 
 That's why I rather spit somethin' that gotta purp' 
 Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches 
 I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous 
 Five star dishes, different exotic fishes 
 Man this shit if fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 How should I begin this, I'm just so offended 
 How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners? 
 I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall 
 Just to show niggas how much more I have in store 
 I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause 
 All of y'all can suck my balls through my draws 
 Dark knight feelin', die you be a hero 
 Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain 
 I went from the favorite, to the most hated 
 But would you rather be underpaid or overrated? 
 Moral victories is for minor league coaches 
 And 'ye already told you we major you cockroaches 
 Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas 
 The hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused 
 I lost thirty mill so spent another thirty 
 Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me 
 Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying 
 Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playin' 
 All these little bitches, too big for their britches 
 Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous 
 Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches 
 I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous 
 Five star dishes, different exotic fishes 
 Man this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 Success is what you make it 
 Take it how it come 
 A half a mill in twenties like a billion where I'm from 
 An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become 
 C.N.N. said I'd be dead by twenty one 
 Blackjack I just pulled in Aces 
 You looking at the king in his face 
 Everything I dream motherfuckers I'm watchin' it take shape 
 While to you I'm just the young rich nigga that lacks faith 
 Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce 
 Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose 
 Them hoes comin' in a baker's dozen 
 Claiming they was wit' me when they know they really wasn't 
 I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest 
 So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest 
 I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance 
 So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness 
 I speak the gospel, hostile 
 Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils 
 Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful 
 Eye of the law, aspire for more 
 Those kilo's came we give you bobby brown jaw 
 Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call 
 Flow similar to the legends of the falls 
 Spillin' I own you all, yeughck! 
 One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Two hands in the air, if he don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous 
 It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous 
 One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes man ridiculous 
 Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh! 
 Huh, I am so outrageous 
 I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet 
 If god had an Ipod I'd be on his playlist 
 My phrases amazing, the faces and places the favorite 
 My cup over runeth with hundreths 
 Dummy damn its hard not for me to waste it 
 The new commandment 
 Though should not hate kid 
 My movement is like the Civil Rights I'm Ralph David 
 Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks 
 I ain't nothing like those niggas baby those are marks 
 I met this girl on valentines day 
 Fucked her in May, she found out about April 
 So she chose to March, Ha 
 Damn another broken heart 
 I keep bitches by them two's nigga, Noah's ark 
 I got a seven on me 
 I call my dro' Lamar 
 Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart 
 G-A-T in the path finder 
 Cause you haters got P.H.D's 
 Y'all just some major haters and some math minors 
 Tiger woods don't make me grab iron 
 Champagne wishes and thirty white bitches 
 You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous 
 Calls from the Mrs. 
 Infers from the mistress 
 You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous 
 Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous 
 One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Two hands in the air, if he don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous 
 It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous 
 One hand in the air, if he don't really care 
 Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care 
 It's like that sometimes man ridiculous 
 Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!
