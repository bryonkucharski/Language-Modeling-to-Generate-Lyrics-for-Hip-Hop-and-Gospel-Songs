It's Showtime! 
 She ain't got no money in the bank 
 She be walking 'round actin' all stank 
 And now she at the party looking at me 
 Hopin' she can get saved by me 
 I'm lookin' at her like (right) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 She got her hand up but I tryna pay that girl 
 Now, what y'all wanna do? (do) 
 Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers 
 Give me ur numba I beat she gon call ya 
 Come on dawg she want you to spoil her 
 Cristian Dior and them new Fendi bags 
 Anything is good 'cause it's better than she had 
 She sitting at the bar and she's lookin' so sad 
 Something 'bout, uh-uh I wanna ride in your jag 
 Uh uh uh, I wanna ride to your house 
 I said "easy chick, I fly to my house" 
 I, live so far think I live down south 
 Why don't you pull it out my pants and put it in yo mouth (echoes) 
 She ain't got no money in the bank

 Good dress on, I mean you got your best on 
 I'm sitting at the back drankin' viva glico 
 The caroselito, you know how we do 
 Before them models came you wasn't fuckin' with my niggas 
 My homies say wassup you saying nothing to my niggas 
 Come on girlfriend why you fronting for my niggas 
 They come and that paper is nothing for my niggas 
 Don't you know we got that money in the (money in the bank) I repeat

 She got her hand up but I tryna pay that girl 
 It's started like soft and warm 
 Don't get excited, I've been invited to the quiet storm 
 Now its out of hand 'cause she told me she hate me 
 And then she said "opening up and leave me" 
 Plus she said all she want is love and affection 
 Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection 
 Took her out bought her all kinds of things 
 But it wasn't enough, so this is the song I sing 
 'Cause she broke 
 She ain't got no money in the bank 
 She be walking 'round actin' all stank 
 And now she at the party looking at me 
 Hopin' she can get saved by me 
 I'm lookin' at her like (right) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!) 
 She got her hand up but I tryna pay that girl 
 Lets, let, lets go!
