(Big Daddy Kane) 
 I can't hold back any longer 
 I can't prolong my feelings for you any more 
 You know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to... 
 ... Express myself to you 
 You see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things 
 I mean to be all honest, that is, but now... hmm... 
 Well let's just say I'm not ashamed 
 Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world 
 (Round and around and around) 
 From city to city, from state to state 
 And of course, from girl to girl 
 (Ooh-eauuuuuuu-ooh) 
 And I believe that I've played every game in the world 
 That one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby) 
 And of all those games, you're the only chip on the table 
 That's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhah) 
 Now I realize that love takes time 
 And trust is somethin' that you have to earn 
 (Ooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm 
 Well I'm prepared to give you all of me 
 But, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it) 
 These are some things that I've been meaning to say 
 And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize 
 That I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure) 
 So I have to take a little time out to get together 
 Now baby, I'm not ashamed 
 (Alyson Williams) 
 Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed) 
 Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed) 
 Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed) 
 What sparks would start this flame 
 Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed) 
 Never let me go (I'm not ashamed) 
 I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed) 
 Don't ever feel ashamed 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 You know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player 
 (Mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ah... 
 As ah... as just a one night affair 
 (One night love affair) 
 Now all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me lonnnng 
 For some type of commitment (don't you want it) 
 Nah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me) 
 Aww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon) 
 And let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which 
 All feelins are the same (c'mon) 
 All love and respect 
 And never ever, feeling ashamed 
 (Alyson Williams) 
 Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed) 
 Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed) 
 Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed) 
 What sparks would start this flame 
 Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed) 
 Never let me go (I'm not ashamed) 
 I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed) 
 Don't ever feel ashamed 
 Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed) 
 Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed) 
 Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed) 
 What sparks would start this flame 
 Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed) 
 Never let me go (I'm not ashamed) 
 I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
