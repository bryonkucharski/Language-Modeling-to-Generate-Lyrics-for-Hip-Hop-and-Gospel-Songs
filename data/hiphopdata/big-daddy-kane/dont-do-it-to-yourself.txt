{Big scoob:} 
 Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, kane, drop it like it's hot 
 Yo, pick up the microphone and gimme what you got 
 {Big daddy kane:} 
 Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, scoob, drop it like it's hot 
 Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot 
 (x2) 
 (Oh my god, tell me, is it really him? 
 The legendary lyricist makin' matters grim?) 
 Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly 
 Rappers start shakin like the legs on elvis presley 
 Sayin' (it's him, the great) that's how I intimidate 
 But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break 
 And pickin' up the microphone after I left 
 Is like givin' mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath 
 In other words, I don't leave no remains for you 
 (Forget the men, that's the evil that kane'll do) 
 I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee 
 The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy 
 The magnificent, none can come swifter than 
 Cool as ? ? ?, but my skin color is different 
 We got the milk and honey 
 My rhymes are just like abraham lincoln's face (on the money) 
 Makin' me freshest on the land, but let's not forget 
 That if I rapped under water they'd be aquafresh 
 The best, oh yes, I guess... (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait 
 - You said that shit in '88) 
 Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate 
 And regulate chumps and set 'em straight 
 I get my point across because the boss is truly yours 
 The source to the force, so put it on pause 
 The one that assures applause, never took a loss 
 Stronger than some olde e quarts to a can of coors 
 In other words it's hazardous to your health 
 So don't do it to yourself 
 Don't do it to yourself, don't do it 
 Yo, you better not do it, you better not 
 (x2) 
 (Stop right there, you better freeze, cease 
 Don't make me put my timberland boot to your grill piece 
 Big scoob from brooklyn comin' through, don't start me 
 Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party) 
 Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you 
 To think that you could touch me 
 Or even try to come above me 
 Or even think that you could flow this lovely? 
 Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it 
 I rip it apart, and flip up the art 'cause I'm the best, damn it 
 I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it 
 So anything else you heard is irrelevant 
 (You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me 
 (Step to the kane) and get bagged just like grocery 
 So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution 
 'Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em 
 With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel 
 And I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people 
 I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose 
 When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes) 
 The chocolate city for black cesar incorporated 
 (And all of the soft get faded) 
 So before you step to me use your head 
 And you better think about it more than special ed 
 Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin' against anyone else 
 I'm tellin' you, don't do it to yourself
