Yo V, bring that beat in 
 Yeah that's aight 
 Ah man! 
 Yo G, yo Kool G, yo 
 I'm doin' this right here 
 We got Big Daddy Kane over there 
 We all gonna do just one part 
 Because you know, we came a long way 
 You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X 
 [Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see 
 Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free 
 We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism 
 Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that 
 So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you 
 (Aight, check it out, here we go, yo) 
 I'm tryin' hard to explore, I'm not sure 
 What all the racial war for 
 It's makin' me more sore 
 I walk through a color blind corridor 
 Seekin', for peace in the people I'm meetin' 
 Black white and Puerto-Rican men are greetin' each other 
 Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others 
 You can discover, kids fathers and mothers 
 A meltin' pot, no one felt they got prejudice 
 Listen I could never assist someone diss this 
 A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake 
 Havin' fun, without one bein a fake snake 
 So let's form a rainbow over the mountain 
 And let's drink from the same water fountain 
 Let's make our Earth Day a story of 
 People that walk through the same territories 
 Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed 
 I believe, we all breathe the same seed 
 Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it 
 Then I see your family tree was uprooted 
 So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu 
 The racial manual is the evil that men do 
 I was raised in a nation of Asian 
 Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian 
 So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and 
 Siberian's no better than Nigerian 
 I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in 
 I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians 
 My nationality's reality 
 And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality 
 These are words of a wise man, wisdom 
 Take a taste and erase the racism 
 The ink is black, the page is white 
 Together we learn how to read and write 
 People are black, got people that's white 
 LYo V, bring that beat in 
 Yeah that's aight 
 Ah man! 
 Yo G, yo Kool G, yo 
 I'm doin' this right here 
 We got Big Daddy Kane over there 
 We all gonna do just one part 
 Because you know, we came a long way 
 You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X 
 [Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see 
 Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free 
 We gonna talk about this, is he gonna talk about this racism 
 Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that 
 So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you 
 (Aight, check it out, here we go, yo)

 Let's stop racism, and, let's unite 
 (Yo yo Kane, why don't you do your part and then let me do mine. 
 And then we get outta here go head, bet) 
 In the days of slavery 
 Some got to run away and many got done away 
 Inferiority is what some men say 
 But that shit played out with Kunta Kinte 
 Then again in the streets of New York 
 I think of Yusef Hawkins, and I see you're still stalkin' 
 And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst 
 Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse 
 We got to better this world of prejudice 
 People, make peace, and learn to live equal 
 'Cause I don't look at myself as a 
 Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa 
 You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant 
 And I know what's been amended and intended 
 So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build 
 A united nation, eliminate segregation 
 I know there's different strokes for different folks 
 But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes 
 So don't hate me or try to underrate me 
 'Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly 
 And we can all live together in harmony 
 Without thinkin' what color is harmin' me 
 If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm 
 To E-R-A-S-E the racism 
 To the black and the white 
 The red and the yellow 
 To all the nationalities 
 I'd like to say hello 
 And I hope they stop racism and it's comin' from our hearts 
 Me, Kool G Rap, Polo, Big Daddy Kane, Cool V, and of course 
 The Diabolical Bizmarkie I hope ya stop racism 
 Peace 
 (Yo yo Kane, why don't you do your part 
 And then let me do mine and then we get outta here 
 Go ahead, bet)
