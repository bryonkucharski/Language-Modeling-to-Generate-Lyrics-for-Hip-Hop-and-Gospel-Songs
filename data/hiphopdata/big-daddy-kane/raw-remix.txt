Here I am ... R-A-W 
 Terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
 Phoney emcees, I move on and sieze 
 I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease 
 'Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low 
 Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
 Second to none, making emcees run 
 Also don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one 
 I relieve rappers just like Tylenol 
 And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
 Try to front, perpetrating a stunt 
 When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
 I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi 
 The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me 
 To make me want to create chaos and mayhem 
 Cold rock a party, until the A.M. 
 I'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle 
 While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme 
 With authority, superiority 
 And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
 The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
 Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues 
 I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw 
 'Cause I get RAW! 
 I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin 
 And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten 
 Or eaten, or just tookin out 
 You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out 
 And real nervous, when I'm at your service 
 Also give me that title boy, you don't deserve this 
 I work like a slave to become a master 
 And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta 
 Be perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed 
 The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it 
 I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya 
 I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb 
 Also full of action, my name should be a verb 
 My voice will float, on every note 
 When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote 
 The minute that the Kane starts to go on 
 Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on 
 As I put other rappers out of their misery 
 Get 'em in a battle and make them all history 
 Rulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin 
 Watch 'em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin 
 On a throne, with a bronze microphone 
 Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own 
 'Cause I get raw! 
 Chillin', killin' like a villain 
 The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing 
 To do whatever is clever, take a loss never 
 And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must 
 And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd 
 I rip the microphone and leave it scarred 
 Never smokin' or hittin or takin' a sniff 
 Only crushin emcees that be tryin' to riff 
 I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic 
 Make emcees panic, they all get frantic 
 And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive 
 As I rocked, but hey, what you expected? 
 I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior 
 Rather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I 
 Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang 
 Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang 
 So if we battle on the microphone 
 Bring your own casket and tombstone 
 And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world 
 Could ever come with more, I get RAW!
