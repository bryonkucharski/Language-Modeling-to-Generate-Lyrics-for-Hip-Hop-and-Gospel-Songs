Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes 
 Get wise to the exercise 
 Being taught by the teacher that抯 most dominant 
 You need knowledge? 
 Well I抦 dropping it 
 Listen to the rap allow it to trap 
 Your body and soul so that you can adapt 
 To the man on display as I take you away 
 So may I? 
 <Yes you may!> 
 Proud to be a Black man 
 Coming exact and 
 Giving up to brothers five on the back hand 
 Pray for lease and peace upon each other 
 With my sisters and brothers 
 <Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!> 
 I say the mother, as in the motherland 
 But on the other hand, another man 
 Tackled and shackled our ancestors 
 But we beat him with freedom, so let抯 bless the 
 Country that we all came from 
 Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome 
 The cream will keep rising 
 We be sizing 
 Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising 
 Building and building to carry on 
 All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan 
 Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils 
 Those who fell victim were those without scruples 
 However, to sever, we could never 
 So hold up the peace sign and stand together 
 Take heed to the words that I manifest 
 And when I抦 through speaking, Marley Marl抣l do the rest 
 <James Brown getting cut up: 
 People, people 
 We gotta get over, before we go under (x2) 
 Let抯 get together> (x2) 
 <Marley Marl?: 
 Yo Big Daddy, what you gonna say now?> 
 Take a stand the fight for power 
 'Cause we抳e been here before the Mayflower 
 Living superior abiding by nature 
 The history of the Asiatic one paid the 
 Price to be paid in slavery 
 Like the name of Antonio was gave to me 
 But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain 
 Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane 
 The teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard 
 That抯 word, to the mother my brother 
 So discover the truth of one another 
 Cause here抯 the real deal upon our skin color 
 Lay down white, yellow, red or pink 
 But the color of black is most dominant 
 The rising and sizing can never cease 
 <Marley Marl: what you going say now?> 
 Peace! 
 <Farrakhan: ...the mother of all living things and the Black man 
 Is the original man, we just can抰 escape our destiny> 
 <Word to the mother!> (x2) 
 <Farrakhan: I thank Allah for allowing me to teach this subject today 
 Crowd: yeah, that抯 right...>
