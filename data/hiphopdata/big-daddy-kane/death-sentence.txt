I break out in a cold sweat, rip up the whole set 
 I'm about as bad as you can get 
 Comin' from Bed-Stuy, that's where they do or die 
 Forget about the lions and tigers and bears, oh my 
 It's not a fairy tale, a myth, it's a musical uplift 
 And I'm the wrong one to mess with 
 I roll on rappers like a Cherokee, bake 'em up merrily 
 Just like the cooks at Sara Lee 
 Erase, replace, disgrace, and chase, unlace your face 
 And place a neck brace, about-face 
 And get to steppin', because my lethal weapon 
 Is blowin' too fast, while you're slow as Catherine Hepburn 
 What you need is a little more speed, style and flavor 
 But it still wouldn't save ya 
 So to the rear, step off and let the man flex 
 'Cause I can hang tighter to the groove than spandex 
 I snatch the mic with grace, always with a plan 
 And Cee'll cut the recored up like Edward Scissorhands 
 Rock the soul shack, I can't hold back 
 Four years standin' and I still got the knack 
 'Cause I remember when I first did it 
 The comments that were goin' around from the next critic 
 Like "Yeah, he sound all right, but still will he hold?" 
 And now my black ass is still here like Billy Joel 
 One hip-hopper that don't have to sound proper 
 My broken English you can still distinguish 
 And I don't have no image or no gimmicks 
 And I don't have no bounds or no limits 
 The Kane'll keep goin', and growin', and flowin' 
 And showin' any MC, I got the best finesse to manifest 
 'Cause I pull cards like some type of retard 
 Hittin' MCs hard, and any other Rass Claaad 
 I'm the predator to any competitor 
 Scorchin' and damagin' and stompin' et cetera 
 And any MC that tries to test me 
 I'm swellin' up his jaws mor than Dizzy Gillespie 
 Crushin' all dreams you thought were possible 
 I turn into nightmares you have in the hospital 
 I couldn't count the rappes I be servin' 
 If defeat was sex, huh, I'd be a virgin 
 My match ain't been found, movin' around, breakin' 'em down 
 Where the ground, never the clown, how that sound? 
 Don't get gassed, 'cause boy you won't last 
 So take your crippled rhymes and put 'em in a cast 
 You're too pathetic, bring in a paramedic 
 To heal your sick rhymes, 'cause man, you ain't poetic 
 You're just a cheap little hooker and I gotta overlook a 
 MC that's wack, ya little bogger 
 And stand clear of the mic that I'm rippin' 
 As I'm...??? 
 And get your jury and a good defendant 
 'Cause I'm servin' a death sentence...
