Come, get some, you little bum 
 I take the cake but you can't get a crumb 
 From the poetic, authentic, superior 
 Ultimate - and all that good shit 
 I'm the original, asiatic, acrobatic 
 There you have it, now get dramatic 
 Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene 
 And I pack 'em in mean, like bruce springsteen 
 I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile 
 Put on trial a rap pile to exile 
 Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble 
 And I'm still calm and humble 
 You need another helpin hand to swing on 
 I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on 
 Your batman and robin, cagney and lacey 
 Starsky and hutch, but they still can't face me 
 And if may make this one thing here clear 
 That's for you not to come near, period 
 So I ain't buggin or delirious 
 My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is 
 And I can slice and dice a fisher price MC 
 That thought he was nice into minute rice 
 Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff 
 Cause cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff 
 And the mic I ravage, not like a savage 
 But in my own way of doin' damage 
 As I design the genuine line 
 Now who flattop rules in eighty-nine? 
 Warm it up, kane (16x) 
 ... 
 Take two other men with soul that you probably know 
 Deadly as scarface, but bright as the cosby show 
 Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush 
 They step to me, but can't stop the bumrush 
 I make material, rich and imperial 
 The unique technique I speak is all original 
 You like to sag and drag and gag 
 Same old same old, but poppa's got a brand new bag 
 So put the mic down boy, you can't work it 
 Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit 
 So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse 
 You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust 
 First I caught ya, then put ya through torture 
 You moved wrong my son, so I taught ya 
 Just like a guardian, that put your body in 
 The mood to groove with the smoove way that I'm partyin 
 Competition may find it spectacular 
 Scheme and fiend to take a bite like dracula 
 And waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here 
 So come near if you dare, you booga bear 
 You start hallucinatin like magic 
 The wrath gets tragic, but kane won't have it 
 Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin 
 Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin 
 So pick a vc date, 'cause you're history 
 Here comes kane scoob scrap jay and mister cee 
 And this is one thing to us we ain't new to 
 The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo 
 I'm the man you can't hold back 
 And all competition appears to be weak 
 I meant to say wack, a vision of blur 
 Just them thinkin' I'm competitin, I say, "huh!" 
 Warm it up, kane (16x) 
 ... 
 Genuine for eighty-nine, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 As I give a shout out to my man tony a 
 Tony p, sally sal and the whole libra digital posse 
 Can't forget my man yawnski 
 And smooth the barber, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Also, I gotta say whassup to born true, b-boy, 
 And my man big jay cee 
 The whole rest of the crew, scoob lover my brother 
 Scrap lover, and DJ mister cee 
 Can't forget supreme, abu, melquan and shabazz 
 Wally d, and the rest of the brothers 
 And of course my little brother the little daddy shane 
 Manditory end of the story, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Peace!
