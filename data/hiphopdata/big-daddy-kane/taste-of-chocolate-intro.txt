Yeah... 
 You know, 1990 begins a new decade 
 And since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade 
 It's been a three, four year stretch 
 And I'd just like to thank all of you 
 Mmm... 
 And this goes to everybody in the entire world 
 That means the United States, overseas in the U.K. 
 Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else 
 I just wanna dedicate this one to you 
 Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow 
 And I just want to say hello 
 Or should I say peace as I start to release 
 The poetry that don't cease is never the least 
 Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove 
 'Cause I'm so smooth 
 Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme 
 I'll have you dancin in a Soul Train line 
 Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G 
 D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place 
 Doin' the job how you want it done 
 With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun 
 So grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine 
 And everything else'll combine 
 This is that particular beat 
 For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep 
 Uh, also for every girlie 
 To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley 
 Huh, now wait, now wait, now wait a minute 
 Uh! Now check this 
 I wanna talk about peace and unity and love 
 Not one, but all of the above 
 Comin' together like keys on a piano 
 Black and white to unite and oh man oh man 
 What joy did we, find 
 Hard for me to say it sometimes
