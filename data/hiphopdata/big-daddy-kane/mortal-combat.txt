The kiss of death on a rap pick 
 Then you get a slap quick, so guard it with Chapstick 
 In other words, protect and hold your own 
 It only takes one punch to get the head flown 
 Fists of fury, suckers get buried 
 Cause the Kane got more spice than curry 
 I am the flavor down on paper 
 And nothing could save ya, from catchin the vapors 
 Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab 
 And I'm rubbin 'em in just like Vicks say I'm 
 Captivatin, dominatin, innovatin, illustratin, fascinatin 
 Motivatin, elevatin, terminatin, mutilatin 
 Rhymes they're worth their weight in 
 Gold, bold, never sold to a bidder 
 That claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter 
 As for damage, don't tell me what another do 
 'Cause I quote that I'm R-A-W 
 So make room, cause fighters are doomed 
 Try to consume, and make your own tune 
 A grave from a casket, a tisket a tasket 
 You're rhymes out of basket, boy you get your ass kicked 
 For frontin like you hittin hard 
 When your arms are too short, to box with God 
 So don't even touch 'cause I come with too much 
 Address and bless any mic that I clutch 
 And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle 
 He must be senile, and that's why meanwhile 
 Back at the ranch... 
 There goes the asiatic chosen one that's expandin with a new branch 
 So many slept on the nonchalant act 
 Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat 
 I seize and freeze MC's with these degrees 
 Put me to my knees, or at ease, chillllld please 
 I break it down, to bring on the next act 
 Rappers are so full of shit, they need Ex-Lax 
 So stop griffin, your mind is driftin 
 Prepare yourself 'cause I get swift and 
 Captivate the crowd but you can't understand 
 At times I gotta say to myself, "God damn!" 
 As I get hot, and still be gettin' warmer 
 And I don't have beef with no other performer 
 Keep to myself never bother another 
 But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker! 
 Frontin MC's that be tryin' to riff 
 Need to save it, and don't even play with 
 Me when I react like a volcano eruptin 
 I step to you and say, "Now what's up?" then 
 Every word'll be just like surgery 
 Cuttin' you open so rush to emergency 
 Or even bow to your knees and below 
 Or get played like a game of Nintendo 
 J-O-K-E-S ain't my style 
 I ain't a child that's why I don't smile 
 I combine a line designed to find behind the mind 
 So devine the other rappers resign 
 As I go on, from night to morn 
 Beginning to end, from Knowledge to Born 
 Whenever rappers are lookin' for static 
 Looks like a job for King Asiatic 
 N-E, send me, competitors 
 Then again, it might just be better to 
 Just slow down you don't wanna throwdown 
 I get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round 
 Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme 
 And competition, prepare for wartime 
 Be alert for where I drop the bomb at 
 As I destroy you with mortal combat 
 I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol 
 Of folders molders towin black gold 
 So let it be said, let it be read 
 'Cause I lead ahead, of others who rhymes are old as Pro-Keds 
 Tryin' to diss the Big Daddy repetoire 
 Moi?? 
 You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote 
 As I just play 'em like a pregant roach and STOMP EM 
 For tryin' the forbidden 
 Your rhymes ain't hittin, boy you won't be gettin' 
 None of, or in front of, cause every one of 
 My adversaries, lack, you little son of 
 O-bit-uary column, and read your name 
 If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane 
 So any claimin or aimin to be champion 
 Against me? Psssh, can't be one 
 I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream 
 To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem 
 Cause there's only room for one teacher 
 Wise words from a wise man'll reach ya 
 I teach freedom, justice, and equality 
 Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me 
 Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours 
 Slaves, from mental death in power 
 That's the reason before I drop this bomb 
 I say peace to the Nation of Islam
