(Kane) 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 The flow of the Kane is movin 'em real well 
 I build and excel and plus I rap like hell 
 Lyrics generate, break through and penetrate 
 Connect like an interstate, now let me demonstrate 
 I grab the microphone and put the dap in quick 
 You start to tappin and snappin and clappin 
 Then rappin'll happen 
 And then I display, poetry, the right way 
 And rock the Gladys Knight to the next Morris Day 
 I get sexy like Marvin Gaye 
 And other times, I might wanna hit 'em hard and say 
 Somethin' exquisite and clever like a wizard 
 Hit 'em like a blizzard if you missed it 
 Turn to your friend and say, "What is it?" 
 Or what was it, because it, was too fast for you to bust it 
 So pay attention to how the Smooth Operator does it 
 Just acknowledge the sound 
 Get on the good foot... UHH, and get down 
 (Kane) 
 Look 
 The thought of competition, I don't have the faintest 
 'Cause if I'm correct, I kicked them all in the anus 
 So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks 
 The men that's all pumped up like Reeboks 
 'Cause I bring down the swelling, just like alcohol 
 Makin' 'em all fall like the Berlin Wall 
 Then I apply pain just like a migraine 
 Pssssh, man, don't even try Kane 
 A lyrical catastrophe, a disaster see 
 Nobody gets on after me 
 Crushin MC's is how I get my joy 
 So when one tries to battle I'm like, hoo boy 
 Class in session as I give the lesson 
 To prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession 
 And it's nothin' new, that the Kane is your ruler 
 Cause back in the days I used to call you Sundullah 
 Now it's a new time period, rappers are still fearin it 
 And the crowd is still cheerin 
 With the new Black Ceaser that came to town 
 With one purpose - to make you get down 
 (Kane) 
 I start to flow, slow, and then oh no 
 I gotta pick up the pace and go 
 Go relatin and statin what I'm creatin' to straighten MC's 
 That I'm debatin terminatin as the Kane keeps them evadin 
 So step over, cause ain't no leftover 
 Remains from the Kane I drained the last brain 
 Speak like Oprah, attack like a cobra 
 Turn your whole year into a _Red October_ 
 Lyrics are sweet like struddel, at the same time brutal 
 Your rhymes remind me of the noodle in umm 
 CHOP SUEY, soft and chewy 
 My rhymes are kickin like Bruce, you're just Hong Kong Fooey 
 So +Enter the Dragon+ as I start to raggin 
 All the competition that's on the bandwagon 
 I take the groove around around around around around 
 Around, so get down 
 (Kane) 
 Yo, get out your seat and jump to this 
 Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists 
 The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it 
 And show some unity in music 
 We gotta show our young ones the right way 
 To avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay 
 So I keep on teachin the children to follow the 
 Power Equality, Allah C Equality, PEACE 
 ... 
 Mister Cee, you gotta get down and uh 
 Scoob Lover, you gotta get down and uh 
 Scrap Lover, you gotta get down and uh 
 Big Fahl, you gotta get down and my man

 Positive K, you gotta get down and 
 To my man Music Mike, you gotta get down
