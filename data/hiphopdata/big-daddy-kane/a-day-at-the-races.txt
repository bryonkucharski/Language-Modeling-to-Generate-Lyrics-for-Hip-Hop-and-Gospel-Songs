Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness 
 Move and motivate those with musical talents, uh 
 Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down 
 Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town 
 Uh, master blaster sound 
 Freak the future far from here and now 
 With style, release increase the peace, uh 
 Bubble with the beat till they feelin' the heat in the streets 
 Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun 
 On one, listen to the warrior's drum 
 Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock 
 And make you want to crash the spot 
 And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code 
 With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold 
 And foretold to scores of six years ago 
 Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe 
 Supasyllable, major to the minimal 
 Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo 
 Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in 
 The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin' 
 Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue 
 In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s 
 My speech is like holding two glocks apiece 
 The outreach that rock police 
 The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches 
 Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer 
 And I came to get it (hit it) 
 Like operation push, operate the tush 
 Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol 
 I planted my gold, and low and behold 
 It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock 
 Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop 
 The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive 
 Curse my circus, serve this surface 
 And watch how the brother fet over 
 The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor 
 Bear witness 
 To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures 
 When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches 
 Splatter your brains 
 Leave scattered remains of matter and stains 
 That'll explain how you was battled and slain 
 I get rude and go, to your show and use a row 
 Of fans to boo and throw you off till you lose your flow 
 A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme 
 Put your whole team on pause like cold cream 
 Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta 
 Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya 
 I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal 
 When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal 
 Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses 
 Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me 
 Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma 
 And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze 
 Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects 
 On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts 
 On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set 
 On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex 
 Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin' 
 My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em 
 I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin' 
 Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'? 
 Finsta perform all physical forms 
 Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song 
 Please dumb, what type of shit was you on? 
 Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh) 
 All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy 
 All I want is my liver all polluted with remi 
 Duel with any, bring it, I face-off 
 Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball 
 Yeah, your majesty, word flash photography 
 Third class economy, blade slashed your artery 
 Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically 
 Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility 
 Never predictability 
 Maneuvers of mind fully designed 'cause I'm true to the rhyme 
 We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone 
 Attackin' you wack clones 
 Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone 
 That come back verbal assault rifle (ah) 
 We fight like Stokely Carmichael 
 Nope! we just like you 
 We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do 
 Ain't no joke 
 Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy 
 With the king Asiatic and Percy P 
 Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d 
 Spit venom and burn your body like a std 
 Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong 
 I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song 
 This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song 
 Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong 
 Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss 
 My verbal affirmation is to always go off 
 When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe 
 When consider it pride, it's J5 
 When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy 
 Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready 
 Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti 
 Off to another city where we do our nitty grity 
 We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it 
 Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide 
 Write and stay tight, mission's in sight 
 Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife
