Uh, Big Daddy K, Morcheeba, Uh, Feel me, Uh 
 Every time I think about you 
 My senses start to raise 
 And when I try to get you 
 You're gone without a trace 
 In my imagination 
 I see you here with me 
 We 're doing things together 
 This is not reality 
 Nobody knows ya 
 But I've got to fight 
 Something about ya 
 Plays in my mind 
 What's your name? 
 Been watching everything you do 
 I can look but I can't touch 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 I try to get to know you 
 And your identity 
 You're always in the distance 
 Don't seem to notice me 
 So much I want to tell you 
 How come you're never here? 
 Every time I try to stop you 
 You always disappear 
 Nobody knows ya 
 But I've got to fight 
 Something about ya 
 Plays in my mind 
 What's your name? 
 Been watching everything you do 
 I can look but I can't touch 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 What's your name? 
 Been watching everything you do 
 I can look but I can't touch 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 Listen, I put it down in a way that you have to just love 
 Mad xxxxxx, dance with me, so we passin' them both? 
 At the end of the night when I'm asking "What's up" 
 Track 6 of 50's album that's what's after the club 
 All the same when I run my game 
 Let me make it crystal clear to you 
 Baby jus what's my name? 
 I'm loved by all, duplicated by many 
 The B-I-G D-A double-D Y K any uh 
 What's your name? 
 Been watching everything you do 
 I can look but I can't touch 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 What's your name? 
 Been watching everything you do 
 I can look but I can't touch 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 There's nothing wrong in wanting you! 
 What's your name, there's nothing wrong 
 In wanting you babe all night long 
 I can look but I can't touch
