Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change 
 Let's take a trip down memory lane 
 With the game talker, native new yorker 
 Gators on my feet, formerly british walker 
 Yes love, that's how it was before 
 When you was funky fresh or down by law 
 Parlay with your crew at the corner store 
 Carrying a boom box till your arms were sore 
 We be wildin' on the corner free stylin' 
 Or politickin' 'bout doe we see piling 
 Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it 
 Lying bout skins that we didn't get 
 Slow moving at paces through the rat races 
 The jordache look and fat laces 
 Making moves any type of way 
 I remember it like yesterday, hey 
 Here's to you 
 That's how it was before 
 When you was funky fresh or down by law 
 Way back in the days how we used to do 
 Thank you for the good times y'all 
 Déj? vu, things ain't nothing new 
 Shorties make me think how we used to do 
 When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping 
 Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping 
 Think it can't happen to you, now could it? 
 Came to school wearing puma's went home barefooted 
 And on the weekends when everybody click 
 To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks 
 Come back around the way after dark 
 So the crew could embark on the jam in the park 
 What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight 
 Only way to break it up was playing rappers delight 
 And as I sit back watching you 
 Shorties out there doing what you got to do 
 I feel for you being sincere 
 'Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah 
 Ain't nothing but love I got to give 
 I don't playa hate 'cause we all got to live 
 That negative lifestyle I prohibit 
 Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it 
 Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing 
 But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion 
 Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese 
 Go on with your bad self, black caes 
 Just when the game got the stakes set high 
 Straight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi 
 With a jewel 'cause I'm tired of seeing 
 Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up 
 Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect 
 A new wold order's in effect 
 I send this out to the shorties in the hood 
 I wanna see you all live good
