See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable 
 Here comes dark gable raps remarkable 
 Mic ripper, cash flipper, cristal sipper 
 Derrie're batalliere that's French for ass whipper 
 Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous 
 If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance 
 I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice 
 And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist 
 I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page 
 To the newest in age that's hitting stage 
 For I be one that knows the art 
 To get you up and out your seat, if you was rosa parks 
 Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make 
 Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes 
 You know the lick, seen me hit 'em like a brick 
 Plus my posse run thick, not that click from mario flick 
 Beware of one of the best they be 
 You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat 
 Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me 
 Pardon the vainglory, but here's the kane story 
 Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door 
 About to give you more of the raw 
 Point yo hands up to the sky 
 Fuck the chorus 
 And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis 
 I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you 
 Was invisible it'll make your life miserable 
 Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python 
 I be that wrong one to get fly on 
 Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you 
 That's the other side of the game and I ain't erykah badu 
 Black caesar, don't you even reach my way 
 You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest pai mae 
 I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys 
 A fast demise disaster lies as he dies 
 Confront one of the best at rhyming 
 What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment 
 The untouchable, don't want to tempt me 
 I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry 
 It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me 
 For real, damn I know how jehovah's witness feel 
 I remember how I formed it up 
 'Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up 
 Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up 
 But take a look I think the kane about to overcook 
 Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics 
 Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex 
 I come cutting through split his gut in two 
 I touch 'em what 'em do you know the style ain't nothing new 
 Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door 
 About to give you more of the raw 
 Point yo' hands up to the sky, high 
 Get on down baby we keep it live 
 A good game it lets the plot thicken, 
 But the thing that just ain't clickin' 
 Is the way y'all legalize trickin' 
 You talk about your ride and you don't even got one 
 But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun 
 The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head 
 When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red 
 Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require 
 Desire and admire it entire 
 Sudden impact as I'm guttin' 'em black 
 Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact 
 I come with more in skill, to always score and kill 
 Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than lauryn hill 
 As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence 
 Approach them all with some bad intentions 
 In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine 
 Runnin' through them like a finish line
