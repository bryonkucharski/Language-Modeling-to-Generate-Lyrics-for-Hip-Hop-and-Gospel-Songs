"Bring that beat back, bring that beat back!" -> chuck d 
 "We gonna do a song, that you heard before.." 
 (Kane) 
 Here I am, r-a-w 
 A terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
 Phony MC's, I move on and seize 
 I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease 
 'Cause I'm at my apex and others are below 
 Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
 Second to none, making MC's run 
 So don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one 
 I relieve rappers, just like tylenol 
 And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
 Try to front, perpetratin a stunt 
 When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
 I'm genuine like gucci, raw like sushi 
 To stage a rage is what rap did to me 
 To make me want to create, chaos and mayhem 
 Cold rock a party, until the a.m. 
 I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle 
 While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a 
 Little rhyme with authority, superiority 
 And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
 The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
 Better than dynasty, or hill street blues 
 I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw 
 'Cause I get raw! 
 "R-a-w" (cut and scratched by mister cee 4x) 
 (Kane) 
 Attact, react, exact, the mack'll move you with 
 A strong song as long as you groove to this 
 I keep the crowd loud when you're hyped 
 Do damage on stage and injure the mic 
 As I shoot the gift, MC's stand stiff 
 While my rhymes stick to you like skippy and jif 
 Feel my blunt fist, or my death kiss 
 The rap soloist - you don't want none of this 
 Supreme in this era, I reign with terror 
 When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a 
 Fascinating rhyme, as I enchant them 
 So let's all sing the big daddy anthem 
 Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro 
 An entertaining gain, the kane'll never no 
 Problem, I could sneeze sniffle or cough 
 Eeee-even if I stutter I'ma still come off 
 Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip 
 They sho' nuff ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped 
 But my apparatus is up to status 
 Don't ask who the baddest, or cause static 
 To make or break or take em, my rhymes hit the head 
 Put it to bed, so watch what's said 
 Save the bass for the piper, rearrange your tone 
 Take a loss and be forced from the danger zone 
 I get ill and kill at will 
 Teachin a skill that's real, yeah no frill 
 Just stand still and chill as I build 
 Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up! 
 "R-a-w" -- don't even get up 
 Competition shut up, 'cause I'm raw! 
 "Help me!" (cut and scratched 8x by mister cee) 
 (Kane) 
 The man at hand to rule and school to teach and reach 
 The blind to find their way from a to z 
 And be the most and boast the loudest rap 
 Again, to reign your domain (yeah kane) 
 The heat is on, so feel the fire 
 Come off the empire, all the more higher 
 Level of depth, one step beyond dope 
 The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope 
 'Cause I never let 'em on top of me 
 I play 'em out like a game of monopoly 
 Let 'em speed around the board like an astro 
 Then send 'em to jail for tryin' to pass go 
 Shakin 'em up, breakin 'em up, takin' no stuff 
 But it still ain't loud enough 
 So let the volume increase, never to cease 
 I'ma release a masterpiece a slip of the tongue like grease 
 Rippin the mic to shreds, puttin' heads to bed 
 Code red cause the rhymes is bein said 
 By the asiatic printer of raw poetry 
 No hints or clues, you all know it's me 
 I go pound for pound and round for round to clown the sound 
 Profound it's bound to go down, uh 
 A lyrical knockout, showin I got clout 
 My comp should just drop out 
 Cause none of them can see me 
 I leave 'em winan like their name was bebe or cece 
 I get raw!
