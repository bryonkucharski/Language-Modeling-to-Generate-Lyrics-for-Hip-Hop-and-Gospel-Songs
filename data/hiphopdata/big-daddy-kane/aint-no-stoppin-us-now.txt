Here we go, here we go on the smooth side 
 Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide 
 With the source, and of course - I don't wanna be the king or boss 
 I just wanna get my point across 
 'Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes 
 Realize, we on the rise 
 To the climax, time to take charge 
 Whoever said we can't live large? 
 To seek out fortune without distortion 
 And stop livin' for just a small portion 
 There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break 
 All chains become awake 
 Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave 
 And I ain't goin' out like a slave 
 In eighty-nine, I'm livin' like a champ 
 Step out my face, talkin' 'bout a food stamp 
 Child please, put it at ease 
 Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these 
 We can't take shorts or take a loss 
 So take it from the kane and go for yours, because 
 Uh-huh 
 There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear 
 We gotta step up front, to get our share 
 Make the change, 'cause we're not inferior 
 For example, there was a black ms. America 
 Let's start to do for ourself 
 We can't depend on no one else or the board of health 
 So hold your own or else you're gonna find 
 That if you play off of crime you go out like aunt jemimah 
 We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive 
 To stay alive, that's the reason I've 
 Came to, motivate us to the length 
 Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch 
 Takin' no mediums or small at all 
 We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall 
 What used to be just hopes and thoughts 
 Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because 
 Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go 
 One more thing 
 Let's unite together, we can't sever never 
 No matter what or what-ever 
 Because we need unity to find justice 
 Just I see equality so bust this 
 Take a stand and command to demand what's grand 
 I know we can if we just understand 
 The true way of livin' that was really meant for us 
 So one more time, kick the chorus! 
 Ah keep it goin' y'all 
 A prince paul, rulin 'em all y'all 
 A prince paul, schoolin 'em all y'all 
 And tony, tony, tony, tony 
 And tony tone never leavin' the girls alone 
 Tony tone never leavin' the girls alone 
 And you don't stop, and you don't stop 
 And you don't stop, and you don't stop...
