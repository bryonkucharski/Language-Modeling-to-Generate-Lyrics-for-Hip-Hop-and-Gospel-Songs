*I was born...* 
 Big Daddy Kane: 
 ...A black man from the motherland 
 Speakin' a language today most people don't understand 
 Where no one could bother me 
 'Cause I had freedom, justice and equality 
 But then one day it was tooken away 
 And I was shipped to the U.S.A. 
 A young brother, made into a slave 
 To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins 
 Given a new name, new religion 
 No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision 
 I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out 
 The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about 
 They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa 
 And all the blacks there now are just scavengers 
 That's the way my mind was poisoned 
 To believe that in America blacks are inferior 
 A weak mind and a body of swine 
 Only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind 
 Illiterate to who where what and why 
 So I ask myself: who am I? 
 *I was born...* 
 Big Daddy Kane: 
 ...A native New Yorker on the streets 
 Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats 
 That I found in the attic, noisy with static 
 A sound that made me a hip-hop fanatic 
 I made a few songs that sold OK 
 Never top 20 or plenty airplay 
 I came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel 
 Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel 
 I had to make that change and rearrange 
 My whole rap format, no hardcore rap 
 So now all the pop charts I rule 
 Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh 
 I thought I made it, then my song faded 
 And none of the black stations ever have played it 
 I tried to blame it on MTV 
 And say, "Damn, they cold played me for Young MC" 
 But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame 
 Because I wanted the fame 
 Money is not only the root of all evil 
 It's also the destruction of black people, so 
 Conjunction junction, what's your function? 
 Bein a scout, or sellin out? 
 Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye 
 And say: who am I? 
 Gamilah Shabazz: 
 A solid change, have to rearrange this strange feelin' 
 I'm feelin', so appealin 
 I am having to deal with 
 Time to forget the myth, of bein black and a woman 
 Can't get ahead, walkin' on a thread, a tightrope 
 Can't cope, don't be a dope, 
 Have a little bit of hope Runnin' your scope on affairs 
 You have to be aware, don't flare up 
 Let your cup runneth over I'm not Irish, 
 Don't need a donut to fill up my dish 
 Nor two mango wish to wish on a star, 
 They're so far 
 Anyway I'm thinkin' about today, not tomorrow 
 I'm not a follower of anyone 
 My time has come, it's already here 
 My message is clear 
 Like the women of long ago, I am also here 
 Also to show, I have the courage 
 Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity 
 No matter the life, length of time 
 Show me a sign, should I rely on a 
 Subliminal message, should I question 
 What would seem to be, life's told me? 
 Yes indeed, so let me speak 
 Big Daddy Kane: 
 And that's comin' from the daughter of Malcolm X 
 So black women put it in your texts 
 So you can never let opportunity pass you by 
 Or even ask yourself, who am I?
