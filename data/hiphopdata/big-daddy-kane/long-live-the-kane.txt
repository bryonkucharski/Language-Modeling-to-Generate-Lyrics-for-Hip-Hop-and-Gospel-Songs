Party people in the place 
 Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace 
 And make you motivate, and accelerate 
 Cause like Tony the Tiger, I'm greeeat! 
 Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow 
 I mean me being wack, oh come come now 
 That's quite ridiculous, so just admit you was 
 Thrilled, it's on your face, and it's conspicuous 
 Not that you're on this, but my performance 
 Is rather exquisite, so hard is it 
 Or supremacy, that's the perfect definition 
 But rappers keep wishing to be in my position 
 Know good and damn well they ain't no competition 
 Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, that's ambition 
 For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy 
 The Big Father, naah, don't even bother 
 Cause that would mean you would have to teach 
 Each and every one idiotic son 
 Trying to make it, you can't fake it 
 The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked 
 Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong 
 So, all hail the man that's here to live long 
 <Break> 
 You know you heard this voice before somewhere 
 And when I said that I'm the Kane, you said "oh yeah!" 
 That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz 
 Oh he's def," you know what time it is 
 But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone 
 More like Patti Labelle, on my own 
 Just single-handed, the mic I commanded 
 Phony MC's don't understand it, and it 
 Is the real thing like the taste of Coke 
 So never sleep on me, better stay awoke 
 Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke 
 To make a long story short, yo I ain't no joke 
 I take time and care in whatever I'm doing 
 And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en- 
 Joy what you're hearing as I entertain 
 So hip hip hoolay, long live the Kane 
 I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it 
 So all hail to the music 
 On exhibit, get with it, now here's my ring 
 The original supreme being Black man 
 Point blank, the cream to rise supreme 
 As those go below like a submarine 
 Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving 
 Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living? 
 Fine in mind, to decline is out of line 
 So pardon this brother as I give you mine 
 To say I'm not, don't even diss yourself 
 Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself 
 Long live the K, the A, the N, the E 
 I say the end will be 
 A big movement, by the time I'm through 
 And that's coming from a Black man's point of view 
 Now pardon me for just changing the issue 
 But all you sucker MC's, it's a must that I diss you 
 The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted 
 Now I'mma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it 
 Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party 
 But the style that I'm using is just like karate 
 So if we ever battle you're bound to be through 
 Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do 
 No I'm not Chinese, it's just rhymes like these 
 That destroy an MC with black belt degrees 
 You're rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose 
 Kid sound awiiite, but I can't taste the juice 
 Therefore, the job is left to me 
 So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee 
 But I won't stop there, I still rock a little harder 
 While the toy MC's step and say, Sayonara! 
 Long Live the Kane! (x2) 
 Break it down!
