Started small with nothing 
 Now I got it all 
 I still want more 
 Who say I can't have that too? 
 You feel me... 
 Foot on the gas, both hands on the steering wheel 
 Jumped in the game, 'cause I know it's real 
 Heard it'll change you, I know it will 
 Gatting still, we made it over the hill 
 Being broke, I know how it feel 
 All about a dollar bill 
 And seeing my son grow up 
 See, they ain't know what they focus was 
 That's when I see my lane open up 
 Drinking champagne on boats 
 So drunk that I'll probably spend a month sober 
 Little more famous but a lot older 
 Been through situations, niggas acting bipolar 
 You don't always keep it real with me, I don't know ya 
 Say they good intentions, but they not even close 
 Say they got sick of whips, but I'm driving the most 
 Nigga I be on my shit, you ain't gotta provoke me 
 Fuck you talking 'bout it 
 You know it ain't like it was before 
 I know it feel like I've been here before 
 We know that it's all about the dough 
 What that mean 
 If it ain't we out the door... 
 Hit the bank and I'm counting more 
 I know to the top's where we can go 
 You know that it's all about the dough 
 What that mean 
 If it ain't we out the door 
 All I know is I been here before 
 Blew that smoke in the air before 
 Smell like dope in the airport 
 I'm the one that they're cheering for 
 Lotta kush smoke, that's what they preparing for 
 Gave you solid shit before now you hearing more 
 Seeing my niggas on top that's what I stand for 
 And only money conversations what I care for 
 And anytime you eat just know you gotta share yours 
 Them niggas out to get you, claiming they down 
 Shit change when you turn around 
 So it's no love for them 
 It's only papers when I roll up 
 Focus on the money now and not later 
 Ain't got the time to play 
 Thirteen cars in the driveway 
 God telling me keep going 
 One foot on the gas, two hands when I'm rolling 
 (Ay what chu doin' nigga?) 
 Getting mine and staying focused 
 You know it ain't like it was before 
 I know it feel like I've been here before 
 We know that it's all about the dough 
 What that mean 
 If it ain't we out the door... 
 Hit the bank and I'm counting more 
 I know to the top's where we can go 
 You know that it's all about the dough 
 What that mean 
 If it ain't we out the door 
 So you really need all those? 
 That's how much you gon smoke?
