You be anything you want 
 Uh 
 Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone 
 Uh 
 It don't stop here nigga 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
 Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer 
 Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture 
 I was with some wild niggas put me on the game 
 Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie 
 All you got your name and your words will never break 
 For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it 
 Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from 
 Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun 
 I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it 
 Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street 
 Way back in the day before I had all of this paper 
 Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters 
 Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin' 
 I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing 
 Always in a different state so now they label me a goner 
 I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner 
 Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there 
 Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there 
 And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it 
 Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate 
 Now let's get medicated 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 I'm hella faded 
 Rolling weed up and smoke it 
 Take your bitch home and poke it 
 Juicy begin so faded 
 Thank God I got a chauffeur 
 Only good cali bud 
 Pulling hoes bad as fuck 
 Just like a youngling my nigga 
 Juicy do all them drungs 
 Niggas smoking that beverage weed 
 I be on that light green 
 Pop marley in the after hours 
 A member of no slit team 
 Get a whole pound smoke it by myself 
 Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps 
 You know I'm fresh up out that corner, pussy marijuana 
 They copy us, they clone us 
 Yeah we so fly we on us 
 Got acting like they been before 
 But they ain't never been at all 
 8 balls I was in no hole 
 Ain't have time to fuck with y'all 
 Champagne when we celebrate 
 Keen sense so I smell the hate 
 Middle finger we getting paid 
 It cost much but don't press that eight 
 That dotted line it ain't like that day 
 Comic book let 'em ill it straight 
 Like power bang when they lift that cane 
 My cousin died wish I can get that day 
 Back like it's a vertebre 
 Bring that nigga on front street 
 Talk about and never be about it 
 They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me 
 So anything you need you know that's on me 
 And that's OG, I swear homie 
 Now let's get medicated 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 I'm hella faded 
 Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique 
 My city holding on to me so niggers holding on their heat 
 Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf 
 Ondoers get high all we want is peace 
 Always on the grind that's every day so police looking 
 I'm just rapping killing beats tryin' to stay away from booking 
 Yeah my nigga dirty crocked I just had to make it on 
 And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home 
 Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin' 
 I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing 
 Always in a different state so now they label me a goner 
 I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner 
 Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there 
 Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there 
 And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it 
 Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate 
 Now let's get medicated 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 Man, let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Let's get medicated 
 Man I'm hella faded 
 I'm hella faded
