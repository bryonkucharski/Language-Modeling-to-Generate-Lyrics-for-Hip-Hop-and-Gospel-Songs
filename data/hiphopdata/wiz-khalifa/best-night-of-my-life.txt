Ayee I could be your bartender, tell me what you sipping on 
 Girl I'm not a travel agent so what you tripping on 
 You said I think I can make it happen 'cause I'm famous naw I'm just trying to get it cracking 'cause we faded 
 Take you to my crib spend some time alone 
 Barely over 21 that means you kinda grown 
 And I got it tat tat tatted up 
 Come down to that paper imma stack it up 
 Where you going baby girl ? back it up
