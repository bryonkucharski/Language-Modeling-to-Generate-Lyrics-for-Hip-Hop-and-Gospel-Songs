I got so much 
 I got so much 
 I got so much 
 I got so much 
 Oh, still the same nigga 
 Still walking all upon your airplane with all my gang members 
 Smelling like, money and champagne 
 Part of my campaign 
 I'm fucking rich my nigga 
 Some things I can't change 
 Sometimes I swear I be so fly I mean I can't change 
 Sometimes I feel I've got a couple people I can't shame 
 Still rolling weed in a pair of J's 
 Gettin' ashes all over my favorite jeans 
 I ain't mad my nigga 
 I am getting paid, crib with the maid 
 It's all the same shit, different day 
 Keep hearing 'bout what these niggas doin' 
 But them niggas gone, and I'm here to stay 
 (I'm here to stay) 
 I got me a whole one 
 So I'm 'bout to roll one 
 As soon as you jump in the ride with me 
 Now you gettin' lifted, and you feelin' different 
 As soon as you want you can drive you'll see 
 I got so much 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 I got so much 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 I got so much 
 I told her leaving God (Bye) 
 Or she can stay and breathe 
 She looked and said, Cam you don't know what to say to me 
 (Oh really?) Paparazzi oh baby girl, no playing please 
 Now point that camera at my pockets 'cause they saying "cheese" 
 Put up your life we gambling, next time we out here scrambling 
 I'm Killah, he Wiz, but all our checks are Cam'rom 
 Next chapter, next chapter, f-f-f-fatigues and cannons 
 Fresh rapper, fresh rapper right here where I'm standing 
 You play? We playin' 
 Drop by on the way that waving 
 New five, that's how we playin' 
 We have wave, I'm just saying 
 What you sayin'? What I'm sayin'? 
 Money holds clothes and mayhem 
 Amen! Please have her on her knees, and she ain't prayin' 
 I got me a whole one 
 So I'm 'bout to roll one 
 As soon as you jump in the ride with me 
 Now you gettin' lifted, and you feelin' different 
 As soon as you want you can drive you'll see 
 I got so much 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 I got so much 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 I got so much
