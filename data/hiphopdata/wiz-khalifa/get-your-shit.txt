I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl 
 Every night you keep callin me with the same shit 
 I'm goin' insane 
 I swear I love you but this ain't right for us 
 I never thought it would end this way, it's gonna kill me to say 
 But you gotta... 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Told you that I'm movin on you didn't well you oughtta know 
 To mold you I admit was my mission but everything went wrong there 
 'Cause you start actin' different 
 The day you ran up on me I was smokin', chillin' 
 Swore you was tryin' to roll ain't know I was so appealin 
 Fast forward I'm on the road, you at home 
 Callin me back, forth 
 Can't deal with this relationship but this what you asked for, 
 Ask for them pictures of them bitches, 
 Shit, I probably wouldn't be wit 'em if your ass wasn't trippin', 
 Not to mention you action like a kid, is the fuck shit I gotta deal wit 
 Send a text, leave me a message try not to listen bring a wrap, you was the main player, 
 I had to bench you when I showed yo ass how to ball that Louie I bought it all.

 Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend 
 You'll be blowin' my phone up, try to see who I'm seein 
 But I'm chasin this paper, so for this paper I'm reachin' 
 Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin' 
 I consider the fact I will break up anyway, anyway 
 Based on all the shit that you don't appreciate... 
 Me switchin states, workin hard, meetin dates 
 N you were thinkin' everything was sweet, piece of cake. 
 Well that all changed 
 What we had was big but you gonna miss the small things... 
 N that lil cash I spent, that was small change, but above all things, 
 I still love you but I gotta do my own thing... uh
