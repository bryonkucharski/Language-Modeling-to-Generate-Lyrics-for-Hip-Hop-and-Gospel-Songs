 That one match this one, fuck it 
 Money, money, money

 And I got money hoes money and hoes 
 And I got money hoes money and hoes 
 Sick, money and hoes 
 Big money talkin' to you 
 Mothafucka that's 'cause big money brought it to you 
 I be stuntin while them little niggas sayin' nothin' 
 High ceilings high hoes 
 High prices for my clothes 
 And I don't even pay for it 
 Barely know who made the shit 
 Meet a bitch take a bitch 
 Straight back to that big crib 
 Let you roll some rapper weed 
 Put you on some new shit 
 Hit this weed I show you how I do this 
 My excuse is I'm in Cali so my smoke's highly exclusive 
 And my bitch bad my moneys through the roof 
 Your money short you lookin' mad, you Danny Bonaduce 
 Bitch I'm jumpin' in my coup 
 I'm rollin' something that tastes like fruit 
 And I hear them niggas talkin' shit 
 But there's nothing much that they can do 
 When I got a bitch in your city 
 You should try when you see her 
 Never trippin' on no hoes 
 Nigga what you thought we gettin' money over her 
 I'm ballin' hard, my niggas in the same gang 
 I do it big my niggas do the same thing (yeah) 
 I'm throwin' signs it's lookin' like I gang bang (uh) 
 I'm on the team it's lookin' like I gang bang 
 I'm rollin' up my niggas roll the same thing 
 I'm smokin' weed my bitch she smoke the same thing (yeah) 
 I'm throwin' signs it's looking like I gang bang (uh) 
 I'm on the team it's lookin' like I gang bang 
 I tell a bitch bow down 
 To a mothafuckin G ho 
 I work hard I drink slow 
 But I never keep drinks low smokey smokey, 'cause I'm a chief ho 
 Sippin' on pinot grigio, richie ho greedy ho 
 Got me everything like I copped me a genie ho 
 My car look like a building 
 Diamonds dancin on my wrist 
 Bitch I'm 10 feet tall 
 When I'm standin on top of my dick 
 You a sucka ho sucka ho I'm success 
 I feel like a million dollars, bitch I'm up next 
 Money in my hand I don't need no handout 
 And they all got they hands up 
 'Cause they fuck with me hands down (down down down) 
 And the car I push got more tent than a campground 
 And my picture is always on your bitch background 
 Like pada, it's just me and Cyhi 
 Young enough to be your son 
 But she call me big papa 
 She gave me her o nana 
 Then I disappear like tada 
 Smokin' on that tie-dye 
 Now who the fuck gon' stop us 
 I'm ballin' hard my niggas in the same gang 
 I do it big my niggas do the same thing 
 I'm throwin' signs it's lookin' like I gang bang 
 I'm on the team it's lookin' like I gang bang 
 I'm rollin' up my niggas roll the same thing 
 I'm smokin' weed my bitch she smoke the same thing 
 I'm throwin' signs it's looking like I gang bang 
 I'm on the team it's lookin' like I gang bang
