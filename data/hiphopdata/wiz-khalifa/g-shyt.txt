(Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1) 
 Adjust my Louie V vision 
 Fall up in the spot 
 As long as me and my gang get in 
 Every n-gga I came with, came to spend chips 
 On popping champagne and tipping waitresses 
 G'd up, what you think this is? 
 Put your feet up, this the fast, life mama speed up 
 Pop the cork, roll the weed up 
 Nowadays ain't f-cking with the bar 
 Still ain't nothing changed but the horses in my car 
 Usually ain't into showing hoes where I live 
 But tonight we gon' go to my crib 
 Be on your toes, your boyfriend smell that weed on your clothes 
 He don't know what I did, drop you off at your whip 
 Work by 8, almost 6, plus your n-gga calling 
 Think he starting to catch wind 
 Look at your phone, press end 
 Can't hurt him with what he doesn't know 
 Plus you figure we're both grown, come on 
 Money ain't a thang 
 Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every n-gga that's here with me 
 That's the kinda G-Shit I'm on 
 G-Shit I'm on, G-Shit I'm on 
 Got n-ggas rolling weed 
 Bitches with their hands in the air 
 Tell the DJ damn that's my song 
 I ain't trying fall in love with you 
 Let me fill your cup then find our way home 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2) 
 High off the life I'm living 
 Rooftop you gonna need binocular vision 
 Order a few shots and them things that you say you do not do 
 You probably gonna give in 
 Say it's wrong, I call it a statement for the mission 
 To get you high as you want, break dress code 
 Skip the line to the front 
 Ride top down, fire the skunk, soon as the dooby get down 
 Roll another one 
 ? A couple of you, bring my brother one 
 The bitches can't roll weed, I ain't f-cking with them 
 That's just real shit, spend Vegas chips, all expense paid trips 
 Buy the champagne and spill it, we don't save a sip 
 And you here with me in VIP taking risk 
 Home girl saying shit like "Rose my favorite" 
 Plus I'm rolling up all this weed you ever smell 
 Weed in your hair, weed in your nail, she under a spell 
 Money ain't a thang 
 Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every n-gga that's here with me 
 That's the kinda G-Shit I'm on 
 G-Shit I'm on, G-Shit I'm on 
 Got n-ggas rolling weed 
 Bitches with their hands in the air 
 Tell the DJ damn that's my song 
 I ain't trying fall in love with you 
 Let me fill your cup then find our way home
