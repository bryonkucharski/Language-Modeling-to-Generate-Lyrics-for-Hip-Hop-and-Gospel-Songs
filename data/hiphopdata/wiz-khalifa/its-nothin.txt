Count another grip, smoke another zip 
 Yet them young niggas tell it I be on my shit 
 Make a hundred k, spend it all today 
 What can I say, my DNA is Givenchy 
 What my swag is, retarded 
 What I'm driving, Ferrari 
 What I'm rocking, Armani, Gianni Versace, huh 
 Fuck around and I'll buy one of you broke niggas 
 My change, insane 
 My chain, oh that thing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' weed till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' trees till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 You niggas chasin' money I'm on top of it 
 If it ain't money don't know what the topic is 
 Don't come out till next year that mean I'm rockin' it 
 Order thirty-seven bottles call it poppin' shit 
 Goddamn, what you on? 
 A private plane, fuck you on 
 Party in south of France when it's cold 
 Used to rock all that old shit till it got old 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' weed till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' trees till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 My hair longer than your girl 
 Go shawty it's your world 
 Sub-zero flow, when I spit, I see snow flurries 
 Scarface, all out 
 All I want in this world 
 I mean all I want for lunch, is a blunt, and your girl 
 It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you 
 Count money like it's somethin' to do 
 Summer time I'm like fuck the roof, winter time I'm in 'Lo boots 
 And uh, it's nothin' 
 I like being high because it's a better view 
 And, I told your ho my chain so cold it's on Theraflu 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' weed till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 Stackin' cheese till my bread right 
 Smokin' trees till my head right 
 Did it all on my own so, I'mma spend all my bread like 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing 
 It's nothing, it's nothing
