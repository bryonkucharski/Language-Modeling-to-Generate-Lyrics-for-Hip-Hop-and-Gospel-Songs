And I ride, and I'm high 
 Got my drink, roll my weed 
 While I creep slow, my bitch on my side and 
 Where ever that change go, this gang go 
 So talk if they lame, the hoes on it 
 They want it, they say so 
 Whenever we roll by 
 So wont you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car 
 Wont you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car 
 Wont you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car 
 Wont you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 My car match what year it is 
 It's hard not to hear the shit 
 Just know I'm gone no matter what year I'm in 
 Eyes closed when I'm steerin', blowin' O's out the window 
 Suede on the floor, doors plus the ceiling 
 And I keep it clean 
 Hoes wanna get in they gotta wipe they feet 
 Go over a few things then I'ma light this weed 
 Don't want no burn marks sweetheart 
 So hang it out the window 
 If you gotta fuck up once I get you outta here 
 Uh, I'm talkin' loud pipes and rally stripes 
 So much paper I mistake and have to count it twice 
 Yellow car come out at night, all the hoes be into it 
 Remote control start and that bitch runnin' when I get to it 
 Watch yo bitches run up till they get to it 
 And girl there's only one you ain't gon' get two of it 
 So ride wit' the nigga gettin' high, sittin' 22 inches fly 
 Who the shit 
 (Juicy J) 
 Smokin' on some taylor shit, lookin' for a thirsty bitch 
 Ridin' on 26's, my pockets never empty 
 I'm high and always tipsy, ecstasy there plenty 
 Model chick, stripper bitch, I be fuckin' many 
 Ery car paid cash, I don't pay no lease fed 
 But I get my dick sucked, Monica Lewinsky 
 Y'all niggas the toilet bowl, I do all the shittin' 
 Lamborghini flyin' doors, gone wit' the wings in 
 I pop a lotta pills, I pop a lotta seals 
 I pop a lotta pussy niggas that are not real 
 When you see my jewelry game, you gon' get the chills 
 Got hoes like Hilary and smoke like Bill
