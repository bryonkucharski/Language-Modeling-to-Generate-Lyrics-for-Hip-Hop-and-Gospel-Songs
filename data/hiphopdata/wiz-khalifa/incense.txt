Ooh... Oh and oh 
 No, no, no, no, no, no 
 Ooh, no, no 
 Once we smoke, we gotta use them incense, babe 
 Do my stroke, for real 
 I'mma do it slow, like a puff-puff pass 
 Right... 
 And when we smoke 
 Oh, we gotta use them incense babe 
 When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it 
 So long, we be burning out them candles girl 
 Oh, no, no, no 
 When I'm out with my niggas, when you're out with your bitches 
 ...You don't text or call! 
 You the late night type, you would spend a little, too 
 Ride with me, spend time with me 
 Unwind with me, so I could read 
 And be on top of me 
 In front of me 
 Having fun with me 
 Girl, for none of me 
 And when we smoke, we gotta use some incense, babe 
 And when I stroke, you gonna remember my name when I'm in it 
 Go longer than them candles burn 
 You want it all? You get it all 
 Where my down-South girls? Where my Eastcoast girls? 
 Where my Westcoast girls? Where my Chi-town girls? 
 My Toronto girl 
 Oh, I know you with it 
 Out of France, they say that I'm the man 
 And when we smoke, we gotta use them incense babe 
 When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it 
 So long, we be burning out them candles girl 
 Oh, no, no, no 
 When we smoke, we gotta use them incense, baby 
 When I stroke, you gone remember my name 
 I'ma go low, do it till them candles burn 
 Uh, ooh, uh
