First thing uh huh, wake up out a dream uh huh 
 Grab a lighter uh huh, something I can steam uh huh 
 Bong rip uh huh, make sure its clean uh huh 
 Smoke sesh uh huh, nigga what you need uh huh 
 In my car uh huh, cruising down the street uh huh 
 So stoned I'mm need something to eat uh huh 
 No tray uh huh, ashes on my seat uh huh 
 High up uh huh, Taylors on my feet uh huh 
 Cloud 9 uh huh, going through my mind uh huh 
 Take a toke uh huh, hold it till you choke huh uh 
 Moving forward uh huh, cruising on my board uh huh 
 Still got more uh huh, burn it to the shore uh huh 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (Higher than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (High than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling 
 Tell that nigga use a grinder for that weed uh huh 
 And tell him "roll another joint don't fall asleep" uh huh 
 Smoke peace uh huh, pipe like a chief uh huh 
 Heard you got a cheaper price for that reefer huh 
 What you need? Uh huh, never find a seed uh huh 
 Take a dab uh huh, straight THC uh huh 
 For the highest in the room look at me uh huh 
 Somewhere in the clouds that's where we wanna be uh huh 
 Got you shook uh uh, not just for the look uh huh 
 Half the day uh huh, rolled the whole book uh huh 
 Drive slow uh huh, floating by the O uh huh 
 Eyes low uh huh, everybody know it damn 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (Higher than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (High than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling 
 Growing up uh huh, never gave a fuck uh huh 
 Pulling out the 62 and showing up uh huh 
 Twenty-six, guess that mean I'm growing up uh huh 
 Pouring up uh huh, all my niggas rolling up 
 Making sure that... 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (Higher than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 (And I be floating) 
 And I get so high, fuck around and never come down 
 (High than a motherfucker) 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 I get so high, I get so high 
 (And I be higher than a motherfucker) 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling 
 Higher then we're floating 
 Don't know where we're going 
 Night until the morning 
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling
