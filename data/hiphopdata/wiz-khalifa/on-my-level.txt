(Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1) 
 It's the champagne pourin' 
 Big joint rollin' 
 Bombay sippin' 
 No blunt smoking 
 Bad bitch gettin' 
 Thick and she got some friends with her 
 I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor 
 Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures 
 The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter 
 Nigga, you know everything Taylored 
 Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper 
 That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through 
 Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to 
 Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool 
 That's what I have to do 
 See after drinking champagne all night 
 Never worry 'bout a damn thing, y'all might 
 Homie I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 So let me take one shot to the brain 
 And I order three more shots 
 I'm going in, ay 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 I'm on my level (yeah) 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2) 
 Spent a couple dollars on my engine 
 Motor roaring when I back out the garage 
 Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar 
 Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car 
 'Cause I be going hard, roll the camera 
 Life just like a movie, I'm the star 
 Wish you was in my position 
 You too broke to play the part 
 Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back 
 Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin' 
 All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin' 
 Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas 
 So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate 
 All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne 
 (Too $hort) 
 In the middle of the night, early in the mornin' 
 From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin' 
 I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin', we ain't sleepin' 
 These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin' 
 We just freakin' 
 You rollin' with short dog baby 
 She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady 
 Come to my house I give 'em everything they want 
 I might not dot it, but I give to ya women 
 Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana 
 She can suck it if she wanna 
 I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends 
 And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend 
 Man I'm high as fuck 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 Man I'm sloppy drunk 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 I finna pass out 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 A n-gga get smashed out 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 Man I'm high as fuck 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 Man I'm sloppy drunk 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 I finna pass out 
 Man I swear I'm on my level 
 A n-gga get smashed out 
 Man I swear I'm on my level
