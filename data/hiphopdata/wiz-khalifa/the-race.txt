The World turning, the weed burning 
 Them haters talking, I keep earning 
 Know some will say that life's a bitch 
 Well I'ma flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases 
 Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is 
 Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants 
 Keep verses, Mortal Kombat 
 Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' then what you call that 
 Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left. 
 I did everything right nigga better yet 
 Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us 
 Something like a contractor building from the ground up 
 Now just 
 Twist up this weed 
 Realize that you are in the presence of a G 
 Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese 
 Or the ones I use to roll up my trees 
 Fuck it, you know what I mean 
 I'm riding round, smoking good, music so loud 
 Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me 
 Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low 
 Now I just stunt on my own 
 Now I just stunt on my own 
 I'm in a race, and taking the winners place 
 No foot on the brakes 
 One the best, homie that's what they call me 
 It's lonely at the top, got no company so 
 Now I just stunt on my own 
 Now I just stunt on my own 
 See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me 
 My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me 
 But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty 
 Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's 
 Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's 
 My dime piece only recognise the best tree's 
 Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe 
 You in her face, I let her breath 
 From debated on, to waited on 
 From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on 
 'Cause we are, Young Movie stars 
 'Cause we are, Young Movie stars 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 O-ooh-oh, now I just stunt on my own 
 Bitches ain't say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone 
 Used to walk the other way 
 But now they all come to my home 
 And they calling my phone, cause my paper was looong 
 Nothing, they ain't singing my song 
 Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along 
 We flying up, now you want me to take it all off 
 Want me to take it all off 
 Tell a bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all 
 'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all 
 Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall 
 Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star 
 'Cause we are, young, gifted, not to mention out here making muthafucking millions 
 Yeah, I said it, muthafucking millions 
 Got my money up, I'm in the building
