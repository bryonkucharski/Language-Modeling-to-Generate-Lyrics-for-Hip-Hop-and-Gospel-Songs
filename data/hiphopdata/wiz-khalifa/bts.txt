My momma ain't raise no fool nigga 
 Matter of fact, maybe she did 
 My momma raised a fool (haha) 
 But that don't mean we can't get rich 
 Too rich (too rich) 
 That's what they say 
 Humble beginnings, rich ass endings 
 Pockets on swole, big ass benjies 
 Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin' 
 Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin' 
 Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker 
 Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper 
 What can I say now, cops know my name now 
 No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now 
 Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds 
 Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now 
 Try not to fade now, try to find a way out 
 Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down 
 Made so much money but look how I'd paid out 
 Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house 
 Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about 
 It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about 
 Try to be the best that I can 
 They got the right decisions, handle it like a man 
 You know I try to do shit with my heart 
 They talk but I don't listen 
 I just finish what I start 
 You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't 
 They got the right decisions, handle business like a man 
 You know I try when people say I should change 
 Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same 
 Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting 
 Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases 
 But never said I'd stop counting these faces 
 Flyin' new places, buying them cases 
 Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it 
 'Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment 
 I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter 
 The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us 
 Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer 
 Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor 
 Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures 
 Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures 
 Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender 
 Big winner in the club, big cash spender 
 Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher 
 Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business 
 Try to be the best that I can 
 They got the right decisions, handle business like a man 
 You know I try to do shit with my heart 
 They talk but I don't listen 
 I just finish what I start 
 You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't 
 They got the right decisions, handle business like a man 
 You know I try when people say I should change 
 Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
