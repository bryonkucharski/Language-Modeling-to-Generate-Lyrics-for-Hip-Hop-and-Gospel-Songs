Cookin' Soul 
 Yeah 
 It's all about a dollar man 
 Don't let nobody else tell you anything otherwise 
 Unless it's me 
 Uh 
 Leave my iPhone cracked if I take a loss 
 Know I'm gon get it back, I'm always on attack 
 Learn to let the money stack, homies turn to rats 
 When you deal with certain cats, they deserve the facts 
 Stay in constant meditation, always burning back 
 Wipe them ashes off my lap, you ain't part of my set 
 It's harder to maintain than it is to get 
 That's why you hold on to it and don't ever forget 
 That you did good with less just gotta deal with the stress 
 It's part of the game 
 Sometimes things ain't gon work out 
 How you think you want it to go 
 Sometimes you gotta keep going 
 When you think you can't no more 
 Sometimes you can't depend on 
 Who you think you can no more 
 Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and 
 Figure it out 
 Knowing your worth is half the battle 
 Keep fuck niggas out of your circle 
 Yeah they gon try to hurt you 
 See you focusing, they try to divert you 
 Being fake ain't rare, it's universal 
 That's why I'll never work with you 
 Family first, till I'm in the dirt 
 How these niggas bosses but they needing work 
 That's exactly why I don't believe em 
 Goals, set em, achieve em 
 Joints smoke 'em and leave em 
 Ten toes, no matter the season 
 Hot tub with my feet in 
 Living comfortably cheesing 
 Sometimes things ain't gon work out 
 How you think you want it to go 
 Sometimes you gotta keep going 
 When you think you can't no more 
 Sometimes you can't depend on 
 Who you think you can no more 
 Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and 
 Figure it out 
 You know what, playboy? 
 They always gonna wonder why 
 You gotta have a brand new car 
 Or why you gotta have the flyest watch 
 But you know what, playboy? 
 You just gotta keep doing you 
 'Cause ain't nobody do you better than you 
 You look good doing it too, playboy 
 And you know what else 
 Them haters, they just gon keep hating man 
 And when you on top, people always gon want your spot 
 But you know what, playboy? 
 It's up to you whether you give it to them or not 
 So keep that in mind, playboy
