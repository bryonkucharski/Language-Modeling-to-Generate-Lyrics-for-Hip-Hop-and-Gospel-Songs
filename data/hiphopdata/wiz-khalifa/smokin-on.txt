Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though 
 'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke 
 I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast 
 Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though 
 Cut those cameras on cause my camos on 
 And my niggas backin' me riding around town 
 With a big old bag of weed 
 Taylor Gang, we ain't in your faculty 
 Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece 
 Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we 
 'Bout it 'bout it like Master P 
 Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees 
 TGOD, he's the OG, real G shit what it has to be 
 My real nigga gon' pop tags for me 
 Fake niggas gon' get bags for me 
 Say you just wanna shake hands with me? 
 Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me 
 Now I'm riding around town in the car that you can't even pronounce 
 And you can't go fast as me 
 Smoking marijuana, and she know that I'm a player 
 So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me 
 That pimp shit come naturally 
 That fuck shit is whack to me 
 My kush grown organically 
 My ballin' is actually 
 Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though 
 'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke 
 I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast 
 Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho' 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 Let me turn you on and turn you out 
 To make you feel like you really wanna feel 
 For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill 
 You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop 
 Light green kush cut from a bush 
 Mix it together, get it together 
 Hypo grow with the hydro flow 
 Smoking on some shit called I don't know 
 This is the shit that was caught 
 From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no! 
 Cuttin' it up, button it up 
 Homie don't speak at all 
 You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait 
 I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight 
 Wrong class, featherweight, levitate 
 Set it straight, let me break it down for you 
 Clip it, zip it, let it fly 
 If it's good, it's gonna get you high 
 Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one 
 We don't even smoke that shit for fun! 
 Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though 
 'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke 
 I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast 
 Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho' 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 Yeah nigga, I'm rolling up that high-grade 
 Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it's Friday 
 Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day 
 Niggas think I'm Chinese cause my eyes straight 
 I threw up a six into a twenty ounce 
 Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces 
 Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck 
 Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let's fuck!' 
 I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it 
 Where my mind? Somebody help me find it 
 Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch 
 They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher 
 Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though 
 'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke 
 I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast 
 Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho' 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on 
 You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
