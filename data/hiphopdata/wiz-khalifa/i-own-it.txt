(Verse 1: 2 Chainz) 
 Money's the motivation, money's the conversation 
 You on vacation, We gettin' paid so 
 We on paycation, I did it for the fam 
 It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am 
 Yeah, it's the life I chose 
 Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed 
 And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove 
 You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed 
 Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking 
 Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it 
 You used plastic, we 'bout cash 
 I see some people ahead that we gon' pass 
 (Bridge: Wiz Khalifa) 
 I never feared death or dying 
 I only fear never trying 
 I am whatever I am 
 Only God can judge me, now I'm 
 (Hook: Wiz Khalifa) 
 One shot, everything rides on tonight 
 Even if I've got three strikes 
 I'mma go for it 
 This moment, we own it 
 And I'm not to be played with 
 Because it can get dangerous 
 See these people I ride with 
 This moment, we own it 
 (Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa) 
 And the same ones that I ride with 
 Be the same ones that I die with 
 Put it all out on the line with 
 If you looking for me you can find Wiz 
 In the new car or in the crown with 
 My new broad, that's a fine chick 
 And the wonder squad, I'm down with 
 Ain't no way around it 
 What you say, tell me what you say 
 Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day 
 Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball 
 Like the mob all you do is call 
 Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa 
 (Bridge] + [Hook) 
 (Verse 3: 2 Chainz) 
 (I ride or die for love) 
 This the biggest day of my life 
 We got big guns, been graduated from knives 
 It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride 
 Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside 
 Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet 
 Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet 
 At the red light, rims sittin' off set 
 I look better on your girl than her outfit 
 (Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa) 
 Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran 
 We the fam and loyalty never change up 
 Been down since day one, look at where we came from 
 Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it 
 Got a problem, I got the same one 
 Money rolls, we fold 
 Plently clubs we closed 
 Follow the same code 
 Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control 
 (Hook: Wiz Khalifa)
