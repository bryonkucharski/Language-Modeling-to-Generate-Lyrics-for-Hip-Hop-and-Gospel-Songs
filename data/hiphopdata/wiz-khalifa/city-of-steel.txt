Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel 
 Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel 
 Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel 
 Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel 
 Hotel smoked out 
 I ain't going nowhere 
 Leaving in the morning 
 Cleaning lady picking up roaches, so she don't care 
 How I move so player? G Pen, mid-air 
 High school I was getting high 
 Teacher say I was going nowhere 
 Now I'm worth millions that's the worst feeling 
 Said fuck a job bought the building 
 All these fake niggas where the real ones 
 First-class no shoes, young nigga I got no rules 
 6'1", no roof, go hard won't lose 
 And you know the truth, I got more to do 
 Already made history once 
 Fuck I'm supposed to do? 
 Big bag, no seeds 
 Yeah I rap and I grow weed 
 When you this great, niggas don't hate 
 It's about dollars so it can't wait 
 Break down the gas roll another one 
 Puff one J, roll my brother one 
 Already stoned and I'm almost home 
 If you high then you know where I'm coming from 
 KK feel it all in my lungs, one puff damn got me going numb 
 Everywhere I go niggas want some 
 (Damn, man let me get some of that shit) 
 No, high all day I ain't coming down 
 Take two pulls then it's going round 
 Since a young nigga I been blowing pounds 
 Always in the sky I ain't on the ground 
 Jump in the ride about to blow a cone 
 Niggas at the crib so I'm solo 
 Take this half-ounce to the dome 
 Smoke this hash out of the bong 
 Don't choke don't pass out until the morning 
 In the club throwing cash out 'til it close 
 And I stay with the pack on any coast 
 KK cut down to a clone 
 Gameday touchdown Randy Moss 
 Say we just ran out so we getting more 
 We gone smoke 'til we ain't got anymore 
 Don't just roll one roll plenty more
