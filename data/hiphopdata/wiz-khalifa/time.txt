Yeah 
 Who else you know smoke a half pound in seven days nigga 
 Drew on the boards 
 E on the beat 
 Uh haaahaaahahaaha 
 And I'm just doing 
 What I usually do man 
 Sticking to the script 
 No new lines 
 I spend a lot of nights thinking 
 How did I make it this far 
 I spend money every chance I get 
 Cause God damn I work hard 
 Play here to take care of the family 
 But how was I supposed to know 
 If I don't take care of myself huh 
 Then how am I supposed to grow 
 Still rollin' my 0s, and all of my fans, they all at my shows 
 They rollin' them pins and counting up all of them grams 
 We smoking till all of it's gone 
 Just bought a new crib and there's not enough space to fit all of my clothes 
 I'm just riding out in my ride 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Flying like we were time 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 I spend a lot of days thinking 
 I hope this never gets old 
 Then I realize I'm on vacation 
 Somewhere it never gets cold 
 Some criticize decisions that I made 
 But fuck was I supposed to do 
 Long as I'm on everything is straight 
 Plus all my niggas on too 
 So you can't tell us nothing 
 Not a thing no discussion 
 You can smell what I'm smoking 
 Know its dank that I'm puffin 
 Kinda high when I made this 
 On the plane hella comfy 
 On my way to the money 
 I'm just riding out in my ride 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Flying like we were time 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive 
 Smoking weed while I drive
