One time 
 Yeah, day after day I just stay here 
 Waiting for you to get home 
 Lately I been going crazy 
 Can't wait to get in my zone 
 Sometimes I can't find your number 
 And there's no one else to call 
 You leave me waiting by the phone 
 You keep me high, that's for sure 
 But I know, you'll be there when I need you 
 I can't place no one above you 
 I tried but I can't get enough of your love 
 And you're right there for me 
 Said I was just hoping you called 
 I was just hoping you called 
 To say that you don't have nothing at all 
 I was just hoping you called 
 They try and try but can't top you 
 They think they come close but they fall 
 They see me out, give me offers 
 I don't feel nothing at all 
 But I know, you'll be there when I need you 
 I can't place no one above you 
 I tried but I can't get enough of your love 
 And you're right there for me 
 Said I was just hoping you called 
 I was just hoping you called 
 To say that you don't have nothing at all 
 I was just hoping you called 
 Sweet
