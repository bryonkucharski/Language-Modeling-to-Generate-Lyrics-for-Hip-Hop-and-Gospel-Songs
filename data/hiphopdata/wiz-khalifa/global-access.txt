You hear that? 
 It's paper 
 Its bout paper, get your money man 
 Get yours 
 Lay up, if you wanted me, I'm 6 o'clock 
 That mean I stay up 
 See you niggas standing in a line 
 I got my weight up 
 A lot of niggas owing dues, man 
 It's time to pay up 
 Smoke a joint with my girl every time we wake up 
 In your city, but don't plan on staying 
 If you ain't talking 30 million 
 Then we can't arrange it 
 Yeah 
 I treat the game like I'm renovating 
 They call me the landlord 
 I got all the tenants hating 
 Look at my tennis bracelet 
 There's all these diamonds in it 
 And plus my watch is icy too 
 That means it's time to get it 
 Yeah, I think they scared of me like I'm the dentist 
 Like it run in the fam, everyone 'round about our business 
 And I get high off fitness 
 That mean I'm smoking strong 
 Bet all these diamonds will you give you something to focus on 
 Your girl love my song 
 My chain cool the Fonz 
 My kush be the bomb 
 It sing like Solange 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't get dough? 
 All money 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't smoke? 
 Kush 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't rep Taylor? 
 Taylor Gang 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That we can't keep getting that paper? 
 Hell no 
 Big stunner, ex-weed runner 
 My bitch hotter than the middle of the summer 
 Rocking anything I want and 
 Still watch for undercovers 
 Like, I'm just on the sheet 
 Money make me feel complete 
 See, you don't do this everyday 
 That mean you can't compete 
 I'm on top of the game 
 But I came from underneath 
 Never tame me, I'ma beast 
 Watch my change increase 
 Used to just show up 
 But now I make them pay them fees 
 Used to smoke blunts 
 Now I need the paper 
 Being broke ain't in my nature 
 Either block out what they say 
 Or use the talk as motivation (uh) 
 We at the top and know they hating 
 Know sometimes they like the child that whine and get impatient... 
 But there ain't no complaining 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't get dough? 
 All money 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't smoke? 
 Kush 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That they say that we can't rep Taylor? 
 Taylor Gang 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go 
 That we can't keep getting that paper? 
 Hell no 
 And that's how it is 
 I just got on the plane, you know what I'm saying? 
 Smelling like about 5 thousand dollars worth of Khalifa Kush 
 And I dare somebody to say something to me, motherfucker 
 Taylor Gang or die 
 And the gang is for gang 
 Yeah bitch, yeah
