(Intro - (Wiz Khalifa)) 
 Yeah, it's Young Khalifa Man, yeah, Taylor Gang over everything 
 Champagne, paper planes, bitch takin' off her wedding ring 
 Leave with us you'll never be the same, makin' money (in major ways..?) 
 (Hook - (Wiz Khalifa) (Repeat X2)) 
 If I got it then I'm'a spend it if I want to 
 And pick you up anything you want too 
 And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you 
 I do all of that shit them niggas don't do 
 Pop another bottle, I'm'a roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up 
 (Verse 1 - (Wiz Khalifa)) 
 Uh, big-face digits, whips ain't rented 
 Walk inside the bank bitch I'm Ben Frank friendly 
 Big cake piled up on my plate shit endless 
 Throw it in her face watch the bitch make wishes 
 Walk inside the club, bottles of that liquor 
 Groupies actin' up, dyin' to get a picture 
 Rose and Patron, Kush be my cologne 
 Shorty get to keep her weed them joints already rolled 
 All my diamonds clean, all I count is cheese 
 Walkin' on a dream while you tryin' to intervene 
 On top of that money, them haters in-between 
 Smokin' sour (seem..?) you can smell it on her weave 
 Smell it when I leave, niggas catchin' feelings 
 OG Kush prescription keep me way over the buildin' 
 Ridin' in my ride, bangin' in my system 
 High as Whitney tryin' to find a way to get a million 
 (Hook - (Wiz Khalifa) (Repeat X2)) 
 If I got it then I'm'a spend it if I want to 
 And pick you up anything you want too 
 And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you 
 I do all of that shit them niggas don't do 
 Pop another bottle, I'm'a roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up 
 (Verse 2 - (Wiz Khalifa)) 
 Uh, know I'm smokin' sour you can smell it down the hall 
 Learned this as a youngin', what you sell could get you far 
 Captain of my team, tell you how to ball 
 Ain't a game I put that on my marijuana jar 
 Breakfast on the plane, smell like alcohol 
 Diamonds in my chain, muscle in my car 
 Live a movie scene, hundred-dollar jeans 
 Pocket full'a benji's give them 20's to my broad 
 Always on my job, been about my business 
 Killin' all these rappers off now can I get a witness? 
 Lyin' to the judge, flyin' to the club 
 Chopper play the barber came to line a nigga up 
 Heavy in the game, still ain't had enough 
 We takin' all your bitches and buyin' all the drugs 
 Couple thousand for the Louis lining in my tub 
 G'd up from my feet up 
 (Hook - (Wiz Khalifa) (Repeat X2)) 
 If I got it then I'm'a spend it if I want to 
 And pick you up anything you want too 
 And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you 
 I do all of that shit them niggas don't do 
 Pop another bottle, I'm'a roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up
