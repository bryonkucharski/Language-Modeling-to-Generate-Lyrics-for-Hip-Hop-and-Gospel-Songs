I am in the air* 
 All I want is the money 
 And I see it so clear 
 Weed in my grinder 
 Mind on a million 
 Taylor gang in the planes 
 You know it over the building 
 They ask me how fly 
 I'm gonna tell you 
 You recognize the G 
 I Should be lookin' familiar 
 Repeats: 
 Party and chillin' 
 And fast living 
 How I'm supposed to... now the choices giving 
 I chose to leave the club with a couple of hoes 
 Who love to smoke trees rolling the easy wider papers 
 Maintain a low speed 
 How shell I proceed? 
 Come from a city where niggers ain't got a life 
 But got a lot 
 So I be low key 
 Money hoes clothes is all a nigger knows 
 Don't bring a nug I blow it by the O 
 I hit the road cause shit is exactly how it seems 
 I had to sleep and now me 
 I've been living on my dream 
 Marijuana... my surround my... 
 My camera catch the scene 
 Fresh above the plain 
 Think another paper 
 Shorty wanna ride with me 
 As bad as I wanna take her 
 Put you on... bitch 
 Taken pics with the planes 
 And send them to their friends 
 We demand on a million
