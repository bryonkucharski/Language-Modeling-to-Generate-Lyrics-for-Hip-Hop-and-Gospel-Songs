Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world 
 So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl 
 In a mist that I smoke in the air 
 The reflection of lights that glare 
 She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare 
 And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance 
 Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon 
 Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring 
 We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus 
 That's real big, pop my color, pop that lid 
 Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love 
 Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to 
 Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy 
 So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching 
 Then do it again 
 Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night 
 All seven days of the week, I live the party life 
 I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends 
 We going hard till the sun come up and do it again 
 I got a drink in my hand they playing my favourite song 
 This girl that's dancing on me ain't' got no panties on 
 And she gonna come back to my hotel, don't tell 
 Anyone about us, I'm here to party all night 
 Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love 
 Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to 
 Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy 
 So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun) 
 We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching 
 Then do it again 
 Come to my section (my section) 
 And down some of this liquor 
 Then tell me what it hit for 
 Gon be some things I don't remember 
 So take some camera phone pictures 
 Come to my section (my section) 
 And down some of this liquor 
 Then tell me what it hit for 
 Gon be some things I don't remember 
 So take some camera phone pictures 
 Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
