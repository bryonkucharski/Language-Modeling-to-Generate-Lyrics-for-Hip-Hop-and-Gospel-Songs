Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you 
 Thinkin' 'bout what I might do 
 Don't know what got into me 
 Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me 
 Them late night messages

 Keep sendin' them late night messages

 You always talkin' 'bout you know your worth 
 You through with searchin' 'round you know what you deserve 
 He put you through some wild shit, that ain't me 
 You know what I'm about, you get just what you see 
 Ain't got no time for discussion, tryna get into something 
 Shorty hittin' my phone saying she need it, she want it 
 At the house all alone then tryna be in the public 
 When I leave, say she still feel me in her stomach 
 She gon tell you she love you, but she been with the kid 
 We get it poppin', send a message like he leavin' the crib 
 Like to smoke when I drive, roll some weed then I dip 
 Before I come through, she in the bed 
 And once I get over, I keep it goin', don't stop 
 You show how much you love it when get on top 
 Your man's comin' home so we gon' keep the door locked 
 Been smokin' and drinkin' his liquor, now we both high 
 We fuckin' like we tryna get feelings 
 Got you bangin' on the walls, girl, you shakin' up the building 
 Baby girl tell me what the deal is 
 Ain't nothing like them other guys, you fuckin' with the realest

 Nothing's the same 
 No one would play, or come over play 
 I ain't with them games 
 Don't even call, I just comin' over 
 Fresh off the plane 
 You gave him a trial he left your heart broke 
 But never again 
 It's starting to get late 
 I know what you want but I ain't gon' judge you 
 That ain't the case 
 Send me a message soon as I get it 
 Tell me erase it 
 Usually don't do this know what you're doin' 
 You ain't no lame 
 Are you ready for it? Are you ready for it? 
 Never bored, I'ma get my phone, press record 
 Girl, I'm grown so don't worry 'bout nobody knowin' 
 It was good, I decided to see what you was doin' 
 It's been a long time but this thing ain't foreign 
 Give it to you hard we fuckin' up the headboard 
 Switching up positions in the bed, we ain't boring 
 Takin' you up in the sky, feel like you soaring 
 I was supposed to be writin' song but I'm in my low-low 
 When I'm 
 Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you 
 Thinkin' 'bout what I might do 
 Don't know what got into me 
 Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me

 'Cause when I say slide, you slide 
 And when you say ride, I ride 
 Keep a bad bitch by my side 
 And when I say go, you go 
 And when you say, roll I roll 
 You're the last one to hit my phone 
 In my car all alone
