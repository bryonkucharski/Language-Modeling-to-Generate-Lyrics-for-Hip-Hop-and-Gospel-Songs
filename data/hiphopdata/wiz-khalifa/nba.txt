Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet 
 Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 'Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin 
 I fuck her once, don't call her 
 My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 Got so much money I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks 
 Bitch so much money my shit stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks 
 You see me smokin' and you know I got that pack, I got that sack 
 I got that O, I hit the club I lose control 
 I smoke that loud, I know the grower 
 Ball like the owner 
 Hit this gin make things move slower 
 I'm never sober 
 Roll some weed our eyes gets lower 
 I'm in my old school 
 Ride it sound just like a newer motor 
 They're wondering how I get these mills and still live like a stoner 
 No other way, I get a 100k from each promoter 
 Or more than that, hold up 
 Money long it don't fold up 
 Let me get some gin pour up 
 Got some bomb weed roll up 
 Niggas got their gang thrown' up 
 These niggas got their game, they got it from us 
 I'm with my gang and my niggas go nuts 
 You talkin' money, best believe I show up 
 And all the real niggas know us 
 Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet 
 Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 'Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin 
 I fuck her once, don't call her 
 My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 Talkin' money but walkin' funny 
 Is it any reason why y'all starvin' 
 I smell bull and by smelling force 
 Do I really need to beg your pardon? 
 My jersey say James I don't play games 
 Like 'Bron when he in that Garden 
 Now wait, I said that all wrong 
 She don't need to rock when I put my hard in 
 My new nickname is just watch 
 Might not join might just watch 
 New yacht master just a watch 
 Doubtin' me I tell 'em just watch 
 Them diamonds yellow them beams are red 
 And them hands tucked, they don't show 
 Plus them shooters with me got the green light 
 So why the fuck you don't think they won't go? 
 Hold up, your chick traded post game 
 And it's no shame she felt your man 
 She probably on Joe Johnson 
 'Cause I don't never be on that Elton Brand 
 It's YSL, she's fly as hell 
 Tell the come to go to my ride 
 You can't blame hoes ain't Peter Rose 
 Now she a thorn in my side, grow up 
 P-R-P-S is over my Timbs 
 Way shorty blew me out, it was only right I showed her my bench 
 Let my man's hit, when the fan hit 
 We spendin' all these bills on liquor 
 Figured Jersey love his teams 
 But still we got the realest niggas, Joey. 
 Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet

 My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 Keep a bad bitch on my team 
 Got 'bout 5 ounce of that lean 
 My chain blue-ray on that screen 
 I spent two days countin' that cream 
 Got bout five acres on my doorway 
 Your main bitch is my throw away 
 Got bout eight whips they brainless 
 My main bitch like shorty 
 Got my top down her hair out 
 Isolation and she clear out 
 Fast break my bread straight 
 One hand shake and I bail out 
 Hit streets corner bitches callin' tell 'em bring a friend 
 Derrick Rose ballin bitch never goin' broke again 
 Deuces fade on my shades 
 Clear ice they skate 
 LeBron James on that break 
 Real estate with that lake 
 Shootin' from half court got you by a long shot 
 Montana, that nigga from the Bronx block 
 Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet 
 Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again 
 'Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin 
 I fuck her once, don't call her 
 My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league 
 NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
