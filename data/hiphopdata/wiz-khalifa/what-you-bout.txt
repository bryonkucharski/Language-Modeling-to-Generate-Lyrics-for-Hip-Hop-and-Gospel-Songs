I like 'em long hair thick as hell 
 Haters praying that I change like a wishing well 
 Once you get a little name they do what you want 
 You know it's Heart Break Gang upper echelon 
 You know it's three's up when it's repping time 
 These seventeen-hundred don't step on mine 
 I'm in the game finna ball until I foul out 
 All these niggas turn fake I don't know how 
 Tell me the difference between you and me 
 Tell me what these others dudes have to do with me 
 Jamie drinking kush smoking Bathing Ape wearing 
 Suzy 6 Speed gas like a new McLaren, don't compare them 
 I'm a menace in this business ain't I, can't lie 
 Big timer so I had to stay fly ball when it's game time 
 All on the same grind 
 Heart Break Gang is all I know 
 Player coach making more banging Dre since '84 whore
