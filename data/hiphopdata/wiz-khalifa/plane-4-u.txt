 Yeaaheaa 
 This one goes out to all my patients and paitent-ettes 
 With that medical weed card y'all 
 And I heard it's legal in Nevada too 
 Recreation on Seattle 
 So if you got your ID 
 Make sure you show up to your local dispensary 
 And cop you some of that KK 
 And tell 'em I sent you 
 And to all the states that ain't legalize it yet 
 Get on board man 
 We need the green 
 Make the world a better place 
 By putting the grass all in your face 
 Free the weed 
 Let everybody's who's locked up out of jail 
 And let all these patients get well 
 There ain't nothing wrong with it 
 You was just raised to think it was bad 
 But now its time to change your mind 
 Open your eyes y'all 
 Look around, everybody's getting high
