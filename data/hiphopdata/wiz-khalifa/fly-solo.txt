[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa] 
 I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me 
 I woke up and wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah 
 Same song to a different beat 
 Cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there 
 I guess nobody cares, hey 
 But everythings good until it goes bad 
 And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have 
 It hurts when it don't last 
 No easy way saying bye 
 So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky 
 And I fly solo 
 I fly solo 
 And I fly solo 
 And I fly solo 
 And I... 
 [Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa] 
 I'm tired of being tired 
 And dealing with your BS, 
 All the while supplying 
 The money for your request 
 Without me you're a dime 
 But with me you're a buck fifty, haha 
 I can get another one quickly 
 But I'd rather wade it out 
 Take the broken pieces try and fix it 
 Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision 
 And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit 
 Ha 
 [Chorus: Wiz Khalifa] 
 [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa] 
 Remember what you said 
 But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel 
 I was doing good way before I met you 
 Now you're off the set 
 And I'm a let you see the show go on without you 
 Take a bow... think about it 
 And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it 
 See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes 
 The story of my life, you're just another page, 
 But everythings good until it goes bad 
 And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have 
 It hurts when it don't last 
 No easy way saying bye 
 So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky 
 And I fly solo 
 I fly solo 
 And I fly solo 
 And I fly solo 
 And I... 
 I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me (staring at me) 
 I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there) 
 Yeah eh eaah
